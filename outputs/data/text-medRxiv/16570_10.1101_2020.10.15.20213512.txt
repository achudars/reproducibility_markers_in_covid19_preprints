SUMMARY
COVID-19

exhibits

variable

symptom

severity ranging from asymptomatic to

life-threatening, yet the relationship between severity and the humoral immune response is
poorly understood. We examined antibody responses in 113 COVID-19 patients and found that
severe cases resulting in intubation or death exhibited increased inflammatory markers,
lymphopenia, and high anti-RBD antibody levels. While anti-RBD IgG levels generally correlated
with neutralization titer, quantitation of neutralization potency revealed that high potency was a
predictor of survival. In addition to neutralization of wild-type SARS-CoV-2, patient sera were
also able to neutralize the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 mutant D614G, suggesting protection
from reinfection by this strain. However, SARS-CoV-2 sera was unable to cross-neutralize a
highly-homologous pre-emergent bat coronavirus, WIV1-CoV, that has not yet crossed the
species barrier. These results highlight the importance of neutralizing humoral immunity on
disease progression and the need to develop broadly protective interventions to prevent future
coronavirus pandemics.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus infectious disease of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), exhibits significant variability in the
severity of presentation. The impact of this variability on the development of protective immune
responses and the role of antibodies in disease progression is unclear. There is currently no
standard treatment regimen for either mild or severe cases of COVID-19, and there is limited
understanding of the impact that current investigational therapies have on immune responses
against SARS-CoV-2.
Non-human primates (NHP) that have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 have been found
to develop potent antibody responses and are largely immune to reinfection ​(Chandrashekar ​et
al.,​ 2020; Deng ​et al.​, 2020)​. Similarly, animal models testing candidate vaccine approaches
have demonstrated that protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge is positively correlated with
the development of high titers of neutralizing antibodies ​(Mercado ​et al.​, 2020; Yu ​et al.​, 2020)​.
Importantly, passive transfer of convalescent sera has been shown to prevent infection in
otherwise naive animals, highlighting the crucial role of antibodies in mediating protection
against viral infection ​(Hassan ​et al.,​ 2020; Rogers ​et al.​, 2020)​.
In contrast, the role of antibodies on the clearance of established SARS-CoV-2 infection
and clinical outcomes is less clear. Ordinarily, infections with viruses require cell-mediated
immunity for viral clearance. Antibodies mediate functions such as antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity (ADCC) and phagocytosis (ADCP) via innate immune cells such as NK cells and
macrophages. Yet, the need for antibodies in the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been
challenged by two recent cases of patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia who acquired
and survived SARS-CoV-2 infection without requiring oxygen or intensive care ​(Soresina ​et al.​,
2020)​. Some studies even propose the possibility of a pathogenic role of antibodies in primary
infection via antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) and augmentation of inflammation ​(Liu ​et
al.,​ 2019)​, although it is believed that this is insufficient to explain the prevalence of severe
cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection ​(Arvin ​et al.​, 2020)​. As such, a beneficial, neutral, or harmful
role of antibodies in active coronavirus infection remains controversial.
Despite numerous clinical studies presently in progress, no broadly effective
standard-of-care treatment has yet emerged for COVID-19. Remdesivir, a nucleotide analog
active against SARS-CoV-2, has shown modest benefit in severe COVID-19 cases by improving
time to recovery ​(Beigel ​et al.​, 2020; Wang ​et al.​, 2020)​. Hydroxychloroquine was initially tested

in patients based on ​in vitro studies ​(Wang ​et al.​, 2020; Z. Chen ​et al.,​ 2020)​, but subsequent

meta-analyses and ​randomized controlled trials have demonstrated no benefit in preventing or
treating COVID-19 ​(Boulware ​et al.​, 2020; Tang ​et al.​, 2020; Ullah ​et al.,​ 2020)​. Morbidity and
mortality due to COVID-19 is largely a consequence of adult respir​atory distress syndrome
(ARDS) caused by a combination of both hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable states
(Domingo

​et al.​, 2020)​. Among experimental treatments currently being evaluated,

dexamethasone and other corticosteroids that result in immunosuppression have been shown to
reduce disease severity ​(Siemieniuk ​et al.​, 2020) and improve survival ​(Horby ​et al.​, 2020)​.
Given the involvement of immune dysregulation in the pathology of infection, the consequence
of current interventions on the development of humoral immunity is not known.
Recent studies have demonstrated the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants containing
amino acid substitutions in the viral spike protein targeted by antibodies, raising concerns for
potential resistance to neutralization. One mutation, D614G, has rapidly become the
predominant transmitted variant by outcompeting wildtype infections ​(Korber ​et al.​, 2020)​. While
it has been suggested that this mutant results in a more fit virus, the serological consequences
of this change are unclear. Additionally, recent studies in bats have described a novel
coronavirus (WIV1-CoV) with high homology to SARS-CoV-2 that uses the same ACE2 receptor
for cell entry ​(Menachery ​et al.​, 2016)​. It has been postulated that this virus may present a
similar pandemic risk if it were to spread from bats to humans. However, the consequence of
prior SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion on neutralization of related coronaviruses like WIV1-CoV has
not been described.
In this study, we characterized humoral immune responses and clinical outcomes in 113
SARS-CoV-2-infected patients of varying severity who received a range of treatments, as well
as 1,257 pre-pandemic individuals. Our COVID-19 patient cohort contained a wide range of
outcomes, including non-hospitalized, hospitalized, intubated, and deceased individuals. We
assessed inflammatory markers, IL-6 levels, lymphocyte counts, and demographic variables
such as age and sex. A quantitative ELISA that measures IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies to the
receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 and a high-throughput neutralization assay
using lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 and WIV1-CoV were developed to
assess neutralization potency and cross-neutralizing responses. Remarkably, we find that
anti-RBD antibody levels, neutralization titer, and neutralization potency index predicted disease
severity and survival, yet lacked cross-neutralizing activity to pre-emergent WIV1-CoV.
Taken together, our results highlight the impact of an effective humoral immune
response on COVID-19, as quantified by a neutralization potency index, and describe the

RESULTS
Spectrum of clinical severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection
A cross-sectional cohort of 113 COVID-19 cases confirmed by SARS-CoV-2
nasopharyngeal PCR was studied and followed for at least 3 months. The cohort was divided
into the following five groups based on disease severity, outcomes, and pre-existing health
status: (​i​) non-hospitalized, which were never admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19; (​ii)​
hospitalized, which were admitted for at least one day but were never intubated and were
eventually discharged, (​iii​) intubated, which were intubated for at least one day but were
subsequently extubated and discharged; (​iv)​ deceased, which passed away due to COVID-19;

and (​v)​ immunosuppressed, which were includes some non-hospitalized, hospitalized, and
intubated patients, but none deceased) (​Supplementary Table 1​). When compared to
non-hospitalized individuals, all cases of COVID-19 resulting in hospital admission were
significantly older in age (median age 63 versus 28, ​p <
​ 0.0001) and there was a significant
enrichment for males in severe cases resulting in intubation and/or death (74% versus 51%
males, ​p = 0.02) (​Figure 1A​), consistent with prior studies ​(Meng ​et al.,​ 2020; N. Chen ​et al.,​
2020)​. Laboratory data showed that clinical severity correlated with markers of inflammation,
namely, peak serum levels of C-reactive protein (​Figure 1B​), ferritin (​Figure S1A​), D-dimer
(​Figure S1B​), lactate dehydrogenase (​Figure S1C​), and IL-6 (​Figure 1C​), as well as
lymphopenia (​Figure 1D​), as has been previously shown ​(Wang, 2020; Wynants ​et al.​, 2020; X.
Chen ​et al.​, 2020; Zhou ​et al.​, 2020)​. Interestingly, COVID-19 severity was also associated with
peak serum levels of troponin-T (​Figure S1D​), a marker of myocardial damage and/or ischemia
that may reflect cardiac injury, as has been previously described ​(Tersalvi ​et al.,​ 2020)​.
Altogether, our cohort contained a wide range of clinical presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection
with our analyses confirming previously described associations.
Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain IgG, IgM, and IgA ELISA
An ELISA that quantitatively measures IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies that target the
receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was developed to characterize
humoral immune responses (​Figure S2A​), similar to what we have previously described ​(Iyer ​et
al.,​ 2020; Roy ​et al.​, 2020)​. Quantitation was achieved by using a standard curve consisting of
purified IgG, IgM, and IgA isotype of a monoclonal antibody, CR3022 (​Figure 2A​), that
cross-reacts to bind both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD (​Figure S2B​) ​(ter Meulen ​et al.,​

2006; Tian ​et al.​, 2020)​. RBD was chosen over full-length spike as the target protein because of

its specificity to SARS-CoV-2 as well as its ease of production and stability ​(Stadlbauer ​et al.,​
2020)​. Full-length spike has more regions of homology to other coronaviruses that may cause
greater false positivity, as has been shown between SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and
common cold CoVs ​(Chan ​et al.,​ 2005; Ju ​et al.​, 2020)​. In addition, studies have shown that
RBD is the main target of coronavirus neutralizing antibodies ​(He ​et al.,​ 2005)​.

We determined the sensitivity and specificity of this assay by assessing anti-RBD
antibody levels in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2-infected patient serum samples collected between
14 to 42 days after symptom onset (​n = 85) in order to maximize seropositivity for IgG, IgM, and
IgA. We also assessed 1,257 pre-pandemic serum samples composed of a large unbiased
cohort (​n = 1,124) and selected cohorts of individuals (​n = 133) with positive serology results for
cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV, syphilis,
Toxoplasma, and/or rheumatoid factor (​Figure 2B​). Anti-RBD IgG, IgM, and IgA levels were
measured for each sample by interpolation on to the standard curve and a receiver operating
curve

(ROC)

analysis

was used to determined optimal cut-offs that distinguished

SARS-CoV-2-infected patients from pre-pandemic controls (​Figure 2C​). Cut-offs of 1.18 U/mL
for anti-RBD IgG achieved 73% sensitivity, 2.14 U/mL for anti-RBD IgM achieved 66%
sensitivity, and 0.95 U/mL for anti-RBD IgA achieved 48% sensitivity, with >99.0% specificity for
all three.
To assess the cross-reactivity of anti-RBD IgG in sera of SARS-CoV-2 seropositive
individuals, we modified our ELISA to detect IgG antibodies against the RBD of SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV. Interestingly, no cross-reactivity was seen to SARS-CoV RBD despite 73%
homology, nor to MERS-CoV, which has only 17% homology (​Figure S2C and ​S2D​). Additional

coronaviruses—NL63, which has 20% homology to SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and HKU1, which has
1.9% homology (​Figure S2C​)—showed a seroprevalence of >95% (​Figure S2E​), as has been
shown in previously published studies ​(Gorse ​et al.,​ 2010)​, with no correlation between the IgG
antibody levels of NL3 or HKU1 with SARS-CoV-2 (​Figure S2E)​ . These data show that
anti-RBD IgG antibodies induced during SARS-CoV-2 infection do not cross-react to recognize
the RBD of other pandemic coronaviruses. In addition, anti-RBD IgG antibodies to common cold
coronaviruses appear to not provide detectable pre-existing reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD nor
do they correlate with anti-RBD IgG levels in COVID-19 patients. Overall, these data suggest
that natural infection with coronavirus results in anti-RBD antibodies with limited cross-reactivity.

High-throughput SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay
Previous studies have demonstrated the potential to pseudotype retroviral vectors with
SARS-CoV spike proteins ​(Moore ​et al.,​ 2004)​. However, pseudoviruses bearing SARS-CoV-2

spike produced by these methods yield low titers ​(Nie ​et al.,​ 2020)​, hampering large-scale
testing of neutralization. Recently, a forward genetics approach identified an efficiently
replicating vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) variant encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike containing a
truncated form lacking the C-terminal 21 amino acids ​(Case ​et al.,​ 2020)​. Interestingly, previous
studies also showed a role of the cytoplasmic tail of SARS-CoV in altering surface expression
and fusogenic potential ​(Corver ​et al.​, 2009)​. To determine whether analogous truncations might
improve SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus production, we examined the cell-surface expression of
truncated forms of SARS-CoV-2 spike and found that removal of 18 amino acids from the
C-terminus (Δ18) resulted in significantly greater cell-surface expression and higher titers of
pseudovirus (​Figure S2F-H​). This truncation removed a putative ER-retention signal ​(Lontok,
Corse and Machamer, 2004; McBride, Li and Machamer, 2007; Ujike ​et al.​, 2016) while
retaining cysteine-rich domains that are highly conserved among coronaviruses. Using these
spike modifications, we developed a CoV pseudovirus neutralization assay compatible with
high-throughput liquid handling instrumentation in 384-well plate format using our previously
published lentiviral vector system expressing both luminescent and fluorescent marker
transgenes (​Figure 2D​) ​(Crawford ​et al.,​ 2020)​.
To validate our assay, the potency of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody, B38, and a
non-neutralizing monoclonal antibody, CR3022, both of which target SARS-CoV-2 RBD with
known IC50 values, was determined. This yielded IC50 values of ~6 μg/mL for B38 and
undetectable (>100 μg/mL) for CR3022, which were in agreement with previous reports ​(Tian ​et
al.​, 2020; Wu ​et al.​, 2020) (​Figure 2E ​and ​S2I​). In addition, we found that luciferase activity was
directly proportional to the number of infected (i.e. ZsGreen+) cells, providing flexibility in assay
readout (​Figure S2J​). To determine the performance of our assay on human sera, we
measured the neutralization potency of human sera from 1,220 pre-pandemic individuals and
118 COVID-19 patient samples >15 days after symptoms onset, with a dilution range of 1:12 to
1:8,748. The dilution titer that achieved 50% neutralization (NT50) was calculated for each
specimen and ROC analysis was performed, revealing that an NT50 threshold of 1:20 achieves
a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of >99.0% in identifying COVID-19 patients (​Figure 2G-H​).
Overall, we found median titers of 1:664 in COVID-19 patients, with potency ranging from <1:12
to >1:8,748. Comparatively, titers of 1:5 for yellow fever vaccination, 1:8 for rubella vaccination,

and 1:40 for influenza vaccination are considered to indicate protective immunity ​(Hannoun,
Megas and Piercy, 2004; Plotkin, 2010)​. Altogether, we established a highly accurate
high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay that can accurately quantify the
neutralization potency of humoral immune responses directed to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
As a separate note for investigators using pseudovirus neutralization assays, we
excluded pre-pandemic individuals taking antiretroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency
virus infection or pre-exposure prophylaxis (​n = 37 in the original cohort of 1,257) after finding
that potent inhibition of pseudovirus infection occurred in a majority of these individuals (​Figure
S2K​). We believe this was due to antiretroviral compounds in the patients’ sera inhibiting
transduction with our lentivirus-based vector system, thus generating an artifact. Of note,
non-documented antiretroviral use may explain a proportion of the false positives observed in
the remaining specimens (​n​ = 12 out of 1,220).
Relationship between neutralizing humoral immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection and
clinical severity
We proceeded to analyze antibody responses in our cohort of 113 COVID-19 patients as
well as a negative control cohort of 37 healthy blood donors, and found that in contrast to the
typical kinetics of antibody responses in viral infections (i.e. IgM before class-switched IgG and
IgA), anti-RBD IgG antibodies appear almost simultaneously with anti-RBD IgM antibodies after
symptom onset, and only a subset of individuals generate anti-IgA antibodies concomitantly
(​Figure 3A-C​). Interestingly, the development and quantity of anti-RBD IgG antibodies
appeared to be increased and sustained in the time frame analyzed (up to 72 days), while
anti-RBD IgM and IgA antibodies waned after ~42 days. Neutralization titers closely resembled
anti-RBD IgG levels and were similarly sustained over time (​Figure 3D​). Overall, seropositivity
at >14 days after symptom onset was 74% for anti-RBD IgG, 61% for anti-RBD IgM, 41% for
anti-RBD IgA, and 89% overall for any antibody. Neutralization was detected in 95% of samples
>14 days after symptom onset.
To assess the humoral immune response among the pre-defined cohorts of varying
disease severity, we focused on patients for which samples were collected between 14 and 42
days after symptom onset (​n = 85). This time frame was chosen to prevent biases resulting from
time of sampling post-infection (​Figure S3A​), which is known to have a significant impact on the
magnitude of antibody responses. We found that severely ill patients that were intubated or
passed away due to COVID-19 had the highest anti-RBD IgG and IgA levels, but no significant

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.15.20213512; this version posted October 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

differences were seen for IgM (​Figure 3E-G​). These individuals also had the highest
neutralization titers (​Figure 3H​). In contrast, individuals that were not hospitalized had the
lowest anti-RBD IgG and IgA levels and neutralization titers. Unsurprisingly, immunosuppressed
individuals—none of whom passed away—had significantly blunted IgG, IgA, and neutralizing
responses. Upon analyzing anti-RBD antibody seropositivity and neutralization titer, we found
IgG seropositivity was an excellent predictor of neutralization with a sensitivity of 78% and
specificity of 100% (​Figure 3I​). When seropositivity for any anti-RBD antibody was present,
neutralization could be predicted with a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 94%. Anti-RBD IgG
levels correlated the most with neutralization (​R2​ = 0.76) (​Figure 3J​), while anti-RBD IgM and

IgA exhibited weaker correlations with neutralization titer (​R2​ = 0.49 for IgM and ​R​2 = 0.64 for
IgA) (​Figure S3B-C​). Triple positivity for anti-RBD IgG, IgM, and IgA was enriched in severely ill
patients and was associated with the highest neutralization titers (​Figure S3D-E​). However,
anti-RBD IgM and IgA alone were capable of neutralization in serum samples that were
negative for anti-RBD IgG (​Figure S3D​). Altogether, these results highlight anti-RBD IgG as the
main contributor to neutralization from patient sera, with a contributory role from anti-RBD IgM
and IgA.
Although anti-RBD IgG levels correlated with neutralization by regression analysis, there
was variability that appeared to segregate by our pre-defined severity cohorts (​Figure 3J​). To
better visualize this, we plotted residuals of each neutralization titer subtracted from its predicted
titer based on the regression (​Figure 3K​). This revealed that samples from severely ill patients
were biased towards lower-than-predicted neutralization titers, suggesting that they harbored
higher levels of non-neutralizing anti-RBD IgG antibodies that did not contribute to
neutralization. Consequently, we calculated a neutralization potency index (NT50/IgG) for each
patient, and found that intubated or subsequently deceased patients had a significantly lower
index (​Figure 3L​), with all deceased patients having an index <100. Accordingly, when patients
were classified as having neutralization potency indices that were ‘high’ (≥100) or ‘low’ (<100),
there was a significant risk of death in the days following sample collection in the ‘low’ index
group (87% 30-day survival, ​n = 68) and there were no deaths in the ‘high’ index group (100%
30-day survival, ​n = 30) (p = 0.03; ​Figure 3M​). Of note, this finding was true across our entire
cohort of 111 COVID-19 patients (including non-hospitalized and immunosuppressed
individuals) for which both anti-RBD IgG. In addition, neutralization potency index did not
correlate with days after symptom onset and remained predictive of survival when using a Cox
proportional hazards model that accounted for age, sex, hospitalization status, intubation status,

and days between symptom onset and sample collection (​p = 0.03). These results suggest that
neutralization potency index may help risk stratify patients irrespective of where they are in their
disease course. Altogether, severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection significantly correlates with higher
anti-RBD antibody levels but sub-optimal neutralization potency is a significant predictor of
mortality.
The influence of pre-existing medical conditions and COVID-19 therapies on humoral
immune responses to SARS-CoV-2
To explore the influence of pre-existing medical conditions and COVID-19 therapies on
humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 ​we performed multivariate analysis of all available
demographic, clinical, laboratory, and experimental data (​Figure S4​). With the exception of
immunosuppressed individuals, which had significantly decreased antibody and neutralizing
responses, our cohort was not large enough to conclusively detect the effects of particular
pre-existing medical conditions on the overall humoral immune response. However, a principle
components analysis (PCA) that included demographic data, pre-existing medical conditions,
laboratory data, treatments received, anti-RBD antibody levels and neutralization titers but not
clinical outcomes demonstrated clustering of patients by the severity cohorts (​Figure 4A​).
Principal components were mainly influenced by inflammatory markers, anti-RBD antibody
levels, and neutralization titers, but a contribution from pre-existing medical conditions such as
hypertension and diabetes was observed (​Figure 4B​).
To assess the effect of different treatments on the humoral immune response, we
performed an analysis limited to samples collected from patients that had initiated treatment and
were in the hospital for at least 3 days (​n = 69). COVID-19-directed treatment regimens included
azithromycin (an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties), remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine,
corticosteroids, and tocilizumab (an anti-IL-6 receptor antibody). Of note, individuals in the

Azithromycin, remdesivir, and hydroxychloroquine—for which there was concern of attenuating
antibody responses ​(de Miranda Santos and Costa, 2020)​—did not significantly affect anti-RBD
antibody levels or neutralization titers in our cohort (​Figure 4C​). However, we found that use of
corticosteroids and tocilizumab significantly decreased anti-RBD IgG concentration, and in the
case of corticosteroids, neutralization titer (​Figure 4C​). Corticosteroids are a general

immunosuppressant known to decrease antibody production, whereas IL-6 signaling is
important in several aspects of antibody responses ​(Kopf ​et al.,​ 1998)​. Interestingly,
tocilizumab-treated patients had a significant increase in the neutralization potency index
stemming from the larger effect on anti-RBD IgG as compared to neutralization (​Figure 4C​).
This result raises new questions regarding the role of IL-6 signaling in the production of
non-neutralizing versus neutralizing antibodies and how these might become de-coupled,
although a selection bias cannot be excluded. Altogether, immunomodulatory therapies, some
of which have shown clinical efficacy or are actively being studied, influence humoral immune
responses in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.
Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients to emerging coronaviruses
Given the importance of humoral immunity in preventing most viral infections, the recent
emergence of a mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (D614G) has raised concerns for the
potential for convalescent patients to become re-infected. Studies have demonstrated that this
variant may possess greater replicative fitness and an altered conformation of the spike protein
that may render pre-existing immunity less effective ​(Korber ​et al.​, 2020)​. To determine the
impact of this variant on the neutralization potency of sera from patients previously infected with
SARS-CoV-2, we introduced the D614G mutation into the SARS-CoV-2 Δ18 spike (​Figure 5A​).
When characterizing this new construct, we found that both surface expression and infectivity
were further increased relative to that of the D614 SARS-CoV-2 Δ18 spike (​Figure 5B ​and
S5A,C,D,F​), in line with previous studies ​(Korber ​et al.,​ 2020)​. We tested this new pseudovirus,
normalizing for infectious units per well, against the same panel of patient samples and found
an increase in neutralizing titers that was very small but statistically significant (​Figure 5C-D​),
an effect that was seen in a prior study ​(Korber ​et al.,​ 2020)​. This indicates that individuals that
have been infected with either D614 wild-type or G614 mutant SARS-CoV-2 will have
cross-neutralization to the opposite strain, both of which are circulating in Boston,
Massachusetts ​(Lemieux ​et al.,​ 2020)​ and were likely represented in our study cohort.
The emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and now SARS-CoV-2 within the last two
decades has demonstrated the ability of zoonotic coronaviruses to cross the species barrier and
pose pandemic threats. This has prompted microbiologists and epidemiologists to seek out and
characterize zoonotic coronaviruses that have the potential to cross into humans. Recent
studies in bats have identified a novel coronavirus, Wuhan Institute of Virology 1 coronavirus
(WIV1-CoV), which, like SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, has a spike that uses ACE2 receptor for

cell entry and bears high sequence homology to both SARS-CoV (92%) and SARS-CoV-2
(77%). We generated WIV1-CoV pseudovirus using an analogous spike truncation (Δ18)
(​Figure 5A​), which resulted in high expression of WIV1-CoV spike on producer cells as well as
infectivity and titer (​Figure 5E ​and ​S5B,C,E,F​). These results suggest that this C-terminal
truncation can serve as a general approach for modifying coronavirus spike proteins for efficient
pseudovirus production. Interestingly, WIV1-CoV spike could be detected at the cell surface by
the SARS-CoV and -CoV-2-specific monoclonal antibody CR3022 (​Figure S5B​), a finding that,
to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously described. Using WIV1-CoV pseudovirus,
we found that sera from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals showed a lack of cross-neutralization
except for relatively low-level neutralization in a few individuals with very high SARS-CoV-2
neutralization titers (​Figure 5F-G​). This indicates that humoral immunity raised against one
coronavirus is generally insufficient to generate cross-neutralizing immunity to even highly
related coronavirus strains.

DISCUSSION
Traditionally, cellular immunity is responsible for clearing an established viral infection,
while humoral immune responses play a more critical role in preventing future infection. Here we
found that severely ill COVID-19 patients had the highest levels of anti-RBD antibodies, which
other studies have similarly described ​(Shrock ​et al.​, 2020)​. To further characterize this antibody
response, we measured neutralization titers and developed a neutralization potency index
derived from our quantitative readouts (NT50/IgG) to assess the quality of anti-RBD antibodies
irrespective of the quantity produced. Remarkably, neutralization potency was significantly
diminished in severely ill patients, and survival analysis demonstrated that an index of ≥100 was
predictive of 100% 30-day survival, whereas <100 was associated with 87% 30-day survival in
our limited cohort of 113 COVID-19 patients. Thus, this neutralization potency index may be a
useful metric for physicians seeking to risk-stratify COVID-19 patients.
Despite the clear correlation between COVID-19 severity and development of humoral
immunity, the cause-effect relationship between these two is unclear. One possibility is that
severe disease caused by hyperinflammation and/or uncontrolled viral replication induces
overproduction of antibodies that serve as a ‘biomarker’ of severity. This is supported by our
finding that the most severely affected patients had the highest levels of inflammatory markers
and cytokines, which can drive antibody production. In support of this possibility, a recent study
suggests a pathogenic role of immune activation and exuberant antibody production from
extrafollicular B cells in critically ill patients ​(Woodruff ​et al.,​ 2020)​. Indeed, of all the COVID-19
treatment regimens being used and tested, dampening of the immune response with
corticosteroids has proven to have one of the greatest benefits in improving outcomes and
survival ​(Siemieniuk ​et al.​, 2020)​, and we find that corticosteroids decrease both anti-RBD IgG
levels and neutralization titers. However, another possibility is that high levels of antibodies with
low neutralization potency worsen disease severity, possibly via ADE. This is supported by our
finding of decreased neutralization potency in severely ill patients, and raises concerns over the
use of convalescent plasma as a treatment strategy. One exception, however, may be in
immunosuppressed individuals, which generally have sub-optimal antibody levels and
neutralization titers. Further studies in animal models of COVID-19 testing passive transfer of
low-potency index sera may help resolve this controversy.
A multitude of vaccines are presently being evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 prevention,
including inactivated virus ​(Gao ​et al.,​ 2020)​, spike antigen ​(Jackson ​et al.,​ 2020; Keech ​et al.,​
2020)​, and RBD antigen ​(Dai ​et al.,​ 2020; Mulligan ​et al.​, 2020)​. Each will likely result in

humoral immunity with different ratios of neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies. Given our
results, it will be important to assess the potency index of each candidate to determine those
with maximal potential. Interestingly, one study showed that vaccination of mice with RBD
generated potently neutralizing antibodies without antibody-dependent enhancement. This was
postulated to be due to the lack of immunodominant non-neutralizing epitopes present on the
remainder of the spike protein ​(Quinlan e
​ t al.​, 2020)​.
The diverse and atypical kinetics of antibody production—in particular, early rise of IgG
and in some cases IgA—suggests the possibility of a contribution from class-switched (IgG+ or
IgA+) memory B cells early in the humoral immune response rather than solely from the naive
(IgM+) B cell pool, as has been recently postulated ​(Song ​et al.​, 2020)​. Regardless, our results
support a role for anti-RBD IgM and IgA in contributing to SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, despite
their transient nature in serum. Anti-RBD IgG responses and neutralization, on the other hand,
were sustained in the time frame analyzed (~60 days), but several studies have emerged that
question the longevity of these responses, which have yet to be determined. It is tempting to
speculate that severely afflicted individuals may have more enduring immunity than mild cases.
The differences in humoral response induction may stem from a combination of factors,
including host permissibility to viral replication and a rapid response from innate immune
effector cells and cytotoxic T cells, some of which have been postulated to arise from
cross-reactive memory cells to other coronaviruses ​(Grifoni ​et al.,​ 2020)​.
Although the mutation rate of coronaviruses is very low when compared to other viruses
such as influenza or HIV, certain mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged
in the setting of the rapidly spreading pandemic. We found that one such mutation, D614G,
which has now spread and become a dominant strain worldwide, does not affect the neutralizing
ability of patient sera, reducing concerns for re-infection. Still, prior coronavirus pandemics (e.g.
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and now SARS-CoV-2) have occurred due to zoonotic coronaviruses
crossing the species barrier, indicating an ongoing threat of future pandemics even in the face
of effective vaccines to current viruses. One pre-emergent bat coronavirus, WIV1-CoV, is highly
homologous to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and can infect ACE2-expressing human cells
(Menachery ​et al.,​ 2016)​. Our data demonstrate that sera from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients
exhibit very limited cross-neutralization of WIV1-CoV, except for rare individuals with relatively
low-level neutralization of WIV1-CoV, suggesting that generation of broadly neutralizing
antibodies is indeed possible, as has been previously described ​(Wec ​et al.​, 2020)​.
In summary, the development of potently neutralizing humoral immunity against

SARS-CoV-2 appears to increase survival, and may protect against re-infection with other
circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. However, it is generally unlikely to provide protection against
subsequent coronavirus pandemics. As such, future efforts should focus on the development of
broadly active therapies and prevention modalities that generate potently neutralizing antibodies
with activity across different coronavirus strains.

METHODS
SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain IgG, IgM, and IgA ELISA
To quantitatively detect IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding
domain (RBD), we developed an indirect ELISA using an anti-SARS-CoV and -CoV-2
monoclonal antibody (CR3022) with IgG1, IgM, and IgA1 isotypes (kindly provided by Galit
Alter, Stephanie Fischinger, Caroline Atyeo, and Matt Slein in collaboration with Jeffrey Bernard
at MassBiologics). RBD was produced in Expi293F suspension cells with a C-terminal
SBP-(His)​8 tag followed by affinity chromatography and then size exclusion chromatography
prior to removal of the His tag as described previously. 96-well Nunca MaxiSorp ELISA plates
(ThermoFisher) were coated with purified RBD diluted in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (Sigma)
to a concentration of 1 μg/mL for IgG and IgA plates and 2 μg/mL for IgM plates for 1 h at room
temperature. Plates were washed with a wash buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) (Sigma),
140 mM NaCl (Sigma), and 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma). Plates were incubated with a blocking
buffer consisting of 1% BSA (Seracare), 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), and 140 mM NaCl for 30 min at
room temperature, and then washed. Serum samples were diluted 1:100 with a dilution buffer
consisting of 1% BSA, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 140 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween-20. The
Tween-20 detergent served as an inactivation agent to render samples non-infectious, as has
been previously described for other enveloped viruses ​(Mayo and Beckwith, 2002)​. A
seven-point standard curve was created using each of the standards (i.e. CR3022-IgG1,
CR3022-IgM, CR3022-IgA1) starting at 2 μg/mL by performing 1:3 serial dilutions with dilution
buffer. Samples and standards were added to corresponding wells and incubated for 1 h at
37°C, followed by washing. Human antibody isotypes were detected with specific antibodies
(Bethyl) diluted as indicated: anti-human IgG-HRP (1:25,000), anti-human IgM-HRP (1:20,000),
and anti-human IgA-HRP (1:5,000). These were added to each plate and incubated for 30 min
at room temperature. After washing, TMB substrate (Inova) was added to each well and
incubated for 7 min (for IgG), 13 min (for IgM), and 10 min (for IgA), before stopping with 1 M
H​2​SO​4​. Buffer compositions, reagent concentrations and incubation times and temperatures
were optimized in separate experiments for each analyte to maximize signal-to-noise ratio.
Optical density (O.D.) was measured at 450 nm with subtraction of the O.D. at 570 nm as a
reference wavelength on a SpectraMax ABS microplate reader. Anti-RBD antibody levels were
calculated by interpolating onto the standard curve and correcting for sample dilution; one unit
per mL (U/mL) was defined as the equivalent reactivity seen by 1 μg/mL of CR3022.

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay
To compare the neutralizing activity of patient sera against coronaviruses, we produced
lentiviral particles, pseudotyped with different spike proteins, by transient transfection of 293T
cells and titered the viral supernatants by flow cytometry on 293T-ACE2 cells (Moore et al.
2004). Virus production was also quantified by p24 ELISA on viral supernatants using the HIV-1
p24​CA antigen capture assay (Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc). To increase throughput and
consistency, assays and readouts were performed on a Fluent Automated Workstation (Tecan)
using 384-well plates (Grenier). ​Following an initial 12-fold dilution, the liquid handler performed
serial three-fold dilutions (ranging from 1:12 to 1:8,748) of each patient serum and/or purified
antibody in 20 μL followed by addition of 20 μL of pseudovirus containing 125 infectious units
and incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, 10,000 293T-ACE2 ​(Moore ​et al.​, 2004)
cells in 20 μL cell media containing 15 μg/mL polybrene were added to each well and incubated
at 37​°C for 60-72 h. Cells were lysed using a previously described assay buffer (Siebring-van
Olst et al., 2013) and luciferase expression was quantified using a Spectramax L luminometer
(Molecular Devices). Percent neutralization was determined by subtracting background
luminescence measured in cell control wells (cells only) from sample wells and dividing by virus
control wells (virus and cells only). Of note, repeated sera neutralization measurements in
independent assays using 500, 250, 125 infectious units of pseudovirus per well generated
similar results (data not shown), indicating that the NT50 is not significantly influenced by
pseudovirus titers. Data was analyzed using Graphpad Prism and NT50 values were calculated
by taking the inverse of the 50% inhibitory concentration value for all samples with a
neutralization value of 80% or higher at the highest concentration of serum or antibody.
Flow Cytometry
To quantify the pseudotyped lentiviral supernatants in terms of infectious units, we plated
400,000 of either 293T or 293T-ACE2 cells in 1 mL in a 12-well plate format (Corning). 24 h
later, ten-fold serial dilutions of lentiviral transfection supernatant were made in 100 ​μ​L, which
was then used to replace 100 ​μ​L of media on the plated cells. Cells were then incubated with
lentivirus supernatant for 48 h at 37​°C and then harvested with Trypsin-EDTA (Corning),
resuspended in PBS supplemented with 2% FBS (PBS+), and measured on a Stratedigm
S1300Exi Flow Cytometer. Samples were gated for ZsGreen expression.
To compare the relative surface expression of pseudovirus spike protein, we plated
400,000 293T cells per well in 1 mL in a 12-well plate. 24 h later, we transfected each well with

a lentiviral helper vector coding for different spike proteins. The cells were incubated for 48 h at
37​°C and harvested into PBS containing 1% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) (called PBS+). Cells
transfected with each vector were divided into 3 aliquots, stained with either PBS+, CR3022
SARS-CoV antibody (10 ​μ​g/mL in PBS+), or B38 SARS-CoV-2 antibody (10 μg/mL in PBS+) for
30 minutes at room temperature. Cells were then washed with 1 mL PBS+, spun at 1,150 x g,
and stained with anti-human IgG AF647 polyclonal antibody (Invitrogen) at 2 μg/mL in PBS+ for
30 minutes at RT. Cells were washed with 1 mL of PBS+, spun at 1,150 x g, resuspended in
150 ​μ​L of PBS+ and measured on a Stratedigm S1300Exi Flow Cytometer.
Confocal Microscopy
60-72 hours after neutralization assay setup, each well in a serum dilution series within a
384-well plate was imaged using a FITC filter to detect cellular ZsGreen expression. Images
were acquired using a 20X air objective on a Zeiss LSM510 instrument. Acquired images were
analyzed using ImageJ to produce overlays.
Patient samples
Use of patient samples for the development and validation of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic
tests was approved by Partners Institutional Review Board (protocol 2020P000895). Serum
samples from 113 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (confirmed by at least one SARS-CoV-2
PCR-positive nasopharyngeal swab at Massachusetts General Hospital) were collected over
course of several weeks, resulting in partially longitudinal, cross-sectional cohort consisting of
165 serum samples, with a prospective follow-up period of at least 3 months to assess clinical
course and outcomes by manual chart review by at least two physicians. For each patient, the
following information was obtained: age, sex, SARS-CoV-2 PCR results, date of symptom
onset, hospitalization and discharge dates, intubation and extubation dates, and deceased date.
Date of symptom onset was defined as the earliest date that at least one of the following
COVID-19-related symptoms was reported as developing acutely and new from baseline: fever,
chills, loss of smell or taste, body aches, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sore throat, cough,
shortness of breath. If the date of symptom onset could not be determined with confidence, this
information was excluded from the analysis. Patients were assessed for the presence of
absence of the following pre-existing medical conditions: lung disease (e.g. asthma, COPD),
heart disease (e.g. coronary artery disease, heart failure), vascular disease (e.g. peripheral
vascular disease), hypertension, diabetes, obesity (BMI >30), kidney disease, autoimmune

disorder, solid organ cancer, chemotherapy for solid organ cancer, hematologic cancer,
chemotherapy or immunotherapy for hematologic cancer, history of organ transplant, history of
hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and pre-existing use of corticosteroids or other
immunosuppressive medications. Based on these information, the cohort was divided into the
following groups based on severity of disease and underlying health status: (​i)​ non-hospitalized,
consisting of individuals that were never admitted to the hospital and were sent home to
quarantine; (​ii​) hospitalized, which included individuals that were hospitalized for at least one
night but were never intubated and were eventually discharged; (​iii​) intubated, comprising

hospitalized individuals that were intubated for at least one day but survived and were
eventually discharged; (​iv​) deceased, for which we had obtained a specimen before they

eventually passed away in the hospital; and (​v)​ immunosuppressed, which consisted of people
that were on immunosuppressive medication (including high-dose corticosteroid) and/or were
afflicted by a clinically significant hematologic malignancy before being diagnosed with
COVID-19. ​Laboratory data throughout admission were analyzed, and the maximum
documented serum levels of ferritin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase,
troponin-T, and IL-6 were recorded for each patient, as well as the lowest absolute lymphocyte
count documented (lymphocyte count nadir). In addition, use of the following treatments were
documented:

corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, atorvastatin, remdesivir,

lopinavir/ritonavir, tocilizumab (part of treatment versus placebo trial, currently blinded), and
anakinra. All information obtained from medical records was verified by at least two physicians.
Pre-pandemic serum samples (​n = 1,257) were obtained from the clinicals laboratories
at Massachusetts General Hospital. These samples were comprised of an unbiased cohort of
individuals being tested for measles, mumps, and rubella titers (​n = 1124), as well as a selected
subset of 133 individuals with positive serology results for cytomegalovirus (​n = 10),
varicella-zoster virus (​n =

Statistical and data analyses
Statistical and data analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.4.3, JMP Pro
15.0.0 (SAS Institute), and R v4.0.2. Flow cytometry data was analyzed using FlowJo 10.6.2.
Non-parametric multivariate ANOVAs were performed on the indicated figures where several

Figure 1: Clinical severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is influenced by patient characteristics and coupled to clinical laboratory
data.
(A) A cross-sectional cohort of COVID-19 patients (n = 113) was divided into groups of varying clinical severity, i.e., non-hospitalized
(n = 18), hospitalized (n = 45), intubated (n = 27), deceased (n = 10), and immunosuppressed (n = 13) and analyzed for their age and
sex. Median age was 28 years in patients who were never hospitalized (n = 20; includes 2 from immunosuppressed group) and 63
years in all patients who were admitted to the hospital (n = 93), with statistical significance of p < 0.0001 with t test. Fisher's exact test
on the number of males who were intubated or deceased (n = 31 males out of 42 total; includes 5 from immunosuppressed group who
were intubated) versus not (n = 36 males out of 71 total) demonstrated a significant enrichment with p = 0.02.
(B-D) Peak levels of C-reactive protein and IL-6 as well as lymphocyte count nadir are presented in violin plots when data was
available. In C, none of the non-hospitalized patients had serum IL-6 levels measured (n.a., not assessed). For B and C, clinical
laboratory-defined cut-offs of the upper limit of normal are indicated with a dotted line; for D, the dotted line represents the lower limit
of normal. For each parameter, a non-parametric ANOVA was performed; statistical significance is indicated with the following
notations: **** p < 0.0001, *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01, and * p < 0.05.

Figure 2: Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain ELISA and high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus
neutralization assay reveal highly variable IgG, IgM, and IgA responses and neutralization potency after SARS-CoV-2
infection.
(A) For quantitation of anti-RBD IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies, a 7-point standard curve consisting of a SARS-CoV and -CoV-2 RBDbinding monoclonal antibody, CR3022, in all three isotypes (CR3022-IgG, CR3022-IgM, and CR3022-IgA) was used as a reference to
interpolate O.D. values from samples and calculate units/mL (U/mL), with 1 U/mL defined as the equivalent reactivity caused by 1
μg/mL of the corresponding CR3022 monoclonal antibody
(B) Anti-RBD IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies were measured in both pre-pandemic samples (n = 1,257) and COVID-19 patient samples
(n = 85). Dotted lines indicate the threshold of seropositivity that achieves >99.0% specificity on ROC analyses.
(C) ROC analyses for each assay were done to assess how seropositivity predicted COVID-19 status. Area under the curve (AUC)
was 0.94 for IgG, 0.92 for IgM, and 0.86 for IgA. Cut-offs of 1.18 U/mL for IgG achieved a sensitivity of 73%, 2.14 U/mL for IgM
achieved 66%, and 0.95 U/mL for IgA achieved 48%, with >99.0% specificity for all three.
(D) A schematic of the high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay is shown.
(E) Validation of the neutralization assay using a recently discovered neutralizing monoclonal antibody, B38, was performed and
showed an IC50 of 6 μg/mL.
(F) Neutralization titers that achieved 50% neutralization (NT50) were calculated for pre-pandemic samples (n = 1,220, individuals on
antiretroviral therapy excluded) and COVID-19 patient samples (n = 118).
(G) An ROC analysis demonstrated an AUC of 0.97, with an NT50 cut-off of 20 achieving sensitivity of 94% and specificity of >99.0%.

Figure 3: SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and neutralization potency predict clinical severity and survival.
(A-C) Anti-RBD IgG, IgM, and IgA levels were plotted over days after symptom onset for confirmed COVID-19 cases for which data of
symptom onset was known (n = 98 patients, n = 147 samples total). Healthy blood donors (n = 37) are included as a negative control
within the gray region. The dotted lines indicate the cut-offs for anti-RBD IgG, IgM, and IgA seropositivity.
(D) Titers that achieve 50% neutralization (NT50) were plotted over days after symptom onset for each patient sample.
(E-H) Patient samples were selected for collection between 14 and 42 days after symptom onset (earliest time point for each patient),
and for each cohort of healthy blood donors, non-hospitalized, hospitalized, intubated, deceased, and immunosuppressed patients,
anti-RBD IgG, IgM, IgA, and neutralization (NT50) was plotted. Non-parametric multivariate ANOVA was performed for each
(excluding healthy blood donors); statistical significance is indicated as follows: **** p < 0.0001, *** p < 0.001, ** p < 0.01, and * p <
0.05.
(I-J) An ROC and log-log regression analyses were performed on IgG versus neutralization. For J, the severity cohort is indicated as
follows: healthy (white), non-hospitalized (green), hospitalized (yellow), intubated (red), deceased (gray), and immunosuppressed
(blue). For J, Pearson correlations were performed and R2 and p values are indicated.
(K) A residual plot for neutralization titer was generated from the log-log correlation. The gray ellipse indicates a cluster of samples
from intubated (red) and deceased (gray) patients.
(L) Neutralization potency index (NT50/IgG) was calculated for all 113 patients (at earliest time point) and plotted by cohort. A nonparametric multivariate ANOVA was performed without correction for multiple comparisons; unadjusted p values are indicated as
follows: ** p < 0.01, * p < 0.05.
(M) Survival analysis of COVID-19 patients classified as having a high (≥100) (n = 35) or low (<100) (n = 76) neutralization potency
index (NT50/IgG) was performed using Kaplan-Meier method and revealed significantly decreased risk of death in low neutralization
potency individuals (p = 0.03).

Figure 4: Corticosteroid and tocilizumab therapy decrease humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2.
(A) Principle components analysis was performed using the following variables: age, sex language, pre-existing medical conditions,
treatments received, clinical laboratory data (ferritin, CRP, D-dimer, LDH, troponin-T, and lymphocyte nadir), anti-RBD antibody levels,
and neutralization titers. The severity cohort of each patient is indicated by color. Patients with missing data were excluded.
(B) Loading of principle components (PC) is shown. Hatched bars indicate negative loading.
(C) Sub-analyses on COVID-19 patients that were in the hospital for at least 3 days to (n = 69) were performed on the last collected
specimen to show the effect of azithromycin (n = 10 treated), remdesivir (n = 9 treated), hydroxychloroquine (n = 8 treated),
corticosteroids (n = 9 treated), and tocilizumab (n = treated as part of a trial with 2:1 randomization to placebo) on anti-RBD IgG levels
(upper panel), neutralization titer (middle panel), and neutralization potency index (NT50/IgG) (lower panel). A t test was performed for
each comparison; * indicates unadjusted p < 0.05.

Figure 5: SARS-CoV-2-infected patient sera cross-neutralizes both wild-type and D614G mutant SARS-CoV-2 spike but not
the highly homologous pre-emergent bat coronavirus WIV1-CoV.
(A) A schematic of the SARS-CoV-2 and WIV1-CoV spike proteins, including full-length, truncated (Δ18), and mutant (D614G) forms
is shown. Full-length WIV1-CoV spike has 77.5% sequence homology to SARS-CoV-2 spike and has the same putative ER retention
signal (ERRS) as SARS-CoV-2.
(B) Expression of full-length, Δ18, and Δ18 D614G SARS-CoV-2 spike constructs in 293T cells in comparison to empty vector (neg.
ctrl) was measured by flow cytometry (upper panel). Infectivity of lentivirus, which was defined as the infectious units divided by the
quantity of p24 in lentiviral supernatant, was also measured and compared to VSV-G-pseudotyped lentivirus (lower panel).
(C-D) Cross-neutralization of serum samples from COVID-19 patients that were non-hospitalized (green, n = 16), hospitalized (yellow,
n = 67), intubated (red, n = 43), deceased (gray, n = 15), or immunosuppressed (blue, n = 21) and healthy blood donors (n = 35) was
measured for wild-type versus D614G mutant SARS-CoV-2 Δ18 spike pseudovirus. For C, Pearson correlations were performed and
R2 and p values are indicated; for D, paired, non-parametric t test was performed; *** indicates p < 0.001.
(E) Similar to B, expression and infectivity of full length and Δ18 WIV1-CoV spike was measured.
(F-G) Similar to C-D, cross-neutralization of serum samples from COVID-19 patients was measured for wild-type SARS-CoV-2 versus
WIV1-CoV pseudovirus. For F, Pearson correlations were performed and R2 and p values are indicated; for G, paired, non-parametric
t test was performed; **** indicates p < 0.0001.
