Abstract
Current research has shown that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via airborne particles. These particles are generated when infected persons exhale and they spread throughout the room, resulting in a high concentration and thus a high risk of infection of non-infected persons. One
way to reduce the concentration of particles is to filter them using mobile room air cleaners,
which can be easily set up and reduce the concentration of viruses or keep them at a low level.
Since many studies are conducted in generic rooms, the question of the cleaning performance
of such room air cleaners in real rooms arises. In order to investigate this, measurements of
the effectiveness were carried out in a total of 4 different rooms of the "Obermenzinger Gymnasium" (Obermenzinger high school) in Munich. It can be shown that good effects of the room
air cleaners are achieved even under realistic conditions. Even Plexiglas screens, which serve
as protection against direct infection, have no negative influence.

1. Introduction
For many months, there has been a very controversial public debate on whether or not the
protective walls and mobile air cleaners that have long been established in the adult world
should also be installed in school classrooms as proposed in [1]. The German Physical Society
recently clarified in an open letter that only mechanical ventilation can provide a high level of
safety against indirect SARS-CoV-2 infection [2]. It has also pointed out the importance of protective walls to reduce direct infections and urged their installation in schools [3, 4]. The Harvard
T.H. Chan School of Public Health [5] and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
[6] are recommending mobile air cleaners and transparent protection walls to enhance the infection protection in schools. Transparent protective walls are already ubiquitous in many private sector work areas, as well as in public facilities and government offices, and many state
parliaments and courtrooms. Mobile air cleaners with H13 / H14 class filters, which filter at least
6 times the room volume per hour, are used in many areas where adequate virus reduction
cannot be achieved by heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. In classrooms,
on the other hand, the widespread introduction of these protective measures is prevented by
those in power with changing arguments, with reference to the handout "L√ºften an Schulen"
(Ventilation in Schools) from the Federal Environment Agency (UBA) [7]. The background to
this tactic can only be guessed, see https://www.news4teachers.de/2021/02/der-luftfilter-skandal-wie-bundesbildungsministerium-und-umweltbundesamt-den-einsatz-der-geraete-in-schulen-schlechtreden-und-was-dahintersteckt/.
The UBA only recommends opening all existing windows in the classrooms for 3‚Äí5 minutes
widely every 20 minutes and for the entire length of the break. According to the UBA, the goal

of the measure is to completely exchange the air 3 times per hour [7]. It has never been scientifically proven that this ventilation method really achieves the goal. There is also no evidence
to what extent the UBA concept prevents infections in classrooms at all, because ventilation at
best reduces the indirect risk of infection caused by a high viral load in the room. The much
more dangerous direct risk of infection, which always exists when people are close together
and the exhaled viral load can be inhaled directly by a neighboring person, as in the checkout
room, cannot be prevented at all by ventilation. Why 3 air changes per hour should be sufficient
is also not scientifically justified. It is claimed that 3 air changes with window ventilation should
be equivalent to a 6-fold filtration of the room air. But this is wrong, because in both cases the
reduction of viruses is based on mixed ventilation. Only if the cross ventilation is used, there
would be a difference, because then the displacement ventilation prevails [8, 9]. But cross ventilation can only be achieved if a room has windows on both sides, which is very rarely the case.
Opening a door is often considered as cross-ventilation, but this is wrong. According to the
state of the art of ventilation technology, doors should not be opened either, because then the
pollutants can get into other parts of the building in an uncontrolled way [8]. Due to the hazardous nature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, air exchange rates of at least 6 or even 8 are required by
other scientists [9, 10]. But also leading international institutions recommend air exchange rates
larger 3 such as the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health [5] and the CDC in the USA
[6].
It is useful to be clear about what the UBA ventilation concept means. If a school lesson of 45
minutes duration is considered and it is assumed that ventilation takes place for 3‚Äí5 minutes
after 20 minutes, this means that no ventilation takes place for almost 90% of the school lesson
and thus the virus load in the room increases if one or more infected persons are in the room.
How well the decrease in viral load occurs during intermittent ventilation depends on the number and size of windows, the temperature difference between indoors and outdoors, and the
wind conditions outside the building [8, 9, 11]. Figure 1 illustrates the relationships. If there is
no ventilation for more than one school hour, the viral load in the room increases linearly with
time (red line). The increase in virus concentration, i.e. the number of viruses per cubic meter,
depends on the strength of the source, i.e. the number of viruses released per unit time
(ùëÅùëÅùë†ùë†ource ). In addition, the increase in virus concentration depends on the room size ùëâùëâroom . The
larger the space, the longer it takes to reach a certain virus load. Mathematically, this can be
expressed by the following equation:
viral load =

ùëÅùëÅsource
√ó ùë°ùë°
ùëâùëâroom

The number of viruses inhaled during the school day is important with regard to the probability
of infection. This results from the integral over the respiratory flow rate multiplied by the viral
load over the period under consideration. If the respiratory flow rate is assumed to be constant,
this is equal to the respiratory flow rate multiplied by the mean viral load over the period under
consideration. The red dashed line illustrates the mean value resulting from the corresponding
curve.
If we now assume that after 20 minutes all windows in the classroom are opened for 3‚Äí5
minutes and all viruses leave the room through the window during this time, then the curve
shown in blue (solid line) results. I.e. after the ventilation process the virus load increases again.
The virus load over time can be reduced by a maximum of 50% in this way (blue dashed line).
In practice, however, it will not be possible to remove all viruses from the room within 3‚Äí5
minutes [8, 9, 11]. As a rule, the decrease in virus concentration will be significantly less, as
shown by the purple lines. This is partly due to the fact that not all windows are opened or are
opened for too short a time, otherwise it becomes too cold in the room. Even if many windows

are opened for a long period of time, temperature and wind conditions will often not allow 100%
air exchange [8, 11]. The actual average viral load with shock ventilation will therefore always
be between 50% and 100% of the reference case without ventilation.
The advantage of the technical separation of viruses with the help of mobile air cleaners is that
with this method a continuous removal of the viruses from the room air takes place [13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19]. Furthermore, the separation of viruses is independent of whether people can
or want to ventilate, and the number and size of windows and the temperature and wind conditions do not play a role either. Therefore, with appropriate airflow, the virus load can be maintained at a constant low level in the presence of sources, as illustrated by the green line in
Figure 1.

It is often claimed that a major disadvantage of mobile air purifiers is their inability to remove
CO2 from the room. Apart from the fact that there are mobile devices that can do this [15], the
question arises as to why a device that is supposed to protect against potentially deadly viruses
is required to also create a harmless gas from the room at the same time. Free ventilation is
also not able to keep the temperature in the room on an acceptable level during winter time or
to save energy and keep the children and youth from freezing in the room. It is also not expected
from window ventilation to not interrupt lessons, or to ensure that fine dust, pollen and noise
does not enter the room through the open windows.
The intensive debate in the media about the correct ventilation concept in schools has led to
the assumption that a sufficiently rapid removal of the viruses from the room air is sufficient to
ensure safety from a SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it must be taken into account that free
ventilation via windows, HVAC systems and mobile air cleaners can only reduce the indirect
risk of infection, i.e. infection due to the high viral load in the room. Ventilation of any kind
cannot protect against the direct risk of infection, i.e. the direct uptake of viruses due to short
distances to infected persons or insufficient protection by a particle-filtering FFP2/FFP3 mask
[20] or protective walls. Since sufficient spacing in classrooms is often not feasible (with the
possible exception of rotating classes) and FFP2/FFP3 masks should not be worn permanently,
a study was conducted to determine whether transparent protective walls with a surrounding
edge impair the filtering effect in classrooms [1]. The result of the study clarifies that the removal

of aerosol particles from the room air does not depend on whether the room is equipped with
tables and chairs, additional people with bags and laptops, and protective walls between people. This is physically understandable, since window ventilation and the use of mobile air cleaners is based on mixed ventilation. That is, the natural flow movements in the room, caused by
the movement, breathing and heat emission of people, temperature differences in the different
areas of the room and flow movements due to open windows or mobile air cleaners, provide
constant mixing of air masses [8, 11]. For this reason, all areas of the room are also quite
evenly cleared of the viral load, regardless of where the windows or mobile air cleaners are
positioned [13, 17]. The greater the mixing, the better the cleaning performance in distant areas.
Therefore, any concerns that people walking around may reduce filter performance are physically incorrect. It is also false that protective walls between seat neighbors at a table would
affect classroom ventilation, as insinuated in [21]. These insinuations are based on a misconception of mixed ventilation and unvalidated simulation results that cannot correctly reproduce
such situations [13, 17, 22].
The protection concept presented and experimentally validated in [1] is increasingly being established in schools and there are now entire regions and cities in Germany that rely on this
protection concept to protect children and young people. With regard to the Swiss cheese
model of the pandemic [23], this implementation of the protection concept is to be considered
very useful, as it represents an effective building block for the prevention of infections. Especially with regard to future virus variants whose spread is more difficult to control due to mutations, the use of further protective measures is imperative to prevent an exponential growth of
infection numbers. Therefore, it is no wonder that the German Association of Physics [2, 3], the
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health [5] and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
[6] are recommending mobile air cleaners and transparent protection walls to enhance the infection protection in schools. The question is often asked how effective the protection concept
presented in [1] is in different rooms of a school. To answer this question, experiments were
conducted in the Obermenzing high school (Obermenzinger Gymnasium). In total, four rooms
with different geometry were analyzed. In the following, the experiments and the results are
presented and discussed.

2. Measurement setup and data analysis
Since the effectiveness of the protection concept in normal classrooms with a rectangular floor
plan and typical table arrangement has already been proven [1], a computer room with Ushaped table placement against the wall (room A), a teachers' room with distributed tables
(room B), a classroom with a gable roof (room C) and a canteen with an attached kitchen (room
D) were analyzed in this study. Figures 2‚Äí5 schematically show the top view of the rooms with
the room equipment and the position of the measuring device and the room air cleaner. The
distance between the measuring device and the room air cleaner was chosen as large as possible in all cases in order to analyze the most unfavorable conditions in each case.
For the determination of the cleaning efficiency, artificially generated aerosol particles of DEHS
(average diameter approx. 0.4 ¬µm) were introduced into the respective room and homogeneously distributed before the start of the measurement. The size of these particles is in the range
of aerosol particles emitted by infected humans and contaminated with viruses [24, 25, 26].
The particles follow the flow in the room almost ideally and do not exhibit any noticeable evaporation during the period under consideration. The filtering of the aerosol particles was realized
with a TROTEC TAC V+. The volume flow rate was set in such a way that at least a theoretical
air exchange rate of ùëòùëòtheo > 6 was obtained (ùëòùëòtheo = 8 in room A; ùëòùëòtheo = 7.5 in room B; ùëòùëòtheo =
7 in room C; ùëòùëòtheo = 8.7 in room D). The theoretical air exchange rate results from the ratio of

3. Measurement results
The measured, normalized particle concentrations over time are shown in Figure 6. Before
each measurement with the air cleaner running, reference measurements were first carried out
with the air cleaner switched off. This is necessary to determine how many aerosol particles
leave the room through leaks or settle on the walls. The respective course shows that rooms A
‚Äí C are altogether quite dense. Room D, on the other hand, already shows quite a large decrease in aerosol particles without an air purifier. This decrease is caused by the operation of
exhaust air systems in the kitchen and an open door in the dining area to the hallway. This
configuration was chosen for the measurement because it corresponds exactly to the configuration that exists in real school operation. When the air cleaner is operated, there is a fairly
rapid decrease in the aerosol particle concentration in all rooms. So when these systems exist
or HVAC systems, they should be used. However, it should be ensured that the removed air is
replaced by fresh air from outside and not by contaminated air from other rooms or floors.

or air exchange rate. With the aid of k, the development of the particle concentration c over
time can be determined, provided that the room volume V [m¬≥] and the strength S [particles/h]
of the source of contamination are known. The steady-state concentration ùëêùëêsteady, that occurs
after a long time as indicated in figure 1 can be calculated as follows:

ùëêùëêsteady =

ùëÜùëÜ

(1)

ùëòùëò‚ãÖùëâùëâ

The higher k is, the faster potentially hazardous aerosol particles are removed, or the lower the
concentration will be after a longer period of time. The decay rates determined for the different
rooms are shown in Table 1.

It can be seen that for rooms A and C there is good agreement between the measured air
exchange rate and the theoretical air exchange rate. In room A, the measuring sensor was
located in the diagonally opposite corner of the room directly between two transparent protective walls. Even in this unfavorable position, the measured filter efficiency agrees well with the
theoretical value. Therefore, it is shown that the transparent protective walls with surrounding
edges have no negative effect on the filter performance, as claimed in [21] without any reliable
evidence. This also means that window ventilation in combination with the transparent protective walls is not negatively affected. Physically, the result is clear, since in both cases it is a
mixed ventilation, as already stated at the beginning. In room B, k was lower than ùëòùëòtheo . The
reason for this is an open door to the corridor. This result shows that the entire room volume
must always be taken into account when determining the correct volume flow. This means that
if adjacent rooms are not separated by closed doors, then the volume of the adjacent room
must be taken into account when setting the volume flow, since the room air in the adjacent
room is also captured by the filter unit. From this corridor, the entrance door leads directly to
the outside. This door was kept closed for the measurements, but in practical operation it is
frequently opened and another door in the corridor is not always closed in real operation as in
the tests carried out here. This results in additional ventilation in real operation, which increases
k further. The result in room D shows that, in addition to the air cleaner, other ventilation
measures can be used to accelerate the reduction of the viral load in a room if necessary.
However, the increase in the k-value during operation of the room air purifier is not as large as
theoretically expected. Presumably, this is due to the fact that the already high k-values combined with the flow through the room reduce the efficiency of the mixed ventilation. This is a
typical phenomena that applies to window ventilation as well as mobile filter systems and other

ventilation systems based on mixed ventilation [9, 15]. Nevertheless, even in this case the
cleaning is supported and thus it is possible to supplement an ineffective window ventilation or
too weak HVAC system with the help of mobile room air cleaners or to replace the window
ventilation completely with a technical solution.

4. Conclusion
The results of the tests show that good filter performance can be achieved with mobile air
cleaners in very different room situations. The placement of tables and chairs, computers and
transparent protective walls in the room has no adverse effect on filter performance. Therefore,
it is possible to reduce both the indirect infection risk in rooms with the mobile air purifiers and
at the same time the much more dangerous direct infection risk by means of transparent protective walls with a surrounding edge. In order to counteract an increase in CO2 concentration
in the room, the windows can be opened from time to time as in the past. This does not hinder
the filter effect and the transparent protective walls also have no negative effect on CO2 exchange, as the mixed ventilation is always effective. Alternatively, room air cleaners can be
used that filter the room air in recirculation mode and simultaneously feed outside air into the
room via a bypass. In this way, the virus and CO2 problem can be solved technically at the
same time, without having to constantly interrupt classes for ventilation. An important result of
the study is also that inefficient ventilation through windows, doors or exhaust air systems can
always be improved by mobile room air cleaners. However, powerful room air cleaners are able
to keep the virus load in a room at a low level, or to quickly reduce a high virus load, even
without window ventilation, because, in contrast to intermittent ventilation, they continuously
ensure a reduction in the virus load and because the filter performance is completely independent of whether there are sufficient windows in the rooms, people are willing to ventilate, or the
temperature and wind conditions can physically enable an air exchange at all. Therefore, regardless of the number and size of windows, people's willingness or ability to ventilate, and
physics, powerful mobile air purifiers with H13 or H14 class filters ensure consistent separation
of the virus load in the room. It is therefore completely incomprehensible why the Federal Environment Agency is fighting the implementation of the scientifically proven protection concept.
It is certainly not one of the tasks of the Federal Environment Agency to prevent effective protection concepts. They should accept the basics of fluid physics and follow the recommendations of institutions such as the DPG or CDC to protect children in schools during the pandemic
and after.
