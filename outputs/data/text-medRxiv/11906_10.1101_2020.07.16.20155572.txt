ABSTRACT
Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 leading to COVID-19 occurs through exhaled respiratory
droplets from infected humans. Currently, however, there is much controversy over whether
respiratory aerosol microdroplets play an important role as a route of transmission. By
measuring and modeling the dynamics of exhaled respiratory droplets we can assess the relative
contribution of aerosols in the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. We measure size distribution, total
numbers and volumes of respiratory droplets, including aerosols, by speaking and coughing
from healthy subjects. Dynamic modelling of exhaled respiratory droplets allows to account
for aerosol persistence times in confined public spaces. The probability of infection by
inhalation of aerosols when breathing in the same space can then be estimated using current
estimates of viral load and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. In line with the current known
reproduction numbers, our study of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that aerosol
transmission is an inefficient route, in particular from non or mildly symptomatic individuals.

Introduction
Respiratory droplets form the most important carrier of SARS-CoV-2 virions, and may infect
humans by direct inhalation or indirectly through hand or object contact. During the current
COVID-19 pandemic, numerous explosive local outbreaks, so called super-spreading events,
in public spaces or health care settings have raised the concern of aerosol transmission of SARSCoV-2. Aerosols, or microdroplets, are formed and exhaled during loud speaking, singing,
sneezing and coughing. As infected persons (initially) may have none or mild symptoms, an
aerosol transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 may have tremendous impact on health care
strategies to prevent the spreading of COVID-19 in public spaces. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2
viral particles have been detected in microdroplets which may spread in exhaled air during
breathing, talking, singing, sneezing, or coughing by an infected individual.1-3 Microdroplets
form aerosol clouds, which have a relatively long airborne time,4 and may thus pose an
important threat to community spread of COVID-19. However, to what extent microdroplets in
practice result in infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, remains a topic of intense debate.5-9
Next to virus and host factors, this type of viral transmission through aerosols depends strongly
on droplet properties and behavior.10,11 In order to aid the development of effective preventive
strategies for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, in this study we measure and model respiratory
droplet physics to predict the importance of community SARS-CoV-2 transmission by the
aerosol route.
Results and discussion
We measure size distributions of droplets in aerosols released when speaking or coughing using
laser diffraction (Malvern Spraytech®), and consistently find a double-peaked drop size
distribution for coughing, and a single-peak drop size distribution for speech, which can be
described by a distribution corresponding to a normal liquid spraying process,11 as shown in
Figure 1. A previous study,2 showed that age, sex, weight, height, or corporal mass have no
statistically significant effect on the aerosol composition in terms of size and number of
droplets. We tested 7 healthy volunteers (5 male, 2 female), and found that the variability in
drop production by coughing between the different emitters was relatively small, except for one
person, who produced 17 times more liquid volume than the others. It has been suggested that
if such a person would be infected with SARS-CoV-2, he or she could become a so-called

Figure 1 - Measured drop size distributions of droplets produced when coughing (circles) and
speaking (squares). Solid lines are fits with Gamma distributions.11
Using a precision balance, the volumes of saliva/mucus produced by the high emitter when
coughing or speaking into a small plastic bag were measured by weighing before and after a
single cough or saying “Stay Healthy” for 10 times.12 Averaging over 20 experiments, we find
that a single cough yields a liquid weight of 0.07 ± 0.05 gram, whereas speaking ten times
produces a weight of 0.003 ± 0.001 gram.
For coughing, the volumetric distribution measured using laser diffraction shows that on
average 98 ± 1% of the volume of the spray is contained in the large drops (100-1000 µm). For
the small aerosol droplets, this amounts to ~20 million microdroplets produced in a single cough
and ~7 million for speech. For COVID-19, thus from symptomatic patients, viral RNA load in
undiluted oral fluid or sputum has been found to be 104 - 106 copies per milliliter.13-16 Although
temporal changes in viral load may be correlated to COVID-19 severity, with very high viral
loads up to ~1011 copies per milliliter,14 this dynamic association so far has not been definitely
established. As such, following the Ref.13 to avoid underestimation, we used a number of 7×106

copies per milliliter in respiratory samples in our primary analysis. The total number of virus
particles present in the total volume of only the microdroplets is then 104, implying that only 1
in 2000 aerosol droplets contains a virus particle.
The persistence of these aerosol droplets in the air is of the greatest concern regarding
community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in public spaces. This airborne time is governed by
evaporation and gravity-driven sedimentation towards the floor. The latter can be explained by
balancing the forces of gravity (F=mg) and air drag (F=6πηRU, with η the air viscosity, R the
droplet radius, and U the falling velocity), from which it follows that a typical small droplet
will take nine minutes to reach the ground. This time will even increase by the evaporation of
the liquid phase of the droplet. Sputum droplets are known to consist for 1-10% of their volume
of solid solutes.17 Consequently, they will not evaporate completely but leave a ‘solid’ core
residue. For microdroplets smaller than 10 µm, the contraction to the solid core having half of
the original droplet size (i.e., ~10% of the initial volume) happens within a second in quiescent
air with a relative humidity of 50%,17 and a droplet half the size stays airborne four times longer.
A laser light sheet was used to track microdroplets similar to those produced by coughing and
speaking. To mimic small respiratory droplets, we used a mixture of 1% glycerol and 99%
ethanol; within a second, the ethanol evaporates, yielding small non-evaporating droplets of
glycerol with a median mass aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of 5 ± 3 µm, similar to the
microdroplets produced by for coughing or speaking. The number of drops passing through the
laser sheet suspended in the center of our 2×2×2 m3 experimental chamber was analyzed using
an algorithm that detects the illuminations caused by the droplets. Typical results are shown in
Figure 2 and capture the reduction in number of droplets over time due to coupled effects of
sedimentation, horizontal displacement, and evaporation.

Figure 2 – Laser-illuminated aerosol droplets at different times after initial spraying. Initially
(a), droplets have a maximum sedimentation velocity of about 2 cm/sec, corresponding to
droplets of about 25 µm in diameter. In the 16 min frame (d), the fastest moving droplet has a
sedimentation velocity of at most 1 mm/sec, corresponding to a droplet of about 4-5 µm in
diameter.
If these aerosol droplets are a vector of transmission for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, how the
number of droplets decreases as a function of time will have a significant influence on the
potential airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. To predict the evolution in number of
microdroplets, the evaporation and sedimentation can be accounted for to calculate the number
of airborne aerosol particles (see the Supplementary Materials for details of the calculation).
Figure 3 compares our predictions for droplet persistence results with our own results and those
reported by others.3 It shows that the model accurately captures the exponential decline in the
number of droplets over time for both experiments and suggests the decline is, to a small extent,
influenced by the evaporation of the droplets (i.e., the relative humidity of the environment) but
dominated by the sedimentation. Additionally, from Figure 3, it can be concluded that the time
to half the original number of droplets in the system (i.e., the half-life) is between 5.5 and 7
min.

(blue circles) compared to the data of Ref.3 (green circles). Solid lines are model fits for both
sets of data, with input parameters relative humidity (RH) and sedimentation height (hsys).
This then allows us to estimate how many virus particles one would inhale while inside a room
where an infected person coughed a single time. The highest probability of infection occurs
when a person enters a poorly ventilated and small space where a high emitter has just coughed,
and inhales virus-carrying droplets. We model coughing in our 2×2×2 m3 unventilated space
that .could represent e.g. a restroom. The drop production by coughing was found to be very
similar for 6 out of the 7 emitters. We find peak values of 1.18 ± 0.09 × 103 pixels that light up
in the field of view of our laser sheet (21×31 cm2). This directly corresponds to the volume of
emitted droplets3 ; the high emitter produced 1.68 ± 0.20 × 104 lit up pixels, more than an order
of magnitude larger. Based on these numbers and the earlier measured volume and drop size,
we can calculate the amount of virus inhaled by a person entering and staying in the same room
where an infected person produced the droplets, as a function of entrance delay and residence
time. As detailed above, the calculation assumes a viral load of 7 × 106 copies per milliliter of
saliva.13 We also assume a single inhalation volume of 0.0005 m3 (tidal volume 6 ml per kg
body weight for an adult man) and a normal respiratory rate of ~16 inhalations/min.18 In Figure
4, we compare the results for the high emitter with those for a regular (low) emitter on the basis
of the amount of light scattered from droplets produced by a single cough.

Figure 4 – Instantaneous pictures of the droplets produced by coughs of a high (a) and a normal
emitter (b) as detected with laser sheet imaging. The cough volumes allow us to estimate the
number of inhaled virus particles as a function of (i) the delay between the cough and a healthy
person entering the room, and (ii) the time the healthy person spends in the room (c,d).
The number of virus particles needed to infect a single individual, Ninf, needs to be taken into
account to translate these findings into risk of infection. This obviously also depends on factors
such as the vulnerability / susceptibility of the host, yet as detailed in Ref.19, the respiratory
infectivity for SARS-CoV-2 is not yet well known. In the absence of data on SARS-CoV-2, the
most reasonable assumption is that the critical number of virus particles to cause infection is
comparable to that for other Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1, and influenza virus. In
that case, Ninf ~100-1000, which corresponds to ~10-100 PFU.19-21. If we adopt a conservative
approach and assume the upper limit of this range (Ninf ~100), we find that our unventilated
2×2×2 m3 space contaminated by a single cough is safe for residing times of less than 12
minutes due to the low virus content of the aerosol particles. Additionally, the maximal number
of inhaled viral copies by a person entering the room after the high emitter has coughed is ~120
± 60, where the error margin comes from variation in relative volume of small and large drops
produced by a cough. If the infected person is a regular emitter, the probability of infecting the

next visitor of the confined space by means of a single cough for any delay or residence time is
therefore very low. For speech, due to the low volumes emitted, this probability is even smaller.
Our small non-ventilated room is also a ‘worst-case’: in better ventilated, large rooms, the
aerosols become diluted very rapidly.4
Conclusion
Our dynamic modelling of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in confined spaces shows that aerosol
transmission seems an inefficient route, in particular from non or mildly symptomatic
individuals. The large droplets that are believed to be responsible for direct and nosocomial
infections may contain about 500 virus particles per droplet and are thus likely the most
important route in a mixed transmission model.
A limitation to our study is that we cannot easily take changes in virus viability inside
microdroplets into account, which depend on the local microenvironment of the aerosol gas
clouds as produced under different circumstances.22 However, viable SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols
can be found after several hours,23 and as such this limitation will not likely affect our main
conclusion. Importantly, our results do not completely rule out aerosol transmission. It is likely
that large numbers of aerosol drops, produced by continuous coughing, speaking, singing, or
by certain types of aerosol-generating medical interventions, can still result in transmission, in
particular in spaces with poor ventilation.4 Our model explains the rather low reproduction
number of SARS-CoV-2 in environments where social distancing is practiced compared to the
reproduction numbers of other “true” airborne pathogens.10, 24, 25
Materials and methods
Size distributions of droplets from aerosols released when speaking or coughing were measured
using laser diffraction

employing a Malvern Spraytech® with a 300mm lens. In this

configuration drop sizes between 0.2 µm and 2mm can be measured. Speaking and coughing
is done directly into the laser beam and data acquisition is done in the ‘fast acquisition’ mode
so that there is no dead time and the drop size distribution is measured before evaporation.
