Abstract:
Patients with COVID-19 frequently manifest coagulation abnormalities and
thrombotic events. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to explore the role of coagulopathy
on the severity differences in patients with COVID-19. We conducted systematic
literature search via Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, WanFang Database, CNKI, and
medRxiv from December 1, 2019 to May 1, 2020, to identify all original studies that
reports on coagulation parameters (D-dimer, PLT, PT, APTT, and FIB) during
COVID-19 infection. Thereafter, we compared the coagulation parameters between
less severe and more severe cases. All Statistical analyses were performed via
Stata14.0 software. A total of 3,952 confirmed COVID-19 infected patients were
included from 25 studies. Patients with severe COVID-19 infection exhibited
significantly higher levels of D-dimer, PT, and FIB (SMD 0.83, 95% CI: 0.70-0.97, I2
56.9%; SMD 0.39, 95% CI: 0.14-0.64, I2 77.9%; SMD 0.35, 95% CI: 0.17-0.53, I2
42.4% respectively). However, difference in PLT and APTT levels between less
severe and more severe patients was not statistically significant (SMD-0.26, 95% CI:
-0.56-0.05, I2 82.2%; SMD-0.14,95% CI: -0.45-0.18, I2 75.5% respectively) This
meta-analysis revealed coagulopathy is associated with the severity of COVID-19.
Notably, D-dimer, PT, and FIB are the dominant parameters that should be considered
in evaluating coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients.

Introduction
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral respiratory infection caused by the
2019 novel coronavirus. A total of 5,061,476 confirmed cases with 331,475 deaths
have been reported globally since its outbreak on May 22, 2020 [1]. Thus, the World
Health Organization declared the disease a global pandemic. COVID-19 is the third
most lethal zoonotic coronavirus disease after SARS and MERS that occurred in the
last two decades [2], it has however caused many deaths than SARS or MERS [3].
Due to the extremely high mortality rate of COVID-19, there is an urgent need to
identify clinical features associated with its progression.
Notably, coagulopathy and thrombotic events are prominent in some COVID-19
patients. Following the previous researches in China, highly prevalent coagulopathy
characterized by elevated PT, APTT, and D-dimer was reported [4]. Besides, several
studies reported that elevated D-dimer levels were highly associated with in-hospital
mortality [5, 6]. Other than lung injuries, recent autopsy reports from the United
States confirmed that severe COVID-19 patients exhibit a hypercoagulable state
evidenced by thrombotic events in the lung, kidney, and possibly in the heart and
other organs [7]. However, whether coagulopathy is associated with the severity of
COVID-19 and the features of coagulation dysfunction remains unclear. Therefore,
we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis by incorporating both English
and Chinese published literature to explore the coagulation dysfunction on the
severity of COVID-19 progression.
Results
Research selection and quality assessment
The detailed literature search steps are highlighted in the flow diagram (Figure 1). We
identified 1,967 records using different search strategies in the six databases. After
eliminating the duplicate records, 1,132 articles were obtained. Besides, an additional
776 articles were excluded because they were not original studies or irrelevant to our
meta-analysis. Full texts of the remaining 356 articles were assessed for eligibility, out

of which 322 were eliminated for meeting the exclusion criteria. A total of 34 articles
were included in the quality evaluation from which 9 were excluded due to low
quality (NOS<5). Eventually, we included 25 articles (1 in Chinese and 24 in English)
for analyses [9-33]. The overall quality of available literature was moderate or high
with NOS scores ranging from 5-7. The quality evaluation of the 34 articles is shown
in Supplementary Table 2.
Characteristics of the included studies
A total of 3,952 patients in the 25 included studies provided data describing
coagulation parameters in the less severe and more severe groups. Notably, 23 studies
had been conducted in China (11 from Wuhan and 12 from other cities), 1 from
Mexico, and 1 from the USA. All the studies were retrospective observational studies
and sample size varied from 21 to 577. The median age ranged between 46 and 60
years and the proportion of male patients ranged between 35.3% and 81.0%. Twenty
studies followed clinical guidelines (including trial version 4, trial version 5, trial
version 7, 6th edition guidelines, 7th edition guidelines, and WHO interim guideline) to
judge on the disease severity. However, two studies considered whether patients
experienced ARDS, and one study considered whether patients experienced ICU care
to judge the severity of the disease. The patient characteristics and demographic data
for the included studies are shown in Table 1.
Coagulation parameters in less severe and more severe patients
The D-dimer, PLT, PT, APTT, and FIB were available in 25, 13, 13, 9, and 5studies
respectively. We use the random-effects model due to significant heterogeneity of
studies on D-dimer, PLT, PT, and APTT. Notably, D-dimer and PT were significantly
higher in more severe patients than in less severe patients (SMD 0.83, 95% CI:
0.70-0.97, I2 56.9%; SMD 0.39, 95% CI: 0.14-0.64, I2 77.9% respectively). The
fixed-effects model was used due to the insignificant heterogeneity of studies on FIB.
The result showed that patients with more severe pneumonia exhibited significantly
higher FIB compared to less severe patients (SMD 0.35,95% CI: 0.17-0.53, I2 42.4%).

However, no significant difference was observed in PLT and APTT values between
severe and mild patients (SMD -0.26, 95% CI: -0.56-0.05, I2 82.2%; SMD -0.14, 95%
CI:-0.45-0.18, I2 75.5% respectively). A forest plot of the coagulation parameters is
shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Details of the meta-analysis are highlighted in Table
2.
Subgroup analysis
Further, we conducted a subgroup analysis based on location, severity criteria, and
age (the median value above and below 50) to determine the sources of heterogeneity.
The results for subgroup analysis are presented in Table 3. Notably, the heterogeneity
was significant in the subgroup analyses. However, our subgroup analyses did not
explain the observed heterogeneity of studies on D-dimer, PLT, PT, and APTT.
Sensitivity analysis and publication bias
Herein, sensitivity analysis showed that the pooled results were not sensitive to any
individual study, this confirmed the robustness of the study findings. Detailed results
of sensitivity analysis are shown in Supplementary Figure 1. Also, we assessed
publication bias using the funnel plots and Egger’s regression test. There was no
significant publication bias among the levels of APTT, D-dimer, FIB, PLT, PT in our
study (Egger test: P=0.236, P=0.556, P=0.289, P=0.308, P=0.534 respectively). The
funnel diagram and Egger’s test are described in Figure 4.
Discussion
In this work, we revealed that coagulopathy is associated with the severity of
COVID-19, and it is characterized by significantly elevated levels of D-dimer, PT,
and FIB in more severe cases. This review concurs with the conclusions from the
previous meta-analyses on the coagulative function of COVID-19 which found that
PT and D-dimer are significantly higher in more severe patients [34]. However, we
observed no significant decrease in the levels of PLT in more severe COVID-19
patients. Contrarily, a previous meta-analysis that included nine studies showed an

obvious heterogeneity and may lead to unstable results [35].
Moreover, increasing levels of D-dimer and PT indicates that the fibrinolytic system
is activated. The coagulation cascade is activated in viral infections as a host defense
mechanism to limit the spread of pathogens. Additionally, increased production of
cytokines during virus infection stimulates procoagulant reactions that highly express
tissue factors, a major initiator that activates coagulation. Besides, endothelial cell
activation and damage may alter the natural antithrombotic state given the tropism of
the virus for ACE2 receptors [36]. The acronym COVID-19 associated coagulopathy
(CAC) describes the prothrombotic properties in infected patients [37]. Although
coagulopathy is reminiscent of disseminated intravascular coagulation, CAC does not
cause clinical bleeding which is remarkably distinct from DIC [38]. Evidence from
clinical observations shows that CAC is distinct from DIC, featured by elevated
fibrinogen, and nearly the normal platelet count [38]. This observation is consistent
with our findings. This can be explained by the extramedullary megakaryocytes
within the microvessels that have been detected in autopsy among decedents of
COVID-19 [39]. The megakaryocytes can actively produce platelets within the
peripheral circulation [40].
Of note, we report the first meta-analysis that assessed the fibrinogen levels on the
severity of COVID-19. Similarly, several reports showed that fibrinogen significantly
increases in initial and progressive stages of virus infection. Furthermore, a recent
report by Ranucci et al [41] indicated comprehensive coagulation analyses on ICU
admission with median fibrinogen levels of 7.8 g/L and increased clot strength
through thromboelastometry. During the SARS-CoV-2 infection process, a cytokine
storm dominated by interleukin-6 occurs [42], this has been found majorly regulate
and stimulate fibrinogen synthesis. Besides, the variation in fibrinogen levels is
dependent on the infection stages encountered. Elsewhere, Tang et al [43] reported
that fibrinogen levels decline at the late stage of COVID-19 non-survivors despite
increased or normal levels on admission, this is potentially caused by sepsis-induced
coagulopathy.

Despite the obscure mechanism of CAC, abnormal coagulation results including
elevated D-dimer and fibrin degradation products are associated with higher
COVID-19 mortality rates. Thus, monitoring the levels of coagulation parameters is
immensely significant in managing COVID-19. Moreover, Zhou et al [5] conducted a
study in 191 patients from Wuhan and found that D-dimer levels higher than 1ug/L
are associated with higher in-hospital mortality. The World Health Organization [44]
recently issued guidelines for managing COVID-19, whereby it suggested that great
focus should be geared on coagulation dysfunction and thrombotic events.
Based on our findings, we also suggest that dynamic monitoring of coagulation
parameters in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is necessary for predicting COVID-19
progression that is associated with unfavorable outcome and early thrombotic events.
Moreover, futures studies should determine whether early anticoagulation features
such as low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), warfarin, or new oral anticoagulant
(NOAC) are beneficial in patients with significantly elevated coagulation parameters.
Besides, our meta-analysis has a few limitations. First, there was obvious
heterogeneity among studies regarding definitions of the COVID-19 severity, and
either subgroup or sensitivity analyses could not identify the heterogeneity source.
Some selected studies did not report using mean and standard deviation, however,
they gave estimates by median and quartile which may lead to deviation and effect
heterogeneity. We excluded the low-quality studies to maintain the reliability of the
conclusion. Second, this meta-analysis was conducted for studies that failed to
describe all relevant characteristics of individual patients and it was difficult to adjust
on the potentially confounding factors such as comorbidity and treatment (including
use of anticoagulation or glucocorticoid). Finally, we included retrospective studies in
the meta-analysis and there are risks of bias in the data collected.
In conclusion, coagulopathy is associated with the severity of COVID-19. The
D-dimer, PT, and FIB are dominant parameters for evaluating coagulopathy in
COVID-19. COVID-19 associated coagulopathy has different features from DIC,
therefore, it is necessary to closely monitor the dynamics of coagulation parameters.

Methods
Search strategy
The protocol for this systematic review and meta-analysis has been registered on the
International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols
(INPLSY) as INPLASY2020500049 (https://inplasy.com/). The reports included in
the systematic review follows the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in
Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines (the checklist is shown in Supplementary Table
1). The literature reports were written in English and Chinese. We conducted a
literature search on the electronic databases including Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane,
WanFang Database, CNKI and medRxiv for reports published from December 1,
2019 to May 1, 2020 using a combination of the following keywords: "COVID-19" or
"2019 novel coronavirus infection" or "SARS-CoV-2” and” characteristics” or”
coagulopathy” or “coagulation”. Besides, we screened and conducted a manual search
of the references listed in each article to obtain comprehensive results. The search was
done independently by two authors (Xiaolin Zhang and Xue Yang). A third
investigator (Hongmei Jiao) came in to resolve any contradicting search results.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Original studies focused on clinical
characteristics of patients with COVID-19 including observational study, case-control
studies, cohort studies, and randomized control studies; (2) patients were categorized
into less and more severe groups; (3) the coagulation parameters between groups were
described. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Non-original studies including
commentaries, editorials, case reports, letters, meta-analysis, guidelines, and
family-based studies; (2) same patients are enrolled in different articles; (3) patients in
studies are below 18years old.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Two investigators (Xiaolin Zhang and Xue Yang) independently extracted data and

evaluated the quality of literature reports. Contradicting decisions from the two
authors were resolved by a third investigator (Hongmei Jiao) or through consensus.
Data items extracted from each study included the study characteristics, demographic
information, and outcomes of interest. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS)
which included patient selection, study comparability, and three components of
outcomes assessment to evaluate the quality of the original study. Low-quality articles
(NOS<5) were excluded from this meta-analysis.

Data analysis
All statistical analyses were performed via Stata 14.0 (Stata, College Station, TX,
USA). For continuous variables, we calculated the standard mean difference (SMD)
and the 95%CI. Heterogeneity among the studies was assessed using the Chi-squared
and I2 tests. For studies that only reported median and range, CI or interquartile range,
we estimated means and SDs as described by Wan [8]. A random-effects model was
used when either P<0.05 or I2>50% defined significant heterogeneity across the
articles. Otherwise, we used the fixed-effects model. A p-value of less than 0.05 was
considered significant statistically. Further, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to
evaluate the stability of the results and determine the effect of individual study on
pooled results. Evidence of publication bias was examined using Egger’s regression
test for funnel asymmetry in addition to the visual inspection of funnel plots.
