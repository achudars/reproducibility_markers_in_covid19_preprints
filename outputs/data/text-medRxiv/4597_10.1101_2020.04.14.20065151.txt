BACKGROUND
India was one of the countries to institute strict measures for SARS-CoV-2 control in early
phase. Since, then, the epidemic growth trajectory was slow before registering an explosion
of cases due to local cluster transmissions.
METHODS
We estimated growth rate and doubling time of SARS-CoV-2 for India and high burden states
using crowd sourced time series data. Further, we also estimated Basic Reproductive Number
(R0) and time dependent reproductive number (Rt) using serial intervals from the data. We
compared the R0 estimated from five different methods and R0 from SB was further used in
analysis. We modified standard SIR models to SIRD model to accommodate deaths using R0
with the Sequential Bayesian method (SBM) for simulation in SIRD models.
RESULTS
On an average, 2.8 individuals were infected by an index case. The mean serial interval was
3.9 days. The R0 estimated from different methods ranged from 1.43 to 1.85. The mean time
to recovery was 14 ¬± 5.3 days. Daily epidemic growth rate of India was 0.16 [95%CI; 0.14,
0.17] with a doubling time of 4.30 days [95%CI; 3.96, 4.70]. From the SIRD model, it can be
deduced that the peak of SARS-CoV-2 in India will be around mid-July to early August 2020
with around 12.5% of population likely to be infected at the peak time.
CONCLUSIONS
The pattern of spread of SARS-CoV-2 in India is suggestive of community transmission. There
is a need to increase fund for infectious disease research and epidemiologic studies. All the
current gains may be reversed rapidly if air travel and social mixing resumes rapidly. For the
time being, these must be resumed only in a phased manner, and should be back to normal
levels only after we are prepared to deal with the disease with efficient tools like vaccine or a
medicine.

Background
SARS-CoV-2 originated in Hubei province of China and quickly spread to several countries
including Japan and South Korea.1 The source of the infection was later traced back to wet
market in Wuhan, capital of Hubei.2 A phylogenetic analysis of virus in Italy confirmed likely
import of disease from China.3 Rapid travelling modes such as air transport further
accelerated the epidemic by introducing new cases in to more countries.4 As of April 13 2020
there were 1,922,891 reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 globally along with a huge death toll
almost touching 120,000.5 There is increasing evidence that the virus may have jumped
organisms to reach humans through pangolins or similar animals acting as intermediates.6
Emerging and re-emerging infections of this scale disrupt health system functioning and cause
massive losses to economy. Mathematical modelling has been used widely to understand the
spread of disease in populations.7 One of the aims of the modelling is to estimate parameters
that are critical to the spread of diseases such as basic reproductive number or R0 and
incubation period.8 This is quite useful in the scenario of early spread of disease to plan future
strategies.
India was one of the countries to institute strict measures for SARS-CoV-2 control in early
phase.9 The first case of SARS-CoV-2 in India was reported on January 30 2020 from a student
airlifted from Wuhan and at the same time another 800 suspected individuals kept under
observation.10 Since then, the epidemic growth trajectory was slow before registering an
explosion of cases due to local cluster transmissions. In this paper, we describe the current
trend of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in in India and estimate basic parameters such as basic
reproductive number R0 and time reproductive number Rt, doubling time and future trend
for India from real world datasets. Our findings will help to understand the effectiveness of
government response and recalibrate suppression strategies for the epidemic.
Methodology
We used crowd sourced time series data available from the internet to estimate country
specific parameters for the epidemic.11 As of now, this is the best available database for
information on SARS-CoV-2 in India in public domain. The most reliable information in this
database is regarding the daily reported incidence of COVID cases. Also, it contains
aggregated information on total confirmed cases, total death and total recovery. We did not
use variables with limited information. The data was scraped on to R software on 12th April
2020, cleaned and reshaped for the current analysis.12 Package ggplot2 was mainly used to
create figures along with features from base R.13 We defined serial interval as the time
difference in diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in infectee and infector.14 We assumed serial interval
and generation time to be same. Growth rate was computed from this incidence curve by
fitting a log- linear model 15 and basic reproduction number (R0) was obtained from previously
calculated serial interval. We also calculated time dependent reproductive number (Rt) to
show the change in infectivity over time. State-wise growth was measured using the slope
from a linear model.To estimate an R0 for projection purposes, in addition to log linear, we
also estimated R0 from other methods such as Exponential growth (EG), Maximum likelihood
estimation (ML) and Sequential Bayesian Method (SB) and Estimation of time dependent

reproduction numbers (TD).16 We selected Sequential Bayesian Method (SB) to account for
stochasticity in incidence curves as the priors change with time and are drawn from posterior
distribution from time dependent informative priors.16
Conceptually, susceptible individuals become infectious (i.e., move from the susceptible
compartment to the infectious compartment), and then ultimately recover from the infection
(i.e., move from the infectious compartment to the recovered compartment). The rates at
which they move from one compartment to another depend on the proportion of the
population in each of these compartments, as well as the transmission and recovery rates
associated with the disease. We modified standard SIR models to accommodate an additional
compartment for deaths by assuming transition probabilities, the susceptible-infectiousrecovered/Death (SIRD) model. Our model can be represented by the following ordinary
differential equation

where Œ≤ is the disease transmission rate, Œ≥ is the recovery rate, Œ± is the case fatality rate and
œÅ rate at which death occurs. Œ≤ is the product of contact rate and transmission probability. As
these parameters could not be estimated directly from the data, we back calculated Œ≤ from
R0 which was computed previously using Sequential Bayesian method. Œ≥ was calculated from
infectious period - (1/ infectious period). Case fatality rate (Œ±) can be defined as deaths out of
confirmed cases. œÅ was estimated as inverse of time to death. We did not have œÅ from our
data and hence used estimated range of 2-8 weeks from the WHO report.17 We used 5 weeks
as the value of œÅ for our study. The values of the parameters are as follows: R0=1.85, b=0.13,
Œ≥ =0.07, Œ± =0.035 and œÅ=0.028.
Ethics Approval
We used anonymised data available in the public domain for this analysis.
Results
The first case of SARS-CoV-2 was reported in Kerala state. Since then as of 12 April 2020, there
are 9212 confirmed cases, 248 deaths and 1226 recovered in India from SARS-CoV-2.
Maharashtra report the highest number of cases (1982) and north eastern states have the
lowest reported cases. The trend of the epidemic is shown in Figure 1.

Daily growth rate of India fitted from a log incidence over time is 0.16 [95%CI; 0.14, 0.17]. The
doubling time for the epidemic is 4.30 days [95%CI; 3.96, 4.70]. The growth rate and
doubling time for the 5 states with highest burden are given in Table 1 and the rates for the
states with available data are given in Supplementary Figure 3. Kerala, which had the highest
number of cases have effectively contained the outbreak by prolonging the doubling time,
19.48 days [95% CI;10.35,164.60] and the present growth rate is 0.03 [95%CI; 0.004, 0.066].

The nature of the epidemic is changing as the transmission is now more prominent with in
local communities as opposed to imported cases from individuals with travel history from
China, Middle East and Europe. The type of transmission for most cases were not available.
However, those individuals whose source of infection is yet to be determined can be
assumed to be of local origin as travel history of SARS COV-2 patients is well tracked and
documented in India (Supplementary Figure 2).
There were 145 index cases who were identified to have transmitted the disease. On an
average, 2.8 individuals were infected by an index case and the range varied from 1-20

individuals (Figure2). We had information of 413 pairs of primary and secondary cases to
generate serial intervals for computing Basic Reproductive Number or R0. Serial interval
ranged from 0-19 days as the primary and secondary cases reported to the health facility on
the same date. The mean of serial interval was 3.9 days with a standard deviation of 2.85

From the compartmental models it can be deduced that the peak of SARS-CoV-2 in India will
be around mid-July to early August 2020. Around 12.5% of the susceptible individuals are
likely to be infected during the peak. The R0 estimated from different methods ranged from
1.43 in log- linear method to 1.85 in exponential growth methods. Since the estimates were
similar between exponential, Time dependent and Sequential Bayesian methods we went
forward with the Sequential Bayesian to create the SIRD model (Figure 4).

Discussion
We estimated several parameters of SARS-CoV-2 infection in India, from crowd sourced data
and used minimal set of assumptions in our forecasts. Models are useful in identifying the
transmission dynamics if parameter inputs are based on real world data in early phase of
epidemic. Social distancing and travel ban to reduce community transmission seem to have
impact on infection transmission.
There is an urgent need to estimate setting specific parameters for future planning. For
instance, we did not have information on death rate and recovery rate and used estimates
from published studies in the SIRD model. We also could not compute incubation period as
the database contained information only on linked cases and their admissions. Studies have
shown that this could be approximately between 5-8 days.18,19 Also, it is difficult to separate
the serial interval time from generation time overlaps as the information of cases are only
available from reporting to the health authorities. Studies have suggested that SARS-Cov-2
can spread before the symptomatic phase which precludes full understanding of the
transmission pattern and underlying characteristics.

The R0 estimated across many studies may not reflect actual transmission potential of virus
as these were measured in dynamic cohorts with some sort of mitigation measures. Estimates
from studies among closed population such as in Diamond Princess and Wuhan may be more
reliable in this regard.20 Riou et al. estimated a reliable range for R0 which was between 1.4
and 3.8 by simulating Wuhan epidemic incidence trajectories in a cluster environment.21 We
estimated the range of R0 in India to be between 1.42 and 1.84 by comparing estimates from
5 different methods. It can be assumed that the real Ro in India is close to 1.85. The upper
limit of uncertainty of R0 in our analysis exceeds 2 which may be indicative of spread of
infection at local level and is comparable to European scenario.22 This is much lower than R0
in most countries and may be indicative of the effectiveness of measures taken at policy level
such as lock down, cancellation of flights, social distancing and sealing of identified hotspots.
India has done well to contain population level spread to a great extent and to keep low
mortality rates. India has one of the lowest attack rate of 0.47 at this stage of the epidemic
which is several times lower than developed countries.23 However, the epidemic is on the rise
in India and creates new challenges such as optimal use of resources including swabs and
testing kits besides identifying the high-risk groups. A recent study by Prem et al suggests that
mitigation measures may be helpful only in delaying the infection from reaching its peak.24
Thus, it implies that the measures would likely prevent immediate flooding of hospitals
preventing people from obtaining adequate care. The epidemic is yet to reach its peak in India
which we expect to be around mid-July and early August. Our models suggest that 12.5% of
the susceptible individuals are likely to be infected during the peak. This means that there is
still around 2- 3 months to prepare for the worst phase of the epidemic.
Control measures of SARS-CoV-2 are less effective in populations with high density.20 India
has a huge population and potential of SARS-CoV-2 for sustained transmission is well
established. 21,25 We relied solely on estimates from compartmental model which generates
estimates from the infection parameters than depending on forecasts based on trend. Our
findings are based on simulations and further measures at policy level can alter the trajectory
of the disease. Lipsitch et al recommends a strategy combining epidemiological studies,
testing and lab studies as more effective strategy in generating evidence for suppressing the
epidemic.26
Our analysis has certain limitations. Firstly, there may be underreporting of cases and lack of
validated data for research purposes available to the public.However, we compared the
incidence from our dataset to the aggregated numbers elsewhere like European Disease
Prevention and Control 23and Worldometer5 and the figures were similar. Another issue in
estimating the parameters is the presence of super spreaders and asymptomatic cases. The
estimated proportion of asymptomatic cases can be as high as 10% in the population.27 The
virus can be spread around during asymptomatic stage and delays from onset to reporting or
treatment can be as high as 11 days.28 Nonetheless, pooling estimates across several studies
will aid in computing values that are closer to the true estimates.

In conclusion, our study provides information on India specific estimates of SARS-CoV-2
transmission parameters using real world data for the first time and shows that measures
taken till date have been effective in reducing the spread of disease. However, the rising

incidence and pattern of spread is suggestive of community transmission and is likely to
increase cases in the future. The availability of individual level data is critical to assess the
effectiveness of ongoing measures and plan future strategies. There is a need to increasingly
fund infectious disease research and epidemiologic studies and make that data available in the
public domain. Future studies could focus on studying genetic variations in asymptomatic
individuals and those index cases with higher disease transmission rates. There needs to be
a renewed thinking of health systems particularly regarding emergency preparedness and
optimal utilization of scarce resources. Epidemiologists need to be considered in decision
making and developing disease control strategies. Furthermore, there needs to be concerted
action at global level to contain the virus including joint research and developing vaccines and
drugs. All the current gains may be reversed rapidly if air travel and social mixing resumes
rapidly. For the time being, these must be resumed only in a phased manner, and should be
back to normal levels only after we are prepared to deal with the disease with efficient tools
like vaccine or a medicine.
