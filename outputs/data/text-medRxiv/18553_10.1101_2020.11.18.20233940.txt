Abstract

14

Dengue, Zika and chikungunya are diseases of global health significance caused by

15

arboviruses and transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti of worldwide circulation. The

16

arrival of the Zika and chikungunya viruses to South America increased the complexity of

17

transmission and morbidity caused by these viruses co-circulating in the same vector

18

mosquito species. Here we present an integrated analysis of the reported arbovirus cases

19

between 2007 and 2017 and local climate and socio-economic profiles of three distinct

20

Colombian municipalities (Bello, Cúcuta and Moniquirá). These locations were confirmed as

21

three different ecosystems given their contrasted geographic, climatic and socio-economic

22

profiles. Correlational analyses were conducted with both generalised linear models and

23

generalised additive models for the geographical data. Average temperature and wind speed

24

were strongly correlated with disease incidence. The transmission of Zika during the 2016

25

epidemic appeared to decrease circulation of dengue in Cúcuta, an area of sustained high

26

incidence of dengue. Socio-economic factors such as barriers to health and childhood

27

services, inadequate sanitation and poor water supply suggested an unfavourable impact on

28

the transmission of dengue, Zika and chikungunya in all three ecosystems. Socio-

29

demographic influencers were also discussed including the influx of people to Cúcuta, fleeing

30

political and economic instability from neighbouring Venezuela. Aedes aegypti is expanding

31

its range and increasing the global threat of these diseases. It is therefore vital that we learn

32

from the epidemiology of these arboviruses and translate it into an actionable knowledge

33

base. This is even more acute given the recent historical high of dengue cases in the Americas

34

in 2019, preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, which is itself hampering mosquito control

35

efforts.

Author summary

37

Viruses transmitted by Ae. aegypti mosquitoes (dengue, Zika, chikungunya) are amongst the

38

most significant public health concerns of recent years due to the increase in global cases and

39

the rapid spread of the vectors. The primary method of controlling the spread of these

40

arboviruses is through mosquito control. Understanding factors associated with risk of these

41

viruses is key for informing control programmes and predicting when outbreaks may occur.

42

Climate is an important driver in mosquito development and virus reproduction and hence the

43

association of climate with disease risk. Socio-economic factors contribute to perpetuate

44

disease risk. Areas of high poverty have abundance of suitable habitat for Ae. aegypti (e.g.

45

due to poor housing and sanitation). This study investigated the factors effecting arbovirus

46

incidence in three distinct regions of Colombia: Bello, Cúcuta and Moniquirá. The results

47

show significant relationships between disease incidence and temperature, precipitation and

48

wind speed. A decline in dengue following outbreaks of Zika (2016) is also reported.

49

Measures of poverty, including critical overcrowding and no access to improved water source

50

were also found to be higher in areas of higher disease incidence. The results of this study

51

highlight the importance of using a multifactorial approach when designing vector control

52

programs in order to effectively distribute health care resources.

Introduction

54

Vector-borne diseases are one of the most significant public health burdens globally, with

55

80% of the total world population at risk [1]. Arboviruses, including dengue, Zika and

56

chikungunya, are of particular concern due to the recent increase in global cases promoted by

57

the rapid spread of both, their primary mosquito vector Aedes aegypti as well as their

58

secondary vector Aedes albopictus [2]. Dengue infection can be asymptomatic but clinical

59

presentations range from mild dengue fever (DF), a febrile illness similar to influenza, to the

60

severe forms of dengue; dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and dengue haemorrhagic fever

61

(DHF) [3]. Most Zika (ZIKV) infections are asymptomatic, with only approximately 20% of

62

infections causing symptoms [4,5]. The clinical presentations of symptomatic ZIKV can

63

include Zika fever, congenital Zika syndrome and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Congenital Zika

64

syndrome refers to a group of birth defects, notably Microcephaly, which have been

65

associated with ZIKV during pregnancy [6,7]. Infection with the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)

66

is characterised by sudden onset fever, rash and arthralgia [8].

67

Dengue causes an estimated 390 million infections per year and has a distribution that covers

68

every continent of the world with the exception of Antarctica [9]. The number of global

69

dengue cases reported to the WHO has increased 15 fold over the last 20 years, with deaths

70

also seeing a significant increase (4-fold) [10]. The first epidemics of ZIKV were reported in

71

Yap, Micronesia (2007) and French Polynesia (2013), outbreaks were reported in Brazil in

72

2015 and 2016 which then led to a rapid spread of ZIKV to 48 countries within the Americas

73

and the Caribbean [11]. ZIKV epidemics have also been reported in Singapore [12], Vietnam

74

[13], Thailand [14] and Cape Verde [15]. CHIKV was first reported in Tanzania in 1952 and

75

has since rapidly spread across the globe causing epidemics in Asia, India, Europe and The

76

Americas [16].

77

Spreading from its ancestral home in West Africa 400-500 years ago via the slave trade Ae.

78

aegypti is found in tropical and sub-tropical regions [17]. Meteorological conditions directly

79

influence the incidence of arboviruses by modulating vector mosquito populations.

80

Conditions favourable to Ae. aegypti include an ideal temperature range between 20 - 35°C

81

for mosquito development, fertilisation and viral load [18]. Non-climatic factors promoting

82

Ae. aegypti populations include vegetation index, urbanisation and accessibility to human

83

populations [19,20]. Latin America is significantly affected by Ae. aegypti borne viruses due

84

to its habitat suitability for the vector, tropical climate and often limited medical resources

85

and vector control programmes [21,22]. Colombia, located in the north-west corner of South

86

America, has 140,612 km2 of suitable habitat for Ae. aegypti throughout the country based on

87

the presence of climatic characteristics [23]. Ae. aegypti in Colombia has been found at

88

altitudes up to 2,300 m above sea level [24]. The presence of Ae. aegypti across Colombia is

89

mirrored by a high nationwide incidence of dengue, Zika and chikungunya. Dengue has been

90

consistently reported in Colombia over the past two decades causing an average of 84,926

91

cases each year (1980-2019). Zika was first reported in Colombia in 2015 and was followed

92

by a significant outbreak of 91,711 cases in 2016. Chikungunya was first detected in

93

Colombia in 2013, causing 275,907 cases in that single year [25].

94

In addition to climatic variables, socio-economic (SE) factors can contribute to the spread of

95

mosquito borne diseases. This is particularly acute with Ae. aegypti, a highly anthropophilic

96

species which lives within or in close proximity to human dwellings breeding in domestic

97

water storage containers. Poor housing construction together with high population density

98

and inadequate sanitation with little to no access to clean running water are key SE factors

99

promoting Ae. aegypti populations [26]. In the absence of suitable vaccines for dengue, Zika

100

or chikungunya, disease prevention is currently based on Ae. aegypti control. This is

101

challenging with a diurnal biting mosquito. A compound effect is the development of

102

insecticide resistance in populations of Ae. aegypti reported in areas of Colombia [27].

103

This study aims to investigate the epidemiology of these three arboviruses (dengue, Zika and

104

chikungunya) co-circulating in a single vector species (Ae. aegypti) in three distinct eco-

105

systems in Colombia between 2007 - 2017. This is achieved using a multifactorial approach

106

considering the potential correlations of several meteorological and socio-economic factors

107

with disease incidence. We show that specific climatological factors are strong drivers for

108

these arboviral diseases to which contextual socio-economical characteristics can act as

109

modifiers. Importantly, we find a discriminatory pattern between these three diseases

110

highlighting unexpected dynamics of transmission between Zika and dengue particularly in

111

an area of high dengue circulation.

Methods

113

Disease incidence data

114

Three municipalities in Colombia were selected for analysis: Bello, Cúcuta and Moniquirá

115

(Fig 1). Cases of dengue, severe dengue (dengue shock syndrome and dengue haemorrhagic

116

fever), chikungunya and Zika reported in each epidemiological week were obtained for the

117

period of 2007 to 2017 from SIVIGILIA (National Public Health Surveillance System,

118

Colombian National Institute of Health) [28]. This period of study (2007-2017) had

119

consistent reporting of dengue along with the epidemics of both Zika and chikungunya.

120

Chikungunya was first reported in 2014 and Zika in 2015. For the purpose of analysis week

121

53 was removed from any years in which there were 53 epidemiological weeks (2008 and

122

2014) this ensured continuity across the data set with all years comprising of 52 weeks when

123

analysed. Only cases confirmed by SIVIGILIA were used in this analysis, confirmations are

124

made based on laboratory tests and epidemiological links.

125

Climate data

126

Daily weather data for Bello, Cúcuta and Moniquirá were obtained from the NASA Langley

127

Research Center (LaRC) POWER Project [29]. The meteorological data has a resolution of

128

0.5o latitude and 0.5o longitude. The weather data was obtained for the same time period as

129

the disease incidence data (2007-2017) and converted to epidemiological weeks to

130

correspond with the dates of the disease incidence data. The weather variables included for

131

each municipality were: maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin),

132

average temperature (Tavg), maximum wind speed (WSmax), minimum wind speed

133

(WSmin), average wind speed (WSavg), total precipitation and average humidity (Havg).

134

Population and socio-economic data

135

Population data for each municipality were obtained using population projections by

136

Colombia’s National Administrative Department of Statistics (Departamento Administrativo

137

Nacional de Estadística) (DANE) (www.dane.gov.co) [30]. The multidimensional poverty

138

index (MPI) was implemented by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative and

139

the United Nations Development Program’s Human Development Report Office as a direct

140

method for measuring poverty [31]. The MPI at municipality level was obtained from DANE

141

using data collected in the 2018 National Population and Housing Census and using the

142

indicators and respective weightings listed in S2 Table [32].

143

Statistical analysis

144

Patterns of disease incidence by location

145

Differences in the total burden of all three Ae. aegypti borne viruses as well as the individual

146

burden of dengue and severe dengue were investigated using the total number of cases from

147

2007-2017. Poisson Generalised Linear Models (GLMs) were initially carried out, revealing

148

overdispersion (data variance greater than expected for the given model) statistics of 545, 542

149

and 123 for total disease, dengue and severe dengue respectively. To correct for the large

150

overdispersion the GLMs were recalculated with negative binomial errors [33] using the

151

glm.nb function of the R package MASS [34]. Differences between all three municipalities

152

were tested with Tukey pairwise comparisons using the glht function of the multcomp R

153

package [35]. Incidence of chikungunya in 2015 was initially modelled using a Poisson GLM

154

which revealed an overdispersion statistic of 2.9. The standard errors were therefore corrected

155

using quasi-GLMs where the variance was theta x mu. Where mu was the mean of the

156

dependant variable and theta the dispersion parameter of the quasi-GLMs [33]. Quasi-GLMs

157

were conducted using the glm function from the R package stats [36]. Zika incidence was

158

modelled for the year 2017 only, initially a Poisson GLM was used and an overdispersion

159

statistic of 99 was detected. As the overdispersion statistic was above 20 it was corrected for

160

using negative binomial errors [33]. Total Ae. aegypti borne disease and dengue incidence

161

were also modelled for 2015 and 2016 using quasi-GLMs to account for low level

162

overdispersion except for total disease in 2016 which had a dispersion statistic of 90 and was

163

therefore modelled with a negative binomial GLM. Population was used as an offset in all

164

models in order to standardise disease incidence by population size.

165

Patterns of disease incidence over time

166

For the pattern of disease over time we used total yearly incidence data. Poisson GLMs were

167

initially used to model each disease in each municipality but overdispersion was detected in

168

some models, hence error distributions were adjusted accordingly. For Bello incidence of

169

both total disease (dengue, severe dengue, chikungunya and Zika) and dengue alone were

170

modelled using quasipoisson GLMs, correcting for overdispersions of 3.69 and 3.63

171

respectively. For Cúcuta a negative binomial GLM was required for total disease incidence in

172

order to correct for overdispersion of 32.52 and quasi-GLM was used for dengue incidence

173

due to slight overdispersion of 4.87. Severe dengue incidence in Cúcuta was not found to be

174

significantly overdispersed when modelled with a Poisson GLM (overdispersion statistic =

175

1.79), as the overdispersion statistic was <2. For Moniquirá both total disease incidence and

176

dengue incidence alone were modelled using quasi-GLMs, correcting for respective

177

overdispersion statistics of 2.39 and 2.34 [33]. Population was used as an offset in all models

178

in order to standardise disease incidence by population size. All quasi-GLMs were conducted

179

using the glm function from the R package stats [36] and negative binomial GLMs used the

180

glm.nb function of the R package MASS [34]. Differences between the years were tested

181

with Tukey pairwise comparisons using the glht function of the multcomp R package [35].

182

Generalised additive models

183

The correlations between climatic variables and the total disease incidence (dengue, severe

184

dengue, chikungunya and Zika) across all three locations were investigated using a

185

generalised additive model (GAM). The weekly disease incidence and weather data for each

186

municipality was converted into 4-week data, matching the dates of epidemiological months.

187

Combining the data into 4-week periods rather than individual weeks reduced zero inflation

188

improving the reliability of the GAM outputs. All climate variables were lagged by plausible

189

time lags for their effect on disease incidence, of 4 and 8 weeks. Square root transformations

190

were used for total disease incidence and each weather variable due to non-normal

191

distribution. Generalised additive models were chosen due to their ability to model non-linear

192

relationships between a response variable (disease incidence) and multiple explanatory

193

variables (climate variables) [37]. A quasi-maximum likelihood Poisson GAM was used in

194

order to prevent possible overdispersion [33]. Population size was used as an offset to

195

standardise disease incidence by population. Initially all climate variables with both 4 and 8-

196

week time lags were assumed to have a non-linear relationship and were therefore modelled

197

as smoothed terms. Subsequent analysis of the effective degrees of freedom (edf) was used to

198

identify variables with edf = 1.0, suggesting linearity. These variables were then included in

199

the model as linear rather than smoothed terms. Generalised cross validation (GCV) was used

200

to determine the most appropriate model. Generalised additive modelling and subsequent

201

model validation was conducted using the R package mgcv [38]. Visualisation of GAM

202

estimations were conducted using the mgcViz R package [39].

203

Socio-economic factors

204

Principle components analysis (PCA) was used for dimensional reduction to allow the

205

inclusion of socio-economic data with previously compiled geographic and climate data. The

General disease incidence between 2007 - 2017

221

Dengue was the most prevalent of the three diseases throughout Colombia (Fig 2). Cúcuta

222

carried the highest disease burden of the three municipalities followed by Moniquirá, with

223

Bello having the lowest disease incidence. The total number of confirmed cases of all Ae.

224

aegypti borne diseases (dengue, severe dengue, chikungunya and Zika) during the period of

225

2007 - 2017 were 5,727, 32,328 and 1,005 in Bello, Cúcuta and Moniquirá respectively. The

226

breakdown of cases per 100,000 people of all three diseases between 2007 and 2017 in these

227

locations were 1,301, 6,094 and 4,669 in Bello, Cúcuta and Moniquirá, respectively. When

228

discriminating by disease per 100,000 people, the incidence of dengue was 1,263 in Bello,

230

and 61 Moniquirá. Incidence of Zika was lowest in Bello with 11 cases compared to 834 in

231

Cúcuta and 42 in Moniquirá.

232

The spread of the data for the period analysed was assessed in 12-week periods, using smooth

233

moving averages (SMA) (Fig 3). Dengue and severe dengue were consistently reported

234

throughout the period of 2007-2017. Dengue data showed at least three spikes: one in 2009

235

(approximately week 180 in Fig 3), followed by two more by the end of 2014 (week 400) and

236

beginning of 2017 (week 510). The latter of these peaks started approximately two years

237

prior (2015) (Fig 3). Chikungunya cases were only reported between 2014-2017, hence the

238

flat line before week 400 in Fig 3. Similarly, for Zika whose first cases were reported in 2015

239

(approximately week 450 in Fig 3), with the highest number of cases reported in week 468 in

240

2016 (Fig 3).

241

Patterns of disease incidence per location

242

Total disease incidence over the 11-year period was significantly lower in Bello than in

243

Cúcuta (p = < 0.001) and Moniquirá (p = 0.005) (Fig 4A) for all three diseases. The number

244

of dengue cases were similarly high between Moniquirá and Cúcuta (p = 0.99). However,

245

severe dengue incidence was significantly different across all three municipalities: Cúcuta

246

had the highest burden of severe dengue when compared to both Bello (p = <0.001) and

247

Moniquirá (p = 0.005), and Moniquirá had a significantly higher burden of severe dengue

248

when compared to Bello (p = 0.047) (Fig 4A).

249

The incidence data were also analysed separately for the years when the outbreaks of

250

chikungunya and Zika were reported, 2015 and 2016, respectively (Fig 4B and 4C). This

251

allowed for a more directly and meaningful comparison of the burden represented by these

252

three diseases. Cases of chikungunya in 2015 were not significantly different between any of

253

the municipalities (Fig 4B). However, Cúcuta had significantly higher incidence of Zika than

254

both Bello (p= <0.001) and Moniquirá (p = <0.001) (Fig 4C). Interestingly, in the same year

255

of the Zika outbreak (2016) each municipality had a significantly different number of dengue

256

cases. Cúcuta had the lowest incidence of dengue, and Moniquirá the highest (Fig 4C). While

257

Cúcuta had the highest incidence of dengue in previous years, in 2016 the same location

258

experienced the lowest incidence of dengue accompanied by the highest incidence of Zika

259

(Fig 4C).

260

Patterns of disease incidence during 2007 to 2017

261

We compared the number of cases per 100,000 people in each year for dengue, severe

262

dengue, chikungunya and Zika from 2007 to 2017 in Bello, Cúcuta and Moniquirá (Fig 5).

263

The initial cases of Zika were first confirmed in Colombia in 2015, with cases reported in

264

both Bello and Cúcuta from that year onwards. The first Zika case in Moniquirá was not

265

confirmed until 2016. Whilst cases of Zika were relatively low in Bello and Moniquirá,

266

Cúcuta experienced large outbreaks (Fig 5).

267

The data analysed per location (Fig 4) and per year (Fig 5) suggested that Zika displaced

268

dengue in Cúcuta from 2015 to 2016. The number of Zika cases per 100,000 population in

269

2015 were 125 and 705 in 2016 whilst dengue was present in 313 and 150 cases, respectively

270

(Fig 5B). On the other hand, in Bello and Moniquirá, where the incidence of Zika was much

271

lower (Bello; 1 in 2015 and 3 in 2016, Moniquirá; 0 in 2015 and 42 in 2016), there was an

272

incremental trend for dengue during this same transition from 2015 to 2016 (Fig 5A and 5C).

273

Following the significantly high dengue incidence in Bello and Moniquirá in 2016, the

274

incidence stabilised, and the incidence reported in 2017 were not statistically different to that

275

of years prior to 2016. This was not the case however in Cúcuta where incidence of dengue

276

continued to fall, with the lowest incidence of the study period observed in 2017 (Fig 5B). In

277

2017 incidence of Zika was also much lower with only 3 cases per 100,000 people reported

278

in Cúcuta in 2017 (Fig 5A and 5C).

279

Effect of climate on disease incidence

280

The geographical settings for the three locations studied here Bello, Cúcuta and Moniquirá

281

(Table 1) determine three different climate systems – ecosystems. These three different

282

ecosystems are expected to establish contrasting behavioural patterns for the mosquito vector

283

species that transmit dengue, Zika and chikungunya. The results presented in this section

284

related to the quantitative climate variables as explained in Methods and inferred here to be

285

proxy determinants of disease transmission by Ae. aegypti. We initially summarised the

286

climate variables of each municipality from 2007-2017 as a breakdown of smooth moving

287

averages (SMA) of 12-week periods (Fig 6). All parameters used here for temperature

288

(Tmax, Tmin, Tavg) and wind speed (WSmax, WSmin, WSavg) were highest in Cúcuta.

289

Bello had the lowest wind speed and highest relative humidity (Havg). There was a large

290

fluctuation of 8oC in Tmax and 5oC in Tavg in 2011 in all three locations (approximately

291

week 220, Fig 6). Otherwise the recorded climatic variables fluctuate within a similar range

292

throughout these 11 years.

293

We explored potential relationships between the time series climate data and total disease

294

incidence in Bello, Cúcuta and Moniquirá at shorter 4 and 8-week time lags using a

295

generalised additive model (GAM) as explained in Methods. The estimates from the

296

quasipoisson GAM explained 57.6% of the variance in total disease incidence over time

297

(Table 2). Effective degrees of freedom (edf) close to 1 represent relation close to linearity

298

while high edf values for the smooth terms suggest that the relationship between climatic

299

variables and disease incidence is non-linear. The GAM identified significant relationships

300

between disease incidence and precipitation at 4 and 8-week lags, average humidity (4-week

301

lag), minimum temperature (4 and 8-week lags), average temperature (8-week lag),

302

maximum wind speed (4 and 8-week lag) and average wind speed (4-week lag) (Table 2).

The climate variables significantly correlated to total disease incidence as presented in Table

309

2 were further investigated by plotting the smoothed variance of the latter against the ranges

310

covered for each climate variable (Fig 7). The analysis of the three most significant climatic

311

contributors to total disease incidence -temperature, wind speed, and precipitation –

312

delineated clear trends on how climate affected disease transmission. Increasing Tmin from

313

8oC to 16oC, at either 4 or 8-week, reduced the total disease incidence while the average

314

temperatures (Tavg) up to 24oC contributed to incremental levels of disease (Fig 7A-C). This

315

could be an indication of the need for a range of low minimal temperatures to adjust the

316

average values at which disease transmission is more efficient.

317

Increasing wind speed above 1 m/s was associated by an increase in disease incidence with a

318

peak around 2 m/s after which disease incidence declined until around 3 m/s where a small

319

rise in disease risk can also be seen. This relationship between maximum wind speed and

320

disease incidence was observed after both 4 and 8-week time lags (Fig 7D-E). The decisive

321

influence on wind speed was substantiated by the negative effect on disease incidence at

322

incremental average wind speeds (Fig 7F). Precipitation showed a positive relationship with

323

disease incidence above 90 mm at 4-week time lags and above 25 mm for the data with 8-

324

week time lag (Fig 7G-H). The high level of non-linearity shown for the relationship between

325

average humidity and disease incidence (edf = 7.5) (Table 2) is detailed in Fig 7I. Disease

326

incidence increased as humidity increased between 55-60%. This was followed by a slight

327

decrease and plateau between 60-70%, a more rapid increase was observed between 70 and

328

75% above which disease incidence begins to decline (Fig 7I).

329

Socio-economic profiles

330

We followed a holistic approach by further including socio-economic data for these three

331

locations in the investigation for modifiers to the disease transmission of dengue, Zika and

332

chikungunya. The overall multidimensional poverty index (see Methods) was lowest in Bello

333

at 14.2. Cúcuta and Moniquirá had similar MPIs at 25.7 and 27.1 respectively (Table 3).

338

The overall MPIs in Cúcuta and Moniquirá were similar. However, there were differences in

339

specific poverty measures relevant to the transmission of vector borne viral diseases. Cúcuta

340

had higher rates of overcrowding (16.4%), barriers to both childhood and youth services

341

(2.2%) and healthcare services (5.2%) and inappropriate exterior wall material (6.1%) (Table

342

3). The findings also pointed to other socio-economic indexes that also affect general health

343

and well-being in Moniquirá: inadequate excreta disposal (sanitation) (12.1%), no access to

344

an improved water source (20.4%), illiteracy (15.3%) and low education achievement

345

(59.4%) were all highest in Moniquirá (Table 3).

346

In order to introduce the socio-economic data into the analyses undertaken with the

347

epidemiological and climatic data we carried out a dimensionality reduction and correlation

348

with a principal component analysis (PCA). Importantly there was a clear separation of the

349

three municipalities along both dimensions PC1 and PC2 that together integrates 89.9% of

350

the compiled parameters (Fig 8). This approach made apparent a discriminatory set of factors

351

both climatic and socio-economic for all three locations. Cúcuta had an extensive

352

combination of climate factors (i.e. wind speed and temperature) that together with school

353

absence, dependency, overcrowding, wall material and school failure are potential modifiers

of dengue, Zika and chikungunya risk in this municipality. Interestingly, Moniquirá showed

355

mainly socio-economic variables (i.e. water source, sanitation, illiteracy, low education,

356

flooring material, child labour, high MPI, informal work) to be potential modifiers for disease

357

risk. On the other hand, Bello had mainly climate variables as potential modifiers of disease

358

transmission – average humidity, precipitation and elevation – with only health insurance as a

359

socio-economic factor.

Discussion

362

This study set out to determine the longitudinal dynamics of three Aedes arboviral diseases

363

co-circulating in three regions of Colombia over a 11-year period between 2007 and 2017.

364

We found significant differences in the burden of viruses among the three municipalities

365

studied. Bello had the lowest level of disease incidence across all diseases. Cúcuta had the

366

highest incidence of severe dengue (2007-2017) and Zika (2016) and the highest overall

367

disease incidence. In addition to climatic factors the burden of these vector borne diseases in

368

Cúcuta can be compounded by local current socio-political dynamics. Cúcuta is on

369

Colombia’s border with Venezuela, a country which has faced an economic, political and

370

health crisis in recent years [42,43]. The humanitarian crisis has led to large migration of

371

Venezuelan citizens and refugees to neighbouring countries, with Colombia receiving the

372

highest number of Venezuelan migrants. The number of Venezuelan migrants in Colombia

373

increased from 48,714 in 2015 to 600,000 in 2017 [44]. This has had a significant impact on

374

public health in Colombia, with infectious and vector-borne diseases particularly effected

375

[45–50].

376

The arrival of chikungunya and Zika in 2015 established a co-transmission of three different

377

arboviruses by Ae. aegypti. Unexpectedly, a reduction in dengue cases was found in parallel

378

to the spike in Zika cases in the year of the Zika epidemic of 2016 in Cúcuta. The same

379

location in the years prior to the Zika outbreak had consistently presented high incidences of

380

dengue. Moreover, in Cúcuta the incidence of both dengue and severe cases of dengue were

381

lower in 2017, the year following the Zika epidemic, than in any of the 10 years prior. The

382

decline of dengue following Zika reported in this study agrees with the overall decline in

383

dengue incidence across the whole of Colombia [51,52] and has also been observed in other

384

dengue endemic countries across the Americas [52,53]. In 2017 the total number of dengue

385

cases across the Americas was lower than any of the 10 previous years [54] with a 73%

386

decline between 2016 and 2017 alone [53].

387

Changes in epidemiological surveillance systems can cause the identification of inaccurate

388

patterns of disease incidence. However, we did not observe any indication of significant

389

changes to the surveillance system used to report Aedes borne viruses to SIVIGILIA, the

390

database used here. However, the circulation of multiple viruses in the same localities at the

391

same time does provide challenges for surveillance systems. Clinical presentation of Zika is

392

very similar to that of dengue [22,55] and this can cause cases to be misidentified when

393

laboratory testing is not conducted. We note that although the cases analysed in this study are

394

all confirmed cases, confirmation is not always done by laboratory testing but also by

395

epidemiological links. Misidentification could therefore explain the increase in dengue that

396

was observed in Bello and Moniquirá in 2016, where low incidence of Zika was reported.

397

Increased dengue incidence in 2015 and 2016 in other regions has also been reported and

398

attributed to potential misidentification of Zika [53].

399

Coinfection of the primary vector Ae. aegypti with multiple arboviruses (i.e. DENV, CHIKV,

400

ZIKV) has been reported following laboratory exposure [56–61]. Aedes mosquitoes have also

401

been shown capable of transmitting more than one arbovirus in a single biting event

402

[57,61,62]. Although coinfection has yet to be found in wild Ae. aegypti [62]. Coinfection of

403

multiple Aedes borne viruses has been reported in mammalian hosts including humans [63–

404

69]. In Colombia patients have been diagnosed with DENV-CHIKV [48,70,71], DENV-

405

ZIKV [48,71], CHIKV-ZIKV [48,71] and DENV-CHIKV-ZIKV [22,49] coinfections.

406

However, the frequency of DENV-ZIKV co-infections seems low at 8.8% [71]. DENV and

407

ZIKV co-transmission in mice through the bite of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes showed preferential

408

transmission of ZIKV [61].

409

Host cross-immunity of ZIKV and DENV could have been a contributing factor in the

410

dengue declines observed in this study. The observed decline in dengue cases following Zika

411

outbreaks reported within this study and in others across the Americas suggest that there may

412

be cross-immunity between ZIKV and DENV in humans [51–53,72–98]. Flavivirus

413

immunity involves a T cell response and studies have reported cross-reactivity of CD4+ and

414

CD8+ T cells to both DENV and ZIKV [99–103]. Cross-reactivity of antibodies and T cells

415

and cross-immunity from Zika, although not necessarily conferring cross-protection, has been

416

presented as the most probable reason explaining the decline of dengue across the Americas

417

in 2017 [53].

418

Specific climatic factors associated here significantly affected disease incidence. This was

419

particularly evident for Cúcuta, the municipality with the highest disease burden. We found

420

significant co-relationship between average temperature and wind speed with disease

421

transmission, with a peak at around 2m/s, consistent with findings of previous studies [104–

422

107]. Ae. aegypti has a small flight range of 200 m and high wind speeds reduce mosquito

423

flight distances while low winds mean reduced dispersion of mosquitoes. We found the

424

optimum wind speed to be around 2 m/s which is in line with current knowledge of mosquito

425

flight [104,108,109]. Climate variables can be used to build predictive models to anticipate

426

when outbreaks of dengue, chikungunya and Zika are likely to occur [110–113]. This is

427

useful in the prioritisation of vector-control resources. Recent modelling studies have

428

reported an increase in the incidence and geographical spread Ae. aegypti borne viruses when

429

using climate change simulation models [114–118]. This highlights the importance of

430

consideration of environmental factors when assessing risk of vector-borne disease [119].

431

We report differences in measurements of socio-economics between Bello, Cúcuta and

432

Moniquirá. Bello, the municipality with the lowest burden of Aedes borne viruses also had

433

the lowest poverty index, whilst Cúcuta and Moniquirá were much higher in both disease

434

incidence and multidimensional poverty. Higher incidence of Aedes borne disease has been

435

associated with lower socio-economic status and higher poverty levels [120–127]. Cúcuta had

436

the highest rate of critical overcrowding. Overcrowding has been reported to be an important

437

contributing factor to dengue incidence [119–121,128]. Inadequate sanitation, and no access

438

to improved sources of water are both well-known contributing factors in increasing burden

439

of Aedes borne disease due to the ecology of Aedes mosquitoes [26,119,123–125,129]. These

440

socio-economic risk factors were highest in Moniquirá where there were also high levels of

441

low educational achievement and illiteracy. Illiteracy and low educational level have

442

previously been associated with increased vulnerability to dengue in Colombia and Brazil

443

[130,131].

444

Heading into the COVID-19 2020 global pandemic, 2019 saw the highest number of dengue

445

cases in The Americas for twenty years [132]. The factors that can exasperate the spread of

446

COVID-19 (e.g. poor sanitation, lack of access to clean water, overcrowding) are also

447

contributing factors to arboviral diseases. Disease surveillance and control programs are

448

being significantly impacted by the pandemic, and the consequences of this will not be clear

449

for some time but the pandemic also places an extra burden on already fragile health systems.

450

Lockdown and social distancing measures will be detrimental for Aedes control which often

451

involves community focused activities (e.g. door to door) led by community health workers

452

and vector control experts. The World Mosquito Programme for example halted all control

453

activities involving community interaction (e.g. releasing Wolbachia positive Ae. aegypti) for

454

three months. Social distancing can be difficult or impossible in poorer areas with high

455

population densities. It is therefore more imperative than ever that we more fully understand

456

the dynamics of these important diseases which are likely to escalate over the coming years.

457

Having different ecosystems Bello, Cúcuta and Moniquirá presented a valuable opportunity

458

to explore longitudinal arboviral disease incidence over 11 years that encompassed a Zika

459

epidemic. Chikungunya was the only disease for which incidence did not significantly differ

460

between the three municipalities. Cúcuta had the greatest disease incidence having the most

461

favourable climatic factors and greater poverty index but as it borders with Venezuela mass

462

movement of people is also suggested to be a contributing factor. Climatic factors associated

463

with disease incidence were precipitation, average humidity, temperature and wind speed.

464

Co-transmission of dengue and Zika during the epidemic led to a significant reduction of

465

dengue cases in Cúcuta where dengue had previously been high. This significant finding

466

warrants further investigation. Where the poverty index was low, as in Bello, so was the

467

disease incidence. Socio-economic factors such as barriers to health and childhood services,

468

inadequate sanitation, poor housing and poor water supply were implicated as drivers of

469

disease transmission. Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus are increasing their geographical

470

range and climate change is predicted to alter the distribution of these vectors and hence

471

disease risk. Arboviral epidemiology is further complicated by humanitarian crises (e.g.

472

Venezuela) and the COVID-19 pandemic which reinforces the urgency for understanding the

473

dynamics of these global health problems. Context dependent and actionable understanding

474

of the drivers for disease transmission that consider local dynamics, both climatic and socio-

475

economic, should contribute to the design of more effective vector mosquito control

476

programmes.

divisions (departments).
Departments are the largest units of local government answerable to the country’s national
government. (A) Department of Antioquia governs Bello which is denoted as a small blue
area. (B) Department of Norte de Santander has as its capital Cúcuta, a city (red) to the East
of this department that shares the border with Venezuela. (C) Department of Boyacá has the
municipality of Moniquirá (green).
