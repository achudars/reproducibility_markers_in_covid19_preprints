Abstract: We conducted a comparative study of COVID-19 epidemic in three different settings:
mainland China, the Guangdong province of China and South Korea, by formulating two disease
transmission dynamics models incorporating epidemic characteristics and setting-specific
interventions, and fitting the models to multi-source data to identify initial and effective
reproduction numbers and evaluate effectiveness of interventions. We estimated the initial basic
reproduction number for South Korea, the Guangdong province and mainland China as 2.6 (95%
confidence interval (CI): (2.5, 2.7)), 3.0 (95%CI: (2.6, 3.3)) and 3.8 (95%CI: (3.5,4.2)),
respectively, given a serial interval with mean of 5 days with standard deviation of 3 days. We
found that the effective reproduction number for the Guangdong province and mainland China has
fallen below the threshold 1 since February 8th and 18th respectively, while the effective
reproduction number for South Korea remains high, suggesting that the interventions implemented
need to be enhanced in order to halt further infections. We also project the epidemic trend in South
Korea under different scenarios where a portion or the entirety of the integrated package of
interventions in China is used. We show that a coherent and integrated approach with stringent
public health interventions is the key to the success of containing the epidemic in China and
specially its provinces outside its epicenter, and we show that this approach can also be effective
to mitigate the burden of the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea. The experience of outbreak
control in mainland China should be a guiding reference for the rest of the world including South
Korea.

Introduction
Coronavirus, an enveloped virus characterized by a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA, causes
generally mild infections but occasionally lethal communicable disorders leading to SARS,
MERS1 and the current COVID-19 outbreak2,3 that has gradually spread out from the epicenter
Wuhan/China and affected 103 countries/territories and international conveyances including the
cruise ship Diamond Princess harbored in Yokohama/Japan as of March 7th 2020.
In the absence of effective treatments and vaccines, an early adoption of stringent public health
measures is crucial in mitigating the scale and burden of an outbreak. Unprecedented restrictive
measures, including travel restrictions, contact tracing, quarantine and lock-down of entire
towns/cities adopted by the Chinese authorities have resulted in a significant reduction of the
effective reproductive number of COVID-194,5. However, these public health interventions may
not be considered and/or implemented as effectively in other settings and contexts.
Decision-making and implementations may require adaptations and modifications to take into
account setting-specific characteristics in terms of community features, local epidemiology and
risk assessment, social habits, juridical provisions, organizational coordination, and availability of
economic-financial resources. For instance, particularly restrictive measures may not be effective
in certain countries6.
Several public health interventions can be implemented to counteract the threat posed by an
emerging outbreak7 with pandemic potential. These interventions can be basically classified into
two major categories: the measures of the first category are aimed at protecting the borders and
include interventions like travel restrictions and border entry screening, whereas the measures of
the second category have the objective of locally controlling the spreading of the virus and include
enhanced epidemiological surveys and surveillance, contact tracing, school closure and other
interventions that favor a reduction in number of social contacts. The effectiveness of such
measures from both group is variable and some is still under debate. Regarding, for example,
extensive travel restrictions, a recent systematic review has shown that this intervention may
contribute to delaying but not preventing the transmission and diffusion of a viral outbreak. As
such, it is not recommended for implementation, if not within a broader package of public health
measures aimed at rapidly containing the outbreak8. A similar conclusion can be reached for
border entry screening, considered as ineffective or poorly effective per se, and therefore needs to
be combined and provided together with other strategies9. School closure appears to be potentially
effective in containing/reducing viral outbreaks, although further research is warranted to identify
the best strategy in terms of timing and length of closure10. The measure of quarantine is also
particularly controversial, since it raises ethical dilemmas, and political and social concerns11,12
and quantification of its real impact11 is difficult due to a high uncertainty in its efficacy. However,

in the absence of effective medical interventions, these measures must be implemented and the
success of these measures, despite their disruptive impact on social-economic activities, depends
heavily on how these measures are adapted to the specific scenario, in terms not only of clinical
and epidemiological variables but also of social aspects, including social habits, juridical
provisions, and economic-financial resources.
How differentiation and combination of these interventions within a coherent and systematic
package of public health measures contributes to different outbreak outcomes is an urgent global
health issue that must be addressed in order to ensure that lessons from countries that have early
experienced COVID-19 outbreak can be learnt by other countries in their preparedness and
management of a likely pandemic.
In South Korea, the first COVID-19 case (a 36 years old Chinese woman, with a recent travel
history to Wuhan) was reported on January 8th 2020. A severe cluster of cases emerged in the city
of Daegu, where on February 23rd 2020 a 61 years old woman spread the virus to hundreds of
worshippers at Shincheonji Church of Jesus. On March 5th 2020, a further cluster of cases
occurred at a nursing home in Gyeongsan, which has been declared “special care zone” in an
effort to contain the viral outbreak. As of March 8th 2020, South Korea has reported 7,313 cases,
with 130 total recovered cases and 50 deaths, with no sign that the epidemic is slowing down.
In comparison, intensive social contacts and massive mobility associated with the Chinese
Traditional Spring Festival, combined with an initial delay in responding to the outbreak, resulted
in an exponential growth of infections in the (then) epicenter (Wuhan) and large case importations
to other Chinese cities. On January 23rd 2020, the Chinese government decisively implemented a
systematic package of measures in the epicenter, including the lock-down/quarantine of Wuhan
city and other cities/towns of the Hubei province, intense contact tracing and isolation. This led to
rapid and effective mitigation of the COVID-19 epidemic. Case importation before the January
23rd lock-down also resulted in outbreaks in all Chinese provinces, but the systematic package of
interventions implemented across the country led to effective containment. On March 8th 2020, the
newly confirmed cases in the entire country reduced to 40.
Particularly, Guangdong, the province with the largest population in China at present, with GDP
ranked first since 1989 and with the level of middle and upper income countries and middle
developed countries, reported the first confirmed COVID-19 case on January 19th. On January 23rd,
the government of Guangdong province announced the first-level response to major public health
emergencies for controlling the spread of COVID-19. As of March 8th, there are totally 1325
confirmed cases and 8 deaths in Guangdong province, and no new case is reported. In contrast to
South Korea, there was a relatively large ratio of imported cases in Guangdong province,
particularly, in Shenzhen (a mega city in Guangdong province) more than 70 percent of the

confirmed cases are imported13.
What differences in the intervention design and implementation between China and South Korea,
and between Korea and Guangdong have contributed to the different epidemic curves, and what
projection can we make about the epidemic trend in South Korea under different scenarios if a
portion or the entirety of the Chinese package of public health interventions is applied to the South
Korea? These are the questions we aim to answer by developing mathematical models tailored to
different settings, including the entire country of China and its Guangdong province and South
Korea.

Methods
Data
We obtained data of the confirmed COVID-19 cases, cumulative number of quarantined
individuals, cumulative death cases in mainland China from the “National Health Commission” of
the People’s Republic of China14. Data information includes the newly reported cases, the
cumulative number of reported confirmed cases, the cumulative number of cured cases and the
number of death cases, as shown in Figure 1(A-C). In addition, we obtained the data of the
cumulative confirmed cases, cumulative cured cases and daily cases under medical observation for
the Guangdong province (Figure 1(E)) of China. We also obtained the data of cumulative
confirmed cases and cumulative tested cases for South Korea from the Korea Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (KCDC)15,16, as shown in Figure 1(D), (F). The data were released and
analyzed anonymously. Note that the first confirmed case was reported on January 23rd 2020 for
South Korea, and also on January 23rd 2020 mainland China started the lock-down of Wuhan city,
the epicenter, and implemented other interventions. Note that the data for reported cases, either
confirmed or quarantined, or under medical observation or tested, was used in China or South
Korea since January 23rd 2020.

The model
Our baseline model is the classical deterministic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR)
epidemic model refined by incorporating contact tracing-quarantine-test-isolation strategies
(Figure

agreement of model predictions with real data provides a validation of the model structure
reflecting the interventions implemented in Wuhan and in mainland China. Here, we add an
additional quarantined suspected compartment, which consists of exposed infectious individuals
resulting from contact tracing and individuals with common fever. These individuals with
common fever but quarantined as COVID-19 suspected contributed to the difficulty of
implementing an effective quarantine process due to the size of this compartment. In what follows,
exposure, transmission and infection compartments are always used for modeling the COVID-19.
In our model formulation, the transmission probability is denoted by β and the contact rate is
denoted by c. By enforcing contact tracing, a proportion,

can infect susceptible individuals. We use constant m to denote the transition rate from the

illness-like symptoms. The suspected individuals leave this compartment at a rate

The prevention and control interventions were gradually improved in mainland China, and there
are several key time points when mitigation measures were gradually strengthened: 1) On January
23rd Wuhan was locked down, and most parts of China shortly adopted a similar strategy; 2) On
January 26th , the government announced to extend the Chinese Traditional New Year Festival
holiday so self-isolation/protection was maximized; 3) On February 7th the Chinese government
created the partnership between each one of the 16 provinces to its sister-city in the epicenter, the
Hubei province, to reinforce the health care workers and equipment in the sister-city in Hubei; 4)
On February 12th the Hubei province started to include the clinically diagnosed cases into the
confirmed cases to enhance its quarantine/isolation measure; 5) On February 14th , Wuhan refined
its management protocol of residential quarters; 6) On February 16th, the National Health
Commission of the People’s Republic of China revised its New Coronavirus Pneumonia
Prevention and Control Plan to further clarify and enhance the public health interventions in four
key areas: Quarantine high-risk individuals as much as possible，Test suspected individuals as
much as possible；Treat patients as best as possible；and Receive and cure all the patients.

estimated to be 3.8 (95%CI: (3.5, 4.2)), 3.0 (95%CI: (2.6, 3.3)) and 2.6 (95%CI: (2.5, 2.7)),
respectively. In particular, the initial COVID-19 reproduction rate in South Korea was smaller
than that in the Guangdong Province.
In order to investigate the variation of

with respect to the serial interval, we carry out a

sensitivity analysis by changing the mean of the serial interval from 4 to 8 days, the standard
deviation (Std) from 3 to 5. The sensitivity analysis is reported in Table 2, and we notice that
increases when the mean of the serial interval increases and we remark that serial interval
examined by recent studies is shorter than that earlier estimation22-24. It also follows from Table 2
that increasing Std of the serial interval only slightly decreases the estimated

for a given mean

of the serial interval.
We also estimate the effective reproduction numbers

for the considered regions, using the

number of daily newly reported cases from the date the first case was reported until March 2nd
2020 (Figure 3). It shows that the effective reproduction number

in mainland China and in its

Guandong province has fallen below the threshold 1 since February 18th and February 7th, while
the effective reproduction number of South Korea remains very high, indicating that there is still
room for improving the interventions in South Korea.

Model-based prediction and interventions efficacy evaluation
By simultaneously fitting the model (C1) to the multiple source data on the cumulative number of
reported cases, deaths, quarantined and suspected cases in mainland China, we obtain estimations
for unknown parameters and initial conditions, listed in Table 1. The best fitting result is shown as
black curves in Figure 5 with the estimated baseline exponential decreasing rate (

) in the

contact rate function. We then conduct a sensitivity analysis of the cumulative reported, death,
quarantined, suspected cases, and the infected (asymptomatic/symptomatic) individuals by
shrinking the exponential index

, representing the weakening of the control interventions

relevant to the contact rate. As shown in Figure 5, the numbers of cumulative reported, death,
quarantined, suspected cases, and the peak value of the infected all increase significantly. In
particular, with

corresponding to no reduction of the contact rate from the initial period,

the cumulative confirmed cases increases by more than six times as of April 1st (~600,000 cases)
and the peak value of the infected will increase by more than 3 times, in comparison with the
actual situation under the strong control measures implemented by the Chinese government.
We also conduct a sensitivity analysis regarding the detection rate
of

, by decreasing the value

. We obtain a similar conclusion that the cumulative confirmed cases would reach the

number of 350,000 cases as of April 1st with a constant detection rate (no improvement of

detection), shown in Figure 6. As illustrated in Figure 6(F), we can observe that while decreasing
the detection rate would not affect the decreasing trend of the effective reproduction number, it
however postpones the time when the threshold value of 1 is reached. Therefore the outcome in
the mainland China, both in terms of the infections avoided and the timing when the outbreak
begins to be under control, is the consequence of a systematic package of social distancing
(self-isolation and self-protection), contacting tracing, and detection/diagnosis.
Similarly, by simultaneously fitting the proposed model (K1) to the cumulative number of reported
and tested cases for South Korea, we obtain the estimations for the unknown parameters and initial
conditions, listed in Table 1. The best fitting result is shown as black curves in Figure 7 with the
estimated constant contact, testing and detection rates. For the purpose of a comparative study, we
simulate the situation in South Korea by importing some of the interventions and measures
implemented in the mainland China. We focus on the cases when we can 1) replace the contact
rate and detection rate estimated in the (K1) model from the South Korea data with the
time-dependent rate function (C3), and 2). adopt the time-dependent testing rate similarly to the
quarantined rate function q(t) in (C3) to use
(K3)
with parameters

to indicate the initial and maximal testing rate. We report the simulations

in four scenarios:
Scenario A: Using the testing rate function in (K3), representing an enhanced testing strategy,
the cumulative tested and confirmed cases significantly increase, and the cumulative
confirmed cases will reach 300 thousands on April 5th 2020 (red curves, Figure 7(C-D)).
Scenario B: Using only the detection rate function in (C3), the cumulative tested and
confirmed cases increase too, and the cumulative confirmed cases will reach 200 thousands
on April 5th 2020 (green curves, Figure 7(C-D)).
Scenario C: Using only the contact rate function in (C3), the cumulative confirmed cases will
reach 100 thousands on April 5th 2020 (blue curves, Figure 7(C-D)).
Scenario D: Using the time-dependent contact, detection and testing rate functions,
representing an integrated systematic package of public health control strategies, the
cumulative confirmed cases will reach around 60 thousands on April 5th 2020 (black curves,
Figure 7(C-D)).
We conclude that a significant reduction of COVID-19 cases is achievable only through a

Similarly, by simultaneously fitting the model (C1) to the multiple source data on the cumulative
number of reported cases, recovery and suspected cases of Guangdong province, we parameterize
the model and obtain the estimations for the unknown parameters and initial conditions, listed in
Table 1. The best fitting result is shown as green curves in Figure 8. Similarly, we consider the
variation in the epidemic by means of the parameter

, representing the variation in the intensity

of the control measures implemented. It follows from Figure 8(A-C) that increasing the parameter
reduces the disease infections and the number of suspected individuals, while decreasing the
parameter

(to zero) slightly affects the disease infections, shown in green curves (

red curves (

) and

) in Figure 8(A-C). This conversely implies that the prevention and control

strategies in Guangdong province were relatively strong from the early stage of the outbreak. This
can also be confirmed by the continuously declining trend of the effective reproduction number, as
shown in Figure 3 and 8(D). Again, we performed the sensitivity analysis by decreasing the value
of

in the detection rate

and obtained similar results, as shown in Figure 9.

Discussion
After some initial delay in the response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Chinese government
started implementing drastic public health measures on January 23rd 2020, including the
lock-down of Wuhan city, contact tracing/quarantine/isolation. This decisive and systematically
implemented package of interventions has contributed to rapid mitigation, providing a window of
opportunity for the preparedness, prevention and control of COVID-19 in other Chinese cities and
around the world. As we showed in this modeling study, a systematic approach incorporating
coherent and complementary public health measures rapidly implemented is the key for containing
the viral outbreak.
In this study, we formulated a dynamic model and parameterized it by using multi-source data for
different settings, like South Korea, China and Guandong province. We predicted that the trend of
cumulative reported cases would be very serious, reaching around 600 thousands as of April 1st
2020 given no control measures being implemented. Hence a comparison with the current
COVID-19 epidemic: the cumulative reported cases are around 80,651 as of March 6th, 2020,
indicating the efficacy of the ongoing strengthening of prevention and control measures in
mainland China.
In Guangdong, the province with the largest population in China, most cases at the initial phase of
the COVID-19 outbreak are imported, and immediately after the lockdown of Wuhan on January
23rd 2020, the province implemented a systematic approach towards prevention and control with

gradual enhancement leading to the effective control of otherwise potentially catastrophic
outcomes.
In comparison with South Korea, Guangdong has more inhabitants and a less developed economy.
Also, from our model-free estimation, the basic reproduction number in South Korea is less than
that computed for the Guangdong province. Therefore, the COVID-19 epidemic potential in South
Korea was initially weaker than that in Guangdong. However, our model-based analysis also
shows that the effective reproduction number in South Korea remains greater than 1 while the
epidemic in the Guangdong province has already been under control. Our simulation results
indicate that the COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea will change from a quick to a slow increase
if the integrated control measures are implemented, as illustrated in Figure 7(C). Hence, the
experience of epidemic control in mainland China is worth popularizing, especially for the
reference of Western countries and other settings, including South Korea.
More in detail, a comparison of the parameter estimations of the Guangdong province and the
entire country China shows that
(1) the initial and maximum quarantine rates in Guangdong were much higher than those in
the entire country China, while the initial and minimum contact rates were lower than those in the
country, contributing to the observed better control effect in the province than the national
average.
(2) the confirmation ratios of the Guangdong province and South Korea were much lower
than the ratio of the entire country China, indicating the better efficiency of contact tracing and
testing in the Guangdong province and South Korea than that in the entire country of China.
(3) the constant contact rate in South Korea was larger than that in the Guangdong province
and even the entire country of China, with an even bigger minimum contact rate in South Korea,
suggesting the need of raising the awareness of the importance of self-isolation and
self-protection.
Carrying out the sensitivity analysis of confirmed cases of China and Guangdong province with
respect to the contact rate function, this suggests the effectiveness of the control measures
implemented in South Korea. Other countries or territories experiencing large-scale outbreaks of
COVID-19 should capitalize on this lesson: convincing all the citizens to stay at home by
self-isolation and become aware of the implications of self-protection is of crucial importance.
Similarly, the detection rate

province. Therefore, improving the diagnose rate of the infectious individual is also fundamental
for controlling the spreading of COVID-19 epidemic in Korea.
