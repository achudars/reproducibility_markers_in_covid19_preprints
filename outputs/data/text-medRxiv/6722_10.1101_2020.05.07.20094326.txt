Abstract
In a search to find effective treatments for COVID-19, chloroquine and
hydroxychloroquine have gained attention. We aim to provide evidence to support
clinical decision-making regarding medication for the treatment of COVID-19 by
carrying out a systematic review of the literature. The electronic databases
MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, and HMIC were searched up to April 2020.
Eligible study outcomes included: extubation or patient recovery. Relevant data were
extracted and analysed by narrative synthesis. Our results included six studies in the
review of which four studies were of good or fair quality. All eligible studies included
were for coronavirus involving the use of either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine to
treat common symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue.
Outcomes most commonly reported were improved lung function, viral clearance,
and hospital discharge. Strong evidence to support the use of chloroquine and
hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 is lacking. Fast track trials are
riddled with bias and may not conform to rigorous guidelines which may lead to
inadequate data being reported. The use of these drugs in combination with other
medications may be useful but without knowing which groups they are suited for and
when they may cause more harm than good.

Introduction
As the COVID-19 pandemic has streaked around the plant, the pursuit for therapeutic
options has developed at a fast pace. Coronaviruses are not new. In the past two
decades, the virus was responsible for previous outbreaks of Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).
Yet despite this experience, no clear treatment pathway had been agreed in some
countries. Therefore, this current pandemic of a variant novel virus has taken the world
by surprise with the only option of delivering empirical treatment at the early stages,
until a vaccine is available.

In a search to find effective treatments for COVID-19, chloroquine (CQ) and
hydroxychloroquine have entered the spotlight (1). Current evidence comes from
poorly controlled clinical trials demonstrating antiviral activity against severe-acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (2). Systematic reviews of variable
quality have started to appear focusing on current patients without looking at past
evidence with other viruses of the same family (3). To date, no systematic reviews
have been published examining the clinical effectiveness of chloroquine and
hydroxychloroquine in the context of the current pandemic or of past treatment for
patients with severe coronavirus respiratory infections.

Past outbreaks of coronaviruses have documented some useful treatments including
chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. These compounds are used to treat malaria,
systemic lupus erythematosus and other rheumatic diseases. Chloroquine increases
endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion and interferes with the glycosylation of
cellular receptors of SARS-CoV (4). Authors Wang et al. (5) reported that chloroquine

functions at both entry and post-entry stages of the 2019-nCoV and in addition to its
antiviral activity, has an immune-modulating effect (5). The 90% effective
concentration (EC90) value of chloroquine against the 2019-nCoV in vitro, was
demonstrated to be clinically achievable in the plasma of rheumatoid arthritis patients
who received 500 mg (6). The metabolism of chloroquine after oral administration
occurs mostly in the liver. Its excretion is slow and maintains a plasma half‐life of 2.5
to 10 days. Furthermore, individuals with impaired or compromised liver function at
baseline (e.g. ventilated patients in ITU with multiple fat-soluble infusions running) are
more likely to experience accumulation in-vivo and require close monitoring of liver
function test and risk of liver failure. The adult acute lethal dose of chloroquine is
between two to four grams in ages 18 to 65, according to the Wuhan Institute of
Virology (7).

The study does not to stop at what medication is appropriate but also requires knowing
when it is better to start treatment. From SARS we know that clinical worsening of
individuals in Week 2 is apparently more related to immunopathological damage than
to uncontrolled coronavirus replication (8). Keyaerts et al. (9) observed that
chloroquine displayed significant anti-SARS-CoV activity (9), but that inhibitory
capability sharply declined if not administered within five-hour post infection (9). Yet,
advantages of chloroquine such as low cost and well-established safety could allow
its use as prophylaxis in individuals at high risk such as healthcare workers (10).

The aim of this research is to report the existent clinical evidence of chloroquine and
hydroxychloroquine effectiveness, either alone or in combination, in the recovery of

human patients infected with coronavirus respiratory infections. In addition, difference
in dosages and treatment initiation times will be analysed.

Materials and Methods
Literature search
Literature searches with medical electronic databases were conducted for studies
published from 1950 onwards: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, and HMIC.
Please refer to S1 file for an example of our search strategy.

Figure 1. PRISMA flow diagram of search strategy showing different phases of the
selection process.

Eligibility criteria
Studies on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in treatment for
coronavirus respiratory symptoms, on human patients (children or adults) diagnosed
with SARS, MERS, COVID-19. Studies needed to include at least one of the
following outcomes: elimination of active infection (detected in blood or swabs),
recovery understood as no active infection or reduction of symptoms to an
acceptable level for discharge or extubation from ventilators. Only studies with full
text available in English were included. Studies conducted solely in healthy subjects
or for the common cold were excluded, as were rapid reviews, narrative reviews,
comments, opinion pieces, methodological reports, editorials, letters and conference
abstracts. Non-human studies such as mice or in-vitro cultures were also excluded.
The search included MeSH terms.

Screening and selection
Study selection was conducted by two reviewers independently. Title and abstract
screening followed by full texts were performed using Covidence software against
eligibility criteria. After deduplication, each reviewer summarised results and
compared. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion. Discrepancies were
resolved by consensus. This systematic review was conducted according to the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)
guidelines (Please see S1 file: Table 4).

Data extraction
Selected studies were exported, stored and tracked on the computer software
reference manager Zotero. Data relevant to the study question were extracted from
included studies and summarized. Information on author, study design, associated
with the treatment of coronavirus using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine was
collected.

Assessment of study quality and risk bias
The quality of the primary studies was assessed by three reviewers and scored
using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) quality assessment tools
for controlled intervention studies, observational studies, and systematic reviews
(11). For quality assessment in case reports and case series, Murad et al. (12) tool
was used. Studies were not excluded based on quality assessment. Studies were
critically appraised for risk of bias.

Outcome measures
Outcomes such as extubation from ventilators or patient recovery. The latter defined
as no active infection in either blood or swabs; or reduction of symptoms to an
acceptable level for patient discharge from hospital.

Data synthesis and analysis
Due to methodological heterogeneity and varying clinical outcome measures
reported across studies, a meta-analysis of results was not performed. A narrative
synthesis of the finding was conducted.

Results
Characteristics of selected studies
The search identified 575 papers, of which six studies met the eligibility criteria
(Please see S2 file: Figure 1): two systematic reviews (13,14), one randomised
control trial (15), one non-randomised clinical trial (16), one an observational cohort
study (17), and one case report (18). Study characteristics are summarised in Table
1.

Effectiveness of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in treatment
of coronavirus
The clinical study by Huang et al. (15) demonstrated that patients treated with
chloroquine (500 mg orally, twice daily for 10 days) appear to show better patient
recovery compared with those patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir. As a result,
the patients treated with chloroquine were discharged from hospital earlier. Table 1
summarises the results of eligible studies on the effectiveness of drugs in treating
infected coronavirus patients.

In the study by Gautret et al. (16) 70% of patients treated with 600 mg of
hydroxychloroquine (200 mg, three times per day for 10 days) were virologically cured
at day six post inclusion, compared to 12.5% of patients in the control group (p=0.001).
In another group, 100% of Patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin
were virologically cured at day 6 post inclusion compared with 57.1% patients treated
with hydroxychloroquine alone, and 12.5% in the control group (p<0.001). Gautret et
al. (17) carried out a cohort study where they looked at the outcomes of patients treated
with a combination of hydroxychloroquine sulfate (200 mg, three times per day for 10
days for four days) and antibiotic azithromycin (500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg
per day for next four days), reporting positive results from the study. A broad-spectrum
antibiotic (ceftriaxone) was added in those who developed pneumonia.

The case report study by Spezzani et al. (18) reported that patients treated with
darunavir/cobicistat and hydroxychloroquine (200 mg, twice daily) in combination with
a triple antibiotic therapy (levofloxacin, piperacillin plus tazobactam) had a better
outcome compared to darunavir/cobicistat and hydroxychloroquine combined with
double therapy of ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Both Italian patients started treatment
at admission, seven days after initial symptoms. Despite this, the couple achieved
remission on different weeks as the course of the disease differed due to individual
risk factors. Patient one had metastatic breast cancer and recent exposure to
antineoplastic chemotherapy which had produced leukopenia (immunosuppression)
at admission, whereas there was no hint of a significant immunosuppression of patient
two. However, patient one had a rapid recovery compared to a prolonged and more
severe course compared to patient two who had a relatively low risk profile except for
hypertension.

The systematic review by Singh et al. (13) looked at the effects of hydroxychloroquine
and its impact on COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes in resource constrained
settings with reference to India. They provide the current dosage guidelines on
chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine use from China, South Korea, United States,
Netherlands, Canada, and Belgium for the treatment of COVID-19 using chloroquine
and hydroxychloroquine (13). Dosage recommendations for adults from each of these
sources vary depending on the severity of the cases. Based on the results of the study,
the authors conclude that because of its limited side effects, availability, and costeffectiveness, the drugs should be worthy for fast track clinical trials for treatment of
COVID-19. However, another systematic review by Sarma et al. (14) found that when
compared to conventional treatment, there was no difference observed in virological
cure, death, clinical worsening of disease, or safety. The main benefit was that
treatment with hydroxychloroquine alone resulted in a lower number of cases showing
radiological progression of lung disease. Additional benefits included less days to
temperature normalisation and lowered total cough days compared to conventional
treatment. The authors recommended that more data is acquired before making a
definitive conclusion on the safety and effectiveness of the drugs.

Discussion
The results of this systematic review indicate a positive trend favouring the use of
chloroquine singularly or the combination of hydroxychloroquine with antibiotic therapy
(regardless of added bacterial infection at the beginning of the treatment). Evidence
was insufficient to favour a treatment start on Week one versus Week two (or vice

versa) of symptoms appearing. However, Spezzani et al. (18) showed that
immunosuppression may actually enhance treatment effectiveness by the use of the
combination of hydroxychloroquine, antibiotic therapy and darunavir/cobicistat in
patients who started treatment seven days after initial symptoms.
These findings have implications for clinical practice and policy in the current
pandemic.

and

with other diseases who are currently taking these drugs (19).
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are usually safe and well tolerated in normal
dosage but can be extremely toxic in overdose. Potential adverse effects that should
be considered before prescribing include prolongation of the QT interval (especially in
pre-existing cardiac disease or if combined with azithromycin), hypo-glycemia,
neuropsychiatric effects, drug–drug interactions and idiosyncratic hypersensitivity
reactions (20). Moreover, chloroquine is not as widely available as hydroxychloroquine
in some countries and is associated with greater adverse effects such as interaction
with lopinavir/ritonavir, resulting in prolongation of the QT interval (21).

Strengths and limitations
To our knowledge, this systematic review is the first attempt to gather evidence from
fully published studies that focus on the treatment, to date, of coronavirus outbreaks
in human subjects. Contrasting to ours, previous research explores the suitability of
either chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine in treating coronavirus by relying on
findings from animal studies and dosage recommendations from unpublished trials.
Our search identified six eligible studies. Two scored highly in the methodological
quality assessment. This may be due to small sample size, unclear or absent

randomisation, concealment, blinding, ambiguous research question and objectives
to help readers understand the purpose of the studies.

Comparison with existing literature
Two studies (15,16) outline key information on socio-demographic and clinical
characteristics; both used comparison groups to test the effectiveness of the drugs.
Patients were tested before hospital admission and then prior to being administered
the specific dosage of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. In both studies, patients
were monitored and given treatment for 10 days with reported outcomes focused on
viral clearance and lung improvement. Our review also included a case-report (18)
identifying two patients from the same household discharged from hospital following
combination therapy of antibiotics and hydroxychloroquine (18).

The results found no previous research on treatments using hydroxychloroquine or
chloroquine targeting coronavirus such as SARS and MERS, except for COVID-19.
More recent studies try to highlight the mechanisms of COVID-19 in animal studies
and in cell cultures. The most cited successful human subject trials regarding the
effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine were from China and France,
by Gao et al. (22) and Gautret et al. (16). A recent published review focused on
understanding the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in treating
COVID-19 (23), but includes articles that have not had their results formally
published. These articles focus mostly on COVID-19 treatments (23) and do not
consider work done previously on coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS. The
publication by Gao et al. (22) merely provides a list of ongoing trials, which is why it
did not meet the eligibility criteria for this review. Our review included two additional

systematic reviews and a case-report which met our inclusion criteria (13,14,18). A summary of past and ongoing trials found across
the included studies can be consulted in Table 2.

Implications for research and practice
At this stage of the pandemic, it is difficult to debate the treatment options for COVID19. There are many ideas and theories being considered about this novel virus and
currently clinicians lack the necessary evidence to effectively treat the infection. There
may be a genetic influence with regards to susceptibility to the virus. However,
contracting COVID-19 is multifactorial and it is important to investigate the exposure
and host factors which put people at risk of infection. For example, it is unknown at
what dosage the infectious particles begin to overwhelm the host’s immune system.
This may inadvertently affect those in close contact with asymptomatic individuals.
Thus, inadvertent exposure is a strong risk factor for infection. In such cases, social
distancing may mitigate infection. Age, sex, ethnicity, and socio-economic
backgrounds also need to be considered as potential risk factors when sampling from
the population. Understanding the impact comorbidities such as cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity have on coronavirus infection is
important in finding suitable treatments for COVID-19.

Recent public and media attention in many countries on the use chloroquine and
hydroxychloroquine has increased focus on repurposing the drugs to combat the
COVID-19 pandemic. This has prompted the World Health Organisation to reconsider
leaving both drugs out from a large trial to study the effectiveness and safety of
promising medications suitable for treating COVID-19 patients (24). Other institutions
have also began launching fast track trials to understand whether they help in the
recovery time and outcomes, but these types of studies come with issues of design
bias which is unlikely to provide important data on the true effects of the drugs. Without
essential data to provide key information about the suitability of these compounds in

different populations, it will difficult to provide them to those who need them the most.
Future research should adhere to the rigorous standard guidelines for the randomised
control and observational cohort studies as best as possible, so that valuable and
unbiased information is provided on these medications.

Conclusion
The current evidence that exists on real human patients is weak despite effectiveness
shown in in-vitro cultures for past coronavirus outbreaks and with the COVID-19
variant. It is unclear if there is an effect on the effectiveness, depending on early or
late stage of administration. Nevertheless, recent clinical trials suggest a more positive
outcome for those patients treated with chloroquine singularly or hydroxychloroquine
combinations. Off-label use of these drugs for COVID-19 could raise the demand
which would require a counterbalance in production. Otherwise, this may lead to a
negative impact for those treated for malaria, lupus and other rheumatic diseases.
Further randomised trials are needed urgently.

Status
Ongoing

Highlights
This trial is not yet published and only available in a letter form,
interestingly, this early result led China to include chloroquine in the
prevention and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia

They used In this study,
chloroquine was given in
dose of 500 mg of
chloroquine twice daily in
mild to severe COVID-19
pneumonia

Outcome
Chloroquine phosphate seems
superior to the control
treatment in inhibiting the
exacerbation of pneumonia,
improving lung imaging
findings, promoting a virus
negative conversion, and
shortening the disease
course according to the news
briefing.

Open-label, nonrandomized trial (n = 36)
oral hydroxychloroquine
sulfate 200 mg, three
times per day during ten
days. A total of 26
patients received
hydroxychloroquine and
16 were control patients

HCQ alone and combination
of HCQ plus azithromycin was
highly and significantly
effective in clearing viral
nasopharyngeal carriage
(measured by polymerase
chain reaction [PCR]) in only
three-to six days in COVID-19
subjects, compared to control

First
results

The virological clearance day-6 post-inclusion (primary outcome) with HCQ
vs. control was 70.0% versus 12.5%, respectively (p = 0.001).

Uncontrolled, noncomparative,
observational study
(n=80)
Combination of 200mg of
oral hydroxychloroquine
sulfate, three times per
day for ten days combined
with azithromycin (500mg
on day 1 followed by 250
mg per day for the next
four days).

The majority (65/80, 81.3%)
of patients had favourable
outcome and were discharged
from the unit. Only 15%
required oxygen therapy
during their stay in our ID
ward.

First
results

Note: a small sample size, dropout of six patients and limited follow-up,
apart from the non-randomized and open-label nature of the trial.

Three patients were transferred to the ICU, of whom two improved and
were then returned to the ID ward. One 74 year-old patient was still in ICU
at the time of writing. Finally, one 86 year-old patient who was not
transferred to the ICU, died in the ID ward
