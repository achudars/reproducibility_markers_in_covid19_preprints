Abstract

34

We evaluated the effectiveness of personal protective measures, including mask-wearing,

35

handwashing, and social distancing, against COVID-19 infection among contacts of cases. We

36

conducted a case-control study with 211 cases and 839 non-matched controls using all contact

37

tracing records of Thailand’s national Surveillance and Rapid Response Team. Cases were

38

asymptomatic contacts of COVID-19 patients identified between 1 and 31 March 2020 who were

39

diagnosed with COVID-19 by 21 April 2020; controls were asymptomatic contacts who were not

40

diagnosed with COVID-19. Participants were queried about practices during contact periods with

41

a case. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for

42

associations between diagnosis of COVID-19 and covariates using multivariable logistic

43

regression models. Wearing masks all the time during contact was independently associated with

44

lower risk of COVID-19 infection compared to not wearing masks (aOR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09–

45

0.60), while sometimes wearing masks during contact was not (aOR 0.87, 95% CI 0.41–1.84).

46

Maintaining at least 1 meter distance from a COVID patient (aOR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04–0.63),

47

duration of close contact ≤15 minutes versus longer (aOR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07–0.90), and

48

handwashing often (aOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.13–0.87) were significantly associated with lower risk

49

of infection. Type of mask was not independently associated with infection. Those who wore

50

masks all the time also were more likely to practice social distancing. Our findings suggest

51

consistent wearing of masks, handwashing, and social distancing in public to protect against

52

COVID-19 infection.

Introduction

54

Evaluation of the effectiveness of mask-wearing by healthy persons in the general public against

55

COVID-19 infection is urgently needed (1, 2). On 27 February 2020, during the early stages of

56

the COVID-19 outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced “For asymptomatic

57

individuals, wearing a mask of any type is not recommended” (3). The rationale, at that time,

58

was to avoid unnecessary cost, procurement burden, and a false sense of security (3). A number

59

of systematic reviews found no conclusive evidence to support widespread use of masks in

60

public against respiratory infectious diseases, such as influenza and SARS (4-6). However,

61

China and many countries in Asia including South Korea, Japan, and Thailand have

62

recommended the use of face masks among the general public since early in the outbreak (7).

63

There is evidence that COVID-19 patients can have a “pre-symptomatic” period, during which

64

infected persons can be contagious and, therefore, transmit the virus to others before symptoms

65

develop (8). These findings led to a change in recommendations from the US Centers for Disease

66

Control and Prevention on 4 April 2020 that advised all persons to wear a cloth face covering

67

when in public (9). On 6 April and 5 June 2020, WHO updated its advice on the use of masks for

68

the general public, and encouraged countries that issue the recommendations to conduct research

69

on this topic (8).

70

Thailand has been implementing multiple measures against transmission of COVID-19 since the

71

beginning of the outbreak (10, 11). The country established thermal screening at airports on 3

72

January 2020, and detected the first case of COVID-19 outside China—a traveler from Wuhan

73

arriving at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport—on 8 January 2020 (10). The country utilizes

74

Surveillance and Rapid Response Teams (SRRTs), together with village health volunteers, to

75

conduct contact tracing, educate the public about the disease, and monitor the close contacts of

76

COVID-19 patients in quarantine (11). SRRTs are epidemiologic investigation teams trained to

77

conduct surveillance, investigations, and initial controls of communicable diseases including

78

influenza H5N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory

79

syndrome (12, 13). Currently, there are more than 1,000 SRRTs established at district, provincial,

80

and regional levels in Thailand (12) working on COVID-19 contact tracing.

81

By February 2020, public pressure to wear masks in Thailand was high, medical masks had

82

become difficult for the public to procure, and the government had categorized medical masks as

83

price-controlled goods and announced COVID-19 as a dangerous communicable disease

84

according to the Communicable Disease Act 2015. These developments empowered officials to

85

quarantine contacts and close public venues (14, 15). On 3 March, the Thai Ministry of Public

86

Health (MoPH) announced that public use of cloth face masks were recommended (16). On 18

87

March, schools, universities, bars, nightclubs and entertainment venues were closed (17). On 26

88

March, when the country was reporting ~100–150 new COVID-19 patients per day, the

89

government declared a national state of emergency, prohibited public gatherings, and enforced

90

wearing of face masks by all persons on public transport (18). On 21 April, 19 new PCR-

91

confirmed COVID-19 patients were announced by MoPH, bringing the total number of patients

92

to 2,811 (18).

93

Given the current lack of evidence, we sought to evaluate the effectiveness of mask wearing,

94

handwashing, social distancing, and other preventive measures against COVID-19 infection in

95

Thailand.

98

We conducted a retrospective case-control study in which both cases and controls were drawn

99

from a cohort of contact tracing records of the central SRRT team at the Department of Disease

100

Control (DDC), MoPH, Thailand (Figure 1). Contacts were defined by the DDC MoPH as

101

individuals who had activities together with or were in the same location(s) as a COVID-19

102

patient (19, 20). The main aim of contact tracing was to identify and evaluate contacts, perform

103

reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) COVID-19 diagnostic tests, and

104

quarantine high-risk contacts, as defined by the MoPH (Table 1). Contacts were classified as

105

high-risk if they were family members or lived in the same household as a COVID-19 patient, if

106

they were within a 1-meter distance of a COVID-19 patient longer than 15 minutes; if they were

107

exposed to coughs, sneezes, or secretions of a COVID-19 patient and were not wearing

108

protective gear, such as a mask; or if they were in the same closed environment within a 1-meter

109

distance of a COVID-19 patient longer than 15 minutes and were not wearing protective gear,

110

such as a mask (19, 20). All RT-PCR tests were performed at laboratories certified for COVID-

111

19 testing by the National Institute of Health of Thailand (19, 20). Data on risk factors associated

112

with COVID-19 infection, such as type of contact and use of mask, were recorded during the

113

contact investigation, but data were sometimes incomplete.

114

The central SRRT team performed contact investigations for any cluster with at least five PCR-

115

confirmed COVID-19 patients from the same location(s) within a 1-week period (19, 20). We

116

used these data to identify contacts of COVID-19 patients who were asymptomatic from 1

117

through 31 March 2020. All available contact tracing records of the central SRRT team were

118

used in the study. See Supplemental Materials for further details.

119

We telephoned the contacts during 30 April–27 May 2020 and asked details about their contact

120

with COVID-19 patients (e.g., date(s), location(s), duration and distance of contacts); whether,

their hands during the contact period (1) no washing with soap or alcohol-based solutions, 2) yes,

138

and verified using DDC records, whether and when the contacts became sick and diagnosed with

139

COVID-19.

140

We defined cases as asymptomatic contacts who were later diagnosed with COVID-19 based on

141

RT-PCR assay results available by 21 Apr 2020 (Table 1). All asymptomatic contacts who were

142

not diagnosed with COVID-19 by 21 Apr 2020, including those who tested negative and those

143

who were not tested, were classified as controls. We used 21 days after 31 March as a cutoff date

144

based on evidence that (1) most COVID-19 patients would likely develop symptoms within 14

145

days (21) and (2) it could take <7 additional days for symptomatic patients under contact

146

investigation to present at healthcare facilities and be tested for COVID-19 by RT-PCR assay.

147

Definitions for asymptomatic contacts, cases, controls, index patients, primary index patients,

148

COVID-19 patients, high-risk and low-risk contacts were described in Table 1. The reporting of

149

this study follows the STROBE guidelines (see Supplemental Materials) (22).

150

Statistical analysis

151

To include only initially asymptomatic contacts in the study, we excluded from the analysis

152

people who reported having any symptoms of COVID-19 at the time of initial contact with a

153

case. We excluded contacts whose contact locations were healthcare facilities because this study

154

focused on the risk of infection in the community. Primary index patients were also excluded if

155

they were the first to have symptoms at the contact investigation location, had symptoms since

156

the first day of visiting the location, or were the origin of infection based on the contact

157

investigation.

158

Univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted. We estimated secondary attack rate using

159

definitions as described in Table 1 to allow for comparison with other studies. Odds ratios (OR)

160

and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for associations between development of

161

COVID-19 and baseline covariates, such as mask-wearing, handwashing, and social distancing

162

during the contact period. We used logistic regression with random effects for location and for

163

index patient nested within the same location. If an asymptomatic contact had contact with ≥1

164

symptomatic COVID-19 patient, the interviewer identified the index patient as the symptomatic

165

COVID-19 patient who had the closest contact. The percentage of missing values for the variable

166

indicating whether the index patients wore a mask was 27%, so this variable was not included in

167

analyses. For other variables, we assumed that missing values were missing at random and used

168

imputation by chained equations (23, 24). We created 10 imputed datasets and the imputation

169

model included the case-control indicator and all independent variables included in the

170

multivariable models. We developed the final multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression models

171

on the basis of previous knowledge and a purposeful selection method (25). Because of

172

collinearity between mask use and mask type, we conducted a separate analysis including mask

173

type in the multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model for COVID-19 infection. We also

174

tested a pre-defined interaction between mask type and mask-wearing compliance (see

175

Supplemental Materials).

176

To better understand patterns of behavior and factors related to compliance in mask-wearing, we

177

also estimated OR and 95% CI for associations between three categories of mask-wearing

178

compliance (i.e. never, sometimes, all the time) and other practices including handwashing and

179

social distancing during the contact period using multinomial logistic regression models with the

180

imputed data set. Logistic regression was used to estimate a p-value for pairwise comparisons.

181

To estimate the proportional reduction in cases that would occur if exposure to risk factors was

182

reduced, we estimated the population attributable fraction (PAF) using the imputed dataset and a

183

direct method based on logistic regression, as described previously (see Supplemental Materials)

184

(26, 27). The final multivariable model was modified by considering each risk factor

185

dichotomously, and PAF was calculated by subtraction of the total number of predicted cases

186

from total number of observed cases, divided by the total number of observed cases.

187

STATA version 14.2 and R version 4.0.0 were used for all analyses.

RESULTS

189

Characteristics of the cohort data

190

The contact tracing records of the central SRRT team included 1,716 persons who had contact

191

with or were in the same location as a COVID-19 patient who was diagnosed in an investigation

192

of three large clusters in nightclubs, boxing stadiums, and a state enterprise office in Thailand

193

(Figure 1). Overall, 18 individuals were defined as primary index patients: 11 from the nightclub

194

cluster, 5 from the boxing stadium cluster, and 2 from the state enterprise office cluster.

195

Timelines of primary index patients from nightclub, boxing stadium, and state enterprise clusters

196

are described in detail in the Supplemental Text and Supplemental Figures 1–3. All 18 primary

197

index patients were excluded from case-control study analyses.

198

Characteristics of cases and controls

199

After retrospectively interviewing each contact by phone and applying exclusion criteria (Figure

200

1), we included 1,050 asymptomatic contacts who had contact with or were in the same location

201

as a symptomatic COVID-19 patient from 1 through 31 March 2020 in the analysis. The median

202

age of individuals was 38 years (interquartile range 28–51) and 55% were male (Table 2). Most

203

asymptomatic contacts included in the study were associated with the boxing stadium cluster

204

(61%, n=645); 36% (n=374) were related to the nightclub cluster, and 3% (n=31) were related to

205

the state enterprise office cluster. Overall, 890 (85%) were contacts with high-risk exposure.

206

In total, 211 (20%) asymptomatic contacts were later diagnosed with COVID-19 by 21 Apr 2020

207

and classified as cases; 839 (80%) were not diagnosed and represented the control group. Of the

208

211 cases, 195 (92%) were contacts with high-risk exposure and 150 (71%) had symptoms of

209

COVID-19 prior to diagnosis by RT-PCR results. The last date that a COVID-19 case was

210

diagnosed was 9 April 2020. Among 839 controls, 696 (83%) were deemed to have had high-risk

211

exposures and 719 (86%) were tested for COVID-19 at least once.

212

Figure 2 illustrates contacts (and possible transmission routes) between index patients and

213

asymptomatic contacts included in the study. There were 228, 144, and 20 asymptomatic

214

contacts of index patients at nightclubs, boxing stadiums, and the state enterprise office,

215

respectively. Figure 2 shows all contacts of primary index patients in the clusters. The others had

216

contact with cases associated with nightclubs, boxing stadiums, at workplaces (n=277),

217

households (n=230), and other places (n=151).

218

Among 890 asymptomatic contacts with high-risk exposures included in the study, the boxing

219

stadium secondary attack rate was 86% (111/129), the nightclub secondary attack rate was 18%

220

(34/187), the household secondary attack rate was 17% (38/230), the workplace secondary

221

attack rate was 5% (10/205), and the secondary attack rate at other places was 1% (2/139).

222

Bivariate analyses

223

Table 2 shows that COVID-19 infection was negatively associated with maintaining a distance

224

of at least >1 meter from a case (crude odds ratio [OR] 0.08, 95% CI 0.02–0.31), duration of

225

contact ≤15 minutes (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04–0.46), handwashing sometimes (OR 0.41, 95% CI

226

0.18–0.91) or often (OR 0.19, 95% CI 0.08–0.46) and wearing a mask all the time during the

227

period of contact with the COVID-19 case (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.07–0.36). Sharing dishes or cups

228

(OR 2.71 95%CI 1.48–4.94) and sharing cigarettes (OR 6.12, 2.12–17.72) with other people (not

229

necessarily including the case) were associated with higher risk of COVID-19 infection. Type of

230

mask was associated with infection in the bivariate model (p=0.003).

231

Multivariable analyses

232

We found a negative association between risk of COVID-19 infection and maintaining a distance

233

of at least >1 meter from a case (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.15, 95% CI 0.04–0.63), duration of

234

contact ≤15 minutes (aOR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07–0.90), handwashing often (aOR 0.34, 95% CI

235

0.13–0.87), and wearing a mask all the time during the period of contact with the COVID-19

236

case (aOR 0.23, 95% CI 0.09–0.60) (Table 2). Wearing masks sometimes during contact with the

237

case was not significantly associated with lower risk of infection (aOR 0.87, 95% CI 0.41–1.84).

238

Sharing cigarettes with other people was associated with higher risk of COVID-19 infection

239

(aOR 3.47, 1.09–11.02).

240

Compliance with mask-wearing during the period of contact with a case was strongly associated

241

with lower risk of infection in the multivariable model. Because of collinearity with mask-

242

wearing compliance, mask type was not included in the final model. We included mask type in a

243

separate multivariable model and found type of mask was not independently associated with

244

infection (p=0.54) (Supplemental Materials, Table 1). We found no evidence of effect

245

modification between mask type and mask-wearing compliance.

246

Association between mask-wearing compliance and other social distancing practices

247

Because mask-wearing throughout the contact period was negatively associated with COVID-19

248

infection, we further explored characteristics of those patients to ascertain if wearing a mask

249

produced a potential false sense of security. We found that during the contact period, those who

250

wore masks all the time were more likely to report closest contacts >1 meter (25% vs. 18%,

251

pairwise p=0.03), durations of contact ≤15 minutes (26% vs 13%, pairwise p<0.001), and

252

washing hands often (79% vs. 26%, pairwise p<0.001) compared with those who did not wear

masks (Table 3). We found that those who wore masks sometimes were more likely to wash their

254

hands often (43% vs. 26%, pairwise p<0.001) compared with those who did not wear masks.

255

However, they were more likely to have physical contact (50% vs. 42%, pairwise p=0.03) and

256

report duration of contacts >60 minutes (75% vs. 67%, pairwise p=0.04) compared with those

257

who did not wear masks.

258

Population attributable fraction

259

We estimated that the proportional reduction in cases that might occur if everyone wore a mask

260

all the time during contact with COVID-19 patients (i.e., PAF of not wearing masks all the time)

261

was 0.28 (Table 4). Among modifiable risk factors evaluated, PAF of shortest distance of contact

262

<1 meter was highest at 0.40. If everyone wore a mask all the time; washed hands often; did not

263

share a dish, cup, or cigarette; had shortest distance of contact >1 meter; and had duration of

264

contact <15 min, cases may have been reduced by 84%, based on our data.

265

DISCUSSION

266

Our findings provide evidence that mask-wearing, handwashing, and social distancing are

267

independently associated with lower risk of COVID-19 infection among the general public in

268

Thai community settings. We observed that wearing masks throughout the period of exposure to

269

someone infected with COVID-19 was associated with lower risk of infection, while wearing

270

masks sometimes during the exposure period was not. This evidence supports mask-wearing

271

consistently and correctly at all times in public (2, 7-9).

272

We also quantified the effectiveness of different measures that could be implemented to prevent

273

transmission in nightclubs, stadiums, workplaces, and other public gathering places. We

13

274

estimated that adopting all recommendations (mask-wearing all the time; handwashing often; not

275

sharing dishes, cups or cigarettes; maintaining a distance of >1 meter and, if this distance cannot

276

be maintained, limiting contact duration to <15 minutes) might prevent up to 84% of COVID-19

277

infections in the study settings during the study period. Public gathering places may consider

278

multiple measures to protect against COVID-19 and new pandemic diseases in the future.

279

The effectiveness of mask-wearing observed in this study is consistent with previous studies,

280

including a randomized-controlled trial showing that consistent face mask use reduced risk of

281

influenza-like illness (28); two case-control studies that found mask-wearing was associated with

282

lower risk of SARS infection (29, 30); and a retrospective cohort study that found that wearing

283

mask-wearing by index patients or family members at home was associated with lower risk of

284

COVID-19 infection (31).

285

While previous studies found use of surgical masks or 12–16-layer cotton masks demonstrated

286

protection against coronavirus infection in the community (32), we did not observe a difference

287

between wearing non-medical and medical masks in the general population. Our results suggest

288

that wearing non-medical masks in public can potentially reduce transmission of COVID-19

289

infection. Previous studies have shown perception of risk of developing COVID-19 can increase

290

individuals’ likelihood of wearing medical masks in non-medical settings (33); however, given

291

recent shortages, it is important that medical masks be reserved for use by healthcare workers.

292

We found a negative association between risk of COVID-19 infection and social distancing (i.e.,

293

shorter distances and durations of contact), consistent with previous studies that found that ≥1-

294

meter physical distancing was associated with a larger protective effect, and distances of >2

295

meters could be even more effective (32). Our findings on effectiveness of hand hygiene were

296

also consistent with those reported in previous studies (34).

297

Secondary attack rates at different venues in this study varied widely. The household secondary

298

attack rate in our study (17%) is comparable with ranges reported previously (11%–23%) (35,

299

36) and relatively high compared to workplaces and other settings. While quarantine measures

300

may be challenging and sometimes impractical, household members should immediately

301

separate a person who develops any symptoms of COVID-19 from other household members

302

(i.e., a sick person should stay in a specific room; use a separate bathroom, if possible; and not

303

share dishes, cups, and other utensils) (37). All household members should wear masks,

304

frequently wash hands, and perform social distancing to the extent possible (38).

305

The high number of COVID-19 patients associated with nightclub exposures in Bangkok is

306

comparable to the COVID-19 outbreak associated with the Itaewon nightclub cluster in Seoul,

307

Korea, in May 2020 (39). Similarly, we found individuals who visited several nightclubs in the

308

same area during a short period of time. The secondary attack rate in boxing stadiums was high,

309

at 86%. The high number of COVID-19 infections reported from a boxing stadium in Bangkok is

310

similar to a cluster of COVID-19 cases associated with a football match in Italy in February 2020

311

(40). The secondary attack rate of COVID-19 at a choir practice in the United States was

312

reported to be as high as 53% (41). Secondary attack rates in public gathering places with high

313

densities of people who are shouting and cheering—such as football and boxing stadiums—are

314

still uncertain but may be high.

315

It is likely that clear, consistent public messaging from policymakers can prevent a false sense of

316

security and promote compliance with social distancing in Thailand. We found that those who

15

317

wore masks throughout the exposure period to a case were also more likely to wash hands and

318

perform social distancing. Both traditional and social media outlets can support public health

319

responses by working with governments to provide consistent, simple and clear messages (42).

320

In Thailand, daily briefings by Thailand's Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration

321

(CCSA) provided clear and consistent messages on social distancing every day, including how to

322

put on a mask and wash hands. CCSA’s regular situation reports and advice may have improved

323

public confidence and compliance with the recommendations. Public messages on how to wear

324

masks correctly need to be consistently delivered, particularly to those who wear masks

325

sometimes or incorrectly (e.g., not covering both nose and mouth); we found that those who wear

326

masks during exposure intermittently also did not practice social distancing adequately.

327

Our study has several limitations. First, our findings might not be generalizable to all settings,

328

since they were based on contacts related to three major COVID-19 clusters in Thailand during

329

March 2020. Second, estimated ORs were conditioned on occurrence of the reported contact

330

with index patients. Our study did not evaluate or consider the probability of having contact with

331

other infected people in the community setting, which must have occurred. Third, since only

332

89% of controls were tested at least once, those not tested could have been infected, and

333

therefore, cases with mild or no symptoms who did not report symptoms or seek care and testing

334

could have been missed. Fourth, it is impossible to identify every potential contact an individual

335

has and some individuals may have had contact with >1 COVID-19 patient. Hence, our

336

estimated secondary attack rates among contacts with high-risk exposure could be over- or

337

underestimated. Fifth, findings were subject to common biases of retrospective case-control

338

studies, including memory bias, observer bias, and information bias (43). To reduce potential

16

339

biases, we used structured interviews where each participant was asked the same set of defined

340

questions.

341

As social distancing measures are being relaxed in many countries, our findings provide

342

evidence supporting consistent mask-wearing, handwashing, and adhering to social distancing

343

recommendations can reduce COVID-19 transmission in public gathering places. Wearing non-

344

medical masks in public may help slow the spread of COVID-19. The effectiveness of

345

complying with all measures could be high; however, in places with a high density of people,

346

additional measures may be required.

347

Clear and consistent public messaging on recommendations against COVID-19 infection is

348

important, particularly targeting those who wear masks intermittently or incorrectly. Our data

349

also showed that no single protective measure was associated with complete protection from

350

COVID-19 infection. All measures, including wearing masks, handwashing, and social

351

distancing can increase protection against COVID-19 infections in public.

Individuals who had contact with or were in the same location as a
symptomatic COVID-19 patient and had no symptoms of COVID19 on the first day of contact.
Asymptomatic contacts of COVID-19 patients who were later
diagnosed and officially reported as COVID-19 patients by 21 Apr
2020.
Asymptomatic contacts of COVID-19 patients who were not
diagnosed as COVID-19 patients by 21 Apr 2020.
The COVID-19 patients identified from contact tracing data as the
potential source of infection. Cases (as defined above) could also
be included as index patients.
The earliest COVID-19 patients, whose probable sources of
infection were prior to the study period (1 to 31 March 2020); from
whom we were not able to identify the source of infection; or
whose probable sources of infection were outside the contract
tracing data included in the study.
Individuals who had positive RT-PCR test results for SARS-CoV2, officially confirmed and reported by Department of Disease
Control, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand.
The percentage of new cases among asymptomatic contacts with
high-risk exposure.
Family members or lived in the same household as a COVID-19
patient, if they were within a 1-meter distance of a COVID-19
patient longer than 15 minutes; if they were exposed to coughs,
sneezes, or secretions of a COVID-19 patient and were not wearing
a protective gear, such as a mask; or if they were in the same closed
environment (e.g., room, nightclub, stadium, vehicle) within a 1meter distance of a COVID-19 patient longer than 15 minutes and
they were not wearing protective gear, such as a mask (19, 20).
Contacts who had activities together with or were in the same
location(s) as a COVID-19 patient but did not meet criteria for a
high-risk contact.
Individuals who lived in the same household as a COVID-19
patient.

Prevalence (Prev) was estimated using the imputed data set. PAF was estimated using the direct method (Supplemental Text). c
During the contact period. d Sharing multi-serving dishes using communal serving utensils to portion food individually was
categorized as not sharing dishes. e Included sharing an electronic cigarette and any vaping device. f Washing hands included washing
with soap and water, and with alcohol-based solutions. g Wearing masks incorrectly (i.e. not covering both nose and mouth) was
considered to be the same as not wearing a mask for analyses. i Age and gender were considered non-modifiable risk factors, while
other risk factors were considered modifiable. Total PAF was directly estimated using logistic regression in the form of natural
logarithm; therefore, total PAF was not equal to the direct summation of PAF of each risk factor.

Supplemental Materials
Supplemental Methods
Study design
All high-risk contacts with any symptoms were tested with a reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and quarantined in a hospital or a quarantine site. All high-risk
contacts without any symptoms were self-quarantined at home. Before 23 March 2020, all highrisk contacts without any symptoms were tested using RT-PCR assays on day 5 after the last date
of exposure to a case (19, 20). As of 23 March 2020, all household contacts were tested using
RT-PCR assays regardless of their symptoms (19, 20). Other high-risk contacts were tested only
if they developed any COVID-19 symptoms. All low-risk contacts were recommended to
perform self-monitoring for 14 days, and visit healthcare facilities immediately for RT-PCR
assays if they developed any symptoms of COVID-19 (19, 20).

Statistical analysis
We estimated the direct population attributable fraction (PAF) using the imputed dataset and the
direct method as previously described (26, 27). Direct PAF can be obtained by calculating PAFs
directly from individuals’ data using logistic regression (26, 27). First, we modified our final
logistic regression model by considering each risk factor dichotomously. Then, irrespective of
exposure to each risk factor for each individual, that factor was removed from the population by
calculating probability based on all observations as unexposed. The predicted probability of
developing COVID-19 infection for each asymptomatic contact, with the assumption that there
was no exposure to a certain risk factor, was defined by:

P୩୧ 

1  exp

1
β଴  ∑୨ஷ୧ β୨ x୨ 

Pki is representative of predicted probability of COVID-19 infection in individual asymptomatic
contact k, assuming no exposure to a specific risk factor (xi); β୨ indicates the regression
coefficient of risk factor (xj), except risk factor number i (xi). Subsequently, the sum of all
predicted probabilities for all individuals in the study would be equal to adjusted estimate of total
cases, which is anticipated in the absence of that specific risk factor (xi).
Then, PAF was estimated by subtraction of the total number of predicted cases from total
number of observed cases, divided by the total number of observed cases:

PAF 

Total number of observed cases Total number of predicted cases
Total number of observed cases

Supplemental Results
For the nightclub cluster, we identified 11 primary index patients who started having symptoms
from 4 to 8 March and were diagnosed (and isolated) from 3 to 10 March (Supplemental Figure
1). Those primary index patients visited multiple nightclubs included in the analysis during the
study period, and 35 of 228 (15%) asymptomatic contacts at nightclubs had PCR-confirmed
COVID-19 infections after the contact (Figure 2, Cluster A).
For the boxing stadium cluster, we identified 5 primary index patients who started having
symptoms from 6 through 12 March and were diagnosed (and isolated) from 11 through 21
March (Supplemental Figure 2). Those primary index patients visited multiple boxing stadiums
included in the analysis during the study period, and 125 of 144 (87%) asymptomatic contacts at
the boxing stadiums had RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infections after the contact (Figure 2,
Cluster B).
Among the two primary index patients for the office cluster, one had had symptoms since 15
March 2020 (Primary index patient C1 in Supplemental Figure 3) and was considered the source
of infection for one new case in the office during the study period. The other primary index
patient (Primary index patient C2 in Supplemental Figure 3) was a household member of a
staffer at the office and was considered as the source of infection for the staffer via household
contact.

a

Both crude and adjusted odds ratios were estimated using logistic regression with a random
effect for location and a random effect for index patient nested within the same location. Missing
values were imputed using the imputation model. b The state enterprise office was included in
workplaces. Others included restaurants, markets, malls, religious places, and households of
index patients or other people but not living together, etc. c Location was included in the model
as a random effect variable. d During the contact period. e Sharing multi-serving dishes using
communal serving utensils to portion food individually was categorized as not sharing dishes. f
Included sharing electronic cigarettes and any vaping devices. g Included washing with soap and
water, and with alcohol-based solutions. h Wearing masks incorrectly (e.g., not covering both
nose and mouth) was considered to be the same as not wearing a mask for analyses.
