Abstract
There is a rapidly expanding literature on the in vitro antiviral activity of drugs that may be repurposed
for therapy or chemoprophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. However, this has not been accompanied by a
comprehensive evaluation of the ability of these drugs to achieve target plasma and lung
concentrations following approved dosing in humans. Moreover, most publications have focussed on
50% maximum effective concentrations (EC50), which may be an insufficiently robust indicator of
antiviral activity because of marked differences in the slope of the concentration-response curve
between drugs. Accordingly, in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity data was digitised from all available
publications up to 13th April 2020 and used to recalculate an EC90 value for each drug. EC90 values were
then expressed as a ratio to the achievable maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) reported for each
drug after administration of the approved dose to humans (Cmax/EC90 ratio). Only 14 of the 56
analysed drugs achieved a Cmax/EC90 ratio above 1 meaning that plasma Cmax concentrations
exceeded those necessary to inhibit 90% of SARS-CoV-2 replication. A more in-depth assessment of
the putative agents tested demonstrated that only nitazoxanide, nelfinavir, tipranavir (boosted with
ritonavir) and sulfadoxine achieved plasma concentrations above their reported anti-SARS-CoV-2
activity across their entire approved dosing interval at their approved human dose. For all drugs
reported, the unbound lung to plasma tissue partition coefficient (KpUlung) was also simulated and used
along with reported Cmax and fraction unbound in plasma to derive a lung Cmax/EC50 as a better
indicator of potential human efficacy (lung Cmax/EC90 ratio was also calculable for a limited number
of drugs). Using this parameter hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, mefloquine, atazanavir (boosted
with ritonavir), tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir), ivermectin, azithromycin and lopinavir (boosted
with ritonavir) were all predicted to achieve lung concentrations over 10-fold higher than their
reported EC50. This analysis was not possible for nelfinavir because insufficient data were available to
calculate KpUlung but nitozoxanide and sulfadoxine were also predicted to exceed their reported EC50
by 3.1- and 1.5-fold in lung, respectively. The antiviral activity data reported to date have been
acquired under different laboratory conditions across multiple groups, applying variable levels of
stringency. However, this analysis may be used to select potential candidates for further clinical
testing, while deprioritising compounds which are unlikely to attain target concentrations for antiviral
activity. Future studies should focus on EC90 values and discuss findings in the context of achievable
exposures in humans, especially within target compartments such as the lung, in order to maximise
the potential for success of proposed human clinical trials.

Introduction
Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Fever, a persistent cough and respiratory symptoms are
common, with some patients reporting vomiting, nausea, abdominal pains and diarrhoea [1]. To date,
no specific treatment is available, and this has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality globally.
According to the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform search portal, 927 clinical trials for
COVID-19 have been registered [2]. This rapidly expanding pandemic warrants the urgent
development of strategies, particularly to protect people at high risk of infection. Repurposing
currently available drugs that have been utilised clinically with a known safety profile, is the quickest
way to address this serious unmet clinical need. Antiviral drugs are urgently required for treatment of
patients with mild/moderate disease to prevent the worsening of symptoms and reduce the burden
upon healthcare systems. However, a different approach is likely to be needed for patients that are
already in a critical state, due to the immune dysregulation which is so apparent in severe cases [3].
Previous investigations have shown that the entry by SARS-CoV occurs via the angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [4]. A study on normal lung tissue showed that 83% of ACE2-expressing cells
were alveolar epithelial type II cells [5], highlighting the lungs as the primary target organ that facilitate
viral invasion and replication. Furthermore, the ACE2 receptor is also highly expressed in
gastrointestinal epithelial cells, with SARS-CoV-2 RNA observed to be present in stool specimens of
patients during infection [1, 6]. A recent retrospective analysis of 85 patients with laboratory
confirmed COVID-19 also indicated that SARS-CoV-2 infects human kidney tubules and induces acute
tubular damage in some patients [7]. Furthermore, 2–11% of patients with COVID-19 exhibit liver
comorbidities [8]. Of note is an observation of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)
having a tropism to the gastrointestinal tract [9] and causing liver impairments in addition to
respiratory disease. The genomic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (79.6% sequence
identity) would imply that the current virus would act in a similar manner and be present within the
body systemically [10-12]. Therefore, treatment options that provide therapeutic concentrations of
drug(s) within the systemic circulation and other affected organs are likely to be required.
In the absence of a vaccine, antiviral drugs could also be deployed as chemoprophylaxis to protect
against infection and would present an essential tool for protecting healthcare staff and other key
workers, as well as household contacts of those already infected. For chemoprevention drugs will need
to penetrate into the multiple sites where SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs, and do so in sufficient
concentrations to inhibit viral replication [13]. This may include the mucous membranes present in
the nasal cavity and throat, the ocular surface, tears and the upper respiratory tract/lungs [14, 15].

However, therapeutic concentrations may not be needed in the systemic circulation for
chemoprophylaxis, but this is yet to be determined. Although difficult and scarcely studied, work in
animals has shown that the size of the inoculum of other respiratory viruses such as influenza is
associated with the severity of the resultant disease [16, 17]. Reports with SARS-CoV-2 indicate that
higher viral loads are indicative of poorer prognosis and correlate with the severity of symptoms, with
viral load in severe cases reported to be 60 times higher than that of mild cases [18, 19]. In light of
this, even if a chemoprophylactic drug reduced inoculum size without completely blocking
transmission, major benefits for morbidity and mortality may still be achievable.
Many ongoing global research efforts are focused on screening the activity of existing compounds in
vitro in order to identify candidates to repurpose for SARS-CoV-2. However, current data have not yet
been systematically analysed in the context of the plasma and target site exposures that are
achievable after administration of the approved doses to humans. The purpose of this work was to
evaluate the existing in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 data to determine and prioritise drugs capable of
reaching antiviral concentrations within the blood plasma. An accepted physiologically-based
pharmacokinetic (PBPK) equation was also used to predict the expected concentration in lung, in order
to assess the potential of these drugs for therapy in this key disease site and the potential for
chemoprevention.

Methods
Candidate Analysis
To identify compounds and their relevant potency and pharmacokinetic data, we performed a
literature search on PubMed, Google Scholar, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, and ChemRxiv. The following search
terms were used for in vitro activity data – (COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (EC50 OR IC50 OR
antiviral). For pharmacokinetic data (Cmax OR pharmacokinetics) was used along with the drug name
for drugs with reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity (up to April 13th 2020). Further clinical
pharmacokinetic data was obtained from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European
Medicines Agency (EMA) and through publications available online.

Lung accumulation prediction
An indication of the degree to which candidate drugs are expected to accumulate in lung (a presumed
site of primary efficacy and for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection) was provided by calculation of
unbound lung to plasma tissue partition coefficient (KpUlung) according to the methodology of Rodgers
and Rowland [20-22]. The formulae provided in these methods use the physicochemical properties of
the drug (pKa, log P, classification as acid/base/neutral) and in vitro drug binding information (fraction
unbound in plasma, blood to plasma ratio), in combination with tissue specific data (lipid content,
volumes of intra/extracellular water etc.) to predict tissue KpU values. Predicted KpUlung was converted
to Kp_lung by multiplying by fraction unbound in plasma to allow estimation of lung exposure from in
vivo measurements of plasma concentration. In the absence of observed tissue distribution data the
Rodgers and Rowland method is an accepted means to provide initial estimates of tissue partitioning
for PBPK modelling, but with known limits on potential accuracy (generally predicted KpU is within 23 fold of observed tissue KpU values).

Data analysis and interpretation
Since in the majority of papers only an EC50 value was available, concentration-response data were
digitized using the Web Plot Digitizer® software. Graphs were then re-plotted in SigmaPlot 14.0 (Systat
Software, Inc.) and curves were fitted to confirm EC50 values and determine EC90 values. A Cmax/EC50
and Cmax/EC90 ratio was then calculated for each drug for which previous evidence of clinical use in
humans and availability of human pharmacokinetic data were available. Lung KpU values were also
used in combination with reported Cmax values to derive an estimate of lung exposure at Cmax for

each drug. For a subset of molecules, the absence of available physicochemical or plasma
protein binding parameters prohibited derivation of a KpU estimate. For the remaining drugs, a lung
Cmax/EC50 and lung Cmax/EC90 was calculated. Published plasma concentration – time data for the
most promising candidates were also digitized (were available) and replotted to visually represent
human pharmacokinetics relative to the calculated EC50 and EC90 data.

Results
Identified papers and methods
We identified 14 key studies that detailed the antiviral activity of 72 compounds [23-37]. The majority
of the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments were performed in Vero E6 cells (ATCC 1586)
maintained in either DMEM or MEM. Other studies utilised Vero-hSLAM cells, VeroE6 cells expressing
TMPRSS2 and the CACO-2 cell line to cultivate the virus. The following SARS-CoV-2 strains were used
across studies; WA-1 strain - BEI #NR-52281; Brazil/RJ-314/2020; C-Tan-nCoV Wuhan strain 01;
Wuhan/WIV04/2019; USA-WA1/2020; nCoV-2019BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019; BetaCoV/Hong
Kong/VM20001061/2020; Australia/VIC01/2020; βCoV/KOR/KCDC03/2020 and BavPat1/2020. Cells
across all studies were infected with the virus with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.002, 0.01,
0.0125, 0.02, 0.05 and 0.1. Drugs were added at concentrations varying between 0.01μM - 500μM. A
summary of the differences in methodologies between studies reporting SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity
is presented in Table 1.

Identification of candidates achieving plasma concentrations expected to exert antiviral activity
(Cmax / EC50 ratio)
Seventeen molecules had a reported Cmax value greater than at least one of the reported EC50 values
against SARS-CoV-2 and these included nelfinavir, chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir (boosted with
ritonavir), eltrombopag, hydroxychloroquine, atazanavir (boosted with ritonavir), indomethacin,
favipiravir, sulfadoxine, nicolsamide, mefloquine, tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir), ritonavir,
merimepodib, anidulafungin and nitazoxanide. However, it should be noted that for amodiaquine,
atazanavir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, mefloquine, nelfinavir, remdesevir and
toremefine, more than one EC50 value had been reported across the available literature and these
were not always in agreement (Figure 1A). Moreover, this variability in reported EC50 values
sometimes resulted in Cmax / EC50 ratios giving a different estimation of the likely value of the
molecule. Meaning that for the same drug, the Cmax / EC50 ratio could be above or below 1 (Figure
1B). For amodiaquine and toremifene all reported EC50 values were below their reported Cmax and
only for nelfinavir was the reported Cmax expected to exceed both reported EC50 values. For
atazanavir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, mefloquine and remdesivir, some EC50 values
were above the Cmax whereas other were below. This observation dramatically highlights the
sensitivity of the current analysis to the reported antiviral activity data, and this should be taken into
account when interpreting the data presented hereafter.

Identification of candidates achieving plasma concentrations exceeding the SARS-CoV-2 EC90 (Cmax
/ EC90 ratio)
For 57 of the reported antiviral activities, data covering a sufficient concentration range were available
for digitisation and subsequent calculation of an EC90 value. For the remainder it was not possible to
calculate an EC90. Drugs with an available EC90 were ranked according to their Cmax/EC90 ratio (Figure
2). Drugs with a value above 1.0 achieved plasma concentrations above the concentrations reported
to inhibit 90% of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Only eltrombopag, favipiravir, remdesevir, nelfinavir,
niclosamide, nitazoxanide and tipranavir were estimated to exceed at least one of their reported EC90
by 2-fold or more at Cmax concentrations. Anidulafungin, lopinavir, chloroquine and ritonavir were
also reported to exceed at least one of their reported EC90 values at Cmax but by less than 2-fold.

Detailed interrogation of the plasma pharmacokinetics in relation to reported anti-SARS-CoV-2
activity
For drugs with Cmax concentrations above at least one of their reported EC90 values that are not
already in clinical trials for Covid-19, a detailed evaluation of concentrations across their approved
dosing interval was undertaken. For this, published pharmacokinetics data were digitised and
replotted relative to the calculated EC50 and EC90 data for SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3). For tipranavir
(boosted with ritonavir), nelfinavir, sulfadoxine and nitazoxanide plasma concentrations after
administration of the approved dose remained above SARS-CoV-2 effective concentrations across the
entire dosing interval. For antifungdalin, etrombopag, lopinavir (boosted with ritonavir), mefloquine
and chloroquine, Cmax values were above EC90 at 2, 6, 8, and 24 hours post dose respectively, but
concentrations would be expected to dip below the EC50 at 3, 8, 10, 72 and 120 hours post dose
respectively when given at approved doses and schedules. An overview of these drugs is presented in
Figure 2.

Simulated lung exposure relative to reported anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity
Lung KpU was simulated for all molecules for which the necessary physicochemical properties and in
vitro drug binding information were available. KpUlung was then used along with fraction unbound in
plasma (Fu) and plasma Cmax values to calculate a predicted Cmax/EC50 (Figure 3) and Cmax/EC90 in
lung (data not shown). For 4 drugs, ebselen, merimepodib, niclosamide and remdesivir, the fraction

unbound data were unavailable. For 6 other drugs, benztropine, indinavir, loperamide, nelfinavir,
saquinavir and toremifene the blood to plasma ratios were unavailable. For a further 4 drugs,
camostat, emetine, fluspirilene and umifenovir both fraction unbound and blood to plasma ratios
were unavailable. Therefore, these drugs were excluded from the analysis. A total of 23 drugs with
available data were predicted to give concentrations in lung above at least one of their reported EC50
against SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 4) and 8 of these were predicted to exceed their EC50 by more than 10fold. The rank order of lung Cmax/EC90 ratio was chloroquine > atazanavir (boosted with ritonavir) >
tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir) > hydroxychloroquine > mefloquine > ivermectin > lopinavir
(boosted with ritonavir) > azithromycin > ritonavir > gilteritinib > nitazoxanide > imantinib > oxprenolol
(data excluded due to this analysis only being possible for 33 of the 56 drugs).

Discussion
The systematic development of mechanism-based inhibitors for key targets involved in viral
replication or pathogenesis is likely to result in highly effective and safe medicines in the coming years.
However, the repurposing of already approved medicines in antiviral treatment or chemoprevention
strategies is undoubtedly the fastest way to bring forward therapeutic options against the urgent
unmet need posed by SARS-CoV-2. A range of different drugs and drug classes have been
demonstrated to display varying degrees of antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and many of
these drugs are already licenced for use in humans for a range of indications. However, currently the
data emerging from global screening efforts are not being routinely benchmarked and prioritised
against achievable concentrations after administration of doses proven to have acceptable safety
profiles in humans.
The current analysis indicates that only 12 drugs with reported antiviral activity are likely to achieve
plasma exposures above that required for antiviral activity for at least some of their dosing interval.
Notably, neither chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine nor lopinavir/ritonavir exhibited a sustained
plasma concentration above their reported SARS-CoV-2 EC90 across their reported dosing interval.
Ultimately, the implications of this for therapy will depend upon whether systemic suppression is a
prerequisite for a reduction in morbidity or mortality, but this does raise some concern for ongoing
trials

hydroxychloroquine:

NCT04315948 ). However, the predicted lung accumulation rather than plasma exposure may provide
some therapy advantage and/or give more reassurance for ongoing chemoprevention trials.
At least 5 of the 13 candidates achieving Cmax above one of their reported EC50 and derived EC90 are
already in clinical evaluation for treatment of SARS-CoV-2. These include remdesivir (NCT04292730;
NCT04292899;

NCT04257656;

NCT04252664;

NCT04315948),

favipiravir

(NCT04310228;

NCT04319900), lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine. No robust antiviral activity data were found for
galidesrivir on which to conduct an analysis but it is also under clinical investigation (NCT03800173).
A recent trial for favipirivir, demonstrated some success with an improvement over arbidol from 56%
to 71% (p = 0.02) in patients without risk factors (but not critical cases or patients with hypertension
and/or diabetes) [38]. The results of compassionate use of remdesivir in severely ill patients was also
recently reported, and if confirmed in ongoing randomized, placebo-controlled trials will serve as a
further validation of the other candidates presented here [39]. The authors are unaware of any
ongoing COVID-19 trials for the other 7 candidate molecules with Cmax above their reported EC90, and
none were reported on www.clinicaltrials.gov at the time of manuscript submission (14th April 2020).

Of particular interest nitazoxanide, tipranavir, sulfadoxine and nelfinavir may be expected to sustain
their plasma pharmacokinetic exposure above their lowest reported EC50 and derived EC90 (where
available) for the duration of their approved dose and dosing interval.
Nitazoxanide is an antiprotozoal drug that has previously been demonstrated to display broad antiviral
activity against human and animal coronaviruses [40] as well as various strains of influenza [41, 42].
Importantly, nitazoxanide is rapidly metabolised to tizoxanide in humans and this active metabolite is
being investigated against SARS-CoV-2 (NCT04341493 and NCT04343248). Tizoxanide has been
reported to exhibit similar activities to nitazoxanide for other viruses as well as other pathogens [4345]. The mechanism of antiviral action is not fully understood for nitazoxanide, but it has been
reported to affect viral genome synthesis, prevent viral entry and interfere with the N-glycosylation
and maturation of the influenza hemagglutinin [46-49]. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is also
highly N-glycosylated [50]. This drug has also been shown to elicit an innate immune response that
potentiates the production of type 1 interferons [46, 51] and a phase 2b/3 clinical trial demonstrated
a reduction in symptoms and viral shedding in patients with uncomplicated influenza [42]. The safety
of nitazoxanide is well understood, but it has not been fully investigated during renal or hepatic
impairment. The antiviral activity of nitazoxanide for SARS-CoV-2 requires further study but the
existing data for this drug are encouraging. Niclosamide is another antiprotozoal drug that exhibits
broad antiviral activity due to its ability to perturb the pH-dependent membrane fusion required for
virus entry [52] but it was reported to have no impact upon the attachment and entry of SARS-CoV-2
[53]. For MERS-CoV niclosamide was observed to inhibit SKP2 activity impairing viral replication [54].
Niclosamide has been reported to be well tolerated and does not influence vital organ functions
[55]. However, it has low aqueous solubility and poor oral bioavailability [56] and despite a higher
reported SARS-CoV-2 potency [28] than nitazoxanide [27], the Cmax/EC90 ratio was slightly lower.
There is a paucity of published pharmacokinetic data for niclosamide and this prohibited a thorough
investigation of exposures in relation to activity over its entire dosing interval. Both nitazoxanide and
niclosamide have also been reported to be potent antagonists of TMEM16A, calcium activated
chloride channels that modulate bronchodilation [57].
Tipranavir and nelfinavir are HIV protease inhibitors [58] and both drugs ranked highly in terms of
their Cmax / EC90 ratio. Moreover, a more in-depth analysis demonstrated that the concentrations
across the dosing interval for both these drugs remained above the calculated EC90 values at approved
doses and schedules. Unlike nelfinavir, tipranavir has to be co-administered with a low dose of
ritonavir to boost its pharmacokinetics via CYP3A4 inhibition [59]. Since ritonavir itself has been
reported to exert anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity, this could be advantageous, but would need to be balanced
against the much higher risk of drug-drug interactions that could negatively impact patient

management. The implications of drug interactions have already been raised for this reason with
lopinavir/ritonavir use for COVID-19 [60] and are likely to be exacerbated with the higher ritonavir
dose needed for tipranavir. Moreover, tipranavir has a black box warning from the FDA for fatal and
nonfatal intracranial haemorrhage as well as severe hepatotoxicity [61-63]. The major route of
metabolic clearance for nelfinavir is via CYP2C19 and this pathway generates the M8 metabolite that
retains activity against the HIV protease [64]. No data are available for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2
replication by the M8 metabolite but if active, this could provide and advantage for nelfinavir over
tipranavir for COVID-19. Conversely, While the analysis of pharmacokinetics relative to potency of
these molecules against SARS-CoV-2 is encouraging, it should be noted that the reported in vitro
activity for HIV [58, 65] is far higher than that against SARS-CoV-2 and both drugs are highly protein
bound [66, 67]. While older HIV protease inhibitors like tipranavir and nelfinavir are associated with
long-term toxicities [58, 68-70] these may be less of a concern over shorter term exposure if they
prove to be successful for COVID-19.
Sulfadoxine is another antimalarial drug that is usually administered in combination with
pyrimethamine as a folic acid antagonist combination [71]. Sulfadoxine inhibits the activity of
dihydropteroate synthase within the malaria parasite, but its mechanism of action for SARS-CoV-2 is
unclear. It should also be noted that the authors can find no data describing antiviral activity of this
drug against other viruses. Also, the concentrations used in the in vitro activity used in this analysis
[26] were not high enough to reach or calculate an EC90 value. Therefore, like other molecules
described in this manuscript in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity should be repeated. Notwithstanding,
sulfadoxine plasma concentrations far above the reported EC50 are maintained in patients receiving a
single 1500 mg dose (with 75 mg pyrimethamine) for over 40 days [72]. Compared to some other
reported molecules sulfadoxine is not expected to have as high an accumulation in the lungs, but
concentrations higher than its EC50 are estimated from the analysis of its lung KpU. Therefore, if the
reported antiviral activity is confirmed this drug may offer opportunities for therapy and/or
chemoprophylaxis.
Considering that most of the impact of severe disease occurs in the lung and that this tissue may be a
key site for transmission, the potential of candidate drugs to accumulate in lung tissue was considered.
The analysis of predicted lung Cmax / EC50 ratio revealed more candidates expected to exceed the
concentrations needed for antiviral activity in this tissue. Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine,
mefloquine, atazanavir (boosted with ritonavir), tipranavir (boosted with ritonavir), ivermectin and
lopinavir were all predicted to achieve lung concentrations over 10-fold higher than their reported
EC50. All of these drugs were also predicted to exceed their EC90 in lung by at least 3.4-fold (data not
shown). The lung prediction was not possible for nelfinavir because insufficient data were available to

calculate KpUlung but nitozoxanide and sulfadoxine were also predicted to exceed their reported EC50
by 3.1- and 1.5-fold in lung, respectively. Nitazoxanide was predicted to exceed its EC90 by 1.4-fold in
lung but an EC90 was not calculable from the available data for sulfadoxine.
During inflammation or injury, changes to the vascular microenvironment, could have a profound
effect on the ability of these drugs to accumulate in lung cells. Due to the recruitment of neutrophils
and leaky endothelial cells [73], the lung inflammatory microenvironment is characterized by
increased body temperature, excessive enzymic activity and most importantly, by a low interstitial pH
[74]. In the case of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, these diprotic weak bases are exquisitely
dependent on a pH gradient to drive lysosomal uptake as a mechanism of lung accumulation. It has
been demonstrated that cellular chloroquine uptake is diminished one hundred-fold for every pH unit
of external acidification [75]. This situation is likely to deteriorate further on mechanical ventilation,
which also induces acidification of the lung tissue, independently of inflammation [76, 77]. Therefore,
the benefits of lung accumulation for many of these drugs may be lost during treatment of severe
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conversely, mefloquine is monoprotic and more lipophilic than chloroquine,
which may make it much less reliant on the pH gradient to drive cellular accumulation in lung. It is
likely that the charged form of the drug is sufficiently lipophilic to allow movement across biological
membranes along a concentration gradient [78]. Only two studies have described mefloquine uptake
into cells, one study suggested that mefloquine uptake is not energy-dependent and the other
suggested that mefloquine uptake is mediated by secondary active transport, rather than passive
proton trapping [79, 80]. Mefloquine is known to cause severe psychiatric side effects in some patients
and so use of this drug should be managed with care [81]. Therefore, mefloquine may offer
opportunities for treatment during severe disease that are not available with other drugs currently
being tested for COVID-19 therapy. If the high lung exposures are proven empirically for the drugs on
this list, then some may also prove to be valuable for chemoprevention strategies.

Limitations of this analysis
This study represents the first holistic view of drugs with reported activity against SARS-CoV-2 in the
context of their achievable pharmacokinetic exposure in humans. While the analysis does provide a
basis to rationally selected candidates for further analysis, there are some important limitations.
Firstly, Cmax was the only pharmacokinetic parameter that was universally available for all of the
candidate drugs, but Cmin values are generally accepted as a better marker of efficacy since they
represent the lowest plasma concentration over the dosing interval. However, Cmax was only used to

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.16.20068379; this version posted April 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

assess whether plasma concentration would exceed those required at any point in the dosing interval,
and this was followed by a more in-depth analysis of the most promising candidates.
Secondly, an EC50 value only equates to a concentration required to suppress 50% of the virus, and
data were unavailable to calculate EC90 values for some of the drugs. EC90 values are a preferred
marker of activity because the slope of the concentration-response curve can vary substantially
between different molecules and between different mechanisms of action. Although EC90 were not
calculable for all drugs the authors deemed it appropriate to deprioritise molecules not achieving EC50
at Cmax in this analysis. Thirdly, the reported antiviral activities were conducted under different
conditions (Table 1) and in several cases varied between the same molecule assessed in different
studies (Figure 1). No mitigation strategy was possible for this limitation and the data should be
interpreted in the context that the quality of the available data may profoundly impact the
conclusions. Furthermore in vitro activity should be confirmed for the promising candidates.
Fourthly, plasma protein binding can be an important factor in determining whether sufficient free
drug concentration are available to exert antiviral activity [86] and insufficient data were available
across the dataset to determine protein binding-adjusted EC90 values. This is important because for
highly protein bound drugs the antiviral activity in plasma may be lower than reported in vitro activity
because protein concentrations used in culture media are lower than those in plasma. Fifthly, robust
pharmacokinetic data were not available for all the molecules and subtle differences have been
reported in the pharmacokinetics in different studies. Where possible, this analysis utilised the
pharmacokinetics described at the highest doses approved for other indications and checked them to
ensure that profound differences were not evident between different studies. However, in some cases
higher doses and/or more frequent dosing has been investigated for some of the drugs mentioned so
higher exposures may be available for some drugs with off-label dosing. Sixthly, the digitised
pharmacokinetic plots presented in this manuscript represent the mean or median profiles depending
on what was presented in the original manuscripts. Many of the drugs presented are known to exhibit
high inter-individual variability that is not captured within the presented analysis and it is possible that
even for promising candidates a significant proportion of patients may have sub-therapeutic
concentrations despite population mean/median being higher than the Cmax. Advanced
pharmacokinetics modelling approaches will be needed to unpick this and are currently underway by
the authors.
Seventhly, the presented predictions for lung accumulation may offer a basis for ranking molecules
for expected accumulation in that organ, but ultimate effectiveness of a chemoprophylactic approach
will likely depend upon penetration into other critical matrices in the upper airways, for which there

are currently no robustly validated methods of prediction. Also, while a generally accepted method
for assessing KpU was employed, the predictions are not supported by any empirical investigation of
the lung accumulation.
Finally, this analysis assumes that drugs need to be active within the systemic compartment in order
to have efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Since current evidence suggests that the virus is widely
disseminated throughout the body this is a logical assumption. However, ultimate efficacy of any drug
can only be demonstrated with robust clinical trial designs.

Summary
The current analysis reveals that many putative agents are never likely to achieve target
concentrations necessary to adequately suppress SARS-CoV-2 under normal dosing conditions. It is
critical that candidate medicines emerging from in vitro antiviral screening programmes are
considered in the context of their expected exposure in humans where possible. Clinical trials are
extremely time consuming and expensive, and it is critical that only the best options are progressed
for robust analysis as potential mono- or combination therapy or prevention options. Finally, it would
be highly beneficial for activity data for SARS-CoV-2 to be performed with standardised protocol and
with activity reported as EC90 values as a better marker of the concentrations required to suppress the
virus to therapeutically relevant levels.

Figure legends
Figure 1. Assessment of the variation in reported EC50 values for SARS-CoV-2 across the drugs for which
more than one value was available in the literature (A). The consequences of this variability in reported
EC50 in terms of the Cmax / EC50 ratio is also provided (B). Amodiaquine and toremifene were estimated
to exhibit sub-therapeutic pharmacokinetics irrespective of which EC50 value was used. Similarly,
nelfinavir was estimated to have Cmax value higher than its EC50 irrespective of which EC50 was used
in the analysis. For the other drugs, interpretation was highly dependent upon which reported EC50
was utilised and this underscores the caution that should be taken in interpreting the available data.
Figure 2. A bar chart displaying Cmax / EC90 ratio for compounds studied for in vitro antiviral activity
against SARS-CoV-2 for which data were available to recalculate an EC90. Drugs with a ratio below 1
were deemed not to provide plasma concentrations at their approved doses to exert sufficient
systemic antiviral activity. Those drugs with a ratio above 1 (shown in orange) were deemed to have
potential to provide plasma concentrations sufficient to exert at least some antiviral activity for at
least some of their dosing interval at their approved dose. Drugs shown in green were predicted to
exceed plasma concentrations over their EC90 by more than a two-fold.
Figure 3. Digitised pharmacokinetic interrogation of all drugs calculated to have a Cmax / EC50 ratio
above 1. The lowest reported SARS-CoV-2 EC50 (dashed orange lines) and associated recalculated EC90
(dashed green lines) are also highlighted. References for the utilised data are nitazoxanide 500mg BID
and 1000mg BID [87], tipranavir 500mg BID with 200mg ritonavir [88], sulfadoxine 1500mg with 75mg
pyrimethamine [72], nelfinavir 1250mg BID [89], indomethacin 50mg TID [90], atazanavir 300mg QD
with 100mg ritonavir [91], hydroxychloroquine 2000 mg hydroxychloroquine sulfate / 1550 mg base
administered over 3 days [92], Eltrombobag 75mg single dose [93], lopinavir 400 mg with 100 mg
ritonavir [94], chloroquine 1500mg administered over 3 days [95], mefloquine 1200mg over 3 days
[96], anidulafungin 100 mg QD [97]. Robust pharmacokinetic data were unavailable for niclosamide
500mg, ritonavir 600mg and merimepodib 300mg in order to conduct this digitised interrogation of
these molecules.
Figure 4. A bar chart displaying the simulated lung Cmax / EC50. Drugs with a ratio below 1 were
deemed not to provide lung concentrations at their approved doses to exert sufficient pulmonary
antiviral activity for treatment or prevention strategies. Those drugs with a ratio above 1 (shown in
orange) were estimated to provide lung concentrations sufficient to exert at least some antiviral
activity at their approved dose. Drugs shown in green were predicted to exceed lung concentrations
over their EC50 by more than a ten-fold.
