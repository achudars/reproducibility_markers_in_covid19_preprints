Abstract
Public health recommendations aimed at limiting spread of SARS-CoV-2 have encouraged
social distancing and masks as economies across the United States re-open. Understanding
adherence to these guidelines will inform further efforts to reduce transmission. In this repeated
cross-sectional survey study, we describe changes in social behavior in Ohio during periods of
declining and rising cases. While essential activities remained consistent over time, more
individuals attended gatherings of 10 or more people as cases rose, particularly in the 18-29 age
group. A majority of individuals wore masks. It appears necessary to continue limiting
gatherings and encourage mask-wearing, particularly among younger groups.

Introduction
In March 2020, Ohio and other states closed schools, workplaces, and gathering spots to limit
transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Gatherings of more than 10 people were largely prohibited, and
the adoption of social distancing and cloth face masks was encouraged to prevent rapid spread of
the virus1. As states flattened the curve of new transmissions, they began to reopen.
Unfortunately, as restrictions lifted, cases have increased2. Understanding to what extent
individuals adhered to public health recommendations during reopening can help inform current
efforts to shape public behavior and reduce transmission. In this study, we describe social
behavior in Ohio early in the re-opening phase and then afterward as cases rose.
Methods
This repeated cross-sectional study surveyed adults seen at a large integrated health system in
Ohio in the past year and active on MyChart. We excluded patients who tested positive for
SARS-COV2 prior to the survey. Patients were sent a 14-question survey via MyChart about
social distancing and hygiene behaviors in the past 7 days. The survey was developed based on
expert opinion and prior surveys3,4. It was pilot tested for clarity and sent out in seven waves
from May 19 to July 24. After an initial lock-down period, Ohio began to reopen on April 30;
daily cases bottomed on June 15 then rose substantially; mask-wearing was mandated on July 23.
Survey responses before and after the June 15 nadir were compared using Student’s t-tests for
numeric variables and Pearson chi-square or Fisher’s Exact tests for categorical variables.
Secondarily, we compared respondents who stated they “always wore masks” to respondents
who wore masks less often to identify if there were other differences in public health behaviors.
All statistical tests were two-tailed with a significance threshold of 0.05. Analyses were
conducted using R v.4.02. This work was approved by Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review
Board.
Results
A total of 654 individuals responded (7% response rate) and were similar in age and sex before
and after June 15. A majority of respondents wore a mask outside the home, 53% before and
64% after (p = 0.008). More respondents attended a gathering of 10 or more people after June 15
(19% versus 11%, p = 0.01) (Table 1). Mask wearing was less common among those who
attended a large gathering than those who did not (34% versus 66%).
Changes in social behavior differed by age group. Public gatherings increased among 18-29year-olds and 30-49-year-olds (by 25%, p=0.02 and 17%, p=0.05, respectively), but not among
older patients Mask usage increased among 50-64-year-olds (40% to 58%, p=0.03).
Respondents over 65 had the highest mask usage during both time periods. Activities such as
grocery shopping, seeking healthcare, and hand-washing did not change over time in any group
(p>0.07) (Table 2).
.

Respondents who always wore masks practiced other protective behaviors. Those who always
masked were more often female (75% versus 59%), washed hands more frequently (78% versus
46%) and avoided others in public spaces (51% versus 22%). Respondents who did not always

mask outside their home were more likely to visit a friend or neighbor’s residence (58% versus
43%) or a bar or club (24% versus 8%), and have close contact with people that they did not live
with (70% versus 45%).
Discussion
In this repeated cross-sectional survey study, we found an increasing percentage of individuals
attended large gatherings as cases were rising in Ohio, compared to a period of declining cases.
Increased socialization was most apparent among 18-29-year-olds, possibly illustrating ‘caution
fatigue’ amongst those at lowest risk of dying from COVID-195. This behavior has been reported
anecdotally in the lay press, but has not been previously documented. While the majority of
respondents, especially those over 65 years, used masks, individuals who attended gatherings did
so less consistently. Essential activities and sanitization practices remained largely consistent
across time and age groups.
A recent review concluded that face masks do not adversely affect hand hygiene6. Our study
supports this finding, as respondents who wore masks more often followed all public health
recommendations.
Study limitations include sampling from a population that has accessed the healthcare system in
the past year and may be more aware of public health messaging.
As the national conversation focuses on safe economic revival, it appears important to limit
gatherings of more than 10 people and encourage mask-wearing. Messaging should target
younger patients, who are also least likely to wear masks.
