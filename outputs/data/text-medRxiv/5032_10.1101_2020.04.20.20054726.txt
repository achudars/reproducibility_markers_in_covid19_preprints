ABSTRACT
Background: In an unparalleled global response, during the COVID-19 pandemic, 90 countries asked 3.9 billion
people to stay home. Yet some countries avoided lockdowns and focused on other strategies, like contact tracing and
case isolation. How effective and cost-effective are these strategies? We aimed to provide a comprehensive
summary of the evidence on pandemic control, with a focus on cost-effectiveness.

Methods: Following PRISMA systematic review guidelines, MEDLINE (1946 to April week 2, 2020) and Embase
(1974 to April 17, 2020) were searched using a range of terms related to pandemic control. Articles reporting on the
effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of at least one intervention were included and grouped into higher-quality
evidence (randomized trials) and lower-quality evidence (other study designs).

Results: We found 1,653 papers; 62 were included. Higher-quality evidence was only available to support the
effectiveness of hand washing and face masks. Modelling studies indicated that these measures are highly costeffective. For other interventions, lower-quality evidence suggested that: (1) the most cost-effective interventions are
swift contact tracing and case isolation, surveillance networks, protective equipment for healthcare workers, and
early vaccination (when available); (2) home quarantines and stockpiling antivirals are less cost-effective; (3) social
distancing measures like workplace and school closures are effective but costly, making them the least cost-effective
options; (4) combinations are more cost-effective than single interventions; (5) interventions are more cost-effective
when adopted early and for severe viruses like SARS-CoV-2. For H1N1 influenza, contact tracing was estimated to
be 4,363 times more cost-effective than school closures ($2,260 vs. $9,860,000 per death prevented).

Conclusions: A cautious interpretation of the evidence suggests that for COVID-19: (1) social distancing is
effective but costly, especially when adopted late and (2) adopting as early as possible a combination of
interventions that includes hand washing, face masks, ample protective equipment for healthcare workers, and swift
contact tracing and case isolation is likely to be the most cost-effective strategy.

INTRODUCTION

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) characterized COVID-19 as a
pandemic. The virus then infected exponentially more men and women worldwide. In an
unparalleled global response, more than 90 countries or territories have asked about half of the
world's population to stay home (Sandford, 2020). During that time, over 1.5 billion (almost
90%) of the world’s students were affected by nationwide school closures (WHO, 2020b). Other
countries focused on other interventions, such as contact tracing and case isolation. These have
been estimated to be 4,363 times more cost-effective than school closures for H1N1 influenza
($2,260 vs. $9,860,000 per death prevented) (Madhav et al. 2017). Indeed, closing school is
costly—$10 to $47 billion for 4 weeks in the US alone (Lempel et al. 2009). As countries around
the world are faced with the challenge of balancing public health interventions with economic,
ethical, social, and legal considerations, evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
these interventions is urgently needed to guide policy and avoid unnecessary harm.

An earlier systematic review of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce influenza
transmission in adults included only randomized trials, analyzed 7 studies, and concluded that
the evidence was lacking for most interventions (Smith et al. 2015). While we do not dispute this
conclusion when looking only at randomized trials, we would argue that as urgent decisions of
unknown cost-effectiveness are made in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, some evidence,
even of lower quality, is better than no evidence at all. Therefore, we included a broad range of
study designs in this review, and aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the evidence on
epidemic control, with a focus on cost-effectiveness.

METHODS

We report this systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines (Moher et al. 2009). Reviews
(all types), randomized trials, observational studies, and modelling studies were included.
Articles reporting on the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of at least one intervention were
included. We defined effectiveness as success in producing the desired outcome, and costeffectiveness as doing so with minimum economic cost (in dollar value). Articles in English,

French, Spanish, and Portuguese were included. Studies of sexually transmitted infections (e.g.
syphilis) and mosquito-borne diseases (e.g. dengue) were not included. Abstracts, case reports,
and conferences proceedings were also excluded. Hand washing and face masks were the focus
of a number of reviews (Jefferson et al. 2011; Smith et al. 2015; MacIntyre et al. 2015) and a
recent meta-analysis (Saunders-Hastings et al. 2017), so individual studies of their effectiveness
were also excluded. Likewise for school closures (Jackson et al. 2014; Rashid et al. 2015; Bin
Nafisah et al. 2018; Viner et al. 2020). MEDLINE (1946 to April week 2, 2020) and Embase
(1974 to April 17, 2020) were searched using the terms “non-pharmaceutical interventions”,
“outbreak control”, “outbreak interventions”, “epidemic control”, “epidemic interventions”,
“pandemic control”, and “pandemic interventions” (last search: April 19, 2020). Reference lists
and PubMed related articles of included studies were reviewed to find additional articles. Titles
were screened by a single investigator. Abstracts and full texts were screened by two
investigators. Discrepancies were solved by mutual agreement. Key methodological
characteristics and findings of studies were recorded in a spreadsheet. These included first
author, date of publication, study design, interventions, and key findings. Quality assessment was
limited to grouping studies based on design into two categories: higher quality (randomized
trials) and lower quality (other designs). Meta-analysis was not feasible due to the heterogeneous
set of interventions studied, as well as substantial differences in study designs, outcomes, and
effect measures. We described results narratively.

RESULTS

Result of the search
A total of 2,742 papers were found. Removing duplicates left 1,653. We retained 622 based on
title, 137 based on abstract, and 39 based on full text. We found 23 additional studies via
reference lists and PubMed related articles searches (eFigure in the Supplement). Therefore, a
total of 62 studies were included (Table 1). Randomized trial evidence was only available to
support the effectiveness of hand washing and face masks (Jefferson et al. 2011; Smith et al.
2015; MacIntyre et al. 2015; Saunders-Hastings et al. 2017). For other interventions, only lowerquality (observational and modelling) evidence was available.

Cost-effectiveness of interventions
Pasquini-Descomps et al. (2017) conducted a systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of
interventions in H1N1 influenza. They found 18 studies covering 12 interventions: disease
surveillance networks (very cost-effective), contact tracing and case isolation (very costeffective), face masks (very cost-effective), preventive measures in hospitals (cost-effective),
antiviral treatment (cost-effective), antiviral prophylaxis (cost-effective), low efficiency
vaccination (cost-effective if timed before cases peak), high efficiency vaccination (costeffective if timed before cases peak), stockpiling antiviral medicine (cost-effective for highincome countries), quarantining confirmed cases at home (cost-effective for viruses with a case
fatality rate of 1%, not cost-effective for viruses with a case fatality rate of 0.25%), self-isolation
at home (cost-effective with a case fatality rate of 1%, not cost-effective with a case fatality rate
of 0.25%), and school closure (not cost-effective). Based on these findings, Madhav et al. (2017)
estimated that for H1N1 influenza, contact tracing was 4,363 times more cost-effective than
school closures ($2,260 vs. $9,860,000 per death prevented). Other systematic reviews found
that school closures did not help control of the 2003 SARS epidemic in China, Hong Kong, and
Singapore and would prevent only 2-4% of COVID-19 deaths (Viner et al. 2020); reduced the
peak of epidemics by 29.65% on average and were more effective when timed early (Bin Nafisah
et al. 2018); are most effective when they cause large reductions in contact, when the basic
reproduction number is below 2, and when attack rates are higher in children than in adults
(Jackson et al. 2014); and appeared to be moderately effective in reducing the transmission of
influenza and in delaying the peak of an epidemic, but were associated with very high costs
(Rashid et al. 2015). Differences in publication date, virus transmissibility, and study selection
may explain the discrepancies among these reviews.

Using data from Wang et al. (2012), Pasquini-Descomps et al. (2017) found that contact tracing
and case isolation was one of the most cost-effective interventions to control H1N1 in Hubei,
China (less than $1,000 per disability-adjusted life year). In a simulation study, Hellewell et al.
(2020) found that in most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation would be
enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months. Transmissibility was an
important factor: when Ro = 2.5, 80% of contacts needed to be traced and isolated. Timing was

another important factor: with five initial cases, there was a greater than 50% chance of
achieving control, even at lower contact-tracing levels. However, at 40 initial cases, control was
much less likely. Similarly, any delay from symptom onset to isolation decreased the probability
of control, highlighting the need for swift action. Further, Armbruster and Brandeau (2007)
found that contact tracing is cost-effective only when population prevalence is still low (e.g.
under 8% for tuberculosis). In a systematic review, Halton et al. (2013) found that contact tracing
and progressively earlier isolation of probable SARS cases were associated with control of
SARS outbreak in Southeast Asia. In another review, Bell et al. (2006) recommended contact
tracing and case isolation at the start of an outbreak, but not in the late phase, when there is
“increased and sustained transmission in the general population”. In a modelling study, Zhang et
al. (2015) found that voluntary self-isolation at symptom onset can achieve the same level of
effectiveness as antiviral prophylaxis, but that this strategy had a limited effect on reducing
transmission when delayed by two days. Young et al. (2019) also found that delays could prevent
case isolation from stopping incipient outbreaks. Li et al. (2013) found that in 2009 H1N1,
quarantine of close contacts in Beijing reduced confirmed cases by a factor of 5.6. However,
since H1N1 was mild, they concluded that this was not an economically effective measure. In
another modelling study, Tuncer et al. (2018) found that social distancing had the most impact
on the 2014 Ebola epidemic in Liberia, followed by isolation and quarantine. Case isolation,
household quarantine, and contact tracing were the most effective interventions in four other
modelling studies (Becker et al. 2005; Sang et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2018; MacIntyre et al. 2019).
Collectively, in the context of COVID-19, these studies suggest that these interventions can be
effective and cost-effective, and highly so when implemented early and executed swiftly.

Saunders-Hastings et al. (2017) carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of personal
protective measures to reduce pandemic influenza transmission. Meta-analyses suggested that
regular hand hygiene provided a significant protective effect (OR = 0.62; 95% CI 0.52–0.73).
Face masks had a non-significant protective effect (OR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.16–1.71) which
became significant (OR = 0.41; 95% CI 0.18–0.92) when randomized control trials and cohort
studies were pooled with case–control studies (this also decreased heterogeneity). In an earlier
systematic review, Jefferson et al. (2011) also found a protective effect of masks. Overall, they
were the best performing intervention across populations, settings, and threats. Similarly, in a

narrative review, MacIntyre et al. (2015) drew on evidence from randomized community trials to
conclude that face masks do provide protection against infection in various community settings,
subject to compliance and early use. Differences in publication date, search strategy, and study
selection criteria may explain the discrepancies among these reviews. Tracht et al. (2012)
estimated savings of $573 billion if 50% of the US population used masks in an unmitigated
H1N1 epidemic. For hand washing, Townsend et al. (2017) estimated that a national behaviour
change program in India would net $5.6 billion (3.4-8.6), a 92-fold return on investment. A
similar program in China would net $2.64 billion (2.08-5.57), a 35-fold return on investment.

Preventive measures in hospitals include use of personal protective equipment for healthcare
workers in direct contact with suspected patients. Dan et al. (2009) estimated that this measure
was cost-effective for H1N1 ($23,600 per death prevented). However, adopting a wider set of
measures (full personal protective equipment, restricting visitors, and cancelling elective
procedures) was much less cost-effective ($2,500,000 per death prevented). Similarly, Lee et al.
(2011) found that increasing hand hygiene, use of protective apparel, and disinfection are the
most cost-saving interventions to control a hospital outbreak of norovirus. If they are not
adequately protected, healthcare workers can contribute disproportionately to the transmission of
the infection (Barnes et al. 2007).

Suphanchaimat et al. (2020) found that influenza vaccination for prisoners in Thailand was costeffective. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of vaccination (compared with routine
outbreak control) was $1282 to $1990 per disability-adjusted life year. Shiell et al. (1998) also
found that vaccination (for measles) was cost-effective ($32.90 marginal cost per case
prevented). Prosser et al. (2011) also found that H1N1 vaccination in the US was cost-effective
under many assumptions if initiated prior to the outbreak. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios
ranged from $8,000 to $52,000 per quality-adjusted life year for persons aged 6 months to 64
years without high-risk conditions. The authors noted that all doses (two for some children, one
for adults) should be delivered before the epidemic peak. Similarly, in a modelling study,
Nguyen et al. (2018) found that vaccination should be administered five months before to one
week after the start of an epidemic to be cost-effective. If vaccine supplies are limited, Lee et al.
(2010) found that priority should be given to at-risk individuals, and to children within high-risk

groups. Likewise, Van Genugten et al. (2003) estimated similar results from vaccinating the
entire population vs. only at-risk groups. Herrera-Diestra and Meyers (2019) found that
vaccinating based on the number of infected acquaintances is expected to prevent the most
infections while requiring the fewest intervention resources. Optimal control modelling studies
also suggest that early intervention and vaccination are more cost-effective, and that
interventions before vaccines are available need to be balanced with the potential gains of future
vaccines or the potential for multiple outbreaks (Handel et al. 2006; Lin et al. 2010; Buonomo
and Messina, 2012).

In another systematic review of economic evaluations, Pérez Velasco et al. (2012) examined 44
studies and found that combinations of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions
were more cost-effective than vaccines and/or antivirals alone. Reducing non-essential contacts,
using pharmaceutical prophylaxis, and closing schools was the most cost-effective combination
for all countries. However, quarantine for household contacts was not cost-effective, even in
low- and middle-income countries. A modelling study by Day et al. (2006) suggested that
quarantine (of all individuals who have had contact with an infected individual) would be
beneficial only when case isolation is ineffective, when there is significant asymptomatic
transmission, and when the asymptomatic period is neither very long, nor very short.

Perlroth et al. (2010) estimated the health outcomes and costs of combinations of 4 social
distancing strategies and 2 antiviral medication strategies. For a virus with a case fatality rate of
1% and a reproduction number of 2.1 or greater, school closure alone was the least cost-effective
intervention and cost $32,100 per case averted. Antiviral treatment ($18,200), quarantine of
infected individuals ($15,300), and adult and child social distancing ($5,600) had increasing
levels of cost-effectiveness. However, combining interventions was more cost-effective, and the
most cost-effective combination included adult and child social distancing, school closure, and
antiviral treatment and prophylaxis ($2,700 per case). However, the same combination without
school closure was more cost-effective for milder viruses (case fatality rate below 1%,
reproduction number 1.6 or lower). If antivirals are not available, the combination of adult and
child social distancing and school closure was most effective. Similarly, in another modelling

study, Bolton et al. (2012) found that a combination of non-pharmaceutical interventions proved
as effective as the targeted use of antivirals.

In a similar study of cost-effectiveness, Saunders-Hastings et al. (2017b) examined a range of
interventions (school closure, community-contract reduction, hand hygiene, face mask, voluntary
isolation, quarantine, vaccination, antiviral prophylaxis, antiviral treatment) in response to a
simulated pandemic similar to 1957 H2N2. In a population of 1.2 million, with no intervention,
9,421 life-years were lost.. Vaccination plus antiviral treatment was the most cost-effective
intervention (cost per life-year saved: $2,581). However, it still led to 3,026 life-years lost. Only
1,607 life-years were lost at a marginally higher cost ($6,752 per life-year) with a combination of
interventions including community-contact reduction, hand hygiene, face masks, voluntary
isolation, and antiviral therapy. Combining all interventions saved the most lives (only 267 lifeyears lost), but was very costly ($199,888 per life-year saved) due to school closure and work
days lost.

Halder et al. (2011) aimed to determine the most cost-effective interventions for a pandemic
similar to H1N1. They found that a combination of interventions was most cost-effective. This
combination included treatment and household prophylaxis using antiviral drugs and limited
duration school closure ($632 to $777 per case prevented). If antiviral drugs are not available,
limited duration school closure was significantly more cost-effective compared to continuous
school closure. Other social distancing strategies, such as reduced workplace attendance, were
found to be costly due to productivity losses. Closing school for 2 to 4 weeks without other
interventions did not cost much more than doing nothing but gave a significant 34% to 37%
reduction in cases if optimally timed.

Studies on intervention effectiveness without cost-effectiveness analysis
Smith et al. (2015) carried out a systematic review of non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce
the transmission of influenza in adults. Only randomized trials were included and 7 studies met
all selection criteria. The authors found that positive significant interventions included
professional oral hygiene intervention in the elderly and hand washing, and noted that home
quarantine may be useful, but required further assessment.

Jefferson et al. (2011) conducted a Cochrane systematic review of physical interventions to
interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses. They found that the highest quality
randomized cluster trials suggested this could be achieved by hygienic measures such as
handwashing, especially around younger children. They recommended that the following
effective interventions be implemented, preferably in a combined fashion, to reduce transmission
of viral respiratory disease: frequent handwashing with or without adjunct antiseptics; barrier
measures such as gloves, gowns and masks with filtration apparatus; and suspicion diagnosis
with isolation of likely cases.

Lee et al. (2009) carried out a systematic review of modelling studies quantifying the
effectiveness of strategies for pandemic influenza response. They found that combinations of
strategies increased the effectiveness of individual strategies and could reduce their potential
negative impact. Combinations delayed spread, reduced overall number of cases, and delayed
and reduced peak attack rate more than individual strategies. Similar results were found by
Martinez and Das (2014). In another systematic review of 12 modelling and three
epidemiological studies, Ahmed et al. (2018) found that workplace social distancing reduced
cumulative influenza attack rate by 23%. It also delayed and reduced peak attack rate.

Pan et al. (2020) examined associations between public health interventions and the
epidemiology of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Traffic restrictions, cancellation of social
gatherings, and home quarantines were associated with reduced transmission, but were not
sufficient to prevent increases in confirmed cases. These were reduced and estimates of the
effective reproduction number fell below 1 only when additional interventions were
implemented. Those included hospital-based measures (designated hospitals and wards, use of
personal protective equipment, increased testing capacity, accelerated reporting, and timely
medical treatment) and community-based interventions (quarantine of presumptive cases and
quarantine of confirmed cases of their close contacts in designated facilities).

Markel et al. (2007) examined non-pharmaceutical interventions in US cities during the 19181919 influenza pandemic (isolation or quarantine, school closure, public gathering ban). They

found that all 43 cities in the study adopted at least one of these interventions, and that 15 cities
applied all three. The most common combination (school closure and public gathering bans) was
implemented in 34 cities (79%) for a median duration of 4 weeks and was significantly
associated with reductions in weekly excess death rate. Cities that implemented interventions
earlier had greater delays in reaching peak mortality (Spearman r=−0.74, P<0.001), lower peak
mortality rates (Spearman r=0.31, P=.02), and lower total mortality (Spearman r=0.37, P=.008).
There was a significant association between increased duration of interventions and a reduced
total mortality burden (Spearman r=−0.39, P=.005). Another similar, historical study of US cities
found that early intervention was associated with lower mortality (R2=0.69, P<0.01) (Bootsma
and Ferguson, 2007).

Ishola and Phin (2011) reviewed the literature on mass gatherings. They found 24 studies and
cautiously concluded that there is some evidence to indicate that mass gatherings may be
associated with an increased risk of influenza transmission. In a more recent systematic review,
Rainey et al. (2016) found that mass gathering-related respiratory disease outbreaks were
relatively rare between 2005 and 2014 in the US. They concluded that this could suggest—
perhaps surprisingly—low transmission at most types of gatherings, even during pandemics.
Similarly, in a US survey of 50 state health departments and 31 large local health departments,
Figueroa et al. (2017) found that outbreaks at mass gatherings were uncommon, even during the
2009 H1N1 pandemic. In a modelling study, Shi et al. (2010) found that mass gatherings that
occur within 10 days before the epidemic peak can result in a 10% relative increase in peak
prevalence and total attack rate. Conversely, they found that mass gatherings may have little
effect when occurring more than 40 days earlier or 20 days after the infection peak (when initial
Ro = 1.5). Thus the timing of mass gatherings might explain the apparent lack of evidence in
support of their ban.

Recently, Zhao et al. (2020) quantified the association between domestic travel out of Wuhan,
China, and the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Using location-based data, they estimated that each
increase of 100 in daily new cases and daily passengers departing from Wuhan was associated
with an increase of 16.25% (95% CI: 14.86–17.66%) in daily new cases outside of Wuhan. Ryu
et al. (2020) conducted a systematic review of international travel restrictions, screening of

travelers, and border closure. They examined 15 studies and concluded that the evidence did not
support entry screening as an effective measure, and that travel restrictions and border closures
would have limited effectiveness in controlling pandemic influenza. In another systematic
review, Mateus et al. (2014) concluded that the evidence did not support travel restrictions as an
isolated intervention for the containment of influenza, and that restrictions would be extremely
limited in containing the emergence of a pandemic virus. Chong and Ying Zee (2012) modelled
the impact of travel restrictions on the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Hong Kong. They estimated that
restricting air travel from infected regions by 99% would have delayed the epidemic peak by up
to two weeks. Restricting both air and land travel (from China) delayed the peak by about 3.5
weeks. However, neither 90% nor 99% travel restrictions reduced the epidemic magnitude by
more than 10%, and antiviral treatment and hospitalization of infectious subjects were found to
be more effective than travel restrictions. Chinazzi et al. (2020) modelled the impact of travel
limitations on the spread of COVID-19. They estimated that the travel quarantine of Wuhan
delayed the overall epidemic progression by 3 to 5 days in mainland China, and reduced
international case importations by nearly 80% until mid-February. In addition, sustained 90%
travel restrictions to and from China only modestly affected the epidemic trajectory, unless
combined with a 50% or higher reduction of transmission in the community. Bell et al. (2006b)
point out that screening international travelers who depart infected countries (instead of all
travelers entering all countries) would be a better use of resources. Case in point: Zhang et al.
(2011) reported that in 2009 H1N1, only 132 of the 600,000 travelers who underwent border
entry screening in Beijing were infected (0.02%). Travel limitations may be more effective when
neighbouring countries fail to implement adequate outbreak control efforts (Caley et al. 2007;
Bwire et al. 2016).

We found little evidence to support the following interventions: (1) communicating health risk
and promoting disease control measures in low and middle-income countries (evidence not
conclusive according to a review by Schiavo et al. 2014); (2) screening to contain spread, at the
borders or locally (even under best-case assumptions, more than half of infected people would be
missed, according to a modelling study by Gostic et al. 2020).

This systematic review aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the evidence on pandemic
control, with a focus on cost-effective interventions in the context of COVID-19. Randomized
trial evidence was only available to support the effectiveness of hand washing and face masks.
Modelling studies further suggested that these measures are highly cost-effective. For other
interventions, only evidence from observational and modelling studies was available. This lowerquality evidence suggests that overall, when timed appropriately, the following interventions are
likely to be highly cost-effective: contact tracing and case isolation, protective equipment for
healthcare workers, and vaccination prior to the outbreak (when available). Surveillance
networks and protective equipment for healthcare workers also appear to be cost-effective. Home
quarantine for confirmed cases and stockpiling antivirals appear less cost-effective. The least
cost-effective interventions appear to be social distancing measures like workplace and school
closures. The evidence suggests that these are more cost-effective for severe viruses like SARSCoV-2, and when timed early in the outbreak. Vaccination past the peak of infections and longterm school closures late in the outbreak appear less cost-effective, underscoring the importance
of timing.

As many authors have noted, the cost-effectiveness of interventions depends on virus severity.
For SARS-CoV-2, estimates of case fatality rate range from 1% to 7.2% (Onder et al. 2020),
making it rather severe. The cost-effectiveness of interventions also depends on their timing.
Taking this into account, we propose a 3-stage framework for pandemic control interventions
(Figure 1). Interventions are shown from top (most cost-effective) to bottom (least costeffective), according to the three stages described by Madhav et al. (2017) as prepandemic,
spark, and spread (shown from left to right). A complete description is found in the Supplement.

Strengths and limitations
This review has one key strength: it included a broad range of study designs to provide a
comprehensive summary of the evidence. This could however also be viewed as a limitation, as
it includes evidence of both high and low quality. Lower-quality evidence should be interpreted
ed
with caution. Still, as randomized trial evidence was not available for most epidemic control
rol
interventions, and as COVID-19 forces urgent decision making, we submit that some evidence,
ce,
even of lower quality, is better than no evidence at all. In addition, this review has a number of
limitations. First, because of time constraints, our search was limited to two databases
es
(MEDLINE and Embase) and we did not examine risk of bias. Second, most studies focused on
H1N1 and other viruses, not SARS-CoV-2. Third, estimates of COVID-19 case fatality rate are
re
subject to substantial uncertainties. They are likely to change as more data emerge. Should the
he
true rate be high, all interventions would be more cost-effective. Conversely, should it be low,
w,
costly interventions such as school closures may not be cost-effective at all.

Conclusions
Hand washing and face masks were the only measures supported by higher-quality evidence.

SUPPLEMENT—DESCRIPTION OF 3-STAGE FRAMEWORK

In Figure 1, we propose a 3-stage framework for cost-effective pandemic control. Interventions
ns
are shown from top (most cost-effective) to bottom (least cost-effective), according to the stages
es
described by Madhav et al. (2017) as prepandemic, spark, and spread (shown from left to right).
t).
According to this framework, surveillance networks are highly cost-effective, should be
established before the pandemic starts (stage 1), and maintained through stages 2 and 3.
Vaccination, when available, should occur before the pandemic, or as early as possible.
le.
Antivirals can be stockpiled cost-effectively in high-income countries. As the pandemic starts
rts
(stage 2), early contact tracing and case isolation is the most cost-effective intervention. It may
ay
be sufficient to contain the outbreak. If the outbreak is not contained, hand hygiene, face masks,
ks,
and protective equipment for healthcare workers are all highly cost-effective. If these measures
res
are not sufficient, home quarantines, social distancing, and school closures are all effective,
e,
albeit increasingly costly measures. Assuming a 1 to 2% case fatality rate for COVID-19, these
se
measures are likely to be cost-effective nonetheless, especially if implemented early. As COVID-19 spreads (stage 3), and especially past the peak, the costliest interventions can be replaced
ed
cost-effectively by a combination of interventions centered on swift contact tracing and case
se
isolation. Once antivirals are available, they can also replace the costlier interventions cost-effectively.
