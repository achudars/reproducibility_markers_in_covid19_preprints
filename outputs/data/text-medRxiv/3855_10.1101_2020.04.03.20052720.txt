ABSTRACT
Most models of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States do not consider geographic variation and spatial interaction. In this
research, we developed a travel-network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) mathematical compartmental
model system that characterizes infections by state and incorporates inflows and outflows of interstate travelers. Modeling
reveals that curbing interstate travel when the disease is already widespread will make little difference. Meanwhile, increased
testing capacity (facilitating early identification of infected people and quick isolation) and strict social-distancing and selfquarantine rules are most effective in abating the outbreak. The modeling has also produced state-specific information. For
example, for New York and Michigan, isolation of persons exposed to the virus needs to be imposed within 2 days to prevent
a broad outbreak, whereas for other states this period can be 3.6 days. This model could be used to determine resources
needed before safely lifting state policies on social distancing.

Introduction
The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic that poses a global threat. As of March 26, 2020, more than
520,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in over 200 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 23,500
deaths1–9 . In the United States, the first known positive case was identified in Washington state on January 20, 202010 . By
March 26, the epidemic had been rapidly spreading across many communities and present in all 50 states, plus the District of
Columbia; the total number of confirmed cases in the United States rose to 78,786 with 1,137 deaths.
To combat the spread of COVID-19, the government has taken actions in various dimensions, including banning or
discouraging domestic and international travels, announcing stay-at-home orders to curb non-essential interactions for reducing
transmission rate, and urging commercial laboratories to increase test capacity. To curb traveling, on January 31, the United
States government announced travel restrictions on travelers from China; on February 29, it announced travel ban against Iran
and advised travel with caution to Europe11 ; on March 11, it announced travel restrictions on most of European countries.
To reduce human-interactions, on March 13, a national emergency was declared; as of March 28, 39 states had issued either
statewide or regionally stay-at-home or shelter-in-place order, requiring residents to stay indoors except for essential activities.
To increase test capacities, on February 4, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the United States
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s test, which was later to be proved inconclusive12 ; on February 29, the
FDA relaxed its rules for some laboratories, allowing them to start testing before the agency granting its approvals; on March
27, FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization to a medical device maker, the Abbott Labs, for the use of a coronavirus test
that delivers quick testing results13 .
So far, since there is no treatment or vaccine for SARS-COV-2 available, these actions have been taken largely based on
classic non-pharmaceutical epidemic controls. Works on evaluating similar measures in other countries, especially China,
started to emerge7, 14, 15 . For example, the effect of travel restriction on delaying the virus spread in China has been reported5, 16 .
However, it is still unclear what control and intervention measures would have actual effect, especially to what extent, on
abating the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. As the United States has very different political, administrative, social,
pubic health and medical systems, as well as culture from China, this remains to be a critical question to address, especially
considering that some measures and policies come with extremely high economic and societal costs.
There have been numerous modeling works projecting or predicting the trend of the COVID-19 pandemic regionally or
globally17, 18 . Most of the works apply a global model to the entire study area, either a region, a country, or the entire globe.
Rarely the variation of different parts within one area and the interactions among those parts are taken into consideration.

However, a country like the United States features diversity in all aspects. On the one hand, the overall situation of the entire
country is a result emerging from local situations and their interactions, and thus, ignoring the local interactions can hardly
lead to a high-quality overall model; on the other hand, as all interventions and policies finally have to be adapted to the
local situation, a localized modeling will be much more relevant to the real-world practices. Spatially and network-related
epidemic models can describe the geographical spread of viral dynamics7, 19–21 . Recent studies have shown the importance
of incorporating timely human mobility patterns derived from mobile phone big data and global flight networks into the
epidemiology modeling process and in public health studies5, 7, 22–30 . Without accurate models that incorporate human mobility
patterns and spatial interactions26, 27 , it is rather challenging to quantify the sensitivity of parameters, and using the linkage to
real practices to make sensible policy suggestions.
Accordingly, the core of the study is twofold. First, to localize the modeling, we developed a travel-network-based
susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) mathematical compartmental model system that simultaneously characterizes
the spatiotemporal dynamics of infections in 51 areas (50 states and the District of Columbia). Each state or district has its own
model, and all models simultaneously take into account inflows and outflows of interstate travelers.
Second, to improve the practical relevance, we chose to use three parameters that can directly correspond to possible
practical means to discover, combat, and control the spread of the disease, and quantify their impact on the final output of the
model. The three parameters include: 1) the transmission rate b, which corresponds to the local social-distancing enforcement,
e.g., the stay-home order; 2) the detection and reporting rate r, which corresponds to the testing capacity; and 3) the travel ratio
αt , which corresponds to the ratio of interstate travel volume compared to that of 2019 during the same period.
The modeling is a dynamic projection process (see the ’methods’ section). We employed daily and state-specific historical
data to incrementally calibrate the model, and then used the calibrated model to predict future scenarios under different
non-pharmaceutical control and intervention measures. During this process, we ran data assimilation methods to identify
parameter values that optimally fit the current situation (see more details in the methods and supplementary material). To
project into the future, we set different values for the parameters to create different control and intervention scenarios, and
then ran the simulation to see their impact on the model results. The final output of the model is the total number of confirmed
cases in a state on a particular day. The current strategy in the United States is to isolate people who have the symptoms of
COVID-19. An ideal scenario is to have an 100% reporting rate, i.e., every infected case gets confirmed and thus isolated
quickly. Another ideal setting is to have everyone who was in contact with the infected gets identified and isolated quickly as
well. Our model incorporated these considerations and examined such direct isolation of the exposed compartment in detail.
We particularly investigated the impact of quickness of such actions through mathematical modeling and scenario analysis.
A notable result from our modeling is that the impact of interstate travel restriction on the model output is modest. This can
be explained by that when the disease has already widespread in all states, the relatively small number of cases in the travelers
will cause little difference to the local situation, compared with the effects of local social-distancing and isolation rules and the
increase of testing capacity.

Results
Fig. 1 shows the effect on spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious population across states by setting the coefficients
at different configurations. An interactive map-based scenario simulation web dashboard is also available at https:
//geods.geography.wisc.edu/covid19/us_model. We set r = 1 − αr (1 − r0 ) and b = αb b0 , where r0 and b0 are
the report and transmission rate as of March 20, 2020 using data assimilation fitting result. By decreasing αr from 1 to 0, we
increase the report rate from the original r0 to 1, and by decreasing αb we decrease the transmission rate. Most states, except
a few such as NY, MI, and CA, see drastic improvement when the transmission rate is decreased and the testing(reporting)
rate is increased, but the reduction of interstate traffic alone is not as effective. Our modelling reveals that once the epidemic
in an area has reached a certain stage, the difference that can be caused to the local situation by the relatively small number
of imported cases due to the interstate travel is insignificant. According to our modeling, all states in the United States have
reached that stage. Therefore, as long as those travelers follow the social-distancing rules and the local government provides
sufficient testing capacity, there is no apparent urge to curb interstate travel. This is in line with the finding in16, 28 , in which the
authors projected the pick up of the spreading in other parts of China outside of Wuhan with about 3 days delay, and in the
world outside China within a 2-3 weeks of delay, assuming no further screening is in place. Different from China where the city
of Wuhan is clearly the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak and the travel ban quickly gets the rest of China under control,
most of the states in the United States have already had signs of community spread by March 20, 202031 , and banning other
states will hardly make much difference to the local situation. In addition, Fig. 2 shows the corresponding prediction time series
of infectious population in top 15 states under two scenarios (see also Fig. S14): (A) the reported rate and the transmission rate
remained unchanged as of March 20, 2020, with αr = αb = 1, in which most states will continue their exponential growth
before reaching their peak; (B) with αr = αb = 0.1, that is, when the transmission rate b is much smaller and the reported rate r
is much higher (closer to 1), we can “flatten the curve” on the virus (i.e., reducing the spread of the virus).

We further investigate the effect of increased testing capacity and report rate. As shown in Figure 3a, most states see drastic
improvement when the report rate increases. All states, by April 29, see monotonically exponential reduction of infections. The
impact is strong in states such as MA, AZ, FL, and OR, but relatively weak in states such as NY, MI and IL. In Figure 3b, we
study the effect of αr and αb on the basic reproduction rate Re in NY (see other states in Fig. S15). It can be seen that merely
raising the report rate cannot fully make Re < 1. To mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in these states, a proactive approach
needs to be taken, and quick detection and isolation of the exposed population need to be in place instead of being delayed
until the onset of the symptoms. This measure can prevent the exposed population from potentially infecting other susceptible
people. In Figure 3c, we plot the increase of infections in terms of Dq (i.e., the temporal lag in putting a person into quarantine)
for the states that are sensitive to change of Dq , including NY, NJ, IL, GA, MI, CO, WI, LA, TX, PA, MA, and TN. The longer
one waits to inform and isolate the exposed population, the more infected people one observes. For example, there is a sharp
transition for NY and MI. If the average detection and isolation time is more than 2 days, the total number of infections will
significantly increase.
The results again showed the importance of sufficient testing and strong transmission-intervention measures such as social
distancing and self-quarantine policy32 . These policies can help quickly identify the source of infection and isolate them before
they infect the remaining population. This measure presumably comes with a lower economical cost.
We finally investigate the stability of our statements on the parameters chosen in the model. There are a number of
parameters in the model that are determined according to medical studies and thus necessarily contain ambiguity. One
parameter, γ, is especially hard to be set at a particular value due to the lack of medical evidence. This parameter reflects
the level of infectiousness of the “exposed" compartment, a population that is presymptomatic. Recent studies indicate that
presymptomatic patients seem to be more infectious than patients who have symptoms on site33 . We therefore run our model
with different values of γ to identify the significance of this particular parameter. Our numerical result suggests that within a
moderate range of γ, our conclusions still stand true. In particular, as shown in Figure 4, by setting the “exposed" compartment
being more infectious than the “infected" compartment, the numerical solution shows the same trend. We still observe that,
with a higher report rate, the number of non-infected population exponentially increases (i.e., less people would get infected),
and when a proactive approach is taken, meaning that the “exposed" compartment gets quickly separated from the rest of the
population, the non-infected population drastically increases as Dq , the delay of the separation time, gets shortened. This means
that the dependence of our conclusion on the parameter γ is stable, and the above statements are consistent.
We should emphasize that in our simulation, we do not differentiate patients with severe or mild symptoms. A more
dedicated numerical experiment that separates the two categories could potentially give more detailed information. For example,
in another agent-based modeling study34 , researchers consider patients with mild to severe symptoms to evaluate the impacts of
the timing of social distancing and adherence level on COVID-19 confirmed cases.

Discussion and conclusion
Modeling and analyzing the spread of COVID-19, and assessing the effect of various policies could be instrumental to national
and international agencies for health response planning5, 8, 15–17, 32 . We show that the effect of interstate travel reduction is
at most modest in the United States when the outbreak has already widespread in all states. On the other hand, we need to
impose strong transmission-reduction intervention and increased testing capacity and report rate to contain the spread of virus.
The result is based on mathematical and statistical analyses of transmission control measures and in agreement with previous
findings2, 3, 5, 14–16 , suggesting that the effect of travel ban at a later stage of the outbreak is rather modest. This is also in line
with the fact that the outbreaks still occurred in Europe even upon the strong travel ban on the earlier epicenter of Wuhan and
its surrounding cities in China. We also quantitatively show that the transmission-reduction intervention such as policies on
the social-distancing and shelter-in-place rules, and the increase of testing rate, which facilitates immediate isolation upon
exposure, will significantly reduce the total infected population. Such effect is mostly visible for the states of NY, NJ, MI, and
IL. Particularly, our modeling results show that for states such as NY and MI, to achieve an optimal infection reduction, a more
proactive approach needs to be taken to quickly identify the exposed population and isolate them within two days of exposure
in order to ensure the infection reduction. The result is in agreement with previous findings7, 8 .
We do need to emphasize that the model itself does not distinguish different ways of traveling across states. Indeed, if the
interstate travel is conducted mostly through transiting through busy airports and train stations, and the social-distancing policy
is not strictly imposed, then the high population density at these places will bring up the transmission rate b locally in space and
time, leading to a higher infection rate. This is a severe consequence, but it should not be counted as the direct result of relaxing
travel restrictions.
Moving forward, we estimate that the decline in travel has a modest effect on the mitigation of the pandemic. We need a
stronger transmission-reduction intervention and increased detection and report rate in place to prevent the further spread of the
virus. The results could potentially be used to design an optimal containment scheme for mitigating and controlling the spread
of COVID-19 in the United States.

Methods
The mathematical model that simulates the spatiotemporal dynamics of state-level infections in the United States is a modified
travel-network-based SEIR compartmental model in epidemiology by taking into account the variation of the 51 administrative
units and their interactions14, 35–37 . It consists of 51 ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems, with each one characterizing
the evolution of susceptible (S), exposed (E), reported (I), unreported (U) and removed (R) cases per state (Fig. S1 and see
more details in the supplementary material). The 51 ODE systems are then coupled through the state-to-state travel network
flows (see Fig. S2) that were extracted from the aggregated SafeGraph mobility data and weighted by αt 38, 39 . Unlike most
other models, we also incorporate the potential asymptomatic transmission. This makes the derivation of the basic reproduction
number R0 different. Besides, each ODE system also includes two unknown parameters: the transmission rate (b) and the report
rate for each state (r). The unknown parameters are inferred based on the total number of confirmed cases in each state for the
period of March 1-March 20, 2020. The source of infection case data is the Center For Systems Science and Engineering at the
Johns Hopkins University9 .

The ODE system is equipped with the following initial data (t = 0 standing for March 1, 2020):
Si (0) = Ni − Ei0 −Ui0 − Ii0 ,

Ei (0) = Ei0 ,

Ii (0) = Ii0 ,

Ui (0) = Ui0 ,

Ri (0) = 0.

(2)

In the equation, the unit for t is one day. Ni (t) is the total population of state i at time t, and Pi = Si + Ei +Ui is the free
population. ni j is the number of inflow from state j to state i. bi and ri are the transmission rate and reporting rate of state i. cI
(cU , resp.) is the proportion of positive cases that show critical condition for I (unreported cases U, resp.). De is the latent
period. Dc and Dl are the infectious periods of critical cases and mild cases. αt is a parameter to tune the traffic flow.
We emphasize two main differences in modeling compared with existing literature. In7 , the authors study the inter-city
traffic and its impact on the spreading of COVID-19 in China. The situation in China and that in the US are very different. In
China, the epicenter is clear: the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, and the outbreak starts mid-January, 2020. The COVID-19
outbreak in the US, however, is multi-sourced. The consequence is that in the model in7 , the initial condition for cities excepts
Wuhan is clear: the latent, the reported and the unreported cases are all zero. In this model, however, the initial conditions Ei0
are unclear for all states; Another big difference is, according to clinical findings, the latent cases also have the potential of
transmitting the virus, and thus we add the interaction of Ei with Si into the increment of Ei 7, 40, 41 .
The unknown parameters and state variables in the equation set are
∗ bi : the transmission rate with non-informative prior range [1, 1.5];
∗ ri : the report rate with non-informative prior range [0.1, 0.3];
∗ Ei0 : the data for the latent population with non-informative prior range [0, 500].
∗ Ui0 : the initial data for the unreported population with non-informative prior range [0, 200].
∗ Si0 : the initial data for the susceptible population defined by Ni − Ei0 − Ii0 − Ai0 .
Other parameters are:
γ: the transmission ratio between unreported and latent. In the simulation we set it to be 0.5;
Dc : the average duration of infection for critical cases. We assume Dc = 2.3 days42 .

De : the average latent period. According to43 , De = 5.2 days.
Dl : the average duration of infection for mild cases. We assume Dl = 6 days.
αt : the ratio of interstate travel volume compared to that of 2019 during the same period. The travel flow information ni j was
extracted from the SafeGraph mobility data, and we set αt = 0.5 to represent the travel reduction situation observed in
the year of 2020.
cI : proportion of critical cases among all reported cases. We choose cI = 0.1
cU : proportion of critical cases among all unreported cases. We assume cA = 0.2.
There is an essential assumption made in the model: the homogeneity in the population. It means that the traffic flow is a
good representation of the total population without considering their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The
susceptible, exposed, and unreported move in and out of states at the same rate. This explains the SPii , EPii and UPii terms in the
Si /Ei /Ui equation.

The COVID-19 transmission dynamics (the ODE system) was simulated using the Forward Euler method, with each day
discretized into 24 smaller time periods to ensure the numerical stability (see Fig. S3). The parameter fitting was conducted
under the Bayesian formulation that combines the effect of the underlying dynamics governed by the ODE system, serving as
the prior knowledge, and the collected data, appearing in the likelihood function, to generate the posterior distribution that
characterized the behavior of the state variables, including S, E, I,U, R, as well as the two unknown parameters, b and r. For
this classical data assimilation problem, we employed the Ensemble Kalman Filter method that was derived from the Kalman
filter and tailored to deal with problems with high-dimensional state variables44, 45 . The method proves to be effective when
the measuring operator is linear and the underlying dynamics is Gaussian-like. It has been applied to a vast of problems that
do not strictly satisfy the Gaussianity requirement. To apply this method, we generated 2000 samples according to the prior
distribution, and evolve the samples through the dynamics of the ODE system. The samples were then rectified at the end of
each day, using the announced number of confirmed cases, for tuning the two unknown parameters b and r.
At the beginning of the simulation, March 1, only a few states had non-zero confirmed cases. The true numbers of exposed
people and unreported cases on that day, however, are unknown. These two numbers are also the state variables that need to
be inferred to using the collected infection data. On March 1, we put a non-informative prior with range [0, 500] and [0, 200]
over the exposed latent population and unreported infectious population in each state, respectively. Fig. S4-S13 show the data
assimilation results for different states including the number of people in different compartmental groups and their temporal
changes with 95% credible intervals. The average reporting rate r over all states is 0.2266 at the end of March 20 through the
data assimilation method.
For forecasting (in supplementary material), we performed scenario studies of two types. First, we ran the mathematical
model by applying the initial data obtained as of March 20 into the future for the next 40 days, but with different configurations
of (b, r, αt ). The simulation results out of this setting were then compared with those from the setting that the three parameters
remained unchanged for each state. To quantify and visualize the difference, we compared the increase of the percentage of the
non-affected population when the measures of stay-at-home, increasing test rate, and travel bans were enacted.
The second scenario was about a more ideal situation: every confirmed case would get isolated immediately, as well as
those who had been exposed to those confirmed cases, no matter if those who had been exposed had started to show symptoms
or not. We built a new mathematical model that incorporated such isolations to study the effect of them. A new quarantined
compartment (Q) was introduced into the model. Through the simulation, we examined the correlation between the average
action-taking time (i.e., temporal lag in putting a person into quarantine denoted by Dq ) and the increase of non-infected
population. In both scenario studies, the simulation was run with the Forward Euler ODE solver, during which each day was
divided into 24 intervals to achieve a numerical stability.
As a SEIR-type epidemic model, this model describes the dynamics of different compartments of the population, and
assumes homogeneity within each compartment. However, we should note that this assumption may not be valid in real-world
scenarios with heterogeneous populations and infections. Indeed, when an individual contracts the disease, the status could be
either mild or severe. In our model, this is absorbed by the report rate ri but is not explicitly differentiated in the model. A more
sophisticated model should have the heterogeneities included, but that would pose a significant higher computational demand
and more detailed empirical or clinical data support. We leave that to future research efforts.

Figure 1. The spatiotemporal distribution of predicted infected population (in natural logarithm scale) across all states under
different simulation scenarios: (A) αr = 1 and αb = 1, i.e., all parameters took the values of the initial configuration, obtained
through data assimilation method using the numbers of confirmed cases during March 1 – March 20, 2020; (B) the travel flow
was reduced to αt = 0.05, while other parameters values remained unchanged; (C) αr = 0.1 and αb = 1; (D) αr = 1 and
αb = 0.1; (E) αr = 0.1, αb = 0.1. In the simulations, the transmission rate was set to be b = αb b0 and the reporting rate was
set to be r = 1 − αr (1 − r0 ). Where r0 and b0 were the reporting rate and the transmission rate on March 20, 2020, which are
inferred from the data assimilation step.

Figure 2. The prediction time series of the total infected population in the 15 most affected states under two scenarios: (A)
αr = αb = 1, i.e., both the reported rate and the transmission rate remained unchanged; (B) αr = αb = 0.1, i.e., the
transmission rate b was smaller and the reported rate r was larger (closer to 1) as r = 1 − αr (1 − r0 ).

Figure 3. (A) Susceptible population (S) on April 29, 2020 as a function of αr . S(αr = 1) is the susceptible population on
April 29 computed with the report rate set as the original report rate inferred from the data assimilation step. In all states, S
increases as αr decreases, meaning that more people stay unaffected when a higher report is enacted. (B) Re , the basic
reproduction number, on April 29 for different αb and αr in NY. The red line is the level set Re = 1. It can be seen that
increasing the reported rate helps diminish the reproductive number, but cannot reduce Re under 1 if the original transmission
rate b0 is applied; (C) Susceptible population on April 29 for different Dq . S(αr = 1) is the same as in (A). S significantly
depends on the period from expose to quarantine.

Mathematical model and configuration

The mathematical model used in this article is derived from the susceptible-exposed-infectiousremoved (SEIR) [7, 6, 2, 8] augmented to incorporate human movement, and separate the infected
compartment into reported cases and unreported cases. The model is illustrated in the flowchat
below:
In the model, for each state, the population is divided into six compartments: Si (susceptible),
Ei (latent), Ii (reported infections), Ui (unreported infections) and Ri (removed: either recovered or
deceased individuals). The subindex i stands for the index for the state. Among the six compartments, S, E and U are “free” people and can move from state to state, while I, and R are
monitored and isolated.
The model is composed of 51 coupled ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems. For each

The ODE system is equipped with the following initial data (t = 0 standing for March 1, 2020):
Si (0) = Ni − Ei0 − Ui0 − Ii0 ,

Ei (0) = Ei0 ,

Ii (0) = Ii0 ,

Ui (0) = Ui0 ,

Ri (0) = 0.

(2)

In the equation, the unit for t is one day. Ni (t) is the total population of state i at time t, and
Pi = Si + Ei + Ui is the free population. nij is the number of inflow from state j to state i. bi and ri
are the transmission rate and reporting rate of state i. cI (cU , resp.) is the proportion of positive
cases that show critical condition for I (unreported cases U , resp.). De is the latent period. Dc
and Dl are the infectious periods of critical cases and mild cases. αt is a parameter to tune the
traffic flow.
We emphasize two main differences in modeling compared with literature. In [10], the authors
study the inter-city traffic and its impact on the spreading of COVID-19 in China. The situation
in China and that in the US are very different. In China, the epicenter is clear: the city of Wuhan,
Hubei province, and the outbreak starts mid-January, 2020. The COVID-19 outbreak in the US,
however, is multi-sourced. The consequence is that in the model in [10], the initial condition for
cities excepts Wuhan is clear: the latent, the reported and the unreported cases are all zero. In
this model, however, the initial conditions Ei0 are unclear for all states; Another big difference is,
according to clinical findings, the latent cases also have the potential of transmitting the virus, and
thus we add the interaction of Ei with Si into the increment of Ei [9, 10, 1].
The unknown parameters and state variables in the equation set are
∗ bi : the transmission rate with non-informative prior range [1, 1.5];
∗ ri : the report rate with non-informative prior range [0.1, 0.3];
∗ Ei0 : the data for the latent population with non-informative prior range [0, 500].
∗ Ui0 : the initial data for the unreported population with non-informative prior range [0, 200].
∗ Si0 : the initial data for the susceptible population defined by Ni − Ei0 − Ii0 − Ui0 .
Other parameters are:
γ: the transmission ratio between unreported and latent. In the simulation we set it to be 0.5;
Dc : the average duration of infection for critical cases. We assume Dc = 2.3 days [5].
De : the average latent period. According to [13], De = 5.2 days.

Dl : the average duration of infection for mild cases. We assume Dl = 6 days.
αt : the ratio of interstate travel volume compared to that of 2019 during the same period. The
travel flow information nij was extracted from the SafeGraph mobility data, and we set
αt = 0.5 to represent the travel reduction situation observed in the year of 2020.
cI : proportion of critical cases among all reported cases. We assume cI = 0.1.
cU : proportion of critical cases among all unreported cases. We assume cU = 0.2.
There is an essential assumption made in the model: the homogeneity in the population. It
means that the traffic flow is a good representation of the total population without considering
their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The susceptible, exposed, and unreported
Ui
i
move in and out of states at the same rate. This explains the PSii , E

Data acquisition
COVID-19 Observation Data

The only available data in the (S−E−I −U −R) system, for every state, is I, the reported confirmed
cases. We fetch the data from a community-developed, open source project: Novel Coronavirus
(COVID-19) Cases, developed by the Center For Systems Science and Engineering at the Johns
Hopkins University [3] 1 .

2.2

Population and Human Mobility Data

We downloaded the total population data by state in 2019 from the US Census Bureau. In addition,
we collected over 3.6 million points of interest (POIs) with travel patterns in the United States from
the SafeGraph business venue database2 . The SafeGraph’s data sampling correlated highly with
the United States Census populations3 . These mobile location data consist of “pings” identifying
the coordinates of a smartphone at a moment in time. To enhance privacy, SafeGraph excludes
census block group (CBG) information if fewer than five devices visited a place in a month from
a given CBG. For each POI, the records of aggregated visitor patterns illustrate the number of
unique visitors and the number of total visits to each venue during the specified time window (i.e.,
March 1st to March 31st 2019 in our dataset), which could reflect the attractiveness of each venue
and the national spatial interaction patterns during the last March travel. According to the ODE
modeling needs, we further aggregated the travel patterns to the state-to-state spatial scale as
shown in Figure S2. In the model, we set the parameter αt = 0.5 to represent the travel reduction
situation observed in the year of 2020 [14].

Parameter fitting methodology

Each state has its own S −E −I −U −R data. We assume all the states have their own transmission
rate b, and the reporting rate r. In this section we discuss the method we apply to recover these
parameters.
To identify the parameters is a typical data assimilation problem: one has the knowledge from
an underlying ODE model, and the access to evolution data. The goal is to build a probability
density function that reveals the possible value and the probability of the state variable. Two main
ingredients in DA are ODE simulation, and the Bayesian analysis. The ODE system serves as the
prior information, and the Bayesian formula blends such dynamical system with the newly fetched
data to generate a posterior distribution of the state variables and the parameters. The general
flow chart of data assimilation is found in Figure S3.
In the flowchart, Pn|n−1 is the probability density of u upon the evolution step, and Pn|n is the
probability density obtained through the analysis step.
In our case, u is the augmented state variable that includes both the unknown parameters (b, r)
and the state variable (I, E, S, U, R) for every state:
u = (bi , ri , Ii , Ei , Si , Ui , Ri )> ∈ R7k ,
where k is the number of states/regions used in the fitting. We transpose it to make it into a
column vector. We are aiming at building a distribution density function of u over the R7k space.
Gm,n (u) is the solution to the ODE (1) at time tn with u serving as the parameter in the equation

at time tm . The measuring operator is M(u) = [Ii ]ki=1 , and thus we denote
M(u) = M · u ,

with M = ⊗k [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]] ,

meaning M is a 7k length vector that has k nontrivial entries that pick up all Ii information.
We further assume the collected data has a Gaussian perturbation from the true measuring
operator:
dn = M(un ) + η , with η ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) ,
and thus naturally the likelihood function is:
q(d|u) =

Then together with the two formula for the evolution step and the analysis step:
– Evolution: Pn|n−1 (u) = δ(u − Gn−1,n (u0 ))Pn−1|n−1 (u0 )
– Analysis: Pn|n (u) ∝ Pn|n−1 (u)q(d|u)
one can iteratively update Pn|n (u), giving Pn−1|n−1 , the probability density of u at time tn−1 . In the
equation ∝ is theR proportional sign: one needs to normalize Pn|n to make it a probability density
function so that Pn|n (u)du = 1.
There are many choices of data assimilation methods. We choose to utilize Ensemble Kalman
Filter that is steered towards analyzing systems having high dimensional state variables. It is a
technique, derived from the classical Kalman Filter for the application in atmospheric science, with
the analytical covariance matrix replaced by the ensemble version, eliminating the computation
of the the Kalman gain matrix and the Riccati Equation that are typically expensive in high
dimensional space. It is proved to the effective in the Gaussian case for linear forward model

and the measuring operator [4, 11, 12]. The idea is to sample a fixed number of particles on the
state variable space according to the initial distribution, and move these particles around at every
discrete time step with certain dynamics, to represent the newly adjusted distribution. Denote the

where ξnj is a k-length vector with each entry being random variable i.i.d. drawn from
N (0, σ 2 ), dn is the k-length vector collecting the reported infected data on k counties. To
compute the covariance matrices, we set:

n = M · Covn · M .

are matrices of size 7k × k and k × k respectively.

Results

The results are divided into two categories: 1. parameter fitting; 2. COVID-19 infection prediction.
The computation is done on the state level. Data from 50 states and D.C. (thus k = 51) in the
United States are used. The model and data assimilation analyses were ran from March 1 to March
20, 2020, and we predict the future infectious cases in different states from March 21 to April 29,
2020 with different parameter setting scenarios.

4.1

State results

For parameter fitting, we utilize the method discussed in Section 3. Total 2000 samples with noninformative prior are adopted to determine 7 × 51 = 357 state variables. The standard deviation of
noise is set to be σ = 10. In Figure S4-S5, we plot the susceptible, exposed, unreported infections
and removed, in time, for the top 10 states with most total confirmed cases as of March 20,
respectively. In Figure S6-S7, we plot the reported infections in time, for these 10 states. For most
states, the number of reported case grows essentially exponentially fast. Figure S8-S11 show the
inferred transmission rate b and reported rate r. Figure S12-S13 show the time series of effective
reproductive number Re for different states. The signal in the data is rather weak, and for some
states, the number of E and U cannot be inferred at the early stage of the breakout, leading to
Re = 0 for a small period of time for some states.

4.2

Prediction

The first part of our prediction includes the case study for different transmission rate b and reporting
rate r. In the following, we define the ratio between transmission rate in prediction step and data
assimilation step (March 20) by αb , and define the ratio between unreporting rate 1−r in prediction
step and data assimilation step (March 20) by αr , namely
bi = αb bi,0 ,

ri = 1 − αr (1 − ri,0 )

Fig S15 shows the effective reproductive number Re on April 29 as a function of αr and αb for
five states.
We further take a proactive approach by directly identify and quarantine the exposed population. The time in days used to discover and isolate them is, on average Dq . The model is changed

As shown in Fig. 3c, the timely self-quarantine and strict isolation right away or starting at most
about 3.6 days (the median value) after exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus is found most effective
in containing the COVID-19 outbreak for most contagious states in the US.

4.3

Limitation

For the scope of this paper, we do not consider the hospital capacity, and thus we assume the
current or timely built facility can accommodate all reported infected cases. However, if one can
have access to the hospital capacity data in each state, the capacity information can be fed to the
model as well. Furthermore, we do not distinguish mild and severe symptoms in the model.

Figure S14: The prediction time series of the total infected population in the 15 most affected
states under five scenarios: (A) αr = 1 and αb = 1, i.e., all parameters took the values of the
initial configuration, obtained through data assimilation method using the numbers of confirmed
cases during March 1 – March 20, 2020; (B) the travel flow was reduced to αt = 0.05, while other
parameters values remained unchanged; (C) αr = 0.1 and αb = 1; (D) αr = 1 and αb = 0.1; (E)
αr = 0.1, αb = 0.1. In the simulations, the transmission rate was set to be b = αb b0 and the
reporting rate was set to be r = 1 − αr (1 − r0 ). Where r0 and b0 were the reporting rate and the
transmission rate on March 20, 2020, which are inferred from the data assimilation step.

seen that increasing the reported rate helps to diminish the reproductive number.
