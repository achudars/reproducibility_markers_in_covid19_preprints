ABSTRACT

12

Background: During the first wave of COVID-19 it was hypothesized that COVID-19 is subject to multi-wave

13

seasonality, similar to Influenza-Like Illnesses since time immemorial. One year into the pandemic, we aimed to

14

test the seasonality hypothesis for COVID-19.

15

Methods: We calculated the average annual time-series for Influenza-Like Illnesses based on incidence data

16

from 2016 till 2019 in the Netherlands, and compared these with two COVID-19 time-series during 2020/2021

17

for the Netherlands. We plotted the time-series on a standardized logarithmic infection scale. Finally, we

18

calculated correlation coefficients and used univariate regression analysis to estimate the strength of the

19

association between the time-series of COVID-19 and Influenza-Like Illnesses.

20

Results: The time-series for COVID-19 and Influenza-Like Illnesses were strongly and highly significantly

21

correlated. The COVID-19 peaks were all during flu season, and lows were all in the opposing period. Finally,

22

COVID-19 meets the multi-wave characteristics of earlier flu-like pandemics, namely a short first wave at the

23

tail-end of a flu season, and a longer and more intense second wave during the subsequent flu season.

Conclusions: We conclude that seasonal patterns of COVID-19 incidence and Influenza-Like Illnesses incidence

25

are highly similar, in a country in the temperate climate zone, such as the Netherlands. Further, the COVID-19

26

pandemic satisfies the criteria of earlier respiratory pandemics, namely a first wave that is short-lived at the tail-

27

end of flu season, and a second wave that is longer and more severe.

28

This seems to imply that the same factors that are driving the seasonality of Influenza-Like Illnesses are causing

29

COVID-19 seasonality as well, such as solar radiation (UV), temperature, relative humidity, and subsequently

30

seasonal allergens and allergies.

1. INTRODUCTION

44

During the first wave of COVID-19 it was hypothesized that COVID-19 is subject to multi-wave seasonality [1,

45

2], comparable to other respiratory viral infections and pandemics since time immemorial [3, 4]. It is observed

46

that the COVID-19 community outbreaks have a similar pattern as other seasonal respiratory viruses [5, 6, 7].

47

Already during the first COVID-19 cycle the data suggested seasonality, comparable to the seasonality of

48

Influenza-Like Illnesses (ILI), although the time-series were typically too short for definitive conclusions [8].

49

Currently, we are one year into the COVID-19 pandemic, and we can witness in the temperate climate zone in

the Northern Hemisphere, a second wave that appears to rise and peak during the boundaries of a typical flu

51

season, as the first cycle before.

52

Until now, it is not yet confirmed that COVID-19 behaves as seasonal as ILI. Therefore, we aim to test our

53

hypothesis that COVID-19 has a similar seasonal pattern as ILI in a country in the temperate climate zone as the

54

Netherlands. To test our hypothesis, we performed time-series analysis to compare the COVID-19 cycles with

55

the multi-wave seasonality patterns of flu-like illnesses. In addition, we analyzed to what degree the COVID-19

56

pandemic fulfills the qualitative characteristics of earlier flu-like pandemics and seasonality as mentioned by Fox

57

et al. Particularly, a short first wave at the tail end of a flu season, and a more severe second wave during the

58

following flu season. We further expect peaks to occur within the seasonal boundaries between week 33 (± 2

59

weeks) and week 10 (± 5 weeks), and the nadir in the opposing period which coincides with the allergy season

60

[8, 9].

61

The main objective of this study is to provide a predictive model for subsequent COVID-19 seasonal cycles.

2. METHODS

64

2.1 Data

65

Incidence of Influenza-Like Illnesses

66

We used data from the Dutch State Institute for Public Health (RIVM) gathered by the Dutch institute for

67

research of the health care (Nivel) about weekly flu-like incidence (WHO code “ILI” - Influenza-Like Illnesses).

68

ILI is defined by the WHO as a combination of a measured fever of ≥ 38°C, and a cough, with an onset within

69

the last 10 days. The Dutch ILI reports are gathered from primary medical care. Primary medical care is the first-

70

line healthcare provided by general practitioners to their registered patients as typical in the Netherlands, with its

71

current population of 17.4 million. The reports are confirmed by a positive RIVM laboratory test for ILI [10].

72

The flu-like incidence metric is a weekly average based on a representative group of 40 primary care units. It is

73

calculated using the number of influenza-like reports per primary care unit divided by the number of patients

74

registered at that unit. This is then averaged for all primary care units in the Netherlands, extrapolated to the

75

entire population, and reported as the ‘ILI incidence per 100,000 citizens in the Netherlands’. The datasets run

76

from week 1 of 2016 up to week 52 of 2019 to preclude the COVID-19 pandemic and avoid the impact of

lockdowns and other COVID-19 related restrictions on ILI in the 2020/2021 season. We used these data to

78

calculate the average ILI incidence per week (n = 52) as our baseline times series.

79

COVID-19 incidence

80

To calculate the COVID-19 incidence, we used the RIVM data set which reports the daily COVID-19 incidence

81

per municipality [11]. The incidence per municipality is based on positive COVID-19 tests that are reported via

82

the local municipality health services (Gemeentelijke Gezondheidsdienst; GGD), that are under the control of the

83

RIVM. We aggregated the crude number into a weekly COVID-19 incidence for the Netherlands per 100,000

84

citizens, to create a metric on the same scale as the standard ILI metric. We calculated the values from week 13,

85

2020, the peak of the short first COVID-19 cycle in the Netherlands, till week 5, 2021 (n = 45). We assume that

86

the cycles themselves are sufficiently representative for time-series analysis, even though the COVID-19

87

incidence during the first cycle is most likely underestimated compared to incidence during the second cycle, due

88

to test bias. With test bias, we mean that both the method of testing and the test capacity, altered during the

89

development of the COVID-19 pandemic. Especially, at the start of the pandemic, there was a shortage of test

90

capacity in the Netherlands. The capacity shortage had considerably improved since the end of March, i.e., week

91

13 of 2020, but only in the first months of 2021 reached sufficient levels.

92

Therefore, as a sensitivity analysis, we used a second dataset from RIVM, which is based on data from the Dutch

93

national intensive care evaluation foundation [12]. Based on hospital admissions, the RIVM estimated the

94

COVID-19 incidence in the Netherlands, assuming a delay of at least 7 days between the COVID-19 infection

95

and hospital admission. This dataset provides the average COVID-19 incidence per day with a 95% confidence

96

interval (95% CI). Again, we calculated the average weekly COVID-19 incidence for the Netherlands per

97

100,000 citizens, to create a metric on the same scale as the standard ILI metric.

Statistical analysis

100

Variables are presented with their means (M) and standard deviations (SD). We calculated correlation

101

coefficients to test the hypotheses and to assess the strength and direction of relationships.

102
103

Because the time-series were nonlinear and somewhat skewed, we used the log10 transformation before applying

104

linear regression and calculating correlation coefficients, which requires a normal distribution. After the log10

105

transformation, we multiplied the data with factor 2 to create an intuitive scale from 0 to 10 for ILI and COVID-

19, which is comparable to the 1 to 12 logarithmic Richter scale for earthquakes [13]. The logarithmic scale we

107

elaborated is rational and plots exponential characteristics on a linear infections scale [14]. We added descriptive

108

labels to each scale as an aid for qualitative interpretation in intuitive, layman terms (see Table 1). Other

109

advantages are that it makes a comparison between different epidemics or pandemics, and thus external

110

validation, easier. Finally, it enlarges the critical early stages of an epidemic, and it reduces the extreme peaks

111

and resulting test bias because of test capacity overloads.

112
113

Linear regression (F-test) on the ILI and COVID-19 time-series is performed as a sensitivity analysis and used

114

descriptively to determine the strength of the relationship between the COVID-19 and ILI time-series. More in

115

detail to determine the equation using estimates and intercept values, probability, significance level, F-value, and

116

the Multiple R squared correlation to understand the predictive power of the respective relation. Standard

117

deviations and errors and degrees of freedom (DF) were used as input for calculating the 95% probability

118

interval.

119

We have reported the results in APA style, adapted to journal requirements.

120

Correlations are calculated manually in Excel, and for linear regression Graphpad 2021 is used (which we

121

benchmarked on R version 3.5).

3. RESULTS

124

3.1 Data analysis

125

The means and standard deviations of the dataset are summarized in Table 2.

126

Figure 1 shows a short first COVID-19 wave at the tail end of the 2019/2020 flu season, and a more severe

127

second wave during the 2020/2021 flu season in terms of total incidence. The peaks are all within the seasonal

128

boundaries between week 33 (± 2 weeks) and week 10 (± 5 weeks), and the nadirs in the opposing period. The

129

hospitalizations-based estimates for COVID-19 incidence provide likely a more realistic picture of especially,

130

the first wave, given test bias. However, on a logarithmic scale, the first COVID-19 wave appears more visually

131

comparable in both time-series.

On our logarithmic infection scale (Fig. 2), the estimated COVID-19 incidence tops around 6 (severe epidemic

133

level), and the nadir bottoms out around 3 (severe outbreak level). Interestingly, on this scale, it becomes visible

134

that COVID-19 incidence starts to rise slightly earlier than what is usual for ILI (week 33 ± 2 weeks).

135
136

3.2 Statistical outcomes

137

The COVID-19 time-series strongly and highly significantly correlates with the ILI time-series r(45) = 0.75 (p <

138

0.00001). The hospitalizations-based, COVID-19 time-series, providing estimates that control for test bias,

139

correlated even somewhat stronger, (r(45) = 0.798, p < 0.00001), and as significantly (Fig. 3). The correlations

140

(95% CI) of the estimated COVID-19 incidence time-series are almost equal, respectively r(45) = 0.788, p <

141

0.00001 and r(45) = 0.803, p < 0.00001. Therefore, we conclude that the COVID-19 time-series have a similar

142

wave pattern to the ILI time-series, which have long been established as being seasonal. Furthermore, the

143

COVID-19 peaks, similar to ILI peaks, all occur during flu season, i.e., between week 33 (± 2 weeks) and week

144

10 (± 5 weeks). In addition, the COVID-19 nadirs, similar to ILI nadirs, occur all in the opposing allergy season.

145

As a second sensitivity analysis, we performed univariate regression analyses between both the COVID-19 time-

146

series, and the average ILI time-series. The outcomes were again highly significant: respectively F(1, 43) =

147

61.45, p < 0.0001, and F(1, 43) = 81.18, p < 0.0001 and the correlations (r2) are moderate to strong (see Table

148

3).

149
150

4. DISCUSSION

151

Given the strong, and highly significant, correlations between the ILI and COVID-19 time-series, we conclude

152

that COVID-19 incidence follows a seasonal pattern that is similar to ILI incidence in a country in the temperate

153

climate zone, such as the Netherlands. Moreover, the COVID-19 peaks are all during flu season, and lows are all

154

in the opposing period as expected. Furthermore, the COVID-19 time-series is in accordance with the two

155

characteristics of earlier pandemics [4], namely a short first wave at the tail-end of a flu season, and a longer and

156

more intense second wave during the subsequent flu season. This implies that the subsequent endings and starts

157

of each following wave are more or less predictable. If the history of pandemics is followed, the third COVID-19

158

wave would be less severe than the second one. Though nowadays vaccination will be a more important factor in

159

determining the amplitude of the subsequent waves.

Interestingly, all over Europe, the COVID-19 cycles were all more or less in sync with the Dutch COVID-19

161

cycle [15], and thus ILI seasonality, independent of the start of the first cycle, the severity of lockdown measures

162

taken, and given that herd immunity is not yet reached. The seasonality pattern of COVID-19 appears to be

163

influenced though not caused by social distancing and lockdown measures as these measures were mainly anti-

164

cyclical and following the trend. They were increasingly applied to flatten the curve after COVID-19 incidence

165

increases, gradually lifted after the sharper than expected COVID-19 downcycles in Spring and Summer, and

166

only re-applied after the second wave seriously kicked in, during Autumn and Winter. It is beyond our research

167

to quantify the considerable impact of lockdown and social distancing measures, although it might explain that

168

COVID-19 incidence on the logarithmic scale (see Fig. 2) starts to rise slightly earlier than what is usual for ILI

169

(week 33 ± 2 weeks) as social distancing and lockdown measures were increasingly relaxed and ignored in this

170

period.

171

What environmental factors have caused COVID-19 seasonality? We have analyzed before that the likely

172

inhibiting factor causing ILI seasonality, before or during COVID-19, are seasonal allergens (i.e, pollens) and

173

seasonal allergies [8, 9], given that meteorological factors alone are not sufficient to explain the seasonality of

174

ILI [16] or COVID-19 [17]. We used data from a pollen station in Helmond, the Netherlands (latitude 51.48167,

175

longitude 5.66111). On the other hand, we identified solar radiation (UV) as an ILI/COVID-19 co-inhibitor, and

176

it is well-established that dry, warm, and sunny weather stimulates the maturation and dispersion of pollens.

177

The inverse seasonality of seasonal allergens and ILI including COVID-19 is independently confirmed by a

178

recent Chicago (latitude 41.85003, longitude −87.65005) study that covered not only pollens but also mold

179

spores [18]. These findings seemingly contradict an early international study of pollen and COVID-19 [19],

180

which suffers from the same issues as many other early environmental COVID-19 studies: both sub-seasonal

181

bias and COVID-19 test bias. Sub-seasonal bias, means here that a too limited time-series sample is used,

182

namely from January till the beginning of April 2020, which coincides with only a small part of the early

183

upswing in COVID-19 incidence in most countries, and mainly the upswing of allergens in the northern

184

hemisphere. Further, the assumed lag of precisely 4 days seems to be problematic as people typically do not get

185

immediately tested when they show the first COVID-19 symptoms. Additionally, conflicting local outcomes

186

were selectively removed from the study. And, finally, in this short time window used it might have been better

187

to correlate with a sound R0 estimate, correcting for test bias, than only the raw incidence figures, to be able to

188

discern deceleration/acceleration effects during the upswing.

189

We think that studies that are more geographically focused, and work with longer time-series, are in the current

190

phase more meaningful for analyzing the pollen effect on COVID-19 incidence while controlling for deviations

191

in other local circumstances. Therefore, we would expect that, ceteris paribus, the results of our COVID-19 and

192

ILI pattern comparison in this study, implies that a 12-month time-series analysis of the R0 of COVID-19 and

193

pollen concentrations would falsify the outcomes of this international study, at least for the Netherlands.

194

Although the allergenic role of pollen is widely known [20, 21, 22], its role in immuno-activation [23] is

195

highlighted only recently. Owing to extensive COVID-19 research, pathophysiological explanations have been

196

established upon the observation that allergic diseases are associated with lower rates of COVID-19

197

hospitalizations [24, 25]. An explanation is provided by Jackson et al. [26], who proved that allergic sensitization

198

and allergen natural exposure are inversely related to membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-

199

2) expression, whereby it is known that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses the

200

ACE-2 receptor to gain cell entry, leading to COVID-19 [27]. Additionally, it is hypothesized that seasonal

201

allergens, especially pollen and mold spores, compete with flu-like viruses for access to another receptor, the

202

Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) [18], in an attempt to explain the inverse seasonality of seasonal allergens and flu-

203

like illnesses, both for people with and without allergic diseases.

204

Another explanation is based on the higher eosinophil count in children with allergic diseases than COVID-19

205

patients [28], whereby eosinophils are known to clear viral load, and contribute to the recovery from viral

206

infections, supposedly including COVID-19 [29].

207

Furthermore, histamine and IgE serum levels are elevated in allergic rhinitis and other atopy patients which

208

downplay other anti-viral responses (plasmacytoid dendritic cells and interferon-α) but might thus prevent the

209

cytokine storm and hyper-inflammation that typically mark severe outcomes of respiratory diseases, including

210

COVID-19 [30] and influenza. And, it is discussed that homologies between SARS-CoV-2 and allergen proteins,

211

especially from the spores of molds (Aspergillus fumigatus) and the pollen of grasses (Phleum pratense) may

212

direct T cell-mediated heterologous immune responses [31] which might help explain the protective effect of

213

allergies against COVID-19 hospitalization as well.

214

Finally, it is well-established that pollens have anti-viral phytochemicals [32], which is also the case for mold

215

spores [33]. Although the nature of the bioaerosol interaction with COVID-19 viruses is not well investigated yet

216

it can be imagined that pollens and spores might compete with viral bioaerosol in the environment.

217

Methodological concerns

Page 9
218

Test bias, especially for new viruses such as COVID-19, is a major methodological challenge. The approach to

219

use more reliable metrics like the number of hospitalizations to generate an alternative incidence metric appears

220

to be a good method to control for test bias. We could observe that the test bias slightly reduced the strength of

221

correlations, which in our case did not affect the conclusions. During 2020-2021, the test capacity was scaled up

222

significantly and sufficiently, which reduced the test bias concern over time.

223

Another sound approach used seems to be excess mortality estimates. In this study, we decided not to use the

224

latter, as there are other known factors than seasonal viruses that cause excess mortality, such as the heatwave

225

during the Summer of 2020. Thus, using excess mortality would just introduce a measurement validity concern.

226
227

5. CONCLUSION

228

The COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands is till now as seasonal as flu-like illnesses given the highly

229

significant and strong correlations between both time-series. But, also given that COVID-19 waves till now rise

230

between the temporal boundaries (week 10 ±5 weeks and week 33 ±2 weeks) of the typical flu-like season in

231

The Netherlands, and go down in the opposing periods. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic satisfies the

232

qualitative criteria of earlier respiratory pandemics since 1889: the first wave is short-lived at the tail-end of flu

233

season, the second wave is longer and more severe, peaks fall within the boundaries of flu-like season, and the

234

lows are during the boundaries of the opposing season.

235

This logically seems to imply that, ceteris paribus, the same factors that are driving the seasonality of Influenza-

236

Like Illnesses are causing COVID-19 seasonality, such as solar radiation (UV), temperature, relative humidity,

237

and subsequently seasonal allergens and allergies.
