Abstract
The development of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 is an indicator of seroprevalence
and may afford protection from infection. It has been presumed that antibody responses to
SARS-CoV-2 will be impaired in patients with aggressive haematological malignancy (PHM)
due to underlying immunological dysfunction caused by malignancy or systemic anti-cancer
treatment (SACT), placing them at increased risk. Here we analysed longitudinal serum
samples from ten hospitalised PHM with aggressive disease and on SACT, collected up to
103 days post-onset of COVID-19 symptoms. We found that the majority (8/9) of PHM with
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection seroconverted and developed antibodies to the major
SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S1 and N) with most (6/8) produced neutralising antibody responses.
Furthermore, the dynamics of antibody responses were broadly similar to that reported for
the general population, except for a possible delay to seroconversion. Our finding that PHM
on SACT can make functional antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 has important
implications for patient management and serological monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in high-risk
groups.

Introduction
COVID-19, the clinical disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, was first
described in China in December 2019. Since then, it has developed into a global pandemic,
with over 21.7 million people known to have been infected worldwide, and >41,000 deaths in
the UK alone. Underlying cancer is a risk factor for poor prognosis and patients with
haematological malignancy (PHM) are reported to have worst outcomes, although the
prevalence, clinical course and outcomes of COVID-19 in PHM remain to be fully
established1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Early reports of high mortality led to a number of recommendation to
mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in PHM, including self-isolation and modification to
standard therapies to reduce their immunosuppressive impact8, 9.

There is a significant global effort to understand antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2,
not only to define cases and support immune-surveillance, but also to inform strategies for
public health services and vaccination programs. Although the antibody response to SARSCoV-2 in the general population is being increasingly characterised10, 11, reports in PHM are
limited to a handful of cases reporting seropositivity12, 13, 14. The seroprevalence, magnitude,
kinetics and functionality of the antibody response in in PHM remains unknown.
Understanding this is critical as PHM are presumed to have impaired responses to SARSCoV-2, due to either disease- or treatment-associated immune dysfunction. Here we
investigate SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in a cohort of patients with both aggressive
haematological malignancies and COVID-19, who were receiving systemic anti-cancer
therapy (SACT) at University College London Hospital during the pandemic.

Methods
Clinical cohort
Excess serum samples were stored for 10 patients with aggressive haematological
malignancies and COVID-19 between April and May 2020. All clinical parameters,
radiological and laboratory investigations were performed and recorded as part of routine
standard of care.

SARS-CoV-2 serological and neutralisation assays.
Methods as described previously15,16,17

Results and Discussion
We collected serial serum samples from 10 patients (A-K) who had COVID-19 and
aggressive haematological malignancies (Table 1). Patients A-J tested positive for SARSCoV-2 RNA by PCR. Patient K, was diagnosed with COVD-19 on clinical and radiological
grounds, but was PCR-negative. Five patients had commenced SACT for haematological

malignancy prior to contracting SARS-CoV-2 (median time from diagnosis of 30.5 days, IQR
106.5), five had de novo malignancies. Five patients had AML, three B-ALL, one T-ALL and
one had primary CNS lymphoma (DLBCL-type). All patients received SACT within 28 days
of developing COVID-19. Four patients received less myelosuppressive regimens
(venetoclax azacitdine or gilteritinib) in accordance with NICE/NCRI COVID-19 guidance9.
COVID-19 symptoms were assigned from mild to severe15, with two patients requiring ITU
and mechanical ventilation. The median time from symptom onset and PCR diagnosis was
2.5 days (IQR 26.5), the median duration of PCR positivity was 12 days (IQR 24)

(Supplementary Fig. 1) and five patients received a potential COVID-19 modifying agent
(tocilizumab, anakinra, remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine or dexamethasone). All patients
survived and were discharged from hospital, with a median duration of illness of 22.5 days
(IQR 32.25).
Serum samples were taken between 2 and 103 days post onset of symptoms
(POS), and a direct ELISA used to screen for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Antibodies to the
external Spike protein antigen were measured using a recombinant Spike S11-530 subunit
protein10, 15, and antibodies to the full-length internal Nucleoprotein (N) antigen measured to
confirm infection16. A positive result was recorded when the sample absorbance was >4-fold
above the average background of the assay (threshold established using >350 pre-2020
negative control sera as described previously15, 16). Total serum IgG was quantified and was
in the normal range in each case, confirming that any reduction or absence of SARS-CoV-2
IgG was not due to hypogammaglubinaemia. Eight patients displayed detectable IgG
responses to S1 and N (Fig. 1A,B and Supplementary Fig. 2). Two (F and K), generated
neither S1 nor N antibody. K had a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 but was PCR-negative.
Interestingly, patient F (T-ALL) had clinically mild COVID-19 and did not receive COVID-19
modifying treatment. These results demonstrate that PHM can generate antibodies to
SARS-CoV-2 antigens that are similar to those previously identified in COVID-19 patients
without haematological malignancy15, 16.

To compare the temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses, samples
were grouped in seven-day intervals POS (Supplementary Fig. 2). Seroconversion to S
appeared to precede N with only two (H and J) seroconverting to both antigens by day 30
(Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables 1,2). While these conversion rates are
similar to those reported in patients without haematological malignancies15, 16, 17, the
production of anti-N IgG in PHM appears delayed; 50% seroconverted by day 28 compared
to 90% of healthy individuals17. However, it should be noted that earlier time points from
some patients with the strongest responses were not available (Supplementary Fig. 2 and
Supplementary Tables 1,2). To further characterise the dynamics of the antibody responses,
S1 and N antibodies were measured in a semi-quantitative assay18. We observed four
patterns of anti-S1 antibody response (Fig. 1D,E); increasing titre consistent with
seroconversion (patients B, C, G and H), declining titres suggesting waning responses
(patients A, D and E), maintained antibody levels (patient J) and no antibody response
(patients F and K). Anti-N responses were broadly similar to those against S1, although
differences in antibody titre were apparent. Consistent with other reports, SARS-CoV-2 IgG
responses persisted for approximately 100 days after symptom onset (patient B)17.
The ability of antibodies to neutralise virus is important for viral clearance and
protection from re-infection. To address whether the SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies
generated by PHM are functional and able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, we used a serum
neutralisation assay with pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, known to correlate with inhibition of
infection in live virus assays19. We assessed the neutralisation activity of sera from each
patient by measuring their capacity to block infection of Hela cells expressing angiotensin
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 Spike) by a luciferase-encoding
attenuated HIV that had been pseudo-typed with Spike17, 19. Serum was incubated with virus
and permissive cells and the 50% inhibitory antibody concentration (ID50) calculated (Fig. 1F).
As expected, seronegative patients F and K showed no neutralisation activity. Inhibition of
infection was observed in six of the eight seropositive patient samples. Samples from patients
D and G showed no neutralisation activity and both had either very low or unquantifiable levels

of S1-specific IgG (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Table 1). In general, neutralisation correlated
with anti-S1 IgG levels (Fig. 1G); however, some serum samples showed strong neutralisation
(ID50 values between ~1:100 to 10,000) despite low anti-S1 titres (<6 μg/ml), for example all
samples from patients C and J neutralised infection despite low anti-S1 IgG levels. This
interesting finding could be because; (i) they produced a relatively high proportion of S1specific IgG with neutralising capacity, (ii) they produced low titres of particularly potent antiS1 IgG, (iii) they produced neutralising antibodies directed against other viral epitopes, or (iv)
they produced non-IgG neutralising antibodies. Of note, patient C (B-ALL), received
blinatumomab (anti-CD19 immunotherapy) and also developed severe macrophage activation
syndrome requiring Anakinra (anti-IL1), highlighting the complexity in establishing the causes
of the variable responses in this cohort and the need to better understand the quality of
antibody responses in PHM with different diagnoses and therapies.
Studies of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the wider population show
a correlation between clinical severity and the magnitude of antibody responses16,

17

. We

assigned our patients COVID-19 severity scores of 0-416 (Table 1), and those with the
strongest anti-S1 IgG and neutralising responses were generally the most severely ill, with
scores of 4 (patients B and H). Patients who experienced milder disease (severity score 0,
patients A, D and J) produced lower titre S1-specific responses (Fig. 1H). These correlations
are not absolute however; patient C had moderately severe disease but low peak IgG titres,
and patient J (B-ALL) had mild disease but a strong neutralising response.
To our knowledge, ours is the first longitudinal study of serological responses to
SARS-CoV-2 in adult patients undergoing SACT for aggressive haematological
malignancies. We found that the majority of patients positive by PCR for SARS-CoV-2
infection develop antibodies to the major SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S1 and N) and their serum
blocks viral infection in vitro. The magnitude of the antibody response generally correlated
with severity of COVID-19, as is reported in the general population10, 15, 16, 17; however, there
was no obvious correlation between serological response and haematological diagnosis or
type or intensity of SACT. Future large, national studies are required to determine the impact

of different SACT regimens on the dynamics of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and how
this may influence patient outcomes.
Although we saw variations in the magnitude and quality of antibody responses in PHM
that were similar to those reported for COVID-19 patients without haematological
malignancies15, 17, 19, we did observe that the time to seroconversion was consistently longer
in PHM. This finding may be significant for both case definition and for determining the
prevalence of COVID-19 in such patients, but must be confirmed in larger studies, which
should include early and frequent PCR testing to determine the precise onset and duration of
SARS-CoV-2 infection, and regular serum sampling to capture the emerging antibody
response in greater detail. As the development of antibody responses following natural
infection or vaccination is likely to be a key parameter in preventing and controlling COVID19, it is critical to understand these responses in vulnerable groups such as PHM.

samples from patients A-K, and commercial polyclonal IgG standard, were titrated in ELISA
buffer and added to the ELISA plate. Binding was detected with goat anti-human IgG
conjugated to peroxidase and absorbance read at 450 nm. IgG concentrations in serum
were calculated based on interpolation from the IgG standard results using a four-parameter
logistic (4PL) regression curve fitting model. Dotted lines marked with }* indicate the normal

Supplementary figure 2: IgG and IgM responses in this cohort
A-B. S1 (A) and N (B) antigen IgG seroconversion. Serum samples that gave a
signal >4-fold above background in the seropositivity ELISA are marked with a “+”
sign and colour-coded red. Those that gave a signal <4-fold above background are
marked with a “-“ sign and colour-coded grey. Blank boxes indicate that no serum
sample was taken from the patient (indicated in the left-hand column) at that time
interval (indicated in the row titles across the top).
C. Serum samples from patients A-K were diluted to 1:50 in ELISA buffer (PBS, 5%
milk, 0.05% Tween 20) prior to addition to an ELISA plate pre-coated with S1 (A).
Antigen production and assay conditions were as previously described8,13,14 except
that all samples were treated with 0.5% NP40 before dilution in ELISA buffer and
binding was detected using anti-IgM conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (IgM-AP).
Absorbance was measured at 405nm and data expressed as fold-change above
blank background. The limit of detection (seropositivity) was determined as fold
change >4 and is indicated by the dotted line marked.
D. Serum supplemented with 0.5% NP40 from patients A-K was diluted in ELISA
buffer and then added to a blocked ELISA plate pre-coated with the indicated antigen
and three lanes of goat anti-human F(ab)’2 as per (C) to facilitate the generation of
the standard curve. Diluted serum samples were incubated on the assay plate for 2
h. Plates were washed, incubated with goat anti-human IgM-AP diluted in ELISA
buffer, washed and developed using alkaline phosphatase with absorbance
measured at 405 nm. Antigen-specific IgM concentrations in serum were then
calculated based on interpolation from the IgM standard results using a fourparameter logistic (4PL) regression curve fitting model. The dotted line indicates the
limit of quantification in which is determined by the linear range of the standard curve
and higher than the limit of detection in C.
