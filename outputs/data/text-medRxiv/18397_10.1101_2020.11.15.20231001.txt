Abstract

Objective:

patients.

To systematically describe CNS and PNS complications in hospitalized COVID-19

We conducted a prospective, consecutive, observational study of adult patients
from a tertiary referral center with confirmed COVID-19. All patients were screened daily for
neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms during admission, at discharge and at 3-month
follow-up. We classified complications as caused by SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism, immunemediated or critical illness-related.
Methods:

From April-September 2020, we enrolled 61 consecutively admitted COVID-19
patients, 35 (57%) of whom were referred to ICU for respiratory failure. Evaluation revealed
a higher frequency of CNS/PNS symptoms in ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients.
The most common CNS complication was encephalopathy (n=22, 36.1%), which was severe
in 13 patients (GCS≤12), including 8 with akinetic mutism. Length of ICU admission was an
independent predictor of encephalopathy (OR=1.23). Other CNS complications included
ischemic stroke, a biopsy-proven acute necrotizing encephalitis, and transverse myelitis. The
most common PNS complication was critical illness polyneuromyopathy (13.1%), with
prolonged ICU stay as independent predictor (OR=1.14). Treatment-related PNS
complications included meralgia paresthetica. Of 41 complications in total, 3 were classified
as para/post-infectious. The remainder included cases secondary to critical illness or other
causes (n=34) or without sufficient investigations (n=4). Cerebrospinal fluid was negative for
SARS-CoV-2 RNA in all 5 patients investigated.
Results:

CNS/PNS complications were common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients,
particularly in ICU patients, and often attributable to critical illness. In cases with COVID-19
as the primary cause for neurological disease, there were no signs of viral neurotropism, but
laboratory changes suggested autoimmune-mediated mechanisms.
Conclusions:

1. Introduction

Central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous system manifestations can occur during and
after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1–6], but the underlying mechanisms, the
semiology and the frequency of these complications remain poorly understood [7,8].
Limited postmortem studies have shown signs of hypoxic brain injury [9] and neuroinflammatory changes in the brainstem [10], while neuropathological data from the PNS are
so far almost non-existent. As to the etiology, direct invasion of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into neuronal tissue has been suggested in a few
cases [11,12], but autoimmune-mediated injury and neurological complications related to
intensive care management are also recognized [7,8]. The contribution of these mechanisms
to the overall burden of COVID-19 CNS and PNS complications is unknown. Furthermore, the
reported prevalence of these complications varies widely, from 3.5 to 84% [1–6], owing to
the heterogeneity in methodology and case definitions. Some reports include descriptions
of neurological symptoms but no confirmatory laboratory investigations, which makes the
distinction between primary COVID-19- and secondary critical illness-induced complications
difficult [5]. For instance, more than one half of patients with sepsis show signs of sepsisassociated encephalopathy [13] and a further 70% of those with sepsis-associated
encephalopathy develop critical illness polyneuromyopathy (CIPM) [14]. Also, many studies
report on observations made during neurological consultation, thereby missing cases that
are not referred to a neurologist [15]. Finally, most reports include convenience samples,
lack follow-up and do not attempt to determine if COVID-19 complications are caused by
direct viral invasion of the nervous system, by para/post-infectious immune-mediated
mechanisms or by treatment-related injury [7].
Here, we conducted a prospective observational study of a complete and consecutive
sample of COVID-19 patients from a tertiary referral center, including 3-month follow-up.
Our aim was to describe the frequency and phenomenology of CNS and PNS complications,
as well as their presumed origin as determined by neurological work-up, during and after
SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary endpoints were the number, clinical phenotypes and
mechanisms in patients with COVID-19-related CNS and PNS complications compared to all
patients admitted with COVID-19. We hypothesized that these complications would be
more frequent and serious in the most severely affected COVID-19 patients and that
immune-mediated and treatment-related complications would be more prevalent than
those related to SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism.
2. Methods

2.1 Study population

From April to September 2020, we prospectively enrolled SARS-CoV-2 positive patients ≥18
years of age, admitted to Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, a tertiary referral
center in Copenhagen, Denmark. Patients were enrolled from the hospital’s newly
established COVID-19 intensive care unit (COVITA), the COVID-19 intermediate care unit
(COVIMA) and the neurological department. Two of the authors (VN, MA), supervised by a
board-certified neurologist with experience in neurocritical care (DK), screened all three

departments each morning for newly admitted patients with COVID-19. All included patients
had positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) by nasopharyngeal/tracheal
testing, except for 1 patient in whom a clinical suspicion of COVID-19 was confirmed 27 days
after symptom onset by a strongly positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titer. We followed all
patients prospectively from the time of enrollment to discharge and 3-month follow-up or
death. Patients were prospectively screened for neurological and psychiatric symptoms
during admissions at COVITA and COVIMA and evaluated for cognitive status and
neurological deficits at discharge. Patients enrolled from the neurological department were
screened for suspected neurological complications during/after a COVID-19 infection.
2.2 Clinical screening during admission

We used a prespecified screening tool made to detect neurological and psychiatric
symptoms (see appendix, Figure S1) during admission at COVITA and COVIMA. The
screening tool was incorporated as part of the daily clinical rounds by the attending
physicians, and patients were examined systematically at the bedside to detect CNS and PNS
symptoms and/or deficits. Each day, all COVID-19 patients were thus screened for the
following:
I.

Consciousness level as assessed by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Full-Outline of
UnResponsiveness (FOUR) scores. When appropriate, sedated ICU patients were
assessed following a wake-up call and categorized as showing either ‘rapid recovery’,
‘slow awakening’ (defined as prolonged recovery following >24h clinical
unresponsiveness after stop of sedation) and ‘no awakening’ (defined as coma or
vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome persisting for ≥24h).

II.

Complaints of headache and somatosensory symptoms, i.e. anosmia and/or ageusia,
pain, and paresthesia.

III.

Cognitive deficits, motor palsies, sensory deficits, cranial nerve deficits and
cerebellar affection (e.g. ataxia or nystagmus) as determined by clinical neurological
exam.

IV.

Seizures, irrespective of supposed origin (i.e. epileptic versus non-epileptic).

V.

Presence of delirium, defined as presence of auditory or visual hallucinations,
delusional thoughts such as paranoia, psychomotor agitation or reduction and/or
fluctuating consciousness with disorientation.

VI.

Emotional lability defined as exaggerated or uncontrollable laughing, crying or anger
disproportionate to the circumstances.

Further, we collected routine clinical and laboratory data including age, sex, medication,
previous medical history, and results from brain imaging (CT or MRI) during admission,
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results, electroencephalography (EEG) findings, nerve conductions
studies (ENG) and electromyography (EMG), as well as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) prior to
admission, at discharge and at 3-month follow-up.

Two board-certified neuroradiologists systematically re-evaluated all clinical neuroimaging
(if present) of all enrolled patients during admission and after discharge, including CT, CT
angiography and MRI, according to a prespecified protocol, classifying burden, localization,
and (possible) etiology of acute and chronic (i.e. unrelated to the present admission)
pathologies.
2.3 Discharge evaluation

At discharge (i.e. 0-4 days prior to discharge), we evaluated patients with a full neurological
exam, including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA). When a full MOCA was not
possible (e.g. owing to the patient’s lack of English or Danish language proficiency), we
examined with a clock-drawing test to assess executive function and search for hemi-spatial
neglect, and a simple 5 minutes 3-word recall test to assess memory function. Gait function
was categorized as normal, assisted or bedridden/wheelchair.
2.4 Three-month follow-up

Enrolled patients were followed up 3 months after discharge via electronic health records
(EHR). We obtained follow-up data on mRS, re-admissions (if any), death after discharge,
and new-onset neurological and psychiatric diagnoses. If mRS data was not available from
the EHR, we obtained the data via telephone interview with the patient or next-of-kin.
2.5 Prespecified complications

Based on our observed findings from 2.2 to 2.4, we screened for the following prespecified
CNS and PNS complications occurring during admission or after discharge and 3-month
follow-up:
CNS: a) stroke (i.e. ischemic or hemorrhagic, or subarachnoid hemorrhage; b)
encephalopathy [16], i.e. change in personality, behavior, cognition or consciousness,

including delirium and categorized as “mild”, when behavioral and/or cognitive changes
occurred without reduced consciousness (GCS≥13), or “severe” (all other), and reduced
consciousness was only noted when patients were off sedation; c) encephalitis [17], i.e.
encephalopathy PLUS new focal CNS deficits and/or new-onset epileptic seizures PLUS CSF
inflammation (e.g. pleocytosis) and/or MRI changes and/or brain pathology suggesting brain
inflammation; d) myelitis, i.e. clinical signs of medullary affection and MRI confirmed
changes suggesting inflammatory lesions; and e) primary psychiatric disorders, including
depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder or
psychotic disorder diagnosed by ICD-10 criteria.
;

PNS: a) neuropathies, including mono- (e.g. peripheral facial palsy) and polyneuropathies
(e.g. Guillain Barré syndrome); b) acute myopathies, defined as myalgia with motor paresis
and biochemical evidence of muscle degradation (e.g. elevated creatine kinase or myoglobin
at least 5 times the upper limit of normal) [18]; and c) CIPM, i.e. defined as limb weakness
with clinical signs of lower sensory and motor neuron deficits following sepsis, multi-organ
failure, respiratory failure, and/or septic inflammatory response syndrome; categorized as

‘definite’ with consistent ENG/EMG abnormalities or ‘possible’ without neurophysiological
exam.
2.6 Case definitions of SARS-CoV-2-associated neurological disease

Based on the recently proposed case definition of neurological complications owing to
COVID-19,[10] we assigned the observed complications (2.5) to one of the following disease
mechanisms:
A. Direct viral invasion. (1) Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 detected in CSF or evidence of
SARS-CoV-2-specific intrathecal antibody production; and (2) no other explanatory
pathogen or cause found.
B. Immune-mediated mechanisms. (1) Neurological disease onset within 6 weeks of
acute infection; (2) no evidence of other commonly associated causes (e.g. recently
or concomitant infection with campylobacter, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV), herpes simplex (HSV) or varicella virus (VZV)) and (3) paraclinical
evidence of immune-mediated mechanisms such as inflammatory lesions on MRI
and/or CSF pleocytosis or oligoclonal bands and/or brain pathology findings.
C. Complications secondary to critical illness, management-related or other causes. (1)
Other, more likely causes such as delirium, hypoxia, sepsis, metabolic derangement
or other complications to critical illness (e.g. septic or hypoxic encephalopathy) and
(2) if investigated with brain imaging, EEG or CSF study, there are no signs of disease
mechanism A or B.
D. Insufficiently investigated. (1) No explainable cause found, therefore not categorized
as C, and (2) not investigated with relevant CSF study and/or neuroimaging to
confirm or dismiss A or B disease mechanisms.
Patients were classified in the case definitions by two observers (VN, MA) with >4 years
neurological experience based on consensus. Disagreement was settled by a third observer
(DK) with >15 years of neurological experience.
2.6 Statistical analysis

Based on the data from clinical screening during admission (2.2) and at 3-month follow-up
(2.4), we assessed if patients had developed CNS or PNS complications and categorized
these complications as having occurred ‘during admission’ or ‘after admission’, i.e. patients
who were not admitted for an active SARS-CoV2 infection but admitted for a neurological
complication following COVID-19 were categorized as ‘after admission’. Patients were
dichotomized in ICU and non-ICU admission and demographic variables, neurological and
neuropsychiatric symptoms during admission and discharge, paraclinical findings and 3month follow-up characteristics were compared using the student's t test for normally
distributed values, the Mann-Whitney U test (Wilcoxon rank-sum) for non-normally
distributed continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical values. Variables for
binary logistic regression for the development of severe encephalopathy or CIPM were

selected based on biological plausibility and bivariate associations seen in our data. A 2sided p<0.05 was considered significant. We did not correct for multiple testing. All analyses
were performed using Stata/IC 15.1 (StataCorp. 2017, College Station, TX).
2.7 Ethics statement

The Ethics Committee of the Capital Region of Denmark approved the study and waived the
need for written consent because the risks were deemed negligible (reference j.nr.
20025838).
3. Results

From April 1 to September 25, 2020, we prospectively enrolled 61 COVID-19 patients ≥ 18
years, consecutively admitted to Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital. Mean age
was 62.7 years, and the male-to-female ratio was 1.7:1 (63% males). Prior to COVID19,
somatic comorbidities were known in 52 (85%), neurological comorbidities in 11 (18%) and
psychiatric comorbidities in 4 (6.6%) of the 61 patients. Mean days from COVID-19 symptom
onset to hospital admission was 7.2, and mean admission duration was 29.7 days.
Seventeen patients (27.9%) were treated with renal replacement therapy and 35 patients
(57.4%) were admitted to the ICU, of which 34 (97%) were mechanically ventilated (21 in
the prone position, 61.7%) and 6 (17.1%) treated with extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation (ECMO). Ten (16.4%) patients died in-hospital, and 3-month follow-up was
available for 45 patients. See Table 1 for full outline of basic demographics including
previous medical history and admission characteristics, and Figure 1 for an overview over
patient enrollment and observed complications. In the following, results are listed according
to symptoms (Tables 2-4), investigations (Figure 2 and Table 5) and clinical diagnoses (Table
6).
3.1 Clinical screening during admission
3.1.1 Neurological symptoms

The most common neurological finding was motor weakness seen in 21 patients (34.4%)
which was significantly more prevalent in ICU-patients (54%) compared to non-ICU patients
(7.7%), p=0.002. The second most common finding was anosmia and/or ageusia in 18
patients (29.5%), significantly more prevalent in non-ICU patients (46.2%) compared to ICUpatients (17.1%), p=0.02. Ten patients (16.4%) complained of headache and 3 (4.9%) of
sensory symptoms, which were not attributable to a specific cause. Seizures were observed
in 3 patients (4.9%), including epileptic seizures in 2 of these patients (generalized tonicclonic seizures), and non-epileptic seizures in 1 patient with dystonic painful
contractions/seizures in the right hand lasting 10-20 seconds every day for 6 days.
Unfortunately, no brain imaging or EEG was performed in the latter patient because he
deteriorated in respiratory function and died in the ICU.
Of the 35 ICU-admitted patients, 9 (26.4%) had prolonged awakening from sedation and
clinical unresponsiveness in >24h, resulting in EEG investigations in 7 patients. Two patients
(5.9%) were in prolonged coma off sedation, resulting in death due to withdrawal of lifesupporting therapy following discussions with the families.

3.1.2 Neuropsychiatric symptoms

A total of 21 (34.4%) patients had delirium during admission lasting 7.1 days (mean,
standard deviation (SD) 6.9), which was significantly more frequent in ICU-patients (54.3%)
compared to non-ICU patients (7.7%), p<0.001. The most common finding in delirious
patients was hallucinations (12 patients, 20.3%). Table 2 shows a full outline of CNS and PNS
symptoms during admission.
3.1.3 Laboratory investigations

During admission, CT was performed in 16 patients (26.2%), MRI in 7 patients (11.4%), EEG
in 12 patients (19.7%), and CSF was investigated in 8 patients (13.1%). ICU-admitted patients
were more frequently investigated with EEG than non-ICU patients (28.6% vs. 7.7%, p=0.04),
and the most common findings were compatible with an encephalopathic curve, i.e.
background slowing including increased theta and delta activity, seen in 50% of all the
investigated patients, and frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) seen in 40% of
the investigated patients. Of 8 patients who had CSF investigations during the study period,
3 patients had pleocytosis (cell count >5 cells/microl): In one patient with severe headache
and respiratory failure, a lumbar puncture showed 13 cells/microl with microbiological
investigations revealing intrathecal varicella zoster antibodies, but CSF SARS-CoV-2 PCR was
not performed. The other 2 patients with CSF pleocytosis had myelitis and encephalitis (see
3.4 for details). Five of the 8 CSF samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and all were
negative. For full outline of paraclinical findings see Table 5 and Figure 2.
3.2 Clinical screening at discharge
Of the 61 patients, 53 (86.9%) were examined at discharge with a full neurological exam,
including cognitive screening for amnesia, dysexecutive function, apraxia, aphasia and
neglect; and 32 patients (52.5%) were examined with a MOCA. As already stated, 10
patients died during their hospital stay (16.4%).
3.2.1 Neurological symptoms

We observed tetraparesis with hyporeflexia and muscle atrophy in 8/53 (15%) and gait
impairment categorized as bedridden/wheelchair in 12/53 (22.6%) patients, which both
were significantly more frequent in ICU patients, p=0.002 and p=0.001, respectively. Median
MOCA score was 22 in the total population, but lower in patients admitted to the ICU
(median 19.5) than in non-ICU patients (median 25), p-value = 0.02. Median mRS at
discharge was 3 (IQR 2-5). See Table 3 for full data on discharge evaluation.
3.2.2 Neuropsychiatric symptoms

Amnesia (n=18/53, 34.0%) and dysexecutive function (20/53, 37.7%) were the most
common cognitive deficits and more prevalent in ICU patients compared to non-ICU
patients, p=0.01 and p<0.001, respectively.
3.3 Follow-up after 3-month

Three-month follow-up data was available for 45 patients (Table 4). The median 3-month
mRS was 1 (IQR 1-2), which was not significantly different between ICU-admitted (mRS=1,

IQR: 0.5-2.5) and the remaining patients (mRS=1, IQR: 1-2). Seventeen patients (37.8%)
were re-hospitalized after discharge, and 4 of these (23.5%) were re-hospitalized at a
neurological department: One patient had a new-onset ischemic stroke; 1 had recurrent
generalized tonic-clonic seizures due to hypomagnesemia secondary to a refeeding
syndrome; 1 had memory decline and gait difficulties with brain MRI showing normal
pressure hydrocephalus; and finally, 1 patient had new-onset mild dysphagia, tongue palsy
and a right sided drop-foot, compatible with hypoglossal and peroneal nerve injuries,
investigated with a brain MRI with normal findings and ENG showing bilateral mild peroneal
nerve affection; symptoms resolved spontaneously after 3 weeks. Follow-up data was
missing for 16 patients (10 deaths, 6 patients with less than 3-month follow-up).
3.4 CNS and PNS complications during admission and at 3-month follow-up

Based on the definition of complications as outlined in section 2.5 (see Methods) and
prospective observations during admission, discharge and at 3-month follow-up, we
observed and diagnosed the complications outlined below and in Table 6.
3.4.1 Cerebrovascular

Four patients had new-onset ischemic stroke, 2 patients during their COVID-19 admission
and 2 patients between discharge and 3-month follow-up. Mean age of the patients was 75
years (SD 3.1), time from COVID-19 symptom debut to stroke onset was 40.5 days (median),
and all patients had one or several cardiovascular risk factors.
3.4.2 CNS

A total of 19 patients (31.1%) had signs of encephalopathy at some stage during their
admission, and 13 (68.4%) of those were categorized as having severe encephalopathy (GCS
12 or less). Patients with severe encephalopathy had significantly longer hospital stays
(median 21 vs. 44 days without encephalopathy, p <0.001), required more often treatment
with haloperidol (61.5% vs. 16.7% with less severe encephalopathy, p=0.03) and were more
often admitted to the ICU (80% vs. 50% of all patients, p=0.04). Among the 13 patients with
severe encephalopathy, we encountered 8 patients who were apathetic and severely
hypokinetic/akinetic, with almost no voluntary movements and without any verbal output,
yet they were able to follow the examiner with the eyes and indicate yes and no to
questions by nodding or shaking their heads. On examination, all these patients had a
palmomental reflex. This state of akinetic mutism lasted for a median of 4 days (IQR 2.56.5). Seven of the 8 patients with akinetic mutism had been admitted to the ICU, 5 required
dialysis for renal failure, 4 were treated with haloperidol for delirium, 3 had FIRDA on EEG, 1
had multiregional sharp waves on EEG, and 1 patient had a non-traumatic cortical
subarachnoid bleed in the right frontal lobe.
Two patients were diagnosed as having encephalitis. One patient, previously healthy, was
admitted with generalized epileptic seizures 10 days after onset of fever, dry cough and
myalgia and a strongly positive IgG antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3a). Brain MRI
showed bilateral basal ganglia ischemic/inflammatory lesions with hemorrhagic
transformation, and CSF showed normal cell and protein count; CSF SARS-CoV-2 PCR was
negative. A brain biopsy was obtained to rule out a brain abscess, but investigations for a
microbiological, fungal or neoplastic etiology were negative. Biopsy showed multiple

fibrinous thrombosis in the microvasculature in keeping with a histological diagnosis of
hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalitis. The patient was diagnosed as having COVID-19
associated acute necrotizing encephalitis and referred for neurorehabilitation.
The second patient with encephalitis had a medical history of kidney transplantation and
immunosuppression and was admitted due to myalgia and a dry cough with a positive SARSCoV-2 PCR on pharyngeal swab and, 11 days later, developed severe apathy, amnesia and
initially mild aphasia but no other focal deficits (Figure 3b). Brain MRI showed multiple
ischemic lesions bilaterally in the basal ganglia, thalami, juxtacortical white matter and in
the right side of the pons. CSF analysis revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis (250 cells/microl),
and microbiological screening showed positive EBV, HSV-1 and VZV DNA copies (which the
attending microbiologist concluded was reactive and associated with chronic
immunosuppressive therapy). SARS-CoV-2 PCR on CSF material was negative, but SARS-CoV2 antibodies were positive in the CSF. The patient was discharged to neurorehabilitation and
improved slowly with a decline in CSF cell count on follow-up without specific treatment.
One patient developed lumbar pain, thoracic numbness with a sensory level at T5, urinary
retention and mild paraparesis 13 days after COVID-19 symptom onset with myalgia and
fever, and 6 days after remission of COVID-19 symptoms (Figure 3c). Spinal MRI showed
transverse myelitis, CSF analysis revealed 125 lymphocytic cells/microl, and microbiological
screening including SARS-CoV-2 PCR was negative. The patient made an uneventful recovery
following steroid treatment and plasma exchange.
We used a logistic regression model with the covariates age, sex, number of admission days
number of days in the ICU, dialysis, delirium, and treatment with haloperidol. We found that
duration of ICU admission was an independent predictor for severe encephalopathy with an
increase of OR=1.23 (95% CI=1.03-1.47) for each day in the ICU, p=0.02.
3.4.3 PNS

During admission, we observed 9 (13.1%) patients with PNS complications. Eight patients
were tetraparetic at discharge, had muscle atrophy and hyporeflexia, and all had been
admitted to the ICU. One of these 8 patients was investigated with ENG/EMG and diagnosed
with definite CIPM, the remainder were categorized as having possible CIPM. All 8 patients
with definite or possible CIPM, when compared to patients without neuromuscular
complications, had significantly longer admissions (median 49.5 vs. 23 days, p<0.001), were
more frequently admitted to the ICU (100% vs. 40%, p=0.002), more often treated with
renal replacement therapy (62% vs. 14%, p=0.008), and were more often delirious (75% vs.
30%, p=0.02).
Further, one patient was admitted with rhabdomyolysis and kidney failure with a peak
creatine kinase of 74.000 Units/L. Following symptomatic treatment including forced
diuresis, the patient was discharged with proximal paraparesis to rehabilitation with a
diagnosis of acute myopathy.
From discharge to 3-month follow-up, we observed 4 patients with PNS complications.

Two ICU patients complained of burning paranesthesia and numbness of the lateral thigh
(bilaterally in one case) and were diagnosed as having meralgia paresthetica. Both patients
had been ventilated in the prone position leading to compression of the

lateral femoral

cutaneous nerve.

Two patients developed a peripheral facial palsy after discharge. One patient had a right-sided
palsy together with a cutaneous rash in the neck 3 months after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, and
microbiological cultures and antibody tests of the skin lesion confirmed varicella zoster virus
infection (VZV). The CSF was notable for a marginal pleocytosis of 7, protein of 0.7g/L, negative
borrelia, VZV, herpes simplex virus, enterovirus screening and negative CXCL-13. The second
patient developed peripheral facial palsy 40 days after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test; there were <3
cells in the CSF, protein was 0.16g/L, and screening for herpes simplex virus, VZV, Epstein Barr
virus and cultures were negative. Neither of the patients' CSF specimens were screened for
SARS-CoV-2.

One patient was seen 5 weeks after discharge with a right-sided foot drop, mild dysphagia and a
tongue palsy deviating to the left. Brain MRI was unremarkable, and ENG showed mild bilateral
peroneal

nerve

affection.

We used a logistic regression model with the covariates of total admission days, dialysis,
delirium, ICU admission and age, and found that the duration of admission was an
independent risk factor for (possible) CIPM with an increase of OR=1.14 (95% CI=1.00-1.32)
for each day of admission, p=0.046.
3.5 Case definitions
The observed complications as outlined in 3.4 were classified in 4 different groups based on a
case definition approach described in Methods:

No complications met criteria for ‘direct viral invasion’ (A), 3 complications met criteria for

immune-mediated mechanisms’ (B), 34 complications were categorized as ‘complications
secondary to critical illness, management-related or other causes’ (C) and 4 complications
which could not be categorized as A, B or C were labeled ‘insufficiently investigated’ (D).

4. Discussion

In this prospective study of consecutively enrolled hospitalized COVID-19 patients, half of
which were admitted to the ICU, we evaluated the semiology, frequency and cause of CNS
and PNS complications of COVID-19 during admission and at discharge, including 3-month
follow-up. As hypothesized, these complications were immune-mediated or treatmentrelated and more frequent and serious in COVID-19 patients requiring ICU management.
The most common CNS complication was encephalopathy encountered in roughly ⅓ of all
COVID-19 patients, with duration of ICU admission being an independent predictor. The
most common PNS complication was CIPM, seen in 13% of patients, again with length of
admission as an independent predictor. After applying our case criteria described in
Methods, only 3 observed complications met criteria for SARS-CoV-2 associated immunemediated neurological disease: 2 encephalitides and 1 myelitis. All other complications were

classified as either secondary to critical illness or other causes or were insufficiently
investigated.
4.1 Encephalopathy

Encephalopathy affected roughly a third of COVID-19 patients, which is consistent with a
recent retrospective study [19], yet considerably lower than previous reports from the early
phase of the pandemic (69%) [1], and much higher than another, prospective recent report
(6.8%) [15]. This probably reflects differences in methodology as outlined below.
Interestingly, we encountered 8 patients with akinetic mutism, i.e. they were apathetic and
profoundly hypokinetic with almost no voluntary movements and without any verbal
output, although they were able to indicate yes and no by nodding with their heads when
spoken to. On neurological exam, all these patients had some frontal release signs (e.g.
palmomentum reflexes), and during our systematic daily clinical evaluation we found this to
be a transient phenomenon lasting for a median of 4 days. Akinetic mutism has been
described in a COVID-19 case report, lasting 5 days [20], and in a case-series of 4 patients
[21]; all 5 patients had frontal FDG-PET hypometabolism, while CSF and MRI findings were
normal [20,21]. Akinetic mutism is typically associated with frontal lobe injury [22], and we
indeed observed frontal lobe abnormalities, including a small frontal lobe cortical
subarachnoid hemorrhage in one patient and FIRDA in 3 of 4 patients investigated with EEG,
while MRI in 3 and CSF in 2 patients were unremarkable. Seven of our 8 patients had long
ICU admissions (median 21 days) and sepsis with multiorgan injury, and all had delirium.
Indeed, hypokinetic delirium, which has clinical similarities to akinetic mutism, is the most
frequent motor subtype of delirium [23], and brain FDG-PET of delirious patients may show
cortical hypometabolism, most frequently in the frontal lobes [24].
4.2 Encephalitis and myelitis

We observed 3 cases of CNS inflammation compatible with para- or post-infectious immune
mediated complications to COVID-19 (Figure 3). One patient was diagnosed with probable
COVID-19-associated acute necrotizing encephalitis, after extensive laboratory evaluation
including a brain biopsy and a whole body FDG-PET ruled out other microbiological,
autoimmune or neoplastic causes. Three previous cases of acute necrotizing encephalitis
have been reported with COVID-19 [25–27]. All 3 patients, like ours, were females aged 30
to 40 years with neurological symptoms within 2 weeks of COVID-19 onset. Two cases
[25,26] were believed to be caused by an indirect immune-mediated hyperinflammation
(i.e. a cytokine storm) [28], which also has been reported with other viral infections
including influenza [29,30], whereas in the third case [27] low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
were detected in the CSF indicating possibly direct viral neuronal injury.
Our second encephalitis patient had negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR but positive SARS-CoV-2
antibody testing in CSF. Given the pleocytosis of 250 cells, a protein of 1.13 g/L and a
negative viral PCR, a plausible explanation for the positive antibody test would be blood
contamination due to a leaky blood-brain-barrier and not direct viral invasion. Patients with
neurological symptoms and positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR in CSF samples have been reported
[11,12], but the majority of patients with neurological manifestations investigated with PCR
11

on CSF had undetected levels of SARS-CoV-2 [8]. This was consistent with our finding that all
5 CSF samples investigated for SARS-CoV-2 were PCR negative.
Our third case of probable immune-mediated CNS inflammation was a patient with
monophasic myelitis who made an uneventful recovery, with neurological symptom onset
within 14 days after COVID-19 symptom debut and negative SARS-CoV-2 CSF PCR. As in
another reported case [31], investigations for other causes of myelitis were negative. Longterm follow-up is needed to determine the risk for recurrence.
4.3 Neuromuscular complications

Eight of our patients had hypotonic tetraparesis with hypo- or areflexia and muscle atrophy.
Unfortunately, owing to lockdown measures to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, only one
patient was investigated with nerve conduction studies which were consistent with CIPM.
All 8 patients had prolonged admissions to the ICU, sepsis and multi-organ failure,
resembling typical ICU-acquired weakness [32]. Previous studies on PNS complications in
COVID-19 have mainly focused on Guillain Barré syndrome [33] which we did not observe,
even though our center is the referral center for GBS cases in the Greater Copenhagen area
with 1.9 million inhabitants. We did, however, observe one case of rhabdomyolysis as a
presenting complication of COVID-19, and myalgia with elevated CK in COVID-19 has indeed
been previously reported [33]. Our patient with rhabdomyolysis and acute myopathy had no
obvious cause for muscle injury other than COVID-19, but we were unable to obtain a
muscle biopsy to determine if there were signs of direct viral invasion or inflammatory cell
infiltrates.
Two of our patients were diagnosed with meralgia paresthetica, which has been reported as
a complication following mechanical ventilation in the prone position in non-COVID-19 [34]
and in COVID-19 patients [35]. As prone positioning in acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) is strongly recommended [36] (and was performed in 61.7% of our ICU population),
attention to peripheral nerve injury in COVID-19 ICU survivors seems warranted [37].
Further 2 patients developed a peripheral facial palsy after discharge. One patient had a
concomitant VZV infection affecting the neck which was felt to be the most probable
underlying etiology of the peripheral facial palsy, while the second patient had no plausible
cause other than a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Unfortunately, the patients’ CSF samples
were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In a case-series of 8 patients with COVID-19 associated
peripheral facial palsy, all CSF studies were without inflammation (as in our cases), and 5
had PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF with negative results in all [38].
4.4 Methodological considerations

Besides prospectively screening for CNS and PNS symptoms during admission and at
discharge, we adapted a case definition approach [7] to categorize complications into
distinctive groups of suspected disease mechanisms. The vast majority (83%) was
categorized as ‘complications secondary to critical illness, management-related or other
causes’; much fewer complications were categorized as ‘indirect immune-mediated’ (7.3%);
and none were categorized as “direct viral invasion”. A case definition approach has the

benefit of attributing neurological disease to COVID-19 only when extensive laboratory
investigations have been performed and other known causes have been excluded. This is
important to avoid falsely assigning symptoms and signs to COVID-19 when in fact there is
unrelated pathology: We encountered a remarkable patient who was diagnosed as having
cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and
leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) prompted by typical neuroimaging features, including
bilateral anterior temporal lobe FLAIR hyperintensities, on MRI performed for prolonged
encephalopathy following COVID-19 (online appendix, Figure S2). We did not include this
patient in our prospective cohort because she presented to us several months after COVID19. A similar case of CADASIL diagnosed in a COVID-19 patient owing to unsuspected MRI
features has recently been described [39].
Our study has several other strengths: We evaluated a complete and consecutive sample of
patients from a tertiary care center with detailed clinical characteristics, and we did not
restrict inclusion to patients with a priori neurological presentations but enrolled all patients
admitted, irrespective of their clinical symptoms. We distinguished between symptoms,
investigations and clinical diagnoses. Unlike retrospective studies that depend on correct
EHR coding for data extraction [1–4], we examined patients systematically and prospectively
during the entire hospital stay and at discharge, thereby reducing the likelihood for
underestimation of CNS and PNS complications. Like our study, a recent large prospective
study [15] reported on pre-specified diagnoses but, unlike ours, its data was extracted from
chart review of notes provided during neurology hospital consultation service. In our
experience, not all patients are referred for neurologist consultation but are managed by
anesthesiologists and infectious disease specialists instead, which probably leads to care
providers overlooking neurological complications to some degree.
As to limitations, our cohort size was small, owing to the comparatively low burden of
COVID-19 in the general population in Denmark in early 2020 [40]; patients were highly
selected as ours is a tertiary referral center, which limits the generalizability of our findings;
not all patients were sufficiently investigated; and we did not include a control group of
non-COVID-19 patients. Future case-control studies are necessary to determine if SARS-CoV2 infections are causal or coincidental and if complications are indeed more prevalent in
COVID-19 patients compared to non-COVID-19 patients.
5. Conclusions

Neurological complications are common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, occur mainly in
severely affected patients in the ICU and can often be attributed to critical illness. In cases in
which neurological disease was likely directly associated with COVID-19, we did not find
signs of viral invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into the CNS or PNS, but laboratory inflammatory
changes suggested autoimmune-mediated para- and post-infectious mechanisms. In this
consecutive sample of 61 COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary hospital, the most
common CNS and PNS complications were encephalopathy and CIPM, respectively, while
other specific neurological presentations included akinetic mutism, acute necrotizing
encephalopathy, transverse myelitis (autoimmune-mediated, CNS), and meralgia
paresthetica (treatment-related, PNS).

Prevalence of prespecified complications observed in 61 prospectively enrolled COVID-19
patients, hospitalized in a tertiary center from April 1 to September 25, 2020. Patients were
dichotomized in ICU and non-ICU patients. The observation period was from admission to 3month after discharge or death. N = number of patients with the specified complication, one
patient may have several complications. CNS; central nervous system. PNS; peripheral
nervous system. CIPM; critical illness polyneuromyopathy. MP; meralgia paresthetica. ICU;

Figure 2 - Flow-chart of brain imaging performed during and after admission

Brain imaging overview of 61 prospectively enrolled COVID-19 patients from admission to 3
month after discharge, dichotomized into COVID-19-related scans referring to neuroimaging
related to a COVID-19 suspected complication or a complication related to a COVID-19
admission and neuroimaging performed for other reasons (e.g. traumatic injury) or for
disease that occurred before COVID-19 (e.g. cerebral hemorrhage with onset before COVID19). All images were re-evaluated by two board-certified neuroradiologists. # One patient
may be scanned multiple times with both CT and MRI and represented in both categorized
groups of scanned during and after admission. * See Figure 2 for images and case history. R;

50+-year-old patient was admitted with convulsive seizures and reduced consciousness
19 days after symptom onset with dry cough, fever, a sore throat, headache and myalgias.
Three weeks prior to presentation her entire family had experienced flu-like symptoms and
a family member was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Previous medical history included
hypertension, heterozygous Factor V Leiden mutation and chronic tension type headache.
Medication before admission included amlodipine and gabapentin. On the morning of
admission, the patient had generalized convulsive seizures. On examination, right-sided eye
deviation and aphasia were noted. Twenty-four hours after admission, owing to a sudden
decrease in consciousness and progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure, the patient was
intubated and transferred to the ICU. Chest X-ray revealed a complete white-out of the left
lung. Microscopic examination of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid revealed no
microorganisms, and the BAL fluid was negative with broad infectious workup, including
culture, tests for SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus type A and B, adenovirus, metapneumovirus,
A.

parainfluenza virus, atypical pneumonia, mycobacteria, pneumocystis, fungi and CMV,
except for a positive aspergillus galactomannan antigen. Cytologic examination of the lung
biopsy revealed type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and capillary inflammation with
macrophages and neutrophils. No hyaline membranes, granulomas, necrosis, fibrosis or
vasculitis were observed. There was no microscopic evidence of malignancy or fungi,
including immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for fungi. In the alveoli, there were small
precipitations of fibrin. The findings were concluded to be unspecific, resembling findings
observed in viral infection. Assays for antinuclear antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA and
rheumatoid factor were negative. Lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies were
negative. Electroencephalography revealed generalized slowing, with no epileptiform
activity and brain MRI demonstrated on axial T2W (A1) and FLAIR (A2) bilateral hyperintense
lesions in the right basal ganglia and left thalamus. Axial SWI images (A3) demonstrated
hemorrhage, seen as hypointense signal intensity in the right basal ganglia lesion and
ventricle system. Microbleeds were seen in the left thalamic lesion (A3) and ring
enhancement on the post contrast T1W images (A4). A lumbar puncture was performed.
Gram’s staining of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed no cells or organisms. The white-cell
count was 0 per microliter (reference range, <5), the red-cell count was 0 per microliter
(reference range, <300), the glucose level was 4.4 mmol per liter (2.2 to 3.9 mmol per liter)
and the protein level was 0.3 g per liter (reference value, 0.15 - 0.50). Cytologic examination
of the CSF revealed no malignant cells, and there was no evidence of B- of T-cell
lymphoproliferative disorder on flow cytometry. Polymerase-chain-reaction assays of the
CSF for herpes simplex virus and VZV were negative, as were mycobacterial smear and
culture of the CSF. Culture of the CSF showed no growth. Testing of the CSF for
autoantibodies, Lyme disease, syphilis, human herpes virus and SARS-CoV-2 were negative.
Whole-body positron-emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT), performed
after the administration of intravenous 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) tracer, revealed no
suspicion of extracranial malignant disease. The differential diagnosis consisted of cerebral
abscess or malignant tumor, and the patient was transferred to the neuro-ICU for further
evaluation and treatment. To obtain a neuropathological diagnosis, stereotactic biopsy of
the cerebral lesions was performed (A5-7). Biopsy specimens from both right and left
cerebral hemispheres showed thrombotic occlusion of small vessels by fibrin thrombi. The
brain parenchyma showed reactive changes with astrogliosis and microgliosis, axonal
swellings, proliferating capillaries and iron deposits (Perl’s stain) as sign of microbleeds.
There were a sparse diffuse lymphocytic infiltrate consisting of CD3 positive T- lymphocytes.
CD20 staining showed no B-lymphocytic infiltrates. There were no granulomas. There was
no sign of demyelinating disease when comparing neurofilament immunostaining with
myelin stains (LUXPAS and immunostaining for myelin basic protein). Immune staining’s for
Toxoplasma, Herpes 1, Cytomegalovirus and JC virus were all negative. There were no fungi
or bacteria in special staining’s with PAS, Gomori and Gram. Biopsy from the left cerebral
hemisphere (A5) with thrombi and reactive changes (PAS staining). Fibrin thrombus in a
small vessel (Masson trichrome staining) (A6). Higher magnification showing proliferating

capillaries, hemosiderin in macrophages and gliosis (hematoxylin and eosin stain), (A7).
Asterix: thrombus. The team of neuropathologists concluded the findings in the brain biopsy
tissue to be consistent with small necrotic lesions/infarctions, likely caused by fibrin thrombi
in the vessels. The clinical suspicion of COVID-19 was confirmed by a positive serum test for
SARS-CoV-2 showing high titers of neutralizing IgG-antibodies obtained on the 27th day of
illness. A diagnosis of COVID-19-associated acute necrotizing encephalitis was made based
on clinical signs, MRI, brain pathology findings and high titers of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and
exclusion of other causes following extensive diagnostic work-up.
A 20+-year-old patient with a previous medical history of hypothyroidism developed a dry
cough and myalgia in the beginning of March and was tested SARS-CoV-2 positive 3 days
later. COVID-19 symptoms lasted 6 days. Eight days after onset of COVID-19 symptoms, the
patient developed lumbar back pain and progressive numbness in both legs with a midthoracic sensory level. The patient further developed paresthesia in the right hand,
difficulties climbing stairs, and urinary retention with a sense of constant urge. Neurological
examination revealed a mild symmetric tetraparesis, hypoesthesia in both legs with a Th5
dermatome sensory level, impaired proprioception in the legs, absent abdominal reflexes
and a slightly broad-based gait. Cognitive evaluation and the rest of the exam were
unremarkable. Spinal MRI demonstrated on sagittal T1 STIR (B1) and sagittal T2 (B2)
hyperintense lesions from C1 to C7 and from Th1 to the conus medullaris, consistent with
transverse myelitis. Lumbar puncture showed a lymphocytic pleocytosis of 125 cells/microl,
protein levels of 0.59 g/L with a negative microbiological cerebrospinal fluid work-up
including herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, and
SARS-CoV-2. Blood was negative for HIV and syphilis. Screening for aquaporin-4 and myelin
oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies was negative. The patient was treated with highdose prednisone and plasma exchange and made an uneventful recovery. Eight months
later, the patient had a mild degree of Lhermitte’s but no other complaints.
B.

A 60+-year-old patient with a previous medical history of type 2 diabetes, hypothyroidism
and kidney transplant in 2019 due to adult onset polycystic kidney disease and
immunosuppression with ciclosporine, developed muscle ache, dry cough, fever and
dizziness resulting in a positive SARS-CoV-2 pharyngeal swab test and admission for 6 days.
Eleven days after COVID-19 symptom onset, the patient developed headache, progressive
confusion, apathy and speech difficulties and was re-admitted. Neurological examination
revealed the patient was apractic, apathetic and amnestic. She answered questions with
latency and with a mild, non-fluent aphasic speech. Brain MRI demonstrated on axial DWI
(C1) a hyperintense lesion in the right side of pons and on coronal FLAIR (C2) multiple suband juxta-cortical hyperintense lesions. Lumbar puncture showed a lymphocytic pleocytosis
of 252 cells (E6/L), protein levels of 1.77 g/L. CSF microscopy was unremarkable, and
cultures for bacteria and fungi were negative. CSF screening for E.coli., Hemophilus
influenzae, listeria, neisseria, streptococcus, enterovirus, Cryptococcus neoformans, syphilis

(both intrathecal and peripheral testing), Lyme’s disease, JC virus, 18S-RNA, flow cytometry,
and LGI1, NMDA, GABA-B, and CASPR2 antibody screening for autoimmune encephalitis
were all negative. HIV and hepatitis B testing, transesophageal echocardiography, whole
body FDG-PET for occult malignancy were also unremarkable. There were a positive PCR and
intrathecal antibody titer for EBV, HSV-1, VZV and human herpes virus but the attending
infectious disease and microbiology colleagues considered this to be consistent with a
reactive phenomenon owing to chronic immunosuppression. The patient was initially
treated for a few days with ceftriaxone and acyclovir, but treatment was stopped when no
clear evidence of bacterial or herpes virus encephalitis was found. The patient made a
gradual and spontaneous recovery, but cognitive impairment of memory and executive
function remained after discharge.
