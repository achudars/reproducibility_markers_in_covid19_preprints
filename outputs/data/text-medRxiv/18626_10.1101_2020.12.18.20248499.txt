Mental Disorder Prevalence in Coronavirus Pandemics

Abstract
Coronavirus pandemics are associated with a number of well-documented threats,
stressors and traumas that vary by impacted population and contribute to mental disorders.
Through a systematic review and meta-analysis of research on COVID-19, severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) pandemics, we
investigated whether mental disorder prevalence: (a) was elevated among populations impacted
by coronavirus pandemics (relative to unselected populations reported in the literature), and (b)
varied by disorder (undistinguished psychiatric morbidity, anxiety, depressive, posttraumatic
stress disorders [PTSD]) and impacted population (community, infected/recovered, healthcare
provider, quarantined). From 60 publications (N=66,190 participants), 725 individual estimates
were included in a series of multilevel meta-analyses/regressions including random effects to
account for estimates nested within studies. Across disorder and population, the median
summary point prevalence was 20% (95%CI=17-25%). Prevalence estimates were generally
substantially higher than reported by prior research for unselected samples. Psychiatric morbidity
and PTSD were most prevalent in most populations. The highest prevalence of each disorder was
found among infected/recovered adults. Notably high prevalence was found for (a) psychiatric
morbidity, PTSD and depression in infected/recovered adults (25-56%), (b) psychiatric
morbidity and PTSD in healthcare providers (21-29%), (c) depression and PTSD in the adults in
the community (15-19%), and (d) psychiatric morbidity in quarantined adults (28%). Sensitivity
analyses demonstrated that overall prevalence estimates were higher for studies/estimates: (1)
focused on SARS or MERS versus COVID-19, (2) conducted in Hong Kong or Korea versus
other locations, obtained (3) via questionnaire versus clinician assessment and (4) with standard
versus non-standard scoring, and (5) of moderate or very low versus low quality. The number of

Mental Disorder Prevalence Among Populations Impacted by Coronavirus Pandemics:
A Multilevel Meta-Analytic Study of COVID-19, MERS & SARS
Numerous studies document the often-substantial adverse mental health impact of
coronavirus pandemics (Brooks et al., 2020; Mak et al., 2009). With the onset of COVID-19,
useful information will be gained from a systematic review of this literature and quantitative
summary of prevalence of mental disorders that may be common to populations impacted by
coronaviruses. Through a systematic review and meta-analysis of COVID-19, severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) pandemic research
literatures, we addressed two questions. First, is mental disorder prevalence elevated among
populations impacted by coronavirus pandemics relative to unselected populations reported in
the literature? Second, does mental disorder prevalence vary by disorder (undistinguished
psychiatric morbidity, anxiety, depressive, posttraumatic stress disorders [PTSD]) and impacted
population (community, infected/recovered, healthcare provider, quarantined)?
Physical exposure to a virus (e.g., through job duties), media exposure, exposure to
illness and death, movement restrictions, interpersonal loss, and (for COVID-19) unemployment
and economic deprivation are key pandemic-related threats, stressors and traumas that are likely
to increase the risk of a mental disorder (Brooks et al., 2020; Dooley et al., 1994; Garfin et al.,
2020; Lai et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2012). Populations experiencing a greater frequency or intensity
of pandemic-related stressors are likely to be at greater risk of experiencing a mental disorder
(Galea et al., 2020). Among adults infected with a coronavirus, threats to health and mortality,
and disruption to routines (e.g., absence from work) will be pronounced and more impactful the
greater the severity of infection (Bienvenu et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2005). Functional impairment
and disability may further increase risk for mental disorders among recovered adults (Lam et al.,

2009; Lancee et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2019; Mak et al., 2009). Healthcare
providers, especially front-line treatment providers who contend with threats, stressors and
traumas such as repeated exposure to infected and dying people and morally ambiguous
decisions regarding who receives treatment (Lai et al., 2020; Lancee et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2012)
may be at increased risk of mental disorders. Quarantined adults may be at increased risk of
mental disorders due to threats to health, lack of social contact, and disruptions to routine
(Brooks et al., 2020). Anxiety and depressive disorders are likely to be common as any given
person may experience multiple threats and stressors that contribute to such disorders (Cisler et
al., 2010; Hammen, 2005). Infected/recovered adults and healthcare providers, in particular, may
experience traumatic events (e.g., invasive treatments, witnessing death) that increase risk of
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Lai et al., 2020; Mak et al., 2009).
Based on a systematic review of COVID-19, SARS, and MERS research, we conducted
multilevel meta-analyses/regressions to derive summary prevalence estimates for multiple
disorders (undistinguished psychiatric morbidity, anxiety, depressive, PTSD) in adult
populations (community [including students], infected/recovered, healthcare provider,
quarantined) that had been diagnosed using standardized instruments. We investigated whether
mental disorder prevalence was elevated among populations impacted by coronavirus pandemics
relative to unselected populations reported in the literature. For example, a meta-analysis of 157
studies from 59 countries (N ~660,000; Steel et al., 2014) found a 12-month prevalence of 15.4%
for combined mood (including bipolar) and anxiety (including PTSD) disorders. Twelve-month
(or less) prevalence has been found in epidemiological studies including unselected samples
representative of the adult populations of: (a) China (any disorder=9.3; anxiety disorder=5.0;
depressive disorder=3.6; PTSD=.2%; Huang et al., 2019), (b) Europe (anxiety disorder=6.4,

major depression=3.9; ESEMeD/MHEDEA 2000 Investigators, 2004), and (c) the United States
(anxiety disorder=7.3, major depressive episode=2.2; Regier et al., 1988). We hypothesized that,
relative to these estimates, all disorders would more prevalent in all populations (we
investigated) given the frequent and often impactful threats, stressors and traumas associated
with coronavirus pandemics. As the frequency and impact of particular threats, stressors and
traumas is likely to vary in type and by population, we further hypothesized that mental disorder
prevalence would vary by disorder and impacted population.
As individual studies often provided estimates of multiple disorders from the same
population, we utilized three-level meta-analytic models and included random effects to account
for estimates nested within studies. The use of multilevel models allowed us to include all
relevant prevalence estimates (e.g., by sex, age, income-level), thus further maximizing the
information provided by any given study. Following, our study provides information not found
in two published meta-analyses related to the aims of the current paper (de Pablo et al., 2020;
Rogers et al., 2020), which focused on single populations (healthcare providers, severely
infected/recovered).
Method
This study is part of a broader registered protocol (Boden, 2020), and was conducted
according to PRISMA (Moher et al., 2009) and MOOSE guidelines (Stroup et al, 2000).
Literature Search Strategy & Criteria
From April 15, 2020 until June 1, 2020, two study staff (MB, NC) conducted a key-word
search of electronic databases PubMED, PsychINFO, Scopus, Web of Science and Google
Scholar for peer-reviewed, English language publications. We searched for a broad set of studies
(Boden, 2020) by forming all combinations of key words (a) avian flu, coronavirus, COVID,

Ebola, equine flu, flu, H1N1, Influenza, MERS, quarantine, swine flu, SARS, respiratory,
crossed with (b) anxiety, depression, psychological distress, posttraumatic, emotional distress,
mental health. We examined reference lists of identified publications and lists of cited studies to
identify additional studies.
Study Sample
Studies meeting the following criteria were included in this meta-analysis: (1) available
in English language, (2) peer-reviewed (no grey literature or preprints), (3) reported source data
(no reviews), (4) focused on mental disorders (undifferentiated psychiatric morbidity, anxiety,
depression or PTSD) related to COVID-19, MERS, SARS, (5) included quantitative estimates of
mental disorder prevalence assessed by clinician diagnosis or measures with published
psychometric validation data, (6) included adult participants (age >=18). Electronic database
searches yielded a total of 3,930 publications that potentially met inclusion criteria. Screening of
titles and abstracts yielded 270 studies that were coded (including studies of non-coronavirus
outbreaks/epidemics coded as part of the broader project), with 60 studies meeting inclusion
criteria (see Figure 1).
Coding of Study and Effect Characteristics
Publications were first coded by one of four study authors (MB, NC, SM, JF), with the
majority coded by the first author. The first author developed the coding scheme and trained all
other study coders through didactics, iterative feedback on coding of a subset of studies, and
confirmation of codes by the first author. A subset of studies (144/270) were coded a second
time to ensure consistency of coding. Disagreements between primary and secondary codes were
resolved by the first author.
Coded study attributes include mental disorder prevalence in terms of: (a) sample size

and (b) size of sample positive for a disorder, (c) type of disorder (undistinguished psychiatric
morbidity, anxiety, depression, PTSD), (d) sample population (community [including university
students], infected/recovered, healthcare providers, quarantined), (e) pandemic (COVID-19,
SARS, MERS), (f) location (Canada, China, Hong Kong, Korea, Saudi Arabia, Singapore,
Taiwan), (g) timing (acute, within 1-year of main outbreak, more than 1-year after main
outbreak), and (h) measures (see Supplement A). Measures of psychiatric morbidity included
questionnaires assessing psychological/emotional distress and multiple types of psychopathology
(e.g., Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and clinician assessment of an unspecified mental
disorder.
We coded all relevant estimates provided in each study, including estimates for different
disorders and the same disorder assessed by different measures, at different time-points, or
among different populations and subpopulations (e.g., quarantined versus community, males
versus females, doctors versus nurses). Thus, we coded sociodemographic and socioeconomic
characteristics but did not include them in moderator analyses due to inconsistent reporting
across studies. We also coded study attributes not included in the reported analyses (i.e., means
and standard deviation for continuous measures of mental disorders/symptoms).
We manually calculated size of sample positive for a disorder when not reported by the
study. For questionnaire measures, we coded size of sample positive for a disorder consistent
with the study authors, who typically utilized established cutoffs reported in prior research.
Estimates obtained from non-standard cutoffs were identified for sensitivity analysis. When
severity thresholds (only) were provided (e.g., mild, moderate, severe), participants in moderate
or higher categories were coded as positive for a disorder unless otherwise specified in prior
research.

Study quality was assessed by the Systematic Assessment of Quality in Observation
Research (SAQOR) tool (Ross et al., 2011) with several changes to increase the applicability of
the system to our coding of prevalence (see Supplement B).
Computation of Effect Sizes and Data Analysis
Using the metafor (Viechtbauer, 2010) package in R, we conducted a series of mixedeffect multilevel meta-analyses/regressions. Our main analyses consisted of four metaanalyses/regressions, each of which included a random effect for studies and estimates within
studies. First, we conducted a meta-analysis to obtain an overall summary prevalence estimate
across disorders and populations. Second, we conducted a meta-regression including (dummycoded) disorder as a fixed effect moderator to obtain summary prevalence of each disorder
across populations. We conducted a third meta-regression including (dummy-coded) population
to obtain overall mental disorder prevalence in each population. The fourth meta-regression,
including dummy-coded disorder, population, and their product, provided summary estimates of
individual disorders in individual populations. Studies that utilized the same samples were
analyzed as a single study.
Models were implemented using restricted maximum-likelihood estimation. Study
prevalence estimates (i.e., sample size with disorder divided by total sample size) and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) were Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformed (Freeman et al.,
1950) for improved statistical properties. Fixed effects and CI were back-transformed (Miller,
1978) to provide summary prevalence estimates. The I2 statistic measured percentage of
heterogeneity due to true between-study and between-estimate differences, and the interclass
correlation coefficient (ICC), the association between underlying estimates. Profile plots
indicated whether all variance components were statistically identifiable.

Mental Disorder Prevalence in Coronavirus Pandemics

As part of sensitivity/quality analyses, we re-conducted our four main analyses using a
cluster-robust estimator of standard errors (similar to the Eicker-Huber-White method) useful
when multiple, dependent outcomes come from individual studies (Hedges et al., 2010).
Additionally, in a series of meta-regressions, we examined whether the overall summary effect
varied by: (1) pandemic, (2) location, (3) timing, (4) measure (self-report questionnaire versus
clinician assessment), (5) scoring (non-standard/unknown versus standard scoring of measure),
and (6) study quality (very low, low, moderate). Analysis of publication bias was not conducted
as most studies did not use inferential statistics to test hypotheses regarding prevalence, and thus,
were not more likely to be published because of statistically significant results.
Results
From 60 publications (of which six studies/three-pairs utilized the same or partially
overlapping samples) including 66,190 participants, 725 individual estimates were obtained. In
main analyses, approximately 99% of variance between- and within-studies was due to true
variation rather than sampling error. As expected, between-study heterogeneity was larger
(Range I2 = 72.1-73.3%) than within-study heterogeneity (Range I2 = 25.3-26.8%). ICC ranged
from .73 to .74, indicating a strong association between estimates within studies. Models with
random effects fit significantly better than respective models without (all p<.001). Profile plots
indicated all variance components were statistically identifiable. Summary estimates for
individual disorders/populations were based on varying numbers of studies, individual effects
and participants (see Table 1). CI were large for summary estimates derived from few
studies/estimates (e.g., quarantined), thus indicating greater imprecision.
The median summary point prevalence for mental disorders across disorders and
populations was 20% (95%CI=17-25%). Prevalence estimates of 20% or higher were found for

11 (44%) disorders/populations with a high of 56% for psychiatric morbidity among
infected/recovered adults (see Table 1). Occurring in 32% (95%CI=27-37%) of the overall
sample, psychiatric morbidity had the highest prevalence across all populations, and in each
population other than depression in community adults (see Figure 1). Across all populations,
PTSD had the second highest prevalence (21%, 95%CI=17-25%), followed by depression (17%,
95%CI=14-22%) and anxiety (12%, 95%CI=8-15%).
Across disorders, the highest prevalence was found for infected/recovered adults (30%,
95%CI=21-40%), followed by healthcare providers (20%, 95%CI=15-26%), community adults
(16%, 95%CI=11-23%), and quarantined adults (12%, 95%CI=4-22%). The highest prevalence
of each disorder was found for infected/recovered adults, with 25-56% positive for depression,
PTSD or psychiatric morbidity. Healthcare providers had high psychiatric morbidity prevalence
(29%, 95%CI=23-36%) and PTSD (21%, 95%CI=16-27%) relative to other disorders. Adults in
the community had high prevalence of depression (19%, 95%CI=12-26%) and PTSD (15%,
95%CI=9-23%) relative to other disorders. Quarantined adults had much higher prevalence of
psychiatric morbidity (28%, 95%CI=5-59%) versus other disorders, but summary prevalence
based on few studies/individual estimates were imprecisely estimated.
In sensitivity analyses, use of the robust estimator resulted in wider confidence intervals
on average for summary estimates (Mean Difference=.03, Range= -.62 to .18) and backtransformed point prevalence estimates (Mean Difference=2%, Range= -54% to 13%; see Figure
2 and Supplement C). Most studies (a) focused on SARS, (b) were conducted in China and
(separately) Hong Kong, included estimates (c) measured during the acute phase and obtained
(d) via questionnaire and (e) with standard scoring, and (f) were of low or very low quality (see
Table 2). The overall prevalence estimates across disorders and populations were higher for

studies/estimates (1) focused on SARS or MERS versus COVID-19 (22/23% vs. 13%), (2)
conducted in Hong Kong or Korea versus other locations (26/24% vs. 4-18%), obtained (3) via
questionnaire versus clinician assessment (20% vs. 12%) and (4) with standard versus nonstandard scoring (21% vs. 18%), and (6) of moderate or very low versus low quality (22/22% vs.
18%).
Discussion
Across 60 individual studies, one in five adults in populations impacted by a coronavirus
pandemic were demonstrated to or reported signs or symptoms indicative of a mental disorder
diagnosis. Our summary estimates were higher, often substantially than those found in a metaanalysis of 157 studies from 59 countries (Steel et al., 2014) and in epidemiological studies of
the adult populations of China (Huang et al., 2019), Europe (ESEMeD/MHEDEA 2000
Investigators, 2004), and the United States (Regier et al., 1988). Undifferentiated psychiatric
morbidity, the most prevalent disorder in most of our study populations, had a much higher
prevalence than in the prior studies referenced above, as did anxiety and depressive disorders in
all but quarantined populations. PTSD, the second most prevalent disorder in all study
populations, had a much higher prevalence than reported for unselected Chinese adults (Huang et
al., 2019), and was comparable to lifetime prevalence of PTSD among combat veterans (Weiss et
al., 1992). Our results further demonstrate that coronavirus pandemics are associated with a
substantial adverse mental health impact as manifested by elevated rates of multiple mental
disorders in several populations. Our search strategy and analytical methods allowed us to utilize
all relevant data from individual studies, while accounting for dependencies in those data.
Furthermore, our focus on peer-reviewed studies utilizing standardized measures strengthens our
confidence in the validity of our results.

Mental Disorder Prevalence in Coronavirus Pandemics

Infected or recovered adults had the highest prevalence of all disorders and each
individual disorder, with notably higher prevalence relative to unselected adults in prior studies
(ESEMeD/MHEDEA 2000 Investigators, 2004; Huang et al., 2019; Regier et al., 1988).
Prevalence of PTSD was quite high (28%) and consistent with research finding PTSD is
common among mechanically ventilated and intensive care unit patients (Bienvenu et al., 2018;
Griffiths et al., 2007). Severe infection appears to be a potent risk factor for mental disorders,
and may contribute to functional impairment and disability that continues to adversely impact the
mental health of recovered patients (Mak et al., 2009). Even minor infections may be quite
threatening and stressful in people with pre-existing physical or mental health conditions.
Nuanced investigations of links between mental disorders and infection severity, symptom
presentation and medical treatments, and facets of (dys)function post recovery will be useful for
mental health intervention planning. Immediate research of this type is needed for COVID-19.
Demonstrating the substantial threat, stress and trauma faced by healthcare providers
during a coronavirus pandemic, high mental disorder prevalence was found among healthcare
providers relative to unselected populations in prior studies (ESEMeD/MHEDEA 2000
Investigators, 2004; Huang et al., 2019; Regier et al., 1988). Notably high PTSD prevalence may
reflect exposure to numerous potentially traumatic events (e.g., suffering and death of patients,
morally ambiguous decisions and moral injury). Job stresses (e.g., long and inflexible hours,
fluid work environments and job duties) may contribute to high prevalence of depression, along
with burnout.
Even adults in the community had elevated prevalence of mental disorders relative to
unselected populations in prior studies. The high prevalence of depression, in particular, might
reflect the stress of living and coping with the threat of infection, societal dysfunction, and/or

limited availability of routines and resources. Countries that continue to be impacted by COVID19 are likely to experience increased incidence of depression in the general population over time.
Findings of lower prevalence of most disorders among quarantined populations must be
interpreted cautiously given the small number of studies/estimates from which these summary
estimates were derived (e.g., 58 [83%] of individual estimates came from one of the five studies
providing estimates for quarantined adults).
Several issues should be considered when interpreting these results. First, as indicated by
large CI, some studies produced imprecise summary prevalence estimates, likely due to small
sample sizes. Second, most studies were of low or very low quality. Summary estimates varied
somewhat by study quality, though summary estimates were identical for moderate and very low
quality studies. Third, the true prevalence of diagnosable mental disorders in populations
impacted by coronavirus epidemics is likely to be lower than the magnitude of summary
estimates, derived mostly from studies using self-report questionnaires that do not precisely
assess mental disorder diagnostic criteria. Only a subset of included studies utilized goldstandard clinical interviews (e.g., Structured Clinical Interview for DSM) and assessment
instruments specifically designed to screen for mental disorders (e.g., Kessler et al., 2002).
Indeed, sensitivity analyses revealed higher overall summary prevalence obtained from
questionnaires versus clinician assessment. Somewhat mitigating this concern: (a) almost all
studies utilizing questionnaires implemented empirically validated cutoffs to identify participants
with mental disorders (e.g., Plummer et al., 2016); and (b) studies that did not implement
standard questionnaire cutoffs (and those that utilized unknown scoring algorithms to identify

Mental Disorder Prevalence in Coronavirus Pandemics

estimates must be interpreted cautiously. Overall prevalence of all disorders across all
populations was lower for COVID-19 versus MERS and SARS. All COVID-19 studies focused
on mental disorder prevalence during the acute phase of the pandemic, whereas MERS and
SARS studies included acute and longer time-frames. Yet, the overall mental disorder prevalence
varied little between acute and longer time-frames. It will be important to investigate whether
mental disorder prevalence increases in countries with prolonged periods of SARS-CoV-2
infection and economic hardship (e.g., United States, Brazil). We hypothesize that such
countries, and areas within these countries may experience increased rates of the disorders
examined in this study, in addition to disorders of despair (e.g., alcohol dependence; Petterson et
al., 2020) and related to disease threat (e.g., illness anxiety disorder, somatic symptom disorder).
Regardless, the raw number of mental disorders attributable to COVID-19 will be substantial and
magnitudes higher than attributable to MERS and SARS due to the vast scope and ongoing
nature of the pandemic.
Preliminary evidence suggests that COVID-19 exacerbates existing inequalities that harm
racial/ethnic minorities, economically disadvantaged people, people with ‘essential’ job types,
etc. (Hooper et al., 2020; van Dorn et al., 2020). Additional research is needed to quantify the
mental health impact of COVID-19 in these subpopulations, and to document disparities in
assessment and treatment of COVID-19-related mental disorders. Future research that examines
the potentially manifold pathways to individual outcomes among subpopulations most at-risk
will be instrumental in intervening in a cost-effective, effective and equitable manner. Future
research that utilizes rigorous and validated subject recruitment and mental disorder assessment
methods can improve upon the low quality of the majority of studies included in our study.
Additional limitations can be addressed through assessment of pre-existing mental disorders

among study samples, rigorous assessment of time-periods at risk, and/or inclusion of control
conditions (e.g., people exposed to but not infected by COVID-19 as a comparator for
infected/recovered people). Studies that do so will more directly measure the impact of COVID19-related threats, stressors and traumas on mental disorder prevalence, incidence, and rate
ratios, which will be essential to intervention planning and implementation.
Our study provides data useful for understanding and potentially, intervening to alleviate
the mental health impact of COVID-19 and future coronavirus (and other) pandemics. A datadriven approach will facilitate resource allocation to provide effective (and cost-effective) mental
health interventions for people with the greatest need during and following a coronavirus
pandemic. For example, the high prevalence of PTSD among infected/recovered people indicates
a need for effective evidence-based treatments for PTSD as part of convalescence (e.g.,
prolonged exposure for PTSD; Powers et al., 2010), and providers trained to administer these
interventions. A data-drive approach to resource allocation will be especially useful to countries,
states/provinces and healthcare systems for which treatment need is expected to exceed existing
mental health resources.
