Abstract:
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While molecular assays are used to detect
viral genetic material for the diagnosis of acute infection, reliable serological assays are needed
to measure immunity against SARS-CoV-2. In this report, we describe an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that detects antibodies against the following SARS-CoV-2
recombinant proteins: the full-length spike (S) protein and the receptor-binding domain (RBD).
Our assay is sensitive and specific for immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgA and IgM anti-S protein and
anti-RBD antibodies. Samples were pre-treated with Triton X-100 to inactivate potential virus
without affecting antibody detection. Our in-house ELISA performed as well as the commercial
EUROIMMUN and Ortho assays for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. This method provides a
high-throughput assay that does not require specialized instrumentation and can be widely used
to determine immunity and the dynamic range of antibodies found within SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction:
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. Containment of the virus has been challenged by
asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 [2]. Approximately 20% of
symptomatic infections are severe and disproportionately impact the elderly population and
patients with underlying health conditions [3, 4]. Symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection typically
appear 2-14 days after viral exposure; however, asymptomatic carriers can transmit the virus [5].
It is estimated that up to 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild or asymptomatic disease and
asymptomatic transmissions account for half of all COVID-19 cases [6-8]. Thus, serology is
essential to capture actual infection rates as it captures both asymptomatic and symptomatic
infections.

The laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 is made using real-time reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of viral mRNA using nasal or throat swabs [912]. In the 4 days before the typical time of symptom onset, the probability of a false-negative
result by RT-PCR decreases from 100% to 67% [13]. Viral RNA is detectable as early as the first
day of symptoms and peaks within the first week of symptom onset [10]. RT-PCR positivity
starts to decline by week 3 and subsequently becomes undetectable; however, PCR positivity
may persist beyond three weeks in severely ill and hospitalized patients when most cases would
yield a negative result [14]. Positive results reflect only the detection of viral RNA and do not
necessarily indicate presence of viable virus, leading the assay to have a modest sensitivity
(approximately 79%) and high specificity (approximately 100%) [9, 15, 16]. False-negative
results can also be attributed to improper sample collection and timing of test [15, 17]. Accurate

testing for SARS-CoV-2, followed by appropriate preventive measures, is paramount in the
health care setting to prevent both nosocomial and community transmission. Currently, there is a
need for tests that are capable of detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies with
high accuracy to determine seroprevalence [18]. Although serology cannot distinguish between
acute and chronic infection, it can identify individuals who have developed an immune response,
aid in contact tracing, help identify suitable convalescent plasma donors, and can be used to
evaluate vaccines.

The presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 indicates the potential of protective
immunity [19]. The target antigen of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is a large
glycoprotein termed spike (S) protein, which consists of the S1 and S2 domains. The S1 domain
contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is the target of most neutralizing antibodies
[20-23]. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a homotrimer essential for mediating binding to host
cells through interactions with the human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [2022]. Binding of the RBD to the host ACE2 receptor triggers a conformational change in the S
protein that subsequently initiates membrane fusion events with the host cell [24]. Although
antibodies may be generated against multiple domains within the S protein, most neutralizing
antibodies bind to the RBD [23, 25].

Antibody kinetics studies have reported that virus-specific IgG levels are lower in people
who are asymptomatic or had a mild infection compared with people who had more severe
symptoms and acute illness [26]. In this report, we describe a high-throughput ELISA assay with
a high sensitivity and specificity for anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies.

Methods and Materials:
Patient Samples
Serum samples were collected from convalescent patients who had been confirmed to be
symptomatic COVID-19 infection by RT-PCR (n=10, COVID-19-positive), COVID-19-negative
individuals who tested negative by RT-PCR during the pandemic (n=4) and controls collected
before November 2019 (pre-COVID controls, n=332). This study was approved by the Hamilton
Integrated Research Ethics Board (HIREB) and informed written consent was obtained from all
participants.

Production of S protein and RBD
A detailed protocol outlining protein production can be found in a study by Stadlbauer et al [27].
Plasmids encoding mammalian cell codon optimized sequences for SARS-CoV-2 full-length S
protein and the RBD were generously gifted from the lab of Dr. Florian Krammer (Ichan School
of Medicine at Mount Sinai, NY, NY, USA). In brief, proteins were produced in Expi293 cells
(ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) using the manufacturer’s instructions. Post-transfection,
when culture viability dropped to 40%, supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 500 x g
for 5 minutes to remove cell debris. The supernatant was then incubated with shaking overnight
at 4C with 1 mL of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose resin (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) per 25 mL of transfected cell supernatant. The following day 10 mL polypropylene
gravity flow columns (Qiagen) were used to elute the protein. RBD and S proteins were
concentrated in Amicon centrifugal units (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA), 10 kDa and 50 kDa

respectively, prior to being resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The purified
proteins were analyzed via SDS-PAGE.

SARS-CoV-2 ELISA development
384 well plates (Nunc Maxisorp, Rochester, NY, USA) were coated overnight at 4ºC with 25
L/well of RBD (2 g/mL) or S protein (5 g/mL) suspended in 50 mM carbonate-bicarbonate
buffer (pH 9.6). The plates were then blocked with 100 µL/well of 3% skim milk prepared in
PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 at room temperature for 2 hours. The blocking solution was removed,
and diluted patient serum samples (1/100 prepared in 1% skim milk in PBS/0.05% Tween 20)
was added to the plates for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were washed twice with
PBS/0.05% Tween 20 and thrice with PBS. Bound human antibodies (IgG, IgA, or IgM) were
detected with alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-human IgG (-chain-specific, 1/2000,
Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc, Westgrove, PA, USA), goat anti-human IgA (chain-specific; 1/500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc, Westgrove, PA, USA)
antibody, or goat anti-human IgM (-chain-specific; 1/1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories, Inc, Westgrove, PA, USA) antibody prepared in PBS/0.05% Tween 20. Plates were
washed as before and followed with the addition of 50 µL substrate (4-nitrophenylphosphate
disodium salt hexahydrate in diethanolamine; MilliporeSigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The optical
density at 405 nm and 490 nm (as a reference) was measured using a BioTek 800TS microplate
reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). The cut-off was determined as the mean plus 2 standard
deviations (SD) of the pre-COVID-19 control population. The specificities for each
antigen/antibody combination were determined using the pre-COVID controls (n=332).

Measuring inter-assay variability and repeatability
To determine inter-assay reproducibility, pre-COVID-19 controls (n=4) and COVID-19 positive
(n=4) patient serum samples were tested in at least four separate assays using the SARS-CoV-2
ELISA described above. Results were reported as an optical density (405 nm with reference 490
nm) for each antigen and antibody isotype (IgG, IgA and IgM). Values are represented as a ratio
of observed optical density to the determined assay cut-off optical density. Values above 1 ratio
is considered positive in the SARS-CoV-2 ELISA.

Evaluation of viral inactivation treatments on antibody testing in ELISA
Patient serum was inactivated to eliminate residual virus in serum samples. A subset of
recovered COVID-19 positive (n=10) and pre-COVID-19 controls (n=5) were used to compare
two viral inactivation methods in human sera: heat-treatment and treatment with the detergent
Triton X-100 [28-30]. For heat-treatment, patient sera (0.5 mL) were incubated with rotational
shaking at 56°C for 30 minutes and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 14,000 x g, after which the
supernatant was collected [29]. In parallel, duplicate samples were mixed with Triton X-100 to a
final concentration of 1% (v/v) [30]. The non-treated and treated patient samples were tested in
the SARS-CoV-2 ELISA as previously described. We however did not test whether any virus
was actually present in serum samples and whether the inactivation method was effective against
virus.

Inhibition of IgG anti-RBD binding
To confirm the specificity of antibodies detected by the ELISA, we inhibited the binding of
selected serum samples with excess fluid-phase RBD. One antibody-positive pre-COVID-19

control and COVID-19 positive (n=10) patient serum samples were tested in the SARS-CoV-2
ELISA described above. Samples diluted to a working concentration (1/100) were incubated
with 10 times molar excess of RBD or the equivalent volume of PBS for 1 hour at room
temperature before testing for antibodies in the standard assay as described.

Comparing the in-house SARS-CoV-2 ELISA to commercially available assays
A subset of COVID-19 positive patient samples (n=9) and COVID-19 negative patient samples
(n=5) was tested in the commercially available EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA that
measures anti-S1 IgG and IgA and the results were compared to our in-house assay. The same
set of COVID-19 positive and pre-COVID-19 controls was also tested by the Hamilton Regional
Laboratory Medicine Program (HRLMP) in the Ortho Clinical Diagnostics COVID-19 IgG
Antibody Test that measures anti-S protein IgG for comparison.

Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the IgG, IgA, and IgM binding to S protein and
RBD as measured by mean optical density across antigen replicates. Binomial 95% confidence
intervals (CI) were calculated for all specificity determination. All statistical analyses were
conducted using GraphPad Prism (version 7.0a, GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA).

(n=306) with ages ranging between 21 and 79 years at time of collection. COVID-19 positive
patient samples were collected between 23- and 89-days post-symptoms. COVID-19 negative
patient samples were collected between 24- and 162-days post-symptoms.

ELISA development
We used a set of pre-COVID-19 controls and recovered COVID-19 positive patient samples to
establish an ELISA with full-length S protein and RBD. The pre-COVID-19 controls (n=332)
were used to establish the background reactivity to the S protein and RBD for IgG, IgA, and IgM
antibodies, separately. The COVID-19 positive patients (n=14) were used to determine the
reactivity of the ELISA to the full-length S protein and RBD. Antigen concentration of S protein
and RBD and serum dilutions were optimized by testing COVID-19-positive and pre-COVD19
samples. We found that RBD at 2 g/mL (Figure 1A) and S protein at 5 g/mL (Figure 1B) were
the optimal concentrations since these concentrations yielded the greatest separation between OD
values of COVID-19 positive and pre-COVID-19 controls results (Figure 1). Saturation occurred
at higher concentrations of each antigen. Using the same set of pre-COVID-19 controls and
COVID-19 positive serum samples, we determined that 1/100 was the optimal serum dilution in
1% skim milk as it provided the best separation between negative and positive results (data not
shown).

All recovered COVID-19 positive serum samples reacted strongly to both full-length S protein
and RBD while reactivity of the pre-COVID-19 controls yielded lower levels of reactivity in
most cases (below mean OD + 2SD cut-off). Reactivity of COVID-19 positive serum samples
was stronger against the full-length S protein than against RBD.

Determining a cut-off for the SARS-CoV-2 ELISA
We used pre-COVID-19 controls (n=332) to determine the background reactivity and establish
assay specificity to the S protein and RBD using samples from individuals drawn before the
beginning of the pandemic. The cut-off was determined as the mean + 2SD of the OD readings in
the pre-COVID-19 control population. We tested these samples using the optimized SARS-CoV2 protocol. We found that most pre-COVID-19 controls had only background reactivity for both
the full-length S protein and RBD (specificity for IgG = 96.7% and 97.0%, respectively). Each
antigen and antibody isotype had a few pre-COVID-19 controls that tested positive for the
antibodies based on the determined cut-off. We found that specificity was the lowest for IgM
against both S protein and RBD, 94.6% (18 testing positive) and 95.5% (15 testing positive)
respectively. S protein- and RBD-specific IgA had the highest measured specificity, 97.3% (9
testing positive) and 97.6% (8 testing positive), respectively (Figure 2).

Determining inter-assay variability
A subset of COVID-19 positive patient samples (n=4) and pre-COVID-19 controls (n=4) were
tested at least 4 times independently to determine reproducibility of the optimized SARS-CoV-2
ELISA. Upon repeat testing, we found that there was minimal inter-assay variability with repeat
testing in anti-RBD IgG on average, results deviated by 4.863.53% in COVID-19 positive and
7.143.03% in pre-COVID-19 controls (Figure 4). This trend was similar for anti-RBD IgA
(7.603.75% COVID-19 positive; 5.193.02% pre-COVID-19 controls) and IgM (4.212.64%
COVID-19 positive; 8.584.63% pre-COVID-19 controls) and anti-S protein IgG (6.165.70%

positive; 12.834.17% pre-COVID-19 controls), and IgM (6.082.68% COVID-19 positive;
12.374.18% pre-COVID-19 controls).

Comparing methods for viral inactivation on reactivity of antibodies
We used a panel of COVID-19 positive (n=10) serum samples and pre-COVID-19 controls (n=5)
to determine whether heat-inactivation or adding Triton X-100 to the samples would affect antiRBD or anti-S protein detection. These conditions are commonly used to inactivate virus that
may be present in serum prior to downstream serological assays.
The IgG signals were decreased in 12 of 15 samples (66.7%) by an average 13.546.73% after
heat-treatment, but none of these samples decreased below the cut-off. Signals for IgA against
RBD and S protein decreased in 12 of 15 samples (80.0%) by an average 13.859.55% after
heat-treatment. With heat treatment, for IgM anti-RBD (Figure 3A) and IgM anti-S protein
(Figure 3B) from COVID-19 positive patients and pre-COVID-19 controls, there was a reduction
in OD by an average 21.08.06% after heat-treatment. Four of 10 COVID-19 positive samples
IgM ODs decreased below the assay cut-off after heat-treatment.
IgG signals in anti-RBD and anti-S protein were decreased in 14 of 15 samples by an average
level of 8.037.59% after treatment with Triton X-100. ODs for IgA against RBD and S protein
decreased in 7 of 15 samples by an average 4.143.38% and increased in the 8 other samples by
an average level of 6.744.01% after treatment with Triton X-100. With Triton X-100 treatment,
IgM anti-RBD (Figure 3A) and IgM anti-S protein had an average increase in OD by 6.45.64%
in 11 of 15 samples and OD decreased by 3.112.68% in 4 of 15 samples. Treatment with Triton
X-100 had minimal effect on the reactivity of the samples. None of the COVID-19 positive
samples tested with Triton X-100 treatment decreased below the cut-off after treatment. None of

the measured pre-COVID-19 controls became higher than the assay cut-off value after heatinactivation or treatment with Triton X-100.

Inhibition of IgG anti-RBD binding
To ensure the detectability of antibody binding in the sera is specific to the antigen and not nonspecific binding, the reactivity of COVID-19 positive patient samples (n=10) and 1 antibodypositive sample from pre-COVID-19 controls for anti-RBD IgG was inhibited using excess RBD
in solution. All COVID-19 positive patient anti-RBD binding was inhibited on average
78.7310.12% using excess RBD (Figure 5). One pre-COVID-19 control who tested positive for
an anti-RBD IgG was also inhibited to a similar degree (80.51%) as COVID-19 positive samples
with excess RBD in solution.

Validation of the SARS-CoV-2 ELISA
We tested a subset of COVID-19 positive (n=9) and negative (n= 5) patient samples in the
commercially available EUROIMMUN and the Ortho Clinical Diagnostics assays and compared
the results to our in-house ELISA. The EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA measures IgG
or IgA antibodies to the S1 protein. The Ortho Clinical Diagnostics COVID-19 IgG Antibody
Test measures IgG antibodies to the S protein. We found that the in-house SARS-CoV-2 ELISA
agreed with the Ortho assay performed by the clinical laboratory (HLRMP), in 14/14 samples
(Table 2) for IgG antibodies to the S protein. In one COVID-negative patient sample, the inhouse assay detected weak IgG anti-RBD antibodies only, and no other reactivity, which
correlated with the Ortho test. The EUROIMMUN assay detected SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in

two COVID-19 positive patient samples where the in-house ELISA and Ortho assay did not, one
of which was borderline positive for IgG anti-S1.

Discussion:
COVID-19 can be a severe infectious disease, however, many patients will have few or no
symptoms [31]. Molecular assays to detect the viral genetic material are available for the
diagnosis of acute infection, there is a need for accurate serological assays suitable to specifically
detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies [11, 12]. In this study, we describe a high throughput,
reproducible, semi-quantitative serological method to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
This assay measures IgG, IgA and IgM antibody-reactivity to the immunogenic S protein and the
RBD of the virus. Early serological assessments have revealed some details concerning the
antibody responses to COVID-19. Following exposure, patients have an increase in IgG, IgA and
IgM with peak IgA and IgM levels at 7-20 days post-infection, followed by IgG [19, 32].
Therefore, by measuring IgG, IgA, and IgM isotypes, we are capturing antibodies elicited at all
stages of the immune response and are less likely to encounter false negatives. Furthermore, our
in-house ELISA is simple, rapid, does not require specialized instrumentation and can be
performed in standard diagnostic laboratories. Reproducibility is one of the factors to consider
when establishing an assay. Using a subset of patient samples, we show that after 4 repeated
measurements, there is minimal inter-assay variability.
Current COVID-19 antibody tests have shown significant variability [33-35]. Specificity
is affected by various factors, including the type of test and the antigen(s). Our assay used the
full-length S protein and RBD; however, some groups have tested for antibodies against the
nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 as well as testing different antibody isotypes (Ortho and

EUROIMMUN assays) [36, 37]. Cross-reactivity of antibodies with multiple coronaviruses is an
important consideration in developing the SARS-CoV-2 ELISA [38]. Similar to our results,
commercial kits of SARS-CoV-2 ELISAs have identified cross-reactivity to presumably seasonal
coronaviruses with IgA antibodies having a lower specificity than tests for IgG antibodies [33,
39, 40]. This may affect test specificity as individuals previously infected with seasonal
coronaviruses can appear as positives in certain COVID-19 serological tests [41, 42]. In addition,
other host factors, including rheumatoid factor and heterophile antibodies, can potentially crossreact and generate false-positive SARS-CoV-2 serology results [43, 44]. These factors may
explain why we found 19 pre-COVID-19 controls who tested positive in the SARS-CoV-2
antibody tests. The pre-COVID-19 controls that had anti-RBD antibody were not false positive
per se because antibody binding could be inhibited by excess RBD. The most likely explanation
for this is that these are cross-reactive antibodies generated to seasonal coronaviruses.
Test specificity is also dependent on the assay cut-off based on the control population
tested. We used a biobank containing pre-COVID-19 controls (n=332) and have used these to
determine the cut-off of the SARS-CoV-2 ELISA to identify individuals with IgG, IgA and IgM
antibodies against RBD or S protein. The optimized ELISA described has a specificity of greater
than 94% depending on the antigen and antibody class measured (Table 1). Since our preCOVID-19 controls include healthy individuals (n=26) and patients suspected of ITP or HIT
(n=306), the specificity may not be representative of the general population, but include
important hospitalized and elderly patients, potentially exposed to other seasonal coronaviruses.
In addition, our in-house ELISA is also in agreement with two commercial assays that report
sensitivity and specificity to be 100% and 90%, respectively; however, in some studies testing

different populations, sensitivity and specificity of the commercial assays can be as low as 65%
and 73.8%, respectively [45, 46].
To date, there have been a number of methods used for virus inactivation. However, how
these inactivation methods affect the sensitivity of serological assays is unknown. To reduce risk
of exposure to the virus during testing, viral inactivation is recommended before sample
handling. We found that with heat-inactivation, detection of serum IgG and IgM was diminished,
similar to previous studies [47]. In contrast, Triton X-100 had minimal effect on the antibody
reactivity, suggesting that Triton X-100 would be a superior method for virus inactivation as it
does not reduce antibody binding in IgM. The decrease in antibody levels may be related to the
structural change with denaturation and aggregation when samples are heated [48, 49]. Previous
studies have shown that antibodies can lose their antigen binding ability after heating, and IgM is
less thermally stable than IgG due to the structure of its heavy chains [50]. Our results indicate
that between the two methods, using Triton X-100 for virus inactivation is less likely to affect
antibody reactivity.
We describe a high throughput ELISA that detects anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
important for identifying COVID-19. This SARS-CoV-2 ELISA described is sensitive, specific
and reproducible allowing it to be useful for the investigations of changing infection rates and
longitudinal immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. It will be useful to determine antibody titer as it
may play a role in determining antibody response with great accuracy and describe disease
severity. This will complement RT-PCR tests and help provide evidence of recent infection. The
assay could be used to identify antibody responses in patients recovering from COVID-19
disease for convalescent plasma studies and to screen health care workers to allow for selective
deployment of personnel to care for different COVID-19 populations. This assay can be used to

individuals to determine the duration of COVID-19 antibody-mediated immunity.
