Objective: To assess the effectiveness of multimodal infection control interventions in the

34

prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infections in healthcare professionals

35
36

Design: Sequential follow-up study

37
38

Setting: Largest tertiary care centre in northern Germany

39
40

Participants: 1253 employees of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf were

41

sequentially assessed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies at the beginning of the

42

covid-19 epidemic (20 March – 9 April), one month (20 April – 8 May), and another two

43

months later (22 June – 24 July). Of those, 1026 were healthcare workers (HCWs) of whom

44

292 were directly involved in the care of covid-19 patients. During the study period, infection

45

control interventions were deployed, those included i) strict barrier nursing of all known

46

covid-19 patients including FFP2 (N95) masks, goggles, gloves, hoods and protective gowns,

47

ii) visitor restrictions with access control at all hospital entries, iii) mandatory wearing of

48

disposable face masks in all clinical settings, and iv) universal RT-PCR admission screening of

49

patients.

50
51

Main Outcome Measures: SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion rate

52
53

Results: At the initial screening, ten participants displayed significant IgG antibody ratios.

54

Another ten individuals showed seroconversion at the second time point one month later,

55

only two further participants seroconverted during the subsequent two months. The overall

56

SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in the study cohort at the last follow-up was 1.8%, the

57

seroconversion rate dropped from 0.81% to 0.08% per month despite a longer observation

58

period. Amongst HCWs seropositivity was increased in those directly involved in the care of

59

patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections (3.8%, n=11) compared to other HCWs (1.4%, n=10,

60

P=0.025). However, after the adoption of all multimodal infection control interventions

61

seroconversions were observed in only two more HCWs, neither of whom were involved in

62

inpatient care.

INTRODUCTION

97

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at the front line of the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19)

98

pandemic response and disproportionally at risk of contracting severe acute respiratory

99

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) due to occupational exposure.1

2

The Chinese

100

ophthalmologist Li Wenliang, who was one of the first physicians to issue emergency warnings

101

about a novel viral pneumonia that was later identified as covid-19 died after being infected

102

when caring for a pre-symptomatic patient. 3 This individual case as well as larger case series

103

illustrate the considerable challenges of HCW protection, especially since the risk of infections

104

from pre- or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals was initially often

105

underestimated.4 5 Protection of HCWs from infection requires not only strict application of

106

personal protective equipment (PPE), but also the prompt identification of infected

107

individuals, who may be asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic. Protection of HCWs not only

108

serves as personal protection but is also paramount to mitigate nosocomial transmission to

109

vulnerable patients and fellow HCWs. HCW infections may also lead to critical staff shortages.

110

Various infection prevention and control interventions have been adapted worldwide with

111

various efficacies, including the use of adequate PPE

112

patients 9 10, and RT-PCR surveillance of exposed HCWs.11 12 However, reports about limited

113

availability of sufficient PPE and high infection rates in HCWs, particularly during the early

114

phase of the outbreak, have raised concerns about whether HCWs can be adequately

115

protected from contracting occupational infections.13

116

recently reported that HCWs account for over 10% of overall global covid-19 cases.15 While

117

strict adherence to adequate PPE in areas caring for covid-19 patients is of major importance,

118

this alone may be insufficient in protecting HCWs and in preventing nosocomial infections

119

due to the infectious risk posed by as yet unidentified patients and colleagues. The aim of our

120

study was to prospectively evaluate the effectiveness of sequentially instituted multimodal

121

infection control interventions at our large tertiary care centre by sequential seroprevalence

122

measurements and assessment of seroconversion rates amongst the various hospital

123

workers.

METHODS

129

Study design

130

Participants were recruited in the screening period 1 (SP 1) between 20 March and 9 April

131

2020 by informing employees of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. The city-

132

state of Hamburg with 1.8 million inhabitants and a metropolitan catchment area of more

133

than 4.5 million inhabitants was affected by the pandemic relatively early due to public

134

holidays in March 2020, when numerous travelers returned from high-risk regions, especially

135

Italian and Austrian ski resorts. By 24 July, a total of 5291 cases had been confirmed, which

136

constitutes one of the highest rates in Germany.16 The University Medical Center Hamburg-

137

Eppendorf, which has 1738 hospital beds, has treated more than 170 covid-19 patients during

138

the study period. Of those, 70 were admitted to the intensive care unit, 51 required

139

mechanical ventilation, and 12 patients required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation

140

(ECMO) therapy. Of note, a large number of immunocompromised patients with high viral

141

loads and a protracted course of disease posed a particularly high transmission risk to HCWs.17

142

Participants were recruited to the study via an internal email newsletter. To assess the

143

infection rate of employees, we assessed seroconversion at one and three months: i) sampling

144

period 2 (SP 2) one month after SP 1 (20 April to 8 May 2020) and ii) sampling period 3 (SP 3)

145

another 2 months after SP 2 (22 June to 24 July).

146
147

Data collection

148

On the day of recruitment, we collected demographic and general work-related data including

149

profession, occupational area, and patient contacts using a questionnaire. In addition, we

150

used another questionnaire to assess known and possible past contact to covid-19 patients

151

with or without sufficient PPE as well as presence of symptoms during the past 4 weeks at SP

152

1 and SP 2 and during the past 8 weeks at SP 3 respectively. Fever, cough, and dyspnea were

153

classified as typical symptoms while rhinorrhea, sore throat, headache, stomach pain, joint

154

and muscle pain, nausea, and diarrhea and were considered as uncharacteristic symptoms.

155

Questionnaires were available both paper-based and via online REDcap electronic data

156

capture tools hosted at our institution.18 19 Study participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG

157

ratio were contacted again by phone to ask if nasopharyngeal swabs for RT-PCR had been

158

performed and whether a source of infection could be identified.

As a large tertiary referral centre and one of the major infectious diseases units of the country,

170

we have highly trained personnel and a specialized infectious disease ward. In addition,

171

additional covid-19 units were opened both in intensive care and for standard care, following

172

intensive staff training. Thus, patient care with full PPE including FFP2 masks of all identified

173

covid-19 patients was standard of care from the beginning of the pandemic, and even though

174

supply was scarce throughout the first two months, application of strict protocols to limit

175

wasteful use of equipment allowed sufficient supply all through the pandemic. When first

176

infections in staff members occurred, several further steps were undertaken starting with the

177

universal use of face masks in all clinical settings, and measures were intensified further after

178

a nosocomial outbreak on one of the haematology wards.17 In addition to separate covid-19

179

units, use of full PPE in all covid-19 care, and use of surgical face masks in all clinical units of

180

the hospital, universal screening of all hospital admissions was instituted at April 20, with a

181

roll-out period of about ten days until full adherence across all hospital departments. In

182

addition, RT-PCR testing of staff at risk was offered as of May 11, but this measure was

183

primarily instituted as a reassurance measure for our staff rather than an infection control

184

measure.

185
186

Study procedures

187

During all three sampling periods, serum samples were drawn from the study participants. A

188

semi-quantitative SARS-CoV-2 IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) targeting the

189

S1-Domain of the S-protein spike protein subunit was performed using a commercial kit

190

(Euroimmun Medizinische Labordiagnostika, Lübeck, Germany). Testing procedures were

191

performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. According to the manufacturer, a

192

ratio of ≥1.1 should be regarded as positive. The manufacturer reports a specificity of 99.3%.

193

We have recently independently validated those results and showed a specificity of 99.1%.20

194

However, an optimized IgG ratio of ≥ 1.5, has been shown to display a specificity of 100% by

195

us and by others.21 Therefore, we used both the manufacturer’s and this more stringent cut-

196

off value for positive results to account for optimal specificity in a low prevalence

197

environment. Given the sequential testing in our study population and the expected rise of

198

IgG antibody ratio ≥1.5 at some time point in infected individuals, this cut-off value is

199

considered the best compromise for optimum sensitivity and specificity. Study participants

200

were classified as seropositive in all future sampling periods, if they had an IgG antibody ratio

201

≥1.5 at least once, even if antibody ratios waned over time. This was found to be the case in

202

three study participants, who became seronegative at SP 3. However, in order to also look at

203

the data with maximum sensitivity, we also analyzed the participants with a ratio of >1.1.

Statistical analyses

209

Results were subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Fishers'

210

exact test was used to the determine association between two categorical variables. A two-

211

sided P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.

212
213

Patient and public involvement

214

The study was presented to and approved by the academic and non-academic workers

215

representation boards of our hospital and the design agreed with both boards as well as the

216

management board of the hospital.

261

A total of 23.3% (n=292) of participants reported having been in contact with known covid-19

262

patients. The majority of those (n=223) worked exclusively in the direct care of patients with

263

diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections and thus reported to always be equipped with appropriate

264

PPE. Another 69 HCWs had contact with patients that were diagnosed with covid-19 only

265

later, i.e. after exposure, and did therefore not wear adequate PPE at the time. Occupational

266

contact to infected colleagues was reported by 11.2% (n=140), and known community

267

contacts by 2.8% (n=35) of participants.

268
269

Serological results

270

At the initial screening period a total of 0.8% (n=10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.3 to 1.3)

271

participants were found to be SARS-CoV-2 seropositive (figure 1). Another ten individuals,

272

representing 0.8% of all study participants at SP 2, showed seroconversion at the first follow-

273

up visit, giving a seroprevalence of 1.6% (95% CI 0.9 to 2.3). At SP 3, two more individuals had

274

developed SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, giving a seroconversion rate of 0.16% between SP 2

275

and SP 3, or 0.08% per month, and thus a total seroprevalence of 1.8% (n=22, 95% CI 1.0 to

276

2.5) by the end of the study when using the optimized IgG ratio of ≥ 1.5. One of the two

277

participants showing seroconversion only at SP 3 had indeed a positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-

278

2 and missed the first follow-up visit since he was in quarantine. While it is likely that that this

279

seroconversion took place before SP 2, we have no proof of this, thus the case was counted

280

as converting in the second observation period.

281

Three participants with an IgG ratio of ≥ 1.5 at SP 1 subsequently had a negative test result at

282

SP 2 and SP 3 respectively suggesting that their infection had occurred early. This

283

demonstrates that a cross-sectional study with a single measurement only at SP 3 would have

284

missed these three infections. When analyzing the serological data with of maximum

285

sensitivity, i.e. with a cut-off value of ≥ 1.1, the overall results were very similar: 19

286

participants showed anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies with a ratio ≥ 1.1 at SP 1, another 13

287

participants showed seroconversion during the first month between SP 1 and SP 2. Only 2

288

additional participants showed seroconversion with this lower cut-off in the subsequent two

289

months, bringing the total of possible seroconverters in the last two months up to four, or

290

two per month (figure 2).

RT-PCR testing history of seroconverted participants

294

Out of all clearly seropositive study participants, a total of 40.9% (n=9), one of them before

295

SP 1 and the others between SP 1 and SP 2, had been diagnosed with covid-19 by RT-PCR and

thus had been placed under quarantine during the study period. Another six seropositive

297

HCWs reported that they had at least one nasopharyngeal swab performed due to symptoms

298

or close contact with a covid-19 case but were tested negative at that time. The remainder of

299

seven clearly seropositive individuals had not been tested by RT-PCR at all.

300
301

Risk factors for seroconversion

302

Complete information on symptoms throughout the study period was provided by 1061

303

(84.7%) of the study participants. Of those, 54.9% (n=582) reported covid-19 related

304

symptoms (see supplementary table). Only 10.6% (n=112) did not report any symptoms

305

throughout the study period, the rest reported symptoms not considered typical for covid-

306

19. Typical SARS-CoV-2 symptoms were reported by 72.7% (n=16) of seropositive and 54.4%

307

(n=566) of seronegative study participants (P=0.4). The probable source of infection could be

308

identified for the majority of seropositive study participants. A total of six HCWs presumably

309

got infected when caring for patients that were only subsequently diagnosed with covid-19

310

and had thus not used appropriate PPE at the time of exposure. Five HCWs most likely

311

contracted SARS-CoV-2 while caring for covid-19 patients with adequate PPE. Other probable

312

infection routes in our cohort were close contact with infected colleagues (n=3), community

313

transmission in high-risk regions (n=3), and infected household contacts (n=1). For the

314

remainder of four seropositive employees, the source of infection could not be established.

315

Seropositivity was not statistically significantly higher in HCWs (2.0%, n=21/1026) compared

316

to other hospital workers (0.4%, n=1/227, P=0.16). When only addressing HCWs directly

317

involved in the care of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections (3.8%, n=11/292) compared to

318

other HCWs (1.4%, n=10/734, P=0.025) seropositivity was significantly increased.

319

Importantly, both seroconverters of SP3 were not involved in inpatient care, but exclusively

320

worked in the outpatient clinics.

321
322

DISCUSSION

323

This study demonstrates a very low overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in hospital workers at

324

our tertiary care centre, and the increasing effectiveness of a combination of infection control

325

measures. The low overall in-hospital SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates of healthcare personnel

326

were achieved despite both substantial community transmission in the city-state of Hamburg,

327

and, more importantly, a large number of covid-19 patients treated, some with very high and

328

long-lasting viral loads, at our tertiary care centre. While the relatively early detection of the

329

first cases in Germany

330

multimodal infection prevention and control measures was instrumental in minimizing

331

occupational exposure risks. While seropositivity amongst HCWs was initially higher in HCWs

332

directly involved in the care of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to other

333

employees, only two more seroconversions were observed after the implementation of all

334

multimodal infection during the last two months, and both of these did not involve inpatient

335

care but seemed to have occurred during outpatient clinics or from the community. Also, one

336

of those two physicians had been tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR between SP 1 and

337

SP 2 and did therefore not attend the first follow-up visit, so that this seroconversion may

338

also have also occurred the first observation period. Thus, presumably only one study

339

participant, a physician employed in an outpatient clinic, contracted a SARS-CoV-2 infection

340

in the two months between SP 2 and SP 3. All other participants were protected despite a

341

considerable number of covid-19 patients being treated at our centre during that time period

342

(figure 3). Considerably higher seroprevalence has been reported for HCWs in Belgium (6,4 –

343

12,6%)

344

States of America (7,6 - 36%) 29 30. Those high infection rates are likely to be at least partially

345

attributable to insufficient protection of exposed HCWs. While the effectiveness of universal

346

use of face masks at hospitals has been shown to significantly decrease hospital transmission

347

67

348

the early phase of the pandemic. However, adequate PPE when caring for confirmed covid-

349

19 patients alone is not sufficient to prevent healthcare transmission, since asymptomatic

350

and pre-symptomatic individuals can play a pivotal role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.4

351

Also at our centre, the repeated detection of SARS-CoV-2 positive yet asymptomatic patients

352

presented an important exposure risk leading to occupational infections. Systematic RT-PCT

353

testing of all hospital admissions, either prior to scheduled admissions or in the emergency

354

department, instituted at the end of April, reduced this infection risk to practically zero. The

355

fact that three HCWs seroconverted during the study period despite reporting use of

356

appropriate PPE when caring for covid-19 patients underlines that PPE alone is not sufficient

may have increased preparedness, the addition of further

357

to prevent viral transmission to HCWs. To our surprise, the majority of seropositive study

358

participants had not been diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infections despite a very low threshold

359

in our hospital for RT-PCR screening, with more than 7.300 nasopharyngeal swab

360

examinations of hospital HCWs performed during the study period. Furthermore, symptoms

361

compatible with covid-19 were widely prevalent in healthcare professionals regardless of

362

serological results, a number of seropositive employees did not report any such symptoms

363

and were thus not tested. This demonstrates that symptom-based testing of HCWs, while an

364

important tool to mitigate nosocomial infections, has limited sensitivity and very low

365

specificity in detecting infected HCWs. Complete protection of HCWs is not only helpful for

366

their direct protection but is also key for preventing nosocomial infections in patients.

367
368

Limitations

369

There are some limitations to our study: firstly, we did not recruit a strictly representative

370

sample of healthcare professionals at our institution, since participation was voluntary.

371

However, the distribution of professions was close to the overall hospital workforce

372

distribution. We included a somewhat higher proportion of clinically exposed HCWs, in

373

particular front-line HCWs from the emergency department, intensive care and infectious

374

diseases departments, most likely because these HCWs were highly exposed and thus more

375

motivated to participate in the study. Secondly, since several multimodal infection control

376

interventions were sequentially adopted and the study did not include a control group, this

377

study is not able to answer the question which measures are most effective in preventing

378

healthcare transmission, and which might have been superfluous. Thirdly, sensitivity and

379

specificity of serological assays is limited, so a precise assessment of the number of infected

380

HCWs is not possible. However, the results were independent of the cut-off levels used for

381

serological testing (figure 2), supporting the reliability of the results.

382
383

Conclusion

384

We report a very low seroprevalence amongst HCWs and other healthcare professionals at

385

our tertiary care centre at the beginning of the covid-19 epidemic and very few

386

seroconversions after the implementation of multimodal infection prevention and control

387

interventions. When in addition to personal protection and universal face masks RT-PCR

388

screening of hospital admissions was instituted, occupational transmission could be brought

down to zero cases in inpatient care and only one or two related to outpatient clinics. Taken

390

together, our findings demonstrate that multimodal infection control measures are able to

391

effectively prevent healthcare transmission for SARS-CoV-2, and thus protect both HCWs and

392

patients.
