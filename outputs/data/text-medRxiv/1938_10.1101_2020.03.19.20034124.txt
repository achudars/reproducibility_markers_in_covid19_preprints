Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched Pubmed on March 15, 2020 using the terms (“COVID-19” OR “novel
coronavirus” OR “2019 novel coronavirus ” OR “2019-nCoV” OR “pneumonia” OR
“coronavirus”), AND “Myocarditis” OR “Cycle threshold (Ct)” OR “Altitude”. We found

that one article analyzed the risk factors affecting the prognosis of adult patients with
COVID-19 in terms of survivorship, without considering Ct values as extrinsic factors.
Moreover, there are no reported studies on viral myocarditis caused by COVID-19 and the
relationship between the altitude and COVID-19.
Added value of this study
We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data, Ct values, laboratory indicators and imaging
findings of 84 adult patients with confirmed COVID-19. Three key-independent risk factors
of COVID-19 were identified in our study, including age [OR 2.350; 95% CI (1.206 to
4.580); p=0.012], Ct value [OR 0.158; 95% CI (0.025 to 0.987); p=0.048] and PII [OR
1.912; 95% CI (1.187 to 3.079); p=0.008]. Amongst 84 patients, 13 patients (15.48%)
were noted with abnormal electrocardiograms (ECGs) and serum myocardial enzyme
levels; whereas 4 (4.8%) were clinically diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis. Moreover,
altitude should be considered for COVID-19 severity classification, given that oxygen
partial pressure and blood oxygen saturation of regional patients vary with altitudes.

Implications of all the available evidence

Three key-independent risk factors of COVID-19 were identified, including age, PII, and Ct
value. The Ct value is closely correlated with the severity of COVID-19, and may act as a
predictor of clinical severity of COVID-19 in the early stage. SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis
should be highlighted despite a relatively low incidence rate (4.8%). The oxygen pressure
and blood oxygen saturation should not be neglected as closely linked with the altitude of
epidemic regions.

Abstract
Background

Notwithstanding the clinical hallmarks of COVID-19 patients were reported, several critical
issues still remain mysterious, i.e., prognostic factors for COVID-19 including extrinsic
factors as viral load of SARS-CoV-2 and intrinsic factors as individual’s health conditions;
myocarditis incidence rate and hallmarks.

Methods

Demographic, epidemiologic, radiologic and laboratory data were collected by medical
record reviews of adult hospitalized patients diagnosed as COVID-19. Cycle threshold (Ct)
value data of real-time PCR (RT-PCR) were collected. The time duration was from 21
January to 2 March, 2020. Pulmonary inflammation index (PII) values were used for chest
CT findings. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent
severity risk factors.

RESULTS

In total, 84 hospitalized adult patients diagnosed as COVID-19 were included, including
20 severe and 64 nonsevere cases. The viral load of the severe group was significantly
higher than that of the non-severe group, regardless of the Ct values for N or ORF1ab
gene of virus (all p<0.05).Typical CT abnormalities was more likely existing in the severe
group than in the nonsevere group in patchy shadows or ground glass opacities,
consolidation, and interlobular septal thickening (all p<0.05). In addition, the PII values in

the severe group was significantly higher than that in the nonsevere group (52.5
[42.5-62.5] vs 20 [5.0-31.6]; p<0.001).

Amongst 84 patients, 13 patients (15.48%) were

noted with abnormal electrocardiograms (ECGs) and serum myocardial enzyme levels;
whereas 4 (4.8%) were clinically diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis. Multivariable
logistic regress analysis distinguished three key independent risk factors for the severity
of COVID-19, including age [OR 2.350; 95% CI (1.206 to 4.580); p=0.012], Ct value [OR
0.158; 95% CI (0.025 to 0.987); p=0.048] and PII [OR 1.912; 95% CI (1.187 to 3.079);
p=0.008].

Interpretation
Three key-independent risk factors of COVID-19 were identified, including age, PII, and Ct
value. The Ct value is closely correlated with the severity of COVID-19, and may act as a
predictor of clinical severity of COVID-19 in the early stage. SARS-CoV-2 myocarditis
should be highlighted despite a relatively low incidence rate (4.8%). The oxygen pressure
and blood oxygen saturation should not be neglected as closely linked with the altitude of
epidemic regions.

Introduction

Since late 2019, a type of viral pneumonia named as COVID-19 has been greatly
threatening people’s health and lives globally. Due to the epidemics of COVID-19 from
Wuhan, Hubei Province to all parts of China and increasing number of countries,1 the
medical community is facing with unprecedented challenges with swift actions all over the
world. The pathogen of COVID-19 has been identified as SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), a family member of coronaviruses.2-4

Wu and McGoogan5 reported the summary of 72, 314 COVID-19 cases in China from
the point of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, including data until Feb
11, 2020. Notably, there were 416 cases aged less than 10 years (1%) and 549 cases
aged between 10-19 years (1%). As early as Feb 7, 2020, Wang et al6 reported the clinical
features of 138 patients in Wuhan, China, classifying cases into ICU-treated (26.1%) and
ICU-free groups (73.9%). The median age was 56 years with 54.3% male patients.
Patients treated in ICU were older, with underlying comorbidities, complaining of dyspnea
and anorexia, in comparison with ICU-free patients. Laboratory indicators with statistical
significance between two groups included higher levels of white blood cell and neutrophils

counts, D-dimer, creatine kinase, and creatine. Notably, higher level of lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) was linked with ICU-treated group. Xu et al7 reported their clinical
findings amongst 62 COVID-19 patients in Zhejiang Province, China. Due to limited
number of patients admitted to ICU (1 case) and the less severity of cases, statistical
significance of data was unavailable.

So far, Guan et al reported the clinical observational results with the largest number
of COVID-19 patients as 1099 cases from 552 hospitals of 30 provinces of China.8 The
majority of enrolled patients were over 65 years (41.9%) and nonsevere cases (926/1099).
Moreover, Negative radiologic findings existed in 17.9% nonsevere patients and 2.9%
severe patients. Various degrees of hemocytopenia presented on admission. Higher level
of LDH was noted in severe group (58.1%) than nonsevere group (37.2%).

Hitherto, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection with real-time PCR (RT-PCR) is the
diagnostic gold standard of COVID-19. Fortunately, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 was
unraveled with 29903 nucleotides (MN908947.3)3,4, consisting of 11 genes. Taking
advantage of suitable primers (recommended targeting ORF1ab gene from 266 to 21555
bp,

and

N

from

28274

to

bp,

http://ivdc.chinacdc.cn/kyjz/202001/t20200121_211337.html), low copies of virus can be
detected by PCR enriching through a number of PCR cycles. For RT-PCR diagnosis, the
cycle threshold (Ct) value reflects viral copies, i.e., viral load. Lower Ct value represents
higher viral load, as extrinsic factor for individuals. High viral load was reported in an
asymptomatic 6-month-old infant with COVID-19, reflected by dynamic Ct value changes

of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.5 Despite high viral load reflected by low Ct values (13.73 for
ORF1ab gene, 15.57 for N gene), the infant was asymptomatic. Notably, scarce evidence
is available on viral load and clinical outcome, notwithstanding RT-PCR has been widely
used in clinical practice.

Whereas these frontier studies presented critical lines of evidence on the emerging
infectious disease as COVID-19, most patients were undergoing treatment with unclear
outcome when data were summarized. Therefore, several critical issues still remain
mysterious, i.e., prognostic factors for COVID-19 including extrinsic factors as viral load of
SARS-CoV-2 and intrinsic factors as individual’s health conditions, including those
identified as candidate risk factors (older age, underlying comorbidities, higher levels of
white blood cell and neutrophils counts, D-dimer, creatine kinase, and creatine).6
Nevertheless, the clinical significance of abnormal serum myocardial enzymes identified
by previous studies6-8 has not been well documented, in particular viral potentiality of
myocardial damage and underlying mechanisms.

Accordingly, the study aimed for addressing these important issues based on a
retrospective observational study of 84 adult cases in Chongqing municipality, China
(adjacent to Hubei Province).

Methods

Data Sources

We performed a retrospective study highlighting the clinical and radiographic
hallmarks of diagnosed cases as COVID-19 in Yongchuan, Chongqing from Jan 21 to Mar
2, 2020. As an officially nominated hospital for COVID-19 patients, Yongchuan Hospital
(affiliated to Chongqing Medical University) has been in charge of the treatment of
COVID-19 cases from Yongchuan District, Chongqing municipality (close to Hubei
Province). The study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Yongchuan
Hospital (No. 2020KLS-6). We obtained oral informed consent for involved patients and/or
their relatives. All consecutive adult cases (aged over 18 years) diagnosed with COVID-19
were included. All patients were under close surveillance until Mar 2, 2020.

Demographic, epidemiologic, radiologic imaging and laboratory data were collected by
intensive medical record reviews of included cases, with double checks and additional
inquiries when appropriate. The diagnosis and treatment were conducted strictly
conforming to the COVID-19 national program provided by the National Health
Commission of China (5th edition).9

Pathogen confirmation with double SARS-CoV-2 tests

Each patient underwent double tests for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection every 24
hours on his/her nasopharyngeal swab samples. In brief, viral nucleic acid from samples
was conducted using viral isolation kits (Daangene, Guangzhou, China). Fluorescence

real-time PCR was performed with diagnostic reagent kits (two available kits; Sansure
Biotech, Changsha, China and Daangene, Guangzhou, China) on LightCycler 480
Real-Time PCR instrument (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) at Yongchuan Disease Control
Centre. Ct (Cycle threshold) value of no more than 40 (either genes or single gene with
double tests) was considered as SARS-CoV-2 positive according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Thermal cycling was performed at 50 oC for 15min, 95 oC for 15min, 45
cycles of 94 oC for 15s and 55 oC for 45s. The sensitivity of RT-PCR assay kits was
500copies/ml. The primers were: Primer 1 targeting open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) of
SARS-CoV-2,

5’-CCCTGTGGGTTTTACACTTAA-3’;

whereas

primer

targeting

nucleocapsidprotein(N) as 5’-GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT-3.6-7 Ct value data were
collected from Yongchuan Disease Control Centre.

Laboratory tests

Full spectrum laboratory tests were performed at admission and successive
appropriate times, including blood count, serum biochemistry, serum inflammatory
indicators, myocardial enzymes. Additional tests were performed according to patients’
detailed conditions of background diseases. Lymphocytes sorting analyses were
conducted using flow cytometre (Bricyte e6, Mindray, Shenzhen, China) and pertaining
assay kits (Mindray, Shenzhen, China).

Chest CT scans

At admission, each patient underwent chest CT scans (Go.top, SIMENS; parameters,
120kv, 50-200mA, automatic modulation, thickness as 5mm) for the evaluation of lung
lesions. Subsequently, follow-up chest CT scans were performed when suitable.
Diagnostic images were analyzed by experienced radiologists. Pulmonary inflammation
index (PII) was estimated according to the criteria proposed by Chongqing Radiologist
Association of China,10 with distribution and size of lesions estimated. As for distribution,
one lung segment equals one score with highest score as 20, representing left and right
lung lesions. For lesion size, 1 score indicates over 50% lung segment volume invasive,
whereas 0 score less than 50%. Accordingly, PII= (Distribution score+ Size
score)/40*100%. PII values were calculated twice at three week intervals by two
experienced radiologists. Interclass coefficient was used to assess inter-rater reliability.

program and the American Thoracic Society guidelines.11 In brief, patients were included
in severe group if they meet with the following criteria: 1) Shortness of breath with
respiratory rate (RR) >30 times /min; 2) Oxygen saturation <93% at rest; 3)Arterial partial
oxygen pressure (PaO2)/oxygen absorption concentration (FiO2)<277mmHg (The result
was calculated according to the altitude of the epidemic area, Yongchuan city is about 700
meters above sea level, 1mmHg=0.133 kPa); 3) Pulmonary imaging showed that the
lesion had progressed to > 50% at 24 ~ 48 h; 4) Respiratory failure;5) Shock; 6)Combined
with other organ failure. Continuous (means for normally distributed variables and/or
interquartile ranges for abnormally distributed variables) and categorical variables
(percentage, %) were analyzed using SPSS, version 29.0. Unpaired t test, Fisher exact
test, Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test were performed where appropriate.
Multivariable logistic regress model was used to control for confounding factors and
distinguish independent risk factors for clinical severity. Risk factors with a univariable
p-value<0.05 were eligible for inclusion in the model. Severe group was coded as “1” and
nonsevere group was coded as “0”. Variables (p≤0.10) were in the final model, with
significant variables identified (p<0.05), via a forward and stepwise protocol. Adjusted
odds ratios (ORs, indicating pertaining digital times more likely to present in severe group)
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as independent risk factors.
Spearman’s correlations were used to assess the links between multiple factors.

Presenting Hallmarks

In total, the study cohort included 84 hospitalized adult patients diagnosed as
COVID-19. By March 2, 2020, 68 of the 84 patients had been cured and discharged, and
there were still 16 hospitalized patients with no deaths. The median age was 48 years
(Interquartile Range [IQR], 42·3-62·5; range, 18-93) with 48 males (57.1%). Amongst
these adult patients, 20 cases were classified as severe group at admission; whereas 64
cases as nonsevere group.

The median duration from illness onset to diagnosis was 2 days (IQR, 1-5). Onset
symptoms were fever (54[64.3%]), cough (43[51.2%]), expectoration (28[33%]), fatigue
(16[19.0%]),

anorexia

(14[16.7%]),

myalgia

Dizziness(8[9.5%]),

Pharyngalgia(8[9.5%]), Chilly(8[9.5%]), short of breath (7[8.3%]), diarrhea (6[7.1%]),
Headache (4[4.8%]), Dyspnea(3[3.6%]), Nausea (3[3.6%]), Vomiting(2[2.4%]) and
Fluster(2[2.4%]). Notably, there were 11(13.1%) asymptomatic cases in the cohort, and all
were in the nonsevere group(table 1).

The average peak temperature was 37.7

℃. Forty cases (47.6%) had family cluster

infection; whereas 43 patients (51.2%) had Wuhan linkage.

In comparison with nonsevere patients, the severe cases were older (58.0 [IQR,

Thirty-five cases had one or more comorbidities. The most common coexisting
diseases were hypertension (12[14.3%]), Hepatic damage (11[13.1%]), diabetes
(10[11.9%]), cardiopathy (5[6.0%]), respiratory disease (5[6.0%]) and brain disease
(4[4.8%]). Less common coexisting diseases were tumor (1[1.2%]) and renal damage
(1[1.2%]). However, there was no significant difference in comorbidities except for
diabetes (5[25%] vs 5[7.8%]; p=0.001).

Laboratory indicators

There were significant differences in a number of laboratory indicators between
patients in the severe and non-severe groups (table 2). Distinct inter-group laboratory

In addition, in the detection of lymphocyte subsets, total T lymphocyte count, B
lymphocyte count, and Inhibitive/Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte count were significantly reduced
in the severe group compared with the nonsevere group.

Ct values representing viral load

The Ct values of RT-PCR for two target genes (ORF1ab and N) were recorded in 62
of all patients, with a total of 207 values at corresponding time points (table 3). There were
three different types of samples were used to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 190
nasopharyngeal swab, 3 stool and 14 anal swab samples. In order to maintain the
uniformity of the samples, the results of the anal swab samples and stool samples were
excluded from our study. There were 14 patients with 51 nasopharyngeal swab samples in
the severe group, while 48 patients with 139 nasopharyngeal swab samples in the
nonsevere group. In the severe group, the median Ct values of RT-PCR for N gene was
33.8(IQR, 27.1-36.6) and for ORF1ab gene was 34.7(IQR, 30.9-37.7). While in the
nonsevere group, the median Ct values of RT-PCR for N gene was 38.1(IQR, 34.2-40.2)
and for ORF1ab gene was 38.6(IQR, 36.0-41.5). There was significant difference in Ct

groups.

Chest CT findings and PII

Totally 84 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 underwent at least two or more CT
examinations (table 3). An excellent inter-rater reliability was noted in the assessment of
PII values(>0.89).The median of pulmonary inflammation index (PII) was 27.5(IQR,
7.5-42.5). The study showed that the PII values in the severe group was significantly
higher than that in the nonsevere group (52.5 [42.5-62.5] vs 20 [5.0-31.6]; p<0.001). The
most common CT abnormalities were patchy shadows or ground glass opacities
(60[71.4%]), consolidation (41[48.8%]), interlobular septal thickening (58 [69%])(figure 2).
Most patients have multiple areas of lung lesions with bilateral lung lesions (60[71.4%]),
lower lung distribution (53[63.1%]), mid lung distribution (59 [70.2%]), and upper lung
distribution (76[90.5%])(figure 3). Typical CT abnormalities was more likely existing in the
severe group than in the nonsevere group with significant difference in patchy shadows or
ground glass opacities (19[95%] vs 41[64.1%]; p=0.008), consolidation (17[85%] vs
24[37.5]; p<0.001), and interlobular septal thickening (18[90.0%] vs 40[62.5%];
p=0.020).There were also significant differences in the areas of lung lesions between the
two groups. Compared with the nonsevere group, patients in the severe group were more
likely to have bilateral lung lesions (20[100%] vs 40[62.5%]; p=0.001), and the lesions was
more frequent in the lower lobe (19[95 %] vs 34[53.1%]; p=0.001) and middle lobe (20

was found in the upper lobe of the lung (20[100 %] vs 56 [87.5%]; p=0.189).

Complications during hospitalization

Complications during hospitalization were documented (table 4). There were 47
(56.0%) cases with electrolyte disorders, 37(44.0%) cases with anemia, 36(42.9%)cases
with

abnormal

cardiac

enzymes,

30(35.7%)cases

with

abnormalities,

27(32.1%)cases with hypoproteinemia, 23(27.4%) cases with gastrointestinal disorders,
22(26.2%) cases with bacterial pneumonia, 20(23.8%) cases with type 1 respiratory
failure, and 6(7.1%) cases with renal abnormalities. Except for gastrointestinal disorders,
the incidence of all complications in the severe group was significantly higher than that in
the non-severe group (p<0.05). Of the 20 patients with respiratory failure, 9(45%) were
treated with assisted mechanical ventilation, 7(35%) with nasal catheters and 4(20%) with
masks. The median time from onset to respiratory failure was 7.75 days and to
mechanical ventilation was 8 days.

Clinical diagnosed myocarditis

Among all 84 patients, we found 13 patients with abnormal myocardial injury
indicators combined with abnormal ECG, including 8 severe patients and 5 nonsevere
patients (table 5). Four of the 13 patients had a history of cardiovascular diseases, while
the other 9 patients had no such history. There were 3 cases with a history of
hypertension, 1 patient with hypertension, atrial fibrillation and coronary heart disease

who was excluded from our further analysis. The 12 remaining patients had abnormal
changes in the myocardial enzymes or cTnI, amongst which 10 cases with high levels of
inflammatory markers (except for patient no.9 and 11), and eleven of them exhibiting
clinical symptoms of myocardial injury (except for patient no. 9).

Typical abnormal ECG findings were noted in ten patients (except for patient no.2, 6
and 12). Major ECG abnormalities included sinus tachycardia or bradycardia, t-wave
changes, atrioventricular block, and anomaly Q wave. Four patients underwent repeated
ECG examinations. Patient no. 3 was an elderly female patient in the severe group. The
first ECG indicated t-wave changes and sinus bradycardia. However, repeated ECG
restored normal after treatment with a decrease in inflammatory markers and cardiac
enzyme levels. Patient no. 4 was an elderly male patient in the severe group. His first
ECG indicated First-degree atrioventricular block, t-wave changes, left axis deviation and
abnormal Q wave in the lower wall, while the abnormal Q and t-wave disappeared after
treatments. Patient no. 9 and 10 were in the nonsevere group. Their initial ECGs showed
sinus tachycardia and sinus tachycardia associated with t-wave changes respectively,
with repeated normal ECGs after treatment.

Based on the most updated diagnostic criteria of viral myocarditis12-13 (Disease code:
H00395), 4 cases(patient no.4, 7, 8 and 10) were clinically diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2
myocarditis in combination of their manifestations, i.e., confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection,
typical ECG abnormalities, and elevated laboratory myocardial damage indicators(figure

In order to explore the intrinsic correlations between cardiac enzymes, ECG and cTn I
with inflammatory cytokines and lymphocyte levels, we used Mann-Whitney U test to
analyze the relevant data (table 6).The results showed that the level of cardiac enzymes
was significantly positively correlated with the level of CRP (p=0.004) and PCT (p=0.012).
In addition, this study also found that there was a significant correlation between the
abnormality of ECG and the level of PCT (p=0.004) and lymphocytes counts (p=0.041).
However, we did not find any correlation between cTn I and levels of inflammatory
cytokines or lymphocytes.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis

In this study, multivariable logistic regress model was used to identify the
independent risk factors for clinical severity of COVID-19 (figure 6). Omnibus Tests of
Model Coefficients indicated that the

χ2

of the multivariate logistic model was 32.595

(p<.050), validating the statistical significance of the model. We tried to include several
indicators with statistical differences amongst univariate analyses (except laboratory
tests), and the multicolinearity test was carried out according to variance inflation factor.
According to the equation fitting degree and the independence of indicators, 6 variables
were finally included in multivariable logistic regress model including age, PII, ct value,
anorexia, and diabetes. The final results determined that age [OR 2.350; 95% CI (1.206 to
4.580); p =0.012], Ct value [OR 0.158; 95% CI (0.025 to 0.987); p=0.048] and PII [OR
1.912; 95% CI (1.187 to 3.079); p=0.008] were statistically different--independent risk
factors for COVID-19(table 7).

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first clinical cohort study to analyze the extrinsic (viral
load) and intrinsic risk factors of patients with COVID-19. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2
myocarditis was diagnosed clinically with an incidence rate of 4.8%. Previous neglected
regional altitude issue was considered for COVID-19 severity classification.

Previous studies mainly focused on the clinical characteristics, imaging findings and
treatment measures of COVID-19,2,3,5-8 however, few studies pay attention to its risk
factors and complications.14-16 There were significant differences between severe and
nonsevere COVID-19 in age, clinical manifestations, imaging findings, levels of
inflammatory cytokines and myocardial enzymes, and distribution of lymphocytes and
their subsets, consistent with previous studies.3,5-8 Furthermore, multivariable logistic
regress analysis identified three key independent risk factors for the severity of COVID-19,
i.e., age, PII, and Ct values.

Ct values from the RT-PCR can act as a proxy for viral load.17,18 In viral respiratory
infectious diseases, viral load has been proved to be closely related to the severity of the
diseases.19-21 It is still unclear whether the virus load is closed related to the severity of
COVID-19 patients, although sporadic case studies have been reported18,22. We found
that the patients’ viral load was associated with severity of COVID-19 as an independent
risk factor.

In addition, all the complications (except for gastrointestinal disorders) of
COVID-2019 during hospitalization were found significantly higher in severe than

nonsevere patients. Among all patients, a total of 36 patients had a high level of cardiac
enzymes or cTnI. After excluding the history of cardiac diseases and combining the ECG
and clinical manifestations, 4 patients were clinically diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2
myocarditis according to most updated diagnostic criteria,12,13 of which 3 cases occurred
in severe group and 1 in nonsevere group. However, the pathological mechanism by
which the COVID-19 causes viral myocarditis is still uncertain.

Common pathogens for myocarditis include viruses as coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3),23
belonging to the Enterovirus genus in the family of Picornaviridae. CVB3 accounts for over
33% of myocarditis patients.24 Kimura et al25 reported that IFITs (IFN-induced
tetratricopeptides) play a basic role in cardiomyocytes’ antiviral process. IFITs comprise
five human sub-family (IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFIT5 and IFIT1B) members.26 Tomko et
al27identified the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) in 1997 and confirmed by
Bergelson et al28 in 2005. CVB3 interacts via the coreceptor decay accelerating factor
(DAF) with human cells.29 As a type I transmembrane protein, CAR localizes in the tight
junctions of epithelial cells and in the intercalated discs between cardiomyocytes30. ACE2
has been predicted as receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in case of the similarity with SARS-CoV.
The issue remains elusive as for SARS-CoV-2 directly interacting with CAR and damaging
myocardiocytes. These issues need to be studied by further evidence.

At present, there is no uniform standard for severity classification of COVID-19.
National Health Commission of China (5th edition)9 mainly classified the severity
classification of COVID-19 according to the respiratory condition of patients, such as

respiratory rate (RR) >30 times /min, oxygen saturation<93% at rest, PaO2/FIO2
ratio<300mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate and blood oxygen saturation are affected
not only by the disease itself, but by the altitude of the location. The higher the altitude, the

é

lower the atmospheric pressure and the partial oxygen pressure, and vice versa. P rez et
al investigate the prevalence of oxygen desaturation in adults aged ≥40 years as altitude
above sea level increases.31 They concluded that altitude was closely related to
hypoxaemia and might be the most important determinant of low oxygen saturation,
inspite of other known factors such as age, diabetes and lung diseases. In subsequent

é

study, P rez et al32 also found that higher altitude of residence was associated with a
higher risk of hospitalization and death in patients with influenza-like illness and severe
acute respiratory illness. However, neither the National Health Commission of China (5th
edition)9 nor the American Thoracic Society guidelines11considered the influence of the
altitude of the pathogen site on the oxygen pressure. In our study, we calculated the
correct PaO2/FIO2 ratio by taking altitude into account, which was conducive to accurate
classification and subsequent treatments.

There are some limitations in our study. Firstly, the sample size in our study was
relatively small, only 84 patients were included. The deadline of the collected data was
March 2, 2020, with 16 patients still hospitalized. Secondly, we did not get exact viral load
of patients as viral copy numbers due to the urgent outbreak of COVID-19 and limited
conditions. We used Ct values as a substitute. Nevertheless, the results of multivariable
logistic regress model demonstrated that the Ct value of SARS-CoV-2 is valid and reliable.

Thirdly, we diagnosed four cases of viral myocarditis clinically, without evidence of cardiac
biopsy as the gold standard of diagnosis. The echocardiography and cardiac MRI were
unavailable due to limited protective measures. However, we strictly excluded the
interference of the patient's cardiac history, and made a clinical diagnosis based on the
clinical manifestations of myocardial injury, high levels of cardiac enzymes and cTn I, as
well as typical ECG changes, which were consistent with the most updated diagnostic
criteria of viral myocarditis.12,13

Conclusions

Three key-independent risk factors of COVID-19 were identified, including age, PII,
and Ct value. The Ct value is closely correlated with the severity of COVID-19, and may
act as a predictor of clinical severity of COVID-19 in the early stage. SARS-CoV-2
myocarditis should be highlighted despite a relatively low incidence rate (4.8%). The
oxygen pressure and blood oxygen saturation should not be neglected as closely linked
with the altitude of epidemic regions.
