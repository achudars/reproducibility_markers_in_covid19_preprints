Abstract

23

Background

24
25

A unique concern pertaining to the spread of COVID-19 across countries is the asymmetry of

26

risk and the irrational fear of a new pandemic and its possible serious consequences. This study

27

aimed to perform a time series analysis on the association between climate factors and daily

28

cases of COVID-19 in Malaysia up to 15 July 2020. The second objective was to predict daily

29

new cases using a forecasting technique. To address within-country variations, the analysis was

30

extended to the state level with Sarawak state as an example.

31

Methodology/Principal Findings

32
33

Datasets on the daily confirmed cases and climate variables in Malaysia and Sarawak state were

34

obtained from publicly accessible official websites. A descriptive analysis was performed to

35

characterize all the important variables over the study period. An autoregressive integrated

36

moving average (ARIMA) model was introduced using daily cases as the dependent variable and

37

climate parameters as the explanatory variables.

38

For Malaysia, the findings suggest that, ceteris paribus, the number of COVID-19 cases

39

decreased with increasing average temperature (p=0.003) or wind speed (p=0.029). However,

40

none of the climate parameters showed a significant relationship with the number of COVID-19

41

cases in Sarawak state. Forecasts from the ARIMA models showed that new daily COVID-19

42

cases had already reached the outbreak level and a decreasing trend in both settings. Holding

Conclusions/Significance

46
47

The findings suggest that climate parameters and forecasts are helpful for reducing the

48

uncertainty in the severity of future COVID-19 transmission. A highlight is that forecasts will be

49

a useful tool for making decisions and taking the appropriate interventions to contain the spread

50

of the virus in the community.

Introduction

69

As of 15 June 2020, 7,823,291 confirmed cases and 431,541 deaths from the novel coronavirus

70

disease (COVID-19) have been reported from the WHO’s six regions [1]. In Malaysia, the first

71

sporadic case was detected on 24thJanuary 2020, and as of 16 July 2020, 8,739 confirmed cases

72

and 122 deaths have been reported [2]. A unique concern across countries is the asymmetry of

73

risk and the irrational fear of a new pandemic with its possible catastrophic consequences, as

74

documented with the 1918 Spanish flu that killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide. To

75

reduce uncertainty, governments need to accurately forecast the spread of confirmed cases.

76

According to current evidence, the COVID-19 virus ((severe acute respiratory syndrome

77

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) is primarily transmitted among people through respiratory

78

droplets and contact routes [3]. As such, climate factors such as temperature and/or relative

79

humidity may influence the transmission of coronavirus [4]- by affecting its survival. Previously,

80

studies have documented the relationship between weather parameters and severe acute

81

respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus

82

(MERS-CoV).

83

Time series studies are most relevant when data have been accumulated over a

84

considerably long period of time. A common challenge to time series methodology is the

85

availability of data. We were able to identify the weather parameters and daily COVID-19 cases

86

at the country level instead of the weekly, monthly or annual aggregates. This finer temporal

87

resolution will allow us to further characterize short-period variations. Despite the sustained

88

transmission of COVID-19 cases, the effects of climate factors on the population risk of COVID-

89

19 in Malaysia have not yet been assessed in detail.

90

Hence, two research questions arise: “Is there a role of climate parameters on the

91

possible viral spread in Malaysia?” and “what is a forecast of regional transmission of new

92

cases?”. Taken together, the objective of the present study was to perform a time series analysis

93

on the association between climate factors and daily cases of COVID-19 in Malaysia between

94

January 2020 and 15 July 2020. The second objective was to predict daily new cases using a

95

forecasting technique. Further, to address within-country variations, we extend our analysis to

96

the state level with Sarawak state as an example.

97

We anticipate that our findings will be useful not only for policymakers in Malaysia

98

but also for countries that will experience inclement weather conditions in 2020 to prepare the

99

necessary public health response for the potential spread of COVID-19.

Study area

105

Malaysia is located between 2° and 7° N, bordering Thailand to the north and Singapore to the

106

south. Sarawak state (1.5533°N, 110.3592°E) is an administrative region of Malaysia located on

107

Borneo Island.

110

Publicly accessible datasets of the daily confirmed cases and deaths in Malaysia were obtained

111

from the official website of the Malaysian Ministry of Health (MOH). These data were cross-

112

checked with the John Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center Repository

113

(https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases) up to 15th July 2020

114

These data originated from the active and passive case surveillance system in Malaysia.

115

We extracted the total daily counts of confirmed cases up to 15th July 2020. The first COVID-19

116

case was announced in China in late December 2019, and the first case in Malaysia was

117

announced on 23rd January 2020. This finding implies that COVID-19 had spread to Malaysia

118

within one month.

119

Climate factors

120

The daily mean temperature (°F), relative humidity (%), precipitation (%) and wind velocity

121

(mph) over the study period were collected from an archive of weather data for Malaysia

122

(https://weatherspark.com/history/). For the country level, we used the means of the climate

123

parameters across the reported states.

124

Statistical analysis

125

First, a descriptive analysis was performed to characterize all the variables over the study

126

period in Malaysia and Sarawak state. Then, we introduced an autoregressive integrated moving

127

average (ARIMA) model, using daily cases as the dependent variable and the climate parameters

128

as the explanatory variables.

129

A structural ARIMA model was introduced to examine the association between the

130

number of COVID-19 cases (daily counts) and the various explanatory variables (i.e., the mean

131

temperature, wind speed, precipitation and relative humidity). We computed various

132

permutations of the order of the autoregressive (AR), order of integration (I) and order of moving

average (MA) terms and chose the optimal combination of parameters using the mean squared

134

error. The correlograms were visualized to help in determining the orders of the MA and AR

135

terms to include in the model. Before modeling the daily confirmed cases, we checked the

136

stationarity of the data series by the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test [5]. A model was first

137

applied to quantify the aggregate country-level associations between the climate variables and

138

the daily cases of COVID-19. Another model was applied to quantify the state-specific

139

association for Sarawak state, Malaysia.

140

We applied the auto.arima(1,1,0) function to forecast new cases. The best order of an

141

ARIMA process was determined through a unit root test to identify the appropriate degree of

142

differencing and by the minimization of the corrected Akaike information criterion (AIC) [5].

143

We then conducted fourteen-day-ahead point forecasts and calculated the prediction intervals,

144

taking into account the incubation period. Two analytical models were introduced depending on

145

the situation of COVID-19 in Malaysia in general and Sarawak state in particular.

146

The forecast accuracy was checked with four accuracy measures: the mean absolute error

147

(MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute scaled error (MASE), and root

148

mean square error (RMSE) [6]. We performed the Ljung–Box test, for which a p-value greater

149

than 0.05 means that the residuals for the current time series model are independent [5].

Forecasting of the confirmed COVID-19 cases

197

For Malaysia, ARIMA forecasting with the auto.arima(1, 1,1) function showed the best order

198

of an ARIMA process with the appropriate degree of differencing and identification of the AR

199

and MA parameters. This finding was also applicable to the auto.arima(1,1,1) model for

200

Sarawak state. The forecast results for new daily COVID-19 cases in Malaysia and Sarawak state

201

(prediction of 14 days) are presented in Fig 3 and Fig 4, respectively. We produced a final set of

202

forecasts and prediction intervals using the most recent data, up until 15th July 2020. We

203

estimated two levels of uncertainty (80% and 95% CIs). Ljung–Box tests showed that the null

204

hypothesis of the serial independence of the residuals for the current time series models could

205

not be rejected (p> 0.63 for Malaysia, p> 0.87 for Sarawak state).

206

Fig 3 Forecasts of new daily COVID-19 cases in Malaysia (prediction of 14 days).

207

Fig 4 Forecasts of new daily COVID-19 cases in Sarawak state (prediction of 14 days).

208

As seen in the figures, the spreads were characterized by a declining trend, indicating that

209

the COVID-19 transmission has probably already reached its peak. However, the slowdown in

210

the new COVID-19 cases seems to require shorter time for Sarawak state compared to the whole

211

country. On the other hand, a small spike (around a single digit) was seen in Sarawak state; this

212

finding cannot rule out the possibility of a new wave (with small intensity) if the current

213

recommendations/standard operating procedures such asocial/physical distancing, the use of face

214

masks, and hand washing, as issued by the Malaysian MOH is not followed properly. The

215

forecast accuracies were validated with the MAE, MAPE, MASE, and RMSE (S1 Table).

A study in Singapore reported that an average maximum temperature increase of 1 °C decreased

epidemic, a study of Beijing and Hong Kong showed an inverse relationship between

238

temperature and the number of cases [9]. Although an exact cause is not yet known, a possible

reason may be that higher temperature influences the viability of the severe acute respiratory

syndrome coronavirus 2 virus [7]. A higher wind speed was significantly and positively related

241

to the number of new COVID-19 cases reported in a study in Turkey [7], which was

242

contradictory to the current findings in Malaysia.

243

Temperature is a fundamental factor in the human living environment that can play an

244

important role in public health in terms of epidemic development, prevention, and control [10].

245

Unpublished studies have also reported that low temperatures are beneficial to viral transmission

246

[11,12].

247

Bill Gates commented on COVID-19 transmission saying that “I hope it’s not that bad,

248

but we should assume it will be until we know otherwise” [13]. It is believable that forecasts and

249

their associated uncertainty can and should be an integral part of the decision-making process,

250

especially in high-risk cases [14]. In this study, univariate time series models which assume that

251

the data are accurate and past patterns will continue to apply were used [15]. Significant,

252

consistent forecast errors (potentially spanning outside the prediction intervals) should be

253

associated with changes in the observed patterns and the need for additional actions and

254

measures encountered.

255

The modeling quality is dependent on whether the assumptions are violated or not. In this

256

study, the model’s diagnostic tests and a small percentage of error terms ensure the forecasting

257

validity. The assumptions required for the prediction intervals of ARIMA models, such as

258

uncorrelated and normally distributed residuals, were not violated. Moreover, the accuracy,

259

robustness, coherency and uncertainty mitigation that the models imply have made them a

260

popular forecasting framework, highlighting the potential benefits of multiple temporal

261

aggregation in decision making [16]. Forecasts of deaths and hospitalizations (the number of new

cases in this case) will help inform public health decision making by projecting the likely impact

263

of the COVID-19 pandemic.

264

Study limitations

265

There were limitations to the current analyses that need to be acknowledged. As the results are

266

based on aggregate data for the country and specific to only one particular state, in light of

267

geographic differences, the evaluation power could have been affected. Additionally, the results

268

may have been affected by the quality of the data in relation to the accuracy of the diagnostic

269

tests for COVID-19. Furthermore, there might be other factors (e.g., the quality of the case

270

surveillance system) other than weather variables that can influence the transmission potential of

271

COVID-19. Only a few weather variables were available for inclusion in the current study.

272

Nevertheless, there are strengths in the current study. The source data for COVID-19

cases originated from the national database, which is identical to the John Hopkins’s database,

274

thus ensuring the accuracy of the data. The findings were, to a certain extent, comparable to

275

those from other published studies. For instance, an inverse relationship between the average

276

temperature and the number of new cases was in line with the findings from other countries. As

277

we hope the presented forecasts clearly show, epidemic growth is a highly nonlinear process,

278

where every day lost to inaction is too much [17]. On the other hand, a small spike

279

(approximately a single digit) was seen in Sarawak state; this finding cannot rule out the

280

possibility of new (small intensity) waves. This finding implies a potential small wave is

281

expected in Sarawak state, if people fail to comply with the measures recommended by the

282

Malaysian MOH such as social/physical distancing, use of face masks and hand washing. In this

283

context, forecasts will be a useful tool for governments and individuals to make decisions and

284

take appropriate actions to contain the spread of the virus [15].

Conclusions

286

The findings suggest that it is important to consider climate parameters and forecasts to reduce

287

the uncertainty in the severity of future COVID-19 transmission. Our results highlight that

288

forecasts will be a useful tool for making decisions and taking the appropriate interventions to

289

contain the spread of the virus in the community.
