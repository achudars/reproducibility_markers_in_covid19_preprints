ABSTRACT
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a strain of coronavirus that
causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and has been declared a global pandemic by the
World Health Organization. Total cases of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide exceed 4.8 million, with over
320,000 deaths recorded. Little is known about the body’s immune response to SARS-CoV-2
infection. In this paper, we describe SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody responses in 28,523 patients from
the New York City metropolitan area and report a SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity rate of 44%,
indicating the widespread nature of the pandemic in the city and state of New York.
Additionally, for a subset of patients, we report on the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 patient
symptom severity and level of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody found in the patient sample.
INTRODUCTION
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was identified in a cluster of pneumonia
patients in Huabei Province China in the city of Wuhan (1). This novel coronavirus strain [since
named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)] is a member of the
Betacoronavirus family and has ~80% sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-1, which is no longer
circulating in humans (2). On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared SARSCoV-2 a global pandemic (3). Since its first description, SARS-CoV-2 has spread from China, and
as of today (May 19, 2020) has spread to 215 countries and territories across the globe and is
responsible for 4.81 million confirmed infections and over 320,000 deaths, including over
90,000 deaths in the United States (4,5).
SARS-CoV-2 spreads mainly though contact with infectious respiratory droplets generated when
an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through contact with saliva or nasal discharge (6).
Symptoms of infection by SARS-CoV-2 can range from mild (cough, fever, sore throat) to severe
(shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, pneumonia) and more severe illness seems to affect
the elderly or immunocompromised (7).
Little is known about the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antibodies against SARSCoV-2 have been reported to be detected as early as a few days, to as many as three weeks
after onset of symptoms (8,9), with the median time from symptom onset to detectable levels
of IgG reported as six days (10). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies generally are
indicative of current or previous infection by SARS-CoV-2, and are thought to confer some
degree of immunity (11), however the extent and duration of immunity conferred by SARS-CoV2 IgG antibodies remains unknown (10,12).
A number of in vitro diagnostics have been developed for the detection of antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2, and many fraudulent or ineffective tests have been released into the market (13).

Recently, a number of SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests have received Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) (14). These tests detect either individual SARS-CoV-2
specific IgG antibodies or total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. All FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2
antibody tests target antibodies against either the viral nucleocapsid protein or spike
glycoproteins, which are the two most abundant immunogenic components produced by the
virus during infection (15). Much remains to be seen whether nucleocapsid or spike
glycoprotein is a better target antigen when developing a SARS-CoV-2 antibody assay, however
there is reason to suspect that in the future, spike glycoprotein will be preferred as a target, as
the viral nucleocapsid is highly homologous among all strains of Coronaviridae (16) and the
spike glycoprotein has been shown to be the target of neutralizing antibodies (17-19).
Little is known about how the body’s antibody response varies with severity of SARS-CoV-2
symptoms, however it is expected that more severe SARS-CoV-2 infections will result in more
robust production of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. In this study, we report on the semiquantitative SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels in a population of patients scored for severity of
illness and show a direct correlation between SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels and severity of
symptoms.
METHODS
Patient Populations
Patients were seen at primary care providers and urgent care facilities throughout New York
city and the surrounding suburbs (Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Nassau, and Suffolk
counties). The majority of patients (74%) were residents of the five boroughs (counties) that
make up New York City (Kings (Brooklyn), Queens, New York (Manhattan), Bronx, and
Richmond (Staten Island)). A subset of 240 patients were used to correlate symptom severity to
antibody response. This subset of patients were seen for SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing at a single
primary care provider in the Boro Park neighborhood of Brooklyn over a one month period
from May 5, 2020 through June 5, 2020. Patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG between
eight and twelve weeks after known or probable exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
Clinical Patient Scoring (Symptom Index)
Patients were seen at an urgent care facility in Brooklyn, New York in May and early June 2020.
As part of their screening, healthcare providers at this facility were asked to rate the severity of
patients’ symptoms on a scale of 0 to 4 (Table 1) to generate a ‘Symptom Severity Index’ (SSI) to
be used as a marker of severity of disease. All SSI were generated before the specimen was sent
to the laboratory for testing, so the SSI result is generated independently of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG
result.
Laboratory Testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG
Semi-quantitative SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing was performed at Sherman Abrams Laboratory in
Brooklyn, NY on serum specimens using the DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG Antibody
Assay on the LIAISON XL platform. This assay is an FDA EUA diagnostic test for the qualitative

detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies but produces a numerical index value (in arbitrary units
per milliliter) which is indicative of the intensity of the reaction, and therefore a surrogate for
SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels.
Data Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using R. Plots of IgG index and age versus SSI were
generated in R, using ggplot, with a data smoothing line applied. Linear regression analysis was
performed using the lm() function native to R.
RESULTS
During the study period, we generated a Symptom Severity Index (SSI) and semi-quantitative
SARS-CoV-2 IgG level on 240 patients. Patient symptoms were scored by the healthcare
provider at the time of office visit from 0-4 using criteria predetermined before the start of the
study (Table 1). Of the 240 patients assigned an SSI, 36% were scored as zeroes, 35% were
scored as ones, 21% were scored as twos, 5% were scored as threes, and 3% were scored as
fours (Table 2).
The distribution of male and female patients in each of the SSI bins is shown in Table 3. There
was no significant difference in gender distribution between patients with SSIs from zero to
two, however patients with an SSI of three or four were disproportionately male. Whether this
difference is due to increased disease severity among male patients (20) or the relatively small
number of patients with an SSI of three or greater remains to be seen. Additionally, the median
age of each SSI group was also determined (Table 4). Generally, patients with a lower SSI were
younger than those with a higher SSI (Figure 1A), possibly indicative of more severe disease in
older patients. This difference was true for both male and female patients (Figure 1B) and was
statistically significant (p-value < 0.01) using a linear regression model.
We next sought to evaluate whether semi-quantitative SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels were
correlated to severity of symptoms as measured by the SSI. Levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody
are plotted against SSI in Figure 2A. A linear regression analysis of the data indicates that SARSCoV-2 IgG antibody levels are positively correlated with SSI (p-value < 0.01). This trend is true
regardless of whether the patient was male or female (Figure 2B). These data imply that more
severe SARS-CoV-2 infections are more likely than less severe infections to generate sufficient
IgG antibodies to confer protective immunity.
In addition, we tested 28,523 patient specimens for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels for whom
we did not obtain a SSI. Of these, 12,424 were SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive indicating a 44%
positivity rate in our patient population, which reflects the extent of the Covid-19 pandemic in
New York City. Positivity rates in males were higher than in females (49% positive IgG in male
patients, and 38% positive IgG in female patients). The lowest prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG
was in patients aged 86-90, with a positivity rate of 25% and pattients aged zero through five,
with a positivity rate of 26% (note, there were no positive IgG results in patients 101-105 years

old, but only three patients from this demographic were tested, so they are omitted from this
analysis). Interestingly, the age groups with the highest prevalence of positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG
are ages 11-15 (56% positive) and ages 16-20 (57% positive) (Figure 3).
We also calculated the mean semi-quantitative IgG Index value by age for the 12,424 SARS-CoV2 IgG positive patients tested. The mean index value across ages was 108.4 AU/mL, with the
average index in males (112.7 AU/mL) being significantly higher than the average index in
females (101.4 AU/mL) (p < 0.05). The mean SARS-CoV-2 IgG index value is lowest in young
adults (ages 16-40) and is highest in children (ages zero to ten) and older adults (ages 76 and
above) (Figure 4A and 4B). This observation is true for both males and females (Figure 4C and
4D).
DISCUSSION
This study is the first to correlate severity of SARS-CoV-2 symptoms with antibody response
using an FDA EUA SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. Additionally, it is one of the first to provide a snapshot
of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody responses in a region of the country that was hardest hit by the
virus, New York City through an analysis of over 28,000 patients presenting to primary care
providers for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing.
We show SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity rates in our patient population to be nearing 50%, which is
indicative of the widespread nature of this pandemic in New York City. Further, our data show
that the highest rates of prior infection are seen in patients aged 11-20 years, however it is
formally possible that part of the explanation for this is a more robust immune response in this
generally young, healthy age group.
Additionally, while the data are preliminary, our study shows that patients who experienced a
more severe clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection are more likely to have higher serum levels
of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. Therefore, it follows, that these individuals are more likely to
benefit from protective immunity and are less prone, at least in the short-term, to reinfection
by SARS-CoV-2.
One potential limitation of our study, is the potential for waning immunity in the weeks after
infection. The patient cohort used to correlate SSI to SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were from a
single tight-knit community in the Boro Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, and were
epidemiologically determined to have had exposure or expected exposure to SARS-CoV-2 eight
to twelve weeks prior to presenting for SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing. While we cannot entirely rule
out alternative time-courses of infection in all patients, the clinical and epidemiological data
gathered suggest all patients in the SSI cohort were infected by SARS-CoV-2 within
approximately two weeks of one another. From the larger sample of 28,523 patients, we do not
have access to sufficient epidemiological data to conclusively determine suspected dates of
exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Future work will be needed to track SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody levels
over time.

The findings of our study have additional implications for blood banks seeking donors for
convalescent plasma to treat Covid-19 patients. These facilities have traditionally screened
donors for antibodies using qualitative antibody tests and have often relied on self-reporting by
patients of their history and timing of symptoms to support a previous diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.
The availability of a semi-quantitative SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay with index values that correlate to
severity of past infection could prove to be of significant help in selecting plasma donors.
Additional studies are underway to better understand the timing of the IgG antibody response
to SARS-CoV-2 and how long those antibodies are maintained in circulation. Further, studies to
correlate the semi-quantitative IgG Index value given by the DiaSorin LIAISON test to a direct
measure of viral neutralization (eg, plaque reduction neutralization titer) are ongoing. Until this
information is available, our study provides clinicians with information they need to gauge
antibody responses between patients and correlate those antibody values to understand the
patient’s clinical history.
