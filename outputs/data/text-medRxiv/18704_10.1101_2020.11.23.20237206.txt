Summary

48
49
50

Background
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as the host receptor for SARS-CoV-2,

51

with a critical role in viral infection. We aim to understand population level variation of

52

nasopharyngeal ACE2 expression in people tested for COVID-19 and the relationship between

53

ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load, while adjusting for expression of the

54

complementary protease, Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), soluble ACE2, age, and

55

biological sex.

56
57
58

Methods
A cross-sectional study of n=424 participants aged 1-104 years referred for COVID-19

59

testing was performed in British Columbia, Canada. Participants who tested negative or positive

60

for COVID-19 were matched by age and biological sex. Viral and host gene expression was

61

measured by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Bivariate analysis and

62

multiple linear regression were performed to understand the role of nasopharyngeal ACE2

63

expression in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ACE2 gene was targeted to measure expression of

64

transmembrane and soluble transcripts.

65
66
67

Findings
Analysis shows no association between age and nasopharyngeal ACE2 expression in

68

those who tested negative for COVID-19 (P=0·092). Mean expression of transmembrane

69

(P=1·2e-4), soluble ACE2 (P<0·0001) and TMPRSS2 (P<0·0001) differed between COVID-19-

70

negative and -positive groups. In bivariate analysis of COVID-19-positive participants,

71

expression of transmembrane ACE2 positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral load

72

(P<0·0001), expression of soluble ACE2 negatively correlated (P<0·0001), and no correlation

73

was found with TMPRSS2 (P=0·694). Multivariable analysis showed that the greatest viral RNA

74

loads were observed in participants with high transmembrane ACE2 expression (B=0·886,

75

95%CI:[0·596 to 1·18]), while expression of soluble ACE2 may protect against high viral RNA

76

load in the upper respiratory tract (B= -0·0990, 95%CI:[-0·176 to -0·0224]).

Interpretation
Nasopharyngeal ACE2 expression plays a dual, contrasting role in SARS-CoV-2

80

infection of the upper respiratory tract. Transmembrane ACE2 positively correlates, while

81

soluble ACE2 negatively correlates with viral RNA load after adjusting for age, biological sex

82

and expression of TMPRSS2.

Research in Context

89
90
91

Evidence before this study
We conducted a MEDLINE ® search using the MeSH topic terms: “angiotensin

92

converting enzyme 2 expression” and “SARS” and “age”, restricting the search to English-

93

language reports published from January 1st, 2020. The search returned n=98 articles, eighty-

94

eight of which reported primary research; these were further filtered by the MeSH qualifiers

95

“epidemiology” and “virology” to provide n=43 articles. Search results were further restricted to

96

the MeSH headings: age, virus replication, host pathogen interactions, nasal mucosa, RNA viral

97

load and real-time polymerase chain reaction, which returned n=24 results. We read through the

98

abstracts of these twenty-four papers and manually selected n=4 for full review. This review

99

provided evidence that ACE2 expression is greater in the upper respiratory tract than the lower

100

respiratory tract, when measured by single-cell RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry and

101

high-sensitivity RNA in-situ mapping. In the upper airway, ACE2 mRNA abundance closely

102

correlates with protein concentration. A reverse genetics study demonstrated that a variable

103

SARS-CoV-2 infection gradient occurs in the respiratory tract, with highest viral loads expected

104

in the upper airway. In several patient cohorts, upper respiratory expression of ACE2 was

105

significantly increased in those who smoke, in this analysis multivariable adjustment of age

106

suggested limited confounding.

Added Value of this study
We measured ACE2 expression in the context of COVID-19 testing to investigate the role

111

of nasopharyngeal ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings support previous work: the

112

strong correlation we observe between nasopharyngeal ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 load

113

also suggests an infection gradient across the human airway. Greater viral loads are expected in

114

tissue with high transmembrane ACE2 expression. No observed relationship between age and

115

nasopharyngeal ACE2 in COVID-19-negative participants suggests that upper airway ACE2

116

expression is independent of the RAAS pathway. We are the first to measure endogenous

117

expression of soluble ACE2 in the upper airway of people tested for COVID-19 and include this

118

measure in multivariable analysis. Importantly, nasopharyngeal expression of soluble ACE2

119

negatively correlates with viral RNA load, inferring a protective role at the population level.

120
121
122

Implications of all the available evidence
Considering all available evidence, ACE2 may play a dual, contrasting role in SARS-

123

CoV-2 infection of the upper airway. Expression of transmembrane ACE2 positively correlates

124

with SARS-CoV-2 RNA load, while expression of soluble ACE2 shows a negative association.

125

Expression of nasopharyngeal ACE2 does not seem to correlate with age, as would be expected

126

in the lower respiratory tract. Risk factors such as smoking may affect the baseline risk of high

127

SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads in those infected. Factors associated with endogenous nasopharyngeal

128

expression of soluble ACE2 require further investigation.

Introduction
In December 2019, clusters of viral pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, China. A novel

132

highly pathogenic human coronavirus was isolated and named severe acute respiratory syndrome

133

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).1 SARS-

134

CoV-2 utilizes the same host receptor and protease for cell entry as the human coronaviruses

135

SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63. The receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) mediates

136

cellular entry, while transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) serves as a complementary

137

host factor.2,3 In human physiology, ACE2 has a cardiovascular protective and anti-inflammatory

138

role, as a constituent of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS).4 Interestingly,

139

expression of ACE2 in the nasopharyngeal tract exceeds that in alveolar tissue, explaining

140

initiation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the upper respiratory tract.5 Transcription of ACE2

141

produces at least two dominant mRNA transcripts responsible for translation into soluble and

142

membrane-bound protein isoforms.6 Although the transmembrane isoform has been shown to be

143

crucial for viral entry into host cells, the role of soluble ACE2 remains uncharacterized, though

144

some evidence exists that it protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection.7,8 Transmembrane serine

145

protease 2 (TMPRSS2) contributes to SARS-CoV-2 cell entry by cleaving the viral spike protein

146

into a conformational form necessary for membrane fusion.2 Unlike ACE2, TMPRSS2 expression

147

occurs more stably across upper airway tissue and alternative enzymes such as cathepsin B/L

148

may perform its role in viral infection interchangeably.5 To understand the importance of ACE2

149

expression in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed a cross-sectional study of people tested for

150

COVID-19 in British Columbia, Canada. The study aims to investigate the relationship between

151

i) nasopharyngeal expression of ACE2 and age in COVID-19-negative participants, ii)

152

nasopharyngeal expression of host genes by COVID-19 test result and iii) nasopharyngeal

153

expression of transmembrane ACE2 and viral RNA load in those who tested COVID-19-positive

154

adjusting for age, biological sex, expression of soluble ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Characterizing

155

expression of nasopharyngeal ACE2 in a large group of participants tested for COVID-19 will

156

increase our knowledge of host genes involved in viral infection and may allow for assessment

157

of baseline risk.

Methods

160

Study Design and Participants

161

We performed cross-sectional sampling of people tested for COVID-19 at the British

162

Columbia Center for Disease Control Public Health Laboratory (BCCDC-PHL) from 24/3/2020-

163

9/5/2020. At the time of sampling, provincial health guidelines required a clinical indication for

164

referral of a COVID-19 test. Inclusion criteria were applied to select study participants whose

165

diagnostic specimens were: tested centrally at the BCCDC-PHL, collected by nasopharyngeal

166

swab, the first test administered by provincial health number, suspended in Hologic AptimaTM

167

media, negative for concurrent Influenza A, B or Respiratory syncytia virus infection, stored at -

168

80C following RNA extraction and for whom host gene expression was successfully measured

169

by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). People meeting the

170

inclusion criteria (n=444), were excluded (n=16) if samples had a SARS-CoV-2 E gene cycle

171

threshold (Ct) value of >=38 by qRT-PCR. COVID-19-positive cases (n=212) were matched in a

172

1:1 ratio with those that tested negative for COVID-19 by age and biological sex (Figure S1).

173

Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the University of British Columbia

174

human ethics board (H20-01110). Demographic variables of age and biological sex were drawn

175

from public health laboratory data. Laboratory methods were performed in a College of

176

American Pathologists accredited laboratory with externally validated qRT-PCR assays. 9–12

179

Procedures
Nasopharyngeal samples collected in Hologic AptimaTM media were stored at 4C before

180

RNA extraction using the Viral RNA isolation kit on the MagMAX-96TM platform

181

(ThermoFisher).13

182

Host and viral gene targets were assayed by qRT-PCR on the Applied Biosystems 7500

183

Real-Time PCR platform using TaqMan FastVirus 1-step polymerase (ThermoFisher). Total

184

reaction volumes equaled 20ul, with 5ul of RNA template, 1ul of 20x primer/probe, 5ul Fast

185

Virus and 9ul of nuclease free water per reaction. Cycling conditions were set to: 50C for 5

186

minutes, 95C for 20 seconds followed by 40 cycles of 95C for 15 seconds and 60C for 1

187

minute. A multiplex qRT-PCR reaction targeting SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) and host

188

ribonuclease P (RNaseP) was used to diagnosis acute viral infection by presence of viral RNA.14

189

Expression of RNaseP was used to ensure sample quality and control for sampling variation.14

190

Participants were diagnosed as COVID-19 positive with an E gene Ct value of <38. The E gene

191

Ct values were transformed to genome equivalents per millilitre by making a 5-fold, 1:10

192

standard curve of SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA- MN908947·3 (Twist Bioscience) (Table S1).

193

Commercially available primer probe sets were used to amplify the host gene targets

194

TMPRSS212 (Hs00237175_m1) (ThermoFisher) and ACE2 10 (Hs01085333_m1,

195

HS01085340_m1) by multiplex qRT-PCR with a glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase

196

(GAPDH) control11 (Hs02758991_g1) (ThermoFisher). Relative gene expression was calculated

197

between TMPRSS2, ACE2 and GAPDH using the 2-ΔΔCt method.15 Transmembrane ACE2 was

198

defined from the Hs01085333_m1 (ThermoFisher) gene target, which exon spans the

199

transmembrane domain. Soluble ACE2 was defined as absolute relative expression between the

200

Hs01085333_m1 (ThermoFisher) and HS01085340_m1 (ThermoFisher) gene targets (Figure

Statistical Analysis

204

De-identified data reporting participant COVID-19 test result, site of sample collection,

205

type of collection media, accessioning laboratory, age and biological sex was accessed from

206

public health laboratory records. Matching of COVID-19-positive people, who met the described

207

inclusion, exclusion criteria, to COVID-19-negative participants by age and biological sex in a

208

1:1 ratio was performed by a nearest neighbor algorithm (n=424).16 Bivariate analysis was

209

performed between: age, biological sex, viral RNA load, TMPRSS2, soluble or transmembrane

210

ACE2, and COVID-19 test result. The balance of covariates between test groups was examined

211

post matching.

212

The relationship between age and nasopharyngeal expression of transmembrane ACE2

213

was examined in COVID-19-negative participants over the age of 18 by both linear regression

214

and categorization of age into 9-year intervals. Differences in ACE2 expression by age category

215

were tested by analysis of variance.

216

Differences in mean expression of host genes by COVID-19 diagnosis was further

217

examined by Levene’s test for equal variance and a two-tailed, t-test assuming non-equal

218

variance.17 Correlation between host gene expression and viral RNA load was analyzed by

219

simple linear regression. Multivariable analysis was performed by multiple linear regression,

220

variable importance was assessed by the partial f-test.18 Collinearity was examined by the

221

variable inflation factor with a cut-off of 10.19 The common cause criterion was applied to

222

control for measured confounding, effect modification was incorporated when found statistically

223

significant.20 All analysis was performed in RStudio version 1.2.5042 using the packages: car,

224

ggsci, tidyverse, dataexplorer, ggpubr, lmtest, publish, forcats, matchit, tableone and effects. 21

Results
The analytic dataset contains an age- and biological sex-matched sample of n=424

234

participants tested for COVID-19 in British Columbia from 24/3/2020-9/5/2020 (Figure S1).

235

Participant characteristics are shown in Table 1. The mean age of n=212 COVID-19-positive

236

participants was 61·6, 47·6% were biologically male. In n=212 COVID-19-negative participants,

237

the mean age was 62·1, 48·6% were biologically male. Bivariate analysis between the examined

238

covariates and diagnosis (COVID-19-negative or -positive) shows balance of age (P=0·83) and

239

biological sex (P=0·92) between groups. Viral RNA (E gene Ct) was only detected in COVID-

240

19 positive participants, with an average Ct value of 28·2. Relative expression of transmembrane

241

ACE2, soluble ACE2, and TMPRSS2 statistically differed by COVID-19 test result (Table 1).

Boxplots of transmembrane ACE2 expression by nine-year age categories in COVID-19negative participants between the ages of 19 and 98 (n=198); boxes represent the Q1-Q3 interquartile range,
whiskers represent 1.5x the Q1 or Q3 and horizontal lines the median transmembrane ACE2 expression by age
category. Nine-year categories were selected to optimize the distribution of observations between groups.
Participants who tested negative younger than 19 or older than 98 were excluded based on n<10 observations per
age group. No difference was detected in mean transmembrane ACE2 expression among age categories (ANOVA,
P=0·092).

Nasopharyngeal expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 by COVID-19 test result
Bivariate analysis showed a significant mean difference in transmembrane, soluble ACE2

266

and TMPRSS2 expression between COVID-19-negative and -positive participants (Figure 2).

267

These differences were further examined to detect non-equal variance for all host gene targets by

268

COVID-19 test result. Assuming non-equal variance, mean expression differed for

269

transmembrane ACE2 (P=1·2e-4), soluble ACE2 (P<0·0001) and TMPRSS2 (P<0·0001) between

(Figure S2). Multiple linear regression estimated that a one-unit change in transmembrane ACE2

288

expression increases viral RNA load by 0·886 Log10 GE/mL (95%CI: 0·596 to 1·18) adjusting

289

for age, biological sex, expression of soluble ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Table 2). No collinearity was

290

detected between covariates. Biological sex could have been dropped from the model as evident

291

from comparison between nested models (P=0·76), but was kept for validity. A partial f-test

292

indicated effect modification between transmembrane and soluble ACE2 expression (P=0·010)

293

(Table 2). No effect modification was observed between transmembrane expression of ACE2 and

294

TMPRSS2 (P=0·23). High expression of soluble ACE2 decreases viral RNA load (B= -0·0990,

295

95%CI: [-0·176 to -0·0224]) (Table 2). The association between transmembrane ACE2

296

expression and viral RNA in nasopharyngeal tissue differs by the concomitant level of soluble

297

ACE2 expressed (Figure 3). Effect modification was visualized by categorizing soluble ACE2 by

298

the relative mean expression +/- 2 standard deviations of all study participants (Low= -2·86,

299

Mean= -0·444, High= 1·98, SD=2·43) (Figure 3).

Discussion

343

In the described study, we measured nasopharyngeal ACE2 and TMPRRS2 relative gene

344

expression by qRT-PCR in a cross-sectional sample of n=424 participants tested for COVID-19

345

in British Columbia. Analysis was performed to understand: the relationship between ACE2

346

expression and age in COVID-19-negative participants, differences in host gene expression

347

between COVID-19-negative and -positive participants and the role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2

349

infection in those who tested positive for COVID-19.
Among participants tested negative for COVID-19, we found no relationship between

350

nasopharyngeal ACE2 expression and age, in a group of adults between 19-98 years of age. This

351

result, agrees with findings from other efforts to characterize nasopharyngeal ACE2 expression at

352

the population level. Bunyavanich et al. reported a difference in ACE2 expression levels between

353

children younger than ten years old and young adults from eighteen to twenty-four years old. 22

354

No difference was evident between young adults, and adults twenty-five or more years in age. 22

355

Lack of a relationship between nasopharyngeal ACE2 expression and progressive aging suggests

356

that expression of ACE2 in the upper airway does not correlate with expression of ACE2 in the

357

RAAS. The physiological importance of ACE2 in the RAAS suggests that its expression would

358

increase in response to age as older people have higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease or

359

similar comorbidities (i.e. diabetes). 23 If nasopharyngeal expression of ACE2 occurs

360

independently of the RAAS pathway, future studies should ascertain what factors if any regulate

361

expression of soluble ACE2 in nasopharyngeal tissue and variation of ACE2 expression in

362

COVID-19-negative people over time. Some populations, such as young children, may have

363

differential levels of nasopharyngeal ACE2 expression which protect against SARS-CoV-2 viral

364

infection.22,24

365

Participants who tested positive for COVID-19 were matched to those who tested

366

negative by age and biological sex to estimate the direct relationship between host gene

367

expression and SARS-CoV-2 test result. This analysis demonstrated that mean expression of

368

transmembrane, soluble ACE2 and TMPRSS2 decreased in COVID-19-positive participants,

369

while variation increased. Unfortunately, the limitation of reverse-causality in cross-sectional

370

study design prevents us from understanding whether the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in positive

371

samples affects host gene expression or host gene expression puts people at risk of viral

372

infection. However, if we make the plausible assumption that at least a single round of viral

373

replication must occur in order for qRT-PCR to generate a positive test result, it suggests that the

374

observed variation in host gene expression of participants who test positive for COVID-19

375

results from viral replication.25 Numerous studies have demonstrated that coronavirus

376

replication disrupts cellular transcription, as resources required by the cell to produce mRNA are

377

instead sequestered by virus to replicate its genome. 26 Reduced transcription of ACE2 by

378

SARS-CoV, but not HCoV-NL63, in an in vitro model of Vero E6 cell infection was previously

379

suggested as a pathological mechanism.3 Putative SARS-CoV-2 disruption of ACE2 expression

380

could partially explain the apparent association between hypertension, diabetes, and severe

381

COVID-19.27 Answering these questions; however, requires a longitudinal study design to test

382

the temporal effect of SARS-CoV-2 replication on the expression of ACE2 and other implicated

383

host genes.

384

The sample was then restricted to participants who tested positive for COVID-19 to

385

investigate the association between nasopharyngeal ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 RNA

386

load. Bivariate and multivariable analysis both suggest that ACE2 plays a dual, contrasting role

387

in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Transmembrane ACE2 positively correlates with viral RNA load,

388

while soluble ACE2 may limit viral infection by reducing viral RNA load. Interestingly, effect

389

modification was observed between transmembrane and soluble ACE2 implicating that the

390

proportion between these molecules may have more importance than absolute expression of

391

either individually. For example, between two people with similar above-average

392

nasopharyngeal transmembrane ACE2 expression, we would expect a higher viral RNA load in

393

the one with lower soluble ACE2 expression. Though we are not equipped to characterize the

394

mechanism by which soluble ACE2 plays a protective role in SARS-CoV-2 infection,

395

identification of this effect at the population level warrants further investigation of the

396

underlying mechanism. Previous work has postulated that soluble ACE2 restricts SARS-

397

CoV/SARS-CoV-2 infection by acting as a decoy substrate.28 In a study of virus-ACE2 dynamics

398

in engineered human tissue, instead of binding to transmembrane ACE2, virus particles bound to

399

soluble ACE2 and were unable to infect susceptible cells.28 Moreover, recombinant soluble

400

ACE2 was recently administered to a COVID-19 patient requiring ventilation.8 In the case report,

401

administration of soluble ACE2 decreased viral RNA load in the patient’s plasma, tracheal

402

aspirate and nasopharyngeal specimens. Additionally, soluble ACE2 did not interfere with

403

production of IgG and assumed its cardiovascular protective role in the RAAS.8

404

Soluble ACE2 may also influence the usage of Neuropilin-1 as a co-receptor or

405

alternative receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Function of Neuropilin-1 for cell entry and infectivity may

406

depend upon high SARS-CoV-2 viral load; therefore, expression of soluble ACE2 may limit

407

SARS-CoV-2 tropism. 29

408
409

We acknowledge that the described study has several limitations. In our sample, the age
distribution possesses a left skew which prevents us from examining the relationship between

410

age and nasopharyngeal expression of ACE2 in participants younger than 18 years of age. The

411

difference in mean host gene expression observed between participants who tested negative or

412

positive for COVID-19 cannot be resolved in a cross-sectional study design due to reverse

413

causality. We attempted to control for immunological gene regulation by excluding people with

414

endemic respiratory co-infections from Influenza A/B or Respiratory syncytia virus. We describe

415

associations between transmembrane, soluble ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RNA load which suggest

416

the dual, contrasting role of ACE2 in viral infection. However, we cannot provide evidence of the

417

mechanism responsible for this association. Additionally, the measure of viral RNA load over-

418

approximates infectious viral titre and viral RNA may be isolated in the absence of infectious

419

virus.30

420

In conclusion, we have characterized nasopharyngeal ACE2 expression in a sample of

421

people tested for COVID-19. Analysis shows no relationship between age and nasopharyngeal

422

ACE2 expression in COVID-19-negative participants 19-98 years old. Expression of

423

nasopharyngeal ACE2 and TMPRSS2 differs between COVID-19-positive and –negative groups.

424

The role of nasopharyngeal ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper-airway may be

425

differentiated by gene isoform expression; transmembrane ACE2 positively correlates with viral

426

RNA load, while soluble ACE2 shows a negative association. Nasopharyngeal expression of

427

ACE2 possesses a dual, contrasting role in SARS-CoV-2 infection at the population level.

Figure S2: Correlation between host gene expression in COVID-19-positive participants and SARS-CoV-2
RNA load. The level of transmembrane ACE2 (red), soluble ACE2 (blue) and TMPRSS2 (black) expression in
positive cases of COVID-19 and its relationship with SARS-CoV-2 RNA is shown in Log10 genome equivalents per
millilitre (GE/mL). Host gene expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR and normalized to expression
of the housekeeping gene GAPDH by the (2-ΔΔCt) method. Soluble ACE2 was defined as absolute relative expression
between the Hs01085333_m1 (ThermoFisher) and HS01085340_m1 (ThermoFisher) gene targets (Figure S3).

Figure S3: Nasopharyngeal expression of ACE2 was determined by two quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction targets, one target (yellow) exon spans the ACE2 transmembrane domain. The other does not
include the transmembrane domain (pink) and lays nested between two motifs known to interact with the SARSCoV receptor binding domain (blue). The measure of soluble ACE2 represents normalized expression of the pink to
yellow target, or the proportion of non-transmembrane ACE2 to transmembrane ACE2.
