Abstract
Background: In the absence of effective treatments or vaccines, the spread of the novel
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can be minimized by effectively implementing
preventive measures. Knowledge and perceptions of the public about COVID-19 play a critical
role in behavioral changes. This study aimed to assess the knowledge and perceptions of COVID19 as well as source of information about the disease among government employees.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 1,573 government employees from 46 public institutions
located in Addis Ababa was undertaken from 8th to 19th June 2020. Paper-based self-administered
questionnaires were used for data collection. ANOVA test and t-test were used to assess the
difference between groups.

Results: The respondents demonstrated very high knowledge of the cause of COVID-19 (93%),
its main clinical symptoms (>90%), the main modes of transmission (89%), the main preventive
measures (>90%). Almost all respondents reported that people with recent travel history (86.8%)
or people who had contact with COVID-19 patients (93.5%) were the high-risk groups to be
infected with coronavirus. In addition, more than half (50.9%) of the study participants reported
that people without travel history nor had contact with confirmed cases are also most likely to be
infected with the virus. About 84% of the respondents perceived that older adults and elderly were
most at risk to die from COVID-19. Similarly, the majority of the respondents reported that adults
with other underlying health problems (95.4%), cigarette smokers (88.1%) and substance users
(87.5%) were more likely to die from the disease. An electronic media such as television (85.5%),
social media (74.1%), online materials (71.1%) and radio (60.8%) constituted the primary sources

of information about COVID-19, followed by healthcare workers (66.6%) and print materials
(35.4%). Television (32.2%) and health workers (30.5%) constituted the most trusted sources of
information related to COVID-19.

Conclusions: This study has showed higher level of knowledge and favorable perception among
respondents about COVID-19. Knowledge and perceptions have great roles in behavioral change
and efforts should be focused on improving the perceived susceptibility, severity, and benefits of
preventive behavioral changes by providing timely and adequate information.

Background
The current worldwide rapid spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused
by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led the World Health
Organization (WHO) to declare it as a full global pandemic on 11th March 2020 [1]. This
unprecedented rapid transmission of the virus has already reached all countries and territories
around the world and caused over 49 million confirmed cases and more than 1.2 million deaths
worldwide as of 5th November 2020 [2]. As of 5th November, a total of 1,854,169 COVID-19 cases
and 44,316 deaths were reported from 57 countries and territories in Africa. The rapid transmission
of the virus from person to person coupled with lack of effective medications and vaccines has
posed serious challenges to controlling the spread of the disease.

The first confirmed COVID-19 case in Ethiopia was reported on 13th March 2020. As of 5th
November, a total of 98,391 confirmed COVID-19 cases with over 57,000 recoveries and 1,508
deaths were reported in the country [2]. This is the highest number of COVID-19 confirmed cases
in East Africa and 4th across Africa. Most (83%) of the cases during the first couple of months
were either imported or close contacts of the imported cases [3] and later dominated by the
community transmission [4]. As of 25th October, contacts of the confirmed cases contributed for
about 23% of the total COVID-19 cases reported in Ethiopia [5]. During our data collection period,
the number of nationally confirmed cumulative COVID-19 cases increased from 2,156 on 8th June
to 4,070 on 19th June 2020, with 89% increase in less than two weeks. Children under the age of
five years and between the ages of 5-15 years were also tested positive for COVID-19. As to the
current scenario, the overall positivity and case fatality rates of Ethiopia are about 6.5% and 1.5%,
respectively [5].

The initial mitigation measures of COVID-19 in Ethiopia focused on isolating and treating
confirmed cases at the treatment center, tracing and quarantining contacts, 14 days mandatory
quarantine of all passengers coming to the country, risk communication and educating the public
about preventive measures to reduce the risk of transmission. Subsequently, Ethiopia has adopted
the recommendations of WHO’s basic public health measures to reduce and contain the
transmission of COVID-19 [6, 7]. In addition, the Government of Ethiopia has implemented a
variety of policy actions and precautionary measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, such
as airport surveillance and suspension of flights, travel restrictions, closure of international
borders, flexible working arrangements, closing schools and universities, suspending sporting and
religious gatherings. Finally, state of emergency that lasted between 11th April to 10th September
2020 was declared to counter and control the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate its impact [8].

Intense media coverage in Ethiopia about the COVID-19 outbreak began in early February 2020
and peaked in March after WHO declared its pandemic level [1] and the first confirmed case report
in the country on 13th March 2020. Since then, awareness creation and updates of the situation of
the pandemic in the country have been daily given to the public by the Ministry of Health (MoH)
and Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) on mass media including radio and television. In
addition, daily updates of the COVID-19 situation and different risk communication and awareness
creation messages have been posted on their Websites, Facebook and Twitter pages. Practically,
all mass media in the country devoted extensive time to the coverage of various aspects of the
pandemic of COVID-19 targeting the general public. Government health education messages via
various mass media are the major source of information about COVID-19 and for promoting selfprotective practices. These preventive messages generally emphasize frequently washing hands

with soap and water, mask wearing, and social distancing measures, including staying at home as
much as possible, avoiding close contact with people including shaking hands, and avoiding
crowds and mass gatherings. However, the public uptake of such health protective behaviors
during epidemics relies on the trust in media and government information [9].

Despite efforts to scale-up public health interventions to contain and mitigate the spread of
coronavirus in Ethiopia, new cases have continued to emerge. The coronavirus has rapidly spread
to every part of the country and local community transmission has been established. Gaps and
negligence in applying the COVID-19 preventive measures among the public have been observed.
The literature on the previous outbreaks of infectious disease suggests that more knowledgeable
people during periods of disease outbreaks tend to worry more about being infected, suggesting a
link between knowledge and risk perception [10]. Therefore, correct knowledge and positive
perceptions and attitudes have paramount importance to prevent the transmission of the virus
through enhancing the preventive practice of people. Studies of people’s perspectives provide
timely and relevant evidence to identify the best preventive intervention that may be required to
correct misconceptions and misunderstandings about the virus [11].

Although there is relatively high knowledge of COVID-19 among urban residents in Ethiopia,
there are several misconceptions and understandings associated with the disease [12]. Likewise,
people’s adherence and compliance to the preventive measures and law enforcement is generally
weak to stop the nationwide spread of the virus. Since the first known confirmed COVID-19 case
in Ethiopia, very few studies were conducted to assess knowledge and perceptions of the people
as part of the efforts in the fight against the disease [13-15]. It is therefore important to understand

people’s knowledge and perceptions regarding COVID-19 to develop effective messages. The aim
of this study was to rapidly assess the knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 among
government employees in Addis Ababa. The results of this study are important to inform future
efforts focusing on the people’s readiness to comply with pandemic control measures and the
development of preventive strategies and health promotion programs.

Methods
Study area and setting
This study was conducted between 08-19 June 2020 in Addis Ababa city administration, three
months after the first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported in Ethiopia. Addis Ababa city is
administratively divided into 10 sub-cities and 116 districts. The projected population of the city
was about 3.6 million in 2019, and was estimated to reach 4.5 million inhabitants by 2030 [16].
Addis Ababa city has the highest burden of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Ethiopia. As of October
18, a total of 45,1724 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported from Addis Ababa, representing
about 51% of the national cases. The responses to COVID-19 pandemic are in line with the
national response strategy, focusing on physical distancing; hand washing; universal use of masks
in public places; avoiding crowding and mass gatherings; tracing, testing, isolating and
quarantining; closures of schools, places of worship, and sporting events; limiting mobility and
stay at home approaches. However, there has been a lot of misconceptions in the city about the
COVID-19 pandemic, how the virus itself spreads and the necessary precautions that should be
taken to prevent infection. In addition, policy responses to COVID-19 have an impact on the socioeconomic functioning of the people and are likely to impact their daily livelihoods.

Study design and sampling
This institution-based cross-sectional paper-based self-administered survey was conducted among
government employees of 46 public institutions located in Addis Ababa city administration. As it
was not feasible to conduct a representative nationwide household or online survey during this
period, the researchers opted to use self-administered survey. The study population for this study
constituted all government employees, working in the selected government institution at the time
of the survey and willing to participate in the study. A single cross-sectional study design sample
size calculation was used based on a 50% prevalence estimate of the outcome variable at 95%
confidence level, 4% precision, a design effect of 2 and 30% non-response rate. Accordingly, the
minimum targeted total sample size for this survey was 1,560 respondents.

Purposive sampling was used to select public institutions located in Addis Ababa city
administration. The institutions were mainly selected from the national or Federal Government
Ministries, Addis Ababa city administration bureaus and sub-cities, and Oromia Regional State
bureaus located in Addis Ababa. A total of 14 Ministry offices, 12 bureaus and six sub-city offices
of Addis Ababa city administration, 12 bureaus of Oromia Regional State, a National Bank of
Ethiopia, and Commercial Bank of Ethiopia Addis Ababa branch were included [Additional file
1]. The reasons for selecting those institutions were because of their diversity in terms of the types
of employees, education, experience and their involvement in decision making processes at various
regional and national hierarchies. Proportional quota sampling was used to allocate the sample
size, with quotas based on the estimated number of employees per institution

Data collection
The survey tools, self-administered questionnaires (SAQ), were developed by the research team.
Some questions were adopted from the WHO tool for behavioral insights for COVID-19 [17]. The
SAQ was initially prepared in English and the final version was then translated into Amharic and
Afan Oromo by two experienced personnel in order to make the questions shorter, simpler and
understandable for the respondents. The tools were again back translated into English by other
independent personnel in order to ensure consistency. The questions in the SAQ were organized
into five sections: (i) socio-demographics and other details; (ii) knowledge of COVID-19 signs
and symptoms, (iii) knowledge of the mode of transmission, (iv) knowledge of treatment and
vaccine; (iii) knowledge of prevention methods; and (iv) source of information.

The final English questionnaire was translated independently into Amharic and Afan Oromo
languages. Backward translation from Amharic and Afan Oromo to English was carried out by
another two independent translators. A total of 20 data collectors were involved in the data
collection of this survey, using standardized paper-based SAQ. After obtaining informed consent
from all potential participants, the questionnaires were distributed to the respondents. The
respondents were also informed neither to consult a friend nor read an online or any other material
before responding to the questions.

Statistical analyses
Data were entered into the Census Surveys Professional (CSPro) version 7.2 statistical software
package and imported into the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23 (SPSS
Inc., IBM, USA) for cleaning and analysis. Most of the knowledge and perception questions were

designed as ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Knowledge of the cause, mode of transmission, main clinical symptoms
and preventive measures was assessed using a 15-item scales with responses recoded as
‘1=Correct’ and ‘0=Incorrect’. The items were summed to form a total knowledge score, with
higher scores indicating greater knowledge (range=0-15). Cronbach’s alpha for the knowledge
score was 0.786.

Basic descriptive statistical methods such as frequencies, percentages and cross-tabulations were
conducted to summarize the data and determine the differences between groups for selected
demographic variables. Descriptive statistics by level of government were summarized using
frequency distribution tables. Knowledge scores were compared according to demographic
characteristics with independent samples t-test for two groups, or one-way between-groups
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey HSD post-hoc tests for three or more groups.
Multivariable linear regression analysis was not performed to identify factors associated with
knowledge of COVID-19 due to the violation of normality assumption. The statistical significance
level was set at p<0.05.

Results
Characteristics of the sample
Of 1,730 eligible participants contacted from 46 public or government institutions, 1,573 (91%)
successfully completed the interview for final analysis. About 40% of the respondents were drawn
from national institutions, followed by Addis Ababa city administration (38.8%) and Oromia
Regional State (21.6%). The mean (±SD) age of the respondents was 35 (±8.5) years (range: 1966) and participants aged 30-49 years represented 63.9% of the sample. The majority of the

respondents 64.2% were male and 88.3% held a bachelor’s degree or above. The mean (±SD) and
median years of service in the institution was 6.6 (±6.4) and 4 years (range: 1-37), respectively.
The mean (±SD) household size was 4.1 (±2) people (range: 1-14). Table 1 shows the distribution
of the participants’ characteristics by government level. The distributions of the characteristics
across the three government levels were similar to each other except that majority of respondents
in Oromia resided out of Addis Ababa (33.3%) and had at least 10 years of service (48.9%).

Knowledge of the causes, signs and symptoms, incubation period and treatment of COVID-19
The majority (92.9%) of the study participants knew that COVID-19 was caused by a viral
infection, and this was consistently higher (>91%) across the three government levels (Table 2).
Meanwhile 89.2% of the respondents correctly identified the mode of SARS-COV-2 transmission
via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. About 4% of the
respondents stated that the coronavirus can be transmitted via airborne droplets or through eating
uncooked food. The most commonly cited signs and symptoms of the COVID-19 included fever
(96.9%), cough (95.2%), difficulty in breathing (95.2%), headache (90.3%), sore throat (83.9%)
and myalgia (81%). The less commonly reported signs and symptoms comprised loss of taste and
smell, runny nose, diarrhea and hemoptysis (coughing up of blood). About 62% of the respondents
from Oromia reported runny nose as a symptom of COVID-19 as opposed to 43.6% and 40% of
respondents from national or Addis Ababa, respectively. Nearly 93% of the respondents cited
correctly that the maximum incubation period for the novel coronavirus was up to 14 days. About
95% of the respondents correctly stated the unavailability of specific vaccine or antiviral treatment
for COVID-19. Few respondents cited the availability of specific vaccine or treatment for COVID19.

Knowledge of COVID-19 preventive measures
Respondents’ knowledge level of coronavirus virus prevention methods across the government
level was pervasive (Table 3). The overwhelming majority (>90%) of the respondents reported
very high knowledge of coronavirus prevention that includes the most important prevention
methods such as stay at home, physical distancing, avoiding close contact with people including
hand shaking, use of face mask, frequent hand washing with water and soap, avoiding touching
eyes, nose and mouth, avoiding mass gatherings, movement restriction and use of
sanitizers/disinfectants. Of the respondents, only 34.6 % thought that they had very good
knowledge on how to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus, and 56.5% reported good or
adequate knowledge to prevent the spread of the virus.

Perceptions about susceptibility and severity of COVID-19
Almost all respondents correctly stated that people with recent travel history abroad (86.8%) or
people with contact with COVID-19 patients (93.5%) were the high-risk group most likely to be
infected with the virus (Table 4). However, more than half (50.9%) of the study participants
reported that people without travel history nor had contact with confirmed COVID-19 cases are
also most likely to be infected with coronavirus. About 84% of the respondents perceived that
older adults and elderly (above 60 years) were most at risk to die from COVID-19. Meanwhile,
62.8% of the study participants reported that both male and female have equal chance to die from
the disease although 22.2% perceived that males had more chance to die from COVID-19. With
the group of adults more likely to die if contracted COVID-19, the majority of the respondents
reported that adults with other underlying health problems (95.4%), adults who are cigarette
smokers (88.1%) and adults who frequently use substances such as alcohol, khat and cannabis
(87.5%) were more likely to die from COVID-19. In contrast, just over one-fifth (21.9%) of the
respondents reported that adults without other underlying health problems are also most likely to
die from COVID-19.

14.1±1.69, and 59% scored 100%, on a scale of 15. There was no statistically significant difference
in knowledge scores between male (14.1±1.71) and female (14.0±1.92) respondents, t (1530) =
0.302 (two-tailed), with very small magnitude of the differences in the means (mean difference =
0.098, 95% CI: -0.088 to 0.285). Surprisingly, the difference in knowledge score is also not
significant between educational groups, age groups, year of experience, household size and
whether tested for coronavirus or not. In the contrary, the level of government shows statistically
significant difference in knowledge score, with respondents from the Oromia less knowledgeable
about COVID-19 than study participants from national or Addis Ababa, F (2, 1570) = 3.60,
p=0.028.

Discussion
This study aimed to investigate the knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 among government
employees selected from 46 public institutions in Addis Ababa city administration during June 08
to 19, 2020. At the time of this study, the spread of COVID-19 in Addis Ababa cumulatively
increased by 84% from 1,625 on 8th June to 2,988 on 19th June, with an average of 114 per day.
This study revealed higher perceived knowledge about COVID-19 and its preventive measures.
The prevention and control of such pandemic is strongly influenced by people’s ability to comply
with the recommended preventive public health strategies, which are often associated with how
people perceive their susceptibility to infection, whether they have the necessary knowledge,
capacity, confidence and trust to adapt the strategies [18-22].

Given the limited epidemiological and community behavioral COVID-19 studies published in
Ethiopia, we have opted to compare our findings with other studies conducted elsewhere in Africa
or around the world. The respondents demonstrated sound knowledge about the cause of COVID19, the main modes of transmission of the virus, main signs and symptoms, incubation period and
unavailability of specific treatment or vaccine. Studies indicate that the most prevalent clinical
symptoms among COVID-19 infected individuals include fever, cough, and fatigue [23]. Studies
conducted in Ethiopia towards the end of March 2020 showed a high knowledge level about the
main clinical symptoms, route of transmission of COVID-19 and preventive practices [13, 15].
Studies revealed that increased in knowledge and perceived risk to a particular health problem
would influence preventive behaviors to reduce the risk of developing the health problem. This
means people’s knowledge, perceptions and attitudes about COVID-19 play a central role in the
prevention and control of the pandemic through influencing and shaping their specific preventive

behaviors such as hygiene and social distancing [11, 24, 25]. Higher knowledge and risk
perceptions about COVID-19 were associated with increased protective behavior change [26].

The current study shows that respondents were highly knowledgeable about the preventive
measures of the COVID-19, with the most commonly cited measures constituting staying at home,
physical distancing, avoiding close contact with people including hand shaking, use of facemask,
frequently washing hands, avoiding mass gatherings, movement restriction, and use of
sanitizers/disinfectants. A similar study conducted in Ethiopia in April 2020 also showed that
about 90% of the participants had good prevention knowledge of maintaining physical distance
and washing hands frequently [14]. Several studies conducted in other countries have also
indicated high levels of COVID-19 knowledge among the general population [27-30]. The study
resulted that the overall knowledge about the causes and symptoms, the unavailability of vaccine
or specific antiviral treatment, and the main preventive measures of COVID-19 was ‘high’. This
finding was not surprising since the study was conducted three months after the first confirmed
COVID-19 case in Ethiopia where massive awareness creation, intensive public health
interventions and policy measures have been implemented. The seriousness of the COVID-19 and
the overwhelming information about the disease has helped the population to know more about
this pandemic. Similar studies in Africa such as Ghana [29], Nigeria [31], Tanzania [32] and
beyond [28, 30] revealed high COVID-19 knowledge among their study participants.

The findings of the current study also show that the respondents were highly knowledgeable about
the group of people most at risk of contracting the novel coronavirus, and an overwhelming
majority reported that people who had contact with COVID-19 patients and people with recent

history of international travel were most likely for contracting the virus. These findings are
associated with the number of people infected with the virus during the first couple of months after
the onset of the epidemic in Ethiopia where the majority of the cases were imported from abroad
or the infections were linked to the other confirmed COVID-19 cases. More than half of all
respondents cited that people without a history of travel or contact with confirmed cases are also
likely to acquire coronavirus infection, which is highly aligned with the current COVID-19
situation in the country, particularly with the widespread occurrence of community transmission.
Current observations in Ethiopia suggest that people of all ages are generally susceptible to
contract coronavirus infection. However, studies in China during the early stage of the outbreak
showed that people who were in close contact with patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic
COVID-19, including health care workers and other patients in the hospital, were at higher risk of
infection [33].

Regarding the group of people most at risk to death after being infected by coronavirus, the
majority of the study participants reported adults with other underlying health problems, older
adults/ elderly, adults who are cigarette smokers and people who frequently use substances such
as alcohol, khat and cannabis. A study from Jimma showed that 73% of the respondents knew that
elderly people who have chronic illnesses are at higher risk of developing a severe form of COVID19 [15]. A recent multivariable analysis that uses data from China finds the increasing odds of
inpatient death among the elderly [34]. Another study also finds that older age and a high number
of comorbidities are associated with higher severity and mortality from COVID-19 [35]. Likewise,
being under 60 years with a body mass index (BMI) ranging from 30 to 34 is associated with a

30 [36]. This reveals that a younger person who is experiencing other health complications or with
higher BMI faces as much risk as the elderly. Of the COVID-19 patients investigated in another
study in China, 48% suffered comorbidity, marked by a high prevalence of hypertension, diabetes,
and coronary heart disease [34].

Our findings indicate that the majority of the study participants reported that both male and female
have equal chance to die from COVID-19 although about one-fourth of the respondents perceived
that males had more chance to die from COVID-19. Men and women generally seem to respond
differently to the effects of COVID-19. Available evidence suggests that men are more likely to
die of COVID-19 than women, owing presumably to the biological and lifestyle factors [37-39].
Biological factors lead to sex-differentiated susceptibility to illness. For example, men are more
prone to acute health problems, partly explaining why women live a little longer than men [40].
There is also a sex difference in lifestyle or health behavior. Men smoke and consume alcoholic
beverages more than women [41]. As far as the current evidence is concerned, men and women
experience similar odds of COVID-19 infection, but men are disproportionately exposed to the
severest of outcomes, including death [35].

During an emerging infectious disease like coronavirus, receiving timely and accurate information
enables individuals to take appropriate actions to protect themselves, shaping their risk perception.
In the current study television, social media, online materials, health workers and radio were
identified as the main sources of information for COVID-19. In addition, television and health
workers were reported as the most trusted sources of information related to COVID-19. Similar
surveys conducted at the early phase of the pandemic in Ethiopia also showed social media and

television to be the main source of information about COVID-19 [13,14]. In Nigeria, the most
common sources of information about COVID-19 were identified as television and radio, followed
by social media and the internet [42]. Under health emergency circumstances, adequate literature
or reading materials may not be readily available, and in such situation, television, radio, internet
and social media play a major role in providing up-to-date information to the public. However, it
should be noted that access to television and social media depends on the local contexts such as
on the availability of electricity and internet.

Despite generating highly valuable and timely findings, this study was not without some
limitations. First, due to limited internet access and online information sources in the country, the
study was based on paper-based self-administered survey that only included government
employees in Addis Ababa, where vulnerable populations and illiterate people were not captured
in the study. Ideally, a randomly selected sample of the public should be interviewed about
COVID-19. Second, due to the threat of pandemic and the social distancing rule, it was not possible
to conduct a face-to-face interview. Third, the data presented in this study are self-reported and
partly dependent on the respondent’s honesty and recall ability, thus they may be subject to recall
and social desirability biases. They also could have been affected by selection bias. Nevertheless,
this study provides valuable information about the knowledge and perception of COVID-19 among
government employees, and the findings can be used to direct specific public health interventions
or messages to the government employees.

Conclusions
The results of this study identified higher knowledge among respondents about COVID-19,
including its mode of transmission, symptoms, incubation period, vulnerable population and
preventive measures. Knowledge and perceptions have great roles in behavioral change and all
efforts should be focused on improving the perceived susceptibility, severity, and benefits of
preventive behavioral changes. Understanding how the public responds to the global pandemic
like COVID-19 is useful in identifying ways of encouraging behavior change during the early
stages of any infectious disease outbreak.
