Abstract:

24

Introduction: Rapid diagnosis and isolation are key to containing the quick spread of a pandemic agent

25

like SARS-CoV-2, which has spread globally since its initial outbreak in Wuhan province in China. SARS-

26

CoV-2 is novel to most parts of the world including USA and the effect on typically prevalent seasonal

27

viruses is just becoming apparent. We present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in

28

the month of March, 2020.

29

Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study post launching of SARS-CoV-2 testing at Baylor Scott and

30

White Hospital (BSWH), Temple TX. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed by real-time rRT-PCR

31

assay and results were shared with State public health officials for immediate interventions.

32

Results: More than 3500 tests were performed during the first two weeks of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and

33

identified 168 (4.7%) positive patients. Sixty-two (3.2%) of the 1,912 ambulatory patients and 106 (6.3%)

34

of the 1,659 ED/inpatients were tested positive. Higher rate of infection (6.9%) were noted in the patients

35

belonging to age group 25-34 years and least number of positive cases were noted in <25 years old (2%)

36

group. The TX State county specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public

37

health departments for epidemiological interventions.

38

Incidentally, this study showed that there was a significant decrease in the occurrence of infections due to

39

seasonal respiratory viruses in this region, perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness, about

40

SARS-CoV-2, among general public. Data extracted for BSWH from the CDC’s National Respiratory and

41

Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) site revealed that Influenza incidence declined to 8.7% in

42

March 2020 compared to 25% in March 2019.

43

Conclusions: This study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and the

44

role of laboratories in crisis management. This study provided SARS-CoV-2 testing data from ambulatory

45

and inpatient population. Epidemiological interventions depend on timely availability of accurate

46

diagnostic tests and throughput capacity of such systems during large outbreaks like SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction:
In December 2019, Wuhan city, the capital of Hubei province in China, became the center of an

51

outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause. By Jan 7, 2020, Chinese scientists had isolated a novel

52

coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously known as 2019-

53

nCoV), from these patients with virus-infected pneumonia.1 Cases have now spread to 190 countries. As

54

of March 23, 2020 there were more than 372,000+ confirmed cases and 16,000+ deaths.2 Although the

55

outbreak is likely to have started from a zoonotic transmission event associated with a large seafood

56

market that also traded in live wild animals, it soon became clear that efficient person-to-person

57

transmission was also occurring.3

58

The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be wide, encompassing asymptomatic

59

infection, mild upper respiratory tract illness, and severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure and

60

even death, with many patients being hospitalized with pneumonia in Wuhan and elsewhere.4 A global

61

pandemic has erupted due to a high proportion of asymptomatic patients coupled with a high degree of

62

viral shedding, long incubation period, and late clinical manifestations. Prolific testing, therefore,

63

remains one of the most effective epidemiological interventions to stop early community spread.

64

Unfortunately, the novelty of SARS-CoV-2 meant that no testing was immediately available making it

65

difficult for public health officials to stay ahead of the pandemic curve.

66
67

As State Public health laboratories became backlogged, Baylor Scott and White hospital system

68

(BSWH) collaborated with the Luminex Corporation (Austin, TX USA) to implement a SARS-CoV-2

69

real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay using the genetic primers

70

previously used in China to help relieve the bottleneck. BSWH laboratory was one of the first laboratories

71

in Texas State to adopt SARS-Co-V2 testing to assist state public health officials for tracing and tracking

72

patients and their immediate contacts. As the pandemic continues to spread across the nation, goal of this

73

study was to share the early clinical trends for COVID-19 in north and central regions of Texas. The aim

74

of this study is to encourage other laboratories to consider an early start to testing during pandemics, share

75

initial trends in this part of the world and possible impact of SARS-CoV-2 on other seasonal respiratory

76

viruses. This report describes the early trends of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the central and north Texas,

77

USA and impact of epidemiological interventions that may have led to the decrease in the incidence of

78

seasonal respiratory virus infections

Methods:

104
105

This study was reviewed and approved by the Baylor Scott and White Health Institutional Review board
(IRB # 344003)

106

Study design and participants:

107

This retrospective cohort study included two cohorts of adult inpatients from Baylor Scott &

108

White Medical Center in Temple (Temple, TX), representing the central Texas region, and various Baylor

109

hospitals in Dallas, TX area, representing north Texas region. For the simplicity, all hospitals within

110

Baylor organization will be referred to as BSW hospitals (BSWH). All adult patients were prescreened

111

according to WHO and BSWH guidelines to be eligible for SARS-CoV-2 testing. Briefly, patients were

112

prescreened on BSWH web portal, phone app and/or through e-visit prior to making appointment for

113

specimen collection at one of the several designated locations. Patients were asked for travel history and

114

any other associated symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath. When clinically indicated,

115

SARS-CoV-2 testing was ordered by the attending physician or by other care providers.

116

As BSWH laboratory continues testing, this study included data from the day testing began on

117

March 11, 2020 and until March 23, 2020. These two hospital systems within BSWH represent central

118

and north Texas population and are limited to these regions of Texas due to community outreach. Study

119

includes data for SARS-CoV-2 testing from these two regions and seasonal respiratory virus testing data is

120

limited to central Texas region.

121

Data collection

122

Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were extracted from electronic

126

Methods for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection were based on rRT-PCR technique

127

approved by FDA (US Federal Drug and Food Administration) under Emergency Use Authorization

128

(EUA)5. Briefly, all BSWH nasopharyngeal specimens were collected either by drive through collection

129

sites or from inpatients using a flocked swab in Universal or Transport Media (Copan Technologies,

130

USA). Specimens were transported at 2 - 8 oC to BSWH (Temple, TX) molecular pathology laboratory

131

for processing and testing with less than 3 hours of transit time. BSWH (Temple, TX) molecular

132

pathology laboratory was responsible for SARS-CoV-2 detection in respiratory specimens by real-time

133

reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) methods (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX

134

USA).

135

The SARS-CoV-2 primers were designed by manufacturer of the assay to detect RNA targets from

136

the SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens from patients as recommended for testing by public health

137

authority guidelines. The method employs two primers for amplifying ORF1 gene and N gene from

138

SARS-CoV-2 virus and the assay includes extraction and internal controls built in the same cartridge.

139

Internal sample processing controls to verify sample lysis, nucleic acid extraction, and proper system and

140

reagent performance are built into each Luminex Extraction Cartridge. Human RNAase P was used as an

141

internal control. Luminex Aries offers true random-access testing, however, increased demand for testing

142

necessitated validation of a similar assay on the Luminex NxTAG platform for batched testing, this

143

method includes additional Envelope (E) gene target for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The Luminex NxTAG

144

platform offers high throughput but on a batched processing using similar primers as Luminex Aries.

145

Both assays had received FDA Emergency Use Authorization prior to submission of this manuscript.

146

Other respiratory virus testing

147

BSWH utilizes respiratory virus syndromic panel, also from Luminex, for the diagnosis of upper

148

respiratory infections. This Luminex NxTAG assay was used as previously described6. The assay detects

149

Influenza A and B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Parainfluenza 1-4, Human metapneumovirus,

150

Rhinovirus/Enterovirus, Adenovirus, Bocavirus, Coronaviruses HKU1, NL63, 229E, OC43,

workstation. In addition, BSWH laboratory uses standalone PCR tests for Influenza and RSV on Roche

155

LIAT system (Roche molecular, Indianapolis, IN USA) or Luminex Aries and the tests performed on

156

these instruments were included in the data analysis for this study. A Chi-square test was used to assess

157

the association between the rate of infection for each virus between 2019 and 2020. Statistical

Results

173

BSWH testing burden during initial periods of community spread

174

BSWH laboratory was one of the first few laboratories in the Texas State to start testing for

175

SARS-CoV-2 using Luminex Aries system. The assay was developed and validated for FDA approval

176

under the Emergency Use Authorization on March 10th, 2020. While BSWH EUA application was under

177

review by FDA manufacturer received FDA EUA on April 03, 2020 before this manuscript was submitted

178

hence BSWH laboratory accepted manufacturer’s performance claims with limited internal verification.

179

The BSWH laboratory started patient testing on March 11, 2020 and supported all the Baylor hospitals in

180

central and north Texas regions. Data presented in figure 1 includes daily test volumes, combined from

181

both Luminex Aries and NxTAG platforms. A total of 3,571 nasopharyngeal specimens were tested until

182

March 23rd, 2020. The north Texas region contributed 1,219 while central Texas region 2,352 specimens.

183

The typical turnaround time for specimen collection to verification of test results was less than 15 hours.

184

SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and age distribution

185

Individuals were delivered a prescreening questionnaire to be eligible for testing through BSWH

186

web portal, phone app and/or through e-visit. The questionnaire focused on current symptoms, travel and

187

other exposure history. Eligible patients were directed to visit one of the drive through collection sites

188

established ad hoc for collection of nasopharyngeal specimen.

189

Patients with specific symptoms visiting emergency department were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and

190

were either discharged while waiting for test results for self-quarantine at home or admitted if clinical

191

findings necessitated. Clinical symptoms and underlying morbidities for limited number of ED/inpatients

192

are presented in Table 1. More than 75% of the patients presented in emergency department had fever and

193

cough.

194
195

A total of 3,571 SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR tests were performed at BSWH laboratory, 1,912
specimens were received from ambulatory and/or drive-through collection sites, and 1,659 from the

196

ED/inpatient. Sixty-two (3.2%) ambulatory patients were tested positive, as did 106 (6.3%) ED/inpatient

197

population, noted in Figures 4 and 5, respectively.

198

BSWH initial trends indicated a marked increase in the number of positive cases in the 25 years

199

to 34 years age group (7.4%) followed by 6.9% in 55 years to 64 years age group. Data presented here

200

indicated a lower incidence (2%) among the <25 years old (Figure 4).

201

Number of confirmed cases per specific county in north and central Texas, USA

202

An appropriate epidemiological intervention requires identification of patient demographics for

203

public health officials to track and trace positive cases. Therefore, it is prudent that SARS-CoV-2 testing

204

laboratories work closely with local epidemiologists for effective communication of test results. BSWH

205

had previously built an electronic bridge with Texas Department of State Health Services for instant

206

communication of all notifiable conditions. SARS-CoV-2 results were added to this electronic health

207

reporting system for an efficient communication to state epidemiologists.

208

Major metro areas, both in central and north Texas, witnessed an increased number of positive

209

cases. Dallas county (north Texas) and Travis county (central Texas) had maximum number of positive

210

cases while this manuscript was under preparation (Figure 5).

211

COVID-19 impact on other circulating respiratory viruses

212

As local, state, and national epidemiologic countermeasures were enacted, this study observed an

213

interesting correlation between SARS-CoV-2 positive cases and the incidence of other seasonal circulating

214

respiratory viruses during the same timeframe. Data extracted for BSWH from the CDC’s National

215

Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) site revealed that Influenza incidence

216

declined to 8.7% in March 2020 compared to 25% in March 2019 (p-<0.0001). This declining trend over

217

the last few weeks coincides with sharp uptick in the SARS-CoV-2 incidence. This study also observed

218

that Bocavirus and Parainfluenza virus infections were significantly down in March, 2020 compared to

219

March, 2019 (p-<0.05). Authors did not note a similar decline in Adenovirus, common cold Coronavirus,

Discussion
The SARS-CoV-2 literature is evolving at breakneck pace, but there is a paucity of literature

229

detailing in-house testing solutions to combat the national delays in turn-around time or the shortages of

230

testing kits available. As real-time rRT-PCR is already widely deployed in diagnostic virology

231

laboratories, this study recommends any institution with molecular testing capabilities consider

232

proactively reaching out to manufacturers to improve testing capabilities and turn-around time. In the race

233

against this pandemic, real-time data empower epidemiologists and public health officials to identify,

234

track, and contain spread as much as possible. Integrating laboratory-based reporting with epidemiologic

235

surveillance registers will only further improve public health outcomes.

236

The intent of this study was not to assess the performance characters of the rRT-PCR assay for

237

the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Authors are of the opinion that accurate determination of test

238

performance characters will require appropriate distribution of cohorts among the general population

239

especially in the context of virus shedding, transmission dynamics, asymptomatic carriage and specimen

240

requirements are still being debated and investigated. SARS-CoV-2 has exhibited great degree of plasticity

241

in all of the above characters hence it may take additional time and understanding to determine the

242

performance characters of the assay.

243

The literature data available at the time of the emergency were few for most USA healthcare

244

systems and above all stemming from the only experience available on the outbreak from COVID 2019.

245

The only country with published data and epidemiological or management studies was represented by the

246

Chinese outbreak.7 However, the health system and the Chinese government represent a very different

247

model from the USA reality where healthcare is regional and private for most part, which enjoys

248

significant autonomy such as the possibilities available to try to improve and optimize diagnosis,

249

management and partnership with public health officials. In this context, BSWH ramped up efforts in

250

laboratory diagnosis and collegial collaboration with public health officials for effective epidemiological

251

interventions.

252

Because SARS-CoV-2 infection symptoms range from unspecific mild respiratory symptoms to

253

acute respiratory distress4 and because these symptoms are very similar to those of many seasonal

254

viruses,8 BSWH laboratory implemented an outpatient screening protocols hosted on BSWH web portal

255

for appointments, phone app and e-visit sites for appropriate prescreening of individuals for targeted

256

laboratory testing.

257

Real-time rRT-PCR testing for various other infections is widely deployed in most diagnostic

258

laboratories. In the case of a public health emergency, proficient diagnostic laboratories can rely on this

259

robust technology to establish new diagnostic tests within their routine services before pre-formulated

260

assays become available. In addition to information on reagents, oligonucleotides and positive controls,

261

laboratories working under quality control programs need to rely on documentation of technical

262

qualification of the assay formulation as well as data from external clinical evaluation tests.8, 9 Everything

263

listed above can be true for a laboratory-developed test, however, if commercial manufacturers design

264

assays under FDA watch then all of the above requirements can be mitigated. The available genome

265

sequence of SARS-CoV-2 has enabled several diagnostic kit manufacturers to design their primer sets for

266

real-time rRT-PCR diagnostic test builds11 in addition to other respiratory pathogens testing.

267

BSWH worked diligently with Luminex Corporation to adopt and submit an FDA emergency use

268

authorization application of their assay for BSWH healthcare system during early phases of community

269

spread in Texas State. This early adoption of rRT-PCR assay led to improved turnaround times of SARS-

270

CoV-2 test results, reduced testing burden of public health laboratory, and won praise from the local

271

public health officials for efficient communication of test results for appropriate interventions.

272

To best of authors’ knowledge, this is the first report on SARS-CoV-2 testing from this part of the

273

world. BSWH laboratory would like to share this information with our readers and other laboratories that

274

early adoption of testing for pandemic diseases like COVD-19 has long-term implications in management

275

and control measures. BSWH laboratory provided test results data on both ambulatory and inpatient

276

population, and shared patient demographics with local public health officials.

277

This study provided limited insights into clinical manifestations of patient who either reported to

278

emergency department or admitted for further evaluations. Major symptoms included were fever and

279

cough, more than 75% of the patients reported to have these symptoms. Khuwara et al12 reported similar

280

findings in Wuhan outbreak, reporting greater than 90% and 75% of the patients exhibiting fever and

281

cough, respectively.

282

Interestingly, data mining did not yield any co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 unlike Stanford

283

Medicine data13. This study attributes the initial trend of not finding co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 to

284

limited concurrent test ordering for other respiratory viruses in an ambulatory setting. A generic notion of

285

prohibitive cost of respiratory syndromic panels may have led to the limited ordering in outpatient testing.

286

The coronavirus disease 2019 has rapidly spread around the world, posing enormous health,

287

economic, and social challenges to societies. As there are no proven drug and vaccine treatments,14 non-

288

pharmaceutical measures are essential to slow the spread of the epidemic.15 Social distancing (e.g.,

289

cancellation of large gathering, school closures) is an essential part of public health measure for infection

290

control.15 In line with this, many social events and activities have been cancelled or scaled-down in many

291

countries including Japan,2 wherein there is already a high number of reported COVID-19 cases.

292

This study demonstrated and incidental correlation of decline in the other respiratory viruses such

293

as Influenza viruses typically circulating during this time of the year. This observation may be merely

294

coincidental, however, this study hypothesized that the general epidemiological measures such as social

295

distancing, cancellation of large gatherings and in general population is being extra-careful in preventing

296

SARS-CoV-2 infection may have led to the decrease in Influenza cases compared to what BSWH

297

laboratory witnessed last year around the same period of time. This study must not be intended to draw

298

any definitive conclusion on this fact, especially when data for 2019-2020 flu vaccine effectiveness is still

299

evolving.

Conclusion
This study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and how

303

laboratories are required to be part of the crisis management. This study demonstrated that proactive

304

collaboration with assay manufacturers would enable laboratories to be prepared for emerging diseases

305

like COVID-19. Epidemiological interventions depend on availability of accurate diagnostic tests and

306

throughput capacity of such system during large outbreaks like SARS-CoV-2. It is also important to have a

307

well-organized plan to report the test results to public health officials to initiate counter measures to

308

control the infections. It is also imperative to build a diagnostic algorithm to include testing for other

309

seasonal respiratory viruses, especially most common viruses like Influenza and RSV, which may require

310

medical attention.

Fig 6. Decline in seasonal influenza cases. Following the enactment of epidemiological interventions by

381

the state of Texas, large gatherings were banned and public practicing social distancing may have led to

382

the decrease in the number of Influenza positive cases. Data shown are from March 2019 and March 2020

383

for percent positive test results for each virus target. A Chi-square test was used to assess the association

384

between the rate of infection for each virus between 2019 and 2020. Statistical significance was set at p-

385

value<0.05.
