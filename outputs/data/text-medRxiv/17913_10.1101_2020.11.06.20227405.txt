Abstract
Objectives To assess whether gout and / or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are risk factors for
coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) diagnosis. To assess whether gout and / or RA are risk
factors for death with COVID-19.
Methods We used data from the UK Biobank. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression was
employed in the following analyses: Analysis A, to test for association between gout or RA and
COVID-19 diagnosis (n=473,139); Analysis B, to test for association between gout or RA and
death with COVID-19 in a case-control cohort of people who died or survived with COVID-19
(n=2,059); Analysis C, to test for association with gout or RA and death with COVID-19 in the
entire UK Biobank cohort (n=473,139)
Results RA, but not gout, associated with COVID-19 diagnosis in analysis A. Neither RA nor
gout associated with risk of death in the COVID-19-diagnosed group in analysis B. However RA
associated with risk of death related to COVID-19 using the UK Biobank cohort in analysis C
independent of comorbidities and other measured risk factors (OR=1.9 [95% CI 1.2 ; 3.0]). Gout
was not associated with death related to COVID-19 in the same UK Biobank analysis (OR=1.2
[95% CI 0.8 ; 1.7]).
Conclusion Rheumatoid arthritis is a risk factor for death with COVID-19 using the UK
Biobank cohort. These findings require replication in larger data sets that also allow inclusion of
a wider range of factors.

Key messages
Information on the risk of death from COVID-19 for people with gout and rheumatoid arthritis is
scarce.
In an analysis of the UK Biobank there is an increased risk of death related to COVID-19 for
people with rheumatoid arthritis independent of included co-morbidities, but not gout.
The findings need to be replicated in other datasets where the influence of therapies for
rheumatoid arthritis can be tested.

Background
Data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes for people with the two most common
inflammatory arthropathies, gout and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are scarce. An international
registry study of 600 people with rheumatic diseases did not report any data on association of
gout with hospitalisation, owing to the small number of people with gout included (1). In the
same study, people with RA did not have a different risk of hospitalisation compared to other
rheumatic diseases (1). In the OpenSAFELY study (2) that compared risk factors for 10,926
people who died from COVID-19 to the general population in the UK, RA was pooled with
systemic lupus erythematosus and psoriasis, this combined group had a hazard ratio of 1.2 [95%
CI: 1.1;1.3] for death. However gout was not examined in the OpenSAFELY study. A
population-based study in Denmark reported a hazard ratio of 1.4 [0.8 ; 2.5] for an outcome of
mechanical ventilation or severe respiratory disease or death with COVID-19 in people with RA
(3). In a US study comparing people with COVID-19 with systemic autoimmune rheumatic
diseases, of whom 45% had RA, to people with COVID-19 without these diseases there was
increased risk of hospitalisation and admission to intensive care but not increased risk of death
(4). A Spanish study reported no evidence for association of chronic inflammatory arthritis (48%
with RA) with poor outcome in people with COVID-19 (5).
Gout is caused by an exuberant auto-inflammatory interleukin-1b-driven innate immune system
response to monosodium urate crystals (6). Theoretically this has the potential to lead to an
increased immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Poorer COVID-19 outcomes have been associated with high serum levels of IL-6, IL-8 and
TNF-a (7), raising the possibility that people with gout might be at risk of a poor outcome due to
the fact that they also have higher circulating levels of these factors (8). Gout is also strongly
associated with cardiometabolic co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes, kidney disease and heart
disease (9), all established risk factors for COVID-19-related mortality (2). Gout medications
may also influence outcomes following the development of COVID-19: two randomised control
trials of colchicine, which is widely used as prophylaxis and treatment for the gout flare (10),
reported better clinical outcomes including a shorter time in hospital and shorter duration
requiring supplemental oxygen in people hospitalised with COVID-19 in those randomised to

colchicine (11,12). There is also non-randomised evidence of the efficacy of colchicine in
COVID-19 in a small case-control study (13).
Rheumatoid arthritis is a T-cell and B-cell mediated autoimmune disease that primarily affects
the joints but also includes systemic manifestations. Like gout, RA is an independent risk factor
for cardiovascular disease (14). The profile of RA includes increased levels of pro-inflammatory
cytokines TNF-a and IL-6 (15), a similar profile to COVID-19 (16), with the potential to lead to
an increased immune response to infection by SARS-CoV-2.
The aim of this study was to determine if gout and RA are risk factors for COVID-19 diagnosis
or death with COVID-19.

Participants and methods
Data availability
This research was conducted using the UK Biobank Resource (approval number 12611). The UK
Biobank is a large resource of nearly 500,000 volunteers aged 49-86 years of age at recruitment.
Recruitment began 2006 with follow-up for at least 30-years (17). SARS-CoV-2 test
information, ICD-10 hospital codes, death records and general practice prescription information
were obtained via the UK Biobank data portal on the 16th of September 2020. This information
covered hospital diagnoses between 1991 and 30th June 2020, SARS-CoV-2 tests between 16th
March and 24th August 2020, and death records up until 14th August 2020.
Gout, RA and COVID-19 definitions and case-control datasets
The criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis was defined as participants with 1) a positive SARS-CoV-2
test and / or 2) ICD-10 code for confirmed COVID-19 (U07.1) or probable COVID-19 (U07.2)
in hospital records, or death records (Figure 1). This definition resulted in identification of 2,118
individuals who were further divided into those that died (n=457) based on death records and
those that were known to survive (n = 1,602). Fifty-nine participants who were diagnosed after
26th July 2020 (28 days before the last recorded death) were removed from the cohort used in
Analysis B (below) given the unknown outcome in these individuals. Gout was ascertained by a
previously validated gout definition using the following criteria: self-reported gout (visits 0-2);
taking allopurinol or sulphinpyrazone therapy either by self-report or from linked general
practice scripts (excluding those who also had hospital diagnosed lymphoma or leukemia ICD10
C81 - C96); or hospital-diagnosed gout (ICD-10 code M10) (18), this case definition has been
validated (18,19). The gout case-control cohort (n = 473,139) consists of 13,105 cases (gout) and
460,034 controls (non-gout). RA affection was ascertained using a combination of self-report of
RA at more than one study visit, hospital recorded RA (ICD-10 code M05 - M06) on more than
one occasion, or a self-report of RA at recruitment and at least one hospital record of RA. The
RA cohort (n = 473,139) consists of 5,409 people with and 467,730 people without RA. For the
RA and gout cohorts we developed three case-control datasets to test for association with the
following outcomes:

Dataset A (Analysis A) to test for association with COVID-19 diagnosis in a population-based
cohort. There were 2,118 cases and 471,021 controls.
Dataset B (Analysis B) to test for association with death from COVID-19 in people with
COVID-19. There were 457 people diagnosed with COVID-19 who died and 1,602 people
diagnosed with COVID-19 who survived.
Dataset C (Analysis C) to test for association with death related to COVID-19 in a populationbased cohort. There were 457 people diagnosed with COVID-19 who died and 472,682 others
that included 1,616 people diagnosed with COVID-19 not known to have died.
Ethnicity, age and comorbidity data
Self-reported ethnicity was grouped into White British (British, Irish, White, Any other white
background), Black British (African, White and Black African, Black or Black British,
Caribbean, White and Black Caribbean, Any other Black background), Asian British (Asian or
Asian British, Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, White and Asian, Any other Asian
background), and Other (Other ethnic group, Mixed, Any other mixed background, Do not know,
Prefer not to answer). Age was calculated for 2020 from year of birth. The ICD-10 hospital
codes used to determine additional comorbidity status were: C00 – C96 (cancer), D80 - D89
(immunodeficiencies), E08 - E13 (diabetes mellitus), E78 (disorders of lipoprotein metabolism
and other lipidemias), F01-F03 (dementia), I10 - I15 (hypertensive diseases), I60 - I69
(cerebrovascular diseases), I20 - I25 (ischemic heart diseases), I26 - I28 (pulmonary heart
disease), I50 (heart failure), J44 (chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases), J45 (asthma), M19.9
(osteoarthritis) and N18 (chronic kidney disease).
Statistical analysis
All association analyses were done using R v4.0.2 in RStudio 1.2.5019. Age groups used in the
analysis were <60 years (n= 89,607), 60-69 years (n= 151,139), 70-74 years (n=110,159) and
>74 years (n= 122,222). Two models were used: adjustment with age group, sex, ethnicity,
Townsend deprivation index, BMI, smoking status (Model 1); and Model 1 plus adjustment by

Results
Association with diagnosis of COVID-19
Results from the association analyses of gout and RA with COVID-19 diagnosis (Analysis A)
using Model 1 (adjustment by current age, sex, Townsend deprivation index, ethnicity groups,
body mass index and smoking status) are presented in Table 2. Both gout and RA associated
with an increased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis of 1.5-fold [95% CI: 1.2 ; 1.8] and 2.2-fold [1.7 ;
2.9], respectively. We also included in our study other diseases known to be risk factors for poor
COVID-19 outcome (2) both for comparison of effect sizes and inclusion in models as potential
confounders. In comparison, data for cerebrovascular diseases were (OR 4.7 [4.1 ; 5.3]), heart
failure (OR 4.0 [3.5 ; 4.7]), chronic kidney disease (OR 3.7 [3.3 ; 4.3]), pulmonary heart disease
(OR 3.4 [2.8 ; 4.1]), immunodeficiencies (OR 3.3 [2.2 ; 4.7]) and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disorders (OR 3.1 [2.7 ; 3.6]). Two to three-fold increases in risk were estimated for hypertensive
diseases (OR 2.4 [2.2 ; 2.7]), diabetes mellitus (OR 2.4 [2.1 ; 2.7]), and lipoprotein disorders (OR
2.1 [1.9 ; 2.4]). One to two-fold increases in risk were estimated for ischemic heart diseases (OR
2.0 [1.7 ; 2.2]), cancer (OR 1.7 [1.6 ; 1.9]), asthma (OR 1.6 [1.4 ; 1.8]), osteoarthritis (OR 1.5
[1.4 ; 1.7]), and dementia strongly associated with COVID-19 (OR 18.2 [15.5 ; 21.4]). After
adjustment by Model 1 variables and the additional 15 co-morbidities evaluated (Model 2), gout
no longer associated with COVID-19 diagnosis, nor did ischemic heart disease, asthma and
osteoarthritis (Table 3). RA maintained nominal association (OR 1.3 [1.0 ; 1.8]). Age was
associated with decreased risk of COVID-19 diagnosis (OR 0.54 [0.47 ; 0.61], OR 0.45 [0.39 ;
0.53], OR 0.60 [0.52 ; 0.69] for 60-69 yrs, 70-74 yrs and >74 years, respectively, when compared
to <60 yrs (Table 3). This decreased risk may reflect a number of factors that influence exposure
to SARS-CoV-2 in this age group, including public health messaging around limiting exposure
for older people.
Associations with death upon diagnosis of COVID-19
When testing for association with death related to COVID-19 within the cohort with COVID-19
diagnosis (Analysis B), there was no evidence for association with gout or RA in either of
Models 1 or 2 (Tables 2 and 3). For other diseases there was association with
immunodeficiencies OR 3.4 [1.5 ; 7.8] (Model 1) and OR=3.6 [1.6 ; 8.4] (Model 2). Established
risk factors for death from COVID-19, namely male sex and older age, were associated with

death (OR 1.4 [1.1 ; 1.9] for males and, compared to <60 yrs, OR 3.6 [2.0 ; 6.6] for 60-69 yrs,
OR 9.4 [5.2 ; 17.0] for 70-74 yrs, OR 16.3 [ 9.2 ; 28.9] for >74 yrs) (Table 3).
We then tested for association with death related to COVID-19 comparing to the entire UK
Biobank cohort (Analysis C). Gout was associated with a 1.7-fold increase [95% CI: 1.2 ; 2.4] in
COVID-19-related death under Model 1 but not in Model 2 (OR 1.2 [0.8 ; 1.7]). In contrast, RA
associated with increased risk of death with COVID-19 in both models – OR 3.2 [2.1 ; 5.0] in
Model 1 and OR 1.9 [1.2 ; 3.0] in Model 2. Given association of sex with prevalence of comorbidity in gout and RA (20-23) sex-specific analyses were performed. In RA the data were
OR 2.9 [1.5 ; 5.7] for males and OR 3.5 [1.9 ; 6.4] for females in Model 1, and OR 1.5 [0.7 ; 3.1]
and OR 2.0 [1.0 ; 3.7], respectively, in Model 2. In gout the data were OR 1.5 [1.1 ; 2.2] for
males and OR 3.2 [1.6 ; 6.4] for females under Model 1, and OR 1.2 [0.8 ; 1.7] for males and OR
1.7 [0.9 ; 3.5] for females.
In Analysis C, we also assessed the 14 additional diseases for association with death from
COVID-19 comparing to the entire UK Biobank cohort. Dementia, immunodeficiencies, chronic
obstructive pulmonary diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, heart failure, pulmonary heart disease,
chronic kidney disease, hypertensive diseases, diabetes mellitus, and cancer all associated with
additional risk of death in Model 2 (Table 3), with dementia and immunodeficiencies having the
strongest effects (OR 10.2 [7.6 ; 13.6] and 4.6 [2.6 ; 8.0], respectively). In Model 2, people of
Black British ancestry had the highest risk of death (OR 2.7 [1.7 ; 4.3]), compared to people of
White British ancestry, and there was positive association of death with BMI (OR = 1.03 [1.01 ;
1.05] per unit increase in BMI), and with an increased Townsend deprivation index score
(OR=1.07 [1.04 ; 1.10]), consistent with a higher prevalence of seroprevalence of SARS-Cov-2
infection in people living in more deprived areas in the UK (24). Ex-smokers were at an
increased risk of death with COVID-19 in model 2 (OR=1.7 [1.3 ; 2.3]) compared with neversmokers, consistent with the OpenSAFELY data from the UK (2), although directionality of
association was different to the OpenSAFELY data for current smokers (OR=1.3 [1.0 ; 1.6]).
Age group was also associated with death; OR 2.0 [1.1 ; 3.5] for 60-69 yrs, OR 3.7 [2.1 ; 6.5] 70
to 74 yrs, OR 7.3 [4.3 ; 12.5] for >74 yrs when compared to <60 yrs.

Discussion
We identified RA as a risk factor for death related to COVID-19 in a multivariable-adjusted
analysis of the UK Biobank cohort. Of clinical relevance, given implication of the type 1
interferon response in biologic therapy in RA (25), is involvement of a type 1 interferonmediated immune response in people who die from COVID-19 (26), including in people with
mutations in regulatory genes (27). It is important that the findings presented here are replicated
in larger administrative datasets (eg. US-based National COVID Cohort Collaborative
(www.ncats.nih.gov/n3c) and the UK OpenSAFELY cohort (2)). These datasets would allow for
more stratification and use of additional models to fully explore factors including medications
that might influence the observed association with RA. For example, the OpenSAFELY study
included 962 individuals who died with COVID-19 who also had RA or SLE or psoriasis (2) –
the number of people with RA in this group is likely to be at least 10-fold greater than in the UK
Biobank data set used here. If the association we report here were replicated, investigation of the
reasons for the relationship between RA and death from COVID-19 would improve
understanding and potentially improve clinical management of COVID-19.
There are limitations to our analyses. Firstly, these analyses pertain to the population from which
the UK Biobank was derived, predominantly the white European middle-aged ethnic group of
the United Kingdom, and are not necessarily generalisable to other ethnic groups or other white
European ethnic groups. There is also no available information on recovery status so there is the
possibility of additional unidentified deaths in the COVID-19 diagnosed group in Analysis B. In
addition to this COVID-19 outcomes will have been influenced over the time period of this study
(March-August 2020) as clinical treatments evolved. General practice prescriptions were only
available up until August 2019 and could not reliably be used to determine current medication
usage. Thus the effect of anti-rheumatic treatments, particularly biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, could not be assessed in this study. Nor could the potential effect of disease
activity in RA be assessed. Limited testing outside of the hospital settings means that the full
extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not known in this population. Thus, it is not possible to
accurately compare asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 to those with more severe disease. The UK
Biobank dataset is also limited to those aged 49 to 86 as of 2020, a demographic with a higher
infection fatality ratio (28). This will have contributed to the inflated infection fatality ratio in the

UK Biobank cohort of 22%, well above general population estimates of 0.5 to 1.5% (e.g. (29)),
in addition to a greater proportion of cases ascertained earlier in the pandemic by hospitalisation
aligned with insufficient testing capability to detect community and mild cases (30,31).
Therefore our findings cannot be generalised to those under 50 years of age. There is the
potential in Analysis B for index event (collider) bias resulting from conditioning the sample set
on COVID-19 diagnosis which would serve to bias towards the null (32). With respect to the
lack of association of established risk factors for adverse COVID-19 outcomes (e.g. dementia)
with death, the increased ascertainment of cases through hospitalisation earlier in the pandemic
would also have contributed to bias towards the null in Analysis B. However these limitations
were addressed using the entire cohort-based approach in Analysis C. We did not account for
increased risk of death in RA for non-COVID-19-related causes which may have contributed to
the OR of 1.80 (Table 3). However any inflation would have been countered by adjustment for
multiple co-morbid conditions in Analysis C. A final limitation is that, while our method of
ascertainment of gout in the UK Biobank has been validated (18), this is not the case for RA.
In summary, we found evidence for an effect of RA on the risk of death with COVID-19
independent of included comorbidities and known risk factors. This needs to be further explored
in large datasets where a range of other factors can be investigated (e.g. RA therapies).
