Abstract
The evaluated SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid fluorescence immunoassays reliably identified

19

patients within the first 5 days of symptom onset, when respiratory secretions carried high viral

20

loads. This high performance suggests that these tests might play an important role for future

21

PCR-independent strategies to detect early or infective cases.

Introduction
Since its emergence in 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in over 30 million

26

confirmed cases and almost 1 million deaths worldwide, as of September 2020

27

(https://covid19.who.int). Early detection of cases by highly sensitive and specific real-time

28

reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the currently recommended

29

diagnostic strategy [1]. However, the high cost of RT-PCR, shortage of reagents, and need for

30

trained personnel have limited the testing capacities of laboratories to provide results in a timely

31

manner [2]. Thus, alternative diagnostic tools allowing the fast testing of large numbers of

32

samples are of high priority [3]. In addition, new aspects of SARS-CoV-2 testing include the

33

ability to evaluate infectivity to help tailor control measures of known or suspected Covid-19

34

cases [4].

35

Rapid antigen detection tests (Ag-RDT) using immunochromatographic tests (ICT) or

36

fluorescent immunoassays (FIA) have recently become available; many of which are CE-IVD

37

licensed and some have received FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) [5]. As previously

38

suggested, FIAs are highly specific and can reach remarkably high sensitivities, if applied in

39

samples from early phases of infection or with high viral loads [6,7]. Here we present the

40

performance of two novel FIA automated antigen detection systems in samples from Covid-19

41

patients presenting within 5 days of symptom onset.

Material and methods
Samples derived from patients attending Clínica Alemana in Santiago, Chile, for Covid-

45

19 testing. Specimens consisted of naso-oropharyngeal flocked swabs obtained by trained

46

personnel and placed in universal transport media (UTM-RT® System, Copan Diagnostics,

Murrieta, CA, USA). Samples were examined for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR assay

48

(COVID-19 Genesig®, Primerdesign Ltd., Chander´s Ford, UK). Samples exhibiting exponential

49

amplification curves and cycle thresholds (Ct) values ≤40 were considered positive.

50

RT-PCR characterized UTM samples were aliquoted and kept at -80° C until analysis by

51

the two FIA kits, “SOFIA SARS Antigen FIA” (Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA, USA) and

52

“STANDARD® F COVID-19 Ag FIA” (SD Biosensor Inc., Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea).

53

Both tests detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein by lateral flow immunofluorescence, which

54

is interpreted by automated analysers (SOFIA 2, Quidel Corporation; F2400, SD Biosensor Inc.).

55

Both kits are CE-IVD labelled; Quidel recently received FDA EUA. Manufacturers state that

56

both tests should be performed using nasopharyngeal swabs collected from symptomatic

57

individuals within 5 days of symptom onset. The use of samples stored in certain brands of

58

transport media (including Copan UTM) is permitted for the SD Biosensor assay; the Quidel test

59

initially also allowed using UTM, but a recent instruction update discourages the use of

60

prediluted samples [8].

61

For the evaluation, 32 RT-PCR positive UTM samples, all collected within the first 5

62

days after symptom onset, and 32 negative specimens were selected. All positive samples were

63

from symptomatic patients, 12 negative samples were from asymptomatic patients screened

64

before surgery. Some of the positive (n = 27) and negative samples (n = 19) had been used in a

65

previous evaluation [7]. Assays were performed using the same sample aliquot, following

66

manufacturers´ instructions, by the same laboratory personnel, who were blinded to RT-PCR

67

results. In brief, specimens were mixed with an extraction reagent, dispensed into the cassette´s

68

sample well, and read after incubation by an instrument. All procedures, except the reading, were

69

performed under a BSL2 cabinet. Results were compared to those of RT-PCR as reference

method; in case of discordant results, tests were repeated. Demographic and clinical data were

71

obtained from mandatory notification forms and analysed in an anonymized manner. Statistical

72

analysis considered the calculation of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy using standard

73

formulas, and Wilson score Confidence Interval at 95% (OpenEpi version 3.01). Test

74

performance was evaluated for all samples and for those with high viral loads (Ct ≤25), as

75

previously described [9]. Kits and analysers were provided by manufacturers at reduced costs for

76

evaluation purposes. The study was approved by the institutional review board (Comité Etico

77

Científico, Facultad de Medicina Clínica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile)

78

and a waiver of informed consent was granted.

Results

81

The study included a total of 64 samples, 32 were RT-PCR positive and 32 RT-PCR

82

negative. The median age was 39 years (IQR 36.7-57) and 52% were male. Median days from

83

symptom onset to RT-PCR testing of positive and negative cases were 2 (IQR 1-3) and 1 (IQR

84

0.75-4), respectively. Ct values had a median of 17.95 (IQR, 16.4-22.4); 29/32 samples (90.6%)

85

had a Ct ≤25.

86

Both assays demonstrated an overall sensitivity >90%, reaching 100% for samples with

87

high viral loads (Table 1). False negative results were observed with the Quidel and SD

88

Biosensor assays in two and three samples, respectively, which had Cts of 30.89 to 32.57 and

89

were taken on the fourth or fifth day after symptom onset. Specificity was 96.7% for both tests,

90

i.e. both kits displayed a single false positive result, from two distinct symptomatic RT-PCT

91

negative cases. Both assays were user friendly, included ready-to-use reagents and required little

92

hands-on time. Moreover, analysers were easy-to-use, stored the results, and included options for

93

QR coding, printing, and connection to laboratory information systems.

Discussion

95

At present, RT-PCR is the recommended diagnostic method in patients with

96

suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection [1]. However, material shortages and laboratory capacity

97

limitations, especially during high transmission situations, have caused significant problems and

98

led to the emergence of various new PCR-independent diagnostics [10]. Antigen-based assays

99

are among the most recent developments, but peer-reviewed evaluations of their diagnostic

100

performance are scarce. Hence, their role within the routine diagnostic workup is yet not defined

101

[9,11]. Since antigen detection per se has a lower sensitivity than RT-PCR, it will most likely not

102

replace it [9]. However, the results of this and former studies indicate that antigen detection by

103

immunofluorescence, especially when used with an automated reader, has an excellent

104

sensitivity to detect SARS-CoV-2 in samples with estimated viral loads above ~106 copies/mL

105

(Ct values ≤25) [9], which are found in pre-symptomatic (1-3 days before symptom onset) and

106

early symptomatic Covid-19 cases (5-7 days after symptom onset) [9,12-14]. According to recent

107

modelling studies, elevated viral titers are associated to infectivity [15]. This is in accordance

108

with in vitro experiments, which showed no viral growth from samples with Cts >24 or taken >8

109

days after symptom onset [16,17]. A viral load of 106 copies/mL has therefore been suggested as

110

the limit of infectivity for clinical practice [18]. However, until the exact threshold of

111

contagiousness is known, other authors have considered a more conservative approach (1,000

112

copies/mL) [19].

113

For samples with high viral loads both evaluated tests were 100% sensitive. In our panel

114

of positive samples, false negatives only occurred with Cts >30, which translates to viral loads

115

<104 for the used RT-PCR protocol [20], although this finding has to be confirmed with a larger

116

number of specimens. The high-performance value coincides with recent studies of a similar FIA

117

with automated reading (BioEasy), which demonstrated sensitivities of 100% for samples with

118

Cts ≤25 [6,7] and of 98% for samples with Cts ≤30 [21]. In contrast, immunochromatographic

119

SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests demonstrated lower sensitivity values of 74%-85% for samples with

120

Cts ≤25 [7,22,23].

121

Although additional studies with larger numbers of samples are needed, the excellent

122

performance data of FIA Ag-RDTs suggest their potential use in the following scenarios, when

123

RT-PCR is unavailable or impractical: 1) closed or semi-closed remote communities such as

124

cruise ships or military camps [9], 2) High-risk congregate facilities including schools, care-

125

homes, dormitories, etc., when testing daily or every other day could reduce secondary infections

126

by 100% or 90%, respectively [24], and 3) screening of asymptomatic attendees at potential

127

superspreader events, like conferences, weddings, and sports or cultural events. In the future, due

128

to their high sensitivity to detect infective patients, FIA Ag-RDTs might also play an important

129

role within “test-out” strategies, i.e. the early release of suspected cases from self-isolation or

130

shortening quarantine for proven cases.
