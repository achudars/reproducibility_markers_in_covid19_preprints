ABSTRACT
Patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) are at high risk for fibrin-based occlusion of
vascular beds of all sizes. Although endothelial cell activation has regularly been described as
part of the COVID-19 thrombo-inflammatory storm, the upstream mediators of this activation
have yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we began by pursuing the hypothesis that circulating
factors such as neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) remnants, D-dimer, or C-reactive protein
might predict the COVID-19 serum samples (n=118) that most robustly activated cultured
endothelial cells. Indeed, we found modest correlations between serum NET remnants (cell-free
DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes, citrullinated histone H3) and upregulation of surface Eselectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 on endothelial cells. However, a more robust predictor of the
ability of COVID-19 serum to activate endothelial cells was the presence of circulating
antiphospholipid antibodies, specifically anticardiolipin IgG and IgM and antiphosphatidlyserine/prothrombin (anti-PS/PT) IgG and IgM. Depletion of total IgG from
anticardiolipin-high and anti-PS/PT-high samples markedly restrained upregulation of E-selectin,
VCAM-1, and ICAM-1. At the same time, supplementation of control serum with patient IgG was
sufficient to trigger endothelial cell activation. These data are the first to reveal that patient
antibodies are a driver of endothelial cell activation and add important context regarding
thrombo-inflammatory effects of COVID-19 autoantibodies in severe COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
Derangements in coagulation correlate with COVID-19 severity (1, 2). Indeed, there are now
myriad reports demonstrating the high risk of both venous thromboembolism (3, 4) and arterial
thrombosis including strokes and myocardial infarctions (4, 5) in patients with COVID-19.
Furthermore, histopathology of autopsy brain and lung specimens from patients with severe
disease demonstrate dysfunctional endothelium and fibrin-based occlusion of small vessels (69). There are several (possibly synergistic) mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may
result in macrovascular and microvascular thrombosis (10) including a cytokine storm that
activates leukocytes, endothelium, and platelets; direct activation of various cells by viral
infection; and high levels of intravascular neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (11, 12). The
latter are inflammatory cell remnants that amplify thrombosis (13-16).

In recent months, there have been a number of descriptions of what appears to be a priori
autoantibody formation in individuals with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. One example
replicated by multiple groups is the detection of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL Abs), which
mediate antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) in the general population (17). In APS, patients form
durable autoantibodies to phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins such as prothrombin
and beta-2-glycoprotein I. These autoantibodies then engage cell surfaces, where they activate
endothelial cells, platelets, and neutrophils (18, 19) and thereby tip the blood-endothelium
interface toward thrombosis. Case reports and case series have suggested a link between
COVID-19 disease severity, circulating aPL Abs, and thrombotic events (20-25). While viral
infections have long been known to trigger transient aPL Abs (26-29), mechanisms by which
these short-lived antibodies may be pathogenic have never been characterized. To this end, our
group recently found that COVID-19 IgG fractions enriched for aPL Abs potently activate
neutrophils in vitro, while also potentiating thrombosis when injected into mice (30).

Beyond aPL Abs, autoantibodies against the type I interferon response (31, 32) and platelets
(33) have been described in moderate-to-severe COVID-19, with both demonstrating potentially
important functional properties in vitro. At the same time, the circulating B cell compartment of
COVID-19 appears reminiscent of the autoimmune disease lupus whereby naïve B cells rapidly
take an extrafollicular route to becoming antibody-producing cells (34, 35), and in doing so
bypass the normal tolerance checkpoints against autoimmunity provided by the germinal center.

Here, we were interested in the extent to which circulating NET remnants might be an important
activator of endothelial cells. We also necessarily turned our attention to aPL Abs as markers of
COVID-19 serum with strong endothelial cell activating-potential.

RESULTS
Activation of HUVEC by COVID-19 serum. Serum samples were collected from 118 patients
hospitalized with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 at an academic hospital. The average age was
62, while 47% were female and 42% were Black/African American (Supplemental Table 1);
35% were receiving mechanical ventilation, while 74% required supplemental oxygen support of
any kind. Serum from the COVID-19 patients was diluted to 2.5% in culture media and then
added to early-passage human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (Figure 1A). The
expression of surface activation markers was determined after 6 hours by a custom in-cell
ELISA compatible with the Biosafety Level-3 facility in which the experiments were performed
(Figure 1A). As compared with serum samples from 40 healthy controls, the COVID-19
samples triggered an activated endothelial cell phenotype as evidenced by markedly increased
surface expression of the leukocyte adhesion molecules E-selectin (Figure 1B), VCAM-1
(Figure 1C), and ICAM-1 (Figure 1D). Taken together, these data indicate that COVID-19
serum contains factors capable of activating endothelial cells.

Association of NET remnants with the endothelial cell-activating potential of COVID-19
serum. As discussed above, work by our group and many others have demonstrated that
circulating NET remnants associate with both COVID-19 severity and coagulation system
activation (11, 36). Given that NETs are known activators of endothelial cells (37-39), we asked
whether NET remnants might predict the ability of a particular COVID-19 serum sample to
upregulate surface E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1. Specifically, we measured NETs in serum
via quantification of cell-free DNA, MPO-DNA complexes, and citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3)
(Table 1). Serum MPO-DNA complexes demonstrated a modest correlation with surface
expression of both VCAM-1 (r=0.256, p<0.01) and ICAM-1 (r=0.277, p<0.01). Cell-free DNA and
Cit-H3 both correlated with VCAM-1 only (r=0.237, p<0.05 and r=0.224, p<0.05, respectively)
(Table 1). Beyond these relatively specific markers of NETs, we also sought correlations with
general markers of thrombo-inflammation including C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and neutrophil
calprotectin. Of the three markers, only neutrophil calprotectin demonstrated modest
correlations with expression of the three endothelial cell surface markers (r=0.187-0.203,
p<0.05) (Table 1). Taken together, these data demonstrate modest correlations between NETs,
thrombo-inflammation in general, and the ability of COVID-19 serum to activate endothelial
cells.

Association of aPL Abs with the endothelial cell-activating potential of COVID-19 serum.
Given that we recently demonstrated that aPL Abs isolated from patients with COVID-19 had
the ability to stimulate neutrophils to release NETs (30), we reasoned that COVID-19 derived
aPL Abs might also activate endothelial cells. We focused on the IgG and IgM isotypes of two
types of aPL Abs (anticardiolipin and anti-PS/PT) that accounted for the majority of positive
tests in our recent study (30). Interestingly, we detected strong and consistent correlations
between all four antibodies and the three markers of endothelial cell activation (E-selectin,
VCAM-1, and ICAM-1) (Table 1). The only correlation that was not statistically significant was
between anti-PS/PT IgM and VCAM-1 (r=0.115, p>0.05) (Table 1). In summary, while we noted
modest correlations between serum NET remnants and upregulation of E-selectin, VCAM-1,
and ICAM-1, much stronger correlations were seen between various aPL Abs and endothelial
cell activation as measured by surface expression of the three adhesion molecules.

Depletion of IgG alleviates HUVEC activation. While aPL Abs robustly correlated with the
endothelial cell-activating potential of COVID-19 serum, we reasoned that there might be
another co-circulating factor in serum that was actually driving endothelial cell activation. We
therefore sought to prove or disprove whether IgG fractions from COVID-19 patients could
directly activate HUVEC. To this end, we pooled serum from five COVID-19 patients with high
aCL IgG and separately five patients with high anti-PS/PT IgG activity. We then subjected the
serum to either mock or IgG depletion. As compared with mock depletion, IgG depletion
completely mitigated the ability of both of the pooled samples to upregulate endothelial cell Eselectin (Figure 2A), VCAM-1 (Figure 2B) and ICAM-1 (Figure 2C). Upregulation was not
though affected by pre-treatment with a pan-Fc receptor blocker, suggesting Fc independence
of the antibody-mediated activation (Supplementary Figure 1). We next purified a small
quantity of IgG from each pool, and then spiked it into control serum that had been depleted of
its own IgG. The COVID-19 IgG-supplemented control serum now demonstrated an ability to
increase expression of surface ICAM-1 (Figure 2D). Taken together, these data indicate that
the presence of aPL Abs strongly associates with COVID-19 IgG samples that are able to
activate endothelial cells.

DISCUSSION
Here, we report for the first time that serum from COVID-19 patients activates cultured
endothelial cells to express surface adhesion molecules with a known role in thrombosis,
namely E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1. Furthermore, we found that for at least a subset of
serum samples, this activation could be completely mitigated by depleting the samples of IgG.
Prothrombotic aPL Abs associated strongly with these phenotypes suggesting a new
mechanism by which these autoantibodies may perpetuate thrombo-inflammation in COVID-19.

The role of aPL Abs in activating endothelial cells has been demonstrated both in vitro and in
vivo (40). For example, IgG fractions from APS patients have long been known to activate
HUVEC, as reflected by increased monocyte adherence and expression of adhesion molecules
(41) (similar to what we demonstrated here for COVID-19). In APS, aPL Abs may further
promote endothelial dysfunction by antagonizing eNOS via the apoER2 receptor (42, 43).
Downstream of aPL Ab engagement of the endothelial cell surface, various intracellular
messengers including MyD88, NF-κB, and AP-1 may participate in endothelial cell activation
(44, 45), although exact mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated (46). Beyond canonical aPL
Abs, the concept of “anti-endothelial cell antibodies” has also garnered some attention in lupus
and APS (47). These autoantibodies (antigen specificity unclear) have been reported to
enhance leukocyte adhesion and promote thrombosis through interference with clearance of
dying cells (48) or cooperation between Fc gamma receptor IIa and CXCR1/2 (49). Whether
such antibodies may exist in association with aPL Abs in COVID-19 is an interesting question
deserving of further research.

In addition to our findings (30), a number of other groups have also provided evidence for
pathogenic autoantibodies in COVID-19 (31, 33, 50). For example, a recent study detected
autoantibodies against type I IFNs (13.7%) in patients with life-threatening COVID-19 (31), and
provided evidence that these autoantibodies have the ability to neutralize interferons ex vivo.
Another small study suggested that IgG from COVID-19 patients had the ability to induce
platelet phosphatidylserine externalization and apoptosis through interactions with Fc gamma
receptor IIa, which may be associated with thromboembolic complications in COVID-19 patients
(33). An interesting study used a high-throughput autoantibody discovery technique to screen a
cohort of COVID-19 patients for autoantibodies against 2,770 extracellular and secreted
proteins (51). The authors found a tendency for autoantibodies to be directed against
immunomodulatory proteins including cytokines, chemokines, complement components, and

cell surface proteins. Taken together, these findings suggest a pathological role for
autoantibodies in COVID-19 with diverse impacts on immune function, thrombosis, and likely
clinical outcomes.

There are several potential clinical implications of our findings. One may consider whether
patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 should be screened for aPL Abs to evaluate their
risk of thrombosis and progression to respiratory failure. Patients with high aPL Ab titers might
benefit from treatments used in traditional cases of severe APS such as therapeutic
anticoagulation, complement inhibition, and plasmapheresis (52). These findings also suggest
other potential therapies including monoclonal antibody-mediated depletion of plasmablasts, the
specific inhibition of B cells reactive against phospholipids and phospholipid-binding proteins,
endothelial cell-stabilizing therapies, and manipulation of pathogenic-antibody Fc glycosylation
or afucosylation (53-55); all are potentially worthy of future research.

This study has some limitations including reliance on serum samples discarded by the clinical
laboratory, a lack of a direct readout of thrombosis given aggressive anticoagulation used at our
center early in the pandemic, and a so far incomplete understanding of mechanisms by which
aPL Ab-associated IgG fractions activate endothelial cells. However, given the urgency of
COVID-19 research, we believe these weaknesses are counterbalanced by the relatively large
sample size and the heretofore unknown discovery of endothelial cell-activating antibodies in
COVID-19 serum. Indeed, these data also put the diffuse organ involvement of COVID-19 into
context, where a non-specific humoral response to the illness may disrupt the normally
quiescent endothelium and potentiate vascular inflammation. As we await the definitive
immunologic solutions that will hopefully end the pandemic, these findings give further context
to the complex interplay between SARS-CoV-2 infection, the human immune system, and
COVID-19 severity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Serum samples from patients with COVID-19. Blood was collected into serum separator
tubes containing clot activator and serum separator gel by a trained hospital phlebotomist. After
completion of biochemical testing ordered by the clinician, the samples were released to the
research laboratory. Serum samples were immediately divided into small aliquots and stored at
-80°C until the time of testing. All 118 patients had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis based on
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved RNA testing. This study complied with all
relevant ethical regulations, and was approved by the University of Michigan Institutional
Review Board (HUM00179409).
Cell culture. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were purchased from ATCC and
cultured in EBM supplemented with EGM-2MV SingleQuots (Lonza) without hydrocortisone.
10,000 cells/well were seeded into 0.2% gelatin-coated 96-well tissue culture plates the day
before experiments. The following day, HUVEC were cultured with 2.5% human serum or IgG at
a concentration of 100 μg/ml at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. All experiments
were performed using HUVEC of passage 6 or fewer.
IgG depletion from serum. IgG was purified from COVID-19 and control serum with protein G
Agarose beads (Pierce). Briefly, 800 μl of protein G agarose beads were washed at least 10
times by PBS. Then, 200 μl of serum was added and incubated with the beads at 4°C overnight.
The supernatant was collected after spinning the tube at 2500xg for 5 minutes. The supernatant
was the IgG depleted serum. The same volume of serum was incubated without beads under
the same conditions as a mock control. Depletion was confirmed by Coomassie-stained gels.
Purification of human IgG fractions from serum. Serum was diluted in IgG binding buffer and
passed through a Protein G Agarose column (Pierce) at least 5 times. IgG was then eluted with
0.1 M glycine and neutralized with 1 M Tris. This was followed by overnight dialysis against PBS
at 4°C. IgG purity was verified with Coomassie staining, and concentrations were determined by
BCA protein assay (Pierce) according to manufacturer’s instructions. All IgG samples were
determined to have endotoxin level below 0.1 EU/ml by the Pierce LAL Chromogenic Endotoxin
Quantitation Kit (A39552) according to manufacturer’s instructions. This kit offers high sensitivity
with linear detection range of 0.01-1.0 EU/mL.

In-cell ELISA. In the Biosafety Level 3 facility, endothelial cell activation was assessed by an incell ELISA, which measured surface expression of E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 on endothelial
cells. Briefly, confluent monolayers of HUVEC in 96-well microplates were incubated with 2.5%
serum or 100 µg/ml purified IgG for 6 hours and then fixed using the same volume of 8%
paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes. Cells were blocked with 2x blocking solution (Abcam) at room
temperature for 2 hours. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with 5 µg/ml primary
mouse anti-human antibodies against E-selectin (catalog BBA26, R&D), VCAM-1 (catalog
BBA5, R&D), or ICAM-1 (ab2213, Abcam) at 4°C overnight. Next, 100 µl of diluted horseradish
peroxidase conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:2000, Jackson ImmunoResearch) in 1x
blocking solution was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. After washing
thoroughly, 100 µl of TMB substrate was added blue color development was measured at OD
650 nm with a Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (BioTek). The signals were corrected
by subtracting the mean signal of wells incubated in the absence of the primary antibody from
all other readings.

Fc receptor blocking experiment. HUVEC were pretreated with the pan-Fc receptor blocker
(1:50, 422301, Biolegend) for 15 minutes, and then incubated with 2.5% COVID serum or
control serum for 6 hours.

Quantification of aPL Abs. aPL Abs were quantified in sera using Quanta Lite® ACA IgG,
ACA IgM, ACA IgA, aPS/PT IgG, and aPS/PT IgM kits (Inova Diagnostics Inc.) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. All assays are approved for clinical use and received 510(k)
clearance from the FDA. Quanta Lite® aPL ELISAs (Inova Diagnostics) are well recognized by
the international APS research community and are utilized by the largest international APS
clinical research network registry, APS ACTION, in its core laboratories as the “gold standard”
for aPL testing (56, 57). Here, IgG, IgM, and IgA aCL assays were reported in GPL, MPL, and
APL units, respectively; and aPS/PT assays were reported in IgG and IgM units, all per the
manufacturer’s specifications.
Quantification of myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes. Myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes were
quantified similarly to what has been previously described (58). This protocol used several
reagents from the Cell Death Detection ELISA kit (Roche). First, a high-binding EIA/RIA 96-well
plate (Costar) was coated overnight at 4ºC with anti-human myeloperoxidase antibody (Bio-Rad
0400-0002), diluted to a concentration of 1 µg/ml in coating buffer (Cell Death kit). The plate

was washed two times with wash buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS), and then blocked with 4%
bovine serum albumin in PBS (supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20) for 2 hours at room
temperature. The plate was again washed five times, before incubating for 90 minutes at room
temperature with 10% serum or plasma in the aforementioned blocking buffer (without Tween
20). The plate was washed five times, and then incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature
with 10x anti-DNA antibody (HRP-conjugated; from the Cell Death kit) diluted 1:100 in blocking
buffer. After five more washes, the plate was developed with 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine
(TMB) substrate (Invitrogen) followed by a 2N sulfuric acid stop solution. Absorbance was
measured at a wavelength of 450 nm using a Cytation 5 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader
(BioTek). Data were normalized to in vitro-prepared NET standards included on every plate,
which were quantified based on their DNA content.
Quantification of cell-free DNA. Cell-free DNA was quantified in sera using the Quant-iT
PicoGreen dsDNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen, P11496) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Quantification of Cit-H3. Cit-H3 was quantified in sera using the Citrullinated Histone H3
(clone 11D3) ELISA Kit (Cayman, 501620) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Quantification of S100A8/A9 (calprotectin). Calprotectin levels were measured with the
Human S100A8/S100A9 Heterodimer DuoSet ELISA (DY8226-05, R&D Systems) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical analysis. Normally-distributed data were analyzed by two-sided t test and skewed
data were analyzed by Mann-Whitney test when two groups were analyzed. Correlations were
tested by Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Data analysis was with GraphPad Prism software
version 8. Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05.

Figure 1: Activation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) by control or
COVID-19 serum. (A) Schematic workflow for in-cell ELISA. HUVEC were cultured for 6 hours
with serum from either healthy controls (collected pre-pandemic) or patients hospitalized with
COVID-19. Cells were then fixed and surface expression of E-selectin (B), VCAM-1 (C), or
ICAM-1 (D) was quantified. Median values are indicated by horizontal lines. Groups were
analyzed by Mann-Whitney test; ****p<0.0001.

Figure 2: Depletion of IgG from samples with high levels of anticardiolipin (aCL) and antiphosphatidlyserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT) antibodies alleviates HUVEC activation. A-C,
Serum was pooled from 5 patients with high aCL IgG (>40 GPL) or 5 patients with high aPS/PT
IgG (>40 IgG units). IgG was then depleted from each pool. Activation of HUVEC was
determined after culture for 6 hours as defined by surface expression of E-selectin (A), VCAM-1
(B), or ICAM-1 (C). The experiment was repeated on 3 different days, and bars represent mean
and standard deviation. Groups were compared by 2-sided paired t-test; *p<0.05 and **p<0.01.
D, IgG (100ug/ml) was purified from the pooled samples referenced in A-C, and then spiked into
control serum that had been depleted of IgG. Activation of HUVEC was determined after culture
for 6 hours as defined by surface expression of ICAM-1. Groups were compared by 1-way
ANOVA with correction for multiple comparisons by Tukey’s test; **p<0.01.

Supplementary Figure 1: Blocking Fc receptor does not affect HUVEC activation
triggered by COVID serum. HUVEC were pre-treated with a pan-Fc receptor blocker for 15
minutes before the addition of 2.5% pooled COVID serum. Activation of HUVEC was
determined after culture for 6 hours as defined by surface expression of ICAM-1. The
experiment was repeated on 3 different days, and bars represent mean and standard deviation.
Groups were compared by one-way ANOVA with correction for multiple comparisons by
Dunnett’s test; ns=not significant.
