Abstract- Intent of this research is to explore how mathematical
models, specifically Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model,
can be utilized to forecast peak outbreak timeline of COVID-19
epidemic amongst a population of interest starting from the date
of first reported case. Till the time of this research, there was no
effective and universally accepted vaccine to control
transmission and spread of this infection. COVID-19 primarily
spreads in population through respiratory droplets from an
infected person‚Äôs cough and sneeze which infects people who are
in proximity. COVID-19 is spreading contagiously across the
world. If health policy makers and medical experts could get
early and timely insights into when peak infection rate would
occur after first reported case, they could plan and optimize
medical personnel, ventilators supply, and other medical
resources without over-taxing the infrastructure. The predictions
may also help policymakers devise strategies to control the
epidemic, potentially saving many lives. Thus, it can aid in
critical decision-making process by providing actionable insights
into COVID-19 outbreak by leveraging available data.

I. INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus is a large family of viruses causing illness in both
animals and/or humans. Over last decade or so, several other
coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections in
humans, ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases
such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The recently discovered
coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. Today
COVID-19 is causing a global pandemic affecting almost all
countries [1].
Data from health organizations indicate that asymptomatic
individuals can transmit the virus without themselves showing
any signs of infection. Disease control organizations across the
globe are investing in research on this topic and how often this
happens. Recovery from novel coronavirus usually takes 14 days
[2]. About 5%‚Äì15% of patients with COVID-19 infection require
intensive care surveillance and ventilator support [3]. This poses
a challenge for health planners and administrators as to how to
optimally plan and allocate medical staff and other resources
such as ventilators etc. in a large sized country such as India.
According to a joint report [4] by Princeton University and The
Center For Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy (CDDEP),
most of the beds and ventilators in India are concentrated in

seven States only. The report also mentioned that bed capacity
was saturated at hospitals and any spike in COVID-19 cases
would require drastic expansion of hospital beds and ventilators.
This problem represents crux of the issue that the current
research is trying to address by using mathematical modeling to
predict peak COVID-19 outbreak timeline in various states
across India.
II. RELATED WORK
Many previous researches and studies have attempted to employ
mathematical models to provide insights into spread of influenza
epidemics and pandemics [10][11][12]. Many studies have
investigated historical pandemics of the 20th century
[13][14][15]. Modeling techniques have also been used to
understand the influence of interventions in mitigating
pandemics [16].
A category of mathematical models is agent-based models
(ABM) which represent a relatively recent approach to model
complexities in a system composed of agents whose actions are
described using simple rules. It is different from classical SIR
mathematical models (which assume homogeneous population),
as agent-based models try to simulate individuals with distinct
characteristics and in theory can provide more realistic results. A
recent study used agent-based model to evaluate COVID-19
transmission risks in facilities [18]. However, there are several
difficulties associated with creating ABMs such as integration
with too many features, choice of model parameters, model
results being either trivial or too complex [19].
The spread of COVID-19 in India has been investigated in many
researches including [20][21][22][23], but they laid little
emphasis on post-model validation for peak COVID-19 timeline
forecast.
With this in mind, SIR model is explored in current research to
forecast peak COVID-19 outbreak over a large population in
India. The SIR model was chosen because of its simplicity as
well as minimalist compute and data requirements as compared
to agent-based models.

population in 3 compartments with labels - S, I, or R at any point
of time. S is the number of susceptible individuals, I is the
number of individuals infected, R is the number of individuals
who have recovered and developed immunity to the infection.
The number of S, I and R individuals may vary over time, but
total population remains constant. Model computes the predicted
number of people infected with a contagious illness in a closed
population over time. The model assumes fixed size
homogeneous population with no social or spatial structure. An
individual with COVID-19 is infectious for approximately 14
days [6]. Let‚Äôs assume during these 2 weeks period, they can
potentially pass COVID-19 to approximately 5 people. These 2
parameters determine the model inputs viz Œ≥, the recovery rate (=
14 days) and Œ≤, rate of infection (= 1/5 = 0.2).
Using these parameters, the time to reach peak COVID-19
outbreak starting from first reported case is predicted by solving
below system of three linked nonlinear ordinary differential
equations in Python [9]:

V. DISCUSSION
This research was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of
application of SIR model to predict peak COVID-19 outbreak
timeline from the date of first reported case for the 10 largest
states in India which together constitute more than 74% or almost
3/4th of total population in India. The broader goal is to analyze
and evaluate SIR model to provide early insights to public health
agencies which in turn can expedite optimum response to
COVID-19 epidemic.
The research results indicate that for 9 out of these 10 states, SIR
model could predict peak COVID-19 outbreak timeline from the
date of first reported case with error of +/-6 days or less,
Standard Deviation (SD) in error = 5.83 days and Mean Absolute
Deviation (MAD) in error = 4.1 days.
VI. CONCLUSION

VIII. FUTURE SCOPE
Population density, geographic area, demographics such as age
and effect of social isolation etc. are possibly some parameters to
consider and include in building more advanced epidemiology
models for predicting peak epidemic outbreak timeline. Disease
spread models can also be used to predict number of infected
individuals to better manage epidemics.

Aim of this research paper was to predict COVID-19 peak
timeline in various Indian states using SIR model. For 9 out of 10
largest states in India included in the research, chosen SIR model
could predict peak outbreak timeline from the date of the first
reported case with error of +/-6 days or less and Standard
Deviation (SD) in error = 5.83 day. These 9 states constitute over
70% of total population of India.
The model results present a potential opportunity for health
policy makers and medical experts to gain early and timely
insights into COVID-19 peak outbreak timelines for a large
proportion of population in India. They could use these insights
to plan and optimize medical personnel and equipment or to
devise strategies to control the epidemic, well before it hits its
peak. While SIR models have been extensively used, there is
little research on validating their predictions. This research
provided pragmatic validation of SIR models over a large
population.

VII. LIMITATIONS
Compartmental models are in many ways favorable to other
exotic models due to their simplicity and minimal computational
requirements. However, SIR models assume several assumptions
[17] that do not exist in real world epidemic conditions.
The SIR model assumes that there is homogeneous mixing of the
infected and susceptible individuals and that the total population
is constant in time. In the classic SIR model, the susceptible
population decreases monotonically towards zero. However,
these assumptions are not strictly valid in the case of COVID-19
outbreak, since new hot-spots spike at different times. Also, the
effect of enforcing social distancing measures by respective
government and health agencies has not been considered.
This research does not attempts to perform an exhaustive study
because of lack of suitable data as well as uncertainty in different
factors, namely, the degree of home isolation, restrictions in
social contact, the initial number of infected and exposed
individuals, variations in incubation and infectious periods, and
the fatality rate.
