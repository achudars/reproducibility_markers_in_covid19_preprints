ABSTRACT
Fatality from coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a major problem globally and so
identification of its underlying molecular mechanisms would be helpful. The combination of
COVID-19 clinical data and genome sequence information is providing a potential route to
such mechanisms. Here we took a candidate gene approach to UK Biobank data based on
the suggested roles of endothelium and membrane proteins in COVID-19. We focussed on
the PIEZO1 gene, which encodes a non-selective cation channel that mediates endothelial
responses to blood flow. The analysis suggests 3 missense PIEZO1 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with COVID-19 fatality independently of risk factors. All of
them affect amino acids in the proximal N-terminus of PIEZO1, which is an unexplored region
of the protein. By using molecular modelling we predict location of all 3 amino acids to a
common outward-facing structure of unknown functional significance at the tips of the PIEZO1
propeller blades. Through genome sequence analysis we show that these SNPs vary in
prevalence with ethnicity and that the most significant SNP (rs7184427) varies between 65 to
90% even though the reference amino acid is evolutionarily conserved. The data suggest
PIEZO1 as a contributor to COVID-19 fatality and factor in ethnic susceptibility.

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2)1. In 2020 this virus triggered a global health crisis as it spread rapidly
in the absence of a vaccine and with only partially-effective treatments available2,3. One way
to address such a problem could be to understand how the virus enters host cells because it
could usefully inform repurposing of existing therapeutics and enable development of new
therapeutics to reduce the dangers of the virus. There is already evidence that surface
membrane proteins such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are important in SARS-CoV-2 entry4 but
there is little information on the roles of other membrane proteins, membrane lipid components
or membrane structure. Research on other viruses has suggested that such mechanisms
affect viral entry5,6. Membrane proteins of interest are ion channels7,8, which embed in the
membrane and allow transmembrane flux of ions such as Ca2+, which is a key intracellular
signal9 and known regulator of coronavirus mechanisms10-12.
Investigation of COVID-19 patients has pointed to the importance of endothelial cell infection
and endotheliitis13. The study included study of the mesenteric vasculature because of
circulatory collapse in which there was mesenteric ischaemia requiring surgical resection to
remove part of the small intestine13. Viral elements were found in endothelial cells and there

It was suggested that therapeutic strategies aimed at stabilising the endothelium may be
useful, especially in people who are vulnerable because of pre-existing endothelial dysfunction,
such as males, smokers, obese individuals and people with hypertension or diabetes13.
Similarly, an independent study of lungs from patients who died from COVID-19 found severe
endothelial injury and angiogenesis, contrasting with the lungs of patients who died from acute
respiratory distress syndrome secondary to influenza14. In support of these conclusions,
SARS-CoV-2 was found to infect human blood vessel organoids15. Therefore, the idea exists
that vascular endothelium is particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 and important in COVID19 severity13,14,16,17.
For these reasons it could be helpful to learn specifically about the membrane mechanisms of
endothelial cells that confer SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and determine downstream
consequences of the virus in the vasculature. In 2014, an intriguing ion channel protein called
PIEZO1 was reported to be important in endothelium18,19. It forms Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channels with extraordinary capability to respond to membrane tension20 and
shear stress caused by fluid flow along the endothelial membrane surface18. Unusually for
membrane proteins, PIEZO1 indents the membrane in an inverted dome-like fashion and
therefore modifies the overall structure of the membrane21,22. The channel shows striking
activity in mesenteric endothelium23 and there is increasing evidence of its roles in many
aspects of endothelial function, such as angiogenesis18,24 and pulmonary vascular
permeability25,26. It also has roles in cardiovascular health and disease more generally27,
including in the regulation of interleukin-628, which is a key inflammatory mediator of COVID1929. Importance is known in humans because naturally occurring loss-of-function mutations
in PIEZO1 associate with lymphatic endothelial dysfunction30,31 and varicose veins32, and gainof-function mutations associate with anaemia and malarial protection due to importance of
PIEZO1 in red blood cells33-35. Preliminary genetic analysis has hinted at numerous additional
conditions that may be related to mutations in PIEZO127.
Therefore, we hypothesised that mutations in PIEZO1 might relate to COVID-19 and so we
tested this hypothesis using data in the UK Biobank. UK Biobank is a health research resource
that recruited over 500,000 people aged 40 to 69 years between 2006 and 2010 across the
UK36. Recently it incorporated COVID-19 infection and fatality data.
RESULTS
Demographic analysis
UK Biobank released data on 13502 people tested for COVID-19 across 22 assessment
centres as of 3rd August 2020, starting with a first data release on 16th April 2020. Here we
carried out a candidate gene association study on these data to identify potential links between
COVID-19 and mutations in the PIEZO1 gene. We elected to focus on 11235 individuals who
self-identified as “British” because it presented the largest ethnically similar population. Table
1 shows the demographic properties of the study participants. Of these people, 1294 (11.5%)
tested positive. The mean age of all individuals was 70.1 years and 5547 individuals (49%)
were men while 5688 (51%) were women. 12% and 11% of men and women tested positive
for the virus. The positive cases were further categorised into fatal and non-fatal, with fatal
indicating the individuals who were considered to have died due to COVID-19 based on data
linking to the National Death Registries Database. Among those who tested positive, 165
(12.8%) were reported to have died due to COVID-19, while 1129 (87.2%) did not die (nonfatal). We evaluated the co-morbidities of these individuals obtained from non-cancer illness
code (ID 20002). Of the 11235 individuals, 3861 (34%) self-reported hypertension, 479 (4%)
myocardial infarction, 279 (2%) stroke, 800 (7%) diabetes mellitus, 335 (3%) arthritis and 1536
(14%) asthma.

Association analysis strategy
Logistic regression analysis was performed, assuming an additive genetic approach. The first
release for 1158 people was classified as the Discovery cohort and the data for all 11235
cases as the Combined cohort. As summarised in Figure 1, the first analysis step (Step 1)
was for all individuals who tested positive (“cases”) or negative (“controls”). Then, to identify
PIEZO1 variant linkages to disease severity, analysis was performed as per Steps 2-4: (2)
fatal versus negative; (3) non-fatal versus negative; and (4) fatal versus non-fatal. All analyses
were adjusted for age, sex, duration of moderate physical activity and the first 10 principal
components. Associations with COVID-19 risks were quantified using odds ratios (ORs)
derived from logistic regression. Tables 2-6 show the synonymous and missense variants that
were detected as statistically significant in at least one of the analyses.

PIEZO1 coding variation has no effect on susceptibility to infection
As indicated, our Step 1 analysis compared people who tested positive for the virus with
people who tested negative. In the Discovery cohort (N = 1158), 6 synonymous variants were
significantly different between the Positive and Negative groups (P<0.05) and 26 intronic
variants (Table 2 and Supplementary file). But in the Combined cohort, the synonymous
variants were not significantly different (P>0.05) and only 3 intronic variants remained
significant (Supplementary file). The data suggest a possible role for variation in PIEZO1 as a
factor in susceptibility to infection but argue against importance of variation in the PIEZO1
amino acid sequence.

PIEZO1 variation affects COVID-19 fatality
We next compared data for people who were recorded as having died from COVID-19 (fatal)
with data for people who tested negative (Step 2 association analysis: Fatal versus Negative).
Analysis was performed on the Discovery cohort (N = 139 Fatal and N = 619 Negative) and
the Combined cohort (N = 165 Fatal and N = 9941 Negative). In the Discovery cohort, 67
PIEZO1 variants were identified as significantly different (P<0.05), out of which 3 were
missense, 6 synonymous and 58 intronic mutations (Table 3 and Supplementary file). The
Combined cohort supported significance for the same 3 missense variants. The most

significantly different missense variant in both cohorts was rs7184427, which showed odds
ratios (ORs) of 0.4583 and 0.5283 in the Discovery and Combined cohorts respectively. For
the synonymous variants, only 3 of the significant differences were for the same residues as
the Discovery cohort, and 1 was new (Table 3). The data point to variation in the PIEZO1
amino acid sequences as important in COVID-19 fatality.
To extend this analysis, the Combined cohort data were adjusted to six underlying disorders:
hypertension, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, stroke, arthritis and asthma. The
purpose of adjusting was to account for covariate effects, thus exploring whether the identified
variants reflect true associations between PIEZO1 and COVID-19 fatality or associations
linked to these other diseases. COVID-19 fatality was the response variable while the imputed
genotype was the predictor variable used in the PLINK 2.0 logistic regression model. All the
models were adjusted to age, sex, duration of moderate physical activity, along with the first
ten principal components to control population stratification. Consistently across six models of
logistic regression, the results supported relevance of the same 3 missense variants:
rs7184427, rs6500495 and rs7404939 (Table 4). In addition, 4 synonymous variants achieved
significance (Table 4). The ORs and P-values of each variant did not deviate obviously across
the 6 disease models (Table 4). The analysis suggests direct association between variation in
PIEZO1 amino acid sequence and COVID-19 fatality.

PIEZO1 variation is not associated with non-fatal COVID-19
To investigate if non-fatal infection is linked to PIEZO1 variants we carried out Step 3
association analysis in which we compared people who tested positive for the virus but did not
die (non-fatal cases) with people who tested negative. In the Discovery cohort, consisting of
400 non-fatal cases and 619 people testing negative, 3 synonymous variants were
significantly different (Table 5), as were 8 intronic variants (Supplementary file). However,
there were no significantly different variants in the Combined cohort (Supplementary file). The
data suggest that PIEZO1 variation lacks relevance to non-fatal COVID-19.

rs7184427 is consistently associated with fatality
As a further test, we compared fatal and non-fatal cases. In the Discovery cohort, 12 intronic
variants were significantly different but no other significant variants were detected
(Supplementary file). However, in the Combined cohort there were significant differences for
1 missense and 2 synonymous variants (Table 6) and 10 intronic variants (Supplementary
file). The missense variant was the rs7184427 SNP, as identified in the earlier analysis (Tables
3 and 4). The data further suggest importance of PIEZO1 variation in COVID-19 fatality and
point particularly to rs7184427.

rs7184427 affects a highly conserved amino acid residue
The analysis above suggests 3 missense SNPs linked to COVID-19 fatality: rs7184427,
rs6500495 and rs7404939; with rs7184427 being particularly strongly implicated. Intriguingly,
all of these SNPs affect amino acids in the N-terminus of PIEZO1, about which there is little
prior knowledge. Human PIEZO1 comprises 2521 amino acids in total and rs6500495 affects
position 83, rs7404939 position 152 and rs7184427 position 250. Therefore, these amino
acids lie in the first 10% of the PIEZO1 sequence.
To learn more about this part of the protein, 16 PIEZO1 orthologous protein sequences were
compared by constructing a maximum likelihood tree using RAxML (Figure 2A). It shows that:
at position 83, isoleucine (I) is unique to humans, whereas in the other species it is threonine
(T); at position 152, the residue is highly diverse across species; and at position 250, there is
complete conservation of valine (Figure 2B). It should be noted that the analysis was based
on reference sequences that do not necessarily reflect the mutations implicated in our UK
Biobank analysis: rs6500495 encodes a switch at position 83 from the reference isoleucine to
threonine; rs7404939 encodes the reference proline rather than leucine at position 152; and
rs7184427 encodes alanine rather than the reference valine at position 250. In summary, the
analysis suggests that rs7184427 affects a residue that is highly evolutionarily conserved and
therefore likely to have functional importance.

Prediction of an outward-facing interaction site
Because so little is known about the proximal N-terminus of PIEZO1, we sought insight
through molecular modelling of the channel. For these studies we used mouse PIEZO1
because cryo-EM structural data exist for this PIEZO21, in which the equivalents of I83, P152
and V250 are T83, T152 and V257 (Figure 3). Unfortunately, the structural data do not include
residues 1-576 and thus not residues 83, 152 and 257. However, the similarity and repetitive
nature of nearby regions suggested the possibility to predict the entire protein structure, which
we did (Figure 3)22. Validity of the model was supported by close overlay with the related
mouse PIEZO222, for which complete experimentally-derived structural data exist37. Viewing
our modelled PIEZO1 from the extracellular space shows the expected trimeric arrangement
of the 3 PIEZO1s required to form a PIEZO1 ion channel (Figure 3A). The ion pore, which
selects for transmembrane flux of cations, is in the centre, and over this lies a large cap,
referred to as the C-terminal extracellular domain (CED) (Figure 3A). Spiralling outwards are
three long propeller blade-like structures (Figure 3A). T83, T152 and V257 reside at the farreaches of these blades, distant from the ion pore - each repeated 3 times (Figure 3A).
Intriguingly they all lie at the same outer face of the blade tips, ideally placed for interaction
with another protein or proteins (Figure 3A). To the best of our knowledge, no such interaction
or interactions are actually known and so their existence is speculation. A close-up side view

of one distal N-terminal blade shows T83 at the extracellular face of the membrane-spanning
structure and T152 and V257 at the cytosolic face (Figure 3B). Overall, the modelling supports
the expected distal location of the 3 amino acids affected by missense SNPs and suggests
the potential for a common role in an outward-facing interaction site.

Ethnic variation in prevalence of the missense variants
Suggestions have been made that susceptibility to COVID-19 varies according to ethnicity,
partly due to socioeconomic differences but potentially also because of biological variations3840
. We therefore investigated whether the pro-disease allele frequency of the 3 significant
missense variants (rs7184427, rs6500495 and rs7404939) differs across ethnic groups by
analysing gene sequence and ethnicity data in UK Biobank, 1000 Genome and Genome
Aggregation Database (gnomAD).
In this analysis it can been seen that the major allele (G allele) frequency of rs7184427 (which
is associated with greater COVID-19 fatality and results in V250A mutation) has a generally
high frequency of occurrence across all global populations of 82.0-84.4% (Table 7). Therefore,
although the reference PIEZO1 sequence indicates valine at this position (Figure 2B), alanine
is most common. Analysis by ethnic group shows that the G allele frequency is lower in “South
Asian” populations (“Bangladeshi”, “Indian”, “Pakistani”) at 65.0-70.8% (Table 7). In UK
Biobank, the frequency is the same for “African” and “British” but higher for “Caribbean”. In
GnomAD, where the number of “African” contributors is greater, the G allele frequency is
greater than the global average (Table 7). The data suggest that rs7184427 is more common
in “African” and “Caribbean” groups where it could potentially result in great fatality, whereas
the opposite is the case with “South Asian” ethnicity. Similarly, for rs6500495, the major allele
(G allele) frequency is lower in “South Asian” groups and higher in “African” and “Caribbean”
groups compared with the global average or “British” group (Table 7). Whereas for rs7404939,
the major allele (G allele) frequency is lower in “South Asian” groups and for “African” and
“Caribbean” groups compared with the global average or “British” group (Table 7). The data
suggest ethnic variation in the frequency of occurrence of the 3 missense PIEZO1 variants.

Synonymous variants also differ in frequency with ethnicity
Similar analysis was performed for synonymous mutations associate with COVID-19 fatality
in at least one step of the association analysis (Figure 4). Focussing only on those that were
significant in the Combined cohort after adjusting for self-reported illnesses: rs4782430 is also
more frequent in African and Caribbean groups and less frequent in South Asian groups;
rs8043924 is also less frequent in South Asian groups; but rs2290902 and rs8043924 are less
frequent in African and Caribbean groups; and rs6500491 shows no differences (Figure 4).
The data suggest that the synonymous variants also vary in frequency with ethnicity but that
the pattern is not consistent for all mutations.

different populations in UK Biobank (expressed as percentages).

DISCUSSION
The study suggests that genetic variation in PIEZO1 is a factor in COVID-19 fatality. One
particular variant stands out: rs7184427. This SNP is a missense mutation that causes a
change in amino acid in the PIEZO1 N-terminus. According to phylogenetic analysis of
reference sequences, the amino acid at this position is a highly evolutionarily conserved valine.
This suggests functional importance, although the nature of this importance is currently
unclear. Moreover, although valine is in the reference sequence, rs7184427 causes a switch
to alanine. This switch, which associates with the greatest COVID-19 fatality, is the most
common variant in humans globally. The frequency varies with ethnicity and may be a factor
in the different susceptibilities of different ethnic groups to lethal effects of COVID-19.
Geographic and socio-economic factors account for at least half of the difference in risk of
COVID-19 fatality between people of Black and White ethnicity in the UK, but these factors do
not explain all of the difference40. Greater genetic susceptibility of Black people could be a
factor and our analysis lends some support to this hypothesis because rs7184427 appears to
be more common in people of African or Caribbean ethnicity. It is notable, however, that
rs7184427 is less common in people of South Asian ethnicity even though these people suffer
great COVID-19 fatality in the UK40.
We do not yet know if alanine in place of valine at position 250 in PIEZO1 causes less, more
or no change in the properties of the PIEZO1 channels or whether the altered DNA sequence

affects PIEZO1 expression. The valine amino acid is similar to the alanine amino acid but this
chemical difference can be crucial in α-helical integrity41.
While we have insight into how some parts of the PIEZO1 molecular machine operate21,42,43,
the particular region of PIEZO1 incorporating V or A at position 250 is uncharted territory22.
Based on our molecular modelling we suggest that V250A forms part of an outward-facing
domain at the tip of the propeller blades, along with the other residues affected by SNPs (I83
and P152) (Figure 3A). Such a domain seems ideally placed to interact with nearby proteins
but could also be important in refining mechanical sensitivity and how the channel interacts
with lipids22. The molecular and functional studies required to test these ideas will take time to
complete. Moreover, our studies have shown the importance of understanding PIEZO1 in its
native membrane environment because the native endothelial and red blood cell environments
profoundly alter the gating characteristics of PIEZO118,27,44,45. We do not yet know whether
endothelial cell dysfunction affects the properties of PIEZO1, but any changes could be
relevant to COVID-19 and its progression to fatality.
There is a public database entry indicating a link of V250A to hereditary lymphedema in one
patient46 and we know that generalised lymphatic dysplasia can be caused by loss of PIEZO1
expression30,31. On this basis we might speculate that V250A reduces PIEZO1 function and
that this is the reason for increased susceptibility to COVID-19 fatality. If this is the case,
PIEZO1 agonists may be a route to rescuing normal channel activity and protecting against
fatality. This may be a safe approach because we know that PIEZO1 gain-of-function is
tolerated in people and even confers protective advantage in large populations where malaria
is endemic33-35. A screen of 3.25 million small-molecules identified a PIEZO1 agonist called
Yoda147. It is increasingly used successfully as a tool compound in experimental studies of
PIEZO127 and there is on-going work to elucidate the chemical structure-activity requirements
and improve the physicochemical properties while retaining efficacy; some of these studies
have been published48. To the best of our knowledge there is currently no PIEZO1 agonist
that would be suitable for administration to people but the available data suggest that the
principle of chemical enhancement of PIEZO1 is possible and thus that a therapeutic drug
targeted to PIEZO1 is a realistic consideration.
In addition to a possible link to lymphedema, our study raises the question of whether COVID19 is linked to varicose veins. A genome-wide association study identified mutations in
PIEZO1 as determinants of varicose veins32 and a recent study specifically linked V250A to
varicose veins49. These observations further encourage the idea of an important relationship
between vascular integrity and COVID-1913,14,16,17.
PIEZO1 may act by impacting membrane structure in such a way as to affect viral entry, but
we should also consider the property of PIEZO1 to confer Ca2+ permeability on the membrane
because transmissibility of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is Ca2+-dependent and both are
closely related to SARS-CoV-210,11,50. E protein of SARS-Co-V forms Ca2+ permeable ion
pores on ER/Golgi membrane and its activity can drive the inflammation and severe
respiratory distress syndrome by enhancing IL-1β production51. One of the accessory proteins
of SARS-CoV undergoes conformational changes upon binding to Ca2+ and significantly
contributes to disease progression12,52.
Synonymous mutations do not change the amino acid sequence but they could still, in theory,
have effects by altering expression of the PIEZO1 gene, thereby affecting the total amount of
PIEZO1 available for functional consequence. We note that one of the synonymous mutations
we identified (rs2290902) has also been associated with HIV-1 infection53 but we are not
aware of further investigation of this matter. It is nevertheless consistent with our general idea
that PIEZO1 is relevant to viral disease.

In addition to its endothelial and red blood cell functions, PIEZO1 is expressed in other cell
types such as epithelial cells and implicated in other aspects of mammalian biology27,43. It may
be particularly important to note in this context the recent persuasive evidence for a role of
PIEZO1 in pulmonary inflammation, bacterial infection and fibrotic auto-inflammation54. In this
study it was concluded that stimulation of PIEZO1 in immune cells by cyclical mechanical force
is essential for innate immunity. Therefore, we speculate that any loss of PIEZO1 function
would increase susceptibility to lung infection and perhaps other infections and that PIEZO1
agonism might be beneficial. Cyclical activation of PIEZO1 might also be important in the
protective benefits of physical exercise where PIEZO1 has been suggested to have an
important role in blood pressure elevation of exercise that increases performance23. PIEZO1
might be relevant to the speculation about a connection between malarial protection and
COVID-1955,56 because heterozygosity for PIEZO1 gain-of-function mutation has been
suggested to be a major factor mediating protection from malaria35.
We recognise that a potential limitation of our study is the relatively small size of the COVID19 data set on which we could base the analysis. Analysis of additional data as they become
available will be important for deeper understanding and exploration of PIEZO1 in all groups
and specifically in non-White ethnic groups.
In an initial preprint released on 3 June 2020 based on UK Biobank data available on 16 April
2020 we suggested association of rs7184427 with SARS-CoV-2 infectivity (doi:
https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.01.20119651;
http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3618312).
Subsequent to the 16 April release, changes were made to the underlying data by UK Biobank,
we presume to improve accuracy. These changes caused the P-value for rs7184427 to
become slightly greater than the threshold value for significance in regard to infection rates.
Therefore, as reported in this article, we no longer suggest significant association of this
variant with infectivity. It is intriguing that this same variant is the one that is most significantly
associated with COVID-19 fatality. It may be that larger data sets will again suggest a link to
infectivity and that rs7184427 has a role in susceptibility to infection as well as fatality.
In summary, our study suggests genetic association that is relevant to COVID-19 fatality and
ethnic variation in susceptibility to fatality and a previously unrecognised relationship between
COVID-19 and PIEZO1, a gene that encodes an important mechanically-activated ion channel
of the endothelium and other cellular structures that are relevant to this disease.
METHODS
Demographic information
The UK Biobank resource recruited over 500,000 people aged 40 to 69 years between 2006
and 2010 across the UK36. Participants completed a detailed clinical, demographic and
lifestyle questionnaire, underwent clinical measures, provided biological samples (blood, urine
and saliva) for future analysis and agreed to have their health records accessed. In July 2017,
the genetic information from 501,708 samples was released to UK Biobank research
collaborators. The UK Biobank has now released the data of individuals tested for COVID-19
in different updates. The first release of the COVID-19 dataset served as the discovery cohort
in the present study while the subsequent releases were combined with the discovery cohort
to form a combined cohort to study the association between COVID-19 and PIEZO1.
Discovery cohort: On 16th April 2020, the UK Biobank released the data of 1474
individuals tested for COVID-19 across its 22 assessment centres. Of those, 1158 were British.
Combined cohort: This cohort included all individuals from the five different releases
by UK Biobank (N = 13502). Of those, 11235 individuals were British.
Baseline assessments of all individuals tested for COVID-19 were recorded when they
attended one of the 22 research centres located across the United Kingdom. Co-morbidity
details of these subjects was taken from the self-reported non-cancer illness codes in the UK

Biobank (Data-field 20002), which includes self-reported hypertension, myocardial infarction,
stroke, diabetes mellitus, arthritis and asthma. Arthritis status consists of self-reported
rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.
Statistical analysis
Imputed genotypes of chromosome 16 for all 1158 (discovery cohort) and 11235 (combined
cohort) individuals who self-reported as “British” were used for the association study.
Imputation was conducted by UK Biobank using IMPUTE257. As this is a candidate gene
association study, we focused on the PIEZO1 gene sequence. Variants with imputation quality
(Info) score above 0.4 were retained in the analysis. The variants were further filtered based
on minor allele frequency (MAF) >5%, missingness >10%, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
(HWE) >1x10-6 and sample missingness >10%. Of the total number of 197,730 variants
spanning chromosome 16, following the filtering parameters above, only 196,314 variants
were eligible for the downstream analysis. We analysed 334 variants spanning the coding
region of PIEZO1 and the statistical significance was set at P<0.05 (0.05/1 gene). To reduce
the risk of confounding factors due to differences in ancestral background in the UK Biobank,
the analyses were restricted to individuals who self-reported as “British” comprising 1158
individuals in discovery cohort and 11235 individuals in combined cohort.
Step 1 of association analysis. The first step was conducted on the association
between COVID-19 and PIEZO1 in all positive and negative individuals in both the cohorts.
The association analysis was performed using logistic regression implemented in PLINK v2.0
(whole genome data analysis toolset) 58. The COVID-19 status was used as a categorical
variable in the logistic regression analysis. Individuals tested positive at least once for COVID19 were considered as cases while the negatives were considered as controls. In the
discovery cohort, 539 cases were compared against 619 controls. In the combined cohort, all
positive cases comprised of 1294 individuals against 9941 controls. To account for population
structure, the first ten principal components were calculated for the cohorts using “--pca”
implemented in PLINK 2.0 and used as covariates in the logistic regression. The duration of
moderate activity was obtained from the UK Biobank (Field-ID 894) and adjusted as a
covariate since PIEZO1 acts as an exercise sensor, mediating optimised redistribution of
blood flow to sustain activity23. The activity level was determined using a questionnaire on
duration of exercise/activity each day. The logistic regression analyses were also adjusted to
sex and age. The workflow of the analysis pipeline is presented in Figure 1.
Step 2 of association analysis. To determine whether PIEZO1 variants were linked
with COVID-19 fatality, step 2 of the analysis focused on the deaths due to COVID-19. The
death register data were provided by UK Biobank through the National Death Registries
database. The cause of death due to COVID-19 was labelled as “U071” in the data-field 40001.
In the analysis, only the deaths caused by COVID-19 were categorised as fatal cases while
the negatives were classified as controls in the logistic regression analysis. There were 139
fatal cases versus 619 negatives in the discovery cohort and 165 fatal cases versus 9941
negatives in the combined cohort. For the combined cohort, we additionally adjusted the
analysis to six self-reported non-cancer illnesses (Field-ID 20002) namely hypertension,
myocardial infarction, stroke, diabetes mellitus, arthritis and asthma status. Age, sex, duration
of moderate activity and first 10 principal components were used as covariates.
Step 3 of association analysis. For step 3 of the analysis, individuals who were tested
positive for COVID-19 but not recorded dead were defined as cases. Logistic regression under
additive model was used to test the association between non-fatal cases and negatives. In the
discovery cohort, there were 400 non-fatal cases against 619 negatives. 1129 non-fatal and
9941 negatives were found in combined cohort. Similarly, the analyses were adjusted to age,
sex, duration of moderate activity and first 10 principal components.
Step 4 of association analysis. We aimed to identify the PIEZO1 variants associated
with disease severity in COVID-19. The final step of the analysis focused on fatal and nonfatal cases of COVID-19. Using logistic regression under additive model, the cases were
defined as deaths due to COVID-19 while the controls were defined as positive for COVID-19

but not dead. There were 139 fatal versus 400 non-fatal in discovery cohort and 165 fatal
versus 1129 non-fatal in combined cohort. We controlled for age, sex, duration of moderate
activity and first 10 principal components in all the analyses. The analysis pipeline is
summarised in Figure 1. In four steps of the analyses, ANNOVAR59 was used to annotate the
variants to predict missense variants, frameshift mutations and intronic variants.

The amino acid sequences of PIEZO1 in these 16 species were aligned using
CLUSTAL OMEGA61. The resulting alignments were manually curated and trimmed using
alignment editor in MEGA 762. Next, the amino acid sequences were subjected to phylogenetic
analysis using RAxML63 based on maximum likelihood algorithm. The phylogenetic tree was
generated with 100 rapid bootstrap replicates. The tree was visualised in Fig Tree version
1.4.364 and the bootstrap support values labelled on the nodes.
