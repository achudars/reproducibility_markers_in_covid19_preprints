ABSTRACT

34

The COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for rapid, effective, and low-cost SARS-

35

CoV-2 diagnostic testing. Here, we describe COV-ID, an approach that combines RT-LAMP with

36

deep sequencing to detect SARS-CoV-2 in unprocessed human saliva with high sensitivity (5–10

37

virions). Based on a multi-dimensional barcoding strategy, COV-ID can be used to test thousands

38

of samples overnight in a single sequencing run with limited labor and laboratory equipment. The

39

sequencing-based readout allows COV-ID to detect multiple amplicons simultaneously, including

40

key controls such as host transcripts and artificial spike-ins, as well as multiple pathogens. Here

41

we demonstrate this flexibility by simultaneous detection of 4 amplicons in contrived saliva

42

samples: SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, human STATHERIN, and an artificial SARS spike-in. The

43

approach was validated on clinical saliva samples, where it showed 100% agreement with RT-

44

qPCR. COV-ID can also be performed directly on saliva adsorbed on filter paper, simplifying

45

collection logistics and sample handling.

INTRODUCTION

47

Within the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic SARS-CoV-2 has swept across the world, leading

48

to more than 130 million infections and over 2.8 million deaths worldwide (as of April 2021). In

49

many countries, non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as school closures and national

50

lockdowns, have proven to be effective, but could not be sustained due to economic and social

51

impact1, 2. Regularly performed population-level diagnostic testing is an attractive solution3,

52

particularly as asymptomatic individuals are implicated in rapid disease transmission, with a

53

strong overdispersion in secondary transmission4. Maintenance of population-level testing can be

54

successful in isolating asymptomatic individuals and preventing sustained transmission5, 6;

55

however, considerable barriers exist to the adoption of such massive testing strategies. Two such

56

barriers are cost and supply constraints for commercial testing reagents, both of which make it

57

impractical to test large numbers of asymptomatic individuals on a recurrent basis. A third major

58

barrier is the lack of “user-friendly” protocols that can be rapidly adopted by public and private

59

organizations to establish high-throughput surveillance screening. In addition, while COVID-19

60

testing of symptomatic individuals might be effective during the summer season, when other

61

respiratory infections are rare, new strategies are needed to facilitate rapid differential diagnosis

62

between SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses in winter.

63

Recent adaptations of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to amplify

64

viral sequence and perform next-generation DNA sequencing have opened promising new

65

avenues for massively parallel SARS-CoV-2 detection. In general, sequencing-based protocols

66

use libraries of amplification primers to tag reads originating from each individual patient sample

67

with a unique index that can be identified and deconvoluted after sequencing, thus allowing

68

pooling of tens of thousands of samples in a single assay. SARSeq, SPAR-Seq, Swab-seq, and

69

INSIGHT, directly amplify the viral RNA by RT-PCR and simultaneously introduce barcodes7-10.

70

While effective, these methods rely on individual PCR amplification of each patient sample, thus

71

requiring a large number of thermal cyclers for massive scale-up. An alternative approach,

72

ApharSeq, addresses this bottleneck by annealing barcoded RT primers to viral RNA and pooling

73

samples prior to amplification but the need for specialized oligo-dT magnetic beads might

74

constitute a separate adoption barrier for this method11. Finally, several recent methods have

75

been designed to take advantage of the extreme sensitivity and isothermal conditions of loop-

76

mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)12-14, but these methods
12, 13

either require additional

or do not allow for convenient multiplexing14.

77

manipulation to introduce barcodes

78

In this study, we present COV-ID, a method for SARS-CoV-2 identification based on LAMP, which

79

enables large-scale diagnostic testing at low cost and with minimal on-site equipment. COV-ID is

80

a robust method that can be used to test tens of thousands of samples for multiple pathogens

81

with modest reagent costs and 2–4 laboratory personnel, generating results within 24 hours.

82

COV-ID uses unpurified saliva or saliva adsorbed on filter paper as input material, thus enabling

83

the massively parallel, inexpensive testing required for population-level surveillance of the

84

COVID-19 pandemic (Fig. 1A).

85

RESULTS

86

Two-step amplification and indexing of viral and human sequences via RT-LAMP and PCR

87

The molecular basis for COV-ID is reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification

88

(RT-LAMP), an alternative to PCR that has been used extensively for viral DNA or RNA detection

89

in clinical samples15-18, including SARS-CoV-219, 20. RT-LAMP requires 4–6 primers that recognize

90

different regions of the target sequence21, 22 and proceeds through a set of primed and self-primed

91

steps to yield many inverted copies of the target sequence spanning a range of molecular sizes

92

(Fig. S1). The forward inner primer (FIP) and backward inner primer (BIP), which recognize

93

internal sequences, are incorporated in opposite orientation across the target sequence in the

94

final amplified product (Fig. S1).

95

Previous studies have shown that the FIP and BIP tolerate insertion of exogenous sequence

96

between their different target homology regions23. We exploited this flexibility and introduced 1)

97

patient-specific barcodes as shown previously12, 14, 23 and 2) artificial sequences that allowed for

98

PCR amplification of a small product compatible with Illumina sequencing library construction

99

(Fig. 1, Fig. S1). These innovations allow us to pool individually barcoded RT-LAMP reactions

100

and amplify them in batch via PCR, while introducing unique P5 and P7 dual indexes in different

101

pools, thus enabling two-dimensional barcoding and dramatically increasing method throughput

102

(see Table S1 for PCR primer sequences). To minimize pool variability, PCR primers can be

103

titrated to 100 nM and pooled PCRs carried out to completion, resulting in each pool being

104

amplified to the same approximate concentration. Uniquely amplified and barcoded pools are

105

mixed into a single “super-pool” that can be sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq or similar

106

instrument (Fig. 1A). Combining individual barcodes embedded in the product at the RT-LAMP

107

step with dual indexes introduced at the pool level during the PCR step allows for deconvolution

108

of thousands or tens of thousands of samples in a single sequencing run.

109

To determine whether introduction of these exogenous sequences into the primers inhibited the

110

isothermal amplification step, we performed RT-LAMP on inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus using an

111

extensively validated primer set against the N2 region of the nucleocapsid protein24 including

112

either the conventional BIP and FIP primers or their modified version re-engineered for the COV-

113

ID workflow (Fig. 1B). Although the appearance of the amplified viral product was slightly delayed

114

when using COV-ID primers, all reactions reached saturation rapidly and without detectable

115

amplification of negative controls (Fig. 1C). Next, we tested whether COV-ID was compatible with

116

RT-LAMP using newly designed primers against a host (human) transcript and whether the

117

second step of COV-ID, direct library construction and indexing via PCR amplification (Fig. 1D),

118

yields the desired product. For this, we designed RT-LAMP primers against the human beta-actin

119

(ACTB) transcript that included sequences necessary for COV-ID. After RT-LAMP, reactions were

120

diluted 100-fold before PCR with barcoded Illumina adapters. A PCR product of the expected size

121

was visible in reactions containing total HeLa RNA, whereas no PCR product was observed in

122

the absence of template (Fig. 1E). Sanger sequencing of the PCR product confirmed that RT-

123

LAMP followed by PCR generated the product expected by the COV-ID method design, including

124

the sample barcode introduced during the RT-LAMP step.

125

Thus, our data show that RT-LAMP is tolerant of sequence insertions in the BIP and FIP primers

126

that allow introduction of LAMP-level barcodes as well as sequences homologous to Illumina

127

adapters for direct amplification, indexing, and library construction via PCR.

128

Sequencing-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from saliva using COV-ID

129

We next evaluated the utility of COV-ID to detect viral RNA in saliva. Saliva is an attractive sample

130

material for COVID-19 diagnostics with potential for early detection25, and has been shown to be

131

a viable template for nucleic acid amplification via RT-PCR26, recombinase polymerase

132

amplification (RPA)27 as well as RT-LAMP28, 29. We prepared human saliva for RT-LAMP using a

133

previously described treatment that inactivates SARS-CoV-2 virions, saliva-borne RNases and

134

LAMP inhibitors (Fig. 2A)29. We performed RT-LAMP followed by PCR on inactivated saliva

135

spiked with water or 1,000 total copies of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus. We observed a single

136

band of the expected size in reactions performed on saliva spiked with virus but not in control

137

reactions (Fig. 2B). The sequence of the amplified and barcoded viral product was confirmed by

138

Sanger sequencing (Fig. S2A). Next, we subjected the libraries to deep sequencing. Reads

139

aligned uniformly to the N gene, the region targeted by the N2 primer set, in COV-ID libraries

140

constructed from viral samples but not in control libraries (Fig. 2C).

141

In several SARS-CoV-2 FDA approved tests, parallel amplification of a host (human) amplicon is

142

implemented as a metric for sample integrity and quality. That is, if no human RNA is amplified

143

from a clinical sample, no conclusion can be drawn from a negative test result30. However, in most

144

tests, viral and human amplicons must be detected separately, resulting in a multiplication of the

145

number of reactions to be performed. We reasoned that the deep sequencing nature of COV-ID

146

would allow for simultaneous detection of viral, human, and other control amplicons, without

147

increasing the number of necessary reactions. In fact, given that the PCR handles inserted in the

148

BIP and FIP are the same for all RT-LAMP amplicons (Fig. 1B), the same P5 and P7 Illumina

149

primers allow the simultaneous amplification of all RT-LAMP products obtained with COV-ID-

150

modified primer sets (Fig. 1D). To identify a suitable human control, we compared conventional

151

RT-LAMP primers for the mRNA of ACTB24 or STATHERIN (STATH), a gene expressed

152

specifically in saliva31. To determine which of the two RT-LAMP primer sets was a better proxy to

153

measure RNA integrity in saliva samples, we assayed for amplification of the respective products

154

in presence or absence of RNase. Whereas addition of RNase A abolished the STATH signal, it

155

was ineffectual for ACTB (Fig. S2B), suggesting that amplification of genomic DNA made

156

considerable contributions to the RT-LAMP signal observed for the latter. Therefore, we utilized

157

STATH mRNA as a human control in subsequent experiments.

158

We used COV-ID-adapted primer sets for N2 and STATH (Table S1) in multiplex on inactivated

159

saliva spiked with a range of SARS-CoV-2 from 5 to 10,000 virions/μL. Subsequently, each RT-

160

LAMP reaction was separately amplified via PCR using a unique P5 and P7 index combination,

161

pooled, quantified, and deep-sequenced to an average depth of 6,000 reads per sample. After

162

read trimming, alignment, and filtering (see Methods), 76% of reads from saliva COV-ID reactions

163

were informative (Fig. S2C). In order to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative samples,

164

we calculated the ratio between N2 reads and reads mapping to the human STATH control. Using

165

the highest N2/STATH read ratio in control (SARS-CoV-2 negative saliva) as a threshold, 95%

166

(19/20) of samples with spiked-in virus were correctly classified as positives (Fig. 2D). Using

167

COV-ID, we consistently detected SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples containing as low as 5 virions

168

per µL, a sensitivity comparable and in some cases superior to those of established testing

169

protocols32.

170

Scaling COV-ID to handle higher sample numbers requires pooling samples immediately

171

following RT-LAMP, prior to the PCR step (Fig. 1A). We designed 32 unique 5-nucleotide

172

barcodes for several target LAMP amplicons (Fig. S2D and Table S2). We first individually

173

validated each barcode and primer combination by real-time fluorescence and PCR efficiency.

174

Certain barcodes inhibited the RT-LAMP reaction, possibly due to internal micro-homology and

175

primer self-hybridization33. Nonetheless, out of 32 barcodes tested in 3 separate RT-LAMP

176

reactions (N2, ACTB, and STATH), 25 successfully amplified all three target RNAs (Fig. S2D).

177

Saliva samples spiked with various concentrations of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 were amplified via

178

barcoded RT-LAMP, then optionally pooled prior to PCR and sequencing (Fig. S2E). CoV-

179

2/STATH ratios demonstrated no loss of sensitivity or specificity in the pooled samples compared

180

to the individual PCRs.

181

To test the potential of COV-ID on patient samples, we tested saliva specimens, collected and

182

previously analyzed at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (see Methods). We carried

183

out multiplex barcoded RT-LAMPs on each sample (COV-ID step I, Fig. 1B), pooled the reactions

184

and then constructed libraries via PCR (COV-ID step II, Fig. 1D). After deep sequencing, analysis

185

of N2/STATH ratios showed 100% (8/8) concordance with viral copy numbers generated by a

186

standard clinical test (RNA purification followed by RT-qPCR) (Fig. 2E), demonstrating the

187

effectiveness of the COV-ID approach.

188

Taken together, our data show that COV-ID can be utilized to detect viral and human amplicons

189

in multiplex directly from saliva. The samples that can be batch amplified and deconvoluted after

190

deep sequencing.

191

Calibration of COV-ID using an artificial spike-in

192

Existing deep sequencing approaches for massively parallel COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR

193

incorporate artificial spike-ins, which serve as an internal calibration controls and allow for better

194

estimates of viral loads by end-point PCR7, 8. At the same time, adding to the reactions an artificial

195

substrate for amplification helps minimizing spurious signals as it can “scavenge” viral

196

amplification primers in negative samples. Finally, by providing a baseline amplification even in

197

empty samples, a properly designed spike-in strategy can reduce variance in total amounts of

198

final amplified products across samples, which compresses the dynamic-range of sequence

199

coverage for each patient in a complex pool and, therefore, reduces the risk of inconclusive

200

samples due to low sequencing coverage8.

201

We reasoned that a spike-in approach for LAMP-based quantification would provide similar

202

benefits in the context of COV-ID. To generate a SARS-CoV-2 spike-in, we synthesized a

203

fragment of the N2 RNA that retained all primer-binding regions for RT-LAMP and contained a

204

divergent 7-nt stretch of sequence to distinguish reads originating from the spike-in from those

205

originating from the natural virus (Fig. S3A). After confirming that the spike-in template was

206

efficiently amplified via RT-LAMP with the N2 primer set (Fig. S3B), we performed pooled COV-

207

ID on virus-containing saliva in the presence of 20 fg of N2 spike-in RNA. As expected8, addition

208

of a constant amount of viral spike-in across reactions reduced the variability in total read numbers

209

for individual samples in the final pool (Fig. S3C). As discussed above, a narrower range in

210

sequencing output across samples in a pool optimizes the utilization of sequencing reads, and

211

ultimately lowers the cost per sample. Because the spike-in provides an internal calibration that

212

is independent of the RNA quality found in saliva, in several cases normalization against the

213

spike-in resulted in lower levels of false positive signal from negative samples (Fig. S3D). This is

214

likely because in cases where very few STATH reads were obtained, possibly due to degradation

215

of host RNA in the saliva sample, the resulting small denominator inflated the N2/STATH ratio

216

even for SARS-CoV-2 signal that was low in absolute terms and likely spurious.

217

Thus, these data show that spike-in strategies are compatible with the COV-ID workflow and

218

provide a means to stabilize total amplification and read allocation per sample while also offering

219

an additional calibration control to better estimate the viral load in samples where the endogenous

220

STATH mRNA might be below detection due to improper collection or handling.

223

Simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A by COV-ID

224

Given the challenge of distinguishing early symptoms of COVID-19 from other respiratory

225

infections, we evaluated COV-ID for the simultaneous detection of more than one viral pathogen.

226

Multiple distinct products can be simultaneously amplified by RT-LAMP in the same tube by

227

providing the appropriate primer sets in multiplex, as we demonstrated above by co-amplifying

228

N2 and STATH in the same COV-ID reaction (see Fig. 2). In fact, simultaneous detection of

229

SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus by RT-LAMP was previously achieved, albeit in a fluorescent-

230

based, low-throughput type of assay34. We reasoned that the sequencing-based readout of COV-

231

ID would allow extending this approach to the simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens as

232

well as endogenous (host mRNA) and artificial (spike-in) calibration standards, all in a single

233

reaction.

234

To test the ability of COV-ID to simultaneously detect multiple viral templates, we selected and

235

validated a generic “flu” RT-LAMP primer set that recognizes several strains, including influenza

236

A virus (IAV) and influenza B34, 35, and modified the BIP and FIP sequence to introduce the COV-

237

ID barcodes and handles for PCR (Fig. S2D and Table S1). We added inactivated SARS-CoV-2

238

virus (BEI resources) and IAV strain H1N1 RNA (Twist Biosciences) to saliva according to a 3 x

239

4 matrix of (104, 103, or 0 copies per µL) SARS-CoV-2 RNA against H1N1 RNA (105, 104, 103, or

240

0 copies per µL) (Fig. 3A), as well as the N2 spike-in control. We performed multiplex COV-ID on

241

these samples using primers sets for STATH, N2 (to detect SARS-CoV-2), and IAV (to detect

242

H1N1) and sequenced to an average depth of 21,000 reads per sample. Both H1N1 and SARS-

243

CoV-2 were detected above background and the signal correlated with the amount of the

244

respective template added to saliva (Fig. 3B–C). Overall, multiplex COV-ID correctly identified

245

samples that contained only SARS-CoV-2 (7/8) or H1N1 (6/8). For samples that contained both

246

pathogens we observed reduced sensitivity (11/16 identification of both pathogens), which was

247

also observed in a previous multiplexing attempt34. However, in practice individuals who are

248

simultaneously infected with both viruses presumably would be rare, and for these cases the

249

ability to detect at least one virus successfully would allow to follow up with further diagnostic

250

testing. We found that of the samples containing both viruses, 16/16 showed positive detection of

251

at least one pathogen (SARS-CoV-2 or H1N1), suggesting the reduced sensitivity of the multiplex

252

assay is due to interference between amplification of both viral templates. This also demonstrates

253

that COV-ID can be used as an effective screening approach for multiple viral templates.

255

Paper-based saliva sampling for COV-ID

256

As an additional step toward increasing the throughput of the COV-ID approach, we explored

257

avenues to simplify collection, lower costs, and expedite processing time. Absorbent paper is an

258

attractive alternative to sample vials for collection, given its low cost, wide availability, and smaller

259

environmental footprint. In fact, paper has been used as a means to isolate nucleic acid from

260

biological samples for direct RT-PCR testing36 as well as RT-LAMP37, 38.

261

We sought to determine whether the COV-ID workflow would be compatible with saliva collection

262

on absorbent paper. First, we immersed a small square of Whatman filter paper into water

263

containing various dilutions of inactivated SARS-CoV-2. After 2 min, the paper was removed and

264

transferred to PCR strip tubes followed by heating at 95ºC for 5 minutes to air-dry the sample

265

(Fig. 4A). Next, we added the RT-LAMP mix containing the N2 COV-ID primer set directly to the

266

tubes containing the paper squares and let the reaction proceed in the usual conditions. COV-ID

267

PCR products of the correct size were evident in all samples containing viral RNA, with sensitivity

268

of at least 100 virions / μL (Fig. 4B) and in none of the controls, demonstrating that the presence

269

of paper does not interfere with the RT-LAMP reaction and subsequent PCR amplification with

270

Illumina adapters.

271

To assay direct COV-ID detection from saliva on paper, we saturated Whatman filter paper

272

squares with saliva containing different amounts of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus, which, we

273

reasoned, would be equivalent to a patient collecting their own saliva by chewing on a small piece

274

of absorbent paper. Next, we placed the paper squares into reaction tubes containing

275

TCEP/EDTA inactivation buffer (see Methods) similar to that used for the in-solution samples

276

used in our previous experiments (see Fig. 1A). We dried the paper at 95ºC and performed RT-

277

LAMP followed by PCR (Fig. 4C), which resulted in the appearance of COV-ID products of the

278

correct size starting from saliva spiked with as few as 50 virions / μL (Fig. 4D). We then performed

279

COV-ID sequencing on saliva collected on paper using primers N2 and STATH in the presence

280

of the N2 spike-in RNA. The sequence data showed more variability and limited coverage of the

control amplicons compared to in-solution COV-ID likely due to the more challenging reaction

282

conditions; therefore, we normalized viral reads using both STATH and spike-in. This paper-

283

based COV-ID proof-of-principle experiment detected the presence of viral RNA in samples with

284

as little as 320 copies / µL (Fig. 4E), a lower sensitivity compared to that of in-solution COV-ID

285

but still well within the useful range39 to detect infections.

286

Taken together, these data show that the RT-LAMP step of COV-ID is compatible with the

289

thousands of saliva samples for multiple pathogens (Fig. 4F).

290

DISCUSSION

291

Testing strategies are vital to an effective public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic,

292

particularly with the spread of the disease by asymptomatic individuals. An ongoing challenge to

293

COVID-19 testing is the need for massive testing strategies for population-level surveillance that

294

are needed for efficient contact tracing and isolation. Most FDA-approved clinical SARS-CoV-2

295

diagnostic tests are based on time-consuming and expensive protocols that include RNA

296

purifications and RT-PCR32 and must be performed by trained personnel in well-equipped

297

laboratories. Point-of-care antigen tests provide a much faster turnaround time and require little

298

manipulation, but there remains limited data on their specificity in real-world applications40.

299

Because of reagent limitations and diagnostic testing bottlenecks, prioritization of COVID

300

diagnostic testing continues to be for symptomatic individuals and individuals who are particularly

301

vulnerable for infection after exposure41. Private organizations, including colleges and

302

universities, have circumvented some of these challenges by contracting with private laboratories

303

to establish asymptomatic surveillance testing protocols; this is a costly option for population-level

304

surveilling of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.

305

Several effective COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and there is a concerted ongoing

306

global vaccination effort, providing a concrete means to end the pandemic. Despite this progress

307

there are several potential risks that require vigilance: possible COVID-19 transmission in

308

vaccinated individuals, emergence of vaccine-resistant viral variants, and public skepticism of

309

vaccines or faltering compliance with social distancing guidelines42. For these reasons ongoing

310

testing and surveillance efforts will remain important for the foreseeable future, both to monitor

311

the progress of vaccination in reducing symptomatic cases and to detect emerging variants.

312

In order to scale testing to an effective volume and frequency, surveillance tests must

313

demonstrate the following qualities: 1) sensitivity, to identify both asymptomatic and symptomatic

314

carriers; 2) simplicity in methodology, to be performed in a number of traditional diagnostic

315

laboratories, without specialized equipment; 3) low cost and easily accessible reagents; 4) ease

316

of collection method; 5) rapid turnaround time to allow for isolation and contract tracing; and 6)

317

ability to co-detect multiple respiratory viruses, given the overlap in patient symptoms. To this

318

end, we have developed COV-ID, an RT-LAMP-based parallel sequencing SARS-CoV-2

10

319

detection method that can provide results from tens of thousands of samples per day at relatively

320

low cost to simultaneously detect multiple respiratory viruses.

321

COV-ID features several key innovations that make it well-suited to high-throughput testing. First,

322

COV-ID uses a two-dimensional barcoding strategy8, where the same 96 barcodes are used in

323

each RT-LAMP plate, making it possible to pre-aliquot barcodes in 96-well plates ahead of time

324

and store them at -20ºC, simplifying execution of the assay and shortening turnaround times.

325

Second, since RT-LAMP does not require thermal cycling, tens of thousands of samples can be

326

run simultaneously in a standard benchtop-sized incubator or hybridization oven held at 65ºC.

327

Third, individual samples are pooled immediately following RT-LAMP; therefore, a single

328

thermocycler has the potential to process up to 96 or 384 RT-LAMP plates, generating 9,216 or

329

36,864 individually barcoded samples, respectively (Fig. 1A, 4F, 4G). Only 96 unique FIP

330

barcodes are required for this scaling; here, we show that 28 out of 32 LAMP barcodes tested

331

were functional for both N2 and STATH. This proof-of-principle experiment demonstrates the

332

feasibility of generating the library of barcodes required to apply COV-ID to a large population. An

333

additional advantage of sequencing-based approaches, such as COV-ID is that with carefully

334

designed primers it would be possible to recover information about viral variants directly from the

335

sequencing reads43. Finally, COV-ID can generate ready-to-sequence libraries directly from saliva

336

absorbed onto filter paper, which would allow for major streamlining of the often-challenging

337

logistical process of sample collection (Fig. 4). Thus, COV-ID libraries for thousands and tens of

338

thousands of samples can be generated with relatively minimum effort in biological laboratories

339

with basic equipment and easily accessible reagents.

340

With the average throughput of an Illumina NextSeq 500/550, a relatively affordable next-

341

generation sequencer up to 9,216 (96 RT-LAMPs x 96 pools) can be sequenced at a depth of

342

~48,000 reads per sample, and up to 36,864 (96 RT-LAMPs x 384 pools) can be sequenced at a

343

depth of ~12,000 reads, which, we showed, is more than sufficient to obtain information about

344

multiple viral and control amplicons. Considering that reagents for one NextSeq run cost ~1,500

345

U.S. dollars, the theoretical sequencing cost per sample could be as low as $0.04 (Fig. 4G). While

346

sequencing instruments are relatively specialized and not ubiquitous, amplified COV-ID DNA

347

libraries could be shipped to remote facilities for sequencing in a cost-effective manner as

348

previously proposed by the inventors of LAMP-seq14. Finally, because of the limited sequence

349

space against which reads must be aligned, computational analysis of the resulting data can be

350

performed in a matter of minutes with optimized pipelines, providing results shortly after the

351

sequencing run has completed.

352

COV-ID has sensitivity of 5–10 virions of SARS-CoV-2 per μL in contrived saliva samples (Fig.

353

2D) and at least 300 virions / μL in saliva collected from patients in a clinical setting (Fig. 2E).

354

However, this was sufficient to properly classify 100% of the clinical samples analyzed, given that

355

all positive samples had an estimated viral load > 300 virions / µL. Importantly, this was also the

356

apparent limit of sensitivity of paper-based COV-ID (Fig. 4E), suggesting that even in these

357

settings COV-ID would be capable of accurately classifying the majority of patient-derived

358

samples.

359

In conclusion, COV-ID is a flexible platform that can be executed at varying levels of scale with

360

additional flexibility in sample input, making it an attractive platform for surveillance testing.

361

Population-level monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infections will be critical while vaccines are being

362

distributed to the global population, and continued surveillance will likely remain an effective

363

strategy to protect immune-compromised and unvaccinated members in society and within

364

entities and organizations where regular monitoring is critical to social isolation strategies. To that

365

end, effective, low-cost, multiplexed, and readily-implementable strategies for surveillance

366

testing, such as COV-ID, are important to mitigate the effects of the current and future pandemics.

367

METHODS

368

RT-LAMP primer design

369

Primers against ACTB were designed using PrimerExplorerV5 (https://primerexplorer.jp/e/) using

370

default parameters and including loop primers (Table S1).

371

For COV-ID, priming sequences for PCR were inserted in FIP and BIP primers between the target

372

homology regions (F1c and F2, and B1c and B2, respectively, see Fig. S1). After testing, we

373

determined that 12 nts and 11 nts were most effective for the P5 and P7 binding regions,

374

respectively, being the shortest insertion that allowed reliable PCR amplification from LAMP

375

products without impacting LAMP efficiency. In addition a 5 nt barcode sequence was inserted at

376

the immediate 3’ end of the P5-binding region of the FIP primer.

377

LAMP barcode design

378

Starting from the total possible 1,024 unique 5-nt barcodes, we removed those that matched any

379

sequence within the RT-LAMP primers used in this study (Table S1) in either sense or anti-sense

380

orientation. From the remaining pool, we selected 32 barcodes with hamming distance of at least

381

2 between all candidates. We tested FIPs incorporating candidate barcodes for ACTB, STATH,

382

N2, and IAV primer sets on saliva RT-LAMP with 1,000 copies target amplicon. Primers that failed

383

to show LAMP signal by real time fluorescence monitoring or generate expected PCR product

384

were discarded. Final usable barcodes are provided in (Table S2).

385

Saliva preparation

386

We prepared 100x TCEP/EDTA buffer (250 mM TCEP, 100 mM EDTA, 1.15 N NaOH)

387

TCEP/EDTA buffer was added to human saliva at 1:100 volume, then samples were capped,

388

vortexed to mix and heated in a thermocycler (95ºC 5 min, 4ºC hold) until ready to use for RT-

389

LAMP. When indicated, heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (BEI Resources Cat. NR-52286) or H1N1

390

genomic RNA (Twist Biosciences Cat. 103001) was added to inactivated saliva prior to RT-LAMP.

391

N2 spike-in synthesis

392

To prepare the in vitro transcription template for SARS-CoV-2 N2 spike-in RNA, we performed

393

RT-PCR using Power SYBR RNA-to-Ct kit (Thermo Cat. 4389986) of heat inactivated SARS-

394

CoV-2 (BEI Resources Cat. NR-52286) using the following primers: N2-B3 and N2-spike-T7 S.

395

PCR product was purified and used as a template for in vitro transcription using HiScribe T7

396

transcription kit (NEB Cat. E2040S). RNA was purified with Trizol (Thermo Cat. 15596026),

397

quantified via A260, then aliquoted in BTE buffer (10 mM bis-tris pH 6.7, 1 mM EDTA) and stored

398

at -80ºC. Primers used and final spike-in sequence are provided in Table S1.

399

RT-LAMP

400

All RT-LAMP reactions were set up in clean laminar flow hoods and all steps before and after

401

LAMP were carried out in separate lab spaces to avoid contamination. RT-LAMP reactions were

402

set up on ice as follow: for each amplicon 5 or 6 LAMP primers were combined into 10x working

403

stock at established concentrations: 16 μM FIP, 16 μM BIP, 4 μM LF, 4 μM LB, 2 μM F3, 2 μM

404

B3. For multiplexed COV-ID reactions 10x working primer mixes for each amplicon were either

405

added proportionally so that the total primer content remained constant, or mixed so that BIP and

406

FIP primers were scaled down depending on amplicon number while remaining primers (LF

407

and/or LB, F3, B3) were kept at same concentration as in single reactions.

408

Each 10 μL RT-LAMP reaction mix consisted of 1x Warmstart LAMP 2x Master Mix (NEB Cat.

409

E1700S), 0.7 μM dUTP (Promega Cat. U1191), 1 μM SYTO-9 (Thermo Cat. S34854), 0.1 μL

410

Thermolabile UDG (Enzymatics Cat. G5020L), 1 μL of saliva template and optionally 20 fg of N2

411

Spike RNA. Reactions were prepared in qPCR plates or 8-well strip tubes, sealed, vortexed and

412

centrifuged briefly, then incubated in either a QuantStudio Flex 7 or StepOnePlus instrument

413

(Thermo) for 65ºC 1 hr. Real-time fluorescence measurements were recorded every 30 sec to

414

monitor reaction progress but were not used for data analysis. Following LAMP the reactions were

415

heated at 95ºC 5 min to inactivate LAMP enzymes.

416

Library construction by PCR amplification

417

All post-LAMP steps were carried out on a clean bench separate from LAMP reagents and

418

workspace. For individual LAMP samples, LAMP amplicons were diluted either 1:100 or 1:1,000

419

in water. For pooling of individually barcoded LAMP reactions, equal amounts of all LAMP

420

reactions were combined and then either diluted 1:1000 or purified via SPRIselect beads

421

(Beckman Coulter Cat. B23317) using a bead-to-reaction ratio of 0.1x. Purified material was

422

diluted to final 100-fold dilution relative to LAMP.

423

1 μL of diluted LAMP material was used as a template for PCR using OneTaq DNA polymerase

424

(NEB Cat. M0480L) with 100 nM each of custom dual-indexed Illumina P5 and P7 primers in

425

either 10 or 25 μL reaction (Table S1). PCR reactions were incubated as follows: (25 cycles of

426

stage 1 [94ºC x 15 sec, 45ºC x 15 sec, 68ºC x 10 sec], 10 cycles of Stage 2 [ 94ºC x 15 sec, 68ºC

427

x 10 sec], 68ºC x 1 min, 4ºC x ∞). Note, for initial pilot COV-ID and clinical sample experiments

428

(Fig. 2D–E, Fig. S2C) PCR incubation was performed as above with modification: [Stage 1 x 10

429

cycles, Stage 2 x 25 cycles].

430

PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gel to confirm library size, then all were pooled and

431

purified via MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen Cat. 28004) and quantified using either Qubit

432

dsDNA High Sensitivity kit (Thermo Cat. Q32851) or Kapa Library Quantification Kit for Illumina

433

(Kapa Cat. 07960140001).

434

Human samples

435

Clinical saliva samples used for Fig. 2E were obtained and characterized as part of a separate

436

study at the University of Pennsylvania44 and collected under Institutional Review Board (IRB)-

437

approved protocols (IRB protocol #842613 and #813913). Briefly, salivary samples were collected

438

from possible SARS-CoV-2 positive patients at one of three locations: (1) Penn Presbyterian

439

Medical Center Emergency Department, (2) Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania

440

Emergency Department, and (3) Penn Medicine COVID-19 ambulatory testing center. Inclusion

coordinator, patients were instructed to self-collect saliva into a sterile specimen container which

445

was then placed on ice until further processing for analysis.

446

The saliva used in the remaining experiments was donated by one of the authors. Because it was

447

only used for protocol optimization the Penn IRB has determined that it did not constitute human

448

subjects research and therefore approval was not required.

449

Paper COV-ID

450

Squares of Whatman no. 1 filter paper (2 mm x 2 mm) were cut using a scalpel on a clean surface

451

under a laminar flow hood and stored at room temperature until used. Using ethanol-sterilized

452

fine-nosed tweezers a single square was dipped twice into unprocessed, freshly collected saliva

453

with or without added SARS-CoV-2 (BEI Resources Cat. NR-52286) until saliva was saturated on

454

paper by eye. Paper was then transferred to well of 96-well plate containing 10 ul of 1x

455

TCEP/EDTA buffer (2.5 mM TCEP, 1 mM EDTA, 1.15 NaOH). Plate was placed on heat block

456

inside laminar flow hood or inside open thermocycler and incubated at 95ºC x 10 min.

457

10 ul RT-LAMP mixture was prepared as described above in the absence of the N2 Spike RNA.

458

10 ul of RT-LAMP reaction mixture was added to each paper strip, then plate was sealed and

459

incubated 65ºC x 1 hr, 95ºC x 5 min in QuantStudio Flex 7 (Thermo). 1 ul of each reaction was

460

either diluted 1:100 or purified via SPRIselect beads and PCR amplified as described above.

461

Sequencing

462

Libraries were sequenced on one of the following Illumina instruments: MiSeq, NextSeq 500,

463

NextSeq 550, NovaSeq 6000 and sequenced using single end programs with a minimum of 40

464

cycles on Read 1 and 8 cycles for index 1 (on P7) and index 2 (on P5).

465

Sequence Analysis

466

Reads were filtered for optical quality using FASTX-toolkit utility fastq_quality_filter

467

(http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/), then cutadapt45 was used to remove adapters and

468

demultiplex LAMP barcodes. Reads were aligned to a custom index containing SARS-CoV-2

469

genome (NC_045512.2), Influenza H1N1 coding sequences (NC_026431.1, NC_026432.1,

470

NC_026433.1, NC_026434.1, NC_026435.1, NC_026436.1, NC_026437.1, NC_026438.1),

471

STATH coding sequence (NM_003154.3), and custom N2 spike sequence (Table S3) ,target

472

sequences using bowtie246 with options --no-unal and --end-to-end. Alignments with greater than

473

1 mismatch were removed and the number of reads mapping to each target for all barcodes were

474

extracted and output in a matrix. Barcodes with fewer than 25 total mapped reads were discarded.

Figure 1. Barcoding and PCR amplification of RT-LAMP products

594

(A) Overview of COV-ID. Saliva is collected and inactivated prior to RT-LAMP performed with up

595

to 96 individual sample barcoded primers. LAMP reactions are pooled and further amplified via

596

PCR to introduce Illumina adapter sequences and pool-level dual indexes. A single thermal cycler

597

can amplify 96 or 384 such pools and the resulting “super-pool” can be sequenced overnight to

598

detect multiple amplicons from 9,216 or 36,864 individual patient samples (number of reads in

599

parenthesis assume an output of ~450M reads from a NextSeq 500).

600

(B) Schematic of the RT-LAMP (step I) of COV-ID. Selected numbered intermediates of RT-LAMP

601

reaction are shown to illustrate how the LAMP barcode, shown in yellow, and the P5 and P7

602

homology sequences (blue and pink, respectively) are introduced in the final LAMP product. Upon

603

generating the dumb-bell intermediate the reaction proceeds through rapid primed and self-

604

primed extensions to form a mixture of various DNA amplicons containing sequences for PCR

605

amplification. A more detailed version of the LAMP phase of COV-ID, including specific

606

sequences, is illustrated in Fig. S1.

607

(C) Conventional RT-LAMP primers (solid lines) or primers modified for COV-ID (dotted lines)

608

were used for RT-LAMP of SARS-CoV-2. The numbers of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virions per

609

µL is indicated in the color legend.

610

(D) Schematic of the PCR (step II) of COV-ID. Following RT-LAMP, up to 96 reactions are pooled

611

and purified and Illumina libraries are generated directly by PCR with dual-indexed P5 and P7

612

adapters in preparation for sequencing.

613

(E) COV-ID primers targeting ACTB mRNA were used for RT-LAMP with HeLa total RNA. LAMP

614

was diluted 1:100, amplified via PCR and resolved on 2% agarose gel.

637

shown in (A) in the presence of 20 femtograms synthetic N2 spike-in using N2, influenza34 and

638

STATH COV-ID primers. N2/(N2 Spike + 1) and influenza/(STATH + 1) read ratios are displayed

Figure 4. COV-ID on saliva collected on paper
(A) Scheme for COV-ID on viral RNA absorbed on paper.
(B) PCR reactions from paper samples immersed in water with indicated viral concentrations then amplified with N2
COV-ID primers.
(C) Scheme for COV-ID on saliva spiked with viral and RNA and absorbed on paper.
(D) Same as (B) but on saliva absorbed on paper.
(E) SARS-CoV-2 virus was added to saliva and prepared as in (C). RT-LAMP and sequencing was carried out in
presence of SARS spike-in RNA. Viral reads are presented as ratio against the sum of STATH and N2 spike-in reads.
Positive threshold was set as 2x maximum value in negative saliva and indicated by dashed horizontal line.
(F–G): Paper-based COV-ID workflow (F) and cost calculations (G). Saliva is collected orally on a precut strip of
paper, from which a 2 mm square would be cut out and added to a reaction vessel containing TCEP/EDTA
inactivation buffer and processed as shown in (C).

Figure S2. Optimization of COV-ID in human saliva
(A) Saliva COV-ID sequence validation. Single saliva COV-ID reaction using N2 primers was sequenced by the Sanger method.
(B) Validation of control human amplicons for RT-LAMP on saliva. RT-LAMP of TCEP/EDTA inactivated saliva was performed
with conventional RT-LAMP primer sets for ACTB and STATH in the presence or absence of RNase A.
(C) Characterization of COV-ID sequencing libraries. Breakdown of reads for sequence data presented in Fig. 2D. Samples
without added template consist of predominantly adapter dimers.
(D) Validation of COV-ID LAMP barcodes. 32 potential barcodes were tested for LAMP primer sets indicated, incompatible
barcodes are marked in red.
(E) Validation of pooled PCR. COV-ID was performed on saliva samples using unique LAMP barcodes. The RT-LAMP reactions
were then amplified either by individual PCR or by first pooling and then performing a single PCR on the pool.
