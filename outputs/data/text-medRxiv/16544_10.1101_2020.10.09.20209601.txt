Cleaning and Re-Use of cobas® 6800/8800 Processing Plates for the
SARS-CoV-2 Assay
Matt Sperling, Ryan Relich, Bryan Schmitt, Drew Bell, Lauren Cooper

Abstract: Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the primary
method used for the detection and diagnosis of infections caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since SARS-CoV-2’s entrance into the United States,
numerous clinical laboratories and in vitro diagnostic companies have developed rRT-PCR
assays, some requiring specialized materials and reagents. One such assay includes the cobas®
SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative Assay for use on the cobas® 6800/8800 (Roche Molecular Systems,
Inc.). Since initiation of this assay at our facility, our ability to run testing at full capacity has
been limited due to restricted supply of the omni cobas® Processing Plate (Product Number
05534917001), a 96 deep well plate used for all sample processing and total nucleic acid
extraction via MagNA Pure magnetic beads. To work around this limiting factor, we have
successfully designed and tested a cleaning protocol utilizing the widely available laboratory
resources of bleach, ethyl-alcohol and autoclaving, for omni cobas® Processing Plate re-use.

Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative
agent of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), is a positive single stranded RNA virus (+ ssRNA)1.
Due to the nature of the virus’ nucleic acid, as well as the speed, sensitivity and specificity of
molecular diagnostics, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is
the primary method used for the detection and diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Beginning in March
of 2020, numerous SARS-CoV-2 rapid tests received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative
Assay for use on the cobas® 6800/8800 (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.)2,3. Due to the
overwhelming demand for testing reagents and consumables, governments, international
agencies, health systems and in vitro diagnostic (IVD) companies, including Roche, have had to
resort to resource allocation4.
At our institution, Indiana University Health (Indianapolis, IN, USA), one specific component of
the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative Assay was identified as our test capacity limiting factor,
the omni cobas® Processing Plates (Product Number 05534917001). This processing plate is a
96 compartment, deep well plate used for sample processing and total nucleic acid extraction via
MagNA Pure magnetic beads, specific for the cobas® 6800/8800. Several factors played into this
product being a constraining factor: national medical grade plastic shortage resulting in strict
allocation by Roche, continued need for the use of other assays on the cobas® 6800/8800 which
also require the same processing plates, and cobas® automatic disposal and, therefore loss of
processing plates in the event of run failure.
To work around this issue, we devised and tested a cleaning process for the re-use of omni
cobas® Processing Plates. A few considerations were made in designing the cleaning process.

First, since + ssRNA is directly infectious, safety was a primary focus. Second, we wanted to
ensure that no residual viral nucleic acid remained in the processing plate after the cleaning
protocol. Lastly, we wanted to assure that the cleaning process did not impair future use,
including extraction of viral nucleic acid, or introduction of PCR inhibition from the processing
plate. Grounded in these considerations, we have successfully designed and tested a cleaning
protocol for omni cobas® Processing Plates that utilizes a BSII hood, bleach, ethyl-alcohol and
autoclaving that allows for reuse with the SARS-CoV-2 assay.

Methods:
Soaking of Processing Plates
Processing plates were retrieved from the waste bins onboard the cobas® 6800/8800 and brought
under the BSII hood for processing. Plates were fully submerged in a 20% bleach solution in a
nonreactive plastic storage container with strips of magnets (LOVIMAG, Product Number
BAR8P) adhered to the side of the container to limit the movement of residual magnetic beads in
the solution. Plates were soaked for at least 20 and up to30 minutes.
Rinsing of Processing Plates
Next, a 10% bleach solution in a squeeze bottle was used to fill each well of the processing plate,
and a transfer pipet was used to remove bleach solution and residual magnetic beads from the
wells. This step was then repeated once. Lastly, a 10% bleach solution was placed into a nonreactive plastic container and the processing plates were fully submerged for two minutes. Next,
a transfer pipette was used to remove any dried magnetic beads from the processing plate wells.
Once complete, the processing plate was drained and placed upon a lint-free WypAll®
(Kimberly Clark Worldwide, Inc.) towel until dry.
Removal of Remnant Bleach
To remove any remnant bleach from the processing plates, 95% ethanol was used to fill the wells
and cover the top of the processing plates. A transfer pipet was then used to remove all ethanol
and plates were wrapped with a lint-free WypAll® (Kimberly Clark Worldwide, Inc.) towel and
knocked 5 times on the tabletop to remove as much residual ethanol was possible. Plates were
then left to air dry.
Autoclaving
To shield from degradation during the autoclaving processes, processing plate barcodes were
painted with clear nail polish and left to air dry. Next, a total of four processing plates were
placed in a 12” x 18” autoclave pouch, insuring barcodes on the processing plates were facing
inwards. Autoclave bags with processing plates were then autoclaved for 40 min at 121°C to
both deactivate residual bleach and to sterilize the processing plates. Once the plates were
removed from the autoclave and cooled to room temperature, any barcodes deemed to be too
damaged for reading were replaced with re-printed barcodes affixed overtop with cellophane
tape. Additionally, all plates were marked to denote the number of autoclave cycles it had

encountered; for this study, a single processing plate was allowed three autoclave cycles before
being discarded.
Validation of Cleaning Processes
Four processing plates previously used to test patient samples for SARS-CoV-2 were cleaned by
the above protocol. Hyclone™ (Cytiva Life Sciences, LLC.) molecular grade water samples
were then run on the cleaned plates to determine if any residual nucleic acid remained after
cleaning. For this assessment, we would expect all “water only” samples to be negative for
SARS-CoV-2 specific targets (targets 1 and 2). Additionally, four positive patient samples and
all sample internal control (IC) cycle threshold (Ct) values were evaluated for extraction
inhibition due to the cleaning process. If extraction inhibition were to occur, we would expect
significant Ct value increases in the SARS-CoV-2 specific targets for the positive patient
samples, and significant increases in the IC Ct values for all sample types, including “water
only”.

Statistical Analysis
A two-sample t-test was used to calculate the p-value of IC Ct values before and after the above
processing plate cleaning protocol.

Results: SARS-CoV-2 detection in patient samples using four processing plates, prior to
cleaning, can be found on Table 1. In total, 194 samples were tested over four unique processing
plates where each plate had its own positive and negative control. Overall, 138 (74.19%) of
patient samples were negative, 39 (20.97%) were positive, 8 (4.30%) were inconclusive (only
target 2 was identified), and 1 (0.54%) was invalid (no internal control was identified)3.
After performing the above cleaning protocol, the same four unique processing plates were run
with positive and negative controls on each plate—all of which resulted as expected—and a total
of 99 “water only” samples (Table 2). Ninety-eight (98.99%) “water only” samples resulted
“negative” while a single sample (1.01%) resulted “invalid”. No significant differences in
internal control Ct values were noted (p≤0.001). Additionally, using one of the four plates, four
positive patient samples from Table 1 were rerun after the cleaning process and changes in the Ct
values for SARS-CoV-2 specific were calculated (Figure 1).

Summary: The goal of this study was to design and test a cleaning protocol for omni cobas®
Processing Plates that was safe, resulted in no residual viral nucleic acid carryover, and did not
inhibit nucleic acid extraction. From these data, we show that four processing plates used in
patient sample testing resulted in a mixture of positive (n=39), negative (138), inconclusive (8),
and invalid (1) patient samples, along with positive and negative controls for each plate (Table
1). During the re-use of these same four plates, the “water only” samples (n=99) show that no
measurable nucleic acid survived the above cleaning process (Table 2). In addition, no

measurable changes occurred between the IC Ct values for samples from before and after
cleaning (p ≤0.001). Lastly, we show that changes with SARS-CoV-2 specific targets from
positive patient samples both before and after processing plate cleaning are within the normal
range of precision variation3.
As CoVID-19 overwhelms healthcare systems around the world, hospitals, laboratories,
collection centers are confronting shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE), test kits,
ventilators, and more. To meet these challenges, as health care providers, we must prioritize
conserving, substituting, adapting, re-using and re-allocating what resources we do have.
Examples of meeting challenges has been displayed in many ways over the last few months
including: using a single swab for both NP and oropharyngeal specimen collection, institutions
preparing their own viral or universal transport media, 3D printing of nasopharyngeal swabs,
ventilator parts, and various PPE, and the re-use of single-use, disposable PPE5–7.
However, it should be stated that even when laboratory supplies reach a “non-critical” level, it
should be a priority of all laboratories to reduce its dependence on single-use plastics. In 2015, a
study was done that suggests research laboratories alone produces over 5.5 million metric tons of
plastic waste a year8. Although finding ways to conserve, substitute and re-use biohazard
laboratory waste can be difficult, there are several ways that working with commercial suppliers
can impact how much waste a laboratory produces. First, suppliers could allow for more bulk
orders to decrease the need for excess packaging, authorize packaging to be sent back for re-use,
supply laboratories with cleaning protocols for re-use of “single-use” items, and allow for the
return of “single-use” items for recycling. Additionally, laboratories could find additional uses
for leftover packaging, conserve plastic use where able, switch to glass containers and tools, and
develop their own protocols for cleaning “single-use” items.
