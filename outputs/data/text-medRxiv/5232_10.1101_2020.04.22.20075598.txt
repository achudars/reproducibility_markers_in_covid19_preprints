ABSTRACT
Systematic testing of large population groups by RT-PCR is mandatory to Covid-19
case identification and contact tracing in order to minimize the likelyhood of resurgence
in contagion. Sample pooling for RT-PCR has been effectively used to detect
community transmission of SARS CoV-2. Nevertheless, this procedure may decrease
the sensitivity of RT-PCR assays due to specimen dilution. We evaluated the efficacy of
this strategy for diagnosis of Covid-19 using a sensitive commercially-available RTPCR targeting SARS CoV-2 E and RdRp genes in a single reaction. A total of 20 minipools containing either 5 (n=10) or 10 (n=10) nasopharyngeal exudates collected in
universal transport medium were made, each of which including a unique positive NP
specimen. Positive specimens yielding CT <32 for the E gene (6 out of 10) or <35.2 for
the RdRP gene (7 out of 10) were detected in mini-pools of both sizes. In contrast, most
NP samples displaying CTs > 35.8 for the E gene or 35.7 for the RdRP gene remained
undetected in mini-pools of 5 specimens (3/4 and 2/3, respectively) or in mini-pools of
10 samples (4/4 and 3/3, respectively.

Until an effective vaccine is available, interruption of community circulation of SARS
CoV-2 is crucial to control virus spread. To this end, systematic testing of large
population groups by RT-PCR is mandatory to case identification and contact tracing
thereby minimizing the likelyhood of resurgence in contagion.1 This approach faces a
variety of obstacles, most notably the limited availability of reagents resources. Sample
pooling for RT-PCR has been effectively used for screening of blood donors for Human
immunodeficiency virus-1 and Hepatitis C virus in low-prevalence setttings.2 This
strategy has also been applied to detect community transmission of SARS CoV-2 in the
United States early in the pandemic, when virus circulation was low.3 Nevertheless,
sample pooling may decrease the sensitivity of RT-PCR assays due to specimen
dilution. Here, the efficacy of this strategy for diagnosis of Covid-19 was evaluated
using a sensitive commercially-available RT-PCR (REALQUALITY RQ-2019-nCoV
from AB ANALITICA; Padua, Italy, performed on the Applied Biosystems 7500
instrument), and low-size mini-pools. This RT-PCR assay targets the E (envelope) and
RdRp (RNA dependent RNA polymerase) genes of SARS Cov-2 in a single reaction,
with LODs of 125 and 150 copies/ml, respectively (according to the manufacturer). The
current study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital Clínico Universitario
INCLIVA.
Nasopharyngeal specimens (NP) collected with flocked swabs in 3 ml of universal
transport medium (Beckton Dickinson, Sparks, MD,USA), which had been stored at 80ºC, were retrieved for analysis. A total of 30 leftover specimens testing negative for
SARS CoV-2 were mixed and used for pooling. In turn, 10 RT-PCR positive NP
specimens yielding cycle threshold values (CT) ranging from 23.4 to 38.8 for the E
gene, and 21.8 to 35.8 for the RdRP gene were selected for the experiments. A total of

20 mini-pools containing either 5 (n=10) or 10 (n=10) samples were made, each of
which including a unique positive NP specimen (Table 1). These latter specimens had
been collected from adult patients (median age, 61.5 years; range, 30-85) presenting
with mild disease and not requiring hospitalization, at a median of 5 days (range, 1-7
days) following appearance of symptoms. Pertinent to this study is the fact that SARS
CoV-2 load in upper respiratory tract specimens from symptomatic patients peaks
within the first week after infection.4,5
As shown in Table 1, positive NP specimens were detected in mini-pools of both sizes,
as long undiluted samples yielded RT-PCR CTs <32 for the E gene (6 out of 10) or
<35.2 for the RdRp gene (7 out of 10). As expected CTs were reached later in pooled
samples. In contrast, most NP samples displaying RT-PCR CTs > 35.8 for the E gene or
35.7 for the RdRP gene remained undetected in mini-pools of 5 specimens (3/4 and 2/3,
respectively) or in mini-pools of 10 samples (4/4 and 3/3, respectively).
Comprehensive testing policies in the community are primarily aimed at identifying
SARS CoV-2-infected asymptomathic or paucisymptomatic individuals, who are known
to represent a major source of transmission.1 Pooling strategies of RT-PCR testing may
be advantageous when compared to assaying individuals samples separately if the
proportion of positive specimens in the set of samples is low enough (~1%)6. Previously
reported data suggested that a single positive specimen could be detected in pools of up
to 32 samples5, with a false negative rate of around 10%. In this work, pure RNA
instead of original specimens were pooled for RT-PCR reactions.6 Likewise,
identification of cases was achieved in pools of 48 samples including 1-5 RT-PCR
positive samples. Our experience was less satisfactory, yet, positive specimens that
went undetected when tested in pools presumably had very low viral loads, as inferred
by RT-PCR CT values, most likely <6 log10 RNA copies/swab, which was shown to

represent the viral RNA load threshold for virus infectivity9; thus, missing such type of
positive results may have little consequences, if any, in terms of public health. It should
mentioned that the efficiency of our approach may have been improved had fresh
specimens been used for analyses, since degradation of RNA in samples during storage
or thawing could have occurred. In summary, our data indicated that pooling NP
specimens for RT-PCR testing may result in false negative results in patients presenting
with mild Covid-19. The procedure evaluated herein can be improved by collecting
samples in a smaller volumen of transport medium or increasing the number of RT-PCR
cycles. Given the important benefit in terms of reagent savings inherent to this strategy,
further studies are warranted to appraise its applicability in routine community surveys.

A volumen of 45 and 22.5 µL/specimen was used for preparing (manually) minipools of 5 and 10 samples, respectively, to achieve a final volumen of 225 µL,
which was then mixed (1:1) with lysis buffer. RNA extraction was performed
using the DSP virus Pathogen Minikit on the QiaSymphony Robot instrument
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). RT-PCR was performed and interpreted according
to the manufacturer instructions.
