Abstract
Importance: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of risk factors presaging the
development of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. It is a risk factor for severe coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Objective: To estimate the prevalence of MetS in the US National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2018.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included 22370 eligible participants
aged ≥20 years from the NHANES 2011-2018.
Main Outcome and Measure: MetS was defined as the presence of at least three of these
components: central obesity, reduced high-density lipoprotein, elevated triglycerides,
elevated blood pressure and elevated fasting blood glucose. The prevalence of MetS was
estimated taking into account the complex sampling. The time trend was evaluated using
logistic regression. Annual percentage changes (APC) were used to measure the trends in
MetS prevalence.
Results: The prevalence of MetS was 36.2% (95% CI, 32.3-40.3), 34.8% (95% CI, 32.337.4), 39.9% (95% CI, 36.6-43.2) and 38.3% (95% CI, 35.3-41.3) in 2011-2, 2013-4, 2015-6,
2017-8, respectively (P for trend =.08). Among the MetS components, the prevalence of
elevated glucose increased from 48.7% (95% CI, 45.9-51.5) in 2011-2 to 64.3% (95% CI,
61.0-67.4) in 2017-8 [P for trend <.001; APC=11.7, (95% CI, 3.5-21.0)]. The prevalence of
MetS in non-Hispanic Asian increased from 21.8% (95% CI, 16.7-28.0) in 2011-2 to 31.2%
(95% CI, 27.4-35.3) in 2017-8 [P for trend <.001; APC=14.6, (95% CI, 2.5-34.8)].
Conclusion and Relevance: The prevalence of MetS remained stable from 2011 to 2018, but
increased among non-Hispanic Asians. Lifestyle modification is needed to prevent metabolic
syndrome and the associated risks of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Background
Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of conditions comprising central obesity, elevated
blood pressure, hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia and reduced high-density lipoproteincholesterol (HDL) that are associated with the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and
cardiovascular disease.1 In the National Cholesterol Education Program’s Adult Treatment
Panel III definition, a person with three or more criteria above is deemed to have MetS.2 We
and other groups have shown that MetS is also associated with hypertension, stroke, cancer
and increased mortality.3-5 Recent studies have revealed that MetS and its components are
highly associated with the susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) infection and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).6,7
Therefore, diagnosing metabolic syndrome is clinically important because it prompts
clinicians to look for the myriad of diseases associated with it, helps patients to understand
the causes of their seemingly diverse ailments, and paves the way for the prevention of the
complications of MetS, such as cardiovascular diseases, and severity of COVID-19, through
pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapy.8

At the societal level, the prevalence of MetS is an index of the cardiometabolic health of the
population. In the US, it has been reported many times that the prevalence of diabetes has
been increasing and has reached epidemic proportions.9 Abdominal obesity, or central obesity,
leads to a state of systemic inflammation and insulin resistance. It plays a major role in the
pathogenesis of MetS.10 Previous reports have highlighted a steady increase in the prevalence
of MetS in the US.11, 12 However, its prevalence appears to have reached a plateau in 2016,
with no evidence of further increases.13 The prevalence was 34%, 33%, and 34.7% in 19992006,14 2003-2012,15 and 2011-2016,13 respectively. This may seem surprising against the

background of an obesity and diabetes epidemic, which would be expected to increase the
prevalence of MetS as they are components of the syndrome.16

Socioeconomic status (SES), reflecting education, occupation and income, is known to be a
powerful predictor of morbidity and mortality.17 Previous studies have shown greater decline
in the prevalence of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases among people of higher
SES in the US.18 The prevalence and time trends in MetS in people with different SES
warrants investigation.

Therefore, we used the latest figures up to 2018 to estimate the latest prevalence of MetS in
US adults, and in gender, age, ethnic and socioeconomic subgroups.

Methods
Description of the study
The US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a continuous and
longitudinal survey since 1999. It received ethical approval from the National Center for
Health Statistics Ethics Review Board. Written consent was obtained from all adult subjects.
A cross-sectional, stratified, multistage probability sampling method was used to obtain a
nationally representative sample of the US population ≥ 20 years of age. Demographics,
examination, questionnaire, and laboratory data covering the period 2011-2018 were
extracted.19 Pregnant women were excluded to reduce bias associated with weight,
hypertension, and gestational diabetes.

Definition
Self-reported race/ethnicity was categorized into the following subgroups: Hispanic, non-

Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian, and ‘other’. Hispanic race/ethnicity
includes Mexican American and other Hispanic races. Other race/ethnicity includes other
non-Hispanic races, including non-Hispanic multiracial. Educational level was categorized
into four subgroups: less than 11th grade, high school, some college, and college or above.
The household income is based on a comparison of family income with the poverty threshold
determined by the U.S. Bureau of Census. The household income was classified as < 130%,
130-349%, and ≥ 350%. MetS was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education
Program’s Adult Treatment Panel III as having at least three of the following diagnostic
criteria: waist circumference greater than 102 cm in men or 88 cm in women, triglyceride
level greater than 150 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol less than 40 mg/dL in men
or less than 50 mg/dL in women, systolic blood pressure at least 130 mm Hg or diastolic
blood pressure at least 85 mm Hg or taking hypertension medications, or fasting plasma
glucose level at least 100 mg/dL or taking diabetes medications.2, 20

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed in STATA (version 15.0). Four discrete 2-year cycles of
continuous NHANES (2011-2012, 2013-2014, 2014-2016, 2017-2018) were analyzed using
complex sample weights accounting for unequal probabilities of selection, nonresponse bias,
and oversampling. Chi-square tests and Kruskal-Wallis were used to compare categorical and
continuous variables, respectively. Trends were assessed using logistic regression after
regressing metabolic syndrome on year (prevalence was treated as an outcome variable and
cycle year was modeled as a continuous predictor). Annual percentage changes (APC) were
calculated to measure the trends in MetS during 2011-2018 using the Joinpoint Regression
Program, Version 4.9.0.0 (Statistical Research and Applications Branch, National Cancer
Institute). All analyses were 2-tailed, and P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Characteristics of study participants
We included 22370 adult participants [mean age 47.9 years (95% CI, 47.3-48.6), 48.6% (95%
CI, 47.5-49.6) men] from the four most recent 2-year cycles of continuous NHANES (20112012, 2013-2014, 2014-2016, 2017-2018). The percentage of adults that underwent an
examination in these cycles was 69.5%, 68.5%, 58.7%, and 48.8%, respectively.21 Their
characteristics of participants included in this study by gender, age group, race/ethnicity and
socioeconomic status are shown in Table 1. The percentages of each component of MetS
among the study participants are shown in Figure 1. The percentage of elevated glucose
increased from 48.7% (95% CI, 45.9-51.5) in 2011-2 to 64.3% (95% CI, 61.0-67.4) in 2017-8
[P for trend <.001; APC=11.7, (95% CI, 3.5-21.0)], whereas the percentage of reduced HDL,
central obesity, elevated triglyceride and blood pressure remained stable in participants from
2011-2014 to 2017-2018 (All P for trend >.05).

Overall prevalence of MetS in 2011-2018
Among 22370 participants, 5820 fulfilled the criteria for MetS, giving an overall prevalence
of 37.3% (95% CI, 35.7-39.0). The prevalence was not significantly different among men and
women [37.9% (95% CI, 35.6-40.2) vs 36.8% (95% CI, 34.7-39.0), P =.48]. As expected, the
prevalence increased with age (Table 2). It increased from 20.1% (95% CI, 18.1-22.4) in the
20-39 age group to 53.7% (95% CI, 50.7-56.7) in those aged ≥ 60 years (P <.001). It was
highest in non-Hispanic Whites (39.3%; 95% CI, 37.1-41.0) and lowest in non-Hispanic
Asians (24.0%; 95% CI, 21.6-26.6).

The prevalence of MetS was 36.2% (95% CI, 32.3-40.3), 34.8% (95% CI, 32.3-37.4), 39.9%
(95% CI, 36.6-43.2) and 38.3% (95% CI, 35.3-41.3) in 2011-2, 2013-4, 2015-6, 2017-8,
respectively. The overall weighted prevalence of MetS remained stable across the four 2-year
cycles (P for trend =.08). The percentage of MetS prevalence in non-Hispanic Asian
increased from 21.8% (95% CI, 16.7-28.0) in 2011-2 to 31.2% (95% CI, 27.4-35.3) in 2017-8
[P for trend <.001; APC=14.6, (95% CI, 2.5-34.8)].

Prevalence of MetS by socioeconomic status
High SES was associated with a low prevalence of MetS (Table 2). During 2011-2018, the
weighted prevalence of MetS among college graduates was lower (29.5%; 95% CI, 27.0-32.1)
than among those with some college (39.6%; 95% CI, 36.8-42.5) and those who were high
school graduates or less [41.4% (95% CI, 38.0-44.9), 42.3% (95% CI, 39.4-45.3),
respectively; P <.001]. The prevalence of MetS was lower in the household income ≥350%
group (35.1%; 95% CI, 32.2-38.0) than the 130%-349% group and the <130% group [39.9%
(95% CI, 37.5-42.2) and 38.4% (95% CI, 35.7-41.2), respectively; P =.02).

Discussion
This is a report of the most up-to-date estimates of the prevalence of MetS in US adults. Our
results showed no significant overall change in the prevalence of MetS since 2011. This
conclusion is in line with a recent analysis of MetS prevalence in NHANES 2011-2016.13 As
there might be a time lag between obesity and the development of diabetes and hypertension,
it would be premature to conclude that the epidemic of obesity and diabetes would not result
in a higher incidence of MetS in the future. Indeed, our analysis showed a rising trend in
hyperglycemia, and so highlights the pressing need for measures to prevent diabetes in the
US. On the basis of the 2018 census numbers for U.S. adults aged ≥20 years (∼247 million),

we estimate that about 93 million people had the metabolic syndrome in 2018, which
exceeded the prevalence of 50 million in 1990, and 64 million in 2000.22

We also investigated the prevalence of MetS in gender, age and ethnic subgroups. Older
individuals have a higher prevalence of MetS due to the increase in the prevalence of
hypertension and diabetes with age.23, 24 The increased overall prevalence of MetS was to a
large extent driven by the increased prevalence in MetS in this age group. As the elderly
population increases, the number of people with MetS is set to increase. A study showed that
only 20.4% of older US adults had satisfactory health metrics.7 The increase in MetS and the
associated increase in diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease will increase the
population disease burden in the coming years.25

The rise in the prevalence of MetS in non-Hispanic Asians in the US should not be
overlooked. Asian Americans are the fastest-growing racial-ethnic minority in the United
States. In 2018, Asian Americans comprised 6.5% of the U.S. population.26 Despite the
seemingly low rate of obesity in Asian Americans, they are prone to MetS and type 2 diabetes
for the same BMI as other ethnic groups.27, 28 Conversely, non-Hispanic blacks in the US
have relatively higher lean mass and lower fat mass.29 The impact of high BMI on the
development of diabetes and hypertension shows ethnic differences, with the greatest impact
seen among Asians and the least impact among blacks.30, 31

We observed that the prevalence of MetS decreased with elevated educational attainment and
income. People of low SES were more likely to have MetS. Possible explanations might
include unhealthy lifestyle, diet habits, and poorer access to healthcare. Those with lower
SES tend to have an unhealthy lifestyle, including smoking and alcohol consumption which

could aggravate the potential risks of MetS.32 People with low income might prefer higher
energy density food at less cost, which results in higher energy intake and increased risk of
obesity.33 Obese and obesity are closely related to development of MetS. Low SES is also
related to psychiatric illnesses which can also result in metabolic syndrome by inducing
unhealthy behaviors such as alcohol consumption, smoking, poor diet, sleeping disorder and
poor adherence to treatment.34, 35

MetS is associated with severe COVID-19.7 Nearly half of COVID-19 patients had a
comorbidity such as hypertension and diabetes.36 Obesity confers a 2.4-fold higher odds of
developing severe pneumonia in COVID-19.37 The high prevalence of MetS in the US and its
increasing trend are worrying, since it may suggest that a substantial proportion of the US
population is at risk of COVID-19 and its complications.

Limitations
There are some limitations in this study that should be acknowledged. Firstly, the NHANES
is a cross-sectional survey that collected data from different participants in each time interval
failing to provide longitudinal follow-up data. Secondly, NHANES used a recall
questionnaire for some variables, especially the antihypertension and anti-diabetes
medications, prone to recall and response bias. Thirdly, the number of participants, especially
with triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, is relatively small.

Conclusions
The prevalence of MetS in the US has not increased significantly in 2011-8. It was 36.2% (95%
CI, 32.3-40.3) in 2011-2 and 38.3% (95% CI, 35.3-41.3) in 2017-8. This may be a reflection
of the type 2 diabetes epidemic in the US. Lifestyle modification including healthy diet and

regular physical activity would help to reduce the risk of developing MetS. This is especially
important in Asian Americans and people of low SES. The early recognition of MetS, the
prompt modifications of lifestyle may forestall the late complications of MetS including
cardiovascular disease.
