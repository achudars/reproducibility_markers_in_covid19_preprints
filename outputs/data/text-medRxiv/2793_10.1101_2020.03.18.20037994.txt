Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel human respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Asymptomatic carriers of the COVID-19 virus display no clinical symptoms but are
known to be contagious.

Recent evidence reveals that this sub-

population, as well as persons with mild disease, are a major contributor in the propagation of the disease.

The rapid spread of

transmission. This created an unprecedented epidemiological situation not properly characterized by existing mathematical models of
isolation and quarantine. In this manuscript, we present a mathematical model for community transmission of COVID-19 taking into
account asymptomatic carriers and varying degrees of risk mitigation. The main results consist of an exact calculation of the effective
reproduction number Re (t), and a modeling framework that enables
the quantification of the effect of risk mitigation and asymptomatism
on community transmission. A computation of Re (t) is provided using mean parameters. The point estimate of the basic reproduction
number is R0 ≈ 12.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel human respiratory disease caused by the
SARS-CoV-2 virus. The first cases of COVID-19 disease surfaced during late December
2019 in Wuhan city, the capital of Hubei province in China. Shortly after, the virus quickly
spread to several countries (1). On January 30, 2020 The World Health Organization
(WHO) declared the virus as a public health emergency of international scope (2). Forty
one days later, on March 11, 2020 it was officially declared to be a global pandemic (3).
Asymptomatic individuals in the context of COVID-19 disease are subjects who carry
a viral load, but do not show clinical symptoms. When the first cases appeared in China,
there was no clarity about the existence of asymptomatic carriers. The evolution of our
understanding of this matter has produced a very broad span of estimates, ranging from
1% to 88%, as summarized next:
• 1.1% from the Chinese Center for Disease Control, cross sectional study (4). The

criteria for inclusion was presence of symptoms. The only surprise is that this study
found any asymptomatic carrier at all.
• 17.9% from the Princess cruise ship in Japan (5). However, the age pyramid of
passengers was heavily biased toward > 60 year-old, precisely the age group most
likely to develop symptoms. This finding does not translate to communities.
• 30.8% from Japanese evacuees from Wuhan (6). The age pyramid of this group was
also tilted toward seniority.
• 50-75% from Vo’Euganeo in Italy. An entire village was tested (7).
• +80% from reanalysis of Chinese data (8).
• 88% in pregnant women in a maternity ward were positive for SARS-CoV-2 upon
admission but had no symptoms of COVID-19 at presentation (9).
Asymptomatic carriers pose a silent threat to communities because these individuals
might not adhere to risk mitigation strategies (e.g. wearing face masks). Asymptomatic
and symptomatic carriers may have similar levels of viral load and infectiousness (10,11).
Since they are frequently undetected by public health systems, the potential for sustained
contagion is high (5, 12).
The rapid spread of COVID-19 forced governments around the world to establish and
enforce generalized risk mitigation strategies, from lockdowns to guidelines for social distancing, in an effort to minimize community transmission (13–15). From a mathematical
point of view, the effects resulting from varying degrees of risk mitigation are not captured by existing quarantine models whose formulation depends on the isolation of a given
sub-population, whereas in COVID-19 entire societies were subject to restrictions (16–19).

The primary aim of this manuscript is to qualitatively characterize the epidemiological dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 via a compartmentalized model that takes into account the
asymptomatic sub-population and risk mitigation conditions. This manuscript is organized as follows: Sect. 2.1 presents a generalized model in which the additional models
covered in this manuscript are specific cases and modifications, Sect. 2.2 features a slight
simplification of the model featured in Sect. 2.1 with a reproduction number which admits a natural biological interpretation and a numerical implementation, Sect. 3 builds
upon the simplified model presented in Sect. 2.2 through means of a modification which
takes into account the changes in behavioral patterns during the risk mitigation period
which resulted in a reduction of the susceptible population and contains a numerical plot
of the effective reproduction number of the model, Sect. 4 is focused on covering the
biological relevance of the reproduction number listed in Sect. 2.2, Sect. 5 is the conclusion and Sect. 6 contains tables in which the biological and computationally determined
parameters are listed separately.

Mathematical Models

This section contains variations of models which fall into the class of models covered
by Aguilar and Gutierrez (2020) (20). The SEYAR model for the spread of COVID19 is formulated by decomposing the total host population (N ) into the following five
epidemiological classes: susceptible human (S), exposed human (E), symptomatic human
(Y ), asymptomatic human (A), and recovered human (R).

Disease-Free Equilibrium (DFE) points are solutions of a dynamical system corresponding
to the case where no disease is present in the population. The reproduction number R0
is a threshold value that characterizes the local asymptotic stability of the underlying
dynamical system at a disease-free equilibrium. Listed below in Lemma 1 is a proof of
the reproduction number associated to the generalized Model 1.

ξ = λAY = 0 in Equation 2.
The calculation of R0 during the first stages of an epidemic poses significant challenges. Evidence of this difficulty was observed in the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus
pandemic (22). Particularly, the COVID-19 pandemic has a different characterization in
each country in which it has spread due to differences in surveillance capabilities of public
health systems, socioeconomic factors, and environmental conditions.
The first three weeks of community transmission is well characterized by an exponential
function in multiple locations. Figure 3 shows the number of cases reported in thirteen
countries with universal health care and strong surveillance systems until March 25, 2020.
Ten of these countries are in the European zone, plus Australia, Canada and Japan.
An exponential fitting for each country reveals an average coefficient of determination

R2 = 0.9846±0.0164. The average growth rate r in the exponential model Y = a·(1+r)t ,
where t is time measured in days, is r = 23.32%, and the average of the initial conditions
is a = 103 cases. Thus,

There are well known challenges in attempting to fit an exponential function to epidemiological data (23–25). To compare the output of the model to the data from the
thirteen countries studied, the growth rate found in Equation 5 was superimposed on the
model. The initial condition a0 in the exponential function Y = a0 · (1 + r)t was fitted to
the dynamical system with the Nelder-Meade simplex algorithm (26).

This representation of the dynamics of the disease must be understood as a theoretical

that necessarily result in deviations from this ideal case.

Modeling Risk Mitigation Conditions

Changes in behavioral patterns in response to an outbreak have an effect on the spread of
a given disease. When an infectious pathogen threatens a community, individual awareness and public health interventions can motivate a portion of community individuals
to take measures to reduce their exposure to the pathogen. The rapid spread and high
contagiousness of COVID-19 resulted in exponential growth during the first three weeks
of the outbreak as shown in Figure 3 of Section 2.2. In response, drastic measures were
taken by community leaders in order to reduce the susceptiblity of the population and,
as a result, slow down the spread of the disease. Social distancing, the cancellation of
events likely to attract crowds, the closing of schools and working from home will all have
a drastic impact on the size of the susceptible population at a given time (27, 28).
Let Q(t) denote the risk at time t. Q(t) should be chosen such that the rate of change
of risk decreases proportionally to the amount of risk present, i.e. the more danger there
is, the more careful people are. Consider the following initial value problem:
(
Q̇ = −kQ, k > 0
Q(0) = 1.

(6)

The solution is given by Q(t) = e−kt . This framework captures a broad spectrum of risk
mitigation strategies, from shelter-in-place orders (e.g. k = 0.05), to minimal guidelines
for social distancing (e.g. k ≈ 0). Thus, the following model modification is proposed to
model the effect of these behavioral changes

Next, we provide a formula for the effective reproduction number of System 7. In particular, we have Theorem 1 below.
Theorem 1. The effective reproduction number corresponding to the dynamical system
given by Equation 7 is given by the following equation

Proof. The matrix V corresponding to System 7 is unchanged by the modification involving the exponential multiplier Q(t) := e−kt . Let BY (t) := βY Q(t) and BA (t) := βA Q(t),
then


In the constant case, i.e. BY (t) ≡ βY and BA (t) ≡ βA for all t ≥ 0, we have

It is clear that the exponential multiplier Q preserves the non-negativity of F (t) for all
t. For fixed time t = t0 , the quantity ρ (F (t0 )V −1 ) is equal to the maximum eigenvalue
of the linear operator F (t0 )V −1 .
For t ∈ R+ , the eigenvalue functions depend continuously on the coefficients of the
characteristic polynomial. The high regularity of the exponential multiplier measuring the

risk effect, i.e. Q ∈ (Cb∞ (R+ ), k · k∞ ) (the space of smooth bounded functions equipped
with the supremum norm) in combination with its monotonic decreasing behavior for all
t ≥ 0 ensures that the ordering of the eigenvalue functions is preserved and the maximum is well-defined. Precisely, denote dim(F (t)V −1 ) = n, the spectral radius function
ρ (F (t)V −1 ) is interpreted to be the largest eigenvalue function λi (t) for i = 1, · · · , n in
the Banach space L∞ (R+ ).
In this case, the spectral radius function ρ (F (t)V −1 ) is well-defined and is given by:

ρ F (t)V −1 :=

λi ∈L∞ (R+ )

{λi (t)} = max

Therefore, we arrive at the following reproduction function which takes into account an
exponential decline in the susceptible population:
Re (t) := R0 Q(t) = R0 e−kt .

Remark 3.1. It is a direct consequence of Equation 8 that Re (0) = R0 and the disease
should stop spreading after ≈

1
k

ln R0 days provided continual isolation resulting in such a

drastic decrease in susceptibility is maintained. Particularly, it follows that k Re (t) k∞ =
Re (0) = R0 and inf t∈R+ Re (t) = 0, thus Re (t) ∈ (0, R0 ] for all t ∈ R+ .
In general, the susceptible population decreases in response to the infection force which
is reflected in the canonical definition of R0 (t), as given by equation 10. The above
modification accounts for a decline in the susceptible population that is consistent with
observable results pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The modified SEYAR model 7 can be used as a tool to explore multiple scenarios corresponding to different interventions. Featured below is a plot of the effective reproduction
number Re (t) labeled as Equation 8.

Discussion

The reproduction number R0 shown in Equation 4 arising from the simplified model (3)
admits a natural biological interpretation. To guide this discussion, it is pertinent to refer
to the original epidemic model proposed by W. O. Kermack and A. G. McKendrick in
1927 (29), see Figure 6 below. The corresponding dynamical system is given by

Figure 6: This figure is a schematic diagram of a SIR model consisted of three compartments,
namely: susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered (R). Humans progress through each compartment subject to the rates described above.

Epidemiologically speaking, the basic reproduction number is the average number of secondary infections generated by a single infection in a completely susceptible population. It
is proportional to the product of infection/contact (a), contact/time (b) and time/infection
(c). The quantity a is the infection probability between susceptible and infectious individuals, b is the mean contact rate between susceptible and infectious individuals and c
is the mean duration of the infectious period.
The case of an increasing infected sub-population corresponds to the occurrence of
an epidemic. This happens provided that I˙ = β NI S − ωI > 0 or

β S

> 1. Under

the assumption that in the beginning of an epidemic, virtually the total population is
susceptible, that is

S
N

≈ 1. As a result, we arrive at the following equivalent condition
R0 :=

> 1.
ω

The parameter β in Figure 6 is equal to ab and ω is equal to c−1 . This combination of
parameters stands to reason as it is a ratio of the effective contact rate β and the mean
infectious period ω −1 .
Since the case fatality ratio is of negligible size (i.e. δ ≈ 0), the reproduction number
featured in Equation 4 has a similar natural biological interpretation as the sum of ratios

Estimations of the basic reproduction number, R0 , vary on a broad range. The initial estimates of the preliminary outbreak dynamics suggested R0 to be in the interval
[0.3, 2.38] (30–38). A posterior analysis estimated a median R0 value of 5.7 (95% CI 3.8–8.9)
(39); remark 3.1 indicates that the period required to stop the spread of the disease should
be at least 58 days with a risk mitigation coefficient of k = 0.03.
The reproduction number is not a biological constant corresponding to a given pathogen
(40). In reality, the values of R0 fluctuate with time, and depend on numerous factors.
It provides a means to measure the contagiousness of a disease under given circumstances
and is utilized by public health authorities to gauge the severity of an outbreak. The design of various public health strategies and measurement of their effectiveness are guided
by estimates of R0 . Established outbreaks usually fade provided that interventions maintain R0 < 1. It is defined to be the average number of secondary cases generated by a
typical case. A decrease in the susceptible proportion of the population

cause a corresponding decrease in the values of the reproduction number.

It directly follows by Equation 10 that Re (0) = R0 , as initially the total human population

portion. This is reasonable since Equation 10 implies that Re (t) is proportional to S(t).
Since the case fatality ratio δ ≈ 0, the total population N (t) varies little within a tight
envelope around the initial susceptible population S(0). This is easily observable upon
inspection of the dynamical system given by Equation 4 in Section 2.2, as it is clear that

Conclusion

As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, governments around the world are taking drastic
steps to limit community spread. This will necessarily dampen the growth of the disease. The parameter k introduced in Equation 6 accounts for generalized risk mitigation
measures in which there is risk aversion by a substantial portion of the population, thus affecting effective contact rates. We call k the risk mitigation coefficient. As risk mitigation
measures evolve due to government interventions, k is adjusted accordingly. In practice,
one would set a risk mitigation coefficient corresponding to each mitigation period.
In juxtaposition to the SARS-CoV epidemic of 2003 where only symptomatic individuals were capable of transmitting the disease (41, 42), asymptomatic carriers of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus may be capable of the same degree of transmission as symptomatic
individuals (11). In a public health context, the silent threat posed by the presence of
asymptomatic and other undocumented carriers in the population renders the COVID19 pandemic far more difficult to control. SARS-CoV-2 is evidently among the more
contagious pathogens known, a phenomenon most likely driven by the asymptomatic
sub-population.

The calculation of R0 poses significant challenges during the first stages of any outbreak, including the COVID-19 pandemic. This is due to paucity and timing of surveillance data, different methodological approaches to data collection, and different guidelines
for testing. Estimates vary greatly: 0.3 (30), 2.28 (31), 2.38 (8), 3.28 (32), and others.
The value of R0 must be understood as a threshold parameter that can be utilized to
characterize disease spread. The estimations of R0 are expected to vary substantially
per locality depending on how public health officials communicate the risk to the general public, general beliefs and (dis)information available to the population, and other
socioeconomic and environmental factors affecting contact rates.
Different degrees of complication arise due to the presence asymptomatic carriers in an
epidemic. If there were relatively few asymptomatic carriers, (for example 1 asymptomatic
for every 9 symptomatic), the time to peak could be extended. Many infectious diseases
exhibit this behavior and this is far from the worst case scenario; however, controlling
the outbreak becomes more challenging. The mid-level situation corresponds to a higher
percentage of asymptomatic carries (for example twenty to seventy percent). The relative
large number of asymptomatic carriers would accelerate the transmission of the disease,
and would make it increasingly difficult to contain. This is the only plausible explanation
for the unprecedented speed of propagation of COVID-19. Another possibility is the case
where there would be significantly more asymptomatic carriers than symptomatic, (for
example 80 times more) (43). Provided that exposure results in immunity, this scenario
would be less damaging than the mid-level. If many people get infected, these cases do
not develop severity, and exposure confers immunity, this would accelerate the emergence
of herd immunity. This could be the most desirable outcome at this point. The scenario
most likely occurring is the mid-level; this case creates a protracted epidemic, with a
slow build up of herd immunity. This mid-level scenario could result in the need of risk

mitigation strategies until there is a vaccine.
The worst-case scenario would consist of the following: (i) mid-level or significantly
more asymptomatic carriers than symptomatic, (ii) exposure does not confer immunity,
and (iii) a vaccine is elusive as it has been for other coronaviruses that cause the common
cold. This unfortunate state of affairs could reduce the life expectancy of our entire
species.
