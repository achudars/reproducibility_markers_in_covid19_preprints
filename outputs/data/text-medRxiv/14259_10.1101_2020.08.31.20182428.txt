ABSTRACT
Introduction: On the basis of the preliminary report from the RECOVERY trial, the use of
dexamethasone or alternative corticosteroids (CS) is currently recommended in severe
COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen. However, last updated
recommendations have not taken a position either for or against the use of other
immunomodulators such as tocilizumab (TCZ), with or without CS, since results are still
limited.
Methods: From March 17 to April 7, 2020, a real-world observational retrospective
analysis was conducted at our 750-bed university hospital to study the characteristics
and risk factors for mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 treated with TCZ +/- CS,
in addition to standard of care (SOC). Data were obtained from routine clinical practice,
stored in electronic medical records. The main outcome was all-cause in-hospital
mortality.
Results: A total of 1,092 COVID-19 patients were admitted during the study period. Of
them, 186 (17%) were treated with TCZ, of which 129 (87.8%) in combination with CS.
Of the total 186, 155 (83.3 %) patients were receiving non-invasive ventilation when TCZ
+/- CS was initiated. Mean time from symptoms onset and hospital admission to TCZ use
was 12 (± 4.3) and 4.3 days (± 3.4), respectively. Overall, 147 (79%) survived and 39 (21%)
died. By multivariate analysis, mortality was associated with older age (HR=1.09,
p<0.001), chronic heart failure (HR=4.4, p=0.003), and chronic liver disease (HR=4.69,
p=0.004). The use of CS, in combination with TCZ, was the main protective factor against
mortality (HR=0.26, p<0.001) in such severe COVID-19 patients receiving TCZ. No serious
superinfections were observed after a 30-day follow-up.
Conclusions: In severe COVID-19 patients receiving TCZ due to systemic host-immune
inflammatory response syndrome, the use of CS in addition to TCZ therapy, showed
beneficial effect in preventing in-hospital mortality.

As of August 24, 2020, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has infected 23 million
people worldwide, and killed more than 800,000 persons [1,2]. The 2019 COVID
pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Europe on January 31, 2020 [3]. Since then,
there have been more than 400,000 confirmed cases in Spain, with more than 28,000
deaths. As a result, Spain saw one of the most draconian Covid-19 blockades in Europe,
but two months after its lift, the country is on the brink of a second wave of coronavirus
infections.
Whereas the pandemic continues to spread globally, a worrying 15% of patients
will continue to transit into the third and most severe stage of disease [4]. Unlikely to
the early clinical stages in which viral replication and local respiratory involvement seem
to be the norm, the advanced stage of COVID-19 appears to be triggered by the hostimmune response. This third clinical stage presents as severe pulmonary injury and
cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with elevation of multi-organ inflammatory markers
[4,5].
Accordingly, to treat this advanced stage of COVID-19 illness, the use of
immunomodulatory agents such as corticosteroids (CS) or tocilizumab (TCZ), an anti‐IL‐
6 monoclonal antibody that has proven effective in IL‐6 mediated diseases, may be
justified and has been suggested [6-8]. Currently, on the basis of the preliminary report
from the RECOVERY trial, last updated (July 30, 2020) COVID-19 treatment guidelines
recommend the use of dexamethasone, or alternative glucocorticoids [9,10]. These
immunomodulatory agents are indicated in severe COVID-19 patients requiring
supplemental oxygen, being or not mechanically ventilated. Conversely, since studies
are still limited, current international recommendations have not taken a position either
for or against the use of TCZ in such patients [11].
In this regard, after the first short series of 21 patients reported by Xu et al. [7],
the published evidence for the use of TCZ in severe COVID-19 illness has been
summarized in two existing systematic reviews and meta-analysis (SRMA). Because the
lack of RCTs [12], both SRMA only included observational studies, in which TCZ was given
at a single dose of 400-800 mg iv or 162-324 mg sc, renewable once in case of insufficient
response to therapy. The first SRMA, published by Lan SH Zhang et al. [13], included 7
studies, with no conclusive evidence that TCZ would provide any additional benefit to
patients with severe COVID-19. The second, registered in the medRxiv repository by
Boregowda et al. [14] included 16 studies, concluding that the addition of TCZ to the
SOC might reduce the mortality in severe COVID-19.
Nowadays, there is an emerging number of additional observational studies of
higher quality from Italy, Spain, France and the US, either recently published or
registered in the medRxiv repository [15-24]. These studies mostly assessed the use of
TCZ in the subset of severely-ill non-intubated COVID-19 patients and were compared
to a control group. Most of these recent studies concluded that TCZ may reduce ICU
admissions, mechanical ventilator use, and risk of death. Since most of the studies were
performed before the RECOVERY trial, there was no standard protocol in place regarding
the use of CS in COVID-19. Thus, the use of CS only depended on the individual decision
of those physicians who cared for the included patients. The potential effect of CS, in
regimen combination with TCZ, was not specifically evaluated in most of such studies.
This fact prompted us to review our real-world observational data, collected
from routine clinical practice, during the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred in
March-April, 2020, at our hospital setting. Our aim was to compare survivor and non4

survivor groups from a large cohort of severe COVID-19 patients treated with TCZ, either
alone or in combination with CS, in order to assess the characteristics and associated
risk factors for in-hospital mortality in such patient population receiving TCZ.
METHODS
The first patient with advanced stage of COVID-19 with respiratory failure and systemic
host-immune response treated with TCZ at the Bellvitge University Hospital, was on
March 17, 2020. From March 17, 2020, to April 7, 2020, during the first 3 weeks of the
epidemic, a retrospective cohort study was conducted at our 750-bed tertiary care
public institution for adults in Barcelona, Spain. The aim was to describe the
characteristics of patients receiving TCZ, with or without concomitant CS, for treating
advanced stage of COVID-19, and to assess its effect in preventing all-cause in-hospital
mortality. Demographic and clinical data were collected from institutional electronic
medical records.
Inclusion criteria
All patients aged ≥ 18 years admitted at our hospital and given TCZ due to severe COVID19 pneumonia and systemic hyperinflammation were included consecutively. All
patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 by positive polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) of
nasal or pharyngeal swabs. All patients underwent a chest X-ray and were reported as
COVID-19 lung involvement by an expert radiologist. An electrocardiogram was also
performed on all patients on admission and every 48-72 hours during their stay in
hospital. Patients admitted to either conventional hospital wards, semi-critical (noninvasive mechanical ventilation) or critical care units (invasive mechanical ventilation)
were included.
For TCZ to be used, according to hospital guidelines, patients had to meet a PaO2
(mmHg)/FiO2 (%) x100 <300, or its surrogate SatO2 (%)/FiO2 (%) x100 <315 [25], and at
least 2 of the following criteria: ferritin >1000 ng/ml, C-reactive protein (CRP) >100 mg/l,
interleukin-6 (IL6) >70ng/l, D-dimer >1000 mcg/l or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) >400
U/l. An analysis of these inflammatory parameters was performed on the day before
administration of the initial dose of TCZ (D0), and subsequently on day 1 (D1), 2 (D2),
and 7 (D7) after administration. Lymphocyte count was additionally recorded.
Outcome
The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality.

Variables
As mentioned above, ancillary laboratory tests included PaO2 (mmHg), ferritin, CRP, IL6, D-dimer, LDH, and lymphocyte count. Myocarditis was defined by clinical criteria,
accompanied by sinus tachycardia, elevated troponin T (cut-off ≥14 ng/l) and elevated
N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP, cut-off ≥300ng/l). Pulmonary
thromboembolism (PE) was diagnosed when patients presented with disproportionate
dyspnea with D-dimer elevation, and PE was confirmed by CT scan. Low-flow oxygen
was defined as nasal cannula 2-3 l or oxygen mask with FiO2 <50%. High-flow oxygen
was defined as Monaghan® oxygenation with FiO2 100% and >10l. High-flow oxygen
with nasal cannula (HFNC) was defined as nasal cannula oxygenation with FiO2 >50%.
For non-invasive ventilation, patients were admitted in semi-critical or intensive care
units (ICU). If invasive ventilation with endotracheal intubation was required, patients
were admitted at ICU.
Drug Dosing and Regimens
During the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Spain, the use of TCZ in severe COVID-19 patients
was regulated, authorized and centrally supplied by the Spanish Ministry of Health, as a
single iv infusion at a dose of 400 mg (weight <80kg) or 600 mg (weight >80kg), in order
to control TCZ nationwide pharmacological stock. Exceptionally, if there was a partial or
incomplete clinical response, with persistence of fever and worsening of analytical
parameters, a second or a third infusion of TCZ at 400 – 600 mg at 12 hours after the
first infusion or a third at 24 hours after the second one, respectively, could be requested
from the Spanish Central Government, but authorized in only very few cases per
hospital. Regarding the use of CS, there was no standard protocol in place for its use
during the study period of the present revision. CS were indicated in combination with
TCZ in the majority of cases, depending on individual physicians, using
methylprednisolone at doses ranging from 0.5 mg/kg/d to 250mg iv in 3 pulses.
Standard of care (SOC) treatments additionally administered to TCZ and CS were in
accordance with available hospital guidelines at the time of the study period (MarchApril, 2020), and were also evaluated. SOC included hydroxychloroquine (HCQ),
azithromycin (AZI), lopinavir/ritonavir (L/r), and remdesivir (R), alone or in combination
regimens, given at standard recommended doses [26-29]. Prophylactic anticoagulation
therapy with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was also recommended. A subset
minority of severe COVIS-19 patients received sc interferon beta-1b (IFN) at
0.25mg/48h.
Informed consent was waived because the study was performed outside the context of
RCT, and was retrospective in nature. Data were obtained from routine daily practice
and anonymized. The confidential information of the studied patients was protected
according European and National normative. The study received the ethics approval by
the Research Ethics Committee of Bellvitge University Hospital (PR145/20).

Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables were shown as absolute numbers and percentages. Quantitative
variables were shown as mean and standard deviation. Categorical variables were
compared using chi-square or Fisher's test. Quantitative variables were compared using
t-test or Mann-Whitney U test depending on whether the variable followed a parametric
distribution or not. The Cox proportional-hazards model was performed with mortality
as a dependent variable and following a backwards stepwise selection of variables. The
survival time used in Cox regression is the time from hospital admission (usually
coinciding with the start of the first treatment administered) to the last visit. All variables
with significance <0.05 in the univariate study plus age and gender were included in the
multivariate study.
RESULTS
General data
Between March 17 and April 7, 2020 there were 1,092 patients admitted to our
hospital for COVID-19 illness. Of them, 186 (17%) were treated with TCZ at any time of
their admission and were included in the study; 129 were male (69.4%), most of old age
(64.3 yr. ± 13). At the time of TCZ first infusion, 123 (66.1%) patients were admitted into
conventional hospital wards, and 63 (33.9%) into semi-critical/critical care units. Of the
total of 186 patients, 147 (79%) survived and 39 (21%) died. Both groups of patients,
survivors and non-survivors, were comparable in the baseline. However, patients from
the group of non-survivors were older (62.1 years vs. 72.4, p<0.001), more frequently
had a previous diagnosis of chronic heart failure (1.4% vs. 12.8%, p=0.005) and/or
chronic liver disease (2% vs. 10.3%, p=0.036). Significantly, survivors received CS in
combination with TCZ in greater proportion than non-survivors (87.8% vs. 69.2%,
P=0.021) (Table 1).
Ancillary tests
Inflammatory parameters and lymphocyte count documented the day before
TCZ first administration (D0), with or without CS, and its progression during the following
7 days (D1, D2, and D7) are shown in Table 2. Although daily evolution of laboratory data
was registered in a limited number of included patients, survivors showed much lower
levels of abnormal inflammatory parameters and higher lymphocyte count the day
before TCZ first infusion when compared to non-survivors. Furthermore, non-survivors
showed a higher rapid increase of IL-6 two days after TCZ infusion (D2), as well as an
evolution to worse of LDH plasmatic levels. However, none of these differences were
found to be statistically significant for predicting in-hospital mortality in this study.
Drugs combinations and doses
All drugs in this study were given in accordance with the standard hospital
protocol during the study period, based on recommended international guidelines

available at that time. The number of patients receiving each of the drugs administered
and the duration of such treatments is detailed in Table 3.
The most common drugs used as SOC were HCQ (99.5%) and L/r (84.4%). The
usual sequential regimen was an initial treatment with a combination of HCQ plus L/r
for 5 days given on day +8.5 (± 4.1) from the beginning of COVID-19 symptoms. The
number of patients treated with prophylactic antibiotic (generally iv amoxicillinclavulanate, piperacillin-tazobactam or ceftriaxone) and anticoagulation therapy are
also indicated in Table 3.
In those patients at risk to transit to a more severe stage, this initial regimen was
subsequently followed by CS (iv pulses of 125 mg x 3 days) given on day +11.1 (± 4.6)
and followed by or overlapped with TCZ (single dose) given on day +12 (± 4.3). In this
regard, CS were also administered in combination with TCZ in 156 (83.9%) of the total
186 included patients. There were no differences between survivor and non-survivor
groups on the doses of CS received. Nor was there any difference in the sequential order
of infusion between the TCZ and CS. Regarding TCZ administration, most patients
(92.5%) received a single infusion of TCZ, 13 (7%) a second infusion 12h after the first
one, and in only 1 case (0.5%) a third infusion was administered 24h after the second
infusion. In 14 of the total 186 (7.5%) patients, despite presenting a PaO2/FiO2 g reater
than 300, TCZ prescription was indicated according to the serious alteration of
inflammatory parameters and lymphocyte count. No noticeable adverse events related
to TCZ +/- CS were shown throughout the study period and within the first 30 days of
follow-up.
Finally, no differences between both survivor and non-survivor groups were
shown according to both the indication of anticoagulation and the different doses
received, showing no higher mortality protection in the univariate study.
Risk factors of mortality
When survivors and non-survivors were compared in COVID-19 patients
receiving TCZ +/- CS due to severe lung injury and systemic host-immune response, the
multivariate study showed statistical significance for older age (HR=1.09, CI 95% 1.051.13, p<0.001), previous chronic heart failure (HR=4.4, CI 95% 1,68-11.63, p=0.003), and
previous chronic liver disease (HR=4.69, CI 95% 1.62-13.59, p=0.004) as risk factors for
all-cause in-hospital mortality. In contrast, the use of CS in combination with TCZ therapy
showed a beneficial effect in preventing mortality in such subset of COVID-19 patients
receiving TCZ (HR=0.26, CI 95% 0.13-0.56, p<0.001) (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
While a majority of COVID-19 patients show a low-mild disease with an overall
case mortality rate of 2-3%, a subset of 15% of patients presented with lung involvement
of moderate severity requiring hospital admission, and 5% with severe respiratory
failure and systemic host-immune inflammatory response, resulting in fatality in half of
such cases [1-3]. These findings are consistent with the three stages of increasing
severity proposed by Siddiqu and Mehra: stage I (incubation and early infection), stage
II (pulmonary involvement), and stage III (systemic hyperinflammation and multi-organ
dysfunction) ─, which correspond with distinct clinical findings and outcomes [4].

In this regard, only remdesivir [28] and dexamethasone [9] have demonstrated
evidence-based efficacy on randomized, controlled clinical trials (RCTs) in severe COVID19 illness to date [10]. These results are in accordance with the above-mentioned
natural 3-stage evolution of COVID-19 disease. In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 viral
incubation and early establishment of the disease appears to be the predominant
component in the first week, viral replication and transition into moderate acute lung
involvement the most important in the second one, and severe lung injury and systemic
host-immune inflammatory response from the third [4]. Therefore, it seems reasonable
to propose a sequential combined therapy with effective antiviral drugs as first step and,
thereafter, immunomodulatory treatment in those COVID-19 patients progressing into
the advanced stage with severe pulmonary failure and systemic hyperinflammatory
syndrome.
While the use of dexamethasone, or alternative CS, is currently recommended
as immunomodulatory agents for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients requiring
supplemental oxygen [10], updated recommendations have not taken a position either
for or against the use of other immunomodulators such as tocilizumab (TCZ), alone or in
combination with CS. The use of TCZ in such COVID-19 patients has been justified on the
basis of observational reports assessing the effect of TCZ to treat the cytokine release
syndrome (CRS) described to occur in severe COVID-19 illness. However, data from RCT
supporting its use have not been reported yet [4-8, 13,14].
In this regard, recent real-world observational studies of high quality from Italy,
Spain, France and the US, indicated that TCZ might reduce ICU admissions, mechanical
ventilator use, and risk of death, when compared to control group only treated with SOC
[15-24]. Moreover, Moreno-García et al. [16] conclude that the beneficial effect of TCZ
might be especially shown in the subset of severely-ill non-intubated COVID-19 patients
at early stage of the systemic hyperinflammatory response. In this respect, the SRMA by
Boregowda et al. [14] found that there was no statistical difference in mortality between
TCZ and SOC when steroids are used in the treatment of severe COVID-19 (n=12; pooled
OR 0.76 [95% CI 0.47, 1.23; p=0.27). However, when steroid was not used, TCZ group
had significantly low mortality when compared to the SOC group (n=4; pooled OR 0.24 [
95% CI; 0.10-0.54] p<0.01). Interestingly, in a vast majority of these studies assessing
TCZ in COVID-19, CS were also given in addition to TCZ, ranging 18-71% of included cases;
however, the potential role in combined regimen with TCZ was little evaluated.
These results prompted us to perform the present observational investigation,
with the aim to identify those factors determining prognosis in a large real-world cohort
of 186 patients receiving TCZ, with and without CS, due to severe COVID-19 illness,
hospitalized during our first wave of infections. Our findings showed that, in such severe
patients receiving TCZ, in-hospital mortality was associated with older age, and prior
chronic heart failure or liver disease. These mentioned factors were in accordance with
those predicting poor prognostic already found and previously reported in general
population with COVID-19 illness.
Of interest, the present study showed that in a vast majority (83.9%) of our
severe COVID-19 patients treated with TCZ, TCZ was also given in combination regimen
with CS. Remarkably, multivariate analysis identified the addition of CS to TCZ to be
protective for in-hospital mortality in our series. In this respect, our results are in line of
those reported in the SRMA by Boregowda et al., which concluded that when steroids
are used in the SOC, the absence of a significant difference in mortality between those

COVID-19 patients receiving TCZ and those who not, suggests a beneficial effect of the
anti-inflammatory properties of steroids in the treatment of severe COVID-19.
In the present study, TCZ and CS were both given as second-step therapy after
SOC, when the treating physicians considered that patients were probably at higher risk
to transit into the advanced stage of COVID-19. Among the 153 included patients
receiving TCZ and CS in combination, CS were most commonly given as iv pulses of
methylprednisolone at 125 mg x 3 days at day +11, immediately followed by or
overlapped with iv TCZ at day +12, at 8 mg/Kg (single dose). Only a minority of our
patients (7.5%) received a second or third TCZ infusion, not appearing to be related to
lower mortality. Lastly, in contrast with some previous studies in which adverse events
could not be evaluated due to short follow-up, we assessed treatment safety during a
30-day follow-up after TCZ +/- CS administration, with no obvious serious adverse events
or superinfections.
Finally, although survivors showed much better evolution of abnormal
inflammatory parameters and lymphopenia than non-survivors, none of them were
found to be statistically significant for predicting prognosis within clinical practice.
However, in the limited subset of included patients in whom laboratory data were
available throughout the first days after TCZ prescription, it is noteworthy that nonsurvivors showed a worrying higher rapid increase of IL-6 two days after TCZ infusion, as
well as worse evolution of LDH levels. The clinical relevance of these results might be
assessed in future studies in order to provide better help to physicians treating patients
at severe stage of COVID-19 disease.
Limitations
The results of the present study show several limitations that must be noted.
First, the study is retrospective in nature using real-world observational data, outside
the context of RCT. Second, we aimed to evaluate predictors of mortality in the subset
of patients receiving TCZ, with or without CS, but not to assess the efficacy of TCZ in
general population with COVID-19 illness, comparing treated and untreated groups.
Perhaps for this reason, the risk factors showed in our study may differ slightly from
those previously recognized in other observational studies [1,30]. Third, due to the
emergency situation, small variations to the standard clinical management of COVID-19
patients may not be totally ruled out as result from hospital reorganization, involving a
wide spectrum of departments and physician specialists. Fourth, the number of COVID19 patients presenting with PE and/or myocarditis may have been underestimated,
since symptoms are difficult to ascertain in severe COVID-19 patients and the d-dimer
and troponins are almost universally elevated. Finally, daily evolution of inflammatory
parameters throughout the first days after TCZ administration was registered in a limited
number of included patients, which does not allow firm conclusions to be drawn.
Conclusions
As most physicians worldwide, whereas the pandemic continues to spread
globally and our country is waiting for a second wave, we still tackle severe COVID‐19
utilizing a variety of immunomodulatory drugs on the only basis of available reports
providing valuable observational data, to come up with efficacious solutions quickly. In

our large series of 186 consecutive COVID-19 patients receiving TCZ for severe systemic
host-immune inflammatory response syndrome, multivariate analysis identified those
patients of older age, with a previous diagnosis of chronic heart failure or liver disease
to be at higher risk for in-hospital mortality. Conversely, the addition of CS to TCZ
therapy was shown to be protective in preventing in-hospital mortality. Unfortunately,
on the basis of the present study, it cannot be stated when would be the best time, not
too early nor too late, the best regimen and appropriated doses, to use
immunomodulatory agents during the clinical evolution of the COVID-19 illness. In this
respect, close monitoring of inflammatory markers, before and after treatment, may
lead clinicians and researchers conducting RCTs, to select the right patients in whom
immunomodulators such as TCZ and CS may be beneficial.
