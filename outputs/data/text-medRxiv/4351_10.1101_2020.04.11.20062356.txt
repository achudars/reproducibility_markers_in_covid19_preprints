ABSTRACT

25

Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to examine the maternal and fetal outcomes

26

in pregnant women with COVID-19 and also assess the incidence of maternal-fetal transmission

27

of SARS CO-V-2 infection.

28

Data sources: We searched PUMBED. Medline, Embase, MedRxiv and bioRxiv databases upto

29

3rd May 2020 utilizing combinations of word variants for “coronavirus” or “COVID-19” or

30

“severe acute respiratory syndrome” or “SARS-COV-2” and “pregnancy”. We also included

31

data from preprint articles.

32

Study eligibility criteria : Original case reports and case series on pregnant women with

33

diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

34

Study appraisal and synthesis methods : We included 50 studies reporting the information on

35

441 pregnant women and 391 neonates. The primary outcome measures were maternal health

36

characteristics and adverse pregnancy outcomes, neonatal outcomes and SARS-CoV-2 infection

37

in neonates was extracted. Treatments given to pregnant women with COVID-19 were also

38

recorded.

39

Results: Out of 441 women affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy, 387 women have delivered.

40

There are nine maternal deaths reported. In pregnant women with COVID-19, the most common

41

symptoms were fever (56%), cough (43%), myalgia (19%), dyspnea (18%) and diarrhea (6%).

42

Pneumonia was diagnosed by CT scan imaging in 96 % of COVID-19 pregnant women.

43

Pregnancy complications included delivery by cesarean section (80%), preterm labor (26%),

44

fetal distress (8%) and premature rupture of membranes (9%). Six still births (2%) are reported.

45

The most common co-morbidities associated with pregnant women with COVID-19 were

46

hypertensive disorders (10%), diabetes (9%), placental disorders (2%), co-infections (3%),

47

scarred uterus (3%) and hypothyroidism (3%). Amongst the neonates of COVID-19 mothers,

48

preterm birth (25%), respiratory distress syndrome (8%), pneumonia (8%) were reported. There

49

were four neonatal deaths reported. Vertical transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to

50

be 8%.

51

Conclusion

52

In pregnant women with COVID-19, hypertensive disorders and diabetes are common co-

53

morbidities and there is a risk of preterm delivery and maternal death. Amongst the neonates

54

born to mothers with COVID-19, respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia are common

55

occurrence. There are reports of still births and neonatal deaths. There is an evidence of vertical

56

transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection in women with COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

62

Coronaviruses are known to infect humans, other mammals, and birds causing respiratory,

63

enteric, hepatic, and neurologic diseases 1. Amongst these is a novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2,

64

first time reported from Wuhan in China in December 2019 and causes a potentially life-

65

threating respiratory disease termed as COVID-19 2. Since then, SARS-CoV-2 infection is

66

reported from every country in the world has rapidly spread across the globe creating a massive

67

public health problem. Owing to the high rates of human to human transmission, WHO declared

68

COVID-19 as a pandemic 3. More than 3.1 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and almost

69

2,24,172 reported deaths (upto 1st May, 2020), the pandemic has reportedly affected more than

70

180 countries/regions globally and majority of them are in local transmission phase4. Since this

71

virus has not been detected in humans before, limited information is available about its effect on

72

people; almost negligible information is available in pregnant women. Previously, members of

73

the coronavirus family such as (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-

74

CoV) are reported to be associated with severe complications during pregnancy like miscarriage,

75

fetal growth restriction, preterm birth and maternal deaths 5. During the influenza pandemic in

76

1918, there was a higher mortality (37%) among pregnant women as compared to mortality rate

77

in the overall population (2.6%)6. During the SARS Co-V pandemic in 2003, 50% of pregnant

78

women with SARS Co-V infection were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Out of these,

79

around 33% of pregnant required mechanical ventilation, with mortality rate of 25%7.

80
81

Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to respiratory pathogens and severe pneumonia,

82

due to various factors such as physiologic changes in the immune and cardiopulmonary systems

83

(e.g. elevation of the diaphragm, increased oxygen consumption, and edema of respiratory tract

mucosa), which make them at risk of hypoxia8. Furthermore, during the pandemic, hospital

85

visits may enhance the chances of infection and conversely lack of medical care during

86

pregnancy may do more harm. Hence, there is an urgent need to devise appropriate management

87

protocols for pregnant women to access maternal health care with minimum exposure risk is

88

desired during the current COVID-19 outbreak. However, this would require a thorough

89

situational analysis of COVID-19 and pregnancy.

91

OBJECTIVE

92

The aim of this systematic review was to assess the maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant

93

women with COVID-19. We also assessed if there is any evidence of the maternal-fetal

94

transmission of SARS CO-V-2 infection.

95

neonatologists to take evidence based decisions to manage pregnant women with COVID-19 and

96

their newborns. This information will also help the societies of obstetricians and gynecologists to

97

devise appropriate guidelines and management of pregnancy and coronavirus diseases in general.

We believe this information will aid obstetricians and

METHODS

100

Eligibility criteria, information sources, search strategy

101

We performed a systematic search in PUBMED, Medline, Google Scholar, preprint servers

102

medRxiv, bioRxiv and arXiv databases utilizing combinations of word variants for

103

“coronavirus”, 2019 n-COV. or “COVID-19” and “pregnancy”. The time line was restricted until

104

3rd May, 2020, no language restrictions were imposed (the articles were translated in English

105

using google translator). We also applied snowballing method to identify any missed articles. For

106

each search strategy, two authors (RG, DM) reviewed all the abstracts. Reviews, narrative

107

articles, abstracts, duplicates were excluded for analysis. One article in German language could

108

not be translated and hence excluded. Special attention was paid to exclude grey literature like

109

media reports, blogs and information from unverified sources. Since the publication of our

110

preprint in April 20209 , two studies from China were

111

characteristics and outcomes of 116 and 118 pregnant women with COVID-1910,11 . The data in

112

these studies were directly from hospital records10 or from medical records extracted from

113

National Health Commission of China11. We compared the information from our systematic

114

search and those of the two studies and observed there was a considerable overlap in the patient

115

population between the three datasets. Considering the risk of oversampling and the fact that our

116

literature search captured information on more women from China (n=319), both these studies

117

were excluded. The systematic review protocol was not registered due to the urgency of the

118

matter and we did not anticipate much of evidence. Considering the nature of the studies and the

119

outcome measures available, we could not adhere to all the guidelines of PRISMA. Although the

120

Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) reporting guidelines12 were followed. No patients or

121

public were involved in the study design, conduct or reporting of our analysis.

122

Study selection

123

The articles were shortlisted independently by DM and RG to include only the original studies

124

reporting information on pregnant women with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig.1).

125

The primary outcome measures were maternal clinical presentation, co-morbidities, adverse

126

pregnancy outcomes, neonatal outcomes and SARS-CoV-2 infection in neonates. Third author

127

(SM) coordinated the discussion for agreement of the shortlisted articles and looked for

128

inconsistencies by randomly selecting a subset of articles (20%). The data underwent two rounds

129

of iterations and verifications until all the inconsistencies in the data entries by RG and DM were

published that

described clinical

130

sorted and all the authors agreed on the outcome measures. The inherent nature of the studies

131

precluded us from ranking the quality of these studies.

132

Data extraction

133

Since most were case reports and case series, individual patient data was available from these

134

studies and entered in the table format. In the event the primary outcomes were not reported in

135

the studies, we assumed that these did not occur in the patients and were entered as absent. Data

136

was not available for the all the primary outcomes in all the included studies. Thus, for each

137

primary outcome, only studies where the information was available were included for

138

calculations and further analysis. As a secondary outcome RG independently collected data on

139

the treatments given to pregnant women with COVID-19. As the information is sparse, it could

140

not be organized systematically for analysis and hence it is only included in a narrative manner

141

in the present review.

142

RESULTS

143

Study selection

144

Overall, 1503 articles were identified through database searches and snowballing. After

145

screening and assessment of eligibility (Fig. 1); 50 studies were found eligible for inclusion and

146

analyzed in the systematic review (Supplementary table 1). These were mainly case series and

147

case reports from China (n=30)10–39, USA (n=4) 43–46, Iran (n=3)47–49 , one each from Australia50,

Study characteristics

151

In most of the studies, COVID-19 diagnosis in the pregnant women was confirmed by molecular

153

women (age range 20-49 years) was available; of which 387 have delivered which include 4 sets

154

of twins, 4 induced abortions, 6 still births and remaining are ongoing pregnancies

155

(Supplementary table 1). Three hundred and nineteen of the 441 pregnant women with COVID-

156

19 are from China and the rest (n= 122) were from other parts of the world. Ninety-five percent

157

of the women were in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and 5% of women had gestational age less

158

than 28 weeks. Almost 50% of cases, there was a history of the women residing either in the

159

epicenter of COVID-19 epidemic or they were in direct contact with COVID-19 confirmed

160

cases. In the remaining women the source of infection is unknown and is possibly via a

161

community transmission. Amongst the pregnant women with COVID-19, 80% underwent

162

cesarean section and the rest had vaginal delivery (Supplementary table 1). The reason for

163

cesarean section was either fetal distress or was an empirical decision made by the obstetricians

164

in consultation with the patients. In the reported studies, cesarean sections were reported to be

165

conducted in a negative-pressure isolation room by skillful medical team with enhanced personal

166

protective equipments (PPEs) including N95 masks, surgical cap, double gown, double gloves,

167

shoe covers, and powered air-purifying respirator for safe delivery.

Maternal complications in COVID-19

The detailed breakup of the individual studies reporting maternal presentations and outcomes are

170

given in Supplementary table 2 and the data is represented in Fig 2. The most common

171

symptoms were fever (56%), cough (43%) and myalgia (19%). In a proportion of women

172

dyspnea (18%) has also been reported. The major co-morbidities (Fig 2, Supplementary table 3)

173

reported in women with COVID-19 were hypertensive disorders (10%) which included

174

preeclampsia, gestational and chronic hypertension; diabetes (9%) including gestational diabetes,

175

Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM). The other co-morbidities were placental

176

abnormalities (2%), co-infections (3%), scarred uterus (3%) and hypothyroidism (3%).

177

Umbilical cord abnormalities were also reported in 2 cases. Placental abnormalities included

178

placenta previa, placenta accreta and abruptio placenta. The adverse pregnancy outcomes (Fig. 2)

179

included preterm labor (26%), fetal distress (8%), premature rupture of membranes [PROM

180

(9%)].

181

Serious morbidities were reported in 11% of pregnant women with COVID-19 as they required

182

ICU care with mechanical ventilation; of these, 10 women developed multi-organ dysfunction

183

and were kept on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Twenty four percent of

184

women required oxygen support with nasal cannula. Due to paucity of time, we could not contact

185

the authors of the original study to know the status of the patient kept on ECMO. Nine maternal

186

deaths are reported amongst the studies included.

187

Complications in infants born to COVID-19 mothers

188

Of the 391 neonates born to COVID-19 mothers, (Supplementary Table 4); neonatal data was

189

not available from all the pregnant women with COVID-19, conversely not all maternal

190

information was available in studies reporting neonatal outcomes of COVID-19 mothers. Thus,

191

the data in Supplementary table 1 and Supplementary table 4 may not completely overlap.

192

Table 1 gives the details of the neonatal data available from these studies. In all there were 78

193

male and 47 female neonates (ratio 1.6) born to COVID-19 mothers. Preterm birth was reported

194

in 25% of the neonates and Respiratory Distress Syndrome in 8%. There were six still births and

195

four neonatal deaths reported. A proportion of neonates were admitted to the neonatal intensive

196

care unit (NICU) with serious complications such as pneumonia (8%). Three hundred and

197

thirteen neonates were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infections by RT-PCR and or antibody assay. In

198

remaining neonates, the reasons for not testing were lack of reagents, non-willingness of parents

and refusal to consent. SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in 24/313 (8%) of neonates born to

200

mothers with COVID-19. Of these , 7% were positive by RT-PCR and 3% by antibody testing

method.

202

Mother to child transmission of COVID-19

203

To address the extent of maternal to fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, we carried out a

204

subgroup analysis where we compiled the data from the publications that explicitly reported the

205

neonatal SARS-CoV-2 testing by the type of laboratory method used (RT-PCR or antibody or

206

both), the neonatal samples tested and the time of testing. We further employed a strict criterion

207

to select the studies where the diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR or by presence of IgM

208

antibodies only within the first 48h of life and where the source of sampling was clearly

209

mentioned. Table 2 gives the details of the SARS-CoV-2 infected neonates reported in the

210

studies. In all, 261/313 neonates (84%) met the above criteria and of these, 21 tested positive for

211

SARS-CoV-2 resulting in a possible vertical transmission rate of 8% (Supplementary Table 5).

212

In one case amniotic fluid and in once case placenta and fetal membrane was also found to be

213

positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR.

214

Treatment and management of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women

215

Table 3 gives the treatments given to the pregnant women with COVID-19. Amongst the studies

216

selected, 327 women were reported to receive some form of treatment for COVID-19. In the

217

described cases and case series, most women received individual and/or combinations of several

218

antiviral drugs (63%) and antibiotics (55%) along with the steroids mainly methylprednisolone

219

(11%). Seven studies reported use of Hydroxychloroquine (23% of women) and four studies

220

reported use of traditional Chinese medicine (22% of women). However, the dosages, routes of

221

administration, duration and timings of the treatment were not detailed in most of these studies.

COMMENT

223

In this large systematic review of 441 pregnant women with COVID-19 from 16 countries, we

224

report a maternal death rate of 3%, still births (1.6%) and neonatal death rate of 1%.

225

Hypertensive disorders and diabetes are common co-morbidities; 26% of these women delivered

226

preterm with fetal distress and PROM being other pregnancy related complications. The adverse

227

neonatal outcomes associated with pregnant women with COVID-19 include neonatal respiratory

228

distress, and pneumonia. Almost these 8% of babies are born to mothers with COVID-19 had

229

SARS-CoV-2 infection.

230

Previous systematic reviews and large case series on pregnant women with COVID-19 are

231

mainly from China10,11,63–65 . The present systematic review is generated from 50 case series and

232

case reports from 16 countries of resulting in analysis 441 pregnant women with COVID-19. To

233

our knowledge, this is the largest systematic review available to date generating evidence on

234

pregnancy outcomes, complications and vertical transmission in women with COVID-19.

235

Irrespective of the country, the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in pregnant women were

236

heterogeneous. Amongst the pregnant women who were SARS-CoV-2 positive, 56% presented

237

with fever while 43% had cough. This numbers are lower than that in Chinese population which

238

reported cough and fever in nearly 70% of pregnant women with COVID-1911 . This observation

239

implies that the clinical presentation of the women with SARS-CoV-2 may vary significantly in

240

in different populations. In this regards, it is important to note that many women had mild

241

disease and nearly 50% of the pregnant women were asymptomatic on initial presentation and

242

were diagnosed with COVID-19 after admission for induction of labor. This was not only

243

observed in Chinese population but also reported in women in other countries. 32

244

These results imply that asymptomatic presentations are common in pregnant women and

245

represent a substantial risk of spreading the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community. Given the

246

numbers of exposed women, this is not unexpected and obstetricians must bear in mind that

247

during the pandemic, hospitals must be prepared to deal with such atypical situations. However;

248

the situation is alarming as it will increase the risk of exposure and infection to healthcare

249

providers attending these women. There was an evidence of risk to the healthcare providers and

250

four cases reported in this systematic review were physicians who acquired SARS-CoV-2

251

infection while providing clinical services to the COVID-19 patients 26,29.

252

Our observation highlights the need of appropriate precautions and use of protective measures

253

especially use of personal protective equipments (PPEs) to reduce the risk of COVID-19 to the

254

healthcare providers in obstetrics care. Our study also highlights the need of the universal

255

screening strategy in obstetric population as many women do not present with classical

256

symptoms or are even asymptomatic. Indeed, a recent study has shown that nearly 13% of

257

women were afebrile but were SARS-CoV-2 positive when admitted for delivery66 .

258

In this systematic review; hypertensive disorders, diabetes, and placental disorders were the top

259

three co-morbidities identified in pregnant women with COVID-19. A nationwide study of 1590

260

patients with COVID-19 in China reported hypertension (16.9%) and diabetes (8.2%) as the

261

commonest co-morbidities and risk factor for poor outcomes in COVID-19 34. Beyond these, co-

262

infections, scarred uterus, and hypothyroidism were other co-morbidities observed in the group

263

of pregnant women with COVID-19. Currently, there is no evidence whether thyroid disease is

264

associated with increased risk of viral infections in general and specifically COVID-19 nor is

265

there an association between thyroid disease and severity of the viral infection.

267

The adverse pregnancy outcomes reported in COVID-19 women were preterm labor, fetal

268

distress and premature rupture of membranes. For preterm births, China reports an incidence of

269

7.3 per 100 births or 6.7 per 100 live births36. However, the numbers of preterm birth observed in

270

women with COVID-19 is comparatively higher (26%). Whether, preterm birth is a secondary

271

complication of respiratory distress or induced directly due to viral infection needs to be

272

determined.

Beyond preterm births, post-partum a substantial number of women required oxygen support,

274

mechanical ventilation and ICU care. Treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation

275

(ECMO) was reported in some of the cases who became critically ill23,46. ECMO has been

276

utilized in pregnancy to support oxygenation for H1N1 influenza and refractory ARDS 69 and it is

277

considered as an alternative rescue strategy for COVID-1946. Thus, post-partum women with

278

COVID-19 are also at a risk of developing serious complications warranting emergency

279

preparedness by obstetricians, anesthetist and pulmonologists. Therefore, it is essential that

280

proper triage of patients should be implemented by carefully documenting prior medical and

281

surgical history to help identifying a subset of patients who are at risk of developing serious

282

adverse outcomes of COVID-19.

283

Maternal deaths due to infection are a matter of concern. The mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2

284

infection outside china is reported to be 1.5% and 3.6% in China

285

maternal death reported in studies from China; nine maternal deaths related to COVID-19 are

286

reported from Iran47,48. The authors are aware of two maternal deaths associated with COVID-19

287

in India (unpublished information). It must be highlighted herein that most of the studies

288

reported from China and elsewhere are women infected in the late third trimester or near term,

289

the two maternal deaths reported from Iran were infected in late second trimester/early third

38

. Although, there are no

290

trimester (28-30 weeks). It appears that COVID-19 in late second trimester or earlier third

291

trimester could be more detrimental to the pregnancy. However, more data from other parts of

292

the world on pregnant women with COVID-19 is required to get an estimate of maternal

293

mortality in this condition.

294
295

Viral infections during pregnancy such as influenza A are reported to be associated with adverse

296

neonatal outcomes and increased the risk of low birth weight babies40. Similar observation was

297

found in pregnancy with COVID-19. Low birth weight was reported in 8% of neonates born to

298

mothers with COVID-19 (data not shown). LBW is a risk factor for later life disease

299

susceptibility leading to chronic morbidity. Other common neonatal complications reported are

300

respiratory distress and pneumonia; spontaneous abortions, still births and neonatal deaths are

301

infrequently associated with corona virus infection in general. However, there were six still

302

births and four neonatal deaths reported. This data suggests a substantial adverse impact of

303

maternal COVID-19 on newborns. These observations strongly suggest the requirement of

304

special care to be given to the newborns of mothers with COVID-19.

305

In all, the present study estimates that 8% of the neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 have

306

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Initial studies reported that SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in placenta,

307

amniotic fluid, cord blood, and neonatal throat swab samples

series of 33 neonates born to COVID-19 women; 3 neonates were found to be positive for

309

SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR13.

313

upon molecular testing. While the reasons for such discrepancy could be multiple, a cause of

314

concern could be the possible false negative diagnosis by RT-PCR. It is possible that in the IgM-

315

positive RT-PCR-negative infants the viral load may be low and beyond the sensitivity of the

316

existing RT-PCR methods. In this context, we must highlight that 7% of neonates (even those

317

negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR) developed pneumonia within first two days of life. This

318

proportion is higher than the incidence of neonatal pneumonia in general population indicating

319

the possibility of infection by the virus and perhaps the RT-PCR has more false negatives.

320

Therefore, further studies should include rigorous clinical assessment of the newborn along with

321

IgM testing or employ more sensitive methods in newborn samples to determine the burden of

322

neonatal SARS-CoV-2.

323
324

The present study aimed to answer an important question that whether SARS-CoV-2 can be

325

transmitted from a pregnant mother to her fetus. This is more relevant based on the evidence of

326

vertical maternal-fetal transmission of recent emerging viral infections including Zika virus,

327

Ebola virus, Marburg virus which led to high maternal and infant mortality 46. Whether, SARS-

328

CoV-2 infection in the neonates was derived maternally or acquired ex utero is difficult to assess

329

from these studies. However, we addressed this problem by applying strict criteria to include

330

only those studies that clearly reported carrying out the diagnosis in the first 48h of life either by

331

RT-PCR or by IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. As IgM antibodies are not transferred to

332

the fetus via the placenta

333

48h of life are presumed to acquire the infection in utero. The analysis revealed the possibility of

334

intrauterine mother to child transmission, of SARS-CoV-2 in 8% of cases. The best practical

335

approach to confirm the virus in placenta, amniotic fluid, cord blood and neonatal pharyngeal

336

swab samples69. In one instance SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in the amniotic fluid by RT-

337

PCR

338

important to point out that in all these positive cases, the studies reported use of precautions like

339

delivery in negative pressure rooms, wearing of N95 masks by mother and PPE by health care

340

providers, and isolation of neonate immediately after delivery making an external acquisition

341

unlikely. While more data is awaited, in this direction; we must consider that there is a

342

reasonable possibility of mother to child transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and this may have long-

343

term implications to fetal heath. Policies must be devised keeping this gap in mind towards

344

management of COVID-19 mothers and infants.

46

one study reported viral mRNA in placental cotyledons and fetal membrane61. It is

345
346

At present, no specific treatments are available for COVID-19 and patients are symptomatically

347

managed. In the reported studies, authors have mentioned administration of antivirals,

348

antibiotics, steroids. Some studiers reported use of Hydroxychloroquine and some with

349

traditional Chinese medicine in the COVID-19 pregnant women. Some of the cases included the

350

systematic review reported incidences of thrombotic complications. Considering the

351

hypercoagulable state of pregnancy, high-prophylactic and therapeutic dosing of anticoagulation

352

was given in critically ill patients49. However, the doses administered, the time and route of

353

administration and the length of treatment are not specified in most studies. In absence of a well

354

reported data, it is hard to draw any conclusions on what could be the effective therapies for

355

COVID-19 in pregnancy.

356

As COVID‐19 still appears to be spreading exponentially, the number of pregnant women with

357

COVID-19 are likely to increase in different regions, countries, and continents. Therefore, at this

358

time, it is important that all the stakeholders including pregnant women, their families, general

public and healthcare providers, receive as updated, accurate and authentic information regularly.

360

We believe that this systematic review will act as a primer for future studies and development of

361

protocols for management of COVID-19 in pregnancy.

362
363

Study limitations

364

We could not contact the authors of the original studies to find out the status of women admitted

365

in ICU and neonates in NICU so the maternal death and neonatal death data cannot be

366

considered updated. As there were inconsistencies observed in some reports between the results

367

and discussion sections, we feel that there is an element of bias in the reported studies and

368

possibility of under-reporting of the symptoms by the authors. This may influence the

369

proportions of morbidity reported herein. Considering the nature of the studies and the urgency

370

of the situation, we could not strictly adhere to all the criteria for PRISMA and carry out a meta-

371

analysis.

372
373

Conclusions

374

There is substantial risk of adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with

375

COVID-19. Evidence is garnered on preterm birth as commonest adverse neonatal outcomes;

376

hypertensive disorders and GDM/DM and as co-morbid conditions in pregnant women with

377

SARS-CoV-2 infection. There is an evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection

378

in women with COVID-19.
