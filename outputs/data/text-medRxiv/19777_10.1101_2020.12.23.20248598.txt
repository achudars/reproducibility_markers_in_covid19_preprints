Abstract
In this study, we report the sequencing of 180 new viral genomes obtained from different
municipalities of the state of Rio de Janeiro from April to December 2020. We identified a novel
lineage of SARS-CoV-2, originated from B.1.1.28, distinguished by five single-nucleotide
variants (SNVs): C100U, C28253U, G28628U, G28975U, and C29754U. The SNV G23012A
(E484K), in the receptor-binding domain of Spike protein, was widely spread across the samples.
This mutation was previously associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2. This novel lineage emerged in late July being first detected by us in late October
and still mainly restricted to the capital of the state. However, as observed for other strains it can
be rapidly spread in the state. The significant increase in the frequency of this lineage raises
concerns about public health management and continuous need for genomic surveillance during
the second wave of infections.

Introduction
The first cases of the disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) were
reported in Wuhan province, in China, in December 2019. A few months later, in March 2020,
the virus had already spread worldwide, in a pandemic that has surpassed 76 million cases and
1,6 million deaths (​https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html​) in one year.
Since a vaccine is still unavailable for most people, controlling viral spread can be quite
challenging, especially in countries that have not implemented broad testing and isolation of
active cases. In this scenario, transmission suppression depends mainly on the continuous
population adherence to non-pharmacological strategies such as social distancing. In
mid-December, when this manuscript was prepared, European countries were already facing a
second wave of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. At the same time, Brazil was the country with the
third highest absolute number of COVID-19 cases and the second in lethality, with more than
7,200,000 cases and 186,000 deaths (​
https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html​).
Rio de Janeiro is the third Brazilian State in total inhabitants. According to data from December
14​th​, although Rio de Janeiro was also the second in the absolute number of COVID-19 cases, it
was the first in cumulative COVID-19 deaths in Brazil – 138 per 100,000 habitants. State's
capital accounts for the highest cumulative number of deaths in the State – 207 per 100,000
(​https://susanalitico.saude.gov.br/​). The active transmission sustained since March and the high
number of cases offer a suitable scenario for genomic surveillance. Such investigation is crucial
to define routes of viral spread, the outcome of new lineages, and possible variations in
transmissibility/infectivity or attenuation of SARS-CoV-2.

We have previously demonstrated the early spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil ​(1)​. Here, we report
the evolution of the epidemic in Rio de Janeiro since the early beginning, in April, until shortly
before the new increase in COVID-19 incidence in December. Based on the analysis of complete
viral genome sequences obtained from 180 patients from different municipalities, our data show
a rise in B.1.1.28 lineage frequency, from where a new variant lineage with five exclusive
mutations has emerged and rapidly spread.

Methods
Sample collection
A total of 180 participants, 82 males and 98 females, from 19 municipalities located at Rio de
Janeiro State, in Brazilian Southeast region, were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. The
study was conducted in partnership with the State Health Department of Rio de Janeiro. Most
patients are residents of the capital, Rio Janeiro (60,6%). Subjects were selected from April to
November, during CDC epidemiological weeks 15 to 45, from the cohorts of the Center for
COVID-19 diagnosis from Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and Central Laboratory Noel
Nutels, both in Rio de Janeiro and from the Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory Doutor Francisco
Rimolo Neto, in Maricá. Age distribution was highly variable, with a median of 39 years old
(range 16 to 87) (​Appendix 1 Table 1​). Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from each
participant and COVID-19 diagnosis was performed by RT-PCR using CDC protocol, using
primers and probes for N1 and N2 targets. The present study was approved by the National
Committee of Research Ethics and by the Ethics Committee from Hospital Universitário
Clementino Fraga Filho (protocol numbers: 30161620.0.1001.5257 and 34025020.0.0000.5257).
Next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis
cDNA synthesis and viral whole-genome amplification were carried out following the Artic
Network protocol (https://artic.network/ncov-2019). Amplicon libraries were prepared either
using the TruSeq DNA Nano kit or Nextera DNA Flex kit (Illumina, USA). Sequencing was
performed in a MiSeq System using MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (Illumina, USA). Quality assessment
of sequencing data was performed using FastQC (v0.11.4). Next, we filtered low-quality reads
(<25) with trimmomatic v0.39 ​(2)​. The sequences were mapped to the reference genome

NC_045512.2 using the BWA 0.7.17 software. We then generated the consensus genome
sequence using bcftools v1.10.2 and bedtools v2.29.2 packages ​(3–5)​. Single-nucleotide variants
(SNVs) were detected using the GATK v4.1.7.0 ​(6)​. We used the adegenet package in R to
perform clustering and discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) ​(7,8)​.

Phylogenetic and phylogeographic Analysis
Brazilian dataset contains the 180 new consensus genomes and 116 other Brazilian
high-coverage genomes available in GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/) with collection dates
ranging from May to November (Data downloaded from GSAID December 03, 2020). We
appended this Brazilian dataset to a global dataset including 1081 genomes sampled from
GISAID to include one genome per country per week (based on sample collection day), from
May to November 2020 (​Appendix 2​).
To obtain a Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogeny, we ran IQTree 2.0.3 ​(9)​under a GTR model
of nucleotide substitution ​(10)​with empirical base frequencies and invariant sites. This model
configuration was selected using IQ-Tree’s ModelFinder tool. We screened our datasets for
recombination using the Phi-test approach in SplitsTree ​(11,12)​and found no recombination
evidence. We identified three Clades, I, II, and III, in the ML tree as monophyletic clusters that
encompass the great majority of Rio de Janeiro genomes with at least three or more sequences
from Rio de Janeiro clustered within the same clade.
Then, ML phylogeny was estimated for each of the three clades. We assessed the temporal signal
of each Clade dataset using TempEst 1.5.3 ​(13)​and removed the outlier sequences. Root-to-tip
linear regression coefficient of genetic divergence against sampling dates 0.51, 0.71 and 0.88, for

Clade I, II and III, respectively (Figure S1). The time-calibrated phylogenies were estimated
under a strict molecular clock in BEAST v.1.10.4 ​(14)​using the GTR+I ​(10)​nucleotide
substitution model for Clades I and II, and HKY nucleotide substitution model ​(15)​for Clade III.
We assumed an exponential growth tree prior and specified a normal prior for the clock rate with
mean = 8x10-4 and stdev = 0,1x10-5. We also used a discrete diffusion model ​(16)​to infer the
state of each internal node of the phylogeny, considering the location as a discrete trait with only
three possible states: “RJ”, “Brazil”, and “Others”. The convergence of the MCMC chains,
which were run at least for 20 million generations and sampled every 1000th step, was inspected
using Tracer v.1.7.1 ​(17)​. Maximum clade credibility (MCC) summary trees were generated
using TreeAnnotator v.1.10.4 ​(14)​.
We used a relaxed random walk diffusion model ​(18)​available in BEAST 1.10 ​(14)​with a
Cauchy distribution to estimate trees whose internal nodes are associated with geographic
coordinates. We ran an independent analysis for each Rio de Janeiro Clade identified previously,
excluding all genomes for whose geographical coordinates were not known. We attributed each
genome's latitude and longitude to a point randomly sampled within the patient’s municipality of
residence (Appendix 1 Table 1). MCMC chains were run for 10 million generations and logged
every 1000th step, with convergence assessed using Tracer v1.7.1 ​(17)​. We used the spread3
package ​(19)​to extract and map spatiotemporal information embedded in posterior trees.

Results
On average, the viral genome assembly reached 99% of the sites coveraged, with a depth mean
greater than 3500x (​Appendix 1​ ​Table 2​). We found a total of 731 single-nucleotide variants
(SNVs) across the 180 samples, of which 50.3% were missense, 44.5% synonymous, 5.1%
intergenic and 0.1% nonsense (​Appendix 1​ ​Table 3​). Most of the variants were identified
exclusively in one sample with an allele frequency lower than 1%. The SNVs with allele
frequencies greater than 60% corresponded to the mutational signatures of viral lineages derived
from B.1.1 (​Figure 1A​). We also found ten variants with intermediate frequencies between
20-35% of which five occurred together in many samples.
Per kilobase genetic screening revealed the highest mutation ratio in the 3' end of the genome,
mainly targeting ORF3a and N proteins (​Figure 1A​; ​Appendix 1 Table 4​). These regions were
also identified using a per-protein screening, in addition to ORF9c and other proteins (​Appendix
1 Table 5​). The high number of mutations found in ORF3a was due to the accumulation of
non-synonymous variations throughout the genome (​Figure S2​). This pattern was found
exclusively in ORF3a and S proteins, whereas a balanced acquisition of novel synonymous and
non-synonymous SNVs was observed in N and ORF9c (​Figure S2​). Similar results were
obtained in other structural and non-structural proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (​Figure S2​).
B.1.1.33 (58%) and B.1.1.28 (32%) represented the overwhelming majority of viral lineages
spread in Rio de Janeiro (​Appendix 1 Table 1​). Nevertheless, the co-occurrence of
intermediate-frequency SNVs may suggest the emergence of novel variant lineages during the
epidemic. We then applied a K-means algorithm combined with a discriminant analysis of
principal components (DAPC) to ascertain the dynamic of population structure during the course

of the epidemic in Rio de Janeiro. By retaining the first 100 principal components, we achieved
approximately 90% of genetic variability in our samples (​Figure S3A​). Bayesian information
criterion (BIC) values showed an optimal clusterization of four different groups: B.1.1.28 and
B.1.1.33 lineages and two additional clusters, named Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 (​Figure 1B; Figure
S3B​). Thirty-two out of the 180 samples were assigned to the B.1.1.28 cluster characterized by
the missense variant G25088U (V1176F) in S protein, also shared among all samples from
Cluster 1 (​Figure 1C​). The greatest number of samples (n=103) was observed in cluster
B.1.1.33, represented by two missense variants U27299C (I33T) and U29148C (I292T) in ORF6
and N proteins, respectively.
Cluster 1 was composed of 38 samples, predominantly from B.1.1.28 lineage, detected after
early October (​Figure 1D​). This cluster was characterized by the co-occurrence of five exclusive
variants. Two variants mapped the 5’ and 3’ end (C100U and C29754U) respectively, a
synonymous C28253U (F120F) in ORF8, and two missense G28628U (A119S) and G28975U
(M234I) in N protein. In addition to these five variants, we also found the substitution G23012A
(E484K) in S protein across 36 out of the 38 samples in this group. In cluster 2, one exclusive
missense variant C28087U (A65V) in ORF8 was found across all seven samples. We also
observed three SNVs G21641U (A27S), C22088U (L176F), and C26735U (Y71Y) targeting S
and M in four out of the seven samples from this cluster. Samples from B.1.1.28 lineage and
Cluster 1 were predominantly found in samples collected close to the state's capital, whereas
B.1.1.33 and Cluster 2 were also detected in other regions of the state (​Appendix 1 Table 1​).
Next, we tested the monophyletic status of Clusters 1 and 2 to identify whether they are possible
emerging lineages. The phylogenetic reconstruction of a worldwide dataset with more than a
thousand viruses confirmed that the 38 genomes from Cluster 1 formed a well supported

monophyletic clade located inside a larger clade composed of B.1.1.28 strains (Figure 2). The
monophyletic condition was not observed for the seven samples of Cluster 2, although they are
all within clade B.1.1.33.
We also observed that the vast majority (86.8%) of Brazilian genomes collected between May
and November 2020 (257 out of 296) fall within three clades named hereafter Clade I, Clade II,
and Clade III (Figure 2). Clade I is composed of B.1.1.33 strains, while Clade II and III are
composed of B.1.1.28 viruses. Other lineages, like B.1 and B.1.1, were also sampled but had a
minor contribution to establishing the epidemics in Brazil. None of those three lineages appear
within the strains composing any of the three clades. Clade I encompasses 55% of the Brazilian
genomes (165 out of 296), followed by Clade II with 26% and Clade III with 4%. Rio de Janeiro
strains were also almost restricted to those clades (200 out of 220; 90.9%), with 63.2% of Rio de
Janeiro strains within Clade I; 24.1% within Clade II; and 3.6% within Clade III. Further
analyses were only performed with those three clades as they contain the vast majority of
samples from Rio de Janeiro.
Emergence of Cluster 1 was dated around early July 2020 (Figure 3). Interestingly, the most
recent sample from the new variant lineage dates from the late of October, almost four months
after it's estimated emergence. A clear pattern of clustering can be observed from Rio de Janeiro
viruses, since they appear to be more related to each other than to the different localities. Even
in the complete dataset analysis, it is possible to observe clades exclusively from Rio de Janeiro
(Figure 2). We inferred the location of ancestral nodes with our discrete phylogeographic
analysis and, as expected, the state inferred for most internal nodes in the three clades is Rio de
Janeiro (Figure 3). Most of our samples are within clades whose ancestral location is Rio de

Janeiro, and the clades with Rio de Janeiro ancestral state are almost exclusively composed of
viruses from that location.
We performed a continuous phylogeographic reconstruction to model the virus spread across the
state (​Figure 4​). We estimated that the Rio de Janeiro city represented the primary source of
virus strains circulating within the state. Our reconstructions also reveal the occurrence of few
long-distance dispersal events from the capital to more remote areas of the state. We inferred few
lineage movements towards the state's capital, all from the Maricá city.

Discussion
In this study, we identified a novel circulating strain of SARS-CoV-2 originated from B.1.1.28
lineage and widely spread in Rio de Janeiro state. We estimate that the novel lineage emerged in
early July, approximately four months before the detection of the first genomes from this lineage.
We demonstrated that the COVID-19 epidemic in Rio de Janeiro was characterized by three
main clades, of which two represented the vast majority of the circulating viruses, classified as
B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 lineages. Interestingly, this division of three clades was also observed in
Brazil during the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic ​(1)​.
According to our results, Rio de Janeiro sequences were also mainly restricted to those three
clades, and more often related to each other than to strains from other states or outside the
country. This pattern suggests a limited contribution of foreign viruses to the composition of Rio
de Janeiro lineages. However, these results could be biased due to the scarcity of Brazilian
samples. Whether this aggregation pattern of Rio de Janeiro genomes with few inferred
introduction events is due to the high communitarian transmission, or a consequence of low
sampling, needs further investigation. Despite the low sampling ratio, our data indicate that the
transmission chains circulating in Rio de Janeiro were established by a restricted number of
infectious cases, a fact that was not observed in other reports where there is an important
contribution of external introduction events and no predominant lineage was identified ​(20,21)​.
We noticed an alteration in the relative proportion of genomes sampled from each lineage in
Brazil through time. Analyzing our data together with the genomes available in GISAID, we
observed that B.1.1.28 samples are becoming more frequent in the country (Figure 5). In
addition, the increase in the B.1.1.28 relative frequency is synchronous with the age inferred for

the ancestral of the novel variant lineage. The emergence of this lineage can probably be
associated with the elevation in the number of the COVID-19 cases (so called second wave) in
the state. Together with the pre-existing circulating viral lineages in Rio de Janeiro, the second
wave of infection may be characterized by the presence of this emergent lineage.
Many mutations arise frequently in the SARS-CoV-2 genome during the virus replication cycle
and intra-host defense mechanisms ​(22)​. However, most of these variants are lost as a result of
the natural selection process, which also lead to fixation of some variants in the population. The
co-occurence of fixed mutations in the population will characterize the novel viral lineage.
Indeed, novel SARS-CoV-2 lineages are arising in several regions around the world ​(23)​.
Recently, phylogenetic analysis revealed a novel emergent SARS-CoV-2 lineage in the United
Kingdom mainly distinguished by the variant A23063T (N501Y) targeting the receptor-binding
domain (RBD) in Spike protein. Interestingly, beside the five SNVs that characterized our novel
lineage, we also identified the mutation G23012A (E484K) in the RBD region of Spike protein.
This alteration was previously associated with the escape from neutralizing antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2 ​(24,25)​. Nevertheless, further analyses are required to predict whether the changes
in these novel lineages have an important effect on viral infectivity, host immune response or
disease severity. Experimental analyses are also needed to understand the molecular and
physiological implications of these variations.
Efforts to continuously monitor the virus evolution during the course of the pandemic are crucial
to assess the dynamic of infection and population structure. Nonetheless, genomic surveillance is
still being a challenge in Brazil given the low number of sequences generated during this period.
Our study has provided a significant increase in the number of genomes available in public
databases from Rio de Janeiro and consequently from Brazil (adding 180 new near complete

genomes to the 314 already available in GISAID). Finally, as of 18 Dezember 2020, when we
were writing this work, four sequences harboring the same five exclusive variants of the new
variant lineage were already found in the United Kingdom and United States (GISAID accession
numbers EPI_ISL_668335, EPI_ISL_677211, EPI_ISL_677212, EPI_ISL_683969). The
collection dates were all more recent than ours (ranging from 2020-11-12 to 2020-11-14).
Ultimately, this may indicate the introduction of this Brazilian lineage worldwide.
