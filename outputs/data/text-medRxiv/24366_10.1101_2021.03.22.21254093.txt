ABSTRACT
Study Objectives: To quantify the association between race/ethnicity and maternal and infant
self-reported sleep health at 4 months, exploring the role of maternal depression, stress and
symptoms of trauma related to the COVID-19 pandemic as potential mediators. Methods:
Participants were recruited as part of the COVID-19 Mother Baby Outcomes (COMBO) cohort at
Columbia University (N=71 non-Hispanic White, N=14 African American (AA), N=113 Hispanic,
N=40 other/declined). Data on infant sleep were collected at 4 months postpartum. A subset of
149 women also completed questionnaires assessing maternal mental health and sleep.
Multivariable regressions were used to separately estimate associations of race/ethnicity and
mental health with multiple sleep domains for infants and mothers adjusting for individual-level
covariates. Results: Compared to non-Hispanic White, Hispanic infants slept less at night (β=101.7±17.6, p<0.0001) and AA and Hispanic infants went to bed later (respectively β =1.9±0.6,
p<0.0001, β=1.7±0.3, p<0.0001). Hispanic mothers were less likely to perceive infant sleep as a
problem (β=1.0±0.3, p=0.006). Compared to non-Hispanic White mothers, Hispanic mothers
reported worse maternal sleep latency (β=1.2±0.4, p=0.002), and efficiency (β=0.8±0.4, p=0.03),
but better subjective sleep quality (β=-0.7±0.4, p=0.05), and less daytime dysfunction (β=-0.8±0.4,
p=0.04). Maternal mental health scores were statistically significant predictors of multiple domains
of maternal sleep but did not mediate the association between race/ethnicity and sleep.
Conclusions: Racial/ethnic disparities in maternal and infant sleep are observable at 4 months
post-partum. Maternal stress, depression and symptoms of trauma related to the COVID-19
pandemic did not mediate these associations.

INTRODUCTION:
Sleep health is an essential component of general health and it is associated with numerous
mental and physical health outcomes in the general population.1,2 The postpartum period poses
unique challenges to mothers with respect to maintaining good sleep health.3 In the perinatal
period, poor sleep has been associated with numerous maternal physical and mental outcomes,
such as changes in interpersonal relationships, risk of postpartum weight retention, and perinatal
mood disorders.4–6 For the infant, the early postnatal period is characterized by rapid development
of sleep and wake patterns, marking a major neurobiological milestone. Infants’ sleep problems
have been reported in up to 15–25% of infants7 and are a source for concerns for both parents
and pediatricians. Such sleep problems have been reported to negatively affect physical,
cognitive, and socioemotional development.8–11 In addition to the direct adverse impact on infants
and young children, several studies have indicated that poor sleep in infancy and childhood also
affects parental levels of stress, depression, sense of competence, and overall quality of life,12–14
which could further compound the negative impact on infant development.
Despite these known risks, increasing evidence indicates that we are in the middle of a sleep
crisis, with 70 million American adults estimated to suffer from chronic sleep loss and sleep
disorders.15 This crisis also applies to children such that the average child sleep duration has
decreased over the last century, with children sleeping 0.75 min less per year, on average, since
1905,16 and almost one third of children in the United States getting a sub-optimal amount of sleep
at least once a week.17 However, the burden of poor sleep health is not experienced equally
across the U.S. population. Individuals from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds have been shown
to experience worse sleep health,18–20 but less is known about racial/ethnic disparities in sleep in
the post-partum period.21,22 Similar racial/ethnic disparities in sleep have also been reported for
children, such that racial/ethnic minority children compared to their White counterparts are

reporting to have the highest rates of insufficient sleep.23 A few studies have focused on the infant
period and results suggest emergence of sleep disparities early on in life.24,25 While these studies
suggest that racial/ethnic disparities in sleep exist across the life span, the potential pathways for
the relationship between race/ethnicity and poor sleep have not been fully understood. One
hypothesized pathway is that of psychosocial stress, which has been shown to be associated with
poor sleep26,27 and has been reported to disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities.28–30 In
addition, most recently, racial and ethnic minorities have been disproportionately affected by the
COVID-19 pandemic,31–33 which itself represents a major psychosocial stressor.34
To our knowledge, no published study exists investigating racial/ethnic disparities in infant and
maternal sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we investigate racial/ethnic disparities in
sleep both in infants and mothers at 4 months post-partum, leveraging data collected as part of
the COVID-19 Mother-Baby Outcomes (COMBO) initiative at Columbia University Irving Medical
Center. The sample of this cohort is racially/ethnically diverse and since many participants gave
birth at the height of the pandemic, it represents a unique opportunity to investigate relationships
among race/ethnicity, psychosocial risk factors during the COVID-19 pandemic, and motherinfant sleep.
METHODS
Participants and study design
Participants were recruited as part of the COMBO cohort at Columbia University Irving Medical
Center (www.ps.columbia.edu/COMBO), which aims to comprehensively describe the health of
mother-infant dyads during the COVID-19 pandemic. All procedures were approved by the
Columbia University Institutional Review Board. Eligible mothers delivered newborns at one of
two Columbia University-affiliated New York-Presbyterian Hospitals, the Morgan Stanley
Children’s Hospital or the Allen Hospital in New York City (NYC). On March 22, 2020,
universal SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing via nasal swab was initiated for all women admitted to labor
and delivery units. Starting in July 2020, all laboring mothers were also tested for COVID-19
antibodies. All mothers who gave birth at Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital or Allen Hospital
since March 22, 2020 and who had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive test result during
pregnancy or a SARS-CoV-2 positive antibody test result with a confirmed or suspected
infection onset during pregnancy were approached for inclusion in the COVID-19 positive group
of COMBO. For each enrolled COVID-19 positive mother-baby dyad, a minimum of one casematched dyad was approached for enrollment into the control group. Control mothers must have
had negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR and antibody testing at admission to labor and delivery, no
history of COVID-like symptoms, and no history of a positive COVID-19 test at any point during
pregnancy. Control dyads were matched based on infant sex, gestational age in two-week
windows, mode of delivery, and date of birth within approximately 1 week. A subset of
participants was initially approached to enroll in the prenatal arm of the COMBO study. Prior to
delivery, they were asked to complete the COVID-19 Perinatal Experiences (COPE) survey to
collect information on maternal mental and physical health during pregnancy. These participants
were subsequently enrolled in the postnatal arm of the COMBO study after giving birth and were
enrolled regardless of COVID-19 status and without case-matching. An additional group of
mothers who gave birth prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in NYC, during the month
of February 2020, were also approached for enrollment as a control group for pandemic-related
stress during pregnancy. All surveys were administered through the Columbia University Irving
Medical Center REDCap system (version 10.6.2) and participants were offered the option to
complete them in English or Spanish. After delivery, mothers were invited to complete the online
surveys at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9 months of age.

Race/ethnicity:
The main exposure variable was maternal racial/ethnic background. As part of hospital intake
records and through the online surveys, mothers self-reported their ethnic background as ‘nonHispanic’, ‘Hispanic’, or ‘decline to answer’ and were also asked to specify their racial background
choosing from categories recommended by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as ‘White’,
‘Black or African American’, ‘Asian’, ‘American Indian or Alaskan Native’, ‘Native Hawaiian or
other Pacific Islander’, and/or ‘Other’. We combined these 2 variables to obtain one single
race/ethnicity variable as follows: non-Hispanic White (W), African American (AA), Hispanic (H),
and other (O).
Sleep and mental health measures:
The primary outcomes were mothers' report of their infant's sleep health as measured by the Brief
Infant Sleep Questionnaire (BISQ),35 and of their own sleep as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep
Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire (Cronbach's alpha 0.83).36
The entire cohort completed the BISQ infant sleep questionnaire. From the BISQ we extracted
the following measures: 1) nighttime sleep duration, 2) daytime sleep duration, 3) total sleep
duration, 4) number of night awakenings, 5) amount of wakefulness during the night, 6) sleep
latency, 7) bedtime, and 8) infant’s sleep perceived as a problem by the mother.
One-hundred and forty-nine women out of the total sample of 238 women also completed the
PSQI. From the PSQI we extracted the following measures: 1) subjective sleep quality, 2) sleep
latency, 3) sleep duration at night, 4) sleep efficiency, 5) sleep disturbances, 6) use of sleep
medication, 7) daytime dysfunction, and 8) overall sleep health. This same subset of mothers also
completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9, Cronbach's alpha 0.851)37 to assess
severity of depressive symptoms, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS, Cronbach's alpha 0.82)38 to
assess levels of perceived stress, and the post-traumatic stress PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL5) adapted for COVID-19 (see Supplementary Material for this adapted scale).
Other measures:
We collected information on infant sex, gestational age at birth, maternal age at delivery, and
health insurance status (commercial versus Medicaid) from the electronic medical records. In
addition, we defined maternal COVID-19 status, as 1) control pre-pandemic, 2) negative, 3)
positive. Positive indicated that the participant had tested positive by PCR or serology at any point
during pregnancy. Negative indicated that participant had not had a known COVID-19 infection at
any point in pregnancy and had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR and/or antibody testing
at the time of delivery. The subset of mothers who completed the PSQI, PHQ-9, PSS, and PCL
do not include any pre-pandemic control participants.
Statistical analysis:
We tested for normal distribution of continuous variables obtained from the BISQ. In case of not
normally distributed variables (amount of wakefulness during the night, sleep latency, bedtime)
we discretized them and transformed from continuous to ordinal. Then, we used multiple
linear/ordinal/logistic regression models to assess the independent associations of maternal
race/ethnicity on maternal and infant sleep variables with non-Hispanic White group as reference.
Regression models were adjusted for infant sex, gestational age at birth, and age in weeks at
time of assessment in Model 1. No adjustments were made for regression models predicting
maternal sleep in Model 1. Given that maternal socio-economic status (SES) has the potential to
be a confounder of the relationship between race/ethnicity and maternal and infant sleep, Model
2 also adjusted for health insurance status as an indicator of SES, with commercial insurance as
reference group. Two additional models tested the potential effects of SARS-CoV-2 prenatal
exposure versus pandemic-related stress, respectively. In Model 3, we adjusted for COVID-19
status, with control pre-pandemic mothers as reference group. In Model 4, we adjusted for

delivery timing with respect to the pandemic in New York City, which had a sharp peak in MarchApril 2020, to understand the different impact of various phases on the pandemic on maternal
and infant sleep. Time periods of the pandemic at delivery were grouped in 2 months bin based
on infant date of birth: 1) pre pandemic controls, 2) March-April 2020, 3) May-June 2020, 4) JulyAugust 2020, and 5) September-October 2020.
After Bonferroni adjustments for multiple comparison analyses, the adjusted p-values for analyses
on infant and maternal sleep measures was p=0.006.
We ran successive multiple linear/ordinal/logistic regression models to assess the independent
associations of PHQ-9, PSS, and PCL-5-COVID scores with maternal and infant sleep variables.
We performed mediation analysis via the CMAverse R package39 to assess whether PHQ-9, PSS
and PCL scores were mediators in the relationship between race/ethnicity and maternal and infant
sleep variables. The mediation was tested only for non-Hispanic White and Hispanic mothers.
RESULTS
Infants included in this analysis were born between 2/1/20 and 9/30/20. The racial/ethnic
composition of the entire sample was 71 non-Hispanic White, 14 African American, 113 Hispanic
and 40 other. Additional demographics are in Table 1. The racial/ethnic composition of the subset
of mothers who also completed the PSQI and the mental health questionnaires was 44 White
non-Hispanic, 8 African American, 70 Hispanic and 27 other. The subset was not significantly
different from the entire subset for any socio-demographic variable, except for infant’s age at the
assessment, with infants from the subset being younger (p<0.001) and COVID-19 status, since
in the subset there were no pre-pandemic control mothers. Additional socio-demographics for the
subset are presented in Table S1.
Infants sleep by race/ethnicity
Table 2 displays infant sleep variables across racial/ethnic groups.
The results of the multivariable regression models for Model 1, with maternal race/ethnicity
predicting infant sleep variables and infant’s sex and gestational age at birth as covariates,
indicated that compared to non-Hispanic White infants, Hispanic infants and infants from other
race/ethnicities slept less at night, and African American infants showed the same directional
trend (H: β=-101.7±17.6, p<0.0001, O: β=-64.7±23.0, p=0.005, AA: β=-63.6±33.2, p=0.06).

1. Compared to non-Hispanic White infants, African American infants had longer sleep latency
(β=1.2±0.6 p=0.03, OR 3.4 CI 1.1-10.5) and African American, Hispanic and infants from other
race/ethnicities had later bedtimes (AA: β=1.9±0.6, p<0.001, OR 6.7 CI 2.2-20.2, H:β=1.7±0.3,
p<0.001, OR 5.3 CI 2.9-9.8, O: β=0.9±0.4, p=0.01 OR 2.6 CI 1.2-5.3). Lastly, compared to nonHispanic White mothers, fewer Hispanic mothers perceived their infant‘s sleep as a problem
(β=1.0±0.35, p=0.006 OR 2.7 CI 1.3-5.4). Figure 2 shows differences by race/ethnicity in sleep
latency, bedtime, and infant’s sleep considered as a problem by the mother.
The covariates included in Model 1 were significant predictors for several sleep domains.
Gestational age was positively associated with night time sleep duration (β=15.3±4.5, p<0.000),
total sleep duration (β=14.9±6.4, p=0.02), and earlier bedtime (β=-0.25±0.07, p<0.000 OR 0.8
CI 0.7-0.9). Weeks at assessment was negatively associated with daytime sleep duration (β=7.3±3.0, p=0.01), number of awakenings (β=-0.2±0.06, p=0.001, odds ratio [OR] 0.8 95%
confidence interval [CI] 0.7-0.9), and sleep latency (β=-0.1±0.05 p=0.02, OR 0.9 CI 0.8-1.0).
Male infants woke up more during the night (β=0.6±0.3, p=0.03 OR 1.8 CI 1.1-3.0) and their
mothers were less likely to report their infant’s sleep as a problem (β=-0.6±0.3, p=0.04 OR 0.5
CI 0.3-1.0).
Results from Model 2, in which we added health insurance status as an indicator of SES in the
model, showed that similar differences by race/ethnicity were replicated for night and day sleep
duration, latency, and bedtime. In addition, Hispanic infants had fewer nighttime awakenings
compared to non-Hispanic Whites (H: β=-0.4±0.2, p=0.05). Maternal perception of infant’s sleep
as a problem trended in the same direction but was no longer significant. Health insurance
status was a significant predictor of bedtime, with infants from the Medicaid group going to bed
later compared to infants with commercial health insurance (β=0.9±0.3, p=0.003 OR 2.4 CI 1.34.3).
Results from Model 3, in which we added maternal COVID-19 status, showed that the estimates
associated with race/ethnicity on night and daytime sleep duration, latency, nighttime
awakenings, and bedtime did not change appreciably. Maternal COVID-19 status during
pregnancy was not a significant predictor of any domain of infant’s sleep at 4 months.
Results from Model 4, in which we added maternal time of delivery during the pandemic,
showed that the estimates associated with race/ethnicity on night and daytime sleep duration,
latency, nighttime awakenings and bedtime did not change appreciably. Time of the pandemic
was associated only with sleep latency, with infants born in July-August having longer latency

Maternal sleep by race/ethnicity
Table 3 displays maternal sleep variables across racial/ethnic groups.
The results of the multivariable regression models for Model 1, with race/ethnicity predicting
maternal sleep variables indicated that compared to non-Hispanic White women, Hispanic and
women from other race/ethnicities reported better subjective sleep quality (H: β=-0.7±0.4, p=0.05
OR 0.5 CI 0.24-0.99, O: β=-0.9±0.4, p=0.05 OR 0.4 CI 0.16-0.98). Nonetheless, compared to
non-Hispanic White women, Hispanic women reported longer sleep latency (β=1.2±0.4, p=0.002
OR 3.2 CI 1.5-6.9), and worse efficiency (β=0.8±0.4, p=0.03 OR 2.2 CI 1.1-4.5). Women from
other race/ethnicities reported less disturbances (β=-1.06 ±0.5, p=0.03 OR 0.34 CI 0.13-0.91).
Hispanic women reported less daytime dysfunction (β=-0.8±0.4, p=0.04 OR 0.45 CI 0.21-0.95).
Results from Model 2, in which we added health insurance as an indicator of SES in the model,

dysfunction did not change appreciably, while for other domains differences by race/ethnicity were
not significant anymore.
Results from Model 3, in which we added COVID-19 status to the model, showed that the
estimates associated with race/ethnicity on latency, disturbances, and daytime dysfunction did
not change appreciably. Positive versus negative COVID-19 status during pregnancy did not have
any significant effects on maternal sleep measures at 4 months postpartum.
Results from Model 4, in which we added maternal time of delivery during the pandemic, showed
that the estimates associated with race/ethnicity on latency and daytime dysfunction did not
change appreciably. In addition, birth timing with respect to the pandemic was associated with
several sleep domains. Compared to the group who delivered in March-April, the group who
delivered in May-June had worse subjective sleep quality (β=1.2±0.5, p=0.02 OR 3.4 CI 1.2-10.1),
longer sleep latency (β=1.3±0.6, p=0.02 OR 3.7 CI 1.3-11.5), more sleep disturbances
(β=1.5±0.6, p=0.01 OR 4.4 CI 1.4-14.5), and worse overall sleep (β=1.0±0.5, p=0.04 OR 2.7 CI
1.0-7.3). Compared to the group who delivered in March-April, the group who delivered in JulyAugust had longer sleep latency (β=1.3±0.5, p=0.01 OR 3.7 CI 1.3-10.9), more sleep disturbances

pandemic.
For results for Models 2, 3, and 4 see Supplementary materials for additional information on
statistical results.
Table 5 shows statistical results for all infant sleep domains for the 4 models.
Maternal mental health
Mothers reported an average PSS score of 18.2 (sd 7.6), with 23.8% of the mothers reporting
significant levels of perceived stress (PSS score ≥25)40. Mothers reported an average PCL-5COVID score of 7.7 (7.6) and an average PHQ-9 score of 2.4 (2.6), with 15.2% presenting mild
levels of depression (PHQ-9 score: 5-9), 3% moderate (PHQ-9 score: 10-14) and 0.6%
moderately severe (PHQ-9 score: 15-19).
Neither the PSS nor the PCL-5-COVID were significant predictors of infant sleep measures. The
PHQ-9 was positively associated with maternal perception of sleep as a problem (β=0.1±0.06,
p=0.05). Regarding the relationship between maternal mental health and maternal sleep, higher
PSS scores were associated with poorer subjective sleep quality (β=0.08±0.02, p<0.000), longer
sleep latency (β=0.06±0.02, p=0.002), more sleep disturbances (β=0.1±0.02, p<0.000), more
daytime dysfunction (β=0.1±0.02, p<0.000), and overall higher global PSQI scores (β=0.08±0.02,
p<0.000). Higher PCL-5-COVID scores were also associated with poorer subjective sleep quality
(β=0.07±0.02, p=0.001), longer sleep latency (β=0.07±0.02, p<0.000), more sleep disturbances
(β=0.1±0.02, p<0.000), more daytime dysfunction (β=0.1±0.02, p<0.000), and overall higher

Mediation analysis
We found no associations between race/ethnicity and scores on the PHQ-9, PSS, or PCL-5COVID. Results from mediation analysis showed no significant result.
DISCUSSIONS
In this prospective cohort, we found marked disparities in the sleep health of both mothers and
infants by race/ethnicity at 4 months post-partum. Compared to white non-Hispanic infants, AA
infants had longer sleep latency and went to bed later. Hispanic infants slept more during the day
but less at night and in total and went to bed later. Observed differences in multiple sleep domains
across race/ethnicity were independent of gestational age at birth, age at assessment (in weeks),
and infant sex. These findings are consistent with previous literature indicating racial and ethnic
differences in sleep duration in infancy.24,41 Extending previous results, we also report differences
by race/ethnicity for several sleep domains. Later bedtime for Hispanic and AA children had been
previously reported by Hake et al in preschoolers42, and here, we show this disparity is evident as
early as 4 months of age.
Compared to non-Hispanic White women, Hispanic women reported longer latency and worse
sleep efficiency. Nonetheless, they reported less daytime dysfunction and better subjective sleep
quality. Previous studies on racial/ethnic disparities in sleep in the postpartum period are scarce.
A study by Christian et al. looked at the effect of race and parity on sleep quality and found no
effect of race postpartum.22 In that study, assessment occurred earlier than our study (4-12 weeks
postpartum) and Hispanic women were excluded. Another study estimated normative values for
postpartum sleep in a sample of majority White (93%) and married (91%) mothers from high SES
and indicated that sleep duration during the first 4 months postpartum was relatively stable at
approximately 7.2 h per night, and a sleep efficiency of 80% at 2 weeks postpartum increasing to
90% at 4 months.43 A similar study performed with a sample of African American and Hispanic
women from low SES backgrounds reported shorter duration of sleep (6.5 h per night) and lower
sleep efficiency of 74% at 6 weeks postpartum and 78% at 5 months.44 Thus, our results extend
knowledge from studies of the general population which indicate that racial/ethnic-minority adults
in the United States are at increased risk for poor sleep health, filling a gap in the literature
regarding racial disparities in sleep during the specific post-partum period.
Although both infants and mothers from racial/ethnic minorities experience poorer sleep across
multiple domains (duration, latency, efficiency, and disturbances), Hispanic mothers were less
likely to describe their own sleep as poor, to report daytime dysfunction and to describe their
infant’s sleep as a problem. This is in line with prior findings. A study performing a secondary
analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–201045 found that

although racial/ethnic minority women had poorer sleep health, they were less likely to report
trouble sleeping to a physician compared to White women. Similarly, a study assessing parent
perspectives of their infants’ sleep in a predominantly low SES African American sample found
that while children’s average sleep duration was below recommended for their age group and
overall sleep difficulty was high, most mothers reported that their children had normal sleep.46
The observed racial/ethnic differences in sleep are likely to be associated with several factors,
that may include individual, family, home, neighborhood, cultural, and societal factors, as
described by the social ecological model.1,18,47 In this study, we explored both SES and maternal
psychosocial functioning as potential factors contributing to maternal and infant racial/ethnic
disparities. SES has been suggested to contribute to children’s sleep due to quality of home
environments48, parental education and family stress49, or due to parents’ work schedules. Using
health insurance status as an indicator of SES, we found that low SES partially attenuated
maternal disparities in sleep but did not attenuate infant disparities in sleep. A study by Patrick et
al. also found that SES variables were not the primary mediators of the relationship between race
and sleep in an older cohort of preschoolers.50 Their findings indicated that parent behaviors
related to sleep, such as bedtime routine consistency, sleep associations, were the primary
mediators, although they might not be completely independent from SES.
We had hypothesized that maternal depression, stress, and symptoms of trauma related to the
COVID-19 pandemic would be higher in racial/ethnic minorities, thereby mediating disparities in
sleep. Similarly to prior findings,51 all domains of maternal mental health were associated with
maternal sleep domains, but not to infant sleep health. Contrary to our hypothesis, however,
neither depression, stress, or COVID-19-related stress were significantly different by
race/ethnicity and were not significant mediators of the sleep differences observed by
race/ethnicity, when comparing non-Hispanic White and Hispanic participants.
In this study we were able to investigate maternal and infant sleep health in the post-partum period
during the unique period of the COVID-19 pandemic. From our findings we conclude that maternal
COVID-19 status and timing of giving birth with respect to the pandemic did not significantly
influence infants’ sleep. Interestingly, however, timing of giving birth did influence maternal sleep,
but in an unexpected direction: mothers who delivered after the peak of the pandemic in New
York City (May to October) reported worse sleep than those that delivered at the peak of the
pandemic (March to April). Thus, the acute stress related to the pandemic itself might not carry
as high of a risk to sleep health as the “fatigue” experienced by this prolonged pandemic. Other
studies that have investigated sleep after natural disasters like 2005 Hurricane Katrina52 and 2011
Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami53 also found long lasting effects of posttraumatic stress
on sleep health. Importantly, findings from a study looking at a sample of women who were
impacted by Hurricane Ike, indicated that sleep quality affected changes in perceived stress over
time.54
Limitations of this study included the sparse information about additional behavioral and
socioecological factors, such as marital status and social support, that may also interact with
young children's sleep and the absence of objective sleep measures. Another limitation is the
small sample of AA mothers and infants in the cohort. Next steps for research in this topic area
will include objective sleep measures for mothers and infants (e.g. actigraphy) and increasing the
numbers of Black/African American mothers in the research sample.
In summary, our study shows racial/ethnic disparities in sleep in infants and mothers at 4 months
postpartum across several sleep domains, and these disparities persist after controlling for SES
and are not mediated by differences by race/ethnicity in maternal mental health. These results

highlight important information on the existing health inequities in our sample. Given the shortterm and long-term implications of poor sleep health for infant health and neurodevelopment and
for maternal physical and mental health, these results underscore the need to further investigate
root causes and mechanisms contributing to these inequities. This knowledge will be crucial to
know where to invest resources and how to develop strategies to improve sleep in the postpartum
period that account for the needs of populations experiencing health inequities.

Infants sleep analysis
Results from Model 2, in which we added insurance as a SES proxy in the model, showed that
the estimates associated with race/ethnicity on night (AA: β=-62.9±33.7, p=0.06, H: β=100.2±21.2, p<0.000, O: β=-64.2±23.4, p=0.007) and day sleep duration (H: β=45.0±19.9,
p=0.02), latency (AA: β=1.3±0.6, p=0.02, OR 3.8 CI 1.2-12.0), and bedtime (AA: β=1.5±0.6,
p<0.007, OR 4.7 CI 1.5-14.7, H:β=1.2±0.3, p<0.000, OR 3.2 CI 1.6-6.4, O: β=0.8±0.4, p=0.03
OR 2.2 CI 1.0-4.7) did not change appreciably. In addition, African American and Hispanic
infants had less nighttime awakenings (AA: β=-0.7±0.3, p=0.05, H: β=-0.4±0.2, p=0.05).
Maternal perception of infant’s sleep trends same direction but not significant anymore
(H:β=0.8±0.4, p=0.06, OR 2.2 CI 1-5.4). Insurance status was a significant predictor of bedtime,
with infants from the Medicare group going to bed later (β=0.9±0.3, p=0.003 OR 2.4 CI 1.3-4.3).
Results from Model 3, in which we added maternal COVID-19 status, showed that the estimates
associated with race/ethnicity on night (AA: β=-62.9±33.9, p=0.06, H: β=-100.9±21.7, p<0.000,

β=1.3±0.6, p=0.02, OR 3.9 CI 1.3-12.3), nighttime awakenings (AA: β=-0.7±0.3, p=0.05, H: β=0.4±0.2, p=0.05) and bedtime (AA: β=1.6±0.6, p<0.006, OR 4.9 CI 1.6-15.2, H:β=1.2±0.3,
p<0.000, OR 3.2 CI 1.6-6.4, O: β=0.8±0.4, p=0.04 OR 2.2 CI 1.0-4.6) did not change
appreciably. Maternal COVID-19 status was not a significant predictor of any domain of infant
sleep.
Results from Model 4, in which we added birth timing with respect to the pandemic, showed that
the estimates associated with race/ethnicity on night (AA: β=-62.9±34.1, p=0.06, H: β=97.1±21.5, p<0.000, O: β=-65.6±23.6, p=0.006) and day sleep duration (H: β=47.3±20.1,
p=0.02), latency (AA: β=1.2±0.6, p=0.04, OR 3.2 CI 1.0-10.3), nighttime awakenings (AA: β=0.7±0.3, p=0.05, H: β=-0.4±0.2, p=0.04) and bedtime (AA: β=1.6±0.6, p<0.008, OR 4.6 CI 1.514.5, H:β=1.2±0.3, p<0.000, OR 3.3 CI 1.6-6.5, O: β=0.7±0.4, p=0.05 OR 2.1 CI 1.0-4.5) did not
change appreciably. Birth timing was associated only with sleep latency, with infants born in
July-Aug having longer latency (β=1.3±0.6 p=0.04 OR=3.6 CI=1.0-12.9) and mothers of infants

born in September-October being more likely to report infant sleep as a problem (β=-1.6±0.8
p=0.04 OR=0.2 CI=0.04-1.0).
Maternal sleep analysis
Results from Model 2, in which we added insurance as an SES proxy, showed analogous
differences by race for latency (H: β=1.2±0.4, p=0.004 OR 3.4 CI 1.5-8.1), and daytime
dysfunction (AA: β=-2.1±1.1, p=0.05 OR 0.11 CI 0.006-0.7, H: β=-1.0±0.5, p=0.03 OR 0.4 CI
0.1-0.9), while for other domains differences by race were not significant anymore.
Results from Model 3, in which we added COVID-19 status, confirmed observed differences by
race/ethnicity in latency (H: β=1.2±0.4, p=0.005 OR 3.1 CI 0.8-11.6), and daytime dysfunction
(AA: β=-2.1±1.1, p=0.05 OR 0.11 CI 0.006-0.7, H: β=-1.0±0.5, p=0.03 OR 0.4 CI 0.1-0.9).
COVID-19 status did not have any significant effects on maternal sleep measures.
Results from Model 4, in which we added birth timing with respect to the pandemic, confirmed
observed differences by race/ethnicity in latency (H: β=1.2±0.4, p=0.005 OR 2.8 CI 0.7-10.6),
and daytime dysfunction (H: β=-1.1±0.5, p=0.03 OR 0.3 CI 0.1-0.9). In addition, birth timing was
associated with several sleep domains. Compared to the group who delivered in March-April
(the height of the pandemic in New York City), the group who delivered in May-June had worse
subjective sleep quality (β=1.2±0.5, p=0.02 OR 3.4 CI 1.2-10.1), longer sleep latency
(β=1.3±0.6, p=0.02 OR 3.7 CI 1.3-11.5), more sleep disturbances (β=1.5±0.6, p=0.01 OR 4.4
CI 1.4-14.5) and worse overall sleep (β=1.0±0.5, p=0.04 OR 2.7 CI 1.0-7.3). Compared to the
group who delivered in March-April, the group who delivered in July-August had longer sleep
latency (β=1.3±0.5, p=0.01 OR 3.7 CI 1.3-10.9), more sleep disturbances (β=1.4±0.6, p=0.01
OR 3.8 CI 1.3-11.6) and worse overall sleep (β=0.9±0.5, p=0.05 OR 2.6 CI 1.0-6.5).
