ABSTRACT

22

Sensitive, accessible, and biosafe sampling methods for COVID-19 reverse-transcriptase

23

polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are needed for frequent and widespread testing. We

24

systematically evaluated diagnostic yield across different sample collection and transport

25

workflows, including the incorporation of a viral inactivation buffer. We prospectively collected

26

nasal swabs, oral swabs, and saliva, from 52 COVID-19 RT-PCR-confirmed patients, and

27

nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 37 patients. Nasal and oral swabs were placed in both viral

28

transport media (VTM) and eNAT™, a sterilizing transport buffer, prior to testing with the Xpert

29

Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Xpert) test. The sensitivity of each sampling strategy was compared using

30

a composite positive standard. Overall, swab specimens collected in eNAT showed superior

31

sensitivity compared to swabs in VTM (70% vs 57%, P=0.0022). Direct saliva 90.5%, (95% CI:

32

82%, 95%), followed by NP swabs in VTM and saliva in eNAT, was significantly more sensitive

33

than nasal swabs in VTM (50%, P<0.001) or eNAT (67.8%, P=0.0012) and oral swabs in VTM

34

(50%, P<0.0001) or eNAT (56%, P<0.0001). Saliva and use of eNAT buffer each increased

35

detection of SARS-CoV-2 with the Xpert test; however, no single sample matrix identified all

36

positive cases.

INTRODUCTION

41

Accurate, efficient, and biosafe detection of SARS-CoV-2 in both symptomatic and asymptomatic

42

individuals with active COVID-19 infection is an essential public health strategy for preventing

43

transmission and controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Although nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs are

44

a preferred specimen type, the invasiveness of this procedure, potential for variable collection

45

quality, need for supervised collection with biohazard risks have hindered the scalability of this

46

testing method 1-4. Rather, there has been progress in establishing utility of non-invasive sampling

47

methods that use saliva 5-7 or self-collected nasal or oral swabs 8, 9 which can enable broader testing

48

of at-risk populations and decrease exposure risk to healthcare workers 10. When combined with

49

self-testing, wider implementation of rapid, CLIA-waived COVID-19 assays11,12 could

50

dramatically increase public access to tests for SARS-COV-2 infection by expanding testing in at-

51

risk locations including school and the workplace. However, the feasibility of scaling these non-

52

invasive samples for widespread testing outside of carefully controlled environments remains

53

limited by the operational and biosafety challenges.

54

Our group has recently demonstrated that a guanidine-thiocyanate transport buffer (eNAT™,

55

Copan diagnostics Murrieta, CA) leads to viral inactivation, with at least 5-log reduction in viable

56

SARS-COV-2, and stabilization of viral RNA in a sample13. With the premise that eNAT could

57

optimize testing yield while simplifying sample transport and handling, we evaluated and

58

compared the yield of eNAT versus standard transport media, across different non-invasive

59

samples, using the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-COV-2 test (‘Xpert’). Xpert is a FDA- EUA

60

approved rapid, integrated, cartridge-based RT-PCR test that can be run on widely existing

61

GeneXpert instruments used in over 130 countries. To our knowledge, this is the first study to

62

demonstrate the use of a viral inactivating buffer across various non-invasive samples in a point-

MATERIALS AND METHODS

67

Study population and sample collection. To collect SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from

68

COVID-19 PCR confirmed participants, we conducted a sub-study to an observational cohort

69

study of COVID-19 patients at University Hospital (UH) affiliated with the Rutgers New Jersey

70

Medical School in Newark, NJ, USA. This study was approved by the Rutgers Institutional Review

71

Board for human subject research (Rutgers IRB # Pro2020001138). Eligible patients included

72

adults (age ≥ 18) who tested SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive by the in-hospital NP swab PCR tests

73

(most commonly Simplexa COVID-19 Direct EUA (Diasorin Molecular LLC, Cypress, CA)).

74

Patients that could not or did not consent, were pregnant or breastfeeding, prisoners, or who were

75

unable to provide any respiratory specimens were excluded. Trained study personnel collected 1

76

NP swab (baseline only), 2 oral swabs, 2 nasal swabs, and a saliva sample from all participants

77

who consented to all sample types. A subset of participants being evaluated for hospital outcomes

78

in the parent study continued to be sampled longitudinally by oral swabs, nasal swabs, and saliva

79

every 2-3 days until discharge. All swab types were immediately placed into 3mL of sterile

80

Universal Viral Transport Medium (VTM; Labscoop, Little Rock, AR) whereas a second nasal

81

and oral swab was collected and immediately placed into 3mL of eNAT (COPAN Diagnostics,

82

Murrieta, CA, USA). A thinner nylon tip swab designed for nasopharyngeal (NP) sampling was

83

used to obtain the NP swab (baseline only), and a thicker nylon tip swab designed for oral and

84

nasal samples (Copan diagnostic, Murrieta, CA) was used for these sample types. NP swab

85

collection was performed in accordance with CDC guidelines

14

; oral swab collection was

86

performed by swabbing both buccal surfaces and tongue with an alternating order of collection for

87

each media; nasal (anterior nares) swab collection was performed by rotating the swab 1 cm inside

88

the nostril for 10-15 seconds, alternating nostrils for each media. Additionally, participants were

89

instructed to self-collect a posterior saliva sample by clearing the back of their throat, then

90

collecting 4 mL of saliva into a marked, empty, sterile wide-mouth cup (though any volume over

91

0.5 mL was accepted). All specimens were transported at room temperature and stored in a 2-4°C

92

prior to testing, which occurred within 48 hours of sample collection.

93

Testing by Xpert Xpress SARS-Cov-2 (‘Xpert’). NP, nasal, and oral swabs were tested by

94

adding 300µl of the sample (either in VTM or eNAT) directly to the Xpert SARS-Cov-2 test

95

cartridges and the test was run in the GeneXpert system as per the manufacturer’s instructions.

96

The saliva sample was tested using three different methods. First, 300µl of the saliva sample was

97

directly added into the Xpert test cartridge (“saliva direct” sample). Additionally, the same saliva

98

sample was swabbed with two separate swabs (thicker nylon tip swabs) for 10 twirls followed by

99

incubating each swab in the saliva for ~10-20 seconds (“saliva swab” sample). Each saliva swab

100

sample was then transferred into test tubes containing 3mls of either VTM or 2 ml of eNAT buffer

101

and mixed well. From each of these mixtures, 300µl were added directly to the sample chamber

102

of Xpert cartridges. Saliva samples <300 µl were tested only by swabbing in eNAT and VTM.

103

We also compared saliva samples directly diluted in 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4 ratios of saliva to eNAT. A

104

minimum volume of 700µl of saliva was needed to test all saliva processing methods: ‘saliva

105

direct’, saliva swab in eNAT and all three dilutions. For saliva samples with volumes less than

106

700µl, we prioritized saliva direct and saliva swab testing. Out of the 44-saliva direct positive

107

samples tested with eNAT ratios, 1:1 dilution was not performed for one saliva sample due to

108

insufficient volume. One each of the sample types had an error either due to pressure aborts (Error

110

repeat tested. The saliva:eNAT mixtures were then tested using the GeneXpert system by adding

111

300µl of the mixture to the Xpert SARS-CoV-2 test cartridge. The effect on the assay inhibition,

112

N2 gene cycle threshold (Ct), percent positive rate and cartridge pressure values were evaluated.

113

Definitions. We compared samples that were collected contemporaneously (sample comparison

114

set) and applied a composite SARS-CoV-2 positive reference standard, defined as at least one

115

sample type being positive in the sample comparison set. We did not compare sample sets in which

116

no samples were positive, as we reasoned that the PCR-negative samples from these individuals

117

could not be considered false negative due to biologic variability in sampling over time, but they

118

were also not suitable as true negative comparators due to known COVID status of these

119

individuals. To confirm the discordancy that negative comparison sets was not due to difference

120

in the in-hospital versus Xpert PCR tests, we obtained leftover media from positive NP swabs of

121

a random subset of six participants. We then tested this archived sample as validation samples on

122

Xpert. Xpert correctly detected SARS-CoV-2 in all six of these archived samples.

123

Statistical analyses. Standard statistical analyses (average, standard deviation, and t-test) and

124

proportion of positive tests by each sampling method were compared by Chi-square, t-test or z-

125

test as appropriate, using Microsoft Excel 365 for Windows, GraphPad Prism version 8 or online

126

software (http://vassarstats.net/propdiff_ind.html). Scatter plots for Ct values showing the mean

127

and SD were included for the positive samples.

Participant enrollment and characteristics. Between June 12th, 2020 and October 23rd, 2020,

131

70 subjects were enrolled into the study (Figure 1). From these 70 enrollees, a total of 116 sample

132

comparison sets were collected - 70 at baseline and 46 at follow-up time-points. Of note, some

133

participants consented to all sample types except for NP swabs. Of the 116 comparison sets, 84

134

sample sets from 52 participants were complete with all specimen types and had at least one sample

135

positive (by the composite reference standard) and were thus included in the sample comparison

136

analysis (Fig. 1). Characteristics of the 52 participants in the analysis population (participants with

137

at least one study sample positive for SARS-CoV-2) are shown in Table 1 and characteristics of

138

the 13 participants with all negative samples are shown in Supplementary Table S1. Among the

139

52 participants in the analysis population, 41 (79%) had symptoms potentially consistent with

140

COVID whereas 11 (21%) of these participants presented to the hospital for non-COVID

141

indications, had no respiratory symptoms, and were incidentally found to be COVID-positive.

142

Average participant age was 55, 37% were female, and the most common comorbidities were

143

hypertension and diabetes.

144

On average, the baseline collection took place 2 days after the last positive in-hospital NP swab

145

PCR test for participants in the analysis group, and 3 days for participants with no positive samples.

146

The biologic variability of PCR positivity from samples collected several days apart was evident

147

in the discordancy of longitudinal in-hospital NP swab PCR testing results even when the same

148

test was used. Nineteen (38%) of the 52 participants in the analysis group had at least one

149

subsequent negative in-hospital NP swab PCR test during their hospital admission (Table 1).

150

Additionally, we validated 100% agreement of the in-house test with Xpert (all the original

151

samples were Xpert positive) from the original left-over positive NP swab specimen of 6

152

participants. These observations support that positive-negative discordancy across time was likely

153

biologic or sampling variability and unlikely due to discordancy between the in-hospital and

154

Cepheid tests, and is consistent with previous comparative performance of Xpert Xpress SARS-

155

CoV-2 with other SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR platforms

156

Comparative testing of different respiratory specimens in Xpert Xpress SARS-COV-2. A

157

total of 84 sample comparison sets from 52 patients were included in the sample comparison

158

analysis based on the composite reference, where at least one specimen in the comparison set was

159

positive. Seventeen of these patients had follow-up samples collected on alternative days during

160

their hospital stay. Thus, a total of 84 sets of all specimen types were included in the analysis

161

except for NP swabs, which were only collected from 51 completed baseline collections. Of the

162

51 completed baseline collections, 14 participants declined NP swab, leaving a total of 37 sample

163

sets that could be analyzed with NP swab.

164

As shown in Fig. 2A, undiluted saliva added directly to the cartridge (‘direct saliva’) gave the

165

highest detection rate at 90.5% (76/84), followed by NP-VTM (86.5%, 32/37) and saliva in eNAT

166

buffer (84.5%; 71/84), which were significantly higher compared to nasal or oral swabs

167

(P<0.0001). Saliva in VTM (71.4%; 60/84) also performed better than oral swabs in VTM (50%;

168

42/84) or eNAT (58%; 49/84), as well as nasal swabs in VTM (50%; 42/84) or eNAT (67.8%;

169

57/84). We further analyzed N2-gene cycle threshold (Ct) values for all positive samples as shown

170

in Fig. 2B. Average N2 gene Ct values were the earliest for NP-VTM (32±5.4) and saliva direct

171

(Ct=34.2±5.8) and most delayed for oral-VTM (37.5±4.9). The Ct range difference was

172

statistically significant between saliva direct and oral-VTM (P<0.0001), oral-eNAT (P=0.0003)

173

and saliva-VTM (P=0.0026). However, there was no significant difference of N2-Ct range for NP-

174

VTM (P=0.28), nasal-VTM (P=0.09), nasal-eNAT (P=0.82) and saliva-eNAT (P=0.26) compared

175

to saliva direct (Fig. 2B). There were three negative NP specimens that were detected in saliva,

176

which we observed to have N2 Ct values of 39.4, 40.3 and 36.1 (Supplementary Fig. 1C),

177

indicating below LOD level viral loads

178

the sample sets was positive by NP swab (Ct=35.4) but negative in saliva direct and both saliva

179

swabs (VTM and eNAT). Overall, we found that saliva performed better or equal to NP swabs in

180

detecting COVID positive patients. Similarly, the samples that were negative by other respiratory

181

specimens (nasal or oral swab) but detected by saliva swab in VTM or eNAT had an overall

182

delayed N2-Ct values of >37, indicating better performance in saliva for samples with low viral

183

load (sub-LoD) or lesser variation in saliva collection.

184

Influence of transport media on detection across all sample types. We also evaluated if the

185

composition of different transport media, specifically VTM and eNAT, had any influence on the

186

detection sensitivity. As described, nasal and oral swabs were collected in both VTM and eNAT

187

whereas saliva was collected from patients in an empty sterile cup, then subsequently swabbed and

188

stored in VTM and eNAT. As shown before in Fig. 2A, compared to VTM, eNAT increased the

189

positivity rate by about 20% (40/84 vs 57/84) for nasal swabs (P=0.008), followed by 12% for

190

saliva (60/84 vs 70/84, P=0.065) and 6% for oral swabs (42/84 vs 47/84, P=0.43). When data from

191

all sample types were combined to compare the two media, eNAT offered over 12% advantage

192

(142 vs 174 out of 252 samples) in overall detection rate compared to VTM (P=0.003).

193

Optimizing the use of eNAT buffer for saliva. Compared to saliva swabbed into eNAT, direct

194

saliva yielded an overall delayed SPC-Ct values in the Xpert test, indicating possible PCR

195

inhibition and increased (>60 PSI) in-cartridge pressure values (Supplementary Fig. 2B). Saliva

196

diluted into eNAT at a ratio of 1:2 (N=43) yielded the second highest PCR positive rate (97.7%,

197

42/43) after saliva direct (100%, 43/43) (Fig. 3). Dilutions of 1:1 and 1:4 yielded 95% (40/42) and

198

93% (40/43) positive rate, respectively. Saliva swabs in eNAT showed the lowest sensitivity at

17

possibly contributing to the discrepancy. Only one of

199

86% (37/43, P>0.05; Fig. 3A). A sample missed by 1:2 &1:4 dilutions and another by 1:1 & 1:4

200

dilutions, had delayed N2-Ct values of 44.3 and 41.7 with saliva direct, respectively, indicating the

201

influence of Poisson distribution for viral loads considerably below the limit of detection. Whereas

202

the average N2-Ct values were similar (ca. 33-34) for all saliva conditions tested (P>0.05), the

203

SPC-Ct values were earlier with saliva in eNAT compared to saliva direct (31.25±1.74, P<0.001,

204

Supplementary Fig. 2C), suggesting that PCR inhibition was mitigated by the addition of eNAT

205

to an appreciable extent.

206

Operational characteristics of processing saliva in GeneXpert cartridges: To evaluate saliva

207

processing profiles in the GeneXpert cartridges, we analyzed the sample processing control (SPC)

208

Ct values and in-cartridge pressure values. All respiratory samples collected in either VTM or

209

eNAT did not have any significant difference either with SPC Ct or the max pressure values

210

(Supplementary Fig. 2A and 2B). Saliva direct, the only sample type analyzed as is without

211

dilution, yielded slightly delayed SPC Ct and higher cartridge pressure values with an average of

212

58±13.48, with one sample aborting the run due to pressure exceeding 100 psi (vs NP-VTM,

213

P<0.0001). However, when the saliva was swabbed and transferred to VTM or eNAT, average

214

pressure values fell to 53.2±6.06 (P<0.0001) and 52.2±5.4 (P<0.0001), respectively. Dilution with

215

eNAT at 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4 ratio reduced the inhibition from saliva direct (P<0.0001) by lowering

216

the average SPC-Ct values by ~2 ct values (Ct 29.1 in 1:2 vs 31.2 in saliva direct). There was no

217

significant difference in maximum in-cartridge pressure values with saliva dilution in eNAT

218

(P>0.05), except for swab in eNAT (P=0.02). These results suggest that particles or mucus present

219

in direct saliva samples can occasionally interfere with assay function, and that swab testing may

220

be considered when these situations occur.

DISCUSSION

223

We found that saliva is an excellent test matrix for the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test, providing

224

a sensitivity that is comparable to NP swabs and better than nasal and oral swabs. This finding is

225

consistent with previously published studies using other RT-qPCR modalities

226

handful of previous studies have looked at saliva tested in the Xpert SARS-CoV-2 11, 24, 25, to our

227

knowledge this study is the first study to comprehensively test multiple non-invasive sampling

228

methods, in the setting of both symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 infection, with and

229

without the use of a sterilizing sample/transport buffer. By applying a composite reference

230

standard for a positive sample, we observed that saliva enhanced the detection of SARS-CoV-2

231

compared all other sampling types. This finding may be largely attributable to more reliable SARS-

232

CoV-2 yield with saliva sampling as opposed to higher variability of swab sampling, consistent

233

with similar observations from other studies 1, 5-7. It is worth noting that noB sample matrix was

234

100% sensitive compared to the composite reference standard. Discordancy between sample

235

matrices was most pronounced in samples that had a delayed cycle threshold indicating low viral

236

load. This suggests that testing with multiple samples and perhaps multiple sample types when

237

clinical suspicion is high may provide the highest sensitivity and negative predictive value for

238

SARS-CoV-2.

239

We additionally found that eNAT, a buffer we have previously determined to be effective at

240

inactivating SARS-CoV-2 in-vitro (Banik et al., submitted), increased the test positivity rates

241

across all sample types compared to VTM (P=0.0032), with a saliva to eNAT ratio of 1:2 being

242

optimal in our sample set. We also found that adding eNAT to saliva possibly mitigates the PCR

243

interference from saliva with lower pressure values and recovery of otherwise delayed SPC Ct

244

values seen with direct saliva. These findings suggest that the application of eNAT as a sample

18-23

buffer may be advantageous not only in safe handling and transport, but also in improving yield

246

and processing capability on the Cepheid system.

There were several limitations in this study. First, there were less contemporaneous NP swabs

248

collected with saliva, thereby reducing the number of direct comparisons between these two

249

sample types, although they were found to be comparable. An underlying reason for this –

250

participants declining NP swab collection due to its discomfort – also demonstrates the real-world

251

limitations that would be magnified with larger scale testing such as in schools or the workplace.

252

Secondly, we added eNAT to saliva in the laboratory, whereas the benefit of eNAT would be to

253

sterilize samples immediately after collection and before transport and test set up. However, this

254

allowed us to evaluate the combination of eNAT and saliva under different conditions and inform

255

optimal design of kits to add eNAT immediately to saliva upon collection. Finally, our participants

256

were patients who had either been admitted to the hospital or seen in the emergency department.

257

This population may not be generalizable to ambulatory individuals who would benefit the most

258

from self-collection. However, we captured a diverse patient group in our cohort including those

259

who were never admitted, as well as patients who were detected by universal screening but

260

reported no COVID symptoms.

261

Altogether, our findings support the use of saliva and eNAT sterilizing buffer to enhance effective,

262

safe, and accessible COVID testing and screening in the many health care systems worldwide

263

already using GeneXpert instruments.
