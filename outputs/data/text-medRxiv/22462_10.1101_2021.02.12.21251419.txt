KEY MESSAGES
1. What is already known about this subject?
• Work-related contact dermatitis is a prominent issue among healthcare workers, and likely
exacerbated by the enhanced hand hygiene and personal protective equipment required to control
infection during the COVID19 pandemic.
• The antimicrobial lotion Dermol 500 is frequently prescribed as an emollient and soap substitute to
help prevent and treat dermatitis, but its use during the COVID19 pandemic was not advised as its
capacity to inactivate viruses was unknown.
2. What are the new findings?
• Increased incidence of irritant contact dermatitis was recorded amongst healthcare workers at King’s
College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in 2020 compared to 2019.
• Dermol 500 lotion and its antimicrobial components, benzalkonium chloride (BAK) and chlorhexidine
dihydrochloride (CD), exhibit virucidal activity against influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2, the virus
responsible for COVID19 pandemic.
3. How might this impact policy or clinical practice in the foreseeable future?
• Our results demonstrate that Dermol 500 can be safely used as a soap substitute to treat work-related
contact dermatitis in clinical care settings during the COVID19 pandemic.
• Employers can meet their obligations under COSHH to eliminate workplace exposure to a harmful
substance and substitute with an alternative product for hand hygiene.
ABSTRACT
Objectives: To investigate whether the antimicrobial emollient Dermol 500 and its active components,
benzalkonium chloride (BAK) and chlorhexidine dihydrochloride (CD), exhibit virucidal activity thus informing
whether Dermol 500 is a suitable soap substitute for use during the COVID19 pandemic, to combat the
increased incidence of work-related contact dermatitis in clinical settings that we report here.
Methods: Inactivation of influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 by Dermol 500 and the independent and
combined virucidal activity of the Dermol 500 components BAK and CD was assessed by influenza A virus and
SARS-CoV-2 infectivity assays. Viruses were treated with concentrations of BAK and CD comparable to
Dermol 500, and lower, and infectivity of the viruses assessed by titration.
Results: Dermol 500 exhibits comparable virucidal activity to alcohol-based sanitisers against influenza A
virus and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the Dermol 500 components BAK and CD exhibit independent and
synergistic virucidal activity against influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID19.
NOTE: This preprint reports new research that has not been certified by peer review and should not be used to guide clinical practice.

Conclusions: The synergistic virucidal activity of the Dermol 500 components BAK and CD makes Dermol 500
suitable as a soap substitute to treat and prevent work-related contact dermatitis in healthcare settings.

INTRODUCTION
Hand hygiene is imperative in healthcare settings and hand washing with soap or use of alcohol-based hand
sanitisers are advised worldwide to assist infection control1. However, such hand hygiene measures and use
of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves and masks can precipitate irritant contact dermatitis2.
This skin condition is characterised by damage to the stratum corneum layer of the epidermis, resulting in
cracked, dry and itchy skin with impaired barrier function, and advances to severe irritation and
inflammation3. Following the development of dermatitis there is an elevated risk of bacterial colonisation
and subsequent transmission to other healthcare workers or patients.
Work-related contact dermatitis in healthcare professionals has been exacerbated by the infection control
measures required during the COVID19 pandemic. 84.6% of surveyed Wuhan healthcare workers reported
adverse skin reactions attributed to increased hand washing frequency4. Since March 2020, we have
observed a sharp increase in NHS staff presenting with irritant hand dermatitis (Figure 1)5. Between 26th
March – 6th May, 468 staff within King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust presenting to a staff
dermatology clinic were diagnosed with irritant hand dermatitis. For comparison, only 8 staff had this
diagnosis recorded over the same time period in 2019 at the occupational health department of the hospital.
A 9.5 fold increase in irritant contact dermatitis diagnoses has been observed overall in 2020 compared to
2019 (Figure 1C), with significant increases in both occupational health walk-in cases and those diagnosed
following management referral (Figures 1A and B).
Although dermatitis is a prominent issue for healthcare workers, it is manageable with appropriate
interventions3. Under UK health and safety law, legislation details that employers have a duty of care and
statutory legal obligation to employees to minimise and avoid health problems caused by work, including
development of skin conditions such as work-related dermatitis6. ‘The Control of Substances Hazardous to
Health Regulations, (COSHH) 2002, (as amended)’ requires employers to identify substances that may be
hazardous to health, assess risks and implement adequate control measures to control exposure and protect
health7. Indeed, if the contact dermatitis is considered solely caused by work, it is reportable under the
‘Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) 2013’8 9. Prior to the
COVID19 pandemic, the use of soap substitutes and emollients was advised to treat work-related contact
dermatitis in healthcare workers by the Royal College of Physicians and other medical bodies2, meeting the
COSHH requirement to eliminate exposure to the hazardous substance and substitute with an alternative.
Notably, Dermol 500 lotion is usually prescribed as an antimicrobial emollient and soap substitute to aid skin
conditions such as dermatitis10. However, due to a lack of evidence regarding whether Dermol 500 can
inactivate virus particles, its use in clinical settings was discouraged during the COVID19 pandemic11.

Dermol 500 contains the antimicrobial components benzalkonium chloride (BAK) and chlorhexidine
dihydrochloride (CD)10, which both have broad and well established antimicrobial activity12 13. This includes
activity against the bacterial genuses Chlamydia14, Pseudomonas15, Streptococcus16 and Staphlococcus 17,
amongst others. BAK has been independently shown to exhibit virucidal activity against various enveloped
viruses, including Canine coronavirus (CCV)18, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1)19, human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV)19 cytomegalovirus (CMV)14 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)14. In addition, surface disinfectants
where BAK is the principle active component have been shown to inactivate the SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus20.
Virucidal activity has been demonstrated for the parental compound of CD (chlorhexidine), with alternative
chlorhexidine salt form derivatives chlorhexidine gluconate and chlorhexidine acetate inactivating HIV and
HSV-119 21.
Synergistic or cumulative virucidal activity of BAK and CD within the context and concentration found in
Dermol 500 lotion has not previously been reported. The purpose of this study was to assess the virucidal
activity of Dermol 500 and its antimicrobial components BAK and CD against influenza A virus (IAV) and SARSCoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), the virus responsible for COVID19 disease.

METHODS
Cell culture
Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells and VeroE6 cells were routinely cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Gibco-Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FCS, 1%
penicillin/streptomycin and either Glutamax (MDCK) or NEAA (Vero E6)(Gibco-Life Technologies).
Influenza infectivity assay
The influenza A virus used in this study was strain A/PR8/8/34 (H1N1), henceforth referred to as IAV. The
virus was propagated in confluent MDCK flasks in the presence of TPCK-treated trypsin at 1 µg/ml
(Worthingtons Bioscience) and serum-free DMEM containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% Glutamax
(Gibco Life-Technologies)(SFM). MDCK cells were seeded in 6 well plates 24 to 72h prior to influenza
infectivity assays.
Due to their viscosity, Dermol 500 lotion and commercially available alcohol-based sanitisers were diluted
1:1 to 50% concentration in SFM to allow for accurate pipetting. Virus was incubated with Dermol
500/alcohol-based sanitisers at the final concentrations described, or with SFM alone as a control. The
alcohol-based hand sanitisers assessed were: 1) Cuticura Original Hand Sanitiser, 2) Lifebuoy Hand Hygiene
Sanitiser 3) Hygiene Vision Europe Ltd Hand Hygiene Sanitiser. Alternatively, virus was incubated with BAK
and CD at the concentrations described (Sigma Aldrich; CD suspended in DMSO), culture medium alone or
DMSO vehicle control (Supplementary Figure 1).
Virus was incubated with the treatment for the stated times at either room temperature (RT) or 32°C
(average skin temperature). Following incubation, SFM was added to the virus/treatment samples to a 10-1
dilution then subject to 10-fold serial dilutions. The limit of detection was therefore 101 virus particles/mL.
Due to adverse effects of BAK and CD on cultured in vitro cell lines the limit of detection for BAK and CD
treatments between 0.05 - 0.1% was 102 virus particles/mL without filtration. Where noted, IAV was filtered
to remove BAK/CD post-incubation using 15 mLlAmicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter with a 50,000 molecular
weight cut off (UFC905008, Merck) and centrifugation (4000 x g, 10 min). Filtered virus was resuspended in
SFM and serially diluted as above.
Infectious virus was titred via standard plaque assay. Briefly, confluent MDCK cells were incubated with 1ml
of virus dilutions for 1 hour at 37°C. Virus dilutions were aspirated and cells overlaid with 3ml SFM containing
0.8% AvicelÒ (FMC BioPolymer), 0.14% BSA and TPCK-treated trypsin at 1 µg/ml (Worthingtons Bioscience).
After 3 days, infected cells were fixed in PBS with 8-10% formalin, stained with 0.1% toulidine blue and viral
plaque forming units (PFU) assessed.
SARS-CoV-2 TCID50 infectivity assay
The SARS-CoV-2 strain used in this study was SARS-CoV-2/England/IC19 and is henceforth referred to as
‘SARS-CoV-2’22. Vero E6 cells were seeded into 96-well plates in supplemented DMEM for confluence the
next day. SARS-CoV-2 was incubated with either Dermol 500 or alcohol-based sanitiser diluted as for IAV
above. Alternatively, BAK and CD diluted to 0.2% in assay diluent (DMEM, 0.3% BSA, 1X NEAA, 1X
penicillin/streptomycin) were mixed with an equal volume of SARS-CoV-2 to a final concentration of 0.1%
BAK and 0.1% CD. Virus was also mixed with assay diluent in the absence of Dermol 500, alcohol-based
sanitisers or CD/BAK. After stated incubation period, neat sample was added to the first column of confluent
Vero E6 cells and Log10/half-Log10 dilution series immediately performed across the plate in assay diluent.
Four technical replicates were performed for each sample. Plates were incubated for 5 days at 37°C before
adding crystal violet stain (0.1% w/v) to live cells. Wells were scored for either an intact, stained cell sheet or
the absence of cells due to virus-induced cytopathic effect. For each condition, the Spearman-Karber method
was used to calculate the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of the virus.
Statistical analysis
All data was analysed using GraphPad Prism and presented as mean ± standard deviation (mean±SD). For
each treatment condition, at least 2 independent biological replicates were performed.

RESULTS
Dermol 500 exhibits virucidal activity against IAV and SARS-CoV-2 comparable to alcohol-based hand
sanitisers.
To assess whether Dermol 500 emollient exhibits virucidal activity, we examined the capacity of IAV and
SARS-CoV-2 to infect cells following incubation with Dermol 500 (Figure 2). Dermol 500 lotion was diluted in
cell culture medium to allow for accurate pipetting, therefore could only be assessed at maximum 25% of its
original concentration. Even at this dilution, we observed a significant reduction in the amount of infectious
IAV after 30min incubation at skin temperature 32oC (~100-fold reduction in virus particles; Figure 2A), and
a similar decrease in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity after only 5min (Figure 2B). In parallel, we assessed the virucidal
activity of 3 commercially available alcohol-based hand sanitisers diluted equivalently. Importantly, Dermol
500 performed as well or better than these alcohol-based sanitisers at decreasing viral infectivity. The
virucidal effect of Dermol 500 was concentration-dependent, performing less well at a 12.5% dilution
(Supplementary Figure 2), indicating increased efficacy against viruses when Dermol 500 is used at its
intended concentration. In addition, increased incubation time correlated with enhanced reduction in
infectious virus.

The antimicrobial agents benzalkonium chloride (BAK) and chlorhexidine dihydrochloride (CD) rapidly
inactivate IAV and SARS-CoV-2 at the concentrations found in Dermol 500 lotion.
BAK and CD are considered the active antimicrobial agents in Dermol 50010, and alone have been reported
to exhibit some virucidal activity14 18-21. We tested their ability to inactivate IAV and SARS-CoV-2 in
combination, to determine whether they contribute to the virucidal activity of Dermol 500 lotion at their
intended concentration (Figure 3). Within 30 seconds of incubation with 0.1% BAK/0.1% CD the level of
infectious IAV decreased 100,000-fold, and by 3 minutes infectious virus had reached undetectable levels
(Figure 3A). For SARS-CoV-2, no virus-induced cytopathic effect was observed for samples incubated with
0.1% BAK/0.1% CD across all incubation time frames (102 TCID50/mL detection limit) indicating a >10,000fold reduction in virus infectivity within 0.5min of contact with BAK/CD, below the limit of detection. We
conclude that BAK and CD together are extremely potent virucidal agents against influenza and coronaviruses
at the concentrations found in Dermol 500 lotion.

The antimicrobial agents BAK and CD independently inactivate IAV with different efficiencies, and act
synergistically to disrupt viral infectivity.
We next investigated the virucidal activity of decreasing concentrations of BAK and CD, both in combination
and independently to further characterise their efficacy (Figure 4). Within a 30 second time frame, we
observed a significant decrease in IAV infectivity with the lowest concentration of BAK tested (0.0125%),
indicating that amounts could be reduced in future virucidal formulations. CD alone showed no significant
decrease in infectious virus over this time frame, but showed synergistic interaction with BAK by enhancing
its efficacy against IAV in a time- and temperature-dependent manner (Figure 4; Supplementary Figures 3
and 4). At skin temperature, CD starts to exert an independent virucidal effect at higher concentrations by 5
minutes, and by 30 minutes the lowest CD concentration has reduced IAV infectivity by 100-1000 fold.
0.0125% BAK/0.1% CD was the most efficient combination we tested, with IAV infectivity below detectable
levels within 30 seconds (Supplementary Figure 4).

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Any employment that requires hand hygiene, exposure to irritants and PPE such as masks and gloves poses
a risk of work-related skin disease, with irritant contact dermatitis the most common occupational
inflammatory skin disease in Europe23. With the prominent worldwide focus on hand hygiene and PPE during
the COVID19 pandemic, increased occurrence of work-related contact dermatitis will likely extend beyond
clinical settings into commercial employment industries, particularly other key workers. Occupational
dermatitis is a reportable disease under UK health and safety leglislation6 8, and employers are legally obliged
to minimise exposure to harmful substances and avoid health problems including skin conditions. The
provision of emollients and soap substitutes, such as Dermol 500 lotion, are advised for treatment and
prevention of dermatitis3, but not recommended currently due to a lack of evidence regarding their virucidal
efficacy11. This study clearly demonstrates Dermol 500, and its antimicrobial components BAK and CD, exhibit
robust virucidal activity against IAV and SARS-CoV-2, enabling its use against work-related contact dermatitis
during the COVID19 pandemic.
Synonymous with the cumulative activity of BAK and CD against bacteria15, these compounds act
synergistically to inactivate two different enveloped viruses, IAV and SARS-CoV-2. Extrapolating these results,
we predict that Dermol 500 will be effective against other enveloped viruses, especially as both BAK and CD
have been shown to independently inactivate the enveloped viruses HSV-1 and HIV19 21. Indeed, BAK has been
shown to inactivate a broad range of enveloped viruses including CCV18, CMV14, RSV14 and SARS-CoV-120.
Interestingly, 0.1% BAK is a component of many commercial nasal sprays, although listed as a preservative
rather than an active ingredient24.
The mechanisms underpinning BAK and CD viral inactivation are poorly understood, and beyond the scope
of this paper, but both have been commonly used antimicrobials since the 1950’s. They are known to disrupt
the physical integrity and biochemical functions of the lipid membranes of both gram-negative and grampositive bacteria12 14 25-27. The synergistic activity of BAK and CD indicates they may inactivate viruses via

complementary mechanisms. Beyond disrupting lipid viral envelopes, BAK alone has been shown to
inactivate various non-enveloped viruses including human coxsackie virus19, human adenoviruses28 and
enteroviruses14. However, BAK virucidal activity is less potent against non-enveloped viruses and requires
longer incubation times to achieve viral inactivation14. BAK and CD virucidal activity could also encompass
denaturation of viral glycoproteins required for attachment and entry. Indeed, chlorhexidine antimicrobial
activity has been associated with inhibition of membrane bound proteins as well as coagulation and
denaturation of cytoplasmic components, and may therefore access and denature viral proteins, especially
in the presence of BAK12 29. The virucidal activity of these compounds and Dermol 500 lotion against nonenveloped viruses requires further study, but we predict they will be at least as efficacious as alcohol-based
sanitisers, which inefficiently inactivate the majority of non-enveloped viruses1 30.
To conclude, this study confirms Dermol 500 lotion and its constituents inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and the
common respiratory virus influenza A. This broad virucidal and antimicrobial activity of Dermol 500 emollient
makes it a safe and efficacious soap substitute in healthcare settings to combat the adverse effects of
frequent hand washing and PPE. Its use can prevent and treat work-related irritant contact dermatitis,
helping curb the large increases in this skin condition seen during this pandemic. In turn, this will decrease
instances of staff sickness absence, or restriction from clinical work due to skin disease, enhance the safe and
timely delivery of clinical care, and benefit staff wellbeing.
