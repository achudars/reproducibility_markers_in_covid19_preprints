Abstract

26

The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants showing increased transmissibility and immune escape

27

is a matter of global concern. Their origin remains unclear, but intra-host virus evolution during

28

persistent infections could be a contributing factor. Here, we studied the long-term SARS-CoV-2

29

infection in an immunosuppressed organ transplant recipient. Frequent respiratory specimens were

30

tested for variant viral genomes by RT-qPCR, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and virus isolation.

31

Late in infection, several virus variants emerged which escaped neutralization by COVID-19

32

convalescent and vaccine-induced antisera and had acquired genome mutations similar to those found

33

in variants of concern first identified in UK, South Africa, and Brazil. Importantly, infection of

34

susceptible hACE2-transgenic mice with one of the patient’s escape variants elicited protective

35

immunity against re-infection with either the parental virus, the escape variant or the South African

36

variant of concern, demonstrating broad immune control. Upon lowering immunosuppressive treatment,

37

the patient generated spike-specific neutralizing antibodies and resolved the infection. Our results

38

indicate that immunocompromised patients are an alarming source of potentially harmful SARS-CoV-

39

2 variants and open up new avenues for the updating of COVID-19 vaccines.

Introduction

46

Individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop neutralizing spike-specific antibodies that persist for

47

months and protect against reinfection1. Similarly, neutralizing antibodies generated after vaccination

48

efficiently protect from COVID-192. However, the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the

49

UK (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P.1)3-5 pose a global threat due to their increased

50

transmissibility and resistance to neutralizing antibodies2. The origin of these virus variants remains

51

unclear, but long-term-infected immunocompromised individuals are a likely source, allowing

52

prolonged viral replication and unhindered adaption to the host6,7.

53

In Germany, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic started with local outbreaks in February 2020. The city of

54

Freiburg at the border to France and Switzerland was a hotspot due to multiple unrecognized infection

55

events in March 2020. Therefore, immunocompromised patients were closely monitored, as these

56

individuals were expected to have an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 illness and to suffer

57

from long-term persistent infection with prolonged viral shedding.

58

Here, we describe an immunosuppressed organ transplant recipient who acquired SARS-CoV-2 during

59

the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. The patient had mild respiratory symptoms and was tested

60

positive for SARS-CoV-2 for over 145 days. During this long period, virus variants with multiple amino

61

acid substitutions and deletions in the spike protein evolved that showed increased resistance to

62

neutralizing antibodies, suggesting partial immune escape. Interestingly, however, one of the late virus

63

variants isolated from the patient elicited a broad protective immune response in experimentally infected

64

mice, suggesting that convalescent individuals might become resistant against reinfection by emerging

65

variants of concern.

Results

68

Clinical presentation of the organ transplant patient persistently infected with SARS-CoV-2.

69

A male person in his 50´s was admitted in spring 2020 to the University Medical Center, Freiburg, for

70

transplantation. The patient was treated with a cocktail of tacrolimus, mycophenolate and prednisone

71

for 7 month (Fig. 1a and b).

72

The patient was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain

73

reaction (RT-qPCR) which is indicated with day 0(Fig. 1d). The source of infection remained unknown

74

but strict infection prevention measures were initiated. No respiratory symptoms at the time of diagnosis

75

were observed but a CT scan showed mild ground-glass opacities and discrete bilateral pleural effusions

76

on day 4. The patient remained SARS-CoV-2 positive in the following weeks and was therefore kept in

77

isolation. Two month after transplantation the patient suffered from a urinary tract infection with E. coli,

78

requiring antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, he was treated for 5-days (day 56 to 60) with Ivermectin

79

(33 mg/day) (Fig. 1c), a broad-spectrum drug with anti-viral activity in cell culture against several

80

viruses including SARS-CoV-28,9. While the bacterial urinary tract infection was controlled, the

81

infection with SARS-CoV-2 was not.

82

RT-qPCR positive swab samples were used to successfully isolate virus on VeroE6 cells confirming

83

shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1e). Due to his critical condition, the patient stayed in the

84

hospital until day 72 when he was discharged for home quarantine. However, he was re-hospitalized at

85

day 106 to 126. Afterwards, the immunosuppressive regimen was modified by withdrawing

86

mycophenolate mofetil treatment and by increasing the dose of prednisone (day 126) to allow for a better

87

antiviral adaptive immune response. After re-admission at day 140 for control purposes, the patient was

88

still RT-qPCR positive. As an attempt to control the infection, he was treated for 10 days with

89

Remdesivir (200 mg on day 140, then 100 mg/daily, day 141 - 149), a nucleoside analog with anti-

90

SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro10 and in vivo7,11. Subsequently, negative RT-qPCR tests until day 189 and

91

failed virus isolation attempts suggested that the infection had resolved (Fig. 1d and e) (Extended Table

92

1).

93

Nucleoprotein (N)-specific antibodies were detected already 12 days after the first positive qPCR result

94

and afterwards surged rapidly (Fig. 1f). In contrast, IgG antibody levels specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike

95

protein (S1) determined by ELISA constantly oscillated around the cutoff value between days 40 and

96

123. Only, when the patient was hospitalized at day 140, high levels of S1-specific IgG were detected

97

and persisted at least until day 175 (Fig. 1f). Concomitantly with the increased spike-specific antibodies

98

and the onset of Remdesivir treatment (day 140), RT-qPCR analysis showed steadily increasing Ct

99

values, indicating diminishing virus replication (Fig. 1d and Extended Table 1). In summary, during the

100

25 weeks of infection with SARS-CoV-2 the patient had no severe respiratory or systemic symptoms

101

and was finally able to clear the virus, likely due to the development of neutralizing antibodies and

102

possibly due to the inclusion of antiviral Remdesivir treatment.

103

Genetic relationship of the patient´s SARS-CoV-2 variants with circulating strains. Full-length

104

SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were obtained from oropharyngeal swabs collected between day 0 and

105

140 and phylogenetic trees were constructed including sequences representative for the Freiburg area in

106

spring 2020 (Fig. 2a) or a set of randomly selected GISAID sequences of isolates collected in Germany

107

in spring 2020(Fig. 2b). The viral genomic sequences obtained from the patient clearly clustered to those

108

of strains circulating in spring in Germany and in the Freiburg area (Fig. 2a and b). The phylogenetic

109

analysis also demonstrated a close relationship with sequences obtained from two patients of the Medical

110

Center Freiburg (Fig. 2a). However, no clear epidemiologic link was found between the

111

immunosuppressed and the other two patients.

112

Analysis of the viral RNA that has been extracted from the patient samples revealed several nucleotide

113

substitutions in ORF1ab, the spike gene, ORF3a, M and N genes in comparison to the Wuhan-Hu-1

114

reference genome (Fig. 2c). The continuous presence of nine common mutations in all sequences argues

115

against a possible reinfection but is compatible with viral persistence. Within the first two weeks, no

116

changes in the viral genome were observed, while from day 42 onward acquisition of several mutations

117

occurred. Apart from low frequency mutations, some mutations accumulated over time indicative for

118

the selection of distinct variants. The mutation 23403G resulting in the D614G substitution marks the

119

genotype that now dominates worldwide12.

120

The most remarkable changes found in the S gene, which were confirmed by Sanger sequencing of

121

cDNA clones, were in-frame deletions and non-synonymous substitutions in the N-terminal domain

122

(NTD) and the receptor binding motif (RBM) (Fig. 2d), respectively. Interestingly, the two amino acid

5

123

deletions in the NTD were associated with specific single amino acid substitutions in the RBM: del141-

124

144 with F490L and del244-247 with E484G. Both deletions, which are located in two adjacent flexible

125

loops of the NTD (Fig. 3), might affect the conformation of this subdomain and are targets of

126

neutralizing antibodies13,14. The two amino acid substitutions (E484G and F490L) may lead to subtle

127

conformational changes in the RBD, which is the main target of neutralizing antibodies and a known

128

hotspot for mutations conferring escape from neutralizing antibodies15-17. Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 spike

129

variants from the immunosuppressed patient share mutations with the escape variants of concern from

130

the UK, South Africa and Brazil (Fig. 2e).

131

Prolonged viral persistence resulted in impaired viral fitness. In the early phase of viral persistence

132

(days 0 to 34) virus isolation was successful, indicating constant virus shedding (Fig. 1e). We repeatedly

133

failed, however, to isolate virus thereafter when the Ct values increased above 25. On day 105, the Ct

134

value dropped to 23 and virus isolation was again successful (Fig. 1e). The sequences of the two distinct

135

virus isolates obtained at day 14 (d14) and day 105 (d105) were compared to the corresponding

136

sequences obtained from swab samples of the same day. While the sequences of the d14 isolate and the

137

d14 swab were identical, the sequence of the d105 isolate partially differed from the d105 swab sequence

138

(Fig. 4a). The viral genome sequences of the d105 isolate and the swab samples contained the amino

139

acid deletion 244-247 combined with the E484G mutation, while the amino acid deletion del141-144

140

and the F490L substitution were only found in the swab samples. Since the majority of the mutations in

141

the d105 isolate was also detected in the swab samples, the d105 virus might represent an abundant

142

genotype that was selected during persistence in the patient. However, we cannot exclude that some

143

alterations were introduced during the process of virus isolation in cell culture including a frame shift

144

deletion in ORF7b and a deletion of 21 nucleotides (del23601-23621) in about 50% of the reads that

145

mapped to the spike gene and resulted in the replacement of the eight amino acids SPRRARSV by a

146

single leucine upstream of the S1/S2 cleavage site (Fig. 4a).

147

The d14 and d105 isolates both showed accumulation of viral N- and spike proteins in infected cells by

148

indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses (Fig. 4b and c). In VeroE6 cells, both isolates

149

grew to comparable titers, whereas replication of the d105 isolate was impaired in human lung

150

adenocarcinoma Calu-3 cells (Fig. 4d). To confirm the attenuated phenotype of d105 in vivo, K18-

151

hACE2 mice encoding the human SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2

152

(ACE2)18 were intranasally infected with two different doses of the d14 and d105 isolates (200 or 2000

153

plaque-forming units (pfu)). Animals infected with the d14 isolate showed a significant weight loss

154

within 4 to 8 days. One out of eight animals infected with 200 pfu survived the infection, whereas all

155

animals infected with 2000 pfu had to be euthanized due to severe disease symptoms or weight loss

156

(Fig. 4e and f). In contrast, K18-hACE2 mice infected with the d105 isolate showed a transient weight

157

loss but only two out of seven animals infected with 2,000 pfu got severely sick and had to be sacrificed

158

(Fig. 4e and f), highlighting the attenuated phenotype of this isolate. Together these findings suggest

159

that the mutations in the viral genome of the d105 isolate caused reduced viral fitness.

160

SARS-CoV-2 escape variants emerged during viral persistence. The amino acid deletions and

161

substitutions in the spike proteins of the emerging viral variants could have been selected by the antiviral

162

immune response of the host. To address this issue, serum samples of the patient were tested for

163

neutralizing antibodies in a plaque reduction assay performed with either the d14 or the d105 virus

164

isolate. Only sera collected from the patient after day 123 showed SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity

165

(Fig. 5a), which coincided with the increase of S-specific IgG between day 123 and 140 (Fig. 1f).

166

Intriguingly, while the d14 isolate was efficiently neutralized up to serum dilutions of 1:128, the d105

167

virus was poorly inhibited even at the lowest serum dilutions used (1:32) (Fig. 5a), suggesting that the

168

substitutions in the d105 spike protein caused escape from neutralizing antibodies. The neutralization

169

titers detected in sera from the immunosuppressed patient were generally lower than those detected in

170

serum from an immunocompetent convalescent COVID-19 patient (Fig. 5a, positive control). Similarly,

171

antisera of convalescent COVID-19 patients and of individuals previously vaccinated with the

172

BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech) showed higher neutralizing activity against the d14

173

isolate as compared to the d105 isolate (Fig. 5b).

174

To independently determine the neutralization titer 50 (NT50) of convalescent sera against the various

175

spike variants found in the patient, we made use of a virus pseudotype system based on single-cycle

176

vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vector encoding a firefly luciferase reporter, VSV*∆G(FLuc). High

177

NT50 values were observed with the d14 spike protein (Fig. 5c). In contrast, pseudotype virus bearing

178

the d105 spike protein was neutralized with significantly lower efficacy as indicated by a 8.3-fold

179

reduced NT50 value (Fig. 5c).

180

Next, we analyzed pseudotype virus harboring the d14 spike protein with single or combined mutations

181

including del244-248 and E484G (for d105) and del141-144 and F490L (for d140) (Fig. 2d). Compared

182

to pseudotype virus displaying the parental d14 spike protein, viruses pseudotyped with either the

183

E484G or the F490L mutant spike proteins were equally well neutralized by a COVID-19 convalescent

184

serum, whereas pseudotype virus bearing spike proteins with the amino acid deletions del141-144 or

185

del244-247 were significantly less well neutralized (Fig. 5d). The combination of the amino acid

186

deletions del141-144 or del244-247 with either E484G or F490L did not further reduce neutralization

187

efficacy. A different pattern was observed when immune serum from a person who had been immunized

188

with an mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was analyzed (Fig. 5e). Using this immune serum, virus

189

pseudotyped with the E484G mutant spike was less well neutralized than virus bearing the parental spike

190

protein. Furthermore, pseudotype virus displaying spike protein containing both the E484G substitution

191

and the del141-144 deletion, was less efficiently neutralized than pseudotype viruses containing either

192

E484G or del141-144, suggesting that the two mutations acted in a synergistic manner. In summary, the

193

amino acid changes del141-144 and del244-247, both located in the NTD, and E484G in the RBD all

194

affect crucial antigenic regions19 which were selected during viral persistence as they allow escape of

195

SARS-CoV-2 from the humoral immune response.

196

SARS-CoV-2 escape variant d105 induces broad protective immunity in vivo. The reduced

197

neutralization capacity of the patient`s sera against the d105 isolate raised the question whether the

198

changes in the spike protein might have compromised the induction of an efficient antiviral immune

199

response. To address this question, sera from K18-hACE2 mice that survived the infection with the d14

200

or the d105 isolates (Fig. 4e and f) were collected 21 days post infection or later. We also prepared sera

201

from K18-hACE2 mice surviving infection with the Muc-IMB-1 isolate, lineage B.1, encoding an

202

identical spike protein sequence like the d14 isolate20, in order to increase the number of convalescent

203

sera of animals surviving infection with wild-type SARS-CoV-2. The sera of the animals that survived

204

infection with the wild-type viruses had about 2-fold higher levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG

205

antibodies (assessed by an immunofluorescence-based assay), than the sera of mice that survived the

206

milder d105 infection (Fig. 6a).

207

The capacity of sera obtained from the d14- and Muc-IMB-1-infected mice to neutralize the d105 isolate

208

was some 4-fold lower than the neutralizing capacity against the d14 isolate (Fig. 6b), indicating partial

209

immune escape of the d105 isolate. Intriguingly, the d105 mouse sera neutralized the d105 virus more

210

efficiently than the d14 isolate (Fig. 6c). Additionally, we tested the neutralization capacity of the

211

convalescent mouse sera against two recent German isolates of the UK (B.1.1.7) and the South Africa

212

(B.1.351) variants of concern. Sera of wild-type-infected mice were more effective in neutralizing the

213

B.1.1.7 virus variant than the B.1.351 variant (Fig. 6d). However, the opposite was observed using sera

214

from d105-infected animals since the B.1.351 variant demonstrated a higher sensitivity to neutralization

215

by the d105 sera than the B.1.1.7 variant (Fig. 6e). Finally, all convalescent animals, including those

216

infected with Muc-IMB-1, were challenged with a lethal dose (100,000 pfu) of either the d14 or the

217

d105 virus isolate one to four months after the first infection. In contrast to the naïve control animals,

218

all convalescent mice survived the challenge infection without any signs of disease or weight loss (Fig.

219

6f and g), demonstrating that the animals were protected against challenge infection by both virus

220

variants.

221

SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T cells are not driving emergence of escape variants. Finally, we

222

assessed whether the variations in the spike S1 domain also resulted in an escape from the CD8+ T cell

223

response. We performed in silico prediction of CD8+ T cell epitopes within the SARS-CoV-2 S1 domain

224

restricted by the HLA class I alleles of the immunosuppressed COVID-19 patient (HLA-A*02:01, HLA-

225

A*03:01, HLA-B*51:01, HLA-B*56:01). Using ANN4.0 of the Immune Epitope Database website21

226

we identified one nonamer peptide within the NTD with good binding properties to HLA-A*02:01 (S133-

227

141

228

A*03:01, both overlapping with del141-144. In addition, we identified a decamer peptide (S240-249) with

229

potential binding to HLA-A*02:01 that overlaps with del244-247. Further CD8+ T cell epitope peptides

230

overlapping with the E484G or F490L substitutions could not be predicted. Subsequently, we tested

231

whether the selected peptides represent SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes by incubating

232

PBMCs from the convalescent, immunosuppressed COVID-19 patient on day 233 or from

FQFCNDPFL) and another nonamer peptide (S142-150 GVYYHKNNK) with binding to HLA-

233

immunocompetent, convalescent, HLA-A*02:01/HLA-A*03:01 positive COVID-19 patients with the

234

peptides for 14 days. However, after stimulation with the selected peptides neither PBMCs from the

235

immunosuppressed nor from the convalescent donors showed any IFNγ-positive CD8+ T cell response

236

whereas a weak IFNγ-positive CD8+ T cell response targeting the non-overlapping epitope HLA-

237

A*03:01/S378-386 was detectable in PBMCs from the immunosuppressed patient (Extended Data Fig. 1).

238

This observation indicates that the predicted SARS-CoV-2 peptides that overlap with the mutated S1

239

regions do not represent CD8+ T cell epitopes. Hence, the mutations within the S1 regions of the d105

240

and d140 spike proteins were most probably not selected due to CD8+ T cell escape, but to escape from

241

the humoral response.

242
243

Discussion

244

Circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants typically acquire only few mutations over time which accumulate at

245

a relatively constant rate of about 1-2 mutations per month22. Accordingly, the predominant virus

246

genotypes initially found in swab samples during the first weeks of the persistent infection of the

247

immunocompromised patient were relatively stable and grouped into Nextstrain clade 20B, Pangolin

248

lineage B.1.1, together with simultaneously circulating variants (Fig. 2a and b). However, from day 42

249

onward, synonymous and non-synonymous mutations accumulated in the viral genomes, including two

250

in-frame amino acid deletions in the NTD (del141-144 and del244-247) as well as two single amino

251

acid exchanges (E484G and F490L) in the RBM. Interestingly, the substitutions in the RBM were

252

exclusively associated with one or the other of the deletions, namely F490L with del141-144 and E484G

253

with del244-247, respectively. This striking interlinked coevolution may have been favored by the

254

necessity to preserve the functionality or stability of the spike protein and to maintain or improve viral

255

fitness. The loops N3 (130-150) and N5 (240-260) that are affected by the two NTD deletions are a

256

preferred target of in-frame deletions of variable length and are therefore referred to as “recurrent

257

deletion regions”14.

258

Of note, the transient and altering patterns of amino acid changes in the viral spike protein were most

259

likely the result of an ongoing conflict between the persisting virus and the patient’s adaptive immune

260

system. The rather weak spike-specific antibody response between days 40 to 123 presumably selected

261

for spike escape variants, as demonstrated by their reduced sensitivity to inhibition by immune sera

262

obtained from the patient at later time points, or from convalescent COVID-19 patients, as well as from

263

COVID-19 vaccinated individuals. It is conceivable that prolonged viral replication in

264

immunosuppressed patients can lead to the emergence of new immune-escape variants, such as the

265

SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern like UK B.1.1.7, South Africa B.1.351 and Brazil P.1. They all share

266

mutations in the same regions of the spike protein as the escape variants described in this study (Fig.

267

2e). Accumulation of amino acid substitutions or deletions in similar regions of the spike protein were

268

reported before for isolates of persistently infected, immunosuppressed patients6,7 and also for isolates

269

from patients treated with antibody cocktails and convalescent plasma7,15,23.

270

The reasons for the late but sudden rise of spike-specific antibodies in the patient serum between day

271

123 and 141 are not clear. We suspect that the pausing of mycophenolate mofetil from day 126 until day

272

175 favored broad, spike-specific antibody response that finally terminated the infection. To allow

273

spike-specific antibody production, discontinuation of mycophenolate mofetil treatment of COVID-19-

274

infected transplant recipients is advisable and in line with current clinical guidelines e.g. of the British

275

Transplantation Society (https://bts.org.uk/information-resources/covid-19-information/, updated 22nd

276

January 2021). Adjusting immunosuppressive medications appears to be crucial for induction of an

277

antiviral immune response and clearance of SARS-CoV-224.

278

Postinfection sera from mice that survived infection with wild-type virus demonstrated reduced

279

neutralizing activity against the late d105 virus isolate, highlighting the antibody escape phenotype of

280

this variant. Conversely, sera from mice previously infected with the d105 isolate more efficiently

281

neutralized the d105 variant than the d14 virus. Hence, broadly neutralizing antibodies that were elicited

282

by new immunogenic epitopes exposed on the mutated d105 spike protein may have controlled the

283

escape variant in the persistently infected patient. To confirm such an extended neutralizing activity of

284

the d105 immune sera, we used recent virus variants of concern and detected enhanced neutralization of

285

the South Africa B.1.351 variant by the d105 antisera when compared to the UK B.1.1.7 variant. These

286

findings match with recent analyses of convalescent plasma samples from patients that recovered from

287

B.1.351 infections. Cele et al. showed efficient neutralization of an early 2020 isolate as well as of the

288

late South African variant of concern by these convalescent antisera 25. Because these globally emerging

289

viruses show a clear escape from vaccine induced humoral immunity2,26,27, our findings might be

290

important for the redesign of future vaccines.

291

The SARS-CoV-2 d105 variant that was isolated from the patient throat swab at a late stage of his

292

disease showed reduced viral fitness in Calu-3 cell cultures and in K18-hACE2 mice, but not in VeroE6

293

cells. The reason for attenuation and the causative mutations in the viral genome are presently not

294

known, but the observed viral growth restriction might depend on host cell-intrinsic innate restriction

295

factors. In addition, we detected a 21 nucleotide-long deletion in the multi basic cleavage site of the

296

spike protein connecting the S1 and S2 subdomains. Additional mutations included a truncation of

297

ORF7b, encoding an accessory protein with yet unknown biological function. Deletions in ORF7b have

298

been described in an early Asian cluster of SARS-CoV-2 without a sign of attenuation28 as well as in a

299

SARS-CoV/2003 clone29. As recently shown30, we assume that the loss of the multibasic furin cleavage

300

site during isolation in VeroE6 cells contributed to the attenuation of the d105 isolate.

301

In summary, we detected SARS-CoV-2 variants in a persistently infected immunocompromised patient

302

which partially escaped the humoral immune response. Such escape mutants could serve as initial seed

303

for newly emerging variants with enhanced epidemic potential, especially if they overcome impaired

304

viral fitness by further adaptation. Unexpectedly, the spike protein of this escape variant worked

305

particularly well in immunization approaches and elicited broadly active neutralizing antibodies able to

306

control SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

Methods

390

Case history. A patient in his 50´swas hospitalized at the University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany

391

for 7 monthHe underwent an organ transplantation and was treated with diverse regimens of

392

immunosuppression, consisting of tacrolimus (4 mg/day), mycophenolat mofetil (2 mg/day) and

393

prednisone (10 mg/day) (see figure 1). The patient received five days ivermectin treatment (33 mg/day)

394

and later a ten days Remdesivir treatment (200 mg on day 1, 100 mg/day 2 to 10).

395
396

Ethical statements. The project has been approved by the University Medical Center, Freiburg, ethical

397

committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and the study was conducted

398

according to federal guidelines, local ethics committee regulations (Albert-Ludwigs-Universität,

399

Freiburg, Germany: No. F-2020-09-03-160428 and no. 322/20) and the Declaration of Helsinki (1975).

400

All routine virological laboratory testing of patient specimens was performed in the Diagnostic

401

Department of the Institute of Virology, University Medical Center, Freiburg (Local ethics committee

402

no. 1001913).

403
404

Virus detection by qRT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing of respiratory tract samples was performed

405

using the RealStar SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR kit (Altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany). RNA samples

406

were extracted using QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Tests were

407

performed and interpreted according to the manufacturer’s instructions and semi-quantitative results

408

reported in cycle threshold (Ct) values.

409
410

Serological testing. Convalescent sera of COVID-19 patients and sera from vaccinees after the second

411

dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer/BioNTech) were obtained from the Hepatology-

414

SARS-CoV-2 specific anti-spike protein (S1) IgG (Euroimmun, Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG,

415

Lübeck, Germany) and anti-nucleoprotein (N) IgG ELISA (Mikrogen Diagnostik GmbH, Neuried,

416

Germany) were performed according to manufacturer’s protocol. Results were evaluated semi-

417

quantitatively as arbitrary units (AU) compared to the manufacturer’s calibrators.

418

To determine the SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in mouse sera, VeroE6 cells in 96-well plates were

419

infected with the prototypic Muc-IMB-1virus isolate (kindly provided by Roman Woelfel, Bundeswehr

420

Institute of Microbiology20). Fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated with dilutions of the post-

421

infectious mouse sera and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were detected by fluorescence-labeled

422

secondary anti-mouse IgG antiserum. The serum dilution giving a clear fluorescence signal in the

423

infected cells was interpreted as positive.

424

For the SARS-CoV-2 neutralization plaque reduction assay, serial serum dilutions were incubated with

425

100 plaque forming units (pfu) for 1 hour. The mixture was dispersed on VeroE6 cells in 12-well format

426

and the cells were overlaid with 0.6% Oxoid-agar for 48 h at 37°C. The fixed cells were stained with

427

Crystal violet. Number of plaques was compared with an untreated control without serum.

428

For the detection of neutralizing antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence, 400 pfu of SARS-CoV-2

429

were preincubated with serially diluted serum samples for 1h and the mixture was used to infect VeroE6

430

cells in 96-well plates. For each sample, one control without serum was included. Cells were fixed 20 h

431

post infection and stained with anti-SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) rabbit antiserum (#200-401-A50,

432

Rockland Immunochemicals). The plates were evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. The highest

433

dilution of the serum that showed less than 50% of infected cells compared to a non-reactive control

434

serum was classified as neutralization titer.

435
436

SARS-CoV-2 S1-specific T cell response. The S1 amino-acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2

437

(GenBank: MN908947.3) was analyzed for in silico prediction of peptide binding with ANN 4.0 on the

438

Immune Epitope Database website21. The HLA-A*02:01-restricted 9-mer peptide, S133-141

439

FQFCNDPFL, and the HLA-A*03:01-restricted 9-mer peptide, S142-150 GVYYHKNNK, both

440

overlapping with del141-144, the HLA-A*02:01-restricted 10-mer peptide, S244-247 TLLALHRSYL,

441

overlapping with del244-247, as well as a HLA-A*03:01-restricted 9-mer peptide, S378-386

KCYGVSPTK, of the S1 domain were selected and synthesized for further analysis. Subsequently,

443

PBMCs (1−2 × 106) of the convalescent immunosuppressed COVID-19 patient and of four HLA-

444

A*02:01/HLA-A*03:01 positive SARS-CoV-2 convalescent immunocompetent donors were stimulated

445

with these peptides (5 µM) and anti-CD28 mAb (0.5 µg ml−1, BD Biosciences) and expanded for 14

446

days in complete RPMI culture medium containing rIL2 (20 IU ml−1, Miltenyi Biotec). IFNγ production

447

was assessed after a 5h re-stimulation with the respective peptide 31.

449

Cell culture. Virus isolation, cell culture and mouse infection experiments with SARS-CoV-2 were

450

performed under Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) protocols at the Institute of Virology, Freiburg, approved by

451

the Regierungspraesidium Tuebingen (No. 25-27/8973.10-18 and UNI.FRK.05.16-29). Filtered throat

452

swab samples were inoculated on African green monkey kidney VeroE6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) (2 x

453

106 cells) in 4 ml DMEM with 2% FCS and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 4 to 6 days until

454

cytopathic effect was visible. The culture supernatant was cleared and stored at -80°C. Virus titers were

455

determined by plaque assay on VeroE6 cells.

456

For neutralization assays we used established prototypic isolates: Muc-IMB-1, lineage B.120; UK variant

457

B.1.1.7 (hCoV-19/Germany/NW-RKI-I-0026/2020; ID: EPI_ISL_751799) and South African variant

458

B.1.351 (hCoV-19/Germany/NW-RKI-I-0029/2020; ID: EPI_ISL_803957).

459

VeroE6 or human bronchial epithelium Calu-3 cells (ATCC-HTB-55) in 6-well plates, 1 x 106 cells,

460

were infected with a moi of 0.001 for 1.5h. Cells were washed three times with PBS and overlaid with

461

2 mL DMEM with 2% FCS. The supernatants were taken at different time points after infection and

462

titers were determined by plaque assay. For viral protein analysis, the cells were lysed with tissue protein

463

extraction reagent (T-PER; Thermo Fisher Scientific), separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamid gel

464

electrophoresis and transferred on PVDF membranes. The membranes were stained with the SARS-

465

CoV-2 N-specific, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (RBD)-specific (200-401-A50 and 600-401-MS8,

466

Rockland) or actin-specific (A5060, Sigma) rabbit antisera. Detection of the primary antibodies was

467

performed with fluorescent-labeled (Li-COR) secondary antibodies.

Immunofluorescence analysis. VeroE6 cells seeded on glass coverslips were infected with SARS-

470

CoV-2 isolates at a moi of 0.1. At 8 hours post infection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,

471

permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 and blocked in 10% fetal calf serum. SARS-CoV-2 N- and spike-

described33. Cells were incubated in medium containing the monoclonal mAb I1 antibody (ATCC)

485

directed against VSV-G. The supernatants containing the pseudotype viruses were harvested and stored

486

at -70°C.

487

The pseudotyped virus neutralization test was performed as described recently34. Pseudotyped

488

VSV*∆G(FLuc) (200 ffu) were preincubated with twofold serial dilutions of convalescent sera in

489

DMEM cell culture medium. The virus/serum mixture was transferred to VeroE6 cells in 96-well plates

490

and incubated for 16 hours at 37°C. Thereafter, the cells were lysed and firefly luciferase activity was

491

determined using ONE-GloTM substrate (Promega) and a GloMax® plate reader (Promega). The

492

reciprocal antibody dilution causing 50% reduction of the luminescence signal was calculated and

493

expressed as neutralization titer 50% (NT50).

used in accordance with the guidelines of the Federation for Laboratory Animal Science Associations

498

and the National Animal Welfare Body. All experiments were in compliance with the German animal

499

protection law and approved by the animal welfare committee of the Regierungspraesidium Freiburg

500

(permit G-20/91).

501

Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane and infected intranasally (i.n.) with virus dilutions in 40 µl PBS

502

containing 0.1 % BSA. Mice were monitored daily and euthanized if severe symptoms were observed

503

or body weight loss exceeded 25 % of the initial weight. Serum samples were collected from the vena

504

facialis. SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody titers were determined by indirect immunofluorescence as

505

described above.

506
507

Whole genome sequencing. cDNA was produced from extracted RNA of oropharyngeal swab samples

508

using random hexamer primers and Superscript III (ThermoFisher) followed by a PCR tiling the entire

509

SARS-CoV-2 genome (ARTIC V3 primersets; https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019). This

510

produced 400 bp long, overlapping amplicons that were subsequently used to prepare the sequencing

511

library. Briefly, the amplicons were cleaned with AMPure magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter).

512

Afterwards the QIAseq FX DNA Library Kit (Qiagen) was used to prepare indexed paired end libraries

513

for Illumina sequencing. Normalized and pooled sequencing libraries were denatured with 0.2 N NaOH.

514

This 9 pM library was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument using the 300-cycle MiSeq Reagent

515

Kit v2.

516

For sequencing of virus stocks produced in cell culture, RNA was extracted with the Quick-RNA Viral

517

Kit (Zymo Research) and paired end libraries without a previous PCR amplification were prepared using

518

the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Kit (Illumina). A total of 10 pM library was sequenced on the Illumina

519

MiSeq instrument.

520

The de-multiplexed raw reads were subjected to a custom Galaxy pipeline, which is based on

521

bioinformatics pipelines on usegalaxy.eu (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.3685264)35. The raw reads were pre-

522

processed with fastp (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/274100v2) and mapped to the SARS-

produced with the ARTIC v3 protocol, primer sequences were trimmed with ivar trim (https://andersen-

526

lab.github.io/ivar/html/manualpage.html). Variants (SNPs and INDELs) were called with the

527

ultrasensitive variant caller LoFreq (https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/40/22/11189/1152727),

528

demanding a minimum base quality of 30 and a coverage of at least 5-fold. Afterwards, the called

529

variants were filtered based on a minimum variant frequency of 10 % and on the support of strand bias.

530

The effects of the mutations were automatically annotated in the vcf files with SnpEff

531

(https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/fly.19695).

consensus sequences have been deposited in the GISAID database (www.gisaid.org) (Extended data

538

(http://gisaid.org/) between February and April 2020 were downloaded (as of 11th of February 2021)

539

and 250 sequences randomly subsampled excluding sequences already deposited by the Virology in

540

Freiburg (Extended data table 3). For the phylogenetic analysis, the sequences were first aligned with

541

MAFFT (v7.45)36 and a tree was constructed with IQ-Tree (v2.1.2)37. The best fitting substitution model

542

was automatically determined and the tree was calculated with 1000 bootstrap replicates. Branch support

543

was approximated using the Shimodaira–Hasegawa [SH]-aLRT method (1000 replicates). The tree was

544

rooted to the reference sequence NC_045512. The clades were classified with the webservers of

545

Nextclade (clades.nextstrain.org) and Pangolin (pangolin.cog-uk.io). To visualize the phylogenetic tree

546

a custom R script was written utilizing the ggtree (v2.2.4) (https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-

(https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-24277-4_12). An in-house R script was also used

550

to plot the variant frequencies that were detected by LoFreq as a heatmap (pheatmap package v1.0.12).

Fig. 4 The late SARS-CoV-2 isolate with deletions in the spike protein is attenuated. (a) Schematic overview of the sequence
variations in SARS-CoV-2 genomes detected in early (d14) or late (d105) swab samples and isolated viruses. The heatmap illustrates
the positions and the frequency of major variations in the viral genome (cut off 15%). The days of isolation are indicated at the right.
The heatmap colors represent the variant frequencies. In ORF7b, L14* indicates a frame shift mutation due to a deletion of two
nucleotides. (b) Immunofluorescence analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected cell cultures. VeroE6 cells were infected with one of the two
virus isolates (d14 or d105) using a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 0.1 plaque forming units (pfu)/cell. At 8 h post infection, the cells
were fixed and stained with SARS-CoV-2 N- and S-specific antibodies (red). In addition, F-actin (white) and nuclear DNA (DAPI, blue)
were detected. (c) Western blot analysis of viral protein expression. Calu-3 cells were infected with a moi of 0.001 pfu/cell with either
of the two virus isolates (d14 or d105). Cells were lysed 8h, 24h, 48h and 72h post-infection and analyzed using N- and S-specific
antibodies. Detection of β-actin was used as loading control. (Fig.4 continued on the following page)

Fig. 4 continued: (d) Growth of the two patient isolates in VeroE6 and Calu-3 cells. The cells were infected with either of the two patient
isolates (d14 or d105) using a moi of 0.001 pfu/cell. At different time points post infection, cell culture supernatants were collected and
viral titers were determined by plaque assay on VeroE6 cells. The log-transformed titers are shown as means ± SD of results from three
independent experiments. Significance was determined via two-way ANOVA with a Sidak´s multiple comparison test, **p<0.0021,
***p<0.0002, ns=non significant. (E and F) Late SARS-CoV-2 isolate is attenuated in mice. Weight loss (e) and survival (f) of 8 to 12
weeks-old K18-hACE2 mice intranasally infected with 200 or 2000 pfu of d14 or d105 viruses. Signs of disease and body weight loss
were monitored daily for 14 days. The weight loss is visualized as mean ± SEM. Significance was determined via two-way ANOVA with
a Sidak´s multiple comparison test, *p<0.0332, **p<0.0021, ***p<0.0002.

Fig. 5 Delayed seroconversion and viral escape from the spike protein-specific antibody response. (a and b) Detection of neutralizing
activity of immune sera against SARS-CoV-2 variants. 100 pfu of the d14 and d105 isolates were incubated for 60 min at room temperature
with serial dilutions of the patient sera. Sera obtained from naïve (– ctrl) or convalescent individuals (+ ctrl) served as negative and positive
controls. Virus neutralization was determined by plaque assay on VeroE6 cells. Virus titers are indicated as percentages (mean ±SD) of the
titer of the untreated virus inoculum. The dotted lines indicate the cutoff value between positive (<50%) and negative (>50%) neutralization.
(a) Sera from the immunocompromised patient. The times of blood withdrawal are indicated. (b) Convalescent sera from COVID-19 patients
suffering from mild, moderate or severe disease or human post vaccination (BNT162b2 mRNA) sera. (c-e) Neutralization capacity of SARSCoV-2 antisera using VSV*∆G(FLuc) vector pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and coding for firefly luciferase. The
pseudotyped viruses were incubated with serial dilutions of a COVID-19 convalescent serum prior to inoculation of VeroE6 cells. Pseudotyped
virus infection was monitored 16 h post infection by measuring the firefly luciferase activity in the cell lysates. (c) Neutralization of
VSV*∆G(FLuc) pseudotyped with the early and late SARS-CoV-2 spike variants (d14 and d105) using serial dilutions of a COVID-19
convalescent serum. (d and e) Neutralization of VSV*∆G(FLuc) pseudotyped with the d14 spike protein containing the individual or combined
mutations characteristically found in the late d105 and d140 variants. Immune serum from a convalescent COVID-19 patient (d) or a
vaccinated person (e) were analyzed. The neutralization was determined by calculating the NT50 via a non-linear regression (variable slope,
four parameters). Shown are means ± SD (n=3). Statistics were calculated with a one-way ANOVA (Tukey’s multiple comparison test), ns =
non-significant, *p<0.0332, **p<0.0021, ***p<0.0002.

Fig. 6 Late SARS-CoV-2 isolate elicits cross-reactive protective immunity in mice. Sera were collected from convalescent K18hACE2 mice at least 21 days post infection with Muc-IMB-1 (n=5), d14 (n=2) or d105 (n=13) virus isolates. (a) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers
of serially diluted sera (mean ±SD) were determined using virus-infected cells and indirect immunofluorescence analysis (IFA). (b and c)
Neutralization of d14 and d105 virus isolates by convalescent mouse sera obtained after infection with wild-type SARS-CoV-2, d14 and
Muc-IMB-1 (anti-wt sera, n=7) (b), or with variant d105 virus isolate (anti-d105 sera, n=13) (c). Neutralization capacity was determined by
incubating 100 pfu of either virus isolate with serial dilutions of the mouse sera. The mixture was then applied to VeroE6 cells and infected
cells were stained with N-specific antibodies. The highest dilution for each individual serum causing 50% neutralization was plotted as
neutralizing titer. (d and e) Neutralization of B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants of concern by mouse convalescent sera was determined as
described in panels b and c. 100 pfu of the variant viruses were incubated with dilutions of sera from mice infected with wild-type SARSCoV-2 (wt) (d) or d105 isolate (e). Neutralization titers are meant as the highest dilution for each individual serum causing 50% reduction
of infectivity. Each serum titer (b - e) is shown as mean out of two independent experiments. Significance was determined via a paired t
test with *p<0.0332, **p<0.0021, ***p<0.0002. (f and g) Convalescent animals are protected against re-challenge infection. Weight loss
(f) and survival (g) of convalescent K18-hACE2 mice (mean ± SEM), challenged one to four months after the prime infection. Animals
primarily infected with d14 and Muc-IMB-1 viruses (pooled wt survivors, n=7), or with d105 virus (n=14) were intranasally challenged with
100,000 pfu of d14 or d105 viruses (2 to 7 mice per group, as indicated). As a control, naïve 8 weeks old K18-hACE2 mice were
intranasally infected with 100,000 pfu of d14 or d105 isolate viruses (n=2 per group).

Extended Data Fig. 1 Lack of detectable CD8+ T cell responses targeting the mutated regions in the spike protein. HLA-A*02:01/HLA-A*03:01-restricted CD8+ T cell epitopes overlapping
with the del141-144 and the del244-247 deletions as well as a control peptide 378-386 in the S1 domain were predicted in silico. Peptide-specific CD8+ T cell responses were assessed by
intra-cellular IFN production following a 14-day in vitro peptide-specific CD8+ T cell expansion. CD8+ T cells targeting the in silico-predicted SARS-CoV-2 S1-specific, HLA-A*02:01/HLA-A*03:01restricted CD8+ T cell epitopes were neither detectable in the convalescent, immunosuppressed COVID-19 patient (upper panel) nor in four additional HLA-A*02:01/HLA-A*03:01 positive
convalescent, immunocompetent COVID-19 patients (donor 1 to 4). CD8+ T cell responses targeting the immunodominant A*03:01/S378-386 epitope are depicted as positive control, as well as mockstimulated and PMA/Ionomycin-stimulated cells.
