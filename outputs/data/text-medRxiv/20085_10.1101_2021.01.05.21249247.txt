ABSTRACT
Background: Qatar has experienced a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Our first objective was to
assess the proportion of the urban population that has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, by
measuring the prevalence of detectable antibodies. Our second objective was to identify
predictors for infection and for having higher antibody titers.
Methods: Residual blood specimens from individuals receiving routine and other clinical care
between May 12-September 9, 2020 were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Associations
with seropositivity and higher antibody titers were identified through regression analyses.
Probability weights were applied in deriving the epidemiological measures.
Results: We tested 112,941 individuals (~10% of Qatar’s urban population), of whom 51.6%
were men and 66.0% were 20-49 years of age. Seropositivity was 13.3% (95% CI: 13.1-13.6%)
and was significantly associated with sex, age, nationality, clinical-care type, and testing date.
The proportion with higher antibody titers varied by age, nationality, clinical-care type, and
testing date. There was a strong correlation between higher antibody titers and seroprevalence in
each nationality, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.47-0.96), suggesting
that higher antibody titers may indicate repeated exposure to the virus. The percentage of
antibody-positive persons with prior PCR-confirmed diagnosis was 47.1% (95% CI: 46.148.2%), severity rate was 3.9% (95% CI: 3.7-4.2%), criticality rate was 1.3% (95% CI: 1.11.4%), and fatality rate was 0.3% (95% CI: 0.2-0.3%).
Conclusions: Fewer than two in every 10 individuals in Qatar’s urban population had detectable
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 between May 12-September 9, 2020, suggesting that this
population is still far from the herd immunity threshold and at risk from a subsequent epidemic
wave.

Introduction
With the breakthrough development of highly efficacious vaccines against the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1-3], determining the population’s
cumulative infection exposure and current immunity level is critical to inform national vaccine
roll-out strategies.
Qatar, located in the Arabian peninsula, with a multinational population of 2.8 million people,
nearly all living in the capital city, Doha, had a significant first wave of COVID-19 that peaked
in late May 2020 [4,5]. As of December 23, 2020, >60,000 infections per million population had
been laboratory-confirmed [6,7]. Qatar has a unique socio-demographic structure, in which
single-unit and family households including children, adults and/or older adults, account for only
40% of the total population, with adults in this “urban population” often being part of the
professional or service workforce [4,8,9]. The remaining 60% of the population consists of craft
and manual workers (CMWs) [4,8,9]—mostly single, young men working in development
projects [9] and typically living in large, shared accommodations [10].
Infection transmission in Qatar was first documented among CMWs on March 6, 2020 [11], who
were subsequently most affected by this epidemic [12]. A recently completed nationwide,
population-based survey assessing “ever” infection among the CMW population found that six
out of every ten persons had detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that this
population is at or near herd immunity [13]. In the present study, the first objective was to assess
the level of infection exposure among the rest of the population of Qatar, that of the “urban
population” of this country. The second objective was to identify predictors for infection and for
having higher antibody titers.

Data sources
A cross-sectional serological study was conducted from May 12 to September 9, 2020 to assess
the level of and associations with antibody positivity in the urban population of Qatar. The
sample included residual blood specimens collected from individuals receiving routine and other
clinical care at Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), a main provider of healthcare to the urban
population of this country and the nationally designated provider for Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19) healthcare needs.
Antibody data generated during the study were subsequently linked to the national centralized
SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and hospitalization database, which
includes records for all PCR testing and COVID-19 hospitalizations in Qatar since the start of
the epidemic [14]. The database further includes the severity classification of hospitalized cases,
based on individual chart reviews completed by trained medical personnel using the World
Health Organization (WHO) criteria [15]. The study was approved by the HMC and Weill
Cornell Medicine-Qatar Institutional Review Boards. The study was conducted following the
ethics review boards guidelines and regulations.
Laboratory methods
Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Roche, Switzerland), an electrochemiluminescence
immunoassay, was used for antibody detection in serological samples. Result interpretation
followed manufacturer instructions: reactive for optical density (a proxy for antibody titer) cutoff
index ≥1.0 and non-reactive for cutoff index <1.0 [16].
Current infection was assessed using PCR testing of aliquots of Universal Transport Medium
(UTM) used for nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab collection (Huachenyang Technology,

China). Aliquots were extracted on the QIAsymphony platform (QIAGEN, USA) and tested with
real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) using the TaqPath™ COVID-19 Combo Kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) on an ABI 7500 FAST (Thermo Fisher, USA). Samples were
extracted using a custom protocol [17] on a Hamilton Microlab STAR (Hamilton, USA) and
tested using the AccuPower SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time RT-PCR Kit (Bioneer, Korea) on an ABI
7500 FAST, or loaded directly into a Roche cobas® 6800 system and assayed with the cobas®
SARS-CoV-2 Test (Roche, Switzerland). All laboratory testing was conducted at HMC Central
Laboratory following standardized protocols.
Statistical analysis
Frequency distributions were used to describe sample characteristics and optical density among
antibody-positive persons. Probability weights were applied to generate estimates representing
the wider urban population. Weights were developed using population distributions by sex, age
group, and nationality in the Primary Health Care Corporation (PHCC) database [18]. This
database essentially covers the urban population of Qatar and includes 1,468,837 registered
users, distributed across Qatar’s 27 PHCC centers [18].
Associations with anti-SARS-CoV-2 positivity, as well as with higher antibody titers (defined as
optical density higher than the median value) were investigated using chi-square tests and
univariable logistic regression. Covariates with p-values ≤0.2 in univariable regression analysis
were included in the multivariable model. Covariates with p-values ≤0.05 in the multivariable
analysis were regarded as strong evidence for an association with the outcome. Odds ratios
(ORs), adjusted ORs (AORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and p-values were reported.
The antibody database was linked to the SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and hospitalization database
to enable estimation of other epidemiologic metrics. The latter included the proportion of

antibody-positive persons who had a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by PCR prior to the
antibody test. Numbers of infections that were classified as severe, critical, or fatal, according to
WHO criteria [15], among all antibody-positive persons, were used to estimate severity,
criticality, and fatality rates.
Results
In all, 112,941 individuals were tested, representing ~10% of the urban population of Qatar [4]
(Table 1). Of these, 51.6% were men. Two-thirds (66%) of tested persons were 20-49 years of
age. Qatari (25.8%) and Indian nationals (16.5%) were most heavily represented in the sample,
reflecting their representation in the urban population [5,8,19]. Specimens were collected in the
course of routine clinical care during home care visits (34.2%), outpatient visits (28.5%),
inpatient hospital stays (21.0%), and emergency department visits (16.4%). Overall, the sample
mirrored the urban population demographics [5,8,9].
A total of 18,844 individuals had detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies—a weighted antibody
positivity of 13.3% (95% CI: 13.1-13.6%). Seropositivity was independently associated with sex,
age, nationality, clinical-care type, and calendar date of the antibody test in the multivariable
regression analysis (Table 1). Men had two-fold higher odds of being seropositive (AOR of 2.07;
95% CI: 1.95-2.21) than women. Similarly, the AOR was two-fold higher for adults 20-79 years
of age than for children <10 years of age. Seropositivity varied by nationality. Compared to other
nationalities, AOR was 5.05 (95% CI: 4.63-5.50) for Bangladeshis, 4.26 (95% CI: 3.87-4.69) for
Nepalese, 3.45 (95% CI: 3.07-3.87) for Pakistanis, 1.95 (95% CI: 1.80-2.13) for Indians, 1.85
(95% CI: 1.60-2.13) for Sri Lankans, 1.59 (95% CI: 1.41-1.78) for Filipinos, 1.36 (95% CI: 1.151.61) for Sudanese, 1.33 (95% CI: 1.19-1.48) for Egyptians, and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.86-1.04) for
Qataris. Compared to emergency department attendees, AOR was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.81-0.94) for

outpatients and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.66-0.78) for patients with home-care visits or follow-up
consultations, and 1.19 (95% CI: 1.10-1.28) for inpatients. There was evidence of increasing
seropositivity over time (Table 1 and Table S1 of Supplementary Information (SI)), but at a slow
rate. The AOR (per day) was 1.002 (95% CI: 1.001-1.003; Table 1).
Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of antibody titers (optical density values) among the 18,844
antibody-positive persons. Optical density values ranged from 1.0 to 150.0 with a median of
27.0. Having higher antibody titers than the median was not associated with sex, but in the
multivariable regression analysis they were independently associated with age, nationality,
clinical-care type, and the calendar date of the antibody test (Table 2). Compared to those aged
20-29 years, the AOR was higher in children <10 years and adults aged 40-79 years. There were
significant differences by nationality. AOR was 1.68 (95% CI: 1.45-1.94) for Bangladeshis, 1.54
(95% CI: 1.32-1.80) for Nepalese, 1.30 (95% CI: 1.05-1.61) for Filipinos, 1.22 (95% CI: 1.051.43) for Indians, 1.19 (95% CI: 0.98-1.44) for Pakistanis, 1.12 (95% CI: 0.87-1.44) for Sri
Lankans, 1.04 (95% CI: 0.77-1.41) for Sudanese, 0.82 (95% CI: 0.67-1.01) for Egyptians, and
0.78 (95% CI: 0.65-0.94) for Qataris. Compared to emergency department attendees, inpatients
had an AOR for higher antibody positivity of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.34-0.43), while no difference was
found for outpatients or for patients with home-care visits or follow-up consultations. Having
higher antibody titers increased with time (Table 2 and Table S2 of SI), with an AOR (per day)
of 1.011 (95% CI: 1.010-1.013; Table 2).
There was a strong correlation between the AOR for higher antibody titers in each nationality
and the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of that nationality (Figure 2). The Pearson
correlation coefficient was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.47-0.96), possibly indicating that higher antibody
titers correlate with repeated exposures to this coronavirus.

Of the 18,844 antibody-positive persons, 9,375 had a PCR-confirmed diagnosis prior to the
antibody-positive test—47.1% (95% CI: 46.1-48.2%) (Table 3). Meanwhile, 1,085 of the 18,844
antibody-positive persons had or progressed to a severe infection, and 393 had or progressed to
critical infection. Thus, the infection severity rate was 3.9% (95% CI: 3.7-4.2%), the infection
criticality rate was 1.3% (95% CI: 1.1-1.4%), and the combined infection severity or criticality
rate was 5.2% (95% CI: 4.9-5.5%). With exactly 100 COVID-19 deaths recorded among the
antibody-positive persons, the infection fatality rate was 0.3% (95% CI: 0.2-0.3%).
Discussion
The above results indicate that <20% of the urban population of Qatar, which constitutes ~40%
of the total population and includes nearly all older adults, manifests evidence of prior infection,
substantially less than the seroprevalence in the CMW part of the population, which was
estimated recently in a nationwide survey at 55.3% [13].
This finding suggests that the lockdown and imposed social and physical distancing restrictions
have been more successful in slowing transmission in the urban population compared to the
CMW population. Building on the totality of evidence on the Qatar epidemic [11-13,20,21], this
is possibly due to differences in the dwelling structure, in that the urban population lives mostly
in single-unit or family households that each includes a small number of individuals. Meanwhile,
the CMW population lives mostly in large shared accommodations that each includes a large
number of individuals. While the lockdown forced individuals to stay more at home, it is typical
to have more social contacts every day at home in the large shared accommodations than in the
single-unit or family households, thereby reducing the options for effective social and physical
distancing. This outcome highlights the role of the “boarding school” effect in respiratory
infection transmission, seen often in the intense influenza outbreaks in regular and boarding

schools [22,23]. This effect has been also seen in the large SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in nursing
homes in Europe and the United States [24-26].
With a seroprevalence of <20%, the urban population of Qatar remains far below the herd
immunity threshold, estimated at 60-70% infection exposure [21,27,28]. Accordingly, there
exists a potential for subsequent waves of infection in this part of the population, though no
second wave has materialized since the epidemic peaked in late May, 2020, seven months ago
[12,20]. On the contrary, only a slow increase in seroprevalence has occurred since the peak of
the first wave (Table S1 of SI), reflecting the actual low incidence of infection in Qatar over the
last few months [20]. The absence of a second wave, despite the lack of a lockdown and easing
of many social distancing restrictions, may be explained by an “immunity shield” effect [29]
arising from the social mixing between the urban and CMW populations, and by effective
implementation of “ Rt tuning”, an adjustment of restrictions based on the Rt value, by national
policymakers, to prevent a second wave [20].
There were significant differences in seropositivity by sex, age, and nationality. These are
probably not due to biological differences, but to differences in the likelihood of exposure to the
infection. Indeed, a small proportion of the specimens tested in this study belonged to CMWs
who had a higher risk of exposure to the infection than the urban population [13,21]. While
HMC provides healthcare primarily to the urban population and other providers cater to the
CMW population, HMC is the main tertiary care center in Qatar, and was also the nationally
designated provider for COVID-19 healthcare needs. Thus, it is likely that a small proportion of
specimens, which cannot be estimated precisely, was drawn from CMWs who were hospitalized
for COVID-19 or other reasons. This may explain the higher antibody positivity of young
Bangladeshi, Indian, and Nepalese men (Table 1), who form the bulk of the CMW population
9

[13,21]. This may also explain the higher seroprevalence in the blood specimens drawn during
inpatient or emergency clinical-care, which are more likely to be COVID-19-related, than those
drawn during outpatient or home care/follow-up consultation clinical-care (Table 1). The higher
exposure among men 20-69 years of age probably reflects their more frequent work and other
activities outside the home, whereas men ≥70 years of age, urged through public-health
messaging to remain at home, were more likely to do so, out of concern about infection severity.
The proportion of those antibody-positive who had a PCR-confirmed diagnosis prior to the
antibody-positive test, was 47.1% (Table 3), much higher than the 9.3% in the CMW population
[13], and that estimated for the total population of Qatar (11.6%) [20]. This is probably because
study specimens were drawn from individuals receiving healthcare, including those hospitalized
for COVID-19, people more likely to have been tested for the infection. This fact, along with the
difference in age structure between the urban and CMW populations [4,8,9,13], may have
resulted in higher estimates of infection severity, criticality, and fatality rates in this study (Table
3), compared to the study of the CMW population [13], or model predictions for the entire
population of Qatar [30].
Strikingly, having a higher antibody titer varied by nationality, clinical-care type, and with time
(Table 2). Variation by nationality is probably an indirect biomarker of re-exposure to infection,
resulting in repeated immune-system reactivation. This is suggested by the very strong positive
correlation between the odds of having a higher antibody titer and seroprevalence across the
nationalities (Figure 2). Lower antibody titers were found in inpatients, but this may reflect
COVID-19 hospitalizations for recent infections, so that there was not sufficient time for higher
antibody titers to develop. There was a trend of increasing higher antibody titers over time,
which may reflect the growing pool of infected persons who have had more time to develop

higher levels of detectable antibodies post-infection, or alternatively to being re-exposed to the
infection.
This study has some limitations. The sample included individuals attending HMC for routine or
other clinical care, but this population may not necessarily be representative of the wider urban
population of Qatar. Some specimens may have been drawn from CMWs, who are not
representative of the urban population. However, the large sample size, equivalent to ~10% of
the urban population of Qatar, as well as the probabilistic weighting used in the analysis may
have reduced inherent biases in our sample. Laboratory methods were based on high-quality,
validated commercial platforms, such as the Roche platform used for serological testing [16,31].
The Roche platform is one of the most extensively used and investigated commercial platforms,
with a specificity ≥99.8% [16,32,33] and a sensitivity ≥89% [12,31,33]. However, it is possible
that the less-than-perfect sensitivity, especially for those with recent infections, may have
underestimated the actual seroprevalence. Indeed, a recent investigation of the performance of
three automated, commercial, serological platforms in Qatar, including the Roche platform,
found that each of them missed ≥20% of individuals with past or current infections [34].
In conclusion, fewer than two in every 10 individuals in the urban population of Qatar had
detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that this population is still well below the
herd immunity threshold and is potentially at risk from a subsequent epidemic wave. This
emphasizes the need to maintain current social and physical distancing restrictions while SARSCoV-2 vaccinations are being scaled up throughout the country. The findings also suggest that
higher antibody titers appear to be a biomarker of repeated exposures to the infection.
