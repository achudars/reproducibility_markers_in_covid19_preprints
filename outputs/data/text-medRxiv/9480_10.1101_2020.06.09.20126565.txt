ABSTRACT
The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and pandemic has taken the world by surprise and simultaneously challenged the
health infrastructure of every country. Governments have resorted to draconian measures to contain the spread of the disease
despite its devastating effect on their economies and education. Tracking the novel coronavirus 2019 disease remains vital as
it influences the executive decisions needed to tighten or ease restrictions meant to curb the pandemic. One-Dimensional
(1D) Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) have been used classify and predict several time-series and sequence data. Here
1D-CNN is applied to the time-series data of confirmed COVID-19 cases for all reporting countries and territories. The model
performance was 90.5% accurate. The model was used to develop an automated AI tracker web app (AI Country Monitor) and
is hosted on https://aicountrymonitor.org. This article also presents a novel concept of pandemic response curves
based on cumulative confirmed cases that can be use to classify the stage of a country or reporting territory. It is our firm
believe that this Artificial Intelligence COVID-19 tracker can be extended to other domains such as the monitoring/tracking of
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in addition to monitoring and tracking pandemics.

Introduction
The COVID-19 disease was declared as a global pandemic1–4 leading to the imposition of restrictions in almost all countries
and states worldwide. Since then, confirmed COVID-19 cases, as well as, reported recoveries and deaths have been tracked and
monitored on several apps and platforms1, 2, 5–7 . These tracking dashboards and apps provide data that can be used to estimate
the rate of spread and other statistics which influences the top-level decisions by governments which may lead to tightening or
easing of these state-wide restrictions and policies6, 8–10 .
The existing COVID-19 trackers2, 6, 11, 12 focus on presenting the COVID-19 case data as reported by countries and territories
only as dashboards and charts ; they and do not perform any predictions or classifications. We also note that no studies or
existing dashboards/trackers employ the use of artificial intelligence to predict the state of COVID-19 for reporting countries
and territories. The method proposed in this study involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, and predictions using one
dimensional deep convolution neural networks. Even though other algorithms exist that can be used in performing feature
extraction and classification of sequence or time-series data, convolution neural networks have been found to be superior13–16
in extracting unique features and patterns in sequences17–19 , images and video data. In fact, deep convolution neural networks
algorithms are behind some of the state-of-the-art detection and tracking algorithms found in everyday images and videos. Here,
1D-CNN is used to extract unique feature identifiers that help predict the true state of countries and territories with respect to
the novel coronavirus disease, uncovering hidden and underlying patterns that might otherwise not be readily noticed.
We propose an artificial intelligence prediction algorithm for the novel coronavirus 2019 stages for countries and reporting
territories based on 1-D deep convolution neural networks trained on confirmed COVID-19 cases. We also propose the concept
of pandemic response curves also based on confirmed COVID-19 cases that provides further insights into the state of each
reporting country or territory. Our main aim is to provide real-time predictions of the stages of COVID-19 that is unbiased or
subjective to human prejudices for all countries and reporting territories.

that though some counties did not have any changes over the month of May, many counties had a negative change, moving
from Stage 3: Winning to Stage 1: Emerging; while others moved in the opposite direction.

Pandemic Response Curves
The Pandemic Response Curves, as shown in Figure 5, provides a visual inspection of the similarities among countries in the
various stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The curve highlights patterns that may have otherwise not been noticeable and
helps clarify unbiasedly where each country or reporting territory is at in the COVID-19 fight. Figure 6 provides some of the
PRC for selected countries in each of the stages. Also, Figure 7 shows the country Ghana PRC compared to other countries’
PRC which recorded their first cases of COVID-19 the same day.

Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic is still ravaging many countries and territories, and has led to strict movement restrictions including
border closures and curfews in many countries. Public gatherings, schools, restaurants and hotels have also been closed as
a results on its unprecedented method of spreading. To help contain the virus, many apps have been developed that track
infections across the globe. Notable amongst them include the John Hopkins CSSE COVID-19 dashboard which has served
as a reference database. To understand further understand hidden insights to all reported cases an artificial intelligence was
developed in this paper. Artificial intelligence is already being applied COVID-19 diagnosis of Chest XRays and CT-Scans20, 21 .
In this paper, we applied AI to the cumulative confirmed coronavirus cases to uncover hidden insights and tell the status of each
country for the month of May.
This begun by preprocessing the data and manually classifying some of the data from the countries (see Table 3. The data
was meant to help the AI be a generalizer of the patterns in the confirmed coronavirus cases. Further, the AI was developed
using Convolution Neural Networks which has been demonstrated to be superior in finding hidden patters in images and videos.
By apply a 1D-CNN, we had hoped for a very efficient pattern finding of the confirmed COVID-19 cases, and used that to
classify the cases into three main groups: Stage 1: Emerging (active rising cases); Stage 2: Controlling (passed peak and active
decline cases); Stage 3: Winning (consistently zero or near zero cases after active decline).
Training the AI on the pre-classified data using the last 100 days yield a 90.5% accuracy. The trained model was then

applied to the whole data for all countries and reporting territories, as well as US counties and territories. The results of this
operation for each country is shown in Figure 1 and Figure 3 for US counties and territories. In addition, tracking the changes
overtime is paramount to helping us understand which countries or states are performing well or otherwise, as such, changes in
the performance of all countries and states were also carried out. These results for the month of May can be seen in Figure 2
and Table 2 for all countries and reporting territories. Similar results for US counties and territories are shown in Figure 4.
From the above results, it can be clearly seen that very few countries, states and US counties are changing their COVID-19
status. There are even instances where some countries or states went from consistently very low or zero cases to actively rising
cases (e.g. Djibouti, Namibia, Zimbabwe).
The AI developed in this paper currently relies on patterns within the cumulative confirmed coronvavirus cases for all
reporting countries and territories. A further investigation into the performance of the AI led to the development of the Pandemic
Response Curves (PRC). The PRC showed that countries with similar COVID-19 status had identical curves. This suggests that
the generalized PRC shapes can be used to classify the status of all countries in an unbiased way. The PRCs for all countries,
highlighting the shapes and similarities of curves (irrespective of population and other metrics) are shown in 5. Selected
countries with kwown COVID-19 status are shown in 6. To further highlight the uniqueness of the PRCs, Ghana (a Stage 1:
Emerging country) was compared to other countries that recorded their first case on the same day. This result is shown in 7 for
Namibia (Stage 3: Winning - see Figure 7a), Seychelles (Stage 2: Controlling - see Figure 7b), and Phillipines (also Stage 1:
Emerging - see Figure 7c). It is hoped that the PRCs be developed further to help automatically classify pandemics.

Methods
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the one compiled daily by the John Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering
(CSSE) and made available to the public via GitHub. Data sources used in compiling the CSSE database include: WHO, CDC,
ECDC, NHC, DXY, 1point3acres, Worldometers.info, the COVID Tracking Project (testing and hospitalizations), and city,
county, state and national public health departments. The time series data consist of daily cumulative cases of COVID-19
from all countries and territories. In addition, data for the United States counties are presented. The time series data begins on
January 22nd, 2020 till date.
Preprocessing
Each country or reporting territory data is normalized with respect to its maximum cumulative cases. The resulting time-series
data is in the range of 0 to 1. To account for the inconsistencies in the data reporting intervals across all countries, the normalized
data time-series is then smoothed with time-windowed simple moving average. The following time-windows were considered:
3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14 day moving averages. Data Labeling: countries and reporting territories that have been found to have been
reported in the media as having reached one of the 3 stages of COVID-19 were manually identified, verified (visually and using
third-party websites like EndCoronavirus.org and tagged with one of the labels: Stage 1 - Cases actively rising; Stage 2 - Cases
have passed peak and begun to actively decline; Stage 3 - Cases consistently zero or near zero after active declining. These
stages were labeled as Stage 1: Emerging, Stage 2: Controlling, Stage 3: Winning.In the most recent version of the model
update 134 countries were manually labelled for AI training and validation. The labelled data was one-hot encoded for the 3
classes; and then split into 0.7:0.3 ratio for training and validation. Pre-classified countries and territories used in the training of

the AI model is shown in Table 3.
1D-CNN COVID-19 AI Model
1D-CNN was used in this AI model with an initial input sequence length of 100; thus using data of the last 100 days for
training, validation and prediction. This layer also had 64 filters, a kernel size of 3 x 3, and ReLu activation unit. This was
followed by another 1D-CNN also with 64 filters, kernel size of 3 x 3, padding, strides of 1, and ReLu activation unit. A
GlobalMaxPooling1D layer was used to flatten the 1D-CNN and the output fed into a 256 Dense layer. A 20% Dropout layer
was then added with ReLu activation unit and then fed to another 128 Dense layer then to the 3 classification output layers
using the Sigmoid activation function.
The model was compiled using the Adam as the optimizer(initial learning rate of 0.001), Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the
loss function, and Accuracy as the metrics. In addition, four callbacks were also setup and used with model during training.
They were: ModelCheckpoint (saved the best models during training), EarlyStopping (terminateg training if no improvement is
being made), ReduceLROnPlateau (adjusts the learning rate if optimizer appears stuck in a local minima), and Tensorboard
(live monitoring of training progress). The model was then repeatedly trained over 2000 epochs and the best performing models
selected for use in the AI Covid Tracker.
