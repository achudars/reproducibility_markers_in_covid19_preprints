Abstract

Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues unabated in many
parts of the world. In the absence of any definite antiviral therapy except some benefit of
remdesivir, there is an ongoing search for effective therapy. Famotidine has been shown to
reduce mortality in hospitalized patients in a few studies. We conducted a systematic review on
the use of famotidine in COVID-19.
Methods: We searched the databases Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL and Medrxiv.
Title/abstract screening, full text screening and data abstraction were carried out in by two
reviewers. Case series, cohort studies and randomized trials were included.
Results: Five studies were eligible for inclusion: all were retrospective cohort or case series.
Low quality evidence suggests a likely clinical benefit for the use of famotidine in decreasing
mortality in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. A meta-analysis of two
cohort studies showed a statistically significant decrease in the composite outcome for death
and intubation with famotidine (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.73).
Conclusion: Further evidence from RCTs is required for famotidine to treat COVID 19.

Keywords: COVID-19, Famotidine, SARS-CoV-2, Systematic review

1. Introduction

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to pose enormous burden on healthcare
system with significant morbidity and mortality. As of 19th September 2020, COVID-19 has
resulted in close to one million deaths worldwide.(1)

There is no proven effective therapy for COVID-19. Remdesivir is the only antiviral that has
shown some clinical benefit but without any reduction in mortality. A globally implemented, safe
vaccination program seems to be the only hopeful long term solution, but is at least 6 months
away. Moreover, the safety and efficacy of any vaccine candidate is yet to be proven. Therefore,
there is a need for effective therapy to reduce mortality.

Famotidine, a H2 receptor antagonist, has been in clinical use for many decades for reducing
gastric acid production in the treatment of peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux disease. It
has an excellent safety profile and being off patent, is cheap. Famotidine has been shown to
bind papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3 chymotrypsin-like protease (Mpro) of SARSCoV-2 in in
silico molecular docking studies.(2) However, the inhibition has not been confirmed. Famotidine
has been shown to reduce mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a few studies.(3–
5) We conducted a systematic review to assess the effect of famotidine on the clinical outcomes
in patients with COVID-19.

Objective
To assess the effectiveness and safety of famotidine in patients with COVID-19.

2.3. Data sources and searches
We searched the following databases for articles published till 20th September 2020: Medline,
Cochrane CENTRAL, Trip database, Pubmed (for articles not yet indexed in Medline) and
Medrxiv and SSRN for pre-print articles.
Editorials, letters, news, reviews, expert opinions, case reports, and studies without original data
were excluded.
Reference lists of retrieved articles and pertinent reviews were also searched for relevant
articles. No language restriction was imposed.
2.4. Selection of studies
Titles and abstracts were screened by two reviewers (RS, PG) independently. Full texts of
articles considered potentially eligible were obtained. The data were abstracted by two
reviewers independently and risk of bias was assessed. Disagreement was resolved by
discussion.
2.5. Data extraction
The following data were extracted: study design, inclusion criteria, number of patients, patient
characteristics, dose, duration and timing of famotidine, co-medications, outcomes and method
of adjustment (for cohort studies and case series).
2.6. Risk of Bias assessment
Risk of bias was assessed using the revised version of Newcastle Ottawa Scale for Cohort
studies and the JBL checklist for case series. (7,8)
2.7. Data synthesis and statistical analysis

We calculated pooled risk ratio and 95% CI using the Generic Inverse Variance approach.
Random effects model was used to conduct the meta-analysis. We carried out the statistical

analysis using Review Manager 5.3. Heterogeneity was assessed using visual inspection of forest
plot and the I2 statistic.
2.8. GRADE
We used GRADE methodology to rate certainty of evidence for outcomes as high, moderate,
low or very low (9).

3. Results

3.1. Study selection
Our search yielded 13 titles and abstracts - all were identified from the electronic database
search. We excluded 8 articles based on a review of the title and abstract, leaving 5 articles for
full review. These five studies were found eligible on full text screening; one of these was a preprint articles that has not been peer reviewed. These 5 studies were included in the systematic
review. (4,5,3,10,11). (Fig 1)

3.2. Study characteristics and estimates reported
The studies included were 3 cohort studies and 2 case series. All studies included patients
hospitalized with COVID-19. Three cohort studies (3,4,11) and one case series (10) included
mostly patients with severe COVID-19, and one case series included patients with mild to
moderate COVID-19.(5)

Efficacy of Famotidine: Descriptive Analysis (Table 1)
The five selected studies included a total of 2643 patients with COVID-19 of whom 312 patients
received famotidine. All except 10 patients were hospitalized with moderate-severe illness. The
dose of famotidine varied from 40-233 mg/day given for 5-21 days. Two cohort studies including

84 and 83 patients who received famotidine with contemporary controls – 1536 and 795 patients
who did not receive famotidine respectively – showed a reduction in mortality: 58% (HR 0.42 95
% CI 0.21-0.85, p=0.02) and 63% (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16-0.86, p=0.02) (5,7). One study that
compared mortality with published series of patients with similar severity showed mortality
reduction of around 26-45% with the use of combined famotidine and cetrizine.(11) One case
series of 25 hospitalized patients with moderate disease showed zero mortality.(10) Another
case series of 10 non-hospitalized patients reported improvement in patient reported
outcomes.(5)

3.3 Risk of Bias assessment

In all three cohort studies, risk of bias was low for selection of exposed and non-exposed
population and assessment of exposure (3, 4, 11). All three cohort studies were assessed to have
low risk of bias from outcome being present at the start of the study. However, adequate
adjustment and assessment of prognostic factors were not carried out by one study (11). Follow
up was adequate for all outcomes in the cohort studies; however, all cohort studies were assessed
as being high risk of bias for co-interventions being dissimilar in the two groups.
Both case series reported consecutive and complete inclusion of participants and the condition
being measured in a standard, reliable way (5, 10). Both also clearly reported the demographics
of participants and clinical information. However, one case series did not report the criteria for
inclusion.

3.4 Pooled effect of Famotidine on composite endpoint of death and intubation
A meta-analysis of two cohort studies showed a statistically significant decrease in the
composite outcome for death and intubation with the use of Famotidine (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.27
to 0.73). There was no heterogeneity in this meta-analysis (I2=0%) (Fig 2)

It is made available under a CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license .

3.5 Certainty in Evidence
The certainty in evidence was assessed as very low using the GRADE approach. The certainty
was rated down for risk of bias, as the included studies were observational studies with possible
residual confounding. (Table 2)

4. Discussion:

The present systematic review found that the use of famotidine was associated with a reduction
in the composite endpoint of death and the requirement of mechanical intubation in patients with
COVID-19. The included studies were retrospective, heterogeneous, with a small sample size
and a variable dose and route of administration of famotidine.
The available data suggest 56% reduction in mortality and requirement of mechanical intubation
among patients treated with famotidine and standard of care (SOC) as compared to those
managed with SOC alone. Cytokine storm plays an important role in the clinical severity and
outcome of COVID-19. However, the exact mechanism of action of famotidine, a H2 receptor
antagonist (H2RA) in modulating the clinical outcome among COVID-19 patients is unclear.
Multiple theoretical hypotheses have been proposed for the effect of famotidine.
Pathophysiologically, histamine plays a role in the clinical symptomatology of COVID-19
including sore throat, cough, diarrhea, myalgia, anosmia, and skin rashes. The available literature
suggests that H2RAs have a modulatory effect on both innate (neutrophils, monocytes,
macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells) and adaptive (CD4+, CD8+, T-reg and B
cells) immune system.(12,13). Famotidine has been shown to bind papain-like protease (PLpro)
and 3 chymotrypsin-like protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 in in silico molecular docking

studies.(2) The mechanism of action specific to SARS-CoV2 appears to be distinct from the acid
suppression mechanism as a recent Korean study reported worse outcomes in patients with active
proton pump inhibitor usage.(14)
Many important clinical issues such as ideal dose, duration, timing of initiating the treatment
after the onset of symptoms, and route of administration of famotidine, which may be associated
with an improvement in the clinical outcome are unclear. The available studies included variable
doses, duration of therapy, and route of administration of famotidine. Freedberg et al. reported
dose varying from 10 mg-40 mg over a median duration of 5.8 days with a cumulative dose of
136 (63-233) mg. In the study by Marther et al, oral administration was reported in 83% of cases
with 20 mg/d in 95% and remaining received 40 mg/d. The cumulative dose was 80 mg (40-160
mg) given over 4 days. Janowitz et al. used a dose ranging from 60 mg/d to 240 mg/day over a
median duration of 11 days (range 5-21 days). An ongoing multicentre RCT (NCT0437020262)
comparing standard of care (SOC) with SOC plus famotidine in the US is administering
intravenous famotidine at a dose of 360 mg/d for 14 days.(15)
The present systematic review and meta-analysis is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to
address the role of famotidine in COVID-19. It incorporates a comprehensive search of three
major databases, as well as pre-print articles. In addition, we used to GRADE approach to rate
the certainty in evidence, thus paying due attention to methodological issues like risk of bias,
imprecision, indirectness and inconsistency.
There are many limitations of the present study which are inherent to the included studies. First,
the studies included in the analysis had a small number of patients treated with famotidine.
Studies were single-center and retrospective observational studies with their associated bias.

Multiple other drugs were used for the management of patients, which could have influenced the
clinical outcomes
In conclusion, the available evidence suggests a potential role of famotidine in the management
of COVID-19, which needs to be explored in randomized controlled trials.

Despite propensity score matching, there was a
difference in age of patients which nearly
approached statistical significance, (famotidine
being younger). Age is the single most important
determinant of outcome in COVID. Therefore it is
possible that Type-2 error may have played a role in
this study and the findings needs confirmation in a
larger sample size.
