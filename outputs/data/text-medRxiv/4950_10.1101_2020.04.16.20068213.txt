Abstract
Background: Navigating the rapidly growing body of scientific literature on the SARSCoV-2 pandemic is challenging and ongoing critical appraisal of this output is essential.
We aimed to collate and summarize all published systematic reviews on the coronavirus
disease (COVID-19).
Methods: Nine databases (Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web of
Sciences, PDQ-Evidence, WHO’s Global Research, LILACS and Epistemonikos) were
searched from December 1, 2019 to March 24, 2020. Systematic reviews analyzing
primary studies of COVID-19 were included. Two authors independently undertook
screening, selection, extraction (data on clinical symptoms, prevalence, pharmacological
and non-pharmacological interventions, diagnostic test assessment, laboratory and
radiological findings) and quality assessment (AMSTAR 2). Meta-analysis on
prevalence of clinical outcomes was performed.
Results: Eighteen systematic reviews were included; one was empty. Using AMSTAR
2, confidence in the results of 13 reviews was rated as “critically low”, one as “low”,
one as “moderate” and two as “high”. Symptoms of COVID-19 were (range values of
point estimates): fever (82–95%), cough with or without sputum (58–72%), dyspnea
(26–59%), myalgia or muscle fatigue (29–51%), sore throat (10–13%), headache (8–
12%) and gastrointestinal complaints (5–9%). Severe symptoms were more common in
men. Elevated C-reactive protein (associated with lymphocytopenia) and lactate
dehydrogenase, and slightly elevated aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, were
commonly described. Thrombocytopenia and elevated levels of procalcitonin and
cardiac troponin I were associated with severe disease. Chest imaging described a
frequent pattern of uni- or bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacity. Only one review
investigated the impact of medication (chloroquine) but found no verifiable clinical
data. All-cause mortality ranged from 0.3% to 14%.
Conclusions: Confidence in the results of most reviews was “critically low”. Future
studies and systematic reviews should adhere to established methodologies. The
majority of included systematic reviews were hampered by imprecise search strategy
and no previous protocol submission.

1. Background
Spread of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of
COVID-19, has been characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization
(WHO) and has triggered an international public health emergency [1]. The virus is
easily transmitted through person-to-person contact and virus contamination of surfaces
or objects [2,3]. As of April 7, 2020, more than 1,359,398 people have been confirmed
to be infected with the virus and over 75,945 people have died as a result of severe
complications of the disease [4]. These numbers are likely to be underestimates, as
countries are unable to test all patients suspected of having the disease due to worldwide
shortages of testing reagents [5]. Estimates put the economic impact of COVID-19 as
surpassing trillions of dollars when global trade, travel and business costs are added to
healthcare and public health expenses [6,7].
Given the novelty of the situation and dozens of daily publications in peer reviewed
journals and preprints, there is an overwhelming avalanche of information from research
articles to sift through. For healthcare professionals and government policy makers, the
ability to sort through relevant research results, in order to clearly identify the most upto-date and reliable information, is essential. Having filtered, accurate information at
their disposal allows stakeholders to make timely decisions regarding the best course of
action. Hence, our aim was to summarize the data from all available systematic reviews
regarding COVID-19 in humans and to rigorously assess the level of confidence that we
can have in this evidence.

2. Methodology

2.1. Protocol and Registration
This overview is a systematic review of systematic reviews. It is an extension of a
recently submitted PROSPERO protocol (CRD42020170623) [8]. The protocol has also
been published on Open Science Framework (OSF) (https://osf.io/6xtyw) for
transparency. It was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement [9]. The methodology
used in this review was adapted from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews
of Interventions and also followed established methodological considerations for
analyzing existing systematic reviews [10,11].

2.2. Ethics
Approval of a research ethics committee was not necessary as the study analyzed only
publicly available articles.

2.3. Eligibility Criteria
Systematic reviews were included if they analyzed primary data from patients infected
with SARS-CoV-2 as confirmed by RT-PCR or another pre-specified diagnostic
technique. Eligible reviews covered all topics related to COVID-19, including, but not
limited to those that reported clinical symptoms, diagnostic methods, therapeutic
interventions, laboratory findings or radiological results. Both full manuscripts and
abbreviated versions, such as letters, were eligible.
No restrictions were imposed on the design of the primary studies included within the
systematic reviews, date of last search, whether or not the review included metaanalyses, or language. A systematic review was defined as a publication where: I. the
search was conducted in at least two databases (at least one being electronic); and II.
detailed description of the methods with explicit inclusion criteria was provided. We
excluded narrative reviews as these are less likely to be replicable and are more prone to
bias.

2.4. Information Sources
Nine databases were searched for eligible records published between December 1 2019
and March 24, 2020: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews via Cochrane Library,
PubMed EMBASE, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
Literature), Web of Sciences, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences
Literature), PDQ-Evidence, WHO’s Global Research on Coronavirus Disease (COVID19), and Epistemonikos.

2.5. Search
The comprehensive search strategy for each database is provided in Appendix 1 and
was designed and conducted in collaboration with an information specialist. All
retrieved records were primarily processed in EndNote, where duplicates were removed,
and records were then imported on Covidence Platform [12]. In addition to database
searches, we screened reference lists of reviews included, after screening records
retrieved via databases.

2.6. Study Selection
All searches, screening of titles and abstracts, as well as record selection, were
performed independently by two investigators using the Covidence Platform [12].
Articles deemed potentially eligible were retrieved for full-text screening by two
independent investigators. Discrepancies in both stages of screening were resolved by
consensus. During screening, records published in languages other than English were
translated by a native/fluent speaker.

2.7. Data Collection Process
We custom designed a data extraction table for the purpose of this study, which was
piloted by two authors independently. Data extraction was performed independently by
two authors. Conflicts were resolved by consensus or by consulting a third researcher.

2.8. Data Items
We extracted the following data: article identification data (authors’ name and journal
of publication), range of period associated with the search, number of databases
searched, population or settings considered, main results and outcomes observed, and
number of participants. From Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA,
USA) we extracted journal rank (quartile) and Journal Impact Factor (JIF).
We categorized the following as primary outcomes: all-cause mortality, need for and
length of mechanical ventilation, length of hospitalization (in days), admission to
intensive care unit (yes/no) and length of stay in intensive care unit.
The following were categorized as exploratory outcomes: diagnostic methods used for
detection of the virus, male to female ratio, clinical symptoms , pharmacological and
non-pharmacological interventions, laboratory findings (full blood count, liver enzymes,
C-reactive protein, d-dimer, albumin, lipid profile, serum electrolytes, blood vitamin
levels, glucose levels, and any other important biomarkers), and radiological findings
(using radiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound).
We also collected data on reporting guidelines and requirements for publication of
systematic reviews and meta-analyses from journal websites where included reviews
were published

2.9. Quality Assessment in Individual Reviews
Two researchers independently assessed the quality of the reviews using the “A
MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2)”, designed to assess
systematic reviews that include both randomized and non-randomized studies.
Adherence to each item was rated as follows: yes, no, partial yes, not applicable or
unclear. We rated overall confidence in the results of the review as “critically low”,
“low”, “moderate” or “high”, according to the AMSTAR 2 guidance based on seven
critical domains defined by AMSTAR 2 authors [13]. If a review did not find any
studies to include (i.e., it was an ˝empty review˝), we scored each individual item, but
we did not conduct summary confidence assessment for such reviews.

One of the included systematic reviews was conducted by some members of this author
team. To prevent risk of bias in assessing methodological quality of this particular
review, it was assessed independently by two authors who did not co-author it.

2.10. Synthesis of Results
For data synthesis, we prepared a table summarizing each systematic review. Graphics
illustrating mortality rate and clinical symptoms were created. We then prepared a
narrative summary of the methods, findings, study strengths and limitations.
For analysis of prevalence of clinical outcomes, we extracted data on the number of
events and total number of patients to perform proportional meta-analysis using
RStudio© software, with the “meta” package (version 4.9-6), using the “metaprop”
function for reviews that did not perform meta-analysis, excluding case studies because
of the absence of variance. For reviews that did not perform meta-analysis, we
presented pooled results of proportions with their respective confidence intervals (95%)
by the inverse variance method with a random-effects model, using the DerSimonianLaird estimator for

τ

2

. We adjusted data using Freeman-Tukey double arcosen

transformation. Confidence intervals were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method
for individual studies. Forest plots were generated showing data from individual
systematic reviews, but results were not pooled because some studies were included in
multiple reviews. We developed the using RStudio© software, with the “metafor”
package (version 2.1-0) and “forest” function.

3. Results
Our search retrieved 1,063 publications, of which 175 were duplicates. Most
publications were discarded after title and abstract analysis (n = 860), 28 were selected
for full text screening and 18 were included in the final analysis (Figure 1) [14-31].
Reference list screening did not retrieve any additional systematic reviews.

3.1. Characteristics of included reviews
Summary features of the 18 systematic reviews are presented in Table S1. Included
reviews were published in 14 different journals. Only four of these journals had specific
requirements for submission of systematic reviews (with or without meta-analysis):
European Journal of Internal Medicine, Journal of Clinical Medicine, Ultrasound in
Obstetrics and Gynecology and Clinical Research in Cardiology. Two journals reported
that they published only invited reviews (Journal of Medical Virology and Clinica
Chimica Acta). Three reviews were published as a letter, and one was labelled as a rapid
review (Table S2).
All the reviews were published in English in a first quartile (Q1) journal, with JIF
(Journal Impact Factor) ranging from 1.692 to 6.062. The 18 systematic reviews
covered more than 120 individual primary studies, involving in total at least 60,000
participants. Ten systematic reviews included meta-analyses. Primary studies included
in the reviews were published between December 2019 and March 18, 2020, and
comprised case reports, case series, cohorts and other observational studies. We did not
find any review with randomized clinical trials. In these reviews, systematic literature
searches were performed from 2019 (entire year) up to March 9, 2020.

3.2. Population and study designs
Most of the reviews analyzed data from patients with COVID-19 who developed
pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or any other correlated
complication. Two reviews were based on in vitro investigations, one review aimed to
evaluate the effectiveness of using surgical masks on preventing transmission of the
virus [25], one review was focused on pediatric patients [23] and one review

investigated COVID-19 in pregnant women (Figure 1) [26]. Most reviews assessed
clinical symptoms, laboratory findings or radiological results.

3.3. Systematic review findings
The summary of findings from individual reviews is shown in Table S2. Overall, allcause mortality ranged from 0.3% to 14% (Figure 2).

3.3.1. Clinical symptoms
Seven

reviews

described

the

main

clinical

manifestations

of

COVID-19

[14,15,22,23,24,28,30]. Three of them provided only a narrative discussion of
symptoms [14,23,24]. Four reviews performed a statistical analysis of the incidence of
different clinical symptoms. Overall, symptoms in patients with COVID-19 were (range
values of the point estimates): fever (82–95%), cough with or without sputum (58–
72%), dyspnea (26– 59%), myalgia or muscle fatigue (29–51%), sore throat (10–13%),
headache (8–12%), gastrointestinal disorders, such as diarrhea, nausea or vomiting
(5.0–9.0%), and others (including, in one study only: dizziness 12.1%) (Figure 3-9).
Three reviews assessed cough with and without sputum together; only one review
assessed sputum production itself (28.5%).

3.3.2. Diagnostic aspects
Three reviews described methodologies, protocols and tools used for establishing the
diagnosis of COVID-19 [14,23,27]. Use of respiratory swabs (nasal or pharyngeal) or
blood specimens to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid using RT-PCR
assays was the most commonly used diagnostic methods mentioned in the included
studies. These diagnostic tests are widely used, but their precise sensitivity and
specificity remain unknown. One review included a Chinese study in which there was
clinical diagnosis with no confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (patients were
diagnosed with COVID-19 if they presented with at least 2 symptoms suggestive of
COVID-19, as well as laboratory and chest radiography abnormalities) [23].

3.3.3 Therapeutic possibilities
Pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions (supportive therapies) used in
the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were reported in five reviews
[16,17,23,24,27]. Most reviews were descriptive, as the original studies did not assess
the impact of therapies. Antivirals have been used empirically for COVID-19 treatment
with the most commonly used being protease inhibitors (lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir),
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (tenofovir), nucleotide analog (remdesivir,
galidesivir, ganciclovir), and neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir). Umifenovir, a
membrane fusion inhibitor, was investigated in several studies [16,24]. Possible
supportive interventions analyzed were different types of oxygen supplementation and
breathing support (invasive or non-invasive ventilation). Use of antibiotics, both
empirically and to treat secondary pneumonia, was reported in some studies. One
review specifically assessed evidence on the efficacy and safety of the anti-malaria drug
chloroquine [17]. It identified 23 ongoing trials investigating the potential of
chloroquine as a therapeutic option for COVID-19, but no verifiable clinical outcomes
data. Use of mesenchymal stem cells, antifungals and glucocorticoids were seldom
described.

3.3.4 Laboratory and radiological findings
Of the 18 reviews included in this overview, eight analyzed laboratory parameters in
patients with COVID-19 [16,19-24,28]. Elevated C-reactive protein levels, associated
with lymphocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, as well as slightly elevated
aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST, ALT) were commonly described. Lippi et
al. assessed the variation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), procalcitonin, and platelet count
between severe COVID-19 patients and non-severe COVID-19 patients [19-21].
Elevated levels of procalcitonin and cTnI were more likely to be associated with a
severe disease course (requiring intensive care unit admission and intubation).
Furthermore, thrombocytopenia was frequently observed in patients with complicated
COVID-19 infections.
Chest imaging (chest radiography and/or computed tomography) features were assessed
in six reviews, all of which described a frequent pattern of local or bilateral multilobar
ground-glass opacity [16,23,24,28-30]. Septal thickening, bronchiectasis, pleural and

cardiac effusions, halo signs and pneumothorax were observed in patients suffering
from COVID-19.

3.4 Quality of evidence in individual systematic reviews
Table S3 shows the detailed results of the quality assessment of 18 systematic reviews,
including assessment of individual items and summary assessment. Overall confidence
in results of reviews was assessed for 17 reviews; for one empty review summary
assessment was not made [25]. Using AMSTAR 2 criteria, confidence in the results of
13 out of 17 reviews with included studies was rated as “critically low”, one as “low”,
one as “moderate” and two as “high”. Common methodological drawbacks were:
omission of prospective protocol submission or publication; use of inappropriate search
strategy: lack of independent and dual literature screening and data-extraction (or
methodology unclear); absence of explanation for heterogeneity among the studies
included; lack of reasons for study exclusion (or rationale unclear).
Risk of bias assessment, based on a clearly reported methodological tool, and quality of
evidence appraisal, in line with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method, were reported only in one review.16
Systematic reviews should perform a risk of bias assessment of included primary
studies, but only five (27.7%) of the included reviews presented a table summarizing
bias. Review authors used a varied number of risk of bias tools. Of these, four reviews
classified studies as being of ˝fair˝ or ˝appropriate quality˝ and one review classified
studies as having a high risk of bias. One review mentioned the risk of bias assessment
in the methodology but did not provide any related analysis. It is worth mentioning that
the reviews used a varied amount of risk of bias tools.

4. Discussion
This overview of systematic reviews, to our knowledge the first of its kind on COVID19, included 18 reviews published up to March 24, 2020, and involving more than
60,000 patients. Ten reviews included meta-analyses. The reviews presented data on
clinical manifestations, laboratory and radiological findings and interventions. We
found no systematic reviews on the utility of diagnostic tests.
Symptoms were reported in seven reviews; the majority of the patents had fever, cough,
dyspnea, myalgia or muscle fatigue and gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea,
nausea or vomiting. Olfactory dysfunction (anosmia or dysosmia) has been reported in
the scientific literature to occur in some patients infected with COVID-19 but this was
not reported in any of the assessed systematic reviews [32,33,34]. During the SARS
outbreak in 2002, there were reports of impairment of sense of smell associated with the
disease [35,36]. Nasal obstruction and post-viral olfactory disorders are possible reasons
for this symptom [37].
The reported mortality rates ranged from 0.3 to 14% in the included reviews. Mortality
estimates are influenced by the transmissibility rate (basic reproduction number),
availability of diagnostic tools, notification policies, asymptomatic presentations of the
disease, resources for disease prevention and control and treatment facilities. Even with
more than 1,359,398 people infected as of April 7, 2020 [4], variability in the mortality
rate fits the pattern of emerging infectious diseases [38]. Furthermore, the reported cases
do not consider asymptomatic cases, mild cases where individuals have not sought
medical treatment, and the fact that many countries have limited access to diagnostic
tests or have implemented testing policies only very recently [39]. The lack of reviews
assessing diagnostic testing (sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of RT-PCT or
immunoglobulin tests), and the preponderance of studies that assessed only
symptomatic individuals, means that considerable imprecision remains around the
calculated mortality rate.
Few reviews included treatment data. Those that did described studies offering a very
low level of evidence: usually small, retrospective studies with very heterogenous
populations. The efficacy of pharmacological interventions therefore remains extremely
unclear. Encouragingly, on April 7, 2020 there were 366 clinical trials for COVID-19
registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, with many pharmacological interventions being tested,
so hopefully this gap in the evidence will be filled soon [40].

Seven reviews analyzed laboratory parameters. Elevated CRP, lactate dehydrogenase,
AST and ALT were commonly reported; elevated cTnI and procalcitonin, and lower
platelet count, appear to be associated with more severe disease. This information may
be useful for clinicians who attend patients suspected of COVID-19 in emergency
services worldwide, for example, to assess which patients need to be reassessed more
frequently. Further research is required to assess their relation to mortality and other
patient outcomes, as well as prognosis, in order to investigate whether they can
contribute to decision-making.
Most systematic reviews scored poorly on the AMSTAR 2 critical appraisal tool for
systematic reviews. Thirteen of the 17 included reviews achieved the lowest rating of
“critically low” in the confidence readers can have in the results of the review. In
contrast, only two reviews achieved the top rating of “high” confidence in the results.
Most of the original studies included in the reviews were case series and case reports,
which impacts on the quality of evidence. This has major implications for clinical
practice and use of these reviews in evidence-based practice and policy. Clinicians,
patients and policymakers can only have the highest confidence in systematic review
findings if high-quality systematic review methodologies are employed. The urgent
need for information during a pandemic does not justify poor quality reporting.
A limitation of our study is that for AMSTAR 2 assessment we relied on information
available in publications; we did not attempt to contact study authors for clarifications
or additional data. Appraisal of methodological quality of three reviews was hindered
because they were published as letters, labelled as rapid communications. As a result,
various details about their review process were not included, leading to AMSTAR 2
questions being answered as not reported and thus to low confidence scores. Full
manuscripts might have provided additional information that could have led to higher
confidence in the results. In other words, low scores could reflect incomplete reporting,
not necessarily low quality review methods. In seeking to make their review available
more rapidly and more concisely, methodological details may have been omitted. This
reflects a general issue during a crisis where speed and completeness must be balanced.
Given that some included reviews scored “high”, the two factors are not mutually
exclusive. However, this requires proper resourcing and commitment to ensure users of
systematic reviews can have high confidence in the results.

Despite this limitation, this overview adds to the current knowledge by providing a
comprehensive summary of all the currently available evidence about COVID-19 from
published systematic reviews. This overview followed strict methodological criteria,
including a comprehensive and sensitive search strategy and a standard tool for
methodological appraisal of systematic reviews. Another potential limitation is that
several authors from this study have contributed to one of the reviews identified. To
reduce risk of any bias, two authors who did not contribute to the review in question
undertook the assessment of its quality and limitations.
Further research is of the utmost importance to assess the impact of antivirals,
chloroquine and other interventions on patient outcomes. Additionally, it is essential to
determine the accuracy of available diagnostic tests. Understanding the role of different
biomarkers to predict clinical outcomes, and whether they could be used in association
with validated scores, such as Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, to
help the decision of choosing patients for scarce intensive care unit beds would be very
useful.

5. Conclusion
In conclusion, by conducting this overview of systematic reviews, we have quantified
the overall incidence of clinical manifestations of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2
and described its more common laboratory and radiological abnormalities. The evidence
is sufficient to guide medical doctors and health-related professionals on the
construction of clinical rationale of non-tested cases, but insufficient to provide any
specific endorsement of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. In
order to fill evidence-based gaps, high quality primary studies should be carried out
initially, so that well-designed systematic reviews can be performed in the future.

The study presents several categories of findings. Epidemiological findings showed that both the immunosuppressed and normal population appear
susceptible to the COVID-19 infection. Biological analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 is similar to β coronaviruses found in bats. The effective reproductive
number of SARS-CoV-2 (2.9) is higher than that of SARS (1.77). Virus transmission originated in Wuhan and from there it spread internationally. It is likely to
be transmitted from human-to-human contact (via droplets or aerosol) as well as via surface contact. Prevention and control consist of isolation, identification and
follow-up of contacts, environmental disinfection, and use of personal protective equipment.
Clinical Symptoms
The most commonly reported clinical symptoms are fever, cough, myalgia or fatigue, pneumonia, and complicated dyspnea, whereas less commonly
reported symptoms include headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, runny nose, and phlegm producing cough. Patients with mild symptoms were reported to recover after
1 week while severe cases were reported to experience progressive respiratory failure due to alveolar damage from the virus, which may lead to death.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of suspected cases used real-time fluorescence (RT-PCR) to detect the positive nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 in sputum, throat swabs, and
secretions of the lower respiratory tract samples.
Bo et al

15

Comorbidities evaluated
The most prevalent comorbidities among confirmed cases of COVID-19 were hypertension (17.1%), cardiocerebrovascular disease (16.4%) and diabetes
(9.7%). Patients with severe disease/in ICU were more likely to have hypertension, cardio-cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes than patients with non-severe
disease/not in ICU; 8.0% of patients with COVID-19 suffered acute cardiac injury. Incidence of myocardial injury was ~13 times higher in patients with severe
disease/in ICU than patients with non-severe disease/not in ICU.

Borges do
Nascimento et al

16

General summary
All-cause mortality was 0.3% (95% CI 0.0%–1.0%). Epidemiological studies showed that mortality was higher in males and elderly patients.
Clinical Symptoms
The incidence of symptoms were shown as following: Fever 82%, (CI) 56%–99%; Cough 61%, 95% CI 39%–81%; Muscle aches and/or fatigue 36%, 95%
CI 18%–55%; Dyspnea 26%, 95% CI 12%–41%; Headache 12%, 95% CI 4%–23%; Sore throat 10%, 95% CI 5%–17% and gastrointestinal symptoms 9%,95%
CI 3%–17%.
Laboratory findings
Laboratory findings revealed lymphopenia (0.93 × 109/L, 95% CI 0.83–1.03 × 109/L and abnormal C-reactive protein (33.72mg/dL, 95% CI 21.54–
45.91mg/dL.
Radiological findings
Radiological findings varied, but mostly described ground-glass opacities and consolidation.
Therapeutic findings
Antivirals (oseltamivir, umifenovir, ganciclovir, ritonavir) were reported as the most commonly used agents. Use of antibiotics was also reported
(vancomycin, azithromycin, meropenem, cefaclor, cefepime and tazobactam). Other medications used were corticosteroids, alpha-interferon, immunoglobulin and
antifungal drugs.

Chloroquine seemed to be effective in limiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, justifying clinical research in patients with COVID-19. However,
clinical use should adhere to the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions framework or be ethically approved as a trial.

Children account for 1–5% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases and they frequently have milder disease than adults; deaths have been extremely rare. Newborn
infants have developed symptomatic COVID-19, but evidence of vertical intrauterine transmission is scarce.
Clinical Symptoms
Clinical characteristics presented mainly as fever and respiratory symptoms, and fewer children seem to have developed severe pneumonia.
Diagnosis
Nasal and pharyngeal swabs or blood analysis are adequate samples for RT-PCR. Sequencing of specimens and clinical diagnosis have been used as
alternative diagnostic approaches.
Laboratory findings
Elevated inflammatory markers were less common in children than adults and lymphocytopenia seemed rare.
Radiological findings
Included studies described ground-glass opacities, local or bilateral patchy shadowing, and halo signs.
Therapeutic findings
Suggested treatment included providing oxygen, inhalations, nutritional support and maintaining fluids and electrolyte balances.
Lupia et al

24

General summary
Most of the patients were male (age range, 8-92). Cardiovascular, digestive and endocrine system diseases were commonly reported.
Clinical Symptoms
Fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia and fatigue were the most common symptoms.
Laboratory findings
Case studies reported leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, slightly elevated AST and ALT, and elevated C-reactive protein.
Radiological findings
Multiple bilateral lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation or bilateral GGOs were most commonly reported in chest CT findings.
Therapeutic findings
Lopinavir, ritonavir, umifenovir and oseltamivir were the most common antivirals used to treat the infection. Supportive intervention (oxygen therapy) was
frequently required by patients. Empirical antibiotics have been described. Steroids were also commonly described.

General information
20.3% (95% CI 10.0–30.6%) of patients required ICU support, 32.8% presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (95% CI 13.7–51.8) and 6.2%
(95% CI 3.1–9.3) with shock. The case fatality rate was 13.9% (95% CI 6.2–21.5%).
Clinical Symptoms
Clinical symptoms presented were fever (88.7%, 95% CI 84.5–92.9%), cough (57.6%, 95% CI 40.8–74.4%) and dyspnea (45.6%, 95% CI 10.9–80.4%).
Laboratory findings
Regarding laboratory findings, decreased albumin (75.8%, 95% CI 30.5–100.0%), high C-reactive protein (58.3%, 95% CI 21.8–94.7%), and high lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) (57.0%, 95% CI 38.0–76.0), lymphopenia (43.1%, 95% CI 18.9–67.3), and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (41.8%, 95% CI
0.0–92.8), were the most common laboratory results.
Radiological findings
Results showed bilateral pneumonia, with associated ground-glass opacities.

Salehi et al

29

Radiological findings
A correlation was found between CT findings and disease severity and mortality. In severely ill patients, the most commonly reported CT findings were
bilateral and multilobar involvement and subsegmental consolidative opacities. ARDS was the most common indication for transfer to the ICU, with the majority
of COVID-19 mortalities occurring among patients with ARDS in the ICU.

Sun et al
