The Czech Republic (or Czechia) is facing the second wave of COVID-19 epidemic, with the rate of growth in the number of confirmed cases (among) the
highest in Europe. Learning from the spring first wave, when many countries
implemented interventions that effectively stopped national economics (i.e.,
a form of lockdown), political representations are now unwilling to do that
again, at least until really necessary. Therefore, it is necessary to look back
and assess efficiency of each of the first wave restrictions, so that interventions can now be more finely tuned. We develop an age-structured model
of COVID-19 epidemic, distinguish several types of contact, and divide the
population into 206 counties. We calibrate the model by sociological and
population movement data and use it to analyze the first wave of COVID-19
epidemic in Czechia, through assessing effects of applied restrictions as well
as exploring functionality of alternative intervention schemes that were discussed later. To harness various sources of uncertainty in our input data, we
apply the Approximate Bayesian Computation framework. We found that (1)

personal protective measures as face masks and increased hygiene are more
effective than reducing contacts, (2) delaying the lockdown by four days led
to twice more confirmed cases, (3) implementing personal protection and effective testing as early as possible is a priority, and (4) tracing and quarantine
or just local lockdowns can effectively compensate for any global lockdown if

It is about eight months when COVID-19 infection entered the Czech Republic. The
epidemic started and was initially fueled by Czech citizens returning from the popular
alpine ski resorts of Italy and Austria. The first three confirmed cases arose on March 1,
2020. Population-wide interventions began on March 11, 2020, with closing schools, which
were soon followed by travelling restrictions, closing of restaurants, sports and cultural
facilities, and shops (with exceptions), as well as duty to wear face masks, use disinfection
and keep at least 2 m inter-personal distance on public (Table 1). In May 2020, the epidemiological situation in Czechia has stabilized, and the government started to gradually
relax the restrictions implemented during the lockdown. Contrary to dramatic epidemics
in many European countries, Czechia appeared to face a relatively mild first wave. In the
summer months, only low infection incidence was reported, and life returned nearly to
its pre-pandemic state (in view of school vacations and related national and international
holidays). All started to change by the end of August 2020 when the number of confirmed
cases started to rise again, this time affecting mainly younger age cohorts. Still, not much
was done, presumably because of low numbers of hospitalized and dead. This has changed
dramatically during September 2020, and as of late October 2020, the Czech Republic
faces an unprecedented second wave, accompanied with a worrying increase in the numbers of hospitalized, including those in serious conditions. An overview of the COVID-19
epidemic in Czechia is provided on the web pages of the Ministry of Health of the Czech
Republic (onemocneni-aktualne.mzcr.cz/covid-19).

Learning from the spring lockdown, especially as regards its negative economic impacts,
governments all over the world are now not so eager to implement intense population-wide
restrictions (i.e., a form of lockdown) again. Clearly, even if implemented again, this state

could not be kept forever, as it does not only dive economics, but also negatively affects
mental state of people. For example, an increase in divorce rate was reported in Wuhan,
China, after quite stringent restrictions were eventually alleviated there (19). Therefore,
it is necessary to look back and assess effectiveness of the particular interventions adopted
during the spring lockdown. Moreover, some other measures such as tracing and quarantining recent contacts of confirmed cases or implementing a geographically restricted
lockdown were later applied or considered, and it is useful to look also at what might
happen if they were alternatively implemented in the early phases of epidemic.
Here we develop a detailed compartmental model to (i) reproduce the initial phase and
lockdown period of COVID-19 epidemic in the Czech Republic, accounting for all implemented interventions, (ii) conduct a retrospective analysis of those interventions, and (iii)
assess potential effects of alternative strategies proposed during the first wave or later.
We structure our model by age, type of inter-individual contacts and space, thus allowing
to explore and compare relative efficiency of a number of realistic intervention strategies
that can be incorporated and timed explicitly (Methods). It contains a core epidemic
layer, hospital layer, quarantine layer, and testing layer. In our model, we integrate public
health data on the first wave in Czechia, results of sociological surveys performed before
and during the first wave, real-time population movement data, and epidemiological parameters estimated from both public health and published data. To account for all these
sources of information and their uncertainty, we use an Approximate Bayesian Computation framework based on massive super-computing simulations; this allows us to assess
credibility intervals of our results given up-to-date knowledge on COVID-19 (Methods).

Initial phase and lockdown period as baseline scenario
To reach the goals we outline above, we first focus on the initial phase of epidemic and
subsequent lockdown, spanning the period between 1 February 2020 and 7 May 2020. The
first three cases of the COVID-19 epidemic in the Czech Republic were reported on March
1, 2020. Population-wide interventions soon followed (Table 1). Till May 7, the restriction
scheme was clear, there were no unreported local interventions, and the numbers of confirmed cases were high enough to match assumptions of our population model. Therefore,
we use 1 February 2020 as our arbitrary starting date to cover a real epidemic beginning
(the first three cases apparently got infected and showed symptoms before March 1 and
some undetected asymptomatic cases were certainly imported, too) and 7 May 2020 as a
date until which all those interventions apply. Based on the age-specific cumulative numbers of confirmed cases from this period, we infer uncertain epidemiological parameters
(i.e., calibrate our model) and use the resulting setup as the baseline state for our retrospective analyses. The mechanistic character of our model allows for exact implementation
of specific dates of intervention initiation (and relaxation), and for setting up factors that
reflect impacts of these interventions on epidemiological as well as behavioral parameters

our model contains. Where possible, we base these factors on results of sociological surveys
on behavioral responses before and during the lockdown (Methods, Fig. 1).
We use the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), a technique used to estimate
parameters of complex models in genomics and other biological disciplines (1, 6), including
epidemic modeling (2, 17), to integrate all our data sources, including their uncertainty.
More specifically, using a high performance computer, we simulated 100,000 realizations of
epidemic dynamics from the model, using parameter values randomly generated from prior
distributions based on public health data in Czechia or literature review (Methods; blue
distribution in Fig. 2A). Subsequently, we used a rejection-sampling algorithm to select
0.1% of model realizations (100) that best matched the observed age-specific cumulative
numbers of confirmed cases (Fig. 2B). The parameters used to generate these selected
realizations form an outer estimate of Bayesian posterior distribution of parameter values
(1, 6) (red distribution in Fig. 2A).
The distributions of parameter values corresponding to selected simulation runs thus possess residual uncertainty in the parameters after the model is confronted with the observed
data (1, 6). We may think of the individual accepted parameter sets as different worlds

our observations of which are compatible with real observations, and we can study the
epidemic of COVID-19 in any of these worlds or in all of them simultaneously (Methods).
As Figs 2B and 3 indicate, our model is able to grasp dynamics beyond the COVID-19
epidemic in Czechia. We emphasize that while reasonably fitting the numbers of confirmed
cases in any age cohort (Fig. 3) means reasonable fit of the total number of confirmed cases
(Fig. 2B), the converse is not true (not shown). Therefore, we think that age-structured
models should always be calibrated on age-structured data, simply to be able assess effects
of interventions that are often targeted to specific age cohort.

Retrospective analysis
A lot of epidemiological models developed to describe the COVID-19 epidemic have been
prospective and were not calibrated on real observations, providing qualitative predictions
forward in time (8, 10, 11). Another large group of models are statistical in nature, attempting to retrospectively analyze an effect of applied interventions right from observed
data (4, 9). Our model in a sense bridges these two groups of models, providing a mechanistic description of the epidemic, enabling freely switch interventions on and off and
modify their intensity, while at the same time being calibrated on a robust set of observed
data.
We consider the following scenarios that we are going to compare with the baseline one

(more detailed description of each scenario follows):
R1 Lockdown interventions adopted four days before their actual date
R2 Lockdown interventions adopted two days before their actual date
R3 Lockdown interventions adopted two days after their actual date
R4 Lockdown interventions adopted four days after their actual date
R5 No contact reduction assumed, degree of personal protection as observed
R6 Contact reduction as observed, no personal protection assumed
R7 Dates of imposing protective measures and closing schools plus recommending home
office swapped
R8 Testing in March assumed as effective as later in April and May
R9 Tracing and quarantine applied since April 1, 2020
R10 Local lockdowns applied since April 1, 2020
All these scenarios work with posterior parameter sets identified above; in each of the 100
selected posterior sets a change in policy is made and a corresponding model is run. An
absolute impact of each scenario is examined, as well as its relative impact with respect
to the baseline scenario (Methods).
Experience from many countries demonstrates that one of the most important issues is
timing of interventions; every single day of postponing them or of implementing them
earlier counts (we are of course aware of other than epidemiological factors that enter the
stakeholders’ decision process, but we focus just on epidemiology in this study). Indeed,
establishing every single intervention two or four days earlier or later produces significant
differences in the number of confirmed cases by 7 May 2020. (Figs 4 and 5). Thus, every
day counts in the rate of responding to the incipient epidemic. As we show below, delay
of four days in implementing lockdown roughly doubles the number of confirmed cases by
May 7.
The scenario R5 is inspired by a highly discussed issue of whether leave schools open or
rather close them (4, 21, 14). Since leaving schools open means in our model on average
nearly 5 child-child contacts more per day, we extend the commonly assumed scenario of
closing schools to asking more generally whether personal protection itself would suffice,
without limiting any type of contact in the population. Not limiting contacts worsens the
epidemic about five times (Fig. 6A). On the other hand, keeping the amount of contacts
limited as observed, but without any personal protection, produces twenty times more
confirmed cases on average by May 7 (scenario R6, Fig. 6B). Model results are thus less

sensitive to changes in contact structure than to changes in the factor reducing infection
transmission due to protective measures (face masks, increased hygiene, interpersonal
distance).
The art of responding to any epidemic is not only in setting up the right restrictions and
setting up them in time, but also setting them in an optimal order or implementing them
as effectively as possible. With regard to our above finding that personal protection measures in the form of wearing face masks, using hand disinfection and keeping interpersonal
distance appears more effective than just limiting social contacts, we suggest that implementing the former as early as possible is more effective (Fig. 7A). Similarly, any decrease
in the delay related to testing symptomatic cases weakens the epidemic spread (Fig. 7B).
Effects of two scenarios that have been used or considered to compensate an expected
increase in the number of confirmed cases when lockdown was relaxed are now examined.

down when a given threshold in the number of new cases per 100,000 inhabitants during
the last seven days is exceeded in any specific county. Either intervention is implemented
since the beginning of epidemic. Both scenarios suggest that both tracing and quarantine
and only local lockdowns can successfully replace any global lockdown if intensive efficient
enough (Fig. 8); no contact limitation was imposed in tracing and quarantine scenario and
in counties not under local lockdown, while the degree of personal protection remained as
under global lockdown.
More quantitative way of assessing the effect of (not) implementing an intervention is
to calculate effects of an intervention relative to the baseline (i.e., general lockdown)
scenario when both simulations come from respective worlds (Methods; Fig. 9. Obviously,
intervening as soon as possible, sequencing the involved restrictions optimally and testing
efficiently is by far a preferred strategy. We show that every four days of delaying the
interventions double the number of confirmed cases by the end of period we follow, that
personal protective measures are more efficient than reducing the number of contacts and
that tracing and quarantine or just local lockdowns may compensate for relaxation, but
only if some measures still remain in effect. These conclusions may seem trivial, and
they actually are. The advantage of modeling epidemics is in providing some quantitative
assessment of what intensity of interventions is not enough and which may hopefully
suffice.

Discussion
We developed a mathematical model to analyze the spring first wave of COVID-19 in the
Czech Republic. The model allows decoupling of protective as opposed to contact-limiting
measures, setting up dates of implementing and relaxing of various types of interventions,
and structures the population by age (three age cohorts: children, adults and seniors),
type of contact (four types: at home, at school, in work and within community) and space
(206 counties). Moreover, we included tracing and quarantining contacts of confirmed
individuals and calibrated the model to the cumulative number of confirmed cases (so we
needed a testing layer that modeled transition from real numbers of cases to the observed
ones). We found that (1) personal protective measures as face masks and increased hygiene
are more effective than reducing contacts, (2) delaying the lockdown by four days led to
twice more confirmed cases, (3) implementing personal protection and effective testing
as early as possible is a priority, and (4) tracing and quarantine or just local lockdowns
can effectively compensate for any global lockdown if the numbers of confirmed cases not
exceedingly high.
Two types of models have generally been used to get an insight into the effects of nonpharmaceutical interventions in controlling COVID-19 epidemics. One of these groups,
exemplified by Davies et al. (8), Domenico et al. (10), Ferguson et al. (11), contains
mechanistic prospective models that aim at predicting a future course of epidemics, which

use parameter values found in the literature, often coming from different parts of the world,
and are not calibrated on real observations in a given country. Another group of models,
exemplified by Brauner et al. (4), Dehning et al. (9), are statistical in nature, attempt
to retrospectively analyze an effect of applied interventions right from the observed data,
and often analyze many countries at once. Our model in a sense bridges these two groups
of models. It provide a mechanistic description of the epidemic, enables freely switch
interventions on and off and modify their intensity, while is at the same time calibrated
on a robust set of observed data from the Czech Republic. Hence, it can be used to
make prospective predictions, but can also look back and retrospectively analyze an effect
of interventions applied in the past. One of its unique features is a use of sociological
data to quantify a degree of compliance of established interventions, that is, a degree of
contact limitation in various environments as well as a degree of compliance of obeying
required protective measures (wearing face masks, using disinfection, keeping interpersonal
distance).
Another unique feature of our model is how it deals with uncertainty. Although a deterministic model, it is calibrated via a stochastic technique called Approximate Bayesian
Computation (1, 6) applied to model parameters least known from either the literature
or data we have for the Czech Republic epidemic. In this way, we generate a number
of posterior parameter sets (or loosely said different hidden worlds) that all more or less
result in observations we make on the numbers of confirmed cases in any of the three age
cohorts, and ask how in any of these world the observations would look like if our responsive strategies change. Moreover, this technique deals with uncertainty in the model
structure; the estimated parameters need not always be biology realistic (even if we try to
reflect current knowledge in the respective priors), but if behavior of a strategy relative
to the baseline scenario demonstrates consistent behavior across different worlds, we may
have an increased confidence in the actual effect, since even if worlds are different they
demonstrate similar relative impacts.
Why do we apply our model just to Czechia and not to a wider set of countries? There
are several reasons for that. First, the adopted detail of our model requires that: we do
not have sufficient data for other countries (such as sociological data on behavior during
epidemics, moving patterns of population). But also, other countries generally differ in a
number of things, such as school system, community structure, structure of households,
health system, testing strategy, etc. Nevertheless, there is no country-specific feature in
the model structure, so once properly parameterized it can easily be used to any country
affected by COVID-19.
An issue commonly discussed in both country-specific studies (8) and studies spanning
more countries (4), is whether to leave schools open or to close them. Closing schools
turned to be among the first interventions in many countries (4), presumably because of
governmental pandemic plans prepared tailored to influenza. This issue, causing quarrels
already 100 years back during the Spanish influenza pandemic, still persists and studies

of COVID-19 can also be divided into those that claim relatively small effect (8, 14, 21)
and those that rank closing schools among the most important interventions (4, and references therein). We do not follow this line of inquiry, mainly because it makes no sense
to single out this specific intervention. Closing school requires parents of small pupils to
remain home and thus affects home and work contacts, while large pupils tend to gather
in shopping malls and other public places, affecting contacts within a broader community
(this is one of the things that may differ among countries). To prevent just this shift
of contacts elsewhere one needs to implement broader set of interventions beyond just
closing schools, which is exactly what happened in Czechia. Shopping malls were closed
shortly after in spring, and open wi-fi signal has been switched there now. Therefore,
although schools can be closed in our model without affecting the other types of contact,
we examined whether limiting contacts at large was more or less effective than personal
protective measures, showing tat the latter is what should always be enforced first. Interestingly, Brauner et al. (4) rank wearing masks among interventions that decreased
reproductive number relatively less than closing schools and businesses. Brauner et al. (4)
claimed that a probable reason for this conclusion was that wearing face masks was among
the last interventions implemented during lockdown in many countries, including Czechia
(interestingly, many other countries enforced wearing face masks just following Czechia,
seeing that it apparently works, which after some time admitted also WHO). We showed
that implementing wearing face masks, together with other protective measures, among
the earliest interventions would prevent many from containing infection during the spring
first wave. On the contrary, the prospective study of Ferguson et al. (11) is more in line
with our findings: although not fitted to any time series data, the authors find much less
pronounced effect of closing schools than of implementing social distancing measures.
Western civilization appears to be not much obedient in adherence to guidelines. An
indirect indication of this is a much severe second wave in Europe compared to many
South-Asian countries, even those with democratic governments. Any kind of lockdown
is always a displeasing state that clashes with our perception of freedom. However, the
lockdown is usually the last attempt to get an epidemic under control, and it turns out
that is in not often necessary if we effectively adhere to less severe restrictions that usually
come first. We suggest that a combination of timely application of protective measures
and somewhat limited contacts, effective testing and contact tracing, possibly couples with
local lockdowns, is apparently an optimal strategy. This may sound trivial. Mathematical models are needed to say how much is not enough, but also how much is probably
unnecessarily much.

Methods
Here we provide a description of our mathematical model, structured by age, type of
contact and space. The model consists of four layers: a core epidemic layer, observation

layer, quarantine layer, and hospital layer. Although we do not report results regarding
hospitals and deaths in this study, due to low number of affected people during the first
epidemic wave, for completeness we give description of the hospital layer here. We first
describe unstructured versions of all layers. Their extensions to age, various types of
contact, and space then follow.

Epidemic layer
Our core epidemic model is a variant of the classic SEIR model. Due to contacts with
infectious individuals, susceptible individuals (S) may become exposed (E), that is, infected but not yet infectious (the process of infection transmission is described below).
The exposed individuals then become asymptomatic for the whole course of infection (In ,
with probability 1 − pS ) or presymptomatic for just a short period of time before becoming symptomatic (Ia , with probability pS ). The Ia individuals later become symptomatic,
reducing their contacts with others by the factor rC . We assume that a proportion pT of
individuals that become symptomatic decide to undergo testing for the presence of SARSCoV-2 (Is ). They either contact their general practitioner and are sent for testing or go
and pay by themselves. On the contrary, the proportion 1 − pT of symptomatic individuals (most likely those with very mild symptoms) decide not to undergo testing and rather
stay at home (Ih ). The In , Is and Ih individuals then recover (R). Since in the Czech
Republic, deaths attributed to COVID-19 did not generally occur outside hospitals, we
do not consider deaths in the core epidemic layer, but only in the hospital layer described
below. Deaths outside hospitals were an important issue in countries heavily hit by the
COVID-19 spring wave where hospital capacities were soon depleted.
Considering discrete time, with one time step corresponding to one day, our core epidemic
model consists of the system of six equations:
S[t + 1] = S[t] − λ S[t] − L[t − 8]/pS ,
E[t + 1] = E[t] + λ S[t] − σ E[t] + L[t − 8]/pS ,
In [t + 1] = In [t] + (1 − pS ) σ E[t] − γn In [t],
Ia [t + 1] = Ia [t] + pS σ E[t] − ξ Ia [t],

(1)

Is [t + 1] = Is [t] + pT ξ Ia [t] − γs Is [t],
Ih [t + 1] = Ih [t] + (1 − pT ) ξ Ia [t] − γs Ih [t],
R[t + 1] = R[t] + γs Ih [t] + γs Is [t] + γn In [t].
The hitherto unexplained variable L[t] accounts for the imported COVID-19 cases from
abroad, mostly from Italy and Austria. A list of all confirmed (symptomatic) imported
cases is available at onemocneni-aktualne.mzcr.cz/covid-19. However, we do not introduce such imported cases as symptomatic. We assume they came earlier as exposed,
and introduce them before they were actually tested positive (to account for delay between

exposition and confirmation). Moreover, to account for the likely situation that some of
the imported cases remained undetected as being asymptomatic for the whole course of
infection, we divide the number of known imported cased by pS , the probability of exposed
individuals eventually becoming symptomatic.
The force of infection λ in the model (1) sums contributions from all infectious classes,
that is, In , Ia , Is , and Ih :
λ=βC

rβ In [t] + rβ Ia [t] + rC Is [t] + rC Ih [t]
.
N [t]

(2)

Here, β is the probability of infection transmission upon contact between susceptible and
infectious individuals, C is the contact rate (the mean number of other individuals an
individual has an effective contact with per day), rβ is a factor reducing the infection
transmission probability for an asymptomatic individual relative to a symptomatic one,
rC is a factor reducing the contact rate of a symptomatic individual relative to an asymptomatic one (having symptoms should force an individual to reduce contacts with others),
and N [t] is the total population size at time t. The remaining model parameters, σ, ξ,
γs and γn , represent probabilities at which individuals leave the respective model classes.
They are related to the mean duration an individual spends in each such class (Table 7),
which in turn is defined and set in Table 6. All model variables are summarized in Table
5. We emphasize here that the calculation of λ will change (be expanded) further in the
text, as we extend our model description.

Observation layer
We assume that the period from the onset of symptoms, through sampling and subsequent
processing, up to infection confirmation and case isolation is assumed to take dT days
(testing delay). The length of this period was found to decrease during the course of
epidemic as all involved steps were performed more efficiently. The infectious individuals
are assumed always tested positive (we do not assume false negatives). We thus have
equation for Is redefined as:
Is [t + 1] = Is [t] + pT ξ Ia [t] − η[t] Is [t] − γs Is [t],

(3)

where η = 1 − exp(−1/dT ) is the testing rate.
The number of newly positively tested symptomatic individuals at day t thus equals
η[t] Is [t]. Therefore, the total number of positively tested symptomatic individuals yet
to be reported (B) is
B[t + 1] = B[t] + η[t] Is [t] − κ[t] B[t],
(4)
where κ is a (also possibly time-varying) publication rate. This rate is calculated as κ = 1−
exp(−1/dP ), where dP is the period from case confirmation to case reporting (publication

delay). The total number of reported positively tested symptomatic individuals (K) is
therefore
K[t + 1] = K[t] + κ[t] B[t].
(5)
This simple testing procedure, assuming that all symptomatic individuals are at any time
t tested and reported at the same rate, links the real number of symptomatic individuals
to the number of reported positively tested symptomatic individuals, and requires two
(possibly time-varying) parameters dT and dP (Table 2).

Hospital layer
A proportion pH of positively tested individuals (those with relatively severe symptoms)
needs hospitalization. The remaining proportion 1 − pH of positively tested individuals
(those that have only mild symptoms) are sent home to stay isolated (Iz ) until recovery.
Hence, we add a new equation
Iz [t + 1] = Iz [t] + (1 − pH ) η[t] Is [t] − γs Iz [t].

A scheme showing structure of the model involving all elements defined up to now is
sketched in Fig. 10.
Hospitalized individuals may follow several pathways, depending on the number of hospital states one considers. Whereas most published models have not consider a class of
hospitalized individuals (15), the others considered one to three hospital states: one to
cover all hospitalized individuals (12), two to distinguish between common hospital beds
and ICUs (10), and three to further detach ICU patients that need lung ventilators or
ECMOs (23).
We consider one hospital state, for which we need to introduce three parameters: the
proportion pD of hospitalized individuals that eventually die, mean duration from hospital admission to death dHD , and mean duration from hospital admission to recovery dHR
(Table 3). We thus introduce two hospital classes, HD and HR , representing the hospitalized individuals that eventually die or recover, respectively, and compose the following

now needs another modification: N [t] in its denominator is now the total population size
at time t except those individuals that have already died (D), are isolated at home (Iz ), or
are hospitalized (HD and HR ). These four classes are expected not to transmit infection
to others.

Quarantine layer
Quarantine is ordered to anyone that has been traced as having a recent (epidemiologically
relevant) contact with a positively tested individual. At time t, there is η[t] Is [t] positively
tested individuals. We assume it takes dI days from identifying an infectious individual
to quarantining her or his contacts (quarantine delay; dI = 0 means all traced contacts

are quarantined on the same day an individual is positively tested for SARS-CoV-2). So,
to find the number of contacts traced and quarantined at time t we need to start with
individuals that were tested positively at time t − dI , which is η[t − dI ] Is [t − dI ].
We assume that dB + 1 is the number of days we look back for the contacts of a positively
tested individual. On any single day from t − dI to t − dI − dB , there is C actual contacts
with others. We assume that a proportion Φ of the actual contacts are successfully traced
(successful tracing ratio; Φ = 1 means all recent contacts are traced). Therefore, there is
overall η[t − dI ] Is [t − dI ]Φ C traced contacts of individuals positively tested at time t − dI
with the other individuals in the population. This number of contacts is further reduced
by the factor rC for the days the positively tested individuals have been symptomatic.
Due to quarantine delay, an epidemiological status of a contact of a positively tested
individual may change between the moments of contact and quarantine. We assume that
the successfully traced contacts are only from the classes S, E, Ia , In , Ih and R, and are
initially proportionally distributed among these, with the class Ih however weighted by
rC (mobility reduction due to presence of symptoms). The resulting initial numbers of
traced individuals are denoted as WS [0], WE [0], WIa [0], WIn [0], WIh [0] and WR [0]. We
follow the epidemiological status of any such individual in time. In particular, any of the
S individuals selected as contacts becomes infected during the contact with a positively
tested individual with probability β when the latter is symptomatic and with probability
rβ β when it is asymptomatic. All traced individuals actually undergo a short separate
epidemic that runs for dI + w time steps, where w goes from 0 to dB , with infection
transmission applicable only in the first time step:
WS [τ + 1] = WS [τ ] − [rβ ]β WS [τ ],
WE [τ + 1] = WE [τ ] + [rβ ]β WS [τ ] − σ WE [τ ],
WIn [τ + 1] = WIn [τ ] + (1 − pS ) σ WE [τ ] − γn WIn [τ ],
WIa [τ + 1] = WIa [τ ] + pS σ WE [τ ] − ξ WIa [τ ],

(10)

WIh [τ + 1] = WIh [τ ] + (1 − pT ) ξ WIa [τ ] − γs WIh [τ ],
WR [τ + 1] = WR [τ ] + γs WIh [τ ] + γn WIn [τ ],
where we use the time index τ instead of t not to mix it with the main system of equations.

Thus calculated numbers of individuals WS [t], WE [t], WIa [t], WIn [t], WIh [t] then go to the
respective classes QS , QE , QIa , QIn , QIh , respectively.
Consideration of the quarantine layer requires modification of the force of infection. The
eventual form thus is:
rβ In [t] + rβ Ia [t] + rC Is [t] + rC Ih [t] + rCQ rβ QIn [t] + rCQ rβ QIa [t] + rCQ QIh [t]
.
N [t]
(11)
Moreover, the quarantined exposed individuals QE become QIn when asymptomatic for
the whole course of infection or QIa when eventually symptomatic. The QIa then either
go to Is with probability pT or to QIh with probability 1 − pT . The force of infection by
quarantined individuals is reduced by a factor rCQ (due to a reduction in their contact
rate).

λ=βC

Denoting by α the rate at which individuals sent to quarantine as S (hence to class QS )
return to the class S if not infected in the meantime (in which case they would go to QE ),
the equations related to quarantine or containing a quarantine class eventually are:
S[t + 1] = S[t] − λ S[t] + α QS [t] − L[t + 8]/pS [t] − WS [t],
E[t + 1] = E[t] + λ S[t] − σ E[t] + L[t + 8]/pS [t] − WE [t],
In [t + 1] = In [t] + (1 − pS ) σ E[t] − γn In [t] − WIn [t],
Ia [t + 1] = Ia [t] + pS σ E[t] − ξ Ia [t] − WIa [t],
Ih [t + 1] = Ih [t] + (1 − pT ) ξ Ia [t] − γs Ih [t] − WIh [t],
QS [t + 1] = QS [t] − rCQ λ QS [t] − α QS [t] + WS [t],
QE [t + 1] = QE [t] + rCQ λ QS [t] − σ QE [t] + WE [t],

(12)

QIn [t + 1] = QIn [t] + (1 − pS ) σ QE [t] − γn QIn [t] + WIn [t],
QIa [t + 1] = QIa [t] + pS σ QE [t] − ξ QIa [t] + WIa [t],
QIh [t + 1] = QIh [t] + (1 − pT ) ξ QIa [t] − γs QIh [t] + WIh [t],
Is [t + 1] = Is [t] + pT ξ Ia [t] + pT ξ QIa [t] − η[t] Is [t] − γs Is [t],
R[t + 1] = R[t] + . . . + γn QIn [t] + γs QIh [t].
Age structure
As SARS-CoV-2 is known to differently impact children, adults and seniors (8), we distinguish three major age classes: 0-19 years (children), 20-64 years (adults), and 65+ years
(seniors). These classes interact via the force of infection: infectious individuals of any age
classes contribute to the force of infection of a susceptible individual of any age class. Both
the probability of infection transmission upon contact β and daily number of contacts C
are thus now 3 × 3 matrices, referred to below as the transmission matrix and contact
matrix, respectively.

To account for this differential impact, we assume that the elements of the transmission
matrix are not identical yet rather β has the following structure:


β1 β2 β2


(13)
β =  β2 β3 β4  ,
β2 β4 β5
where β1 is a transmission probability between two children, β2 is a transmission probability between children and adults or seniors, β3 is a transmission probability between two
adults, β4 is a transmission probability between seniors and adults, and β5 is a transmission probability between seniors. We estimate parameters β1 , β2 , β3 , β4 , and β5 by fitting
our model to age-specific data on the cumulative number of confirmed cases (see below).
In addition to modeling age-specificity of COVID-19, having β as a 3 × 3 matrix allows
for considering interventions that may impact various of its elements differently.
The contact matrix C describes the mean number of other individuals of any age cohort
that an individual of an age cohort meets per day. Prem et al. (20) published such a
contact matrix for 152 countries, including the Czech Republic. Moreover, they expressed
it as a sum of four specific contact matrices describing daily numbers of contacts at home
(CH ), school (CS ), work (CW ), and of other types of contact (CO ):

In these matrices, columns represent those that find, while rows those that are contacted.
We exploit this division when defining and exploring impacts of various realistic intervention strategies.
Once infected, individuals of each age cohort proceed independently of individuals of other
age cohorts (except quarantine, where we trace contacts to a positively tested individual
that are from any age cohort). Also, we formally treat most model parameters as agespecific, with the same value for each age cohort if age-specific information is not available.
Finally, since we know age of any imported COVID-19 case in the initial phase of epidemic,
we assign each such case to the appropriate age cohort.

Spatial structure
Spreading of any pathogen in a population, including current epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, has
a spatial component. To explore this process, we split the Czech Republic geographically

into well-defined 206 counties. For each county, the population size and its distribution
into the above-defined three age classes is known (Czech Statistical Office, www.czso.cz/
csu/czso/home). Moreover, we compose and use a 206 × 206 mobility matrix that gives
mean daily mobility patterns of individuals between all pairs of those counties (proportions
of individuals travelling per day from a county to another).
Only individuals from the classes S, E, Ia , In , and R are allowed to travel in our model,
unless interventions are implemented to restrict their movement, too (see the section on
interventions below). At each time step (one day), our age-structured model is first run
(independently) in each county, and then the mobility matrix is applied to the updated
county populations. Regarding the imported cases in the initial phase of epidemic, we
have information about the broader region in the Czech Republic each case comes from,
so we assign a random county from the corresponding region to each such case.
The mobility matrix was constructed by averaging mobility patterns obtained from a
telecommunication company across two weeks. Two such matrices were used, one representing the normal state using data from January 2020, and the other representing the
lockdown state using data from the second half of March 2020. Both matrices were recalculated to account for the company’s market share. Furthermore, movement matrices
were adjusted to account for average visiting time of 6 hours, i.e. all movement intensities
were divided by 4. Due to the lack of age-specific data, these matrices were assumed
identical for all three age classes.

Sociological data
Several scenarios for intervention implementation and relaxation are tested for their effect
on the course of epidemic in the Czech Republic. Our baseline scenario considers all
interventions that were in effect during lockdown established during March 2020 (Table
1). In modeling the various interventions, we exploit a division of the contact matrix
C into four matrices describing contacts at home (CH ), school (CS ), work (CW ), and
other types of contacts (CO ). Starting from the appropriate dates listed in Table 1, we
multiply the respective matrices by factors 0.44 for home, 0.45 for work, 0.03 for schools,
and 0.35 for other types of contact. Moreover, personal protection, activated on 19 March
2020, including wide use of disinfection, wearing face masks on public, and keeping interindividual distances of more than 2 metres on public, was modeled so that all elements of
the transmission matrix β were reduced by a given factor, corresponding to 88% efficiency
(averaging masks and hygiene and computing mean over the high efficiency data). All
these numbers are based on results of public opinion polls organized by two agencies during
lockdown: the PAQ Reseach agency (www.paqresearch.cz) and the Median agency (www.
median.eu). Results of these polls, summarized to our modeling purposes, are provided
in Fig. 1. These data show that during the second half of March and essentially the whole
April, contacts of all kinds have been largely reduced while personal protection increased.

Model calibration
Values of several model parameters will always remain uncertain, of which the transmission
matrix β is commonly the principal of those. This and some other model parameters, listed
in Table 4, are estimated by fitting the variable K (representing the cumulative number
of confirmed cases in any age class and county), summed over counties but not age, to
the age-specific time series on the reported cumulative numbers of confirmed cases in the
Czech Republic.
There are many ways to meaningfully perform model calibration on real-world data and
many optimization and filtering methods exist (24). We use the Approximate Bayesian
Computation (ABC), a technique used to estimate parameters of complex Markov models
in genomics and other biological disciplines (1, 6), including epidemic modeling (2, 17).
The major advantage of this method is that it naturally works with all sources of uncertainty acknowledged in the model. At the same time, ABC does not rely of likelihood
calculations and in case of sufficient computation power it can be used with models of virtually any complexity. The ABC procedure with rejection sampling we used here consisted
of three steps. First, we used our model to simulate summary statistics for calibration
(number of detected cases in age categories, state variable K) N times (100,000), drawing
the uncertain model parameters from prior distributions based on literature (see above);
selected prior distributions for estimated parameters are also given in Table 4. Second, we
compared the simulated summary statistics with the observed one, using the Euclidean
distance D. Third, we selected model simulations that satisfy D < , where  was chosen
to pass 0.05% of simulations into the selected set. Given the used summary statistics are
informative, the distribution of parameter used for such selected simulations is known to
converge from outside to the Bayesian posterior distribution of parameter values with 
going to 0, and is referred to as approximate posterior (1). The choice of  and N in
ABC is driven by compromise between computation power, smoothness and accuracy of
approximate posterior.
The set of accepted sets of parameters thus allows us to evaluate remaining parameter
uncertainty, given the available data and adopted summary statistics (1, 6). This is
crucial to realize, since although different parameter sets may similarly fit the available
data (have similar summary statistics), and often provide similar short-term predictions,
they may demonstrate significant differences in longer-term predictions and in the interplay
with intervention policies. To accommodate this uncertainty, we do not evaluate only an
absolute impact of implementation or relaxation of an intervention. We also present its
impact relative to the baseline (here the actually adopted full lockdown) scenario. If such a
relative impact is consistent over whole posterior distribution of parameters, we may have
confidence in its potential effect. To apply the ABC technique, we use the abc package in
R (7), modified to work with non-normalized summary statistics.

Determination of prior distributions for some parameters from literature
The prior distribution for the latent period (dE ) was set as normal with mean 5.08 days
and standard deviation 0.5 days, based on He et al. (13). The duration of the infectious
period before the onset of symptoms was reported in the literature as ranging from 1-3
days (22). The mean duration of test positivity for viral RNA (a proxy for infectiousness)
was reported in the literature as 25.2 days for symptomatic patients (dS ) and and 22.6
days for asymptomatic patients (dN ) (18).
The prior probability of factor reducing the infection transmission in a/presymptomatic
individuals (rβ ) was set as uniform distribution from 0.4 to 1, respecting a number of
studies. In particular, He et al. (13) re-analyzed results previously published in local Chinese journals to show a somewhat higher probability of virus transmission in symptomatic
individuals (the asymptomatic infection rate to be 46% of the symptomatic one, with the
95% CI (18.48%-73.60%)), but the source of primary data could not be verified. The value
of 0.55 was assumed by Domenico et al. (10) in setting up their model, based on Li et al.
(16) but for “undocumented” rather than “asymptomatic” patients. On the other hand,
Chen et al. (5) showed no statistically significant difference in the transmissibility of the
virus between symptomatic and a/presymptomatic cases.
The percentage of asymptomatic individuals out of those positively tested for COVID19 (pS ) has been estimated by a number of studies and the estimates vary significantly
as does the quality of the evidence. The range of the percentage of the asymptomatic
individuals among those positively tested reported is 4.4-89%. As a result, we use the
uniform distribution on the whole interval 0-100% as a prior.
