Abstract

17

The recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) require fast,

18

simple, and sensitive onsite nucleic acid diagnostics that can be developed rapidly to prevent

19

the spread of diseases. We have developed a SENsitive Splint-based one-step isothermal

20

RNA detection (SENSR) method for rapid and straightforward onsite detection of pathogen

21

RNAs with high sensitivity and specificity. SENSR consists of two simple enzymatic

22

reactions: a ligation reaction by SplintR ligase and subsequent transcription by T7 RNA

23

polymerase. The resulting transcript forms an RNA aptamer that induces fluorescence. Here,

24

we demonstrate that SENSR is an effective and highly sensitive method for the detection of

25

the current epidemic pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2

26

(SARS-CoV-2). We also show that the platform can be extended to the detection of five other

27

pathogens. Overall, SENSR is a molecular diagnostic method that can be developed rapidly

28

for onsite uses requiring high sensitivity, specificity, and short assaying times.

Introduction

30

Increasing global trade and travel are considered the cause of frequent emergence and rapid

31

dissemination of infectious diseases around the world. Some life-threatening infectious

32

diseases often have signs and symptoms similar to cold or flu-like syndromes. Early diagnosis

33

is therefore essential to identify the diseases and provide the correct treatment. Immediate and

34

onsite diagnostic decisions also help to prevent the spread of epidemic and pandemic

35

infectious diseases1–3. In order to rapidly diagnose infectious diseases, a nucleic acid-based

36

diagnosis has emerged as an alternative to the conventional culture-based, or immunoassay-

37

based, approaches due to their rapidity or specificity4–6.

38

To increase sensitivity, current nucleic acid detection methods generally involve a

39

target amplification step prior to the detection step. The conventional amplification method is

40

based on PCR, which requires a thermocycler for delicate temperature modulation. As an

41

alternative to the thermal cycling-based amplification, isothermal amplification methods are

42

available, which rely primarily on a strand-displacing polymerase or T7 RNA polymerase at a

43

constant temperature7. However, the complex composition of the isothermal amplification

44

mixtures often renders these approaches incompatible with detection methods and whole

45

diagnosis generally becomes a multi-step process8–11. The diagnostic regimen with multi-step

46

procedures requires additional time, instruments, and reagents, as well as skilled personnel to

47

perform the diagnostic procedure. This aspect limits the broad applicability of nucleic acid

48

diagnostics, especially in situations where rapid and simple detection is required.

49

Ligation-dependent nucleic acid detection is a sequence-specific method that

50

primarily depends on ligation of two separate probes that hybridize to adjacent sites of the

51

target sequence12. Because of their specificity, the ligation-dependent methods are used for

52

detection of markers of genetic disorders13,14 and pathogens15,16, typically combined with

53

subsequent amplification and signal generation methods. In particular, the SplintR ligase can

54

efficiently ligate two DNA probes using a target single-stranded RNA as a splint, enabling

55

the sequence-specific detection of RNA molecule17,18. Because the reaction components of

56

the ligation-dependent methods are relatively simple, we hypothesized that the ligation-

57

dependent method could be exploited to establish a one-step RNA detection platform when

58

combined with compatible amplification and signal generation methods in a single reaction

59

mixture.

60

In this study, we developed a one-step, ligation-dependent isothermal reaction

61

cascade that enables rapid detection of RNAs with high sensitivity, termed SENsitive Splint-

62

based one-step isothermal RNA detection (SENSR). SENSR consists of two simple

63

enzymatic reactions, a ligation reaction by SplintR ligase and subsequent transcription by T7

64

RNA polymerase. The resulting transcript forms an RNA aptamer that binds to a fluorogenic

65

dye and produces fluorescence only when target RNA exists in a sample. SENSR was able to

66

detect target RNA of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in 30 minutes

67

with a limit of detection of 0.1 aM. We further applied this platform to detect various

68

pathogens, Vibrio vulnificus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-

69

related Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Influenza A viruses, by merely redesigning the

70

hybridization regions of the probes. Finally, we demonstrated the fast development of the

71

SENSR assay for the latest epidemic pathogen, Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related

72

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-nCoV), using minimal, publicly available information.

Design of one-step, isothermal reaction cascade

76

We designed a reaction cascade that allows the one-step diagnostic test, in which all reaction

77

steps for nucleic acid detection occur simultaneously in a single tube (Fig. 1). The cascade

78

consists of four core components, which includes only two enzymes: a set of oligonucleotide

79

probes, SplintR ligase, T7 RNA polymerase, and a fluorogenic dye. The components were

80

mixed in a buffer solution with ribonucleotides. Upon addition of the pathogen-derived RNA

81

sample, the reaction steps of ligation, transcription, and dye-aptamer binding enabled

82

detection, amplification, and signal production, respectively.

83

Two single-stranded DNA probes were designed to include several functional parts

84

involved in amplification, detection, and signal generation, thereby eliminating the need for

85

human intervention during the entire diagnostic process (Fig. 1). First, the promoter probe

86

consists of an upstream hybridization sequence (UHS) and a stem-loop T7 promoter. The

87

UHS hybridizes to the 5′-half of a target RNA region. The stem-loop T7 was adopted from

88

the literature19 (Supplementary Table 1) to form an active, double-stranded T7 promoter

89

using a single-stranded oligonucleotide. The sequence of the UHS was designed by Primer-

90

BLAST20 to ensure specific binding to the target RNA. Among candidate UHS sequences, we

91

chose the one with minimal secondary structure at 37 °C predicted by NUPACK21 to

92

maximize the hybridization between the UHS and its target region (Supplementary Table 2).

93

The 5′-end of the promoter probe was then phosphorylated for ligation. Next, a reporter probe

94

consists of a downstream hybridization sequence (DHS) and a template sequence for a dye-

95

binding RNA aptamer. The DHS contains the complementary sequence to the other half of

96

the target RNA region. Similar to the UHS, the DHS was selected to have minimal predicted

97

secondary structure (Supplementary Table 2).

98
99

Once both UHS and DHS probes hybridize correctly to the target RNA, SplintR
ligase can initiate the cascade by connecting the probes that have all features built for the one-

100

step diagnostic test. Subsequently, T7 RNA polymerase can synthesize the RNA aptamer

101

using the full-length, ligated probe as a DNA template, which can be bound with the

102

fluorogenic dye to emit fluorescence as an output (Fig. 1). Notably, the reaction scheme of

103

SENSR inherently supports two mechanisms that could amplify the signal: 1) multiple

104

transcription events from the full-length, ligated probe by T7 RNA polymerase and 2) the

105

presence of target RNA sequence on the full-length transcript which could be utilized as an

106

additional splint for unligated probes in the reaction mixture. Accordingly, SENSR could

107

enable sensitive RNA detection without any pre-amplification steps.

108
109

Construction of each component reaction in SENSR

110

In this study, we used MRSA as a model case to validate each reaction step that constitutes

111

SENSR. MRSA is of particular interest because it requires significant effort to minimize

112

healthcare-related infections and prevent future infectious diseases of drug-resistant

113

pathogens22.

114

First, we designed a pair of probes that target the mecA transcript of MRSA following

115

the probe design process described in the previous section (Supplementary Note 1 and

116

Supplementary Tables 1 and 3), and the RNA-splinted ligation between the two probes was

117

tested. The probes were ligated using SplintR ligase with or without the target RNA, and the

118

reaction resultants were further amplified with a pair of PCR primers and analyzed (see

119

Methods section). The correct size of the PCR product was obtained only when the two

120

probes and target RNA were added together to the ligation mixture (Fig. 2a). This result

121

indicates that our probes were successfully ligated only in the presence of the target RNA.

122

We then used the ligated probe as a DNA template to test whether transcription could

123

occur. The ligation mixture was added at a 1/10 ratio to the in vitro transcription reaction

124

mixture with T7 RNA polymerase. Only when the target RNA was present in the ligation

125

reaction was the full-length transcript (92 nt) observed from transcription, thereby confirming

126

both target-dependent ligation and the subsequent transcription (Fig. 2b).

127
128

Finally, we confirmed that the transcript from the full-length ligated probe could
produce fluorescence upon binding to the fluorogenic dye. The reaction mixture of sequential

129

ligation and transcription reactions were purified, and an equal amount of RNAs from each

130

combination was incubated with the fluorogenic dye (Fig. 2c). The RNA product from the

131

reaction mixture with the two probes and target RNA produced higher fluorescence than that

132

of the other combinations. Therefore, we confirmed that the target RNA could be detected

133

using a set of probes by performing each component reaction in SENSR.

134
135

Development of one-step isothermal reaction cascade

136

Since all component reactions in SENSR were validated in their respective buffers, we then

137

sought to develop a one-step reaction condition with a single reaction buffer at a single

138

temperature, where all reaction steps, including probe annealing, ligation, transcription, and

139

aptamer fluorescence reaction occur simultaneously. To accomplish this, we first investigated

140

a wide range of temperatures (25–95 °C) for hybridization of the probes and target. Then,

141

each mixture was subjected to the sequential ligation, transcription reactions, and

142

fluorescence reaction described in the previous section. Remarkably, fluorescence was

143

observed at all hybridization temperatures, including 35 °C and 40 °C (Supplementary Fig.

144

1), the optimal temperature ranges for enzyme activities in SENSR, thereby suggesting that

145

the entire reaction can be built up as an isothermal reaction.

146

Additionally, a single reaction buffer composition suitable for all reaction steps was

147

configured to establish all reactions in one pot. Since T7 RNA polymerase reaction buffer has

148

the most inclusive composition of the four reaction buffers (probe annealing, ligation,

149

transcription, and aptamer fluorescence reaction buffers) we used T7 RNA polymerase buffer

150

as a basis for the optimization. Various reaction conditions were optimized, including the

151

reaction temperature and concentrations of various enzymes, and components to enhance the

152

fluorescence signal (Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). The optimized

153

SENSR condition enabled the detection of target RNA in a one-pot isothermal reaction at

154

37 °C.

155
156

Rapid and sensitive RNA detection by SENSR

157

Since the one-step and one-pot isothermal reaction condition was established, we then

158

assessed the sensitivity and turnaround time of SENSR. We evaluated the sensitivity by

159

measuring fluorescence from one-step reactions containing the mecA probe pair and synthetic

160

mecA RNA in the range of 0.1 aM to 220 nM (Fig. 3a). Notably, the detection limit was as

161

low as 0.1 aM (corresponding to 6 molecules per 100 µL reaction), indicating the high

162

sensitivity of SENSR. Moreover, the linearity of the fluorescence intensity over a wide range

163

of concentrations (R2 = 0.9932) suggests that SENSR can be used for target RNA

164

quantification.

165

We then measured the minimal turnaround time required to confirm the presence of

166

the target RNA in a sample. The target RNA ranging from 0.1 aM to 10 aM were added to the

167

SENSR reaction, and fluorescence was measured every 30 minutes. The fluorescence with

168

0.1 aM was discernible against the negative control in only 30 minutes (Fig. 3b). Further

169

incubation of the reaction better distinguished the target RNA-containing reaction from the

170

negative control reaction. Collectively, the SENSR reaction was able to specifically detect the

171

target RNA within 30 minutes with a detection limit of 0.1 aM.

172
173

Broad adaptability of SENSR for pathogen detection

174

With the fast and sensitive RNA detection using SENSR, we next attempted to reconfigure

175

this platform for the detection of RNA markers from various pathogens. Target RNA

176

sequences for SENSR are specified by only two hybridization regions (UHS and DHS) of

177

probes, which makes the probe design process fast and straightforward without many

178

computational steps. This design feature, requiring only nucleotide sequences to build

179

molecular diagnostics, allows for easy construction of SENSR probes for any infectious

180

diseases (Fig. 4a).

181

To demonstrate SENSR for various pathogens, we first targeted two pathogenic

182

microorganisms, V. vulnificus and E. coli O157:H7. V. vulnificus is known to cause

183

gastroenteritis, wound infection, and sepsis in humans. We designed a probe pair targeting

184

vvhA (Supplementary Table 3), a V. vulnificus-specific target encoding extracellular

185

hemolysin with hemolytic activity and cytotoxic effect. The sensitivity of SENSR reaction

186

using the probe pair and in-vitro-transcribed vvhA RNA was as low as 0.1 aM (Fig. 4b), and a

187

linear correlation was observed between the concentration of RNA and the fluorescence

188

intensity (R2=0.9566).

189

Next, we used SENSR to detect E. coli O157:H7, which causes foodborne illness.

190

Similar to that for V. vulnificus, we designed a probe pair for E. coli O157:H7-specific target

191

gene, tir (Supplementary Table 3), for SENSR reaction. Similarly, RNA concentrations as

192

low as 0.1 aM were detected by SENSR and a high linear correlation between the

193

concentration of RNA and the fluorescence intensity was observed (Fig. 4c; R2=0.9684).

194

The target was expanded to human-infective RNA viruses that cause fatal diseases23.

195

First, we aimed at Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

196

The mortality rate of MERS was reported to be 35%24, and can be transmitted from human to

197

human25, which raises the need for a fast and sensitive onsite diagnostic test. The probe pairs

198

for the MERS-specific gene, upE (Supplementary Table 3), exhibited similar sensitivity and

199

linearity to the bacterial cases (Fig. 4d). Likewise, we designed a probe pair for the Influenza

200

A virus-specific target gene, HA (hemagglutinin) gene (Supplementary Table 3). SENSR was

201

able to detect the Influenza A RNA target with similar sensitivity and linearity (Fig. 4e).

202

Finally, we designed a probe pair for a recently emerging pathogen, SARS-CoV-2. The target

203

sequence was selected based on the standard real-time RT-PCR assay for the SARS-CoV-226,

204

which aimed at the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene (Supplementary Table 3).

205

Again, SENSR successfully detected its target RNA as low as 0.1 aM, which corroborates the

206

high adaptability of this method to various RNA markers (Fig. 2f).

207

Taken together, we demonstrated that SENSR could be easily reconfigured to detect

208

various RNA markers of pathogens by redesigning the probes. The probe design process is

209

simple and requires a small amount of computation using open web-based software. All probe

210

pairs tested showed high sensitivity and linearity for detecting RNA markers, reinforcing the

211

robustness of the probe design process and the wide expandability of SENSR.

212
213

Direct detection of a pathogen using SENSR

214

Next, we employed SENSR for the detection of RNA samples derived from the live cells of a

215

pathogen. We targeted MRSA, whose marker RNA was detected by SENSR. Methicillin-

216

Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) that contains no target mRNA was used as a

217

negative control. MRSA and MSSA cells were heated to 95 °C to lyse the cells and to release

218

RNAs. The samples were then diluted and added to SENSR reaction to investigate the

219

specificity and sensitivity (Fig. 5a). We observed a significant difference in fluorescence

220

intensity between MRSA and MSSA (Fig. 5b). The RNA sample from only 2 CFU per 100

221

μL reaction of MRSA, not MSSA, was clearly detected by SENSR, thereby indicating its

222

high sensitivity and specificity even with samples of the living pathogen. Finally, the

223

performance of SENSR was further validated using samples prepared in human serum (Fig.

224

5c). The sensitivity and specificity of SENSR were unaffected by the presence of human

225

serum (Fig. 5d), indicating the suitability of SENSR in practical applications.

Dual target detection using orthogonal SENSR probes

228

Finally, we expanded the capability of SENSR to enable the simultaneous detection of two

229

target RNAs in a single reaction by leveraging simple probe design. The detection of multiple

230

biomarkers is frequently needed to make a better decision by reducing false-positive and

231

false-negative results. Based on the high specificity of SENSR probes and availability of

232

light-up RNA aptamers with distinct spectral properties27, we hypothesized that we could

233

design two sets of SENSR probes that operate orthogonally in a single reaction to detect their

234

respective target RNAs.

235

First, we developed an orthogonal reporter probe for Influenza A virus. Since the

236

MRSA infection causes flu-like symptoms, discrimination of this pathogen from common

237

Influenza A virus is required. Furthermore, the patient with the influenza A infection is more

238

susceptible to the MRSA infection28. Collectively, simultaneous detection and discrimination

239

of both pathogens can help the diagnosis and follow-up actions. An orthogonal reporter probe

240

for Influenza A virus was designed by replacing its aptamer template region with the template

241

for the Broccoli aptamer29–32 which binds to DFHBI-1T ((5Z)-5-[(3,5-Difluoro-4-

242

hydroxyphenyl)methylene]-3,5-dihydro-2-methyl-3-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-4H-imidazol-4-

243

one) and exhibits spectral properties distinct from that of the malachite green aptamer.

244

Secondary structures of the new reporter probe and corresponding full-length RNA transcript

245

were simulated, using NUPACK, and satisfied the probe design criteria without further

246

optimization (Supplementary Table 2). Dual detection of MRSA and Influenza A virus was

247

tested in SENSR reactions in which the two probe pairs, their cognate fluorogenic dyes, and

248

various concentrations of the target RNAs were added (Fig. 6a). When the probe pairs are

249

hybridized to their respective target RNAs, and successful transcription follows, the RNA

250

aptamers would bind their cognate dyes and emit distinguishable fluorescence. The presence

251

of each target RNA could be determined by the fluorescence patterns from the SENSR

252

reaction: malachite green aptamer fluorescence for MRSA, and Broccoli aptamer

253

fluorescence for Influenza A virus. Indeed, the presence of either target RNA (1 nM) was

254

easily detected by the fluorescence pattern (Fig. 6b). Across various concentrations of each

255

target RNA, the SENSR probes specifically produced fluorescence that responded only to

256

respective targets, thereby enabling orthogonal dual detection of two pathogens (Fig. 6c).

257

Lastly, we applied the orthogonal dual detection to the SARS-CoV-2, which has many

258

related viruses with high sequence homology. Simultaneous detection of multiple target sites

259

along its genome would enable specific discrimination of this emerging pathogen from

260

others. In addition to the previously demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 probe pair (Fig. 4f), we

261

designed three additional probe pairs for other regions in the RdRp gene with either the

262

malachite green aptamer or the Broccoli aptamer (Fig. 7a). Each probe pair contained a

263

discriminatory base at either the 5′-end of PP or 3′-end of RP, which are unique to SARS-

264

CoV-2 against other similar viruses. Mismatches between the probes and nontarget RNAs

265

would inhibit ligation and subsequent SENSR reaction and could enable more specific

266

detection of SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, all four probe pairs were able to detect 1 aM of SARS-

267

CoV-2 RNA, thereby exhibiting higher fluorescence intensity compared to that of the related

268

viral RNA sequences (Fig. 7b). We then tested the orthogonal dual detection of two target

269

regions using the SARS-CoV-2-MG1 and SARS-CoV-2-BR2 probe pairs. Dual SENSR

270

assay effectively detected the target RNA and maintained the specificity of each probe pair

271

(Fig. 7c). Therefore, the dual SENSR assay could be used to assist diagnostic decision

272

making by providing two detection results that can complement each other.

273
274

Discussion

275

Rapid, simple, economical, and sensitive diagnostic tests are needed to detect and manage

276

infectious diseases at the earliest possible time. However, conventional approaches lack one

277

or more of these features. Culture-based methods are time-consuming (>24 h)33 while PCR11

based methods, including real-time-PCR, require a complex procedure, expensive

279

instruments, and skilled expertise. Various isothermal amplification methods for RNA have

280

been introduced to replace traditional methods7,8, but they generally require numerous

281

reaction components, often making them expensive and incompatible with the signal

282

production step.

283

In contrast, SENSR satisfies many desirable requirements for onsite diagnostic tests

284

for pathogens, such as short turnaround time (30 min), low limit of detection (0.1 aM),

285

inexpensive instrumentation and reagents, and a simple diagnostic procedure. SENSR

286

integrates all component reaction steps using the specially designed probes that contain all

287

required functional parts: promoter, hybridization sequence to target, and an aptamer

288

template. Even with the multifaceted features of the SENSR probes, the design process is

289

systematic and straightforward. Therefore, new SENSR assay can be promptly developed for

290

emerging pathogens as exemplified by the successful design of SENSR assay for SARS-

291

CoV-2.

292

The probe design is unique in that two DNA probes are designed to expose single-

293

stranded target recognition parts, enabling hybridization of the target RNA and the probes at

294

37℃. The hybridization sequences were systematically selected using the nucleic acid design

295

software Primer-BLAST and NUPACK to minimize any structure formation while

296

maximizing hybridization to the target RNA. The efficient hybridization between the probes

297

and target RNA is one of the reasons for enabling high sensitivity during the isothermal

298

reaction.

299

The promoter probe is programmed to form a stem-loop structure and the stem part

300

forms a double-stranded T7 promoter sequence that initiates transcription by recruiting T7

301

RNA polymerase. Since the two strands of T7 promoter part are physically connected by the

302

loop, the probability of formation of a functional double-stranded promoter is higher in the

303

stem-loop structured design than when each strand of the promoter is not connected by the

304

loop. Thus, the hairpin structured, self-assembling promoter sequence in the promoter probe

305

can facilitate hybridization and subsequent transcription more efficiently.

306

The initiated transcription elongates through the single-stranded DNA as a template to

307

amplify target RNAs containing aptamer RNAs. The use of a fluorogenic RNA aptamer

308

facilitated SENSR development by enabling fast and straightforward signal generation.

309

Compared to conventional fluorescent protein outputs, the use of RNA aptamers as reporters

310

can reduce the time it takes to observe the signal34.

311

The simple enzyme composition is another reason to enable one-step and one-pot

312

detection. The fewer the enzymes, the easier it is to optimize in terms of temperature and

313

buffer composition. In designing the detection scheme, we deliberately tried to reduce the

314

number of enzymes, thus creating one of the simplest isothermal detection schemes based on

315

two enzymes: SplintR ligase for target detection and T7 RNA polymerase for amplification.

316

In addition to the results shown in this study, we expect that SENSR has a broad range

317

of possibilities for pathogen detection. First, SENSR can be easily implemented in the initial

318

screening of infectious diseases at places where a large number of people gather and

319

transfer35,36. With a short turnaround time and a simple reaction composition, SENSR is an

320

ideal diagnostic test for rapid and economical screening. Second, SENSR will be a valuable

321

platform for the immediate development of diagnostic tests for emerging pathogens1,37

322

because of the simple probe design process and broad adaptability of SENSR. In this work,

323

we demonstrated the successful application of SENSR to six pathogens, using minimal

324

redesign based on the highly modular structure of the probes. In theory, SENSR detection

325

probes can be designed for any RNA as long as the target nucleic acid sequence is available.

326

This feature provides SENSR a significant advantage over antibody-based diagnostics to

327

rapidly respond to the outbreak of infectious disease. The nucleic acid probe synthesis is

328

more scalable than animal antibody production. Therefore, SENSR is more suitable for rapid

329

mass production of diagnostic kits than antibody-based diagnostics. Future efforts on

330

automated probe design will be needed to accelerate the development of SENSR assays for

331

newly emerging pathogens.

332

In conclusion, SENSR is a powerful diagnostic platform for RNA detection, which

333

offers a short turnaround time, high sensitivity and specificity, and a simple assay procedure,

334

and eliminates the need for expensive instrumentations and diagnostic specialists. Given the

335

simple probe design process, and its rapid development, SENSR will be a suitable diagnostic

336

method for emerging infectious diseases.

Malachite green and aptamer binding assay. A 1 μM solution of RNA transcript

386

containing malachite green aptamer was mixed with a reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH

387

7.5, 1 mM ATP, 10 mM NaCl, and 140 mM KCl) to produce 90 μL of solution. The mixture

388

was heated to 95 °C for 10 min and left at room temperature for 20 min. A 5 μL solution of

Fig. 1: Schematic illustration of SENSR, a one-step isothermal reaction cascade for

547

rapid detection of RNAs. The reaction is composed of four main components: a set of

548

probes, SplintR ligase, T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP), and a fluorogenic dye. In the

549

presence of target RNA, hybridization, ligation, transcription, and aptamer-dye binding

550

reactions occur sequentially in a single reaction tube at a constant temperature. UHS,

Transcription reaction. The ligated mixtures were used as a DNA template to validate

561

transcription. The transcript was obtained only in the presence of target RNA and all other

562

components, demonstrating both target-dependent ligation and the subsequent transcription.

The red arrow points to the correct size of the transcript. c, Fluorescence reaction. After

564

sequential ligation and transcription reactions, the reaction mixture with the correct size of

565

the transcript produced higher fluorescence compared to other conditions that lack one of the

566

necessary components. Fluorescence tests are four experimental replicas (two-tailed student’s

567

test; * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01, *** P < 0.001, **** P < 0.0001; bars represent mean ± s.d).

RNA from 220 nM to 0.1 aM was tested. The detection limit is 0.1 aM. High linearity

suggests that SENSR can be used for the quantification of the target RNA. b, Turnaround

SENSR was varied. The target RNA of 0.1 aM was detected as early as 30 min. All tests are
