Abstract
Background. Critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have a profound
hypercoagulable state and often develop coagulopathy which leads to organ failure and death.
Because of a prolonged activated partial-thromboplastin time (aPTT), a relationship with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) has been proposed, but results are controversial. Functional assays
for aPL (i.e., lupus anticoagulant) can be influenced by concomitant anticoagulation and/or high
levels of C reactive protein. The presence of anti-cardiolipin (aCL), anti-beta2-glycoprotein I (antiβ2GPI) and anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT) antibodies was not investigated
systematically. Epitope specificity of anti-β 2GPI antibodies was not reported.
Objective. To evaluate the prevalence and the clinical association of aPL in a large cohort of
COVID-19 patients, and to characterize the epitope specificity of anti-β 2GPI antibodies.
Methods. ELISA and chemiluminescence assays were used to test 122 sera of patients suffering
from severe COVID-19. Of them, 16 displayed major thrombotic events.
Results. Anti-β2GPI IgG/IgA/IgM were the most frequent in 15.6/6.6/9.0% of patients, while aCL
IgG/IgM were detected in 5.7/6.6% by ELISA. Comparable values were found by
chemiluminescence. aPS/PT IgG/IgM were detectable in 2.5 and 9.8% by ELISA. No association
between thrombosis and aPL was found. Reactivity against domain 1 and 4-5 of β2GPI was limited
to 3/58 (5.2%) tested sera for each domain and did not correlate with aCL/anti-β2GPI nor with
thrombosis.
Conclusions. aPL show a low prevalence in COVID-19 patients and are not associated with major
thrombotic events. aPL in COVID-19 patients are mainly directed against β2GPI but display an
epitope specificity different from antibodies in antiphospholipid syndrome.

1. Introduction
Critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have a profound hypercoagulable
state and often develop thrombosis in veins, arteries and in the microcirculation [1,2]. Recent
analysis showed several coagulation abnormalities in these patients, including prominent elevation
of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (i.e., D-dimer) and a prolonged activated partialthromboplastin time (aPTT). While high levels of D-dimer are consistent with sustained activation
of the clotting and fibrinolytic cascades, the combination of prolonged aPTT and both arterial and
venous thrombosis was, however, surprising, and it is reminiscent of a clinical scenario known as
antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) [3].
Looking at the causes for aPTT prolongation, recent studies have shown that lupus anticoagulant
(LA) can be detected in a significant percentage of COVID-19 samples [4-6]. Since LA is often
caused by aPL, these findings support the idea that aPL may play a role in COVID-19[7]. However,
it is important to point out that LA is a very sensitive assay and its outcome can be influenced by
several factors, most notably heparin administration [8] and a profound inflammatory state
characterized by high levels of C reactive protein (CRP) [9,10]. Both of them are present in
COVID-19 patients [11].
Another method to detect aPL that is in principle insensitive to anticoagulation and other
confounding agents relies on the detection and quantification of autoantibodies using solid phase
assays[3]. Using this method, the presence of aPL was recently reported in a handful of case reports
and small cohorts of patients [4,6,7,12,13]. While encouraging, this data is limited and its
interpretation remains controversial, with some investigators proposing an important role of aPL in
COVID-19 patients[7] while others suggesting a very poor correlation between aPL and thrombotic
events [14]. There is no information on the antigen specificity of COVID-19 aPL in comparison
with APS antibodies. Such information and a larger study, possibly multicenter, may be
instrumental to clarify the real clinical value of these autoantibodies.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Patients
A total of 122 patients were enrolled from two COVID-19 referral centers in Lombardia. All
patients tested positive to SARS-CoV-2, and classified as severe or critical COVID-19 [11]. Mean
age was 68.5 (+ SD 16.4) years; 77 were men and 45 women. No diagnosis of previous
autoimmune diseases was made; six patients had a thrombotic event (three arterial and three
venous) in the past clinical history. Eighty-seven patients suffering from APS were also tested for
anti-cardiolipin (aCL) and anti-β 2GPI IgG/IgM [15].The study was approved by the Ethics
Committees (Istituto Auxologico Italiano 3-04-2020 - Milan and ASST Spedali Civili NP4187 Brescia).
2.2 Detection of aPL
Anti-cardiolipin and anti-β 2GPI IgG/IgA/IgM were detected by chemiluminescence immunoassay
(CIA; Quanta Flash, Inova, San Diego, CA, US) and a home-made ELISA as described [15,16].
Anti-β2GPI domain 1 IgG (anti-D1) were detected by CIA[15,16], IgG anti-D4-5 by a home-made
ELISA, as described [15,16]. Anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT) IgG/IgM were
detected by a commercial ELISA as reported[17].
2.3 Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using R v3.4.0. Descriptive statistics was used to summarize data. Associations
and differences between categorical or continuous variables were tested by Fisher’s exact test and
non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, respectively. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

3. Results
3.1 Patients
Table 1 reports the median with minimum and maximum values for different coagulation and
inflammation parameters in 122 severe or critical COVID-19 patients. In particular, prolonged
aPTT (>30 sec) was found in 57.6% while PT INR values were above the cut-off in 24.8% of the
cases. Most of the patients (120/122) were on anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin
(70% on therapeutic and the remaining on prophylactic dosage). Despite anticoagulation, we
observed sixteen thrombotic events (13.1%, 8 in veins and 8 in arteries). These statistics are in
agreement with previous reports[2,18-23] and document a systemic inflammation and a
coagulopathy in our patients.
3.2 Anti-cardiolipin and anti-β2GPI antibody testing.
In the APS field, testing for LA is not recommended when patients are on heparin, since the
presence of heparin, even if neutralized, may lead to false positive results [8]. Likewise, high levels
CRP, such as those found in our cohort of patients, have been shown to prolong aPTT
independently from the presence of aPL[9,10]. On these bases, the presence of aPL was researched
using solid phase assays, and not LA. First, we investigated the presence of aCL and anti-β2GPI,
two APS classification criteria[3]. Testing was independently performed in Milan and Brescia,
using harmonized methodologies[24]. The prevalence of COVID-19 patients positive for aCL and
anti-β 2GPI IgG/IgA/IgM detected by ELISA and CIA is summarized in Table 2. The ELISA raw
data are shown in Fig. 1. We found IgG/IgM aCL in 5.7/6.6% of patients, whereas anti-β2GPI
IgG/IgA/IgM were found in 15.6/6.6/9.0% of patients. Similar values were obtained for aCL
antibodies using CIA (Table 1), whereas a slightly lower sensitivity was obtained for anti-β2GPI
antibodies [25]. The positivity for aCL and anti-β2GPI antibodies was at medium/low titer in
contrast with the medium/high titers found in the control group of primary APS (Figure 1). There is
no association between aPL positivity and thrombotic events.
3.3 Epitope characterization of anti-β2GPI antibodies
Fifty-eight sera were also tested with D1 and D4-5-coated plates in order to characterize their
epitope specificity. Fig. 2B shows that three out of 58 samples reacted with D1, while in Fig. 2C,
three samples tested positive for D4-5. None of the sera was positive for both domains and all
displayed a weak reactivity with no association with thrombosis.
3.4 Anti-phosphatidylserine/prothrombin antibody testing
Prolonged aPTT (>30 sec) was found in 57.6% of the patients. Although aPS/PT are not included in
the APS classification laboratory tests, they can be associated with a prolonged aPTT and with the
presence of LA[17]. Consequently, we looked at the presence of aPS/PT antibodies in our cohort
and we found fifteen out of 122 sera positive for aPS/PT (12.3%), mostly of the IgM isotype (12 out
15) and at a low titer (Fig. 3). There was no association between prolonged aPTT and the presence
of aPS/PT antibodies nor with thrombotic events in our COVID-19 cohort.
4. Discussion
Taken together, our data shows a low prevalence of classification criteria aPL in COVID-19
patients. In this regard, our study confirms recent studies obtained with smaller cohorts of
patients[4,14,23]. Importantly, our data also shows that aPL are slightly more reactive towards
β2GPI-coated plates as compared to CL-coated ones and that, regardless of the nature of aPL, there
is no association between aPL positivity and thrombotic events (p=1).
A striking difference between the autoantibody profile in COVID-19 patients as compared to the
one in APS concerned the titers of aPL. Medium/low aPL titers were consistently found in the

patients with COVID-19. By contrast, medium/high titers are usually found in APS patients (Fig.
1). This difference suggests that aPL found in COVID-19 may be different from aPL found in APS
and led us to further investigate the epitope specificity of anti-β2GPI antibodies. We focused on
autoantibodies directed against the N-terminal domain 1 (anti-D1) or the C-terminal domains 4-5
(anti-D4-5) of the molecule[16] (Fig. 2A). This is because anti-D1 antibodies are associated with an
increased risk of thrombosis and pregnancy complications in APS[15,16,26]. By contrast, anti D4-5
antibodies are associated neither with vascular nor obstetric APS manifestations[15,27].
Furthermore, anti D4-5 antibodies are also reported at high levels in the so called asymptomatic
aPL carriers and are frequently found in non-APS (e.g. patients with leprosy, atopic dermatitis,
atherosclerosis and in children born to mothers with systemic autoimmune diseases) [27]. We found
that three out of 58 samples reacted with D1, and three samples tested positive for D4-5. None of
the sera was positive for both domains and all displayed a weak reactivity. Although the number of
the investigated sera is relatively small, this finding is quite different from the results found in APS
in which almost all the sera positive for the whole β2GPI molecule also reacted with domain D1 at
high titer[15,26]. Furthermore, at variance with APS patients, none of the anti-D1 positive patients
displayed thrombotic events[26].
Approximately fifty-seven per cent of COVID-19 patients has prolonged aPTT. Yet, only a small
proportion of COVID-19 patients carry aCL and anti-β2GPI antibodies. This suggests that other
factors must be responsible for the prolonged aPTT phenomenon. Since aPS/PT can be associated
with a prolonged aPTT and with the presence of LA[17], we tested our cohort for aPS/PT
antibodies. We found a small percentage (12.3%) of positive sera, mostly of the IgM isotype (12 out
15) and at a low titer. Again there was no association between prolonged aPTT and the presence of
aPS/PT antibodies nor with thrombotic events in our COVID-19 cohort. This indicates that aPS/PT
are not responsible for the prolongation of aPTT nor are predictors of adverse clinical outcomes.
Furthermore, in contrast to what we would have expected in APS[28], we found no associations
between the presence of aPS/PT, aCL and anti-β2GPI antibodies. This data is in line with the
unusual epitope specificity of anti-β2GPI antibodies documented in Fig. 2, supporting the
hypothesis that aPL found in COVID-19 patients are different from aPL found in APS patients.
Whether COVID-19 aPL are similar to the ones found in other infectious diseases such as HCV,
HBV and HIV[29] remains to be determined.
In conclusion, while medium/high aPL titers with D1 specificity are associated with vascular events
in APS, low antibody titers with reactivity against β2GPI epitope(s) different from D1 or D4,5 can
be found in COVID-19. This may explain the lack of association with thrombotic events in
COVID-19. In addition, our data do not support the hypothesis that aPL can be the main cause of
prolonged aPTT in these patients. Although low titer aPL are not predictive of vascular events in
the APS, it is important to keep in mind that COVID-19 patients suffer from an acute form of
systemic inflammation with complement activation[30], which may be responsible for endothelial
perturbation. In this context, since β2GPI can accumulate on the activated endothelium at high
density, even low titers of aPL may become pathogenic thus potentiating or even triggering
thrombus formation, especially when anticoagulation is suspended. A comparable condition in
which low titers of aPL can cause substantial damage is seen in obstetric APS, where high levels of
β2GPI can be found in the placenta[31]. Hence, while transitory aPL are likely to be clinically
irrelevant in COVID-19 patients as in other infections[29], detection of aPL may be useful for
identifying patients potentially at risk of thrombosis after the hospital discharge. Accordingly, an
anticoagulant prophylaxis could be justified before a confirmatory assay[3].

Figure 1. Titers of aCL and aβ2GPI antibodies detected by ELISA in COVID-19 patients
(black, n=122) and comparison with APS patients (green, n=86).
Values are expressed as median levels [first and third quartile]. Panel A: aCL. From the left to the
right: COVID-19 IgG: 15 [8 - 15]; APS IgG: 65 [22 – 103]; COVID-19 IgM: 6.2 [2.6 - 10.8]; and
APS IgM: 4.0 [1 - 11]. Panel B: aβ2GPI. From the left to the right: COVID-19 IgG: 0.06 [0.04 –
0.10]; APS IgG: 1.14 [0.52– 1.55]; COVID-19 IgM: 0.065 [0.02 – 0.142]; APS IgM: 0.23 [0.105 –
0.741]; and COVID-19 IgA: 0.04 [0.02 – 0.09]. Cutoff values are aCL IgG/IgM 20 phospholipid
units (GPL/MPL); aβ 2GPI IgG/IgM/ IgA ELISA 0.13, 0.27 and 0.16 optical units (OD),
respectively.
Figure 2. Epitope specificity of anti-β2GPI antibodies in COVID-19 patients. Panel A.
Three-dimensional structure of β2GPI solved at 2.4 Å by X-ray crystallography (PDI ID: 6V06
[32]) displaying the positioning of the fragments used in this study. The N-terminal D1 is shown in
red. The C-terminal D4-5 fragment is shown in blue. N-linked glycosylations are shown as magenta
stick. Titers of anti-D1 (panel B) and anti-D4-5 antibodies (panel C) in 58 COVID-19 patients
detected by chemiluminescence and ELISA, respectively. Values are expressed as median levels
[first and third quartile]. Anti-D1(aD1): 3.6 [3.6 – 4.7]. Anti-D4-D5 (aD4-D5): 0.10 [0.068 –
0.199]. Cutoff values are >20 chemiluminescent units (CU) and >0.405 optical units (OD) for aD1
and aD4-D5, respectively.
Figure 3. Titers of aPS/PT antibodies detected by ELISA in COVID-19 patients.
Values are expressed as median levels [first and third quartile]. aPS/PT IgG:13.6 [8 to 15.2];
aPS/PT IgM:11.4 [8 to 16.5] IgM. Cut-off of the assays was 30 units/ml.
