The Neutrophil Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Platelet Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR)
and routine hematological parameters of COVID-19 Patient: A perspective of
the Indian scenario from a frontline pilot study of 32 COVID-19 cases in a
Tertiary Care Institute of North India.
Abstract:
Introduction
The corona virus disease 2019(COVID-19) is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 and is declared as
a global pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO). Various hematological parameters
alteration has been documented in the Chinese literature in SARS-Cov-2 infection. However,
there is a need for research to evaluate the pattern of the hematological parameters of COVID-19
patients in the Indian population.
Aims & Objectives:
The objective of the study is to see the Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Platelet
Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR), and other hematological parameters alteration of COVID-19 patients
along with their clinical course in the Indian scenario.
Methods:
A single-center prospective study of 32 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted
to Super Speciality Pediatric Hospital & Post Graduate Teaching Institute NOIDA, from March to
April, were enrolled for the study. The demographic date, the clinical status of the patients during
admission and follow up, baseline, and follow up hematological findings were recorded.
Statistical analysis of the data was carried out, and relevant findings were presented.
Results:
Demographic characterization shows a mean age of 37.7 years, male (41.9%),female (58.1%)with
majority patients are mildly symptomatic to asymptomatic(93%). The CBC values and NLR, PLR
at baseline between the male and the female patients, are not showing any statistically significant
difference as the 95% C.I. A statistically significant increment in the lab parameters is observed in
follow-up visits.
Conclusion:
Majority of the patients are younger and have mild clinical presentation with female
predominance. Pediatric cases have mild symptomology. Baseline CBC findings show mild
neutrophilia, lymphopenia, eosinopenia and normal to mild thrombocytopenia. An increase in
CBC parameters, NLR was noted in follow up cases. Anemia was not noted in baseline CBC and

INTRODUCTION
China reported a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology originating from “Wuhan,
Hubei Province, China” to the WHO Country office on the 31st of December 2019. The Etiology
of the illness was attributed to a novel Virus belonging to the Corona Virus (CoV) Family.
Subsequently, the World Health Organization officially announced that the disease caused by this
new CoV is named COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease-19).
Initially, the new Virus was called as 2019 nCovid. Subsequently, the Task of experts of the
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) termed it as the SARS-COV-2 Virus
as it is very similar to the one that caused the SARS outbreak (SARS-COVs).
The Virus is spreading around the World, thus assuming the dramatic features of a pandemic
Emergency. On the 11th March 2020, WHO declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic. India
confirmed its first case on 30th January 2020 in Kerala. The national capital of India, Delhi, and
the National Capital Region (NOIDA) reported the first case on 5th March 2020, and as of now till
22nd April 2020, India has 15,859 active cases as per data from Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare, Government of India website.
The Clinical characterization of COVID-19 has been broadly defined by WHO1with most of the
confirmed COVID-19 cases have mild to moderate clinical presentation. However, there can be
rapid deterioration for severe patients who will undergo respiratory failure, septic shock, or
multiple organ dysfunction, threatening life. Efficient laboratory indicators for the disease
severity, therapeutic response, and disease outcome have not been fully investigated. Early
identification of indicators distinguishing severe patients from mild to moderate ones can
facilitate faster medical intervention, thereby lowering the mortality rate and optimizing the case
of the extremely strained medical recourses in developing countries like India. The guidelines of

the National Health Commission of China for COVID-19 5th Edition2 and the WHO interim
Guidance1 currently recommended two laboratory parameters- normal/decreased numbers of
leucocytes or decreased number of lymphocytes as one of the criteria for the diagnosis of
COVID-19 infection. Various hematological parameters alteration has been documented in the
current literature review in SARS-Cov-2 infection in the Chinese and the Western population,
which signifies the severity and the prognosis of the patient outcome. However, there is a need for
research to evaluate the pattern of the hematological parameters of COVID-19 patients in the
Indian population.

AIM: The primary objective of the study is to see the Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio, Platelet
Lymphocyte Ratio, and other hematological parameters alteration of COVID 19 Patients in the
Indian scenario. The secondary objective of the study is to assess the follow up hematological
parameters of the patients in order to obtain key indicators of disease progression and outcome
that will provide guidance for subsequent clinical practice.

METHOD:
Patient selection:
Single Center prospective study of 32 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to
Super Speciality Pediatric Hospital & Post Graduate Teaching Institute, from March to April,
were enrolled for the study. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was according to the Ministry of Health
and Family Welfare (MOHFW) Government of India (GOI) guidelines and confirmed by RTPCR
performed on respiratory samples of the patient. All pediatric and adult cases were included in the
study. Patients with chronic lung diseases, hematological disorders, liver disease, and malignancy
on treatment were excluded from the study. Patients were divided into asymptomatic (mild)
patient, and symptomatic(moderate) patients based on the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
(MOHFW) Government of India (GOI) Revised Guidelines on clinical management of COVID19.

Baseline data Collection:
The demographic date, the clinical status of the patients during admission, and follow up and
hematological findings were recorded. The samples for complete blood count (CBC) and
peripheral smears for microscopy examination were collected on the day of admission. All
patients didn't receive any treatment before blood sampling. The samples were tested for complete

blood count on 5-part hematology analyzer Abbott Cell Dyn Ruby, and values were noted.
Peripheral blood smears were stained by Romanowsky stains, and findings were noted.

Follow up:
The patients whose clinical status remained unchanged were reexamined for laboratory indexes.
The composite endpoint of the study was a clinical improvement, stability, or deterioration.

Statistical Analysis:
Dates are presented on means and standard deviation (SD). Differences in values between tested
confidence intervals were calculated. Correlation analysis used a simple linear correlation. The
optimal cutoff. Value, sensitivity, and specificity of NLR, PLR, and other CBC variables were
determined, paired T-test was applied, and follow up data presented separately. All statistical
analyses were carried out by SPSS 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).

RESULTS

Demographic characterization:
A total of 32 patients were admitted with a mean age of 37.7 years (4 months to 81 years),
including males & Females. There were 29 cases in the mild group and 3 cases in the
moderate/severe group. Patients in the moderate group were older than the cases in the mild
category, with a case of an 81-year-old patient being recorded as the oldest in our institute.
Females constitute 58.10%, and males constitute 41.9% of the study population. The median
follow up time was of 2 weeks. All the paediatric cases under study were stable and
asymptomatic, with only supportive treatment. Adult patients included in the study were given
supportive treatment, and only one case showed clinical deterioration over a period of 14 days of
admission.
The statistical analyses of the data are being summarized in the table and graphs.

between males and females at the baseline visit. The baseline Lab values of Follow-up cases are
also not showing any statistically significant difference as the 95% Confidence Interval (C.I) for
the mean of lab parameters are falling within the acceptable lab ranges (Normal ranges as per 5
part Hematology Analyzer Reference Value within the parentheses)
Table 3: Statistical analysis of the follow-up CBC data available for 3 cases in the symptomatic
(moderate to severe symptoms) group.
A statistically significant increment in the lab parameters is observed in follow-up visit 2 & visit
3, but a larger follow-up data needs to be studied for better delineation of the results (N=3
(Follow-up visit 2) & N=2 (Follow-up Visit 3)).
Table 4: The NLR in our study group asymptomatic/mild versus symptomatic/moderate-severe
symptoms was as given in the table:
In our analysis, 6 cases were seen with baseline NLR above the standard risk stratification cut off
value of 3.13. This was not statistically significant. However, out of the 6 cases, 3 cases were
symptomatic with high NLR both in baseline CBC and on follow up after 14 days, which was
statistically significant.
Image1 & Image 2: Composite analysis of variables under study for baseline values with follow
up (box and whisker plots) show range of variation in different parameters. The lines show
variation beyond the upper and lower ranges with each plot with random outliers. Each plot has a
central line showing the range of dispersion of values and in the composite plots it is seen that
compared to baseline there is a significant variation in the follow up plots for all the variables of
CBC except Hemoglobin and RBC Count along with NLR and PLR.
Image 3: Baseline NLR histogram showing range variability of NLR in 32 cases with mean value
of 2.08 with few values above 3.1.
Image 4: Histogram showing variability in the PLR range of 32 baseline cases with mean value
of 60.97.
From the above statistical analysis, it can be presumed that the longer the virus remains in the
human body, the CBC parameters are affected, but in the earlier phase of onset of disease or
symptoms, significant alteration of the CBC parameters are not observed.
DISCUSSION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent
coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.
Genetic sequencing of the virus suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is a beta-coronavirus closely linked to

the SARS virus1. While most people with COVID-19 develop a mild or uncomplicated illness,
approximately 14% develop severe disease requiring hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5%
require admission to an intensive care unit. Several studies have documented SARS-CoV-2
infection in patients who never develop symptoms (asymptomatic) and in patients not yet
symptomatic (pre-symptomatic)3-7
Since asymptomatic persons are not routinely tested, the prevalence of asymptomatic infection
and detection of pre-symptomatic infection is not well understood.
Clinical and epidemiological data of the asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases in Indian
lacks to provide an illustration of the epidemiological curve of disease outbreak in the Indian
population. Data from our study shows that most of the patients are asymptomatic to mildly
symptomatic (90.3%), thus correlating with other studies in the Chinese and the Western
population.
The demographic characteristics of our study showed that females were affected more often than
men. This is in contrast to various studies conducted by Guan WJ et al8, Zhang JJ et al9, Nanshan
Chen et al10, where the disease incidence was more in men as compared to females. Previous
studies conducted on SERS COV and MERS have also been found to infect more males than
females11, 12. The reduced susceptibility of females to viral infections could be attributed to the
protection from X chromosome and sex hormones, which play an important role in innate and
adaptive immunity13.
The change in the gender pattern in the Indian population could be due to immunological, ethnic,
or racial variation. This area needs further research, and a larger cohort study may be suggested to
establish the fact.
A study conducted by Li et al. on the first 425 cases of COVID 19 in Wuhan; China showed that
the patients' median age was 59 years, with a range of 15 to 89 years14. However, in our study, the
median age was 37.7 years (4 months-81 years). In our study group, pediatric cases comprise
12.9% of the total cases. This is in contrast to the study conducted by Li et al. in the Chinese
population whereby they reported no clinical cases in children below 15 years of age14.
Although the clinical characteristic of COVID-19 has been broadly defined by WHO1, an outline
of the most representative laboratory abnormalities found in patients with COVID-2019 infection
still lacks in the Indian scenario.
Lippi G et al15 carried out a systematic literature review and highlighted that the most important
hematological parameter abnormalities observed in COVID-19 patients, which may predict the

progression toward severe or critical forms of COVID-19, include leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and
lymphopenia. Each of these prognostic parameters retains a specific clinical and biological
significance, which, altogether, can contribute to reflect the evolution toward more unfavorable
clinical pictures.
Huang C et al. and Yang X mentioned in their articles whereby 85% of the critically ill patients of
their study group with COVID-19 showed lymphopenia 16, 17 . The presence of lymphopenia as a
signature of severe COVID-19 was confirmed by Bai et al., who reported that ICU patients
suffering this infection had a median lymphocyte count of 800 cells/mm18 with -non-survivors
exhibiting persistent lymphopenia.
As per the IFCC guidelines, the CBC parameters in a COVID case show neutrophilia,
leucocytosis lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia (IFCC Information Guide on COVID-19;
published Thursday, March 26: https://www.ifcc.org/ifcc-news/2020-03-26-ifcc-informationguide-on-covid-19/).In another Chinese study, which has analyzed data from two laboratory
parameters, “normal/ decreased number of leukocytes” or “decreased number of lymphocytes,” as
one of the criteria for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. A study conducted by Chuan Qin et
al.19 showed that primary dysregulation of the immune response, especially T lymphocytes, might
be highly involved in the pathological process of COVID-19. Most of the severe cases
demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines. The
number of T cells significantly decreased, and more hampered in severe cases18.

Analysis of the baseline CBC parameters of our study population showed that 4 cases (12.9%)
showed neutrophilia, 3(9.6%) cases showed lymphopenia (ALC < 1 × 109/L), and 5 cases
(16.1%) showed monocytosis. However, the baseline total leucocyte count was not increased. The
lower percentage of cases showing lymphopenia in our study is in contrast to the other studies
conducted in China, whereby 63% of cases showed lymphopenia and 42% cases outside the
Chinese population15, 19. The disparity in the percentage of cases showing lymphopenia may, in
part, be reflective of the epidemiological variation of the Indian population. The finding of
monocytosis in our study has not been documented in other studies.

Out of the 32 cases, 8 cases (25.8%) had eosinopenia. Our findings matched with a single Chinese
study, which also highlights eosinopenia as a significant prognosticating factor20. The study
proposes Eosinopenia as a potentially more reliable laboratory predictor of SARS-CoV-2
infection than recommended “leukocyte counts” and “lymphopenia”20

From a study conducted in Huizhou, China of the 30 COVID 19 cases, it was concluded that
patients with markedly elevated platelets and longer average hospitalization days might be related
to the cytokine storm. The Platelet Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) of the patients means the degree of
cytokine storm, which might provide a new indicator in the monitoring in patients with COVID19 21, 22. In our study, we had 8 cases (25.8 %) with thrombocytopenia, and only one case (3.2%)
had mild thrombocytosis. However, the relevance of platelet count and PLR can only be
interpreted if follow up samples at different time points in a large cohort are available.
The Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a biomarker for the assessment of the severity of
bacterial infections and the prognosis of patients with pneumonia and tumor.NLR may serve as a
surrogate marker of early risk identification in COVID 19 infection. In a study by Forget et al. 23,
it was identified that normal NLR values in an adult, non-geriatric population in good health are
between 0.78 and 3.53. Whereas, in another study by Jingyuan Liu24, it was concluded that
Patients with age ≥50 having NRL ≥3.13 are at risk of severe illness, and they should get rapid
access to the intensive care unit, if necessary.
In our analysis, 6 cases were seen with baseline NLR above the cut off 3.13. This was not
statistically significant. However, out of the 6 cases, 3 cases were symptomatic with high NLR
both in baseline CBC and on follow up after 14 days, which was statistically significant.
In an accepted article to the editor, Bingwen Eugene Fan et al25 mentioned that in their study
population in Singapore, microscopic peripheral blood film examination shows a higher number
of patients who are lymphopenic & have the presence of a few reactive lymphocytes, a subset of
which appears to be lymphoplasmacytoid. Peripheral blood smear examination in our cases
showed a predominantly normocytic normochromic picture with few cases showing toxic
granules in neutrophils while occasional case showed activated lymphoid cells, the finding which
was matching with that of Bingwen Eugene Fan et al. study25.

This finding is in contrast with the study conducted during the Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 200326, where reactive lymphocytes were not observed in the
peripheral blood film examination of the SARS patients in Singapore and only in 15.2% of cases
in a similar study in Hong Kong27.

From the study, it could be concluded that baseline CBC parameters of all the 32 cases presenting
with mild to moderate symptoms did not show any statistically significant variation in the
parameters that may substantially mark their clinical progress or severity. Also, there is no

statistically significant difference in the lab parameters between males and females at the baseline
visit. One reason for this observation could be due to the limited sample size or early
/asymptomatic/mild presentation of COVID cases.
In the follow-up group, the lab values at Follow-up visit one are not showing any statistically
significant difference in the CBC parameters. A statistically significant increment in the lab
parameters like TLC, neutrophils, monocytes was seen while increasing lymphopenia, and
developing eosinopenia was also seen in is follow-up visit 2 & visit 3. Platelet count and
hemoglobin levels remained unchanged even with disease progression in our study. The
statistically significant increment in the CBC parameters in this follow up group was correlating
with the patient clinical status. A small follow up group is a statistical limitation of our study. A
follow-up analysis of CBC Parameters of a large Indian cohort is suggested to statistically prove
the association of parameters with prognosis.
In a recently discussed paper, it is suggested that in addition to various mechanisms, SARS-CoV2 viral protein infects hemoglobin by the immune hemolysis of red blood cells28.
However, in our study, the baseline RBC count and hemoglobin levels were not changed in all the
32 cases and in the 3 follow up cases on 1st, 2nd, 3rd reading.

These statistically insignificant findings of baseline CBC in Indian population with a stable
clinical course as compared to other foreign data are promising and could explain worse COVID19 outcome in western countries, unlike India which is leading globally in disease containment
with only 12759 cased,1515 recoveries and only 420 deaths compared to world data of 1,40,773
deaths (0.29% of the world deaths). However, a relevant trend in follows up CBC in a large
Indian cohort might predict the disease progression and prognosis.

Limitation of the Study: There may be missing laboratory data as CBC investigation was not
performed daily on all patients, especially those who are minimally symptomatic and improving
in the general Isolation Ward. Also, a very low sample size of follow up as well as no follow up
cases analyzed is a big limitation for definitive statistical findings.

CONCLUSION:
The study of 32 COVID-19 cases of Indian population shows that majority of the patients are
younger, have asymptomatic to mild clinical presentation, and a higher incidence in the female
population. The majority of pediatric cases have mild symptomology with a stable clinical course.

-Baseline CBC findings of all the cases show mild neutrophilia, mild lymphopenia, eosinopenia,
mild monocytosis, and a normal to mild thrombocytopenia. However, the statistical distributions
of the parameters were within the normal range without any association of disease progression.
Peripheral blood smear examination in our cases showed a predominantly normocytic
normochromic picture with few cases showing toxic granules in neutrophils while the occasional
case showed activated lymphoid cells.
-A significant statistical trend of increase in CBC parameters, NLR, was noted in follow up cases
with persistent symptoms; however, a larger follow-up cohort is needed to arrive at a statistical
significance.
- Anemia was not noted in baseline CBC and in the follow-up group.
-A onetime PLR is not indicative of disease progression.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Current literature review documents the epidemiological and hematological parameter alteration of
the COVID-19 patients in the Chinese and the western population, thereby perpetuating a
knowledge deficit in the Indian population where the pandemic is spreading over time.
Added value of this study
The study obtained data from 32 COVID-19 cases in NOIDA, India to explore the epidemiology
and the baseline and follow up hematological parameters of the patients. The pilot study provides
further information on the demographic and laboratory hematological parameters of the patients
thereby adding substantial inputs to the knowledge data base.
Implication of the outcome of the present study
The present study shows that in India majority of the cases have asymptomatic to mild clinical
presentation with female outnumbered the male and a majority of pediatric cases have mild
symptomology with stable clinical course. No statistically significant baseline hematology
parameters alteration was noted in the study group however follow up cases show statistical
significance in the parameters.
The slightly different epidemiological and hematological pattern of the Indian cases will help the
clinicians and the researchers for better understanding of the disease pattern with timely
management of the epidemic.

COVER LETTER
Respected Sir/Madam,
This is to request you to kindly consider my manuscript/original article titled’ The Neutrophil
Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Platelet Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) and routine hematological
parameters of COVID-19 Patient : A perspective of the Indian scenario from a frontline
pilot study of 32 COVID-19 cases in a Tertiary Care Institute of North India.’ In your
esteemed platform for publication. There is no conflict of interest and all authors have contributed
in the formulation of this manuscript. This manuscript has only been communicated to this
platform at present.
NEED OF THE STUDY
Evidence before this study
Current literature review documents the epidemiological and hematological parameter alteration
of the COVID-19 patients in the Chinese and the western population, thereby perpetuating a
knowledge deficit in the Indian population where the pandemic is spreading over time.
Added value of this study
The study obtained data from 32 COVID-19 cases in NOIDA, India to explore the epidemiology
and the baseline and follow up hematological parameters of the patients. The pilot study provides
further information on the demographic and laboratory hematological parameters of the patients
thereby adding substantial inputs to the knowledge data base.
Implication of the outcome of the present study
The present study shows that in India majority of the cases have asymptomatic to mild clinical
presentation with female outnumbered the male and a majority of pediatric cases have mild
symptomology with stable clinical course. No statistically significant baseline hematology
parameters alteration was noted in the study group however follow up cases show statistical
significance in the parameters.
The slightly different epidemiological and hematological pattern of the Indian cases will help the
clinicians and the researchers for better understanding of the disease pattern with timely
management of the epidemic.

Regards
Dr Devajit Nath
