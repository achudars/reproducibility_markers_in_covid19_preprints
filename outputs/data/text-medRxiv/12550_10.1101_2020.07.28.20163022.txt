Severity prediction of COVID-19 remains one of the major clinical challenges for the
ongoing pandemic. Here, we have recruited a 144 COVID-19 patient cohort consisting of
training, validation, and internal test sets, longitudinally recorded 124 routine clinical and
laboratory parameters, and built a machine learning model to predict the disease progression
based on measurements from the first 12 days since the disease onset when no patient became
severe. A panel of 11 routine clinical factors, including oxygenation index, basophil counts,
aspartate aminotransferase, gender, magnesium, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, platelet
counts, activated partial thromboplastin time, oxygen saturation, body temperature and days
after symptom onset, constructed a classifier for COVID-19 severity prediction, achieving
accuracy of over 94%. Validation of the model in an independent cohort containing 25
patients achieved accuracy of 80%. The overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were
0.70, 0.99, 0.93 and 0.93, respectively. Our model captured predictive dynamics of LDH and
CK while their levels were in the normal range. This study presents a practical model for
timely severity prediction and surveillance for COVID-19, which is freely available at
webserver https://guomics.shinyapps.io/covidAI/.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, poses an
unprecedented public health crisis to the entire world. The basic reproductive rate (R0) of 2.02.5 in COVID-19 is higher than in SARS (1.7–1.9) and MERS (<1) 1. To date, SARS-CoV-2
has spread to more than 200 countries and regions around the world, with over 16 million
individuals infected. Most confirmed cases are classified as mild or moderate, while the other
14% and 5% are severe and critical cases, respectively 2. These patients need to be
hospitalized and monitored with intensive care to prevent deterioration of the disease that may
lead to fatality without timely diagnosis and treatment.
Currently, diagnosis of COVID-19 mainly depends on the virus RNA test of SARSCOV-2 3. This is a qualitative test showing whether the patient is infected or not 4. Besides,
computed tomography (CT) is a complementary strategy for COVID-19 diagnosis by
showing the image of pneumonia symptoms in lungs 5. As a physical image entity, CT can
supplement with objective observations to indicate the severity of COVID-19 patients in an
AI-assisted model 6. This helps stratify the severity of COVID-19 at an early stage of disease
progression. However, about 20% of COVID-19 patients show no obvious imaging changes
in the lung7, bringing difficulties to physicians when making decisions for suitable clinical
treatments. To better evaluate the disease conditions of COVID-19 patients, routine laboratory
tests including but not limited to complete blood cell counts, blood laboratory metabolomics
tests are taken regularly by physicians. Physicians then make clinical decisions and prescribe
treatments accordingly. However, this is laborious and sometimes biased, depending on the

physician’s own experience, especially when facing with such a heavy medical burden in the
pandemic. Therefore, automatic integration and interpretation of routine laboratory indexes in
an unbiased way will make a pivotal role in severity stratification and prognosis evaluation
for COVID-19 patients.
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, research focusing on building severity
prediction models of COVID-19 based on related features have been reported extensively to
support medical decision making8. Several clinical features, such as age, gender, lactic
dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and lymphocyte count, have been reported
to be highly correlated with the severity of COVID-19 patients 8. Recently, a Chinese team
found that three key features (LDH, CRP and lymphocyte) can be used to predict the
mortality of COVID-19 with over 90% accuracy 9. Although all models have been reported
with great predictability, they have also raised concerns of bias in prediction because of key
factors including poor selection of samples, inappropriate statistical methods, etc 8. In a paper
published by Liang et al, a risk scoring algorithm based on some key characteristics of
COVID-19 patients at the time of admission to the hospital was developed, which may assist
in predicting a patient’s risk of developing into critical illness10. More recently, they also built
a survival model to allow early prediction of critical cases by comorbidity and several
laboratory indexes 11. These models are mainly built on a dataset either containing static
information at certain time points, for example, upon admission or discharge, mostly when the
patients were in severe or critical status. However, the time from symptom onset to admission
varied in a large range due to different local medical resources and personal medical treatment
intention. In contrast, the time of onset of symptoms as a starting point is more objective and
reasonable. During the pandemic, personal physical condition and laboratory indicators are
constantly changing, however, few models make use of longitudinal measurement to predict
disease severity. Therefore, it remains challenging to stratify the risk rank of a patient when
she/he is in the transient stage of mild to the early severe stage, due to the lack of robust tests
to detect the impalpable and subtle changes inside the patient.
In this study, we built a machine learning model based on the longitudinal measurement
of 124 clinical factors in a retrospective cohort containing 144 COVID-19 patients to predict
the disease severity. 11 key clinical factors were featured as a panel to be highly associated
with COVID-19 severity, instead of isolated features. The model achieved an overall 93%
accuracy in distinguishing severe patients among the infected cases in all dataset. The
prediction model is freely accessible online as a Shiny Server App
(https://guomics.shinyapps.io/covidAI/) to facilitate the early detection of the patients.

Clinical characteristics of the study cohort
A total of 841 patients have been screened with the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test from
January 17 to March 10, 2020 in Taizhou Hospital, with 144 patients with positive virus RNA
(COVID-19) and 697 non-COVID-19 individuals (Figure 1A). From the non-COVID-19
group, outpatients and patients lacking chest CT results were excluded. 65 patients were

recruited as the control group, with their epidemiological information collected. Meanwhile,
144 COVID-19 patients were stratified into severe (N = 36) and non-severe (N = 108)
patients based on the clinical diagnosis guideline 7 (Figure 1A). 124 types of measurements
from 17 categories over 52 days were collected and manually curated for these 144 COVID19 patients, resulting in a data matrix containing of 3,065 readings for 124 types of
measurements (3065*124). The 17 categories of data included basic information, clinical
symptoms and signs, chest CT results and laboratory tests, as detailed in Table S1 that were
regularly recorded during their hospitalization.
This cohort has 55.6% male in the severe COVID-19 group and 52.8% male in the nonsevere COVID-19 group. The median age was 55.0 years for the severe group, and 44.5 years
for the non-severe group. The median BMI was 25.5 in the severe group and 23.8 in the nonsevere group (Table 1). These parameters are in consistent with previous observations 12.
The most common symptom at disease onset was fever (64.8% in non-severe and 94.4%
in the severe group), followed by cough and pharyngalgia (Table 1). Before admission, 40.2%
of patients had underlying diseases and the ratio is substantially higher in the severe group
(50.0%) than that in the non-severe group (37.0%). Hypertension (15.3%) and diabetes
(9.7%) were common comorbidities.
Upon admission, 142 (98.6 %) COVID-19 patients had image changes in chest CT.
Pulmonary plaque was the top 1 abnormal pattern (52.8%), with ratios of abnormality of
66.7% for severe patients and 48.2% for non-severe patients, respectively. The second
abnormal pattern was ground-glass like symptoms (severe vs. non-severe was 41.7% vs.
31.5 %). Ratios of pulmonary fibrosis and consolidation did not show a statistical difference
between severe patients and non-severe ones.
In severe patients, intervals from onset and admission to the diagnosis of severe cases
were 9 (5-12) days and 2 (1-3) days. All 144 patients were followed up during their entire
course in hospital. In this study, only one patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU)
and underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. They were all cured and discharged
eventually. The mean length of stay for the patients was 20 days for non-severe group and 23
days for severe group, respectively. In summary, this is a well-annotated and curated COVID19 cohort with comprehensively and systematically recorded information from the disease
onset till convalesce and discharge, which provided the potential for subsequent model
construction.

Feature selection and machine learning
To establish a model for severity prediction, we firstly filtered the matrix including
3065*124 readings for all patients over 52 days in total (Figure 1B). For the first step, the
readings with definite diagnosis for severe COVID-19 were excluded. Then the readings
recorded from symptom onset to the 12th day for all patients were included for severity
prediction by machine learning, in which the ratio of severe verse non-severe was close to
20% prevalence of severe cases according to previous studies 2. It is worthy of noting that at
this time point (12th day), no patients had been clinically diagnosed as severe COVID-19
cases. After removing readings with more than 90% missing values, a much smaller data
matrix containing 358*124 readings remained. The discovery dataset contained 228*124

readings collected from patients admitted before 1 February, 2020, while the test dataset
containing 130*124 readings from patients admitted after 1 February, 2020. were generated.
Based on the discovery dataset, a machine learning model was built up by cross training and
validation (Figure 1B). To further test our model, we also collected an independent dataset
from another clinical center, employing the same criteria with the previous one (Figure 1C).
The process of modeling contained three parts, including feature selection, model
training and prediction (Figure 2A). In detail, firstly, the missing value for each test item in
the discovery dataset was filled with a relevant median value for each gender (F or M). We
randomly generated feature combinations and loaded the data with selected features. Then
feature selection was performed by using genetic algorithm (GA) 13, one of the most advanced
and widely used algorithm for feature selection, assisted with 10-fold cross-validation in the
discovery dataset including both training (9/10) and validation (1/10) sets. The method of GA
which selected a panel of features could avoid being trapped into local optimal solution. As a
result, a panel of eleven key clinical factors that are associated with COVID-19 severity was
evolved from 124 characteristics, and were put into the ‘Active Feature Pool’.
Then we applied the selected features and established the classifier by using the support
vector machine (SVM) 14. In this step, we set up 10 random seeds and the SVM model was
trained in the training set (8/10) and then validated in the validation set (2/10). The hyperparameters of model and threshold were optimized to maximize accuracy. The threshold was
set at 0.45, which was determined by maximizing the correct rate of diagnosis in the
validation set. Via this way, a trained SVM model including the eleven active features and
classifier was generated for predicting severe cases in the test dataset (130*124) and an
independent test dataset (25*11) using the same threshold of 0.45 (Figure 2A).
To interpret the importance of each individual feature applied in the model, SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm 15,16 was performed. The eleven features,
oxygenation index, basophil counts (BASO#), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gender,
magnesium (Mg), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), platelet counts, activated partial
thromboplastin time (APTT), oxygen saturation (SaO2), body temperature and days of
symptom onset, were then arranged according to their importance to the model evaluating by
SHAP values (Figure 2B). The results showed that oxygenation index was the most important
one with a SHAP value of 0.94 in our model. In clinical practice, oxygenation index is also a
critical factor to evaluate the state of disease severity.
Furthermore, nine features with continuous records (12 days) were selected and
compared in severe and non-severe groups. Their median values (discovery dataset) were
calculated and showed in boxplots (Figure 2C). Six of nine features were significantly (pvalue less than 0.05) dysregulated. Among them, oxygen index and SaO2 were decreased in
severe cases. This was directly associated with pulmonary function. Two selected features,
AST and GGT, were statistically up-regulated, indicating that COVID-19 may induce slight
hepatic injury in the early stage. Although within the normal range, the count of platelets was
reduced significantly in severe cases. Three characteristics, namely APTT, Mg and BASO#,
showed no significant change between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients, a
comprehensive comparison was further performed. As shown in Figure S1, readings from
four groups of individuals, severe COVID-19, non-severe COVID-19, non-COVID-19

patients with flu-like symptoms and healthy people with physical examination were included
for systematic comparison. The data showed that APTT was substantially up-regulated in
severe COVID-19 group in the entire dataset including the discovery and the test datasets, and
the count of basophils was decreased in all COVID-19 patients compared with healthy group.
However, Mg showed no difference across all four groups. To validate the importance of Mg
in the model, we used the rest ten features except of Mg and investigated the performance of
the model in ROC (Figure S2). The AUC values were the same in training and validation
dataset and only decreased 0.01 in test dataset without the feature of Mg, which indicated
little contribution of Mg to the model.
The remaining two indicators not shown in the box diagram were days of symptom onset
and gender. There is no surprise that the earlier outstood because when the patients were
evolving from non-severe to severe status, the symptoms grew worse. Gender was selected as
another important feature. In our dataset, male patients were more likely to be infected SARSCoV-2 than female patients in both non-severe and severe groups, in consistent with the
literature reporting that male COVID-19 patients had a worse outcome and that 70% of
patients died of COVID-19 were male in an Italy cohort 17. The vulnerability of males has
also been found in SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003 18. It has been recently found that the plasma
concentration of ACE2, a functional receptor for SARC-CoV-2 infection, is higher in men
than in women as detected in two independent cohorts 19. This may explain the association
between gender and fatality rate of COVID-19. Meanwhile, females develop enhanced innate
and adaptive immune responses than males did, thus they are less susceptible to kinds of
infections of bacterial, viral, parasitic, and fungal origin and malignancies 20. In fact, the
clinical manifestations of infectious or autoimmune diseases and malignant tumors differ
between men and women.

Severity prediction by machine learning
The model assigned a score (from 0 to 1) to indicate the likelihood of disease severity,
and higher score indicated greater severity. The model is described in details in Methods,
while the data are shown in the scatter plot (Figure 3A). In this study, samples with a score
greater than 0.45 was identified as a severe state. The receiver operating characteristics
(ROC) plot achieved an area under the curve (AUC) value of 1.00 and 0.98 for training and
validation datasets, respectively (Figure 3B). 224 out of 228 samples were correctly identified
with an accuracy of 0.98 for the discovery dataset. The sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 0.90, 0.99, 0.96 and 0.99,
respectively (Figure 3C).
To further evaluate the performance of the 11-clinical feature classifier, we analyzed
130*124 readings in the test dataset and 25*11 readings in the independent test dataset from a
different hospital. The classifier achieved AUC value of 0.89 (Figure 3B), and correctly
classified 112 of 130 readings with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 0.86,
0.56, 0.98, 0.91 and 0.85. Sixteen of 18 incorrectly classified readings were from severe
COVID-19 group, especially in early stage of COVID-19 which showed similar clinical signs
with non-severe group. Most of the incorrect predictions (10 of 18 readings) were from four
COVID-19 patients, indicating individual effect on the model. As to the independent test

dataset of much smaller size, the classifier achieved an AUC value of 0.75, and accuracy,
sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 0.80, 0.64, 0.93, 0.69 and 0.91, respectively (Figure
3C). All incorrectly identified cases in this dataset belonged to early stage of COVID-19 with
days of symptom onset less than 8 days.
We also examined the performance of the model from the longitudinal perspective. The
test dataset was divided into three parts according to the length of symptom lasting period
since disease onset. In general, the longer the disease progressed, the better the model
predicted. As the onset time increased, the accuracy of prediction elevated from 0.79 (1-4
days), 0.82 (5-8 days) to 0.91 (9-12 days) in the test set (Figure 3D). There were two
incorrectly identified readings in non-severe patients. They were both from the initial three
days since onset, probably due to the low oxygen index (less than 380) which was out of the
normal range (400-500). As to the part of 9-12 days, three readings of severe group were
classified into non-severe group, while two of them were scored with 0.42 and 0.44, which
were very close to the threshold.

Dynamic changes of key clinical features over 7 weeks
The unique curated longitudinal data permitted detailed temporal investigation of
specific parameters. We investigated the temporal changes of the eight out of eleven key
clinical features in both severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients during the first 40 days
since disease onset. In addition, we also analyzed 18 more clinical features (Figure 4) that
found to be related to the progression of COVID-19 disease 8,21,22.
Based on longitudinal changes of blood cell counts (such as platelet), our data showed
that the severity of the disease intensified in the second week since symptom onset (Figure 4).
The counts of platelets, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils were reduced in the severe
group, while neutrophils and WBC were dramatically elevated (Figure 4).
Decreased number of lymphocytes has been reported in association with the COVID-19
severity 23, probably due to apoptosis and necrosis of lymphocytes 24. Dysregulation of
neutrophils was another predominant alteration in the complete blood count test. Neutrophils
are recruited early to sites of infection where they kill pathogens (bacteria, fungi, and viruses)
by oxidative burst and phagocytosis 25.
A significant rise in neutrophil counts features the severity of COVID-19. Increase of
neutrophils may induce formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) which could trigger
a cascade of inflammatory reactions 26. The latter destroys surrounding tissues, facilitates
micro thrombosis, and results in permanent organ injuries to the pulmonary, cardiovascular,
and renal systems 25, which are three commonly affected organ systems in severe COVID-19
27
.
Eosinophils were drastically reduced after SARS-CoV-2 infection and were merely
detectable in the acute stage (Figure 4). The increase of eosinophil in non-severe patients
happened earlier than that in severe cases, suggesting that the increase of eosinophils can be
the signs for COVID-19 recovery. The predictive value of Eosinophil count observed in our
study is supported by a recent independent study 28. The count of Basophils is another
predictive feature from our model. Basophils are the least abundant granulocytes, representing
less than 1% of peripheral blood leukocytes. Recent studies have shown that the count of

basophils was reduced in COVID-19 patients 29, agreeing with our data. Moreover, an
independent study which proposed a multivariate Cox regression model exploring risk factors
for lethal COVID-19 patients also nominated progressive increase of basophils 30.
Coagulation dysfunction has been found in multiple epidemiologic studies of COVID-19
27,31
. Our data showed that platelet counts in blood decreased in severe patients significantly
(Figure 4), in consistent with previous meta-analysis reporting low platelet count as a risk
factor for COVID-19 severity and mortality 32. Furthermore, coagulation related parameters
such as D-dimer elevated too, especially in death cases 31. Thrombin time (TT) and APTT are
often used to monitor the coagulation function of patients, which are mostly increased in the
presence of heparin or heparin-like substances.
CRP is an acute-phase protein, expression level of which in blood is associated with the
severity of inflammation 33. As an indicator of infection, in our dataset, CRP was significantly
increased in both mild and severe cases, far beyond the normal range. CRP decreased as the
disease progressed and recovered.
We also evaluated functions of organs since it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2
infection systematically induced multi-organ dysfunctions, such as lung, liver, kidney and
heart, particularly in severe and critical cases 34,35. The commonly used indicators in clinic
include pulmonary function indicators including SaO2, blood-gas lactate (LAC) and oxygen
index, liver function indicators (GGT, AST and ALT), renal function indicators (eGFR and
creatinine) and cardiac function indicator (LDH), were monitored. Arterial blood gas (ABG)
analysis is a key approach to evaluate the function of lungs by measuring acidity and the level
of oxygen and carbon dioxide, which provides important indexes and direct evidence for
indicating pulmonary function and the severity of COVID-19. Our data showed that oxygenrelated indexes, namely SaO2 and oxygen index, decreased in severe COVID-19 patients
(Figure 4), suggesting a high degree of sensitivity for severity prediction and thus selected as
pivotal features in our model. The level of blood-gas LAC reached peak in the first 10 days in
severe group, agreeing with the literature 21.
Regarding to liver functions, the dynamic change of GGT, AST and ALT showed that
hepatic functions got worse around the third week (Figure 4). Moreover, levels of the three
indexes were higher in severe patients than in non-severe patients from the beginning of the
disease. This may be partly due to the side effect of multi-drug administration according to
ALT and GGT level. AST was a predominant feature in our predictive model. which was
elevated in the severe group. A multicenter retrospective study including 5771 adult patients
reported that AST increased first, followed by ALT in severe cases with liver injury. This
alternation was associated with dysregulation of lymphocyte and neutrophil counts 36, the
latter were selected by our model as well.
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is a direct indicator of renal function and its
level in severe patients was significantly lower than that in non-severe patients. On the
opposite, the level of urea was elevated in severe group in the early stage (first 10 days),
while remained stable in non-severe group. Electrolytes were also closely related to renal
function, and most of them were within the reference interval except for sodium and
magnesium in severe group (Figure 4C).
LDH is widely expressed in various organs and it has been reported as a key cardiac

marker closely associated with COVID-19 severity 37. In our study, LDH peaked around the
10th day in severe COVID-19 patients comparing with non-severe cases, although the peak
value did not exceed the upper limit of the normal range of LDH for males. Another cardiac
indicator, CK, was also in normal range, however, its dynamics differed between severe and
non-severe patients.

In summary, we built a customized machine learning model for COVID-19 severity
prediction based on the longitudinal measurement of the feature clinical factors over time.
The model provided a classifier composed of 11 routine clinical features which are widely
available during COVID-19 management. which could predict the prognosis and may guide
the medical care of COVID-19 patients. Although some interesting alterations have been
found, the major limitation of the present study is the limited patient cohort recruited and the
relatively smaller size of it. Therefore, the model still needs to be validated in sizeable cohorts
from multiple clinical centers.

From January 17 to March 10 in 2020, we collected clinical and laboratory data for 144
patients in Taizhou Public Hygiene Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province who were
diagnosed as COVID-19 infected patients by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) and chest CT according to the Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Scheme for
New Coronary Virus Infections (Trial Edition 5, Revision). Clinical data for these patients

were curated from the hospital information system (HIS) and included epidemiology, clinical
data such as gender, age, BMI, underlying diseases, chest CT, presenting symptoms and
length of stay (LOS). Laboratory data included complete blood count, blood chemistry panel,
blood clotting test, cytokine panel blood test and arterial blood gas test. Twenty-five
independent test readings were collected from Shaoxing People’s Hospital according to the
same criteria with the Taizhou test set. This study was approved by the Medical Ethics
Committee of Taizhou Hospital and Westlake University, Zhejiang province of China, and
informed consent was obtained from each enrolled subject. Besides, the case of minors
enrolled in the study was approved by parents and/or legal guardian.

Blood samples were collected at each time point since admission. 2 mL EDTA-K2
anticoagulant peripheral blood samples were measured for blood routine test using a Sysmex
2100D routine hematology analyzer (Kobe, Japan). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was
calculated using the Alifax Test 1 automatic ESR analyzer (UDINE, Italy). Cytokines and
lymphocyte subsets were measured using BD FACSCantoTM II within 6 hours. Sodium
citrate plasma samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min. Coagulation parameters
were determined using a Sysmex CS 5100i automatic hemagglutination analyzer (Kobe,
Japan). Arterial blood gas analysis was performed using GEM Premier 3500 (Instrumentation
Laboratory, US).
Serum samples were centrifuged at 2500-3000 rpm for 5-10 min for measuring
biochemical data including electrolyte, liver and kidney functional proteins, immunoglobulin
serial index, blood lipid and glucose, myocardial enzymes(except myoglobin, creatine kinase
MB and troponin-I), and infection index (except procalcitonin) using Beckman automatic
biochemical analyzer (AU5821). Myoglobin, creatine kinase MB and troponin-I were
detected by Beckman automatic immunological analyzer (UniCel DxI-800). Procalcitonin
(PCT) levels were determined using the Roche Cobas e411 electrochemiluminescence
analyzer (Basel, Switzerland).
Nasopharyngeal and sputum specimens collected during hospitalization were sent to the
PCR laboratory (BIOSafety Laboratory II) in a biosafety transportation box. Total nucleic
acid extraction from the samples was performed using Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit (Shanghai
Zhijiang) and qRT-PCR was performed using a commercial kit specific for 2019-nCoV
detection (triple fluorescence PCR, Shanghai Zhijiang, China, NO. P20200105) approved by
the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA).

All patients had a chest CT examination at the time of admission. For each patient, the
chest CT was performed once a week during the period of her/his hospitalization. A CT
examination was also operated at the time of her/his discharge. The points of CT score is
defined by the following rules. Based on the lesion involvement and lesion properties, each
infected lobe adds one point. Presence of ground-glass opacity adds one point. Two points
were added in the presence of consolidation lesions, while three points were added in case of
fibrosis lesions. The score was reduced by 0.5 point if the CT is improved compared to the

The data matrix was divided into a discovery dataset and a test dataset according to the
admission date. This method defined the samples collected before February 2 as the discovery
dataset and the samples collected after February 2 as the test dataset. Feature selection and
model training were performed in the discovery dataset. The model was then tested in the test
dataset and independent test dataset for evaluation.
The data analysis included four steps: data preprocessing, feature selection, model
training and testing. In the data preprocessing step, all missing values were first filled with a
median value of all patients. Then as normalization, the mean value of all features in the
discovery set was converted to 0 and the standard deviation was converted to 1. The same
normalization parameters were applied to the test set. In the feature selection step, the
standard GA method in the Python deap library is used. Set the gene locus in the method as
the index of the feature, and set the length of the gene chain to 20 (this indicates that the
method can select up to 20 different features). Set the crossover probability to 0.3, the
mutation probability to 0.5, the number of genes in the population to 500, and the number of
iterations to 30. The accuracy rate of the 10-fold cross-validation on the verification set was
taken as the fitness of the gene chain. Finally, we selected 11 non-repeated and effective
features. In the model training step, the discovery dataset was divided into training set and the
validation set. The training set was used to train the model, while the validation set was used
to optimize the model parameters.
Afterwards, the test dataset was used to test the model for the prediction accuracy. The
SVM model with ‘rbf’ kernal in Python's sklearn library was employed. The regularization
parameter C was set to 1.2. The kernel coefficient gamma was set to 'auto'. The random state
was set to 1. We have optimized the above parameters.
The detection result of patient 𝑖 on a certain feature is 𝐷!,# , then the data composed of
the selected features of the patient is 𝐷! . Then we have 𝐷! = {𝐷!,#! , 𝐷!,#" , 𝐷!,## , ⋯ , 𝐷!,#$ } as
the number of selected features. Enter 𝐷! into the trained model 𝑀(⋅), and the model will
output a predicted score 𝑆! .
𝑆! = 𝑀(𝐷! )
We made the diagnosis based on predicted score 𝑆! .

When 𝑌! is 1, patient 𝑖 is diagnosed as severe. When 𝑌! is 0, patient 𝑖 is diagnosed as
mild. 𝑇 is the threshold for diagnosis.
Due to the heterogeneity of the positive and negative samples, it is not possible to
directly use 𝑇 = 0.5 for diagnosis. The threshold 𝑇 is therefore determined by maximizing
the correct rate of diagnosis in the validation set, and the same 𝑇 was applied to the
evaluation test set.

and the Mann-Whitney U statistics for non-normally distributed variables. P-value in boxplot
was calculated by the unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test and in violin plot p-value was adjusted
by Benjamini & Hochberg. The smooth plot was fitted by locally estimated scatterplot
smoothing (LOESS) using the geom smooth function in ggplot. PPV and NPV were adjusted
by ratio of severe cases followed by published formula 38. SPSS (version 19.0) was used for
baseline characteristics.
