Abstract

25

Background and Objective

26

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) manifests as multiple clinical and pathological organ

27

dysfunctions. It also disrupts metabolic profile due to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines

28

causing a systemic inflammation reaction. However, the development and correlation of

29

dyslipidemia with acute phase reactants is unknown. This investigation was performed to assess

30

the pathological alterations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density

31

lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides, and total cholesterol levels in COVID-19 patients.

32

Methods

33

This was a prospective study performed on real-world patients to assess serum levels of LDL-C,

34

HDL, TG, TC on COVID-19 patients (mild: 319; moderate: 391; critical: 357) hospitalized at

35

our center between April 2020 through January 2021. Age- and gender-matched controls who

36

had their lipid profiles in the same period were included as the control group.

37

Results

38

LDL-C, HDL, TG, and TC levels were significantly lower in COVID-19 patients when

39

compared with the control group (P < 0.001, 0.047, 0.045, < 0.001, respectively). All parameters

40

decreased gradually with COVID-19 disease severity (LDL-C: median (IQR), mild: 98 (91,134);

41

moderate: 97 (81,113); critical: 68 (68,83); HDL: mild: 45 (37,50); moderate: 46 (41,50);

42

critical: 40 (37,46); TG: mild: 186 (150,245); moderate: 156 (109,198); critical: 111 (98,154);

43

TC: mild: 224 (212,238); moderate: 212 (203,213); critical: 154 (125,187)). LDL-C, TC, and TG

44

were inversely correlated with acute phase reactants (interleukin-6 (IL-6), Procalcitonin, C-

reactive protein (CRP), and D-dimers). Logistic regression demonstrated lipid profile, thyroid

46

profile, and acute phase reactants as predictors of severity of COVID-19 disease.

47

Conclusion

48

Hypolipidemia develops in increasing frequency with severe COVID-19 disease. It inversely

49

correlates with levels of acute-phase reactants, indicating SARS-COV-2 as the causative agent

50

for alteration in lipid and thyroid levels.

Introduction

53

Coronaviruses include a large family of viruses notorious for causing a multitude of diseases in

54

humans, ranging from common flu to more serious conditions like Middle Eastern Respiratory

55

Syndrome (MERS) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [1]. The causative agent for

56

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) that causes

57

various manifestations of the disease, involving the respiratory, gastrointestinal, hematological,

58

endocrine, and cardiovascular systems [2,3]. Even after the mitigation measure, the estimated

59

basic reproduction (R0) ranges from 2.24 to 3.58 and the mortality rate of COVID-19 is

60

considered to be 2.3% [4,5,6]. World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a

61

pandemic and initiated a global emergency from 11th March 2020 [7].

62

SARS-COV-2 is a positive-stranded RNA virus with an envelope of lipid bilayer, and a genome

63

of approximately 30,000 nucleotides. On an electron microscope four major proteins have been

64

identified as an integral part of the virus: the nucleocapsids (N) protein, the crown or spike (S)

65

protein, the membrane (M) protein, and the envelope (E) protein [8]. These proteins play an

66

important role in human infectivity and among them, the S protein mediates attachment to

human hosts via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors [9]. An expression of ACE

68

2, in combination with transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRESS2), seems to be the key

69

cellular mechanism for human infection [10].

70

In SARS-COV-2, lipids are an essential component for maintaining the integrity of the viral

71

membrane and its fusion to the host cells, viral replication, endo/exocytosis, and human host

72

infiltration. Some preliminary reports have described lipid abnormalities associated with the

73

severity of disease in COVID-19 [11,12]. Therefore, this investigation was aimed to assess the

74

lipid profile and its correlation with other biochemical tests used to predict the severity of

75

COVID-19.

76

Methods

77

Study design and patient demographics

78

This prospective study was carried out at Infectious Disease Block, Advanced Diagnostics and

79

Liver Center, Rawalpindi, and was approved by the Review Committee (Study ID#ADC/20/006)

80

of Advanced Diagnostics and Liver Center according to the ethical principles of the Declaration

81

of Helsinki. Written, informed consent was taken from all the participants/guardians before data

82

collection. A total of 1,755 patients were enrolled in this investigation: 1067 with COVID-19 and

83

688 healthy adults as controls from April 2020 through January 2021. All the data regarding

84

demographics, epidemiology, comorbidities, laboratory tests, and hospital stay were extracted

85

electronically. SARS-COV-2 positive patients were confirmed using real-time reverse

86

transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Pneumonia was classified according to the

87

guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as labeled as mild, moderate, or

88

severe on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans according to our previous study

[13]. HRCT was considered positive if it demonstrated consolidation, septal thickening, linear

90

opacities, crazy-paving pattern, or halo sign. Mild disease was classified as less than 10% lung

91

involvement with normal room oxygen saturation. Moderate cases were classified as less than

92

50% lung involvement on HRCT with respiratory rate of >30 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation

93

of < 90% at rest requiring <10 ml/min of oxygen. Those requiring >10 ml/min of oxygen and/or

94

ventilatory support were labeled as critical cases. Age- and gender-matched healthy adults, who

95

had their lipid profile panel done at our clinic were included as controls. Their data were not

96

identified and only age, gender, BMI, and lipid profile were extracted.

97

Laboratory tests

98

All the laboratory tests were carries out at our certified laboratory in Advance Diagnostics under

99

the standard procedures of the Punjab Healthcare Commission. Hemoglobin (Hgb), and white

100

blood cells (WBC) were performed on a Sysmex automated hematology analyzer (XN-3100™).

101

Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), low-density lipoprotein

102

cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides

103

(TG) were tested on Cobas® c3011 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics). Free triiodothyronine (T3),

104

free thyroxine (T4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Procalcitonin

105

were analyzed via electrochemiluminescent immunoassay (ECLIA) in the Elecsys® 2010

106

immunoassay system. All parameters were compared between the COVID-19 classification. In

107

addition, the lipid profile was compared between the control group and COVID-19. All tests

108

were drawn in a fasting state from the blood samples on admission.

109

Statistical analysis

110

Data were analyzed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 (IBM

111

Corp, Armonk, NY, USA.). Normally distributed continuous variables were presented as mean ±

112

standard deviation (SD) while Non-normally distributed variables as median (interquartile

113

range). Categorical variables were presented in frequency and percentages. Normality test

114

adjustment was applied through the Shapiro-Wilk test. The groups were compared using

115

Student’s t-test (normal distribution) and the Mann-Whitney U test (non-normal distribution).

116

Chi-square was used to compare categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to

117

compare variables among multiple groups. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was

118

calculated for all laboratory parameters to demonstrate sensitivity and specificity in the COVID-

119

19 cohort. Odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) were presented for all tests performed.

120

Scatter plots were demonstrated using Pearson correlation analysis. A p-value of less than 0.05

121

was considered significant.

122

Results

123

A total of 1067 COVID-19 patients were included in this investigation: 319 were mild, 391

124

moderate, and 357 as critical cases. The ages for the COVID-19 cohort was approximately

125

similar: mild (47.83 ± 19.66 years), moderate (47.87 ± 19.21 years), and critical (47.29 ± 18.76

126

years) while the mean age for age- and gender-matched control subjects was 57.37 ± 4.62 years.

127

The patients in this group were significantly older than the COVID-19 cohort. Both COVID-19

128

and control groups had a majority of the male population (66.7% and 68.4%,

129

respectively). Table 1 demonstrates patient demographics and lab parameters in the control as

130

well as COVID-19 groups. Forty-seven patients did not survive with a mortality rate of 4.4%.

131

Biochemistry and hematology results showed that Hgb was significantly more in mild cases

132

while WBC was increased in moderate and critical cases. AST, ALT, creatinine, CRP, D-dimers

133

were all significantly increased in higher COVID-19 class while free T3, free T4, and TSH were

134

markedly reduced in critical cases (Table 1). LDL-C, HDL, TC, and TG levels were

135

significantly lower in COVID-19 patients as compared to control subjects. All lipid profiles

136

decreased gradually and significantly in critical cases as compared with mild and moderate

137

cases. Figure 1 and Table 2 demonstrate the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve

138

exhibiting the sensitivity and specificity of the lab parameters in predicting the progression of

139

COVID-19 disease. Correlation of LDL-C, HDL, TC, and TG with acute phase reactants is

140

shown in Figure 2.

141

Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictors of severe COVID-19 disease

142

among all subjects. The model suggested LDL-C, HDL, TC, TG, free T3, free T4, TSH, IL-6,

143

Procalcitonin, CRP, and D-dimers as independent risk factors for COVID-19 (Table 3).

144

Discussion

145

Key findings of this investigation were as follows: Levels of LDL-C, HDL, TC, and TG all

146

decreased significantly with increasing severity of COVID-19 while acute phase reactants like

147

IL-6, Procalcitonin, CRP, and D-dimers were increased in this cohort and thyroid function tests,

148

lipid profile parameters, and acute phase reactants were predictors of severe disease of COVID-

149

19. This is the first prospective report with lipid profile data of real-world patients suffering from

150

COVID-19 and this investigation points out that lipid levels start decreasing even in mild cases

151

while reduced lipid levels inversely correlate with acute phase reactants. Also, it provides

152

evidence of altered biochemistry and pathological evolution of lipidology in COVID-19.

153

Viral infections cause alterations of lipid biomarkers in their hosts, leading to disrupted

154

cholesterol rafts. This helps them in infiltrating the host defenses. In response to acute

155

inflammatory conditions in COVID-19, termed as cytokine storm, there is dysfunction of HDL

156

and LDL-C particles. In addition, a surge of pro-inflammatory cytokines can cause a

157

consumption of albumin, ApoA1, HDL, TC, TG, LDL-C, along with decreased lymphocytes

[14]. Therefore, according to our study, the depressed lipid parameters can be a predictor for the

159

severity of COVID-19 disease [11]. Similarly, a study in China described the lipid profile and

160

other clinical characteristics of COVID-19 [15]. The levels of LDL-C, HDL, and TC were

161

significantly decreased in their patients, and this alteration was gender-specific. In contrast to our

162

study, males more commonly presented with lowered lipid levels in their investigation. A

163

significant decrease in HDL was seen only in critical cases of COVID-19 while a significant

164

decrease of LDL-C, TC, and TG was observed in all COVID-19 groups (mild, severe, critical).

165

However, in our study HDL, LDL-C, TG, and TC were significantly depressed only in the

166

critical COVID-19 cohort. In contrast to these investigations, a preprint reports significantly

167

increased levels of LDL-C compared to control groups and a positive relationship of COVID-19

168

severity with elevated lipid profile alterations [16].

169

Similar findings have been demonstrated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), where

170

acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients exhibit an elevated level of plasma

171

triglycerides and decreased HDL and LDL-C [17]. Furthermore, HIV-infected individuals have

172

the propensity to develop various other lipid abnormalities like hypocholesterolemia and

173

decreased free fatty acids [18]. A study analyzed lipid metabolism in SARS-recovered patients at

174

12 years’ interval and demonstrated hypertriglyceridemia and an elevated very-low-density

175

lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol [19].

176

These findings can be explained by the composition of HDL, which contains esterified

177

cholesterol, Apo-lipoproteins, and triglycerides. These lipid fragments impart an important role

178

in small-vessel vasodilation, and in the reduction of oxidation and free radical formation,

179

apoptosis, thrombosis, infection, and inflammation [20]. In addition to its contribution as an anti-

180

inflammatory lipoprotein, HDL downregulates inflammatory mediators by inactivating T-cells

181

and macrophages [21]. In COVID-19, a surge in pro-inflammatory cytokines confer the presence

182

of systemic inflammation. HDL can deactivate this inflammatory cascade by inhibiting the

183

activation of monocytes and neutrophils while maintaining an antioxidant function, allowing for

184

the removal of oxidized lipids and neutralizing oxidative factors. This in turn mitigates

185

inflammatory response in the host cells [22]. During a cytokine storm in COVID-19, HDL and

186

LDL-C are oxidized, leading to an upregulation of immune activation [23,24]. Based on the

187

immunomodulatory mechanism of HDL, we can consider immune regulation in COVID-19 as

188

the primary cause for decreased lipid levels in this investigation.

189

There were several limitations of this investigation. First, the time of symptom onset to the time

190

of sample collection was variable in this cohort. Therefore, the analysis might represent

191

heterogeneous results of the COVID-19 disease course. Second, many patients were already on

192

statin treatment and the level of precise alteration in lipid profile during the disease course of the

193

COVID-19 cohort could be biased towards depressed lipid levels in these patients. Third, the

194

control group patients were healthy individuals with no severe or critical form of acute illness.

195

This could have produced a sample selection bias, producing abnormal results in this

196

investigation. Fourth, no follow-up data of the lipid profile and its alteration was collected for

197

monitoring the dynamics of COVID-19. This will be needed for better characterization of this

198

phenomenon in the COVID-19 cohort.

199

Conclusion

200

The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-COV-2 poses a great challenge to the human

201

population with a pressing need to understand viral mechanisms and develop effective antiviral

202

agents. As cholesterol is involved in many vital cellular processes in regulating the viral entry

203

into the host cell, the results of this investigation demonstrate a correlation of the severity of

COVID-19 disease with altered lipid profile parameters. Decreased levels of LDL-C, HDL, TC,

and TG validate the mechanism of immune upregulation by HDL and its byproducts, causing a

negative correlation between lipids and acute phase reactants released as pro-inflammatory

cytokines in COVID-19.
