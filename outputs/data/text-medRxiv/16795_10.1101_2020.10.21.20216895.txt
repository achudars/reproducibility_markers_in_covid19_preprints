Abstract
We study transmission of COVID-19 using five well-documented case studies – a Washington state
church choir, a Korean call center, a Korean exercise class, and two different Chinese bus trips. In all
cases the likely index patients were pre-symptomatic or mildly symptomatic, which is when infective
patients are most likely to interact with large groups of people. An estimate of ​N​0​, the characteristic
number of COVID-19 virions needed to induce infection in each case, is found using a simple physical
model of airborne transmission. We find that the ​N​0​ values are similar for five COVID-19 superspreading
cases (~300-2,000 viral copies) and of the same order as influenza A. Consistent with the recent results
of Goyal ​et al,​ these results suggest that viral loads relevant to infection from presymptomatic or mildly
symptomatic individuals may fall into a narrow range, and that exceptionally high viral loads are not
required to induce a superspreading event ​[1,2]​. Rather, t​he accumulation of infective aerosols exhaled
by a typical pre-symptomatic or mildly symptomatic patient in a confined, crowded space (amplified by
poor ventilation, particularly activity like exercise or singing, or lack of masks) for exposure times as
short as one hour are sufficient. We calculate that talking and breathing release ~460​N0​​ ​and ~10​N0​
(quanta)/hour, respectively, providing a basis to estimate the risks of everyday activities. Finally, we
provide a calculation which motivates the observation that fomites appear to account for a small
percentage of total COVID-19 infection events.

Background and Motivation
Growing evidence supports the idea that aerosols - particles of diameter less than 5-10 ​µ​m that can
remain suspended in air for many hours - are an important channel of spread of COVID-19 ​[3,4]​. The
SARS CoV-2 virus has a diameter of only 60-140 nm ​[5]​, so an aerosol of diameter 1 ​µ​m has the same
volume as of order 1,000 virions. Further, aerosols can stay suspended for long periods: in still air, it
takes a 1 ​µ​m diameter particle about 12 hours, and a 3 ​µ​m particle about 1.5 hours to vertically settle 5
feet ​[6]​. When considered by number (not by total volume), droplets emitted when coughing, breathing,
or speaking are nearly all of order 1 ​µ​m ​[7–10]​. An index patient who emits infective aerosols should
therefore leave particles with the capacity to fit hundreds or thousands of virions suspended in the air
for many hours. Recently, viable SARS-COV-2 virus was recovered from aerosols in the rooms of
COVID-19 patients, providing the first direct evidence of potential aerosol induced infection ​[11]​, and
the US CDC has also now officially recognized aerosols as a potential transmission mechanism ​[12]​.
Interestingly, most COVID patients do not infect anyone, whereas a small number of patients infect
multiple people ​[2,13,14]​. The observed distribution of attack rates for COVID-19 cannot be obtained if
all encounters are assumed to have the same virus transmission probability; however, if some
encounters have a higher virus transmission probability than others, then some index patients may pass
the virus to several people, even though most index patients do not pass the virus to anyone. We
consider two factors that might increase the transmission probability for some encounters: 1. an index
patient who emits unusually large quantities of live virus (superspreader) 2. a venue that accumulates
live airborne virus emitted by an average index patient (enhanced transmission ). If one person infects
many people during a single event, that interaction is often described as a superspreading event, which
could be explained either by the presence of a superspreader or by enhanced transmission.
Support for superspreaders has been provided by measurements of viral loads across all stages of
disease progression which indicate that viral loads span ~8-9 orders of magnitude centered on ~ 10​6​ -10​7
copies/mL ​[15–19]​. Support for the role of superspreaders was also offered by studies of the Skagit
choir that inferred an index patient viral load ranging from 10​9​ - 10​11​ copies/mL ​[20,21]​, which is at the
very high end of measured viral loads.
Support for “enhanced transmission” is provided by measurements and modeling from Goyal ​et al,
which indicate that the period of peak infectivity for COVID-19 is ~0.5-1.0 days, coinciding with a
relatively narrow range of peak viral loads (measured by nasopharyngeal swab) of order 10​7​ copies/mL
[1,2]​. Goyal ​et al​ considered the known distribution for the rate of secondary infections due to patients
with COVID-19. That distribution includes both patients who do not transmit the virus to anyone and
those who transmit it to many people. They then fit that distribution to a model of transmission to
obtain the parameters for the model that best characterize COVID-19 transmission. The results of the
fits indicate that superspreading events occur when an index patient has a large number of contacts
during the period of peak viral load. In addition, they find that, compared to influenza patients with an
equivalent physical contact network, patients with COVID-19 infect a greater number of contacts (which
they attribute to aerosolization.) Monte-Carlo modeling also suggests that superspreader events result
from “enhanced transmission” due to airborne transmission of virus emitted by presymptomatic
patients ​[22]​.

To address the question of whether superspreading events require superspreaders from a different
point of view, we consider the following well-documented events that have appeared to involve aerosol
transmission of SARS-CoV-2:
(1) In January 2020, an index patient who rode a 100-minute round trip bus ride to a Buddhist
worship event in China in January, infecting 23 out of 67 bus riders. Conveniently, there was a
second “control group” bus which went to the same event, in which 0 out of 60 riders were
infected ​[23]​.
(2) Also in January 2020, an index patient in Wuhan, China took two different buses on a single trip.
On the first 2.5 hour leg on a larger bus, 7 of 48 riders were infected, including riders ~4.5 m
away; on the second 1-hour leg on a smaller bus, 2 of 12 riders were infected ​[24]​.
(3) In February 2020, clusters of coronavirus transmission in aerobic dance exercise classes were
found, in Korea, this time due to sick instructors ​[25]​. These classes were very short – only about
50 minutes – and 5-22 students were in a ~60 m​2​ ~ 650 square foot room (so that many were
presumably separated from the instructor by more than 2 m.
(4) In March 2020, 94 out of 216 employees working on the same floor of a large (~1,000 m​2​ )
Korean call center tested positive. Of the positive results, 89 of them were one one side of the
floor measuring over 400 m​2​ [​ 26]​.
(5) Also in March 2020, 61 singers convened for 2.5 hours of choir practice in a ~200 m​2​ church in
Skagit County, Washington, in the U.S., after which 32 were confirmed positive and 20 were
suspected positive ​[20,27]​.
Past work has estimated the number of infective quanta emitted per unit time and their implications for
infection risk. For example, Miller ​et al​ and Buannono ​et al​ have analyzed the Skagit Choir case in detail,
[20,22]​ while Jimenez has published an online tool using the findings to evaluate aerosol infection
probabilities in different settings ​[28]​. More recently, Bazant has published estimates of source
strengths due to various activities and introduced a framework for interpreting and calculating the
subsequent risks ​[21]​.
Overview
In this paper, we use the above five case studies to directly estimate the characteristic number of virions
N​0​ needed to induce infection, assuming a probability of infection after inhalation of ​N​ virions which
varies as 1 – exp(-​N/N​0​). In each of these cases, there is no measurement of viral loads of the index
patients; however, if for each case we assume the viral density characteristic of peak infectivity (10​7
copies/mL, as measured by nasopharyngeal swab ​[1,2]​ ), we find a value of ​N​0​ ranging between
322-2,012 copies, which is similar to values assumed by other authors for COVID-191 and the ~300-9,000
copy infectious aerosol dose for Influenza A ​[32]​. Thus, our derived ​N​0​ values in combination with
previous experimental measurements ​[1,2]​ support the following: (1) none of these five so-called
“superspreading” events required super spreaders; (2) the distribution of viral loads in index patients at
the times most relevant for airborne transmission is narrow compared to the total distribution of viral
loads in the population; (3) if that narrow value is coincident with measured loads at the onset of
symptoms, then ​N​0​ values are of the order of levels found for influenza and (4) that airborne
For example, Buannano, Augenbraun, and Miller assume representative values of ​N​0​ = 50, 100, and 1,000
respectively ​[20,29,30]​, not dissimilar from the speculations of certain virologists who posit an infective dose of a
few hundred to a few thousand particles ​[31]​.

transmission can be enhanced by accumulation of viral particles in a confined space, which allows an
index patient with an average viral load to infect many other people.2
We review the existing literature to gather estimates of as many of the key parameters involved in
aerosol transmission of COVID-19 and use these estimates to infer the ​N0​​ for SARS-CoV2. Figure 1
summarizes the main components of this calculation, starting with the viral load in the index patient and
concluding with the estimated probability of infection. For each of the major variables, we show the
overall ranges in the literature, as well as highlighting (in red) the input values used for the point
estimate of ​N0​​ . We discuss all of the major parameters in the text below, but highlight two points here:
first, there is a ~3-4 order of magnitude difference in the literature between the volume of assumed
aerosol emission across difference measurements, which has a direct bearing on the question of
whether superspreading events require index patients with exceptional viral loads; second, that despite
the very wide range of viral loads (~9 orders of magnitude), the final values of ​N0​​ across the cases are
remarkably consistent and within ~1 order of magnitude. While the absolute values of ​N0​​ will change
depending on the aerosolized volume assumption, this consistency would hold for any single value of
the viral density chosen.

2

We note that our analysis of the Skagit choir event finds a similar quanta emission rate to previous work that
concluded the event involved a superspreading individual ​[20]​; however, we used a fluid emission rate for the
index patient that was much larger than the rate put forth in the previous Skagit choir study (1-10 nL/hour);
therefore, since the infectious particle emission rate is the product of the viral load and the fluid emission rate,
our much lower estimate of copies/mL was still consistent with the quanta emission rate used in both studies.

Independent of the estimate of ​N0​​ , and as Miller, Jimenez, Buannano, and Bazant have separately done,
the case studies can be used to compute the number of aerosolized units of ​N0​​ (quanta) released per
unit time, which can in turn be used to estimate the quanta released by talking or breathing ​[20–22,28]​.
This calculation finds that talking releases ~460 ​N​0​ per hour of aerosolized virus, whereas normal
breathing releases ~10​N​0​ per hour. We use these estimates to provide some order of magnitude risk
estimates for everyday activities. Because we associate these quanta emission rates with typical peak
viral loads, we find that these quanta are a reasonable representation of population-wide risk of
aerosols in various scenarios. It should be noted, however, that if, as has been suggested in other
analysis ​[20,21]​, the case studies such as the Skagit choir correspond to individuals with a viral load of
10​9​ - 10​11​ copies/mL (as opposed to the ~10​7​ copies/mL in this analysis), the population-wide risk will be
much lower than that implied by the quanta calculations (since such high viral loads are in the 95+
percentile of measured loads). Finally, we present a calculation indicating that typical fomite exposures
might be on the order 1-10 virions, which may motivate the observation that only a small percentage of
total transmission appears to be through fomites ​[37]​.
Exposure Model
A common dose response model (Wells-Riley model) assumes that it takes order ​N​0​ virions in to infect a
person ​[38]​. Specifically, each virion is assumed to be independent of the others and to have a
probability 1/​N0​​ of infecting an individual. If the individual is exposed to ​N​ particles, the expected
number of infective events is ​N​/​N​0​. Treating the infection as a Poisson process, the probability of zero
infective events (i.e. the probability of not being infected) is exp(-​N/​ ​N0​​ ) and the probability ​p​(​N)​ of being
− NN

infected is p (N ) = 1−e

0

.

In this section, we estimate both ​N​ and N
​ 0​ ​for the five cases mentioned above – the Skagit Choir in the
U.S., the Korean call center, the Korean aerobics class, and the two Chinese bus trips. In particular, we
quantify the key source (viral density and expelled aerosol volumes), removal (air exchange and
inactivation/settling), and exposure parameters (breathing rate, time, room volume) based on analysis
of the current literature.
If we know the concentration (virions/unit volume of air) of virions ​C​(​t)​ and that a person inhales the air
at a constant breathing rate ​B​ for a total time ​T​, the total number ​N​ of virions breathed in is
T

N = B ∫ dt C (t) .
0

The value of the breathing rate ​B​ has been well-characterized in a number of studies, and is typically
assumed to be in the range of 0.45 m​3​/hr - 0.60 m​3​/hr for sedentary activities ​[30,39]​. Relevant for this
analysis is the measurement of Binazzi ​et al​, which found that quiet breathing, reading with a normal
voice, and singing all had similar breathing rates (0.54 ± 0.21 m​3​/hr, 0.54 ± 0.21 m​3​/hr, and 0.61 ± 0.40
m​3​/hr, respectively) [​ 40]​. The breathing rate rises to ~1.3-1.5 m​3​/hr during “moderate” activities(easy
cycling, climbing stairs) and ~2.5-3.3 m​3​/hr during “heavy” activities (cross country skiing, climbing with
load)​[41]​. For purposes of this analysis, we use ​B​ = 0.5 m​3​/hr for the choir, call center, and bus cases,
and ​B​ = 2.0 m​3​/hr for the fitness center case.
The concentration ​C​ depends on both spatial coordinates and time. It is common in indoor air quality
calculations to make the simplifying assumption that the air is “well-mixed” – i.e. that the virions are
spread evenly across the volume in the room so that one can neglect the spatial dependence. This

assumption is justified if the time for virions to spread across the room is small compared to the
timescale of the decay processes above due to air exchange and other virion losses. The mixing time for
cough-generated aerosols has been characterized, where a coughing simulator was placed on one end
of a 2.7 m × 2.7 m × 2.4 m environmental chamber, and the concentration of small aerosols
(0.3-4.0 ​µ​m) was measured as a function of time at various locations ​[42]​. The measurement found that
after about 5 minutes, the concentration reached a steady state which was uniform across the room.
Note also that in the experiment, the chamber was sealed during the coughing simulation (zero air
exchanges per hour) so that there was no airflow that would cause additional mixing. These results
support the reasonableness of making the well-mixed approximation.
With the well-mixed approximation, we can calculate the number of virions ​n(​ ​t)​ over time. We assume
that the person emits a constant flow ​S​ of new virions per unit time, and that since the air is well-mixed,
the number of virions lost to decay per unit time is ​λ∙​n(​ ​t​). There are multiple possible sources of decay
so ​λ​ is the sum of multiple contributions ​λ1​​ = ​λ1​​ + ​λ2​ ​ + ​λ3​​ …​ which
will be specified below, so ​n(​ ​t​)
​
obeys

= S − λ n(t)

which has the usual solution of a transient term decaying at a rate ​λ​ toward a steady state ​n​eq​:
n (t) = neq + (n (0) −neq ) e−λt

neq = S/λ .
In the cases we consider, we assume that the environment starts off “clean” – i.e. that n(0) = 0. That is,
we assume there are no viral particles in the air before the choir assembles, or before the riders enter
the bus, etc. In this case, we have
n (t) = neq (1−e−λt ) .
Since the concentration ​C​ = ​n​ / ​V​ where ​V​ is the volume of the room, we can solve for the total inhaled
particles ​N​ over a time ​T​ (where B is the breathing rate i.e. the volume inhaled per unit time).

To perform the calculations for the five case studies, we need to know ​B​, the breathing rate; the room
volume ​V​ (either reported or estimable); the exposure time ​T​ (generally reported); the decay rate ​λ​;
and the source term ​S​. We now turn to the last two terms.
Decay rate ​λ​: As noted above, ​λ ​is the sum of several contributions, namely:
λ​1​= air exchange rate = rate at which fresh air replaces stale air in the room. For example, if ​λ1​
= 2.0 h​-1​, the air turns over twice an hour in the room. See the Supplementary Materials for
representative values of ​λ​1​.
λ​2​ = decay rate of SARS-CoV-2 in air, due to both settling and inactivation in air. For settling,
Diapouli ​et al​. report aerosol settling rates in indoor settings which average approximately 0.3

h​-1​: PM 2.5 decay rates ranged from ~0.1-0.4 h​-1​, while measured PM 10 decay rates range from
~0.05-0.65 h​-1​ ​[43]​. For SARS-CoV-2 viral deactivation, both van Doremalen ​et al​ and Fears ​et al
measured the decay in infective virus in a Goldberg drum, which in principle eliminates the
effects of settling. However, van Doremalen measured a half-life of SARS-Cov-2 1.09 hours in air
(​λ2​ =​ 0.64 h​-1​) ​[44]​, ​while Fears ​et al​ were not able to detect meaningful viral inactivation of 2-3
μm SARS-CoV-2 aerosols over a 16 hour period (i.e. measured ​λ2​ ​= 0) ​[45]​.3 For purposes of this
calculation, we include a contribution of 0.3 h​-1​ due to settling, and a contribution of 0.32 h​-1​ due
to inactivation (averaging the van Doremalen and Fears measurements), for a total value of ​λ2​
= 0.62 h​-1​.
λ​3​ = effect of filtration. In the case studies considered, there is no filtration, so we will return to
this in the scenario analysis.
Source term ​S:​ We estimate the source term as the product of a viral density ​ρ​ (virions / unit volume)
and a volume per unit time of aerosol expelled ​φ​.
Viral density ​ρ​: This quantity has been directly measured, but it ranges over many orders of magnitude
across patients. Across a sample of 3,303 patients testing positive in Germany, Jones ​et al​ measured a
mean viral load of 5.72 Log​10​ copies/mL with an estimated standard deviation of ~1.9 Log​10​ copies/mL
[18]​. Similarly, in a sample of all 4,428 positive RT-PCR from a single US laboratory tests (defined as a
cycle threshold value for RT-PCR ≤ 38.0), Kleiboeker ​et al​ measured a mean and median, respectively, of
5.85 and 6.05 log​10​ copies/mL, with a range of 0.91-10.42 Log​10​ copies/mL, 15.3% results greater than 8
log​10​ copies/mL, and an estimated standard deviation of ~2.0 log​10​ copies/mL (Figure 1) ​[15]​. 4 Other
measurements include Arnaout ​et al​ (initial positive results from 4,774 patients, mean of ~5.2 log​10
copies/mL) and Jacot ​et al​ (initial positive results from 4,172 patients, mean of ~6.5 log​10​ copies/mL, and
median of 6.77 log​10​ copies/mL) ​[16,17]​. Arnaout finds a maximum viral load of 2.5 × 10​9​ copies/mL (9.4
log​10​ copies/mL) while Jacot finds a maximum viral load of ~2 × 10​10​ copies/mL (10.3 log​10​ copies/mL),
broadly consistent with Kleibocker and Jones. In all of these measurements, the probability of a given
viral density drops sharply beginning at ~10​8​ copies/mL.
We note two additional points about these distributions. First, the measurements show only total viral
copies derived from cycle threshold (Ct) values, without making any statement about whether these
copies were infectious. Second, the remarkable breadth of the distribution -- spanning 8-9 orders of
magnitude in viral titre -- needs to be interpreted carefully. The PCR tests underlying the distribution
were taken at different points after infection, so the wide range of viral loads arises from not only
inhomogeneity across patients, but also, changes during disease progression.5 Said differently, a single

​The source of this discrepancy is unclear, though it is possible that the measurement of van Doremalen includes
some effect of settling. Fears ​et al​ explicitly note that the rotation rate of the Goldberg drum used was sufficiently
high to create a suspended aerosol​[45]​. Unrelated measurements by Huang ​et al​ found a half life of 1.38 ± 0.05
hours for 3 μm particles rotating at 5 rpm in a Goldberg drum, not dissimilar from the 1.09 hour half life found by
van Doremalen​[46]​.
4
The standard deviation for Jones et al is estimated from Table 2 ​[18]​. Kleiboeker ​et al​ do not report a standard
deviation, so the figure of ~2.0 log​10​ copies/mL was calculated based on the underlying data provided to us by
Kleiboeker (private communication). The mean log​10​ copies/mL for Arnaout and Jacot were calculated based on
digitizing the data in their figures 2(a) and 1(a), respectively ​[16,17]​.

Jacot ​et al​ only measure the initial sample of a given patient, but these patients were tested at different points
during disease progression​[16]​.

patient tested continuously from exposure to recovery would show a range of viral loads from the limit
of detection (~100 copies/mL) to the peak viral load (conceivably 10​7​-10​9​ copies/mL).
As we discuss in detail later, there is generally a narrow time period of maximum infectiousness,
estimated by Goyal et al to be approximately 0.5-1.0 day around the time of peak viral load ​[2]​. Based on
the viral trajectory of 16 hospitalized patients, Goyal et al estimated a peak viral load, as measured by
nasopharyngeal (NP) swab, of ~7.2-7.3 Log​10​ copies/mL. For purposes of this analysis, we therefore use a
value of ​ρ =​10​7​ copies/mL, which approximates the average viral density in the window of ~1 day
around the peak. This is also the value that was used in Monte Carlo modeling of the individual infection
risk for susceptible subjects confined in a room with an asymptomatic index patient ​[22]​. As a side note,
this value is also not far from the mean density measured by Wölfel ​et al,​ who found a mean viral
density in sputum of 7.00 × 10​6 ​viral copies per mL (6.85 Log​10​ copies/mL) ​[19]​. The assumed value of ​ρ
is the ~66th percentile of values measured by Kleiboeker ​et al​, as shown in Figure 2.

Volume expelled per unit time ​φ​: The value of ​φ​ (volume of aerosols expelled per unit time) depends
on what the person is doing. We use measured values for speaking and then infer the results for other
activities such as talking, breathing, and singing.
Talking:​ Stadnytskyi ​et al​ recently measured aerosol volumes by scattering of laser light off droplets
generated during repetition of the phrase “stay healthy” for 25 seconds ​[33]​. The study infers a

dehydrated droplet diameter of ~4 μm and a hydrated droplet diameter ~12-21 μm, corresponding to
hydrated volumes of 60 to 320 nL. We use the average of these two values – i.e. when talking, ​φ​ = 190
nL/25s = 7.6 nL/s.
Breathing:​ Morawska ​et al​ measured differences in expelled particle density when breathing and talking
(e.g. saying “aah” and counting) ​[10]​. Averaging across the talking and breathing scenarios, these
measurements show that that talking releases about an order of magnitude more particles by number
than does breathing (ratio of ~18.1×), but also, that because vocalization releases larger particles, the
6
volume ratio of talking to breathing is higher, at ~45.7×.​ Thus, for breathing we use ​φ​ = 1/45.7x 7.6
nL/s ~ 0.2 nL/s.
Singing​: Singing expels about 6 times as many particles as talking ​[9,47]​, so for this case we use ​φ​ = 6 x
7.6 nL/s = 45.6 nL/s.
The order of magnitude of the volume of aerosols emitted during speaking varies significantly in the
literature depending on the measurement method used. Specifically, Miller ​et al​ estimate, based on the
work of Morawska, that speaking results in emission of ~1-10 nL of aerosols per hour ​[10,20]​. In
contrast, Stadnytskyi ​et al​ find volumes of 60-320 nL over just 25 seconds of speaking -- some 3-4 orders
of magnitude higher. This large difference may be due partially to the differences in particle sizes
measured. Stadnytskyi ​et al​ estimate that the aerodynamic particle sizer (APS) method used by
Morawska ​et al.​ may measure particles of hydrated diameter ~8.7 μm and less, which are outside of the
12-21 μm range in the scattering experiment ​[33]​. Nonetheless, a sharp drop of 3-4 orders of magnitude
for a halving of the particle diameter would not be expected. A second factor that may account for the
difference is that the measurement of Morawska ​et al​ uses an APS, which may not count all particles
emitted. Asadi ​et al.​, who perform similar measurements to Morawska using an APS, note that their
reported particle emission rates are to be viewed in relative, not absolute, terms ​[9]​.
We believe that Stadnytskyi’s estimate is the more appropriate one to use here. As a cross-check to this
estimate, we can compare our computed value of ​φ ​when breathing to experiments that measured
respiratory fluids using exhaled breath condensates (EBCs). In an EBC measurement, a patient breathes
into a chilled tube which collects the condensed breath. That condensed breath can then be tested for
volatile and non-volatile solutes, including pathogens ​[35,36,48]​.7 Breath samples consist almost
6

The factor of 17.7 is obtained by comparing the average of the “aah-v-p” and “c-v-p” number concentrations with
the average of the “b-n-m” and “b-n-n” concentrations. Note that in the vocalization experiments, equal time is
spent speaking and breathing, so we remove the “background” concentration due to the time spent only
breathing. The factor of 45.2 is obtained the same way, summing the volume contributions of each measured
diameter bucket from 0.8 μm to 5.5 μm.
7
Ma ​et al​ used EBC to measure SARS-Cov-2 emissions in breath and found positive readings in 14 out of 52 (26%)
of the EBC samples. They infer an emission rate of 1.03x 10​5​ - 2.25 x 10​7​ virus copies/hour ​[48]​, which is
substantially higher than the ~6,000 copies/hour implied by our breathing calculation. The size of the EBC samples
ranges from 300-500 μL for 5 minutes of collection. At a dilution factor of 20,000, the aerosol emission rate would
be ~0.4 mL/5 minutes/20000 ~ 2.4 x 10​-4​ mL/hour (similar to our value of ​φbreathing​
​
of 6.0 x 10​-4​ mL/hour), which in
8​
10​
turn would imply a viral load of ~4 x 10​ - 9 x 10​ copies/mL in the exhaled aerosols. These viral loads are very high
(~95-100% percentile of the viral load ranges measured by Kleiboeker ​[15]​. It is possible that the discrepancy
between the values is due to the conversion of cycle threshold (Ct) values to copies/mL; the conversion reported
by Ma is 2-4 orders of magnitude higher than that reported by other authors. Ma ​et al​ convert Ct values to
copies/mL according to the formula copies/mL = 10​5​ x 1.75​(39.5-Ct) ​[48]​ , or equivalently, Log​10​ (copies/mL) = 14.60 0.24 Ct . For the average Ct value of 35.54 reported by Ma, this conversion implies a viral load in the EBC of ~6.0
Log​10​ copies/mL. If the respiratory fluids in EBC are diluted by a factor of ~20,000 by water vapor, the viral load in

exclusively of water vapor from the lungs. The water vapor cannot carry the virus, but the breath
samples also contain a small contribution of aerosols from respiratory fluids. Those aerosolized fluids
can carry viruses, as well as other non-volatile condensates that are present in the respiratory system.
Thus, EBC’s include both condensed water vapor and condensed aerosols. Effros ​et al.​ compared the
concentration of non-volatile solutes in condensed respiratory fluids to the concentration of the same
solutes in airways. They found that the concentration of the non-volatile solute in EBC’s was reduced by
an average factor of ~20,000:1 (± ~2,500:1) over the concentrations in lungs, with the reduction factor
varying between ~1000:1 to ~50,000:1 ​[34]​.8 If the non-volatile solute concentration in exhaled
droplets is similar to concentrations in lungs, then respiratory aerosols account for ~1/20,000 of the
total water loss through breathing. Water loss through breathing is well-characterized, at ~350-400
mL/day (~16 mL/hour) ​[36,50]​. The dilution factor of 20,000 from EBC measurements would therefore
imply aerosolized breath volumes of 16/20,000 = 8 x 10​-4​ mL/hour, consistent with our value of ​φbreathing
​
-4​
9
(~6 x 10​ mL/hour.) In a separate publication, Effros ​et al​ estimate that ~4.5 nL of airway lining fluid is
exhaled per liter of breath ​[35]​, which, assuming a breathing rate of 500 L/hour (0.5 m​3​/hour), translates
into ~2.3 x 10​-3​ mL/hr of emitted volume, within a factor of ~4 of our figure for ​φbreathing​
​
of ~6.0 x 10​-4
mL/h. That is, the volume of breathing aerosols implied by Stadnytskyi’s speaking measurements and
our assumed ratio of breathing/speaking volumes are consistent with the volume of breathing aerosols
from EBC measurements.
To further motivate why particles of a few μm diameter, may constitute the main contribution to
aerosol spread of infection, we consider the measurements of Asadi ​et al,​ who showed that speech
droplets follow an approximately lognormal distribution peaking at diameter ~1 μm , the fit of which is
shown as the dashed line in Figure 3 below. In general, the infectivity of airborne pathogens will depend
on their deposition locations in the body, which in turn depends on particle size: for instance, particles
of ≲ 3 μm can reach lung tissue, whereas larger (≳ 8 μm) particles may lodge in the upper airways ​[51]​.
Furthermore, viral densities (or the density of viable virions) may depend on particle size. (It should be
noted that Santarpia ​et al.​ successfully recovered infectious SARS-Cov-2 from particles of less than 4.1
μm, including particles with diameters < 1μm ​[52]​. They note, however, that failure to recover infectious
SARS-Cov-2 from particles larger than 4.1 μm may have been an artifact of the effect of the collection
mechanism on viral viability.) We assume for simplicity that over the relevant size range, both the viral
density and the aerosol infectivity are independent of the aerosol volume, in which case what matters
for infectivity is not the number of particles of each size but rather their volume contribution. For
purposes of estimating the relative volume contributions of particles of different sizes to transmission,
we multiply the particle number distribution by two factors: (i) the volume contribution of each
diameter ​d​ (proportional to ​d​3​) and (ii) a factor accounting for the longer lifetimes of smaller particles in
air. For simplicity, we assume that each particle size has a characteristic survival time τ given by the
respiratory fluid would be ~2 x 10​10​ copies/mL (~10.3 Log​10​ (copies/mL), at the extreme high of measured values.
In contrast, Zou (Log​10​ (copies/mL = 14.11 - 0.32 Ct), Jones (Log​10​ (copies/mL) = 14.16 - 0.30 Ct), Kleiboeker (Log​10
(copies/mL) = 12.27 - 0.30 Ct, and Jacot (Log​10​ (copies/mL) = 13.14 - 0.27Ct) all would find a much lower viral load
in EBC for a Ct value of 35.54 -- 2.6, 3.6, 1.6, and 3.5 Log​10​ (copies/mL), respectively. Increasing these by a factor of
20,000 for EBC dilution would produce a viral load in respiratory fluid of ~5.9-7.9 Log​10​ copies/mL, which is more in
line with measured distributions ​[15,16,18,49]​.
8
Although the individual reduction factor measurements vary widely, the dilution estimates are much tighter, at
20,472 ± 2,516 for cation measurements, 21,019 ± 2,427 for conductivity measurements, and 18,818 ± 2,402 for
urea measurements.

In a later paper, Effros et al cite a dilution factor of approximately 10,000 ​[35]​.

Newton-Stokes law ( τ = 4.5 η ​h​ / ​g​ ρ ​r​2​ where η is the viscosity of air, ​h​ is the height, and ​r​ = ​d/​ 2 is
the radius, ρ = density of water), and that the number of particles after a time ​t​ is proportional to
exp(-​t​/τ).​[30,53]​ The solid line in Figure 2 shows that the relative volume contribution for ​h​ = 2m and ​t
= 1 hour (the timescale of removal of particles at typical air exchange rates) peaks around 3 μm.

Figure 3: Number of Aerosol Particles and Relative Volume Contribution by Diameter. Number of
aerosol particles (dashed line) and relative contribution adjusting for particle volume and airborne
lifetime. The number of aerosol particles at each diameter is reproduced from Asadi ​et al.​ (Figure S3),
which uses an aerodynamic particle sizer to measure the fully dehydrated particle size distribution
after a 5 second vocalization ​[9]​. The relative contribution adjusting for particle size multiplies the
particle number distribution by a factor proportional to the volume of each particle (~diameter3​ ​) and a
factor proportional to particle airborne lifetime (~exp(-const·diameter2​ ​)). These observations suggest
that particles in the range of 4 μm diameter may be the primary contributors to infectivity.
Typical Value of ​ρ​: Putting these together, we get ​S​ = ​ρ​ ​φ​ for various activities: Talking: ​S​ ~ 4,600
virions/minute; breathing: ​S​ ~ 100 virions/minute; singing: ​S​ ~ 27,000 virions/minute.
Estimating Characteristic Dose (​N0​ ​) Using Case Studies
In each of the five case studies, an attack rate or range of attack rates (number of infected/ number of
exposed) ​r​ is reported along with a description of the environment. From this information, along with
the source and decay parameters discussed in the previous section, ​N​ and therefore ​N0​ ​, can be
estimated from ​r =​ 1 - exp (​-N/N​0).

In estimating ​N​, the physical parameters of the case studies are not all known with precision and it is
necessary to make assumptions about many of them, particularly the air exchange rate. Here, we use
the EPA office building assumption of 1.5 h​-1​ for the choir, office, and fitness center cases, and 3.0 h​-1​ in
the bus case.10 11 In addition, given the large difference in virion expulsion for different activities, we
must make an assumption about the percentage of time spent talking/singing versus breathing. For
choir singing, based on published observations, we assume that ⅔ of the time is spent singing ​[54]​; in the
cases of the call center, fitness class, and buses, respectively, we assume that 90%, 50%, and 25% of the
time are spent talking.12 Finally, there can be ambiguity in the attack rate: in the case of the Skagit Choir,
there were 32 confirmed infected and 20 probable infected, so the attack rate ranges from 53-87%; we
calculate ​N​0​ in both cases [​ 27]​. In the case of the Korean Fitness center, the reported attack rate across
all events is 26% (57 confirmed/217 exposed); however, this includes an instructor teaching yoga and
pilates (0 confirmed/25 exposed), which we exclude from the analysis ​[25]​. Finally, in the case of the
Korean call center, out of 94 total cases on the 11th floor, 89 of them were in an area separated from
the rest of the floor by elevator banks and other rooms ​[26]​; we calculate the attack rate for this area,
but show that the value of ​N0​​ is similar if one instead uses the entire area.
Table 1 shows the key inputs and outputs for the calculations. For the interested reader, we include in
the Supplementary Materials a spreadsheet where these inputs can be customized. For the base inputs,
the range of ​N​0​ (322-2,012) that results from the five scenarios is reasonably narrow. The order of
magnitude of ​N​0​ calculated here is not unreasonable. It has been speculated that ​N0​​ is of order a few
hundred to a few thousand particles for SARS-CoV-2 ​[31]​ .
As a further reasonableness check, we calculate airborne viral copy concentrations in a range of 96-519
copies/m​3 ​across the scenarios. These can be compared with measurements of Liu ​et al.,​ who measured
viral densities at various locations in a Wuhan hospital (a location with filtration and higher air
exchange) and found densities of ~10-40 copies/m​3​ in some staff areas (range 0-42), and up to 113
copies/m​3​ intensive care units (range 0-113) ​[55]​. Hallway air samples in the University of Nebraska
National Quarantine Unit (NQU, where mildly ill patients are isolated), found detectable virus in 58.3%
of cases, ranging from ~2,000-9,000 copies/m​3​ ​[56]​.
We also show the quanta/hour emitted in each scenario (the number of ​N0​​ emitted by the index patient
in each of the case studies), and the implied quanta/hour emitted by speaking (range 136-757, average
of 461) and breathing (range 3-17, average of 10). These quanta are broadly consistent with those found
by other authors: Miller ​et al​ find an emission rate of 970 quanta/h for the Skagit choir case ​[20]​;13
Bazant finds ~4-16 quanta/h for breathing and 54-970 quanta/h for speaking and singing ​[21]​. Jimenez,

In the case of the Skagit choir, based on a more detailed calculation, Miller ​et al​ use a smaller air exchange of
0.3-1.0 h​-1​. However, adding the contribution of ventilation loss rates deposition, and virus inactivation, the
average total decay rate in their calculation is 1.9 h​-1 ,​ which is similar to the 2.1 h​-1​ used
here ​[20]​.
​
11
The event in the bus occurred during winter, so the bus windows were believed to be closed (Y. Shen, personal
communication).
12
In the case of the Wuhan buses, the index patient is thought to have had a mild cough (Y. Yang, personal
communication).
13
Note that in the Skagit choir case, the calculated quanta emission is of 2,347/h is roughly double the mean
emission rate of 970 quanta/h reported by Miller​ et al​ ​[20]​; this difference is largely due to a mean assumed
breathing rate in the Miller calculation of ~1.0 m​3​/h (range 0.65-1.38), compared to 0.5 m​3​/h here.

based on the work of Buonnano ​et al​, recommends a range of ~2-14 quanta/hour for oral breathing
(depending on the activity) and 61-408 quanta/h for loud speaking ​[22,28]​.
In the attached spreadsheet, we also show the case in which the entire Korean call center is considered
(greater area and lower attack rate), which results in a similar ​N0​​ = 240.14 In the Supplementary
Materials, we also discuss the case of a restaurant in Guangzhou, which is included in the spreadsheet
but not in the case studies due to measurement ambiguities in both the attack rate and the relevant
room volume. The values of ​N​0​ for the restaurant case are broadly consistent, however, with the five
cases here, with a range of ​N0​​ of 499 to 2,415.

​For the Korean call center case, there is uncertainty about the time that the index patient spent in the call
center. We have assumed 8 hours (1 full day), but it is possible that the index patient was present for more than 1

averaging the high and low attack rate cases, for the particular parameters of that scenario. The
quanta/hour (talking, breathing) are the implied quanta/hour for talking and breathing.
Though SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A infections have many dissimilar features, it is interesting to note
that the values of ​N​0​ (~300-2,000 copies) here are similar to that of influenza. Our search of the
literature finds that most measurements would indicate an ​N0​ range
of ~300-9,000 viral copies for
​
influenza (by way of comparison, Killingley and Bischoff quote a range influenza ​N0​ ​ of ~350-1,700 and
~130-2,800, respectively ​[57,58]​.) In the case of influenza A aerosol infection, the human ID​50​ (dose at
which 50% of subjects become infected) is widely cited as 0.6-3.0 TCID​50​ (the viral load at which 50% of
cells in culture are infected) ​[59]​. However, the range of viral copies per TCID​50​ varies significantly and
has been measured by Fabian ​et al​ [​ 60]​, Ward ​et al​ ​[61]​, and Yang ​et al ​[32]​ t​ o be 300, 1000, and
452-2,100 viral copies, respectively. That is, in the case of influenza A, the human ID50 is in the range of
~200-6,000 copies, which would imply a ​N0​​ (=ID50/​ln​(2)) for influenza of ~300-9,000 copies ​[62]​.
As a further comparison, Fears ​et al.​, measured the change in infectivity of aerosolized SARS-Cov-2 with
time. That work reports both genome copies per unit volume and PFU per unit volume ​[45]​. Over 5
measurements spanning ~ 8 hours, the ratio of PFU to genome copies ranges from ~20 to ~1,100, with
an average of ~500 copies/PFU.15 If, as in the case of influenza, the ID50 for inhalation of SARS-CoV-2 is
on the order of 1 PFU, this measurement would imply an ID50 of ~500 copies, so that ​N​0​ = 500/​ln​(2) ~
700, in accord with our range of ​N​0​ of 300-2,000.16
The consistency of the ​N0​ ​ estimates from the 5 cases -- each of which was derived assuming the same
viral density -- is surprising in light of the extremely broad range of viral loads discussed previously
(spanning ~8-9 orders of magnitude). If, in the alternative, we assume that ​N​0​ is in the range of
100-1,000 and calculate ​N,​ and thus the viral load, for each scenario, the range of viral loads​ t​ hat result
is 5.7-7.5 Log​10​ copies/mL, again much narrower than the total range of viral loads seen in the
population (~2-10 Log​10​ copies/mL). This suggests that the index patients in the five case studies carried
viral loads in the ~ 50-80% percentiles -- above average, but not exceptionally so. More importantly, this
consistency suggests that for the types of cases studied here -- where an asymptomatic or mildly
symptomatic person infects numerous others through airborne transmission -- the range of viral loads
may be much narrower than the range implied by population-wide measurements.
The relatively narrow range of relevant viral loads for “superspreading” events (whether through
aerosols or other forms) is consistent with previous epidemiological analyses. Specifically, it is
well-established that patients with COVID-19 are most infectious within a window (<~ 1 day) of the
onset of symptoms ​[37,64]​. Goyal ​et al​ explored this phenomenon quantitatively in a set of two recent
papers. ​[1,2]​. In the first, the authors use longitudinal viral load data from 25 patients (i.e. repeated
measurements on the same patient) to fit a compartmentalized viral load model. An example set of data
and model fit (patient S14) from their work are shown in Figure 3(a) below: the model shows a very
rapid increase of ~5 orders of magnitude over a few days to a peak viral load of order 10​7​ copies/sample,
a sharp drop of ~2 orders of magnitude over the next two days, and a somewhat slower decline
Using Figure 2 of Fears ​et al​, the genome/PFU ratio is estimated to be ~20, ~1040, ~1140, ~189, and ~132 after
10, 30, 120, 240, and 960 minutes, respectively.​[45]​ Buonanno ​et al​ appear use the “steady state” figure of 1.3 x
10​2​ for c​PFU​ (copies per PFU) in their analysis ​[22]​.
16
The value of ~500 genome copies/PFU is in the range of that measured for SARS-CoV-1, where Vicenzi ​et al
measured 360 genome copies/PFU ​[63]​. However, Watanabe ​et al​ estimated that the ID50 for SARS-CoV-1 is
estimated to be 280 PFU (​N​0​ = 410 PFU), implying that SARS-CoV-1 would have ​N​0​ of order 150,000 genome copies.

thereafter. However, in the window of ± 1 day around the peak viral load, the modeled load varies by
only a factor of 10 (~6.3-7.3 Log​10​ copies/sample) ​[1]​.
In the second analysis, Goyal ​et al​ carry over the viral load model to analyze transmission dynamics in
the population. This model finds that the time period in which infected patients are most likely to infect
others (more precisely, to have a greater than 50% chance of infecting others), lies within a narrow
0.5-1.0 day period centered around the time of peak viral load ​[2]​.
Thus, there should be a significant difference between the viral loads that matter for transmission,
which sample only a short time period around the peak viral load, and the viral loads measured by
Kleiboeker and others, which sample all potential times after exposure. While the measured viral loads
in the 25 longitudinal patient studies varies from ~100 viral copies/sample (the approximate limit of
detection ​[15,17]​) to ~10​9​ copies/sample, the 25 models find only a very narrow range of fitted peak
viral loads of ~7.2-8.3 Log10 copies/sample.17 Goyal ​et al​ note, however, that, because there is more
data during period of viral decline, their fits are generally more reliable in this period ​[1,2]​. Alternatively,
Figure 4(b) shows the distribution of the 29 instances of measured (not modeled) viral loads which fall
within ± 1 day of Goyal ​et al’s​ modeled peak viral load (black bars), superimposed on the
population-wide viral load measurement of Kleiboeker ​et al​ (grey bars) ​[2,15]​. While this distribution of
actual data is not as narrow as the range of modeled peak distributions, it is clearly far narrower than
the population-wide distribution; ~70% of the data lies in the range of 6.0-7.5 Log​10​ copies/sample.18
Interestingly, median viral loads for COVID 19 are consistent with those of a number of other respiratory
viruses. Jacot ​et al,​ for example, reports a median value of 6.77 Log​10​ copies/mL for SARS-CoV2 across
4,326 samples and compares them to 6,050 RT-PCR tests taken over 2015-2020 for 14 other respiratory
viruses. All but two viruses show median viral loads between 5.76 and 6.83 Log​10​ copies/mL; for
instance, influenza A and B have respective median loads of 6.01 and 6.83 Log​10​ copies/mL [​ 16]​.19
In sum, the period most relevant for infectivity samples only a narrow slice of the total range of viral
loads observed across disease progression, helping to explain why selecting a single viral load value for
the five cases results in a modest range for ​N​0​ values (~300-2,000).

17

It should be noted that this range is broadened by measurement differences: the data contains 9 patients from
Germany which were analyzed using sputum samples. These samples are systematically higher than those from
other 16 patients, which were analyzed using nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. The modeled peak values for the
sputum samples were in the range of ~8.2-8.3 log​10​ copies/sample, while the modeled peak values for the NP
samples were in the range of ~7.2-7.3 log​10​ copies/sample.
18
As in the case of the modeled distributions, the sputum samples generally show higher viral loads than the NP
samples. The data at 8.5 and 9.0 log​10​ copies are from sputum samples.
19
Jacot notes that the distributions for these other viruses are statistically significantly different in 9 of the 14 cases
(Jacot Figure 2); we are simply noting that the medians across viruses, even if different statistically, are of similar
magnitudes.

load. The distribution of peak values, which may be more representative of viral load in index patients
of our case studies, is significantly narrower than the Kleiboeker distribution.
Risks of Everyday Activities
In a narrow sense, the value of ​N​0​ is not necessary for calculation of the risks of a given situation: one
needs only the quanta emitted per unit time. However, in calculating the aggregate risk across the
population, it is important to consider whether the calibration quanta emission rates calculated here
originated from index individuals with an exceptionally low viral load, or a more typical viral load or an
exceptionally high viral load. (By “calibration quanta emission rates”, we mean the quanta per hour
emitted by the index patients in the case studies.) Miller ​et al​ calculate that, assuming that 1 quanta (1
N​0​) is equal to 1000 viral RNA copies, the ~1000 quanta/hour estimated in the Skagit choir case would
correspond to a viral load of ~10​11​ copies/mL ​[20]​. Buonanno similarly calculates that a quanta emission
rate of 142 quanta/h, assuming ​N0​​ = 50, corresponds to a viral load of 10​9​ copies/mL (so that if ​N0​​ =
1000, the viral load would be on the order of 10​10​-10​11​ copies/mL ​[29]​.) However, in this work we
associate similar quanta emission rates based on a viral load on the order of only 10​7​ copies/mL, which
implies higher population-wide risks of aerosol transmission.
For example, consider a stylized case of a high-risk activity, where, based on the calibration quanta rates
calculated from the case studies (e.g. 460 quanta/hour for speaking, 10 quanta/hour for breathing), the
risk of infection given the environmental conditions is 1/3 (i.e. exposure of ​N​=0.41 ​N​0).
​ The details of the
environment are not important for this purpose; rather, the environment and the quanta together are
assumed to give rise to an infection probability of 1/3. Suppose that these calibration quanta emission
rates correspond, as found here, to an index patient with a viral density of 10​7​ copies/mL. Across the
population, the entire range of viral densities of ~10​1​ - 10​10​ copies/mL will be represented, each with a
different probability of causing infection. An individual with a viral density of 10​6​ copies/mL would,
under the same environmental conditions, produce an exposure of 0.041 N​0​ and a risk of infection of
1-exp(-0.041) ~ 4%; similarly, an index patient with a viral density of 10​8​ copies/mL would produce an
exposure of 4.1 N​0​ and a risk of infection of ~98%.
The population-wide risk of this particular activity assuming a random index patient can be estimated by
weighting these differing infection probabilities by the distribution of viral loads present in infected
individuals. If the calibration quanta rate corresponds to a viral density 10​7​ copies/mL, and the risk of
infection for a person with this viral density is 33%, then the population-wide risk (averaging across the
distribution of Kleiboeker ​et al)​ is calculated to be 30.8%. That is, if the viral density for the calibration
quanta is ~10​7​ copies/mL, the quanta based calculation would be a good representation of the
population-wide risk of this activity. On the other hand, if the calibration quanta rates were derived
from an index patient with a viral density of 10​9​ copies/mL, the population wide risks (again averaging
across the distribution of Kleiboeker ​et al)​ would be only 2.9% -- an order of magnitude lower -- because
relatively few individuals have viral densities as high as 10​9​ copies/mL.
To underscore this point, Table 2 shows the population-wide risks for the activity for different values of
the viral density corresponding to the calibration quanta rate, assuming an infection risk of 1/3 for the
calibration quanta rate. The table shows the percentile of the viral density distribution for each value of
the viral density using the distribution of Kleiboeker ​et al ​(e.g. 7.0 Log​10​ copies/mL = 71st percentile), the
population-wide risk of infection (e.g. 30.8%), and the ratio of this population-based risk of infection to

the risk calculated based on the quanta (e.g. 30.8%/33% ~ 0.92). Previously, we showed that a range of
N​0​ of 100-1,000 would, in the five case studies, imply a viral load of 5.7-7.5 Log​10​ copies/mL. Across this
range, the order of magnitude of population wide risks (21.9%- ~50%) is similar to the quanta based risk
of 33%. However, if the calibration quanta rates arise from high viral load individuals (10​9​-10​10​ copies/
mL), as has been suggested in earlier works, the population-wide average risk is only 0.4%-2.9%.

Table 2: Population Wide-Risks of Infection Assuming Quanta-Based Risk of 1/3, For Different Values
of the Viral Density Corresponding to the Calibration Quanta Rate. The risk of infection is assumed to
be ⅓ at a given viral density (copies/mL) and then averaged across the distribution of viral densities
measured by Kleiboeker ​et al​ to derive the population-wide risk of infection.
In analyzing the risks of everyday situations, in addition to the usual input parameters of breathing rate,
volume, and so on, we make a few global assumptions:
-​Source strength​: we use the averages from the case studies of 10 quanta/h for breathing and 460
quanta/h for talking.
-​Mask effect:​ For mask efficacy, we assume that masks block 71% of outgoing viral particles ​[65]​ and
50% of incoming particles, so that masks worn by both infected and susceptible individuals reduce the
overall inhaled viral particles by ~85%.
-​Filtration effect​: assume that we have a filter that exchanges the air at a rate ​R​ (i.e. passes the air in the
room through the filter at ​R​ times per hour), and that each pass through the filter reduces the amount
of the virus by a factor ​Q​ < 1. For example, if a filter removes 90% of virions on each pass, ​Q​ = 0.1; a
HEPA filter, which removes 99.97% of particles, has ​Q​ = 0.0003. In the limit that the filter airflow is weak
and the room remains well-mixed at all times, the filter is equivalent to adding an amount ​R​ (1 - ​Q​) to
the air exchange rate and ​λ​3​ = ​R​ (1 - ​Q​). However, if the filter airflow is sufficiently powerful that the
filtration time is small compared to the mixing time, then after time ​t,​ the number of times through the
filter is ​R t​ and the viral reduction factor is ​QR​ t​ = exp(​R​ ln(​Q​) ​t)​ = exp(-​λ3​​ ​t​) -- i.e. ​λ3​​ = -​R​ ln(​Q​) ​[30]​. 20

There is a question of how to model the effect of filtration and HVAC systems generally. While one might worry
that an HVAC system would spread the virus across floors of a building, there have been no documented cases of
this occurring. To the contrary, as a virion makes its way through a complicated maze of ductwork, it encounters
various surfaces, each of which has some probability of capturing the virus or otherwise inactivating it/rendering it

The details of each scenario are shown in the spreadsheet in the Supplemental Materials, and the
summary risks are shown in Table 3. In cases with small numbers of people (e.g. office, classroom), we
assume a single index patient; in cases with large numbers of people (grocery, airplane), we assume a
number of index patients dependent on an infection rate and the venue capacity. In each case,we
present the probability of infection assuming the index patient(s) are only breathing, only talking, and a
mix of breathing and talking (column “scenario”) -- for instance, in an office, talking 15% of the time.
Note also that for the cases of the good/bad office/classroom, we assume the same air exchange rate
for the “good” and “bad” cases (1.5 or 1.9 h​-1​); the difference in risk is due only to the use of masks and
filtration. The absolute risks in which one infected is assumed present are, of course, overstated, since
the probability of an asymptomatic patient present would be low, e.g. as of the time of this publication,
the U.S. infection rate is ~1% ​[66]​. However, assuming the presence of an index patient, scenarios with
even a small proportion of unmasked/unfiltered speaking time (e.g. dinner party, bad office/classroom)
present substantial risks; large volumes (grocery store) or small volumes with strong filtration and
masking (commercial flight) are low risk; a case such as a taxi ride, with a short interaction time but a
very small (~3m​3​) volume, is of intermediate risk. We also emphasize that these calculations take into
account aerosol transmission only and attribute no risk to direct contact through large droplets or
fomites, which may be significant in cases of high density such as a commercial flight.

non-infectious. Thus, one can make a cogent argument that an HVAC system could create some attenuation factor,
possibly much smaller than 1, which would lead to a more powerful viral attenuation than just rated value of its
filter (i.e. more powerful than the -​R​ ln(​Q)​ contribution above). This question of coronavirus attenuation due to
mechanical airflow is a subject that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been studied quantitatively. To be
conservative, we assume there is no attenuation beyond what is in the rated value of the filter.
21
The well-mixed approximation is likely not strictly correct in all cases. For example, the volume of the
supermarket is so large that the timescales do not strictly justify the well-mixed approximation over the entire
volume; however, even if one used a much smaller volume, the risks would still be very low. Similarly, in the case
of an airplane, there is active airflow and recirculation which may create somewhat distinct, smaller zones similar
to those observed in the Guangzhou restaurant case.

Table 3: Summary Risks by Scenario. Each scenario assumes a certain percentage of time breathing
versus talking, as well as the use, or not, of masks and filters. See the Supplemental Materials for the
detailed assumptions of each scenario; these assumptions can be changed by the interested reader.
Special Case: Fomites
Although substantial effort is expended on disinfecting surfaces, the risk of fomite transmission for
SARS-CoV-2 does not appear to be that large. One study estimates that contamination (presumably due
to surfaces) accounts for only 6% of total transmission of COVID-19 ​[37]​. The number of virions required
to induce infection through fomites (e.g. by touching a contaminated surface and then touching some
mucosa such as the nose, eyes, or mouth) may be quite different than the ​N0​​ estimated here for the
aerosol pathway. It is nonetheless interesting to estimate the number of virions that might be
transferred on occasional touching of public surfaces such as handrails or delivered packages. Zhang ​et
al​ performed a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of an office environment to quantify pathways of
influenza transmission ​[67]​. As in Zhang, we assume a sneeze generates 4.75 × 10​-2​ mL of fluid, which
corresponds to ~475,000 viral copies at a viral density of 10​7​ copies/mL. These copies are assumed to be
spread uniformly over a circle of radius ~1 foot (~3000 cm​2​). The hand (~25 cm​2​) touches approximately
1% of this area, but, as Zhang notes, only about 7% of virus on a non-porous surface will transfer to the
hand (the figure for a porous surface is 3%). Further, about 1 in 4 hand-face contacts is with a mucous
membrane, and 35% of the contacts with the membrane successfully transfer virus ​[67]​. Combining all
of these factors, the original virus copies are attenuated by a factor of ~5 × 10​-5​, so that ~25 virions are
ultimately transferred to mucous membranes assuming transfer immediately after the sneeze. Further,
van Doremalen et al. measured SARS-Cov-2 half lives of 3.5 and 6.8 hours on cardboard and plastic,
respectively, that would further attenuate the transferred virus ​[44]​. In the case of a cough, Zhang
estimates a volume emitted of 6.15 × 10​-3​ mL, which would imply transfer of only a few virions ​[67]​.
Assuming no great decrease in the scale of ​N0​​ , this dose of order 1-10 virions would be unlikely to induce
infection.22
Conclusions and Suggestions for Future Research
We estimated ​N0​​ , which determines the probability of infection for a person exposed to ​N​ virions, by
applying a simple model of aerosol transmission of COVID-19 to five fairly well documented cases of
viral transmission. The cases were chosen because exposure times, environment volumes, and infection
rates are well characterized and publicly available. The simple model assumes that the probability of
infection after inhalation of ​N​ virions is 1 – exp(-​N​/​N0​​ ) and that the concentration of viral particles in the
room can decay over time due to exchanges of air and to degradation of the virus particles. We also
assume that the rate at which the infected person is expelling virions is the product of concentration of
viable virions in a volume of exhaled fluid and the volume of fluid exhaled per time.
One of the key differences between our work and prior work is our conclusion that so-called
“superspreading” events can be adequately explained by index individuals with normal viral loads, while
prior works analyzing some of the cases considered here have estimated the viral loads of index
22

Given this small exposure rate and the ubiquity of people touching their eyes, nose, or mouth, one immediately
wonders if fomite transmission of sub-single-quantum doses of virions through touching of contaminated surfaces
and subsequent inadvertent inoculation of the mucosal membranes by face touching might play a role in
protection from infectious disease through natural variolation. A similar effect has been suggested to occur if a low
volume of virions are transmitted between masked individuals when social distancing is being practiced.​[68]

individuals to be higher than typical ​[20,21,29]​. The inference of high viral loads in prior work stems
from an assumption of low volumes of aerosols emitted by index patients (order 1-10 nL/hour) ​[20,21]​.
In contrast, based on Stadnytskyi’s measurements, we estimate ~30 μL/hr emitted are emitted when
speaking ​[33]​. The literature includes a wide variation in measurements of the volume of exhaled fluid
and in the fraction of viable viral particles within that fluid volume ​[9,10,33]​. Further research in those
areas would be very helpful in formulating effective guidelines for reducing the spread of COVID-19.
However, even absent reliable information on those values our model indicates that talking and
breathing release ~460 ​N0​ ​and ~10​N​0​ (quanta)/hour, which can allow people to estimate risks of
everyday activities even if the values of ​N0​ ​are uncertain ​[20–22,28]​. Reducing the uncertainty in the
volume of exhaled fluids in the fraction of viable virus particles would be valuable in framing these risks.
If, as calculated here, these quanta correspond to fairly typical viral densities, the population-wide risks
would be reasonably represented by the range of values calculated here. However, if the five cases here
corresponded to index patients with exceptionally high viral loads, the population-wide risks of aerosols
could be much lower. Applying published values for the concentration of viable virions in a volume of
exhaled fluid and the volume of fluid exhaled per time to our model , we separately obtain ​N0​ ​values for
each of the five cases. Importantly, we obtain a narrow range of ​N​0​ values (~300-2000), despite large
variations in air volumes and exposure times. It is somewhat remarkable that these consistent results
were obtained using a single value of viral load (copies/mL) for an infected person who spreads the
virus, even though the measured values for copies/mL vary over 8-9 orders of magnitude. If the range of
φ(t) is narrow, ​a narrow range in ​N​0​ is a signature of relatively low dispersion in the viral loads of the
index patients considered here. That conclusion is consistent with measurements of viral load as a
function of time indicating that peak infectivity occurs during a very short time when the viral load is a
maximum. Importantly, the modeled and observed maxima fall within a fairly narrow range ​[1,2]​.
Finally, as another check, applying the same values of ​N​0​ to fomite transmission (at an average viral load)
suggests fomites might typically provide order 0.01-0.1 ​N0​​ of exposure, consistent with the observation
that fomites are likely not a large transmission channel.
In sum, our application of a simple aerosol transmission model to five well characterized transmission
events suggests that the viral loads in index patients, and the ​N​0​ values for infection are similar for
COVID-19 and influenza , which also has airborne transmission ​[16,69]​; however, COVID-19
transmission is most probable during a very narrow time window (~1 day) at the onset of symptoms,
whereas for many viruses, including influenza, transmission is dominated by symptomatic patients who
may remain infectious for days ​[1,2]​. When comparing the spread of COVID-19 with the spread of other
viral infections it is important to note that transmission of viruses is greatly reduced if there is
significant herd immunity. Thus, we propose that from “enhanced transmission” due to an index patient
with an average viral load who is just becoming symptomatic may play a very important role in the
COVID-19 pandemic. Transmission by that patient is enhanced because a person or people with no
previous exposure to the virus is ​confined with the index patient in a space that accumulates airborne
particles (amplified by poor ventilation, vigorous activity, or lack of masks). ​ Thus, “superspreader”
events simply represent extreme examples of enhanced transmission in which many people are
simultaneously confined with the index patient. Importantly, we​ also find that the required
confinement period may be as short as an hour and that enhanced transmission can occur at events
attended by only a small number of people, such as family dinners. Our findings support many of the
existing measures being employed to suppress transmission of COVID-19, including mask wearing;

however, the results also suggest that separating people by at least six feet and screening against
individuals with significant symptoms may not strongly reduce COVID-19 transmission.
