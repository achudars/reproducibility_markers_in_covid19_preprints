Abstract

33

Universal masking the health care setting and in the community to contain the spread of

34

SARS-CoV-2 has been recently recommended by the WHO, but supporting data are rare.

35

The City of Jena was the first community in Germany to issue an order on mandatory public

36

masking. Here, we report the development of the number of novel infections in our hospital

37

and in the city of Jena after implementation of universal masking in our hospital and the city.

Introduction

40

There are only a few studies on universal masking during the flu season in hospitals

41

(Esposito et al. 2020), and, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies investigating

42

the efficacy of universal masking in healthy individuals to prevent SARS-CoV-2

43

transmissions. At least, for seasonal human corona virus infection, it was shown that exhaled

44

droplets with a diameter of ≤5 µm containing viral particles can completely be withheld by

45

surgical masks when worn by an infected person (Leung et al. 2020). Arguments against

46

universal masking include a global supply shortage of medical masks, the insufficient

47

filtration of alternative cloth masks compared to medical masks (MacIntyre et al. 2015), a

48

false sense of protection by wearing a mask that may result in failing to maintain physical

49

distance from others, and the risk imposed by incorrect usage of masks by non-trained

50

carriers, e.g. transmitting pathogens from contaminated hands to the mask. Here, we report

51

effects of universal masking that were observed after implementation of (i) mandatory

52

universal masking in the Jena University Hospital (JUH) and (ii) of mandatory community

53

masking in the city of Jena.

54

55

Impact of hospital-wide universal masking

56

The JUH is a tertiary academic hospital with about 1,400 beds and 5,600 employees

57

providing care for about 53,000 inpatients per year. The first detected COVID-19 case in

58

Jena was a physician returning from Austria. Upon his return, he immediately reported to the

59

hospital occupational health department, was tested and isolated at home on 11th March

2020. On 16th March, a nurse that had returned from skiing in Northern Italy became the

61

source of the first nosocomial outbreak involving four patients and two health care workers

62

(HCW). Consequently, extensive screening was conducted on 1,311 HCW – representing

63

one third of the total work force in direct patient care- between 11th March and 12th May

64

resulting in 31 positive cases until 19th March, approximately one week after the first

65

confirmed case (Figure 1). As a consequence, mandatory masking for all personnel involved

66

in patient care was implemented on 20th March. Continued routine staff screening revealed

67

only four HCWs tested positive between 20th March and 12th May. This corresponds to a

68

substantial drop in the rate of new infections among HCWs from 10.1% (31 of 306 screened

69

HCW in this period) before to 0.4% (4 of 1,005 HCW screened in this period) after

70

implementation of universal masking. In addition, a strict containment system was introduced

71

on 5th April, which included placing all patients in single rooms upon admission and SARS-

72

CoV-2 screening regardless of their admitting chief complaint. Thereafter, HCW screening

73

did not reveal any further positive case.

74

75

Impact of community-wide universal masking

76

Jena is the second largest city in Thuringia, Germany, with approximately 111,400

77

inhabitants. Despite thorough contact tracing and isolation of confirmed COVID-19 positive

78

cases by the authorities, a rapid increase in numbers was observed after patient zero

79

(Figure 1). The governmental containment (closing of stores, schools, kindergartens,

80

churches etc.) together with social distancing measures was strictly implemented on 20th

81

March in Jena and four days later in the entire Federal State of Thuringia. As novel infections

82

continued to occur, Jena authorities were the first in Germany to introduce universal

83

community-wide masking, i.e. mandatory covering of the mouth and nose in public buildings

84

and public transport accepting also cloth masks or scarfs. On 24th April, a state-wide

85

recommendation for community-wide masking in combination with first relaxations of the

86

strict lockdown was issued.

87

We also assessed the effectiveness of mandatory community-wide masking in Jena in

88

comparison with the nearby city of Erfurt (Figure 1). Both cities exhibit a similar university as

89

well as socioeconomic structure. Erfurt introduced masking four weeks after Jena,

90

simultaneously with the first relaxation of the lockdown measures.

91

As shown in Figure 1, there were no new COIVD-19 cases in Jena five days after

92

implementation, which is in line with the average incubation time of SARS-CoV-2. While in

93

Erfurt, COVID-19 continued to spread and only ceased after the same community-wide

94

masking was imposed.

95

We are aware that mere association is not causation and that our conclusions are limited by

96

the observational nature of the data. However, it is uncertain whether an ethically sound trial

97

on the controversial issue of mandatory community-wide masking will ever be performed.

98

Therefore, our observations support the notion to implement universal masking in both health

99

care as well as community settings as considering the ensuing reduced infection-rates.

100

Given the risk-benefit ratio, we consider universal masking combined with social distancing

101

as a suitable measure to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Figure 1: Daily reported newly confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and A)
corresponding cumulative cases per 1,000 health care workers (HCW) of Jena University
Hospital (JUH, 1,500 beds as well as per 100,000 inhabitants of the Thuringian cities B) Jena
and C) Erfurt. All reported cases comprise only the first SARS-CoV-2 test results. Results of
multiple testing are excluded because all infected subjects were reported by full name and
address to the respective Public Health Departments. D) For comparison, the cumulative
number per 100,000 inhabitants in the State of Thuringia is provided. Implemented measures
are color-coded.
Of note, “negative” bars for daily reported novel infections in Jena and Erfurt are explained
by re-classification of individual COVID-19 cases as non-COVID-19 after quality control of
the respective data and laboratory reports by the State Health Department of Thuringia. The
Population was taken from the Thuringian State Office of Statistics (31st December 2019).
