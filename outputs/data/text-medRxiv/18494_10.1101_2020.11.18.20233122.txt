Abstract
Background
To limit societal and economic costs of lockdown measures, public health strategies are
needed that control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and simultaneously allow lifting of disruptive
measures. Regular universal random screening of large proportions of the population
regardless of symptoms has been proposed as a possible control strategy.
Methods
We developed a mathematical model that includes test sensitivity depending on infectiousness
for PCR-based and antigen-based tests, and different levels of onward transmission for testing
and non-testing parts of the population. Only testing individuals participate in high-risk
transmission events, allowing more transmission in case of unnoticed infection. We calculated
the required testing interval and coverage to bring the effective reproduction number due to
universal random testing (Rrt) below 1, for different scenarios of risk behavior of testing and
non-testing individuals.
Findings
With R0 = 2.5, lifting all control measures for tested subjects with negative test results would
require 100% of the population being tested every three days with a rapid test method with
similar sensitivity as PCR-based tests. With remaining measures in place reflecting Re = 1.3,
80% of the population would need to be tested once a week to bring Rrt below 1. With lower
proportions tested and with lower test sensitivity, testing frequency should increase further to
bring Rrt below 1. With similar Re values for tested and non-tested subjects, and with tested
subjects not allowed to engage in higher risk events, at least 80% of the populations needs to
test every five days to bring Rrt below. The impact of the test-sensitivity on the reproduction
number is far less than the frequency of testing.
Interpretation
Regular universal random screening followed by isolation of infectious individuals is not a
viable strategy to reopen society after controlling a pandemic wave of SARS-CoV-2. More
targeted screening approaches are needed to better use rapid testing such that it can effectively
complement
other
control
measures.

Introduction
Intensive public health measures can effectively control transmission of SARS-CoV-2, yet at
high societal and economic costs. Innovative strategies that allow lifting of societally
disruptive control measures without increasing transmission and initiating a next pandemic
wave are, therefore, urgently needed. Testing for infection with SARS-CoV-2 followed by
contact tracing is instrumental in controlling spread, but is seriously hampered by diagnostic
delays inherent to the use of high-throughput RT-PCR [Kretzschmar et al. (2020)]. Novel
rapid testing technologies, such as antigen-based tests and LAMP, can reduce diagnostic
delays to several minutes [Rödel et al. (2020)]. Moreover, such tests can identify symptomatic
and asymptomatically infected subjects with high Yet, compared to PCR-based testing, test
sensitivity of rapid tests ranges from 70% to 90%, with false-negative results reported mainly
in samples with low viral loads (i.e., high CT values), that may reflect subjects with low
likelihood of being infectious [Gremmels et al. (2020)]. Nonetheless, such tests can facilitate
a shift from finding infected individuals to finding infectious individuals [Mina et al. (2020)],
thus potentially having sufficient impact on transmission to control spread effectively, i.e.,
with a minimum set of acceptable additional measures.
Over the course of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, testing strategies focused
mainly on symptomatic individuals and individuals in high-risk groups (e.g., healthcare
workers, staff and residents of long-term care facilities). The impact of these strategies on the
reproduction number has been investigated in a modelling study [Grassly et al. (2020)]. Later
into the pandemic, many countries expanded testing to include individuals, irrespective of
whether they are displaying symptoms. Expanded testing strategies are based on the
assumption that undetected asymptomatic and mild cases not reporting to healthcare can have
a substantial impact on transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Population-wide testing at regular time
intervals, also referred to as mass screening or universal testing, is now under serious
consideration as a strategy to maintain incidence at manageable levels despite drastic
reductions of control measures that are most disruptive to society [European Center for
Disease Prevention and Control, (2020), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (2020)]. Such an approach refers to testing a certain (substantial) part of the
population, irrespective of the presence of symptoms, followed by isolation of infected
subjects to interrupt transmission. The ultimate goal of such a strategy is to maintain the
effective reproduction number Re below 1, once it has been brought to such a level by the
intensive measures. However, the effectiveness of such a strategy has not been determined.
Apart from testing frequency, the effectiveness of regular universal testing depends on at least
five other variables: (1) test sensitivity, which may vary according to the day since acquisition
of infection [Kucirka et al. (2020)]; (2) the proportion of the population tested; (3) the
effectiveness of isolation of infected persons; (4) the risk of transmission originating from
subjects with false-negative test results and of (5) those that were not tested. Variables (4) and
(5) relate to the level of reduction in R0 that is achieved by a basic set of control measures that
remains in place. Subjects with false-negative test results may no longer adhere to these
control measures and, therefore, may create conditions in which the number of secondary
cases per primary case can grow above the threshold 1, and even approach levels observed at
the onset of the pandemic, for which R0 is typically between 2 and 3 [Li et al. (2020); Park M
et al. (2020)].
We use an epidemiological model to determine the effects of regular universal testing, as
defined above, on the effective reproduction number Re of SARS-CoV-2, for different
fractions of the population being tested at different time intervals, and with different levels of

transmission for tested and non-tested subjects. For simplicity, we define effectiveness as an
overall reproduction number due to the random testing strategy (Rrt) below 1 for the whole
population with different levels of reopening society. The basic scenario is that all measures
are lifted for tested subjects, and that non-tested subjects adhere to measures that control
SARS-CoV-2 transmission so that Re = 1.3. We also analyze scenarios where all subjects
adhere to measures that control SARS-CoV-2 transmission to Re = 1.3 or where all measures
are lifted for all subjects. Complete reopening of society (i.e., lifting of all measures) allows
SARS-CoV-2 transmission with Re that is equal to R0 which we assume to be either 2.0 or 2.5.
Methods
In this model we distinguish individuals who participate in regular universal screening
(‘testing individuals’) and those who do not (‘non-testing individuals’). We assume that
testing individuals participate in high-risk transmission events (i.e., where large crowds
gather), and, thus, could generate more secondary infections than non-testing individuals, who
are not permitted at these high-risk events. We assume that testing and non-testing individuals
mix randomly during low-risk events, and that during high-risk events there is only
transmission between testing individuals. Given a test-strategy — which is defined by a
combination of the proportion of the population who tests regularly and the time interval
between subsequent tests — we calculate the number of secondary cases of testing and nontesting individuals and how they are distributed over these two categories. Knowledge of
these numbers allows us to determine the overall reproduction number Rrt for a given testing
strategy.
In the model, the probability of onward transmission and the test sensitivity depend on the
time since acquisition of infection. Both are described by discrete time distributions in time
units of day. We assume a generation time distribution which has a Weibull-shape with shape
parameter of 2.2826 and scale parameter of 5.665 [Ferretti et al. (2020)]. The discretized
probability distribution between day t – 1 and day t is denoted by g(t). We further assume that
a fraction p of the individuals in the population gets tested every k days for SARS-CoV-2
(testing individuals). The sensitivity of this test depends on the time since the tested
individual got infected. This time-dependent sensitivity, s(t), was based on the results of
[Gremmels et al. (2020), Moeren van der et al. (2020)], (see Figure 1 and Supplementary
Table S1). In our basic scenario we assume the same sensitivity for an antigen-based test and
a PCR-test. As there is little data to accurately determine the sensitivity of a test to detect
infectiousness, we also performed a sensitivity analysis in which assume that on every day
since acquisition of the virus test sensitivity for detecting infectiousness was 80%.
We assume that non-testing individuals infect on average Rn individuals. This Rn-value
reflects the level of existing transmission prevention measures. We assume these infections to
be proportionally distributed over testing and non-testing individuals, i.e., a non-testing
individual infects, on average, Ktn = pRn testing individuals and Knn = (1 – p)Rn non-testing
individuals (Figure 2). Testing individuals may have a higher reproduction number due to
behavioral aspects, as having a negative test result may allow them to participate in higherrisk events. On the other hand, their reproduction number is reduced after a positive test result
as the individual will then be isolated. A testing individual infects on average Knt non-testing
individuals and Ktt testing individuals (Figure 2). In the following we show how these
numbers depend on the testing strategy.

In summary, Rrt is the reproduction number in a population where regular rapid testing is
implemented. All individuals in the tested population are tested at regular time intervals and
are allowed to participate in high-risk events if tested negative. We analyzed how Rrt depends
on the proportion of the population being tested and the time interval of testing. We assumed
that this testing occurs in a population with all measures lifted (hence the potential for
transmission resembles R0 = 2.5), or in a population where other measures have led to some
sustained reduction of transmission (R0 = 2.0 or R0 = 1.3). We determine the requirements for
regular testing intervals and coverage to control transmission in these three scenarios.
Results
Based on the time-dependent sensitivity of diagnostic testing (Figure 1) the likelihood of
infected subjects to remain undetected per day since acquisition of infection declines rapidly

with more intensive testing (Figure 3). To detect an infected person around the time of highest
infectivity (around day 5) with 50% probability, a screenings interval of 3 days or less is
needed.
In Figure 4 we have depicted scenarios in which the transmission level (Rn) is identical for
testing and non-testing individuals, i.e., testing individuals do not engage more in high-risk
activities than non-testing individuals. If Rn is 1.5 — corresponding to a slight re-opening of
society — at least 80% of the population needs to be tested every five days to bring a
reproduction number of 1.5 to Rrt to a value below 1. In theory, regular testing can control an
epidemic with a reproduction number of 3, but this would require daily testing of the whole
population (Figure 4).
Subsequently, in Figure 5 we have depicted the associations between test frequency, the
proportion of the population being tested and the ‘risk behavior’ of those with false-negative
test results for a test sensitivity as given in Table 1a. In these analyses we have assumed
isolation efficacy of 80% and that all subjects tested positive will isolate and will refrain
completely from high-risk activities. We assume that testing individuals without a positive
test result (including those with a false-negative test result) will continue to participate in risk
behavior that would lead to transmission of a virus with a corresponding expected number of
new cases of 2.5, 2.0 or 1.3 (depending on the extent to which existing control measures have
been lifted). The fraction of the population not tested has a risk behavior that would lead to
transmission of a virus with a corresponding expected number of new cases of 1.3.
In Figure 5, the parameter region of testing frequency and the proportion being tested where
the overall Rrt is below 1 is depicted in green. For Rt = 2.5 (Figure 5C) this would only be
achieved if 100% of the population would be tested every three days, when using a rapid test
method with similar sensitivity as PCR-based tests. For Rt = 1.3, testing 80% of the
population once a week would be sufficient for controlling the epidemic (Figure 5Aa), for Rt
= 2.0 testing 80% of the population every three days would be sufficient. With lower
proportions tested, testing frequency should increase further to bring Rrt below 1. With a test
that has a 10% lower sensitivity than the PCR test, the total population would need to be
tested every 2.5 days to bring Rrt below 1 (Supplementary Figure 2).
A scenario with Rn = 1.3 reflects a situation with considerable control measures kept in place
compared to the uncontrolled state where R0 = 2.5. In the Netherlands, this would reflect the
situation in August 2020, with universal social distancing, working from home if possible, not
working with (minor) respiratory tract infection symptoms, all large events prohibited, bars
open only with seated placing, active testing with isolation of symptomatic people and contact
tracing. In such circumstances, the proportion of the population to be tested weekly to reduce
the overall Rrt to a value below 1 needs to be 60% when using PCR-based testing sensitivity
and 80% for antigen-based testing sensitivity.
The impact of the test-sensitivity on the reproduction number is far less than the frequency of
testing (Figure 7). Sensitivity analyses, in which we assume that on every day since
acquisition of the virus test sensitivity for detecting infectiousness was 80% did not change
interpretation (Supplementary Figures S3-S6).

Discussion
The results of our analysis suggest that regular universal random screening followed by
isolation of infectious individuals is not a viable strategy to reopen society after controlling a
pandemic wave of SARS-CoV-2. The underlying mechanisms for failure are the suboptimal
sensitivity of any testing method during the first days after acquisition in combination with an
average generation time of four days and a basic reproduction number between 2 and 3.
To our knowledge, our study is the first to address the prospects of regular screening for
SARS-CoV-2 infection irrespective of whether the individuals have symptoms for controlling
the ongoing pandemic. Previous studies focused on the assessment of screening strategies for
symptomatic individuals only and/or individuals in high-risk groups such as long-term care
facilities, university and college students [Gassly et al. (2020), Delaunay et al. (2020), Paltiel
et al (2020), Chang et al (2020), Martin et al. (2020)].
As any model, our model is a simplification of reality, but the major dynamical aspects of the
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have been included. Importantly, some parameters were
deliberately rather optimistic, such as the effectiveness of isolation practices, the complete
decline in high-risk activities for those being tested positive, absence of introductions from
abroad and equal test sensitivity for antigen and PCR-based tests. Our findings are, therefore,
most likely too optimistic.
The underlying mechanism leading to failure is the inevitable return, when lifting all
previously imposed distancing measures, of transmission to values approaching R0, as long as
herd immunity is too low to substantially reduce the effective reproduction number by the
natural infection process. In the Netherlands, as in many other countries, an estimated 5-10%
of the population had detectable immunity against SARS-CoV-2 after the first pandemic wave
[National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, 2020] .
Simplifications of our model are the absence of explicit age or network structure and a
uniform view of human behavior that only differentiates between testing and non-testing
individuals. Our quantitative results should, therefore, be interpreted with care. Younger
individuals have a lower risk of complications due to COVID-19 and may, therefore, be more
likely to participate in higher-risk activities and will have — on average — higher numbers of
contacts. This could lead to higher reproduction numbers for testing individuals, making our
estimates too optimistic. We did also not consider other factors important for implementation
of regular universal random testing, such as costs, logistics, technical feasibility, resource
availability and barriers to testing.
Naturally, scenarios must be developed that allow society to reopen safely after controlling
a pandemic wave. Here, we have analyzed the likelihood of repeated universal random
screening being successful, as this strategy is now proposed in many countries. Other
population-wide testing approaches that have been used in various countries include
household testing [David et al. (2020), Park Y et al. (2020)] and testing of incoming travelers
[US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2020), Normile et al. (2020)]. Further
analytical work will include scenarios with augmented contact tracing and screening based on
observed transmission patterns, occurrence of high-risk events, or targeting high-risk
populations, and combinations of these. Contact tracing may have different effects on the
effectiveness of universal screening strategies. For instance, contact tracing may only
substantially add to universal screening effectiveness if contacts are traced faster than through

regular universal screening. On the other hand, if contact tracing occurs too fast, test
sensitivity may be low and infectiousness may be missed if not rescreened after a few days.
This can be overcome by quarantining traced contacts, even with negative test results.
The sensitivity to detect infectious subjects in the early stage of infection is an important
parameter in our model. Yet, in the absence of accurate data, the infectiousness in time can
only be derived indirectly. The relation between test-sensitivity, infectiousness and the effect
of isolation is complex, for at least two reasons. First, the generation distribution describes the
average proportion of infected subjects being infectious since the moment of virus acquisition
(Ferretti et al. 2020). This distribution depends on preventive measures taken. For instance,
effective isolation after symptom onset, will reduce the likelihood of transmission at the later
stages of the infectious period, thereby changing the generation time and shortening the
generation interval. The correct distribution of infectiousness, therefore, depends on the
measures taken to reduce the reproduction number.
Second, there is considerable variation in timing of infectivity between individuals. As
infectivity, viral load and test sensitivity are correlated, this implies similar variation in testsensitivity between individuals. Subjects being highly infectious shortly after virus acquisition
will most likely have high viral loads at that time, and hence, higher likelihoods to be detected
by testing. Consider a test that will detect all individuals who are infectious, but not those in
their latency period, and all detected subjects will be isolated immediately with 100%
effective isolation. If 10% of infected individuals are infectious one day after acquisition, only
10% of all individuals tested on that day, respective to acquisition, will be detected and
isolated. Yet, this will prevent transmission at that point of time and only latently infected
individuals that become infectious at later stages will contribute to transmission.
Assuming a test sensitivity for detecting infectious subjects of 10% will then be an
underestimate, whereas assuming a test sensitivity of 100% will be an overestimate. We have,
therefore, considered several scenarios for the infectiousness profile and test sensitivity.
We urge policy makers to carefully determine the likelihood of success of future strategies
before widespread implementation. Mathematical modelling is a possible tool for such
analyses, that may also guide targeted experiments to validate model findings or to obtain
more quantitative information on critical parameters.
In conclusion, our findings provide evidence that a strategy of regular universal random
testing would require unrealistic high testing frequencies to reopen society while maintaining
control of virus transmission.
