ABSTRACT
Background The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan,
Hubei province, China, and was characterized as pandemic by the World Health
Organization. Diabetes mellitus is an established risk factor for poor clinical outcomes,
but the association of diabetes with the prognosis of COVID-19 have not been
reported yet.
Methods In this cohort study, we retrospectively reviewed 258 consecutive
hospitalized COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes at the West Court of Union
Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China,
recruited from January 29 to February 12, 2020. The cases were confirmed by
real-time PCR and the demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiological, and treatment
data were collected and analyzed. Prognosis was defined as hospitalization,
discharged survivor and death, which was followed up until March 12, 2020.
Results Of the 258 hospitalized patients (63 with diabetes) with COVID-19, the
median age was 64 years (range 23-91), and 138 (53.5%) were male. No significant
differences in age and sex were identified between patients with and without diabetes.
Common symptoms included fever (82.2%), dry cough (67.1%), polypnea (48.1%),
and fatigue (38%). Patients with diabetes had significantly higher leucocyte and
neutrophil counts, and higher levels of fasting blood glucose, serum creatinine, urea
nitrogen and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB at admission compared with those
without diabetes. COVID-19 patients with diabetes were more likely to develop
severe or critical disease condition with more complications at presentation, and had

higher incidence rates of antibiotic therapy, non-invasive and invasive mechanical
ventilation, and death (11.1% vs. 4.1%). Cox proportional hazard model showed that
diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=3.64; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09, 12.21)
and fasting blood glucose (aHR=1.19; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.31) were associated with the
fatality of COVID-19, adjusting for potential confounders.
Conclusions Diabetes mellitus is associated with greater disease severity and a higher
risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19. Primary and secondary prevention
strategies are needed for COVID-19 patients with diabetes.

Introduction
Since December 2019, China has been experiencing an outbreak of pneumonia with a
novel coronavirus [1], which was officially named as Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on
Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared
that Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.
WHO characterized COVID-19 as pandemic, as it has spread rapidly throughout
China and more than 100 countries in the following two months after outbreak,
causing more than 150,000 confirmed cases and thousands of death by March 15,
2020. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus (Î²-CoV lineage B), and
shares 79% of sequence with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
(SARS-CoV), but only 50% homology with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [2, 3].
China has a climbing prevalence rate of diabetes in recent decades. According to the
latest nationally representative cross-sectional survey among 170287 participants in
2013 in mainland China, the overall prevalence of diabetes was 10.9% in adults and
20.2% in the elderly [4]. Diabetic patients are more susceptible to be infected by
bacteria, virus, and fungus than individuals without diabetes owing to relatively lower
immune function [5, 6]. As a result, these patients might be at an increased risk of

SARS-CoV-2 infection and poorer prognosis.
Despite many studies have described the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 so far
[1, 7, 8, 9], information with respect to diabetes among these patients, have not been
well characterized yet. In the current study, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical
data of 258 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, and compared the
differences in clinical characteristics, laboratory markers, treatment strategies, and
short-term prognosis including death between patients with and without diabetes. We
hope that these findings will provide new insights into the risk stratification, disease
management, and therapeutic strategies for diabetic patients with COVID-19.

Methods
Study design and participants
This was a retrospective cohort study among patients with COVID-19. All
consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were
admitted to several isolation wards at the West Court of Union Hospital of Huazhong
University of Science and Technology from January 29 to February 12, 2020, were
enrolled in the study. West Court of Union Hospital, located in Wuhan, Hubei
Province, the epidemic areas of COVID-19, is one of the major tertiary teaching
hospitals, and has been mainly responsible for the treatments of COVID-19 patients
assigned by the government. Professor Pinhua Pan, from Department of Respiratory
Medicine in Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, was assigned as the director
of National Medical Team of aiding Hubei to guide the clinical work for the treatment

of COVID-19 in Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology,
Wuhan. All patients with COVID-19 enrolled in this study were diagnosed according
to World Health Organization interim guidance [10]. This study was approved by the
institutional ethics board of Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and
Technology and ethics board of Xiangya Hospital, Central South University
(No.202003049). Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of
the designated hospital for emerging infectious diseases.
Measurements
Demographic, clinical features, laboratory, and radiological findings, treatment
strategy, and short-term prognosis data of the patients were obtained from their
medical records. Clinical outcomes were followed up to March 12, 2020. All the data
were checked by two senior physicians (P.P and J.Z). All patients enrolled to this
study were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, and the diagnostic criteria of
COVID-19 was based on the positive detection of viral nuclear acids. The severity of
COVID-19 was defined based on the diagnostic and treatment guideline (Version 5-7)
by the National Health Committee of China. Severe subtype was defined if a patient
met one of the following criteria: 1) Respiratory distress with respiratory frequency â¥
30/min; 2) Pulse oximeter oxygen saturation â¤ 93% at rest; 3) Oxygenation index
(artery partial pressure of oxygen/inspired oxygen fraction, PaO2/FiO2) â¤ 300 mmHg.
Critically ill subtype followed above criteria, and must meet one of the following
criteria: 1) Needs mechanical ventilation because of respiratory failure; 2) Shock; 3)
Combined with multiple organ failure that needs to be admitted to intensive care unit

(ICU).
Pharyngeal swab specimens were collected from each patients for viral nucleic acid
detection of SARS-CoV-2 using a real-time reverse-transcriptase
polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay as previously described [11]. The viral
nucleic acid testing were carried out by the clinical laboratory of Union Hospital of
Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan. Laboratory indicators on
admission, included the numbers of leucocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, percentages
of lymphocyte, eosinophils, concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin
(PCT), fasting blood glucose (FBG), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum creatine
kinase (CREA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB),
D-dimer, international normalized ratio (INR), prothrombin time (PT), activated
partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and thrombin time (TT) were determined for
each patient. All medical laboratory data were generated by the clinical laboratory of
Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
All data were reviewed and collected onto the standardized forms from the electronic
medical records in the hospital, including case report forms, nursing records,
laboratory and radiological findings were reviewed. Two senior physicians (P.P and
J.Z) independently reviewed the data. Information on demographic data, symptoms,
preexisting chronic comorbidities, computed tomographic images of chest, laboratory
results were collected. All treatment strategy were collected during the hospitalization,
such as antiviral therapy, antibiotic therapy, use of corticosteroid, and respiratory
support. The time from illness onset to hospital admission were also recorded.

Definition of conditions
Patients were identified as having diabetes if there was a documented medical history.
Cardiovascular disease included coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, or a
history of myocardial infarction; reports of isolated hypertension were not included.
Chronic pulmonary disease included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
allergic airway disease or the use of supplemental oxygen at home. The presence of
ARDS was designated by The berlin definition [12]. Cardiac injury was identified
when the serum level of hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (hsTNI) was above the
upper limit of the normal range (>28 pg/mL) or new abnormalities shown in
electrocardiography and echocardiography [13]. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was
classified on the basis of the highest serum creatinine level or urine output criteria
based on KDIGO clinical practice guideline for AKI [14]. Prognosis was defined as
discharged from hospital, not discharged yet, and death during hospitalization. The
followed-up observation was conducted before March 12, 2020.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were shown as median and interquartile range (IQR), and
compared by Mann-Whitney test since most laboratory data were with skewed
distribution. Categorical variables were presented as counts and proportions, and
compared by Chi-square test or Fisherâs exact test. The Cox proportional hazard
model was used to determine the associations of diabetes and FBG with fatality of
COVID-19, adjusting for potential confounders. Adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) with 95%
confidence interval (CI) were presented as the effect size. All statistical analyses and

graphs were generated and plotted using the GraphPad Prism version 7.00 software
(GraphPad Software Inc) or SPSS version 25.0 (IBM, United States). A P value <0.05
was considered statistically significant.

Results
Baseline characteristics of the patients of COVID-19
A total of 258 consecutive laboratory-confirmed patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection
were included and analyzed in the study, and 24% of them had diabetes. Demographic
and clinical characteristics of the patients on admission were summarized by diabetes
in Table 1. The median age was 64 years (IQR, 56-70; range, 23-92 years), and 138
(53.5%) were male. The median durations from illness onset to hospital admission
were 12 days (IQR, 7-15). The most common symptoms at the illness onset were
fever (212 [82.2%]), dry cough (173[67.1%]), polypnea (124 [48.1%]), and fatigue
(98 [38%]). One hundred seventy-four patients (67.4%) had other preexisting chronic
comorbidities, including hypertension (37.3%), cardiovascular disease (14.9%),
cerebrovascular disease (4.4%), chronic pulmonary disease (3.6%), chronic kidney
disease (3.69.2%), chronic liver disease (1.2%), and cancer (4.4%). There were no
significant differences between patients with and without diabetes, with respect to age,
sex, days of illness before hospital admission, and clinical signs and symptoms.
Compared with those without diabetes, diabetic patients were more likely to have
comorbidities of cardiovascular disease (23.8% vs. 12.3%, P=0.027) and chronic
kidney disease (8.8% vs. 2.1%, P=0.027).

Laboratory and radiological findings in patients of COVID-19 on admission
The laboratory and radiological findings on admission of the COVID-19 patients with
or without diabetes were presented in Table 2. The blood cell tests showed that most
patients (81.0%) had normal leukocytes on the hospital admission, while 10.1% had
increased leucocytes numbers and 8.9% had decreased numbers. However, the
diabetic COVID-19 patients had a higher median leucocytes number (6.34[IQR: 4.66,
8.15] vs. 5.45[IQR: 4.31, 7.19], P=0.039) and median neutrophils numbers (4.49[IQR:
3.12, 6.91] vs. 3.82[IQR: 2.81, 5.39], P=0.022) compared with non-diabetic patients.
COVID-19 patients with diabetes had more leucocytes increase (20.6% vs. 6.7%) but
less leucocytes decrease (4.8% vs. 10.3%, P=0.004) than those patients without DM.
The neutrophil-to-lymphocytes ratio (NLR) was significantly higher in diabetic
patients compared to those without diabetes (median: 4.56[IQR: 2.69, 9.51] vs.
median: 3.8[IQR: 2.25, 6.31], P=0.043). Interestingly, decreased eosinophil counts
were also common in these patients (43%), but no significant difference in
eosinophils counts and the ratio of patients with decreased eosinophil counts was
found in patients with or without DM. Besides, a positive correlation between
eosinophil and lymphocytes numbers on admission was observed (Figure S1), which
was consistent with previous study [15]. Other laboratory findings showed no
significant differences between the two groups of patients with respect to serum levels
of CRP, PCT, and LDH, but diabetic COVID-19 patients had higher levels of FBG

(median: 7.54[IQR: 6.37, 10.62] vs. median: 5.81[IQR: 5.32, 6.59], P<0.001), CREA
(median: 74[IQR: 64.25, 95.78] vs. median: 67.8[IQR: 57.2, 78.23], P=0.005), BUN
(median: 5.9[IQR: 4.09, 8.62] vs. median: 4.41[IQR: 3.58, 5.57], P<0.001), and
CK-MB (median: 14[IQR: 10, 17] vs. median: 11[IQR: 9, 14], P=0.042) than
non-diabetic patients. For coagulation function markers, patients with diabetes
showed a slightly longer of TT (median: 16.1[15.25, 16.65] vs. median: 15.5[IQR:
14.9, 16.23], P=0.035) than those patients without diabetes. The radiological CT
images showed the majority of patients (99.6%) had abnormal results with bilateral
lesions.

Analysis of severity, treatment and prognosis of patients with COVID-19
Next, we compared the severity, treatment, and short-term prognosis of the
COVID-19 patients with and without diabetes in Table 3. Compared with
non-diabetes subjects, diabetic patients were more likely to develop severely or
critically ill subtypes (P=0.028) with more complications including acute respiratory
distress (38.1% vs. 19.5%, P=0.001), acute cardiac injury (14.5% vs. 5.1%, P=0.016),
and had more antibiotic therapy (74.6% vs. 59.0%, P=0.026), non-invasive and
invasive mechanical ventilation (P=0.037). As of March 12, 2020, only 33.7%
patients were discharged from the hospital. Patients with diabetes had a higher fatality
rate than those without diabetes (11.1% vs. 4.1%, P=0.039).

Analysis of associations of diabetes and FBG with death in COVID-19 patients
To further assess the association of diabetes and FBG with the fatality of COVID-19,
Cox proportional hazard model was carried out, and the results (Table 4) showed that
comorbid diabetes was an independent risk factor for death in COVID-19 patients,
after adjusting for age (aHR=2.804; 95% CI: 1.008, 7.797; P=0.048) or additionally
adjusted for the cardiovascular diseases and chronic kidney diseases (aHR =2.840; 95%
CI: 1.007, 8.007; P=0.048) or additionally adjusting for laboratory markers
(aHR=3.641; 95% CI: 1.086, 12.214; P=0.036). We also found that higher FBG level
on admission was an independent predictor for death in COVID patients as well, after
adjusting for the aforementioned covariates (AHR=1.187, 95% CI: 1.078, 1.306;
P<0.001).

DISCUSSION
In this retrospective cohort study, we characterized 258 COVID-19 patients with
respect to demographics, clinical features, preexisting chronic comorbidities,
treatment, and short-term prognosis. We found that COVID-19 patients had a
relatively high proportion (24%) of diabetes, and demonstrated that diabetes was
associated with alterations in laboratory markers, severer clinical subtype at

presentation, and poorer prognosis compared to those without diabetes, after
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
To the best of our knowledge, the study was the first to investigate the clinical
characteristics and prognosis of COVID-19 patients with diabetes. The prevalence of
diabetes mellitus is sharply climbing in China during the past decades. According to
the latest nationally representative cross-sectional survey in mainland China in 2013,
the estimated prevalence of diabetes in elderly participants (â¥60 years old) was 20.2%
[4]. Previous studies reported 9% to 14% prevalence of diabetes in COVID-19
patients [1, 8, 13, 15]. Here, we reported a higher prevalence rate of diabetes in these
patients, which might be due to the larger proportion of geriatric patients infected by
SARS-CoV-2 in our study. The median age of all the participants was 64 years old,
which was older than the data previously reported [1, 7, 8]. In the current study, 53.5%
of the patients were male, and the percentage is similar to that reported by Wang et al
[8] and Zhang et al [15]. Besides diabetes mellitus, hypertension (38.0%) and
cardiovascular diseases (15.1%) were also common underlying chronic illness, and
diabetic COVID-19 patients seemed to have more comorbidities of cardiovascular
diseases and chronic kidney diseases in the current study.
The laboratory findings on admission showed that leucocytes and neutrophils counts
and the proportion of increased leucocytes were higher in COVID-19 patients with
diabetes than those without, which might be explained by the fact that diabetic
patients were more susceptible to pathogens after viral infection due to lower immune
function. During hospitalization, the diabetic patients were more likely to receive

antibiotic therapy as well. Decreased lymphocytes counts and eosinophil counts were
also common in these patients; this was consistent with the results of previous studies
[15]. However, no significant differences were found in the cell counts and percentage
lymphocytes and eosinophil counts between COVID-19 patients with or without
diabetes. The data revealed that diabetic COVID-19 patients had a higher NLR, which
was recently reported as a predictor of severity of COVID-19 in the early stage [16].
We found that COVID-19 patients with diabetes were more likely to develop severely
or critically ill subtypes, including more complications with ARDS, acute cardiac
injury, resulting in receiving more antibiotic therapy and mechanical ventilation. Cox
regression model indicated that both diabetes and FBG level on admission were
independent predictor for the fatality of COVID, after adjusting for potential
confounders. Based on these findings, we deliberately concluded that diabetes was
associated with deteriorated disease severity and poorer prognosis in patients with
COVID-19.
This is the first report to demonstrated that the diabetes was associated with greater
disease severity and poorer prognosis in COVID-19 patients. An increasing number of
studies have shown that diabetic patients had higher mortality and morbidity of severe
medical illness, such as myocardial infarction, and high FBG plays an independent
predictive role in hospitalized non-diabetic patients as well [17, 18, 19]. Diabetes has
also been identified as a significant risk factor for severe disease following respiratory
tract infections [20]. Several studies demonstrated that diabetes was associated with
increased the risks of severity and mortality after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV

infection [21, 22, 23, 24], and FBG level was an independent predictor for fatality in
patients with SARS [21].
Additionally, we also found diabetic COVID-19 patients had more preexisting
cardiovascular disease, and were more susceptible to have acute cardiac injury during
hospitalization, which might increase the possibility of short-term poor prognosis in
diabetic patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Previous study reported that diabetic
patients who received intensive glycemic control had lower risk of cardiovascular
events [25]. Nevertheless, we could deliberately conclude that diabetes and FBG were
independent predictive risks for poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients after adjusting
those cofounders and mediators.
Diabetes results in a proinflammatory homeostatic immune response skewed toward
helper T cell 1 (Th1) and T17 cells and a decrease in regulatory T cells (Treg) [26].
Immune dysfunction of diabetes alone or following infection has been reported for a
wide variety of immune cells, not just macrophages, monocytes and CD4+ T cells [26].
A recent study reported the number of total T cells, CD4+ and CD8+T cell subsets
were substantially reduced and functionally exhausted in COVID-19 patients,
especially among geriatric and critically ill patients who required ICU admission [27].
Kulcsar KA et al showed that diabetic mice presented a prolonged phase of severe
disease and delayed recovery after MERS-CoV infection, which was attributed to
dysregulated immune response with lower inflammatory monocytes/macrophages and
CD4+ T cells [28]. Thus, optimal management of diabetes and intensive glycemic
control may help prevent the occurrence of life-threatening infections and

complications associated with diabetes mellitus, and the increased susceptibility of
infections due to impaired cellular and humoral immunity.
Limitations
Several limitations should not be ignored in the study. First, this study was a
retrospective study, with the fact that we included a very small proportion of patients
with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan. Berkson bias might be
introduced since asymptomatic patients and those with mild symptoms were less
likely to be enrolled. Second, due to the massive number of patients and the lack of
medical resources, the interval from the illness onset to hospital admission was more
than 10 days for most patients, which could further complicate and deteriorate the
illness, with different extent. Nevertheless, patients with diabetes had similar interval
from onset to admission compared with those without diabetes. Third, at the time of
the study submission, most of patients were not discharged yet, and the final survival
outcome could not be determined now, and the long-term prognosis were not
observed.

Conclusions
In the current study, we demonstrated that diabetes mellitus is associated with greater
disease severity and poorer short-term outcomes including death. Stronger personal
prophylactic strategies are advised for diabetic patients, and more intensive
surveillance and treatment should be considered when they are infected with
SARS-CoV-2, especially in geriatric patients or those had preexisting comorbidities.
