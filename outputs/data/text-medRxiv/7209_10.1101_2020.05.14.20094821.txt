Abstract

13

During the Covid-19 pandemic, pristine and reprocessed N95 respirators are crucial equipment

14

towards limiting nosocomial infections. The NIOSH test certifying the N95 rating, however,

15

poorly simulates aerosols in healthcare settings, limiting our understanding of the exposure risk

16

for healthcare workers wearing these masks, especially reprocessed ones. We used experimental

17

conditions that simulated the sizes, densities and airflow properties of infectious aerosols in

18

healthcare settings. We analyzed the penetration and leakage of aerosols through pristine and

19

reprocessed N95 respirators. Seven reprocessing methods were investigated. Our findings

20

suggest that pristine and properly reprocessed N95 respirators effectively limit exposure to

21

infectious aerosols, but that care must be taken to avoid the elucidated degradation mechanisms

22

and limit noncompliant wear.

23

During the Covid-19 pandemic, disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators (N95 FFRs) are

24

crucial equipment towards limiting nosocomial infections.1 To address critical shortages,

25

reprocessing is being implemented to facilitate their limited reuse.2 The N95 rating suggests that

26

up to 5% of airborne particles may transmit through an N95 FFR. The NIOSH tests certifying

27

this rating, however, poorly simulate the transmission of aerosols in healthcare settings,3 limiting

28

our understanding of the exposure risk for healthcare workers performing aerosol-generating

29

medical procedures and of the implications of reprocessing.

30

We analyzed the penetration (transmission through the filter media) and leakage

31

(transmission around imperfections in facial seal) of aerosols into pristine and reprocessed N95

32

FFRs. We examined three prevalent healthcare models (3M 1860S, 3M 8210 and 3M 9210) and

33

reprocessed them (1, 3, 5 or 10 cycles) using seven methods under consideration for

34

implementation in hospitals: autoclave, 70% ethanol vapor (vEtOH), forced-air dry heat (100

35

ºC), humid heat (75% relative humidity, 75 ºC), hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (HPGP,

36

STERRAD® 100S), hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV, STERIS V-PRO®) and ultraviolet

37

germicidal irradiation (UVGI). Leakage was assessed via fit testing. Penetration was evaluated

38

using a polydisperse challenge aerosol (0.1 to 1 µm; material density, 1.05 g/cm3) and conditions

39

that simulated the sizes, densities and airflow properties of infectious aerosols in healthcare

40

settings (see the Supplementary Appendix for the Experimental design and Methods sections).4

41

For both pristine (Fig. 1A) and reprocessed (Fig. S1 to S7) N95 FFRs, penetration rapidly

42

decreased as aerosol size increased according to a power relationship. Power regression verified

43

this trend, with a cumulative R2 of 0.94 ± 0.041 for all penetration experiments in this study (N =

44

72). For pristine N95 FFRs, the expected aerosol penetration was between 0.09% and 0.19% at

45

0.1 µm, 0.02% and 0.03% at 0.3 µm and at the detection limit, 0.01%, above 0.5 µm (Fig. 1A).

46

When properly fitted, we measured aerosol leakage at the detection limit, 0.49%, for the

47

three N95 models (Fig. 1B). As such, the estimated overall transmission (sum of penetration and

48

leakage) was ≤0.68%, with the most penetrating particle size at 0.1 µm. Improper wear due to a

49

pinched nose clip, a common issue, significantly enhanced leakage (Fig. 1C).

50

Reprocessing methods varied in their effects on aerosol transmission (Fig. 1D). At 0.3 µm,

51

HPV kept overall transmission below 1.5% up to 10 cycles, while force-air dry heat and humid

52

heat did so up to 3 cycles. HPGP and UVGI did for 1 cycle but increased transmission by the

53

third cycle; samples reprocessed twice were not included in this study. These five methods kept

54

leakage below 0.6% for the identified cycles. Autoclave physically deformed the pleated models

55

(3M 1860S and 3M 8210), inducing leakage; the molded model (3M 9210) was unaffected.

56

UVGI induced slight dose-dependent photochemical damage (Fig. S8). HPGP caused leakage

57

around the nose by 5 cycles: reactive oxygen species generated during the plasma phase

58

progressively embrittled and degraded polyurethane nose foams across N95 models (Fig. S9 and

59

S10). For mechanistic insight into how reprocessing increased penetration, we measured the

60

pressure differential, which indicates structural changes, across each FFR. N95 filter media

61

collect aerosols based on their static charge or structure. Pressure differentials stayed consistent

62

(Table S1), implying the seven methods increased penetration mainly by degrading filter charge.

63

Equivalence testing demonstrated that N95 FFRs reprocessed once using forced-air dry heat,

64

HPGP or HPV were statistically equivalent to pristine ones in terms of aerosol transmission (Fig.

65

1E and S11, P < 0.01 or P < 0.001), subverting the conventional expectation that the very act of

66

reprocessing increases transmission. No N95 FFRs showed equivalency up to 3 cycles (Fig. 1F

67

and S12, P > 0.05).

68

Our findings help better understand aerosol exposure for healthcare workers wearing N95

69

FFRs. Since the size of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virions is approximately 0.1 µm,5 infectious

70

aerosols containing them are larger than 0.1 µm. Our results suggest that <0.68% of these virus-

71

containing aerosols transmit into a pristine N95 FFR. Our data indicates HPV, forced-air dry

72

heat, humid heat, HPGP and UVGI maintain <1.5% transmission at 0.3 µm, and in some cases

73

preserve pristine performance, within the identified cycle numbers. The established power

74

relationship demonstrates penetration decreases considerably as aerosol size increases. In

75

comparison, improper wear induces significant leakage, highlighting the importance of

76

compliant wear. These findings suggest pristine and properly reprocessed N95 FFRs effectively

77

protect against infectious aerosols, but that care must be taken during use and reprocessing to

78

mitigate degradation of filter charge, avoid deterioration of straps and nose foams, preserve mask

79

shape especially for molded models and limit noncompliant wear.

Figure 1. Penetration, leakage and overall transmission of aerosols into pristine and

82

reprocessed N95 FFRs. (A) Aerosol penetration was measured using three models of pristine

83

N95 FFRs. A polydisperse challenge aerosol (0.1 to 1.0 µm, material density of 1.05 g/cm3) was

84

introduced at 1.0 scfm while experimental conditions were maintained at 20.9 ± 0.52 °C and 48.5

85

± 3.70% RH. Power regression was performed on discrete measurements. Plots show the size-

86

dependent expectation curves and the 95% confidence intervals of individual samples. The inset

87

values represent the expected penetration at 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 µm. The detection limit was 0.01%

88

across aerosol sizes. (B and C) Aerosol leakage was quantified into three models of pristine N95

89

FFRs worn properly (B) or with a pinched nose clip (C). Graphs show size-independent means

90

and their standard errors. The dashed lines indicate the detection limit, which was 0.49%. (D)

91

The three models of N95 FFRs were reprocessed for 1, 3, 5 or 10 cycles and characterized for

92

penetration and leakage while worn properly. We only implemented autoclave and vEtOH up to

93

3 cycles; and UVGI up to 5 cycles. Plots show the overall aerosol transmission, the sum of the

94

expected penetration and leakage, at 0.3 µm and leakage over cycle numbers. The dashed lines

95

indicate the detection limit for overall transmission, which was 0.50%. (E and F) Pristine N95

96

FFRs were compared with ones reprocessed up to 1 cycle (E) or 3 cycles (F). Plots show the

97

individual data points, means and 95% confidence intervals for overall aerosol transmission at

98

0.3 µm. Data across N95 models were grouped together up to each cycle number. Autoclave and

99

vEtOH were excluded from these plots and reported in the Supplementary Appendix.

Experimental design
We designed this study to better understand how aerosols relevant to nosocomial infections

134

transmit through N95 FFRs. The N95 rating means that the FFR filter is not resistant to oil and

135

that a minimum of 95% of airborne particles are filtered while fitted properly. We chose not to

136

use the NIOSH certification tests (42 CFR Part 84, TEB-APR-STP-0059 protocol) for our

137

study.3,6 This protocol characterizes filtration efficiency by using relatively monodisperse 75-nm

138

NaCl particles (material density, 2.16 g/cm3), using specific humidity conditions

139

(preconditioning at 85% relative humidity and 38 °C for 24 h) and loading particulate matter up

140

to the mass threshold (200 mg) under increased flow rates (85 L/min).6 In healthcare

141

environments, it is not expected for N95 FFRs to uptake particulates up to the loading threshold.7

142

Moreover, as explained below, the particulates and conditions used in this testing protocol are

143

dissimilar to the aerosols and conditions of interest for this study.

144

The airflow and transmission characteristics of aerosols depend on the physicochemical

145

properties of the aerosol and the properties of the surrounding gas. Description of the motion of

146

spherical aerosols can be formalized by the Maxey and Riley differential force balance, the

147

relative Reynolds number (Re), Stokes’ law and a statistical treatment of Brownian motion.8-11

174

Taken together, eqs. (1) to (8) show that airflow and transmission characteristics of aerosols

175

depend on the size, material density, surface charge and morphology of the aerosol as well as the

176

composition, flow and temperature of the surrounding gas.

177

While, at the time of writing,12 Covid-19 is believed to be communicated through the droplet

178

and contact modes of transmission,13,14 aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMPs)

179

discharge aerosols (conventionally, <5 µm), potentially leading to nosocomial infection.15 Other

180

infectious diseases, such as influenza, can induce respiratory infection via the airborne mode of

181

transmission. Both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virions are approximately 0.1 µm in size and can

182

be spherical.16,17 Infectious aerosols and droplet nuclei carrying SARS-CoV-2 and influenza are

183

largely spherical, have a material density of approximately 1 g cm-3, have a ζ-potential modestly

184

below zero and are polydisperse but, by definition, >0.1 µm based on the size of the virions.18-20

185

For this study, we considered the above parameters and healthcare-relevant experimental

186

conditions to investigate how aerosols penetrate through and leak into N95 FFRs. We chose a

187

polydisperse (0.1 to 1.0 µm) challenge aerosol of spherical Latex polystyrene beads (material

188

density, 1.05 g cm-3; ζ-potential < 0, although aerosols were charge neutralized during

189

experimentation for a ζ-potential modestly below zero). Preliminary findings showed that

190

penetration followed a power relationship with aerosol size so that the behavior of aerosols larger

191

than 1.0 µm could be extrapolated using the experimental size range; we did not include aerosols

192

between 1 and 5 µm in this study. For our experimental conditions, we simulated ambient

193

healthcare conditions and its gaseous phase, accounting for the relevant density, dynamic

194

viscosity, breathing rates, ambient temperature, relative humidity (RH), ambient pressure.

Implementation of reprocessing methods for N95 FFRs

198

The seven reprocessing methods assessed in this study include traditional sterilization and

199

decontamination methods in medical settings, emerging ones and processes that have received

200

emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA).21-27 Each

201

reprocessing method, and number of cycles (1, 3, 5 or 10), was evaluated against three models of

202

NIOSH-approved N95 FFRs (3M 1860S, 3M 8210 and 3M 9210, The 3M Company, St. Paul,

203

MN, USA). These models are used widely by healthcare workers (HCWs) and vary in mask

204

design (molded or pleated), strap material (polyisoprene, thermoplastic elastomer and blue

205

polyisoprene for 3M 1860S, 3M 8210 and 3M 9210, respectively) and the presence (3M 1860S)

206

or absence of a colored dye on the exterior surface. All reprocessed N95 FFRs were

207

characterized for leakage or penetration after one day or longer after the last cycle was

208

completed, as described below. Each reprocessing cycle was run using standard parameters or

209

one that have been reported as used for decontamination.21-27

210

For autoclave reprocessing, the N95 FFRs were placed inside of a benchtop autoclave

211

sterilizer (3850E Autoclave, Tuttnauer, Hauppauge, NY, USA), such that no FFR touched

212

another one. For each cycle, they were run under the dry setting (steam time, 30 min) with a 60-

213

min dry time. The N95 FFRs were removed from the autoclave and allowed to sit idly in ambient

214

conditions (30 min) before proceeding.

215

For vEtOH (70%) reprocessing, we prepared 70% EtOH by mixing the appropriate ratio of

216

ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada) with MilliQ water (18.2 MΩ cm, Milli-Q® IQ

217

7000 Ultrapure Lab Water System; Millipore Sigma, Etobicoke, ON, Canada). A vapor, vEtOH

218

(70%), was generated via a thin-layer chromatography atomizer (Chemglass Life Sciences,

219

Vineland, NJ, USA) and a fume hood air supply (operated at ~25 psi). For each cycle, the N95

220

FFRs were covered with vEtOH (70%) and allowed to dry completely under hood ventilation (~1

221

h) before proceeding.

222

For forced-air dry heat (100 °C) reprocessing, the N95 FFRs were placed within a benchtop

223

forced air oven (chamber volume, 3.65 ft3, VWR® Forced Air Oven; VWR International,

224

Mississauga, ON, Canada), such that no FFR touched another one. For each cycle, the N95 FFRs

225

were heated to 100 °C (ramp time, ~2 min) for 30 min. Afterwards, they were removed from the

226

heat and allowed to cool down to and sit idly at room temperature in ambient conditions (30 min)

227

before proceeding.

228

For humid heat (75% RH, 75 °C) reprocessing, the N95 FFRs were enclosed within

229

STERIL-PEEL® sterilization pouches (GS Medical Packaging, Inc., Etobicoke, ON, Canada)

230

and placed in a convection heating system with controlled humidity (HCSS74W12, Climate

231

Select Heated Holding Cabinet with Humidity, BevLes Company, Inc., Erie, PA, USA). A

232

humidity gauge (PT2470 Digital Combometer, Exo Terra, Montreal, QC, Canada) was used to

233

ensure that the RH was maintained. For each cycle, the N95 FFRs were heated at 75 °C with

234

75% RH for 1 h. Afterwards, N95 FFRs were removed from the heat and allowed to cool down

235

in ambient conditions (5 min) before proceeding.

236

For HPGP reprocessing, the N95 FFRs were enclosed within Tyvek® self-seal sterilization

237

pouches (GS Medical Packaging, Inc., Etobicoke, ON, Canada) and placed in a STERRAD®

238

100S Sterilizer (Advanced Sterilization Products, Irvine, CA, USA). The N95 FFRs were run

239

through the STERRAD® 100S Long Cycle (59% H2O2; approximately 72 min per cycle,

240

including venting; 42-50°C; cycle pressure, fluctuated from vacuum to sterilant injection and

244

For HPV reprocessing, the N95 FFRs were enclosed within Vis-U-AllTM Low Temperature

245

Sterilization Pouches (STERIS Corporation, OH, USA) and placed in a STERIS V-PRO® maX

246

Low Temperature Sterilization System (STERIS Corporation, OH, USA). Each cycle was run

247

under the non-lumen cycle settings (59% H2O2, approximately 28 min per cycle, including

248

aeration, 49.3-50.6 °C; cycle pressure, fluctuated from vacuum to sterilant injection settings with

249

251

FFRs were handled after aeration.

252

For UVGI reprocessing, we constructed an aluminum enclosure containing a SaniRay®

253

RRDHO36-4S High-Output Germicidal Ultraviolet Fixture (Atlantic Ultraviolet Corporation,

254

Hauppauge, NY, USA) with four 254-nm UVC lamps (UV 05-1060-R, Atlantic Ultraviolet

255

Corporation, Hauppauge, NY, USA) mounted in parallel. The enclosure measured 106.68 cm x

256

60.96 cm x 60.96 cm and was built with an aluminum door to safely introduce and remove

257

samples while containing radiation during operation. A height-adjustable platform was installed

258

and set to 30.48 cm below the lamps for this application. The lamps were warmed up (2 h) to

259

stabilize the UVC irradiance. A UV512C Digital UVC Light Meter (General Tools &

260

Instruments, Secaucus, NJ, USA) was used inside of the enclosure at a fixed position to account

261

for potential fluctuations of UVC irradiation. The UVC irradiance at different areas on the N95

262

FFRs were mapped using a USB4000 fiber optic spectrometer (Ocean Optics, Dunedin, FL,

263

USA) with a CC-3 Cosine Corrector (Ocean Optics, Dunedin, FL, USA) using 25-scan averages.

264

The results indicated that for the face-side up orientation, the edges of the mask received 57.6%

266

reference UVC meter. For the face-side down orientation, zones with the lowest irradiance and

267

highest irradiance received 79.4% and 137.3% of the measured reference irradiance,

268

respectively. The N95 FFRs were placed within the UVC enclosure and irradiated face-side up

269

such that all areas on the face-side up orientation received a minimum of ~0.5 J/cm2, while being

270

rotated 90° in 30-s intervals to ensure homogeneous dosing. The FFRs were then flipped face-

271

side down and irradiated in the same manner. The process was repeated such that all areas of the

272

N95 FFRs received ~1 J/cm2 of UVC or greater. The least exposed areas of the face-up

273

orientation received a UVC dose of 1.010 ± 0.035 J/cm2 at an irradiance of 2431 ± 179 µW/cm2,

274

while the least exposed areas of the face-down orientation received 1.029 ± 0.039 J/cm2 at 3537

275

± 199 µW/cm2.

Characterization of leakage
We characterized leakage via quantitative fit testing. For each pristine N95 FFRs, fit-verified

279

individuals donned and molded an N95 FFRs before assessing leakage. For each reprocessed

280

N95 FFRs, fit-verified individuals (fit factor for pristine masks, 200+) donned and molded an

281

N95 FFRs, doffed it, had it reprocessing using the specified method and number of cycles, and

282

re-donned and molded it to assess leakage. Fit testing was performed using the CSA Z94.4-11

283

testing standard (PortaCount Respirator Fit Tester 8048, TSI Incorporated, Shoreview, MN,

284

USA), fulfilling OSHA 29CFR 1910.134. Briefly, a sequence of breathing exercises (normal

285

breathing, deep breathing, breathing while turning head side to side, breathing while nodding

286

head up and down, breathing while talking out loud, breathing while bending over and, again,

287

normal breathing) was performed in the proximity of an aerosol generator (Model 8026, TSI

Incorporated; generated aerosols containing NaCl particles, 0.02 µm to >1.0 µm). Since the

289

testing standard and the condensation nuclei counter within the PortaCount instrument

290

exclusively assesses particles between 40 and 70 nm, only particles that leaked through

291

imperfections in facial seal were quantified, rather than those that penetrate through the filter

292

media. These results correspond to leakage due to larger aerosols.28

293

Fit factor (&&) is defined by

(9)

295

where SS( is the individual fit score for the M-th exercise. Since && is the mean geometric ratio

296

between the concentrations of the test aerosol inside and outside of the N95 FFR (Cin/Cout),

297

leakage was calculated as the inverse (V = && 2- ). Within the relevant aerosol size range,

298

leakage is a bulk, size-independent measurement, as leakage occurs through macroscopic

299

imperfection of facial seal. Hence, we took leakage to be a constant value throughout the

300

penetration challenge aerosol range (0.1 to 1.0 µm) when calculating overall transmission. To

301

ensure consistent results (sensitivity, 0.10%), ambient counts were generally maintained above

302

150 throughout each test. The output value of the testing standard saturates at 200+. Since an

303

output && of 200 corresponds to a leakage of 0.5% and the sensitivity was 0.10%, we considered

304

the limit of detection to be 0.49%.

305

For reprocessed N95 FFRs, leakage measurements were ensured to exclusively quantify the

306

effect of reprocessing. When re-donning a reprocessed N95 FFR, there is a risk that leakage

307

occurs due to human-based error. To mitigate this issue, fit-verified individuals re-donned

308

reprocessed N95 FFRs while viewing the live &&. The live && was maximized before testing,

309

meaning that increases in leakage were due to the effects of a reprocessing method and number

310

of cycles.

311

HCWs widely exhibit one or more behaviors of improper wear for N95 FFRs, such as

312

pinching the nose clip while molding the mask.29,30 We simulated this common compliance

313

issue. Fit-verified individuals donned and molded a pristine N95 FFR without viewing the live

314

&&. While doing so, they molded the nose clip outward in, rather than the recommended inward

315

out, thereby pinching the nose clip and creating a relatively sharp bend at the apex of the nose

316

clip. Leakage was then quantified for these masks.

Characterization of penetration and pressure differential
Penetration experiments were performed at SGS-IBR Laboratories (Grass Lakes, MI, USA).

320

These aerosols and experimental conditions simulated those found in healthcare settings and for

321

moderate HCW breathing through N95 FFRs.31,32 To standardize experimentation, penetration

322

measurements were conducted according to particle filtration efficiency measurements for

323

ASTM F2299 and ASTM F2100.33,34 As previously introduced, we characterized penetration

324

using a polydisperse aerosol of negatively charged spherical Latex polystyrene beads. Briefly,

325

we mixed monodisperse aqueous suspensions of Latex polystyrene microspheres for a

326

polydisperse distribution of challenge particles (0.1 µm to 1 µm; material density, 1.05 g cm-3 at

327

20 °C). Filtered and dried air was passed through a nebulizer to produce an aerosol containing

328

the suspended Latex microspheres. The aerosol was passed through a charge neutralizer, leading

329

to a ζ-potential modestly below 0, and mixed and diluted with additional preconditioned air to

330

produce the challenge aerosol to be used in the test. N95 FFRs were tested previously for leakage

331

and contained fit test sampling probes (TSI Incorporated, Shoreview, MN, USA). Leftover

332

sample probes were sealed with hot glue, and control N95 FFRs with sealed probes were

333

indistinguishable from control ones without them based on penetration and pressure differential

334

measurements. N95 FFRs were attached to a filter holder and placed between inflow and outflow

335

tubes. The aerosol was fed (1.0 scfm) through the FFRs, and penetration was obtained using two

336

particle counters (Lasair® III 110 Airborne Particle Counter, Particle Measuring Systems®, a

337

Spectris company Boulder, CO, USA) connected to the feed stream and filtrate. Penetration was

338

measured within six size channels (0.1 to 0.15 µm, 0.15 to 0.20 µm, 0.20 to 0.25 µm, 0.25 to

339

0.30 µm, 0.3 to 0.5 µm and 0.5 to 1.0 µm). For power regression (described in the section

340

below), we took the measured penetration within each channel to be the middle of its size

341

channel (0.125 µm, 0.175 µm, 0.225 µm, 0.275 µm, 0.4 µm and 0.75 µm). This was justified

342

based on high coefficients of determination (R2) throughout the samples in this study and

343

because expectation values for penetration were conservative estimates, with expected

344

penetration typically being slightly greater than the experimental values. Pressure differential

345

(DHII-007, Dwyer Instruments International, Michigan City, IN, USA), air flow (M-50SLPM-

346

D/5M, Alicat Scientific, Tucson, AZ, USA), temperature and humidity (HMT330 Humidity and

347

Temperature Meter, Vaisala, Helsinki, Finland) and barometric pressure (PTU200 Transmitter,

348

Vaisala, Helsinki, Finland) were also characterized in the experimental apparatus. Pressure

349

differential was measured for greater mechanistic insight into how reprocessing affected

350

penetration.26 Throughout the penetration experiments, the temperature, relative humidity and

351

barometric pressure were measured to be 20.9 ± 0.52 °C, 48.5 ± 3.70 % and 723.6 ± 2.72 mmHg,

352

respectively. Note that higher RH values (e.g., 80%, like the preconditioning stage for the

353

NIOSH test) is not expected to affect penetration measurements.35

Expectation curves and confidence bands were generated using these approximations at a

sufficient number of intervals (n = 50) throughout the axes spans and by linearly connecting

them. We applied power regression to the discrete penetration data from individual samples. A

368

strong cumulative coefficient of determination (R2, 0.94 ± 0.041, mean ± S.E.M.) across all

369

samples in included in this study suggested that this power law was a good model for the

relationship between penetration and aerosol size.

371

We performed equivalence testing to compare the likeness of the aerosol transmission

characteristics of pristine N95 FFRs and reprocessed ones. We applied the conventional two-

374

including across models, that were reprocessed using a certain method and number of cycles and

376

field, we used the U.S. FDA’s standard bounds for bioequivalence (upper equivalence bound =

377

1.25, lower equivalence bound = 0.80, based on the geometric mean ratio).36 N95 FFRs

Limitations of this study

384

Composition of matter for N95 FFRs

385

The three models of N95 FFRs used in this study span a range of mask designs and

386

constituent materials and are widely used by HCWs. Nevertheless, there are other models and

387

brands used by HCWs which may differ in the composition of matter. Of note, the three 3M

388

models studied use an electret for the filter media that can restore static charge over time.37 Since

389

we found that reprocessing mainly increased aerosol penetration by degrading filter charge, our

390

results may underestimate the impact of certain reprocessing methods on aerosol penetration for

391

N95 brands and models without electret properties. The N95 FFRs used in this study included

392

those from several batches manufactured years apart. Differences arising from batch

393

manufacturing may be encapsulated in this study. Batch manufacturing may also skew the

394

transmission characteristics of an N95 FFR.

395
396

Relevance to reprocessing N95 FFRs in healthcare settings

397

This study focuses on the direct assessment of aerosol transmission for pristine, improperly

398

worn pristine and reprocessed, but properly worn, N95 FFRs. Our results help to understand the

399

exposure risk for HCWs performing AGMPs or near other sources of infectious aerosols. They

400

also help to understand the implications of reprocessing. We did not, however, investigate the

401

effects of HCW wear, especially when extended-use guidelines are implemented. In addition, the

402

field does not currently understand the extensiveness and impact of extended-use guidelines on

403

noncompliance in wear. These, and additional contributions, may adversely affect the aerosol

404

transmission characteristics of N95 FFRs in healthcare settings. For example, we showed that at

405

one cycle of forced-air dry heat, HPGP or HPV reprocessed N95 FFRs were statistically

406

equivalent to pristine ones in terms of aerosol transmission. This result does not account for the

407

effects of extended wear, which may affect performance. In addition, for proper experimental

408

design, we evaluated leakage on fit-verified individuals who had an optimal fit factor (200+).

409

Since quantitative fit testing considers a fit factor of 100 to be a pass, some institutions may

410

allow HCWs to wear N95 FFRs that do not fit optimally, increasing leakage by a predictable

411

amount. From one perspective, the results in this study can be taken as approximate better-case

412

scenarios (i.e., upper bounds), especially for greater reprocessing cycle numbers. For proper

413

clinical implementation of reprocessing for N95 FFRs, the effects of the aforementioned

414

contributions on filtration performance should be studied.

that of improperly worn N95 FFRs (pinched nose clip) or those that have been reprocessed for 1

469

cycle via the seven methods (geometric mean ratio, upper equivalence bound = 1.25, lower

470

equivalence bound = 0.80) with α = 0.05 (A) or α = 0.01 or α = 0.001 (B). The dots and I bars

471

represent the geometric mean ratios and their 100(1 – 2α)% confidence intervals, respectively.

472

The red dashed lines represent the upper and lower equivalence bounds. The P-value inequalities

473

are reported below each plot.
