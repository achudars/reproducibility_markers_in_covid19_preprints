Covid-19 response with four European countries

Abstract
Background
In responding to covid-19, governments have tried to balance protecting health while minimising
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) losses. We compare health-related net benefit (HRNB) and GDP
losses associated with government responses of the UK, Ireland, Germany, Spain, and Sweden from
UK healthcare payer perspective.
Methods
We compared observed cases, hospitalisations, and deaths under “mitigation” to modelled events
under “no mitigation” to 20th July 2020. We thus calculated healthcare costs, quality adjusted life
years (QALYs), and HRNB at £20,000/QALY saved by each country. On per population (i.e. per capita)
basis, we compared HRNB with forecast reductions in 2020 GDP growth (overall or compared to
Sweden as minimal mitigation country) and qualitatively and quantitatively described government
responses.
Results
The UK saved 3.17 (0.32-3.65) million QALYs, £33 (8-38) billion healthcare costs, and £1416 (2201637) HRNB per capita at £20,000/QALY. Per capita, this is comparable to £1,455 GDP loss using
Sweden as comparator and offsets 46.1 (7.1-53.2)% of total £3075 GDP loss.
Germany, Spain, and Sweden had greater HRNB per capita. These also offset a greater percentage of
total GDP losses per capita. Ireland fared worst on both measures. Countries with more mask
wearing, testing, and population susceptibility had better outcomes. Highest stringency responses
did not appear to have best outcomes.
Conclusions
Our exploratory analysis indicates the benefit of government covid-19 responses may outweigh their
economic costs. The extent that HRNB offset economic losses appears to relate to population
characteristics, testing levels, and mask wearing, rather than response stringency.

Research in Context
Evidence before this study
Our research question was how the health-related net benefits and economic impacts of the UK
response to the covid-19 epidemic first wave compared to other European countries. We searched
PubMed, MedRxiv, and Arxiv for terms related to cost-effectivness, covid-19, and the UK.
Two studies compared predicted lives saved to predicted gross domestic product (GDP) losses. One
found that lives saved by a lockdown would outweigh GDP losses, while another found a lockdown
to cost £10million per life saved. A later modelling study used quality adjusted life-years (QALYs),
going beyond lives saved, and found cost per QALY was below £50,000· A fourth, comparing
observed to modelled deaths and hospitalisations, found the cost per QALY was at least £220,000,
and thus the UK response was not cost-effective. None of these were international comparisons.
One international study found good health and economic outcomes to be correlated. Another found
global trade reductions and voluntary behavioural changes to have greater impact on economic
growth than government measures. Neither considered cost-effectiveness. However, they suggest
comparison to GDP loss is naïve as this is total loss and not that due to government restrictions.

Added value of this study
We compare the UK to Ireland, Germany, Spain, and Sweden on health-related net benefits and
economic impacts of government response from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. We
describe countries’ response measures. We compared model predictions of outcomes under “no
mitigation” to observed outcomes under “mitigation” up to July 20th 2020. We estimated healthcare
costs, QALYs, and health-related net benefit (HRNB) saved. We compared HRBN to GDP losses using
Sweden as a “minimal mitigation” comparator and calculated the % of total GDP loss they offset.
We found the UK saved 3·17 (0·32-3·65) million QALYs, £33 (£8-38) billion in healthcare costs, and
£1416 (220-1637) HRNB per capita at the NHS threshold of £20,000/QALY. This is comparable to the
£1,455 GDP loss per capita using Sweden as comparator and offsets 46·1% (7·1-53·2) of the total
estimated £3075 GDP loss per capita. We found that Germany, Spain, and probably Sweden had
greater HRNB per capita and offset greater percentages of GDP loss per capita. Ireland fared worst
on both measures. We found countries with more mask wearing, testing, and population
susceptibility (e.g. older and more interpersonal contact) had better outcomes. Highest stringency
responses did not appear to have best outcomes.

Implications of all the available evidence
We add to growing evidence that the total economic impact of covid-19 exceeds the HRNB of the
UK’s response. However, using Sweden as comparator and comparing across countries, we argue
that GDP loss is not purely due to government restrictions and that due to restrictions may be
outweighed by HRNB. We evaluated the extent to which countries have offset GDP losses, and these
appear to be higher in countries with more at-risk populations, higher testing, and higher mask
wearing, rather than those with most stringent restrictions.

Introduction
Covid-19 has caused severe health and economic damage since its emergence in Wuhan, China at
the end of 2019. As of 13th November 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has reported
over 50 million confirmed cases and 1.29 million deaths globally.1 In the UK there have been over a
million cases and over 60,000 deaths. The economic damage has been similarly dramatic with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) reducing its forecast Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth for
2020 in the UK from 1.4% in January to -9.8% in October.2,3 Similar reductions have been observed
across Europe and the world. Health system responses (e.g. test and trace), government
recommended or mandated social distancing measures, and financial assistance have so far been
the primary response.4
The economic case for stringent social distancing measures has been questioned due to their impact
on the economy and livelihoods.5,6 A cost-benefit analysis of government responses to covid-19
requires an infectious disease model to project the counterfactual of what would have happened in
the absence of government intervention. The first wave of covid-19 in Europe was largely complete
by July 2020; complete data on observed outcomes are therefore available for comparison with
modelled outcomes, and it is thus possible to compare the costs and benefits of Government
responses to this first wave.1 The costs of social distancing measures are largely borne by society and
the economy. A potential approach is to simply compare health-related net benefits (health gains
minus healthcare costs) to losses in GDP. However, this would underestimate the value of
government intervention on social distancing as some GDP losses are due to covid-19 ill-health,
reductions in global trade, and voluntary changes in behaviour, rather than mandatory social
distancing measures. Some studies have found that the much of the reduction is due to global and
voluntary changes.7,8
Zala 2020 was an early UK modelling study aiming to assist policy makers but not making use of
observed data. They found that even strategies causing a 10% reduction in national income are costeffective at £50,000 per QALY.9 Lifetables and age-specific QALY norms were used to estimate that
8.8 QALYs were lost for each covid-19 death, similar to estimates by Briggs 2020.10 Miles 2020
compared predictions of outcomes under no mitigation to observed outcomes up to June 2020,
using an informal estimate of 5 QALYs lost per death.6 They compared the reductions in actual GDP
growth forecasts to costs and QALYs saved by government response. They found that continuing the
lockdown was only cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay per QALY between £220,000 and £3.7
million.
Building on this earlier work, we aim to quantify the health-related net benefit of Government
interventions and compare them to the loss in GDP associated with social distancing measures in
five western European countries over the first wave of covid-19. We use a new model of cost and
QALYs of covid-19 cases, hospitalisations, and deaths, with an estimate of QALYs lost per death. We
compare observed outcomes to new forecasts under no mitigation using an adaptation of a
published open-source covid-19 model.11 Multiple forecasts are considered to explore uncertainty.
Health-related net benefits are compared per capita with published reductions in 2020 GDP growth
forecasts, both in total and using Sweden as a minimal mitigation comparator. Differences are
presented alongside a description of social distancing and other measures, allowing us to illustrate
characteristics of a successful response.

Methods
The comparisons cover the period 1st January to 20th July 2020, corresponding to the first wave of
covid-19.1 The “mitigation” strategy is based on observed disease outcomes while “no mitigation” is
based on modelled projections.

Comparator countries and description of response
Comparator countries were selected as they were high income Western European healthcare
systems with a range of responses and outcomes to covid-19. Sweden had a less stringent response
than the UK, Germany had lower case and death rates, Ireland took earlier and more stringent
action, and Spain had similar case and death rates.1,12 We reviewed each country’s response with
reference to Wikipedia, news reports, and government websites.13 Government responses were
categorised under international travel, mass gatherings, pubs/restaurants, education, stay-at-home
measures, financial assistance, mask requirements, and testing. Timings were relative to the first
confirmed covid-19 case and death in each country. As numbers of cases and tests are likely
correlated, we report tests per covid-19 death. For additional comparison we used the maximum
and average, up to 20th July, University of Oxford Stringency Index for each country.12 This composite
measure is based on nine response indicators, including school closures, workplace closures, and
travel bans.

Observed outcomes under “mitigation”
Government and news websites from each of the countries were searched for data on the numbers
of covid-19 cases, hospitalisation, and deaths that took place from 1st January to 20th July 2020.
Covid-19 related deaths rather than excess deaths were used as these were available for all
countries of interest.

Modelling outcomes under “no mitigation”
We conducted a search for existing models on PUBMED, the Arxiv and medRxiv preprint servers. We
selected the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Centre for the Mathematical
Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID) covid-19 model (version 1) for projections in all countries
of interest. This is an open-source age-structured deterministic mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2
transmission.11,14,15 This model was chosen because it included projections for all countries of
interest, allowed common structural assumptions between countries, and enabled tailoring of virus
introduction dates and reproduction numbers (𝑅0 ). It accounts for differences in susceptibility and
symptomatic rate by age, with children less susceptible to infection and more likely to be
asymptomatic than adults.
We used results of meta-analysis studies and preprints published before Feb 26, 2020 to estimate
the “no mitigation” 𝑅0 at 2.7 (95% credible interval 1.6-3.9).14 Our scenario A uses 2.7 while
scenarios B and C assume 𝑅0 to be 1.6 and 3.9, respectively. This 𝑅0 point estimate was sufficiently
early to avoid the influence of public health interventions. Other modelling studies have used similar
estimates of 2.6 (uncertainty range: 1.5-3.5) and 3.8 and there is limited evidence of variation
between western European countries. 16-18 Default values were used for other parameters. The
model forecasts for each 𝑅0 scenario in each country were then downloaded including cumulative
cases, ICU bed days, non-ICU bed days, and deaths from virus introduction to 20th July 2020. Bed
days were converted to numbers of admissions using the duration of non-ICU and ICU stays assumed
by CMMID. These values and further modelling details are in the Appendix.

Calculating health-related net benefit of mitigation
Our calculations include QALYs lost from covid-19 cases, hospitalisations, and deaths. We include
only direct health impacts, and not indirect impacts such as mental health effects of bereavement or
social distancing. We used influenza quality of life decrements for hospitalised or non-hospitalised
cases who survive as estimates are not yet available for covid-19 (values in appendix). We estimate
QALYs lost per covid-19 death using country specific distributions of age at death, life expectancy,
and age-specific quality of life norms (details in Appendix).10 Our baseline estimate of QALYs lost
assumes an SMR of 1.1 (see Appendix) but there is uncertainty about the prevalence of
comorbidities in those dying from covid-19 compared to the general population. 19 We therefore
consider a sensitivity analysis with a high SMR of 2.0.

Health-related costs of treatment
We estimated hospitalisation costs in 2020 UK £ pounds sterling from a UK NHS perspective. We
assumed no healthcare cost for community covid-19 cases as prescription medications typically have
low cost and over the counter medications are not funded by the NHS. Using the figures for hospital
stay costs, percentage requiring high dependency or ICU, average days ICU, and cost per day of ICU
gives an average cost of £4847 per hospitalized patient (details in Appendix). We did not include
costs for testing or tracing as the level under “no mitigation” is unknown and under “mitigation” was
not reported by all countries.

Calculating direct health-related net benefit of mitigation
The total QALYs lost and healthcare costs were estimated for the observed “mitigation” and
modelled “no mitigation” strategies. Incremental QALYs gained and healthcare savings from
mitigation were calculated. A monetary incremental health-related net benefit was calculated by
multiplying incremental QALYs by the conventional UK willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000/QALY
and subtracting incremental costs.20 These are presented per capita using 2020 population
estimates.21

Economic impact
We used the October 2020 International Monetary Fund (IMF) World Economic Outlook projections
for GDP growth in 2020 to give estimates of growth with the covid-19 pandemic and compared
these to the corresponding January 2020 pre-pandemic projections.3,22 January IMF estimates for
Sweden and Ireland were not available so instead Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) 2020 projections from 21st November 2019 were used.23 We calculated £
pound sterling value of GDP changes using IMF estimates of total GDP value in October 2019 and
OECD 2019 purchasing power parities. 2,24 Final results are reported per capita using 2020 population
estimates.21
Only part of the observed GDP loss is a result of government mandated social distancing measures,
with the rest a consequence of global trade changes, voluntary behaviour changes, and productivity
loss due to ill health. We therefore present two scenarios. The first assumes that under no
mitigation the 2020 GDP reduction would have been the same as that observed in Sweden. Sweden
might be considered to represent the “minimal mitigation” policy that is politically acceptable in a
western European democracy during a global pandemic, rather than “no mitigation”. In the second
we estimate the percentage of observed GDP loss that was offset by net QALYs gained and
healthcare savings.

Results
Description of country responses to covid-19
Apart from Sweden, response measures and timings were similar across countries (full details in
Appendix). Ireland banned gatherings 15-28 days earlier than other countries. All countries except
Sweden ordered pubs and restaurants to shut but Ireland did so up to 40 days earlier. Spain,
Germany and the UK closed schools at a similar timepoint, roughly 30 days after Ireland. Sweden
recommended secondary schools and universities to move to distance learning but kept nurseries
and schools open. The UK introduced stay-at-home orders almost 30 days later than Ireland and 12
days after Spain. Sweden had no stay-at-home order. All countries introduced wage support at
similar timepoints. Requirements for mask wearing were eventually introduced for all countries
except Sweden, but Spain and Germany moved much earlier than the UK and Ireland. Most
countries did not introduce comprehensive tracing until the very end of the first wave. Testing levels
per death were much higher in Germany, with 812.8 compared to 324.6 for Ireland with the second
highest level. According to the stringency Index, the UK had lower maximum level restrictions than
Ireland and Spain but higher than Germany and Sweden. Ireland had the highest maximum level of
restrictions. Average restriction index was very similar between countries other than Sweden.
Sweden had the least stringent measures (maximum 64.81 vs next lowest 76.85 and average 38.79
vs next lowest 45.41).

Comparison of responses to covid-19 on cases, hospitalisations, and deaths
Differences in prevented covid-19 cases, hospitalisations, and deaths under “mitigation” are
illustrated in Figure 1, with full details in the Appendix.
Observed case numbers are affected by variance in levels of testing across countries limiting
comparability. Hospitalisations and deaths per capita were highest in Sweden, Spain, and the UK.
Ireland and Germany had much lower hospitalisations and deaths.
Under base case scenario A (𝑅0 = 2.7), Spain and Germany prevented more hospitalisations and
deaths per capita than the UK, while Sweden was similar to the UK. Ireland prevented fewer
hospitalisations and deaths than all countries, likely driven by a younger population. Patterns are
similar under scenario C (𝑅0 = 3.9) but reverse for Germany and Ireland under A (𝑅0 = 1.6); this
nonintuitive reversal is due to a nonlinear relationship between 𝑅0 and outcomes.

Comparison of health-related costs, benefits, and net benefits
The incremental health-related benefits (QALYs), costs, and per capita incremental net benefits are
presented in Table 1. In scenario A (𝑅0 = 2.7), health-related net benefits per capita are highest for
Germany, followed by Spain, UK, and Sweden. Ireland had almost 30% lower net benefit than
Sweden. These findings are driven by prevented hospitalisations and deaths (Figure 1).
Under scenario B (𝑅0 = 1.6), Sweden and Ireland have the greatest health-related benefit while the
UK and Germany have the lowest, again driven by nonlinear modelling relationship between 𝑅0 and
outcomes (Figure 1). Under scenario C (𝑅0 = 3.9), almost the same pattern as the base case is
found. Patterns are the same under SMR=2.0, but health-related net benefits are marginally lower

(see Appendix). Deaths account for 60-70% of incremental health-related net benefits, with the
remainder due to hospitalisations (Appendix). Over 95% of the benefit of prevented hospitalisations
is due to costs, rather than QALYs.
Across all scenarios, with 𝑅0 = 2.7 as base case, the UK response is estimated to have saved 3.17
million (ranging from 0.32 to 3.65 million) QALYs, £33 billion (£8-38 billion) in healthcare costs, and
gained £1416 (220-1637)per capita health-related net benefit at £20,000/QALY.

Comparison of economic impact of responses to covid-19
Estimates of the economic impact of government responses are presented in Table 2. Spain and the
UK had the worst GDP loss, Germany and Ireland had much smaller reductions in GDP. Despite high
hospitalisation and deaths, Sweden had the lowest reduction in GDP, possibly explained by lower
severity restrictions.
In scenario A, observed GDP loss exceeded health-related net benefits in all countries (Table 1 and
Table 2). The extent to which GDP losses were ‘offset’ by net health benefits ranged widely from a
low of 30% in Ireland to 71% in Germany at the £20,000/QALY threshold (Table 2). These findings
were very sensitive to assumptions about 𝑅0 . For example, in the UK the extent to which GDP loss is
offset was 46% in scenario A but ranged from 7% to 53% (Table 2). If, however, the 5.9% GDP loss
observed in Sweden is considered the minimal level for European economies, given the effects of
global trade and voluntary behavioural changes, then under scenario A the net health benefits in
Germany and Ireland exceed the GDP loss whereas they fall short but are comparable in the UK and
Spain. The analysis with SMR=2.0 (Appendix) reduces net benefits per capita but does not change
our overall findings.
Figure 2 illustrates that in countries (Ireland, Spain, and the UK) with higher social distancing
stringency, net health benefit did not offset a greater proportion of GDP loss. It illustrates that in
Germany, with highest testing per death, net health benefits offset the greatest % GDP loss. It
illustrates that in Ireland, with lowest predicted “no mitigation” death rate, net health benefits of
mitigation offset the lowest % GDP loss. It also suggests that countries with lower median age (e.g.
Ireland) had lower offsets than those with higher age (e.g. Germany). None of these patterns are
consistent and there is insufficient data for statistical testing.

Discussion
We have provided an exploratory comparison of health-related benefits and costs saved by
government measures across European countries. Mitigation saved lives and reduced healthcare
treatment costs substantially, with the health-related net benefit in the UK being £1416 (220-1637)
per capita. In all countries, projected GDP loss is higher than health-related net benefits but this
ignores that GDP would have reduced in the absence of government mandated social distancing
measures. In the UK, 46.1 (7.1-53.2)% of GDP loss was offset by health-related net benefit, but
higher offset percentages were estimated in Germany (71.1%), Spain (51.0%), and Sweden (66.1%).
Countries with tighter social distancing restrictions do not appear to perform better on this measure.
Instead, the distinguishing features of Germany (best performing country) are higher testing, earlier
mask wearing, and higher median age. Germany having the highest % GDP offset may also be
explained by having lowest absolute death and hospitalisation rates.7 The defining feature of Ireland
(worst performing country) is low likelihood of covid-19 hospitalisation and death, possibly
explained by lowest median age (38 years).25 High % offset countries Germany and Spain may simply

have had older populations with more to benefit (Figure 2). Sweden had lower levels of testing, no
requirement for mask wearing, and mostly voluntary but had similar health-related benefits to the
UK; median age (41 years) is similar to the UK (40 years) again suggesting population susceptibility is
a key determinant of success.
There are significant limitations to our analysis. There is limited understanding of plausible
parameter ranges (e.g. 𝑅0 ) and limitations of using an existing model so we could not conduct
probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Costs of hospitalisation were assumed to be independent of the
number of hospitalisations; however, once capacity is breached, additional facilities would need to
be constructed at substantial cost. We did not model testing or tracing costs. The UK has allocated
£22 billion, or £338 per capita, on testing and tracing over 2020-21 so this could become important
for future evaluations.26 We did not model indirect health impacts, such as the impact of either
social distancing or a more severe pandemic on mental health or delivery of healthcare. There are
limitations in the extent to which any single measure of stringency can capture complex Government
policies. For example, Finland had a maximum of 67.6 and average of 36.6 compare to 64.8 and 38.8
in Sweden, respectively, despite introducing a strict lockdown.12 The CMMID model represents a
worst case scenario for “no mitigation” as it does not include voluntary changes in behaviour.
Finally, our restriction to the first wave of the pandemic means we may be comparing cases,
hospitalisations, or deaths postponed, rather than prevented, and we take no account for possible
herd immunity.
Estimating only the impact of government social distancing measures on GDP is difficult. Baker 2020
estimated that at least half of economic impact is due to global uncertainty, while Chen-2020 found
that outbreaks and voluntary mobility reductions have a much greater impact.8,27 Sweden represents
“minimal mitigation” rather than “no mitigation”. Furthermore, Sweden’s neighbouring countries
introduced greater restrictions and also achieved lower forecast reductions in GDP (e.g. Norway with
maximum stringency index 79.6 and forecast -4.0% growth, Denmark with maximum index 72.2 and
-4.5% growth).12,22 It is clear that there is no simple trade-off between economic pain and health
gains. Finally, comparisons for Ireland may be skewed as its GDP per capita is subject to
disproportionate globalisation effects.28
A challenge to our % GDP loss offset is that the £20,000/QALY threshold relates to NHS expenditure,
not society. Societal thresholds may range from £10,000/QALY to £70,000/QALY.9 The NHS uses a
threshold of £50,000/QALY for patients at end-of-life, possibly relevant to patients experiencing
severe covid-19.20 Furthermore, the UK uses higher thresholds when there is perceived public
pressure, as in the case of the Cancer Drugs Fund with an estimated threshold of £220,000/QALY.29
The UK’s benefits would outweigh the total GDP loss at above £70,000/QALY (Appendix).
There are possible lessons from our analysis for the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. One is to consider
the cost and QALYs associated with hospitalisations and deaths, rather than only total numbers,
when making decisions. Successful responses appear to be linked to higher levels of testing or mask
wearing, rather than strictness of response. The experience of Ireland suggests that consideration
should then be given to the maximum potential benefit, which depends on demographics and
interpersonal contacts. This final consideration could be applied regionally rather than nationally, to
better target approaches to future outbreaks.

Conclusion
Our exploratory analysis estimates that the UK saved 3.17 million (0.32 to 3.65 million) QALYs, £33
billion (£8-38 billion) in healthcare costs, and £1416 (220-1637) health-related net benefit at
£20,000/QALY per capita. This is comparable to £1,455 GDP loss per capita using Sweden as

“minimal mitigation”, while it is 46.1 (7.1-53.2)% of the total £3075 GDP loss per capita. Germany,
Spain, and, in most scenarios, Sweden had greater health-related net benefits per capita and less
GDP loss per capita. Ireland fared worst on both measures.
At face value, the total economic impact of covid-19 exceeded the health-related net benefits.
However, it is not realistic to attribute the full economic impact solely to government responses or
to argue that any European country could have avoided their GDP loss or applied “no mitigation”.
We have attempted to evaluate the extent to which economic costs have been offset by net health
benefits. Countries with susceptible populations, higher testing, and higher mask wearing, rather
than those with the most stringent restrictions appear to have done better on this measure.

We estimate the UK government response to covid-19 up to 20th July saved 3.17 (0.32-3.65)
million quality adjusted life years (QALYs), £33 (8-38) billion healthcare costs, and £1416
(220-1637) health-related net benefit (HRNB) per capita at £20,000/QALY.
Per capita, this HRNB is comparable to a £1,455 gross domestic product (GDP) loss using
Sweden as comparator and offsets 46.1 (7.1-53.2)% of total £3075 GDP loss.
Germany, Spain, and Sweden had greater HRNB per capita and offset a greater percentage
of total GDP losses per capita than the UK, while Ireland fared worse on both measures.
Countries with susceptible populations, higher testing, and higher mask wearing, rather than
those with the most stringent restrictions, appear to have had greatest HRNB and offset the
greatest percentage of total GDP losses.

Appendix A. Modelling details
A.1. Search details
We used the preprint server Arxiv application programming interface (API) to search for hits with the
terms "COVID", "CoV", or "coronavirus" in their titles or abstracts. We then filtered these 1432 hits
(19-June-2020) by those containing "model" and either "United Kingdom", "Great Britain", or
"England" in their abstracts. This gave 5 for abstract/full-text screening. We applied the same search
strategy to medical preprint server medRxiv, which gave 5387 hits (18-June-2020), and 61 for
title/abstract screening, of which only 9 were relevant for full-text screening. We also conducted a
PUBMED search for titles or abstracts containing terms related to covid-19 ("coronavirus", "SARSCoV-2", "covid-19"), the UK ("United Kingdom", "England","UK", "Great Britain"), and the string
"model". This identified 64 hits, of which 7 were relevant for full-text screening. We supplemented
these targeted literature searches with reviews of websites for established modelling groups in the
UK, namely the Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis

Imperial College London, the Nuffield Department of Health at University of Oxford, and the Centre
for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID) at the London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine. We also searched the Society for Medical Decision Making (SMDM) database
of available models (as of 18-June-2020); this included 14 potentially relevant models but all were
non-UK except those already identified in the medRxiv searches. We used the same search strategy
to identify models of transmission in each of the countries of interest.

A.2. Further details on use of CMMID model for projections under “no mitigation”
In all modelling scenarios, we calibrated the virus introduction date such that the modelled first
death date (assumed to be the first date when total modelled deaths were greater than 0.5, as the
model estimates fractional deaths) matched to observed data on first death in each country (details
in appendix). We also kept the default contact matrices for home, work, school, and ‘other’ settings;
UK matrices were based on a 2008 study which used questionnaires and contact diaries to measure
contact patterns in the UK and 7 other European countries (POLYMOD), while non-UK matrices were
based on 2013 and 2017 studies which extrapolated from the results of the POLYMOD study.1,2
Other than our changes to the 𝑅0 value, we used the default parameter values. These included risk
of death and hospitalization not modified from baseline age-dependent parameters, and 10 initial
infections on virus introduction date) with the baseline (no mitigation) scenario being used for our
analysis.

A.3. Further modelling methods – estimating QALYs lost per death
At the time of submission, the paper of Briggs was not fully published.3 For completeness, we
therefore reproduce the key steps used from Briggs’ analysis to estimate QALYs lost per death.
Assuming an initial cohort of 100,000 births, the number surviving to age 𝑥 years is given by
𝑥

𝑙(𝑥) = 100,000 × ∏ 𝑒 −𝑑(𝑎)𝑆𝑀𝑅
𝑎=1

Where 𝑑(𝑥) = −𝑙𝑛{1 − 𝑞(𝑥)} is the hazard rate of death corresponding to the probability of death
𝑞(𝑥) for period 𝑥 to 𝑥 + 1, and 𝑆𝑀𝑅 is a standardized mortality ratio for our cohort (i.e. people
dying of covid-19). The 𝑆𝑀𝑅 for patients dying from covid-19 is unknown. Public Health England
report that the percentage of covid-19 deaths with comorbidities were similar to deaths in the
general population. 4 The greatest disparities were in diabetes (6.5% difference: 14.6% vs 21.1%) and
hypertensive diseases (4.1% difference: 14.5% vs 19.6%) .4 We combine these two to give ~10% of
patients with comorbidities and take a high bound of 2.0 for the conditions’ standardised mortality
ratios (SMR), giving a population average SMR of 1.1. We also consider an extreme sensitivity with
SMR of 2.0.
We average the 𝑙(𝑥) over males and females assuming simplistically that the proportion of females
is 0.5. The number of person-years lived between ages 𝑥 and 𝑥 + 1 for 𝑥 ≥ 1 is
𝐿(𝑥) =

𝑙(𝑥) + 𝑙(𝑥 + 1)
2

This is the duration of the interval (1 year in this case) times the average number alive during the
interval. The life expectancy of people surviving to age x is then the expected number of life years of
cohort aged 𝑥 divided by number surviving to age 𝑥 (i.e. average number of years of life)

𝐿𝐸(𝑥) =

∑𝑢=𝑥 𝐿(𝑢)
.
𝑙(𝑥)

The  is some upper limit on life expectancy, which we take to be 100 years. Life years are then
weighted by their age and country specific QALY norms 𝑄(𝑢) for age 𝑢 to give quality adjusted life
expectancy (QALE).
𝑄𝐴𝐿𝐸(𝑥) =

∑𝑢=𝑥 𝐿(𝑢)𝑄(𝑢).
𝑙(𝑥)

The final step is to discount at rate 𝑟 giving the discounted QALYs lost per death at age 𝑥
𝑑𝑄𝐴𝐿𝑌(𝑥) =

∑𝑢=𝑥 𝐿(𝑢)𝑄(𝑢)(1 + 𝑟)−(𝑢−𝑥)
𝑙(𝑥)

This is calculated for each country using the age at death distribution presented in in Table A4. We
take the mid-point 𝑥 for each interval, calculated the corresponding 𝑑𝑄𝐴𝐿𝑌(𝑥), multiply by the
proportion of deaths in that interval, and sum the products.

The age at death distributions are provided in Table A4. Data were not available for Ireland so this
was assumed to be the same as in the UK. This is supported by Omori 2020 who compared age at
death distributions across Spain, Italy, and Japan.24 They found that although total numbers of dead
varied between countries, the age distribution at death was similar.

The lifetables used in the analysis are presented in Table A5. These represent the probability of dying
between the age of the lower and upper limits of each interval. Eurostat was used for Spain and
Sweden but this reports only as high as age 84.14 After this, the UK ONS figures were used. German
data from Destatis were only available to age 99 but no data were employed beyond this. 15

Appendix C. Costing details
The cost of hospitalisation was calculated using ICU and non-ICU costs, the length of stay for a
hospitalisation, and the proportion hospital admissions requiring ICU. We used the National
schedule of NHS costs to calculate a hospital stay cost of £2161 as a weighted average of
"Unspecified Acute Lower Respiratory Infection with Interventions".21 We also used this source to
calculate an ICU daily cost of £1504 as a weighted average of "Non-specific, general adult critical
care patients predominate"). A study of 20,133 patients hospitalised by covid-19 in the UK reported
that 17% of hospitalised patients required admission to high dependency or ICU.20 The Intensive
Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) report on covid-19 in critical care published on 24
July 2020 gives median critical care length of stay in patients who died in critical care (9 days, IQR 516, in 4078 patients), were discharged from critical care but died in hospital (4 days, IQR 2-11, in 289
patients, or were discharged from hospital (12 days, IQR 5-27, in 5344 patients).22 Using a sample
size weighted average, we get a median length of stay in critical care of 10.50 days.

Appendix C. Further results

Table A8 Observed and simulated total and per capita cases, hospitalisations, and deaths due to covid-19 to 20th July 2020. Also reported are estimated QALYs lost per death for SMR=1.1.
Absolute values are presented for the observed “mitigation” scenarios and incremental results for modelled “no mitigation” scenarios. These differences represent cases, hospitalisations, and
deaths prevented by government intervention.
