Abstract
The analysis of systematically collected data for COVID-19 infectivity and death rates has
revealed in many countries around the world a typical oscillatory pattern with a 7-days
(circaseptan) period. Additionally, in some countries the 3.5-days (hemicircaseptan) and 14-days
periodicities have been also observed. Interestingly, the 7-days infectivity and death rates
oscillations are almost in phase, showing local maxima on Thursdays/Fridays and local minima on
Sundays/Mondays. These observations are in stark contrast with a known pattern, correlating the
death rate with the reduced medical staff in hospitals on the weekends. One possible hypothesis
addressing these observations is that they reflect a gradually increasing stress with the progressing
week, which can trigger the maximal death rates observed on Thursdays/Fridays. Moreover,
assuming the weekends provide the likely time for new infections, the maximum number of new
cases might fall again on Thursdays/Fridays. These observations deserve further study to provide
better understanding of the COVID-19 dynamics.
Introduction
The current worldwide pandemic caused by the SARS-HCoV-2 coronavirus has led within several
months to millions of infected individuals and hundreds of thousands of fatalities, while the
economies of most countries have been largely put on stand style. Therefore, it is urgent to
understand the dynamics of coronaviruses since their repeated straying into the human population
could provoke an existential crisis. As a recent report warns1, dramatic interventions by the
individual governments to locally reduce the effective reproductive number (Rt) by a lockout might
not substantially change the long-term, total number of infections, and possible fatalities, if the
human behavior returns to normal before a vaccine is available2. Moreover, with the onset of the
winter season in the Southern Hemisphere, the COVID-19 infections seem to largely follow an
exponentially increasing trend, which is expected to reappear as a second wave in the Northern
Hemisphere.
Subfamily Coronavirinae3 house the following four genera: Alphacoronavirus (contains many
animal and two human coronaviruses, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63), Betacoronavirus (contains
mouse hepatitis virus, MHV, and the following human viruses: HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1,

and

SARS-HCoV-2),

Gamacoronavirus

and

Deltacoronavirus (contains viruses from cetaceans, birds and pigs)3. As of today, at least seven
coronaviruses are already circulating in the human population. However, SARS-HCoV-2 has a lot
of peculiarities, probably caused by a strong and selective binding of its spike protein to human
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)4. One of the less obvious peculiarities is a periodic
appearance of COVID-19 infectivity and death rates with a typical 7-days oscillatory pattern
observed in numerous countries (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).
Chronobiology describes the mechanisms underlying chronomes, structures in time, which are
found in individual organisms, in populations, and in the environment5. About 7-days (circaseptan)
periodicity is frequently found among plants and animals including humans. As an example of the
circaseptan periodicity, we can mention the following cases that might be triggered by internal or
external factors6:
- the growth of tail and in oviposition in springtails7,
- the occurrence of cardiovascular events in humans8,
- the rejection of allografts in rats and humans9,
- the post-surgical swelling decreased after maxillo-facial surgery in humans10,
- the many meteorological and pollution variables11,
- the societal habits relating to the periods of rest and activity6.
In contrast to the circadian clock12, there isn’t yet any evidence about a molecular mechanism
causing the circaseptan periodicity. Interestingly, the circaseptan periodicity in humans might gave
rise to the 6-days working week followed by 1 day of the rest, observed around the world. In this
weekly periodicity, COVID-19 emerged and possibly locked to the natural circaseptan periodicity,
while magnifying it through the observed periodicity in infectivity and death rates. In certain
countries, the weekly repeating maxima and minima of COVID-19 infectivity and related death
rates are emerging at certain days with a probability close to certainty. It is particularly striking
that the periodicities of COVID-19 infectivity and death rates are almost in phase, and the same
pattern is separately followed by very different countries. Even though, these effects could be to

some extent caused by periodic oscillations in human measuring and reporting of these events, we
cannot exclude more profound reasons of these observations.
Results
A Fourier transform was used to calculate the spectra associated with the dynamics of new cases
and deaths per day of COVID-19, and to reveal possible periodicities present in the reported data
in different countries. A detail analysis was only done in a small set of countries from Europe,
Americas, and Asia, as well as from the whole World. We did not analyze the population in
countries which reported nearly zero number of cases of the coronavirus infections and countries
where the reported numbers of newly acquired cases and deaths could be less reliable.
Europe: Italy was the first European country which was very early and severely hit by COVID19. It did not have enough time to prepare and react adequately to the severity of the situation and
operated under a large stress, while gradually strengthening the lock down rules. Figure 1 (top left)
reveals a strong 7-days and a weak 3.5-days periodicities present in its infectivity, but much weaker
oscillations in the death rate (top right). The minima of infectivity usually took part on Sundays
and death rate on Mondays, while the maxima were about a half week shifted from the minima.
In contrast, Germany has developed COVID-19 infections later and did not implement restrictions
for a relatively long time. Figure 1 (middle) reveals very strong oscillations with a 7-days period
present in both studied parameters. These oscillations could reflect the free activity of the virus
without limitations caused by a lock down. Even more relaxed approach was followed in Sweden,
which was fully open for a long time. Figure 1 (bottom) reveals the strongest observed oscillations
present in both parameters, especially in the death rate. Here, we can also clearly observe the 14days and 3.5-days oscillations.
Other large European countries, such as Spain and France have been also severely hit by COVID19, but the periodic oscillations in the observed parameters were not clearly enough seen, possibly
due to more restricted and chaotic development of the situation. Other smaller countries have also
shown medium oscillatory patterns. From the other large European countries, UK (Fig. 2 (top))
has relatively well developed 7-days and a weak 3.5-days periodicities, perhaps due to relatively
relaxed lock down rules. However, these oscillations were absent in Poland (Fig. 2 (bottom)).

Americas: A similar pattern of the COVID-19 infection has developed in Americas. US (Fig. 3
(top)) initially seemed to follow the pattern like in Italy (NY). Later its oscillatory response turned
out to be similar like in UK, where well developed 7-days and a weak 3.5-days periodicities were
observed. In contrast, Mexico (Fig. 3 (middle)) and other countries in South America showed
relatively strong oscillations with 14, 7, and 3.5-days periods. Interestingly, in Mexico or Peru, the
minima are on Sundays-Tuesdays, while in US (Fig. 3 (top)) or Brazil (Fig. 3 (bottom)) they have
the pattern like in Europe. It is worth mentioning that North America is currently (May 2020)

Asia: We have also picked two countries from Asia, who provided clear data and were successful
in suppressing COVID-19, namely Japan (Fig. 4 (top)) and South Korea (Fig. 4 (bottom)). They
both show 7, and 3.5-days periods in infectivity, but rather complex pattern in death rates, perhaps
affected by the highly controlled nature of the infectivity.

World: Finally, we have also provided the analysis in the whole World (Fig. 5), since the
collective data became recently available. The results reveal 7, and 3.5-days periods in infectivity
and even stronger peaks in death rates. The observed highly regular oscillations of both parameters
present in the whole World signifies the globality of these observations and relevance of the
obtained data. Despite the fact that the oscillatory dynamics is clearly visible in many countries,
some large countries, such as India, do not reveal it.

Discussion
Even if we do not know how the circaseptan cyclicity is generated, we could try to set some
hypothesis on the underlying mechanisms. We can assume that most of the periodicity observed
in the new cases and deaths occurring in COVID-19 does not originate from the sampling
stochasticity, but it results from underlying epigenetic modifications13 which SARS-HCoV-2 is
responsible for. This does not exclude the possibility that epigenetic modifications were triggered
by changes of meteorological and pollution variables that exhibit a week-long periodicity11. For
example, such variables might be human traffic flow outdoor or a poorly working indoor
ventilation in hospitals15. Finally, we cannot exclude a possibility of the desynchronization of the
circadian rhythm. For example, it was observed that rectal temperature and urinary temperature
desynchronized in a woman staying approximately three months in isolation in a subterranean cave
from a circatrigintan rhytm (i.e., an oscillation with a frequency of 1 cycle in 30 ± 5 days)16 and
from an internal circasemiseptan (with a frequency of 1 cycle in 3.5 ± 1 days) 17.
Therefore, we think that it is not a coincidence that the smallest values of the number of new cases
and deaths caused by COVID-19 were often optimistically broadcasted on Sundays/Mondays only
to be taken again over by the largest values in the coming Fridays/Saturdays. It seems that this 7days (± 1-day) periodicity in death minima and maxima contradict the hypothesis that patients with

serious medical conditions are more likely to die in the hospital if they are admitted on a weekend
than if they are admitted on a weekday14.
In summary, the described circaseptan (7-days ± 1 day) periodicity pattern, in some cases
accompanied by admixture with other infradian cycles, such a hemicircaseptan one, is robust in
large and reliably reporting countries representing Europe (Italy; Germany, Sweden, UK), Asia
(Japan, South Korea), North (the USA) and South America (Brazil), as well as the whole World.
Understanding the relationship between variables associated with the observed periodicities might
help with improving health care, better forecasting of the coronavirus infection, stock market
expectations about economic growth’s and it might be of interest for providing a clue for the most
suitable times at which COVID-19 expected therapies should be administered18.
Materials and Methods
The number of newly detected cases and death rates from COVID-19 in individual countries are
publicly available at the following site: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/. The database
updating once per day prevents detection of the circadian (24-hour) and of the ultradian
periodicities. Since, the time frame of the available data covers mid-February till mid-May, we
could not detect periodicities longer than ~15 days (e.g. the lunar one). Also, the data presented in
the

above-mentioned

database

were

probably

somewhat

underestimated.

The

data

underestimations result especially due to substantial asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic
transmissions that make containment-based interventions, especially those depending on
recognition of early symptoms or limited testing, more challenging and potentially infeasible1.
For each country, we recorded (for a finite number of days) the daily number of new cases and
deaths. Then, using http://lampx.tugraz.at/~hadley/num/ch3/3.3a.php, we performed a Fourier
transform of these dependencies and wrote them as follows,
