Abstract
Objective: Early deficiencies in testing capacity contributed to poor control of transmission of
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In the context of marked
improvement in SARS-CoV-2 testing infrastructure, we sought to examine the alignment of
testing with epidemic intensity to mitigate subsequent waves of COVID-19 in Massachusetts.
Methods: We compiled publicly available weekly SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing data for period
(May 27 to October 14, 2020) following the initial COVID-19 wave. We defined testing intensity
as weekly SARS-CoV-2 tests performed per 100,000 population and used weekly test positivity
(percent of tests positive) as a measure of epidemic intensity. We considered optimal alignment
of testing resources to be matching community ranks of testing and positivity. In communities
with a lower rank of testing than positivity in a given week, the testing gap was calculated as
the additional tests required to achieve matching ranks. Multivariable Poisson modeling was
utilized to assess for trends and association with community characteristics.
Results: During the observation period, 4,262,000 tests were reported in Massachusetts and
the misalignment of testing with epidemic intensity increased. The weekly testing gap increased
9.0% per week (adjusted rate ratio [aRR]: 1.090, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-1.10).
Increasing levels of community socioeconomic vulnerability (aRR: 1.35 per quartile increase,
95% CI: 1.23-1.50) and the highest quartile of minority and language vulnerability (aRR: 1.46,
95% CI 0.96-1.49) were associated with increased testing gaps, but the latter association was
not statistically significant. Presence of large university student population (>10% of
population) was associated with a marked decrease in testing gap (aRR 0.21, 95% CI: 0.12-0.38).
Conclusion: These analyses indicate that despite objectives to promote equity and enhance
epidemic control in vulnerable communities, testing resources across Massachusetts have been
disproportionally allocated to more affluent communities. Worsening structural inequities in
access to SARS-CoV-2 testing increase the risk for another intense wave of COVID-19 in
Massachusetts, particularly among vulnerable communities.

SARS-CoV-2 Testing Disparities in Massachusetts
Early deficiencies in testing capacity contributed to poor control of transmission of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),1 particularly among minority and
socioeconomically vulnerable communities.2,3 Allocating testing resources to locations of
greatest need are important to mitigate subsequent waves of COVID-19.4 In the context of
marked improvement in SARS-CoV-2 testing infrastructure, we sought to examine the
alignment of testing with epidemic intensity in Massachusetts.
Methods:
We compiled publicly available weekly SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing data from the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) and Boston Public Health Commission
(BPHC) for period (May 27 to October 14, 2020) following the initial COVID-19 wave. The BPHC
reported tests of unique Boston residents whereas MDPH reported total tests of residents
across the state, including repeat testing of individuals. Consequently, we performed separate
analyses for all residents of Massachusetts (351 cities and towns) and Boston residents alone
(15 neighborhoods).
We defined testing intensity as weekly SARS-CoV-2 tests performed per 100,000 population and
used weekly test positivity (percent of tests positive) as a measure of epidemic intensity. We
considered optimal alignment of testing resources to be matching community ranks of testing
and positivity. In communities with a lower rank of testing than positivity in a given week, the
testing gap was calculated as the additional tests required to achieve matching ranks.
Communities with matching or higher ranks of testing compared with positivity were
considered to have no testing gap.
Data from the American Community Survey (2014-2018) were used to characterize
communities. Negative binomial Poisson models with robust sandwich estimators were fit to
assess trends in the magnitude of the testing gap over time and associations with selected
Social Vulnerability Index domains (Socioeconomic Status, and Minority Status and Language),
and large university student population (>10% of residents). Due to collinearity, the model of
Boston neighborhoods only assessed associations with time and socioeconomic vulnerability.
Results:
During the observation period, 4,262,000 tests were reported in Massachusetts and 44,180
detected SARS-CoV-2 (1.0% positivity). Median cumulative COVID-19 incidence among
communities was 339 (range 0-6670) per 100,000. Median testing intensity across communities
was 41,000 (range 5350-274,000) per 100,000 with observed increased testing in the Boston
metropolitan area, vacation communities, and university towns (Figure 1).
In multivariable model of statewide testing, the misalignment of testing with epidemic intensity
grew, with the testing gap increasing 9.0% per week (adjusted rate ratio [aRR]: 1.090, 95%
confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-1.10, p<0.001) (Figure 2). Increasing levels of community
socioeconomic vulnerability (aRR: 1.35 per quartile increase, 95% CI: 1.23-1.50, p<0.001) and

the highest quartile of minority and language vulnerability (aRR: 1.46, 95% CI 0.96-1.49,
p=0.076) were associated with increased testing gaps, but the latter association was not
statistically significant. Presence of large university student population was associated with a
marked decrease in testing gap (aRR 0.21, 95% CI: 0.12-0.38, p<0.001).
Similar findings were observed within Boston, with testing gaps increasing (aRR: 1.08 per week,
95% CI: 1.03-1.13, p=0.003) and larger testing gaps in more socioeconomically vulnerable
neighborhoods (aRR 2.51 per quartile increase, 95% CI: 1.56-4.03, p< 0.001).
Discussion:
These analyses indicate that despite objectives to promote equity and enhance epidemic
control in vulnerable communities,5,6 testing resources across Massachusetts have been
disproportionally allocated to more affluent communities. Expanded testing on university
campuses contributed to inequity, but disparity persisted following adjustment for these
additional tests.
This study has limitations, including use of test positivity to estimate epidemic intensity despite
varying rates of asymptomatic testing and aggregation at the community level that could
underestimate disparities.
Worsening structural inequities in access to SARS-CoV-2 testing increase the risk for another
intense wave of COVID-19 in Massachusetts, particularly among vulnerable communities.

Figure 1. Socioeconomic vulnerability, SARS-CoV-2 testing intensity, and mean SARS-CoV-2
testing gap among Massachusetts cities and towns, and Boston neighborhoods, May 27October 14, 2020. Community socioeconomic vulnerability (A, B) estimated by the percentile
from the Socioeconomic Status domain of the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention). Testing intensity (C, D) includes total tests (including repeat
tests in same individual) for Massachusetts but tested individuals (not including repeat testing)
for Boston neighborhoods. Average weekly testing gap (E, F) calculated as mean gap (number of
additional tests needed so that community rank of testing would match rank of positivity)
during the observation period. Blue colored circles indicate communities with large university
student populations (>10% of residents). Data broken into three categories for illustrative
purposes, but statistical models considered gap as continuous and socioeconomic vulnerability
as quartiles of the United States population.
