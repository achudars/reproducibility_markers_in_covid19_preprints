Abstract

47

High frequency screening of populations has been proposed as a strategy in facilitating

48

control of the COVID-19 pandemic. We use computational modeling, coupled with clinical data

49

from rapid antigen tests, to predict the impact of frequent viral antigen rapid testing on COVID-

50

19 spread and outcomes. Using patient nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens, we demonstrate

51

that the sensitivity/specificity of two rapid antigen tests compared to quantitative real-time

52

polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) are 82.0%/100% and 84.7%/85.7%, respectively;

53

moreover, sensitivity correlates directly with viral load. Based on COVID-19 data from three

54

regions in the United States and São José do Rio Preto, Brazil, we show that high frequency,

55

strategic population-wide rapid testing, even at varied accuracy levels, diminishes COVID-19

56

infections, hospitalizations, and deaths at a fraction of the cost of nucleic acid detection via qRT-

57

PCR. We propose large-scale antigen-based surveillance as a viable strategy to control SARS-

58

CoV-2 spread and to enable societal re-opening.

INTRODUCTION

70

The COVID-19 pandemic has taken an unprecedented toll on lives, wellbeing, healthcare

71

systems, and global economies. As of 18 January 2021, there have been more than 95.2 million

72

confirmed cases globally with more than 2 million confirmed deaths1. However, these statistics

73

and the current mapping of disease spread present an incomplete picture of the outbreak largely

74

due to the lack of adequate testing, particularly as undetected infected cases are the main source

75

of disease spread 2–7. It is estimated that the number of infected cases is more than 6 times higher

76

than the cases reported8. As of January 2021, the United States, India, and Brazil remain the top

77

three countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide. As countries

78

begin to re-open their economies, a method for accessible and frequent surveillance of COVID-

79

19, with the necessary rapid quarantine measures, is crucial to prevent the multiple resurgences of

80

the disease.

81

The current standard of care rightfully places a strong focus on the diagnostic limit of

82

detection, yet frequently at the expense of both cost and turnaround time. This situation has

83

contributed to limited population testing largely due to a dearth of diagnostic resources.

84

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is the gold-standard method for

85

clinical diagnosis, with high sensitivity and specificity, but these tests require trained personnel,

86

expensive reagents and instrumentation, and a significant amount of time to execute9,10. Facilities

87

offering qRT-PCR sometimes require a week or longer to complete and return the results to the

88

patient11,12. During this waiting period the undiagnosed individual may spread the infection and/or

89

receive delayed medical treatment. Moreover, due to the cost and relative inaccessibility of qRT-

90

PCR in both resource-limited and abundant settings, large-scale screening using qRT-PCR at

91

frequent intervals remains impractical to identify infected but asymptomatic or mildly

4

92

symptomatic infections. Numerous studies have reported asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections

93

as well as a variation in viral load within and between individuals at different time points,

94

suggesting the need for more frequent testing for informative surveillance13–18.

95

Technologies such as rapid viral antigen detection, clustered regularly interspaced short

96

palindromic repeats (CRISPR), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of SARS-

97

CoV-2 provide potential large-scale screening applications, yet their implementation is stymied by

98

requirements for qRT-PCR-like accuracy before they can reach the market 19. Several members of

99

the scientific and medical community have emphasized the value of widespread and frequent

100

antigen testing20–22. In countries such as India, where the qRT-PCR resources would not be

101

sufficient to cover monitoring of the population, the use of rapid antigen tests is well underway23,24.

102

In early May 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the first

103

antigen test for the laboratory detection of COVID-19, citing a need for testing beyond molecular

104

and serological methods. Antigen testing detects the viral proteins rather than nucleic acids or

105

human antibodies, allowing for detection of an active infection with relative ease of sample

106

collection and assay. These rapid assays – like other commercially-available rapid antigen tests -

107

can be mass-produced at low prices and be administered by the average person without a laboratory

108

or instrumentation. These tests also take as little as 15 minutes to determine the result, enabling

109

real-time surveillance and/or diagnosis. Although antigen tests usually perform with high

110

specificities (true negative rate), their sensitivity (true positive rate) is often lower when compared

111

to molecular assays. While qRT-PCR can reach a limit of detection as low as 102 genome copies

112

per mL, rapid antigen testing detects viral protein that is assumed to correlate with approximately

113

105 genome copies per mL 25.

114

We hypothesize that frequent antigen-based rapid testing even with lower sensitivities

115

compared to qRT-PCR - along with appropriate quarantine measures - can be more effective at

116

decreasing COVID-19 spread than less frequent molecular testing of symptomatic individuals.

117

Keeping in mind the realities of daily testing in resource-limited regions, we also hypothesize that

118

testing frequency can be adjusted according to the prevalence of the disease; that is, an uptick in

119

reported cases should be accompanied by more frequent testing. During the viral incubation period,

120

high infectivity correlates with a high viral load that can be detected by either qRT-PCR or rapid

121

antigen testing

122

Studies also point to the relatively small window of time during an individual’s incubation period

123

in which the qRT-PCR assay is more sensitive than rapid tests 21.

18,21,26–28

. Rapid tests thus optimize diagnosis for the most infectious individuals.

124

In this study we report the clinical validation of two direct antigen rapid tests for detection

125

of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S) or nucleocapsid protein (N) using retrospectively collected

126

nasopharyngeal or nasal swab specimens. Using the clinical performance data, we develop a

127

modeling system to evaluate the impact of frequent rapid testing on COVID-19 spread and

128

outcomes using a variation of a SIR model, which has been previously used to model COVID-19

129

transmission 29–35. We build on this model to incorporate quarantine states and testing protocols to

130

examine the effects of different testing regimes. This model distinguishes between undetected and

131

detected infections and separates severe cases, specifically, those requiring hospitalization, from

132

those less so, which is important for disease response systems such as intensive care unit triaging.

133

We simulate COVID-19 spread with rapid testing and model disease outcomes in three regions in

134

the United States and São José do Rio Preto, Brazil - the site of the clinical validation study - using

135

publicly available data. To date, COVID-19 modeling describes the course of disease spread in

136

response to social distancing and quarantine measures, and a previous simulation study has shown

137

that frequent testing with accuracies less than qRT-PCR, coupled with quarantine process and

138

social distancing, are predicted to significantly decrease infections

139

modeling system using publicly-available data to simulate how potential public health strategies

140

based on testing performance, frequency, and geography impact the course of COVID-19 spread

141

and outcomes. Our findings suggest that a rapid test, even with sensitivities lower than molecular

142

tests, when strategically administered 2-3 times per week, will reduce COVID-19 spread,

143

hospitalizations, and deaths at a fraction of the cost of nucleic acid testing via qRT-PCR. Modern

144

surveillance systems should be well equipped with rapid testing tools to ensure that disease

145

146

needs.

Accuracy of Direct Antigen Rapid Tests Correlate with Viral Load Levels

150

Rapid antigen tests have recently been considered a viable source for first-line screening,

151

although concerns regarding the accuracy of these tests persist. We clinically validated two

152

different direct antigen rapid tests for the detection of either N or S from SARS-CoV-2 in

153

retrospectively collected nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Of the total number of nasal

154

swab specimens evaluated by qRT-PCR for amplification of SARS-CoV-2 N, S, and ORF1ab

155

genes, 100 tested positive and 58 tested negative (Table 1-2). The overall sensitivity and specificity

156

of the rapid antigen test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 N, evaluated across the nasal swab

157

specimens, was 82.0% and 100%, respectively. Of the total number of nasopharyngeal swab

158

specimens evaluated by qRT-PCR for amplification of SARS-CoV-2 N, RNA-dependent RNA

159

polymerase (RdRp), and envelope (E) genes, 72 tested positive and 49 tested negative (Table 1,

Table 3). The overall sensitivity and specificity of the rapid antigen test for detection of SARS-

161

CoV-2 S, evaluated across the nasopharyngeal swab specimens was 84.7% and 85.7%,

162

respectively. Altogether, our data demonstrate that the sensitivity of the rapid antigen tests are

163

positively correlated to the viral load level (Table 1, Figure S1).

164

The Ct value indirectly quantifies the viral RNA copy number related to the viral load of

165

the sample for the specific assay 40–42. Ct values represent the number of qRT-PCR cycles at which

166

generated fluorescence crosses a threshold during the linear amplification phase; Ct values are

167

therefore inversely related to the viral load. The sensitivity of both rapid antigen tests increases as

168

Ct value decreases (Table 1). Moreover, because the Ct value is a variable unit based upon qPCR

169

protocol and instrumentation, we evaluated sensitivity against the percentile of positive cases

170

conditioned to Ct and found similar results. The sensitivity of the rapid antigen test for detection

171

of SARS-CoV-2 N increased from 80.0% at Ct values <40 to 92.5% at Ct values <25

172

(Supplementary Fig. 1a). Similarly, the sensitivity of the rapid antigen test for detection of SARS-

173

CoV-2 S increased from 84.7% at Ct values <35 to 100.0% at Ct values <15 (Supplementary Fig.

174

1b). Taken together, the clinical data shows that the rapid antigen test performs with increasing

175

accuracy for individuals with a higher viral load, and potentially the most infectious 18,26–28.

177

An Enhanced Epidemiological SIDHRE-Q Model

178

We propose an enhanced epidemiological modeling system, SIDHRE-Q, a variant of the

179

classical SIR model in order to expand our clinical validation study and to understand the effects

180

of using frequent rapid tests such as the rapid antigen test on COVID-19 outbreak dynamics. The

181

changes we make to the basic model to encompass the unique characteristics of the COVID-19

182

pandemic are similar to those presented by Giordano et al. (16) (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 2).

183

The differential equations governing the evolution of the SIDHRE-Q model and descriptions of

184

the parameter values are provided in the methods section (Equation 1, Table 4).

185

An individual that begins in Susceptible (S) may either transition to a Quarantine

186

Uninfected (Q-U) state via a false positive result or to an Infected Undetected (I) state via

187

interaction with an infected individual. Should an individual in S move into Q-U, they are

188

quarantined for 10 days before returning to S, a time period chosen based on current knowledge

189

of the infectious period of the disease and is consistent with CDC guidelines43. One could also

190

conceive of an effective strategy in which individuals exit quarantine after producing a certain

191

number of negative rapid tests in the days following their initial positive result or confirm their

192

negative result using qRT-PCR. Prolonged incubation beyond 10 days is assumed to be unlikely

193

– post-quarantine risk of transmission is estimated at 1% - and hence is not included in this

194

probabilistic model. 43

195

State I contains individuals who are infected but not diagnosed. Given that those diagnosed

196

are predominantly quarantined, the undiagnosed individuals in I – many of which are pre- or

197

asymptomatic – interact more with the S population than do those in Infected Detected (D) and

198

transmission due to this population is critically important to modeling outbreaks. Therefore, the

199

infectious rate for I is assumed to be significantly larger than for D. Furthermore, a region’s ability

200

to control an outbreak is directly related to how quickly and effectively the population in I tests

201

into D, reducing transmission rates through quarantine. From both I and D individuals may

202

transition into Recovered (R), accounting for the many cases of infection that are never detected.

203

This study, in particular, highlights the critical role frequency of testing, along with strict

204

quarantine, has in mitigating the spread of the disease and provides specific testing strategies based

205

on rapid tests we predict to be highly effective.

206

In this model, we assume that individuals receive a positive diagnosis before developing

207

severe symptoms and that those with symptoms severe enough to be potentially fatal will go to the

208

hospital. If an individual develops symptoms, we assume they are tested daily until receiving a

209

positive result; hence, before severe symptoms develop, they will be diagnosed with high

210

probability. Those who do not develop symptoms are tested according to the frequency of tests

211

administered to the general population. Therefore, there is no modeled connection between I and

212

Hospitalized (H) or between I and Extinct (E). Removing these assumptions would have negligible

213

impact on the results as these flows are very small. We estimated the flows using data on

214

approximate total deaths due to COVID based on excess deaths in the states examined and found

215

them to be zero on greater than 10% of the days considered for each location. Although lacking

216

this information for São José do Rio Preto, we made the same assumption.

217

Should an individual test positive and transition to D, they may either develop serious

218

symptoms requiring care or recover. Those who develop serious symptoms and transition to state

219

H will then transition to either R or E. The recovered population is also tested with the same

220

frequency as the rest of the population, as infected individuals may recover without being detected

221

and the modeled testing strategy has no way of differentiating with certainty between false

222

positives and true positive, asymptomatic cases. Therefore, the Quarantined Recovered (Q-R)

223

state is introduced with the same connections to R as the connections between S and Q-U. Though

224

the reinfection rate of SARS-CoV-2 has been a point of recent debate, it is assumed that the number

225

of re-infected individuals is small 44–48. Therefore, individuals cannot transition from R to S, hence

226

the separately categorized quarantined populations. Should knowledge to the contrary arise as the

227

pandemic continues, a flow could be added from R to S with rate inversely proportional to the

228

time for which immunity lasts.

229

We considered several variations and extensions of the SIDHRE-Q model. In simulations,

230

we tested additional states, such as those in the SIDARTHE model, which include distinctions

231

between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases for both detected and undetected populations

232

Incorporating information about the correlations between viral load and infectivity and sensitivity

233

were also considered. Altogether, our modeling system has been well tuned to predict the impact

234

of high frequency rapid testing on COVID-19 spread and outcomes.

Frequent Rapid Testing with Actionable Quarantining Dramatically Reduces Disease

237

Spread

238

In order to demonstrate how strategies could affect the disease spread in different

239

geographies and demographics, we used surveillance data obtained from regions of varying

240

characteristics: the state of Massachusetts (MA), New York City (NYC), Los Angeles (LA), and

241

São José do Rio Preto (SJRP), Brazil, the site of the rapid antigen test clinical validation study.

242

These regions are also selected in our study due to the readily available surveillance data provided

243

by the local governments. We fit the model to the data from each region starting 1 April 2020. At

244

this time point the disease reportedly is most advanced in NYC and least advanced in SJRP, Brazil

245

with estimated cumulative infection rates of 7.11% and 0.12%, respectively.

246

After calibrating the SIDHRE-Q model, the disease spread is observed with varying

247

validated rapid antigen test performances and frequencies (Fig. 2). Sensitivity (the ratio of true

248

positives to the total number of positives) and specificity (the ratio of true negatives to the total

249

number of negatives) compared to gold-standard qRT-PCR were used as measures of test

250

accuracy.

251

The rapid test frequency is varied while maintaining an accuracy of 80% sensitivity and

252

90% specificity, comparable to our clinical data collected in SJRP, Brazil. These testing scenarios

253

are then compared to symptomatic testing, in which individuals receive a rapid test only when

254

presenting symptoms, via either a rapid test or qRT-PCR. Since the primary testing regimen

255

deployed in MA, LA, NYC and SJRP, Brazil is qRT-PCR-based and focused on symptomatic

256

individuals, the symptomatic testing protocol via qRT-PCR is directly estimated from the data to

257

be the rate 𝜈 (Table 4).

258

The difference between the qRT-PCR and rapid test simulations (red and orange lines,

259

respectively) is therefore only sensitivity of testing (Fig. 2). We assumed that test outcome

260

probability is a function only of whether an individual is infected and independent of other factors;

261

one can consider this a lower bound on effectiveness of a strategy, as sensitivity and infectivity

262

are often positively correlated with antigen testing.

263

To better understand the effect of rapid testing frequency and performance on healthcare

264

capacity and mortality rates, we simulate the testing strategy with 30%-90% sensitivity each with

265

80% or 90% specificity against the symptomatic testing strategy (Supplementary Fig. 3).

266

As per our hypothesis, frequency and symptom-based testing dramatically reduced

267

infections, simultaneous hospitalizations, and total deaths when compared to the purely symptom-

268

based testing regiments, and infections, hospitalization, and death were reduced as frequency

269

increased. Although testing every day was clearly most effective, even testing every fourteen days

270

with an imperfect test gave an improvement over symptomatic testing with qRT-PCR. While the

271

strategy works best when implemented at the very beginning of an outbreak, as demonstrated by

272

the results in SJRP, Brazil, it also works to curb an outbreak that is already large, as demonstrated

273

by the results in NYC. The difference between frequencies is more noticeable when the testing

12

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.01.20184713; this version posted January 30, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

274

strategy is applied to the outbreak in NYC, leading us to hypothesize that smaller outbreaks require

275

a lower testing frequency than larger ones; note the difference between the dependence on

276

frequency to curb a small initial outbreak in SJRP, Brazil versus a large one in NYC (Fig. 3).

277

For test performance of 80% sensitivity and 90% specificity, the percent of the population

278

that has been infected in total from the beginning of the outbreak to mid-July drops from 18%

279

(MA), 11% (LA), 26% (NYC), and 11% (SJRP, Brazil) to 3%, 2%, 12%, and 0.26%, respectively,

280

using a weekly rapid testing and quarantine strategy (with regards to predictions of overall

281

infection rates, other studies based on seroprevalence and epidemiological predictions have

282

reached similar conclusions 49,50). If testing is increased to once every three days, these numbers

283

drop further to 1.6% (ΜΑ), 1.4% (LΑ), 9.5% (ΝΥC), and 0.19% (SJRP, Brazil) (Table S1).

284

To further examine the relationship between frequency and sensitivity, we modeled the

285

maximum number of individuals in a given state over the 105-day time period for four geographic

286

regions (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 4). In all four geographic regions, as frequency of testing

287

increases, the total infections, maximum simultaneous hospitalizations, and total deaths converge

288

to small percentages regardless of the sensitivity at high frequencies. It is clear that the difference

289

in frequency required to achieve the same result using tests of differing sensitivities is very small.

290

For example, we predict that for the outbreak in LA, a testing strategy started on 1 April of every

291

10 days using a test of sensitivity 90% would have resulted in 2.5% of the population having been

292

infected, while using a test of sensitivity 30% would require a strategy of every 5 days to achieve

293

the same number. Thus, we conclude that frequency is more important than sensitivity in curbing

294

the spread, and a large range of sensitivities prove effective when testing sufficiently often

295

(Supplementary Fig. 4)29,51. The following subsection contains a discussion of a location-based

296

method for varying the exact frequency of testing based on evolving outbreaks. Frequency of

297

testing can be significantly reduced to effectively contain the disease once the initial outbreak has

298

been controlled; it is clear that this takes only a matter of weeks (Fig. 2).

299

On the other hand, according to the specificity of the rapid test and the quarantine duration,

300

larger testing frequency result in a larger percent of the population quarantined (Fig. 2). Assuming

301

a 90% rapid test specificity and 10-day quarantine duration, for the 1-, 3- and 7-day frequencies

302

almost 48%, 24% and 12% of the population, respectively, would be quarantined. This figure may

303

be reduced with additional rules for exiting quarantine early, such as after complementary testing.

304

An example of such a strategy is that individuals who test positive are required to either quarantine

305

for two weeks or produce two consecutive negative rapid tests in the two days following their

306

positive result. Assuming 80% sensitivity and 90% specificity, those individuals will reenter the

307

public while still infected with probability 0.04. If uninfected, that individual will exit quarantine

308

after two days with probability 0.81. However, a compromise between the reduction of infections

309

and the proportion of the population in quarantine would be part of the planning for the appropriate

310

testing protocol in each community or region.

311

Additionally, while high frequency may be necessary to contain a large outbreak initially,

312

relatively infrequent testing, such as every one or two weeks, is sufficient to keep controlled

313

outbreaks small, while reducing the number of quarantined individuals to less than 10% of the

314

population using a two-week mandatory quarantine.

A County-Based Testing Strategy Offers a Cost-effective Approach to Large-scale COVID-

317

19 Surveillance

318

To examine the effects of resource-strategic testing schemes, we modeled the COVID-19

319

prevalence by varying testing frequency across counties of California. For this analysis, only

320

California was analyzed because of the accessibility of the county level data and the variability of

321

spread dynamics of the outbreaks between counties. In this scheme, the percent of active infected

322

detected individuals in a county determines the frequency of testing. We define thresholds for the

323

number of active detected infections that, when hit, initiate testing protocols of different

324

frequencies depending on the threshold hit. We first tested evenly spaced thresholds for the number

325

of detected active infections up to 1% of the population, but later adopted thresholds that were

326

determined according to Equation 2. In Equation 2, D = population of state D at the time of testing.

327

T = number of active infections which, if reached, initiates everyday testing. The days between

328

tests are rounded to the closest integer value.

329
330

(2)

331

The days between tests are chosen such that the detected active infections should remain near to

332

or below T. If the initial detected active infections are greater than T, then the testing frequency

333

of 1 will cause infections to rapidly drop. Both the threshold at which everyday testing begins and

334

the coefficient of log2T/D can be modified to produce a strategy that is more or less frequent in

335

testing or resource effective; a range of days between tests from 14 days to 1 day are used (Fig.

336

4a). The purpose of this strategy is to tailor testing based on the specific characteristics of local

337

outbreaks in order to mitigate the overall spread faster and more efficiently. A scan over different

338

choices of T is shown in Fig. 4b; the threshold we choose in Fig. 4a is 0.05% because it is successful

339

in curbing the outbreak within the time period we consider. While the choices work for the

340

epidemic in California at the point we start our simulations, 10 April, they do not necessarily reflect

341

the most resource effective choices everywhere. Our analysis could be redone to select the best

342

fine-grained strategy in other states or metropolitan areas. The cost analysis is based only on cost

343

per test ($7 per rapid test and $100 per PCR test) times number of tests. Clearly this neglects the

15

344

costs of storing, distributing, and administering tests, as well as monitoring incoming results. The

345

costs associated with these logistics would vary with differing policies dictating the administration

346

of rapid tests; significantly, whether they would be administered at home and the results self-

347

reported or in a testing facility or workplace for validation purposes. For example, a company

348

may choose to use the rapid tests to scan employees before allowing them to enter the workplace,

349

in a way similar (but more effective) to temperature checks. The cost of this particular application

350

would be minimal beyond the cost of the actual tests. Such costs would inevitably be greater for

351

PCR tests, which require a specialized testing facility, significant equipment, and highly trained

352

personnel.

353

Using a rapid test with a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 90%, the county-based testing

354

with threshold 0.05% reduces the active infections from 0.94% to 0.0005%, while the uniform

355

strategy with tests administered every 7 days results in double the number of active infections (Fig.

356

4a). As the threshold is reduced, the total cost increases while the cumulative infections, maximum

357

percentage hospitalized, and cumulative deaths all decrease (Fig. 4b). Appropriate choice of

358

threshold is dependent on the severity of outbreaks in a specific region and available resources,

359

both logistically and fiscally. With regional data, such as that from California used to produce Fig.

360

4b, this study can be reproduced to calculate an efficient testing strategy that will effectively curb

361

outbreaks of differing severities in any geographic entity.

362

Strategy B in Fig. 4 consists of qRT-PCR testing uniformly applied to the highlighted

363

population with a frequency of once weekly. The average cost per person per day is just under $15.

364

Despite this frequency and the accuracy of qRT-PCR, the strategy does not succeed in curbing the

365

spread as fast as strategy A, which uses a testing sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 90%,

366

respectively, and testing frequency that vary between counties depending on the proportion of their

DISCUSSION

371

In this study we examine the potential effects of a novel testing strategy to limit the spread

372

of SARS-CoV-2 utilizing rapid antigen test screening approaches. Our clinical data and SIDHRE-

373

Q modeling system demonstrate that 1) frequent rapid testing even at a range of accuracies is

374

effective at reducing COVID-19 spread, 2) rapid antigen tests are a viable source for this strategy

375

and diagnose the most infectious individuals, and 3) strategic geographic-based testing can

376

optimize disease control with the amount of available resources. The public has witnessed and

377

experienced symptomatic individuals being denied testing due to shortages, and few testing

378

structures for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals, – a significant source of disease

379

spread. Though several factors contributed to the stymied early response measures, such as

380

lockdown and quarantine protocols and adherence, severe testing bottlenecks have been a

381

significant culprit 52–54. Early control measures have been shown to decrease lives lost by several

382

orders of magnitude

383

pandemic, remain at the forefront of the public health crises.

55

. These challenges, though exacerbated during the early months of the

384

Diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by qRT-PCR is the current standard of care, yet

385

remains expensive and requires a laboratory and experienced personnel for sample preparations

386

and experimentation. The turnaround time for results can be up to 10 days, preventing people from

387

either leaving quarantine if they are negative, or delaying critical care and infecting others if they

388

are positive 12. This current testing scheme moreover yields incomplete surveillance data on which

389

response efforts such as societal reopening and hospital management depend. Though qRT-PCR

390

is considered the gold-standard diagnostic method because of its high sensitivity and specificity,

391

the logistical hurdles render it unrealistic for large-scale screening.

392

As qRT-PCR remains impractical for this strategy, and rapid tests are facing regulatory

393

challenges because they do not perform with qRT-PCR-like accuracy, rapid test screening is either

394

nonexistent in several countries or symptom-based. Even under best-case assumptions, findings

395

have shown that symptom and risk-based screening strategies miss more than half of the infected

396

individuals

397

variability in test sensitivity and specificity 57. Here, we present alternative large-scale diagnostic

398

tools to qRT-PCR, and show that test performance, though valuable, is secondary to widespread

399

test frequency, which is enabled by accessibility and turnaround time. Furthermore, test

400

affordability is essential for the successful implementation in communities most affected by

401

infection and will to speed up the safe opening and functioning of the viral sectors of the economy.

402

Giordano et al. has modeled the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 spread, introducing a diagnosed

403

state to elucidate the importance of population-wide testing 29. Larremore et al. has examined how

404

various test sensitivities and frequencies affect the reproductive number 21. We build upon these

405

findings to show how in affected United States and Brazil regions, population-wide frequent and

406

rapid testing schemes, with sensitivities ranging from 30%-90%, can be more effective in curbing

407

the pandemic than a PCR-based scheme. Integrating real-world surveillance and clinical data into

408

our modeling system has allowed us to incorporate regional differences - such as variances in

409

healthcare access, state health policy and adherence, state GDP, and environmental factors - under

410

the same model. Significantly, our findings hold true across Massachusetts, New York City, Los

411

Angeles, and São José do Rio Preto, Brazil. We also present the economic considerations of these

412

testing regimes, showing that widespread rapid testing is more cost efficient than less frequent

56

. Some have argued that the need for widespread testing is overstated due to the

18

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.01.20184713; this version posted January 30, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

413

qRT-PCR testing. In line with these economic considerations, our model demonstrates the

414

effectiveness of a geographic-based frequent testing regime, in which high disease prevalence

415

areas receive more frequent testing than low disease prevalence areas.

416

Since COVID-19 is known to affect certain demographics differently, modeling would

417

benefit from incorporating demographic information correlated with disease progression and

418

spread to define sub-models and sets of parameters accordingly. Age, pre-existing conditions, job

419

types, and density of population are examples of possible categories, each of which influence the

420

risk of contracting and/or dying from COVID-19. Further studies would benefit from incorporating

421

these ideas to better understand the effectiveness of rapid testing on identifying potential super

422

spreading events. Future public health prevention programs should use the proposed modeling

423

system to develop and test scenarios for precision testing and prevention.

424

Our findings also point to low-cost tools for implementation of this testing strategy, such

425

as a rapid antigen-based test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We show that the rapid

426

antigen tests perform with a range of accuracies under which disease spread can be dramatically

427

mitigated under our model. Notably, the sensitivity is correlated to the individual’s viral load,

428

effectively diagnosing those who are potentially the most infectious with the highest accuracy. Our

429

findings are significant because rapid antigen tests are cheaper than qRT-PCR, can be mass

430

produced to millions per day, present results within 15 minutes, and can be administered by a

431

nonexpert without a lab or special equipment.

432

There are several policy implications for these findings. First, our model supports that

433

systems of high frequency rapid testing should be implemented as a first-line screening method.

434

This can be first enabled by a more holistic regulatory evaluation of rapid diagnostics, such that

435

policy emphasizes accessibility and turnaround time even under a range of accuracies. One can

436

imagine a less accurate, though rapid method of first-line screening in schools, public

437

transportation, and airports, or even at home, and a qRT-PCR-based method for second-line

438

screening (testing those who present severe symptoms or have been in contact with infected

439

individuals, testing in a clinical setting, etc). At home tests require a built-in digital reporting

440

capability58; rapid antigen test results can be sent to local health centers with reciprocal instructions

441

regarding updated test frequency guidelines to enable adaptive testing strategies. Second, our cost

442

analysis and rapid antigen test data present a viable and potentially more cost-effective method for

443

screening. Third, our county-based testing scheme presents a possible method for wide-scale

444

screening while optimizing resources. Future studies should investigate how this selective testing

445

strategy can be applied to different location scales to further inform health policy. Moreover,

446

though our models analyze regions in the United States and Brazil, similar testing strategies can

447

be considered globally in both resource limited and abundant settings due to the higher

448

accessibility of rapid tests compared to qRT-PCR. This model can be further tailored to the

449

pandemic course as we gain further evidence regarding SARS-CoV-2 re-infection rates.

450

We emphasize that integral to the effectiveness of diagnostic schemes is 1) the proper

451

adherence to quarantine and public health measures and 2) the combined use of a variety of

452

diagnostic methods including nucleic acid, antigen, and antibody tests. According to these models,

453

rapid antigen tests are an ideal tool for first-line screening. Clinical molecular tests such as qRT-

454

PCR are vital to the diagnostic landscape, particularly to re-test suspected cases that were negative

455

on the rapid test. Because rapid tests present a higher rate of false negatives, methods such as qRT-

456

PCR remain integral to second-line screening. Antibody tests provide important information for

457

immunity and vaccination purposes as well as epidemiological surveillance. This model also

458

assumes that individuals will quarantine themselves before being tested and for 10 days following

459

a positive diagnostic result and will not be infected while waiting for the qRT-PCR results.

460

There are important limitations to be considered in this model. Differences in disease

461

reporting between the geographical regions and the incomplete nature of COVID-19 surveillance

462

data, often due to the lack of testing or delays in reporting, are not considered in the model. It is

463

imperative that the testing results, hospitalization and death statistics, and changes in protocol are

464

reported in real-time to scientists and policy makers so that models can be accurately tuned as the

465

pandemic develops. Infectivity variations between individuals is also not applied to this model,

466

and future clinical studies should gather data on asymptomatic presenting COVID-19 cases. Non-

467

compliant quarantine behaviors and possible infections during testing waiting times are also not

468

included in the calculations. The model also does not take into account infrastructural limitations

469

(eg. hospital capacity) and . Though the rapid antigen test offers several advantages such as

470

affordability, fast turnaround time, and ease of mass production, we are assuming that there are

471

systems in place to implement frequent and safe low-cost screening across different communities

472

and settings.

473

Our model underscores the need for a point-of-care or at-home test for frequent screening,

474

particularly as lockdown restrictions ease. Regulatory agencies can work towards evaluating rapid

475

tests to alternative standards other than comparison to high sensitivity molecular diagnostics, as

476

our model shows that frequency and scale of testing may overcome lower sensitivities. Rather, we

477

can refocus policy to implement first-line screening that optimizes accuracy with efficiency and

478

equitability.

METHODS

482

Development of Direct Antigen Rapid Tests for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2

483

We developed a direct antigen rapid test for the detection of the nucleocapsid protein or

484

spike glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 in nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens as previously

485

described

486

readout using anti-N or anti-S mouse monoclonal antibodies (E25Bio, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA)

487

that are either coupled to 40 nm gold nanoparticles (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or adsorbed to

488

nitrocellulose membranes (Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany). Each rapid antigen test has a control

489

area adjacent to the paper absorbent pad; the control is an anti-mouse Fc domain antibody (Leinco

490

Technologies, Fenton, MO, USA) that will capture any of the antibody-conjugated gold

491

nanoparticles to generate a control visual signal. A visual signal at the test area reflects SARS-

492

CoV-2 N or S that is “sandwiched” between an anti-N or anti-S antibody adsorbed to the

493

nitrocellulose membrane and a second anti-N or anti-S antibody covalently coupled to visible gold

494

nanoparticles.

Validation of Direct Antigen Rapid Test for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2

497

In a retrospective study of nasal swab specimens form human patients, we compared the

498

accuracy of the rapid antigen test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 N to the viral loads of individuals.

499

All individuals were symptomatic between 1-10 days of fever. Nasal swab specimens (n=158)

500

were tested following approved human subjects use protocols. The nasal swab specimens were

501

banked frozen from suspected patients submitted to PATH for routine COVID diagnosis. Prior to

502

using the rapid test, the nasal swab specimens were validated by qRT-PCR using the FDA EUA

505

clearance from the PATH Research Ethics Committee, protocol number 00004244. The nasal swab

506

specimens were de-identified, containing no demographic data, prior to analysis.

507

The nasal swabs were originally collected in 1 mL PBS, where 50 μl was mixed with 50 μl

508

of Solution Buffer (0.9% NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100). The 100 μl mixture was then pipetted

509

onto the rapid antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 N detection and allowed to react for 15 minutes. After

510

processing of the rapid antigen test, the visual positive or negative signal was documented.

511

Additionally, in a retrospective study of nasopharyngeal swab specimens from human

512

patients, we compared the accuracy of the rapid antigen test to the viral load of individuals.

513

Nasopharyngeal swab specimens (n = 121) were tested in Brazil following approved human

514

subjects use protocols. The age of study participants ranged from 1 to 95 years with an overall

515

median of 37 years (interquartile range, 27–51 years), and 62% were female. All individuals were

516

symptomatic between 1-10 days of fever. The demographic summary of the patients are included

517

in Table S2. The nasopharyngeal swab specimens were banked refrigerated or frozen samples from

518

suspected patients submitted to the lab for routine COVID diagnosis. Prior to using the rapid test,

519

the nasopharyngeal swab samples were validated by qRT-PCR using GeneFinderTM COVID-19

520

Plus RealAmp Kit (OSANGHealtcare, Anyang-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea I). The

nasopharyngeal swab specimen retentate was transferred to a collection tube and the rapid antigen

test for SARS-CoV-2 spike detection was inserted into the tube with the retentate and allowed to

529

react for 15 minutes. After processing of the rapid antigen test, the visual positive or negative

530

signal was documented.

531

Both nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs were used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 N and

532

S, respectively. Some studies have shown higher efficacy of nasopharyngeal swabs for PCR tests;

the similar results between our two cohorts are likely due to the different proteins being

Data for Modeling

537

As of August 2020, the United States and Brazil have the highest number of confirmed

538

COVID-19 cases and deaths worldwide, with both countries reporting their first case on 26

539

February 202) 1. Although several affected US regions could have been modeled, we look at data

540

from Massachusetts, New York, and Los Angeles: these regions each contained “hotspots”, or

541

areas of surging COVID-19 cases, at different points in time during the pandemic and have

542

publicly available government-provided surveillance data. Our model is fit using data over 105

543

days beginning on April 1 for Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, and 105 days beginning on April 10 for Fig. 4 (see

544

“Modeling Parameters” in Methods). In order to understand the various testing proposals on a

545

global scale, we performed our clinical study in and expanded the modeling study to Brazil. The

546

specific data we use to fit our model are cumulative confirmed cases, total deaths, and number of

547

daily hospitalizations due to COVID-19. This surveillance data was retrieved from government-

548

provided online databases 62–68.

Equation 1 below provides the exact differential equations governing the model.

552
553

From Table 4 describing each parameter, note that each of their values are the inverse of the

554

average rates at which a transition is made.

555

populations in each state; by the law of large numbers, variance in the time spent in each state is

556

small. For example, the term 𝛼𝐈𝐒 in the top equation is equal to the number of new infection per

557

day as a result of Susceptible/Undetected Infected interactions, where 𝛼 is the rate of infectivity,

558

and 𝜓𝐐𝐔 is equal to the population exiting quarantine per day. The recovery rates in non-

559

hospitalized infected states, 𝜆 and 𝜌, are assumed equal given that we do not possess sufficient

560

quantitative data from the examined outbreaks to infer the point at which an infection is most often

561

diagnosed (if it is diagnosed) or to train a model with separate states corresponding to each day of

562

infectivity. Additionally, no matter which day of the infection a person is diagnosed, they are still

563

required to quarantine for 10 days. This practice of assigning values to parameters is standard in

564

epidemiological modeling 29,69.

Using average rates suffices given the large

565

In order to determine the numerical values of the parameters defining the flows between

566

states, we use a least squares regression to find fits for each seven day interval. All data points

567

within each interval and from each data set are fit collectively within each interval (the resulting

568

fits do not represent the mean of separately calculated fits). This procedure allows the model to

569

take into account the time dependent nature of the parameters, which rely on factors such as social

570

distancing regulations and changes in testing capacity. We also fit window sizes between 1 and

571

21 days and find that while the fit degrades with larger window size, the overall shape of the curves

572

do not change. We choose seven days assuming policy changes take a week to become effective

573

and that reasonably parameters can be expected to change within this time period without causing

574

problems with overfitting. Also, the seven day window size accounts for the fact that often data

575

is not reported as diligently over the weekend. Time series of the values of the parameters for the

576

geographic locations discussed in this paper are included in Supplementary Fig. 5.

577

Given the restrictions on data available for the populations of various states, varying all of

578

the parameters results in an over parameterized system. Therefore, a subset of the model

579

parameters are fit while the others are either extracted from other sources; see Table 4. The fitting

580

procedure minimizes the sum of the squared residuals of the total cases, current daily

581

hospitalizations, cumulative deaths, and percentage of total infected individuals currently

582

hospitalized. The first three are present in the data sets while the latter is derived from the estimates

583

of the ratio between infected undetected to infected detected individuals from the CDC Laboratory

584

Seroprevalence Survey Data

585

individuals developing severe symptoms should remain roughly constant throughout the course of

586

the epidemic in the different locations studied.

. While this ratio changes over time, the percentage of infected

We consider the data sets for outbreaks in MA, NYC, LA, and SJRP, Brazil

62–67

. While

588

each location has testing and fatality information dating back to January, hospitalization data was

589

not included until late March (for NYC and SJRP) and April (for MA and LA). Hence we begin

590

our fitting procedure and testing strategy on 1 April for each of the data sets; by this point, the

591

outbreak is advanced in NYC, substantial in MA, non-negligible, but far from its peak, in LA, and

592

in early stages in SJRP, Brazil. Starting simulations at various stages of the outbreak allows one

593

to see the difference in results between when a testing strategy is administered.

594

In order to determine the effectiveness of the county-based strategy when applied to the

595

state of California, we also fit all of the counties in California with a population greater than 1.5%

596

of that of the entire state and with greater than zero deaths. The results do not depend on these

597

selections, but instead suggest a practical criteria to administer limited resources. The fitting is

598

done starting 10 April for these counties, as at this point the outbreak is sufficiently well-

599

documented in each to successfully model. For the county-level data we compute a seven day

600

running average of each of the data sets to which we then fit in order to smooth out fluctuations in

601

the data, likely due to reporting, which are more significant here than in the other data sets

602

considered, as the county populations are smaller and hence discrepancies impact the smoothness

603

of the data more. The fits for each of the counties can be found in Supplementary Fig. 6.

604

As one can see from Fig. 1, these data sets are particularly not smooth, which indicates

605

inefficiencies in reporting. Additionally, it is difficult to gauge their consistency within the dates

606

provided or to compare between locations, as reporting mechanisms changed over time within the

607

same locations. Despite this lack of consistency, our model and fitting mechanism was successful

608

in reproducing the progress of the outbreak in each data set studied.

𝜂 is the probability that an interaction between an infected person and an uninfected person results in a new
infection, divided by the average number of uninfected people a detected infected person comes into contact
with on a given day. Units: 1/(days ´ people).
𝜂 = 0.01 ⋅ 𝛼
The constant relating 𝜂 , 𝛼 accounts for a small but nonzero transmission due to the quarantined (detected)
infected population. This value was chosen to be small, assuming a quarantined individual will only infect
others with low probability.

𝜈

𝜈is the probability that a symptomatic undetected individual is diagnosed per day.
𝜈 is estimated from the data. 𝜈 is multiplied by sensitivity (assume benchmark
sensitivity 100% for PCR, as used when fitting). Units: 1/days.

𝜖 is the probability that an asymptomatic undetected infected individual is diagnosed on a given day. 𝜖 = 0
while fitting (during PCR symptomatic testing). 𝜖 =(sensitivity/days between tests) when the rapid testing
strategy is activated. Units: 1/days.

𝜆

𝜆 is the probability that an undetected infected individual transitions to the recovered state on a given day. 𝜆 =
1/10, or the inverse of average recovery time 68. Units: 1/days.

𝜇

𝜇 is the probability that an infected individual develops severe symptoms on a

given day and transitions into the hospitalized state. The flow from 𝐷 to 𝐻 is
assumed to be independent of the ratio 𝐼/𝐷, but comes only from the detected
infected population, hence why it is multiplied by (𝐼 + 𝐷)/𝐷. 𝜇 is estimated from
the data. Units: 1/days.
