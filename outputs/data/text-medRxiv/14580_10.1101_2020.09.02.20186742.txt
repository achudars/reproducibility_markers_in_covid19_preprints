Abstract
Objectives: To evaluate the risk of a new wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a setting
with ongoing low transmission, high mobility, and an effective test-and-trace system, under different
assumptions about mask uptake.
Design: We used a stochastic agent-based microsimulation model to create multiple simulations of
possible epidemic trajectories that could eventuate over a five-week period following prolonged low
levels of community transmission.
Setting: We calibrated the model to the epidemiological and policy environment in New South
Wales, Australia, at the end of August 2020.
Participants: None
Intervention: From September 1, 2020, we ran the stochastic model with the same initial conditions
(i.e., those prevailing at August 31, 2020), and analyzed the outputs of the model to determine the
probability of exceeding a given number of new diagnoses and active cases within five weeks, under
three assumptions about future mask usage: a baseline scenario of 30% uptake, a scenario assuming
no mask usage, and a scenario assuming mandatory mask usage with near-universal uptake (95%).
Main outcome measure: Probability of exceeding a given number of new diagnoses and active
cases within five weeks.
Results: The policy environment at the end of August is sufficient to slow the rate of epidemic
growth, but may not stop the epidemic from growing: we estimate a 20% chance that NSW will be
diagnosing at least 50 new cases per day within five weeks from the date of this analysis. Mandatory
mask usage would reduce this to 6-9%.
Conclusions: Mandating the use of masks in community settings would significantly reduce the
risk of epidemic resurgence.

Introduction
There is increasing evidence that localized suppression or even elimination of COVID-19 is possible
with interventions such as physical distancing, lockdowns, travel restrictions, testing, tracing, and
quarantine. This outcome was very likely achieved in several countries, including New Zealand,
Iceland, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam, among others [1]. However, even if the epidemic has been
locally controlled, new outbreaks can emerge if community transmission has not been eliminated
and cases escape detection or quarantine, or if infected people arrive from abroad or interstate and
interact with the local community (as recently seen in cities such as Melbourne and Auckland). In
settings with low numbers of active COVID-19 infections, minimizing the risk of epidemic resurgence
is essential for sustainability. Therefore, it is crucial to identify and quantify strategies to reduce this
risk.
In this paper we focus on New South Wales, Australia’s most populous state with 7.5 million
residents, as an example of a setting with low transmission, high mobility, and a well-functioning
test-and-trace system. After an initial wave of COVID-19 infections in March and subsequent
lockdown in April, New South Wales began relaxing physical lockdown measures over May and was
experiencing near-zero case counts by the start of June, with students back at school, businesses
reopening and social/community activities resuming. In late June several clusters of new infections
were detected, which subsequently led to a two-month long period of low but steady case counts
(between 5-20 newly detected cases per day). This experience contrasts sharply with that of the
neighboring state of Victoria, which had also achieved near-zero case counts by early June but which
then experienced a large second wave, with 14,434 new cases detected between 14 June and 14
August, 90% of which have been traced back to just four index cases [2].
The dynamics of COVID-19 transmission are complex, and in low-transmission settings the
probability of maintaining epidemic control depends on numerous factors outside of policy control,
including the characteristics of people who get infected: the size of their households, the type of work
that they do, and a number of other socio-economic factors that may influence their contact
networks, access to testing and capacity to self-isolate. Several studies have pointed to the role of
superspreading events and overdispersion of infections in COVID-19 transmission [3–4], including
work by our group examining the Seattle epidemic found that infections are overdispersed, with ~60%
of infected people not transmitting at all, while 9% cause half of all onward transmission [5], study
on the role of superspreading events. As a result, even with physical distancing, high levels of testing,
and rapid contact tracing, there is still a non-zero probability that a sustained outbreak could occur
depending on who gets infected and where.
There are numerous non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that jurisdictions can adopt to improve
their resilience to renewed epidemic waves whilst still allowing social and economic activity to
continue. Such NPIs include physical distancing regulations, hygiene protocols, and the use of face
masks, all of which have been recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) [6]. These
NPIs are supported by a growing body of evidence regarding their efficacy in preventing individuallevel COVID-19 transmission [7–11]. However, Australia’s response through to the end of August
focused on the first two measures, with only Victoria having mandated the use of face masks – and
even then only after the second wave of infections was well underway and lockdown measures were
in place – while other jurisdictions have only encouraged mask use in particular settings.

In this work, we assess the likelihood of epidemic rebound following a prolonged period of low, stable
transmission and relatively high community mobility, using a stochastic agent-based mathematical
model of COVID-19. Because the model is stochastic, we can run it multiple times and evaluate the
probability of observing a given outcome among all possible outcomes. We use this feature to
evaluate the probability that New South Wales will experience an epidemic resurgence under
different assumptions about the adoption of masks/face coverings.

Methods
Demographics and networks
We began by simulating a population representative of New South Wales by taking data on the age
and sex composition of the population from the 2016 census (the latest available), and using it to
create a model population of agents with similar characteristics. The simulations consist of 100,000
individual agents, who are dynamically scaled based on prevalence to represent the total New South
Wales population of 7.5 million. The dynamical scaling means that whenever the proportion of
susceptible agents falls below a threshold of 5%, the number of agents in the model is increased;
further implementation details can be found in Section 2.3.6 of Kerr et al [12].
Next, we created contact networks for these agents. The governmental response to COVID-19 in New
South Wales consisted of a set of highly context-specific policies covering individuals, businesses,
schools, and other types of organizations. To model these policies, we allow agents in the model to
interact over five types of contact network: households, schools, workplaces, and static and dynamic
community networks. The static community network consists of interactions with friends,
colleagues, or other known associates who come together on a regular and predictable basis, and
contains four sub-networks: professional sports, community sports/fitness/leisure clubs, places of
worship, and socializing with friends. The dynamic community network consists of interactions in
which people interact with strangers or random groups of people, and contains seven separate subnetworks, representing: (1) arts venues such as museums, galleries, theatres, and cinemas, (2) large
events such as concerts, festivals, sports games, (3) pubs and bars, (4) cafes and restaurants, (5) public
parks and other outdoor settings, (6) public transport, (7) all other community settings. The method
for constructing these networks is described in our previous study of the Victorian epidemic [13] and
is based on the methodology of the SynthPops Python package [14].

Disease transmission model
We used an agent-based microsimulation model, Covasim [12], developed by the Institute for
Disease Modeling and previously adapted by our group to model the Victorian epidemic [13].
Covasim contains detailed descriptions of age-dependent disease acquisition and progression
probabilities, duration of disease by acuity, and the effects of interventions including symptomatic
and asymptomatic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine, as well as other NPIs such as
physical distancing, hygiene measures, and protective equipment such as masks. Importantly, it also
captures individual variability, with viral loads varying both between individuals and over time.

Modeling interventions and policy restrictions
Throughout March, the policy response to COVID-19 in New South Wales progressed from
guidelines encouraging precautionary handwashing and distancing to a much more restrictive
“lockdown” phase, in which people were only allowed to leave their houses for a limited number of
reasons. This phase was maintained throughout April and then gradually eased over May–July.

Figure 1 presents a summary of how contact networks and the relative risk of COVID-19 transmission
in different settings changed as policies evolved. Some of these changes in transmission risk are
derived from available data [15], while others are taken from a similar modeling exercise conducted
in Victoria, in which a panel of Australia-based experts reviewed the likely effect of policies on
transmission risks [13]. Further details of all policies and how we model their effects on transmission
risk are contained in Supplementary Table 1. Most relevantly for our subsequent analyses, we assume
that the proportion of New South Wales residents who wore masks in dynamic community settings
increased over August to reach 30% by the end of the month.

Figure 1. Relative changes in network structure and transmission risk across different settings in
New South Wales over March–August. The absolute transmission risk varies by setting and is highest
in household and lowest in outdoor settings (see [13] for details).

Data and calibration
We initialized the model on March 1, 2020 by seeding 100 infections in the model population, with
the number of seed infections chosen as part of the calibration process. The model was calibrated to
data on (1) the number of tests conducted and (2) the daily number of cases diagnosed in NSW,
excluding cases acquired overseas, by performing an automated search for the values of the percontact transmission risk and the number of seed infections that minimized the absolute differences
between the model projections and the data. We repeated the initialization 100 times, each time with
a different set of 100 people infected at the beginning of the simulation.
Figure 2 displays the outcome of this, with the model capturing the initial outbreak, the decline in
cases following the April lockdown, and then the gradual increase in June/July as policies eased, new
cases arrived from interstate, and new clusters began to form. By the end of August, we estimate just
over 500 active infections in New South Wales.

model projections over 100 model runs; shaded areas indicate 95% projected intervals over different
initializations; blue diamonds indicate data on confirmed locally-acquired cases.

Model analyses
We use the model to investigate the probability of a setting with low transmission and high mobility
experiencing a resurgence in cases, grounding the analysis based on the policy settings and epidemic
state of New South Wales at the end of August. To calculate this probability, we reinitialize the model
on August 31, 2020 and project forward by five weeks using the parameter values obtained via the
calibration process, and beginning with the estimated epidemic state on August 31, 2020. We repeat
this 100 times, with each iteration representing a different realization of the possible future
transmission dynamics. We then calculate the proportion of simulations in which the number of
cases being diagnosed per day exceeds different thresholds within five weeks.
As a baseline, we assume that the policy and behavioral settings in place at the end of August
continue, including the assumption that 30% of adults wear masks while at work and when
participating in community-based activities along with strangers or random groups of people. We
then model two alternative scenarios:
1. No mask scenario: assuming negligible mask use;
2. Near-universal mask uptake: assuming that 95% of the adult population wear masks while
at work and when participating in community-based activities along with strangers or
random groups of people.
The individual-level effectiveness of masks at reducing COVID-19 transmission is difficult to
determine, and will be influenced by the level of restrictions or NPIs already in place. A
comprehensive meta-analysis covering 41 studies of mask effectiveness concluded that masks are
associated with a reduction in infection for mask-wearers by at least one-third compared to control
groups [16]. We assume that masks will reduce the per-contact probability of transmission by an
additional 20% relative to a baseline in which other NPIs are in place. We also conduct a sensitivity
analysis in which the individual-level effectiveness of masks is assumed to be 30%.

Results
Beginning from a point with ongoing low levels of community transmission, high mobility, and with
30% of adults wearing masks at work and in settings with unknown groups of people, we estimate
that there is a 20% chance that transmission will increase to at least 50 new cases per day within five
weeks (Figure 3). If masks were not worn, the probability would increase to 25%, indicating that the

current level of mask usage does not have a great impact on containing the probability of a resurgent
epidemic. However, we find that under the near-universal mask uptake scenario, the probability of
diagnosing more than 50 cases per day within five weeks would fall to 8% (Figure 3A). Furthermore,
we estimate that the total number of infections over the next five weeks would be 20% lower than
under a scenario in which masks are not used, largely driven by a 37% reduction in infections
transmitted in dynamic community settings (Figure 3C). Under all scenarios, we estimate that the
median number of daily infections is likely to continue to gradually increase (Figure 3D).

exceeding a given number of daily new diagnoses within five weeks; (B) the probability of exceeding
a given number of active infections within five weeks; (C) cumulative infections in different contexts
(colored bars indicate median, black error bars indicate 95% projected intervals), showing that the
use of masks leads to a first-order reduction on transmissions in dynamic community contact
networks; (D) daily estimates of the number of new infections at the end of each week under the
three mask scenarios (dots indicate median, colored bars indicate 95% projected interval).
We also conducted a sensitivity analysis in which individual-level mask effectiveness was assumed
to be 30%. Under this scenario, we estimate an 18% probability of diagnosing more than 50 new cases
per day within five weeks if mask uptake does not change, or 6% under the high mask scenario.
Overall infections over the next five weeks would be 30% lower if masks were adopted with high
uptake (Figure S1).

Discussion
Evidence from numerous other settings has shown that as long as the population remains susceptible
to COVID-19 infection, reopening society is likely to lead to new epidemic waves unless a welloperating test-and-trace strategy is in place [5], [17]–[19]. In this work, we examined a lowtransmission, high mobility setting with limited mask usage, and found that high levels of testing
and contact tracing have thus far succeeded in controlling the epidemic, but do not eliminate the
risk of an epidemic resurgence. At the time of writing, case numbers in New South Wales had

decreased from ~15/day over July to <5/day by the end of August, which may indicate that test-andtrace efforts in this instance were sufficient to curtail the risk of epidemic resurgence. However, our
main finding does not depend on the exact date of the analysis; as long as viral transmission remains
in the community, the probability of epidemic resurgence (e.g., an untraceable cluster, a failure of
quarantine, or a superspreading event) remains.
We found that the use of masks would reduce the probability of epidemic resurgence in New South
Wales: if the use of masks was mandated in New South Wales, we estimate that the probability of
diagnosing at least 50 new cases per day within five weeks would reduce from 20% to 9%. Given that
masks are an intervention with low social and economic costs, and containing an epidemic
resurgence is extremely disruptive and costly (with Treasury estimates suggesting that Victoria’s
Stage 4 restrictions will result in an AU$7-9 billion reduction to national GDP in the September
quarter [20]), this reduction in risk is of major significance and suggests that a policy of mandatory
mask use is likely to have an extremely high benefit-to-cost ratio.
This study adds to a sizable body of evidence supporting the adoption of face masks as a low-cost
means of protecting individuals from acquiring COVID-19 [7], [8], [10], [21]. Modeling studies have
shown that the population-level effects of masks depend on the state of the epidemic. A study from
Israel showed that masks are particularly effective when the effective R is close to 1, and can
determine whether a low-level epidemic tips into an outbreak or not [22]. In higher transmission
settings where the effective R is greater than 1, two studies found that masks are most effective when
used in conjunction with a collection of other NPIs [9], [23]. To our knowledge, no studies to date
have examined the extent to which face masks can prevent a resurgent outbreak in low-transmission
settings. Furthermore, by using a model that already incorporated the numerous other COVID-19
control measures in place in New South Wales, we illustrate that face masks have benefit even in the
context of a well-functioning test-and-trace system.
There are several limitations to this study. Firstly, the mathematical model that we use is subject to
the usual limitations of mathematical models, including uncertainty around the parameters that
characterize COVID-19 transmission and disease progression, uncertainty around the impact of
interventions and behavioral changes, and reliance on data sources (such as the number of COVID19 cases by likely source) that may be incomplete and/or subject to revision. To the extent possible,
we managed these issues by sampling parameters from probability distributions and conducting
sensitivity analyses around the efficacy of masks. Secondly, we made assumptions about the
proportion of contacts of diagnosed cases that can be traced within a certain number of days; further
data on these proportions would greatly improve model estimates. Thirdly, our analyses assume that
the policy environment in New South Wales would be relatively slow to react to an increase in case
numbers; we focused on the question of quantifying the likelihood of diagnosing more than 50
cases/day on the assumption that this would equate to a high likelihood that New South Wales
would enter a more restrictive phase of lockdown, but a faster policy reaction, as recently seen in
Auckland, would change the nature of the results seen here.
Our work suggests that adoption of face masks by the general public could substantially reduce the
risk of new epidemic waves. Given that individuals are already requested to isolate if they have been
diagnosed with COVID-19 or are displaying symptoms, a major benefit of masks is in controlling
asymptomatic transmission, which is estimated to make up approximately one third of all
transmissions. The use of masks also has a role in reinforcing the importance of other NPIs. Not only
does this have positive health outcomes in terms of reducing the number of COVID-19 infections

and associated mortality, but it also has clear social and economic benefits by mitigating the need
for more extreme lockdown measures that are required to curtail epidemic resurgences once they
have begun.

Description of policy changes and their effects

Schools

School attendance rates in NSW had already dropped by 25% by 15 March
2020 [1], and on 23 March 2020 the NSW Premier advised that although
schools remained open, parents were encouraged to keep their children at
home for online learning [2]. School attendance rates subsequently
dropped to 5% of their pre-COVID levels [3]. However, attendance quickly
returned to pre-COVID levels shortly after schools reopened in mid-May
[4]. To model this, we removed 95% of contacts between school children
and then restored them again as schools opened, but with the relative
transmission risk set to 80% of its pre-March levels to account for
additional safety measures in place for school activities [5] (Figure 1).

Workplaces

According to survey data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, almost
half of working Australians were working from home in late April/early
May [6], which is roughly consistent with Google movement data
indicating that 40% fewer people were at work over that period compared
to baseline. Workplace-based activities increased as COVID restrictions
eased, but remained 15% lower over June-July compared to baseline. In the
model, we removed 50% of workplace contacts and then restored them so
that the workplace network was back to 85% of its pre-COVID size by the
beginning of July (Figure 1). As with schools, we set the relative
transmission risk set to 80% of its pre-March levels to account for the
presence of NPIs.

Static community

We assume that almost no contacts occurred over these networks from
March 23 to May 1 with the exception of the limited contacts arising from
permitted single-person visits., These networks were gradually restored
over the period from May 1 to July 9 as restrictions eased (Figure 1).

Dynamic community
networks over MayJuly (negligible mask
usage)

Within New South Wales, arts venues such as museums, galleries,
theatres, and cinemas, large events such as concerts, festivals, sports
games, and pubs/bars were all closed over the period from March 23 to
May 15, after which the networks were gradually restored (Figure 1). Cafes
and restaurants, public parks and other outdoor settings, public transport,
and all other community settings including essential retail remained open
in some capacity throughout the year but with decreased demand and
operational restrictions to reduce the likelihood of transmission (e.g.,
takeaway service only, closure of playgrounds, capacity limits on
transport, and physical distancing/hygiene).

Dynamic community From August 3, 2020, the use of masks was mandated in Victoria, which
networks
over led to a marked increase in mask usage across the country. Only 13% of
Australians wore a mask at least once over the month of June, but 58%

August
(increased reported wearing one at least once over August 7–17, 2020 (99% of
mask usage)
Victorian residents compared to 44% of residents of other states) [7].
Within New South Wales, media sources reported that 30% of people were
wearing face masks on public transport in central Sydney in mid-August
[8]. To reflect the gradual increase in mask uptake in the model, we adjust
the relative transmission risk assuming that the proportion of adults who
wore masks while at work and in dynamic community settings increased
over August to reach 30% by the end of the month.
Test, trace, and Testing, tracing, and isolation strategies have formed a crucial part of the
isolate strategies
NSW response to COVID-19, with health authorities encouraging anyone
with symptoms (however mild) to get tested. Levels of testing increased
steadily from ~5,000 tests/day in April to ~20,000+/day by July. In keeping
with the increased testing levels, we assume that the daily testing
probability for those with symptoms increased from 5% in April to 15% by
the beginning of June. Assuming a symptomatic period of roughly 10 days,
this implies that the proportion of symptomatic people who get tested
increased from 40% to 80%.
Weekly surveillance reports published by NSW Health detail
comprehensive contact tracing efforts for all newly identified cases [9].
Reflecting this, we assume that household contacts of confirmed cases can
be traced within 1 day of diagnosis, as well as 95% of school-based contacts,
80% of work-based contacts, and 80% of contacts from static community
networks (e.g., people met in social gatherings) within 2 days. Tracing of
dynamic community contacts encountered in locations that require
customer registration is also included: we assume that 25% of contacts
from restaurants, cafes, bars, pubs, sports/leisure/fitness centres, arts
venues, places of worship, and large events can be traced with a 2 week
delay, but only 1% of contacts from other community settings, including
public transport, parks, and retail. In addition to symptom-based testing,
we also assume that ~1% of people who are not symptomatic but have been
told to quarantine as a result of having been in contact with a confirmed
case will get tested.
