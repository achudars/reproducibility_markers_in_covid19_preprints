Abstract

36

The role of environmental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. Particularly the close

37

contact of persons living together or cohabitating in domestic quarantine could result in high

38

risk for exposure to the virus within the households. Therefore, the aim of this study was to

39

investigate the whereabouts of the virus and whether useful precautions to prevent the

40

dissemination can be given.

41

21 households under quarantine conditions were randomly selected for this study. All persons

42

living in each household were recorded in terms of age, sex and time of household quarantine.

43

Throat swabs for analysis were obtained from all adult individuals and most of the children. Air,

44

wastewater samples and surface swabs (commodities) were obtained and analysed by RT-

45

PCR. Positive swabs were cultivated to analyse for viral infectivity.

46

26 of all 43 tested adults (60.47 %) tested positive by RT-PCR. All 15 air samples were PCR-

47

negative. 10 of 66 wastewater samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (15.15 %) as well as 4

48

of 119 object samples (3.36 %). No statistically significant correlation between PCR-positive

environmental samples and the extent of infection spread inside the household could be

50

observed. No infectious virus could be isolated under cell culture conditions.

51

As we cannot rule out transmission through surfaces, hygienic behavioural measures are

52

important in the households of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals to avoid potential

53

transmission through surfaces. The role of the domestic environment, in particular the

54

wastewater load in washbasins and showers, in the transmission of SARS CoV-2 should be

55

further clarified.

Introduction

60

The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most important public health threats to the world since

61

the Spanish flu around 100 years ago. Over 5 million cases and almost 350,000 deaths have

62

been reported so far (WHO, 2020a, data as of 23rd may 2020). Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic

63

challenges the environmental hygiene: special isolation and infectious disease wards have

64

been established in hospitals and healthcare facilities and whole households have been

65

quarantined. Hence, comprehensive monitoring of the environment of healthcare facilities and

66

households during pandemic outbreaks are vital parts to ensure patients’ safety and public

67

health (Liu et al., 2020).

68

COVID-19 is a disease of the upper airways (Schmithausen et al., 2020). It has been shown

69

for SARS-CoV-2 that droplets (particles > 5 µm) can deposit on mucous surfaces of the upper

70

respiratory tract and be spread when coughing, sneezing or speaking (Anfinrud et al., 2020; Li

71

et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020) Thus, the main airborne transmission pathway of infectious SARS-

72

CoV-2 is aerosol (particles <5 µm) or droplets (van Doremalen et al., 2020). This is particularly

73

important regarding indoor environments, because small particles with a higher viral load may

74

be carried over distances up to 10 m from the emission source and may even accumulate

75

(Morawska and Cao, 2020; Paules et al., 2020). However, these findings are based on

76

laboratory experiments. One of a few on-field outbreaks studies on environmental transmission

77

dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 was performed by Xu et al. (2020) on a cruise ship with a total of

78

3,711 passengers. Xu et al. (2020) rebutted that long-range airborne transmission routes and

79

even central air conditioning systems play a role in a COVID-19 outbreak in a confined space.

80

On the other hand it can be assumed that close contact and fomites contribute to transmission

81

effects (ECDC, 2020; WHO, 2020a). Chan et al. (2020) proofed person-to-person transmission

82

in hospital and family settings. Currently, only few on-field studies of SARS-CoV-2 detected

83

RNA on door handles and surfaces in hospital and/or confirmed COVID-19 in the patient´s

84

environment, particularly in Asia (Liu et al., 2020). However, the prevalence and potential

85

transmission risks of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment of infected persons of the general

86

population living with their families in households have not yet been sufficiently explored.

87

One important underlying question is whether and how long virus particles can survive on

88

various surfaces to enable human-to-surface-to-human transmission. To date, no case of

89

transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from human to human via food, drinking water or fomites could

90

be demonstrated, although if there is speculation that in the early phase of virus spread in

91

China transmission might be food-borne associated (Jalava, 2020). Modelling also implies that

92

the indirect transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from environment is of little importance (Ferretti et

93

al., 2020). In contrast, recent studies suggested that the environmental stability of the virus on

94

surfaces plays an important role in the transfer (Otter et al., 2016; van Doremalen et al., 2020).

95

Studies also showed that the viable virus remained detectable for hours or even days in the

96

inanimate surroundings like the air, on stainless steel and plastic surfaces (Kampf et al., 2020;

97

Service, 2020) as well as in urine and faeces of formerly positive patients (Holshue et al., 2020;

98

Wang et al., 2020c; Wang et al., 2020b). SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in the stool of

99

one of the first patients in the USA (Holshue et al., 2020). This might be in line with the

100

observation of Wang et al. (2020) and Cheng et al. (2020) describing that at least 2–10% of

101

patients with COVID-19 show gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting

102

(Chen et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a). Schmithausen et al. (2020) described persistent

103

diarrhoea in 32% of tested persons. Following the wastewater pathway, SARS-CoV-2 RNA

104

has already been found in the wastewater of hospitals treating COVID-19 patients (Wang et

105

al., 2020c). In a lab-based experiment, coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) was found to remain

106

infectious for 14 days at 4°C, and for 2 days at 20°C in hospital wastewater (Wang et al., 2005).

107

Yeo et al. (2020) highlight the potential of faecal-oral transmission. Thus, wastewater and

108

sanitation units represent potential infectious sources of SARS-CoV-2 and colonization of the

109

sewage system with microorganisms already starts in the siphons of the washbasins, shower

110

siphons, as well as in the toilets (KRINKO, 2020; Sib et al., 2019). When SARS-CoV-2 infected

111

persons with gastrointestinal symptoms excrete urine and faeces, consequently SARS-CoV-2

112

can be identified in the immediate surroundings like the sanitary facilities. While the elimination

113

of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters is possible after treatment (Holshue et al., 2020; Zhang et al.,

114

2020), the possibility of faecal–oral recirculation of SARS-CoV-2 from siphons of washbasins

115

and showers as well toilets to humans via droplets or aerosols or even smear-infection is still

116

unclear. In order to test this assumption, the study presented here also collected on-field

117

samples of siphons and toilets in private households of COVID-19 infected people.

118

The main exposure to and transmission of the virus occurs at home (Qian et al., 2020), and in

119

cases of mild COVID-19 progression, home care is implemented to avoid hospital overload

120

(WHO, 2020b). Consequently, contact persons of positively tested people are also placed in

121

pre-emptive home isolation before the onset of symptoms due to the risk of contagion (ECDC,

122

2020; WHO, 2020b). As a result, infected people and contact persons living together as a

123

family or in cohabitation are in domestic quarantine with each other. Even with separate

124

bathrooms and bedrooms, it is impossible to effectively and permanently distance oneself and

125

maintain adequate hand hygiene.

126

The aim of this study was to investigate the dissemination of virus in air, wastewater and on

127

items within the domestic environment of family households with at least one SARS-CoV-2

128

positive family member, during a quarantine ordered by the local health department and to give

129

useful recommendations for infection prevention.

130

Material and Methods

131

Sample site and recruitment of households

132

Samples were obtained in a high-prevalence community setting with Germany's first largest

133

high-prevalence cluster with regard to COVID-19 known at that point of time in March 2020

134

(Streeck et al., 2020b; Streeck et al., 2020a). The local health department provided lists of all

135

positively tested inhabitants who had been placed in domestic quarantine at the point of data

136

collection. 21 households, with at least one person tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, were

137

randomly selected from this list. The respective residents were contacted by telephone and

138

informed about the study. All persons and their family members living under one roof agreed

to participate in the study. Complete information from pharyngeal swabs was available for all

140

58 study participants (43 adults, 15 children) living in 21 households.

141

Sampling

142

Age, sex and time of quarantine were recorded for all individuals living in each household.

143

Household was defined as people living together within one flat or one house and having

144

regularly and close contact nearly every day. Throat swabs for virologic diagnostics were

145

obtained from all adults described by Streeck et al. (2020b).

146

As this is an exploratory study, no standardised environmental sampling was carried out.

147

Furthermore, no characterization of cleaning methods or materials was performed. Critical

148

rooms and fomites were identified in each household by two researchers (physicians or

149

virologists or hygienists or public health specialists) in cooperation with the residents. The

150

focus of this study was on the air, wastewater and swab samples of as many different fomites

151

(consumer goods and furnishings) as possible with the WHO “how to” guide as a reference

152

(WHO, 2020c).

153

Air samples were obtained employing cyclone sampling (Verreault et al., 2008) via Coriolis

154

Micro – Air sampler (Bertin Technologies SAS, France). The air collectors were positioned in

155

the middle of the room that was used most frequently by the residents; this was usually the

156

living room or the kitchen - all the rooms had no ventilation equipment. During sampling, close

157

contact to the air sampler (e.g. speaking in a range below 2 metres but not above 3 metres)

158

was avoided. Sampling was performed with 300 litres per minute for 10 minutes in 15 ml of 0.9

159

% NaCl.

160

Wastewater samples were obtained using sterile syringes and catheters to reach the

161

wastewater in the siphons of sinks, showers and toilets in bathrooms. Samples were only taken

162

when the sanitary facilities were shared between the residents. The air and wastewater

163

samples were stored and transported at +4°C.

164

Fomite samples were taken using a swab with a synthetic tip and a plastic shaft

165

(FLOQSwabsTM, Copan, Italy) and added PBS, with 2 ml of 0.9 % NaCl including neutralizing

166

buffer to counteract the effects of any residual disinfectant (WHO, 2020c). The residents

167

identified fomites of frequent and shared use (e.g. door handles, remote control). All laboratory

168

analyses were performed within 48 hours.

169

Laboratory analysis

170

All samples were transported to the virologic laboratory within 6 hours of sampling. Virologic

171

analysis was performed via RT-PCR using the protocol of Corman et al. (2020). Briefly, swab

172

samples were homogenized by short vertexing and 140 µl of the sample were transferred to a

173

sterile 2 ml microcentrifuge tube holding 560 µl AVL buffer (Qiagen). Viral RNA was extracted

174

with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.

175

The RNA was used as template for three real time RT-PCR reactions using SuperScript™III

176

One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum™ TaqDNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher) to amplify

177

sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene (primers E_Sarbeco_F and R, probe E_Sarbeco_P1),

178

the RdRP gene (primers RdRP_SARSr_F, and R, and probe RdRP_SARSr-P2), and an

179

internal control for RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and amplification (innuDETECT

180

Internal Control RNA Assay, Analytik Jena #845-ID-0007100). Samples were considered

181

positive for SARS-CoV-2 if amplification occurred in both virus-specific reactions.

182

The isolation of infectious virus from environmental samples was attempted by seeding Vero

183

E6 cells in 24 well plates or T25 flasks at a density of 70-80 %. Cells were incubated with 200

184

µl (24 well) – 1000 µl (T25 flask) of the sample material supplemented with 1x

185

penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B and incubated for 1 h at 37°C in 5 % CO2. For water

186

samples, 10% (v/v) of inoculation volume was replaced by 10xPBS to obtain a final

187

concentration of 1xPBS. After 1 h of incubation, the inoculum was removed, Dulbecco’s

188

Modified Eagle’s medium (Gibco) with 3 % foetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 1x

189

penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B was added. Cells were incubated over several days at

37°C, 5 % CO2 and observed for development of a cytopathic effect that typically occurs for

191

growth of SARS-CoV-2 on Vero E6 cells.

192

Statistical analysis

193

Statistical analysis was performed via Stata IC 15.1 (StataCorp, USA). An α = 0.05 was

194

considered statistically significant and all tests were 2-tailed. The factors associated with

195

environmental contamination were analysed using nonparametric tests for continuous

196

variables. The χ2-Test or Fisher exact test were used to analyse categorical variables.

200 environmental samples (15 air samples [7.50 %], 66 wastewater samples [33.00 %], 119

object swabs [59.05 %]) from 21 households were included in the analysis. The median

213

number of samples per household was 9 (IQR: 7 – 13, Min: 1, Max: 18). 14 samples (7.00 %)

214

tested positive using RT-PCR. Overall, 14 samples (7.00 %) tested positive. Table 2 shows

215

the number of PCR-positive samples considering the sample type. The observed differences

216

in positivity between the sample types are significant (χ2-Test, p = 0.011). Infectious virus could

244

environmental samples and PCR-positive human samples could be found in this study (χ2-

Discussion

248

The results indicate that at that early time of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak research in Germany the

249

contamination of the domestic environment is negligible during quarantine measured with the

250

current state of the art methods. We could not detect any viral RNA in air samples and only

251

3.36 % of all fomite samples. In contrast, 15.15 % of all wastewater samples were positive for

252

SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which indicates that mouthwash in washbasins, body wash in the shower

253

and faeces in toilets and therefore wastewater could pose a relevant exposure (Wu et al.,

254

2020). Although RT-PCR is a highly sensitive detection method it does not yield information

255

on the infectivity of the virus in these samples. Attempts to isolate virus in cell culture were not

256

successful. Given the rather low cycle threshold (CT) values >30 obtained in the RT-PCR

257

analysis of these samples, the amount of potential virus is estimated to be too low for virus

258

isolation in general. Indeed, virus isolation in cell culture has not been successful in our

259

laboratory at a CT value >30 so far. Furthermore, several wastewater samples had a toxic

260

effect on the cells, which might be linked to detergent residues. It is therefore difficult to give

261

specific hygienic behaviour precautions but rather basic hygiene measures for dissemination

262

prevention (KRINKO, 2020).

263

With regard to the fomite and surface samples, only few positive PCR results were found in

264

this study. This might also be due to methodological problems. On the one hand, the

265

swab/transport solution combinations used could not have been suitable for keeping viral RNA

266

stable until it was analysed in the laboratory. Ideally, object swabs should cover 25 cm2 and

267

be put into 2 ml of viral transport medium including neutralizing buffer to counteract the effects

268

of any residual disinfectant or degrading enzymes (WHO, 2020c). On the other hand, we

269

observed positive PCR results in the throat swabs that were collected by the same

270

swab/transport combinations. Assuming that the results are not methodologically

271

inappropriate, they could indicate that the environmental survival of SARS-CoV-2 may not be

272

too long in the domestic environment. The survival times of SARS-CoV-2 on various dry

273

materials for different periods of time (< 3 hours on printing and tissue papers, < 2 days on

274

wood and clothing, < 4 days on smooth surfaces, < 7 days on steel or plastic) were investigated

275

by (Chin et al., 2020). However, it should be noted that these data were generated under

276

laboratory conditions. It can be assumed that households in quarantine have a cleaning

277

regime, but even under these conditions viral RNA could be found on fomites in the

278

households. A further characterization of different cleaning systems (frequency, cleaning

279

agents, ventilation of rooms, etc.) would be necessary; however, this effect could only be

280

validly estimated in observational studies, since a large bias towards social desirability can be

281

expected in surveys.

282

Following international recommendations, air samples should be taken as swabs of ventilation

283

exits or air purifier ventils (WHO, 2020c). Since this is just a surrogate for real air contamination

284

and normally households in Germany are not equipped with ventilators or air purifiers, cyclone

285

air samplers were used. Cyclone samplers may be less efficient than other sampler types at

286

recovering low concentrations of airborne viruses due to the physical stress caused by

287

centrifugal force (Bourgueil et al., 1992). However, a recent study using a cyclone air collector

288

to investigate air contamination in isolation rooms of a hospital (Chia et al., 2020) showed that

289

2 out of 3 collected samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Further experimental

290

investigations of different air samplers in defined environments and preferably concerning

291

general population households would be necessary to exclude a method-related false low

292

recovery rate. However, these findings suggest that droplet transmission is the main pathway

293

of transmission and that aerosol transmission plays a rather minor role. According to this,

294

droplets and/or aerosols with SARS-CoV-2 in a viable and infectious form can be formed while

295

flushing open toilets without closed lids or arise from contaminated siphons and thus could

296

become a transmission pathway.

297

With regard to the results of the wastewater samples in our study, the percentage of positive

298

samples was lowest in toilets (8.70 %), higher in shower siphons (18.75 %) and highest in

299

washbasin siphons (19.23 %). Although these differences were not found to be significant,

300

they support the above-mentioned hypothesis that aerosolization of viral loaded droplets from

301

these wastewater reservoirs can be possible. Even more, the viral load on the hands and in

302

the throat is highest and viral particles can be released from spitting into the washing basin

303

siphon after teeth brushing or hands washing. The excretion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via faeces

304

and urine has already been described (van Doremalen et al., 2020) and could also lead to an

305

increased detection rate of viral RNA in the shower or toilet.

306

Thus, the wastewater system could serve as a possible surveillance system for the circulation

307

of the virus within several environments (Medema et al., 2020). In general, wastewater requires

308

special hygienic attention, for example with regard to multidrug-resistant bacteria and antibiotic

309

residues (Müller et al., 2018; Sib et al., 2019; Voigt et al., 2020; Voigt et al., 2019), enteric

310

viruses like norovirus or rotavirus (Lodder and Roda Husman, 2005) and coronavirus (Gundy

311

et al., 2009). The enteric transmission of SARS-CoV led to a large outbreak cluster in

312

Hongkong in 2003 (Leung et al., 2003). In addition, enteric dissemination of and exposure to

313

SARS-CoV-2 via wastewater is also considered to be a main risk (Lodder and Roda Husman,

314

2020). Therefore, existing hygiene recommendations (washing hands after contact with

315

wastewater, flushing the toilet with closed lid, avoiding re-contamination of drinking water

316

systems and domestic environment by wastewater) are considered to be necessary to

317

sufficiently control this transmission route. Furthermore, preventive and intervention measures

318

should not start at the wastewater treatment in the treatment plant, but already in the immediate

319

surroundings of the patient, in order to minimize the infection potential.

Conclusions

321

The domestic environment predominantly does not seem to pose a high risk for transmission

322

of SARS-CoV-2. Surfaces in the domestic environment did not show a high contamination rate

323

in this study, whereas the detection of viral RNA in wastewater of washbasins, showers and

324

toilets showed a significantly higher contamination with SARS-CoV-2, indicating a possible

325

reservoir that has not been considered so far. However, further systematic studies with an

326

adapted methodology should be performed to investigate the contamination of the domestic

327

environment and the interactions between humans, animals and the environment.

328

Furthermore, the possibility of transmission via wastewater has hygienic implications for

329

systematic prevention measures especially for areas with poor sanitation (Carducci et al.

330

2020).
