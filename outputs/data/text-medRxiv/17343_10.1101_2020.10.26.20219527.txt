ABSTRACT

Background: New York City (NYC) was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the
United States. On April 17, 2020, the State of New York implemented an Executive Order
that requires all people in New York to wear a face mask or covering in public settings where
social distancing cannot be maintained. It is unclear how this Executive Order has affected
the spread of COVID-19 in NYC.
Methods: A dynamic compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission among NYC
residents was developed to assess the effect of the Executive Order on face mask use on
infections and deaths due to COVID-19 in NYC. Data on daily and cumulative COVID-19
infections and deaths were obtained from the NYC Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene.
Results: The Executive Order on face mask use is estimated to avert 99,517 (95% CIs:
72,723-126,312) COVID-19 infections and 7,978 (5,692-10,265) deaths in NYC. If the
Executive Order was implemented one week earlier (on April 10), the averted infections and
deaths would be 111,475 (81,593-141,356) and 9,017 (6,446-11,589), respectively. If the
Executive Order was implemented two weeks earlier (on April 3 when the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention recommended face mask use), the averted infections and
deaths would be 128,598 (94,373-162,824) and 10,515 (7,540-13,489), respectively.
Conclusions: New York’s Executive Order on face mask use is projected to have
significantly reduced the spread of COVID-19 in NYC. Implementing the Executive Order at
an earlier date would avert even more COVID-19 infections and deaths.

INTRODUCTION
The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease COVID-19) has been
spreading at an alarming rate in the United States (US) and globally.1,2 In the US, New York
City (NYC) was the epicenter of the pandemic and has the highest mortality rate among all
the major cities. As of August 25, 2020, more than 230,000 cases of COVID-19 have been
confirmed in NYC, resulting in over 23,000 deaths.3 As the largest and most densely
populated city in the US, NYC faces incomparable challenges in the social distancing needed
to contain the spread of the virus.4,5

On April 3, 2020, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended
“wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are
difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant
community-based transmission.”6 Although face mask use by the general public has been
recommended in many countries to reduce COVID-19 transmissions,7–9 it was for the first
time being recommended in the US. There is growing evidence that face masks can protect
the wearer from being infected by respiratory diseases or infecting others.10–12 On April 17,
2020, an Executive Order was implemented that requires all residents over age 2 in New
York to wear masks or face coverings when they are in public and social distancing is
impossible.13 However, it is unclear how this Executive Order would affect the spread of
COVID-19 in NYC.

This study aims to use a dynamic compartmental model to estimate the effect of the
Executive Order on face mask use on COVID-19 infections and deaths. We used COVID-19
data in NYC and the best available evidence to inform model parameters. We estimated the
averted numbers of infections and deaths due to the Executive Order on face mask use. We
also studied what would happen if the Executive Order was implemented earlier. Findings
from this study will provide policymakers with important information on the effect of face
mask related policies in NYC and other parts of the US.

METHODS
Data sources
We obtained the NYC COVID-19 data from the NYC Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene (DOHMH).3 Our data included the number of daily and cumulative confirmed cases
and deaths from February 29 to June 7, 2020 (Table S1). We intentionally chose the last day

of evaluation to be June 7, a day before NYC initiated its first phase of reopening, as social
distancing is likely to change after June 7. We estimated the disease progression and
individual behavioral parameters from the literature (Table S2).

Model formulation and assumptions
We developed a dynamic compartmental model to describe the transmission of COVID-19 in
NYC. Figure 1 shows the structure of our model. Specifically, the NYC population was
divided into nine compartments, including susceptible individuals (S), latent individuals (E),
asymptomatic infections (A, infected individuals without symptoms), undiagnosed infections
with mild/moderate (I1) and severe/critical symptoms (I2), diagnosed infections with
mild/moderate (T1) or severe/critical symptoms (T2), recovered (R) and deceased (D) cases.
Susceptible individuals could be infected by contacts with latent, asymptomatic, and
undiagnosed infections with mild/moderate and severe/critical symptoms in public settings
(e.g., public transportation, supermarkets, offices, etc.) and households (home or other private
settings) with a probability ߉ (the force of infection) (a detailed description of ߉ was
provided in the Supplementary Appendix).

Latent individuals progress to the infectious compartment with mild/moderate symptoms or
asymptomatic compartment at a rate k1, and the probability that an individual is asymptomatic
is ߩ. Infectious individuals with mild/moderate and severe/critical symptoms are diagnosed
and treated at the rates ߙଵ and ߙଶ , respectively. We assumed these diagnosed individuals were
isolated strictly and could not further infect others. Undiagnosed and diagnosed
mild/moderate cases progress to the severe/critical stage at the rates ݇ଶ and ݇ଷ , respectively.
Asymptomatic infections and undiagnosed mild/moderate cases are assumed to recover
naturally at the rate ߛ଴ . Diagnosed mild/moderate and severe/critical cases will recover at the
rates ߛଵ and ߛଶ , respectively. Undiagnosed and diagnosed severe/critical cases will die due to
the disease at the rates ߤଵ and ߤଶ , respectively.
The CDC recommended face mask use by the general public on April 3, two weeks before
the Executive Order on face mask use was implemented on April 17 in New York.13 In the
baseline analysis, we assumed that the proportion of face mask use by the general public
increased from 0% on April 3 to 100% on April 17 when the Executive Order was
implemented. While the Executive Order has been enforced to some degree, it is possible that

some people may not follow the order. Thus, we varied the proportion of face mask use in the
sensitivity analysis to examine the robustness of our results with regards to this parameter.
We also assumed that the baseline effectiveness of face mask in preventing COVID-19
infection or infecting others is 85% (95% CI, 66%-93%) based on a recent meta-analysis on
the effectiveness of face masks for COVID-19.12 Since there are a variety of face masks
(from cloth masks to surgical masks), which may increase the uncertainty in face mask
effectiveness, we varied the face mask effectiveness from 0 to 100% in our sensitivity
analysis (Figure 3).

Model calibration
We calibrated the model using data on daily and cumulative confirmed infections and deaths,
and estimated parameters using a nonlinear least-squares method. The unknown parameters
(Table S2) were sampled within their ranges by the Latin hypercube sampling method and
repeated 1,000 times. For every simulation, we calculated the sum of square errors between
the model output and data and selected the top 10% with the least square errors to generate 95%
confidence intervals. The detailed calibration procedure is provided in the Supplementary
Appendix. All analyses and simulations were performed in MATLAB R 2019b.

Construction of scenarios
We constructed four scenarios: (1) the status quo for which the Executive Order on face mask
use was implemented on April 17 (baseline scenario); and three hypothetical scenarios,
including (2) no face mask use; (3) the Executive Order was implemented one week earlier
on April 10; and (4) the Executive Order was implemented two weeks earlier on April 3, the
same day the CDC started recommending face mask use by the general public. We simulated
the epidemic trend of infections and deaths in the above four scenarios and plotted them for
scenario (1) and (2) in Figure 2. We also calculated the number of averted infections and
deaths from February 29 to June 7 for scenarios (1), (3) and (4), compared with scenario (2).

Sensitivity analysis
We performed sensitivity analyses on the effectiveness of face masks and proportion of face
mask use and estimated how they would affect the number of averted infections and deaths.

RESULTS

Under the status quo, the estimated number of COVID-19 infections and deaths from
February 29 to June 7 were 195,617 (95% CIs: 151,580-239,653) and 17,322 (13,14421,501), which were well consistent with reported data, as shown in Figure 2. In the absence
of face mask use, the estimated number of infections and deaths would be 295,134 (224,459365,809) and 25,301 (18,845-31,756), respectively (Table 1), indicating 99,517 (72,723126,312) infections and 7,978 (5,692-10,265) deaths would have been averted through face
mask use.

If the Executive Order was implemented one week earlier on April 10, the estimated number
of infections and deaths were 183,659 (142,710-224,608) and 16,284 (12,389-20,178),
respectively (Table 1), suggesting that 111,475 (81,593-141,356) infections and 9,017
(6,446-11,589) deaths would be averted compared to no face mask use. If the Executive
Order was implemented two weeks earlier on April 3, the same day as the CDC started
recommending face mask use, 128,598 (94,373-162,824) infections and 10,515 (7,54013,489) deaths would have been averted.

The sensitivity analysis (Figure 3) showed that when applied to the status quo, if the
effectiveness of a face mask is 50%, the Executive Order would have averted 73,757 (53,66393,850) infections and 5,852 (4,157-7,547) deaths. Even if the effectiveness of face mask was
as low as 20%, the Executive Order would still avert 37,206 (26,944-47,468) infections and
2,916 (2,062-3,771) deaths. If the effectiveness of a face mask is 50% but the proportion of
fack mask use decreased to 75%, the Executive Order would have averted 60,678 (44,07177,285) infections and 4,792 (3,398-6,186) deaths. If the proportion of fack mask use further
decreased to 50%, the Executive Order would have averted 44,632 (32,346-56,917)
infections and 3,506 (2,481-4,531) deaths. This suggests that even with reduced
effectiveness and use rate, the Executive Order on face mask use would prevent a large
number of COVID-19 infections and deaths.

DISCUSSION
This study assessed the effect of an Executive Order on face mask use on the spread of
COVID-19 in NYC. We estimated that the Executive Order implemented on April 17 would
avert approximately 100,000 infections and 8,000 deaths in NYC, compared with no face
mask use. Findings from our study are consistent with those reported in another recent study
that modelled the impact of face mask use.14 If the Executive Order was implemented a week

earlier, it would avert 10,000 additional infections and 1,000 additional deaths. This powerful
effect would come at a minimal financial cost, particularly compared to some contact
reduction measures such as closing restaurants or other social venues.

Our findings suggest that increasing face mask use would significantly reduce the spread of
COVID-19 in NYC. This finding is consistent with a recent study in Wuhan, China, which
demonstrated that high face mask use was necessary to prevent a second major outbreak in
the city after the lifting of the metropolitan-wide quarantine.15 Face mask use by the general
public is further supported by similar practices in Singapore and Hong Kong where the
governments have required their residents to wear masks in public settings and the changing
position of the World Health Organization and the CDC to recommend mass population use
of face masks.7,9,16–19 More importantly, a large proportion of transmission may occur from
individuals infected by COVID-19 but showing no specific signs of symptoms, and face
mask use by the general public may prevent these asymptomatic individuals from spreading
the virus.20 Ensuring face mask use by the general public is necessary to maximize the
chances of curbing the pandemic and reducing the number of COVID-19 related
hospitalizations and deaths.

Widespread face mask use by the general public faces a number of challenges. First, a change
in perceptions related to face mask use requires time and effort. An online survey conducted
in May, 2020, showed that about 78% of survey participants wore a face mask in public and
participants in those states with an Excecutive Order on face mask use were more likely to
wear face masks.21 This is a substantial improvement from the previous unwillingness and
ambivalence of using a face mask but the usage level is still lower than other countries such
as South Korea (89%).22 Second, there is a face mask shortage in NYC and across the US in
general, which has led to the prioritization of face masks for healthcare workers and those in
direct contact with infected individuals. To cope with the shortage, the CDC has
recommended the use of homemade cloth face coverings in public settings and areas of
significant community-based transmission.6 Although homemade face coverings may not be
as effective as face masks, it will likely still have some effectiveness in transmission
prevention. Our sensitivity analysis showed that even with a 20% efficacy, the Executive
Order on face mask use would still avert about 37,000 infections and 3,000 deaths in NYC.

Our study has several limitations and practical simplifying assumptions. First, we assumed a
homogenous use of face masks among the general population. In reality, people with
symptoms are more likely to wear a face mask, whereas people with no symptoms are less
likely to wear a face mask. Second, the model did not identify people who are specifically at
high-risk, such as people living in a population-dense area and people who are in close
contact with infected individuals. Third, we did not model COVID-19 infections and deaths
across different racial/ethnic groups due to the lack of such granular data over the study
period. Lastly, the effectiveness of face mask varies considerably across different types of
masks. To account for parameter uncertainty, we estimated the effectiveness of face mask
based on a most recent meta-analysis and performed sensitivity analyses on the key model
parameters.12

CONCLUSIONS
Our study indicates that the Executive Order on face mask use may play an important role in
mitigating the burden of COVID-19 in NYC. The earlier the Executive Order was
implemented, the more infections and deaths would be averted. This will help policymakers
make more informed decisions on whether and when policies on face mask use should be
implemented across the country.

Figure 1. Flow chart of COVID-19 transmission model in New York City. The total
population is divided into nine compartments: susceptible individuals (S), latent individuals
(E), asymptomatic infections (A), undiagnosed infections with mild/moderate (I1) and
severe/critical symptoms (I2), diagnosed infections with mild/moderate (T1) and
severe/critical symptoms (T2), recovered (R) and deceased (D) cases. The force of infection is
denoted as ߉, which involves two transmission patterns: public settings (e.g., public
transportation, supermarkets, offices, etc.) and households. The model includes three control
measures: handwashing, social distancing and face mask use. More details on ߉ are provided
in the Appendix. The average incubation period is 1/k1, and the probability that an individual
is asymptomatic is ߩ. Infectious individuals with mild/moderate and severe/critical symptoms
are diagnosed and treated at the rates ߙଵ and ߙଶ , respectively. We assume these diagnosed
individuals are isolated strictly and could not further infect others. Undiagnosed and
diagnosed mild/moderate cases progress to the severe/critical stage at the rates ݇ଶ and ݇ଷ ,
respectively. Asymptomatic infections and undiagnosed mild/moderate cases are assumed to
recover naturally at the rate ߛ଴ . Diagnosed mild/moderate and severe/critical cases will
recover at the rates ߛଵ and ߛଶ , respectively. Undiagnosed and diagnosed severe/critical cases
will die due to the disease at the rates ߤଵ and ߤଶ , respectively.

Figure 2. Model calibration based on reported confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in New York City. Two scenarios are plotted: (1) the
status quo (blue lines) of Executive Order on face mask use implemented on April 17 after April 3 when the CDC began to recommend face
mask use (baseline scenario); and (2) the hypothetical scenario without face mask use (solid black lines).

Figure 3. Estimated number of averted infections (a) and deaths (b) from February 29 to June
7, 2020, compared with no face mask use, for different effectivenesses and proportions of
face mask use when the Executive Order on face mask use was implemented on April 17 in
New York City.
