Abstract
Background: Studies have already shown that many environmental factors are associated with
COVID-19 incidence. However, none have studied a very large set of socio-economic indicators and
analysed to what extent these factors could highlight populations at high risk for COVID-19. We
propose here a new approach, a socio-economic wide study, to pinpoint subgroups with a high
incidence of COVID-19, and illustrated this approach using hospitalized cases in Paris area.
Methods: We extracted 303 socio-economic indicators from French census data for the 855
residential units in Paris and assessed their association with COVID-19 hospitalization risk. We then
fitted a predictive model using a penalized regression on these indicators to predict the incidence of
patient hospitalization for COVID-19 in Paris.
Findings: The most associated indicator was income, corresponding to the 3rd decile of the
population (OR= 0.11, CI95% [0.05; 0.20]). A model including only income achieves a high
performance in both the training set (AUC=0.78, CI95%: 0.72-0.85) and the test set (AUC=0.79
(CI95%: 0.71-0.87). Overall, the 45% most deprived areas gathered 86% of the areas with a high
incidence of COVID-19 hospitalized cases.
Interpretation: During the first wave of the epidemic, income predicted Paris areas at risk for a high
incidence of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with a high performance. Socio-economic wide
association studies, collecting passively data from hospitalized cases, therefore not necessitating any
effort for health caregivers, is of particular interest in such a period of hospital overcrowding as it

Introduction
The COVID-19 outbreak has been raging worldwide since late 2019, killing thousands and disrupting
health systems with hundreds of hospitalized patients. In France, the peak number of positively
tested patients was reached on the 31st of March, with 7578 new cases, most of which were located
in the eastern part of France and the greater Paris area. Many environmental factors may contribute
to the spread of the outbreak, including population density, pollution, demographics, education and
income (1). Paris, the capital of France, is the largest city in the country, with 2 187 526 inhabitants.
Its density is one of the highest in the world, with 20,754 inhabitants per squared kilometre. By
comparison, New York City, NY, US, and New Delhi, India, have densities of 7,101 and 5,855
inhabitants per squared kilometre, respectively.
Because of the multiple factors influencing the diffusion rate of the virus, the geographical spread is
heterogeneous, with some neighbourhoods having a higher incidence than others. From a public
health perspective, predicting neighbourhoods at high risk of incidence for severe COVID-19
infections is particularly useful to organize targeted actions and to reduce hospital overcrowding and
patient burden in such areas. While clinical factors can easily be retrieved from electronic health
records, socio-economic determinants are not always available but can be gathered from census data
available through patient geolocalization. In most countries, census data enable the assessment of a
large variety of socio-economic indicators at fine geographical levels, and many ecological studies
have already been performed on COVID-19 using these data (2,3). For instance, in patients from the
UK biobank, a striking gradient in COVID−19 hospitalization rates according to the Townsend
Deprivation Index − a composite measure of socio-economic deprivation − and household income
was observed (4). In the US, wide inequities have been shown (5) in COVID-19 positivity and
incidence, with less advantaged neighbourhoods having a higher incidence in Chicago, NYC and
Philadelphia. In the megacity of Chennai (India) (6), spatial risks of COVID-19 were predominantly
concentrated in wards with higher levels of area deprivation, which were mostly located in the
northeast parts of Chennai. The same holds for England and Wales (7). Other indicators among the
many analysed have been shown to be associated with COVID-19 incidence, such as ethnicity (8) and
population density (9).
Previous studies only analysed a few indicators together and showed that most of them were
associated with COVID-19 incidence. A socio-economic environment-wide analysis considering a very
large set of socio-economic indicators would enable a global picture of neighbourhoods at risk. This
data-mining strategy has become common since the first genome-wide association studies (10) and
has been adapted to many kinds of data, such as phenotypes (11) and medications (12). This type of

study would enable the pinpointing of specific environmental characteristics strongly associated with
COVID-19 risk with no a priori hypothesis regarding the type of associated indicator. Using highly
associated characteristics, a predictive model could be inferred to precisely highlight neighbourhoods
at risk for a greater incidence of severe COVID-19.
In this paper, our objective is to perform a socio-economic environment-wide study and to analyse to
what extent a large set of census indicators can predict the incidence of hospitalization for COVID-19
in the Paris area.

Materials and Methods
Our analysis follows recommendations provided by the REporting of studies Conducted using
Observational Routinely-collected health Data (RECORD) Statement. Completed checklist is available
as supplementary material (Table S2). The socio-economic wide association study method presented
here aims at testing the association between a large set of socio-economic indicators from French
census data and COVID-19 hospitalization risk.
Data extraction
The AP-HP is the largest hospital entity in Europe, with 39 hospitals (22,474 beds) mainly located in
the Greater Paris area, with 1.5 M hospitalizations per year (10% of all hospitalizations in France).
Because of the centralized healthcare organization during the COVID epidemic, COVID-infected
patients were mostly hospitalized in AP-HP hospitals, and private clinics were not habilitated to take
charge of COVID patients.
Since 2014, the AP-HP has deployed an analytics platform based on a clinical data repository (CDR),
aggregating day-to-day clinical data from 8.8 million patients captured by clinical databases. An “EDSCOVID” database stemmed from this initiative. The AP-HP COVID database retrieved electronic
health records from all AP-HP facilities and aggregated them into a clinical data warehouse following
the OMOP common data model (13). The clinical data warehouse allows a large set of data to be
retrieved in real time to deeply characterize hospitalized patients, including their residential address.
Using the IRIS Paris division and adopting one-week periods, we aggregated the data for the new
patients who tested positive for COVID-19 in one of the AP-HP facilities and lived in Paris.
IRIS, as defined by the National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE), is the smallest
geographical division in France, with 2000 inhabitants, on average (towns with more than 5000
inhabitants are divided into several IRIS, while smaller towns form one IRIS each). There are two

types of IRIS: business and residential. The homogeneity of each unit is based mainly on habitat type
(residential area, public housing, etc.) Therefore, each French residential IRIS has relatively
homogeneous social characteristics.
New patients who tested positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as being infected by SARS-CoV2, hospitalized in one of the AP-HP hospitals and living in Paris were aggregated at the IRIS Paris
division level to constitute the dataset for this study.
For each of the INSEE residential units, INSEE provides several socio-economic ecological open
datafiles stemming from census data (14). For each IRIS unit, we retrieved all information available as
open data at this IRIS scale: 71 indicators on population demographics and distribution, 51 on
housing, 86 on professional activity, 55 on family types, 19 on education and 21 on income, for a
total of 303 indicators.
Methods
For each Paris IRIS residential unit, we estimated the proportion of patients hospitalized at AP-HP
from the 1st of February until the 4th of June. High- and low-risk IRIS units were defined using the first
decile of this proportion. We then assessed the association of a given socio-economic indicator above
median value with having a high COVID-19 risk for each of the 303 socio-economic indicators using a
chi-square test. This enables an equivalent power when testing the association with each indicator.
This is an important point of the methodology of this study, as it enables us to directly compare the
magnitude of odds ratios for each indicator. P-values for the different performed tests were
represented through a Manhattan plot using the indicator type as the variable group.
We randomly divided the IRIS residential unit into a training (66%) and a test (33%) dataset.
In the training set, we selected for the prediction model all indicators reaching significance at the
0.1% level and having a correlation between each other lower than 80%. To achieve this selection,
we ranked indicators reaching significance at 0.1% from the lower to the higher p-values, and we
withdrew each indicator presenting a correlation larger than 80% with one of the other indicators.
We then performed a multivariate regularized logistic regression using lasso cross-validated penalty,
with the selected indicators as the explaining variable and COVID-19 risk as the variable to explain.
We estimated the prediction performance of the fitted model on the training set by estimating the
area under the curve (AUC). We simplified the full model when relevant: for each included variable in
this model, we also estimated the corresponding AUC and compared it with the AUC of the full
model using the Delong method. For the final model, we then estimated the threshold maximizing
the Youden index and the corresponding sensitivity and specificity.

We applied the final model to the test set and estimated the AUC and the sensitivity and specificity
corresponding to the above estimated Youden index.
To take into account possible spatial autocorrelation, we tested spatial autocorrelation in the final
model residuals using the Moran’s I test.
All analyses were performed using R software with the ggplot, pROC and DHARMa packages.

Results
As of the 3rd of June 2020 (the end of the first wave of the epidemic), 22,132 patients had tested as
positive in one of the AP-HP facilities; among them, 18,634 had their residential address geolocalized
in the Ile-de-France region. Among these 18,634 patients, 7409 had a residential address in Paris, of
whom 6563 patients had an address in one of the 855 Paris residential areas, i.e., with available
census indicators (figure 1). Among these 6563 patients, 3400 patients were hospitalized in one the
the 855 residential areas, with a median number of hospitalized cases per residential areas of 3 cases
(IQR95%: [1; 5]). The first decile of COVID-19 hospitalization rate among Paris residential areas was
equal to 3 per 1000 inhabitants. We dichotomized the Paris residential areas below and above this
threshold.
Many indicators were strongly associated with hospitalization rate (figure 2, table S3), the most
strongly associated indicators being related to income and occupational status. Regarding income,
the most significantly associated indicator was income corresponding to the 3rd decile of the
population (OR= 0.11, CI95% [0.05; 0.20]). Regarding population indicators, the most significantly
associated indicators concerned population activities, with the rate of workers in blue-collar unskilled
occupations being strongly associated with high-risk areas (OR=4.38, CI95% [2.67; 7.51]) and the
highly qualified worker rate being strongly associated with low-risk areas (OR=0.19, CI95% [0.10;
0.31]). Population demographics were much less associated, with the highest association reached by
the rate of women aged between 45 and 59 years (OR=2.17, CI95% [1.40;3.44]). Of note, population
density was not associated, and the immigrant rate was strongly associated (OR=3.20, CI95% [2.01;
5.25]). Regarding population occupational status, the rate of active workers in unskilled occupations
was strongly associated with high-risk areas (OR=5.04, CI95% [3.03; 8.85]), and the active population
rate in the 15-24 year age group was strongly associated with low-risk areas (OR=0.21, CI95% [0.12;
0.35]). Another indicator that was strongly associated with high-risk areas was the unemployment
rate (OR=4.69, CI95% [2.84; 8.14]). Regarding housing, the most strongly associated indicators were
the primary resident rate (OR=5.87, CI95% [3.46;10.61]) and public low-rent housing rate (OR=4.69,

CI95% [2.84; 8.14]). Regarding education, the most associated indicator was the rate of women over
15 years old with no diploma (OR= 5.04, CI95% [3.03;8.85]), and the rate of women with high
education was associated with low-risk areas (OR=0.19, CI95% [0.10; 0.31]). Regarding households,
the two most associated indicators were the rate of household heads with an unskilled occupation
(OR=4.38, CI95% [2.67; 7.51]) and the rate of single-parent families (OR=3.84, CI95% [2.37;6.46]).
Figure 3 represents the gradient of the 3rd decile income of the population area and the
hospitalization rate in Paris. These maps taken together confirm the strong association between
these two variables.
To build a predictive model, Paris residential areas were split into a training set of 570 IRIS residential
areas and a test set of 285 IRIS residential areas. Of the 303 available indicators, 104 were
significantly associated with the hospitalization rate at the 0.1% level, resulting in 29 independent
associated features after removing strongly correlated variables (figure 4). The three independently
associated indicators selected by the regularized multivariate regression are the income
corresponding to the 3rd decile of the population area (adjusted OR= 0.22, CI95% [0.09; 0.52]), the
rate of highly qualified working women (adjusted OR=0.33, CI95% [0.16; 0.70]), and the rate of
women over 15 years old with no diploma (adjusted OR=1.90, CI95% [0.82; 4.43]), leading to an
estimated AUC of 0.77 (CI 95%: 0.75-0.86). We then considered each of these indicators as
continuous. This led to an AUC of 0.80 (CI 95%: 0.73-0.83). When using the Delong test to compare
the multivariate model with these 3 indicators and each indicator taken separately, there was no
significant difference between the full model and the models considering each indicator taken
separately. We therefore end up with a final model containing only the income corresponding to the
3rd decile of the population (AUC=0.78, CI95%: 0.72-0.85). The final model residuals did not show
spatial autocorrelation (Moran’s I test, p=0.66). The corresponding sensitivities and specificities for
the maximal value of the Youden index were 84% (CI95%: 0.73-0.92) and 62% (CI95%: 0.58-0.66) for
a cut-off value of 20,300€, with 43% (CI95%: 0.39-0.47) of residential IRIS areas below this threshold
(table 1). In the test set, the AUC was similar (AUC=0.79 (CI95%: 0.71-0.87), and the 50% most
deprived areas concentrate 90% of the areas with high COVID-19 prevalence.

Discussion
Using a high-dimensional set of socio-economic indicators, we show that many socio-economic
indicators are strongly associated with an area of high incidence of hospitalized patients for COVID19 in Paris, with an odds ratio of magnitude of approximately 5 for indicators measuring deprivation.
As a consequence, several of these indicators, such as income, proportion of the population with no

diploma, and the rate of workers in unskilled occupations, are by themselves highly predictive of
hospitalized case clusters. Overall, the 45% most deprived areas comprised 86% of the areas with a
high incidence of COVID-19 hospitalized cases.
This type of study, collecting passively data from hospitalized cases, therefore not necessitating any
effort for health caregivers, is of particular interest in such a period of hospital overcrowding.
Indeed, it can provide real-time information on populations having high COVID-19 incidence. This
type of study, with nearly no cost, has to be faced to seroprevalence studies deemed to be biased
due to non-respondents, involving huge research efforts and not useable for real-time surveillance.
This study highlights the high pertinence of geographic breakdown at the small IRIS level that is finely
described using census data. This can both preserve patients’ privacy and finely depict patients’
environment. Indeed, geolocalization based on the IRIS area level renders the data anonymous while
being pertinent to describing patients’ socio-economic environment, as attested by the strong value
of the predictive model built using these data.
This study is based on declared residential addresses, which can be different from a patient’s living
residence at the time of hospitalization. Interestingly, 14% of hospitalized patients have their
residential address outside the Ile-de-France region and are therefore located far from Paris.
Although some transfers from remote hospitals occurred during the study period, we cannot exclude
the possibility that some patients were actually living in Paris at the time of their hospitalization. The
same holds for the considered indicators, which were based on census data that might differ during
the study period because a large exodus from Paris was observed when lockdown started: during
lockdown, in addition to the departure of foreign visitors and overseas departments, Paris saw its
current population decrease by 450,000 people (i.e., 20%). Half of this population decline was due to
non-residents of the capital who were able to return home, and the other half was due to Parisians
leaving their city (15).
Only public hospitals were considered for this study. This is unlikely to have introduced a bias
because private facilities were not allowed to take charge of patients affected by COVID-19, with the
exception of non-profit private facilities, in which patients were hospitalized according to the same
financial conditions as public hospitals. Moreover, non-profit private hospitals are distributed evenly
across Paris like public hospitals are.
A significant portion of hospitalized patients came from medical institutions, such as medico-welfare
and long-term care establishments. These patients were not considered in our study, as the vast
majority of these establishments are located in non-residential areas. Considering such patients in

our study would have introduced a bias as the transmission mechanism underlying these cases is
different from the general population.
Notably, we did not include air pollution data because they were not available at the same scale.
Some studies have already shown that air pollution might increase the COVID-19 mortality rate
(16,17), but these studies did not consider socio-economic determinants, while low-income areas are
usually located in more polluted areas (18). In Paris, low-income areas are concentrated near the
Parisian ring road, which is a highly polluted area. Therefore, it would have been interesting to have
these data considered in our model. Moreover, from the map, it can visually be deduced that income
is a more important determinant than ring road proximity.
The predictive value of low-income neighbourhoods on epidemic clusters is high and can be
explained both by factors favouring infection, such as occupational status, and by factors favouring
severe infection in infected patients, such as obesity and hypertension. The subgroup pinpointed as
overrepresented in the high-risk area, i.e., the population with unskilled occupations living in
deprived areas, is not considered to be at high risk of severe COVID-19 because these people are still
active, i.e., below 65 years, and age is the major risk factor for severe COVID-19 infection. However,
they might have a high rate of infection because of their professional status (residence employee,
housekeeper, delivery driver, etc.) involving a large number of professional contacts with the more
vulnerable population. This strong predictive value of income level for areas at high risk has to be
compared with the low level of inequalities in France compared to the level worldwide (19). The
French health care system is ranked among the better regarding waiting times, results, and
generosity (20), which renders these results unexpected. Indeed, many studies have performed
ecological analysis on COVID-19 mortality and hospitalization rates but have not found such a strong
association in other countries, including the US and the United Kingdom, but their study design was
slightly different, with an odds ratio of approximately 3 for poverty in Chicago (21) and of
approximately 2 in England (1), for instance, while odds ratios were as high as 5 in our study.
We did not find any association with population density. The population density in residential areas is
high (37,000 inhabitants per km2 in residential areas), but the interquartile range is also high (from
28,000 to 46,000 inhabitants per km2 in residential areas). Therefore, this lack of association is not
explained by a homogeneous population density. In Paris, population density is not strongly
correlated with population wealth, as opposed to the case in most other large cities, where parts
with high densities correspond to low-income neighbourhoods (21,22). This might explain why
population density was associated with high COVID-19 incidence in other areas but not in Paris.

Moreover, most previous studies focus on COVID-19 incidence, sometimes in relationship with
testing incidence (5). COVID-19 incidence strongly depends on testing policy, which is associated with
socio-economic determinants of the population. Therefore, analysing the association between
COVID-19 incidence and socio-economic determinants is deemed to be biased. This is why we
focused on COVID-19 hospitalized cases, which better reflect epidemic spread because they are less
related to testing policy. This was particularly relevant in this study, as a low-income population
might have difficulties accessing testing facilities (23) because of the testing cost and long working
hours of this population.
This study only includes data from the first wave of the epidemic. Different mechanisms could be at
stake in the future. In Germany, it was shown that different mechanisms were responsible for
epidemic spread at different stages of the epidemic (24). The period analysed in this study
corresponds mostly to lockdown, which has a strong impact on population behaviour in France and
therefore might have led to very specific mechanisms for epidemic spread. Nevertheless, our study
highlighted that the proposed methodology in this paper, a socio-economic wide association study in
hospitalized patients, can provide indirect information on populations having high COVID-19
incidence. It is therefore of utmost importance to organize a real-time follow-up of these socioeconomic indicators for newly hospitalized patients using such an approach.
