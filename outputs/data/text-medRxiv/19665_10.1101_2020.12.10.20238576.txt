ABSTRACT
Background. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is evolving differently in Africa compared to other regions,
with lower transmission and milder clinical presentation. Reasons for this are not fully understood.
Recent data from Eastern and Southern Africa suggest that transmission may be higher than
measured. Detailed epidemiological data in different African settings is urgently needed.
Methods. We calculated cumulative rates of SAR-CoV-2 infections per 1,000 people at risk in The
Gambia (2.42 million individuals) using publicly available data. We evaluated these rates in a cohort
of 1,366 employees working at the MRC Unit The Gambia @LSHTM (MRCG) where systematic
surveillance of symptomatic cases and contact tracing was implemented. Cumulative rates among the
Gambian population were stratified by age groups and, among MRCG staff, by occupational exposure
risk. SARS-CoV-2 testing was conducted on oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal samples with consistent
sampling and laboratory procedures across cohorts.
Findings. By September 2020, 3,579 cases of SARS-CoV-2 and 115 deaths had been identified; with
67% of cases detected in August. Among them, 191 cases were MRCG staff; all of them were
asymptomatic/mild, with no deaths. The cumulative incidence rate for SARS-CoV-2 infection among
MRCG staff (excluding those with occupational exposure risk) was 129 per 1,000, at least 20-fold
higher than the estimations based on diagnosed cases in the adult Gambian population.
Interpretation. Our findings are consistent with recent African sero-prevalence studies reporting high
community transmission of SAR-CoV-2. Enhanced community surveillance is essential to further
understand and predict the future trajectory of the pandemic in Africa.

INTRODUCTION
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spread to six continents (1), with more than 45 million cases and 1.1
million deaths registered by end of October 2020. Even though Africa accounts for 15.6% of the
worldwide population(2), it contributes only 3.9% cases (1.76 million) and 3.6% deaths (42,233) to
the worldwide burden(1). Data suggest that, compared to the rest of the world, the pandemic is
evolving differently in sub-Saharan Africa; the outbreak started later than elsewhere, probably due to
the low intensity of international air traffic (3), and rapid closure of the international borders
following the first few cases.
Importantly, COVID-19 severe disease seems to occur less frequently in Africa than in the rest of the
world (4). Several factors have been proposed to explain this. Age is likely to be a major factor as
older individuals are at higher risk of severe disease. Africa has an extremely young population, with
a median age of 20 years compared to 43 years in Europe, 39 years in North America or 31 years in
South America (5). However, variation of severity with age alone cannot completely explain the
observed differences (4). Underreporting of both clinical cases and deaths due to limited systematic
surveillance and of lack of systematic death registration may underestimate the true burden (4).
Nevertheless, even if this may be true, local health systems, whose capacities to deal with COVID-19
patients are generally lower than in high resourced settings, did not become overwhelmed, even at the
peak of the epidemic (6). Although potential avoidance of medical care during the pandemic as
described in other regions (7) may partly explain the low number of hospitalized patients, the lower
severity reported appears to be genuine and several biological and environmental factors have been
proposed as potential contributing factors, i.e. lower prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, higher
prevalence of helminths infection, higher coverage of BCG vaccination or cross-protection after
infection by human coronavirus (8-10).
Recent sero-surveys conducted in Kenya, Malawi and South Africa showed that community
transmission was several times higher than detected by surveillance, as 5% to 40% of the population
had IgG SAR-CoV-2 antibodies (11-13). Such results highlight the need of robust epidemiological
studies assessing the extent of community transmission in different African regions.
The Gambia is the smallest country in continental mainland Africa and is surrounded by Senegal,
except for its narrow Atlantic coast. Although the first imported case was identified in The Gambia on
March 17th, 2020, by June 30th only 48 additional cases had been detected. Nevertheless, July saw a
rapid increase of cases, with 3,579 cases by the end of September (1). The trajectory of the epidemic
in The Gambia is different from that in Senegal (with a population about 7 times that of The Gambia)
where community transmission was first reported in early April and almost 7,000 cases had been
recorded by end of June (1). The MRC Unit The Gambia at the London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine (MRCG) is a biomedical research institution with 1,336 employees, mostly
Gambians(14). Systematic surveillance and testing of MRCG staff with influenza-like symptoms
together with contact tracing has been implemented during the pandemic, with the first case identified
on July 18th. We have considered MRC staff as a cohort able to provide additional insights into the
nature of the COVID-19 epidemic in The Gambia.

METHODS
The Gambia – The Gambia has an estimated population of 2.42 million in 2020, with a median age of
17.8 years. Around 41.9% of the population are between 20 and 64 years-of-age. About 95% of the
population is Muslim and illiteracy rate is high across the country. Around 59% of the population live
in urban and peri-urban settings, mainly at the coast (Figure 1). The climate is typical of the subSahel region, with a long dry season from November to May and a short rainy season between June
and October. Maximum temperature is high throughout the year (between 300C and 340C; lowest

during the rainy season) while minimum temperature increases during the rainy season (160C -200C
during the dry season and 220C -240C during the rainy season) (15). Humidity can surpass 80% during
the rainy months (16).
The government of The Gambia is the main health provider and health care delivery has three tiers,
based on the primary health care strategy. There are four tertiary hospitals, 38 health centers at the
secondary level and 492 health posts at the primary level. The system is complemented by 34 private
and nongovernmental organization (NGO) clinics.
COVID response in The Gambia – Shortly after the first case, the country closed its international
land, sea and air borders (19th March) and soon after (27th March) a state of emergency was declared,
with closure of schools, non-essential shops, places of worship and many working places. Initial SARCoV-2 testing by PCR was focused on the identification of imported cases and the tracing and
isolation of their contacts, especially among travelers from Senegal as the long borders are permeable
with people often living between the two countries. As the epidemic progressed, testing facilities were
established at strategic locations in the most densely populated parts of the country, mainly in the
western urban areas, and individuals were encouraged to present for testing if symptomatic or
following known contact. All identified cases were isolated in designated facilities regardless of
symptoms until considered non-infectious as per WHO guidelines. Contacts were traced and
quarantined in hotels during the early part of the outbreak (April – July), after which self-isolation at
home was allowed.
MRCG Unit – MRCG is a biomedical research institution which also provides outpatient and
inpatient clinical care to the local population through its clinical services department (CSD). The Unit
had 1,336 employees as of August 2020, distributed between the coast (mainly in Fajara, n=845),
Keneba (n=158), Central River Division (mainly Farafenni, n=116) and Upper River Division (mainly
Basse, n=217) (Figure 1). Staff work in different environments, including those that are field-based
(drivers, fieldworkers, nurses, research clinicians [n=715, 53.5%]), office-based (administrative,
operations, data-management, statistics [n=334, 25.0%]), laboratory-based (n=177, 13.2%). A small
number of the MRCG staff provides health care to the general population attending the CSD (n=110,
8.2% of the total MRCG staff).
CSD is one of the two Gambian hospital facilities able to hospitalize severe COVID-19 patients (with
42 beds for COVID-19 patients), both for MRCG staff and the general population. From the start of
the epidemic, all staff were trained to wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) based on
international guidelines.
MRCG staff underwent a clinician-administered risk assessment and those deemed to be at high or
medium risk were advised to work from home and were excluded from high risk clinical areas.
Surveillance and contact tracing among MRCG staff
Since July, MRCG established processes for testing all symptomatic staff (including their families and
contacts) and staff known to have been exposed to confirmed cases. A staff hotline was set up,
manned by doctors, for easy access to this service and for answering any questions or concerns about
symptoms and how to access services. Contacts were called to confirm exposure and then tested 3-5
days after the last exposure. Regardless of a negative test results, all exposed staff were quarantined
for 14 days with staff testing positive isolated in line with WHO recommendations.
Besides the testing described above, CSD staff were offered weekly PCR-based testing irrespective of
symptoms

Nasopharyngeal (NPS) and/or oropharyngeal (OPS) samples were collected with swabs
(FLOQSwabs, COPAN Diagnostics), and placed in single tubes containing universal transport
medium (UTM: COPAN Diagnostics). Samples were delivered to the laboratory within 24 hours.
Sampling methods were comparable across cohorts with similar operational procedures and training.
Laboratory methods for COVID detection
MRCG laboratories collaborated with the Gambian National Public Health Laboratories (NPHL) to
support national testing throughout the country during the epidemic, with the same laboratory
methods and assays.
In anticipation of the spread of the outbreak to the West African subregion, MRCG attended a CDCAfrica regional training workshop on diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus held in February 2020 in
Dakar, Senegal. Thereafter, laboratory protocols for processing and testing suspected coronavirusinfected samples using the WHO guidelines were established in The Gambia (17;18). The same
procedures and assays were transferred to the NPHL.
The standard test for COVID-19 diagnosis in The Gambia is the real-time RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2
specific viral gene sequences. In the early stages of the outbreak, RT-PCR diagnosis was based on the
Berlin Charité Laboratory protocol (19) which targets the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP)
and Envelope protein (E) gene. Subsequently, tests kits, primarily the DAAN and SANSURE kits,
were donated to the NPHL; both target the open reading frame (ORF-1ab) and the nucleocapsid gene
(N) coding regions.
Sample inactivation and downstream RNA extraction was done with commercially available kits
following the manufacturers’ protocol. Initial extractions were manually done with the QIAamp Viral
RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) or the IndiSpin Pathogen Kit (INDICAL BIOSCIENCE). When donations
to the public health system became available, the DAAN and SANSURE kits, (DAAN Gene Co., Ltd
of Sun Yat-sen University; Sansure Biotech Inc Hunan, China) were included. As the outbreak
progressed and daily sample numbers increased, automated RNA extraction system on the QIAcube
HT (QIAGEN) was implemented. In all cases, 200µL of UTM sample was processed and the RNA
eluted in 50µL-80µ depending on the extraction kit. RT-PCR analysis was conducted with 5µL of
extracted RNA in 25µL of reaction mix containing, reaction buffer, one-step reverse transcriptase
enzyme, either the Takara One Step PrimeScript III RT-PCR Kit (TAKARA Bio) or SuperScript III
Platinum™ One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (INVITROGEN, Thermo Fisher Scientific)” and the primer and
probe mix.
Samples were defined as positive if amplification of any viral gene occurred by the 40th cycle and
with all the controls amplifying as appropriate.
Definition of cases – A COVID-19 case was any individual with a positive RT-PCT of SARS-CoV-2
from a NPS/OPS sample irrespective of symptomatology.
Statistical analysis – We calculated cumulative rates per 1,000 individuals at risk. Different rates for
the Gambian population were calculated: (i) entire population, (ii) rates for the population 20-64 year
and, (iii) rates for the population 20-64 years living in major cities and towns (for the latter all clinical
cases aged 20-64 years were considered in the numerator but only the proportion living in major
towns were considered in the denominator; place of residence for the SARS-CoV-2 cases is not
publicly available). For MRCG, rates are reported stratified by occupational clinical exposure (those
working at the CSD versus the rest). In addition to occupational clinical exposure, surveillance for
CSD staff was more intense due to routine testing, irrespective of symptoms or known exposure.
Databases – National Gambian data was extracted from the publicly available John Hopkins
University COVID-19 database(20).

Ethics – National Gambian data was extracted from the publicly available John Hopkins University
COVID-19 database(20). The Gambian Government / MRCG Joint Ethics committee approved the
study (Ref L2020.E37).
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics. Table 1 shows the main epidemiological characteristics of the Gambian
population and the MRCG cohort. In the MRCG cohort, individuals aged >60 years are
underrepresented while urban residents are overrepresented.
Samples tested and positivity rates.
National Data. From the start of the epidemic until Sep 30th, 3,590 out of 17,885 samples tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positivity rate was low before July (1.6%; 40 out of 3,095) and high
from July to September (23.7%; 3,499 out of 14,790) (19;21). Figure 2 shows the daily number of
swabs collected in the country and the positivity rate in August and September 2020, when the
number of samples and positivity rate were highest. During these two months, the number of daily
swabs collected varied between 28 and 524 (median of 184). Positivity rate also varied substantially,
between less than 5% and above 50%. About 67% of the confirmed cases were detected in August
and, overall, 60% were aged less than 40 years(21).
MRCG cohort. Between July and Sep 30th, 191 out of 937 samples collected tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2 (20.4%). Sixty percent of the confirmed cases were detected in August; median age was
36 years.
Rates of infection and deaths
National data. By the end of September, the cumulative rate in the Gambian population was
approximately 1.5 per 1,000, slightly higher for adults 20-65 years - between 3 per 1,000 (overall) and
5 per 1,000 (when considered only adult population living in urban areas) (Figure 3a). During the
same period, 115 COVID-19 deaths were recorded across the country.
MRCG cohort. Stratified analysis shows that rates among CSD staff was 2.6 times higher than non
CSD staff (considered representative of the general population risk) (Figure 3b). By the end of
September, the cumulative risk for non-CSD MRCG staff was approximately 124 per 1,000
population (Figure 3b). All the 191 MRCG confirmed cases were either asymptomatic or with mild
symptoms; with none meeting WHO criteria for moderate or severe pneumonia. There were no
deaths.
DISCUSSION
In The Gambia, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic arrived later than in most countries in the world (in July),
had a short and intense first wave (with 67% of cases occurring in August; with 1 out of 7 of
individuals from our MRCG cohort being infected), and most cases were asymptomatic or mild.
During this peak, positivity rate of SARS-CoV-2 for samples tested was very high at above 20%.
The late start of the epidemic is probably the result of the early closure of national borders, including
for air travel, and of the identification and isolation of infected individuals who continued to enter the
country from Senegal. This was complemented by contact tracing and by the provision by the
provision of facilities for quarantine by the government. The relative impact of these measures,
together with others implemented during the state of emergency, and of behavioral changes (social
distancing, handwashing) is hard to quantify. Nonetheless, they seem to have been key in allowing the
country to prepare its response and minimize potential harm. The sudden increase of cases coincided
with the major Muslim feast of Eid-Ul Adha (locally called Tobaski on 30th July in 2020), during
which traveling and family gatherings were common, although the number of cases had already

started to increase in July. Although climate in The Gambia is hot throughout the year, the peak
epidemic coincided with the months of highest daily humidity and highest minimum temperature but
lowest maximum temperature (15;16). Data on how temperature and humidity affects transmission are
contradictory (22;23). In The Gambia, climate conditions may have had an indirect effect on
transmission as during the rainy season people are more likely to spend time indoors. These are also
the months with highest respiratory virus transmission (24).
Through the systematic testing of the MRCG staff cohort, including of asymptomatic contacts and
mildly symptomatic cases, we are likely to have more robust estimates of the actual rates of SARSCoV-2 infection in The Gambia than that available from the general population. The rate of SARSCoV-2 in non-CSD MRCG staff (124 per 1,000 individuals) was more than 20-fold higher than that
reported for the general population (between ~1.5 and 5 per 1,000 individuals), even within the more
intensely populated coastal area of The Gambia. Assuming that the Gambian urban adult population
had similar exposures and transmission as our MRCG cohort, we would expect at least 75,000
infections in the 20-64 years age group living in main towns (out of the 601,394 individuals). This
estimation contrasts sharply with the 3,579 cases reported during the same period across the country
and in all age groups. Such discrepancy may be partly explained by the high occurrence of
asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections, along with the national testing strategy based on
passive case detection and of targeting symptomatic individuals. Indeed, such differences are
consistent with recent seroprevalence studies from Eastern and Southern Africa that suggest higher
rates of community infection compared to those estimated by passive case surveillance. In South
Africa, three weeks after the COVID-19 peak, 40% of HIV-positive pregnant women had anti-SARSCoV-2 antibodies (12). In Kenya, a retrospective survey of blood donor samples found that 1 in 20
adults had SARS CoV-2 antibodies between April and June 2020 (13). In Malawi, seroprevalence in a
cohort of 500 health care workers sampled between May and June 2020 was 12.3%, concluding that
with the observed prevalence the number of predicted deaths was eight times the number of reported
deaths (11). In a smaller study in Nigeria (n=113), 45% of front line health care workers had SARSCoV-2 antibodies (25). In The Gambia, more than 30% of the CSD staff became infected by 30th
September. Rates among CSD staff were higher than the rest of the MRCG cohort. This probably
reflects a combination of factors: (i) stronger surveillance and (ii) occupational clinical exposure
exacerbated by traveling to work. The weight of each factors is difficult to estimate. However, higher
prevalence among health care workers has been reported in Europe (26).
The common mild disease is also reflected by the low occupancy of our hospital beds reserved for
severe COVID-19 patients. However, this may also indicate avoidance of SARS-CoV-2 testing as a
result of stigmatization (7) as observed in other regions. Indeed, 30% of tests of the 115 counted
deaths were done post-mortem in patients hospitalized in non-COVID-19 health facilities. Without an
official registration system for deaths, the overall toll of COVID-19 associated deaths is difficult to
quantify and the real number may be several times higher.
Using MRCG staff as a cohort to estimate infection rates in the Gambian population has important
limitations. Although cases in the general population and the MRCG cohort showed similar timelines
and the size of the MRCG cohort is relatively large, the MRCG can be considered a cluster. The level
of education and the monthly income of the staff is above that of the general population. MRCG staff
live mainly in urban areas, where transmission tends to be higher (27) but also lives in less crowded
environments, with better access to water and sanitation which would protect them from infection. In
addition, MRCG developed policies and undertook significant levels of staff education related to
COVID-19, reinforced messages related to social distancing, hand washing and the wearing of face
masks at work as well as in the community. Finally, given the nature of the MRCG’s work, the level
of background understanding on infectious diseases, even among staff not directly involved in
research, is likely to be higher than in the general population. Moreover, the robust surveillance
should have further limited transmission due to the rapid identification and isolation of cases. On the

other hand, there was no moderate or severe COVID-19 case among the MRCG staff. This mild
presentation was not modified by treatment as for instance, not a single member of the MRCG staff
met WHO criteria for hospitalization and less so for oxygen supplementation or dexamethasone
treatment. The prevalence of risk factors for severity should be similar between MRCG staff and the
rest of the population except for the lower prevalence of individuals above 60 years of age, a main
risk factor for severity and mortality.
The low (compared to other continents) levels of severe disease observed underlines the importance
of minimizing the potential collateral damage of the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa. Such damage
includes diversion of financial and personnel resources from other services to COVID-19 response,
health seeking behaviour changes, reduced availability of medicines for acute and chronic diseases
and disruptions of routine vaccination services (28-32). The pandemic has also worsened, particularly
in low- and middle-income countries (33), the economic stability of households and lower food
security; mitigating short and mid-term impact should be prioritized.
In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 transmission in The Gambia has, to date, been intense over a short
period of time. Reassuringly, the disease seems less severe than in high-income countries in Europe,
North America and Asia. It is unclear whether a second wave of infection may occur given that the
causes of the sudden increase of cases in July are not clear. We strongly encourage the continuous
protection of health care workers with appropriate PPEs while strengthening surveillance systems
around the country to promptly detect another sudden increase of cases. Country-wide sero-prevalent
surveys are also necessary to understand micro-epidemiology of infection in different age groups and
places. However, engaging with the community to mitigate collateral damage of the pandemic should
take priority. It is also important to investigate the major drivers that shape the epidemic so differently
in Africa than in some high-income regions as this understanding should help in modelling adequate
interventions, both in low- and in high-income countries.
