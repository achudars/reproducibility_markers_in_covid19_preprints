Abstract
The rapid expansion of coronavirus (COVID-19) has been observed in many parts of the world. Many newly
reported cases of this new coronavirus during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history
from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases). For those cases without travel history, the risk of wider
spreads through community contact is even higher. However, most population models assume a homogeneous
infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases
can pose a different risk to community spread.

We have developed an “easy-to-use” mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model
embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported,
secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered. Using the
dynamics of the secondary cases, we are able to determine the probability of community spread.

Using the top 10 visiting cities from Wuhan in China as an example, we first demonstrated that the arrival time
and the dynamics of the outbreaks at these cities can be successfully predicted under the reproductive number
R0 = 2.92 and latent period τ = 5.2 days. Next, we showed that although control measures can gain extra 32.5
and 44.0 days in arrival time through a high intensive border control measure and a shorter time to quarantine
under a low R0 (1.4), if the R0 is higher (2.92), only 10 extra days can be gained for each of the same measures.
This suggests the importance of lowering the incidence at source regions together with infectious disease
control measures in susceptible regions. The study allows us to assess the effects of border control and
quarantine measures on the emergence and the global spread in a fully connected world using the dynamics of
the secondary cases.

Introduction

1

On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was alerted to several cases of pneumonia

2

infections in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China [1]. The cause of the pneumonia was later identified as a

3

novel coronavirus (COVID-19) genetically closely related to the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome virus

4

(MERS-CoV) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus (SARSCoV) [2]. The novel virus was able to

5

establish human-to-human transmission [3] and caused high mortality and morbidity rates. Just after one

6

month, more than a hundred confirmed cases have been reported all over the world outside China, not only in

7

nearby countries like Japan, Korea, Singapore, but also in Europe and the Americas [4]. The WHO has since

8

declared the outbreak an international emergency.

9

During the outbreak emergence, one of the most urgent public health tasks is to prevent the spread of the virus

10

from an epidemic source region to other regions within a country or globally. Because a person who was

11

infected can travel to another region and spread the virus, COVID-19 continued to pose a severe threat to other

12

regions through transportation services. Many newly reported cases of this new coronavirus infection in other

13

cities or countries before community spread have been associated with travel history from an epidemic source

14

region or contact history to people from the region, referred as the imported cases and the secondary cases

15

transmitted from the imported cases respectively. Once the secondary cases continue to transmit to more local

16

cases, infection chain is established in the community, community spread begins subsequently [5].

17

The importance of prediction of infectious diseases based on transportation network information has already

18

been highlighted in many previous studies [6, 7]. The probability of emergence and the arrival time of the

19

emergence can be estimated using different approaches through model simulation with intensive computation

20

or analytical expressions based on complex network structure with Poisson processes [8, 9, 10, 11]. However,

21

due to intensive simulation or complex structure, these studies may either provide limited insights into public

22

health or may be difficult to be implemented. A swift response in public health decisions is required for

23

society’s infectious disease emergency preparedness. From infectious disease control perspective, the major

24

questions here are whether we can i) assess the risk for COVID-19 to spread to other cities or countries to cause

25

community spread; and ii) evaluate the effects of infectious disease control by cessation of population

26

movement (e.g., lockdown, border control, or quarantine measures) on the outbreak spreading. Thus, an

27

easy-to-use mathematical formula that can be embedded in a classical meta-population model to evaluate the

28

risk of community spread and the effects of control measures is needed.

29

The increasing number of secondary cases indicate a significant risk of community spread. Using the Severe

Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak as an example, the progression of the SARS outbreak during a

31

given time was generally following this order. First, people migrated from a city with the outbreak. Thus,

32

infected cases arrived in other cities or countries as imported cases; second, the imported cases began to infect

33

those who had very close contacts with them, resulting in secondary cases [12]; third, local transmission began

34

after infections occurred for people without contact history with the imported cases or travel history to the

35

outbreak source [13]. After these processes occurred repeatedly in many regions, SARS eventually spread

36

rapidly throughout the world via air travel. Normally the imported cases can be soon isolated or quarantined

37

due to the strict control policy against COVID-19 spread. However, contact tracing and isolation of cases are

38

more difficult to be performed on secondary cases than imported, especially when R0 is high [14]. To prevent

39

community transmission to happen, early prediction of the cumulative secondary cases generated by the

40

imported cases is extremely critical.

41

Although disease compartment models with meta-population are widely used with migration or transportation

42

data, the complexity of using these models sometimes infuriate infectious disease modelers when an urgent

43

response is needed because most of the meta-population models do not offer a simple way to estimate the

44

dynamics of imported and secondary cases [13, 10]. How to produce the dynamics of these cases in a simple

45

way when the incidence is still increasing at the source remains to be answered. In addition, in order to evaluate

46

the impact of infectious disease control measures on virus spread, there is a need to estimate the probability of

47

emergence and the arrival time of the emergence through secondary infections under different control measures.

48

In this study, we have built a meta-population model based on a classical SIR model coupled with a mobility

49

matrix and mathematical expressions to understand the outbreak spreading dynamics stratified by imported,

50

secondary and other local cases at different cities. We have generate mathematical expressions that can be

51

embedded into the SIR model to estimate the outbreak potential at neighboring cities. These formulas allowed

52

us to calculate the dynamics of the first wave (imported cases) and the second wave of transmission (secondary

53

cases produced by the imported cases). Using the cumulative number of the secondary cases, we thus predicted

54

the probability of outbreak emergence and evaluated border closure and quarantine measures against this

55

nation-wide outbreak spreading. Gain time before outbreak emergence was predicted under different control

56

measures with different R0 settings.

Materials & Methods

Meta-population model

59

Assuming the newly emergence of COVID-19 causes an outbreak at location i, during the emergence, the

60

changes of the numbers of infectious cases Ij at a different location j can be determined using a simple

61

Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered (SIR) meta-population model with a mobility matrix (contact mixing at

62

the population level):

R0 is the basic reproductive number, Tg

65

is the generation time, Mii is the human mobility rate within the source location i, Mji is the mobility rate from

66

i to j, and Ij is the number of infected individuals at the location j. Our aim was to develop a meta-population

67

model embedded with analytical expressions that can stratify the imported cases and the secondary cases

68

produced by the imported cases along with other infected individuals with border control and quarantine

69

measures. We modified this simple meta-population model by introducing the effect of border control and the

70

quarantine. The mobility rate was multiplied by (1 − c), where c represents a border control measure. When c

71

is higher up to 1, the mobility rate is reduced to zero. The infected cases were quarantined on average Tqr days

72

after they are transmitted. After derivation (steps are described in later sections), the final model became:

and quarantine measures. The term η(k = 0, .) calculated the changes during first wave transmission (imported)

80

and η(k = 1, .) calculated the changes during second wave transmission (secondary infected cases produced by

81

the imported cases) under quarantine. The dot in η(k = 0, .) represents other epidemiological parameters.

82

During the early outbreak phase, because the susceptible population S was so close to the population size N ,

83

therefore, we assumed

S
N

≈ 1. Because Mii and Mjj are both near one (every day, more than 99.99% of

84

individuals stay in the same location), we thus ignored the variables Mii and Mjj to increase readability in the

85

remaining sections.

86

Calculating the arrival rate of imported cases

87

In order to calculate the imported cases, we assumed that infected cases could pass the border screening or

88

move to another location only during their latent or incubation periods. We calculated the number of latent

89

cases at time s by including a latent period τ . Therefore, the number of cases Ii in Eq(1) that were within the
R∞
−( 1 + 1 )a
latent period at a specific time s were Ii latent (s) = 0 βIi (s − a)(1 − F (a))da, where F (a) = 1 − e τ Tg

90

91

is the cumulative distribution function of latent cases that were transmitted a days ago but before recovery. The

92

longer a latent period was, the more total imported cases were produced in a given duration. After replacing the

93

number of infected cases by the latent cases, we obtained the rate of imported cases:

94

Imp+ = (1 − c)Mji Ii latent
!
β
(1 − c)Mji I0 eΛt
=
Λ + τ1 + T1g

where Λ is the growth rate and can be calculated as Λ =

R0 −1
Tg .

(7)

If all the infected cases can move to a different

95

place as the latent period τ is quite long enough, the formula is reduced to (1 − c)Mji I(t).

96

Calculating numbers of imported and secondary cases

97

To calculate the number imported (Imp) and secondary cases (Sec), we had the following formulas now:

Because before the outbreak occurred (or before community spread) at a location j, infections only happened

when transmission events occurred between the imported cases and the susceptible individuals at j (we call it

relatively small comparing to the imported and the secondary.

118

Thus, we have a simple formula to predict certain important infection numbers before an outbreak emerges in a

119

specific location using three epidemiological parameters reproductive number, generation time, incubation time

120

and time to disease detection after onset along with a contact matrix. This framework provides a more

121

generalized expression to estimate the cumulative imported cases (first wave of transmission) and the

122

cumulative secondary infected cases generated by the imported cases (second wave of transmission) at

123

connected cities or locations during a certain period of time when the incidence is exponentially increasing at

124

the source.

125

Constructing contact matrix

126

Airline passenger data were collected from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) database. We

127

collected the actual passenger data for top 10 visiting cities leaving from Wuhan Tianhe International Airport

128

before the lockdown of Wuhan city from 30 December to 20 January, 2020. Note that we did not have data for

129

railroad and other forms of transport, and thus made an assumption that the total number of travelers is 4 times

130

higher than that of air transport except for certain cities on Hainan island that have no road connections to

131

Wuhan. We made this assumption because that the number of train passengers is few times higher than that of

132

airline in China [15] and the results from a population migration database suggested a similar ratio [16]. The

133

number of daily passengers between different cities were used to generate the mobility rate Mji between

134

locations i and j. For example, we divided a daily passenger number by total population size in Wuhan to

135

represent the contact rate between Wuhan city and any other connected city j. We denote i = 0 as the index for

136

the source city. Therefore, M00 = 1 is the base level of contact rate within the source city. j is a number to

137

represent the index of the top visiting cities from first to last following the order in the list. Because the

138

estimated number of people leaving from Wuhan to the first visiting city (Beijing) is 10793.5 per day, given that

139

the population size of Wuhan is about 11 million, the daily percentage of people leaving to the 1st visiting city

140

can be approximated to 0.001. Thus, we have M10 = 0.001. We used the same approach to determine Mj0 for

141

j = 2, 3, . . . , 10.

142

Determining outbreak potential

143

Next we considered the outbreak potential, defined as the probability of outbreak emergence given the number

144

of cumulative cases. At the initial stage, if there were n infected individuals, the chance of the viruses to cause

145

an outbreak is pj,n = 1 −

1
Rjn ini

[17]. We determined a critical threshold number ν to be 8 and set pj,ν = 50%

after we compared the trends of the top 10 visiting cities. 50% of the cities demonstrated rapid growth of the

147

numbers of infected cases once the numbers reached or near the threshold. We thus obtained the effective

148

reproductive number Rj

= 1.0905 to represent the transmissibility during the second wave of transmission

149

at location j. Note that this number represents the epidemic growth under control measures before community

150

spread. Rj

ini

indicates the average number of transmissions that are generated from the secondary cases (Sec)

before the community spread. Because the nation-wide alert has already been received at different cities after

152

31 December, 2019, and many infectious disease control measures have been implemented, Rj

153

expected to be lower than R0 . Given the Rj

number, we used the cumulative number of secondary cases

CISec at the location j to calculate the probability of outbreak emergence as pj,CIj = 1 −

(to simplify the

155

notation, the CIj is used to represent CISec ). We defined the critical arrival time such that the probability of

Model of outbreak spreading

159

The cities that most Wuhan citizens moved to in the first month after the outbreak of the COVID-19 was

160

reported in Wuhan posed a higher potential of outbreak emergence. We collected airline passenger data during

161

22 days after outbreak emerged between 30 December to 20 January, before the lockdown of Wuhan was

162

implemented on 23 January, 2020. The daily airline passenger number from Wuhan to the top 10 visiting cities

163

were extracted with the 1779.9 persons on average (Figure 1A). We estimated the total passengers leaving out

164

from Wuhan using a human migration map airline passengers. We obtained the estimated numbers of total

165

passengers given the proportion of airline passenger was about 23% of all transportation in early January [16].

166

An increasing number of the confirmed cases was observed among the top visiting cities, including Beijing,

167

Shanghai, and Guangzhou (Figure 1B).

168

169

The community spread began as the number of the imported cases and the associated secondary cases generated

170

by the imported cases accumulated to a certain number (Figure 2A). Thus, the increasing number of the

171

imported cases can be correlated to the outbreak spreads through the number of departure passenger data. We

172

developed a mathematical framework deriving from a standard meta-population model coupling with a

173

migration matrix and incubation time with different control measures (Figure 2B) to calculate the number of the

174

total imported cases and the cumulative secondary cases.

Outbreak spreads in Mainland China were reconstructed and compared with different transmissibilities and

177

latent periods. We first calculated the cumulative number of secondary infected cases produced by imported

178

cases among top 10 visiting cities from Wuhan under a scenario corresponding to an R0 of 2.92 [18], a

179

generation time of 8.4 days [19], and an incubation time (for defining latent period) of 5.2 days for the outbreak

180

in Wuhan city. The migration matrix M was constructed using the average of the airline passengers data during

181

22 days in January among these cities (materials and methods). The cumulative number of secondary infected

182

individuals generated by the imported cases moving from Wuhan was calculated (Figure 3A). A threshold

183

number of cases ν = 8 was used to indicate a higher than 50% probability of community spread will occur if

184

the cumulative number of secondary cases is over that threshold.

185

186

The arrival times of outbreak emergence (defined as the time to reach above this threshold) for the top 10 cities

187

were between 16 – 20 days (Figure 3A), with the average arrival time 18 days (corresponding to 18 January).

188

On day 28, the secondary cases rise to 139 persons for the top city Beijing, which makes the total number of

189

secondary cases among all the top ten visiting cities to 915.7 persons. The outbreak potentials of the cities were

190

assessed on 18 January. 7 out of 10 cities have a probability of outbreak emergence larger than 50% (Figure 3B

191

and supplementary Figure S8). Among those 7 cities, 5 of them had a high number of actual confirmed cases

192

more than 36 on 28 January (10 days later), only 3 of them maintained low case numbers below 10. Taking into

Figure 3 Outbreak potential estimated from the secondary cases contacted by imported cases. A higher
R0 = 2.92 scenario with incubation time τ = 5.2 days and time to quarantine Tqr = 2 days were used. (A)

account that the actual lag of reporting time was about 10 days, the probability of outbreak emergence on 18

194

January indicates the level of the outbreak potential well (Figure 1B).

195

196

The predicted reporting delay was very close to the actual reporting lag. The average actual lag was calculated

197

to be 10.30 days after counting the difference between the average date of onset peak (among 8 days with

198

highest number of cases) and the average date of diagnosis peak (among 8 days with highest number of cases)

199

shown in the recent report of 72314 cases from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention [20].

200

Note that we did not consider the long tail because no full longitudinal data were available yet. Parameter

201

estimation of lag time using maximum likelihood approach to fit 10 cities together was 10.52 days

202

(10.27-10.78; 95% confidence interval) for incubation time 5.2 days (supplementary Figure S5). Note that

203

when we fitted each city individually, the reporting delay ranges from 8.0 to 18.3 days (supplementary Figure

204

S6), with an average of 12.4 days. When only the top 5 cities with highest confirmed cases are considered, the

205

reporting delay ranges from 8.0 to 11.2 days with an averages at 9.2 days. We did not rule out the possibility

206

that the long delay time, such as 18.3 days, was due to actual delay of the outbreak emergence. Overall, the

207

predicted cumulative number of both imported and secondary cases after adjusted by the reporting lag time of

208

top ten visiting cities demonstrated a similar increasing trend in cumulative numbers of confirmed cases during

each early emergence period (Figure 4 and supplementary Figure S7).

210

211

In contrast, a longer latent period shortened the outbreak arrival time by allowing more secondary cases.

212

Considering the same R0 setting but with incubation time 14 days, on day 28 the total number of secondary

213

cases raised to 1179.8 persons for all the top ten visiting cities in which Beijing contributes 180 persons in the

214

total secondary cases. Therefore, the longer latent period allowed 22% more secondary cases. The arrival time

215

of outbreak emergence were 14-18 days (Figure 5A), which were 2 days earlier than using 5.2 days latent

216

period. On day 18, all top ten cities except Shenyang have outbreak probability more than 50% (Figure 5B).

217

The results confirmed that if latent period is long, more ill people can move to other cities.

218

219

For each of the top ten cities, the arrival times of outbreak emergence for both 5.2 and 14 days latent periods

220

were determined. The actual order of the arrival time for the top 4 cities, including Beijing, Shanghai,

221

Guangzhou and Chengdu were successfully predicted (Table 1). A longer latent period produced a shorter

222

arrival time.

Outbreak spreads with low transmissibility

225

Since R0 of COVID-19 was not fully known yet, we predicted the outbreak spreads using different R0 settings.

226

In most cases, the effective reproductive number R may decrease after many control measures are conducted

227

[13]. Therefore, in addition to R0 = 2.92, we made the same calculation under a low transmission setting with

Figure 5 Outbreak potential estimated from the secondary cases contacted by imported cases. A higher
R0 = 2.92 scenario with incubation time τ = 14 days and time to quarantine Tqr = 2 days were used. (A)
Number of cumulative secondary cases generated by imported cases. The secondary infections are listed among
the top 10 visiting cities from Wuhan. ν = 8 is the critical threshold number; (B) Probability of outbreak
emergence in different cities at critical time (18 days).
R0 = 1.4, which was the lower bound of World Health Organization’s estimate [21] and a medium

229

transmission setting with R0 = 1.68, which was near the lower bound of R0 estimated by the MRC Centre for

230

Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London [22], to evaluate the arrival times of outbreak

231

emergence among the top 10 visiting cities. Under these scenarios, following the suggestion from a recent

232

study [23], we considered the initial infected number as 1000 on 31 December.

233

234

When R0 = 1.4, the cumulative secondary infected number was slowly linearly increasing and the top visiting

235

city had 6.8 cases on 28 January, which was below the critical threshold line ν = 8 (supplementary Figure S2).

236

For each of the top ten cities, the arrival time at which the cumulative number of secondary cases larger than the

237

critical threshold was determined (supplementary Table S1). Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou had the shortest

238

required time periods. However, the arrival times of outbreak emergence in the above cities were between

239

31-34 days, corresponding to the end of January and the early of February, which were about more than 10 days

240

later comparing to the actual reported data (supplementary Table S1). The mean arrival time of the top 10

241

visiting cities was 39 days, which was 21 days later than R0 = 2.92. With R0 = 1.68, the mean arrival time

242

was 26.3 days. Given the reporting delay was about 10 days, we found that R0 = 2.92 with latent period 5.2

243

days gave a better prediction compared to other low R0 or long latent period settings.

245

Impact assessment of border control and quarantine

246

We first evaluated the effects of border control measures by changing the control rate c to reduce the

247

transportation between two cities under three different R0 settings. Border control or other special events, like

248

lunar new year, can affect the traveling rates. Ideally, complete cessation of population movement between

249

cities or isolation of every susceptible case from the source city can reduce transmission events most however it

250

happens rarely. Then the extra arrival gain times of outbreak emergence comparing to a baseline setting using

251

Beijing city were calculated.

252

253

Under a low R0 (1.4), the border control measure that reduced 90% of the passenger numbers gained extra 32.5

254

days of outbreak arrival time (Figure 6A). Under a medium R0 (1.68), we found that the effect of border control

255

was weaker but still created 20.0 extra days under the same control level. However, under the high R0 (2.92),

256

the effect on reducing the chance of outbreak emergence was very low, with only 10 extra days obtained.

257

258

Next, we calculated gain time by time to quarantine under different R0 settings. Under the low R0 (1.4), if the

259

individual was quarantined immediately (happened in one day after the person became infectious), the gain

260

time became as large as 44.0 days (Figure 6B). Under the medium R0 (1.68), we found that the quarantine

261

effect was approximately half of the low R0 scenario (24.1 days) using the same time to quarantine. However,

262

under the high R0 (2.92), the effect of quarantine was much lower, with only 10.0 days was gained.

Discussion

265

The current epidemic marks the third time in 20 years that a member of the family of coronaviruses (CoVs) has

266

caused an epidemic employing its zoonotic potential, for example, from bats [24]. The COVID-19 virus is able

267

to establish between human-to-human transmission [3] and is currently spreading from Wuhan to many nearby

268

cities and countries. It is hypothesized that the rate of transmission between different cities or countries is

269

related to the number of people moving from different locations to Wuhan. About 2 weeks later after 31

270

December, using the number of cases detected outside China, it has been inferred that more than a thousand

271

individuals (with an estimated mean 1723) had had an onset of symptoms by 12 January, 2020 [25].

272

273

The study demonstrated that after reporting delay was estimated, the dynamics of the outbreaks at connected

274

cities can be successfully reconstructed using both the imported and the secondary cases. The result implies

275

that all the connected (direct or indirect) countries are having a great risk of outbreak. The question is about

276

when the outbreak will arrive [26] and how to delay the arrival time to have a better preparation. The challenge,

277

however, is that we lack a simple and accurate tool for assessing outbreak emergence risk and subsequently the

278

required levels of border control and quarantine measures to prevent additional outbreaks.

279

280

Until recently, although some studies have been done to predict the spreading of this new disease using air and

281

other forms of transport information [6, 7, 27, 28, 29], none of studies were designed to estimate the dynamics

282

of the imported and secondary cases. The benefit of stratifying the imported and secondary cases in a disease

283

transmission model is to provide a risk assessment of community spread. Because most of the imported cases

284

can be detected more easily under 14 days quarantine from the passengers coming from the epidemic source

285

region, thus the risk of outbreak is not primarily linked to the number of the imported cases. However,

286

secondary cases, without travel history to the epidemic source region, are more difficult to be identified or

287

quarantined before disease onset and thus are more easily to become undetected cases in a community.

288

289

We evaluated the effectiveness of different infectious disease control on the secondary cases in order to estimate

290

the arrival time of future community spread. Recent studies have shown the importance of modeling in

291

infectious disease control [30]. A recent study has used a modeling approach to forecast the dynamics of

292

outbreak spreading [27]. We developed an “easy-to-use” mathematical formula that are able to have an

293

analytical solution of the first wave transmission (imported cases) and the second wave transmission (secondary

294

cases generated by the imported cases). With these numbers, we are able to evaluate the impact of border

control and quarantine measures. Surprisingly, under the higher R0 setting (2.92), the effect on obtaining 10

296

extra days requires an enhanced border control measure to reduce more than 90% of the passengers or a very

297

efficient quarantine measure. The results suggest that if the epidemic growth at the source location is high, even

298

a near full-scale border control without proper quarantine measure, will have only limited effects. The

299

transmission waves can be treated as a branching process. However, instead of using the offspring variability to

300

estimate the probability of extinction, we adopted a classical way to derive probability of extinction that was

301

based on R0 or effective R.

302

303

We have learnt from the previous SARS outbreak that it is crucial to implement rapid infection control

304

measures to limit the impact of epidemics, both in terms of preventing more casualties and shortening the

305

epidemic period. Delaying the institution of control measures by 1 week would have nearly tripled the epidemic

306

size and would have increased the expected epidemic duration by 4 weeks [31]. Previous study showed that

307

control measures at international cross-borders and screening at borders are influential in mitigating the spread

308

of infectious diseases [32] [33]. Cross-boarder screening system to prevent infectious disease outbreak is

309

important but cannot successfully prevent ill persons during their latent period.

310

311

Full-scale border control measures to prevent the spread of the virus have been discussed in many countries in

312

the world. At the same time, a lockdown of Wuhan city (border control from leaving out) has already been

313

imposed. Here the model we constructed can be used to estimate the dynamics of imported and secondary cases

314

using transportation data with different control measurements. The framework can be extended to multiple

315

infected sources to multiple target cities without increasing the complexity of the computation dramatically.

316

Hence, the model proposed in the current study could provide a risk assessment of COVID-19 global spreading

317

in a highly connected world.
