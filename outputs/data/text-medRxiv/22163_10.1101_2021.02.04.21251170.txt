Abstract
Background The majority of COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic, or minimally symptomatic with
management in the home. Little is known about the frequency of specific symptoms in the
general population, and how symptoms predict the magnitude of antibody response to SARSCoV-2 infection.
Methods We quantified IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain
(RBD) in home-collected dried blood spot samples from 3,365 adults participating in a communitybased seroprevalence study in the city of Chicago, USA, collected between June 24 and
November 11, 2020.
Results 17.8% of the sample was seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. A cluster of symptoms (loss of
sense of smell or taste, fever, shortness of breath, muscle or body aches, cough, fatigue,
diarrhea, headache) was associated with stronger anti-RBD IgG responses among the
seropositives. 39.2% of infections were asymptomatic, and 2 or fewer symptoms were reported
for 66.7% of infections. Total number of symptoms was positively but weakly associated with IgG
response: Median anti-RBD IgG was 0.95 ug/mL for individuals with 3 or more symptoms, in
comparison with 0.61 ug/mL for asymptomatic infections.
Conclusion We document high rates of asymptomatic and mild infection in a large communitybased cohort, and relatively low levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody in the general population
of previously exposed individuals.

Introduction
A consequential feature of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2)—the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)—is that a high proportion of
infections are mild or asymptomatic.(1) The antibody response to COVID-19 is well
characterized, and serological testing can be used to document prior infection by detecting the
presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in blood samples.(2) Furthermore, the magnitude of
antibody response correlates positively with the effectiveness of neutralization activity in virus
challenge tests.(3) Therefore, quantitative assays for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can be used to
detect prior exposure—even in the absence of symptoms or a clinical diagnosis—and may
provide information on the level of protection against future re-infection.
Relatively little is known about the frequency of COVID-19 symptoms in the general
population, and how symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection relate to the magnitude of antibody
response. Using data from a large community-based cohort in Chicago, we analyzed patterns of
symptoms and their association with the magnitude of antibody response using a highly sensitive
and quantitative assay for IgG antibodies against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARSCoV-2. While important insights are gained from clinic-based studies of COVID-19, the majority
of cases are asymptomatic, or minimally symptomatic and requiring only home-based treatment.
A community-based approach allows us to estimate the prevalence of specific symptoms and
their contribution to the development of immunity in the majority of infected persons who do not
require hospitalization. We document high rates of asymptomatic and mild infection, relatively low
levels of antibody response, and a dose-response relationship between flu-like symptoms and the
magnitude of response.

Methods
Study design
The study uses data from Screening for Coronavirus Antibodies in Neighborhoods
(SCAN), a community-based serological study in Chicago. Chicago residents were initially
recruited from 10 zip codes geographically dispersed across the city, with enrollment opened citywide in early September. Participants were also enrolled through the Feinberg School of
Medicine in downtown Chicago. Participants were recruited through social media, email blasts
from community organizations, print flyers, newspaper advertisements, and press coverage of the
study in local media. A web-based, “no contact” research platform asked all participants to fill out
a short questionnaire to determine study eligibility, followed by electronic informed consent and a
longer survey. Upon completing the survey, a kit for collecting a finger stick dried blood spot
(DBS) sample was mailed to the home or picked up at a designated time for onsite medical school
participants. Instructions for self-collection were provided in print, and in an online video, and
samples were mailed to the lab for analysis. All samples were de-identified and all research
activities were implemented under protocols approved by the institutional review board at
Northwestern University (#STU00212457 and #STU00212472).
Measurement of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies
Samples were analyzed for anti-RBD SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies with a quantitative
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) protocol that was previously validated for use with

DBS.(4) The assay is based on a widely used protocol that has received Emergency Use
Authorization from the US FDA,(5) and analysis of matched DBS and serum samples indicates
near perfect agreement in results across the assay range.(4) The protocol uses known
concentrations of a cross-reacting monoclonal antibody (CR3022) against RBD to generate a
calibration curve from which values are calculated for unknowns. Based on prior validation, the
cut-off for defining a sample as seropositive was set at 0.4 µg/mL or higher.
Data analysis
The sample included N=3,365 participants who provided a DBS sample between June 24
and November 11, 2020. Participants were asked to report whether they experienced the
following symptoms of infectious disease potentially indicative of COVID-19 after March 1, 2020:
fever or chills; cough; shortness of breath; sore throat; headache; muscle or body aches; runny
nose; fatigue or excessive sleepiness; diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting; loss of sense of smell or
taste; itchy/red eyes. Other variables included pre-existing medical conditions (chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, obesity (body mass
index >30 kg/m2,(6) smoking, and essential worker status (working outside the home in close
proximity to others since March 1). Participants also indicated sex (based on assignment at birth),
and racial/ethnic identity.
Descriptive statistics and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify patterns of
association with IgG serostatus, and magnitude of IgG response to infection. Due to skew in the
distribution of IgG values, median values are presented and log10 values were used in regression
analyses. Polychoric correlation—which is appropriate for dichotomous ordinal variables—was
used to analyze strength of association between individual symptoms and log IgG response, and
to construct a correlation matrix for factor analysis of patterns of association among symptoms.(7)
All analyses were implemented using Stata/SE, version 15.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Since SCAN initially used a neighborhood-based study design which focused on 10 zip codes in
Chicago, not all observations are independent and the cluster option in Stata was used to
generate robust standard error estimates for multiple regression models, with zip code specified
as the clustering variable.

Results
Mean age of participants was 38.4 years (range: 18-86). 17.8% of the sample was
seropositive for prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Seronegative and seropositive individuals
reported the same overall frequency of symptoms. For both groups, the median number of
symptoms was 2; however, the distributions were not equivalent, with a small upward shift for
seropositive individuals (Wilcoxon rank-sum z=-2.64, p<0.01). Seropositive individuals were
significantly more likely to report headache, fatigue, muscle or body aches, fever, and loss of
sense of smell or taste (Table 1).
Among seropositive participants, median anti-RBD IgG concentration was 0.73 ug/mL
(25 %ile = 0.50, 75th %ile = 1.32). For individuals reporting no symptoms, median IgG
concentration was 0.61 ug/mL (25th %ile = 0.47, 75th %ile = 1.00). Loss of sense of smell or taste,
fever, shortness of breath, muscle or body aches, cough, and fatigue were associated with the
largest antibody response to infection, with median increases that were 1.5 to 2.6 times greater

(Table 1). Sore throat, runny nose, and itchy eyes were associated with the smallest increases in
antibody concentration.
Since infectious symptoms typically do not occur in isolation, we used factor analysis to
identify patterns of clustering among symptoms. The first factor explains a high proportion of
variance (0.874), with heaviest loadings for fatigue, muscle or body aches, fever, cough, and
headache (Table S1). A second factor accounted for a smaller proportion of variance (0.137),
and was comprised of three symptoms: runny nose, sore throat, and itchy eyes. Based on these
results, we created a “cold-like symptoms” variable that summarized the presence of these three
symptoms. We also created a “flu-like symptoms” variable that summarized all other symptoms.
Among seropositive individuals, 39.2% reported no flu-like symptoms of infection, and
34.7% reported neither flu- nor cold-like symptoms. Flu-like symptoms were a strong predictor of
increased antibody response, particularly in the presence of three or more symptoms (Figure 1;
Table S2). Age, sex, race/ethnicity, pre-existing conditions, smoking, and essential worker status
were not significant predictors of the magnitude of antibody response, and their inclusion in the
model did not reduce the association between flu-like symptoms and IgG concentration (Table
S2).
The dose-response association between flu-like symptoms and anti-RBD IgG antibody
response is positive but relatively weak. Further, many asymptomatic infections produced strong
antibody responses, and conversely, many symptomatic infections resulted in relatively weak
antibody responses. The median response for participants with 3 or more flu-like symptoms was
0.95 ug/mL, in comparison with 0.61 ug/mL for those with no symptoms. However, 33.0% of
participants with 3 or more flu-like symptoms had IgG<0.61 ug/mL, while 27.2% of asymptomatic
infections produced IgG>0.95 ug/mL.

Discussion
Symptoms potentially indicative of COVID-19 infection were recognized early in the
pandemic, and symptom reports have been used to identify probable cases, to prioritize access to
diagnostic testing, and to mobilize preventive behaviors like self-isolation and mask wearing. In a
large, community-based serosurvey, we find comparable levels of overall symptom reporting
among seropositive and seronegative individuals since March 1, 2020. However, a subset of flulike symptoms were significantly associated with the likelihood of infection, and with the
magnitude of antibody response following infection.
Most testing for SARS-CoV-2 virus has targeted those with symptoms or recent exposure.
In the absence of community-based screening programs, serological testing is an important tool
for identifying the correlates of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community. In the dense urban
context of Chicago, we find a high prevalence of seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 at 17.8 percent,
and a rate of asymptomatic infection near 40 percent among those with detectable antibody. Two
or fewer symptoms were reported for two-thirds of all seropositives.
More flu-like symptoms predict higher antibody responses, but the magnitude of response
is small in this community-based sample. By comparison, using the same DBS assay applied in
this study, we have reported a median anti-RBD IgG response of 98.5 ug/mL for patients
hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 (8)—more than 10 times greater than the median response

for individuals with 3 or more flu-like symptoms. To the extent that anti-RBD IgG concentrations
are positive predictors of neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2,(3) our findings suggest a
relatively low level of immunity in the general population of previously exposed individuals, the
vast majority of whom experience no or minimal symptoms and do not require hospitalization.
