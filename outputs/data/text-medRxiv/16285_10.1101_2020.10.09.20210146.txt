SARS-CoV-2 waves in Europe:
A 2-stratum SEIRS model solution
Levan Djaparidze (E.E., B.C.S.), Federico Lois (B.C.S.)

Abstract
In order to design actionable SARS-CoV-2 strategies, we extended the SEIRS model to support stratified
isolation levels for healthy <60 and vulnerable individuals. At first, we forced isolation levels to be uniform,
showing that daily deaths curves of all metropolitan areas in the analysis can be fitted using homogeneous
Ro=3.3. In the process, we established the possibility that an extremely short infectiousness period of 2
days coupled with 5 days exposure may be responsible for the multiple deaths valleys observed during the
weeks following lockdowns. Regardless of the infectiousness period, we realized that is possible to infer
non-uniform isolation levels for healthy <60 and vulnerable by forcing the model to match the <60 to >60
age serology ratio reported in seroprevalence studies. Since the serology ratio is more robust than
absolute values, we argue immunity level estimations made in this way (Madrid 41%; Catalonia 23%;
Brussels 49%; and Stockholm 62%) are closer to reality. In locations where we didn’t find reliable serology,
we performed immunity estimations assuming Spain’s serology ratio (Paris: 23%; London: 33%). We predict
that no location can return to normal life without having a second wave (albeit in Stockholm a smaller
one). We searched what isolation values allow to return to normal life in 90 days minimizing final deaths,
shockingly all found isolations for
deaths).

Then,

assuming an

ideal

healthy <60 were negative (i.e. coronavirus parties minimize final
1-day

long vaccination campaign with

a

77% efficacy

vaccine, we

compared predicted final deaths of those 90-day strategies for all possible vaccination dates with a 180day long vaccine waiting strategy that imposes 0.40 mandatory isolation to healthy <60 and results in 0.65
isolation to vulnerable. We found that 180-day of mandatory isolations to healthy <60 (i.e. schools and
workplaces closed) produces more final deaths if the vaccination date is later than (Madrid: Feb 23 2021;
Catalonia: Dec 28 2020; Brussels Apr 25 2021; Paris: Jan 14 2021; London: Jan 22 2021). We also modeled
how average isolation levels change the probability of getting infected for a single individual that isolates
differently than average. That led us to realize disease damages to third parties due to virus spreading can
be calculated and to postulate that an individual has the right to avoid mandatory isolation during
epidemics (SARS-CoV-2 or any other) if these damages can be covered with a novel proposed isolation
exemption insurance policy. As secondary findings in Appendix III we hypothesize that an early D614 like
strain wave might be the cause of low mortality in Asia, and show the negligible reduction of HIT due to
heterogeneity. Finally we conclude that our 2-stratum SEIRS model is suitable to predict SARS-CoV-2
epidemic behavior and can be used to minimize covid-19 disease and isolations related damages. To the
sole effect of understanding and verifying its content the same model used through this paper has been

Early data from South Korea indicated that the infection fatality rate (IFR) is much higher for vulnerable
individuals (i.e. >60 and <60 with underlying diseases) than for healthy <60. This led (5) early in March to
propose a vertical quarantine and eventually a growing number of countries implemented it. But with the
notable exception of Sweden, governments did not take advantage of the fact that IFR for healthy <60 is
not only lower than for vulnerable individuals but, as was pointed out early on by the author of (6), is also
negligible.

The computer epidemiological model of the Imperial College (2) and the IHME tool were initially used to
predict the epidemic behavior but they did not model stratified isolations and suffered skepticism for their
predictions (3)(4).

Sweden’s lead epidemiologist (Dr. Anders Tegnell) designed a strategy that did not impede viral spread
among healthy <60. In theory (sustainability aside) the strategy could allow speedily reaching HIT without
infecting as many vulnerable individuals. If successful, it would mean that closing schools and workplaces
not only is economically damaging but also sub-optimal in the sense that it results in a higher death count
since vulnerable individuals cannot sustainably isolate for long periods.

This strategy has been questioned because seroprevalence studies detected only 7% of the population
with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Stockholm (7) similar to the percentages observed in other countries that
implemented stricter lockdowns (e.g. average seroprevalence in Spain was 5%) (8).

Searching for hidden immune response, authors in (15) found that 35% of asymptomatic individuals with
SARS-CoV-2 T cell response did not have detectable antibody titer levels. This means that antibody tests
underestimate

immune

response

seroprevalence,

but

even

using

a

uniform

45%

proportion

of

asymptomatic to correct the underestimation, the average seroprevalence value only increases 18% (i.e.
from 7.0% to 8.3%, still far from HIT). Of course, diminishing titer levels (33) and test sensitivity can explain
low reported serology levels, but why did daily deaths also ease in Madrid? Can it have the same immunity
level as Stockholm?

Even though average serology reported in May were similar, <60 / >60 age serology ratio in Madrid (i.e.
4.78/6.03=0.79) was much lower than in Stockholm (i.e. 6.09/3.58=1.70). This means that proportionally to
<60 individuals, many more >60 individuals were infected in Madrid than in Stockholm. Since the death
count mostly comes from >60, a higher age serology ratio in Stockholm necessarily means higher immunity
level (once death count is adjusted by the population pyramid).

In June, the Public Health Agency of Sweden (9) used a Susceptible->Exposed->Infected->Recovered (SEIR)
model to estimate immunity levels (i.e. total recovered / population). Estimations and predictions for
Stockholm were 13% (May 1st), 19% (July 1st), and 20% (September 1st). Daily reported positive cases
curve fitting was accomplished using a sophisticated time-varying infectivity rate. But as the authors
warned, the model did not have age-stratified isolation levels, and since the serology ratio in Stockholm
was higher than 1 the real immunity level has to have been underestimated.

Also using an SEIR model, authors of (10) were able to successfully fit ICU hospitalizations, but also did it
without modeling stratified isolations. In (11) an n-rank matrix of cross isolations between groups (i.e.
instead the 2-rank used here) was proposed to demonstrate how stratified age isolations could result in
lower death count but they did not test their SIR-like model with real data curves.

A potentially infectivity increasing mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (i.e. G614 variant) was reported in
(37), but even though it seems to be more infective than an earlier D614 variant, no increase in disease

but it will eventually happen and thus it should be modeled.

Vanishing

have

led

authors

in

(12)

to

postulate

Ro

heterogeneity

across

the

population to justify a hypothetical HIT lower than the initial estimation of 70%, thus implying that normal
life can return without reaching 70% immunity level. The proposal is ingenious, but evidence does not
show the heterogeneity impact due to susceptibility that would most likely exist between <60 and >60
individuals. Countries with young populations

(e.g. Brazil) have

had higher (initially unrestricted) Ro

estimations (13) than Europe, although this higher Ro could be the result of an initial lower prevalence of
the less infective D614 strain in Brazil than in Europe. Nevertheless, and even though deaths curves can be
fitted using a homogeneous Ro (e.g. 3.3 implying HIT 70%) and two non-uniform isolation levels (that is:
using

only

effective

temporal

R

heterogeneous

connectivity

in

the

context

of

(12)),

we

modeled

heterogeneity due to non-contagious asymptomatic and lower connectivity, results are shown in Appendix
3: Negligible reduction of HIT due to heterogeneity.

Early cases from South Korea pointed to short-lived immunity and non-negligible re-infection rate, but
after revision, those cases were discarded as re-infections (34). The same report discarded the possibility of
the virus entering cell nucleolus and thus becoming chronic via that mechanism. Eventually new findings
may point to non-negligible probability of re-infection and hence it is worth being modeled (i.e. SEIRS).

With all that in mind, we extended the classic SEIRS model to support stratified isolation but using only two
isolation levels, one for healthy <60 and another for vulnerable (2-stratum). We had the intention to fit
daily deaths curves maintaining virus parameters (e.g. IFR, Ro, exposure, infectiousness, etc.) constant
through all locations and also maintaining isolation values constant during months within each location.
We think that to have credible predictive value, constant for months isolation levels should be able to
average every other second-order influence in the epidemic behavior.

We developed an algorithm that allowed us to easily fit reported daily deaths curves (total, peak, and
shape)

by

automatically

adjusting

isolation

to

vulnerable

and

the

implicit

amount

of

infected

in

a

hypothetical first non-communitarian infection date. A single attempt to fit reported deaths without this
tool is enough to see how handy it is.

Originally we were set to treat isolation to healthy <60 as a plausible value (e.g. “in Stockholm was lower
because schools were open”) but rapid fitting enabled us to realize (eventually) that it was possible to
disambiguate non-uniform isolations by matching the age serology ratio predicted by the model with the
age serology ratio reported in seroprevalence studies.

Almost every other finding in this paper also came from this tool: Immune level estimation sensitivity
analysis (e.g. change Ro and fit); Estimating the spreading day if only one non-communitarian spreader is
assumed (i.e. change initial spreading day until fitted initial spreaders is 1); Finding that Do=2 coupled with
Eo=5 can explain the multiple valleys after lockdowns observed in the 1-day moving average daily death
curves (i.e. fitting a dozen of different pairs of Do and Eo); Include lack of IgG in asymptomatic when

yearly probability of dying for other causes to the predicted sars-cov2 positive deaths and lower IFR_vul
until predicted serology ratio matches again); Estimate the minimum value of IFR_vul to have another
wave in Brussels or the maximum that avoids the low one in Stockholm (i.e. change IFR_vul and fit until the

cause of low mortality in most locations in Asia (i.e. fit with an hypothetical lower IFR_vul competing strain
and then simulate setting the dominant spreading event 60 days earlier); Estimate HIT reduction due to
heterogeneity (i.e. under heterogeneity change Ro until I_dayS value is the same that under homogeneity).

We also developed a death minimizing algorithm with the original intention of testing the general intuition
that not impeding spreading among healthy <60 not only allows returning to normal life earlier but also
can result in lower final deaths. Yet again, the tool led us to unexpected findings: Initial “Back in March
2020” death minimizing strategies included low isolation to healthy <60 (and also would have resulted in
manageable ICU occupancy); After sub-optimal fitted strategies isolation to healthy <60 death minimizing
values are negative (it took us a couple of weeks to let the algorithm search for values lower than 0.00);
When a vaccine with sufficient efficacy is available in the future given a long enough strategy and a high
enough isolation to vulnerable the death minimizing value for healthy <60 is the maximum available (i.e.
the strategy pushes the wave to after the vaccine). That last result was not unexpected but it was revealing
to see how the algorithm changed of strategy if the vaccination date has just one day of difference. That
led us to compare 90-day death minimizing strategies against a tentative 180-day long vaccine waiting
strategy for all possible vaccination dates and found the risk of final deaths increase if vaccination does not
occur before a specific date.

The 2-stratum SEIRS model is an iteration of simple algebraic operations, but its behavior is highly nonlinear and the automatic fitting and death minimizing algorithms proved to be very helpful for modeling
real locations.

As depicted in (14) isolation strategies are not purely age-stratified. In the vulnerable isolation group we
include >60 population (i.e. P_o60 parameter) and also <60 with underlying diseases (i.e. P_vul_u60). And
since a proportion of healthy <60 may not be able to isolate from vulnerable (i.e. P_non_vul_una) they are
also isolated in the same group. Inside the model’s code they are called the “unable” (i.e. unable to isolate
from vulnerable, see Appendix I – SEIRS model with 2-stratum isolation), but through this paper we call
them the

vulnerable

for

short.

Modeling

1-stratum

for

add second-order

predicting value because of the high proportion of young age people living with their <60 parents in the

Daily deaths fitting
We were able to fit all locations to match curve shape, peak (7-day moving average), and total sars-cov2
positive daily reported deaths using uniform isolation parameters (See Table 5). Virus parameters were
common to all locations and also constant during the isolation phase (see Table 1). Location-specific data is
well known and was also constant during the simulation (see Tables 2 and 3). See Appendix II for the
location-specific parameters discussion and Table A.2 for immune level estimation sensitivity analysis.

This

across

can

be

fairly

fitted

with

homogeneous Ro = 3.3 and using only one uniform isolation (ranging from 0.675 in Stockholm to 0.728 in
Catalonia) constant for several months (see 1st isolation duration values in Table 6).

Immunity level estimation
Forcing

disambiguates

the

isolation

levels

for

vulnerable and healthy <60 and changes immunity level estimation (Table 6), but still allows to fit reported
daily deaths (see reported and predicted curves coinciding in Graphics 1.1 to 1.6). We maintain the
immunity levels found in this way are closer to reality.

Now we can answer the initial question, can Madrid have the same immunity level as Stockholm? The
answer is no. Stockholm is closer to HIT than Madrid. And we can also predict that no location can return
to normal life without having a second wave (Graphics 1.1 to 1.6).

We did not find reliable serology ratios prior to July in London and Paris. Instead of using uniform
isolations, we approximated for those locations with the serology ratio reported for Spain (i.e. 0.79). In
tables or graphics where this assumption was deployed we mark the location with an asterisk (*).

Are there other field ratio values

that could be used to disambiguate isolation values? <60 to >60

confirmed case ratio (e.g. PCR) cannot be matched to <60 to >60 infections ratio produced by the model
because <60 are sub sampled at hospital gates. And <60 to >60 deaths ratio cannot be used either because
healthy <60 deaths are negligible and the model assumes that <60 vulnerable individuals are isolated
together with >60, so isolation changes barely affect the <60 to >60 deaths ratio predicted by the model.

How is possible that in Madrid isolation to vulnerable was lower than isolation to healthy <60? Even after
correcting for lack of IgG in asymptomatic (see Appendix III - Secondary findings, Asymptomatic: 52% of
<60 and 21% of >60) age serology ratio was 0.90, meaning vulnerable were infected in a higher proportion
that healthy <60. One explanation could be that individuals inside nursing homes were not able to isolate
properly and, even though they are a small proportion of the vulnerable population (796 beds / 100.000
inhabitants), high infection rates were enough to produce a seroprevalence ratio < 1. Isolations could be
fitting just that.

Table 6 - Immunity levels estimated with 1-phase stratified isolation levels
matching predicted and reported <60 / >60 serology ratio.

See Appendix II for the detailed analysis of the immunity level sensitivity to the model’s parameters.
Summarizing, other than the obvious sensitivity of So: -2.44 (see effects of immunity build prior to March
2019 in Appendix III - Early D614 like strain wave in Asia: A hypothesis), the only common virus parameter
with relevant sensitivity is IFR_vul: -0.85. Of the population parameters also sero_ratio: +0.75 has relevant
sensitivity, but surprisingly both of them have lower sensitivity than trivial population parameters like pop:
-1.23, pop_o60: -1.00, and con_oD: +0.98. Immune level estimations are more sensitive to the exact
amount of population from where reported deaths are drawn than to IFR_vul or seroprevalence ratio.

Predicting second waves
What locations can return to normal life? Fitted + normal life was simulated with fitted 1st-phase isolations
values and thereafter all isolations set to 0. Graphics 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.6 show how nearly uniform
isolation levels managed to extinguish the death curves but resulted in an immunity level much lower than
HIT and hence Madrid, Catalonia, Brussels, Paris*, and London* are set for another wave.

Stockholm (Graphic 1.5) is close to HIT but still has second wave (smaller than the first one) peaking on Jan
2021. The simulation introduces 1 infected every 10 days after 60 days from lockdown (to mimic some
minimal additional non-communitarian disturbances) but if these disturbances are higher in real life the
second wave would occur sooner. Stockholm won’t have a second wave if IFR_vul < 0.81%.

estimation decreases from 70% to 49% and therefore Brussels is also set for another wave (see Graphic
1.6). Reported serology ratio is 1.21 and the curve shape still remains compatible with a lower value.

Since we have inferred exposed on initial spreading day (i.e. most of them are in late December 2019 if 1
single non-communitarian spreader is assumed) we can use it to predict what would have been the
outcomes of applying other initial strategies. “Do nothing” strategy is simulated with all isolations set to
0.00 and “

The Sweden Strategy”

is simulated with 90-day isolations of 0.941 to vulnerable and 0.30 to

healthy <60 (initiating on lockdown day).

In Graphic 2.1 it can be seen how fast-spreading due to no isolations in London would have overshot
immunity level to 97% well above theoric HIT (i.e. 70%). In Graphic 2.2 it can be seen how even with a 0.94
value of isolation to vulnerable overshooting among healthy <60 would have allowed almost reaching HIT.

ICU demand and overall deaths predicted by the Imperial College Model in (2) were initially too high
because the average IFR used was too high (i.e. 0.84% average for all ages) and implicit values for London
used here are closer to 0.15% (i.e. 0.92% for vulnerable and 0.0035% for non-vulnerable with P_o60 =
0.1643), but “Do Nothing” strategies would have overwhelmed unprepared health systems anyway (+45
ICU/100K in every location).

Table 7 demonstrates that a 90-day initial strategy with 0.941 and 0.30 isolation values (i.e. Sweden’s fitted
strategy) would have allowed returning to normal life with less final deaths than the predicted for the
fitted nearly uniform isolations (and also with less ICU utilization). How close to optimum was Sweden’s

Deaths minimizing strategies
No location can return to normal life without having another wave and governments are set for another
round of mandatory policies. What are the alternatives?

The Test/Trace/Isolate (TETRIS) strategy has been proposed to stop the virus. But since pre-symptomatic
are found to be infectious (25) tracing back contacts in a pure TETRIS scenario without mandatory isolation
is impossible (i.e. imagine contagions in public night clubs). And, since mild symptomatic are also infectious
(26) and they do not usually report the disease, even when applied together with harsh isolations TETRIS
becomes impracticable after a couple hundred of contagions (i.e. virus spreads without being traced).
Unequivocal symptoms (e.g. an extreme case is Ebola) and willingness to report them are requirements for
a TETRIS strategy to work.

We developed an algorithm that for a given N-day long 3rd phase finds isolation levels for healthy <60 and
vulnerable that minimizes final SARS-CoV-2 positive deaths. What happens when the N-day long 3rd phase
ends? Some have proposed keeping isolation restrictions until the vaccine arrives (or even forever).
Another alternative is to follow with a 4th phase with different isolation levels (same levels would be just a
longer 3rd phase). In this case, final deaths will be lower or equal than with a uniform isolations phase but
multiple solutions exist. To disambiguate, an additional minimizing criterion must be introduced (e.g.
minimizing cumulative daily isolation values). Of all criteria, we chose a simple one: returning to normal life
(i.e. all isolations in 0.00 when the 3rd phase ends).

Various final deaths minimizing strategies (without a vaccine in the future) are shown in Table 8 (see
Graphic 3 for typical results but with a vaccine).

“Back in March 2020 N-day death minimizing + NL” shows that back at the beginning of the epidemic high
isolation on vulnerable (i.e. 0.94) and soft touch on healthy <60 (i.e. from +0.07 to +0.27) was the death
minimizing strategy for most locations (i.e. avoiding infections overshooting by soft ceiling above HIT).
These “would have been” predictions show how close to death minimizing was Dr. Tegnell's proposal (i.e.
schools open but stadiums closed).

“Fitted + 90-day death minimizing with 0.00 to healthy <60 + NL” shows results if the fitted strategy in each
location was followed with a 90-day phase with isolation to healthy <60 forced to 0.00. All minimums were
found with isolation to vulnerable lower than the maximum available (i.e. maximum available was 0.94). In
this case, herd immunity cannot be reached by overshooting healthy <60 infections and so the algorithm
finds deaths minimum without using the maximum isolation to vulnerable.

“Fitted + 90-day death minimizing + NL” shows results if fitted strategies were followed by a 90-day death
minimizing phase without limiting healthy <60 isolations. Naturally, deaths minimums were lower or equal
than if limiting isolation to healthy <60 to 0.00. And, as expected, all deaths minimums were higher than if
a death minimizing strategy would have been applied from the beginning.

And shockingly for all locations, sub-optimal past strategies (i.e. the fitted) led them to a point where their
death minimizing 90-day strategies have negative isolation to healthy <60 (e.g. coronavirus parties). In
these cases, the algorithm finds the minimum by overshooting healthy <60 infections and using the
maximum available isolation to vulnerable. Negative isolation values imply effective R higher than Ro since
R = Ro * (1-Iso_abl[d]) (see Appendix 1).

Table 8 – Final deaths per million (ICU/100K), isolation to vulnerable (with 0.94 maximum), and
isolation to healthy <60 for various strategies (beginning on lockdown day) and followed by normal life.

This proves that mandatory restrictions on healthy <60 can be sub-optimal and lead to more final deaths of
vulnerable individuals when returning to normal life.

What happens if a vaccine is available in the future? Minimization results for Madrid with a vaccine with
77% uniform efficacy, that can be inoculated in an ideal 1-day long campaign, are shown in Graphic 3: the
reported daily deaths, the predicted wave in Mar 2021 for the tentative 180-day (0.65, 0.40) strategy, the
vaccination on March 31, 2021 (i.e. the steep change in recovered population), the alternative strategies
(green color) and the immunity level for the shorter alternative (others not shown).

As seen in Table 8, for the 90-day alternatives death minimizing (1834 per million) also occurs with
isolation to healthy <60 in -0.84 (and isolation to vulnerable in 0.941). Since the vaccine is too distant in the
future it does not affect a 90-day long strategy. And a longer 180-day strategy but with lower isolation
available to vulnerable (i.e. 0.65) also favors virus spreading among healthy <60 with minimum reached
using 0.03 isolation to healthy <60.

If long strategies with high isolations are available minimizing strategies will include waiting for the vaccine.
Here, in a 180-day 3rd phase (coupled with 0.941 maximum isolation to vulnerable) the minimum (1545
per million) is found using the maximum available value for isolation to healthy <60 (i.e. +0.400), that is the
green wave peaking on Apr 2021. Vaccine arrives just in time to avoid the second wave.

Graphic 3 – Death minimizing 3rd phase alternatives for Madrid
(vaccination with 77% uniform efficacy on March 31, 2020).

Is it possible for vulnerable to isolate at 0.941 for 180-days? What if the vaccine does not arrive? After 6
months of harsh 0.94 isolation to vulnerable and 0.40 to healthy <60 another wave is waiting. It seems a
costly

bet. And as it was shown in Table 8 sub-optimal isolations strategies eliminate future death

minimizing alternatives and thus result in more final deaths if the vaccine does not arrive.

Graphic 4 – Final deaths per million in Catalonia for various isolation strategies
for all vaccination dates with a 77 % effective and 1-day long campaign vaccine.

Since in Madrid any strategy that included the fitted strategy resulted in higher or equal deaths for every
vaccination date than the “Back in March 2020 102-day death minimizing”, we switched to Catalonia (see
Graphic 4) to show how the vaccine with 77% efficacy favors the 180-day (0.65, 0.4) strategy resulting in
lower final deaths if vaccination occurs before November 2020 (i.e. when the dashed red line crosses the
light blue solid one).

In Stockholm, final asymptotic deaths are similar for any strategy.

For the other locations, the ‘vaccine waiting’ strategy results in more deaths than the 90-day strategies if
vaccination date is later than (Madrid: Feb 23 2021; Catalonia: Dec 28 2020; Brussels: Apr 25 2021; Paris*:
Jan 14 2021; London*: Jan 22 2021;) and maximum isolation to vulnerable available for the 90-day
strategies is 0.94 (and mostly less than 30 days later if it is 0.65).

As for the implications for a single individual, he cannot avoid an increase in his probability of getting
infected even if he continues to isolate at 0.94 until the vaccination date (see Graphic 5.1). On the other
hand, he can cease to isolate after 190 days if the fitted strategy is followed by a 90-day (0.94, -0.84)
strategy (Graphic 5.2). This example also shows that stratums isolations variations change the probability
of one individual getting infected even though it continues to isolate at very high levels (e.g. 0.94)

Graphic 6 – Effects of re-infections for a one-time vaccine followed by normal life
and 60% of recovered and vaccinated losing immunity after 2 years.

In Graphic 6 we show a 10 years simulation if the vaccine can be used only once (e.g. immunity to the
adenovirus vector lasting longer than to the SARS-CoV-2 virus) and assuming that 60% of recovered lose
immunity (both from the infections and the vaccine) and become susceptible again after 2 years. The fitted
strategy is followed by the 90-day death minimizing (0.941, -0.84) and then normal life, and the one-time
vaccine with 77% efficacy is inoculated on March 31 2021.

Isolation exemption insurance policy
State mandatory isolations have caused economic damages and since these enforced isolations were suboptimal they involuntarily increased the risk of covid-19 disease-related damages (see additional deaths in
Table 9) and led most locations to the point where future death minimizing strategies require negative
isolation to healthy <60.

Back in March 2020 for every location (see Table 9) there was a 100-day long total death minimizing
alternative (with low ICU occupation) that becomes asymptotic with lower values than 1269 deaths per
million (and much lower person potential years live lost) if the vaccination date was later than May 2020
(that is May 2020 and it didn’t happen), and simultaneously mandatory isolations did continue to and still
produce economic losses on daily basis. Therefore, we conclude that economic damages overcame covid19 disease damages in all locations where governments kept enforcing mandatory isolation after June
2020.

What went wrong? The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic required complex risk assessment and governments are not
the best equipped to do it (insurance companies are). We propose for this virus (and future viruses) an
isolation exemption insurance policy. This should be evaluated both as a revealing thought experiment and
a concrete suggestion.

In locations where mandatory isolations are imposed, any individual willing to be exempt from complete
isolation during the epidemic must take out insurance to cover covid-19 disease damages to himself and
also to third parties for spreading the virus (including years to live loss due to deaths or sequels and
hospitalizations expenses). Why should a spreader pay an issue premium to cover covid-19 disease-related

damages of third parties he will never see? Due to spreading a virus capable of causing disease causes
damages.

Although an individual going to work during an epidemic may cause damages to third parties (and to
himself), if the cost of covering the damages on third parties (or his own hospitalization expenses) is lower
than his personal perceived cost of isolating he might decide to go out anyway.

Going out even though you can cause damage and covering the risk may seem heartless, but that is exactly
what happens every time you drive your car or take a plane. Complete isolation of an elderly individual not
willing to suffer damages from your behavior should include living inside a concrete bunker to avoid your
car ending up inside his living room or the plane falling and destroying his roof. In an epidemic, the
damaging spreader cannot be identified, and damage claims due to spreaders not isolating must be made
to a common fund, like freeway insurance that pays damages for an accident caused by the rubber band
from an anonymous broken tire.

The cumulative probability of an individual getting infected on day d of the epidemic is:

P_ind [d] = P_ind [d-1] + (1-P_ind[d-1])/pop * Ro/Do *
* (I_abl[d-1] * (1 - ind_abl_ci) + I_una[d-1] * (1 - ind_una_ci));

where I_abl[d-1] and I_una[d-1] are the amount of infected healthy <60 and vulnerable the prior day and
ind_abl_ci and ind_abl_ci are the cross isolations of the individual with the healthy <60 and vulnerable
groups and can be calculated as:

ind_abl_ci = 1 - (1-Iso_abl[d])**(1/2) * (1-Iso_ind[d])**(1/2);
ind_una_ci = 1 - (1-Iso_una[d])**(1/2) * (1-Iso_ind[d])**(1/2);

where Iso_abl[d] and Iso_una[d] are the average isolations of healthy <60 and vulnerable groups, and
Iso_ind is the personal isolation of the individual. Death probability on that individual depends on his
personal IFR:
P_ind [d] * IFR_ind;

Hence, an individual not wanting to isolate at all will increase his personal disease damage risk due to his
decision and thus will see increased the issue premium covering his own risk. And, since virus spreading
will increase, issue premiums covering third-party damage claims will also increase. Or not.

That is the point; It should be clear by now that the impact of healthy <60 isolating 0.00 instead of 0.40 not
always increases covid-19 damages. Back in March 2020 (uncertainty apart) issue premiums to healthy <60
willing to isolate 0.00 would have been higher because death minimizing isolation to healthy <60 was
positive for most locations. But now, issue premiums with current vaccine efficacy and vaccination date
probabilities should be zero for most locations because healthy <60 not isolating minimizes deaths.

Beware that the exemption is from complete isolation (i.e. 1.00) so by definition no individual without
insurance could claim covid-19 damages. Most likely governments would allow lower values of uninsured
isolations and cover the difference.

ICUs scarcity at the beginning of the epidemic may enormously increase disease damages due to improper
medical attention. But if allowed, an increase in ICU hospitalization prices fuels rapid ICU expansion, and
that risk is eliminated. Most likely insurance will have exclusions, for example going out if you are
symptomatic or entering nursing homes or non-covid-19 hospitals without proper safety measures.

The proposed insurance would also help individuals to assess the personal risk they are subject to (e.g. for
different isolation brackets) by knowing the issue premium for personal damages. At some point, a waiver
to the personal damages claim will be the option for vulnerable individuals wanting to isolate below some
threshold.

For a given moment, issue premiums and perceived personal isolation cost of all individuals will lead to
equilibrium and average isolations for vulnerable and healthy <60 will continue to drive the epidemic
behavior. If more than 2 isolation exemption insurance brackets are available, then extending to N-stratum

The absence or existence of the isolation exemption insurance to cover third party damages for a particular
contagious disease could be a justification of why an Ebola patient can be forced to stay in a hospital room
or why the “bubble boy” cannot force population lockdowns to avoid catching the common cold.

What happens if a virus is so contagious (high Ro) and so damaging (high IFR_vul) to large proportions of
the population (high P_vul) that no solution exists to minimize damages and no insurer pool can cover the
risk of exempting isolations? That virus pretty much will be the end of normal life. SARS-CoV-2 is not.

Conclusions
The SARS-CoV-2 virus infection mortality rate has such a steep difference between vulnerable and healthy
<60 individuals that stratified isolations result in fewer final deaths. Our proposed 2-stratum SEIRS model is
able to fit past daily deaths curves using common virus parameters across all locations and months long
constant isolation values for vulnerable and healthy <60 disambiguated with the reported age serology
ratio. Hence, we maintain that is suitable for predicting deaths curves (and to minimize them) even under
the possibility of a vaccination campaign. The probability of covid-19 disease-related damages suffered and
caused by a single individual choosing not to completely isolate can also be estimated, which may allow
calculating the cost of covering those risks with an isolation exemption insurance policy and thus help to
minimize final deaths and economic losses caused by this epidemic.

Appendix I – SEIRS model with 2-stratum isolation
The classic Susceptible -> Exposed -> Infected -> Recovered model is extremely simple and ordered
formulas for day d are:

nE[d] = S[d-1]/pop * Ro/Do * I[d-1];
nI[d] = nE[d-Eo];
nR[d] = nI[d-Do];
S[d] = S[d-1] - nI[d];
I[d] = I[d-1] + nI[d] - nR[d];
R[d] = R[d-1] + nR[d];

where nE: new exposed (communitarian), I: infected, S: susceptible individuals, pop: population, Ro:
reproduction number, Do: days of infectiousness, nI: new infected, nR: new recovered, and R: recovered.
Each infected individual infects other Ro and new infected grow until S[d]/pop * Ro < 1 or equivalent until
(1-S[d]/pop)

>

1-1/Ro,

this

value

is

called

Herd

Immunity

Threshold

(HIT).

If

infectiousness

decays

exponentially, new recovered can be expressed as:
nR [d] = I[d-1] / Do;

resulting in the same Ro (i.e. still each infected individual infects other Ro) but with a longer tail of
infections (e.g. for Do=10 on the first 10 days of infectiousness only 61% of contagions occur). New deaths
formula is:

nD [d] = IFR * nR [d];

where IFR is the infection fatality rate. If quarantine isolations are in place the probability of getting
exposed is reduced and new exposed are:

nE[d] = S[d-1]/pop * Ro/Do * I[d-1] * (1 - Iso [d-1]);

where Iso is the isolation level. Ro*(1 - Iso) is known as effective R. To start the iteration all values in 0
except for:

S [0] = So * pop;
R [0] = (1- So) *pop;

where So is the proportion of susceptible population. To introduce non-communitarian exposed on S_day,
between communitarian new exposition and susceptible calculations:

nE [S_day] = nE [S_day] + I_dayS;

where I_dayS are non communitarian new exposed on S_day (e.g. plane arrives). With S_day > 0 and
I_dayS > S[S_day-1]. Intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalizations can be estimated with:

ICU_h[d] = ICU_pd * sum(nD[(d - ICU_dur ) .. d])

where ICU_pd: average days of ICU hospitalizations per death,

and ICU_dur: average ICU hospitalization

period for all patients, and sum(nD) are the sum of new deaths during the next ICU_dur days. If after a
period of time a proportion of recovered loss immunity, then:

nS [d] = nR[d-T1] * PRLI;
S[d] = S[d-1] - nI[d] + nS [d];
R[d] = R[d-1] + nR[d] - nS [d];

where nS[d]: new susceptible; T1: average period for losing immunity;

and PRLI: proportion of recovered

losing immunity (this is what is usually known as the SEIRS model). If it is relevant modeling PRLI as a
function of period t,

nS [d] = sumAT( nR[d-t] * PRLI [t] );

where sumAT: sum for all values of t.

If immunity is not lost and a 2nd competing strain with complete cross immunity appears, then:

nE2[d] = S[d-1]/pop * Ro2/Do2 * I2[d-1] * (1 – Iso2 [d-1]);
nI2[d] = nE2[d-Eo2];
nR2[d] = nI2[d-Do2];
S[d] = S[d-1] - nI[d] – nI2[d];
I2[d] = I2[d-1] + nI2[d] – nR2[d];
R2[d] = R2[d-1] + nR2[d];

where the 2nd strain obtains and draws new exposed from the same susceptible compartment. If Ro2 > Ro
and recovered are far from HIT, then I2 >> I and the 2nd strain eventually overcomes the 1st. Deaths from
the 2nd strain:

nD2 [d] = IFR2 * nR2 [d];

where IFR2: infection fatality rate of the 2nd strain. In what scenario can Iso2 be different than Iso? For
example,

if

the

2nd

strain

produces

fewer

symptoms

and

symptomatic

stay

home.

Usually,

fewer

symptoms mean less mortality (i.e IFR2 < IFR), and thus symptomatic staying home results in less final
deaths.

If recovered from a 2nd strain with no cross immunity (i.e. almost another virus) become susceptible to the
1st strain but with IFR3 <> IFR (e.g. IFR3 > IFR in Dengue) then a third computation must be performed for
the spreading of the 1st strain:

nS3[d] = nR2[d-T3] * PRLI3;
nE3[d] = S3[d-1]/pop * Ro/Do * ( (I[d-1]+ I3[d-1]) * (1 – Iso [d-1]);
nE[d] = S[d-1]/pop * Ro/Do * ( (I[d-1]+ I3[d-1]) * (1 – Iso [d-1]);
nI3[d] = nE3[d-Eo];
nR3[d] = nI3[d-Do];
S[d] = S[d-1] - nI[d] - nS3[d];
S3[d] = S3[d-1] – nI3[d] + nS3[d];
I3[d] = I3[d-1] + nI3[d];
R3[d] = R3[d-1] + nR3[d];

and

nD3 [d] = IFR3 * nR3 [d];

Where nS3: new susceptible to the 1st strain with IFR3; nR2: recovered from the 2nd strain; T3: average
period from recovered of 2nd strain to becoming susceptible with IFR3 to the 1st strain; PRLI3: proportion
of recovered from 2nd strain that becomes susceptible with IFR3 to the 1st strain. This last example shows
how highly complex scenarios can be easily modeled by adding simple algebraic operations to the main
iteration.

Simple extension for 2-stratum isolation
To extend for isolation stratification the population is separated in two different groups (e.g. A for able to
isolate from vulnerable and U for unable to isolate from vulnerable) and the new exposed for day d are
calculated with:

nE_abl[d] = S_abl[d-1]/pop*Ro/Do * (I_abl[d-1]*(1-Iso_abl[d]) + I_una[d-1]*(1-auci[d]));
nE_una[d] = S_una[d-1]/pop*Ro/Do * (I_una[d-1]*(1-Iso_una[d]) + I_abl[d-1]*(1-auci[d]));

where nE_abl: communitarian new exposed of the A group, S_abl: susceptible of A, I_abl: infected of A,
Iso_abl: restriction level between A individuals, I_una: infected of U, nE_una: communitarian new exposed
of U, S_una: susceptible of U, I_una: infected of U, Iso_una: restriction level between A individuals, and
auci: cross isolation between A and U isolation groups. A simple hypothesis for auci used here is:

auci[d] = 1-Math.sqrt(1-Iso_abl[d]) * Math.sqrt(1-Iso_una[d]);

New exposed of the A group (nE_abl) are susceptible of the A group that get exposed from the currently
infected of the A group at Ro/Do * (1-Iso_abl) daily rate and from the currently infected of the U group at
Ro/Do * (1-auci) daily rate. The analogous holds for new exposed for the U group (nE_una).

Susceptible, infected, and recovered of the two groups do not interact in another way and classic SEIRS
applies. If uniform non-susceptibility is used, to start the simulation:

S_abl [0] = So * pop * P_abl;
S_una [0] = So * pop * (1-P_abl);
R_abl [0] = (1- So) * pop * P_abl;
R_una [0] = (1- So) * pop * (1 - P_abl);

where P_abl: proportion of the population that belongs to group A, calculated here as:

P_abl = 1-(P_vul + P_non_vul_una);

where P_vul: proportion of vulnerable population (i.e. a higher IFR applies to them), P_non_vul_una:
proportion of population non-vulnerable unable to isolate from vulnerable (e.g. 7%, living in the same
household). P_vul is calculated as:

P_vul = P_o60 + (1-P_o60) * P_vul_u60;

25

preprint (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
It is made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license .
where P_o60: proportion of the population older than 60 years old (e.g. 29% in Europe) and P_vul_u60:
proportion of

younger than 60 years population

that is

vulnerable

(e.g. 3.42%, see Appendix II

for

parameter estimations discussion). For Europe:

P_vul = 0.29 + (1 – 0.29) * 0.0342 = 0.3143
P_abl = 1 - (0.3143 + 0.07) = 0.3843

To introduce uniform non communitarian exposures en S_day, between communitarian new exposition
and susceptible calculations:

nE_abl [S_day] = nE_abl [S_day] + I_dayS * P_abl;
nE_una [S_day] = nE_abl [S_day] + I_dayS * (1-P_abl);

And finally to extend to mortality stratification, since some non vulnerable individuals are isolated with
vulnerable new deaths from each isolation group are calculated as follows:

nD_vul [d] = IFR_vul * nR_U[d-(RtoD-Do)] * P_vul/(P_vul + P_non_vul_una);

nD_non_vul [d] = IFR_non_vul *
* (nR_A[d-(RtoD-Do)] + nR_U[d-(RtoD-Do)] / (P_vul / P_non_vul_una +1));

where

nD_vul:

individuals

(e.g.

new

deaths

1.06%),

of

RtoD:

vulnerable
average

individuals,

period

IFR_vul:

between

infection

“recovered”

and

fatality

rate

for

vulnerable

death

(e.g.

10

days),

and

IFR_non_vul: IFR for non vulnerable individuals (e.g. 0.01%). And to calculate new recovered <60 and >60:

nR_o60[d] = nR_una[d] * P_o60 / (P_o60 + (1-P_o60) * P_vul_u60 + P_non_vul_una);

nR_u60[d] = nR_abl[d] + nR_una[d] * ((1-P_o60) * P_vul_u60 + P_non_vul_una) / (P_o60 + (1-P_o60) *
* P_vul_u60 + P_non_vul_una);

For a uniform vEff effective vaccination event occurring on vDay, after calculating for day d:

nR_vacc_abl [d] = S_abl[d] * vEff;
nR_vacc_una[d] = S_una[d] * vEff;
R_abl[d] = R_abl[d] + nR_vacc_abl [d];
R_una[d] = R_una[d] + nR_vacc_una[d];
S_abl[d] = S_abl[d] - nR_vacc_abl[d];
S_una[d] = S_una[d] - nR_vacc_una[d];

Exact modeling of a non uniform vaccination event (e.g. not all vulnerable can be vaccinated) would
require healthy <60 unable to isolate with vulnerable (P_non_vul_una) to be calculated separately (it will
still be a 2-stratum isolation though). New susceptible losing immunity from infection and from vaccination
are:

nS_una [d] = nR_una [d-T1] * PRLI + nR_vacc_una [d-T_vacc] * PRLI_vacc;
nS_abl [d] = nR_abl [d-T1] * PRLI + nR_vacc_abl [d-T_vacc] * PRLI_vacc;

where T_vacc and PRLI_vacc are the average period and proportion of recovered losing vaccine immunity.

If one single individual choose to isolate different than any average the probability of getting infected can
be calculated with:

P_ind [d] = P_ind [d-1] + (1-P_ind[d-1])/pop * Ro/Do *
* (I_abl[d-1] * (1 - ind_abl_ci) + I_una[d-1] * (1 - ind_una_ci));

where P_ind: cumulative probability of getting infected on day d; ind_abl_ci: individual and able cross
isolation, ind_abl_ci: individual and unable cross isolation, and both are calculated:

ind_abl_ci = 1-Math.sqrt(1-Iso_abl[d]) * Math.sqrt(1-Iso_ind[d]);
ind_una_ci = 1-Math.sqrt(1-Iso_una[d]) * Math.sqrt(1-Iso_ind[d]);

where Iso_ind: individual isolation.

Note that shall the single individual isolate at the same level that vulnerable (i.e. Iso_una) then ind_una_ci
= Iso_una, and ind_abl_ci = auci (i.e. vulnerable and healthy <60 cross isolation) and the following holds:

nE_una [d] = (1-P_ind[d-1])* S_una[0]/pop * Ro/Do *
* (I_abl[d-1] * (1 - auci) + I_una[d-1] * (1 – Iso_una[d-1]));

The extension of the classic SEIRS model is then a small set of simple iterative instructions. The exact same
model used through this paper (1) has been made available online to the sole effect of understanding and

we assume is constant among metropolis. It does not affect intermediate immunity level estimations but
determines the immunity level necessary to return to normal life HIT=1-1/Ro. Large variations in Ro

Eo = 5 days (sensitivity ≈ 0)

Exposure period. See 2 day Do (infectiousness) section for point estimation.

RtoD = 11 days (sensitivity ≈ 0)
Recovered to death period. Estimated by fitting daily deaths curves for all locations near lockdown day.

So = 1.00 (sensitivity -2.44)
Proportion of population that is susceptible, we assume 1 (novel virus). Also back in March 2020 when
isolations have not had effect yet SARS-CoV-2 positive deaths had a steep increase in all analyzed locations
pointing to high proportion of susceptible.

IFR_vul = 0.0092 (sensitivity -0.85)
Infection Fatality Rate for vulnerable individuals (probability of dying because of covid-19).

IFR_vul is an average value for >60 individuals (and healthy <60 with underlying diseases), stratifying an
arbitrary amount of age segments to adjust a particular location for different age distributions of >60
population can also be done.

Beware that since the model predicts SARS-CoV-2 positive deaths including deaths of other causes testing
positive by chance, to compare other IFR estimations for >60 with IFR_vul they should be decreased 13.2%
(or equivalently IFR_vul increased to 1.06%). See section 15% of SARS-CoV-2 positive deaths are “with” the
virus in Appendix III - Secondary findings.

And since most IFR estimations do not account for undetected T cell immune response to be compared
with IFR_vul they should be decreased 8%. See section Asymptomatic: 52% of <60 and 21% of >60 in
Appendix III - Secondary findings.

In (16) estimated IFR (95% CI) for older >60 not living in nursing homes was 1.71% (1.28%-2.58%). Since all
>60 are vulnerable and decreasing the IFR estimation 8% (for undetected T cells) and 13.2% (for testing
positive by chance) results in 1.38% (1.03% - 2.08%) (95% CI), then IFR_vul is still below the lower bound of
the CI reported in (16). Why do we use this lower value of IFR_vul anyway? We are estimating immunity
levels and predicting epidemic behavior for real and we think that IFR_vul is currently overestimated
because of vanishing antibody titer levels (33).

The wide range of IFR estimations reported in (23) shows the difficulties of using absolute values of
seroprevalence studies to estimate IFR. Adding competing SARS-CoV-2 strains with different IFR_vul and
infectivity (see Early D614 like strain wave in Asia: A hypothesis in Appendix III) would result in different IFR
average estimations depending on the prevalence of each strain. Besides age and underlying diseases,
ethnicity (16) and blood type (39) among others have also been reported to affect IFR. Medical treatments
of covid-19 are also constantly improving (e.g. Dexamethasone results reported in (40)) but they may not
always be used homogeneously across locations.

Lower real values of IFR_vul than the used here (i.e. 0.92%) would mean that our immunity levels
estimations are a lower bound of real values. But beware that death minimizing isolation strategies
resulting in lower values of isolation to healthy <60 than isolation to vulnerable do not arise from any
particular value of IFR_vul, but because of the unequivocal fact that IFR_non_vul is much lower than
IFR_vul.

IFR_non_vul = 0.000035 (sensitivity ≈ 0)

IFR for healthy <60 (probability of dying because of covid-19).

In (28) were reported 89 no illness deaths of <60 and 414 with pending investigation. We have fitted NYC
and the model predicts 772 SARS-CoV-2 positive deaths for healthy <60, so even counting all pending
investigation as no illness <60 deaths predicted deaths are higher than reported ones. Hence IFR_non_vul
used here can be considered an upper bound of the real IFR for healthy <60.

APTP = 17 (sensitivity -0.17)
Average positive testing period.

In (33) the median duration of viral shedding was 19 days for asymptomatic and 14 days for symptomatic.
Given the 0.52 proportion for asymptomatic in <60 and 0.21 in >60 for all practical P_o60 proportions (i.e.
0.1 to 0.3) we assume APTP = 17. Different APTP values for vulnerable and healthy <60 could also be used.

P_vul_u60 = 0.0342 (sensitivity -0.06)
Proportion of <60 population that is vulnerable. Using IFR ranges estimated in (16) and Indiana population
pyramid, IFR for <60 is estimated at 0.046%. Formula for IFR <60 is

0.00046 = P_vul_u60 * IFR_vul_sc2p + (1-P_vul_u60) * IFR_non_vul_sc2p

with P_vul_u60 = 0.0342, if IFR_vul_sc2p (i.e. 0.0106) and IFR_non_vul_sc2p (i.e. 0.0001) as defined in
section: 15% of SARS-CoV-2 positive deaths are “with” the virus.

P_non_vul_una = 0.07 (sensitivity ≈ 0)
Proportion of population that is <60 and cannot isolate from vulnerable individuals. Average guessing.

T1 = 180 (sensitivity ≈ 0)
Period between recovered and losing immunity (days). No estimations were available.

PRLI = 0.00 (sensitivity ≈ 0)
Proportion of recovered losing immunity after T1. No estimations were available.

A_o60 = 0.21 (sensitivity -0.06)
Proportion of >60 that are asymptomatic. Selected to fit (8) and in line with (27). See Asymptomatic
section in Appendix III.

Proportion of <60 that are asymptomatic. Selected to fit (8) and in line with (27). See Asymptomatic

Recording the exact date will change past reported daily deaths (i.e. usually deaths are not reported the
same day they occurred) but sensitive information may be lost if the exact day of deceased is not recorded.

It should also include testing deceased post-mortem if a near-death test (e.g. PCR) was not performed
(most countries do it that way). Some locations (e.g. Singapore) might have instructed medical doctors to
discriminate dying “with” or “because” of the virus and sensitive epidemiological information can be lost if
dying “with” the virus is not recorded too. It is possible to match the “predicted reported deaths”
produced by the model with the “with the virus” reported deaths and much harder to match it if a
“heterogeneous per-doctor because of the virus” criterion is used for reporting. Though, if the chance of
psychosis is considered, reporting “because” may make more sense.

A metropolitan area should be fitted as one single location. For example, Paris City departments are 75, 92,
93, 94 and Greater Paris also includes 95, 78, 91, and 77. Single cities inside conglomerates may have daily
deaths of outsiders recorded in their hospitals and hence result in immune level overestimation. Also,
deaths from all districts must be included to avoid immune level underestimation.

In some locations reported daily deaths might be available only from hospitals since total deaths for
locations are usually well known daily deaths can be corrected by using the con_oD_scale variable in the
*.js location file (e.g. we did it with Greater London con_oD_scale = 1.11).

PYDR_vul = 0.031 (sensitivity -0.14)
Population yearly death rate for vulnerable individuals (>60 natural). Using population yearly death rate by
age published in (32) with the >60 population pyramid PYDR_vul = 0.031.

PYDR_non_vul = 0.0014 (sensitivity ≈ 0)
Population yearly death rate for non-vulnerable individuals. Using population yearly death rate by age
published in (32) with the population pyramid, yearly death rate for <60 is 0.00241. But since the <60
population includes a proportion of vulnerable (i.e. P_vul_u60 = 0.0342) we assume that:

0.00241 = P_vul_u60 * PYDR_vul + (1- P_vul_u60) * PYDR_non_vul

and hence we estimate PYDR_non_vul = 0.0014.

Iso_1_real (sensitivity ≈ 0)
Day of lockdown/restrictions beginning. Lockdowns beginnings are fuzzy, Iso_1_real is inferred from fitting
daily deaths curves using uniform RtoD = 11 for all locations.

The reported serology ratio may change during time reflecting changes in individual behavior (e.g. healthy
<60 summer behavior in London). But can also remain fairly constant like in Spain from May to June. The
model used here supports multiple serology report dates.

If antibody titer levels in >60 individuals decrease slower than in <60 individuals then the reported serology
ratio will be a lower bound of the real immune response and hence immunity level will be underestimated.

Appendix III - Secondary findings
Asymptomatic: 52% of <60 and 21% of >60
By dividing <60 and >60 seroprevalence absolute values, serology tests inaccuracies are mostly canceled.
But if the asymptomatic proportion of <60 is different than asymptomatic proportion of >60, then the age
serology ratio cannot be estimated only with the <60 to >60 recovered ratio and the following should be
used:

R_u60 / R_o60 * P_o60 / (1 - P_o60) / * (1 - A_u60 * TAK) / (1 - A_o60 * TAK)

where R_u60/R_o60 is the <60 and >60 recovered ratio, P_o60 is the proportion >60 in population, A_o60
and A_u60 are the proportion of >60 and <60 that are asymptomatic, and TAK is the proportion of
asymptomatic with T cell response but without antibody detectable titer levels found in (15) (i.e. 0.35).

Missing IgG response in asymptomatic would not affect serology ratio if <60 and >60 have the same
proportion of asymptomatic, but evidence points a different direction. In (27) reported median age in
asymptomatic (37 years old) was lower than in symptomatic (56 years old).

We did not find age-stratified asymptomatic proportion reliable estimations (raw data in (8) may have it).
But in order to fit the total asymptomatic to symptomatic ratio reported in the serology study in Spain (i.e.
0.51 = 34% / 66%), values A_o60 = 0.21 and A_u60 = 0.52 were necessary.

With those asymptomatic proportions (1 - A_u60 * TAK) / (1 - A_o60 * TAK) = 0.88. Implicit average
proportion of asymptomatic in Madrid is 44.49% (in line with the consensus of 45% reported in 28).

15% of SARS-CoV-2 positive deaths are “with” the virus
If the criterion to report daily deaths is counting any death testing SARS-CoV-2 positive (as most locations
do) the new deaths (nD) formula detailed in Appendix I cannot be used to predict them and the following
should be used instead:

nD_vul[d] = IFR_vul_sc2p * nR_una[d-RtoD] * P_vul / (P_vul + P_non_vul_una);

where IFR_vul_sc2p: probability of dying testing sar-cov-2 positive (after being infected with SARS-CoV-2)
and can be calculated as:

IFR_vul_sc2p = IFR_vul * (1-NDR_vul) + NDR_vul * (1-IFR_vul) + IFR_vul * NDR_vul;

where NDR_vul: probability of dying of other causes than sar-cov-2 testing sar-cov-2 positive (after being
infected with SARS-CoV-2) and can be estimated as:

NDR_vul = (1+PYDR_vul) ** (APTP/365) - 1;

where PYDR_vul: population yearly death rate of other causes than SARS-CoV-2 infection for vulnerable
individuals, ** indicates power operation, and APTP: average period of testing positive (in days) after being

infected to the virus (e.g. 17). IFR_vul_sc2p formula holds because NDR_vul and IFR_vul correspond to
independent events. Being SARS-CoV-2 a novel virus and assuming PYDR_vul have not changed in 2020
(e.g. lockdowns have not markedly changed other than SARS-CoV-2 death rates), then prior to 2019
estimations can be used for PYDR_vul (e.g. 0.031 for >60 in 2017).

The analogous holds for nD_non_vul, but since <60 includes a proportion of vulnerable (i.e. P_vul_u60)
then PYDR_non_vul (i.e. 0.0014) cannot be estimated by directly using <60 population yearly death rate
(i.e. 0.00241). See Appendix II for details.

Table A3.1 – Final SARS-CoV-2 positive deaths per million (fitted isolations + normal life)

Since most deaths come from vulnerable individuals, proportion of reported SARS-CoV-2 positive deaths
that were not caused by covid-19 is mostly invariant to isolation strategies (i.e. ≈ 15%). In a similar manner
including SARS-CoV-2 tests, sensitivity and specificity would also lead to changes in the predicted SARSCoV-2 positive deaths.

2 days Do (infectiousness)

While fitting curves we came across that an exponentially decay 2 days infectiousness period (Do) coupled
with a 5 days exposure (Eo) were able to explain the multiple valleys encountered after lockdowns in 1-day
moving average daily deaths curves (fitting was done using 7-ma). We postulate that these valleys are not
data reporting problems but inherent to the epidemic behavior (i.e. a feedback system with delay).

In (24) was found that the median period from infection to symptoms onset was 5.5 days (with fewer than

infectiousness function is likely to be more complex (e.g. not peaking on the first day of infectiousness),
but we understand that Eo=5 and Do=2 are compatible with virus dynamic found in the field.

In (9) authors used Eo=5.1 and citing (26) set Do=5 (days an individual is assumed to be infectious on
average). We understand findings in (26) establish that infections occurred during less than 5 days (peaking
before) and not during 5 days on average. Under long enough isolation strategies, Do choice barely
changes final immunity level (i.e. Ro and isolations levels determine it) but since Do does determine
epidemic speed (i.e. it is the time scale) with short enough strategies lower values of Do will result in lower
final immunity levels because HIT is reached during the isolation strategy and not once it has ended.

A hypothetical super spreading event (e.g. 1000 infected) not much before the beginning of lockdowns can
send daily deaths into deeper valleys. If reported daily deaths are recorded exactly with the date of
deceased, Paris and Stockholm 1-day moving average high variance data would be compatible with this
close to lockdown dominant super spreading event. We maintain that for the formulae used here Do is
lower than 3 because above that value, not even those close to lockdown super spreading events would be
able to produce the observed multiple regularly spaced valleys.

We did not dig further to discard that daily patterns are just a weekend reporting problem, but it may be
worth looking at it because such a short Do might also have implications for medical treatments.

Early D614 like strain wave in Asia: A hypothesis
Authors in (36) found that over the course of 1 month the new variant with Spike G614 reported in (37)
replaced the original D614 as the dominant pandemic form. Also in (36), and even though G614 is
associated with lower RT PCR Cts (suggestive of higher viral loads in patients), they did not find increased
disease severity as measured by hospitalization outcomes.

Assuming that SARS-CoV-2 variant fitted here was the G614 (i.e. IFR_vul = 0.92%; Ro=3.3; Do = 2) and that
the lower infectivity of the replaced variant D614 cannot only be the result of much lower Ro but also
higher Do is needed (e.g. Ro_D614 = 2 and Do_D614 = 6), and also assuming the D614 variant does actually
have much lower disease severity than G614 (i.e. IFR_vul_D614 = IFR_vul/5 = 0.18%); we modeled the two

1

competing strains in Madrid

with the G614 variant dominant spreading event on Dec 19 2019 (i.e. same

date that fitted) and two different dates for the D614 dominant spreading events. (See in Appendix I: 2nd
competing strain with complete cross-immunity).

Since we are hypothesizing lower IFR_vul for D614 in disagreement with (36) we refer to it as D614*

Results for the D614* arriving in Madrid on Aug 24 2019 are shown in Graphics A3.3.1. Even though it’s
dominant spreader event occurs 117 days before G614’s, by March 2020 G614 dominates completely
(D614* deaths are the small light blue curve). But if D614* arrives 60 days earlier (i.e. Jun 25, 2019) it
manages to reach HIT before G614 has time to build its own wave. Since both competing strains are
obtaining exposed individuals from the same susceptible compartment (i.e. complete cross-immunity) by
the time G614 arrives it does not find enough susceptible to spread and final deaths are lower.

G614 (Dec 19, 2019) and D614* (Jun 25 2019)

Note that since D614* has low infectivity it needs 5 months (from Jun 25 2019 to Nov 25 2019) to reach
11,201 infected in Madrid (i.e. 0.17% of the population). Thus for D614* the probability of one traveler
from that location becoming a dominant spreader in another location remains low for many months. As
neighbor locations are more connected, the probability of an early wave in Asian locations must have been
higher than in Europe or America. Nevertheless, the probability of an Asian location of not having an early
D614* wave would not be zero and analogously for a western location of do having it.

Thus the hypothesis that an early wave of a D614* like variant is the cause of the very low death count
observed in Asian locations would be compatible with a non-negligible probability of finding some Asian
locations in which death count was not very low (e.g. Wuhan) and western locations in which it was (e.g.
Florianopolis, Brazil (41)).

The estimated Ro/Do ratio for G614 is 1.65 (i.e. 3.3/2) and that ratio must be much lower for the real D614
variant (e.g. 0.333) to G614 being able to rapidly overcome it. We set Do_D614 = 6 because trying to
hypothesize a lower value (e.g. 4) would require Ro_D614 to be 1.333 to maintain the D614 ratio. With this
low Ro, moving the D614* dominant spreading 7 months back would allow it’s wave to occur before the
G614 arrival, but the immunity level achieved by the D614* wave would be lower (e.g. 45%) and thus the
arrival of G614 (without isolations in place or without perfect timing with them) would result in a
noticeable wave of deaths, and that did not occur.

Negligible reduction of HIT due to heterogeneity

Authors in (12) proposed that heterogeneity reduces HIT below 1-1/Ro level. We tested our 2-stratum
model response for two plausible sources of heterogeneity: non-contagious asymptomatic reported in (42)
and lower connectivity in young population as might be hinted in (8).

+ I_una[d-1] * ((1-A_una) + A_una * A_inf) * (1 - auci));

nE_una[d]=S_una[d-1]/pop * Ro/Do * (I_una[d-1] * ((1-A_una) + A_una * A_inf) * (1 - Iso_una[d]) +
+ I_abl[d-1] * ((1-A_abl) + A_abl * A_inf) * (1 - auci));

where A_inf: contagious asymptomatic (e.g. 0), A_abl: proportion of healthy <60 that are asymptomatic
(e.g. 0.52 in Madrid), and A_una: proportion of vulnerable that are asymptomatic (e.g. 0.282 in Madrid).
And heterogeneity due to lower connectivity

(C) by increasing isolation to healthy <60 with the formula:

level[j] = level[j] + (1-level[j]) * Iso_min;

where level[j]: isolation level in day j; Iso_min: minimum isolation in normal life (e.g. Iso_min_abl = 0.4;
Iso_min_una = 0.0).

If Ro=3.3 is used to fit reported daily deaths curves under the heterogeneous models, required infected on
spread day drastically increase (e.g. in Madrid I_dayS = 1477.24 up from 1.10) and predicted deaths before
lockdown depart too much from reported. See Graphics A3.4.1, A3.4.2 and A3.4.3.

This increase in I_dayS also occurs in every location (see Table A3.2). To maintain I_dayS = 1.10 in Madrid
Ro must be increased to 5.912 for heterogeneity (A) and to 4.47 for heterogeneity (C). Fitting reported
daily deaths curves and serology ratios using those Ro values for all locations also results in almost
identical I_dayS values than under homogeneity with Ro=3.3 (see Table A3.2).

HIT levels were found searching uniform isolation values for vulnerable and healthy <60 for a 300-day long
strategy starting on beginning of phase 1 that minimized final immunity level for a 7 years long simulation
(see Table A3.2).

Table A3.2 – HIT under homogeneity and heterogeneity assumptions for different Ro
and (infected on original spread day) necessary to fit reported daily deaths curves

Shockingly, if Ro used under heterogeneity is increased (i.e. from 3.3 to 5.912 and 4.47) to properly fit
reported deaths before lockdown, then HIT suffers almost no reduction from 70%.

Besides the caveats of using countrywide confirmed cases, authors in (12) fitted curves in Italy and Austria
with CV=1 (i.e. coefficient of variation) using Ro=3, but somehow they managed to fit a high increase of
heterogeneity (i.e. to CV=3) using almost the same Ro (i.e. maximum increase was 11%), and that might be
the reason why they end up observing HIT reduction.

Homogeneity is implicitly assumed when Ro is estimated by fitting data at the beginning of the epidemic
(e.g. Ro = 3.3). The increase of Ro (e.g. to 4.47) required to fit the same data when heterogeneity is
assumed mostly compensates the reduction in HIT due to heterogeneity (see Table A3.2) even with
substantial heterogeneity (i.e. Iso_min_abl = 0.4 >> Iso_min_una = 0.0). Therefore, we conclude that for
SARS-CoV-2 reduction of HIT=1-1/Ro due to the plausible modeled heterogeneities is negligible.

Results must not be interpreted as heterogeneity not reducing HIT, because it might. For example HIT
achieved under heterogeneity due to connectivity would be 59% if a high (maybe implausible) level of
isolation to healthy <60 in normal life is assumed (e.g. Iso_min_abl = 0.8). In this case the required increase
of Ro from 3.3 to 7.0 to fit the data does not completely compensate HIT reduction.

We also tested immunity level estimation and death minimizing isolation values under heterogeneity (see
Tables A3.3 and A3.4). Immunity level estimation remained constant and minimum final deaths increased.
Maximum values of isolation to vulnerable available for death minimizing under heterogeneity are the
obtained while fitting Stockholm: 0.934 under heterogeneity (A) and 0.959 under heterogeneity (C).

“Back in March” death minimizing under both heterogeneity due to lower connectivity and due to noncontagious asymptomatic led to even lower values of isolations to healthy <60 than under homogeneity.
