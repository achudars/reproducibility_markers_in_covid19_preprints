Abstract — Pandemics including COVID-19 have
disproportionately affected socioeconomically
vulnerable populations. To create a repeatable
modelling process to identify regional population
centers with pandemic vulnerability, readily
available COVID-19 and socioeconomic variable
datasets were compiled, and linear regression
models were built during the early days of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The models were validated
later in the pandemic timeline using actual
COVID-19 mortality rates in states with high
population densities, with New York, New Jersey,
Connecticut, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Michigan
and Pennsylvania showing the strongest
predictive results. Our models have been shared
with the Department of Health Commissioners of
each of these states as input into a much needed
“pandemic playbook” for local healthcare
agencies in allocating medical testing and
treatment resources.
Keywords— Coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2;
Pandemic; Socioeconomic status; Predictive
model; Healthcare resource allocation
I. INTRODUCTION

Socioeconomic vulnerability can directly
influence the severity of pandemics and their impact
on mortalities in ways including access to healthcare,
residence in crowded housing units and

comorbidities. Prior studies of swine flu (H1N1)
have pointed to these factors as contributors to the
spread and severity of that pandemic1. Other studies
have identified national level correlations that are
helpful, but not actionable at a local level where
actual healthcare resource allocation decisions are
made2.
Early and accurate decisioning for healthcare
resource allocations are particularly critical in
geographic locations with high population density.
This research created a repeatable modelling process
that uses readily available data sources to identify the
top counties in densely populated states with high
likelihoods of disproportionate COVID-19 mortality
rates. These models have been shared with the
Department of Health Commissioners of New York,
New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Louisiana,
Michigan and Pennsylvania where the models
performed best. All Commissioners responded
positively which validates our hypothesis that
neither other researchers nor the Departments of
Health themselves have developed a similar
modelling process as a means to allocate scarce
healthcare resources such as testing, treatment,
education and communication.
II. METHODS

Exploratory data research at a national level was
performed using county level data (Federal

mortality datasets (deaths per 100,000 of population)
were created using the John’s Hopkins Dataset
(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html)3 and data
from the US Census Bureau 4. Socioeconomic
vulnerability datasets at a county level were created
using sub-components of the CDC Social
Vulnerability Index (https://svi.cdc.gov/data-andtools-download.html) 5.

well as usafacts.org7 for cumulative mortalities as of
April 8,2020 and May 8, 2020.
County-level independent variable datasets were
created
using
socioeconomic data
from
countyhealthrankings.org, a collaboration dataset
created by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and
the University of Wisconsin Population Health
Institute8. Given the year-to-year stability of most of
these socioeconomic variables, the latest data
available in the countyhealthrankings.org was used
and no attempt was made to augment the dataset to
try to match the time-series to either April 8, 2020 or
May 8, 2020.

Scatterplots and trendlines were used to identify
those variables most correlated with COVID-19
mortalities. Few, if any, social vulnerability
variables correlated across all of the 3,142 FIPS
counties, but minority status correlated strongly in
certain regions, particularly those with high
mortality rates.

The May 8, 2020 date was used to ensure that the
dependent variable would be tuned to a timeframe at
or around the peak in daily mortalities when
healthcare resources (testing, treatment, tracing) are
typically most needed. The mortality curves below
provide support for May 8th as the overall date for
mortality predictions as shown in the Institute of

dataset
(https://covid19.healthdata.org/) 10.

A stepwise linear regression technique was used to
build each state level model.
All relevant
independent variables (Figure 3) were initially used
in the model (i.e., include severe housing problems,
but exclude violent deaths). Next, the variable with
the lowest T-statistic was removed and the linear
regression was re-run. This process was repeated
until all T-statistics for the remaining independent
variables were near a value of 2 or greater.
III. RESULTS

Predictive models were completed for New York,
New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Louisiana,
Michigan and Pennsylvania with statistically
significant results.

Model validation comparing predicted to actual
county rankings by cumulative mortality rate (deaths
per 100,000 of population) through May 8 th and data
visualizations using state level maps were
completed. These validations were used to share
model methods and results with the Commissioners
of each state’s Department of Health.

Two further validations were completed as well.
The first validation was to check model performance
using COVID-19 mortality data on April 8, 2020
instead of May 8, 2020. This validation tested
whether models using data available early in the
pandemic would have been sufficient to build the
models. The same variables were used, but
coefficients were recalibrated with the April 8
dataset. April 8 and May 8 model outputs were
compared to test for stability in the top counties
predicted for high COVID-19 mortality rates. For
New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the models
were stable. For Massachusetts, the 4/8 model
performance was not strong, but this was easily
corrected by using case data in place of mortality
data. This is an important finding as it validates the
predictive power contained in early case data which
is more readily available at the start of a pandemic.

With models and validations completed, the
Departments of Health for New York, New Jersey,
Connecticut, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Michigan
and Pennsylvania were contacted. Additionally,
agents of the New York Department of Health
(Northwell Health and CORE) and a third-party
statistical modelling firm for Connecticut
(COVIDACTNOW) were contacted. Response
from these contacts were positive and, in some cases,
occurred within an hour of outreach (Northwell
Health). This response indicates the strong appetite
and need for this type of healthcare resource
allocation tool for pandemics and other health crises.
In fact, the Pennsylvania Department of Health
indicated this tool’s importance in any second waves
of COVID-19.

IV. DISCUSSION
Fig. 11 Massachusetts model validation results example using April 8 case
data

The second validation was to check the
independent variables for multi-collinearity, with a
specific focus on the correlations between Black and
variables such as severe housing and uninsured.
Strong multi-collinearity was seen in Connecticut,
Massachusetts, Louisiana and Michigan partially
explaining why these variables did not remain in the
model after the stepwise regression process.

The research described in this manuscript has
shown the extent to which Black Americans, people
living in crowded housing units, and households
with less access to healthcare are at higher risk of
severe illness during a pandemic. The results of
other studies provide several possible explanations
for these results. Lower income households are
more likely to live in crowded housing units and
multi-family homes12. Lower income households
are also structurally disadvantaged in their access to
medical insurance and healthcare13. Some studies
have also pointed to a concept called “weathering”
within the Black American community. Arline
Geronimus, a professor of public health at the
University of Michigan, showed through her
research that among black communities, coping
with financial strain, discrimination and barriers to
good education elevates the stress response

contributing to obesity, diabetes, hypertension and
heart disease 14.
The CDC conducted research on the cooccurrence of COVID-19 and certain ethnicities
using a sample of 580 patients with lab-confirmed
data15. Their results showed that more
hospitalizations in Black patients than White
patients. The researchers cited underlying medical
conditions, work circumstance and living
conditions to be major factors in COVID-19
mortalities in their sample. For example, members
of racial and ethnic minorities are more likely to
live in densely populated areas, making it more
difficult to practice social distancing and being
more susceptible to contracting and spreading
COVID-19 15. These members also lived farther
away from grocery stores and medical facilities,
thus being less able to receive necessary resources
and medical attention 15. Other examples cited
included Hispanic and Black American workers
employed in higher risk industries and often lacking
paid sick leave. The researchers hypothesized that
these types of workers were more likely to continue
working despite being sick, thus exposing other
workers to the disease 15. The CDC recommended at
the conclusion of this research that public health
officials communicate to different population
groups about COVID-19 and provide more
healthcare services to ethnic minority groups15.
While studies such as these are insightful,
we are not aware of any research that translates
these impacts into predictive models that can be
used locally to direct healthcare resources to the
communities most likely to need them, thereby
reducing mortalities caused by an ongoing set of
institutional inequities.
That said, some organizations have
attempted to create healthcare resource allocation
methods using descriptive statistics. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) created the
social vulnerability index (SVI), allowing the
healthcare community to see which factors
contribute to socioeconomic vulnerability. The
CDC SVI factors are grouped into 4 groups:
Socioeconomic status, Household Composition &

Disability, Minority Status & Language, and
Housing Type & Transportation. Although these
factors are crucial inputs in identifying specific
vulnerable communities, these four categories of
factors alone are not sufficient to create the types of
predictive models that state and local healthcare
agencies can use. One example of this insufficiency
is a recent study at Emory University where
researchers identified correlations between COVID19 mortalities and the SVI at a national level in the
US2. While this study is helpful, it stopped short of
recommending methods or processes to effectively
distribute healthcare resources to specific counties
in the US, particularly in the early days of a
pandemic. Another study from the Surgo
Foundation states that COVID-19 created new
challenges for many communities with a
dependence on health and structural factors, which
are not completely captured by the CDC SVI 16. In
addition to the four socioeconomic factors provided
by the CDC, the Surgo Foundation added two more
factors: Epidemiologic Factors and Healthcare
System Factors. Underlying health conditions in
addition to healthcare system factors have been
proven to greatly enhance a community’s
vulnerability during a pandemic. The Surgo
Foundation combined these two factors with the
CDC SVI to create the COVID-19 Community
Vulnerability Index (CCVI). The Surgo Foundation
has created heatmaps to show retrospectively which
counties were most vulnerable as measured by their
CCVI. Similar to the Emory University study
however, this methodology did not create a
predictive model to identify where the mortalities
would be highest at peak periods in a pandemic. We
also compared the Surgo Foundation heatmap to
our own predictive model rankings and confirmed
that our projections of the top counties by per capita
mortalities were far closer to reality.

V. CONCLUSIONS

Fig. 14 Comparison to Surgo Foundation Heatmap CCVI rankings

During the early phases of the research described
in this manuscript, we used the CDC’s SVI, similar
to the Emory University study. We explored all of
the sub-category factors in the SVI, but none
showed strong correlations at a FIPS county level
across the US. We then grouped states together by
region and found strong correlations in the most
densely populated regions, particularly with the
minority status sub-factors. Similar to the Surgo
Foundation study, we posited that the CDC’s SVI
subfactors alone would be insufficient to build
predictive models, so a far more complete
independent variable dataset of socioeconomic and
healthcare data was sourced from
countyhealthrankings.org as discussed earlier. The
key differentiation of our work are the predictive
models for each state given the local differences in
how each of the factors act as predictors of peak
COVID-19 per capita mortalities. Our experience
in meeting with the Pennsylvania Department of
Health in early June 2020 confirms the uniqueness
and usefulness of the approach given that they will
be using the predictive modelling process for
healthcare resource allocations in the event of a
potential second wave of COVID-19 in the Fall of
2020. Other state level departments of health were
similarly intrigued by our predictive approach
including those in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut.
Limitations
The models employed in the analyses are reliant
on the accuracy of the datasets compiled. COVID19 mortality data in particular has been notoriously
difficult for states to report accurately at a county
level throughout the pandemic for reasons including
mortality cause classification errors at local
coroner’s offices 17.

Our modelling process can be used to identify
early in future pandemics or health crises, the
communities most in need of healthcare resources.
The COVID-19 models and the overall methodology
have been received with enthusiasm by the New
York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts,
Louisiana, Michigan and Pennsylvania Departments
of Health.
