Abstract:
SARS-CoV-2 detection is mainly performed by RT-PCR but recently serological tests were made available.
A first one month follow-up of the SARS-CoV-2 serology records was performed in our laboratory to
precise the diversity and proportion of the SARS-CoV-2 serology test indications and to identify new valid
indications (meningoencephalitis, vasculitis, …)

Introduction:
A new coronavirus was discovered late in 2019 following an unusual number of pneumonia in the city of
Wuhan in China. This virus was named SARS-CoV-2 and the disease was named Coronavirus Disease 2019
(CoVID-19) (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/27-04-2020-who-timeline---covid-19). This pandemic
arrived in Switzerland on 25th February 2020. On 18th May 2020, as many as 31’218 persons were documented
with a SARS-CoV-2 infection causing 1956 deaths in Switzerland, whereas in Vaud county, where our
university hospital is located, 5413 cases were documented with 420 deaths (www.corona-data.ch).
Detection of the SARS-CoV-2 was mainly performed by PCR on nasopharyngeal swab during the acute phase
of the disease [1, 2]. Recently, commercial serological tests were available allowing the determination of the
serostatus of patients [3]. The SARS-CoV-2 serology was implemented and used for patients care since 14th
April 2020 in our laboratory of microbiology located at the “Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois ”
(CHUV).
Initially, only few indications were recognized by public health authorities, but we rapidly extended these
indications to include the list detailed in Table 1. Our laboratory performed a prospective surveillance of the
SARS-CoV-2 serologic test requested during the first 5 weeks, by specifically looking at rate of the different
accepted indications. We also prospectively checked for a sudden increase in testing requests from a specific
ward of our university hospital and/or from a tertiary hospital, a private clinic or a specific private practitioner.
Finally, we also identified prospectively new valid indications.
The aims of this work were (i) to precise the diversity and proportion of indications for the SARS-CoV-2
serological test and (ii) to report any deviation of its usage.

Results :
From the 14th April 2020 to 18th May 2020, 686 SARS-CoV-2 serological tests were performed in our
laboratory using the Epitope Diagnostics IgG ELISA (San Diego, CA). Twenty-nine (4%) were prescribed by
private practitioners, 303 (44%) by hospital-based physicians working in tertiary hospitals or clinics, and 354
(52%) by physicians of our institution. These tests were performed on 602 patients, including 367 female
subjects (61%) from 0 to 89 years old, and 235 male persons (39%) from 1 to 96 years old. On the 686
serological tests performed 159 were positive (23%), 522 were negative (76%), and five were undetermined
(3%). Among the 28 serologies prescribed by private practitioners, five were positive (18%) and 23 were
negative (82%). For the 303 serologies requested by hospital-based physicians working in tertiary hospitals or
clinics, 94 were positive (31%), 205 were negative (68%), and four were undetermined (13%). Finally, for the
354 serological tests from clinicians working at CHUV, 59 were positive (17%), 294 were negative (83%) and
one was undetermined (<1%). Initially, we observed that tertiary hospital B sent more serology analyses than
expected. They had specific directives in their hospital to systematically perform a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR
screening and serology to any patient arriving at the hospital. This practice being not in accordance with the

county directives, we notified this to the hospital B physicians. Then, starting from week three, we did not
observe any specific prescription-related pattern (Figure 1).
Regarding the non-CHUV serological requests, we decided to focus only on the clinical information available
on the laboratory request form. Only 22 (6.6%) of 332 serological requests contained such information.
Fourteen serological tests were performed for patients with indication N°1 (SARS symptoms with > 2 negative
RT-PCR), one with indication N°2 (discordant RT-PCR), one with indication N°4.4 (vulnerable subjects:
hypertension & obesity), three with indication N°5 (specific clinical presentation) including one with Guilla inBarré syndrome, one with indication N°6.1 (personal interest) and two with indication N° 6.4 (residual
symptoms but who had no RT-PCR results available). Noteworthy, there was no indication of serology for 22
(6.6%) of the 332 requested serologies, as they already had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, all coming from
tertiary hospital B. This was due to the hospital B directive to systematically screen any incoming patient by
RT-PCR and serology, to ideally increase the overall screening sensitivity. Noteworthy, the serology result
can only be used to confirm an infection and not to assess the protection of the patient, since no clear
relationship between the serostatus and the protection against a new infection by the SARS-CoV-2 was
established. Therefore the serology was useless for these 22 cases, since a positive RT-PCR is clearly sufficient
to prove the infection.
The 354 CHUV requests correspond to 313 patients. Among those 313 patients, 54 (17.2%) had a positive
SARS-CoV-2 serology. A medical doctor recorded a date of symptoms onset for 42 of them. We could thus
determine that the time between symptoms onset and serology requests was between 4 to 61 days, with a mean
at 27 days, and a median at 25 days. On the 313 CHUV patients, 241 (77%) had a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR
performed, including 46 (19%) with a positive RT-PCRs. On average, the serology was requested 10.8 days
after the RT-PCR. This period is longer for 43 patients with a positive serology (20.8 days on average), and
shorter for the 198 patients with a negative serology (8.9 days on average), as expected. Based on these results,
when initially negative, we now systematically recommend the repetition of the serology two weeks later,
especially when the first serology is done <15 days after symptoms onset. Indeed, in our hands, the Epitope
Diagnostics test reached 96% sensitivity on sera taken ≥15 days after symptoms onset from hospitalize d
patients with mild to severe symptoms [4].
For the 354 CHUV requests, an indication was determined from the electronic medical record of all patients
except eight, and these indications, as well as their relative proportions and results are summarized in Figure
2. Clearly, the majority of the requests (49%) concerned vulnerable patients (indication N°4), regardless of
their symptoms (Figure 2A). Among vulnerable patients, pregnant women represented about half of the
requests (52%), followed by oncological cases (37%). Transplanted or other immunosuppressed patients
represented only 8% and 3%, respectively, of the vulnerable subjects (Figure 2B). The second most frequent
indication was SARS symptoms with two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCRs (indication N°1),
corresponding to 21% of the requests (Figure 2A). In third position are requests with either “specific clinical

presentation” (indication N°5) or “other type of indications” (indication N°6; Figure 2). Among requests due
to “specific clinical presentation”, patients of dermatology with skin vasculitis or endothelitis, and patients
with suspected Guillain-Barré syndrome were the most frequent and represented 44% and 22% of these
requests, respectively (Figure 2C). Interestingly, among requests for “other type of indications” (N°6), patients
with residuals symptoms but without RT-PCR or a negative RT-PCR performed at the acute phase of the
disease (indication N°6.4) represented 62.5% of this category, and 5% of all 354 requests (Figure 2D). The
residuals symptoms with no documented or negative RT-PCR (indication N°6.4) appeared to be very
important for patient care but was totally unexpected, since on 14th April, when we started the SARS-CoV-2
serology, the occurrence of such post-infectious complications were not yet reported [5]. Today, such late
complications appear to be common and typical of COVID-19 [6-8].
One of the main limitation of this work is the short studied period, which do not include possible much later
onset complications, necessitating a serological investigation. Some of the indications that we expected such
as (i) investigation of thrombo-embolic events, and (ii) investigations of chronic fatigue syndrome were not
recorded, likely due to the relatively small number of subjects, the lack of information for most serologies
requested by private practitioners and the early timing of this work, as compared to the outbreak reducing the
number of cases with late complications. Thus, this work should be extended over the next 6 to 12 months.

Overall, this work demonstrates the good adequacy of serological requests. Indeed, at least the in-hospita l
doctors largely complied with in-house guidelines and did not sent serology requests only for scientific interest
or personal interest. This work may serve as a seed for international guidelines regarding the indications of
SARS-CoV-2 serology for patients care.
