Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for follow-up studies regarding the effectiveness of BNT162b2 mRNA
Covid-19 Vaccine without any language restrictions. The search terms were (BNT162b2 OR
mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine) AND (effectiveness OR real-world OR phase IV) until Jan 15,
2021. We found no relevant observational studies among humans. We also assessed Phase II
and Phase III clinical trials with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first and largest phase IV study on the effectiveness of the
BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in real-world settings. Our findings showed that the
first dose of the vaccine is associated with an approximately 51% reduction in the incidence of
PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections at 13 to 24 days after immunization compared to the
rate during the first 12 days. Similar levels of effectiveness were found across age groups, sex,
as well as among individuals residing in Arab or ultra-orthodox Jewish communities that
display an increased COVID-19 risk.
Implications of all the available evidence
The study results indicate that in real life the first dose of the new BNT162b2 mRNA COVID19 vaccine confers around 50% protection against overall SARS-CoV-2 infections
(symptomatic or asymptomatic). Together our findings and the 95% efficacy shown in the
phase III trial, suggest that the BNT162b2 vaccine should be administered in two doses to
achieve maximum protection and impact in terms of disease burden reduction and possibly
reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. COVID-19 vaccines should be urgently deployed
globally.

Abstract
Background
BNT162b2 vaccines showed high efficacy against COVID-19 in a randomised controlled
phase-III trial. A vaccine effectiveness evaluation in real life settings is urgently needed,
especially given the global disease surge. Hence, we assessed the short-term effectiveness of
the first dose of BNT162b2-vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the BNT162b2
Phase-III results, we hypothesized that the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection
among vaccinees will decline after 12 days following immunization compared to the incidence
during the preceding days.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from 2·6 million-member state-mandated
health provider in Israel. Study population consisted of all members aged 16 or above years
who were vaccinated with BNT162b2-vaccine between December/19/2020 and
January/15/2021. We collected information regarding medical history and positive SARSCoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test from days after first dose to January/17/2021. Daily and
cumulative infection rates in days 13-24 were compared to days 1-12 after first dose using
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and generalized linear models.
Findings
Data of 503,875 individuals (mean age 59·7 years SD=14·7, 47·8% males) were analysed, of
whom 351,897 had 13-24 days of follow-up. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2
infection was 0·57% (n=2484) during days 1-12 and 0·27% (n=614) in days 13-24. A 51·4%
relative risk reduction (RRR) was calculated in weighted-average daily incidence of SARSCoV-2 infection from 43·41-per-100,000(SE=12·07) in days 1-12 to 21·08-per100,000(SE=6·16) in days 13-24 following immunization. The decrement in incidence was
evident from day 18 after first dose. Similar RRRs were calculated in individuals aged 60 or

above (44.5%), younger individuals (50.2%), females (50.0%) and males (52.1%). Findings
were similar in sub-populations and patients with various comorbidities.
Conclusions
We demonstrated an effectiveness of 51% of BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2
infection 13-24 days after immunization with the first dose. Immunization with the second dose
should be continued to attain the anticipated protection.

Introduction
The recently authorized BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine has demonstrated 95% efficacy in
preventing COVID-19 with the two-dose regimen in phase III randomized placebo-controlled
trial (RCT), with the second dose given 21 days after the first vaccine dose [1]. The protection
of the vaccine against the disease was already evident 12 days after the first dose. The
European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved the BNT162b2 emergency use using two
doses separated by at least 21 days[2].
In light of the peaking outbreak of COVID-19, the UK authorities decided to vaccinate a large
number of at-risk people in the shortest possible time by postponing the second dose towards
the end of the recommended vaccine dosing schedule of 12 weeks[3]. The same immunization
approach is also contemplated in other countries and by the World Health Organisation (WHO)
in view of limited doses of vaccine available to date for mass vaccination [4]. Accordingly,
there is an urgent global need to understand the real-world short-term effectiveness of the
vaccine after the first dose.
The BNT162b2 RCT showed vaccine efficacy of 52% (95% Confidence intervals [CI] 29·5 to
68·4) after immunization with the first dose. This is comparable with the minimal acceptable
level of efficacy of 50% in preventing COVID-19 as indicated by the WHO [5] and by the US
Food and Drug Administration [6] as one of the essential criteria to confer Emergency Use
Approval (EUA) to COVID-19 candidate vaccines. However, the effectiveness of the new
vaccine in protecting against infection is difficult to assess in phase III clinical trials. Instead, it
requires large phase IV studies in real-world settings where the vaccine is widely deployed [5].
Moreover, the lack of systematic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinees and placebo
recipients as part of the protocol leaves important gaps in knowledge regarding the vaccine
efficacy in preventing asymptomatic infection and consequent viral transmission. Moreover,
assessment of the vaccine effectiveness outside clinical trial setting, in real life, is warranted

especially given the complex and unusual storage and handling requirements of BNT1622b2
vaccine.
In Israel, vaccination against coronavirus using BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine started on
December 19, 2020, with priority given to individuals over 60 years old, healthcare workers,
and clinically-vulnerable patients. As of January 15, 2021, Israel ranks first in vaccination
doses with 25·3 per 100-capita [7]. The aim of this study is to assess the short-term
effectiveness of one dose of BNT162b2 vaccine in reducing infection with SARS-CoV-2 in
real-world settings. In light of the RCT results, our hypothesis was that the cumulative
incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals who received BNT162b2 vaccine will
decline after 12 days following immunization compared to the incidence during the preceding
1-12 days.

Methods
Study design and data sources
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from a single healthcare provider to
estimate the short-term effectiveness of the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS2-CoV-2 infection. Data sources were the central databases of Maccabi Healthcare Services
(MHS). MHS is a 2·6 million-member state-mandated, not-for-profit, sick fund in Israel,
representing a quarter of the Israeli population. Membership in sick funds is compulsory in
Israel, and by the National Health Insurance Law of 1994, all citizens must freely choose one of
four national sick funds that are prohibited by law from denying membership to any Israeli
resident. The dataset included extensive demographic data, anthropometric measurements,
clinic and hospital diagnoses, medication dispensed, and comprehensive laboratory data from a
single central laboratory. In Israel, everyone is assigned a unique person-specific alphanumeric
identifier called a National Health Index Number, which is used across all health systems,
including in these datasets, thereby enabling data linkage.

We used data linkage to assign vaccine exposure, collect information regarding medical history
and positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test [8]. PCR tests for SARSCoV-2 are obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs. PCR testing is offered for all citizens free of
charge, mostly without a need for referral.
We obtained ethical approval from Maccabi Healthcare Services Ethics Committee.
Study population and endpoint
Our study population consisted of all MHS members aged 16 or above years who were
vaccinated during a mass immunization program from December 19, 2020, to January 15, 2021
(inclusive). We used as reference the results of the phase III [1] that provide experimental
evidence that the BNT162b2 vaccine conferred no or little protection against SARS-CoV-2
infection until day 12 post vaccination with the first dose. Therefore, we calculated cumulative
incidence of infection in days 13 to 24 as compared to days one to 12 post vaccination with the
first dose. Index day was thus defined as day one after first dose, for days one to 12 cohort and
day 13 for days 13 to 24 cohort. Follow-up for infection started from index date and lasted until
the date of first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result, death, leaving MHS, January 17, 2021, or 12
days after index date. SARS-CoV-2 infection case definition was having at least one record of
primary positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test in the MHS databases. Excluded from analysis were
patients who had a documented positive SARS-CoV-2 (n=2,022) prior to index date or
individuals who joined MHS after February 2020 and therefore have an incomplete medical
history (n=6389).
Additional variables
Individual-level clinical and demographic data on study cohort were collected from MHS
central datasets. This included age at index date, sex, body mass index (BMI) as well as data on
underlying diseases from computerized registries including cancer, immunocompromised
conditions, diabetes [9], cardiovascular diseases [10], and hypertension [11]. The
socioeconomic status (SES) index of member's enumeration area is based on several

parameters including household income, educational qualifications, household crowding,
material conditions, and car ownership. Further information on participants’ residential area,
including characterization of ultraorthodox Jewish or Arab communities was collected. These
variables were selected based on the local epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in
Israel showing higher incidence in ultraorthodox and Arab communities compared to the
general population, and in low vs. high SES communities.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as means (standards deviations [SD]) and medians
(range). Categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages. Cumulative
incidence plots of SARS-Cov-2 infection were created using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
and compared with the log-rank test. The comparison of the incidence of PCR-confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection between the two study periods, 1-12 and 13-24 days following to
immunization with BNT162b2 vaccine was first estimated using a generalized linear models
(GLM), applying a negative-binomial distribution with a log-link and log-time-at-risk as an
offset. The offset was used to scale the counts of SARS-CoV-2 infections to daily incidence,
expressed as cases per 100,000. The dependent variable was the number of SARS-CoV-2 per
day during the 12 days of the follow-up for each group. Independent variables were sex and age
category. Vaccine effectiveness was defined as infection relative risk reduction (RRR) and
calculated as: (1 – relative risk) × 100. Analyses were stratified by age, sex, ultraorthodox
Jewish sector/community status, and comorbid condition.
The incidence of COVID-19 in Israel has changed during the study period. Although Israel has
been under lockdown during the study period, according to the Israel Ministry of Health data
[12] there was a 33·7% increase in the number of laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases in
adults from week 52/20 to 53/20 and a 35.7% increase between week 53/20 and 01/21. Since
the study groups distributed differently along the calendar time, this may have attenuated our
estimates of vaccine effectiveness. Therefore, sensitivity analyses included omitting first and

last calendar week and censoring at second dose of vaccine. Patient with a positive SARSCoV-2 test after first dose are recommended to postpone their second dose. In order to avoid a
potential selection bias we therefore did not censor the follow-up period at date of second dose.
All analyses were done using IBM-SPSS Version 27 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp) and R
packages magrittr, readtext, dplyr, ggplot2, tidyverse, survival, and survminer.
Role of the funding source
There was no external funding for this analysis.

Findings
Data of 503,875 individuals (mean age 59·7 years [SD=14·7], 47·8% males) were analysed of
whom 351,897 had between 13 to 24 days of follow-up after first dose (Table 1). The total
population accounts for 26% of the MHS members aged 16 or above. During the follow-up
period 49,814 (9·9%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2.
During the study period a total of 3098 incident cases of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection were identified with a cumulative risk of 0.84% (figure 1), with 0·57% (n=2484)
occurring during the first follow-up period (days 1-12) and 0·27% (n=614) during the second
follow-up period (days 13-24) (Figure 2). The significant decrement in incidence was evident
from day 18 after first dose. Using GLM, a RRR of 51·4% (95% CI -7·2% to 78·0%) was
calculated with weighted average daily incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection declining from
43·41 per 100,000 (SE=12·07) in days 1 to 12 to 21·08 (SE=6·16) in days 13 to 24 following
immunization with first dose. Similar findings were seen in stratified analyses by age group
(RRR=44·5% in individuals aged 60 years or above vs. 50·2% in individuals aged under 60
years), sex (50·0% in females vs. 52·1% in males), and Jewish ultraorthodox communities
(53·5%), as well as when first and last calendar weeks were omitted from the analysis (Figure
3).

In this analysis of real-world data, we demonstrated an effectiveness of approximately 51% of
the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in reducing the risk of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
13 to 24 days after immunization with the first dose compared the preceding 1-12 days. While
our effectiveness estimate is comparable to the 52% efficacy in preventing COVID-19
calculated in the phase III RCT with BNT162b2[1], there are major differences in interpreting
these findings. First, unlike in the RCT, our assessment of vaccine effectiveness relates to days
13 to 24 after first dose whereas the vast majority of cases in the trial occurred earlier. In fact,
only two cases were diagnosed between days 14 and 21 days in the vaccinees compared to 18
incident cases in the placebo arm, thus suggesting an efficacy of 89%. Second, our case
definition was positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test irrespective to presenting symptoms that
defined COVID-19 cases in the RCT. This might explain the discrepancy in results.
Interestingly, the BNT162b2 vaccine (at 30 mcg, the same dose used in the efficacy study),
induced only a modest level of neutralizing antibodies in volunteers aged 18-55 and even lower
in volunteers aged 65-85 after the first injection as measured on day 21 of the safety and
immunogenicity study [13]. If extrapolated to our estimation of vaccine effectiveness, the
immunogenicity data may suggest that these levels of neutralizing antibodies were associated
with 90% protective efficacy against COVID-19 and with only around 50% protection against
SARS-CoV-2 overall infections 12 to 21 days after immunization with first dose of the
BNT162b2 vaccine. Analogically, the very good neutralizing antibody response after the 21
day booster as shown in the immunogenicity study [13] are encouraging suggesting a very good
chance for high level protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection as well after immunization with
the second dose. It is possible that this very robust systemic functional response 7 days after the
second intramuscular injection of BNT162b2 (but not after a single injection) is paralleled by a
significant local immune response including both IgG of systemic origin and sIgA, with
potential positive implications in prevention of virus transmission. Potent intramuscularly
administered conjugate vaccines against bacterial pathogens of the respiratory tract such as

Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae conjugate were shown to be
effective against invasive disease as well as against carriage of serotypes included in the
corresponding vaccine formulation[14-17] leading to dramatic direct and indirect protection.
Continuing assessment of effectiveness in parallel with serological and virological data in our
setting can confirm or refute this assumption and support the evaluation of neutralizing
antibodies as correlates of protection against COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic
infection.
The somewhat lower effectiveness calculated among patients with diabetes is intriguing,
particularly in light of a previous reports on impaired immunologic response after seasonal
influenza vaccines among patients with diabetes or treated with anti-diabetic medications

[18],

Our findings of 51% effectiveness against PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection 12 days
after immunization with first dose of BNT162b2 in comparison with day 1-12 after vaccine
exposure might be an underestimation of the vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19.
Nonetheless, our study provides critically needed evidence on the early performance of
BNT162b2 vaccine in real life, and has some important implications in decision making to
prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and control the epidemic. While these results are
encouraging, the BNT162b2 vaccine should be administered in two dose regimen 21 days apart
as licensed for EUA, to achieve maximum protection and impact in reducing COVID-19
devastating burden and possibly the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Our study has several strengths. The automated data collection of vaccination status and
laboratory results that are offered to all citizens free of charge, allowed us to comprehensively
explore vaccine effectives with minimal threat of information bias characterizing studies
relying on self-reported diagnosis. By comparing only vaccinated individuals in different time
intervals after immunization, we minimized potential selection and indication bias that may
stem from comparing vaccinated vs. unvaccinated [19] or test-negative studies [20].

This study also has limitations. In addition, in this database analysis we did not assess COVID19 symptoms and complications and therefore we were unable to assess effectiveness in
protecting against COVID-19. Unreported vaccination is another potential limitation; however,
the total number of vaccinated individuals by 1/15/21 in our analysis accounts for
approximately 25% [21] of the total number of vaccinated Israelis on 1/15/21 that is
comparable to the market share of MHS, leaving little room for significant gap in data.
In conclusion, in this analysis of large-scale real-world data, we showed approximately 51%
effectiveness of BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine against PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection
13-24 days after immunization with the first dose using the preceding 1-12 days as a reference.
This estimate was consistent across age, sex, sector, or comorbidity, except for diabetes. These
findings have global public health implications and open new horizons towards the control of
COVID-19 pandemic and reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Global effort should
accelerate COVID-19 vaccines deployment urgently.
