ABSTRACT
Accurate SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is essential to guide prevention and control of COVID-19. From January
11 – April 22, 2020, Public Health Ontario conducted SARS-CoV-2 testing of 86,942 specimens collected
from 80,354 individuals, primarily using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRTPCR) methods. We analyzed test results across specimen types and for individuals with multiple sameday and multi-day collected specimens. Nasopharyngeal compared to throat swabs had a higher
positivity (8.8% vs. 4.8%) and an adjusted estimate 2.9 Ct lower (SE=0.5, p<0.001). Same-day specimens
showed high concordance (98.8%), and the median Ct of multi-day specimens increased over time.
Symptomatic cases had rRT-PCR results with an adjusted estimate 3.0 Ct (SE=0.5, p<0.001) lower than
asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic cases. Overall test sensitivity was 84.6%, with a negative predictive
value of 95.5%. Molecular testing is the mainstay of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and testing protocols will
continue to be dynamic and iteratively modified as more is learned about this emerging pathogen.

INTRODUCTION
As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads globally, specific,
rapid, and reliable diagnostic tests are essential to minimise spread through timely contact investigation
and isolation of infected individuals. Rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is currently the standard testing method for coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis(1). rRT-PCR has been used to detect SARS-CoV-2 from upper respiratory
specimens such as nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), throat swabs (TS), and saliva(2,3), lower respiratory
specimens such as sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, and in some cases non-respiratory specimens(4).
Early studies detected higher viral loads in respiratory over non-respiratory specimens(5), with NPS
currently the recommended specimen type(6). Viral loads are typically highest early in the course of
illness and decrease after approximately 10-14 days following symptom onset, as reflected in rRT-PCR
results at or near the limit of detection(6–8).
Diagnostic challenges have arisen as SARS-CoV-2 has been detected across a range of disease
manifestations, including pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, and atypical presentations(5,9,10). Presently,
there is limited information regarding the association between patient demographics, clinical
presentation, viral load and SARS-CoV-2 detection, particularly with respect to serial testing over time.
More studies are needed to inform the optimal protocol for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing.
Here, we examine SARS-CoV-2 molecular-based test performance characteristics and summarize
case-level data related to COVID-19 diagnosis. We analyze rRT-PCR test results across different
specimens collected over single and multiple days for individuals. As testing protocols have been
dynamic and iteratively modified among laboratories, our study findings will inform the further
development and refinement of molecular-based testing and related testing algorithms.

MATERIALS and METHODS
Study Setting and Design
As the provincial reference laboratory, Public Health Ontario (PHO) conducts a large proportion
of SARS-CoV-2 testing for Ontario, Canada. During the initial stage of the pandemic, all specimens
collected from individuals across the province were submitted to PHO. After March 11, 2020, testing in
Ontario was decentralized to increase capacity, and a number of hospital and private laboratories
implemented SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing. Included in this study were all specimens received for
SARS-CoV-2 routine testing by PHO from January 11, 2020 through April 22, 2020.

Specimen Collection
Specimens submitted to PHO included upper respiratory specimens such as nasopharyngeal,
nasal, and throat swabs, lower respiratory specimens (e.g. sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, lung tissue),
and non-respiratory specimens (e.g. blood, stool). Upon collection, swabs were placed in transport
media and sent to PHO for processing(11). Initially, collection of 2 specimens from different upper
respiratory sites was recommended, which was later revised to a single specimen due to high demand
for swabs.

Data Collection
Demographic, epidemiological and clinical data were abstracted from PHO test requisitions. To
reflect changing knowledge regarding COVID-19, these requisitions were updated on several occasions
(see Supplementary Figure S1 for key changes in testing guidelines). Information was recorded at the
time of specimen collection and included demographics, healthcare setting, self-reported
symptoms(12), and reasons for testing such as travel history and contact with a known or probable
COVID-19 case. Specimen type was also recorded. It should be noted that initial requisition versions

provided a nasopharyngeal checkbox but not a separate nasal swab option, therefore NPS described
herein may represent a compilation of nasal, mid-turbinate and NPS specimens.

Molecular-based Detection of SARS-CoV-2
Several methods of SARS-CoV-2 detection were implemented over the first few months of the
pandemic as newly developed tests and platforms became available. Initially, a nested end-point PCR
was used targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene(13)(Supplementary
Appendix I) followed by Sanger sequencing using standard methods. Early specimens were also sent to
Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) for secondary confirmation and supplementary
testing using various NML-developed molecular-based assays. Next, an rRT-PCR laboratory developed
test (LDT) was used for detection of the Sarbecovirus subgenus envelope (E) gene and/or SARS-CoV-2
RdRp gene based on Corman et al.(14) primer and probe sequences. Interpretation of the LDT rRT-PCR
cycle threshold (Ct) was as follows: Ct ≤38 was categorized as detected (positive), 38.1 – 39.9 was
indeterminate, and a Ct ≥40 was not detected (negative). Initially, the testing algorithm required
detection of both targets for laboratory confirmation. This was later revised to single target detection
for COVID-19 diagnosis using the E-gene target alone. As of mid-March, to increase laboratory capacity,
a commercial rRT-PCR assay, cobas® SARS-CoV-2 (Roche Diagnostics, Germany) was introduced, which
includes E-gene and ORF1ab targets. Specimens tested using the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR assay were
reported as detected (positive) or not detected (negative); the manufacturer does not include an
indeterminate category. Uninterpretable results for any test method were reported as invalid. For
further details of RNA extraction, PCR protocols and test result definitions see Supplementary Appendix
I. Ct values reported herein were based on E-gene test results, as this was the common target used in
both the LDT and cobas® SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR assays.

Data Analysis
Demographic and clinical information were summarised at an individual-level. For persons with
multiple same-day collected specimens, any positive result was considered a positive for that day.
Collection day was counted from the first date (day 1) of specimen(s) collected for an individual. Missing
collection dates were substituted with laboratory login dates as the mean difference between these was
1 day (data not shown). A testing episode was defined as the overall result for an individual on a
collection day.

Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed in R (v4.0.2). Categorical variables were summarized
using frequency and percentage with comparison of positive and negative test results for study variables
measured using the chi-square (χ2) test. Non-normally distributed continuous variables were
summarized using median and interquartile range (IQR) with differences assessed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test, and Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired samples. A generalised
linear regression model was used to examine Ct values with standard error (SE) of NPS and TS adjusted
for symptom status, age and gender. Unless otherwise stated indeterminate results were counted as
positives.

RESULTS
Study Sample Characteristics
A total of 86,942 specimens with valid test results were collected from 80,354 individuals and
received at PHO from January 11, 2020 through April 22, 2020 (Figure 1). This represents 47% of the
more than 184,000 SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests completed in Ontario during this period(15). Overall,

6,834 individuals (8.5%) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. The median age of individuals with a
positive test was 72 years (IQR 50–87), significantly higher (p<0.001) than individuals with a negative
test, median age 54 years (IQR 36–77)(Table 1). The largest proportion of cases was observed in the 80–
89 year age group (22.5%) and amongst females (57.1%). Reasons for testing were recorded at the time
of specimen collection, and of all positive cases, 4,650 (68.0%) had COVID-19 symptoms, 747 (10.9%)
had international travel history, and 646 (9.5%) had contact with a known or probable COVID-19 case.
Of these reasons, case contact had a higher likelihood for association with a positive result.
Characteristics of persons with invalid results (n=145) can be seen in Supplementary Table S1.
The number of specimens received for testing increased as the pandemic evolved, with more
than 4,000 specimens tested per day on several days in April (Figure 2). Supply chain issues limiting the
availability of reagents in late-March are reflected in the decreased number of specimens collected and
tested at that time. As testing continued, we observed an increase in the proportion of outbreakassociated specimens, and by the study end date, more than 50% of positive specimens were linked to
an outbreak investigation (Figure 2).

Test Performance Characteristics
The majority (99.0%, n=86,071) of specimens were tested with a single assay, the largest
number of which were tested using the LDT rRT-PCR assay (n=56,928) or cobas® SARS-CoV-2 assay
(n=29,141) (Supplementary Table S3). Concordant results were observed for 831 (95.4%) specimens
tested using multiple assays. Of the 23 specimens with discordant results, 19 had negative end-point
PCR results, and where rRT-PCR had also been performed a median of Ct 36.2 (IQR 34.4–36.9) was
observed. For the remaining 4 discordants, 3 represented negative NML-referred test results and 1
negative LDT result. Details of the discordant results and other test related data can be found in
Supplementary Appendix I.

Comparison of Specimen Types
Of 86,942 specimens included in the study, 7,538 (8.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The
median Ct across all assays for the first positive specimen of each case was 24.3 (IQR 19.6–30.4). Upper
respiratory specimens accounted for nearly all specimens submitted (98.8%, n=85,889), the majority
(94.0%) of which were NPS (n=81,765)(Table 2). For respiratory specimens, NPS had the highest
proportion of positives (8.8%) compared to TS (4.8% positive). Furthermore, initial NPS-positive
specimens were estimated to have a Ct 2.9 (SE=0.5, p<0.001) lower than initial TS-positive specimens
after adjusting for symptom status, age and gender (Table 3). Lower respiratory specimens such as
bronchoalveolar lavage, lung tissue, and sputum, accounted for 0.5% of all specimens. Of the 422 lower
respiratory specimens, 38 (9.0%) tested positive with a median Ct value of 27.0 (IQR 22.7–33.4). Nonrespiratory specimens such as cerebral spinal fluid, autopsy tissues, and whole blood, were uncommon
(0.01% of all specimens, n=13), and only a single non-respiratory specimen (stool – the only one
submitted during the study period) tested positive (Ct 31.9).

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 with Repeated Sampling
We analyzed the results of 5,575 individuals with multiple specimens submitted to provide
insight to same-day and multi-day sampling (Figure 1). The majority of individuals (86.8%, n=4,837) had
2 specimens collected (Supplementary Table S7). Amongst individuals with multiple specimens, 2,632
(45.4%) had all specimens collected on a single day, and 2,874 (49.6%) had one or more specimen
collected over a 1–60 day interval. There were 288 (5.0%) individuals with both multiple same-day and
multi-day specimens collected.

Same-day Collected Specimens
We identified 2,920 individuals with multiple specimens collected on the same day (Figure 1),
resulting in 3,024 multi-specimen testing episodes. Concordant results between same-day specimens
were observed for 2,987 (98.8%) multi-specimen testing episodes, of which 105 (3.5%) were positive for
all specimens and 2,882 (96.5%) were negative for all specimens. Discordant results between same-day
specimens were seen for 37 of 3,024 (1.2%) testing episodes, of these 35 were discordant
positive/negative results, 1 positive/indeterminate and 1 negative/indeterminate result. Specimen types
and test results are categorized in Supplementary Table S8.
Within the 105 concordant same-day positive results, there were 26 NPS pairs. For these pairs
the overall median Ct was 24.8 (IQR 19.0–32.0), and median Ct difference between NPS paired swabs
was 1.8 (IQR 0.8–3.7)(Figure 3). Additionally, there were 72 episodes of same-day NPS/TS pairs with
concordant results, for which the TS generally had a higher Ct (median difference 3.0 Ct, IQR -0.6–6.3,
p<0.001)(Figure 3).
Examination of discordant results revealed 12 NPS specimen pairs (median Ct 35.7, IQR 24.1–
37.2), 16 NPS-positive/TS-negative pairs (median Ct 35.0, IQR 34.0–36.3), 7 NPS-negative/TS-positive
pairs (median Ct 33.8, IQR 32.0–34.0), 1 NPS-positive/TS-indeterminate pair (NPS Ct 36.8, TS Ct
unavailable) and 1 NPS-positive/sputum-negative pair (Ct 31.2). One individual had 5 specimens
collected on the same day with discordant results – 2 TS-negative specimens while the NPS, an
unspecified respiratory swab, and an unspecified specimen type were positive. These specimens were
taken 6 days after the initial collection of positive specimens (NPS and TS) for this individual. Ultimately,
if a single NPS specimen had been collected for the 105 concordant positive pairs and the 37 discordant
pairs, up to 13.4% (19/142) of positive (including indeterminate) testing episodes may have been
reported negative. However, 4 of these were individuals with previous positive results and did not

represent missed diagnoses. Collection of a single TS would have resulted in 16.2% (16 of 99 with a TS
collected) negative testing episodes, 11 of which had previous positive results.

Multi-day Collected Specimens
A total of 2,943 (3.7%) individuals had specimens collected on more than one day. The time
course and result of each of these tests can be found in Supplementary Figure S3. Examining the
demographics of individuals with multi-day specimens we noted that these persons were older (median
73 years, IQR 52–87) compared to individuals with specimens collected at a single time point (median 55
years, IQR: 36–78; p<0.001), and a larger proportion were hospitalized at initial specimen collection
(13.1%, 387/2,943) compared to those with single time-point collection (5.1%, 3,910/77,411; p<0.001).
Furthermore, a larger proportion (39.2%, 1,153/2,943) of individuals with multi-day specimen collection
were linked to an outbreak investigation at initial collection compared to those with single day
specimens (29.1%, 22,495/77,411; p<0.001).
Of the individuals with multi-day collected specimens, 199 initially tested positive and later
tested negative over a period of 1 to 37 days (median 15 days, IQR 15–18). The time course of individual
tests can be viewed in Figure 4A. We also examined Ct over time for persons with multi-day collection
and observed a steady increase in median Ct (Figure 4B). For asymptomatic individuals a higher median
Ct can be seen for the initial specimen collected compared to symptomatic persons. While this
observation was based on a small number of asymptomatic individuals (n=6) with multi-day testing, this
finding was further supported by multiple linear regression using all individuals testing positive in the
study (persons with single and multi-day specimens). Asymptomatic persons had an estimated 3.0 Ct
(SE=0.5, p<0.001) higher compared to symptomatic persons, adjusting for specimen type, age and
gender (Table 3).

Of the 2,360 persons initially testing negative, 255 (10.8%) individuals had a subsequent positive
result (Figure 4C). The median number of days to a positive result was 8 (IQR 6–15) with a median Ct of
24.0 (IQR 18.9–30.6) for the subsequent positive. Under the assumption that a negative result followed
by a positive within 7 days represented an initial false negative finding, we calculated a test sensitivity of
84.6% and negative predictive value of 95.5% (Table 4). Beyond 7 days was considered a discrete
disease episode as viral load typically peaks within this period and the existing literature suggests viral
load and infectivity is diminished within a week following symptom onset(3,16).
We investigated further the characteristics of this negative-to-positive test result group. The
majority (97.2%, n=212/218) of specimens collected were NPS, and of the 174 individuals with symptom
status documented at initial testing, 162 (93.1%) were symptomatic. On the subsequent positive test,
102 (63.0%) remained symptomatic, with 39 of these individuals testing positive within 7 days, and 63
testing positive more than 7 days following initial negative test (Supplementary Table S9). Of note, 10 of
12 asymptomatic individuals on initial negative testing reported symptoms at subsequent positive
testing, averaging 7.2 days (SD±2.1) to positive result. Interestingly, 184 (72.2%) individuals with
negative-to-positive results were tested in relation to an outbreak. On their follow-up positive test, 40
additional individuals had specimens submitted in association with an outbreak where none was
identified on their initial negative test. In the group of negative-to-positive individuals the majority
(85.9%, 219/255) did not have contact to a known/probable case indicated on initial or subsequent
testing. However, 18 persons without previous exposure indicated contact to a known/probable case on
subsequent positive test, with a median of 12.1 days (SD±11.8) from negative result. Additionally, we
reviewed Ct values for positive results following an initial negative, and no clear pattern was observed in
relation to symptom status or time since collection of the initial negative specimen (Figure 4D).

DISCUSSION
Molecular-based testing using nucleic acid amplification techniques are currently the gold
standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection. These methods can provide high sensitivity and quick turnaround
time. Rapid spread of the virus globally created an unprecedented need for increased SARS-CoV-2
diagnostic testing, and consequently a need to establish how and when to best use these tests, and
better interpret the results. In this study, we summarized patient data related to laboratory-based
COVID-19 diagnosis for 6,834 cases and described diagnostic testing characteristics for more than
86,000 individuals and specimens tested by PHO during the first few months of the pandemic.
We analyzed the characteristics of individuals tested for COVID-19, and as per previous
reports(17,18), persons testing positive were more likely to be older, with more than 60% of cases aged
≥60 years. Early in the pandemic testing priority was given for persons of any age having travelled to
specific regions(19). However, recommendations were adjusted as the pandemic evolved with COVID-19
symptoms representing the principal reason for testing overall(20). Of persons reporting symptoms,
only 1 in 8 tested positive, which highlights the non-specific nature of COVID-19 symptoms and a major
challenge of this pandemic(21).
Our findings of higher positivity and lower Ct values for NPS relative to TS is consistent with the
higher clinical sensitivity of NPS reported in the literature(22,23). In accordance with current
recommendations for, and widespread availability of, NPS, most specimens in this study were upper
respiratory. While PHO tested lower respiratory and non-respiratory specimens, these specimen types
represented a small proportion of all specimens tested. Interestingly, sputum had a comparatively high
positivity (12.9%), similar to previous reports(24), and may represent an underutilized specimen type in
situations where it is warranted. However, interpretations of results for rare specimen types should be
made with caution as the reasons for the choice of specimen type collected were not available, and
these individuals may have had a higher pre-test probability(25).

Where multiple specimens were collected on the same day, nearly all results were concordant.
In the small number of cases with discordant results, Ct values were often high and the discordance
likely represents a level of virus beyond the rRT-PCR limit of detection. This may be related to the time
of sampling in the disease course (Ct is lowest within the first week following symptom onset(6)), or
poor sample collection(25,26). Where specimen type differed for same-day collection, NPS were more
often positive, similar to other studies(2,27) further supporting the use of NPS as the preferred
specimen type.
In this study, specimens were collected on different days for nearly 3,000 individuals, with Ct
values increasing over disease course and a higher median Ct for asymptomatic persons compared to
those with symptoms, similar to previous findings(6,7,28). It should be noted that there have also been
reports of similar viral load between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals(6,29). Asymptomatic
individuals without epidemiological risk factors (i.e. low pre-test probability) may in some cases
represent false positive results. Distinguishing between a true asymptomatic case and a high Ct false
positive is a significant diagnostic and public health challenge. Particularly as questions remain regarding
the extent of asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic transmission in the community. False negatives also have
the potential to complicate efforts in controlling SARS-CoV-2, as these individuals – believed not to be
infected – are not directed to isolate and may unknowingly facilitate virus dissemination. In our study,
we identified 255 persons with an initial negative test that at a later date tested positive. Of these,
nearly three-quarters were initially tested in relation to an outbreak. These individuals may have been
truly negative initially – tested as part of screening efforts during an outbreak, and were later exposed
due to continued association with the outbreak setting.
Our study has several limitations. First, reported sensitivity and NPV should be interpreted with
caution as our analysis does not compare two distinct tests, and instead uses an individual’s collective
test results within a 7 day period (“true positive” result) as a comparison for their initial test result.

Therefore, sensitivity was dependent on the time period used as a discrete episode. Current literature
reports a 5 day mean incubation with viral shedding a few days before symptom onset. Thus, we defined
an episode as 7 days following initial specimen collection, and found our calculation of test sensitivity to
be consistent with the literature(2); however, our NPV estimate was higher than other reports(26). As it
is more likely for persons with high pre-test probability to be retested, there may be a bias towards an
underestimation of the true sensitivity. The nature of this method does not allow for calculation of
specificity and PPV. Second, a limitation of many COVID-19 studies at this time, including this one, is that
recommendations regarding who should be tested changed over the study period and may have
impacted which individuals were prioritized for testing. Thus, our results may not be representative of
all cases, particularly asymptomatic or hospitalized individuals, and may not be generalizable to all
locations. Last, drawing conclusions regarding the asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic infected population
is difficult within this study population owing to limited data on test requisitions. For example, timing of
sample collection in disease course (symptom onset date was often not captured, and is not possible for
persons without symptoms) and reason(s) for testing, limited information regarding exposure, and lack
of follow-up testing in most cases.
In conclusion, the present study contributes to the rapidly expanding body of knowledge
regarding SARS-CoV-2 clinical diagnostics. Our results support existing estimates of test sensitivity while
providing further insights into the relationship between Ct and patient-related factors, as well as the
variability between specimen types, multiple same-day and repeat testing. Diagnostics has a key role to
play in the pandemic, contributing to policy and practice regarding individual- and population-level
public health measures used to limit spread of the virus.

Figure 4. Molecular-based test results for individuals with specimens submitted to Public Health Ontario
for SARS-CoV-2 testing, January 11 – April 22, 2020. Any positive result for an individual with multiple
specimens collected on the same-day is displayed as positive, and indeterminate where there was an
indeterminate result and no positive. (A) Pattern of results for individuals initially testing positive (day 1)
with a subsequent negative result at a later date (n=199). Each individual is represented horizontally
across collection days. (B) Median cycle threshold (Ct) by specimen collection day for those with day 1
positive results (n=578). Trend lines were fitted using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS),
with the asymptomatic curve excluding the day 11 outlier. (C) Pattern of results for individuals initially
testing negative (day 1) with a subsequent positive result at a later date (n=255). A threshold 7 days
following initial negative result differentiates episodes. (D) Ct values by day of specimen collection for
the first positive result obtained for an individual with a negative result on initial testing. Testing
included one or more of the following: end-point PCR + Sanger sequencing of RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp) gene, rRT-PCR to detect the envelope (E) gene, RdRp gene and/or ORF1ab.
