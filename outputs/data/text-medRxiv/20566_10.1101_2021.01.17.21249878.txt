Running Title: NEWS2 and laboratory predictors for clinical deterioration in COVID-19
ABSTRACT
Background: We aimed to determine prognostic values of NEWS2 and laboratory parameters
during the first week of COVID-19.
Methods: All adult patients who were hospitalized for a confirmed COVID-19 between the 11th
of March and the 11th of May 2020 were retrospectively included. To evaluate the factors in

prognosis which are admission to intensive care unit (ICU) and in-hospital death, univariate
logistic regression analysis was performed at admission (D0), at day-3 (D3), day-5 (D5), and
day-7 (D7). Additionally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed.
Results: Overall, 611 patients were included. Clinical deterioration was observed in 79 (12.9%)
patients during hospitalisation, 36 (5.9%) during the first three days, 54 (8.8%) during the first
five days, and 62 (10.1%) during the first week of hospitalisation. Our results showed that
NEWS2, procalcitonin, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and albumin were the best predictors
for clinical deterioration at D0, D3, D5, and D7. Procalcitonin had the highest odds ratio for
clinical deterioration on all days in univariate analysis. ROC analyses showed that NEWS2 at
D7, procalcitonin at D5, albumin at D7, and NLR at D5 had highest AUC values. Additionally,
we detected a strong correlation between NEWS2 and laboratory parameters including
neutrophil, lymphocyte, NLR, platelet/lymphocyte ratio, CRP, procalcitonin, ferritin, and urea on
all days.
Conclusion: This study provides a list of several laboratory parameters correlated with NEWS2
and potential predictors for ICU admission or in-hospital death during the clinical course of
COVID-19. Dynamic monitoring of NEWS2 and laboratory parameters is vital for improving
clinical outcomes.
1. INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes high rates of mortality,
morbidity, longer duration of hospitalization and increased need for intensive care unit (ICU)
admission (1). Improving critical care patient flow is crucial for high quality care to severe cases.
Therefore, we need to predict clinical deterioration in patients with COVID-19, in order to
hospitalize the patients and admit to ICU, when necessary. The National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence recommend The National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) to predict the risk
for clinical deterioration in patients with COVID-19 (2, 3). NEWS2 is a simple scoring system
including physiological parameters and vital signs (respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, systolic
blood pressure, heart rate, level of consciousness, temperature and supplemental oxygen
dependency) used to predict the risk for acute deterioration including sepsis (4, 5). An increasing
number of studies have assessed the parameters in NEWS2 score for severe COVID-19 illness

(6). However there is a lack of knowledge about the predictive value of NEWS2, despite some
studies focus on NEWS2 and related scores (3).
In this study, we aimed to determine prognostic value of NEWS2 and laboratory parameters in
COVID-19 patients. Additionally, the correlation between NEWS2 and laboratory parameters at
admission, D3, D5, and D7 during the clinical course of COVID-19 were evaluated.
2. PATIENTS AND METHODS
2.1. Study Design and Patients
In this retrospective and single-center study, all adult patients (≥18 years old) who were
hospitalized for a laboratory confirmed COVID-19 between the 9th of March and the 8th of May
2020 were included. SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed by real-time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of samples collected by nasopharyngeal and/or
oropharyngeal swabs.
Patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation were included in the study. Outpatients and
asymptomatic patientswere excluded. Also, we excluded patients if oropharyngeal or
nasopharyngeal swab samples were repeatedly negative for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Our
primary outcome was the occurence of clinical deterioration defined as a composite of ICU
admission during hospitalisation or in-hospital death.
2.2 Data collection
Epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical, laboratory, radiological findings, and
outcomes were collected from medical records. Vital signs including respiratory rate, peripheral
capillary oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and consciousness
(Glasgow Coma Scale) were recorded. Laboratory parameters including albumin, C-reactive
protein (CRP), procalcitonin, haemoglobin, hematocrit, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count,,
platelet count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), urea,
ferritin, albumin, fibrinogen, d-dimer, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanin
aminotransferase (ALT) were included. The NEWS2 score was calculated.
2.3 Statistical analysis

Quantitative variables are expressed as mean & standard deviation if they contain continuous and
normal distributed data. If the data was not distributed normally, median and interquartile range
(IQR) were used. If they contain categorical data, they are expressed as percentage (%) and
frequency (n). Comparison of qualitative variables was analyzed with Pearson Chi square test.
The normal distribution questioning the necessity of using the parametric test was examined by
Kolmogrov-Smirnov, Shapiro Wilk, Curtosis - Skewness Tests and Box Plot Distribution. When
normally distributed data could not be determined and non-parametric tests and spearman
correlation were used. Kruskal Wallis Test was used for the analysis of continuous and more
than two independent non-parametric groups (Bonferroni correction was used when necessary)
and Mann Whitney Test was used for post-hoc analysis. To evaluate the factors in prognosis
which are admission ICU and in-hospital death, univariate logistic regression analysis was
performed. Afterwards, these dependent groups were handled one by one, ROC curves were
drawn and cut-off values, sensitive and specificity of cut-off values, and Area Under the Curve
(AUC), were demonstrated. To predict clinical deterioration, the prognostic accuracy of NEWS2
and laboratory parameters was evaluated for:
1. NEWS2 and laboratory parameters associated with the clinical deterioration at D0
2. NEWS2 and laboratory parameters associated with the clinical deterioration at D3 after
excluding from the analysis patients with clinical deterioration within the first three days
of hospitalization.
3. NEWS2 and laboratory parameters associated with the clinical deterioration at D5 after
excluding from the analysis patients with clinical deterioration within the first five days
of hospitalization.
4. NEWS2 and laboratory parameters associated with the clinical deterioration at D7 after
excluding from the analysis patients with clinical deterioration within the first seven days
of hospitalization.
The results were evaluated in 95% confidence interval and statistical significance level was
defined as p <0.05. The analyzes were performed using IBM SPSS - 21 (Statistical Package for
Social Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA)

3.1 General Characteristics
Overall, 611 patients were included. Of whom, 329 (53.8%) were male, the mean age was
52.53±15.07 years. 73 patients (11.9%) were admitted to the ICU. In-hospital death occurred in
46 (7.5%) patients. Clinical deterioration was observed in 79 patients (12.9%) during
hospitalisation, 36 (5.9%), during the first three days, 54 (8.8%) during the first five days, and 62
(10.1%) during the first week of hospitalisation. NEWS2 was calculated at admission (D0), D3,
D5 and D7 of hospitalization. Patients were stratified into three risk groups: low risk from 0 to 4;
medium risk from 5 to 6 and high risk above 7. Of 611 patients, 505 (82.7%) at D0, 411 (91.9%)
at D3, 375 (92.2%) at D5, 284 (93.8%) at D7 had a NEWS2 score<7. The median length of
hospital stay was 8.9 days and 332 patients (54.3%) who did not have fever and did not need
oxygen in the last 48-72 hours and meet the criteria for home monitoring were discharged within
the first 7 days. Characteristic of patient, NEWS2 value and NEWS2 class at D0, D3, D5 and
D7, are represented in Supp. Table.

3.3 Univariate analysis
In univariate analysis, among parameters associated with ICU admission or in-hospital death at
D0, D3, D5, and D7, best predictors were NEWS2, procalcitonin, NLR, and albumin.
Additionally, d-dimer (at D0, D3, and D7) and haemoglobin (at D3 and D5) were valuable
predictors in univariate analysis (Table-2).

4. DISCUSSION
In this study, we presented a detailed analysis of the NEWS2 score and laboratory parameters in
hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Our results showed that NEWS2, procalcitonin, NLR, and
albumin were the best predictors for clinical deterioration (ICU admission or in-hospital death) at
D0, D3, D5, and D7. Procalcitonin had the highest odds ratio for clinical deterioration at D0, D3,
D5, and D7 in univariate analysis. ROC analyses showed that NEWS2 at D7, procalcitonin at
D5, albumin at D7, and NLR at D5 had highest AUC values. Additionally, we detected a strong
correlation between NEWS2 and laboratory parameters including lymphocyte count, neutrophil
count, NLR, PLR, CRP, procalcitonin, ferritin, and urea at D0, D3, D5, and D7.
Early and accurate discrimination of need for ICU improves the clinical course of COVID-19
and reduce unnecessary use of ICU beds. To date limited data exists on the NEWS2 and
laboratory parameters in patients with COVID-19. There are several published studies on the use
of NEWS2 in COVID-19 patients (2-4, 7-12). However, most studies evaluate NEWS2 at
admission only (10-13). In the study of Sze et al., they suggested that NEWS2 score was not a
valuable tool to predict clinical deterioration in elderly patients with COVID-19 (14). However,
they reported the results of only 17 elderly patients. Kim et al. showed that NEWS2 scores on D0
significantly differed in non-critical and critical patients (2.6 ± 2.6 vs. 8.2 ± 3.3, p<0.001) (9). In
the study of Volff et al., the AUC value of NEWS score to predict ICU admisson or death was
0.74, in consistent with our result. However, the AUROC values of NEWS2 at D3, D5, and D7
were 0.798, 0.833, and 0.842 whereas NEWS2 at D0 was not accurate (AUROC<0.750) (7).
Similarly, Sixt et al. showed that AUROC values of NEWS2 was 0.74 at D0, with a best cut-off
of 6 and was 0.98 at D7, with a best cut-off of 7. They reported high sensitivity and specificity at
D7 (%92 and %97, respectively) (8).

Due to the physiopathological changes, deterioration in different laboratory parameters occurs
while the disease progresses. Therefore, laboratory parameters are commonly used for assessing
disease severity. Lagadinou et al. found an association between COVID-19 severity and the
following laboratory parameters NLR, LDH, d-dimers, CRP, fibrinogen, and ferritin (15). In the
study of Xu et al., procalcitonin, CRP, and NLR were valuable predictors for COVID-19
mortality.

thrombocytopenia, prothrombin time, and D-dimer were associated with death. They showed that
increased NLR (≥9·13) was associated with 5-fold increased mortality risk (17). Similarly, in our
study, increased NLR was associated with OR = 1.286-fold at D0, OR = 1.754-fold at D3, OR =
1.806-fold at D5, and OR = 1.332-fold at D7 increased mortality risk in univariate analysis. In a
meta-analysis, Elshazli et al. demonstrated that higher levels of leukocyte (OR = 5.21),
neutrophil (OR = 6.25), D-dimer (OR = 4.19), and prolonged PT (OR = 2.18) was associated
with ICU admission.

IL-6 (OR = 13.87), CRP (OR = 7.09), D-dimer (OR = 6.36), and

neutrophils (OR = 6.25) had the highest OR for mortality (18). In a meta-analysis, Lippi et al
showed that increased procalcitonin values are associated with a nearly 5-fold higher risk for
need for ICU or use of mechanical ventilation (OR, 4.76; 95% CI, 2.74–8.29) (19). Xu et al.
found that procalcitonin (≥ 0.10 ng/mL, HR=12.82), CRP (≥ 52.14 mg/L, HR=12.30), and NLR
(≥ 3.59, HR=8.6) had higher HRs of 12.82, 12.30 and 8.6 for mortality, respectively.
Additionally, procalcitonin (≥ 0.10 ng/mL) and CRP (≥ 52.14 mg/L) but not NLR exhibited
independent increasing risks of mortality, with HRs of 52.68 (95% CI: 1.77–1571.66) and 5.47
(95% CI: 1.04–28.72), respectively (16).
In the study of Shang et al., Spearman’s rank correlation analysis revealed that leukocyte,
neutrophil, CRP, procalcitonin, and LDH were positively correlated and albumin was negatively
correlated with mortality in patients with receiving maintenance hemodialysis. Additionally, they
showed that CRP had the highest AUROC value (0.895), and the values of AUROC of
neutrophil count, LDH, leukocyte, albumin, and procalcitonin were 0.813, 0.758, 0.757, 0.743,
and 0.728, respectively (20). In contrast, we found that procalcitonin was the best predictor for
clinical deterioration our study. The optimal cut-off value of procalcitonin at D0, D3, D5, and D7
were 0.065 ng/mL, 0.125 ng/mL, 0.155 ng/mL, and 0.120 ng/mL, and the sensitivity and

specificity to predict clinical deterioration were 81.1% and 67.9% on D0, 80.6 % and 89.3 % on
D3, 87.5 % and 96.7 % on D5, and 85.7 % and 88.2 % on D7 respectively.
Procalcitonin is not well studied for COVID-19 cases. However, some studies suggested that
increased procalsitonin levels were found to be associated with the disease severity in patients
with COVID-19. A meta-analysis showed that severe patients with COVID-19 had increased
procalcitonin levels (18, 19). Similarly, we found that procalcitonin was the best prognostic
parameter for the clinical deterioration in our study. Elevated procalcitonin levels could be
associated with acute secondary bacterial pnemonia or systemic secondary bacterial infection in
patients with COVID-19 due to the production and release into the circulation from procalcitonin
producing extrathyroidal tissues. (21) In our study, despite elevated procalcitonin levels, this
elevation was limited. In a previous study by Xu et al., they suggested that a limited increase in
procalcitonin levels could be associated with increased interferon-gamma (16).
Low serum albumin in studies with COVID-19 patients levels are suggested to be associated
with an increased risk of mortality (22-25) In consistent with other studies, our results confirm
that albumin is a valuable predictor for ICU admission or in-hospital death. Albumin is a
negative acute phase reactant produced in the liver and causes down-regulation of the expression
of ACE-2 receptors which play a role in the cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. Liu et al.
reported that albumin was associated with clinical deteroration and significantly higher in
patients with the improvement/stabilization than in those with disease progression (36.62 ± 6.60
vs. 41.27 ± 4.55 g/L, p=0.006) (24). In the study of Aziz et al., mean albumin at D0 was
3.50 g/dL (CI 3.26–3.74 g/dL) in severe group and 4.05 g/dL (CI 3.82–4.27 g/dL) in non-severe
group (p < 0.001). They reported that hypoalbuminemia was associated with 12.6-fold increased
risk of mortality (25).
An increase in neutrophils and a decrease in lymphocytes have been found in various studies.
Some studies have shown that NLR may be an important indicator for the severity of COVID -19
patients. Yan et al. showed that NLR was significantly correlated with all-cause in-hospital
mortality (OR 44.351; 95% CI 4.627-425.088) (26). The NLR reflects the balance between the
innate and adaptive immune systems (30) and increased NLR levels were found to be associated
with clinical deterioration in COVID-19 (16).

This study has also several limitations. First, it was retrospectively conducted in a single-center.
Second, this study had a small sample size and a control group was not included. The
generalizability of our results may be limited. Thus, we need new large scale studies providing
important information to better understand COVID-19 pandemic. Our study has also several
strengths. First, we were able to admit all critically ill patients requiring intensive care to the ICU
during the first months of pandemic. This prevent a selection bias. Second, longitudinally
evaluation of the association between clinical deterioration and the dynamic changes of
laboratory parameters was performed, since we regularly monitored laboratory parameters
during the clinical course.
Conclusion
This study provides a list of several laboratory parameters correlated with NEWS2 and potential
predictors for ICU admission or in-hospital death during the clinical course of COVID-19.
NEWS2, procalcitonin, NLR, and albumin have a high accuracy to predict clinical
outcomes/disease progression in hospitalized patients and should be considered in the clinical
decision of ICU admission. In conclusion, dynamic monitoring of NEWS2 and laboratory
parameters is vital for improving clinical outcomes.
