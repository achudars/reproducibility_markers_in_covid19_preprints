Abstract

16

Introduction

17

With the global spread of COVID-19, there is a compelling public health interest in quantifying

18

who is at increased risk of disease. Occupational characteristics, such as interfacing with the

19

public and being in close quarters with other workers, not only put workers at high risk for

20

disease, but also make them a nexus of disease transmission to the community. This can

21

further be exacerbated through presenteeism, the term used to describe the act of coming to

22

work despite being symptomatic for disease. Understanding which occupational groups are

23

exposed to infection and disease in the workplace can help to inform public health risk response

24

and management for COVID-19, and subsequent infectious disease outbreaks.

25

Methods

26

To estimate the burden of United States workers exposed to infection and disease in the

27

workplace, national employment data (by Standard Occupational Classification) maintained by

28

the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with BLS O*NET survey data, which ranks

29

occupations with particular physical, ergonomic, and structural exposures. For this analysis,

30

occupations reporting exposure to infection or disease more than once a month was the focus.

31

Results

32

Based on our analyses, approximately 10% (14.4 M) of United States workers are employed in

33

occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per week.

34

Approximately 18.4% (26.7 M) of all United States workers are employed in occupations where

35

exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per month. While the majority of exposed

36

workers are employed in healthcare sectors, other occupational sectors also have high

37

proportions of exposed workers. These include protective service occupations (e.g. police

38

officers, correctional officers, firefighters), office and administrative support occupations (e.g.

39

couriers and messengers, patient service representatives), education occupations (e.g.

40

preschool and daycare teachers), community and social services occupations (community

41

health workers, social workers, counselors), and even construction and extraction occupations

42

(e.g. plumbers, septic tank installers, elevator repair).

Conclusions

46

The large number of persons employed in a wide variety of occupations with frequent exposure

47

to infection and disease underscore the importance of all workplaces developing risk response

48

plans for COVID-19. This work also serves as an important reminder that the workplace is a key

49

locus for public health interventions, which could protect both workers and the communities they

50

serve.

Introduction

53

As COVID-19 spreads globally, there is public health importance in characterizing the role of the

54

workplace in disease transmission, given the amount of time people spend at work, and the

55

variety of work tasks that could promote the spread of infectious disease (e.g., interfacing with

56

customers, patients, and co-workers; preparing food). Presenteeism, reporting to work despite

57

being symptomatic for disease, commonly occurs in the workplace, and can contribute to the

58

transmission of infectious disease, and potentially to the spread of epidemics or pandemics

59

(1,2). One analysis examined the role of workplace transmission in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic,

60

estimating that about 8 million employees in the United States worked while infected, and that

61

these workers may have caused the infection of as many as 7 million of their co-workers (3).

62

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published interim

63

guidance for businesses and employers to plan and respond to COVID-19, including guidance

64

for actively encouraging employees to stay home, separating sick employees, encouraging

65

respiratory and hand hygiene for all employees, performing environmental cleaning, and

66

providing specific advice for employees who need to travel (4). However, the best guidance for

67

workplaces will be geared to be specific to a particular occupational sector that could be

68

exposed to COVID-19. It is known that those working in healthcare settings are at increased risk

69

for exposure to infectious diseases such as COVID-19, but may also have better infectious

70

disease protection plans than other occupational settings. In 2007, Rebmann et al. (5) surveyed

71

633 Infection and Prevention Control Professionals that work at hospitals to understand the

72

infection control policies at hospitals across the country. Rebmann et al. found that most

73

hospitals employ infection control professionals, have a health care worker prioritization plan for

74

vaccines or antivirals, and have plans in place to stockpile N95 respirators and medication, all of

75

which could help control exposure for workers in the hospital. While important, these measures

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.02.20030288; this version posted March 6, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

76

may be inadequate for the effective prevention of infection for such high risk occupations (6).

77

Other occupational groups which may have more sporadic exposure to infection or disease may

78

not have the same level of planning, or even think that an infection disease control plan is

79

warranted for their workplace. Therefore, it is important to understand which occupations could

80

be exposed to infection or disease in order to encourage these occupational sectors to develop

81

and implement an infectious disease response plan for disease outbreaks such as COVID-19.

82

While several groups have broadly characterized the burden of occupational injury or illness (7–

83

9) fewer groups have characterized the burden of occupational exposure, and rarely do these

84

burden of exposure estimates include exposure to biologic agents, disease, or infection in the

85

workplace (10,11). Montano (2014) systematically reviewed which occupational groups in

86

Europe have risk of exposure to biological agents, finding workers in healthcare, biotechnology,

87

agriculture, elementary education, craft work, operators, and the armed forces were exposed to

88

various pathogens; the number of workers exposed and frequency of exposure was not

89

reported (12). Focusing on outcome as opposed to exposure, Anderson et al. characterized the

90

distribution of influenza-like illness (ILI) by occupation in Washington state, finding janitors,

91

cleaners, and janitors more likely to catch ILI (13).

92

Understanding the burden of occupational exposure to infection and disease, including how

93

many workers are potentially exposed and what occupations they work in, allows for upstream

94

prevention measures, such as workplaces developing appropriate infectious disease response

95

plans, integrating infectious disease trainings into other workplace trainings, and beginning to

96

develop workplace policies that can support a workforce potentially exposed to COVID-19. This

97

will help reduce the transmission of infectious disease from and within the workplace.

98

Previously, state-level employment data were utilized to estimate the number of workers

99

exposed to a host of occupational exposures in Federal Region X (WA, OR, ID, AK), spanning

100

chemical, physical, ergonomic, and psychosocial hazards (14). Here, utilizing the same data

101

analysis methods as previously detailed in Doubleday et al., the number of workers across the

102

United States exposed to disease or infection at work more than once a month is estimated. We

103

believe this analysis is valuable for informing risk assessments and protective actions that

104

occupational sectors can take during infectious disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19.

107

Methods

108

Two sources of data were utilized for this analysis, and are detailed below.

109

United States employment data was obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)

110

Occupational Employment Statistics database (15). The most current employment data at the

111

time of analysis was from May 2018, and is organized by 2010 Standard Occupational

112

Classification codes (2010 SOC). SOC codes are hierarchical, ranging from two-digits (Major

113

Group Code) to six digits (Detailed Occupation Code), with the six-digit codes being the most

114

detailed (16).

115

To estimate exposure to disease and infection in the workplace, we used data within the O*NET

116

database. O*NET is a job characterization tool, with rich information on tasks performed, skills

117

needed, and job characteristics for different occupations, in order to inform job seekers or

118

researchers (17). As nearly 600 six-digit SOC occupations are updated each year, the entire

119

O*NET database is completely refreshed every few years (18). Between 2001 and 2011, nearly

120

160,000 employees from 125,000 workplaces had responded to O*NET questionnaires, and no

121

SOC codes are missing from the data (19).

122

To characterize risk of workplace exposure to infectious disease, we used the following O*NET

123

question: “How often does this job require exposure to disease/infections?” Respondents could

124

select from the following multiple choice answers: Never; Once a year or more but not every

125

month; Once a month or more but not every week; Once a week or more but not every day;

126

Every day (20). Within O*NET, these data are converted to a 0-100 score, representing

127

weighted-average frequency or intensity of the metric for each SOC code. For this analysis,

128

occupations were retained that had a score of 50-100, representing exposure to

129

disease/infection more than once a month. SOC codes were merged with the national

130

employment data to calculate the total number of workers employed in the occupations with

131

exposure to disease/infection at more than once a month.

132

All data analysis was conducted using the statistical software package R version 3.6.3.

135

Results

136

As of May 2018, there were a total of 144.7 million persons employed in the United States in

137

employer-employee arrangements counted by BLS. Of these 144.7 million workers, an

138

estimated 18.4% (26,669,810) were employed in occupations where exposure to disease or

139

infection occurs more than once a month. As of May 2018, 10% (14,425,070) of the United

140

States workforce was employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at

141

least once a week. Table 1 summarizes the major occupational sectors (two-digit SOC) that

142

have detailed occupations (six-digit SOC) exposed to infection or disease more than once a

143

month, and the number of workers this represents. Both Healthcare Practitioner and Technical

144

Occupations, and Healthcare Support Occupations have more than 90% of workers exposed

145

more than once a month, and more than 75% of workers exposed more than once a week.

146

Other notable major occupation groups with high proportion of exposure are Protective Service

147

Occupations (52% exposed more than once a month, including police officers, firefighters,

148

transportation security screeners), Personal Care and Service Occupations (52% exposed more

149

than once a month, including childcare workers, nannies, personal care aides), and Production

150

Occupations (60% exposed more than once a month, including laundry and dry cleaning

151

workers, wastewater treatment operators, dental technicians). The 16% of office and

152

administrative support occupations with exposure to disease or infection more than once a

153

month are patient representatives, couriers and messengers, and medical secretaries.

154
155

Discussion

156

During an infectious disease outbreak, the workplace can play an important role in both

157

spreading the disease (21,22) and helping to stop the spread of disease through workplace

158

practices and policies (23,24). Understanding the wide range of occupations that could be

159

exposed to infection or disease due to work activities is important for planning risk management

160

and communication to workers, in addition to prioritizing workplace response plans. This brief

161

report estimates occupational groups that face increased risk of potential exposure to an

162

infection or disease; however, estimates of the number of workers who fall ill due to such

163

exposures are not possible in this analysis. However, a primary goal of public health, especially

164

in the face of a global pandemic, is to prevent the spread of disease. Therefore, understanding

165

who is potentially exposed is an important first step in being able to enact risk reduction

166

strategies prior to disease transmission occurring, and illness manifesting. Therefore, the results

167

reported here have important public health implications.

168

Some limitations must be noted. O*NET data were generated from self-reported subjective

169

questionnaires and therefore are subject to bias and misclassification. Respondents may not

170

realize they are exposed to infection or disease at work unless they are in a workplace where

171

these hazards are communicated to them and protective equipment is provided (e.g., healthcare

172

sectors) leading to potential differential misclassification across occupational groups.

173

Additionally, information from the O*NET database is applied at the occupation-level, and

174

therefore does not account for within-job exposure variation (25).

175

BLS employment estimates do not capture data on all workers in the United States, including

176

self-employed, undocumented, continent, and domestic workers. These workers may be

177

uniquely at risk to exposures to work because due to limited ability to take time off if they or a

178

family member is ill (26). In Sweden and Norway, higher rates of presenteeism (coming to work

179

when sick) were found among low-income and immigrant workers (27).

180

Access to paid leave, which could ameliorate the financial burden of staying home while sick,

181

varies substantially by occupation, industry, employer, location, and worker sociodemographic

182

profile (e.g., race/ethnicity) (28,29). Workers without access to paid leave have higher rates of

183

presenteeism, and are less likely to receive preventative health services such as getting flu

184

shots (30). Occupational sector also influences rates of presenteeism, with studies from various

185

countries showing higher rates of presenteeism among workers in healthcare, public service,

186

and educational sectors, as these essential services often do not have substitute workers

187

available (31–33). Indeed, a recent systematic review identified occupation type as one of the

188

strongest predictors of presenteeism (1). As many of these sectors are already at risk of

189

exposure to disease due to work activities, it is important that disease response plans for these

190

sectors include not only control methods to reduce exposures at work, but also contingency

191

plans to ensure sick workers do not come back to work with disease. This could be

192

accomplished through cross-training, providing extra paid sick leave during this time, ensuring

193

flexible working conditions, and ensuring substitute workers are identified to fill in if essential

194

workers fall ill.

195

In conclusion, our analysis shows that a large proportion of the United States workforce, across

196

a variety of occupational sectors, are exposed to disease or infection at work more than once a

197

month. These are workers that public health should consider especially at risk to exposure to

198

COVID-19. However, it should be noted that there are many other workers that could also be

199

uniquely at risk to exposure to COVID-19, or encourage the spread of COVID-19, such as

200

workers who are not given access to flexible working, workers who do not feel they can take

201

sick time if they or a family member is sick, workers who do not have access to paid sick leave,

202

or workers that perform essential services and do not have access to substitute workers. Work

203

presented here underscores the importance of all workplaces developing sector-specific

204

response plans to keep employees safe, halt the transmission of disease in the workplace, and

205

ensure sick workers do not have to come to work. It also serves as a reminder that the

206

workplace is an important locus for public health interventions, that can affect both the workers

207

and the community.
