Abstract
Background:
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted routine measles immunisation and supplementary
immunisation activities (SIAs) in most countries including Kenya. We assessed the risk of
measles outbreaks during the pandemic in Kenya as a case study for the African Region.
Methods:
Combining measles serological data, local contact patterns, and vaccination coverage into a
cohort model, we predicted the age-adjusted population immunity in Kenya and estimated the
probability of outbreaks when contact-reducing COVID-19 interventions are lifted. We
considered various scenarios for reduced measles vaccination coverage from April 2020.
Findings:
In February 2020, when a scheduled SIA was postponed, population immunity was close to the
herd immunity threshold and the probability of a large outbreak was 22% (0-46). As the COVID19 restrictions to physical contact are lifted, from December 2020, the probability of a large
measles outbreak increased to 31% (8-51), 35% (16-52) and 43% (31-56) assuming a 15%, 50%
and 100% reduction in measles vaccination coverage. By December 2021, this risk increases
further to 37% (17-54), 44% (29-57) and 57% (48-65) for the same coverage scenarios
respectively. However, the increased risk of a measles outbreak following the lifting of
restrictions on contact can be overcome by conducting an SIA with ≥ 95% coverage in underfives.
Interpretation:
While contact restrictions sufficient for SAR-CoV-2 control temporarily reduce measles
transmissibility and the risk of an outbreak from a measles immunity gap, this risk rises rapidly
once physical distancing is relaxed. Implementing delayed SIAs will be critical for prevention of
measles outbreaks once contact restrictions are fully lifted in Kenya.

Background
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has interrupted large parts of social interaction, the economy and
important health services in Kenya and around the world.1,2 As of mid-July 2020, the incidence
of COVID-19 cases continues to rise across most of Africa, implying that the current mitigation
measures need to be maintained or extended for a period at least until the pandemic peaks.3
Despite the World Health Organization (WHO) advisory to sustain routine immunization (RI),
vaccine coverage has temporarily declined in many countries including Kenya that reports a 33%
disruption of RI.4-7 Following guidance from the WHO, all countries suspended planned
supplementary immunisation activities (SIAs) for measles.6-8 Measles control in Kenya is
achieved by a delivery of a first dose of Measles Containing Vaccine (MCV1) at 9 months, and a
second dose (MCV2) from 18 months. SIAs, first introduced in 2002 are conducted periodically
among children <5 years or <15 years for accelerated control of measles.9 Based on
accumulation of susceptible children, timing of such campaigns has typically been chosen to
close immunity gaps in time to prevent potentially large measles outbreaks. Measles SIA
originally due in 2019 was rescheduled for February 2020 due to a shortfall in funding and
postponed again following the COVID-19 pandemic.
Following identification of the first COVID-19 case on March 13, 2020, Kenya imposed various
mitigation measures: ban on large gatherings, suspension of international flights, closure of bars,
cessation of movement from hotspot counties, restriction of restaurant operating hours and a
nationwide curfew from 7pm to 5 am. While it is plausible that these physical distancing and lock
down measures may reduce the risk of measles outbreaks, they are temporary and may be
associated with rebound risk periods.
The availability of recent measles serological data provided the opportunity to use Kenya as a
case study to estimate the impact of reduced measles vaccination coverage and suspended
SIAs due to COVID-19 on the risk of measles outbreaks.

Methods
This study used a cohort mathematical model that combined measles serological data from a
survey in October 2019, local contact patterns, and vaccination coverage estimates.

Serological data
We estimated measles immunity profile in children using samples collected during serosurveys
of the Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Impact Study (PCVIS).10 The participants were a
randomly selected sample of children in ten age strata (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8-9 and 10-14 years)
resident in Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS) in Kilifi, Kenya.11 In the
2019 serosurvey, 468 participants were recruited of which 214 randomly selected blood samples
had been tested for presence of measles antibodies before COVID-19 disruptions to work. The
samples were collected in July (107), August (73), September (33) and October (1) 2019. Measles
immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were detected using a fluorescent-bead-based multiplex
immunoassay and antibody concentrations ≥0.12 IU/ml were considered protective against
measles.12
For projections, we assumed these results reflected measles immunity in Kilifi in August 2019,
and assumed 96% of persons >15 years had protective measles antibodies concentrations,
similar to findings in adults in Nairobi in 2007-200913 (Table 1). We also assumed no protection
from maternal immunity since none of the infants <9 months old had protective antibodies.

Vaccination coverage
MCV1 national coverage in Kenya has been between 75% and 80% since it was introduced in
1985.14 MCV2 was introduced into the RI programme in Kenya in 2013 and coverage rose to
45% in 2018 after introduction.9 The last measles SIA in children aged 9 months to 14 years took
place in 2016 and achieved 95% coverage.15
We assumed national MCV1 and MCV2 coverage were 79% and 45% respectively in 2018, and
that these stayed at the same level from August 2019 until the end of March 2020 when COVID19 contact restrictions were introduced in Kenya. From April 2020, we explored the following
routine vaccination coverage scenarios alongside a suspended SIA

A. routine vaccination coverage remained the same, or
B. routine vaccination coverage reduced by 15% for both MCV1 and MCV2, or
C. routine vaccination coverage reduced by 50% for both MCV1 and MCV2, or
D. routine vaccination was suspended

Contact matrix
We used an age-mixing matrix from a study conducted in Kilifi, Kenya.16 The matrix which
consisted of the number of contacts between six different age groups was used in generating
contact-adjusted immunity estimates.

Projecting immunity
We adapted a static cohort model of measles immunity17 to estimate age stratified population
immunity profile in Kilifi by combining recent measles serological data with new vaccine-derived
immunity during the prediction period using the local vaccination schedule, MCV1 and MCV2
uptake, and vaccine efficacy. We assumed waning immunity or additional acquired immunity
from natural exposure, and demographic changes in the short time frame considered were
negligible. Hence, the key mechanisms of the projection model were that individuals are born at
a constant rate, gain immunity through vaccination at the recommended age and at the observed
coverage, and grow older.
In extrapolating immunity for young infants under 9 months old, maternal immunity was assumed
to be the same as the observed data. For ages 9 months to 17 months, immunity was estimated
in accordance with the assumed MCV1 vaccination uptake and a vaccine effectiveness of 93%.
For those ³18 months, we estimated the immunity based on the assumed uptake of MCV2 and
the same vaccine effectiveness. We aggregated projected immunity to age groups given by
contact data and weighted each age group according to population estimates before averaging
them to estimate overall immunity. We did not explicitly model MCV2 delivery but rather assumed
that the MCV1 effectiveness is an average of MCV1 and MCV2 efficacy weighted by proportion
of children who receive MCV1 only or both doses. The underlying assumption here was that the
same children who received MCV2 had also received MCV1. We predicted age stratified and
population level immunity until December 2021.

To derive a contact-adjusted estimate for the proportion of the population who are immune to
measles, the predicted age stratified immunity profile was weighted by age stratified social
contact patterns observed in Kilifi. This method has been previously shown to yield robust
projections for measles immunity to transmission in the population.17
The herd immunity threshold for measles during the COVID-19 pandemic was calculated
assuming an R0 of 12 to 18 with a median of 1418 and that COVID-19 prescribed contact
restrictions caused a 50% reduction in measles transmissibility similar to the observed reduction
in physical contacts in Kenya.19 The herd immunity threshold is calculated as 𝓗0 = 1-1/(R0)

Quantitative impact of outbreak risk
We obtained a crude estimate of the outbreak risk using the predicted immunity and herdimmunity threshold. The probability of a large outbreak, p, sparked by a single infected individual
was given by p = 1-(1/R)I0 where I0 is the initial number infected and R is the effective
reproductive number. R<1 implies that probability, p, is negative which is defined to be 0 for no
outbreak.

The effectiveness of a post-lockdown SIA in reducing outbreak risk
We assessed the impact of SIAs in two age categories; 9 months to 5 years and 9 months to 15
years, by predicting the post-SIA immunity profile and the corresponding risk for a large measles
outbreak. We simulated SIAs in either October 2020, December 2020 or December 2021,
assumed a coverage of 95% similar to the most recent national SIA in 2016,15 and applied
vaccine efficacy of MCV1. The SIA was simulated by reducing the age specific pool of
susceptible by the effective coverage of the SIA.

Uncertainty analyses
We assessed the sensitivity of our findings to uncertainty inherent in several of our assumptions
via probabilistic re-sampling. We included uncertainty for population immunity profile, combined
MCV1 and MCV2 vaccine effectiveness, and MCV1 and MCV2 coverage (Table 1). As part of
each parameter bootstrap, we also bootstrapped participants of the serological survey and
hence the age stratified population immunity at the start of the simulation. We present median
estimates including uncertainty quantified as per the 95% quantiles of the bootstrap analyses.

Sensitivity analyses
We conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of a delay in receipt of MCV1 on
outbreak probability. We delayed the age of receipt of MCV1 in our model by three months as
reported for delayed vaccination in Kilifi.20 We also predicted unadjusted population immunity in
Kilifi and estimated the corresponding probability of a large outbreak

Results
Measles seroprevalence in Kilifi in late 2019
Proportion of MCV1-eligible children with protective measles antibody concentrations was high
in late 2019 (Figure 1). All 25 children over 10 years old had protective levels. Similarly, 77 of 82
(94%) 5- 9-year-olds were immune. Among children under 5 years eligible for MCV1, 86 of 97
(89%) were immune but none of the 10 children who were age ineligible for vaccination had
protective antibodies.

Age adjusted immunity
We estimate that in late 2019, population immunity adjusted for age-differences in social
contacts was 91% (87-93). Predicted proportion immune was unchanged in February 2020, at
the time of originally planned SIA.
Following the start of COVID-19 pandemic and restriction measures that caused a decrease in
vaccination coverage, we estimate that population immunity decreased quickly, depending on
extent of reduction in vaccination coverage. If vaccine coverage is reduced by 15% from April
2020 onwards, contact-adjusted population immunity would decline to 90% (87-92) by
December 2020 and 89% (87-92) by December 2021. A 50% reduction in vaccination coverage
would lead to a more rapid decline in this immunity to 89% (86-91) in December 2020 and 87%
(84-89) in December 2021(Figure 2)

Age adjusted immunity vs herd immunity threshold
A basic reproduction number of 14 (12-18) implies a herd immunity threshold of 93% (82-94)
and if, as a result of social distancing, measles transmission is reduced by 50%, herd immunity
threshold drops to 86% (83-89) as seen in figure 2.
Before contact restrictions came into effect in April 2020, age-adjusted immunity was slightly
below herd immunity threshold: in 10% of simulations this immunity was below the herd
immunity threshold (Figure 3). Reduction in herd immunity threshold temporarily mitigated
immediate risk for measles outbreak as in all simulations immunity in April 2020 was above the
reduced transmission herd immunity threshold.

Depending on vaccination coverage maintained during COVID-19 pandemic, population
immunity may decline quickly in young children (<2 years). By April 2020, age-adjusted immunity
fell below the normal transmission herd immunity threshold in more than 95% of simulation under
scenario C and D respectively. (Figure S2).
Similarly, risk of a large measles outbreak from introduction of a single infectious individual
increased quickly if routine vaccination coverage was impaired (Figure 3). If in October 2020,
measles transmissibility was similar to that pre-COVID-19 and routine measles coverage since
April 2020 reduced by 15%, 50% or 100%, we estimate probability for a large measles outbreak
as 26% (8-49), 33% (11-52), 40% (24-56) respectively in the age-adjusted analysis. By the end
of the year, the risk would increase to 28% (4-49), 35% (16-52) and 44% (29-57) respectively.

Effectiveness of a post - lockdown SIA
SIAs in 9 months to 5-year-old children or 9 months to 15-year-olds immediately after lifting
transmission-reducing COVID-19 mitigation measures can substantially reduce outbreak risk
(Figure 4).
If routine measles vaccine coverage was reduced by 15%, 50% or 100% since April 2020, an
SIA delivered to children 9 months to 5 years old in October 2020 with 95% coverage would
reduce measles outbreak probability risk to 0% (0-11), 0% (0-12) and 0% (0-17) for coverage
scenarios respectively in age-adjusted analysis. Even if RI coverage is impaired through to
December 2021, the risk for a large measles outbreak would be mitigated through an SIA for
under-fives if delivered before or immediately after contact restrictions are lifted (Figure 4).

Impact of delayed vaccination on outbreak probability
Receipt of MCV delayed by 3 months in children resulted in a marginal increase in the risk of a
large measles outbreak from introduction of a single infectious individual (Figure S1).

Crude Population immunity
Predicted crude population immunity was slightly higher compared to age-adjusted immunity
but followed the same declining trend over time (Figure S3). Before contact restrictions came
into place, 50% of simulations were below herd immunity threshold and by June 2021 and

November 2020, this immunity fell below herd immunity threshold in more than 95% of
simulations under scenario C and D respectively (Figure S2).

Discussion
Our analysis suggests a decline in population immunity during COVID-19 pandemic will result in
an increased risk of a measles outbreak depending on the extent to which routine vaccination
coverage is reduced. We estimated the probability of a large measles outbreak from the
introduction of a single infectious individual to be 26% (8-49), 33% (11-52), 40% (24-56) in
October 2020 assuming a 15%, 50% or 100% reduction in routine measles vaccination coverage
respectively since April 2020. This risk, which will increase to 28% (4-49), 35% (16-52) and 44%
(29-57) by the end of the year will be greatly reduced if an SIA among children <5 years old is
conducted before or immediately after all COVID-19 related restrictions on physical contact are
lifted.
We based our analysis on an immunity model that combined serological data and age-specific
mixing patterns in Kenya. Combining the two is a better strategy for predicting outbreaks as
opposed to using immunity profiles alone as it allows adjustment of overall immunity by taking
into account contribution of each age-group to transmission.17
As there is considerable uncertainty in actual reduction of routine vaccination uptake, we
predicted population immunity for scenarios of routine vaccination coverage since April 2020 i.e.
15%, 50% and 100% reductions, and the corresponding outbreak risk. Our assumption of 15%
reduction in vaccine coverage rates is based on reduction in vaccine clinic visits in Kilifi County
(DHIS2 Routine Report) while the 50% reduction lies in the range of reported disruption in
vaccination services from WHO immunisation pulse poll.6 We assumed a 50% reduction in
measles transmissibility given that COVID-19 mitigation measures implemented on 25th March
2020 were reported to have reduced social contacts and disease transmission by the same
margin.19 Although some restriction measures remain in place e.g. nationwide curfew, others like
the partial lockdown have since been eased and ban on international flights was lifted on 1st
August 2020. While the assumption of a 50% reduction in measles transmission was applicable
at the beginning of the epidemic due to stringent measures imposed, current herd immunity
threshold may be much higher than originally assumed but still lower than pre-COVID-19
threshold.

SIAs in Kenya are generally conducted every 2-4 years and provide a second opportunity for
vaccination in children regardless of their vaccination history and are ideally timed to close
immunity gaps arising from accumulation of susceptible and vaccine failures.25 They have been
shown to be effective in increasing immunisation equity by reaching children from poor
households.26 In February 2020, at the time of the planned national SIA, we estimated that 91%
(87-93) of the population were immune after adjusting for age-differences in social contact. This
immunity which was equivalent to a 22% (0-46) probability of a large outbreak suggests the SIA
would have been timely in closing immunity gaps. The risk of an outbreak which was accelerated
by immunity gaps arising in children missed their routinely delivered MCV continued to increase
in subsequent months following the start of COVID-19 and by December 2020, the estimated
risk had increased to 28%(4-49), 35%(16-52) and 44%(29-57) assuming a 15%, 50% and 100%
reduction in measles vaccination coverage respectively. Based on limited information on
additional reductions in vaccination coverage as the pandemic progressed in Kenya’s devolved
counties and marked reduction in vaccination services in Kenya in May 2020 compared to
January and February 2020 reported in the second WHO immunisation poll, it is highly probable
most areas will experience an outbreak risk of 35%(16-52) corresponding to a 50% reduction in
routine coverage.
During the period of restricted movement, outbreak risks would only be experienced in the
suspended RI scenario in 2021. Reduction in severity and timing of these outbreaks would be
largely reduced if a measles vaccine campaign is delivered but it will also depend on time delay
of catch-up campaigns and speed at which a campaign can be organised. In August 2020 for
instance, an SIA would reduce outbreak risk to zero in all scenarios while in December 2020,
outbreak risk would reduce to zero with an upper bound risk of 20% after delivery of SIA.
The current disruption to vaccination services will cause further delays to vaccination, which is
a challenge even in normal circumstances. We had previously reported consistently poor
timeliness of MCV1 vaccination across 6 different birth-cohorts (2011-2016) in Kenya.20 Here, a
delay in age of MCV1 by 3 months resulted in a marginal increase in outbreak risk. For instance,
assuming a 50% reduction in routine vaccination, a delay in vaccination would see the risk
increase from 34% (15-51) to 41% (26-57) by the end of the year. This reiterates the importance
of timeliness in administration of vaccines in children as even a slight delay may cause
considerable immunity gaps.

Our results emphasize the importance of maintaining high RI coverage during this pandemic
because the benefits of sustaining RI services far outweighs the risks of any excess COVID-19
deaths that may arise from vaccination clinic visits.27 Due to the highly infectious nature of
measles, massive outbreaks following disruptions to health care systems and reduced MCV1
coverage are typical. Following an Ebola outbreak in 2014-2015, Liberia and Guinea reported
more than a 25% decline in MCV1 coverage.28,29 Reported cases also occurred in a lower age
group compared to pre-Ebola period suggesting accumulation of susceptible children who
missed their vaccine doses was a key contributor. Immunity gaps continued to be felt in these
countries two years later even after successful implementation of SIAs.
Recently, measles outbreaks have been reported in five counties in Kenya30 even with COVID19 restrictions which suggests an adverse synergistic interaction between pre-existing gaps of
susceptibility due to lower vaccination coverage rates (compared to national estimates) and a
precipitous drop in RI coverage during this period. These outbreaks and our results are well
aligned with recent Kenya measles outbreak risk assessment report and WHO guidance on catch
up vaccination and closing the immunity gaps caused by COVID-19.
As expected, majority of vaccine eligible children had protective antibody concentrations against
measles but none of the 10 infants < 9 months old had protective concentrations. This suggests
an extended period of susceptibility in young infants as a result of rapid maternal antibody decay.
This phenomenon has been previously reported in areas where maternal immunity is increasingly
from immunisation rather than natural infection.31
A key strength of our study is availability of recent serological data which provides an excellent
means of directly estimating levels of population protection against infection and can also be
used to guide post-COVID-19 SIAs. In addition, availability of an age-mixing matrix from the
same area allowed us to estimate overall immunity by taking into account the level of contact
between different age-groups.
Our study has a few limitations. Population immunity was only available for children <15 years
but we varied observed immunity estimates in adults from a previous study in our model which
resulted in a slight shift in overall immunity. The serological data, estimates and a mixing matrix

used in our study may not be fully representative of the country although we utilised national
estimates of vaccination coverage, which was the main driver of predicted immunity. We did not
explicitly model MCV2 delivery but assumed the overall effectiveness was an average of MCV1
and MCV2 efficacy weighted by proportion of children who either receive MCV1 only or both
doses. Finally, there is some uncertainty around the actual reduction in transmission due to
variability in compliance with physical distancing measures in place. However, we accounted for
uncertainty by varying the R0.

Conclusions
Measles SIA originally scheduled for February 2020 in Kenya would have been well-timed as
population immunity was below herd immunity threshold. Interruptions to RI since the start of
COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in Kenya have now widened the measles immunity gap, but
associated risk of large measles outbreaks are partially mitigated if COVID-19 contact
restrictions remain in place. As these measures are almost fully lifted, we estimate that measles
outbreak risks will dramatically increase, necessitating an immediate SIA’s to close the immunity
gap.

Figure 1. Age-stratified population immunity profile. Estimated age-stratified proportion of
the Kilifi County population who were immune to measles infection in August 2019 from data.
Antibody concentrations ≥0∙12 IU/ml were defined as protective. Confidence bounds displayed
(in red) are the 95% quantiles of a nonparametric bootstrap that is used to propagate uncertainty
into the modelling framework. MCV1 is recommended to be administered at 9 months as per the
Kenyan immunisation schedule and MCV2 from 18 months

Figure 2. Monthly projected age adjusted immunity profiles from September 2019 to
December 2021. The changes in coverage took effect in April 2020. The black dotted line shows
the herd immunity threshold for measles before the COVID-19 physical distancing measures,
0∙93 (0∙92 to 0∙94) and the brown dotted line shows the herd immunity threshold during COVID19 physical distancing measures, 0∙86[0∙83-0∙89], assuming the lockdown measures are still in
effect. The bold lines and shaded region in each scenario i.e. A. No reduction, B. 15% reduction,
C. 50% reduction and D. 100% reduction indicate the median estimates and the uncertainty of
the predicted immunity quantified as the 95% quantiles of the bootstrap analysis. There was a
quick decline of predicted immunity over the study period that was based on assumed reduction
in routine coverage

Figure 3. Probability of a large measles outbreak sparked by a single infected individual.
Outbreak probability was calculated using the predicted immunity and herd immunity threshold
before (red) and during (green) COVID-19 movement restriction measures. Zero probability
indicates no possibility of an outbreak. The bold lines and shaded region in each scenario i.e.
A. No reduction, B. 15% reduction, C. 50% reduction and D. 100% reduction indicate the
median estimates of outbreak risk and the uncertainty quantified as the 95% quantiles of the
bootstrap analysis. The risk of a large measles outbreak from the introduction of a single
infectious individual increased quickly based on the level of impairment of routine vaccination
coverage

Figure 4. Probability of a single infectious person seeding a large outbreak before (none)
and after implementing an SIA in children 9 months to 5 years old (U5) and in 9 months to
15 years old (U15) at different timepoints. Outbreak probability was calculated by comparing
the proportion immune with the herd immunity threshold. The shaded area is the median
estimate of the outbreak risk and the error bars indicate the uncertainty in outbreak risk
quantified as the 95% quantiles of the bootstrap analysis. In all the scenarios, i.e. A. No
reduction, B. 15% reduction, C. 50% reduction and D. 100% reduction, the risk of a large
measles outbreak would be largely mitigated through delivery of a SIA among children <5 years
old or <15 years old.
