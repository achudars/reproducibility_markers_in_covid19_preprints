Abstract

28

Serological assays are important tools to identify previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2,

29

helping to track COVID-19 cases and determine the level of humoral response to SARS-CoV-2

30

infections and/or immunization to future vaccines. Here the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was

31

expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity and high yield using a single

32

chromatography step. The purified SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein was used to develop an

33

indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the identification of human SARS-CoV-2

34

seroconverts. The assay sensitivity and specificity were determined analyzing sera from 140 PCR-

35

confirmed COVID-19 cases and 210 pre-pandemic controls. The assay operated with 90%

36

sensitivity and 98% specificity; identical accuracies were obtained in head-to-head comparison with

37

a commercial ELISA kit. Antigen coated plates were stable for up to 3 months at 4oC). The ELISA

38

method described is ready to mass production and will be an additional toll to track COVID-19

39

cases.

Introduction

51

In December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China, reported cases of patients with

52

pneumonia of unknown epidemiological causes, linked to a seafood/animal market. The pathogen in

53

these cases has been identified, through viral isolation, electron microscopy and RNA sequencing,

54

as a new beta-coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 (Zhu et al., 2020). Shortly after its emergence in

55

China, SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly across the world. According to the John Hopkins University

56

website (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html), on 01/02/2021, more than 100 million cases of

57

COVID-19 have been registered worldwide and the disease was responsible for 2,236,000 deaths.

58

Serological assays are important for epidemiological surveillance studies to monitor

59

COVID-19 cases (Petherick, 2020). The structural Nucleocapsid (N) protein is known to be a major

60

antigen of coronavirus producing a strong humoral response in humans (Cheng et al., 2007).

61

Furthermore, the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein can be used as antigen to detect COVID-19

62

cases without significant cross-reactivity with common cold coronavirus (den Hartog et al., 2020).

63

Here we describe the develop an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) which

64

allowed accurate detection human anti- IgG SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion.

65
66

Results and Discussion

67

A codon optimized synthetic gene was obtained and cloned into the pET28a vector to allow

68

the expression of an N-terminal 6xHis tagged SARS-CoV-2 N protein in Escherichia coli BL21

69

(λDE3) (Huergo et al., 2020; F. Huergo et al., 2021). The viral protein was highly expressed and

70

remained partially soluble in E. coli cell extracts (Fig. 1A). The protein was purified using a 5 ml

71

His-trap affinity column (Cytiva) followed by elution with an imidazole gradient. The His-tagged

72

SARS-CoV-2 N protein eluted at 300 mM of imidazole to apparent homogeneity on Coomassie

73

stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). Typical protein yield was 8 mg per 100 ml of culture, the antigen

74

was stored for up to 4 months at -20oC.

75

The purified N protein was diluted in buffer and used to coat 96 well polystyrene plates

76

overnight at 40C. Plates were blocked with skimmed milk and serum from a COVID-19 positive

77

case and a negative control serum were serial diluted and placed into the wells of pre-coated plates.

78

The presence of IgG reacting with the SARS-CoV-2 N protein was revealed by incubating with

79

secondary anti-human IgG -HPR followed by chromogenic substrate TMB. The COVID-19

80

positive serum showed strong reaction with the N protein even at high dilutions (Fig. 1B). On the

81

other hand, the negative control serum showed only minor background cross reaction in low

82

dilutions (Fig. 2A). The OD450nm response vs serum dilution of the positive serum was linear

83

between the 1,600 to 25,600 dilutions with R2 = 0.995 (Fig. 1C). This positive serum was used as a

84

positive control throughout this study, the inter assay CV% was 7.2% (same sample run in 12

85

different plates in duplicate). The mean intra assay CV% was 7.6% (mean CV% was obtained from

86

duplicate 96 samples x 12 plates).

Expression and purification of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein (N-protein)

91

A codon optimized synthetic gene expressing the full-length SARS-CoV-2 N-protein

92

(Uniprot QHD43423.2) was obtained and cloned into pET28a by General Biosystems (F. Huergo et

93

al., 2021). This plasmid was named pLHSarsCoV2-N and transformed into E. coli BL21 (λDE3)

94

enabling the expression of N-terminal His-tagged N-protein after induction with IPTG. The cells

95

were growth in 100 ml LB medium at 120 rpm at 37oC to OD600nm of 0.4. The incubator

96

temperature was lowered to 16oC, after 30 min, IPTG was added to a final concentration 0.3 mM

97

and the culture was kept at 120 rpm at 16oC over/night. Cells were collected by centrifugation at

98

3,000 xg for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of buffer 1 (Tris-HCl pH 8 50 mM,

99

KCl 100 mM, glycerol 10%). Cells were disrupted by sonication on an ice bath. The soluble

100

fraction was recovered after centrifugation at 20,000 xg for 20 minutes and loaded onto a 5 ml His4

Trap column (Cytiva), which had been previously equilibrated with buffer 1. The column was

102

washed with 10 ml of buffer 1 and bound proteins were eluted with buffer 1 containing increasing

103

concentrations of imidazole. The His-tagged N-protein eluted at 300 mM imidazole. The final

104

protein preparation yield was  8 mg and was homogeneous as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis. The

105

purified protein was stored in aliquots at 4oC for one week or at -20oC for up to four months.

107

Human samples

108

Samples were collected at the Hospital de Clínicas (CHC/UFPR), Hospital Erasto

109

Gaertner, Hospital do Trabalhador and Secretária Municipal de Saúde de Guaratuba. Samples for

110

serological analysis comprised both serum and plasma-EDTA. COVID-19 positive cases were

111

confirmed by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal

112

sample swabs. The time point of sampling of serum ranged from 1 to 70 days after onset of

113

symptoms. The cohort of 210 negative controls consisted of pre pandemic samples. The

114

Institutional Ethics Review Board of CHC/UFPR (n# 30578620.7.0000.0008), CEP/HEG (n#

115

31592620.4.1001.0098) and (CEP/HT n# 31650020.5.0000.5225) approved this study.

ELISA assays

118

The purified SARS-CoV-2 N-protein was diluted to 2 ng/µl in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 100

119

mM KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol and 0.1 ml aliquots were transferred to the wells of ELISA plates

120

(Olen) and incubated overnight at 4oC. Unbound excess protein was removed, and wells were

121

washed twice with 0.2 ml of 1x TBST buffer pH 7.6 (Tris 2.42 g.l-1, NaCl 8 g.l-1 and tween 80 0.1%

122

v/v). Wells were blocked with 0.2 ml 3% (w/v) skimmed milk in 1x TBST overnight at 4oC. The

123

serum was diluted at 1:1,000 in 1x TBST containing 1% (w/v) skimmed milk and 0.1 ml were

124

loaded onto the ELISA duplicate wells following by incubation at room temperature for 1 hour. The

125

wells were washed three times with 0.2 ml of 1x TBST followed by incubation with 0.1 ml of anti-

126

human IgG-HPR from goat (Thermo Fisher - cat number 62-8420) diluted 1:3,000 in 1x TBST.

127

Wells were washed three times with 0.2 ml of 1x TBST. The HPR substrate TMB (Thermo Fisher -

128

cat number 00-2023) was added to the wells (0.1 ml). The reaction was stopped after 10 min

129

incubation at room temperature by addition of 0.1 ml 1M HCl. The plates were put on the top of a

130

white light transilluminator device and photographed. Samples were run in duplicates and data were

131

reported as % of a positive reference serum. The optical density was measured at 450 nm using a

132

TECAN M Nano plate reader (TECAN) monochromator at bandwidth 9 nm and 25 flashes.

To validate our ELISA assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in human a cohort

158

consisting of 140 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 210 pre-pandemic negative controls were

used. The pre-pandemic control sera produced only background signal which were clearly

161

ranged from 21 to 86 years of age (mean = 62). It is likely that most of these subjects had

162

experienced prior infections with common coronavirus (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU which

163

usually cause mild upper-respiratory tract disease, like the common cold). These data suggest that

164

our ELISA assay shows negligible cross reactivity for IgG raised against common coronavirus.

165

However, it is worth mentioning that we detected 4 reactive pre-pandemic samples whose signals

166

were above the established cutoff thereby being classified as false positives (Fig. 2A). Such

167

reactivity could be potentially explained by cross reaction with IgG raised against common

168

coronavirus.

169

The ELISA method operated with an area under the ROC curve of 0.96 (Fig. 2B), the cut

170

off the assay was set at 90% sensitivity and 98% specificity. These values are in the same range for

171

other SARS-CoV-2 immunological IgG testes described previously (Cai et al., 2020; den Hartog et

172

al., 2020; Rikhtegaran Tehrani et al., 2020). It is worth mentioning that among the PCR-confirmed

173

COVID-19 cases, 32 samples were in the early stage of infection ( 10 days after PCR detection)

174

and this may explain the low sensitivity. Indeed, if only samples collected 10 days after PCR

175

detection were considered, the sensitivity dropped to 81%. It is also worth mentioning that 40

176

samples of the COVID-19 positive cohort were from asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 cases which

177

are known to induce lower humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infections (Long et al., 2020).

178

Indeed, our analysis confirmed that the IgG titer was significantly lower in mild versus hospitalized

179

COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2C).

A panel of 90 samples was analyzed in parallel by our developed ELISA and the

196

Euroimmun Nucleocapsid-based IgG ELISA. All the 44 pre-pandemic negative samples analyzed

197

were negative in both tests confirming the high specificity of the assays. Out of the 46 PCR

198

confirmed COVID-19 samples, both testes missed 4 samples (false negatives). One sample was

199

negative in both testes and three samples were uniquely negative in each of the two different tests.

200

These data support that our ELISA performed with similar sensitivity to the commercial

201

Euroimmun ELISA test.

202

In conclusion, here we describe a high yield and simple method to purify the SARS-CoV-

203

2 Nucleocapsid antigen using only one simple affinity chromatography step. The antigen

204

preparation was used to develop an indirect ELISA which allowed accurate detection of SARS-

205

CoV-2 seroconversion in humans. The developed assay is ready for mass production in order to

206

help to track COVID-19 cases specially in developing countries where access to molecular test is

207

limited.
