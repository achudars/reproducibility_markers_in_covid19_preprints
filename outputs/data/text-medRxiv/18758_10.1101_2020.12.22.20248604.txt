Abstract
Background
In spring 2020, at the beginning of the first pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) wave in Europe, we set up an assay system for large-scale testing
of virus-specific and protective antibodies including their longevity.
Methods
We analysed the sera of 1655 adult employees for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies using the
S1 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Sera containing S1-reactive antibodies were
further evaluated for receptor-binding domain (RBD)- and nucleocapsid protein (NCP)-specific
antibodies in relation to the neutralisation test (NT) results at 0, three and six months.
Findings
We found immunoglobulin G (IgG) and/or IgA antibodies reactive to the S1 protein in 10.15%
(n=168) of the participants. In total, 0.97% (n=16) were positive for S1-IgG, 0.91% (n=15)
were S1-IgG- borderline and 8.28% (n=137) exhibited only S1-IgA antibodies. Next, we
evaluated the 168 S1-reactive sera for RBD- and NCP specificity: 8.33% (n=14) had detectable
RBD-specific and 6.55% (n=11) NCP-specific antibodies. The latter correlated with NTs
(kappa coefficient = 0.8660) but started to decline already after 3 months. RBD-specific
antibodies correlated best with the NT (kappa = 0.9448) and only these antibodies were stable
for up to six months. All participants with virus-neutralising antibodies reported symptoms, of
which, anosmia and/or dysgeusia correlated best with the detection of virus-neutralising
antibodies.
Interpretation
RBD-specific antibodies were most reliably detected post infection, independent of the
number/severity of symptoms, and correlated best with protective neutralising antibodies at
least for six months. They thus qualify best for large-scale seroepidemiological evaluation of
both seroprevalence and seroprotection.
Funding
This study received funding from the Austrian Ministry of Education, Science and Research
within the research framework in relation to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (GZ 2020
0225 104).

Key points (max 40 words): Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies depends on their
specificity. Total RBD-specific antibodies are those that are stable for up to at least six months
and correlate best with neutralisation independent of the presence and severity of COVID-19
symptoms.

Research in context
Evidence before the study
At the beginning of the study (early pandemic in April 2020), the SARS-Cov-2 specific
seroprevalence was totally unknown. Additionally, S1-specific antibody assays being the first
on the market were tested with limited sample size showing a lower sensitivity and specificity
at that time. Furthermore, at that time, there were no unambiguous interpretations of antibody
test results with regard to immunity/protection against reinfection. It was also not clear whether
the detection of different antibody specificities could yield an essential input into the
interpretation of the antibody´s qualities. Another open question was how long antibodies of
the various specificities as well as antibodies with protective capacities would persist.
Added value of this study
We provide data to confirm the most reliable correlation of RBD-specific antibodies with
neutralising antibodies that are stable for at least six months. S1- and NCP-specific antibodies
wane more quickly than RBD-specific antibodies, rendering them not as ideal candidates for
longitudinal seroprevalence studies. Concerning symptoms, anosmia/dysgeusia was strongly
associated with NT-seropositivity and seroprotection in the overall study population.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our data suggest that RBD-specific total antibody measurements with assays of high specificity
can be used for cross-sectional as well as longitudinal seroepidemiological studies, even in lowprevalence settings. Detection of these antibodies also indicates robust seroprotection for at
least six months. Due to the substantial loss of S1- and NCP-specific antibodies within the first
months, assays targeting these antigen specificities – in contrast to RBD-specific antibody
measurements – are not optimal to assess the duration of seroprotection. Overall, respiratory
symptoms alone were not useful in predicting a past infection with SARS-CoV-2. However,
anosmia/dysgeusia appeared to be a significant diagnostic marker, in particular for mild
COVID-19.

Introduction
The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has
led to dramatic restrictions in public life worldwide to mitigate the anticipated epidemic peak.1
At the early stage of the pandemic, data were missing to estimate the actual number of infected
individuals, including asymptomatic/oligosymptomatic cases that were left unreported due to
the limitations in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing capacity and strategy that was
initially confined to the fulfilment of case definitions. It was, therefore, difficult to assess the
actual risk of infection for employers with respect to shared workspaces and staff in contact
with customers. Where possible, employers facilitated employees´ work in home office mode
with the intention to reduce the number of social contacts and consequently, the risk of
infection.2
In order to estimate past infections irrespective of symptoms and a preceding PCR test, specific
and sensitive serological antibody tests, including neutralising assays, are necessary tools.3
Additionally, serological tests are an important instrument for epidemiological surveillance and
to assess whether/when herd immunity has been reached within a population.
Several validated serological formats are now in use, based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assays (ELISA) and chemiluminescence targeting different SARS-CoV-2 antigens.4 The target
antigens are the spike (S) protein with its receptor-binding domain (RBD), and the nucleocapsid
protein (NCP). Both antigens have been shown to induce robust antibody responses in infected
individuals.5,6 Another important question has emerged as to whether the detected antibodies
also indicate protection against reinfection. In this regard, testing for neutralising antibodies is
considered to be the gold standard as it additionally assesses antibody functionality, i.e. virus
inactivation.6 However, such testing is laborious, time-consuming and requires biosafety level
three laboratory space, and therefore not suitable for large-scale testing/seroprevalence surveys.
Along these lines, it is still unclear which test would prove most appropriate to describe
transmission patterns and to determine immunity upon virus contact in overall as well as in
defined populations (in contrast to individual analysis/neutralisation tests [NTs]).
With the beginning of an exponential increase in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases
in Austria, the government declared a public lockdown with March 16th, 2020. At this time, the
actual rate of infections was unknown and consequently, the risk of virus exposure for personnel
in various work settings.
The goal of the current study was to analyse the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific
antibodies at the beginning of the pandemic and over several months in a representative cohort
of employees from a large Austrian company. Besides, the evaluation of seroprotection and
persistence of protective antibodies were /critical aspects of this study for which several assays
were included to identify the most accurate test for large-scale seroepidemiological analysis.
The participants were included irrespective of a previous history of COVID-19 or experienced
symptoms. Already before study onset, the employees were split into two groups, those sent
into home office and those remaining on-site. The accumulated basic demographic data (gender,
age, household size) and information on respiratory tract infections and symptoms, medical risk
factors and travel history were analysed in context with the SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody test

results. Employees with virus-reactive antibodies at the initial blood draw were invited for
follow-up blood draws at three and six months after study onset to analyse the persistence of
the detected antibody levels. At six months, also participants without detectable virus-reactive
antibodies at the initial blood draw were asked for a follow-up blood draw in order to detect
seroconversion and to assess the development of seroprevalence in the overall study population
over the last months.

Methods
Patients and samples
We included 1655 serum samples of employees working for a large company in Vienna. While
half of the staff continuously worked on-site with frequent client contacts, the other half worked
from home at the beginning of this trial followed by a weekly rotation between home office and
on-site work after the lockdown period in Austria. The blood samples were taken at the medical
centre of the company between 2nd and 17th April 2020 and sent in for further analysis (to the
Institute of Specific Prophylaxis and Tropical Medicine at the Medical University of Vienna.
The employees gave informed consent to SARS-CoV-2 serological testing and answered a
questionnaire covering demographic data and their medical history, including current
medications (see Supplement materials). The ethics committee of the Medical University of
Vienna approved this monocentric study (EK 1438/2020, EK 1746/2020).
Testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
The SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody levels were measured with four different serological
assays. After determining S1-specific IgG and IgA by ELISA, we further analysed those
presenting positive or borderline results for RBD- and NCP-specific antibodies and by a live
virus neutralisation test (at Takeda´s Global Pathogen Safety unit in Vienna) (for detailed
information see supplementary materials).
Statistical evaluation
Data were evaluated for the two groups (working on-site and from home) and the subgroups
stratified for age (15 to 25 years, 25 to 50 and above the age of 50). Seropositivity as a dependent
variable was evaluated in a general linear model for binominal counts (see supplementary
materials for more details).

Results
Study populations, demographic data
Overall, the study population consisted of 1655 volunteers, with an almost balanced
female/male ratio (53.53%/46.47%) (table 1, suppl. figure 1). The majority of the study
population (62.30%) was in the medium-age group (25-50 years). Higher percentages of the
medium-age and older age groups (53.83% and 62.78%, respectively) had been sent home to

work in contrast to only 27.88% of the young age group. In relative terms, 52.33% of the total
study population worked from home. Less than half of the participants (42.05%) reported that
they had experienced symptoms compatible with COVID-19 within the last three months before
the beginning of the study, with cough, rhinitis, sore throat, and fever being most frequently
mentioned (suppl. figure 2a). One quarter (23.63%) had risk factors in their medical history,
which potentially predisposed for a severe COVID-19 disease (suppl. figure 2b). However, 145
(8.76%) did not give details about the type of risk factors. Furthermore, 24.35% reported regular
medication uptake (table 1, suppl. figure 3).
Sample analyses
Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 S1-specific IgG and IgA antibodies revealed that 1487
participants (89.85%) were seronegative (figure 1a). Thus, 10.15% displayed S1-reactive
antibodies, among whom 16 (9.52%) were IgG-positive, 15 (893%) IgG-borderline, and 137
(81.55%) exhibited only IgA antibodies without IgG antibodies.
Further description of participants with antibodies reactive to S1 showed that COVID-19associated symptoms were recorded in 39.88% of the participants with and in 42.17% without
S1-reactive antibodies (figures 1b and c). With respect to the working situation, the highest rate
of S1-positive or -borderline participants was home office workers before and during the
beginning of the study (figure 1d). Regarding age, the highest number of participants with virusreactive antibodies were between 25 and 50 years old (medium-age group) (n=111, 6.71% of
all participants) (figure 1e).
The statistical analysis of the demographic and medical data revealed that three factors
significantly correlated with S1 seropositivity (table 2), i.e. (i) age, decreasing seropositivity
with increasing age, (ii) home office, and (iii) loss of taste and/or smell. Concerning symptoms,
anosmia/dysgeusia showed the highest probability for a positive virus (S1)-specific antibody
result (odds ratio 22.48), whereas the presence of any other reported symptom did not.
To further characterise antibody responses, all 168 sera with detectable S1-specific antibodies
were also tested for RBD- and NCP-specific antibodies. Only a part of the S1-reactive sera also
displayed RBD- or NCP-specific antibodies: 8.33% (14/168) had detectable RBD-specific total
antibodies, whereas ten of these sera were also positive for S1-specific IgG, with two IgG
borderlines and two IgG negatives (figure 2). The NCP-specific antibodies were positive in
6.55% (11/168) of the respondents with S1-reactive antibodies, with seven also being IgGpositive, one IgG-borderline and two IgG negatives. Of the S1-IgA-positive or -borderline
samples, two were positive for RBD and two for NCP (one of these for both).
Virus-neutralising antibodies are regarded as surrogate of protection. For detection of these
functional antibodies within the group of S1-positive sera, the NT, regarded as the gold standard
among the SARS-CoV-2-specific serological assays, was performed. The results revealed that
ten out of 16 S1-IgG-positive, two out of nine S1-IgG-borderline and only one of the S1-IgA
positive/borderline sera were also positive in the NT (figure 2, suppl. figure 5).
We then analysed whether the antibodies directed against the various SARS-CoV-2 antigens,
such as S1, RBD or NCP, correlated with the presence of neutralising/protective antibodies.

The RBD-specific antibodies showed the highest agreement with the NT – total antibodies,
kappa (k)=0.94; p<0.0001 and IgM (k=0.89; p<0.0001) (figure 3), indicating that these RBDspecific antibodies can be used as a predictor/surrogate for antibodies with protective
properties. By contrast, S1-specific IgA failed to show any correlation with the neutralising
antibody levels. Furthermore, the quantity (antibody level) of S1-specific IgG and IgA was not
predictive for a positive NT result (suppl. figure 5a and b).
All participants with neutralising antibodies reported symptoms, albeit of different qualities and
quantities (figure 4a). The most prominent symptom recorded by 69.23% of the NT-positive
participants was anosmia/dysgeusia (figure 4b). However, the number of symptoms did not
correlate with the level of the neutralisation titre (figure 4c). Of notice was that even in those
with risk factors and neutralising antibodies, indicating past infection, neither a severe course
of disease nor hospitalisation was reported. Regarding age distribution, the highest number of
NT-positive test results was found in those aged 25 to 50 years, with slightly more males
affected (53.85%) (figure 4d and e).
Antibody persistence
We were highly interested in exploring the longevity of robust seropositivity, i.e. detection of
protective/neutralising antibodies, in our study population. Therefore, all participants with
detectable virus-reactive antibody levels (n=168) were invited for further blood draws after
three and six months. Again, antibodies binding to S1, RBD, and NCP were measured. Only
the RBD-specific total antibody levels, which highly correlated with the neutralising antibodies,
showed stable persistence, indicating that protective antibodies maintained for at least six
months (figure 5). RBD-specific IgM was lost in 53.33% at already three months and remained
relatively stable thereafter. In contrast, S1-specific IgG and IgA antibody levels, which may
indicate virus contact but not necessarily protection, rather tended to decline within three
months in 37.5% and 53.68% of the participants, respectively (figure 5). Nevertheless, when
S1-specific IgG antibodies were detectable at three months, they further persisted in 90% of the
cases (9/10), also up to six months. NCP-specific IgG was lost in 9.09% at three months,
whereas 55.55% of NCP-specific IgG were lost at six months. Measurements of the total NCPspecific antibodies confirmed the result of the NCP-specific IgG assay and also showed that the
antibodies remained positive for three months (figure 5).
Changes in seroprevalence over six months
At six months, all participants were invited again to assess how seroprevalence evolved. In
total, we could evaluate antibody levels from 78.07% (1292/1655) volunteers, showing a nonsignificantly increased ratio of newly positives to those that became negative (chi² McNemar
p=0.212) for S1-reactive IgG (table 3). The prevalence of S1-reactive IgA antibodies decreased
(p > 0.001) compared to the initial blood draw. RBD IgM antibody positivity as well as NCP
IgG positivity increased over the six month period, although about 50% of previously positives
became negative. With regard to the RBD-specific total antibodies none of the previously
positive antibodies declined to negative concentrations, while 2.1% of the previously negative
became positive. This increase in RBD seropositivity as well as the stability of these antibodies
over a period of six months is expressed as ratio > 54 (table 3).

Discussion
In our longitudinal study, we aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence, seroprotection, and duration
of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in a representative cohort of 1655 working adults over at
least six months. An important aspect was to investigate which serological assay with respect
to antigen specificity would be most appropriate for large-scale screening of past infections and
seroprotection. Furthermore, we intended to investigate whether specific symptoms may serve
as prediction markers of seropositivity and whether specific demographic parameters or
working circumstances influenced the likelihood of virus contact/infection. Finally, we also
aimed to explore the duration of antibody responses and seroprotection up to six months.
Our study population comprised of three age groups ranging from 16 to 65 years representative
of the Austrian adult working population. For age, logistic regression analysis showed that the
likelihood of seropositivity decreased with age. At the initial blood draw, antibody screening
was performed using one of the first tests on the market, a S1-specific ELISA. Of all
participants, 10.15% had IgG and/or IgA antibodies (above the cut-off, including borderline
values) with 9.52% of these being positive for S1-specific IgG. These results correspond to
those of a preceding Austrian study, in which 1544 random PCR samples were tested between
the 1st and the 6th of April 2020, showing that the maximum prevalence of infected individuals
was 0.33% (upper 95% confidence interval value).7 Our results of S1-specific IgG antibodies
being prevalent in 0.97% of all participants would refer to the accumulated number of cases
until that time. Similar rates have been reported for population-based seroprevalence studies in
other European countries, while the rates have increased over time and varied substantially
(0.4% to 14%) within different geographical regions relating to the occurrence of major
infection clusters.8,9
At the beginning of the pandemic and throughout the Austrian pre-lockdown period, the
employer facilitated home office work for the majority of their employees, particularly those of
higher age and with potential risk factors for severe COVID-19. A certain number of
employees, mainly the younger individuals, continued to work on-site during the overall study
period, presumably exposing them to a higher risk of viral infection than those working from
home. It could be due to this fact that the majority of the youngest group of 15- to 25-year-old
employees, therefore, had the highest contact rates with colleagues or costumers, as this age
group showed the highest levels of seropositivity. The percentage of S1-specific antibodies was
lowest in the oldest age group, possibly explained by adequate compliance with the
recommended hygiene measures and contact restrictions. Surprisingly, a higher prevalence of
S1-specific antibodies was found in the group of participants working from home despite
correction for age. However, this observation may in part be attributed to a bias related to the
company´s policy that all employees with respiratory symptoms should stay at home.
Evaluation of the recent medical histories revealed that 42% of all participants had experienced
respiratory symptoms, such as cough, fever, sore throat, and rhinitis. Concurrent circulation of
other respiratory infections during winter and early spring could explain the fact that only some
of them had detectable antibodies against S1 (9.91%). Notably, while the overall appearance of

symptoms did not correlate with seropositivity, anosmia, or dysgeusia can be regarded as
predictive markers for infection with SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent seropositivity.
On the other hand, the relatively low number of S1 antibodies in relation to the recorded
symptoms may be ascribed to a fast waning of this antibody type, as was recently described by
other authors.10 Furthermore, it was previously reported that approx. 10% of (non-hospitalised)
patients presenting with mild COVID-19 did not mount detectable S1 antibody responses.11,12
Thus, as we do not have PCR results from all our participants with recorded symptoms, some
mild infections may have been missed in our study as well.
The improvement of the antibody test systems enabled detection of antibodies directed against
different antigenic regions, such as the RBD and the NCP. Recent studies have indicated that
the severity of symptoms/disease has an impact on antibody levels and possibly also on their
specificities.5,11-13 Along these lines, we tested the antibody responses for these additional
SARS-CoV-2 antigens within the group of participants, who had been identified as S1seropositive. Only 15.5% of the sera from participants with S1-specific antibodies also
displayed antibodies directed against RBD or NCP. Notably, S1-specific IgA ratios, even at
high levels, did not correspond with RBD- and NCP-specific antibody levels. This may be
because the specificity of this test varies between 73%14,15 and 94%, resulting in a very low
estimated positive predictive value of approx. 39% according to Gereuts van Kessel et al.16 The
low specificity of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA detection may be due to unspecific binding or
cross-reactions of antibodies with other respiratory viruses.14 Additionally, the role of serum
IgA in COVID-19 disease is not yet clear. The very high IgA titres may still follow contact with
the virus and could represent the mucosal activity of dimeric IgA – however, this needs to be
further confirmed.12 Thus, the overall lower specificity of both IgA and IgG antibodies against
S1, as reviewed recently,17 also suggests that S1-specific antibody ELISA is not the optimal
test for seroepidemiological surveys in low-prevalence settings (<5%) due to the reduced
positive predictive value.4,18
Importantly, we wanted to test whether the antibodies measured were also associated with
protection. In this respect, neutralising antibodies are regarded as surrogate marker of
protection.19 According to an experimental model with macaques, neutralising antibodies
against SARS-CoV-2 may play an essential role in protection against reinfection.20 In our study,
the total RBD antibodies showed the highest correlation (kappa = 0.9448) with the neutralising
antibodies of a live virus assay. Our data are supported by a recent study indicating that virus
neutralisation is linked to B cell epitopes of the S protein, in particular neutralising epitopes of
its RBD.21,22 In contrast to approx. 19% of S1-positive but asymptomatic participants, all of the
participants with neutralising antibodies also showed symptoms – even if some had only one or
two mild symptoms of which anosmia or dysgeusia was the most prevalent. Thus, anosmia or
dysgeusia may even be regarded as a highly reliable diagnostic marker in very mild cases, as
also proposed by other colleagues.23,24 Of note, we could not find a correlation between the
number of symptoms (implying severity) and the level of the neutralisation titre as supported
by other recently published data.25,26 Our data further indicate that in individuals with
anosmia/dysgeusia as a sole symptom, the quality and quantity of neutralising/protective
antibodies does not differ compared to those with several reported and typical COVID-19
symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnoea). Thus, our observation does not confirm suggestions that

people with mild symptoms do not develop robust protective/neutralising antibody
responses.5,27
Of major importance is the duration of protective immune responses. A recent study in COVID19 patients and patient contacts showed that S1-specific and neutralising antibodies could last
for up to five months.28 In contrast, a study in healthcare workers, though in a rather small
cohort, postulated that the virus-specific antibody responses to the S antigen are only of short
duration, in particular in individuals with mild or asymptomatic courses of disease.29
By analogy with the study authored by Patel et al., the results of our investigation indicate that
a high percentage of the S1-specific IgG and IgA antibodies declined already after three months.
Similarly, the NCP-specific antibodies also started to decline after three months. The drop in
S1-specific antibodies was most evident and may be explained by an asymptomatic or
oligosymptomatic course of the disease. Of interest, we here show that the kinetics of antibody
decline differed according to antibody specificity over time. While the S1-specific antibodies
decreased mostly within the first months, the NCP-specific IgG was solidly detectable for three
months and thereafter declined until up to six months. In total contrast, the RBD-specific
antibodies, correlating with the protective/neutralising antibodies, were consistently stable up
to six months, and the number/severity of symptoms did not affect the duration of
seroprotection. These results in mind, testing for RBD-specific antibodies should deliver the
most reliable results to determine seroprevalence up to several months after infection. In
contrast, cases may be lost already after three months when evaluating S1- or NCP-specific
antibody response. Considering data from the previous SARS-CoV-1 pandemic, during which
neutralising antibodies remained detectable in most patients for two years, it can be assumed
that the protective/neutralising antibodies will persist over the next months.30
With the observation time of six months, we can also analyse changes in seroprevalence. Our
results of the total study population show that in addition to the 0.85% RBD-positive
participants at the initial blood draw, 2% additionally became positive after 6 months, thus
reflecting the recorded increase in cases in Austria during the autumn of 2020. Further
evaluation covering up to one year is planned.
In summary, we report a low seroprevalence of 0.97% with regard to S1-specific IgG antibody
levels within the adult population at the early beginning of the pandemic. However, for
immunity and protection, i.e. detection of neutralising/protective antibodies, the percentage is
even lower with 0.85%. Importantly, these protective antibodies last for at least six months
irrespective of a mild/oligosymptomatic or polysymptomatic course of the disease. Of all
clinical symptoms, anosmia/dysgeusia was the most reliable symptom which was also
associated with the generation of robust neutralising antibodies. In contrast, respiratory
symptoms were not reliable diagnostic markers to predict antibodies or protection in the total
study population. Large-scale seroprevalence studies can benefit from the use of a screening
test with high SARS-CoV-2 specificity, as shown, RBD-specific assays could reliably detect
SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies for at least six months. Eventually, positive results may be
retested with an appropriate neutralisation test to confirm the protective capacity of these
antibodies.
