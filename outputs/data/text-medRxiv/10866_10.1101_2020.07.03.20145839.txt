ABSTRACT
Background: Mortality in care homes has had a prominent focus during the COVID-19
outbreak. Multiple and interconnected challenges face the care home sector in the
prevention and management of outbreaks of COVID-19, including adequate supply of
personal protective equipment, staff shortages, and insufficient or lack of timely COVID-19
testing. Care homes are particularly vulnerable to infectious diseases.
Aim: To analyse the mortality of older care home residents in Wales during COVID-19
lockdown and compare this across the population of Wales and the previous 4-years.
Study Design and Setting: We used anonymised Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and
administrative data from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank to
create a cross-sectional cohort study. We anonymously linked data for Welsh residents to
mortality data up to the 14th June 2020.
Methods: We calculated survival curves and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models to
estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of mortality. We adjusted hazard ratios for age,
gender, social economic status and prior health conditions.
Results: Survival curves show an increased proportion of deaths between 23rd March and
14th June 2020 in care homes for older people, with an adjusted HR of 1·72 (1·55, 1·90)
compared to 2016. Compared to the general population in 2016-2019, adjusted care home
mortality HRs for older adults rose from 2·15 (2·11,2·20) in 2016-2019 to 2·94 (2·81,3·08) in
2020.
Conclusions: The survival curves and increased HRs show a significantly increased risk of
death in the 2020 study periods.

INTRODUCTION
Background
Mortality in care homes has had a prominent worldwide focus during the COVID-19 outbreak
[1], [2] but few detailed analyses have been conducted. Care homes are a keystone of adult
social care. They provide accommodation and care for those needing substantial help with
personal care, but more than that, they are people’s homes [2], [3]. In 2016, there were
11,300 care homes in the UK, with a total of 410,000 residents [4]. Within care homes
people live in proximity, and may live with frailty and many different health conditions,
making them susceptible to outbreaks of infectious disease [3]. COVID-19 is described by
Lithande et al, as ‘…a dynamic, specific and real threat to the health and well-being of older
people’ (2020,p.10) [5]. The impacts of COVID-19 on this population group have been
reported widely in both international and UK media, and in a growing peer reviewed
literature.

Multiple and interconnected challenges face the care home sector in the prevention and
management of outbreaks of COVID-19[2]. In the literature, these challenges are reported to
include poor access and supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) for care home
staff [1], [2], [6], [7], staff shortages [1], [2], insufficient or lack of timely COVID-19 testing [2],
[6] and related clinical challenges as some older adults with COVID-19 may be
asymptomatic, or not display expected symptoms [1], [2], [5], [6]. Once there is an outbreak
the disease can spread quickly within a care home setting, and be difficult to contain [6]–[8].
A further challenge is in managing the impact of practices to shield care home residents and
isolate those who are infected. These practices can result in social isolation from families,
friends and communities, with negative impacts on health and wellbeing [2], [5]. Set against
these challenges is the caring, innovative, and resilient response of care home staff and
residents in managing the situations they face [9].

This confluence of events in the context of the pandemic, and impacts for residents, their
families and care home staff, has been framed as a human rights issue [10]. In the UK there
is also contestation regarding the implications of underinvestment in the care home sector,
and the interface with the health sector, for example, of the rapid hospital discharge policies
in the early period of the lockdown [7], [11], [12]. COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving complex
issue requiring near real time data, analyses and a multidisciplinary team to devise,
implement and evaluate a wide variety of inter- and cross-sectoral interventions to minimise
population harm.

The use of existing anonymised routinely collected longitudinal data can help to provide
rapid access to large-scale data for studies and provide robust evidence for commissioning
decisions and policy [13]. In this study, we utilise the Secure Anonymised Information
Linkage (SAIL) Databank [14]–[16] to investigate mortality in care homes in Wales in the
initial phase of the UK lockdown, and compare this with corresponding data from the four
most recent years to estimate excess mortality.

Research Questions
We aimed to compare the mortality risk for older care home residents (60+) in Wales for
each year between 2016 and 2020. To do this we performed two sets of analyses:
1. How does mortality in care homes for older adults compare between 2016-2020?
2. How does care home mortality for older adults compare between 2020 and 2016-2019 in
context of the population of Wales?

METHODS
Study design
We used anonymised Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and administrative data from the
Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank to create a cross-sectional cohort
study.

Data sources
Our cohorts were created using data held within the SAIL Databank [14]–[16]. The SAIL
Databank contains longitudinal anonymised administrative and healthcare records for the
population of Wales. The anonymisation is performed by a trusted third party, the National
Health Service (NHS) Wales Informatics Service (NWIS). The SAIL Databank has a unique
individual anonymised person identifier known as an Anonymous Linking Field (ALF) and
unique address anonymised identifier known as a Residential Anonymous Linking Field
(RALF)[17] that are used to link between data sources at individual and residential levels,
respectively. Individual linking fields, nested within residential codes, are contained in the
anonymised version of the Welsh Demographic Service Dataset (WDSD), replacing the
identifiable names and addresses of people registered with a free-to-use General
Practitioner service.

Our cohort of older care home residents was determined by linking to an existing index for
anonymised care home addresses from a previous project[18] and utilising the WDSD for
address changes. We determined if someone was a care home resident by linking their deidentified address information to the residences indexed as a care home in the WDSD. The

anonymised care home index was created using the Care Inspectorate Wales (CIW) [19]
data source from 2018 and assigning a Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN) to
each address[20]. We included care homes with a classification of either care homes for
older adults, or care homes for older adults with nursing in our list. The UPRN was doubleencrypted into a project level RALF and uploaded into SAIL to create a deterministic match
to the WDSD. From an analysis perspective, both residents and care homes are deidentified prior to any analysis.

Setting & Participants
To answer our research questions we created separate data sets, both with different settings
and participants.
1. Initially we focussed on the phase of the UK lockdown for the COVID-19 pandemic, from
March 23rd to June 14th 2020, and compared the mortality risk of care home residents to
those in the corresponding period in previous years (2016-2019). Individuals in Wales
aged 60+ years identified in the SAIL Databank as a resident in a care home on March
23rd in one of our study years (2016–2020). We created 5 cohorts, one for each year of
study, and treated these as independent.
2. We compared the mortality risk of being in a care home at the population level between
January 1st 2020 – April 30th 2020 and January 1st 2016 – December 31st 2019. We used
the WDSD to create population wide cohorts, this included all individuals resident in
Wales from 2016 – 2020. We stratified the dataset in to four sub-groups for comparison:
a. Non care home residents, resident in Wales on 1/1/2016. Residents were
followed up until they moved out of Wales, died, or 31/12/2019.
b. Non care home residents, resident in Wales from 1/1/2020 to 30/4/2020.
Residents were followed up until they moved out of Wales, died, or 30/04/2020.
c. Care home residents, resident in a care home for older people in Wales on
1/1/2016. Residents were followed up until they moved out of Wales, died, or
31/12/2019.
d. Care home residents, resident in a care home for older people in Wales from
1/1/2020 to 30/4/2020. Residents were followed up until they moved out of
Wales, died, or 30/04/2020.

Hospital Frailty Risk Score
The Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) was developed using Hospital Episode Statistics
(HES), a database containing details of all admissions, Emergency Department attendances
and outpatient appointments at NHS hospitals in England, and validated on over one million
older people using hospitals in 2014/15 [21]. The HFRS uses the International Classification

of Disease version 10 [22] (ICD-10) codes to search for specific conditions from secondary
care. A weight is then applied to the conditions and a cumulative sum is used to determine a
frailty status of: Low, Intermediate or High. We additionally included a HFRS score of ‘No
score’ for people who had not been admitted to hospital in the look back period. We
calculated the HFRS using the Patient Episode Database for Wales (PEDW), the Welsh
counterpart to HES, on the entry date for each of our studies, with a two year look back of all
hospital admissions recorded in Wales.

Outcome of interest – Mortality
We used a combination of the Office of National Statistics (ONS) Annual District Death
Extract (ADDE) ,WDSD, and Consolidated Death Data Source (CDDS) to link historic and
current mortality information. The CDDS is a combination of the ONS mortality data along
with the death records found in the Master Patient Index (MPI), and was used to identify
deaths in 2020, the ADDE and WDSD were used to identify deaths from 2016-2019.

Demographics
Additional demographic information was taken from the WDSD. The WDSD includes the
week of birth, the 2011 Lower layer Super Output Area (LSOA) used to assign the 2019
Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD), and gender. We calculated the age of
individuals on the study start date for each of our analyses.

Statistical methods
Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves
For our first analysis, the Kaplan-Meier survival function was estimated from 23rd March to
14th June for each year of care home residency (2016 – 2020).

Cox regression
Cox regression was used to determine hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality with 95% confidence
intervals. Adjusted hazard ratios included: the cohort year, care home residency, age,
gender, HFRS and WIMD (2019 version). We included a cluster level effect for each
residence. Computation restrictions meant we were unable to include a cluster level effect
for the second analysis.

RESULTS
Research question 1: How does mortality in care homes for older adults compare
between 2016-2020?

Sensitivity analyses
To check the influence of individuals being present in more than one cohort we have
included the number of individuals who are common across each study year in Table S1. We
independently calculated adjusted HRs for the 2020 cohort against each of the study years,
the results are presented in Table S2. We also present the HRs without a cluster level effect

DISCUSSION
Our results show a substantial excess mortality and substantial reduction in survival in care
home residents during the first phase of the lockdown period, when compared to previous
years and after adjustment for age, sex, deprivation and hospital frailty risk score. The
baseline demographics shown in Table 1 show a consistent trend across each study year
with the exception of mortality in 2020. This is consistent with the diverging Kaplan-Meier
curves displayed in Figure 1 and the increased hazard ratios for the cohort year presented in
Table 2. The HR for the cohort year remains statistically insignificant for 2017/18/19 when
compared to 2016, but the HR for 2020 is consistently greater than 1·7 for each of the
models presented. We adjusted for age, gender, HFRS and WIMD in the models. It was
found that age, gender (male), and increasing HFRS led to an increased HR for mortality.
This is consistent with previous studies, where frailty has been shown to be a determinant of
mortality [23]–[25]. We found that the WIMD was statistically insignificant and did not alter
the remaining HRs for mortality when included in the first analysis, but was a significant
factor in the population level analyses. The cluster effect term indicated there was variation
between care homes, this is likely because of differences in the case mix of care home
residents and the varying exposure to COVID cases.

The KM curves may indicate a flattening of the divergence in mortality in more recent weeks.
We plan to repeat these analyses as more data become available. Inclusion of data on the

timing of interventions and policy changes, both across the health care system and in care
homes would help understand the effectiveness of different approaches on reducing
transmission of infection and clinical outcomes.

Table 3 details the differences in demographic information between care home residents and
the general population. Specifically, the care home residents are more likely to be women
and have increased mortality, frailty and age. The analysis in Table 4 indicated a higher risk
of mortality for care home residents compared to the general population. The analysis also
showed an increased risk of mortality in care homes in 2020 compared to the 2016-2019
counterparts. Interestingly, the mortality risk of the general population in 2020 compared to
2016-2019 was statistically insignificant, further highlighting the increased risk of mortality in
care homes in 2020.

Limitations
Although we used a consistent list of anonymised care home addresses there is a varying
number of care homes included in each year of study. This is due to the list of care homes
being created from the 2018 extract from CIW, and care homes being opened and closed.
We aimed to mitigate bias in our comparisons by using a consistent list across study years.

Our cohorts were created at cross sectional time points, this means that individuals may
appear in more than one cohort. Although we calculated the covariates at the individual level
at the start of each cohort interval, there may still remain correlation between the cohorts.

CONCLUSIONS
We performed a retrospective population-based cohort study, comparing the mortality risk in
care homes between 2016 – 2020. It was found that the mortality risk in care homes has
increased significantly in 2020 compared to previous years. The conclusion of increased
mortality risk in 2020 remained the same when we included additional demographic
variables, the HFRS, and increased the observation window.
