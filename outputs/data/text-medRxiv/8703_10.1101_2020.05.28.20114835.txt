1. Abstract
1.1. Background/Purpose

49

We share our experience in COVID-19 pneumonia management at Saint George Hospital

50

University Medical Center (SGHUMC) in Lebanon. In the absence of a standard of care,

51

early diagnosis and opt-in therapy with Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin were offered.

52

1.2. Methods

53

We reviewed records of COVID-19 pneumonia patients from March 16-April 26 2020. Based

54

on NEWS score, we stratified patients as A: low B: medium, and C: high clinical severity and

55

obtained pharmacotherapy data. Chest-CT-severity-score (CTSS) was used. We defined

56

clinical cure as resolution of symptoms and biomarkers and virologic cure as a PCR above 35

57

cycles(Ct).

58

1.3. Results

59

We recorded 21 COVID-19 pneumonia patients of whom 19 opted for treatment. Clinical

60

symptoms and laboratory markers at presentation did not significantly correlate with severity.

61

Lower initial viral load significantly correlated with lower levels of clinical and radiological

62

severity (p=0.038). Virologic cure, Ct>35, by day 10, was only 33% in high severity

63

significantly less than categories A and B. We observed 100% clinical cure at day 10 in

64

Category-A, 67% in B, and 33% in C(p<0.05). Patients with the lowest severity had the

65

fastest virologic cure in a mean of 5.8 days from diagnosis, shortest hospitalization and

66

earlier radiological improvement(p<0.005). Ultimately, 18 patients were discharged home in

67

good condition and one remains in the ICU.

68

1.4. Conclusion:

69

Viral dynamics matter in COVID-19 pneumonia. An early control of replication may be

70

crucial in averting complications. Early administration of Hydroxychloroquine and

2. Introduction

80

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that is taking the world as we know it by storm.

81

In Lebanon, on February 21 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was first diagnosed in a female

82

returning from the epicenter in Iran. Subsequently, the Lebanese government closed early

83

on schools and enterprises, banned gatherings, and advised social distancing and home

84

quarantine. Until April 26 2020, Lebanon is at 704 cases in a country of an estimated 6.7

85

million inhabitants.1

86

Globally, the approaches to managing COVID-19 pandemic are diverse. One method

87

advocates conservative, home-stay for mild cases while reserving diagnostics and medical

88

intervention for severe cases. Another main strategy is almost opposite and relies on early

89

diagnosis by offering RT-PCR testing2,3.

90

At Saint George Hospital University Medical Center (SGHUMC) in Lebanon, we

91

formed the SGHUMC COVID-19 response team and carefully reviewed existing

92

evidence and management strategies. We opted for an early detection approach.

93

We tested all incoming patients with an acute respiratory, febrile illness or known

94

exposure for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR, traced their contacts, and performed prompt

95

chest CT scan imaging as indicated.

96

In the absence of a standard of treatment for COVID-19, we assessed available

97

therapies. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are readily available promising

98

combination with a familiar pharmacologic profile. On the other hand, lopinavir/ritonavir

99

lacks significant clinical benefits and remdesivir use is restricted to clinical trials or

100

compassionate use. These two options above are not available in Lebanon. IL-6 pathway

101

inhibitors and convalescent plasma treatment are in trial reserved for advanced COVID-

102

19. Therefore, we agreed to consider them on a case-by-case basis.4–9

103

In summary, patients with COVID-19 pneumonia chose either no pharmacological

104

treatment or the combination of Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Patients opting

105

for the Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin regimen consented verbally after having

106

the risks and potential benefits of this regimen well explained to them.

107

In this retrospective study, we share our experience with COVID-19 pneumonia

108

clinical and radiological presentations and outcomes, course of illness, and viral

109

dynamics.

3. Methods
3.1. Study setting and Design
We conducted this retrospective study at SGHUMC in Beirut, Lebanon, from
March 16, 2020 until April 26, 2020.
Patients were received via our Emergency Room and Corona Clinic or as
transferals requiring urgent critical care, some of which were COVID-19 confirmed.
We obtained exposure and contact history of all incoming patients with

117

respiratory or febrile illnesses and performed a physical exam. Nasopharyngeal and

118

oropharyngeal swabs were obtained for SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR. Chest CT imaging was

119

done within 3 days of diagnosis.

120

The SGHUMC response team was composed of infectious disease physicians,

121

pulmonary and critical care physicians, radiologists, infection preventionists, nursing

122

department, laboratory department, and a representative from hospital leadership.

123

Clinical and virologic cure was assessed at day 10 from diagnosis. Patients were

124

followed until complete clinical and virologic clearance, defined as the overall outcome.

125

3.2. Inclusion Criteria

126

In our analysis, we included all patients that were positive for SARS-CoV-2

127

by RT-qPCR with findings of pneumonia on chest CT scan and had received

128

Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for at least 72 hours.

129

3.3. Data Collection

130

We retrieved data from the electronic database of the COVID-19 clinic and

131

emergency care service. We recorded patient age, gender, history of cardiovascular

132

disease, hypertension, chronic lung conditions, diabetes mellitus, malignancy, and any

133

immunosuppressive therapy. We also recorded possible exposure history and

134

reported symptoms of cough, fever, headache, shortness of breath, chills, myalgias,

135

sore throat, rhinorrhea, and diarrhea.

136

The time from symptom onset to diagnosis, imaging and treatment initiation,

137

length of hospital stays, the need for oxygenation, and whether the patient was

138

transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) were retrieved. Laboratory markers

139

included CBC, Creatinine, CRP, Troponin, Procalcitonin, Urea, Na, K, Ca, Mg, AST,

140

ALT, Bilirubin, LDH, D-Dimer, Ferritin, and Fibrinogen depending on the case.

141

We considered day zero as the day of diagnosis of COVID-19 by RT-qPCR.

142

At day 10, patients were assessed for clinical and virologic cure. Some patients

143

underwent a repeat chest CT scan.

144
145

3.4. Clinical Assessment:
We used the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) and chest CT scan findings to

146

assess acute clinical severity on admission. 10 The NEWS is based on physiologic

147

parameters that include respiratory and heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, use

148

of supplemental oxygen, and state of consciousness. A NEWS score of 0-4, 5-6, and 7-15

149

respectively corresponded to low, medium, and high scores. For the sake of data analysis,

150

we then divided our cohort into categories A, B, and C according to low, medium, and

151

high NEWS score.

152
153
154

We define clinical cure as the resolution of symptoms, clinical stabilization, and
normalization of inflammatory markers.
Patients were managed as inpatients or followed as outpatients depending on

155

their clinical severity. Outpatients were discharged with strict instructions and

156

education, and were called for follow up every 2 days.

158

RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal samples. Real-time

159

reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) detection of SARS-CoV-2 was done using the

160

LightMix® Modular SARS-CoV-2 (COVID19) E, N, and RdRP-genes (Tib

161

Molbiol, Berlin, Germany) as previously described.11,12 We used the cycle number

162

threshold values (Ct) as an indicator of the number of copies of SARS-CoV-2 present

163

in our samples. We define virologic cure as 2 consecutive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR

164

with Ct>35, as previously described.13

165

We considered a patient with virologic cure by day 10 of diagnosis a fast

166

responder and a slow responder if more than 10 days. All patients were followed with

167

serial RT-PCR till negative, beyond limit of detection of the test, as part of SGHUMC

168

infection control strategy.

169
170
171
172

We also tested for other pathogens using Biofire® FilmArray® Respiratoy 2
Panel (BioMerieux, France) following manufacturer’s instructions.
3.6. Radiologic Assessment:
Non-enhanced low-dose chest CT scans were obtained in supine position on a

173

"GE Healthcare: Discovery CT750 HD” CT scanner, dedicated for confirmed or

174

suspected COVID-19 patients. Patients were instructed to hold their breath, and

175

acquisition was made at end-inspiration.

176

COVID-19 typical findings were recorded, including: (a) ground-glass

177

opacities, (b) dense airspace consolidation, (c) interlobular septal thickening, (d)

178

vascular enlargement, (e) peripheral, subpleural distribution, and (f)

179

multifocal/multilobar/bilateral involvement. The presence of pleural effusion and

180

other findings atypical for pneumonia was also assessed. Chest CT severity score

181

(CTSS) was determined to estimate the severity of lung involvement in patients with

182

COVID-19 pneumonia. The scoring system was adapted from similar scoring systems

12

183

used in recent COVID-19 literature. 14,15 A score of 0, 1, 2, or 3 (corresponding to

184

involvement of 0%, 0-25%, 25-50%, and >50% respectively) was assigned for each

185

lobe of the 5 lung lobes with a maximum total score of 15. Therefore, if a patient has

186

a CTSS of 15, it indicates that there is more than 50% involvement of the lung.

187

Interval improvement and resolution is a decrease in CTSS and/or subjective decrease

188

in ground-glass opacities density.

189

All images were anonymized then analyzed by two experienced radiologists

190

(R.A. and R.R.) independently. In case of discrepant CT findings or CTSS, a final

191

decision was reached by consensus.

193

3.7. Treatment:
3.7.1. Pharmacologic therapy for patients receiving Hydroxychloroquine and

194

azithromycin

195

We verified for any drug-drug interactions, G6PD deficiency and

196

contraindications, and we obtained an ECG. If QTc<460msec, treatment was initiated.

197

16

198

monitoring by telemetry if needed. ECG was repeated on day 2 and day 10 upon

199

completion of therapy.

200

When QTcB>460msec, we consulted a cardiologist that ordered continuous cardiac

We administered 600mg of Hydroxychloroquine per os per day for 10 days

201

and a 500mg loading dose of azithromycin followed by 250mg/day for 4 days

208

Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis H test was applied to assess for differences between

209

categories. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess improvement in

210

CTSS values on follow-up CT. A Spearman's rank-order correlation was used for

211

interrater reliability between the radiologists' CTSS. The rank-based Jonckheere-

212

Terpstra test was applied to trend the 3 clinical severity groups and cycle threshold

213

numbers. P-values<0.050 were significant.

214
215

3.9. Ethical Statement:
We obtained SGHUMC IRB approval for a retrospective review of the charts of

216

COVID-19 patients. It is standard procedure that all patients sign a general informed

217

consent for receiving medical acts and care.

4. Results

219

Out of 860 patients that presented to our COVID-19 clinic, 27 patients had SARS-

220

CoV-2 RT-PCR positive nasopharyngeal swabs at our institution. Six of the 27 patients

221

were asymptomatic with a normal chest CT scan. Two of the remaining 21 patients with

222

COVID-19 typical pneumonia features on chest CT scan refused pharmacologic

223

treatment and followed-up with their physicians. These 8 patients were excluded.

224
225
226

Finally, 19 patients were included, all opting for treatment with the combination of
Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.
To note, two patients, not diagnosed nor initially treated at SGHUMC, were

227

transferred to SGHUMC for critical care. Both had advanced COVID-19 and died within

228

72 hours of admission. These two patients were excluded.

229

The mean age in our study cohort was 57.8±16.4 years. Category A of low clinical

230

severity was composed of 4 males and 6 females, with a median age of 51[28;85].

231

Category B was composed of 5 males and 1 female, median age 59[52;67]. Category C

232

was composed of 2 males and 1 female, median 81[55;87]. No statistical difference

233

observed in ages across the 3 categories. We observed a higher ratio of 11 males to 8

234

females.

235

As for comorbidities, 4 patients in category A had hypertension (HTN) and another 4

236

had dyslipidemia. In category B, one patient was a smoker with mild chronic bronchitis,

237

and another one had coronary artery disease (CAD), HTN, and dyslipidemia. In category

238

C, one patient had CAD, HTN and dyslipidemia while another was a smoker. None of the

239

patients were known diabetics.

240

Only 1 patient with COVID-19 pneumonia of medium NEWS score was co-infected

241

with RSV.

242

4.1. Clinical Course and Cure

243

The median duration from initial symptom onset to diagnosis of COVID-19

244

was 3.5[1;18] days in category A, 8[2;12] days in category B and 4[2;8] days in

245

category C. This was not statistically significant.

246

At initial evaluation, there was no significant variation between symptoms

247

reported by patients. They reported fever in 15/19, cough in 13/19, shortness of

248

breath in 9/19, myalgias in 5/19, sore throat in 4/19, chills in 2/19, headache in 2/19,

249

and 1/19 with fatigue. Anosmia was reported by 1 patient.

250
251
252

We also found no significant difference in laboratory markers among patients
of all categories upon presentation.
4.1.1. Clinical Course

253

The length of stay of patients in category A was a mean of 3±4.8 days, median

254

1[0;12] days, significantly lower than both category B at a mean of 11±4.8 days; median

255

12.5[3,16] days (p=0.032) and category C at a mean of 20±8.5 days, median of 19[12,29]

256

days(p=0.015). No statistical significance in LOS between medium and high clinical

257

severity.

258

There was no distinct pattern for progression of laboratory markers. However, when

259

peak values are reached, it took 4-6 days to return to baseline. This was independent of

260

initial clinical severity. Table 1 represents the results of available blood tests during the

261

study period per category. On average, category A of low clinical severity had an overall

262

significantly lower CRP, Procalcitonin, LDH, Ferritin, D-Dimer, and lymphopenia.

263
264

4.1.2. Clinical Cure at day 10:
All patients in category A achieved clinical cure on day 10 compared to 4/6 in

265

category B. In category C, only 1 patient achieved clinical cure at day 10. Thus,

266

100% clinical cure at day 10 in low clinical severity, 67% in medium severity, and

267

33% in high severity COVID-19. This trend was statistically significant (p=0.031).

268
269

4.1.3. Overall Clinical Outcome
Eighteen out of 19 patients were discharged home in good condition, a clinical

270

success rate of 94.7%. Only 1 patient in category C was still on mechanical

271

ventilation. This patient is the eldest in the cohort at 87 years and had the highest

272

NEWS score of 9 on admission.

273
274
275
276

None of the patients developed any drug related adverse events.
4.2. Virologic Load Dynamics
4.2.1. Initial Viral Load:
A higher initial SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Ct reflects a lower viral load. There was a

277

statistically significant trend of higher Ct value with lower levels of clinical severity

278

(p=0.038). Median Ct in category A was 33.5(13,38) which is significantly lower than

279

that of category B at Ct= 30[23,35]. This was also significantly lower than the initial

280

Ct in category C of 24[13,29] (Figure 1A).

281

4.2.2. Virologic Outcome at Day 10

282

In category A, PCR results were available for only 8/10 patients, and 6/8 patients

Patients with lower clinical severity reached virologic cure significantly faster
than those of higher severity (p=0.042).
4.3. Radiologic Findings:
There was a strong, positive correlation between the two readers R.A. and
R.R., which was statistically significant (rs(36) = 0.958, p < 0.001).
All patients had a chest CT scan done within 3 days of COVID-19 diagnosis.

300

To note, the median time from symptom onset to imaging was 3 days for categories A

301

and C and 8 days for category B. (p = 0.842).

302

On initial CT, there was a statistically significant difference in chest CT

303

Severity Score(CTSS) between the 3 categories (p = 0.012) (Figure 1B). Patients of

304

category B showed the highest median CTSS of 10/15 compared to A and C (4/15 (p

305

= 0.003) and 6/15 (p = 0.192), respectively). (Figures 3,4).

306

Only 15 patients underwent follow-up chest CT scans at a median of 14 days

307

(range 10-26 days). Thirteen (87%) patients showed significant interval improvement

308

of which two patients showed complete resolution (p = 0.031). (Figure 5)

309

The remaining two patients with worsening features on second CT showed

310

significant improvement on the subsequent third CT scan (Figure 6), obtained on day

311

20 and 29 respectively.

312

The median follow-up interval from time of diagnosis to radiological

313

improvement for the 15 patients was: 14 (10-24), 12 (10-29), and 20 (14-26) days for

314

categories A, B, and C respectively.

5. Discussion
At SGHUMC, 78% of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 had pneumonia on chest CT

318

scan. Symptoms such as shortness of breath and dyspnea were not reliably predictive of

319

disease severity. Our low threshold to perform chest CT scan was crucial in early diagnosis.

320

In our cohort, an initially low viral load was associated with less severe clinical and

321

radiological findings, and faster viral clearance. All patients in category A achieved clinical

322

cure in 10 days and had the fastest virologic cure in a mean 5.8 days from diagnosis. In

323

contrast, only 56% of patients of higher clinical severity achieved clinical cure in 10 days,

324

had longer hospital stays, and a more prolonged viral shedding. A recent study on 1061

325

patients with COVID-19 at IHU-Mediterranee Infection in Marseille, France showed that

326

patients with higher initial viral load were less likely to have a low clinical severity and more

327

likely to have poor virologic outcome.17Our results are consistent with their findings

328

confirming that initial viral load and kinetics of viral clearance matter in COVID-19.

329

In many viral infections, early control of viral replication is crucial for better outcomes.

330

Hydroxychloroquine has an antiviral effect that is proven in-vitro and in-vivo.18–23 We had a

331

94.7% success rate in treating a fairly complex cohort of COVID-19 pneumonia, with 18/19

332

patients discharged at baseline conditions. None of our 19 pneumonia patients had a cytokine

333

storm, and all had a rapid decline within 4 days from peak inflammatory laboratory markers.

334

The latter is likely a result of virologic control and possible early attenuation of cytokine

335

storm. 7,24,25

336

Chest CT scan is a helpful diagnostic tool but also serves to monitor progression. Thirteen

337

of 15 follow-up chest CT scans improved within 14 days. The remaining two showed

338

improvement in a third scan beyond 20 days. In fact, all patients improved, showing either

339

complete resolution or marked improvement in the CT findings, mainly ground-glass

340

opacities and parenchymal consolidations. A follow-up chest CT may be necessary in

341

patients with COVID-19 to monitor for secondary organizing pneumonia and subsequent

342

fibrosis, similar to outcomes seen with SARS and MERS.14 We will continue to monitor our

343

patients for such complications despite the current significant radiologic improvement.

344

Our observational retrospective cohort is not designed to measure the direct impact of

345

hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin treatment on the outcome of COVID-19 pneumonia.

346

However, in 10 days, 80% of patients with varying severity of pneumonia reached clinical

347

cure, and 70% achieved a virologic cure. Hence, early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia

348

coupled with administering Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin treatment contributed to

349

faster clinical and radiologic resolution and virologic clearance, potentially averting

350

complications.

351

In conclusion, it is clear that higher viral load and prolonged viral shedding results in a

352

longer and more complex clinical course. Our experience in early patient tracing, testing,

353

chest imaging, and treatment of COVID-19 of mild, moderate, and severe pneumonia with

354

Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin resulted in a 95% success rate with no mortality.

355

Further studies outside of a pandemic setting are needed to fully and fairly demonstrate the

356

impact of early treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia with Hydroxychloroquine and

357

azithromycin on overall patient outcome, long-term lung damage and reduction of the

358

transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
