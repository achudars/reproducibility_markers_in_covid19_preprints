Abstract
Background COVID-19 is a virus which has lead to a global pandemic.
Worldwide, more than 130 countries have imposed severe restrictions, which
form part of a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI)s. We aimed to
quantify the country-specific effects of these NPIs and compare them using
the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) stringency
index, p, as a measure of NPI stringency.
Methods We developed a dual latent/observable Susceptible Infected Recovered Deaths (SIRD) model and applied it on each of 22 countries and 25
states in the US using publicly available data. The observable model parameters were extracted using kernel functions. The regression of the transmission
rate, β, as a function of p in each locale was modeled through the interven1

tion leverage, αs , an initial transmission rate, β0 and a typical adjustment
time, b−1
r .
Results The world average for the intervention leverage, αs = 0.01 (95%
CI 0.0102 - 0.0112) had an ensemble standard deviation of 0.0017 (95% C.I.
0.0014 - 0.0021), strongly indicating a universal behavior.
Discussion Our study indicates that removing NPIs too swiftly will result in
the resurgence of the spread within one to two months, in alignment with the
current WHO recommendations. Moreover, we have quantified and are able
to predict the effect of various combinations of NPIs. There is a minimum
NPI level, below which leads to resurgence of the outbreak (in the absence
of pharmaceutical and clinical advances). For the epidemic to remain subcritical, the rate with which the intervention leverage αs increases should
outpace that of the relaxation of NPIs.

1. Introduction
A novel corona virus, named COVID-19, was detected in the Hubei
province of China in late December 2019 and rapidly spread resulting in
a confirmed global pandemic by 11 March 2020 1 . As at 26 April 2020, the
total number of infections has exceeded 3.1 million confirmed cases with more
than 210 thousand deaths worldwide attributable to the effects of the virus 2 .
A large, worldwide modeling effort is currently underway to improve health
policy decision making with regards to the COVID-19 pandemic 3–7 . Many
research groups and national response teams have looked into country specific intervention strategies 4,6–9 .
Recently, the total level of NPI stringency has been classified by the Oxford
COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) team and a nominal
index measure has been defined for use by the wider international community. We address the use of this index measure to establish the degree and
characteristics of control of the transmission rate of the virus within a representative sample of countries in the World and states in the United States
of America.

2. Research in Context
2.1. Evidence before this study
Multiple teams have produced epidemic models which allow for the prediction of response to NPIs within their given locale. The typical complexity
and bespoke nature of these models has meant that transferring insights from
one country to another has been challenging. Comparing sufficient statistics
(where they have been defined) amongst multiple other countries has not
been done before.
2.2. Added value of this study
By comparing a wide variety of locales; we have shown a universality of
form in response to changes in NPIs. Our modeling paradigm is succinct
and requires only a few observable parameters to be measured in addition
to what is presently done for successful control. These parameters allow for
predicting not only how much effect a given NPI level has, but also how long
we need to wait before we observe the effects.

41

2.3. Implications of the available evidence
The insight our research offers is a worldwide survey of the dynamics and
characteristics various countries possess with regards to the control of the
pandemic, through non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI)s. Policy makers
may now gradually control their local epidemic within their contextual situation without having to rely on the parameters derived from other countryspecific intervention studies. This quantification allows policy makers to
define safe limits of control.

For a fair comparison of the effect of interventions, carefully curated,
comprehensive and frequently updated data is a requirement. Data was,
therefore, sourced from the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 data repository because it fulfilled both the due diligence and frequency of updating needed for
this research. 10
Using this existing data up to and including 26 April 2020, multiple SIRD
with latent dynamics and error propagation models (see Appendix B for full
details) were employed. The chosen modeling method is simpler than others
used in this pandemic. 7 This is a feature since it is ’mind-sized’ and has a

number of sufficient statistics needed to understand the response to control.
An initial cohort of 23 countries and 25 states within the United States of
America were chosen to be as representative and diverse as possible.
Levels of control were measured by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) stringency index. 11 This index, denoted p in our
work, takes values from 0 to 100 and is indicative of the severity and number of discrete measures that have been taken to try to curb the spread of
COVID-19. 11
At the time of writing; America did not have a stringency index published.
Incorporating their reported NPIs into the OxCGRT framework described
fully in Appendix A.
Daily parameter estimates of the models were extracted from the data using
a least-squares framework and candidate kernel functions were regressed on
the daily parameter estimates. These kernel functions represent the time domain response of a model parameter to a given level of control and are based
on a dynamic hypotheses that additive effects of random variables contribute
to the observed effects of intervention. 12
This sort of exponential behaviour will cease to be representative if there is a
systematic breakdown in roll-out of the interventions (so called ’fat tails’). 13
If such a systematic breakdown were to happen, our proposed kernel functions would cease to be valid.
3.1. Model
The characteristics of the present pandemic are atypical in that infected
individuals may be asymptomatic and infectious. 14
To this end, we developed a dual observable/latent SIRD model to capture
the essential features of the present COVID-19 outbreak and allow for clear
interpretation with regards to control and decision making. This model is
depicted in Figure 1 and has several key parameters which completely characterise the behaviour.
The latent dynamics are essential to capture the following clinical properties
of COVID-19:
1. Asymptomatic cases are infectious 15,16 .
2. It is possible for deaths to be overstated since positive tests are not a
requirement in some locales for establishing the basic underlying cause
of death in this pandemic; reasonable clinical judgement is 17 . In addition, overstatements in clinical cases may be due to the highly infectious

nature of the virus; patients with severe comorbidities may not necessarily die with the virus as the basic underlying cause even though it
is likely to be present in the patient if they are admitted to a facility
with many active COVID-19 cases.
3. There are early reports that the latent prevalence (using a seroprevalence study) may be as high as 14% of one of the most densely populated
cities in the World 18 .
4. There have been serious calls for protection of front-line health care
workers as a result of early experiences with the epidemic 19,20 . The
nosocomial infections within hospital care providers as a group may be
non-negligible, though for the large scale model we are considering, this
group has not been partitioned separately.
The observable (directly measurable) dynamics capture the standard features
of susceptible portions of the population becoming infected and then either
recovering with perpetual immunity or dying.
There is evidence that relapse is possible, where recovered patients would
become susceptible again 21 . This model variation has not been explicitly
considered because do not know the significance of this yet; it is possible that
these are people who were not fully cured 21 , they may have been reinfected
with a different strain 16 , the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) test can give a positive result due to extracellular RNA, shedding
of non-viable virions etc.
Of note is that the implicit assumption with this approach is that there is
a single viral strain which is being modelled. If there are multiple strains,
each of which is observable and differentiable through specialised testing then
refinements on the labelling and parameters are possible.

3.2. Observable Dynamics
Under the stated clinical conditions the transmissions between known infected patients, I, and susceptible individuals (in the broadest sense possible)
should be rare. The typical disease progression time frame 14,22 implies that
latent infections leading to deaths should be rare, it is presumed that patients
with severe symptoms are brought in for treatment. Under these conditions
the latent dynamics in the model simplify with δL ≈ 0 and β ≈ 0 and this
model simplification is used throughout.
What is observed then, in terms of increase in measured infections I, is

3.3. Daily observed infection rate, φ
An important component for estimating φ is the number of positive individuals who do not know their status and are asymptomatic. Random
testing has proven useful in this regard in Iceland 16 and New York 18 .
Reliable estimates of asymptomatic cases due to either extensive randomised
testing or exhaustive testing in closed populations are presented in Table 1.
Unfortunately, the number of asymptomatic cases are approximately 50%
of all positive COVID-19 patients. The fraction of asymptomatic cases in
enclosed populations, the number of patients with antibodies present (due to
randomised population seroprevalence studies) and patients with symptoms
who are sub-clinical and do not warrant admission and formal testing will
also all influence the rate measured by φ.
3.4. Kernel functions
The roll-out of any country-wide control measure is subject to random
variations in timing and levels of civil compliance dependent on the execu6

tion plan and the populace’s disposition. This was modeled with the kernel
function, conditioned on the control measure p:

βp (t) = 1 + b0 e−br ∆t βf (p),
(1)
where βf (p) is the asymptotic value of the observed daily transmission rate, br
is the typical adjustment rate and b0 is used to model the initial transmission
rate before the control p is applied. A characteristic plot is depicted in Figure
2.
As a starting point, it is hypothesised that the typical adjustment rate br is
characteristic of a nation and that βf (p) is dependent on the stringency of
control p through:
βf (p) = β0 (1 − αs p),
(2)
where αs is the intervention leverage. In the absence of data on the population dynamics during withdrawal of some NPI’s, our model is conservative
and uses the same typical adjustment rate for the withdrawal of NPI’s as for
the addition of NPIs.
The kernel function for γ(t) is:

regardless of control. The clinical and physical justification for this model
is that the inherent properties of the recovery process do not change with
non-pharmaceutical control, assuming the hospital system has not been overwhelmed yet.

which is the result that would be theoretically expected from a cascade of
first order processes 27 . The temporary increase in this parameter is due to
the reduced number of severe infections which will artificially raise it since
δ ∝ I −1 , see (B.7). This function captures the transients inherent in the
daily death count as a result of intervention only.
3.5. Control
The capacity of countries to properly address the risk that COVID-19
poses is varied; with less than half being fully positioned to prevent, detect,
and respond appropriately 28 . The World Health Organisation identifies the
need to reduce human-to-human transmission of the virus using numerous
public health measures. 2
The effect of these various control policies on our latent model are depicted
in Figure 3. This Figure clearly demonstrates the value of the proposed
methodology; one may holistically view the epidemic and various policy actions in a single framework and be able to anticipate the consequences.
A method to measure the overall level of control is described next.

3.6. NPIs and the OxCGRT Stringency Index
The OxCGRT has developed a valuable database for comparing countries

Also included in this data set is a Stringency Index, p in our notation,
which provides a single number that captures the overall level of intervention implied by combinations of the ordinal numbers S1-S7. The Oxford
stringency index is calculated using a weighted average of the above seven
non-pharmaceutical interventions 30 .

As an example of the use of this index, the overall intervention level
is depicted in Figure 4, plotted against the number of days since the first

4. Results
The results, using the foregoing methodology are shown in Table 2 for
the selected countries in this study and in Table 3 for selected States of the
US. Results are expressed in terms of γ0 , d0 , β0 , b−1
r , pmax and αs in Table 2.
Table 3 does not display γ0 , as the data for the number of recoveries has
not been reported in the US since late March 10 . The first salient feature of
Tables 2 and 3 is that the evolution of the pandemic in different countries
share strong similarities. Some variations are observed in the parameters γ0 ,
d0 , β0 , where b−1
r is subjected to features of the data most likely to specifics
in the reporting. Of note though is the consistency of αs .
4.1. Ensemble variation of intervention leverage, αs
With a formal treatment, the following ensemble characteristics are observed with regards to the intervention leverage across all locales: the ensemble average intervention leverage is given by αs = 0.01 (95% CI 0.0102
- 0.0112) and the ensemble standard deviation is given by 0.0017 (95% C.I.
0.0014 - 0.0021). These results depend on the respective marginalisation over
a Gaussian noise process, a flat prior probability for the mean and a Jeffrey’s
prior for the variance. 12 Note that there were two outliers that were removed
from this calculation, Sweden and North Dakota and they are left for discussion.
Using the values from Tables 2 and 3, the expected control surfaces which

but the overall behaviour is remarkable.

5. Discussion
One of the most important results from Tables 2 and 3 is that, for the
bulk of countries and US States, the intervention leverage αs ≈ 0.01. It is
remarkable that this occurs whilst other parameters are measured to have a
great variety, especially β0 . This striking result also speaks to the universal
character of the stringency index used here to quantify NPIs.
The next most important result is the universal time domain response of the
transmission rate, β to a change in stringency of control as depicted in Figure
5. The ensemble averages of β and p produce a very clear exponential decay
to enhanced control which is well modeled by the kernel function proposed
in eq. (1). For visual confirmation, a representative sample of countries are
depicted in Figure 8.

5.1. Predictive capabilities of the model
The recent few weeks of extreme containment measures across the world
have yielded valuable data to allow for country-specific predictions. With
respect to transmission rate, our model can answer how much? change we
can expect to see and by when? we expect to see it as function of p; as seen
in eq. (5). This was derived using eqs. (1) and (2).
Hence,
β(t, p) = βf − (1 + e−br t )β0 αs ∆p,

where t = 0 corresponds to the end of the lockdown period and the enacting
of new interventions, such that p < pmax . The next few weeks of postlockdown actions by a number of countries and states may refute this model
and should be watched with interest.
5.2. Predictions for Italy
For illustration purposes, we choose the configuration of parameters obtained with Italian data, where φ = 0.1 is used (see Section 3.2). The scenario
considered here assumes that variations of the index occur after the last available data with ∆p = −10, −30.
Figure 9 depicts the time dependence of the number of symptomatic population, the active cases and the cumulative number of cases and fatalities.
One can appreciate that going from ∆p = −10 to ∆p = −30 has serious
consequences in terms of the time it takes to achieve the peak in active case
as well as the amplitude of the peak.
This is further illustrated in Figure 10, where the number of active cases
and daily fatalities are shown as a function of time for different ∆p ranging
from -10 to -50. The time required for the peak to occur would go from over

six months to about four and the amplitude of the peak would double for a
relaxation of ∆p = −20 instead of ∆p = −10. The uncertainty envelope in
these predictions is driven primarily by the ensemble variation of αs , which
is of order of 10%. This is considered to be a more realistic estimate of the
potential deviation from the linear behavior assumed in eq. (2). The other
source of uncertainty is the daily recovery, γ, which is much smaller. Graphs

in Figure 9 display the bands that incorporate these uncertainties.
Figures 9 and 10 predict that releasing containment measures too swiftly
would lead to the resurgence of very large peaks of symptomatic infections
within a month or two, leading to even worse outcomes compared to those
observed so far.
5.3. Main synthesis: acceptable NPI control levels
Our entire synthesis regarding the value of NPIs as a measure of control
of the current pandemic is captured by Figure 11. Once you define the concept of criticality, this synthesis follows by deduction.

Definition: Criticality is the allowable daily transmission rate, given the
current daily recovery rate and daily death rate such that some constraint is
almost, but not quite, violated.

For illustration, consider the constraint of keeping peak active cases below a threshold to prevent the country’s health care system from being overwhelmed. There exists a critical line in the control surface of Figure 11, for

a given γ + δ, that achieves this uniquely for that locale.
It is a very general principle, that the critical line is raised as the susceptible
population is reduced in number. The full non-linear model in eq. (C.1)
demonstrates this, as fewer and fewer people are susceptible the lower the
need for NPIs to remain sub-critical.
If the desire is to relax NPIs below the current critical NPI level, pC ;
the only other degree of freedom left is the intervention leverage αs which
will need to be closely monitored. Outlier locales in Tables 2 and 3 have
demonstrated that this is possible.
5.4. Monitoring intervention leverage is important
It is paramount to closely monitor the evolution of intervention leverage
αs as NPIs are released. If the clinical situation does not change, γ and δ
will remain small. The allowable transmission rates will also have to remain
small as well and therefore strict measures of NPIs will need to remain in
place.
It is essential to increase αs if the desire is to relax NPIs beyond the current
critical NPI level, pc in Figure 11. By increasing αs , the critical NPI level
is ’left shifted’ and allows for an even greater relaxation of NPIs than would
otherwise be possible. For the system to remain sub-critical, the rate with
which αs increases should outpace that of the decrease of the stringency index
if a total relaxation of NPIs is desired. Monitoring of αs becomes essential

5.5. Easier compliance with softer NPIs
One is tempted to speculate about the possibility of non-linear behavior
in Eq. 2, where data would favor αs to increase as p decreases i.e. it would
be easier for citizens to comply with less stringent NPIs. This would be good
news in terms of the effort required to manage the pandemic in that the

effectiveness of containment measures could increase as p decreases. This
argument is hindered by the fact that the lapse of time between changes in
the observed non-pharmaceutical interventions was not significant and measuring the effect of each individual intervention was therefore difficult. As a
result of swift action by Governments, we observe the effect of an ensemble of
more or less stringent measures, as opposed to their sequential application.
To this end, we lack the evidence that would support the above mentioned
non-linear behavior.

Figure 11: The constraints on the NPI control surface as it relates to the transmission rate.
The intervention leverage, αs affects how easy it is for a country to reduce transmission
rate for a given stringency index level. There is a linearly stable zone, meaning that the
observed daily transmission rate is less than the combined daily recovery γ and daily death
rate δ i.e. Rt < 1. By definition, the critical level of NPI pc may not be reduced further
or there will be a guarantee of overwhelming the healthcare system. Note that the critical
line moves upward as the size of the susceptible population decreases.

5.6. Insights from Outliers
It is appropriate to comment on some of the outliers identified in the
estimation of intervention leverage αs . Table 4 summarises this discussion;
density of people plays a key role in intervention leverage and a correlation
study with World Bank data substantiates this claim further (See Appendix
D for further details). It need not be ignored that the prolonged spread of the
virus during the early stages of the pandemic in Italy and Spain were driven
by lack homogeneity in the adherence to advisories. This prompted governments to introduce severe restrictions to movement, where law enforcement
agencies became heavily involved in ensuring compliance. The importance
of public awareness and compliance with regards to NPIs to slow the spread
is hence embodied by the intervention leverage αs and is an important observable during the post-lockdown stage.
5.7. Recommendations
A world wide survey paper is intended to follow our results where the key
parameters of our latent SIRD model are correlated with macro-economic,
public health and geo-physical measurements to determine the environmental
effects on the transmission, recovery and mortality parameters of COVID19.
While lockdown measures have been successful in curbing the spread, our
study indicates that removing them too swiftly will result in the resurgence
of the spread within one to two months. Reducing the stringency index by 10
will delay reaching the apex by about 6 months, where reducing it by 20 will
delay by only four. The peak cases almost double by moving from ∆p = −10
to ∆p = −20. This indicates that post-lockdown measures should be staged
and the reduction of the stringency index should be slow.

Although some of the above US interventions were not directly comparable to the OxCGRT indicators, their individual impact on the stringency
index is still valid and should be included in the index. By including U 1 and
U 3 with the appropriate weight into the same calculation OxCGRT used for

Due to lack of data on the Travel Severely Limited intervention in the
IHME database. It was necessary to source US travel restrictions information
from other US news sources. There have been a number of travel interventions that have been implemented however there have not been widespread
travel bans between states. 32 The first significant travel restriction was a
US-Europe travel ban to 26 European countries, which was announced on
11 March 2020. 33 On 19 March 2020 the US issued a level 4 ”Do not travel”
advisory which is the highest travel restriction in the US. US citizens were
informed that they can travel back to the US if they were out of the country
when the ban was announced but if they do not do so timely they might find
themselves having to stay abroad for an extended period of time. Foreign
nationals who have been to the 26 EU countries or the UK, China, Iran or
Ireland are not allowed entrance to the US. 34 In terms of the interstate travel

restrictions. There have been no full travel bans but in some states you are
required to quarantine for 14 days after arrival. 32 Therefore, it was necessary
to introduce a leveled implementation of the U4 Travel Severely Restricted
measure. Using the same logic used by the Oxford COVID-19 Government
Response Tracker (OxCGRT) the following equation for vi was introduced:

(A.5)
Ni
where Ui is ordinal and can vary from 0 to the cardinality of the intervention measure, Ni . This is for the purpose of incorporating levels of implementation of specific interventions into the stringency calculation. Based on
the data the only intervention that requires levels of implementation is the
U4 intervention.

Observed infections, I : These infections represent patients who have
tested positive for COVID-19 and are actively reported on 10 . Any contacts of
these patients who subsequently test positive, any nosocomial infections due
to these patients (for example, healthcare workers who contract the disease)
or any other individuals who knowingly interact with COVID-19 positive
patients are modeled by β, the transmission rate of COVID-19 amongst observed infections. Well prepared countries with strict healthcare protocols for
known positive patients, for example quarantining, effective use of personal
protective equipment for healthcare providers, and physically separate care
pathways for positive patients all essentially work to ensure that β is kept as
small as possible.
Asymtpomatic also transmissable Some of these observed infections, I are
due to some mild or asymptomatic cases which become severe enough to
warrant testing or cause patients to seek medical attention. These cases are
modeled by φIL , where φ is dependent on the probability that a latent infection IL becomes a known positive case, I. Latent infections are addressed
next.

Latent infections, IL : There is evidence of a non-trivial fraction of
cases going undetected as a result of presenting with mild symptoms or being asymptomatic 35,36 . This is the reason for including the latent variable
dynamics within our modification of the standard SIRD model.
Table 1 in the main text has good estimates of asymptomatic cases; together
with the patients who have subclinical manifestations of Covid-19, these cases
are all included in the latent infection group, IL .
It is the susceptible group’s interaction with these asymptomatic and mild
cases which produce new latent infections and this is modeled through βL ,
the non-negligible latent transmission rate.

Latent recoveries, RL : A majority of these asymptomatic and mild

group, RL . The rate of recovery of the latent infected group is captured by γL .

servable and rare. The weak observability is present with the revised, erratic
death counts by some officials when home visits uncover additional cases 10 .
It is unclear that these may be directly attributable to the virus in that confirmation would be required via post-mortem COVID-19 testing ? . Given
the existing testing burden posed on most countries, this sort of testing is
rare and, therefore, the uncertainty in this parameter will remain high 18 .

Known recoveries, R : These are patients who are known to test positive for COVID-19 and are known to have recovered fully from the virus.
The recovery rate, γ, models how quickly known infections are resolved and
discharged out of the healthcare system. This rate is physically dependent
on treatment regime and the patient’s own physical condition.

Deceased patients, D : The number of deceased individuals is denoted
by D; and it is mostly affected by the known individuals who have tested
positive and are currently being treated in the prevailing healthcare system.
The implications for the model are that δ  δL i.e. under normal treatment
and monitoring situations, the implied probability of fatality for a known
infection is much larger than the implied probability of fatality for a latent
infection.
Under the above conditions, the model explicitly caters explicitly for the
situation that the latent infections are asymptomatic or mild.
It is trivial to show that S + I + IL + RL + R + D = N at every instant
in time. Furthermore, the model in Figure 1 implies that:

Appendix B.1. Linearisation
Each of the equations in (B.1) - (B.5) were linearised using the approximation that S = N − , which gives equivalent results to the Jacobian
method 27 . This operating point corresponds to the case where the epidemic
is still in the early/controllable phase and the number of infected individuals
is small compared with the size of the total population N .
The derivatives with respect to time were approximated using first order
backward difference approximations at a daily level. Classical frequentist error propagation was applied to this linear approximation using the Gaussian
process assumption.
Theoretically, these approximations are valid provided that:
1. the number of infected are a small fraction of the susceptible population.

527
528
529

2. the dynamics of the disease process are slow compared with a single
day. This is justified by the work from Weiss and Murdoch 36 .

530

531
532

The final form, used for analysis of the time variation of the parameters
as various forms of control are applied is:
γ(t) =

∆R
± σγ (t),
I[t − 1]

(B.6)

δ(t) =

where σx (t) is the noise estimate at day t, ∆x := x[t] − x[t − 1] and x is
either R, D or I.
Appendix B.2. Error propagation
Using the coefficient of variation and propagating the error in the linear
approximation, assuming that the errors in the daily counts are within 10% 37 ,
the probable noise levels in the daily time variations are calculated by:

These results depend on the count data being Poisson processes and the fact
that the coefficient of variation of a Poisson process is λ−1/2 . Recall that the
general coefficient of variation of a division of two random variables is the
quadrature sum of the numerator and denominator coefficients of variation;
the results follow 37 .
Appendix B.3. Details of Linearisation
If dt is taken as one day, t is the day index and ∆x = x[t] − x[t − 1], then
with the modeling assumptions the differential equations simplify to:
∆S = −βL IL [t − 1],

(B.12)

∆IL = (βL − γL − φ) IL [t − 1],

(B.13)

∆I = φ IL [t − 1] − γ I[t − 1] − δ I[t − 1],

(B.14)

∆R = γ I[t − 1],

(B.15)

∆D = δ I[t − 1].

(B.16)

Use of (B.15) and (B.16) yield the daily estimates of the observable recovery
rate, γ and fatality rate δ. Combining (B.15), (B.16) and (B.14) give the
daily estimate of the transmission rate, as observed through the detection
efficiency.

Appendix C. Control Dynamics
Efforts to control the pandemic do not happen everywhere, all at once and
this is the reason that the control efforts can be said to be dynamic. Indeed,
the form of the kernel functions in equations (1) - (4) state this implicitly.
Each of the observed parameters will be looked at it in this section and their
dynamics described. These forms have non-trivial implications for control of
the pandemic and will be expounded upon in a follow up paper.
Transmission rate
The beta kernel in (1) and the steady state behaviour modeled by (2) imply
that the transmission dynamics, under stringency of control p, behave as a
first order control system 27 :

dβ
= β0 − β(t) − β0 αs p,

(C.1)

where br is the typical adjustment time for a control measure to take full
effect, αs is the societal sensitivity (estimated for each country in our work)
to control measures p ∈ [0, 100], and β0 is the uncontrolled transmission rate
within a society.
As a sense check; when p = 0 then the equilibrium condition of (C.1) is found
by solving (C.1) with β(t) = βf = const. The non-trivial solution is βf = β0
and shows that, without control, the transmission rate becomes β0 . This is
defined as the uncontrolled transmission rate and is as it should be.
If p 6= 0, then the equilibrium condition is βf = β0 − β0 αs p which is exactly
equation (2). The general analytic solution to (C.1) is precisely the kernel
function in (1).

It is this form which allows for the use of classic and modern control
methods to shape β(t) to a form that is acceptable for the desired goals of
the pandemic control system eg. minimise total deaths, minimise the peak
load on the health care system, maximise the economic activity etc. These
aspects will be dealt with in detail in a follow up paper.

,
1 + e−ξI (t−C)

(D.1)

where Itot denotes the total expected number of positive cases for t → ∞,
ξI is the slope of the exponential growth that characterises the first phase
of the spread, and C can be interpreted as a measure of the time needed to
deviate from the initial exponential growth leading to containment. Time is
expressed in number of days. A total number of 67 countries are selected,
where containment measures have proven effective in curbing the spread.
These include countries in all continents and with a wide span in terms of
socio-economic development, inequality and population density.
Macroscopic indicators are organised according to relevant themes: socioeconomic vulnerabilities, demographics, social expenditures and aggregate
economic indicators. A total of 34 indicators from the World Bank data base
are selected and are correlated with the parameter ξI from each country.
The Gini index quantifies the extent to which the distribution of income
among individuals or households deviates from perfect equality. The selected
sample of countries displays a minimum and a maximum Gini index of 24 and
50, respectively. It is found that the parameter ξI is almost insensitive to the
Gini index. This is illustrated in Figure D.12 where the red line corresponds
to a first order polynomial that is consistent with zero slope. In order to
exclude statistical fluctuations in the sample a similar study is performed
using the percentage share of income held by the lowest 10% and 20% of the
income bracket. No significant correlation is found for either of the indexes.
This indicates that social inequality is not strongly correlated with the rate
of spread of the virus.
This observation is further strengthened by evaluating the correlation
with the proportion of the urban population living in slum households. According to the World Bank, a slum household is defined as a group of individuals living under the same roof lacking one or more of the following
conditions: access to improved water, access to improved sanitation, sufficient living area, and durability of housing. Out of the 67 countries under
scrutiny, 18 report a significant fraction of urban population living in slums.
In this sample of countries the fraction ranges from 8% to 53%. No signifi30

cant correlation is found between this index and ξI . In addition, the average
value of ξI for these 18 countries is compatible with that of the rest of the
ensemble studied.
As per the physical picture underlying the model used to describe the
spread, it is expected that population density should play a significant role.
No significant correlation is found with the average population density. This
can be explained by the fact that the average population density is not necessarily a good metric for population density in urban areas, where the spread
is most likely to occur. It should be noted that the correlation with the fraction of the population in urban areas is not statistically significant. In order
to scrutinise the relevance of localised population density, the index made
of the population in urban agglomerations of more than one million to the
country’s population living in metropolitan areas in percentiles is used, as illustrated in Figure D.12. It is found that the correlation can be parametrised
with a first order polynomial with a slope of (1 ± 0.3) · 10−3 per day. The
significance of the correlation greater than a 3 σ Confidence Level. This the
most significant correlation out of all the indexes considered here.

It will be argued that one of the strategies for the post-lockdown period
is to increase intervention leverage αs as p decreases. This will sustain quasilinear behavior in the number of active cases and it is depicted in Figures 9

and 10 for ∆p = −10.
In practice, all relevant parameters that enter the temporal evolution described above need to be tuned such that the expected peak of the number of
cases and ICU usage falls below the thresholds characteristic to each country. One can denote a vector of critical parameters for which a country’s
healthcare system is not overwhelmed:
~vc (t) = (γc , dc , βc , αsc ).

646
647
648
649
650

(E.1)

This is what is meant by criticality; the value of parameters such that the
healthcare system is only marginally not overwhelmed. One can assume that
γc and δc display a weak time dependence in that they primarily depend on
medical advances, rather than on NPIs. In this setup the condition for the
system to remain sub-critical can be expressed as follows:
∂αs
∂t

≥−

∂p
,
∂t c

(E.2)

664

where the temporal partial derivatives are evaluated at the point of criticality
defined by ~vc (t). The inequality (E.2), while seemingly straightforward from
a mathematical standpoint, has serious consequences for policy makers.
While lockdown measures have been successful in bringing the reproductive
factor down to one and below, it is evident that these are having devastating
effects on the economic landscape. In African countries, lockdown measures
necessary to control the epidemic are leading to widespread malnutrition in
vast sections of the population.
On the other hand, the illustrative example shown in Section 5.1, indicates
that for fixed intervention leverage αs , reducing p significantly can lead to
the advent of an epidemic of unprecedented proportions. Under these conditions, the inequality (E.2) speaks to the need to ensure that the rate with
which intervention leverage αs grows should outpace that of easing nonpharmaceutical interventions.
