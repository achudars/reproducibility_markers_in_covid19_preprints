The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute

17

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, December

18

2019, and continuously poses a serious threat to public health. Our previous study has

19

shown that cytokine storm occurred during SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the detailed

20

role of cytokines in the disease severity and progression remained unclear due to the

21

limited case number. In this study, we examined 48 cytokines in the plasma samples

22

from 53 COVID-19 cases, among whom 34 were severe cases, and the others

moderate. Results showed that 14 cytokines were significantly elevated upon

24

admission in COVID-19 cases. Moreover, IP-10, MCP-3, and IL-1ra were

25

significantly higher in severe cases, and highly associated with the PaO2/FaO2 and

26

Murray score. Furthermore, the three cytokines were independent predictors for the

27

progression of COVID-19, and the combination of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra showed

28

the biggest area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC)

29

calculations. Serial detection of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra in 14 severe cases showed

30

that the continuous high levels of these cytokines were associated with disease

31

deterioration and fatal outcome. In conclusion, we report biomarkers that closely

32

associated with disease severity and outcome of COVID-19. These findings add to

33

our understanding of the immunopathologic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection,

34

providing novel therapeutic targets and strategy.

Furthermore, another 53 countries have also reported COVID-19 cases, posing a

serious threat of public health 6. Studies have revealed that penumonia is the most

48

common complications following SARS-CoV-2 infection, and followed by acute

line of defense against tissue damage caused by either injury or infection, involving

moderate cases defined according to China National Health Commission Guidelines

62

for Diagnosis and Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and analyzed the plasma

63

cytokine/chemokine profile in detail. Most of the severe cases (73.5%) were ≥ 60

64

years-old, while the moderate cases were mainly in the group of 16-59 years-old

65

(63.2%) (Table S1). The initial symptoms, co-existing chronic medical conditions,

66

intervals of illness onset to admission and antiviral treatment were similar between

67

the two groups. Complications occurred more frequently in the severe cases,

68

including ARDS, respiratory failure, hepatic and renal insufficiency (Table S1). A

69

complete blood count with differential was assessed for each patient either on the date

70

of hospital admission, or at the earliest time-point and thereafter (Table 1). The

71

percentage of lymphocyte (LYM) and neutrophil (NEU) as well as the CD4 and CD8

72

counts were significantly lower in the severe cases, indicating a possible dysfunction

73

of immune responses.

74

Then the expression profile of cytokines/chemokines of COVID-19 cases upon

75

admission was analyzed. Elevated concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory

76

cytokines were observed in these cases including IFN-γ (interferon, IFN), IL-1ra

77

(interleukin, IL), IL-2ra, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, HGF (hepatocyte growth factor), MCP-3

86

we compared the plasma cytokine/chemokine levels collected from severe and

87

moderate cases at different days after illness onset (d.a.o). The results showed that

88

most of the cytokines were comparable between the two groups and maintained high

89

level even at the later stage of the disease (≥ 15 d.a.o). However, IP-10, MCP-3,

90

IL-1ra and MIG were significantly higher in samples from severe cases in all the three

91

groups of sample collection time, even though statistical significance was not

92

observed in IL-1ra and MIG. Notably, IP-10 in the severe cases possessed a high and

93

similar expression level at all groups of sample collection time. On the contrary, IP-10

94

in moderate cases was significantly lower and further decreased a lot at ≥ 15 d.a.o.

95

Moreover, comparison of these fourteen cytokines between the severe and moderate

96

cases showed significantly higher levels of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra in the severe

97

cases (Figure 1). Spearman rank coefficient correlation analysis showed that IP-10,

98

MCP-3 and IL-1ra expression levels were highly correlated with PaO2/FaO2 and

99

Murray scores. Interestingly, the viral load (displayed as Ct values) showed obvious

100

correlation with only IP-10, while not MCP-3 and IL-1ra, as well as the PaO2/FaO2

101

and Murray scores (Figure S2). Our previous study has found that the viral shedding

102

in COVID-19 cases is complicated and the viral loads obtained from the regularly

103

used upper respiratory specimens might not consistent with the real case, especially

104

for the severe cases 27. Meanwhile, the main distribution of viruses in the severe and

105

moderate cases were also different, which might influence the induction of cytokines

106

as well. Indeed, studies have found that high viral loads in some types of viral

107

infections correlated with severe diseases

111

disease severity and progression of COVID-19. Firstly, we calculated the receiver

112

operating characteristic (ROC) of each single cytokine using the expression levels

113

upon admission. Results showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC was

114

0.915, 0.765 and 0.792 for IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra, respectively (Figure 3). Then

115

we tested the different combination of these cytokines for the prediction of disease

116

progression. Combinations of the three cytokines showed the highest AUC of 0.943,

117

followed by the combination of IP-10 and MCP-3 (0.927) as well as the combination

118

of IP-10 and IL-1ra (0.923) (Figure 3). Furthermore, we analyzed the serial change of

119

the three cytokines in 14 severe cases. In the two fatal cases (cases 1 and 2), the

120

expression levels were significantly high upon admission and maintained high levels

121

during the disease progression. Meanwhile, five cases (cases 7~9, 11 and 13) with

122

continuously high levels of these cytokines, especially IP-10 and MCP-3, were still in

153

METHODS

154

Patient information and data collection

155

Subjects presented in this study were hospitalized COVID-19 patients (N=53), among

156

whom 34 were defined as severe cases according to China National Health

157

Commission Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of 2019-nCoV infection.

158

Healthy controls (N=8) were also included. Clinical information and laboratory result

159

were collected at the earliest time-point after hospitalization. The study protocol was

160

approved by the Ethics Committees of Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital

161

(SZTHEC2016001). Informed consents were obtained from all patients or patients

162

family members. The study was conducted in accordance with the International

163

Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the

164

Declaration of Helsinki and institutional ethics guidelines.

165

Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)

166

qRT-PCR were done as previously reported

167

sputum and BALF specimens were collected from laboratory-confirmed COVID-19

168

cases upon admission and thereafter. Viral RNAs were extracted from clinical

169

specimens using the QIAamp RNA Viral Kit (Qiagen, Heiden, Germany). A China

170

Food and Drug Administration (CDFA) approved commercially kit (GeneoDX Co.,

171

Shanghai, China) were used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific RNAs.

172

Samples with a cycle threshold (Ct) value ≤ 37.0 were considered putatively positive.

173

Samples whose Ct was higher than 37 were re-tested and considered positive if Ct

174

was ≥37 but ≤ 40 and negative if viral RNAs were undetectable on the second test.

175

Disease severity classification

26,34

. In brief, throat swabs, nasal swabs,

176

Disease severity classification and Murray Score calculation were evaluated as

177

previously reported

178

China National Health Commission Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of

179

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Laboratory confirmed patients with fever, respiratory

180

manifestations and radiological findings indicative of pneumonia were considered

181

moderate cases (COVID-19-M). Laboratory confirmed patients who met any of the

182

following were considered to have severe COVID-19 (COVID-19-S): 1) respiratory

183

distraction (respiration rate≥30/min; 2) resting oxygen saturation≤93%, or 3) arterial

184

oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) / fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ≤300 mmHg (1

185

mmHg = 0.133 kPa). Laboratory confirmed patients who had any of the following

186

were considered in critical condition: 1) respiratory failure requiring mechanical

187

ventilation, 2) shock, or 3) failure of other organs requiring intensive care unit (ICU).

188

Quantification of hypoxia and Murray Score

189

The partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) in arterial blood taken from the patients at

190

various time-points after hospitalization is measured by the ABL90 blood gas

191

analyzer (Radiometer). The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is calculated by the

192

following formula: FiO2 = (21 + oxygen flow (in units of l/min) × 4) /100. The

193

PaO2/FiO2 ratio (in units of mmHg) is calculated by dividing the PaO2 value with the

194

FiO2 value. A PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than or equal to 100 mmHg is considered one of

195

the criteria for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Murray Score

196

were calculated as reported 39.

197

Cytokine and chemokine measurements

198

The plasma of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases (N=53) were

199

collected at the earliest possible time-point after hospitalization and thereafter. The

200

plasma of healthy subjects (N=8) were included as the negative control group. The

201

concentrations of 48 cytokines and chemokines were measured using Bio-Plex Pro

202

Human Cytokine Screening Panel (Bio-Rad) as previously reported 15,26.

203

Statistical analysis

204

Fisher exact test was used to compare the indicated rates between the moderate and

205

severe cases. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare plasma cytokine levels

206

between two groups. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used for linear

207

correlation analysis between the expression level of plasma cytokine and PaO2/FiO2

208

ratio, Murray score as well as viral loads of COVID-19 cases. The area under the

209

receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of plasma cytokine levels was

210

estimated for the moderate and severe cases. All statistical tests were calculated using

211

SPSS 20.0 for Windows (IBM, Chicago, USA). P value less than 0.05 was considered

212

statistically significant.

Figure 1. Comparison of serum cytokine/chemokine concentrations between

342

healthy volunteers and COVID-19 cases. Samples from severe (N=34) and

343

moderate (N=19) COVID-19 cases were collected at the earliest possible time-point

344

after hospitalization for assays measuring the concentrations of 48 cytokines and

345

chemokines, and healthy subjects (N=8) were involved as control. Values were

346

graphed on a logarithmic scale and presented in units of pg/mL. P values between

347

0.01-0.05, 0.001-0.01 and 0.0001-0.001 were considered statistically significant (*),

348

very significant (**) and extremely significant (***), respectively, whereas ns

349

represents not significant.

Figure 2. IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra expression levels were highly correlated with

352

PaO2/FiO2 and Murray Score. The expression levels of IP-10, MCP-3 and IL-1ra

353

measured from plasma samples collected upon admission and thereafter and the

354

corresponding PaO2/FiO2 and Murray Score at the same day were analyzed using

355

spearman rank correlation analysis. The r values and p values were shown.

Figure 3. The ROC curve of plasma cytokine levels for patients with mild and

358

severe SARS-CoV-2-infections. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve

359

was calculated using SPSS. The area under the curve (AUC) of ROC for IP-10,

360

MCP-3 and IL-1ra wad estimated using the expression levels upon admission. The P

361

values of all AUC for the three cytokines were less than 0.05.
