Abstract

Background

Reports of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) have emerged during the Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19) pandemic. This epidemiological and cohort study sought to investigate any
causative association between COVID-19 infection and GBS.

Methods

The epidemiology of GBS cases reported via the UK National Immunoglobulin Database were
studied from 2016-2019 and compared to cases reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. For
the cohort study, members of the British Peripheral Nerve Society reported all cases of GBS
during the pandemic. The clinical features, investigation findings and outcomes of COVID-19
(definite or probable) and non-COVID-19 associated GBS cases were compared.

Results

The UK GBS incidence from 2016-2019 was 1.65-1.88 per 100,000 people per year. GBS and
COVID-19 incidence varied between regions and did not correlate (r = 0.06, 95% CI -0.56 to
0.63, p=0.86). GBS incidence fell between March and May 2020 compared to the same months of
2016-2019. Forty-seven GBS cases were included in the cohort study (13 definite, 12 probable
COVID-19 and 22 non-COVID-19). There were no significant differences in the pattern of
weakness, time to nadir, neurophysiology, CSF findings or outcome. Intubation was more
frequent in the COVID-19+ve cohort (7/13, 54% vs 5/22, 23% in COVID negative) thought to be
related directly to COVID-19 pulmonary involvement.

Conclusions

This study finds no epidemiological or phenotypic clues of SARS-CoV-2 being causative of GBS.
GBS incidence has fallen during the pandemic which may be the influence of lockdown
measures reducing transmission of GBS inducing pathogens such as Campylobacter jejuni and
respiratory viruses.

Introduction

The first cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were reported
to the World Health Organisation in late 2019, and by March 2020 COVID-19 was pandemic.1
SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were associated
with neurological sequelae. 2 Early reports identified neurological symptoms of COVID-19
infection as headache, anosmia and dysgeusia.3 Subsequently COVID-19 infection has been
associated with stroke, meningoencephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).4–6 The first reported case series of five patients with GBS
following SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported in April 2020.7 We have identified 18 further
reports of GBS associated with COVID-19 (see supplementary material).

GBS is an acute, post-infectious immune mediated polyradiculoneuropathy typically arising a
few days to 6 weeks after bacterial or viral infections including influenza, Campylobacter jejuni,
Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and

more recently, Zika virus.8–10 The pathological initiating event of GBS is a humoral response,
where antibodies to surface epitopes of the invading pathogen cross-react with peripheral
nerve glycolipids as a result of molecular mimicry, resulting in complement fixation,
macrophage attraction and resultant peripheral axon or myelin nerve damage. 11 This
mechanism is definitively established for C. jejuni associated GBS,12,13 and with less certainty for
other pathogens. SARS CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA enveloped virus. Open reading frames
(ORF) encode for replicase proteins and the structural proteins which are the spike (S),
nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins. 14 To date we know of no homology
between SARS-CoV-2 surface epitopes and peripheral nerve tissue. Reports of diverse antiganglioside antibodies suggest a uniform immune mediated hypothesis is unsupported. More
comprehensive epidemiological characterisation is crucial to understanding any causal link.

With over 13 million cases of COVID-19 infection worldwide by 19th July,15 the question of
whether COVID-19 infection is a cause of GBS or a coincidental finding remains to be answered.
We performed a UK population-based epidemiological study to investigate any causal
relationship between COVID-19 infection and GBS. We furthermore characterised a cohort of UK
cases of COVID-19 associated GBS to explore any difference from non-COVID-19 GBS. Finally, we
explored any homology between SARS-CoV-2 and the human genome and proteome which
would support the molecular mimicry mechanism.

Methods

Epidemiological case reporting
Cases of GBS were ascertained from the National Immunoglobulin Database from the 1st January
to the 31st May 2020. NHS England (NHSE) procures the total intravenous immunoglobulin
(IVIg) supply for England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. NHSE mandates every IVIg
prescription is approved by a clinical panel and reported onto the database within 90 days.
Recording compliance is almost 100% as hospital trusts are only reimbursed once records of
dispensed volumes are submitted; these are retrospectively cross-checked against supply and
returned stocks. 17 Current UK guidance for GBS treatment indicates IVIg and plasma exchange
(PLEX) as first line therapy, 18 but IVIg is in practice first line in most UK hospitals due to lack of
PLEX resources. The International GBS Outcome Study (IGOS) reported 1000 GBS cases, within
which 86% (612/715) of European cases were treated with IVIg, 6% PLEX and 7% received no
treatment.19 In reported COVID-19 GBS cases (supplementary material), 97% (34/36) received
IVIg. To ensure complete reporting at the inception date, NHSE specifically mandated all users
of the National Immunoglobulin database by email to log any outstanding GBS cases by 30th June
2020. Data retrieval was performed on the 7th July 2020 to allow time for reporting delay.

We searched the NHSE IVIg database for GBS cases from 2016 to 2019 to determine the
incidence of non-COVID-19 reported cases of GBS to compare to the 2020 pandemic data. Data
were stratified by hospital trust and region. UK population data for COVID-19 infection were
collated from Public Health England, Health Protection Scotland and the Public Health Agency of
Northern Ireland.

Cohort study
In parallel, we conducted a cohort study to compare the phenotype of COVID-19 associated GBS
(definite and probable) to COVID-19 negative GBS reported during the same study period.
Reports of GBS were submitted by members of the British Peripheral Nerve Society, who cover
81 different UK sites. Members were emailed on a weekly basis to collect information on
hospital presentations of GBS from the 1st March to the 31st May, 2020. Reporting was
restricted to BPNS members to achieve a comprehensively characterised representative sample
of incident cases diagnosed by peripheral nerve experts. Data were entered to the International
Neuromuscular COVID-19 database (www.ucl.ac.uk/centre-for-neuromusculardiseases/news/2020/may/international-neuromuscular-covid-19-database), at the Centre for
Neuromuscular Disease. Cohort study data collection ended on July 1st 2020 to allow time for
retrospective case reporting. Anonymised clinical data of demographics and medical history,
COVID-19 infection, symptoms and management were collected. Precipitating illness, clinical
features of GBS, investigation findings including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and
electrophysiology, management and outcomes were also collated.
To cross validate data collected from the cohort study, the phenotypic characteristics were
compared against the published International GBS Outcome Study cases to see whether
pandemic presentations differed from non-pandemic phenotypes.19

Evidence of COVID-19
GBS cases were stratified into three groups; definite COVID-19, probable COVID-19 and nonCOVID-19. Definite cases had either a positive nasal or throat swab PCR for viral RNA or a
subsequent positive serological test for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG irrespective of clinical signs
and symptoms. Probable cases were defined by the presence of clinical symptoms consistent
with COVID-19 infection as per the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control case
definitions, 20 or pulmonary imaging (CXR or CT) highly suggestive of COVID-19 (airway
opacification typically bilateral, peripheral and basal in distribution) where PCR analysis was
negative. An association of COVID-19 with GBS was defined by an onset of GBS within 8 weeks
of acute infection (clinically or on confirmed laboratory findings).

Search for homology between SARS CoV-2 and human genome and proteome
We searched for evidence of molecular mimicry between SARS CoV2 proteins and human nerve
axonal or myelin proteins and glycoproteins. We searched for human homologs of proteins
encoded by the SARS CoV-2 genome using the National Centre for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI’s) Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) to identify common amino acid sequences
in the human Reference Sequence Database (refseq_protein). The NCBI BLAST was also used to
query the SARS CoV-2 genome against the human genome for any significant alignments at
specific genomic loci.
The expect value (E-value) quantifies the number of times a specific alignment can be ‘expected’
to occur in a database by chance. As the E-value decreases the significance of the alignment in
the specified database increases. Any alignment with an E-value of < 1x10-4 was considered
homologous to a human protein (error rate < 0.01%).

Statistical analysis
The incidence rates of GBS and COVID-19 (95% confidence intervals by Byar’s approximation
method22) were calculated by dividing regional cases and time period by the relevant mid-year
population estimate. Mid-year population estimates at both regional and national level were
obtained from the UK Office for National Statistics. 21 We explored any association between the
incidence of GBS and the incidence of COVID-19 in UK regions in 2020 (January to May) using
Pearson’s correlation coefficient. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine suitability of
parametric tests. COVID-19 definite and probable cases were compared against non-COVID-19
associated GBS for statistical analysis. Secondary analysis was performed to compare data from
the entire cohort against the IGOS study cohort to determine whether characteristics differed
between pandemic and non-pandemic GBS phenotypes. We used one Mann-Whitney U to test
non-parametric continuous data, and the χ2 or Fisher’s exact test to compare proportions. R
(4.0.0) and GraphPad prism (8.1.2) were used for analysis and figures.

Ethics
The UK Health Research Authority was consulted and advised the study did not require review
by an NHS Research Ethics Committee as an analysis of previously collected non-identifiable
information. The project was submitted as a “Service Evaluation” to the Clinical Audit and
Quality Improvement Subcommittee (CAQISC).

Results

Epidemiological study
The NHSE IVIg Database reported a mean of 1098 (range 1021-1155) GBS cases per year
between 2016-2019 (monthly range 83 to 170 cases). Annual UK GBS incidence was 1.65-1.88
per 100,000 people each year across this period, consistent with the incidence of GBS in Europe
and North America from a meta-analysis of 1,643 GBS cases (range 0.81 to 1.89 cases per
100,000). 23 These figures along with the mandatory reporting supports the database as a
complete and accurate resource for epidemiological analysis.

Although COVID-19 was first reported in the UK on January 31st 2020, significant numbers of
daily new infections (>1000 per day) did not occur until March, with the highest recorded daily
count of 6,201 confirmed cases on 1st May. 24 Through April and May there were 4000-6000
COVID-19 cases per day. As a result, COVID-19 GBS cases were expected to rise in subsequent
weeks if a strong association existed (see Figure 1). However, even accounting for the consistent
summer dip in GBS cases, GBS cases in March (93), April (70) and May (56) were significantly
fewer than previous years (mean 132 (March), 116 (April) and 113 (May) from 2016 to 2019)
(Figure 2). GBS and COVID-19 incidences varied across the UK with no correlation at a regional
level (r= 0.060 95% CI -0.56 to 0.63, P=0.86) (See Figure 3 and supplementary table 2).

Cohort study
Forty-seven cases of GBS were reported to the cohort. Of these,13 had definite COVID-19
infection, 12 were probable, and 22 had GBS with no evidence of COVID-19. Median age was 57
years (IQR 19-88), 33 were men (70%) and 29 (66%) were Caucasian. The male:female ratio in
the COVID-19 patients was 5.5 compared to 1.4 in the non-COVID and IGOS study. Men are more

likely to be significantly unwell and hospitalised with COVID-19 infection which may partially or
completely explain this difference.25,26

The clinical characteristics of the patients with GBS are shown in Table 1. Of the patients with
COVID-19 infection, the median time between onset of infective symptoms and neurological
weakness was 12 days for definite and 5 for probable cases; however the range of time intervals
was very broad, ranging from 0 to 37 days in definite and -14 to 52 days in probable cases.
Three probable cases developed symptoms of GBS without any clear COVID-19 symptoms, and
had incidental imaging evidence of COVID-19 suggesting recent mild or asymptomatic infection.
Numbers of non-COVID-19 GBS cases with symptoms of a precipitating illnesses, particularly
gastroenteritis, were significantly fewer than that compared to the IGOS cohort (1/22, 5% in
non-COVID-19 cases compared to 229/857, 27% in the IGOS cohort, p=0.014) This may be an
effect of lock down with improved hand hygiene reducing numbers of faecal-oral pathogen
transmissions. The pattern of weakness and time to nadir were no different between COVID-19
associated GBS and non-COVID-19 GBS. Cranial nerve involvement was the only finding more
frequent in the IGOS study compared to this cohort, possibly due to differences in data
acquisition of the two reporting systems. Although not statistically significant,
electrophysiological determination revealed a higher proportion of axonal GBS in the nonCOVID-19 patients (four Acute Motor and Sensory Axonal Neuropathy (AMSAN) and one Acute
Motor Axonal Neuropathy (AMAN), 23%), compared to one with AMSAN from the COVID-19
positive group.
The use of ventilation did not differ significantly between COVID-19 (definite and probable)
cases vs non-COVID-19 GBS. However, the proportion of COVID-19 definite GBS cases ventilated
was higher than all other groups (7/13, 54%). Despite this, the GBS disability score at four
weeks was no different between groups, suggesting the requirement for initial ventilation was

secondary to active COVID-19 pulmonary involvement in PCR positive definite cases rather than
neuromuscular weakness.
There were no differences in the treatment of GBS subgroups. IVIg was the first therapy in 83%
cases, and only one patient received plasma exchange as second line therapy. One patient
received more than one course of IVIg. One patient (COVID-19 definite) died in the cohort.
Death was attributed to pulmonary complications rather than neuromuscular weakness.

Comparison between SARS-CoV-2 and human genome and proteome
When we examined the entire SARS CoV-2 genome (29903 bases, b; NC_045512.2) as well as
overlapping fragments of 1000b (+ 500b) and compared this to the human genome, we found
no significant similarity.
We also explored individual proteins encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome comparing these
against all referenced human proteins. Only the replicase ORF1ab/ORF1a polyprotein (7096
amino acids) produced a match with the human mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase (PARP14)
protein. PARP14 belongs to an enzyme superfamily involved in histone modification during
DNA damage and is ubiquitously expressed making it unlikely as a mimotope. These two
proteins are 32% identical (E-value 3x10-6) but have only 1 contiguous identical sequence of 5
or more amino acids (Val-Val-Val-Asn-Ala). The remaining SARS-CoV-2 proteins including the
spike/surface, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein have no significant
similarity with any referenced human protein.

Discussion

This epidemiological and cohort study does not support any causal link between COVID-19
infection and GBS.16 The population based data finds no plausible temporal relationship
between COVID-19 and GBS (figure 1), a reduction in cases of GBS in comparison to preceding
years (figure 2) and no correlation between COVID and GBS incidence at regional level (figure
3). In addition, there are no scientific data to support a molecular mimicry link of SARS-CoV-2 to
GBS at the nucleic acid or protein level, other than a presumptive analogy to other known
bacterial and viral GBS-causing pathogens. The lack of even a short, linear homology between
the SARS-CoV-2 structure proteins and any axonal or myelin surface proteins would indicate
that molecular mimicry with SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely to contribute to the pathogenesis of GBS.
The strong concordance between UK GBS incidence from the NHSE National Immunoglobulin
database and reported incidence rates from multinational population based epidemiological
studies as well as its mandated collection methods, supports this as an appropriate repository
for epidemiological analysis. From this we identified significantly fewer cases of GBS during the
COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous years. This could represent an under-ascertainment
of cases during lock down for a number of reasons including incomplete IVIg prescription
recording. However, UK Hospital Trusts are mandated to report all IVIG treatments to the
National Immunoglobulin Database within 90 days. Previous database analyses have shown
95% of cases are recorded within 30 days of GBS treatment, and in 98% within 90 days. We
collected data from 1st January to 31st May 2020 on July the 7th allowing sufficient time to
capture the majority of reported cases. A subsequent direct check of complete IVIG reporting,
specific requests for clinicians to document cases and a cross check between clinical reports and
IVIg prescribing data ensured we have as complete a dataset as possible.
Mildly symptomatic patients may have decided not to visit hospital for fear of contracting
COVID-19. This issue was recognised in Stroke and Emergency Medicine with declines in overall
admissions worldwide. 27–30. Unwell frail patients may have not been actively investigated or

treated, or not admitted into hospital. Physicians’ prescribing behaviour could also have
changed during the pandemic, being more selective in patients treated with IVIg. Even with the
above, the National Immunoglobulin Database only records GBS cases meeting criteria for
treatment and thus mild GBS phenotypes would not have been reported in 2016-2019, reducing
the likelihood of a disparity resulting from mild disease attendance bias. The indication for IVIg
treatment in GBS is for non-ambulant patients, and therefore it is unlikely such patients
remained at home or would not be admitted to hospital. The cohort study also demonstrated
83% of cases were treated with IVIG, providing cross validation of high treatment rates.
We hypothesise that the lockdown measures introduced to prevent COVID-19 transmission
have had secondary effects of reducing other common transmissible infective GBS triggers such
as upper respiratory tract infections by social distancing and mask wearing, and gastrointestinal
illnesses as fewer people dined out and stricter hand hygiene was implemented. Other studies
have reported significant reductions in airborne or faeco-oral transmissible infectious diseases
during lockdown supporting this assertion.31 Although the true impact of such measures are
unknown, avoidance of precipitating infections would conceivably reduce the incidence of GBS,
and may explain a reduction of GBS cases during the pandemic. Successful interventions to
lower Campylobacter contamination of fresh poultry meat previously reduced hospitalisations
for GBS by 13%. 32 And the numbers of reported infective symptoms preceding GBS, particularly
diarrhoea were significantly fewer compared to the IGOS study, consistent with this hypothesis.
True COVID-19 incidence in the UK is known to have been significantly under-reported. Initially
there was lack of available testing except in hospital admissions, and only PCR confirmed cases
were reported in the published data. UK serological studies of COVID-19 suggest far higher
COVID-19 infection rates in the community than PCR confirmed cases.. For example, by 27th
April 2020, there were 26,784 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in London. Serological data
from London blood donors on the same date reported the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2
infection as 17.5%, 33 equivalent to 1,571,850 people having made a serological response. Under

reporting of COVID-19 cases poses limitations to true estimates of incidence, resulting in a
potential over-reporting of a COVID-19 GBS association.
Whilst at an epidemiological level we found no increase in GBS linked to the COVID-19
epidemic, our data do not exclude the possibility that SARS-Cov-2 might be a driver of GBS in
very rare cases, or that a significant reduction in non-COVID-19 GBS could mask a smaller spike
of COVID GBS cases. Early series of COVID-19 associated GBS reported specific disease
characteristics suggesting differences from typical AIDP.7 This larger cohort revealed no
differences in the clinical and neurophysiological features, disease severity and outcomes of
COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 associated GBS. A larger proportion of COVID-19 PCR positive GBS
cases required mechanical intervention compared to all other groups. The similar rate of
neurological recovery across all groups suggests ventilation was related to COVID-19 associated
pulmonary involvement rather than neuromuscular deficit at nadir.
Guillain-Barré Syndrome is an acute immune mediated inflammatory polyneuropathy which can
result in severe disability and death. Epidemiological and laboratory research have revealed a
number of infective pathogens that precede autoimmune peripheral nerve damage thought to
represent molecular mimicry. Experiential evidence from previous coronaviruses alerted
physicians to the possibilities of links between SARS-CoV-2 and neurological diseases, of which
large patient cohorts have now been well documented. This epidemiological and cohort study
contradicts a growing number of reports postulating causation between SARS-CoV-2 and GBS,
and in fact demonstrates a reduction of GBS cases. Although prompt reporting of disease
manifestations and potential associations of COVID-19 is important to inform public health
decisions, robust scientific assessment to establish causality versus association is essential to
evolve our understanding of this novel viral pathogen and its sequelae.

Data are presented as n (%) or median (IQR). P-values represent a comparison between COVID-19 definite and COVID-19 probable to non-COVID-19 GBS. Pvalues below 0.05 are highlighted in bold. * Represents a statistically significant difference (p<0.05) between the COVID-19 cohort (definite, probable and
non-COVID-19) compared to that of the IGOS study cohort. Note that IGOS denominator values reflect worldwide cases reported (n=925) or once stratified
for ‘Europe/American’ cases (n=715) if available.
