ABSTRACT

Clinical and molecular characterization by Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) is reported in
35 COVID-19 patients attending the University Hospital in Siena, Italy, from April 7 to May
7, 2020. Eighty percent of patients required respiratory assistance, half of them being on
mechanical ventilation. Fiftyone percent had hepatic involvement and hyposmia was
ascertained in 3 patients. Searching for common genes by collapsing methods against 150
WES of controls of the Italian population failed to give straightforward statistically
significant results with the exception of two genes. This result is not unexpected since we
are facing the most challenging common disorder triggered by environmental factors with a
strong underlying heritability (50%). The lesson learned from Autism-Spectrum-Disorders
prompted us to re-analyse the cohort treating each patient as an independent case, following
a Mendelian-like model. We identified for each patient an average of 2.5 pathogenic
mutations involved in virus infection susceptibility and pinpointing to one or more rare
disorder(s). To our knowledge, this is the first report on WES and COVID-19. Our results
suggest a combined model for COVID-19 susceptibility with a number of common
susceptibility genes which represent the favorite background in which additional host
private mutations may determine disease progression.

MAIN TEXT

INTRODUCTION
Italy has been the first European Country experiencing the epidemic wave of SARS-CoV-2
infection, with an apparently more severe clinical picture, compared to other countries.
Indeed, the case fatality rate has peaked to 14% in Italy, while it remains stable around 5%
in China. At the time of the study , 12 May 2020, SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects in Italy
have reached the threshold of 200.000 cases [1]. Since the beginning of the epidemic wave,
one of the first observations has been a highly heterogeneous phenotypic response to SARSCoV-2 infection among individuals. Indeed, while most affected subjects show mild
symptoms, a subset of patients develops severe pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation
with a 20% of cases requiring hospitalization; 5% of cases admitted to the Intensive Care
Unit (ICU), and 6,1% requiring intensive support with ventilators or extracorporeal
oxygenation (ECMO) machines [2]. Although patients undergoing ventilatory assistance are
often older and are affected by other diseases, like diabetes [3], the existing comorbidities
alone do not fully explain the differences in clinical severity. As demonstrated for other viral
diseases, the basis of these different outcomes there are host predisposing genetic factors
leading to different immunogenicity/cytokine responses as well as specific receptor
permissiveness to virus and antiviral defence [4–6]. Similarly, during the study of host
genetics in influenza disease, a pattern of genetic markers has been identified which
underlies increased susceptibility to a more severe clinical outcome (as reviewed in [7]).
This hypothesis is also supported by a recent work reporting 50% heritability of COVID-19
symptoms [8].
The identification of host genetic variants associated with disease severity is of
utmost importance to develop both effective treatments, based on a personalized approach,

and novel diagnostics. Also, it is expected to be of high relevance in providing guidance for
the health care systems and societal organizations. However, nowadays, little is known
about the impact of host genome variability on COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.
On March 16th, 2020 the University Hospital in Siena launched a study named GENCOVID with the aim to collect the genomic DNA of 2,000 COVID-19 patients for host
genetic analysis. More than 30 different hospitals and community centers throughout Italy
joined the study and are providing samples and clinical detailed information of COVID-19
patients. This study is aimed to identify common and rare genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2
infected individuals, using a whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis approach, in order to
establish an association between host genetic variants and COVID-19 severity and
prognosis.

RESULTS
Clinical data
The cohort consists of 35 COVID-19 patients (33 unrelated and 2 sisters) of
Caucasian ethnicity, except for one North African and one Hispanic. The mean and median
age is 64 years (range 31-98): 11 females (median age 66 years) and 24 males (median age
62 years).
The population is clustered into four qualitative severity groups depending on the
respiratory impairment and the need for ventilation (groups 1-4 in Table 1 and different
colors in Fig. 1) (see Methods section). In the two most severe groups (groups 1 and 2,
including 13 patients) there are 11 males and 2 females, while in the two mildest groups
(groups 3 and 4 including 22 patients) males are 13 while females are 9.

Patients were also assigned a lung imaging grading according to X-Rays and CT

scans. The mean value is 13 for high care intensity group, 12 for intermediate care intensity
group, 8 for low care intensity group and 5 for very low care intensity group.
Regarding immunological findings, a decrease in the total number of peripheral
CD4+ T cells were identified in 13 subjects, while NK cells’ count was impaired in 10
patients. Six patients showed a reduction of both parameters. IL-6 serum level was elevated
in 13 patients.
Hyposmia was present in 3 out of 34 evaluated cases (8.8%), and hypogeusia was
present in the same subjects plus another case. These four cases belong to the first three
severity groups. Liver involvement was present in 7 cases (20%), while pancreas
involvement in 4 cases (11%); 10 patients presented both (29%). Heart involvement was
detected in 13 cases (37%). 9 patients (25%) showed kidney involvement. Fibrinogen values
below 200 mg/dL were identified in 2 cases (6%), between 200 and 400 mg/dL in 7 cases
(20%), and above 400mg/dL in 22 cases (63%). D-dimer value below 500 ng/mL was
present in 1 case (3%), between 500 and 5000 ng/mL in 26 cases (74%), and in 7 cases
(20%) was 10 times higher than the normal value (>5000 ng/mL) (Table 1).

Unbiased collapsing gene analysis
At first, we tested the hypothesis that susceptibility could be due to one or more
common factor(s) in the cohort of patients compared to controls. According to this idea,
damaging variants of that/those gene(s) should be either over- or under- represented in
patients vs controls. We used, as controls, individuals of the Italian population assuming that
the majority of them, if infected, would have shown no severe symptoms. WES data of 35
patients were compared with those of 150 controls (the Siena cohort of the Network of
Italian Genomes NIG: http://www.nig.cineca.it) using a gene burden test which compares
the rate of disrupting mutations per gene. The variants were collapsed on a gene-by-gene
basis, in order to identify genes with mutational burden statistically different between
COVID-19 samples and controls. The analysis identified genes harboring deleterious
mutations (according to the DANN score) with a statistically significant higher frequency in
controls than in COVID-19 patients such as the olfactory receptor gene OR4C5 (adjusted pvalue of 1.5E-10), (Fig. 2 and S1 Table) and NDUFAF7, although to a lesser extent (Fig. 2
and S1 Table). For all these genes, the susceptibility factor is represented by the functioning
(or more functioning) gene. We also identified two additional genes, PRKRA and
LAPTM4B, for which the probability of observing a deleterious variant was computed
higher in the COVID-19 samples compared to controls (Fig. 2 and S2 Table ). In these latter

cases, the functioning gene represents indeed a protective factor.

Gene analysis using the Mendelian-like model
We then tested the hypothesis that COVID-19 susceptibility is due to different
variants in different individuals. A recently acquired knowledge on the genetic bases of
Autism Spectrum Disorders suggests that a common disorder could be the sum of many
different rare disorders and this genetic landscape can appear indistinguishable at the clinical
level [9]. Therefore, we analyzed our cohort treating each patient as an independent case,
following a Mendelian-like model. According to the “pathogenic” definition in ClinVar
database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/), for each patient, we identified an average
of 1 mutated gene involved in viral infection susceptibility and pinpointing to one or more
rare disorder(s) or a carrier status of rare disorders (Fig. 1). Following the pipeline used in
routine clinical practice for WES analysis in rare disorders we then moved forward checking
for rare variants “predicted'' to be relevant for infection by the means of common annotation
tools. We thus identified an average of additional 1-5 variants per patient which summed up
to the previous identified pathogenic variants (Fig. 1, S3 Table ).

Known common susceptibility/protective variants analysis
We then checked the cohort for known non rare variants classified as either
“pathogenic” or “protective” in ClinVar database and related to viral infection. Variants in
six different genes matched the term of “viral infection” and “pathogenic” according to
ClinVar (Fig. 1). Overall, a mean of 3 genes with “pathogenic” common variants involved
in viral infection susceptibility were present (Fig. 1).
Among the common protective variants, we list as example three variants which
confer protection to Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the first two, and leprosy, the

third one: a CCR2 variant (rs1799864) identified in 8 patients, a CCR5 (rs1800940) in one
patient and a TLR1 variant (rs5743618) in 26 patients (not shown). A IL4R variant
(rs1805015) associated with HIV slow progression was present in 8 patients (not shown).

Candidate gene overview
Although not identified by unbiased collapsing gene analysis a number of obvious
candidate genes were specifically analyzed. First, we noticed that SARS-CoV-2 receptor,
ACE2 protein is preserved in the cohort, only a silent mutation V749V being present in 2
males and 2 heterozygous females. This is in line with our previous suggestion that either
rare variants or polymorphisms may impact infectivity [10]. The IFITM3 polymorphism
(rs12252) was found in heterozygosity in 4 patients as expected by frequency. Eight patients
had heterozygous missense mutations in CFTR gene reported as VUS/mild variants, 7 / 8
being among the more severely affected patients.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we present a cohort of 35 COVID-19 patients admitted between April
and May 2020 to the University Hospital of Siena who were clinically characterized by a
team of 29 MDs belonging to 7 different specialties. As expected, the majority of
hospitalized patients are males, confirming previously published data reporting a
predominance of males among the most severe COVID-19 affected patients [11]. Lung
imaging involvement, evaluated through a modified lung imaging grading system, did not
completely correlate with respiratory impairment since among the 13 patients who required
mechanical ventilation (group 1 and 2), grading was either moderate (10) or mild (3). In line
with our previous data, lymphocyte subset immunophenotyping revealed a decrease in the
total number of CD4 and NK cells count, especially in the most severe patients [12].

Laboratory tests revealed a multiple-organ involvement, confirming that COVID-19 is a
systemic disease rather than just a lung disorder (Fig. 1). We thus propose that only a
detailed clinical characterization can allow to disentangle the complex relationship between
genes and signs/symptoms.
In order to test the hypothesis that the COVID-19 susceptibility is due to one or more
genes in common among patients, we used the gene burden test to compare the rate of
disrupting mutations per gene. This test has already been successfully applied to discover
susceptibility genes for Respiratory Syncytial Virus infection [13]. We identified 2 genes
whose damage represents a susceptibility factor. Mutations in PRKRA (protein kinase
activator A, alias PACT; OMIM# *603424), a protein kinase activated by viral doublestranded RNA may impair the down-stream IFN-mediated immune response [14,15].
Mutations in LAPTM4B (Lysosomal Protein Transmembrane 4 Beta) gene, may impair
endosomal network, eventually compromising productive viral infection [16,17].
We then identified 2 genes whose damage represents a protective factor: OR4C5 and
NDUFAF7. OR4C5 is a “resurrected” pseudogene, known to be non functioning in half of
the European population, with a frequency of inactive allele of 0.62 in Asians, 0.48 in
Europeans and 0.16 in Africans [18,19]. Expression of the “resurrected” pseudogene OR4C5
may help in triggering the natural immunity leading to virus and cell death [20,21]. It is
interesting to note that protein atlas shows OR4C5 protein expression in the liver without the
corresponding mRNA expression (www.proteinatlas.org) suggesting that OR4C5 reaches
the liver through nerve terminals [22]. If this is the case, those individuals expressing the
resurrected OR4C5 gene may have more triggers of innate immunity and subsequently
higher liver damage, in agreement with the putative expression of OR4C5 (white boxes) in
patients with liver impairment (Fig. 1).
Previous studies reported a prevalence of olfactory disorders in COVID-19
population ranging from 5% to 98%. A recent meta-analysis of 10 studies demonstrated a

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.22.20108845; this version posted November 2, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

52.73% prevalence for smell dysfunction in COVID-19 subjects [23]. In our population,
only 3/35 (8.6%) subjects reported olfactory disorders. Both the limited sample size and the
characteristic of the population (severely affected hospitalized subjects) could explain this
result. However, a report focusing on smell dysfunction in severely affected hospitalized
subjects reported a prevalence of 23.7% among 59 patients [24].
We explored the hypothesis that each patient could have one unique combination of
rare pathogenic/highly relevant variants related for different reasons to infection
susceptibility [9] (Fig. 1): G6PD-deficient cells are more susceptible to several viruses
including coronavirus and have down-regulated innate immunity (in line with the observed
very low levels of IL-6) (Fig. 1) [25]; ZEB1-linked corneal dystrophy, known to function in
immune cells, and playing an important role in establishing both the effector response and
future immunity in response to pathogens [26]; TGFBI mutations (associated with corneal
dystrophy); ABCC6 gene mutations (associated with pseudoxanthoma elasticum); likely
hypomorphic mutations in CHD7 or COL5A1/2 variants, playing a role as modulators of
immune cells activity and/or response to infections [27–34]; ADAR, involved in viral RNA
editing; CLEC4M, an alternative receptor for SARS-CoV [35] HCRTR1/2, receptors of
Hypocretin, important in the regulation of fatigue during infections [36]; FURIN, a serine
protease that cleaves the SARS-Cov-2 minor capsid protein important for ACE2 contact and
viral entry into the host cells [37,38].
Finally, interesting rare variants have been identified in NitricOxide synthase NOS3
and Opioid receptor OPRM1. Opioid ligands may regulate the expression of chemokines
and chemokine receptors [39]. NitricOxide (NO), mainly produced by epithelial and white
blood cells (iNOS) and to a lesser extent by endothelial cells (eNOS), is able to significantly
reduce viral infection and replication of SARS-CoV in normal condition through two
distinct mechanisms: impairment of the fusion between the spike protein and its receptor
ACE2, and reduction of viral RNA production [40]. Mutations in NO synthase may disrupt

one or both the above reported functions and clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the
effectiveness of inhaled NO in COVID-19 patients [41,42].
Several rare variants in Interleukins (ILs) and Interleukins receptors (ILRs) are
found. Interleukins are crucial in modulating immune response against all types of infective
agents. The variants reported in this study include different interleukins that are not
specifically involved in the defense against virus but are critical in balancing both innate and
specific adaptive immune response (Fig. 1)
Furthemore, we identified common “pathogenic” variants in genes known to be
linked to viral infection, such as MBL2, IRGM and SAA1, and/or specific organ damage as
PRSS1. Polymorphisms in PRSS1, a serine protease secreted from the pancreas, are
associated with autosomal dominant hereditary pancreatitis (OMIM#167800) [43].
Polymorphisms in MBL2, a mannose-binding lectin secreted by the liver, cause increased
susceptibility to infections, possibly due to a negative impact on the ability to mount an
immune response [44,45]. Polymorphisms in IRGM may lead to impairment of autophagy
which in turn controls innate and adaptive immunity [46,47]. SAA1, encoding the serum
amyloid A (SAA) protein, is an apolipoprotein reactant, mainly produced by hepatocytes
and regulated from inflammatory cytokines. In patients with chronic inflammatory diseases,
the SAA cleavage product, Amyloid protein A (AA), is deposited systemically in vital
organs including liver, spleen and kidneys, causing amyloidosis [48].
For the last above reported genes and pathogenic variants or predicted variants
relevant for infection, a statistically significant difference in variant’s frequency was not
found between cases and controls looking at either the single variant or the single gene, as a
burden effect of variants. However, as depicted in the overall Fig. 1, we could hypothesize a
combined model in which common susceptibility genes will sum to less common or private
susceptibility variants. A specific combination of these 2 categories may determine type
(organotropism) and severity of the disease.

Our observations related to the huge amount of data, both on phenome and genome
sides, and represented in Figure 1, could also lay the bases for association rule mining
approaches. Artificial intelligence techniques based on pattern recognition may discover an
intelligible picture which appears blurred at present.
We know that a possible limitation of this study is the heterogeneity of patients and
controls, which are not matched for gender, major comorbidities and other clinical
characteristics. For this reason, further analyses in a larger cohort of samples are mandatory
in order to test this hypothesis of a combined model for COVID-19 susceptibility with a
number of common susceptibility genes which represent the fertile background in which
additional private, rare or low frequency mutations confer to the host the most favorable
environment for virus growth and organ damage.

http://www.nig.cineca.it). Patients have a mean age of 64 years with a Standard Deviation
(SD) of 14.3 while the controls have a mean age of 46 years with a SD of 9.5. The
percentage of males (M) and females (F) in patients is 68.5% and 31.4% respectively, while
in controls is 51% and 49% respectively. The patients are clustered into four qualitative
severity groups depending on the respiratory impairment and the need for ventilation: high
care intensity group (those requiring invasive ventilation), intermediate care intensity group
(those requiring non invasive ventilation i.e. CPAP and BiPAP, and high-flows oxygen
therapy), low care intensity group (those requiring conventional oxygen therapy) and very
low care intensity group (those not requiring oxygen therapy) (groups 1-4 in Table 1 and
different colors in Fig. 1).

Peripheral blood samples in EDTA-containing tubes and detailed clinical data were
collected. All these data were inserted in a section dedicated to COVID-19 of the established
and certified Biobank and Registry of the Medical Genetics Unit of the Hospital. An
example of the Clinical questionnaire is illustrated in S1 Fig. .
Each patient was assigned a continuous quantitative respiratory score, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio
(normal values >300) (P/F), as the worst value during the hospitalization.
Patients were also assigned a lung imaging grading according to X-Rays and CT scans. In
particular, lung involvement was scored through imaging at the time of admission and
during hospitalization (worst score), annotating the chest X-Ray (CXR) score (in 34
patients) and CT score in 1 patient for whom X-Rays were not available. To obtain the score
(from 0 to 28) each CXR was divided in four quadrant (right upper, right lower, left upper
and left lower) and for each quadrant the presence of consolidation (0= no consolidation; 1
<50%, 2>50%), ground glass opacities (GGOs: 0= no GGOs, 1<50%, 2 >50%), reticulation
(0= no GGOs, 1<50%, 2 >50%) and pleural effusion on left or right side (0= no, 1=
minimal; 2= large) were recorded. The same score was applied for CT (1 patient).
For each patient, the presence of hyposmia and hypogeusia was also investigated through
otolaryngology examination, Burghart sniffin’ sticks [49] and a visual analog scale (VAS).
Whenever the sign was present, a score ranging from 0 to 10 was assigned to each patient
using VAS where 0 means the best sense of smell and 10 represents the absence of smell
sensation [50].
The presence of hepatic involvement was defined on the basis of a clear hepatic enzymes
elevation as glutamic pyruvic transaminase (ALT) and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase
(AST) both higher than 40 UI/l. Pancreatic involvement was considered on the basis of an
increase of pancreatic enzymes as pancreatic amylase higher than 53 UI/l and lipase higher
than 60UI/l. Heart involvement was defined on the basis of one or more of the following
abnormal data: Troponin T (>15 ng/L), indicative of ischemic disorder; NT-proBNP (M
>88; F >153 pg/ml), indicative of heart failure and arrhythmias (indicative of electric
disorder). Kidney involvement was defined in the presence of a creatinine value higher than
1,20 mg/dl in males and higher than 1,10 mg/dl in females (Fig. 1).

Whole Exome Sequencing analysis
Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using the MagCore®Genomic DNA
Whole Blood kit (RBC Biosciences) according to manufacturer's protocol. Whole exome
sequencing analysis was performed on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system (Illumina, San

Diego, CA, USA). DNA fragments were hybridized and captured by Illumina Exome Panel
(Illumina) according to manufacturer's protocol. The libraries were tested for enrichment by
qPCR, and the size distribution and concentration were determined using an Agilent
Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The Novaseq 6000
platform (Illumina), along with 150 bp paired-end reads, was used for sequencing of DNA.

Genetic data analysis
Reads were mapped to the hg19 reference genome by the Burrow-Wheeler aligner BWA
[51]. Variants calling was performed according to the GATK4 best practice guidelines [52].
Namely, duplicates were first removed by MarkDuplicates, and base qualities were
recalibrated using BaseRecalibration and ApplyBQSR. HaplotypeCaller was used to
calculate Genomic VCF files for each sample, which were then used for multi-sample
calling by GenomicDBImport and GenotypeGVCF. In order to improve the specificitysensitivity balance, variants quality scores were calculated by VariantRecalibrator and
ApplyVQSR. Variants were annotated by ANNOVAR [53], and with the number of articles
answering the query “gene_name AND viral infection” in Pubmed, where gene_name is the
name of the gene affected by the variant.
In order to identify candidate genes according to the Mendelian-like model, rare variants
were

filtered

by

a

prioritization

approach.

We

used

the

ExAC

database

(http://exac.broadinstitute.org/), in particular the ExAC_NFE reported frequency to filter
variants according to a minor allele frequency < 0.01. Synonymous, intronic and non-coding
variants were excluded from the analysis. Mutation disease database ClinVar
(ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/) was used to identify previous pathogenicity classifications and
variants reported as likely benign/benign were discarded. Filtering and prioritization of
variants was completed using the CADD_Phred pathogenicity prediction tool. Finally, we
selected genes involved in infection susceptibility using the term “viral infection” as
Pubmed database search.
In order to identify genes with a different prevalence of functionally relevant variants
between COVID-19 patients and control samples, the following score was calculated:

Where ‫ ݓ‬is a weight associated with the i-th variant; and ‫ݔ‬, is equal to 0 if the variant is
not present in sample j, 1 if sample j has the variant in heterozygous state, and 2 if sample j
has the variant is homozygous state. The weight ‫ ݓ‬was assumed equal to the DANN score
of the variant [54], which provides an estimate of the likelihood that the variant has
deleterious functional effects (i.e. variants more likely to have a functional effect contribute
more to the score). The sum in equation (1) was performed over all the variants in the gene
where the DANN score was available. Genes with less than 5 annotated variants were
discarded from the analysis. The scores calculated by equation (1) were ranked for all the
samples, and the sum of the ranking for the COVID-19 samples, named ‫ݎ‬

, was

calculated. Then, sample labels were permuted 10.000 times, and these permutations were
used to estimate the average value and the standard deviation of ‫ݎ‬

under the null-

hypothesis. The p-value was calculated assuming a normal distribution for the sum of the
ranking [55]. Moreover, we performed an additional more stringent quality check of genetic
variants in the selected genes in order to remove calling artifacts that skipped the previous
quality control.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Fig. 1. Clinical characteristic and mutated genes. The population is clustered into four
qualitative severity groups indicated with different colors depending on the respiratory
impairment and the need for ventilation. Red color is used for high care intensity group
(those requiring invasive ventilation), orange for intermediate care intensity group (those
requiring non invasive ventilation i.e. CPAP and BiPAP, and high-flows oxygen therapy),
pink for low care intensity groups (those requiring conventional oxygen therapy) and light

blue for very low care intensity groups (those not requiring oxygen therapy). Patients
COV132-57 and COV133-58 are reported in grey because they are siblings. A detailed
clinical characterization is provided (i.e multiple organs involvement, presence of
comorbidity, clinical laboratory parameters, etc.) along with the genetic background for each
patient. Liver and pancreas involvement is indicated in green color, heart involvement in
magenta and kidney involvement in purple. The presence of hyposmia, classified from 0 to
10 using VAS score, is indicated in light blue. A darker shade of color represents a more
severe organ damage. In-silico predicted deleterious variants in genes relevant for infection
and pathogenic variants (both common and rare) reported in ClinVar Database are described
and a further subdivision between genes involved in a mendelian disorder and/or viral
infection susceptibility is provided. For all these gene categories, dark grey is used to
identify the homozygous status of the variants while light grey for the heterozygous status.
In the end, statistically significant genes obtained after Gene Burden analysis are listed:
PRKRA and LAPTM4B mutational burden resulted to be enriched in the 35 COVID-19
patients compared to the controls, while OR4C5 and NDUFAF7 have proven to have an
opposite trend, having a mutational burden more enriched in controls. For this reason, for
NDUFAF7, OR4C5, genes the grey color and the white color are inverted because having

less variants and by consequence a more functional gene represents a susceptibility factor.
For this category, white color underlies a higher mutational burden while grey color
indicates lower mutational burden. Clinical known co-morbidities: CHF (Congestive Heart
Failure), Hy (Hypertension), CC (Colon Cancer), Le (Leukemia), DM (Diabetes mellitus),
pHBV (Previous HBV infection), AMI (Acute myocardial infarction), BC (Breast Cancer),
Ht (Hypothyroidism), IC (Ictus Cerebri), O (Obesity), Dy (Dyslipidemia), KF (Kidney

Fig. 2. Mutational burden at the gene level. The significance threshold including the
Bonferroni correction is shown as a red line ( = 0.05, number of test, m = 7196). P-values
for genes below the significance threshold are shown as grey dots. Black circles are used for
the 4 genes that were identified as statistically different between COVID-19 samples and
controls.
Table 1. Clinical characteristics of Italian COVID19 patients. COVID-19 cohort is
grouped in 4 qualitative severity groups depending on the respiratory impairment and the
need of ventilation. Group 1 requires invasive ventilation. Group 2 requires
CPAP/BiPAP/high-flows oxygen therapy. Group 3 requires conventional oxygen therapy.
Group 4 does not require oxygen therapy. Clinical characteristics are listed and the number
of patients are indicated for each of them.
S1 Table. List of genes conferring COVID-19 susceptibility identified with the gene
burden test analysis. Genes harboring deleterious mutations with statistically significant
higher frequency in control than in COVID-19 patients are ordered based on p-value
deriving from gene burden test analysis. The p-value adjusted is provided after Bonferroni
correction.
S2 Table. List of COVID-19 protective genes identified with the gene burden test
analysis. Genes harboring deleterious mutations with statistically significant higher
frequency in COVID-19 patients than in control are ordered based on p-value deriving from
