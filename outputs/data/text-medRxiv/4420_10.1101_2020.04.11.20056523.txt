The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic is increasing exponentially and demands an effective and
promising therapy at most emergency.

METHODS
We have assembled a cohort consisting 504 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Detailed
information on patients’ characteristics and antiviral medication use during their stay at
designated hospitals along with their pre and post treatment results were collected.
The study objective is to evaluate the treatment efficacy of Arbidol, together with the
concurrent drugs Oseltamivir and Lopinavir/Ritonavir on mortality and lesion absorption based
on chest CT scan.

FINDINGS
The overall mortality rate was 15.67% in the cohort. The older age, lower SpO2 level, larger
lesion, early admission date, and the presence of pre-existing conditions were associated with
higher mortality. After adjusting for the patients age, sex, pre-existing condition, SpO2, lesion
size, admission date, hospital, and concurrent antiviral drug use, Arbidol was found promising
and associated with reduced mortality. The OR for Arbidol is 0·183 (95% CI, 0·075 to 0·446;
P<0·001). Furthermore, Arbidol is also associated with faster lesion absorption after adjusting
for patient’s characteristics and concurrent antiviral drug use (P=0·0203).

INTERPRETATION
The broad-spectrum antiviral drug Arbidol was found to be associated with faster

Introduction

5

Since the first discovery of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan (China) in

6

December 2019,1 more than 4.8 million people were infected and over 323,000 have died

7

across the globe as of May 22, 2020,2,3 The world-wide rapid spread of the infection with

8

limited therapeutic options is leading to a global health emergency. Meanwhile scientists and

9

researchers are racing with time testing a huge variety of new and existing treatments. As of

10

April 8, 2020, there were 388 ongoing studies on COVID-19 that are recorded in the U.S.

11

National Library of Medicine of the NIH,4 including studies involving plasma, stem cells, and

12

antiviral drugs, etc. For example, Liu et al (2020) presented preliminary results for 39 patients

13

suggesting a potential benefit of convalescent plasma treatment in reducing mortality.5

14

Much attention has been drawn to a few promising candidates, namely Remdesivir,

15

Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Hydroxychloroquine, Favipiravir and Umifenovir (Arbidol), however

16

most completed studies so far had negative results. Mehra et al (2020) reported a

17

multinational registry analysis of 96,032 patients and showed the use of Hydroxychloroquine

18

or Chloroquine was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and increased ventricular

19

arrhythmias;6 Geleris et al (2020) also reported the result of an observational study of 1446

20

patients showing Hydroxychloroquine was not associated with significant benefit on a

21

composite endpoint of intubation or death;7 Cao et al (2020) reported that no benefit was

22

observed with Lopinavir/Ritonavir treatment beyond standard care in a randomized,

23

controlled, open-label trial with 199 patients.8 Chen et al (2020) reported a randomized

24

clinical trial of 240 patients comparing Favipiravir with Arbidol, and found that Favipiravir

25

did not significantly improve the clinical recovery rate at Day 7 as compared to Arbidol.9

26

Remdesivir has been regarded as one of the most promising drug candidates, with a total of

27

three trial results becoming available so far.10-12 It was found to be superior to placebo in

28

shortening the time to recovery, but its effect on the mortality was not statistically

29

significant.11 We are still nowhere close to finding the best cure.

30

In the search for effective COVID-19 therapies, most researchers are targeting ACE2 and

31

RdRp, but recent findings also suggest CD26 (DPP4) as another possible target.13,14 Viral

32

entry is mediated via several pathways and it may not solely depend on the ACE2 which

33

warrants testing other host targets. Recently, Vankadari (2020) reported the binding and

34

mechanism of Arbidol action over the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which raises the

35

significance of Arbidol being a possible drug candidate for COVID-19 infection.15

36

In this study, we aim to evaluate the clinical effect of Arbidol with a retrospective cohort of

37

COVID-19 patients from Wuhan. We have also conducted molecular dynamics and time

38

course simulation studies in order to understand the mechanism of the Arbidol drug action

39

over the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins.

Methods

42

Study design and participants

43

We have assembled a cohort consisting 504 in-patients with COVID-19 from three hospitals

44

in Wuhan: Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (WPH), Tongji Hospital, and Union Hospital. All three

45

were designated COVID-19 hospitals during the outbreak. The study protocols were reviewed

46

and approved by the Ethics committee of WPH (WPE 2020-12). Patient records and

47

information were de-identified prior to the analysis.

48

Figure 1 shows the diagram of cohort design and patient selection. For WPH, we started with

49

all COVID-19 patients admitted between December 13, 2019 and March 21, 2020 and

50

excluded patients with ambiguous diagnosis as well as those with a primary cause of death

51

unrelated to COVID-19. After further excluding 119 patients who remained being

52

hospitalized by March 29, 2020, 373 patients from WPH were included. For Tongji Hospital,

53

100 COVID-19 patients admitted into two randomly selected hospital wards between

54

February 1, 2020 and February 5, 2002 were included. Similarly, for Union Hospital, 31

55

COVID-19 patients admitted into a randomly selected ward between January 26, 2002 and

56

February 24, 2002 were included. All patients in the study cohort have definitive outcomes,

57

i.e., discharged or deceased. All COVID-19 infections are confirmed by Real-Time PCR

58

(virus nucleic acid test).

59

Patients characteristics, medication and endpoints

60

We collected data on patients’ clinical outcomes (death or discharge) as well as basic

61

characteristics, including age, sex, pre-existing conditions, SpO2 level at hospital admission,

62

use of oxygen and ventilators during the hospital stay, and patient’s pre and post treatment

63

lung CT scan images.

64

The drug treatment options used in all three hospitals followed the Chinese National Health

65

Commission’s evolving guideline for the treatment of COVID-19, "New Corona Virus

66

Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Program”. The majority of the patients received

67

Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Arbidol and Oseltamivir. With the development of the epidemic and the

68

guideline updates, Hydroxychloroquine and Favipiravir were also used to a small number of

69

patients. The prescription of antiviral medications and their administration time for each

70

patient were extracted from electronic medical records with written consents from the

71

clinicians. In this study, we specifically focus on three anti-viral medications, Arbidol,

72

Oseltamivir, and Lopinavir/Ritonavir.

73

The primary endpoint is in-hospital death, with date of death extracted from the medical

74

records. The secondary endpoint is the change in lesion size as measured by CT scans pre and

75

post the antiviral treatment. CT scan images were read by certified thoracic radiologists at the

76

respective hospitals to determine lesion size. The pre-treatment image was selected as the first

77

CT image after the patient’s admission but before the initiation of the regular full-course

78

antiviral treatment. The post-treatment image was selected as the last CT scan taken before

79

patient’s death or discharge, which is normally after completing the antiviral therapy cycle. To

80

ensure the comparability of the two CT images, we identified the plane with the largest lesion

81

in the pre-treatment CT scan, and used the same plane in the post-treatment CT scan. The

82

lesion in the selected plane was circled and size measured by the ImageJ software (Figure 2).16

83

Statistical analysis

84

Continuous and dichotomous patient characteristics were summarized by their mean (standard

85

deviation (SD)), and count (proportion), respectively. We compared the mortality rate

86

between patients who received Arbidol, or Oseltamivir, or Lopinavir/Ritonavir and those who

87

did not using Fisher’s exact test. We then employed the logistic regression to estimate the

88

odds ratio (OR) associated with the treatment after adjusting sex, pre-existing condition,

89

medication use, hospital, and log-transformed age, SpO2 level, admission date and the lesion

90

size from the pre-treatment CT scan. Missing covariates were imputed by the medians of the

91

observed values. We also repeated the logistic regression for patients in WPH only, where the

92

potential sampling bias was the lowest. In addition, we performed Cox regression analyses

93

with time dependent covariates, setting value to 0 and 1 before and after the medication

94

prescription, respectively, to account for the timing of medication use.17 We also conducted

95

linear regression analyses with the log-transformed ratio of lesion area absorption pre and

96

post the antiviral treatments. A small value of one was added to all lesions sizes to avoid log-

97

transformation of zero. The two-sided statistical significance level was set at 0.05. All

98

statistical analyses were conducted using the R 3.3.1 software.

99

Arbidol binding analysis

100

Docking studies with Arbidol and its binding analysis to SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein was

101

performed as described in Vankadari (2020).15 In brief, SwissDock

102

(http://swissdock.ch/docking) server was used to dock the Arbidol into the published structure

103

of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein trimer (PDB: 6VSB). Structural refinement was

104

completed using Coot (www.mrc-imb.cam.uk/) to ensure no clashes in the side chain

105

residues. Best dock score and highest binding free energies were taken into consideration to

106

select the best-possible docking site and mode of interaction. Arbidol binding interface and

107

the key residues interaction map was generated using the Maestro program. The molecular

108

dynamics with time course simulation studies were performed using DynOmics server (www.

109

http://gnm.csb.pitt.edu/). The final model with Arbidol docked in the homotrimer structure of

110

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and all other structural figures were visualized using PyMol.

Results

115

Cohort baseline characteristics

116

The cohort consists of 504 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection from three hospitals:

117

373 patients from WPH, 100 patients from the Tongji Hospital, and 31 patients from the

118

Union hospital. Table 1 summarizes main drug treatment options administrated during

119

patient’s stay at the respective hospital. 257 patients received Arbidol (51·0%); 66 patients

120

received Oseltamivir (13·1%); and 259 patients received Lopinavir/Ritonavir (51·4%). The

121

majority of the patients received two or more different treatments during their hospitalization.

122

Among the 504 patients, 245 (48·6%) were female, and 262 (52·0%) had pre-existing

123

conditions. The average age of the cohort was 59·5 (SD, 14·9) years old. The average Oxygen

124

level (SpO2) at admission was 92·8% (9·3%). Patients who received Arbidol had slightly

125

higher SpO2 level and smaller lesion area compared to other patients. Patients who received

126

Oseltamivir were younger. In contrast, patients who received Lopinavir/Ritonavir had more

127

pre-existing conditions. Patients admitted to the hospital early were more likely to receive

128

Oseltamivir and Lopinavir/Ritonavir. Table 2 summarizes the baseline patients characteristics

129

by hospital.

130

The association between the treatments and mortality

131

For the cohort of 504 patients, the overall mortality rate was 15·67%. The mortality rate was

132

9·39% among females, 21·62% among males. The mortality rate was 20·23% among patients

133

with pre-existing conditions, and 10·74% among patients without pre-existing conditions. The

134

mortality rate was 17·96% in WPH, 12·00% in Tongji Hospital, and 0% in Union hospital. In

135

this cohort, older age, lower SpO2 level at admission, larger lesion, and early admission date

136

were associated with higher mortality.

137

The mortality rate was 7·00% among patients who received Arbidol compared to 24·70%

138

among patients who did not. The odds ratio (OR) was 0·230 (95% confidence interval (CI),

139

0·124 to 0·411) favoring Arbidol. On the other hand, the mortality rate was 12·12% among

140

patients who received Oseltamivir, compared to 16·21% among patients who did not. The OR

141

was 0·713 (95% CI, 0·282 to 1·589) favoring Oseltamivir. The mortality rate was 14·29%

142

among patients who received Lopinavir/Ritonavir, compared to 17·14% among patients who

143

did not. The OR was 0·806 (95% CI, 0·483 to 1·341) favoring Lopinavir/Ritonavir. After

144

adjusting for sex, pre-existing conditions, log(age), log(SpO2), log(lesion size), log(admission

145

date) and hospital (model 1) using a multivariate logistic regression model, the OR was 0·169

146

(95% CI, 0·071 to 0·398) for Arbidol, 0·212 (95% CI, 0·072 to 0·623) for Oseltamivir, and

147

0·363 (95% CI, 0·165 to 0·795) for Lopinavir/Ritonavir. After further adjustment of

148

concurrent antiviral medications (model 2), the beneficial effect of Arbidol and Oseltamivir

149

have remained statistically significant: the adjusted OR was 0·183 (95% CI, 0·075 to 0·446;

150

p<0·001) for Arbidol and 0·220 (95% CI, 0·069 to 0·707; P=0·011) for Oseltamivir (Figure

151

3A).

152

The association between the treatments and the reduction of lung lesion sizes

153

There were 326 survivors with two available CT scans. The average reductions in lesion size

154

were 46·43% (SD: 29·00%) among the 209 patients who received Arbidol and 36·80% (SD:

155

24·95%) among the 117 patients who did not. The average reduction among the 55 patients

156

who received Oseltamivir was less than that among the 271 patients who did not (41·18% vs

157

43·34%). The reduction among the 186 patients who received Lopinavir/Ritonavir was also

158

less than the 140 patients who did not (37·26% vs. 50·56%). After adjusting for patients’

159

characteristics and concurrent antiviral drug use using a multivariate linear regression model,

160

the ratio of the lesion size (post-treatment to pre-treatment) among patients who received

161

Arbidol was 85·20% (95% CI, 74·47% to 97·48%; P=0·0203) of that among patients who did

162

not, suggesting a faster lesion absorption. Figure 3B summarized the linear regression

163

analysis results for all three antiviral drugs. Figure 4A shows the boxplots of the lesion

164

absorptions in the stratified subgroups of patients by the three antiviral drugs, with patients

165

who received Arbidol (dark turquoise) showing more absorption than patients who did not

166

(light turquoise).

167

Subgroup analysis in WPH

168

For the 373 patients in WPH, the mortality rate was 7·09% among patients who received

169

Arbidol vs. 24·57% among patients who did not (OR=0·234, 95% CI, 0·103 to 0·481,

170

P<0·001). After adjusting for sex, pre-existing condition, log(age), log(SpO2), log(lesion

171

area), log(admission date), and concurrent antiviral drug use using a multivariate logistic

172

regression model, Arbidol was associated with significantly reduced mortality (OR, 0·193;

173

95% CI, 0·071 to 0·520, P=0·001). The effect of Oseltamivir was marginally significant (OR,

174

0·326; 95% CI, 0·090 to 1·177; P=0·087). Figure 3C summarized detailed results.

175

Survival analysis

176

Among the patients who received Arbidol, the median prescription time was 1·50 (IQR: 0·505

177

2·50, range, 0·50-31·50) days after admission. For Oseltamivir and Lopinavir/Ritonavir, the

178

median prescription time was 0·50 (IQR: 0·50 to 1·50, range, 0·50-25·50) and 0·50 (IQR:

179

0·50 to 2·50, range, 0·50-32·50) days after admission, respectively. After adjusting for

180

baseline characteristics and concurrent antiviral drug use using a multivariate cox

181

proportional hazard ratio model, the hazard ratio was 0·350 (95% CI, 0·177 to 0·689;

182

P=0·002) for Arbidol, 0·571 (95% CI, 0·269 to 1·211) for Oseltamivir, and 0·720 (95% CI,

183

0·426 to 1·218) for Lopinavir/Ritonavir based on Cox regression stratified by hospitals

184

(Figure 3D). Figure 4B shows the cumulative mortality curves for the three antiviral drugs.

185

There is a significant difference between the mortality curve for patients who received

186

Arbidol versus patients who did not (P < 0·001) whereas the differences are not statistically

187

significant for Oseltamivir (P = 0·34) and Lopinavir/Ritonavir (P = 0·33).

188

Arbidol and SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein interaction

189

It is evident from the previous studies that Arbidol is potentially effective against SARS-

190

CoV-2.13 The recent structural studies of Arbidol in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike

191

glycoprotein underlines its role in impeding trimerization,15 which is essential for virulence.

192

Here we address how this drug disrupts the viral spike glycoprotein through comprehensive

193

drug interaction via molecular dynamics and time course simulation studies. As shown in

194

Figure 5A, each monomer of spike glycoprotein consists of large surface for drug interaction

195

and it could completely accommodate the drug in the trimer interface (Figure 5A and 5B).

196

The time course simulation and drug interaction studies show that the Arbidol disrupt the

197

interface in all directions and its binding affinity found to be very high (Figure 5C). The

198

interaction is not only mediated by hydrogen bonding and van-der Wall forces but also by

199

several polar residues bridge with the spike glycoproteins (Figure 5D). Furthermore, the

200

dynamic simulation and domain movement or oscillation studies show that binding of Arbidol

201

to the spike glycoprotein increases the B-factor (stability factor) (Figure 5E), suggesting

202

protein is under higher movement and is less stable or tend to dissociate from other

203

monomers. These structural and molecular dynamic studies further corroborate our clinical

204

finding of CT scans showing greater viral clearance observed with Arbidol treatment.

205
206

Discussion

207

The study showed promising treatment effect of Arbidol on mortality and lesion absorption.

208

On the other hand, the benefit of Lopinavir/Ritonavir is inconclusive, which is consistent with

209

the previous finding of Cao et al. (2020), where Lopinavir/Ritonavir has reduced the mortality

210

from 25·0% to 19·2% in a randomized clinical trial, but failed to reach the statistical

211

significance threshold.8 Recently, Xu et al, (2020) reported that the virologic conversion rate

212

in 49 patients who received Arbidol was significantly higher than that in 62 patients who

213

received the standard care (59·2% vs 40·3%, P=0·048).19 In this study, the patients who

received Arbidol also had faster lung lesion absorption (55·1% vs 32·2%). Despite the limited

215

sample size, their results further corroborated our findings. The dual role of Arbidol in

216

inhibiting the fusion between the viral envelope and target host cell membrane as well as anti-

217

inflammation could be responsible for its observed efficacy.20, 21

218

Oseltamivir is normally prescribed for the treatment of influenza and has no known effect on

219

COVID-19 patients. However, some patients have been infected by both COVID-19 and

220

Influenza,22 which may exacerbate their clinical conditions. It is very likely that a

221

combination of drugs or therapy including Oseltamivir can help this subgroup of patients due

222

to the effectiveness of Oseltamivir in treating severe illness caused by Influenza. In addition,

223

SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses share a similar region of viral spike protein, which may

224

also explain the potential effect of Oseltamivir in treating COVID-19 patients.13

225

There are some important limitations in the current study. First, the study is not a randomized

226

clinical trial, and therefore the observed treatment benefit of Arbidol and Oseltamivir may be

227

due to confounding effect. The analysis has adjusted for several known confounders including

228

age, comorbidities, admission date, and disease severity measured through SpO2 and CT

229

scan. Furthermore, given the size of the estimated treatment effect, the unmeasured

230

confounding effect needs to be very strong to completely account for this benefit. Second, we

231

didn’t account for the effect of important supporting treatment such as oxygen and ventilator

232

use. Their availability and deployment may affect the estimated treatment effect. Third,

233

although the cohort size is 504, the patients from Tongji and Union Hospitals are not

234

necessarily the most representative samples of patients admitted into these hospitals. For

235

example, ICU patients in these two hospitals are not included. We have also excluded

236

surviving patients not yet discharged from WPH by March 29, 2020, and consequently, the

237

observed mortality rate among patients from WPH is substantially higher than that from

238

Tongji and Union Hospitals. These sampling biases may affect the interpretation and

239

generalizability of our findings. For example, the reported mortality rate doesn’t represent the

240

absolute mortality rate in the patients admitted into relevant hospital. Furthermore, there are

241

only 33 patients who received both Arbidol and Oseltamivir in the entire cohort, which limits

242

the reliability of the estimated treatment benefit associated with the combination therapy. On

243

the other hand, despite the limited sample size and selective sampling, all identified risk

244

factors in the current study are consistent with other studies,22,23 which indirectly supports our

245

findings on the treatment efficacy. The association between admission date and mortality can

246

also be explained by the availability of medical resources. Lastly, regarding the adverse

247

events, nausea was observed in a small group of patients who received Arbidol. Loss of

248

appetite was observed in patients who received Oseltamivir. Whereas Diarrhea, nausea,

249

vomiting, loss of appetite and decreased sleep quality were observed in patients who received

250

Lopinavir/Ritonavir. Due to the difficulty in accurate and complete documentation of all

251

adverse events during the pandemic, the study team did not summarize these data in this

252

report. Nevertheless, it is known that the severe adverse effects associated with the use of

253

Arbidol and Oseltamivir have been very rare.21,24

254

Arbidol is originated from Russia as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug and is now widely used

255

in Russia as an OTC drug and in China as a prescription drug. Although Arbidol was reported

256

to effectively shorten the duration of influenza and prevent the development of post-influenza

257

complications, reduce the re-infection risk based on multiple clinical trials conducted in

258

Russia and China,25 due to lack of detailed information regarding these trials, WHO suggested

259

that the results should be interpreted with caution.26 Consequently, Arbidol has not received

260

FDA approval in the United States and the use of Arbidol in other parts of the world has been

261

limited. However, while drafting this manuscript, we have found that eight clinical trials

262

(NCT04350684, NCT04286503, NCT04260594, NCT04273763, NCT04323345,

263

NCT04261907, NCT04306497, NCT04333589) in China, Iran and Egypt involving Arbidol

264

in treating COVID-19 patients were registered at www.clinicaltrial.gov.

265

In conclusion, our clinical and molecular biological findings suggest that Arbidol might be a

266

potentially effective treatment for COVID-19. Further clinical studies including RCTs are

267

warranted for statistical and clinical evaluation of its efficacy.

Figure 2: Chest CT scan images before and after the antiviral treatment. The shaded areas
circled by the yellow line were the lesion areas. Using ImageJ, we were able to quantify the
sizes of the lesions in terms of squared centimeters. (A) A male patient in his 50s with no
underlying diseases who have received Arbidol alone. (B) A male patient in his 50s with no
underlying diseases who have received Oseltamivir + Lopinavir/Ritonavir, since no patient has
received Oseltamivir alone. (C) A male patient in his 50s with no underlying diseases who have
received Lopinavir/Ritonavir alone.

Figure 3: (A) The estimated OR and associated 95% CI for Arbidol, Oseltamivir and
Lopinavir/Ritonavir. (B) The estimated effect on relative change in lesion size and associated
95% CI for Arbidol, Oseltamivir and Lopinavir/Ritonavir. An effect less than 1 suggests that
more relative reduction in lesion size is associated with the medicine of interest. (C) The
estimated OR and associated 95% CI for Arbidol, Oseltamivir and Lopinavir/Ritonavir among
373 patients from WPH. (D) The estimated hazard ratio and associated 95% CI for Arbidol,
Oseltamivir and Lopinavir/Ritonavir based on the Cox regression analyses with time dependent
covariates accounting for timings of medication use.
Model 1: adjusting for sex, pre-existing condition, log(age), log(SpO2), hospital, log(lesion
size) and log(admission date); Model 2: adjusting for confounders in Model 1 and medication
use (Arbidol, Oseltamivir, and Lopinavir/Ritonavir).
