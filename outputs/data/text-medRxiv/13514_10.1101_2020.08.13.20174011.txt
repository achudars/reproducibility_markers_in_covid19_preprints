Abstract
Background: It is of interest to explore the variability in how the COVID-19 pandemic
evolved geographically during the first twelve months. To this end, we apply inequality
indices over regions to incidences, infection related mortality, and infection fatality
rates. If avoiding of inequality in health is an important political goal, a metric must be
implemented to track geographical inequality over time.
Methods: The relative and absolute Gini index as well as the Theil index are used
to quantify inequality. Data are taken from international data bases. Absolute counts
are transformed to rates adjusted for population size.
Results: Comparing continents, the absolute Gini index shows an unfavorable
development in four continents since February 2020. In contrast, the relative Gini as
well as the Theil index support the interpretation of less inequality between European
countries compared to other continents. Infection fatality rates within the EU as well as
within the U.S. express comparable improvement towards more equality (as measured
by both Gini indices).
Conclusions: The use of inequality indices to monitor changes in geographic inequality over time for key health indicators is a valuable tool to inform public health
policies. The absolute and relative Gini index behave complementary and should be
reported simultaneously in order to gain a meta-perspective on very complex dynamics.

Introduction
It is of interest to evaluate the distributional inequality (between regions, over time) of
key indicators representing COVID-19 effects: Incidence (rates, IR), mortality (rates,
MR), and the infection fatality (rate, IFR). These measures inform global as well
as regional health policies. Many sources, such as private, institutional, national, or
international dashboards provide these information as maps or enumerated in long lists.
The information presented reflect global geographic scenarios or are focused on smaller
scale areas. How different is the documented pandemic activity worldwide, in particular
between continents, between nations or between sub-regions of larger geographical
entities? How does this heterogeneity change over time and how does it depend on
geographic scale? Furthermore, it is of interest to study inequality across regions with
a common health policy framework, such as the European Union (EU) or the United
States of America (U.S.).
In general, such maps or listings are not accompanied by general purpose measures
to quantify heterogeneity or inequality. Often, the analyst uses the ”eyeball test” to

scan over the data quickly. Sometimes, caterpillar plots represent estimates of the same
parameter, such as incidence rate and illustrate their variability over a set of units.
Following information presented in maps or long lists over time is a further challenge.
However, a more formal approach is needed to study heterogeneity or inequality of
complex dynamics over space and time.
In this paper, heterogeneity is studied in terms of inequality. Inequality measures
examine the distribution of a single variable whose data are arranged in a monotonic
order. A theoretical and methodological discussion of how to measure inequality is found
in the economic literature [1].
Among the most common inequality metrics are the relative Gini index (GIrel ) and
the Theil index (TI). The GIrel is the mean absolute distance between the observations
divided by their mean. It takes values between 0 and 1 (0 equality, 1 maximal inequality).
The reason for its popularity is that the GIrel is equal to the ratio of two areas in Lorenz
curve diagrams, which are widely used in economics [2].
The Theil index is entropy based and decreases with increasing entropy. As for any
distribution and with reference to information theory, maximum entropy occurs once the
observations cannot be distinguished by their values, i.e. when there is perfect equality.
The more ”distinguishable” observations are, the lower is the ”actual entropy” of a
system consisting of regions with a specific disease status. The TI has obvious, intuitive,
plausible and natural justification, rather than just being justified in terms of entropy.
It’s maximum is given by the natural logarithm of the population size.
This paper also studies the absolute Gini index (GIabs ), which is the mean absolute
difference between observations. The GIabs is scale dependent. For X, the variable
of interest, it holds that GIrel (c·X)=GIrel (X), but GIabs (c·X)=c·GIabs (X). If absolute
differences do not change but the mean of the variable will increase over time, the
GIabs remains the same but the GIrel will decrease over time (see Eqs. (1) and (2)). It
is recommended to use the GIabs as the more reliable measure of inequality for time
dependent analyses compared to GIrel [3].
It is not common to use inequality indices based on quadratic distances like variance
or standard deviation. Metrics based on such squared distances diminish small (<1) and
exaggerate larger differences (>1).
Inequality indices have been introduced by economists. However, besides their use in
economic settings they also play a role in health-related topics, where they are mainly
used to study health equity. Equity goals, such as equal treatment for equal need or
equality of access to health care, are central to health policy [4]. Specific applications
of the GIrel and GIabs regarding equity in health and health care are geographical
inequality in mortality and life expectancy, and access to and distribution of health care
resources [5–11]. Inequality indices are also used to study the spread of infectious diseases.
How does the distribution of sexually transmitted diseases depend on level of sexual
activity [12]? How is the inequality between malaria prevalence among populations [13]?
Inequality studies also concern the distribution of patient recruitment into clinical trials
in different settings [14].
Williams and Doessel [15] review the economic literature on inequality measures
from the perspective of health scientists. They stress the relevance of measures, such
as Gini indices, Theil’s Index of Entropy or Atkinson’s Measure [1] and state: ”It is
often important in measuring inequality to report several measures/indexes, within the
constraints of the data available, and to examine the strengths and weaknesses of each
measure. In so doing, the nature of the inequality is depicted more accurately, and one
can weight equity judgements more wisely, than is possible by emphasising any single
measure of inequality”.
Health equity goals for COVID-19 are formulated by several agencies, see for example [16]. Inequities in social determinants of health that put groups at increased risk of

getting sick and dying from COVID-19 include: healthcare and utilization; occupation,
educational, income, or wealth gaps; and housing. Achieving health equity requires as a
first step quantifying health inequality before focusing efforts on preventable inequities
and eliminating inequities in health and health care. The population health impact of
COVID-19 has exposed longstanding inequities that have systematically undermined
the physical, social, economic, and emotional health of racial and ethnic minority populations and other population groups that are bearing a disproportionate burden of
COVID-19 [17].
To the best of our knowledge, inequality in COVID-19 infections and related deaths
has not been quantitatively investigated by using indices of inequality. We also explore
inequality in infection fatality rates. A specific focus of our paper is the comparison of
inequality between the United States and the European Union.

Materials and methods
The Data
Global infection and death data were retrieved from the Johns Hopkins University Center
for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) COVID-19 Data Repository [18].
Data between January 29, 2020 and February 2, 2021 were used. Population data for
each country were extracted from the COVID-19 database of the European Centre for
Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) [19], which includes a population estimate
for 2019. Data on the assignment of countries to continents were also extracted from
the ECDC data. A subset of the JHU CSSE data was the basis for the analysis of the
EU and the U.S. data. The list of the current member states of the EU was obtained
from the official website of the EU [20] and excludes the United Kingdom. Of note, the
continent Europe contains a broader selection of countries. Population data of 2019
for each U.S. state were obtained from the United States Census Bureau [21]. We did
not include Puerto Rico in our analyses and also excluded all cruise ship data and data
regarding repatriated travellers. Due to large geographic distances, we also excluded
data from all overseas territories for the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and France.
Note that because of the small number of countries and infections and deaths within
countries in Oceania, measures of inequality were not calculated for this continent. The
nine affected countries are Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Solomon
Islands, Marshall Island, Samoa, Micronesia and Vanuatu. In the latter five countries, a
total of 80 infections and no COVID-19 related deaths have been reported up to February
2, 2021.
The data were analyzed with R (Version 3.6.3) [22]. Both Gini indices were calculated using the DescTools package [23], the Theil index was evaluated using the dineq
package [24] and for the likelihood-ratio test the package lmtest was used [25].

The disease measures
The incidence and mortality parameters (IR(t) and MR(t)) at day t are the cumulative
seven days incidences per 100,000 persons before day t. The data was aggregated over
the past seven days and we are working with discrete time points of t= 7, 14, 21, etc.
The IFR(t) at day t is the ratio of MR(t)/IR(t-14). The chosen time shift follows
an established practice [26, 27]. As described above, we use population size data in
combination with data on the corresponding positive test results and fatalities associated
with COVID-19. There will be no correction for undetected SARS-CoV-2 infections and
no adjustment for testing strategies. Formally we work with the test-positive fatality
ratio (TPFR), which is the ratio of documented COVID-19 related deaths to documented

positively tested persons. Strictly speaking, TPFR should be distinguished from IFR,
which includes all infected persons (with and without symptoms) in the denominator.
Because of untested infected persons without symptoms, it is plausible that IFR ≤
TPFR. Following common parlance, we use the term naive IFR (nIFR) instead of TPFR.
The disease measures are adjusted for population size that makes counts more
comparable across countries. No adjustment for sex and age is feasible due to missing
data. Time-course data of inequality indices between parts of a unit is based on counts
aggregated within a part over non-overlapping short periods of seven days.

Indices of inequality
The empirical relative Gini index is defined as
Pn Pn
GIrel =

i=1

j=1 |xi

,

(1)

where x is an observed value (such as a specific incidence rate), n is the number of values
observed and x̄ is the mean value. Alternative formulae can be found in [28]. The GIrel
takes values between 0 and 1, which follows from the inequality |x − y| ≤ |x| + |y|. The
GIrel is scale invariant. In a setting of n parts of a unit where n − 1 parts have value 0
2·(n−1)·w·n
and one part has value w, it follows that x̄ = w
∼ 1.
n and GIrel =
2·n2 ·w
We combine this invariance with the nIFR: MR(t)=nIFR(t)· IR(t-14). Here MR(t)
represents the incidence of death at day t given the nIFR(t) and IR(t-14), the naive IFR
at day t and the incidence of infected 14 days before. Assuming a constant nIFR(t) over
the parts of a larger unit, it holds GIrel,Infection = GIrel,Death .
There are no established cut-offs to qualify specific GIrel values. The presented figures
for the GIrel show quintile regions defined by 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1. This allows to have
a neutral category in the middle and two ratings for inequality (strong: 0.6 to 0.8; high:
0.8 to 1) as well as equality (in terms of inequality low: 0.2 to 0.4; diminished; 0 to 0.2).
The GIrel of exponential distribution with rate 1 is about 0.5 and of uniform distribution
about 0.33. A gamma distribution with mean 20 and variance 40 has a GIrel of 0.18.
The GIrel of a Pareto distribution with α = 0.7 and threshold equal to 100 is close to 1.
The empirical absolute Gini index can be calculated as
Pn Pn
i=1
j=1 |xi − xj |
GIabs =

2n2
where x is an observed value (such as a specific incidence rate) and n is the number of
values observed. In a setting of n parts of a unit where n − 1 parts have value 0 and one
part has value w, it follows that GIabs ∼ w
n.
The Theil index is defined as

where x is an observed value (such as a specific incidence rate), n is the number of values
observed, x̄ is the mean value and log stands for the natural logarithm. In a setting of n
parts of a unit where n − 1 parts have value 0 and one part has value w, it follows that
x̄ = w
n and TI = log(n). This motivates the fact that the TI has the maximum log(n),
the largest inequality value between n observations.
We use the bias-corrected bootstrap to calculate the confidence interval of the indices
of interest [29, 30].

Poisson regression for infection fatality rates
This section introduces classical testing theory to assess the null hypothesis nIFR is
equal over the parts of a unit. To reject the null hypothesis we apply Poisson regression
and the likelihood-ratio test. The dependent variable is the absolute cumulative death
count per observational unit (i.e. federal state or country) and the independent variable
is the state or country itself. We used absolute cumulative infection counts over a specific
region and time period as offset. The likelihood ratio test is performed between the
model containing the countries and an offset-adjusted intercept (M1) with the model
without the countries (M0).

Overview of the global data
Up to February 2, 2021, globally around 104 million (103,869,117) SARS-CoV-2 infections
and 2.3 million (2,253,049) related deaths have been reported. The transmission of
the virus has been documented in total of 190 countries and the reported number of
infections per country varies between 1 (Micronesia, Vanuatu) and 26.3 million (U.S.).
Deaths related to the virus have been documented in 179 countries and the number of
deaths per affected country varies between 0 and 446,881. The three countries with the
highest number of reported infections (deaths) are the U.S., India, and Brazil (the U.S.,
Brazil, and Mexico).

Fig 2. Absolute Gini indices for different continents. Absolute Gini indices
(GI) for infection rates (left column), and for death rates and naive infection fatality
rate nIFR (right column) for Africa (a and b), America (c and d), Asia (e and f) and
Europe (g and h). The coloured bands show the 95% confidence intervals. The
horizontal axis shows the time between February 2020 and February 2021.
A different view on inequality is given by the GIabs values presented in Fig 2, where
inequality in absolute terms in shown. The six panels for the three A-continents (Figs 2a
to f) show slight increases in GIabs values for IRs and MRs over time. The two panels
for Europe (Figs 2g and h) reflect the effects of the two pandemic waves and the relaxed
situation during the summer 2020. While the pandemic expands, absolute differences
increase. From Eq. (2) it follows that a comparison between the GIabs,IR and GIabs,MR
gives a rough estimate of the corresponding geographic nIFR. For winter 2020, the
nIFR in Europe is about 2% while the nIFR of Africa, the Americas and Asia are 2.5%,
2.5% and 1.5%, respectively. The GIabs,nIFR time course follows the time course of the

relevant parameters IR and MR: The mean of absolute differences between observations
correlates with the mean of these observations.
The results of the continental Theil indices are shown in S1 Fig. The TI time course
follows qualitatively the GIrel time course. The maxima of TI values differ between
continents, since each continent consists of a different number of countries. At the
beginning, there is large inequality for both IR and MR. The time course of TI is similar
for both IR and MR. Africa and Asia have the highest values, Europe the lowest, the
Americas are in the middle position. Compared to the range of possible values, the
indices are predominantly in the lower half or lower third. The TI values for Europe
are even close to zero. The TI values for the nIFRs are less regular compared to those
presented using the GIrel .

Inequality in U.S. and EU data
Fig 3 shows the time course of the incidence data for infections and mortality for the U.S.
and the EU. They are used to calculate the inequality indices after being accumulated
over a period of seven days.
Figs 3a and b show IR per 100,000 population for each of the 51 U.S. federal and of
the 27 EU member states, respectively. Prominent peaks in the U.S. data (Fig 3a) can
be seen for the states of New York in the spring and Arizona and Florida during the
summer. The highest IR of over 1,200 new infections per 100.000 population during one
week is seen for North Dakota in the fall of 2020.
In the EU (Fig 3b), Luxembourg had the highest 7-day IR during the first wave in
spring 2020. During the fall and winter Belgium, Lithuania, and France and Denmark
show the highest IRs.
In terms of MR (Fig 3c), similar to IR, New York and New Jersey reported the
highest MRs within the U.S. in the spring 2020. In the fall and winter, South Dakota
and, more recently, Alabama reported the highest MRs. In the EU in spring 2020, the
highest MRs were reported for Belgium (Fig 3d). During the second wave in Europe,
Czechia, Slovenia, and most recently Portugal reported the highest MRs within the EU
member states. Figs 3e and f show the state-specific nIFRs, respectively.
The GIrel and GIabs values calculated from the incidence data of Fig 3 are shown in
left column of Fig 4 for the U.S. and in the right column for the EU. A more detailed
picture of the inequality in nIFR for both regions is shown in Fig 5.
The GIrel values for infections are below the GIrel values for mortality (Figs 4a and b).
The time courses for the GIrel of both parameters decrease and represent more equality
between federal or member states during the pandemic. The incidence curves represented
in Fig 3 demonstrate that for the U.S. (a and c) as well as for the EU (b and d) equality
increases as the second wave of the pandemic begins. The time course of GIrel,nIFR values
demonstrate similar index values during the winter 2020/2021. At the last observation
time the GIrel,nIFR = 0.28 (CI: 0.21, 0.37) for the U.S. and GIrel,nIFR = 0.34 (CI: 0.27,
0.46) for the EU, respectively. The hump in the European GIrel,nIFR values during the
summer 2020 is a result of low IR and MR values. Here two methodological aspects of the
GIrel may be instrumental: Given a fixed mean absolute difference between observations,
the GIrel decreases if the mean of the observations increases, the GIrel increases if the
mean of the observations decreases.
The GIabs values reflect the seasonality of the pandemic: high GIabs values during the
both waves, low value during the summer without excessive pandemic activity. While
the EU shows higher MR inequality compared to the U.S. during the first wave of the
pandemic, the second wave shows comparable values between the EU and the U.S. Based
on the argument that the comparison between GIabs,IR and GIabs,MR reflects the nIFR,
the time course of both indices allows a crude nIFR estimate over time. For winter
2020, the nIFR in the EU is about 2.5% while the nIFR in the U.S. around 1.8% (see

also Table 1). The values of the GIabs,nIFR get very low with time (Figs 5c and d). In
February 2021, the GIabs,nIFR = 0.004 (CI: 0.003, 0.006) for the U.S. and GIabs,nIFR =
0.009 (CI: 0.007, 0.012) for the EU. These values are comparable to the nIFR values
calculated based on cumulative data shown in S1 Table and S2 Table.
The TI values are presented in the supplement in S2 Fig. The left column shows
TI values based on the U.S. data, the right column TI values based on the EU data.
For all three parameters of interest (upper row: TIs for IR and MR; lower row: TIs for
nIFR) the figures show a high level of inequality at the begin of the pandemic and a
pronounced drop after the first wave to low TI values indicating equality. The dynamic of
the TI values is comparable to that of the GIrel values. The visual impression (especially
the sharp drop of values after the first wave) indicates higher equality in terms of TI
compared to the GIrel value.
(Member) State-specific nIFRs for both regions can be found in the Supporting
Information (S1 Table – S2 Table).

Discussion
During a pandemic, differences in incidence and number of deaths between countries
and regions are not surprising findings. What does it add to use specific metrics to
monitor the inequalities within larger political or geographic units over time? What are
the political and/or moral implications? What does it mean for policy making?
As citizens of the EU, the authors miss a concise communication on the state of
the European Union regarding central pandemic indicators. We consider metrics for
equality/inequality as more comprehensive than looking at maps, following them over
shorter or longer periods, performing an eye ball test by relating the gap between the best
or worst performer, or discussing a series of caterpillar plots for the respective parameters.
Also an U.S. American citizen wishes to be informed about how the pandemic load is
distributed over his or her country. As the result of our paper, the GIabs provides an
easy to understand quantitative statement which summarizes complex information.
The need for concise quantitative information on the pandemics time course over
large geographical regions also holds for other global political structures in different
continents to coordinate political interests (OAU - Organization of African Union;
ASEAN - Association of Southeast Asian Nations; UNASUR - Union of South American
Nations). The spread of the epidemic within these bodies is also of high political interest.
As measures for the inequality of national income guide many aspects of policy making,
measures for the inequality in health related issues are (especially over longer time
periods of heavy dynamics) of similar importance. Policy making in a larger geographic
area with high inequalities should build on local or regional measures. Policy making in
a larger geographic area with high equality can build on more centralized components.
The causes of geographic inequality are complex. Inequality between nations reflects
distinct health care systems, incompatible administrative structures, but also disparate
documentation and reporting processes. Differences in demography will cause inequality
regarding the disease measures of interest. Countries with young populations (like India
with a mean age of 28 years) may show a different death rate compared to countries with
higher average age. This paper does not study the features of nations that contribute to
inequality, but focuses on how to transform inequality into accessible information.
The aim of this paper is to explore the relevance of well established indices to monitor
inequality in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 death incidences over time, taking
continental, or national views. Three inequality indices are considered: The relative Gini
index GIrel , the absolute Gini index GIabs , and the Theil index TI. They are widely used
in the economic as well as in the health-economic literature. There are several pros and
cons for each of these candidates.

The GIrel is the oldest and best known inequality index. Formally, the GIrel can be
used to compare inequalities between larger groups of countries (between continents or
between the U.S. and the EU). However, GIrel values have to be interpreted with care:
Low GIrel (increasing equality, decreasing inequality) can be observed in settings where
the pandemic aggravates and countries get more equal in a worse misery. Decreasing
infection or mortality rates, on the other hand, can result in higher GIrel values indicating
more inequality. The GIrel is equal to 1 in a setting of a well-contained epidemic where
one country bears the entire burden of infection, while the remaining countries show no
epidemic activities.
The GIabs does not show such behavior. A GIabs,IR = 100 means that the the mean
absolute difference in infection rates is 100 between two randomly selected countries.
The actual range of the GIabs is not uniformly fixed as for the GIrel , but depends on the
specific setting. In our examples the ranges for GIabs,IR and GIabs,MR are quite different.
The GIabs makes sense for comparisons over time within the same group. A crude nIFR
estimate results by comparing the GIabs,MR with GIabs,IR .
The Theil index uses the concept of entropy and its maximum depends on the group
size. Therefore, it is also useful for comparisons over time. A high TI value can be
understood as quantifying the evidence that a high rate comes from a particular country.
This is the same as the share of a specific country in the distribution of the rates. A
low TI value indicates a situation where it is difficult to decide if a specific country has
low or high values. This is a property also shared with the GIrel . The TI and GIrel are
sensitive to the relative distribution of low and high values within observations. Both
show high values if only a few units are represented with large observations and both
decrease as more units occupy larger values. The TI seems to be more liberal towards
equality by showing more distinct drops towards smaller values during the pandemic.
We observe in our data that the GIabs rises while the GIrel decreases. This holds for
infection as well as mortality rates. While the GIrel mirrors more equality, inequality in
an absolute sense increases. The GIrel makes inequality issues regarding central pandemic
indicators into a more salient political issue.
Of all continents Africa shows the highest relative and the lowest absolute inequality.
This might be related to underreporting due to limited testing capacities and/or access
to health care. Similar to Africa also Asia shows high relative and low absolute inequality.
Asia contains a heterogeneous mixture of countries, so that it was surprising to find that
low absolute inequalities: China which handled the epidemic apparently successful, India
with a very young population and Japan with very old population. Japan has also a
successful epidemic management with daily case counts far below the counts of Germany.
The Americas as continent show steadily increasing absolute inequality in both infection
and mortality rates. The European continent shows a very different shape of absolute
inequality in infection and mortality rates over time, clearly reflecting both pandemic
waves.
A specific interest of this study is to explore inequality between infection fatality
rates across geographic areas over time. As a reviewer pointed out: ”Inequalities in IFR
can be argued to be of moral significance (fairness), and such inequalities may also have
policy implications as countries/regions should aim the lowest possible IFR.” The results
regarding the inequality in nIFR are presented in several figures: Panels b, d, f, h of Fig 1
show the relative inequality for the continents with Europe showing the lowest inequality.
Panels b, d, f, h of Fig 2 show the absolute inequality. Since the GIabs is the mean
absolute difference in the variable of interest between two randomly selected countries,
the GIabs, nIFR has a direct interpretation as the mean difference in nIFR between two
randomly selected countries. Panels e, f, g, h of Fig 4 show the relative and absolute
inequality in nIFR for the U.S. and the EU. The relative inequality in the U.S. seems
lower than for the EU during the summer 2020. In the winter the relative inequality

evens out. The absolute inequality points towards mean nIFR difference of 0.4% (CI:
0.3%, 0.6%) between two random U.S. states and 0.9% (CI: 0.7%, 1.2%) between two
random EU member states, respectively.
A comparison between the U.S. and the EU based on inequality indices is of high
interest. There have been many rumours in the European media about how the U.S.
performed during the pandemic. Further, the media coverage of the EU situation offered
many narratives with permanently changing focus. Therefore, the paper takes a metalook by using inequality indices for a broader comparison between both political bodies.
Figs 4 and 5 show regional variability in the three pandemic key indicators. GIrel as well
as GIabs drop down to low values reflecting equality in absolute as well as relative terms.
We see the quantification of inequality in COVID-19 key data across different geographic regions as a strength of our study. We considered three different inequality
indices and discussed their strengths and weaknesses. Inequality was evaluated at different geographical scales (continental, national) and by means of Poisson regression. We
see the concept of inequality as a complement to the dichotomous statistical thinking
of difference yes/no. We also compared the inequality between the EU and the U.S.
providing insights into the matter of relative and absolute inequality. We see it as
important that mortality risk, infection risk, risk to be hospitalized or the type of
treatment does not depend on where one lives. How close a community is to achieving
this goal is quantified by specific measures of inequality. This stresses the relevance of
the presented results.
Our study also comes with some limitations, which are mainly related to the quality
of the data we work with. Different countries might report differently. While some
countries do not have a systematic reporting system, others might only report suspected
COVID-19 or PCR-confirmed cases. Same thoughts can be applied to reporting of deaths,
too. In addition to this, sudden sharp increases in infection and/or death counts might
be attributed to late or irregular reporting and not point towards emerging situation of
concern.
Due to the nature of reporting data we are unable to adjust the incidence and death
rates for demographic features such as age or sex. It is well known that women and
young persons have lower risk to die compared to men and people above 70 years [31].
Our analyses also do not account for seasonality or weather or the geographical location
of the different areas. We also do not consider weighted inequality indices. We use the
equal weighting approach per country because of our interest to assess the quality of the
environment a person lives in and to compare environments. Introducing population
weights would result in diminishing the influence of countries like the small European
states in comparison to France or Germany, or in case of the U.S., or weighting the
situation in states with large metropolitan areas in comparison to states with a more rural
structure. Policy making is in general focused on countries and administrative/political
units. Therefore, all countries/regions contribute equally to the calculation of inequality
indices. We only adjust for the population size to report rates per 100,000 inhabitants
in 7 day periods.
For the interpretation of our results, we have to additionally take into account that
the number of infected persons is different from the number of positively tested persons.
This is addressed by introducing the term naive IFR (nIFR). Furthermore, the number of
positively tested persons depends on the number of tests performed within a population.
Therefore, the numbers used are biased estimates of the true incidences. Unfortunately,
we do not have data on testing strategies that would allow us to adjust the numbers
used in our article toward better estimates. Therefore, the true COVID-19 prevalence,
incidence, and mortality remain uncertain. Rahmandad et al. discuss the impact of
under-reporting across 92 nations on estimation of COVID-19 disease measures [32].
Their estimated cumulative cases and deaths through 7.0 and 1.4 times official reports,

with substantially varying underreporting across the countries.
An important future application of inequality indices could be monitoring inequality
in COVID-19 immunization rates between countries with early immunization activities
(United Kingdom, Israel) and countries of the EU (as data become available).

Conclusion
This paper applies three indices to measure inequality in international SARS-CoV-2
related infection and mortality data: the relative and absolute Gini index (GIrel , GIabs )
as well as the Theil index (TI). These indices are applied to central pandemic indicators:
infection (IR), mortality (MR), and (naive) infection fatality rate (nIFR). TI and GIrel
show a comparable behavior. The GIrel and GIabs behave complementary: Often, the
GIrel mirrors more equality, while absolute inequality as measured by GIabs increases.
For this reason both indices should be reported simultaneously. Following the inequality
indices over time allows a meta-look on very complex dynamics. Our analyses allow the
conclusion that there is no convincing evidence that the U.S. and the EU show clear
differences in specific health equity issues with respect to COVID-19 related mortality
risks. Generally, the public discussion is directed towards the disease activity at a
national or regional level. As it seems, only specialists are aware of the different aspects
of the disease at a larger scale. For this reason we believe that tools are needed to
represent the pandemic state of a nation/region within a broader and easy to understand
framework.
