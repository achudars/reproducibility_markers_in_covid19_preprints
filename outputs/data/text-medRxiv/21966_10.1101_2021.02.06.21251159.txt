Summary
As of January of 2021, the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2, which was first
identified in the United Kingdom (U.K.), has gained a strong foothold across the world. Because
of the sudden and rapid rise of B.1.1.7, we investigated the prevalence and growth dynamics of
this variant in the United States (U.S.), tracking it back to its early emergence and onward local
transmission. We found that the RT-qPCR testing anomaly of S gene target failure (SGTF), first
observed in the U.K., was a reliable proxy for B.1.1.7 detection. We sequenced 212 B.1.1.7
SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected from testing facilities in the U.S. from December 2020 to January
2021. We found that while the fraction of B.1.1.7 among SGTF samples varied by state, detection
of the variant increased at a logistic rate similar to those observed elsewhere, with a doubling rate
of a little over a week and an increased transmission rate of 35-45%. By performing time-aware
Bayesian phylodynamic analyses, we revealed several independent introductions of B.1.1.7 into
the U.S. as early as late November 2020, with onward community transmission enabling the
variant to spread to at least 30 states as of January 2021. Our study shows that the U.S. is on a
similar trajectory as other countries where B.1.1.7 rapidly became the dominant SARS-CoV-2
variant, requiring immediate and decisive action to minimize COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

Introduction
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been concern about novel SARS-CoV-2
variants emerging that are more transmissible. During the third quarter of 2020, the SARS-CoV2 Variant of Concern (VOC) 202012/01 (a.k.a. 501Y.V1; B.1.1.7) lineage carrying the N501Y
mutation emerged and took hold in the UK, followed by several European countries. The N501Y
mutation is also shared with other VOCs first identified in South Africa (501Y.V2; B.1.351) (Tegally
et al., 2020) and Brazil (501Y.V3; P.1) (Faria et al., 2021), but B.1.1.7 has several additional
‘signature’ mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, including deletions at 69-70 and 144, as
well as mutations A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A, and D1118H (Rambaut et al., 2020a).
The earliest sequence of B.1.1.7 was collected on September 20, 2020 in England (GISAID
EPI_ISL_601443), but it has since spread rapidly across the UK, becoming the dominant lineage
within just a few months (Chand et al., 2020; Cyranoski, 2021; ECDC, 2021; Rambaut et al.,
2020a). This lineage is more transmissible, with a growth rate that has been estimated to be 4070% higher than other SARS-CoV-2 lineages in multiple countries, which is hypothesized to be
partly due to the N501Y mutation increasing receptor binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein with ACE2 (Volz et al., 2021). While initially thought to have comparable clinical outcomes
to other SARS-CoV-2 variants, preliminary reports indicate that infection with B.1.1.7 may lead to
~30% higher mortality rates (Iacobucci, 2021). Though the exact origin of the B.1.1.7 variant is
unclear, it was only through the proactive and ongoing large scale SARS-CoV-2 genomic
surveillance program in the U.K. facilitated the initial detection after investigators in South Africa
had observed an association between N501Y and increased transmission (Chand et al., 2020).
Routinely administered RT-qPCR SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests can provide hints to the presence
of viral lineages with sequence-based differences when mutations occur at the test’s target probe
locations. Importantly, the 69-70 deletion, present in B.1.1.7 and other variants, can be
characterized by the failure to detect the S gene in these tests, known as S gene target failure

(SGTF) (Bal et al., 2020). Retrospective analyses from the U.K. show that the proportion of B.1.1.7
in SGTF samples rose from 3% during the week of October 12, 2020 to more than 90% during
the week of November 30, 2020. It has since reached near-fixation across most of the U.K.
(Chand et al., 2021).
Because of the sudden and rapid rise of the B.1.1.7 variant across the world, we sought to
understand the prevalence and growth dynamics of this variant in the U.S., from early emergence
to rapid onward transmission. Surveillance programs typically select a subset of RT-PCR SARSCoV-2 tests for sequencing, and therefore identifying SGTF samples for sequencing provides a
built-in prioritization method to enrich for detection of B.1.1.7. In this study we describe the
introduction and early spread of B.1.1.7 in the U.S., based on historical SGTF rates in RT-PCR
SARS-CoV-2 tests and a nationwide SGTF viral sequencing program. We find that B.1.1.7 arrived
in the U.S. towards the end of November, 2020 and as of January, 2021 it has since spread to at
least 30 U.S. states. Importantly, we find that the B.1.1.7 variant is 35-45% more transmissible
across the country, doubling in relative frequency about every week and a half. These findings
show that B.1.1.7 will likely become the dominant variant in many U.S. states by March, 2021,
leading to further surges of COVID-19 in the country, unless urgent mitigation efforts are
immediately implemented.

Results
The proportion of SGTF samples is rapidly increasing in the U.S.
We examined the prevalence of SGTF in all SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from across the U.S.
tested at Helix facilities since July 2020 (~0.5 million samples; Figure 1A). The Helix® COVID-19
Test calls positive samples when at least two of three targets (N, Orf1ab, and S) are detected
using the Thermo Fisher TaqPath™ assay. We only considered samples to be SGTF if they were
positive for both N and Orf1ab, and negative for S. We restricted our analyses to positive samples
with Cq<27 for the N gene based on previous reports that single target failures were more frequent
at higher Cq (Bal et al., 2020; Kara Steel And, 2021). We began to observe consistent, low
frequency SGTF in early October 2020, with 0.2% of daily SARS-CoV-2-positive tests exhibiting
this pattern during the week of October 18, 2020, followed by a steady increase (Supplemental
Figure S1). We found that during the month of January 2021, the nationwide proportion of SGTF
increased from an average of 0.8% in the first week to 4.2% in the last week (Supplemental
Figure S1). As described in more detail below, the proportion of B.1.1.7 cases reached 3.6% in
the U.S. by the last week of January, 2021 (Figure 1B, C).
To investigate regional differences across the U.S., we examined the nationwide distribution of
SGTF. By grouping our samples based on patient state of residence, we observed SGTF in 22
out of 53 U.S. States and territories during January 2021, several of which had SGTF frequencies
consistently above 1% (Supplemental Figure S1). When restricting our analysis to assess U.S.
states with more than 500 positive tests in January 2021, we observed that the fraction of SGTF
varies significantly across the nation (Supplemental Figure S1). A caveat to this analysis is that
our testing footprint does not evenly cover the U.S. (Figure 1A), hence SGTF may currently be
undetected in several states.

proportion of B.1.1.7 samples was estimated using: (Observed B.1.1.7 sequences/Sequenced
SGTF samples) * (Positive tests with SGTF/Total positive tests). Due to the lag in sequencing,
the average proportion of B.1.1.7 sequences in sequenced samples with SGTF from the last five
days (January 13-18) was used to infer the proportion of B.1.1.7 cases in total positive tests for
the January 19-30 time period between. The black line shows the 5-day rolling average of the
estimated proportion of B.1.1.7 in total positives. (C) Logistic growth curves fit to the rolling
average of the estimated proportion of B.1.1.7 in total positives for the U.S., Florida and California.
The predicted time when the estimated proportion of B.1.1.7 cases crosses 0.5 is indicated in red.

Identification of B.1.1.7 using SARS-CoV-2 sequencing
Since SGTF only tracks the presence of the 69-70 deletion in the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene, it is
not specific to B.1.1.7 (Washington et al., 2020). To investigate the proportion of B.1.1.7 in our
SGTF samples, we sequenced all SGTF samples from December, 2020 through January, 2021.

We found that of the 460 SGTF samples we successfully sequenced, 209 (45%) were from the
B.1.1.7 variant (insert; Figure 2A and Supplemental Table S1), distributed across ten U.S. states
(insert; Figure 2A). In addition to the SGTF samples, we also sequenced three B.1.1.7 genomes
that were detected as part of random SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in California
(Supplemental Table S1). Of the 212 B.1.1.7 sequences, 96 came from California and 87 Florida
(insert; Figure 2A).
We found that all the SARS-CoV-2 variant genomes from the U.S. contained all the B.1.1.7
‘signature’ mutations, including del69-70, del144, N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I, S982A,
and D1118H (Rambaut et al., 2020a). None of our B.1.1.7 sequences contained any of the key
mutations identified in the B.1.351 and P.1 variants, such as L18F, K417N/T, or E484K (Faria et
al., 2021; Tegally et al., 2020), with the latter recently having been identified in B.1.1.7 lineages
in the U.K. (Public Health England, 2020). We did, however, observe an additional
nonsynonymous mutation, K1191N, in the majority of B.1.1.7 genomes from Florida, and one
instance of Q493K, which has been implicated in immune escape (Starr et al., 2021).
In addition to the ten states with evidence of B.1.1.7 transmission identified in this study, we note
that additional B.1.1.7 sequences have been reported from other testing labs, with 33 of 53 U.S.
states and territories reporting to the CDC at least one case to date (CDC, 2021).

B.1.1.7 has an increased growth rate in the U.S. compared to non-B.1.1.7
lineages
To investigate the dynamics of B.1.1.7 in the U.S., we estimated the proportion of the variant out
of total positive tests by multiplying the proportion of B.1.1.7 in all sequenced SGTF cases by the
proportion of SGTF in all positive tests and taking the 5-day rolling average until January 18th.
Given the lag of sequencing, we used the average proportion of B.1.1.7 in all sequenced SGTF
cases from January 13 to January 18 to estimate the proportion of the variant out of total tests
from January 18 to January 20. We found that the proportion of B.1.1.7 in our SGTF samples
grew to a nationwide average of ~90% in the middle of January, 2021, although with substantial
variance across the country, ranging from ~95% in California to ~70% in Florida (Supplemental
Figure S2).
Following the same methodology to estimate the proportion of B.1.1.7 in the population, we found
that by the last week of January 2021, B.1.1.7 made up an average of ~2.1% COVID-19 cases in
the U.S., with ~2.0% of all cases in California and ~4.5% of all cases in Florida caused by B.1.1.7
(Figure 1B). To investigate the growth rate of B.1.1.7 in the U.S. compared to non-B.1.1.7
lineages, we fitted a logistic growth model to our rolling 5-day average of estimated B.1.1.7 cases.
We determined that B.1.1.7 has a logistic growth rate of 0.07 in the U.S. (Figure 1C), which
translates to an increased transmissibility of 35-46% in the U.S., with rates in California of 2937% and 38-49% in Florida (Figure 1C). Using a serial interval of 5 - 6.5 days (Volz et al., 2021),
we estimated the doubling time of B.1.1.7 to be 9.8 days in the U.S., 12.2 days in California, and
9.1 days in Florida (Figure 1C).

B.1.1.7 was introduced into the U.S. multiple times in November, 2020
To investigate the timing and number of introductions that led to the emergence of B.1.1.7 in the
U.S., we combined our 212 B.1.1.7 genomes with a representative sampling of 292 additional
sequences from outside the U.S. We used this dataset to reconstruct a Bayesian time-resolved
phylogeny using BEAST (Suchard et al., 2018). We found that the majority of B.1.1.7 sequences
from the U.S. cluster into two main clades (Figure 2A) with independent introductions into
California (CA1; Figure 2A) and Florida (FL; Figure 2A).
In addition to these major clades, we also identified six smaller clades representing at least eight
independent introductions (Figure 2A), as well as nineteen singletons showing additional
introductions (Figure 2A) across the U.S. states we surveyed (Figure 2B). The “GA” clade
(Figure 2A) contains three sequences and represents an independent introduction into Georgia.
Clade “Southeast” (Figure 2A) contains two sequences from Georgia and one from Florida and
represents an independent introduction into the Southeastern U.S. The “CA2” clade was made
up of two sequences from California and constituted a separate introduction (Figure 2A), although
these samples came from individuals with recent travel history to the U.K.
We found that the earliest timing of introductions into the U.S. was represented by the “CA1”
clade, which had a median time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA; which depicts the
likely start of sustained local transmission in California (Grubaugh et al., 2019a)) of November 27,
2020 (95% highest posterior probability (HPD): [November 14 - December 8]), followed by “FL”
with a median TMRCA of November 29, 2020 (95% HPD: [November 17 - December 8]) (Figure
2C). Clade “GA” had a median TMRCA of December 31, 2020 (95% HPD: [December 22 January 2]). We found that the other U.S. clades had median TMRCAs in December, 2020 and
January, 2021, suggesting repeated introductions of B.1.1.7 into the U.S. from international
locations from November, 2020 through present time.

B.1.1.7 has likely been spreading between U.S. states since late 2020
In addition to the main B.1.1.7 clades that contained sequences primarily from individual states,
including “CA1”, “CA2”, “FL”, and “GA”, we found that clades “Mixed-1”, “Mixed-2”, “Mixed-3”, and
“Southeast” were diverse with respect to geographic sampling, containing SARS-CoV-2 genomes
from across multiple U.S. states (Figure 2A). These findings indicate that B.1.1.7 has been
spreading locally between different U.S. states (Figure 2D), likely since at least December, 2020
based on our TMRCA estimates (Figure 2A).
Undersampling and bias in our B.1.1.7 sequencing make it unfeasible to estimate directionality
and connectedness across the U.S., but the clustering of B.1.1.7 sequences into mixed clades
suggest movement of the virus between Florida and Georgia, Florida and Minnesota, Florida and
Michigan, and between the Southeastern states of Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina (Figure
2D).

Discussion
The B.1.1.7 variant established itself as the dominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage in the U.K. within a
couple of months after its detection (Bal et al., 2020; Chand et al., 2020). Since then, the variant
has been increasingly observed across many European countries, including Portugal and Ireland,
which, like the U.K., observed devastating waves of COVID-19 after B.1.1.7 became dominant
(ECDC, 2021). In this study, we show that B.1.1.7 is currently at a relatively low frequency in the

U.S., but our estimates show that its growth rate is at least 35-45% increased and doubling every
week and a half. These findings are consistent with those from other countries (Volz et al., 2021),
and given the current trajectory of B.1.1.7 in the U.S., it is almost certainly destined to become
the dominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage by March, 2021 across many U.S. states, which is consistent
with modeling analyses from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Galloway et
al., 2021). However, obtaining accurate estimates of the prevalence of B.1.1.7 across the country
is complicated by uneven and biased sampling, combined with a lack of a national SARS-CoV-2
genomics surveillance program, like those implemented in the U.K., Denmark, Australia, New
Zealand, among other places. In the current study, we obtain relatively robust estimates from
California and Florida, but our analyses outside these places are limited.
Our phylogenetic analyses indicate that there have been multiple introductions of B.1.1.7 into the
U.S., with the earliest dating back to the end of November, 2020. These analyses revealed large
clades of closely related SARS-CoV-2 lineages clustering within individual states, as well as
national spread indicated by several smaller clades defined by mixtures of samples from patients
who reside in different U.S. states. These findings are consistent with community transmission
following several of these introductions, including spread across U.S. states However, unresolved
polytomies of sequences belonging to different regions nationally and internationally at several
basal nodes in our phylogenies, mean that we are unable to fully resolve directionality and likely
origins for the U.S. sequences (Grubaugh et al., 2019a). However, our TMRCA estimates coincide
with increased periods of travel, where the U.S. Transportation Security Administration reported
over one million travelers crossing checkpoints for several days during the peak Thanksgiving
season (November 20-29, 2020) and for twelve of eighteen days surrounding the Christmas and
New Year’s holidays (December 18, 2020 to January 4, 2021) (TSA, 2021), providing a likely
explanation for how B.1.1.7 may have been introduced via international travel and spread across
the U.S. via domestic travel.
In addition to well-supported local clades in California, Florida, and Georgia from our phylogenetic
analyses, many of the initial B.1.1.7 cases in the U.S. did not report recent international travel
prior to infection (Davis, 2020; Romo, 2020). These findings suggest that significant community
transmission of the B.1.1.7 variant is already ongoing across the U.S., which is likely fueled by its
increased growth rate and transmissibility of B.1.1.7. We found the growth rates in California (~6%
/ day) to be slightly lower than those in Florida (~8% / day). This difference may be due to
differences in statewide or regional social distancing protocols or mobility patterns, population
density, biases in sampling and/or demographics, or competition from other SARS-CoV-2
variants, like the B.1.429 variant recently described in California (CDPH, 2021). The nationwide
growth rate of ~7% / day is a little lower than those observed in Portugal (10% / day (Borges,
2021)), Denmark (10.3% / day (Statens Serums Institute)) and the United Kingdom (10.4% / day
(Davies et al., 2020)). The reason for the slightly lower growth rate of B.1.1.7 in the U.S. compared
to European countries require further investigation, but may be down to the relative sparsity of
the current dataset, the lack of strong mitigation efforts in this country, or competition from other
more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants.
Our study shows that although SGTF is not yet a universal proxy for the B.1.1.7 variant in the
U.S., the increased growth rate of B.1.1.7 compared to other SGTF variants (Volz et al., 2021)

will likely lead to B.1.1.7 overtaking other SGTF variants in a matter of weeks. This will allow the
simple SGTF testing anomaly to be used to monitor the spread of B.1.1.7 in the U.S. in the
absence of nationwide genomic surveillance.
While B.1.1.7 is of current interest given the concerns regarding increased transmission
dynamics, the results here reinforce the need for ongoing SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance to
monitor the dynamics of B.1.1.7 and other emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, including those yet to
be discovered. Because laboratories in the U.S. are only sequencing a small subset of SARSCoV-2 samples, the true sequence diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in this country is still unknown. The
more established surveillance programs in other countries have provided important warnings
about variants of concern that can impact the U.S., with B.1.1.7 representing only one variant that
demonstrates the capacity for exponential growth. As viral surveillance efforts increase in the
U.S., we will no doubt find additional SARS-CoV-2 variants, some at high prevalence and others
with increased fitness. Only with consistent, unbiased sequencing at scale that includes all
geographic and demographic populations including those often underrepresented, together with
continued international scientific collaborations and open data sharing, will we be able to
accurately assess and follow new variants that emerge during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given
that the SARS-CoV-2 VOCs B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 are still at relatively low frequency in the
U.S., there is still time to implement the necessary surveillance programs and mitigation efforts in
the weeks to come. Unless decisive and immediate public health action is taken, the increased
transmission rate of these lineages and resultant higher effective reproduction number of SARSCoV-2 will likely have devastating consequences to COVID-19 mortality and morbidity in the U.S.

Methods
Ethical statement
Helix data analyzed and presented here were obtained through IRB protocol WIRB#20203438,
which grants a waiver of consent for a limited dataset for the purposes of public health under
section 164.512(b) of the Privacy Rule (45 CFR § 164.512(b)). This work was also evaluated and
approved by the Institutional Review Board at The Scripps Research Institute under IRB protocol
IRB-15-6664. The work was conducted under a waiver of consent and received a non-human
subjects research designation (category 4 exemption) because this research was performed with
remnant clinical diagnostic specimens. All samples were de-identified before receipt by the study
investigators.

Helix COVID-19 Test Data
The Helix COVID-19 Test (EUA 201636) was run on specimens collected across the US, and
results were obtained as part of our standard test processing workflow using specimens from
anterior nares swabs. The Helix COVID-19 Test is based on the Thermo Fisher TaqPath™
COVID-19 Combo Kit, which targets three SARS-CoV-2 viral regions (N gene, S gene, and
ORF1ab). Since samples are deidentified prior to analysis, and some individuals may test more
than once, there may be some duplicate individuals in the analyses that follow that could cause
deviation from the true population fraction. We attempted to de-duplicate the samples by removing
those with identical age+sex+ethnicity+zipcode+clade, which only revealed three sets of two
B.1.1.7 samples. Test results from positive cases, together with a limited amount of metadata
(including sample collection date, state, and RT-qPCR Cq values for all gene targets), were used
to build the research database used here. The data used in this paper is available in Supplemental
Table S3. Ongoing summary level data are viewable at https://www.helix.com/covid19db.

SGTF and B.1.1.7 quantitative analysis
Following conservative approaches from prior studies ((Bal et al., 2020; Kara Steel And, 2021),
we filtered our dataset for positive samples with strong amplification of the N gene (Cq < 27).
SGTF was annotated to samples with no S gene detected (Cq = Null). While this approach
removed true positive results, and likely some SGTF samples, the variable behavior of the assay
at longer cycle times warrants strict filtering for analysis. We applied the Cq(N gene) < 27 filter to
all positive samples prior to analysis. Date of sample collection from each patient’s Test
Requisition Form was used as the sample date for all analyses. Sequenced samples reflect those
collected from December 17, 2020 through January 18, 2021.
Since we enriched for B.1.1.7 by selecting SGTF samples for sequencing, proportion of B.1.1.7
in total positive tests were inferred using,

.

A logistic growth model was fit to the B.1.1.7 population prevalence over time using the nls()
function in R. Following Voltz et al (Volz et al., 2021), increased transmissibility was estimated
using a serial interval of 5 - 6.5 days using,

Helix/Illumina SARS-CoV-2 sequencing and consensus sequence generation
Residual samples remaining after reporting of the SARS-CoV-2 tests were selected for
sequencing based on SGTF status and Cq(N gene) < 27 (note some early samples were selected
up to Cq=35, though most were unable to produce usable sequence). Beginning in late December
2020, SGTF residual samples were saved for sequencing within 3 days of SARS-CoV-2 testing
at Helix.
All samples were prepped and sequenced following the Illumina CovidSeq Test Instructions for
Use (1000000128490 v01). RNA was extracted from 400 µl of patient sample using the QuickDNA/RNA Viral MagBead kit (Zymo Research, # R2141) but was not treated with Proteinase K.
During the Amplify cDNA step, the annealing temperature was reduced from 65°C to 63°C.
Samples were sequenced using the NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing system S4 flow cell, which
included the NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System S4 Reagent Kit v1.5 (35 cycles) (Illumina, #
20044417) and the NovaSeq Xp 4-Lane Kit v1.5 (Illumina, # 20042337).
The NovaSeq flow cell output was further processed through the Illumina DRAGEN COVIDSeq
Test Pipeline v1.3.0.28 to perform variant and consensus sequence generation for each sample.
First flowcell output was demultiplexed into per-sample FASTQ sequences. Each sequence was
then run through a DRAGEN kmer-based alignment algorithm. This algorithm utilized a kmer
reference database to match kmers from the sequencing read to kmers from the SARS-CoV-2
reference genome (NCBI Accession NC_045512.2). To create the kmer reference list, the SARSCoV-2 reference genome was split into 32 nucleotide (nt) kmers, and any kmers containing crossreactivity were removed. To measure cross-reactivity, the kmer reference list incorporated the
NCBI database of 100,000 genomes for human and animal pathogens in addition to the SARSCoV-2 reference. Bat and pangolin viruses were excluded because of their similarity to the SARSCoV-2 genome. Each of the reference kmers was labeled with a corresponding amplicon from
either SARS-CoV-2 or external controls. If an amplicon contained at least 150 matches to SARSCoV-2 reference kmers, the amplicon was considered detected. Variant calling and consensus
sequence generation was performed for every sample with at least 90 SARS-CoV-2 virus
amplicon targets.
Variant calling was performed by first aligning reads to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome with
the DRAGEN alignment module, then processing the aligned reads with the DRAGEN sort and
duplicate removal modules and finally calling variants using the DRAGEN somatic “tumor-only”
variant caller configured for haploid genomes. To generate a consensus sequence in FASTA
format, detected sequence variants from the VCF output meeting the following criteria were

applied to the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence: a “PASS” entry in the FILTER column, the
variant allele frequency ≥0.5, and the total filtered depth >10. Regions of sequence with coverage
<10 were hard masked with N’s in the consensus sequence.

Andersen lab at Scripps Research SARS-CoV-2 sequencing and consensus
sequence generation
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was extracted from patient samples using either the MagMAX Viral/Pathogen
II Nucleic Acid Isolation kit (Thermofisher, #A48383) or the Omega BioTek MagBind Viral
DNA/RNA Kit (Omega Biotek, #M6246-03) according to manufacturers’ instructions. The
extracted SARS-CoV-2 RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript IV VILO (ThermoFisher,
#11756500). The virus cDNA was amplified in two multiplexed PCR reactions using ARTIC
Network n-CoV-19 V3 primers and Q5 DNA High-Fidelity Master Mix (New England BioLabs,
#M0492L) to generate tiled PCR amplicons. Libraries were then prepared for sequencing on
Illumina platforms using Nextera XT (Illumina, #FC-131-1096). These libraries were sequenced
on either Illumina NextSeq with a 500/550 Mid Output Kit v2.5 (Illumina, #20024908) or Illumina
NovaSeq 6000 with an SP Reagent Kit v1.5 (Ilumina, #20028400) as 2x150 paired end reads
(300 cycles). A subset of amplicon libraries were prepared for sequencing on the Nanopore
MinION using KAPA HyperPrep kit (Roche, 07962363001) for end-repair and Ligation
Sequencing Kit for adapter ligation (Oxford Nanopore, #SQK-LSK109). These libraries were
individually sequenced on MinION R9 flow cells.
Consensus sequences from nanopore data were assembled using the arctic-ncov2019 pipeline
(https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019). Consensus sequences from Illumina data were
assembled using an inhouse Snakemake (Köster and Rahmann, 2012) pipeline with bwa-mem
(Li, 2013) and iVar v1.2.2 (Grubaugh et al., 2019b).

Chiu lab at UCSF SARS-CoV-2 sequencing and consensus sequence generation
Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples were prepared using 100 L of primary sample mixed with
100L DNA/RNA shield (Zymo Research, #R1100-250). The 1:1 sample mixture was then
extracted using the Omega BioTek MagBind Viral DNA/RNA Kit (Omega Biotek, # M6246-03) on
KingFisherTM Flex Purification System with a 96 deep well head (ThermoFisher, 5400630).
Extracted RNA was reverse transcribed to complementary DNA and tiling multiplexed amplicon
PCR was performed using SARS-CoV-2 primers according to a published protocol (Quick et al.,
2017) and reagents from the Protoscript First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England Biolabs,
#E6560L) and the Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase Kit (New England Biolabs,
#M0493L). Amplicons were ligated with adapters and incorporated with barcodes using NEBNext
Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs, # E7645L). Libraries were
barcoded using NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (96 unique dual-index primer pairs) (New
England Biolabs, # E6440L). Amplicon libraries were then sequenced on either Illumina MiSeq
or Novaseq 6000 as 2x150 paired-end reads (300 cycles) with the MiSeq Reagent Kit V2
(Illumina, # MS-102-2002) or the NovaSeq 6000 Sequencing System S4 Reagent Kit v1.5
(Illumina, # 20028312), respectively.
Genome assembly of viral reads and variant calling were performed using an in-house automated
bioinformatics pipeline as previously described (Deng et al., 2020).

Phylogenetic analyses
Consensus FASTA for each sample was used as input to NextClade v0.12.0 (Hadfield et al.,
2018) and Pangolin v2.0 (O’Toole et al., 2021) to label phylogenetic clades and lineages based
on (Rambaut et al., 2020b), respectively. Samples identified as B.1.1.7 were selected for further
phylogenetic analysis.
We downloaded all 26,064 sequences from the B.1.1.7 lineage and 21,032 sequences from the
B.1.1 lineage, which forms the immediate outgroup of the B.1.1.7 lineage, from GISAID as of
January 24, 2021. We combined this with our dataset of 212 B.1.1.7 sequences sampled in the
U.S. and downsampled the combined dataset to 4,158 sequences based on collection date and
country. (See Supplemental Table S2 for GISAID acknowledgements.) We constructed a
maximum-likelihood tree using this dataset under a HKY nucleotide substitution model
implemented in iqtree2 (Minh et al., 2020). Using this phylogeny, we selected 504 sequences to
retain, including all the sequences in our dataset (n=212) and a selection of global sequences to
represent global diversity of the B.1.1.7 lineage (n=291 and NC_045512 as an outgroup root). We
estimated the time-resolved phylogeny using a HKY nucleotide substitution model with discretegamma distributed rate variation under an uncorrelated relaxed clock model implemented in
BEASTv1.10.5pre (Suchard et al., 2018). We used a relatively uninformative conditional reference
prior on the overall clock rate (Ferreira and Suchard, 2008), an exponentially growing population
prior over the unknown tree and the BEAGLE library to improve computational performance
(Ayres et al., 2019). We let the analysis run for 100 million steps and discarded the first 10 million
as burn-in. The effective sample size of all scientifically relevant parameters was above 200. The
phylogenetic tree was visualized using baltic (https://github.com/evogytis/baltic). The BEAST
XML and code to process the analysis are available at https://github.com/andersenlab/paper_2021_early-b117-usa.
