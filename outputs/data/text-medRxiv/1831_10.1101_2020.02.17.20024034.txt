Introduction
A novel coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan city, Hubei Province on December 1,
2019[1-2]. On February 11, 2020, WHO Director-General announced that the novel
coronavirus was officially named “COVID-19(Corona Virus Disease 2019)”, and
meanwhile, the international committee for the classification of viruses named
“SARS-CoV-2(Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2)”[3], the Chinese
Health and Health Commission temporarily named novel coronavirus-infected
pneumonia as novel coronavirus pneumonia, abbreviated as“NCP”[4]. The NCP has
been included in the B class infectious diseases stipulated in the law of the People's
Republic of China on the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, and adopted
measures for the prevention and control of Class A infectious diseases. According to
the "Diagnosis and treatment of pneumonia for novel coronavirus infection"
(version1-7) , released by the Chinese health commission[5], The incubation period is
1~14 days, generally 3~7 days. Fever, fatigue, dry cough as the main
performance[6].There is clear the route of transmission of respiratory droplet and
contact transmission[7], aerosol and the digestive tract of transmission is unclear, the
general population susceptibility, the novel coronavirus is sensitive to ultraviolet light
and heat, most disinfectants can effectively killed virus, but chlorine has not
effectively inactivated virus, should avoid to use hand disinfectant containing chlorine
has set. At present, The diagnosed patients were treated with antiviral therapy, serum
of the recovered patients, blood purification therapy, immunotherapy, traditional
Chinese medicine therapy and a series of symptomatic treatments for each individual.
Of course, there are no targeted treatment drugs[8-9]. Because NCP is a new
infectious disease, human beings know little about the virus host, species,
characteristics of the virus and its epidemiology etc. Therefore, the occurrence,
epidemiology and prevention effect of the NCP were analyzed and discussed. It
provides a scientific basis for the prevention and treatment of the NCP.
Data and methods
The data are from the official website of China Health and Health Committee and

Hubei Health and Health Committee. From December 1, 2019 to March 4,
2020[10-11]. The standard of diagnosis and treatment for novel coronavirus
pneumonia released by the Chinese health commission(version1-7).
The turning point of the epidemic, which is my new creation. the sum of the number
of cured patients and the number of dead patients on that day is greater than the
number of newly confirmed patients on that day, which is the turning point of the
disease. In other words, when the ratio is greater than 1, the epidemic gradually
disappears, and when the ratio is less than 1, the epidemic will be continuous.
WPS software was used to analyze and summarize; GraphPad Prism 6 software was
used for mapping.
Results
1. Situation of NCP in China mainland
The first case of NCP was reported in Wuhan city of Hubei Province on December 1,
2019. From December 1, 2019 to March 4, 2020, a total of 80,409 cases of NCP were
confirmed in China mainland, a total of 67,466 cases were confirmed in Hubei
Province, a total of 49,671 cases were confirmed in Wuhan city. It can be seen from
Figure 1.A that the cases of the cumulative infection with NCP in China mainland.
After treatment, most of the patients have recovered, it can be seen from Figure 1.B
that the cases of post-treatment infection with NCP in China mainland. From
December 1, 2019 to March 4, 2020, the cumulative deaths with NCP were 3,012
cases, the mortality were 3.75% (3012/80,409). The cumulative cured with NCP were
52045 cases so far, and most of them will be recover.

diagnosed with NCP in Guangzhou, Zhejiang, Henan and Hunan(A); After control
and treatment，Shandong, Guangzhou, Sichuan and Beijing had residual infections of
more than 100 people, while other provinces had fewer than 100 or none (B).
It can be seen from Figure 2 that the number of suspected NCP in China mainland
increased by a leap on January 26, 2020. On February 5, 2020, the number of
suspected confirmed cases in China mainland reached 5,328. And then it goes down.
On February 4, 2020, the number of confirmed cases of NCP in China mainland
reached 3887, and since then, the confirmed cases have gradually declined. On
February 12, 2020, the number of confirmed cases of NCP in China mainland has
exploded to 15152. Since then, the number of newly confirmed cases of NCP in China
mainland is continuous decline. From February 3, 2020, the number of newly
confirmed cases of NCP is continuous decline in China mainland except Hubei
Province, This shows that the control of the transmission of NCP has achieved.
Judged from the number of confirmed cases of NCP, controlling the outbreak in China
mainland is to control the epidemic in Hubei province, and the key to controlling the
outbreak in Hubei province is to control the epidemic in Wuhan city. Eventually,
trends suggest that the epidemic will be eliminated.

Figure 2, Dynamic chart of suspected and confirmed cases of NCP. On 26
January,2020 , suspected cases of NCP jumped to 3,806; And on 12 February 2020,
confirmed cases of NCP exploded to 15,152; On 4 Mar 2020, the number of suspected
and confirmed cases is 143 and 139 respectively in China mainland.
2. Turning point of the epidemic
The time of the turning point can be seen from figure 4. February 12, 2020 was a
turning point of the epidemic in the China mainland except Hubei province, February
18, 2020 was a turning point of the epidemic in the China mainland, and February 19,
2020 was a turning point of the epidemic in Hubei province. From that day on, the
total number of cured and dead patients was greater than the number of new patients.

Figure 3, Turning point of the epidemic in China mainland. The date of turning point
is February 12 in China mainland except Hubei province; The date of turning point is
February 18 in China mainland. The date of turning point is February 19 in Hubei
province.
3.Epidemic spread index and extinction index
The spread index refers to the ratio of the number of newly confirmed cases on the
day to the number of existing cases on the previous day. This index equal to 0, which
means that the epidemic does not spread and there are no new cases; The smaller the
spread index, the slower the spread of the epidemic; the larger the spread index, the
faster the spread of the epidemic. From the Figure 4.A, It can be seen that the spread
index of the NCP in China mainland has gradually decreased since January 27, 2020,
indicating that the spread rate of the NCP is slowing down. It can be seen the detain
from the Figure 4.A.B.C.
The extinction index is the ratio of the number of people cured and death that day to

the number of existing cases the previous days. When the extinction index is larger,
the epidemic dies faster. When the extinction index is greater than spread index, the
epidemic gradually disappears; And when the extinction index is less than spread
index; the epidemic will be go on for some time. The ratio of the extinction index to
the extinction index is equal to the turning point. The detain can be seen from
figure4.A.B.C.

However, as can be seen from figure A, the extinction index of China mainland is still
low. At the same time, it can be seen from figure B that in mainland China except
Hubei province, from February 12, 2020, the extinction index is greater than 1,
indicating the turning point of the NCP.
Discussion
According to the“Epidemic update and risk assessment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus”
released by the Chinese center for disease control and prevention on January 28,
2020[12], the 2019 novel coronavirus is currently believed to be from wild animals,
but the details are unclear. South China agricultural university, found beta coronavirus
in the pangolin, it is need to further research whether it belong to novel coronavirus or
not. South China seafood wholesale market is the main source of infection in Wuhan
city of Hubei province. The early cases of NCP were mainly imported infections
directly or indirectly from Wuhan[13]. According to the analysis of the current
infection situation, Hubei province, is a NCP infections most populous province,
followed by Guangzhou province and Zhejiang province, which is related to the
economic development and intensive personnel exchanges; Henan province and
Hunan provinces also had higher cases of NCP, which is related to neighboring of
Hubei province. On January 26, 2020, the suspected cases of the NCP showed a rapid
increase. According to the information that the general incubation period of the
disease is 3-7 days and the diagnosis needs 2 days, the rapid increase of the suspected
cases may be related to the banquet held by the community of Baibuting community
in Wuhan city on January 18, 2020. On February 4, 2020, the confirmed cases of NCP
has reached 38872. On February ,2020, the suspected cases of NCP has reached 5328.
since then, suspected cases and confirmed cases were gradual decline, It may be
related to the traffic control in Wuhan, as well as the first-level response to major
public health emergencies and relevant control measures launched by several
provinces on January 23, 2020, But during the Spring Festival, a time of traditional
Chinese holiday, more than 10 million people in the city of Wuhan, the source of the
disease, have made it difficult to control the disease because of the movement of

people. The gold standard for diagnosing pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus
infection is nucleic acid detection[5]. However, the novel coronavirus mainly infects
the lower respiratory tract and is difficult to sample. At same time, the kit has high
specificity, low sensitivity and long period, which makes difficult to timely diagnosis.
After the recommendation of related experts, patients with imaging characteristics of
NCP were considered as the standard of clinical diagnosis in Hubei province. This is
also one of the important reasons for the explosive increase in the confirmed cases in
Hubei on February 12,2020. those patients who had negative nucleic acid test in the
early stage, but had CT image features of the NCP[5,14]. After that, screening and
diagnosis of novel coronaviruses have been accelerated.
The Chinese government took a series of effective measures, including extending
holidays, stopping large gatherings and events, implementing traffic control and grid
management, to prevent the further spread of the disease. With the establishment of
Huoshenshan Hospital, Leishenshan Hospital and Cabin Hospital, designated hotels
were set up to isolate suspected cases of the NCP, and Doctors and nurses from all
over the country retrograde to Hubei province to diagnose and treat the patients.The
number of people cured of the NCP and the cure rate increased gradually. The number
of deaths and mortality of NCP decreased day by day. The reported case mortality of
the NCP is lower than that of SARS and MERS [15-16], and the death cases were
mainly middle-aged and elderly[1]. The basic reproduction number(R0) is an index
that reflects the ability of the virus to transmit[17].The basic reproduction number(R0)
is defined as the number of second-generation cases that can be infected under ideal
conditions when a case enters a susceptible population. On January 23, 2020, the
WHO estimated that the basic reproduction number of the novel coronavirus was
1.4-2.5[18]. The infectious power of the novel coronavirus was lower than that of
SARS and MERS [19-22].
As for the "turning point" of the NCP, The ratio of the number of patients cured and
the number of patients who died that day to the number of newly diagnosed patients
that day is more sensitive.This is a good indicator of turning points.This indicator
relates to the lethality and transmissibility of the virus, as well as to the use of

artificial blockade and treatment. It's also equal to the ratio of the extinction index to
the spread index. The spread index reflects the ability of the epidemic to spread, and
the spread index of the novel coronavirus is not high. Beginning on January 27, 2020,
the spread index gradually decreased in China mainland. To some extent, the turning
point in controlling the spread of NCP appears, but the onset of the novel coronavirus
has a confidentiality and the novel coronavirus can also be infected during incubation
period, at the same time, many people return back to work after the Spring Festival
and the cumulative cases of NCP is still more, All these factors lead to that the NCP
was exist for a period of time. Extinction index reflects the extinction rate of the
disease. Because there is no specific drug against the NCP and the course is long and
the cumulative number of infections is large. At last, the turning point of the epidemic
appeared in China mainland since February 18, 2020; The spread index of NCP
gradually decreases and the extinction index gradually increases. After the turning
point, the extinction index is greater than the spread index, indicating that the NCP is
under control and eliminate in the end in China mainland.
Recently, novel coronavirus outbreaks occurred in other parts of the world. We hope
those countries in the world can help each other, learn from each other. From the point
of view of epidemic,We should work in three aspects: controlling the source of
infection, cutting off the route of transmission, and preventing susceptible people, and
the novel coronavirus will soon be eliminated in the world. At last, special thanks to
all individuals and countries for their unselfish attention and assistance for China.
