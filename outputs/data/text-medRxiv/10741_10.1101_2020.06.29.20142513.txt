Abstract
A novel coronavirus causing the severe and fatal respiratory syndrome was identified in China, is
now producing outbreaks in more than two hundred countries around the world, and became
pandemic by the time. In this article, a modified version of the well known mathematical
epidemic model Susceptible (S)- Infected (I)- Recovered (R) is used to analyze the epidemic's
course of COVID-19 in eight different countries of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC). To achieve this goal, the parameters of the SIR model are identified by
using publicly available data for the corresponding countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan,
India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Based on the prediction model we estimated
the epidemic trend of COVID-19 outbreak in SAARC countries for 20 days, 90 days, and 180
days respectively. An SML (short-mid-long) term prediction model has been designed to
understand the early dynamics of COVID-19 Epidemic in the south-east Asian region. The
maximum and minimum basic reproduction number (R0 = 1.33 and 1.07) for SAARC countries
are predicted to be in Pakistan and Bhutan. We equate simulation results with real data in the
SAARC countries on the COVID-19 outbreak, and model potential countermeasure
implementation scenarios. Our results should provide policymakers with a method for evaluating
the impacts of possible interventions, including lockdown and social distancing, as well as
testing and contact tracking.

1. Introduction
A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), called COVID-19, caused an outbreak in the city of
Wuhan, Hubei Province, China that is linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market 1, 2 in late
December 2019. Till now, more than 200 countries around the world have been infected by a
novel coronavirus. As of May 30, 2020, according to the World Health Organization (WHO),
globally 5817385 confirmed cases have reported with a death count of 3627053. Among them,
the south-east Asia region has confirmed 4.2% of cases while the case fatality ratio is 2.86%.

The very first COVID-19 patient was treated for being coronavirus positive in Wuhan, China, at
the beginning of December 2019. In the south-east Asia region, the very first coronavirus
infected patient was detected in Pakistan on February 26, 20204. On 30 January 30, 2020, WHO
officially declared this outbreak of COVID-19 as global pandemic5. To mitigate the spread of
COVID-19, the affected countries of the world have taken various measures, including citywide
lockdown, social distancing, traffic halt, community management, and information on health
education knowledge. More importantly, the outbreak of COVID-19 possessed a massive threat
to global health and economics all over the world. One of the significant feature of novel
coronavirus unlike other infectious diseases like SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome),
and MERS (Middle East Respesoritory Syndrom), it causes asymptomatic infections (symptoms
are very mild)6,7, 8. In this circumstances, the rate of transmission among a large number of
people can increase within no time. According to the latest World Health Organization survey,
only 87.9% of COVID-19 patients have a fever, and 67.7% have dry cough9. Therefore, this is
highly crucial to estimate the intensity of the COVID-19 epidemic and predict the time course,
peak time, total duration, and so on. Our study focuses on the COVID-19 case prediction using a
modified SIR model (M-SIR) in the countries of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC). SAARC is considered as an intergovernmental organization and
geopolitical union of states in South Asia. Its member states are Afghanistan, Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Our aim is to develop a prediction
model for the SAARC countries to understand the epidemiological trend of novel coronavirus
outbreak in these countries. Here we explore a modified version based on the Susceptible (S)Infected (I)- Recovered (R) epidemic model to predict the short term (20 days), mid-term (90
days) and long term (180 days) evaluation of COVID-19 situation in these countries of SAARC
regions.

2.2 Modified SIR (M-SIR) Model
Predictive mathematical disease models are important for understanding the trajectory of the
outbreak and for preparing successful response strategies. One commonly used model is the
human-to-human transmission SIR model, which defines people's flow through three mutually
exclusive stages of infection: Susceptible (S), Infected (I), and Recovered (R). Most epidemic
models are based on dividing the population into a small number of sections. Each person is
identical in terms of their status with the considered disease. The SIR model based on three
sections: Susceptible (S) is the class for those who are susceptible to infection. This can include
passive immune systems as soon as they lose their immunity. In the Infected (I) class, the
parasite level within the host is large enough, and there is a possibility of spreading the infection
to other susceptible people. The Recovered (R) class includes all infected and recovered
individuals. This epidemiological model captures the dynamics of acute infections that, after
recovery, confer lifelong immunity. In general, the overall size of the population is considered
constant N=S+I+R. The two cases should be examined and characterized by the inclusion or
exclusion of demographic factors. Let's assume in the SIR model; there is a natural host lifespan
of 1 / µ years. Then the rate at which individuals in an epidemiological compartment suffer from
natural mortality is given by µ. It is important to emphasize that this factor is independent of the

So, the SIR model can be defined as,

Here, the initial conditions S (0) > 0, I (0) ≥ 0 and R (0) ≥ 0. It is important to enter the
expression of basic reproduction number R0 for this model. The basic reproduction number R0 is
the parameter that estimates whether a disease has spread to the population or not. If the
estimated R0 < 1, we can assume that the disease will die out, and if R0 = 1, the disease remains
in the system and is stable. But if R0 > 1, the disease will spread and cause an outbreak. The
higher the value of R0, the more difficult it is to control.
2.3 Proposed Model and Algorithm
In this exploration, we have used a susceptible (S)-infected (I)-recovered (R) epidemic model. In
a general SIR model, transmission rate (β) and recovery rate (γ) are considered as two timeinvariant variables. Moreover, several research studies have shown that a SIR model works much
better in presenting the information contained in the confirmed case data than an SEIR model14.
Therefore we have developed a model that can dynamically adjust the crucial parameters while
working on time-varying data, which is also treated as a modified SIR (M-SIR) model

.

However, in a basic SIR model, the reproduction number (଴ ) is a simple division of
transmission and recovery rates, as shown in Equation (3).

For building the model, we modified the primary reproduction number, ଴ with respect to time
(t). Equation (4) represents the changes that happened depending on time (t).

3. Results
We performed our simulations and tabulated the predicted results (short term, midterm, and long
term) with all countries from the SAARC region. We also explored 3D parameter space using
gradient descent to minimize the error. However, a lag parameter is also used in this experiment
to reduce the gap of first confirmed cases of SAARC countries' pandemic situation. The
following Table 3 represents the transmission rate (β), recovery rate (γ), and the reproduction
numbers (R0) of all countries in the SAARC regions. Bangladesh contains the highest
transmission rate of (β = ~0.63) in the SAARC region, whereas India shows a much lower
transmission rate of only ~0.51 comparing with other countries. Also, data analysis visualization
tool have been employed (Figure 2) to understand the current (as of May 30, 2020) scenario of
the countries ( Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and, Sri
Lanka) in terms of their confirmed and death cases ratio.

Figure 2: This graphical representation provides a comprehensive overview of the total number of
confirmed and death cases in SAARC regions. Country-wise COVID-19 confirmed and death cases along

with the number of cases per million illustrated in 2(A), 2(B), 2(C), and 2(D) till May 30, 2020. Based on
the illustration on 2(A) and 2(C), India has confirmed the highest number of infected cases (173763)

along with the most number of death cases (5164) in the region.

Surprisingly the slow growth of infections in the South-Asian region could be a result of a lower
er
number of testing and testing strategy17. Initially, the testing was limited to specific individuals
als
who have come from high-risk countries. Even their immediate contacts were also ignored
ed
primarily. The initial growth rate of COVID-19 infection in the SAARC region is comparatively

lower than countries like the US, France, Germany, Spain, China, Italy, and so on. However,

based on the current scenario in the SAARC region (as of May 30, 2020), India confirmed the

highest number of COVID-19 reported cases. A short term model prediction for the next 20 days

Similarly, we also predicted the epidemic curve of SAARC regions for the midterm (90 days)
and long term (180 days) COVID-19 cases. After predicting the 20 days of the epidemic, we
noticed that India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan are increasing gradually by minimizing
the active cases, and their recovery rate is also rising over time. However, in this short period,
the confirmed cases of these countries are also increasing till June 19, 2020.

4. Discussion
The US, Italy, Spain, Germany, China are the top most affected countries in the world due to the
pandemic of COVID-19. Though the novel coronavirus originated and started to spread from
China but, countries from the South-Asian region are also infected faster than other countries
globally. The overall population density of the countries in the SAARC regions is also too high.
According to Table 4, we can observe the various parameters (population, land area, density,
and world share) and their impact on analyzing the spread of novel coronavirus in these regions.

We further extended our prediction model for the next 90 days and 180 days, respectively.
Besides, the total number of the population of a country is also parameterized because the total
population of a country cannot be infected. Therefore, if we consider the total population as
infected, then the probable number of infected persons remains unknown. Based on the
prediction model, we tabulated the model predicted results of all SAARC countries for short
term, mid term and long term prediction respectively (Table 5).

In the mid-term and longterm forecast, active cases
will become zero

A midterm (90 Days) prediction model is further assessed until August 31, 2020, and the nature
of the epidemic curve has been depicted in Figure 4. For all the countries of the SAARC
regions, we have predicted the total number of confirmed, death, recovery, and active cases.

Figure 4: Based on the M-SIR prediction model, prediction statistics for the upcoming 90 days for all the
he
countries in the SAARC regions has depicted here. Different predicted case scenarios (confirmed, death,
th,
recovered, and active) till August 31, 2020, helps to understand the epidemiological nature of COVID-19
19
in the south Asian region. The predicted model indicates that in the next 90 days prediction curve will
ill
increase sharply for India (in terms of confirmed and death cases). Moreover, India will also show a
substantial increase in its recovery rate. However, the number of active cases will increase in Pakistan till
August 31, 2020.

Lastly, a long term prediction model for the next 180 days (till November 30 2020) situation has
as
been presented in Figure 5. According to the prediction model, active cases will fall to zero at
the end of June in Sri Lanka, and at the beginning of August in India (Figure 5). However,
er,
Bangladesh, Maldives, and Pakistan will take more few months to reduce its active cases. On the
he
other hand, countries like Afghanistan, Nepal and Bhutan will show a steep increase in their
eir
active cases.

5. Conclusion
The COVID-19 epidemic has brought unprecedented health concern for the community of all
around the globe. The pandemic data of COVID-19 of SAARC countries have analyzed by using
the M-SIR model to predict the confirmed, deaths, recovered and active cases with respect to the
time in days. We predicted the epidemic data in the basis of short term, midterm and long term
situation. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the very first COVID-19 prediction model
which focused on the countries of SAARC regions. This epidemic modelling can be a helpful
tool for estimating and predicting the scale and time course of COVID-19, evaluation of the
effectiveness of public health interventions, and information on public health policies in SAARC
countries. In future machine learning tools can be further used to identify and optimize time
profile for the confinement.
