The simple approximation for the ﬁrst stages of the infection spread is considered. The speciﬁc feature of the COVID-19 characterized by its long latent
period is taken into account. Exponential increase of numbers of infected people
is determined by the half period of the maximal latent time for the COVID-19.
The averaging over latent period leads to additional increase of the infected numbers.

INTRODUCTION

The new virus named SARS-CoV-2 (causing COVID-19 disease) appeared ﬁrst in
China in December 2019 and to this moment (17 March 2020, 11:29 GMT) led
to 186665 conﬁrmed cases of disease and 7467 deaths in the World.

The percent

of the deathes is unusually high, especially in the group of old people, in comparison with the other ﬂu infection associated with other viruses (see the website
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-cases/). 11 March 2020 this disease is recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a pandemic. We consider
the simplest model of the COVID-19 spread which takes into account a long latent period

of this disease.
There are various scenario and models for the description of the epidemic situation. The
most models are concentrated on the spontaneous development of the infection spread to
describe all stages of the process. An example is, e.g., the susceptible-infected-susceptible
(SIS) - one of the basic themes in the mathematical epidemiology [1,2]. These models
describe the balance between the susceptible and infected individuals in population under
the various conditions of infection transfer [3]. Kinetic approach can be applied on the basis
of works [4], [5]. However, the situation with the COVID-19 has the speciﬁc features which
should be taken into account.
There are essential eﬀorts to confront the epidemic, to localize its spread. In general we
can characterize its development as a non-spontaneous epidemic process. It is especially
important also to slow down the propagation velocity to enable medicine to provide treatment for patients. Under these conditions the investigation of the initial stage of infection
is needed. The long latent period of the COVID-19 is the feature which is considered in this
paper.

THE INFECTION DEVELOPMENT

If the number of dangerous (at distance less s ≃ 2 meters) contacts per day equals Nc
for one infected person and k is the coeﬃcient of infection transfer (the ratio of the number
of people accepting virus to the number of dangerous contacts Nc ) we ﬁnd that the average
number of infected persons in population after l0 days can be estimated as the half of the
”maximal latent time” 2l0 days for the COVID-19.
Ni (Nc ; k; l0 ) = (Nc · k + 1)l0 ,

(1)

where l0 is the average number of days between obtaining the virus and appearance of the
illness after which persons have to be isolated. Note, the the case of Nc · k ≫ 1 has been
considered in [6].
As an example, let us consider Nc = 50, k = 0.1 and l0 = 7 (based on the half of the
maximal latent period equals of 14 days). As easily seen, in this example Ni (50; 0.1; 7) =
279936. If Nc = 25, k = 0, 1 and l0 = 7 we ﬁnd Ni (25; 0.1; 7) = 6434. The value of the
parameter k is unknown. It can be roughly estimated but practically cannot be changed.

Figure 1: Infected cases Ni versus the dangerous contacts Nc for the diﬀerent coeﬃcient of infection
transition k. The solid line corresponds to k = 0.1, the dot line to the value k = 0.08 and the
dashed line k = 0.07 after l0 = 7 equals the half period of the maximal latent time.

The average value l = l0 is well known, but of course, there is some distribution on l, which
is not included in the simplest model under consideration. In Fig.1 the dependence of the
infected cases Ni on the number of dangerous contacts Nc per one infected person is shown
in the typical interval 50 ≥ Nc ≥ 0. The various curves correspond to the coeﬃcient of
infection transfer (or probability of infection) equals k = 0.1, 0.08, 0.07.
To generalize the above consideration for the case of distribution on maximal latent
period l, which always exists, we use the Gauss normalized distribution around l = l0 (the
restriction for the maximal latent period is removed due to exponential decrease of the
distribution)

where Φ is the error function Φ(x) = [2 0 dx′ exp(−x′2 )]/ π = −Φ(−x). To ﬁnd approximately the result for the average on l value of infected people ⟨Ni (Nc ; k; l)⟩l we can transfer

Therefore, for the averaged over the Gauss distribution l number of infected people in
population is given by

that is generalization of Eq. (1). For D → ∞ we arrive to the result of Eq (1). As is clear the
distribution on l always leads to increase of the infected cases ⟨Ni (Nc ; k; l)⟩l in comparison
with Ni (Nc ; k; l0 ). The curves in Figure 2 illustrate the role of averaging over l with diﬀerent
values of the averaging parameter D=0.1 and D = 0.05 (shown, correspondingly, in solid and
dashed lines) and their comparison with the non-averaged curve (dotted line - the function
Ni (Nc ; k; l0 = 7) with Nc = 20 ÷ 50 and k = 0.08. The diﬀerence between ⟨Ni (Nc ; k; l)⟩l
and Ni (Nc ; k; l0 = 7) increases with Nc increase and can be essential for Nc > 40 for the
considered parameters.

CONCLUSIONS

The typical for the virus SARS-CoV-2 long maximal latent period 2l leads to the fast
exponential increase of the average infected people with the exponent l. The subsequent
restriction of the infection spread is related with the fast and true quarantine actions, which
transfer ﬁrst the exponential increase to saturation, as it is in China at the moment and to
further decrease.
