Key points: The nasopharyngeal Panbio-COVID-19 antigen test performed in real-life
conditions at point-of-care is highly sensitive in symptomatic patients, particularly with
Ct<30 and older age. The test is useful to identify asymptomatic patients with lower Ct
values and therefore with contagious risk.

ABSTRACT
Background: Performance of point-of-care tests in clinical practice remains undetermined.
We aimed to evaluate the performance of the nasopharyngeal Panbio COVID-19 antigen
Rapid Test Device in real-life conditions in different clinical scenarios.
Method: Prospective study conducted in three primary care centers (PCC) and an emergency
department. The antigen test was performed at point-of-care in nasopharyngeal and nasal
swabs, and in saliva. Positive and negative percent agreement (PPA, NPA) were calculated
with the RT-PCR assay as reference standard.
Results: Of 913 patients included, 296 (32.3%) were asymptomatic and 690 (75.6%) came
from the PCC. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 913, nasal swabs from 659, and
saliva from 611 patients. RT-PCR was positive in 196 (21.5%) nasopharyngeal samples
(NPS). Overall PPA (95% CI) in NPS was 60.5% (53.3-67.4), and it was lower in nasal
swabs (44.7%) and saliva (23.1%). Test performance in NPS was largely dependent on the
cycle threshold (Ct) in RT-PCR, with PPA>90% for Ct≤25 and ≥80% for Ct<30. In
symptomatic patients, the PPA was 95% for Ct≤25; ≥85% for Ct<30, and 89% for the
symptom triad of fever, cough and malaise. Performance was also dependent on age, with
PPA of 100% in symptomatic patients >50 years with Ct<25. In asymptomatic patients, the
PPA was 86% for Ct<25. In all cases, NPA was 100%.
Conclusion: The nasopharyngeal Panbio COVID-19 antigen test performed at point-of-care
is highly sensitive in symptomatic patients, particularly with Ct<30 and older age. The test
was useful to identify asymptomatic patients with lower Ct values and therefore with
contagious risk.

The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic worldwide requires the urgent adoption of
effective preventive measures. Early diagnosis and rapid isolation of infected people are
central to contain disease transmission. While real-time reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) is currently the reference assay for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2
infection, novel rapid antigen tests have emerged with several potential key advantages over
molecular methods [1]. In contrast to the RT-PCR, the antigen test is relatively inexpensive,
simple to perform and easy to interpret, does not require infrastructure, and enables obtaining
point-of-care results within a few minutes. As a result, it allows immediate decisions about
isolation and therapeutic interventions on infected individuals. Moreover, antigen tests are
capable of identifying infected people early after infection, when viral loads are high and the
likelihood of transmission is highest [2]. Despite the lower sensitivity when compared to the
molecular assays, the possibility of repetitive testing with a low cost procedure and the realtime detection of the most infective patients, make the antigen a potentially high valuable test
in terms of surveillance, to track and prevent the spread of the infection [3].

Information on the performance of the point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests is limited.
The sensitivity of the first generation antigens is overall low [4], and most studies have been
conducted in laboratory specimens, involved a relatively low number of samples, and the
minority with available clinical data included primarily symptomatic patients [5-8]. To assess
the real performance of a point-of-care test, it should be used in real-life conditions, including
consecutive patients, and obtaining results on site. One of the uncertainties about the antigen
is the accuracy of the test in asymptomatic patients, and how it performs in additional clinical
settings, like childhood or old age, among others. Another relevant question is whether a
more convenient sample would be a suitable alternative for diagnosis. Antigen tests are
currently authorized to be performed on nasopharyngeal or nasal swabs, which need to be

collected by healthcare professionals. Since saliva can be self-collected, antigen assessment
in this sample would facilitate large-scale testing.

Panbio COVID-19 antigen Rapid Test Device (RTD) (Abbott Rapid Diagnostic Jena GmbH,
Jena, Germany) has been recently marketed for the qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2
antigen in human nasopharyngeal swab specimens, with high sensitivity and specificity. We
evaluated the performance of this point-of-care test in real-life conditions, in three Primary
Care Centers (PCC) and an Emergency Department (ED). We assessed the accuracy of the
test in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, in different clinical scenarios, and in
nasopharyngeal, nasal and saliva samples.

METHODS
Study design, setting and data collection
A prospective study was conducted from 15th September to 29th October 2020 in three PCC
and an ED. Consecutive patients, either with COVID-19 signs/symptoms or asymptomatic
contacts attending the PCC, and a majority of symptomatic patients presenting to the ED
were included in the study. Demographic and clinical data from primary care patients were
collected using a structured questionnaire. The questionnaire included information about six
specific symptoms and their temporality and the number of days since the initiation of
symptoms. Clinical data from patients who attended the ED were obtained from the
electronic health records. Informed consent was obtained from all patients, and the study was
approved by the Hospital General Universitario de Elche COVID-19 Institutional Advisory
Board.

Specimen collection
At the PCC, patients were asked to fill the questionnaire about symptoms and to collect saliva
into a 100 ml sterile empty container. Then, a nasal swab and two consecutive
nasopharyngeal swabs (one swab for each nostril) were obtained by a qualified nurse
according to the recommended standard procedure. At the ED, two consecutive
nasopharyngeal swabs, also with a different swab for each nostril, were obtained by a
clinician.

Nasal swabs, one of the two nasopharyngeal swabs and the saliva samples obtained at the
PCC were tested on-site in the following minutes after collection for antigen detection. One
of the nasopharyngeal swabs obtained at the ED was also analyzed on-site for antigen
detection immediately after collection. The antigenic assessment in all the samples was
performed using the Panbio COVID-19 Ag RTD, an immunochromatographic test with a
membrane strip pre-coated with antibodies to the SARS CoV-2 nucleocapsid. The kit was
used acc
ording to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs were
immersed in two extraction tubes containing 300 µl of buffer from the kit. A third swab was
soaked in the saliva sample and then immersed in a third 300 µL-tube. The three tubes were
ready to be applied to the corresponding antigen device.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection
The second nasopharyngeal swab was preserved in a 3 mL transport tube containing
guanidine salt solution (Mole Bioscience, SUNGO Europe B.V., Amsterdam, Netherlands).
After collection of all samples, nasopharyngeal specimens were transported daily by the same
healthcare workers who collected the samples at the PCC to the clinical microbiology
laboratory for immediate molecular analysis by RT-PCR. Nasopharyngeal samples (NPS)
from the ED were also sent to the same microbiology laboratory. Nucleic acid extraction was
performed using 300 µL of nasopharyngeal specimen on Chemagic™ 360 Nucleic Acid
Purification Instrument (PerkinElmer España SL, Madrid, Spain). Then, 10 uL of eluate was
used for real-time RT-PCR assay targeting the E-gene (LightMix® Modular SARS-CoV
(COVID19) E gene, TIB MOLBIOL, Berlin, Germany, distributed by Roche). Testing was

performed according to the manufacturer’s guidelines on Cobas z 480 Analyzer (Roche,
Basilea, Suiza).

Statistical analyses
The percent agreement (positive, negative and overall) (PPA, NPA and OPA) for Panbio
antigen test in the nasopharyngeal, nasal and saliva samples compared to the reference
standard RT-RCR test in nasopharyngeal swab was calculated. Performance agreement was
evaluated using Cohen’s kappa coefficient. Performance was also evaluated in NPS
stratifying by age, sex, the number of cycles of amplification in RT-PCR (cycle threshold,
Ct), and duration of symptoms. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess
predictors of the sensitivity of the antigen test in symptomatic patients. The estimated sample
size for a sensitivity of at least 91.4% (according to the manufacturer), a precision of 2.5%
and a statistical power of 80%, was 762 patients. For a specificity of at least 97%, sample size
required was 377 patients.

RESULTS
During the study period, 913 patients were included; all of them had a nasopharyngeal swab
for RT-PCR, 904 (99%) a second nasopharyngeal swab for antigen test, 659 (72%) a nasal
swab and 611 (67%) a saliva sample collected. A total of 690 (75.6) NP samples were
collected from the PCC and 223 (24.4) from the ED.

Clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1. Median (Q1-Q3) age was 40.6
(23.0-55.6) years, and 423 (46.3%) were men. The most common comorbidities were
dyslipidemia in 80 (22.2%) patients, hypertension in 124 (17.0%), and diabetes in 60 (8.2%).
There were 617 (67.6%) symptomatic patients and 296 (32.4%) were asymptomatic. Median
(Q1-Q3) number of days from symptom onset was 3 (2-5) days, and the most frequent
symptoms were cough (50.1%), followed by fever (46.8%), sore throat (31.9%) and nasal
congestion (31.3%). Median (Q1-Q3) Ct was 24 (16-30); 22 (16-29) in symptomatic and 28
(21-32) in asymptomatic patients (p=0.012); and 21 (15-27), in patients ≥50 years and 26 (1831) in <50 years (p=0.02).

Performance of the antigen test by type of sample, site of care, and cycle threshold.
There were 196 (21.5%) samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and 120 (13.1%)
positive antigen results. Performance of the test by type of sample is shown in Figure 1 and
Table 2. In NPS, the overall PPA and NPA (95% CI) of the antigen test were 60.5% (53.367.4) and 100% (99.3-100), respectively. In the saliva, the PPA (95% CI) was 23.1% (16.231.9), and in nasal samples 44.7% (36.1-53.6).

By site of care, the PPA (95% CI) in NPS at the ED was 69.0% (55.3-80.1). At the PCC, the
PPA was 56.9% (48.2-65.3).
The performance of the test by Ct in NPS is shown in Figure 2A. In the analysis including all
patients, a gradual decline in sensitivity was observed with increasing Ct values, with a more
prominent decrease from Ct>28. The PPA was >90% for Ct ≤25, and ≥80% for Ct <30.

Performance of the antigen test in NPS by age and sex
Table 2 and Figure 2B show the performance of the antigen test according to age group.
There PPA increased with increasing age, with lower sensitivity among children and young
adults (PPA [95% CI] 38.1% [24.0-54.3] for 15-30 years,) and higher sensitivity in older
patients (PPA [95% CI] 72.4% [52.5-86.6] for ≥65 years).

No remarkable differences were found in the antigen test performance by sex. The PPA in
men was 63.4% (53.1-72.6), and in women, 57.4% (46.8-67.5) (Table 2).

Performance of the antigen test in NPS in symptomatic patients
A total of 617 (67.6%) patients presented with clinical symptoms. Median (Q1-Q3) age was
41.0 (24.0-56.3) years and 289 (46.8%) were men (Table 1). In 156 (25.3%) patients the RTPCR was positive in the nasopharyngeal sample and in 105 (17.2%) the antigen test was
positive. The PPA (95% CI) in the NPS samples was 67.3% (59.3-74.5). The PPA by type of
sample in symptomatic patients is shown in Figure 1.

The performance of the antigen test in NPS by Ct is shown in Figure 2A and Table 2. The
sensitivity of the test decreased more slowly with increasing Ct in symptomatic patients than
in the overall sample, although a faster decrease was again observed from Ct values >28. The
PPA was ≥95% (95% CI 87-98) for Ct ≤25, and ≥85% (77-91) for Ct <30.
By age, the antigen test performance increased with increasing age, with a PPA (95% CI) of
79.3% (66.3-88.4) in patients >50 years.
Table 2 shows the performance of the antigen test in NPS by number of days with symptoms.
The PPA was near 80% for a period <7 days from symptom onset, and fell from then on.
By symptoms, the highest sensitivity was observed for malaise and ageusia, with a PPA of
75% each, followed by sore throat with PPA 73%, and cough, nasal congestion and dyspnea,
the three with PPA of 69%. The PPA for the triad of cough, fever and malaise was 89%.

Figure 3 shows the performance of the antigen test according to the presence of symptoms,
age, Ct and days after symptoms onset. The highest PPA of the test was observed for Ct<25,
for which the PPA was >90% for concomitant age >15 years; 100% for >50 years; and 95%
for <7 days duration of symptoms.

A multivariate logistic regression was run to explore the independent factors associated with
antigen test performance among symptomatic patients, including age, sex, Ct values and
duration of symptoms categorized into < or ≥7 days. The model showed that the PPA was
independently associated with age, with an OR (95% CI) of 1.20 (1.03 - 1.40) for each 5
year-older period, duration of symptoms with an OR of 3.99 (1.22-13.06) for <7 days, and
inversely associated with the Ct, with an OR (95% CI) of 0.66 (0.57- 0.76).

Performance of the antigen test in NPS in asymptomatic patients
A total of 296 patients were asymptomatic, with median (Q1-Q3) age of 39.9 (20.4-52.5)
years and 134 (45.3%) were men. The PPA by type of sample in asymptomatic patients is
shown in Figure 1. A total of 39 (13.2%) patients had a positive RT-PCR in the
nasopharyngeal sample and 13 (4.4%) a positive NP antigen test. The PPA in the
nasopharyngeal sample was 33.3% (95% CI, 19.6-50.3), and Cohen’s kappa coefficient 0.46
(95% CI, 0.30-0.63).

Figure 2A, Fig. 3A and Table 2 show the performance of the antigen test by Ct and age in
asymptomatic patients. Again a decrease in sensitivity was observed with increasing Ct, but it
was much more pronounced than in symptomatic patients, mainly from Ct>20 (Fig. 2A).
However, for low Ct, the sensitivity was high for all age groups, with an overall PPA (95%
CI) of 86% (56-97) for Ct ≤25.

DISCUSSION
We evaluated a recent generation point-of-care antigen test for SARS-CoV-2 in real-life
conditions in a large population of consecutive patients and on-site, where the test was
conceived to be performed. Our data show that the sensitivity of the antigen test is largely
dependent on the Ct values, age, and the presence and duration of symptoms. The sensitivity
of the antigen test was highest in symptomatic patients older than 50 years and with Ct values
associated with an increased risk of infectivity, reaching 100% in this scenario. Although the
performance of the test was overall lower in asymptomatic patients, again the antigen
identified with a sensitivity higher than 85% those with lower Ct, and therefore with higher
contagious risk. In all cases, the specificity of the antigen test was near 100%. Finally,
although the saliva would facilitate mass testing for surveillance, the low sensitivity of the
antigen in this specimen does not support its use as an alternative sample.

In contrast to SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with high levels of viral
shedding at the initial stages of the infection in the upper respiratory tract, which facilitates
detecting the virus during the most infectious period. The availability of a rapid point-of-care
test for the diagnosis allows adopting immediate and real-time decisions, which is a clear
advantage over the RT-PCR in controlling the spread of the infection. Although the antigen
test showed an overall lower sensitivity than the RT-PCR in our study, and that reported by
the manufacturer, the test was highly accurate in symptomatic patients exhibiting lower Ct
values, with a sensitivity greater than 95% for Ct of 25 or lower, and at least 85% for Ct of
less than 30. High SARS-CoV-2 viral load has been associated with severity of disease and
mortality [9,10], and several studies support a correlation of Ct values with infectivity, as
defined by growth in cell culture [11-13]. Although breakpoints fluctuate among different

studies, a diagnostic Ct value of RT-PCR equal or greater than 32 was associated with no
isolation of SARS-CoV-2 using cell-based cultures, neither with active viral replication [11].
Other studies report no SARS-CoV-2 recovery in cell culture with Ct values higher than 29.5
[12], or even higher than 24, with a decrease by 32% of positive cultures for each unit of
increase in Ct [13]. Although the correlation between viral growth and infectivity needs to be
confirmed, our data suggest that the point-of-care antigen test is useful to detect most SARSCoV-2-infected symptomatic patients, and to identify those with significant transmission risk.
Another factor influencing the performance of the antigen test was the duration of symptoms.
As specified by the manufacturer and also reported [6], we found a higher sensitivity of the
test within a period of less than 7 days from the initiation of symptoms.

Since most SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic, the performance of the antigen test in
this scenario needs to be established, and this information is key for strategies aimed at
preventing the spread of the infection at a community level. Our study shows that the
sensitivity was poorer when compared to that of patients with symptoms. The same as with
symptomatic participants, the sensitivity was highly dependent on the Ct, and we found a
PPA higher than 85% for Ct ≤25. Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission has been
reported [14,15], but the secondary attack rate from either asymptomatic or presymptomatic
patients was found in a meta-analysis to be lower compared with that of patients with
symptoms [16], and to be as low as 0.3-0.6% [17]. In presymptomatic patients, SARS-CoV-2
growth in viral culture was rarely observed with Ct above 25 [14]. Although the performance
of the test was inferior in asymptomatic individuals, the increase in sensitivity observed with
lower Ct coupled with the lower transmission risk described within this group, could make
the antigen a potentially helpful tool to identify those with infective risk among
asymptomatic patients. As with other studies [18], because we did not follow up patients, we

cannot distinguish the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals who
remained asymptomatic throughout, and those who were presymptomatic and developed
symptoms later in the course of the infection. The latter patients may have the chance to be
detected by the test in ulterior examinations, thereby increasing the sensitivity of an assay
that allows repeated testing because of its inexpensiveness and simplicity.

In addition to the viral load, the sensitivity of the antigen test was highly dependent on age.
Younger children showed the poorest antigen test performance, and there was a gradual
increase in the sensitivity of the test with age, with highest values in older patients. Several
factors might contribute to explain this finding. Children showed less cooperation or even
resistance during the collection of the nasopharyngeal sample. Other factors like temporality
of symptoms or the higher Ct values among younger patients might also have played a role.
However, our study showed that age was associated with the antigen test performance
independently of the Ct and duration of symptoms, a finding that merits further investigation.

We explored the performance of the antigen test in alternative locations to the nasopharynx
recommended by the manufacturer, which could be more useful for surveillance, like the
nose or saliva. Because saliva can be self-collected, this sample would be the most
advantageous if mass testing was considered with the point-of-care antigen test. Saliva has
additionally shown to be a suitable alternative sample to nasopharyngeal swab for SARSCoV-2 detection by RT-PCR [19]. Unfortunately, our study shows that the sensitivity of the
point-of-care antigen test is low in the saliva. The same occurred with the nasal swabs, where
the test performance was neither satisfactory.

Limitations of the study include the lack of statistical power for the analysis of the test
performance in specific subgroups, and the incomplete information about number of days
since the risk contact in asymptomatic patients. Strengths are the real-life conditions in which
the antigen test has been used to assess its true performance, the inclusion of consecutive
unselected patients which allowed analyzing how it performs in diverse clinical scenarios,
and the on-site execution of the test.

In conclusion, the sensitivity of the nasopharyngeal Panbio COVID-19 antigen RDT is
closely related to the Ct values, age and the presence and duration of symptoms. The test
performance is optimal in symptomatic patients older than 50 years with viral loads linked
with infectivity, and in asymptomatic patients the test may be useful to identify those with a
higher risk for transmission. The saliva is not a suitable alternative sample for antigen
detection.
