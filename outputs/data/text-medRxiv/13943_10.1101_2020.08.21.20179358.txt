ABSTRACT

34

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute

35

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) affects millions of people and

36

killed hundred-thousands of individuals. While acute and intermediate interactions

37

between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system have been studied extensively,

38

long-term impacts on the cellular immune system remained to be analyzed. Here, we

39

comprehensively characterized

40

mononuclear cells in 49 COVID-19 convalescent individuals (CI) in comparison to 27

41

matched SARS-CoV-2 unexposed individuals (UI). Despite recovery from the disease

42

for more than 2 months, CI showed significant decreases in frequencies of invariant

43

NKT and NKT-like cells compared to UI. Concomitant with the decrease in NKT-like

44

cells, an increase in the percentage of Annexin V and 7-AAD double positive

45

NKT-like cells was detected, suggesting that the reduction in NKT-like cells results

46

from cell death months after recovery. Significant increases in regulatory T cell

47

frequencies, TIM-3 expression on CD4 and CD8 T cells, as well as PD-L1 expression

48

on B cells were also observed in CI, while the cytotoxic potential of T cells and

49

NKT-like cells, defined by GzmB expression, was significantly diminished. However,

50

both CD4 and CD8 T cells of CI showed increased Ki67 expression and were fully

51

capable to proliferate and produce effector cytokines upon TCR stimulation.

52

Collectively, we provide the first comprehensive characterization of immune

53

signatures in patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting that the

54

cellular immune system of COVID-19 patients is still under a sustained influence

Introduction

57

The sudden emergence and rapid global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome

58

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

59

poses an unprecedented health crisis to humankind. As of August 14th, 2020, there

60

were more than 20 million documented cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and more

61

than 750 thousand individuals lost their lives. SARS-CoV-2-infected people exhibit a

62

wide spectrum of disease manifestations ranging from moderate or even unnoticed

63

symptoms (1) to life-threatening acute infections predominantly affecting the

64

respiratory tract (2) but also other organs such as the kidney (3) and the central

65

nervous system (4) can be harmed. Moderate cases show symptoms of fever, dry

66

cough, fatigue, abnormal chest CT findings but with a good prognosis (5, 6).

67

Conversely, some patients suddenly deteriorate towards acute respiratory distress

68

syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ failure, with fatality rates approaching 60% (7).

69

Recent studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infections strongly shape the immune

70

system and result in its dysregulation, including imbalanced antiviral and

71

pro-inflammatory responses, altered numbers and impaired functions of different

72

immune cell subsets (8). We and others previously showed that lymphopenia and an

73

inflammatory cytokine storm can be observed in COVID-19 patients and that their

74

extents correlate with COVID-19-associated disease severity and mortality (9-12).

75

The recovery of T cell counts and the end of the inflammatory cytokine storm in

76

severe COVID-19 cases have been associated with a favorable disease outcome (9).

77

However, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the cellular immune system after the

Results

142

Characteristics of the study cohort

143

To characterize the cellular immune system in individuals that had recovered from

144

COVID-19, blood samples were analyzed about 3.5 months (Chinese cohort) or 1.5

145

months (German cohort) after the first diagnosis. The demographic profiles of the

146

Chinese cohort are shown in Table 1. All CI had been diagnosed as either moderate

147

(83.3%, 25/30) or mild COVID-19 cases (16.7%, 5/30). The median period between

148

the first diagnosis of COVID-19 and blood sampling was 112 days (range: 60 to 136

149

days). Among all COVID-19 cases, 43.3% (13/30) were hospitalized and 23.3% (7/30)

150

received oxygen inhalation treatment. Leukopenia and lymphopenia were observed in

151

43.5% (10/23) and 60.9% (14/23) of tested cases, respectively. Increased C-reactive

152

protein and IL-6 levels were observed in 52.6% (10/19) and 76.9% (10/13) of tested

153

patients, respectively. All moderate cases showed abnormal radiological findings

154

suggesting pneumonia by chest computed tomography (CT) scans, while mild cases

155

showed no radiological abnormality in the lungs. Twelve moderate cases and one mild

156

case (43.3%, 13/30) had positive RT-PCR results for viral RNA. All patients were

157

anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and/or IgG seropositive. At the time of blood sampling, 20%

158

(6/30) of cases exhibited virus-specific IgM and IgG, 70% (21/30) were IgG single

159

positive, and 10% (3/30) were IgM and IgG negative. The demographic profiles of the

160

German cohort are shown in Table 2. This cohort has 19 CI, in which 10.53 % (2/19)

161

were hospitalized. Nine cases (47.37%, 9/19) had positive RT-PCR results for viral

162

RNA, and 18 cases (94.74%, 18/19) were anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and/or IgG

163

seropositive. The median period between the first diagnosis of COVID-19 and blood

164

sampling in the German cohort was 41 days. Only the analysis of invariant NKT

165

(iNKT) cells was performed in the German cohort, while analysis of all other cell

166

populations was performed in the Chinese cohort.

167

168

The criteria for COVID-19 convalescent are as follows: afebrile for more than 3 days,

169

resolution of respiratory symptoms, substantial improvement of chest CT images and

170

two consecutive negative RTâqPCR tests for viral RNA in respiratory tract swab

171

samples obtained at least 24 h apart. At time of blood sampling, all CI were negative

172

for viral RNA test and had no recognized medical conditions.

173

174

Characterization of immune cell subsets in individuals recovering from COVID-19

175

First, we characterized whether the overall immune cell composition in PBMCs differ

176

between CI and UI by flow cytometry (as depicted in figure S1A and S1B). We

177

observed that the profile of the immune cell composition of CI was distinct from that

178

of UI (Figure 1A). Specifically, the frequencies but not the absolute numbers of CD4+

179

T cells in CI were slightly but significantly higher than in UI (Figure 1B and S1C),

180

while no significant differences in absolute numbers and frequencies of total T cells,

181

CD8+ T cells, B cells, NK cells, and monocytes were observed between CI and UI

182

(Figure 1B and S1C). Interestingly, CI showed dramatic decreases in frequencies of

183

both the NKT-like cell population (CD3+ CD56+) and the iNKT cell population

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179358; this version posted August 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

184

(Î±-GalCerâCD1d tetramer+ and TCR VÎ±24-VÎ²11+) compared to UI (Figure 1C and

185

1D). The absolute numbers of NKT-like cells of CI (median: 20.7/Î¼l) were only about

186

60% of the level observed in UI (median: 34.5/Î¼l, figure 1C). Besides, CI showed a

187

significant increase in dendritic cells (DCs) in both the absolute numbers and

188

frequencies compared to UI (Figure 1E).

189

Next, we examined whether the decrease of NKT-like cells in CI was associated with

190

increased cell death. Annexin V and 7-AAD stainings were performed to analyze

191

apoptosis and necroptosis of NKT-like cells, CD4 and CD8 T cells, B cells, and NK

192

cells. A profound and significant increase in the frequency of the Annexin V and

193

7-AAD double positive NKT-like cells was observed in CI (median: 3.3%) compared

194

to UI (median: 1.2%) (Figure 2A), suggesting that increased proportions of NKT-like

195

cells of CI are undergoing apoptosis and/or necroptosis even after recovery from

196

COVID-19. Importantly, the intensities of NKT-like cell death were inversely

197

correlated with NKT cell frequencies in CI (Figure 2B). Besides, apoptosis and/or

198

necroptosis of CD4+ T cells and B cells were also slightly increased in CI compared

199

to those in UI (Figure 2C).

200

Taken together, these results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infections elicit a

201

sustained impact on the immune cell composition in the peripheral blood during the

202

extended convalescence phase, dominated by a contraction of NKT-like cells, and an

203

expansion of DCs.

205

Characterization of T cell phenotypes in individuals recovering from COVID-19

206

Next, we used several markers of CD4 and CD8 T cells to determine their

207

differentiation (CD45RA and CCR7), proliferation (Ki67), activation (CD38 and

208

HLA-DR), and exhaustion / suppression (PD-1, TIM-3, TOX, and Tregs) status. We

209

also defined different subpopulations and T cells from UI and CI were divided into

210

naÃ¯ve (CD45RA+ CCR7+), central memory (TCM, CD45RA- CCR7+), effector

211

memory (TEM, CD45RA- CCR7-), and terminally differentiated effector (TEMRA,

212

CD45RA+ CCR7-) subpopulations (Figure S2). No significant differences were

213

observed between UI and CI for any of the CD4 or CD8 T cell subpopulations

214

mentioned above, although a tendency of decreased CD4+ TEMRA cell frequencies

215

in CI (median: 3.3%) compared to UI (median: 7.5%) was observed (Figure S2). The

216

proliferation (Ki67+) expression of both CD4 and CD8 T cells in CI was higher than

217

that in UI (median: CD4 3.8% vs 2.7%, CD8 2.5% vs 1.9%), and the difference for

218

CD8 T cells was statistically significant (Figure 3A), indicating that T cells from CI

219

show an enhanced proliferation capacity. Previous studies have shown that T cells are

220

highly activated during the acute phase of COVDI-19 (15), thus we next analyzed the

221

activation status of CD4 and CD8 T cells by examining CD38 and HLA-DR

222

expression on the cell surface. No significant differences in CD38 and HLA-DR

223

expression on CD4 T cells were observed between UI and CI (Figure 3B and S3A).

224

Compared to UI, CI showed 1.47-fold increase in the frequencies of CD38+

225

HLA-DR- CD8 T cells, however, this difference was not statistically significant

226

(Figure 3C and S3A). Based on the analysis of PD-1 expression, some studies

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.21.20179358; this version posted August 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

227

reported that CD8 T cells may already become functionally exhausted during the

228

acute phase of COVID-19 (16), which was questioned by a different study from our

229

group (Westmeier J, et al. In submission). In our current study, the PD-1 expression

230

levels on CD4 or CD8 T cells from CI were similar to those in UI (Figure 3B, 3C and

231

S3B). However, the expression of TIM-3, another immune check point molecule, was

232

increased about 20% on CD4 and CD8 T cells in CI compared to UI, and this

233

difference was statistically significant (Figure 3D). Moreover, we examined the

234

expression of TOX in T cells from our study subjects, which is a newly identified key

235

factor of T cell exhaustion (17, 18). The frequencies of TOX+ CD4 and CD8 T cells

236

in CI increased around 20-30% compared to those in UI, however, the differences

237

were not statistically significant (Figure 3B, 3C and S3B). Regulatory T cells (Tregs)

238

play a very important role in controlling immunopathogenic reactions upon infections

239

by dampening pathogen-specific immune responses (19-21). We therefore examined

240

the frequencies of Tregs in the PBMCs of CI by analyzing Foxp3 expression in CD4 T

241

cells. As shown in figure 3E, CI showed a significant increase in Tregs frequencies

242

(median: 8.8%) compared to those in UI (median: 6.8%).

243

Taken together, our results demonstrate an immune environment that is prone towards

244

T cell suppression during the late COVID-19 convalescent phase. However, T cells in

245

CI still show a slightly enhanced activation and proliferation status, suggesting that

246

these individuals are situated in a phase of ongoing restoration of the immune

247

homeostasis.

249

Characterization of cytotoxic effector profiles of T, NK, and NKT-like cells in

250

individuals recovering from COVID-19

251

To characterize their cytotoxic profiles, we intracellularly stained CD4, CD8,

252

NKT-like, and NK cells for the cytotoxic molecules Granzyme B (GzmB) and

253

perforin directly ex vivo without re-stimulation and compared UI with CI. CI showed

254

significant decreases in the frequencies of GzmB-producing NKT-like cells (median:

255

53.2%) and CD8 T cells (mean: 20.3%) compared to UI (NKT-like cells: 81.2%, CD8

256

T cells: 29.8%, figure 4A-4D). A tendency of decreased frequencies of

257

GzmB-producing CD4 T cells was also observed, however, this difference was not

258

statistically significant (Figure 4E and 4F). Consistently, the level (mean florescence

259

intensity; MFI) of GzmB expression in individual NKT-like, CD4 and CD8 T cells

260

was also significantly lower in CI than in UI (Figure 4A-4F). However, we did not

261

observe significant differences in GzmB expression in NK cells. Interestingly,

262

perforin expression was not different for all analyzed cell populations between CI and

263

UI (Figure S4). We also examined the production of inflammatory cytokines such as

264

interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³), IL-6, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor

265

(GM-CSF) by T cells, NK cells, and NKT-like cells in CI, since a previous study

266

demonstrated that significant numbers of T cells produce these cytokines during the

267

acute phase of COVID-19 (22). Although certain increases in the frequencies of CD4

268

and CD8 T cells producing IFN-Î³, IL-6, and GM-CSF were observed in CI compared

269

to UI (Figure 4C and 4E), these differences were not statistically significant and

270

appeared to be affected by two outliers in the CI group that had profound numbers of

271

cytokine-producing T cells (Figure S4B and S4C). No significant differences in

frequencies of IFN-Î³, IL-6 and GM-CSF producing NK and NKT-like cells were

273

observed between CI and UI (Figure S4A and S4F).

To further characterize effector functions of T cells in response to TCR stimulation.

275

PBMCs from 5 CI and 5 UI were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 for 5 days and

276

were examined for cell proliferation (Ki67) and effector cytokine expression (IFN-Î³,

277

IL-2, and TNF-Î±). Compared to unstimulated cells, anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation

278

induced expected increases of Ki67 expression, as well as IFN-Î³, IL-2, and TNF-Î±

279

production of CD4 and CD8 T cells in both CI and UI (Figure 5). No significant

280

differences in effector cytokine production or proliferation of CD4 and CD8 T cells

281

were observed between the groups (Figure 5B-5D).

282

Taken together, these results indicate that there is a long-term suppression of the

283

cytotoxic potential of T cells after resolving SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, general

284

effector functions of T cells in COVID-19 convalescent individuals are maintained.

Phenotype of antigen presenting cells in individuals recovering from COVID-19

287

Next, we evaluated the phenotype and functional properties of antigen presenting cells

288

(APCs), including DCs, B cells, and monocytes by analyzing their CD80, CD86,

289

CD72, and PD-L1 expression and compared UI with CI. DCs of CI showed about 20%

290

increased CD80 expression intensities on the cell surface compared to those of UI and

291

this difference was statistically significant (Figure 6A and 6B). CD80 and PD-L1

292

expression significantly increased by about 20% and CD72 by about 50% on the

293

surface of B cells of CI (Figure 6C and 6D). No significant differences in CD86,

294

CD72, and PD-L1 expression on DCS, CD86 on B cells, and CD80, CD86, CD72,

295

and PD-L1 on monocytes were observed between the groups (Figure S5). Taken

296

together, increased expression of costimulatory molecules on DCs and B cells

297

suggests that APCs in CI are at a slightly enhanced activation status.

Discussion

300

Wuhan was the very first city hit by SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, the patients who

301

experienced the longest phase of convalescence following COVID-19 reside here.

302

This enabled us to investigate the âimmunological scarâ left by SARS-CoV-2 on

303

cellular immunity after recovery from the disease. Our results reveal that 2 to 4

304

months after resolved SARS-CoV-2 infection, most components of cellular immunity

305

returned to normal. However, the previous SARS-CoV-2 infection could still be

306

recognized during convalescent phase by diminished numbers of NKT-like cells and

307

iNKT cells as well as increased DCs. CIs show an immune environment prone to

308

suppression, supporting by the observation of significantly increases Treg frequencies,

309

and upregulation of TIM-3 expression on T cells, and PD-L1 expression on B cells.

310

Accordingly, the cytotoxic potential, as represented by GzmB expression, of T cells

311

and NKT-like cells was significantly suppressed in CIs. Both CD4 and CD8 T cells of

312

CIs showed increased cell proliferation and were fully capable of producing effector

313

cytokines in response to TCR stimulation, suggesting the effector function of T cells

314

is not compromised in CIs.

315

Unexpectedly, our study revealed profound changes of NKT cells in the convalescent

316

phase of COVID-19. NKT cells are a small but important subset of T lymphocytes

317

that regulate immune responses in the context of infection, cancer, and autoimmunity

318

(23). NKT cells can promote cell-mediated immunity to tumors and pathogens, yet

319

they can also suppress the cell-mediated immunity associated with autoimmune

320

diseases and are involved in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory disorders (24).

321

NKT-like cells were shown to be cytotoxic toward lung epithelial cells and involved

322

in the immunopathogenesis of pulmonary disease (25). It remains unclear by which

323

means NKT cells carry out such opposing functions. The existence of functionally

324

distinct NKT cell subsets may provide a rational explanation: so far, 3 NKT cell

325

subsets, including classical NKT cells (iNKT cells), non-classical NKT cells, and

326

NKT-like cells, each expressing different TCRs have been described (26). These cells

327

are activated by lipid antigens linked to non-polymorphic CD1 molecules and/or

328

pro-inflammatory cytokines generated during infection, and significantly contribute to

329

the onset of infectious or autoimmune diseases (27). Reduced numbers of iNKT cells

330

among PBMCs appear to correlate with the activity of systemic lupus erythematosus

331

(SLE) disease (28). Selective loss of iNKT cells has also been reported during acute

332

lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infections (29), as well as in chronic

333

HIV and UIV infection (30-32). Interestingly, subsequent long-term loss of iNKT

334

cells during the convalescent phase following acute LCMV infection of mice has also

335

been reported (33). It is believed that the reduction in iNKT cells at these late stages

336

post-infection occurred by activation-induced cell death, since concomitant with the

337

decrease in iNKT cells was an increase in the frequency of Annexin V+ iNKT cells

338

(33). Highly similar to the observation in acute LCMV infections of mice, we also

339

demonstrate a selective long-term loss of iNKT and NKT-like cells three months after

340

recovering from an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. The observation of increases in the

341

frequency of Annexin V+ NKT-like cells in convalescent individuals suggests that the

342

reduction of these cells may also occurred by activation-induced cell death. Recent

343

studies have reported that during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, NKT-like cells

344

showed a significant increase in GzmB and perforin production (34), as well as a

345

decrease in numbers in severe COVID-19 cases (35), suggesting these cells are highly

346

activated during the acute phase. A very recent study has also demonstrated the

347

expansion of NKT CD160 cluster in moderate but not severe COVID-19 patients,

348

which was believed to promote rapid control of the disease through direct cytotoxicity

349

as well as mediating the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity effect (36).

350

Taken together, these data suggest that the activation and subsequent long-term loss of

351

NKT and NKT-like cells during COVID-19 is a normal component of the host's

352

antiviral immune response. The mechanisms that regulate numbers and functions of

353

NKT and NKT-like cells following SARS-CoV-2 infection should be further

354

investigated.

355

In summary, we characterized the long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the

356

immune system and provide comprehensive picture of cellular immunity of a

357

convalescent COVID-19 patient cohort with the longest recovery time. The overall

358

alterations affecting cellular immunity observed in this study suggests that the

359

immune system in convalescent individuals is going through a phase of restoring

360

homeostasis after being highly activated during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2

361

infection.
