Abstract

20

There is increasing interest to use wastewater-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 as an early warning of

21

the outbreak within a community. Despite successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters sampled

22

from multiple locations, there is still no clear idea on the minimal number of cases needed in a community

23

to result in a positive detection of the virus in wastewaters. To address this knowledge gap, we sampled

24

wastewaters from a septic tank and biological activated sludge tank located on-site of a hospital. The

25

hospital is providing treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, with the number of hospitalized patients

26

per day known. It was observed that > 253 positive cases out of 10,000 persons are required prior to

27

detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. There was a weak correlation between N1 and N2 gene

28

abundances in wastewater with the number of hospitalized cases. This correlation was however not

29

observed for N3 gene. The occurrence frequency of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 5 times lower in the partially

30

treated wastewater than in the septic tank. Furthermore, abundance of N1 and N3 genes in the activated

31

sludge tank were 50 and 70% of the levels detected in septic tank, suggesting poor persistence of the

32

SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments in wastewater.

Introduction
Data from the World Health Organization suggests that approximately 80% of Covid-19 infected

46

individuals exhibit only mild symptoms or are asymptomatic 1. In particular, asymptomatic cases are

47

concerning as these individuals cannot be detected easily by the current swab testing protocols and can

48

unknowingly transmit the virus to others. Although lockdown and curfew are very effective in slowing the

49

spread of SARS-CoV-2, such intervention measures in the long term is unsustainable, and remains as a

50

key but not the only solution to mitigating Covid-19. The other solution lies in increasing our testing

51

capacity. However, to swab everyone in a country for clinical surveillance over a long term period is

52

impractical considering the amount of resources and labor hours needed. In contrast, monitoring for

53

SARS-CoV-2 directly in wastewaters over a longer duration would be an alternate method to complement

54

clinical surveillance since about 39 to 65% of infected hosts, including asymptomatic carriers, shed the

55

virus through their feces, while about 6% of patients shed it through urine 2, 3.

56

By sampling for the waste stream generated from a community, we therefore have a composite

57

sample that would be suitable for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). WBE is an approach that

58

includes the qualitative and quantitative determination of biomarkers in raw wastewater to provide

59

information on inhabitants within that wastewater catchment area. Monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 in

60

wastewater has been demonstrated in many countries, including the Netherlands, Australia, Italy, Spain

61

and US 4-9. In these studies, SARS-CoV-2 was sporadically detected from the sampled wastewaters, and

62

the reported abundance of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater ranged from 19 to 2.2 x 108 copies/L. In some

63

instances, the WBE approach was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater before clinically diagnosed

64

cases were made known 10. WBE hence demonstrates potential to serve as an early warning of

65

re(emergence) of Covid-19 in communities 7. However, without knowing the minimal number of positive

66

cases needed in each community to achieve consistent detection of SARS-CoV-2 from the sewage

67

networks, the definition of how early into the outbreak WBE can inform us remains rather unclear.

68

Ideally, the detection sensitivity of WBE can be defined by knowing the total number of

69

symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals present in the community served by the wastewater treatment

70

system. The volume of untreated sewage entering to the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) should also

71

be defined to estimate the total number of inhabitants served by the WWTP. While the latter requirement

72

can be easily determined, the number of infected individuals is difficult to obtain unless an active

73

surveillance is conducted to swab test all individuals, including asymptomatic ones, in the community. To

74

circumvent this limitation, a controlled community, for example, hospitals providing treatment to Covid-19

75

patients can be used as a model. In this manner, the number of patients contributing SARS-CoV-2 to the

76

hospital wastewaters are known through daily hospitalization and discharge records. Besides determining

77

the detection sensitivity of WBE using hospital wastewaters as a study model, we further evaluate the

78

correlation between detected abundance of SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments in wastewater with the number

79

of patients. The abundance of nucleocapsid gene fragments as it moves from the underground septic

80

tank to the first stage of the wastewater treatment plant situated on-site was also evaluated.

81

Findings from this study will provide inference to the minimal number of SARS-CoV-2 infected cases

82

needed to generate quantitative PCR (qPCR) signals associated with the virus shed into a highly diluted

83

wastewater stream. The correlation analysis provide insights to which of the nucleocapsid gene

84

abundance would vary according to the number of infected individuals. Lastly, the persistence of the

85

nucleocapsid genes in wastewater can be inferred by determining the changes in their abundance along

86

different stages of the wastewater treatment plant.

Quality control of sample processing and RNA extraction protocols

91

To determine recovery and viral nucleic acid extraction efficiency, a known concentration of murine

92

norovirus (MNV) was spiked into untreated wastewater. MNV was spiked as surrogate because it is a

93

positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus like SARS-CoV-2, and will likely be similar in terms of RNA

94

extraction efficiency. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) for MNV was performed using forward primer (5’-

complementary region for which the primers and probes would anneal to. An amplification efficiency of

100

102.7% was achieved. LOD for MNV qPCR reaction was 3.89-log copies/L and 10 copy/well,

101

respectively. MNV is not anticipated to be present in municipal wastewaters and hence abundances

102

detected by means of qPCR would be due to the spiking event.

103
104

Sampling of hospital wastewaters from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia

105

Wastewater discharged from the hospital was collected at two sampling points of the wastewater

106

treatment plant (WWTP) located on-site. The first sampling point was the underground septic tank and

107

the second sampling point was from the aerobic biological tank located on the roof of the hospital. The

108

daily wastewater intake for the on-site WWTP is 750 m3. The volume of wastewater generated by this

109

hospital approximates the size of a community with ca. 2884 persons based on an average capita water

110

usage of 260 L/person/d 12. The hospital wastewater is treated first by biological activated sludge system,

111

operated with hydraulic retention time of 9 h. The secondary-treated wastewater is then disinfected with

112

100 mg/L chlorine at a contact time of 2 h. Approximately 1 L of grab sample was individually collected

113

from the underground tank (i.e., representing untreated wastewater) and from the top aqueous layer of

114

the biological activated sludge tank (i.e., partially treated wastewater). The entire sampling duration was

115

from 15 April to 9 July 2020, with frequencies ranging from 3 to 5 daily samples per week (Table S1). The

116

lower sampling frequency during the early stages of the outbreak was due to the movement restriction

117

order imposed in the city. Samples were stored at 4oC for not more than 1 week before they were

118

processed.

Processing of wastewater samples

121

250 to 500 mL of samples were individually concentrated for viral particles using the Millipore HA

122

membrane method with slight modifications 13. Briefly, 2 mL of 2.5 M MgCl2 was added to every 100 mL

123

of the sample, agitated for 3 minutes and left to stand for 3 minutes. The samples were then filtered

124

through the HA membrane. The HA membrane was then filtered through with 200 mL of 0.5 mM H2SO4 to

adjust the isoelectric point of viruses. The viral particles retained on the HA membrane were eluted with

126

10 mL of 1 mM NaOH into a sterile collection tube that contained 100 µL of 100X tris-EDTA buffer and 50

127

µL of 100 mM H2SO4. The eluate was concentrated with Centripep YM-50 (Millipore) to approximately

128

680 µL, and an aliquot of 140 µL was extracted for its RNA using QIAmp Viral RNA kit (ThermoFisher

129

Scientific, Carlsbard, CA). QIAmp Viral RNA kit is suggested by the US CDC as one of the extraction

130

protocols to generate highly purified RNA 14. Extracted RNA was converted to complementary DNA

131

(cDNA) using Superscript III First Strand Synthesis System (ThermoFisher Scientific).

132
133

Quantitative PCR

134

Genes associated with nucleocapsid (N) proteins N1, N2 and N3 of SARS-CoV-2 were targeted for

135

quantitative PCR 15. G-blocks that include the annealing regions of N1, N2 and N3 primers-probes were

136

synthesized based on the published sequences of SARS-CoV-2 16. Six-point standard curves were

137

generated for each of the primer-probe pair to determine their respective amplification efficiencies. Limit

138

of detection is estimated based on the lowest copy number of G-block template with detectable threshold

139

Cq value. Based on the standard curves, the average amplification efficiency were 92.5%, 91.5%, 90.8%

140

and the R2 value ranged from 0.98-0.99, 0.97-0.99, and 0.97-0.99 for N1, N2, and N3, respectively. The

141

LOD was 5 copy/well, corresponding to 3.85-, 4.25-, and 3.35-log copies/L for N1, N2, and N3 qPCR

142

reaction, respectively. A non-template control serves as negative control. A positive control made up from

143

cDNA derived from RNA of SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical swab specimens was also included for qPCR.

144

Positive controls have average Cq value of 29 for N1, 30 to 31 for N2 and N3 genes. Thermal cycling

145

conditions include 50 cycles of 95oC for denaturation (3 s) and 55oC for annealing and amplification (30

146

s). All samples, standards and controls were performed in technical duplicates.

151

A total of 6.89-log copies/L MNV was spiked into the untreated wastewater. The overall recovery and

152

RNA extraction efficiency of murine norovirus was ca. 45%, and falls within the range reported by earlier

153

studies (ranging from 10% to 73%) albeit using different concentration procedures. For example, direct

154

ultracentrifugation of 20 mL of wastewater through a 50% sucrose phase layer recovered 12% of the

155

deactivated SARS-CoV-2 spiked into the sample 17. Aluminium hydroxide adsorption-precipitation

156

(adjusted to pH 6) method recovered on average 11% of spiked porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and

157

mengovirus, respectively, from 200 mL wastewater 8. Ultrafiltration of 100-200 mL using Centricon Plus-

158

70 (molecular weight cut-off of 10 kDa) recovered an average 73% of the spiked F-specific RNA phages

159

but with high standard deviation of 50% 7.

160

In addition, the reported differences in recovery efficiencies can be due to the varying type of viral

161

surrogates spiked. Different viruses have different isoelectric points (pI), which are the pH values at which

162

the net surface charge switches. The determination of pI is particularly relevant for concentration

163

protocols that utilize electrocharged membranes or coagulant adsorption-precipitation. Norovirus was

164

previously reported to have a pI ranging from 5.5 to 6 18, while the spike protein of porcine epidemic

165

diarrhea virus has a pI of 5.0 19. In contrast, there is no experimental data currently available that reports

166

on the pI of SARS-CoV-2 but predictive calculations for some of its key proteins put the range of pI

167

between 4.2 to 10.1 20. It is therefore uncertain which particular surrogate used thus far among studies

168

would best approximate to SARS-CoV-2.

169

Regardless of the viral surrogates, recovery of viral particles from untreated wastewater has been

170

challenging as evidenced from the wide range of reported efficiencies. High turbidity and organic carbon

171

content in raw wastewater matrix can foul ultrafiltration membranes and decrease flux. In this study, the

172

raw wastewater samples had an average dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration of 6.4 mg/L and

173

average turbidity of 10.6 NTU (Table 1). DOC can facilitate unintended adsorption of virus onto the

174

filtering glassware 21, and hence lower the probability of recovering viral particles that are already present

175

in low abundance and/or not homogenously distributed in the wastewater matrix. Furthermore,

176

suspended particles that accounted for turbidity can clog the membranes rapidly and permit only a limited

180

Detected abundance of SARS-CoV-2 in untreated hospital wastewaters

181

43 out of the 57 collected samples of untreated hospital wastewaters (i.e., 75.4%) tested positive for the

182

nucleocapsid genes of SARS-CoV-2. Compared to earlier studies which reported occurrence frequency

183

to range from 15.6 to 50% of the collected municipal wastewaters 4, 6, 9, 22, 23, the number of samples that

184

were positive for SARS-CoV-2 occurred at higher frequency in this study. This is not surprising since the

185

wastewaters originated from a hospital that provides treatment for Covid-19 infected patients. However,

186

despite the confirmed presence of infected patients in this hospital since our first sampling date, we did

187

not detect SARS-CoV-2 in the untreated wastewaters sampled on 15, 16, 22 and 24 April 2020. Instead,

188

a relatively consistent detection of the SARS-CoV-2 N1 gene was only observed after 27 April 2020. Wu

189

et al. determined correlation between wastewater viral titers and daily reports of new clinically confirmed

190

Covid-19 cases in Boston, US, and found that the best correlation was seen when comparing new clinical

191

cases back-dated by 4 days 24. Hence, it is likely that a consistent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the

192

hospital wastewaters can be achieved when the cumulative number of Covid-19 patients in the hospital

193

was > 73 (Figure 1). Considering that the daily wastewater intake for the on-site hospital WWTP is 750

194

m3, the volume of wastewater generated by this hospital approximates the size of a community with ca.

195

2884 persons based on an average capita water usage of 260 L/person/d 12. This therefore suggests that

196

the procedure described in this study has a detection sensitivity of ca. > 253 infected persons per 10,000

197

inhabitants.

198

Similar to that reported by Medema et al. (2020), N1 and N2 genes were observed in the hospital

199

wastewater first before N3 gene. The simultaneous detection of N1, N2 and N3 gene was observed after

200

a cumulative 138 patients or more were hospitalized (i.e., > 464 infected persons per 10,000 inhabitants).

201

With the exception of N1 and N2 gene exhibiting a weak correlation (r = 0.21 and 0.24, respectively),

202

there was no apparent correlation between abundance of N3 genes and the number of hospitalized

203

patients. The weak correlation and sporadic detection of SARS-CoV-2 genes in hospital wastewaters may

204

be dependent on the viral shedding load per patient and the shedding duration. In this study, information

205

on whether patients are exhibiting gastrointestinal distress was not provided to us due to concerns of

206

breaching patients’ confidentiality. Hence it is uncertain how many percentage of the patients may be

207

shedding the virus into the wastewater to result in the sporadic detection of SARS-CoV-2.

208
209

Log reduction of SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments at different stage of treatment process

210

The biological activated sludge tank is an open-air tank placed on the roof of the hospital, and wastewater

211

inside the tank was subjected to an increasing ambient temperature and solar irradiance during the

212

sampling period as KSA enters into summer. To exemplify, maximum diurnal temperature increased from

213

41.5 oC in April to 45.3 oC in May and 46.3 oC in June 2020, while minimum diurnal temperature also

214

increased from 14.2 oC in April to 21 oC in June (personal communication, Matthew McCabe). The

215

maximum net solar irradiation measured at 1 pm also increased from 1184.9 W/m2 in April to 1333.0

216

W/m2 in June (personal communication, Matthew McCabe). Parameters related to water quality, namely

217

DOC and turbidity were lower in values for wastewater sampled from the biological activated sludge tank

218

compared to the underground septic tank (Table 1). This indicates a certain degree of partial treatment

219

was achieved at the sampling point of the activated sludge tank.

220

Likewise, this level of partial treatment resulted in a lower detection frequency of SARS-CoV-2 in

221

wastewaters sampled from the biological activated sludge tank. Only 8 out of 52 samples (15.4%)

222

collected from the biological activated sludge tank were tested positive for N genes associated with

223

SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, N1 genes were detected in 5 samples, N2 genes were detected in 4 samples,

224

and 1 positive occurrence of N3 genes among the collected samples. N1 genes were detected first before

225

N2 and N3. The average abundance of N1 and N3 genes decreased by 0.3-log (i.e., 50%) and 0.5-log

226

(i.e., 70%), respectively, from the underground septic tanks to the biological activated sludge tank.

227

However, there was an increase by 44% in the average abundance of N2 genes sampled from the

228

activated sludge tank compared to that in the underground septic tank. This suggest a potential

229

accumulation of N2 genes in the activated sludge tank, likely due to better persistence of N2 compared to

230

N1 and N3 genes. Most of the positive detection in the biological activated sludge tank occurred in late

231

June, and coincides after a period of high cumulative numbers of hospitalized patients. Despite the slight

232

increase of N2 genes in a small group of samples, it is unlikely that the N genes will persist in the final

233

treated wastewater since the last stage of the hospital WWTP includes a final disinfection step at a very

234

high chlorine concentration (100 mg/L) and at long contact time (2 h). An earlier study determined that 6.5

235

mg/L of free chlorine and 1.5 h of contact time was already sufficient to remove 0.5 to 18.7 x 103 copies/L

236

of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA to levels below detection limits 25.

237
238

Conclusion

239

By utilizing a confined environment (i.e., a hospital with known number of Covid-19 cases), this study

240

determined the detection sensitivity of wastewater-based epidemiology for SARS-CoV-2 to be about >

241

253 persons per 10,000 inhabitants. The correlation between nucleocapsid gene abundances of SARS-

242

CoV-2 and the number of infected hospitalized patients was weak, suggesting the difficulty in correlating

243

the number of cases based on the gene abundances detected in wastewaters. However, it is likely that

244

when the nucleocapsid genes were detected, there is already a substantial number of cases circulating in

245

the community that would warrant immediate intervention measures to be taken. N genes do not persist

246

well in the hospital wastewater based on the lower detection frequency in partially treated wastewater. In

247

instances where the nucleocapsid genes were detected in the partially treated wastewater, N1 and N3

248

genes had already decreased by 0.3-log and 0.5-log (i.e., ca. 50 and 70%, respectively). This is with the

249

exception of N2 genes that may persist better than N1 and N3. Future studies would be needed to

250

improve the recovery efficiency of viral particles from wastewater matrix, and to determine the decay

251

kinetics of the N genes in various environmental conditions to facilitate the detection sensitivity and

252

capabilities of WBE.
