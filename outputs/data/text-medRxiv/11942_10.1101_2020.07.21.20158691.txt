Abstract
Background At the end of December 2019, a novel respiratory infection, initially reported in
China, known as COVID-19 initially reported in China, and later known as COVID-19, led to a
global pandemic. Despite many studies reporting respiratory infections as the primary
manifestations of this illness, an increasing number of investigations have focused on the central
nervous system (CNS) manifestations in COVID-19. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the CNS
presentations in COVID-19 patients in an attempt to identify the common CNS features and
provide a better overview to tackle this new pandemic.
Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Web of Science,
Ovid, Embase, Scopus, and Google Scholar. Included studies were publications that reported the
CNS features between January 1st, 2020, to April 20th, 2020. The data of selected studies were
screened and extracted independently by four reviewers. Extracted data analyzed by using
STATA

statistical

software.

The

study

protocol

registered

with

PROSPERO

(CRD42020184456).
Results Of 2353 retrieved studies, we selected 64 studies with 11282 patients after screening.
Most of the studies were conducted in China (58 studies). The most common CNS symptom of
COVID-19 were Headache (8.69%, 95%CI: 6.76%-10.82%), Dizziness (5.94%, 95%CI: 3.66%8.22%), and Impaired consciousness (1.9%, 95%CI: 1%-2.79%).
Conclusions The growing number of studies have reported COVID-19, CNS presentations as
remarkable manifestations that happen. Hence, understanding the CNS characteristics of
COVID-19 can help us for better diagnosis and ultimately prevention of worse outcomes.

1. Introduction
At the end of December 2019, a novel respiratory syndrome, currently known as COVID-19,
was reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, and the first sign of this 2019 novel
coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV, COVID-19) was pneumonia [1-7]. This new infection rapidly
spread worldwide, and an increasing number of infected cases and deaths have been reported
globally [8, 9]. Hence, the COVID-19 outbreak was officially considered as a Public Health
Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO)
Emergency Committee [10, 11]. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is a zoonotic pathogen and can transmit from infected animals (such as bats and snakes) to
humans eventually leading to epidemics and pandemics through human-to-human transmission
[11, 12]. Most cases of COVID-19 have shown respiratory symptoms ranging from cough to
dyspnea and respiratory failure as well as the typical signs and symptoms of infection such as
fever and fatigue [7, 13-15].
However, a growing number of COVID-19 patients are presenting with different combinations
of the central nervous system (CNS) manifestations [16-18]. Several case reports have indicated
the presence of various CNS complications, including encephalitis, stroke, meningitis, and
encephalopathy in COVID-19 patients [19-22]. Furthermore, a large observational study carried
out by Mao et al. show the prevalence of the CNS presentations such as dizziness, headache,
impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, and seizure [16]. Therefore,
awareness of the different aspects of the short and long-term effects of this virus on the central
nervous system could decently guide scientists. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we
assessed the CNS manifestations in COVID-19 cases.

2. Method
2-1. Search strategy and selection criteria
We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis based on Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [23], and our study protocol is
submitted to PROSPERO (ID: CRD42020184456). We systematically searched Six databases
including Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, Web of science, Ovid, and Embase for all published
articles from January 1st, 2020 until April 20th, 2020 using the following Medical Subject
Heading terms (MESH terms):

After removing the duplicated records, articles were screened based on their titles and abstracts
by two authors (S.S and M.H) independently. The full texts of eligible publications were
examined for inclusion and exclusion criteria (A.AJ, S.M, S.S, and M.H). Observational studies
reported at least one of the related CNS symptoms in COVID-19 patients without any language,
race, country, and gender limitations included for quantitative synthesis. The preprint studies,
interventional studies, systematic reviews, case reports, conferences, commentaries, letters,
editorial, author responses, correspondence articles, in vitro, animal studies, children population,
articles without full text, or unreliable data were excluded. In addition, the reference list of the
eligible studies was searched to prevent missing publication and include all related literature.
The data were independently extracted (A.AJ. S.M, S.S, S.S, and M.H), and discrepancies were
resolved with discussion and consensus by three independent researchers (SH.N, S.D, and F.A).
2-2. Data analysis and quality assessment
The desired data was recorded using an excel spreadsheet form that included the title, first
author, year and month of publication, type of study, country, total sample size, the sample size
of male and female, study design, demographic characteristics, exposure history, clinical
manifestation, CNS symptoms, and any reported comorbidity.

We assessed the quality of included studies (A.AJ. S.M, S.S, S.S, and M.H), based on the NIH
quality assessment tool for observational cohort and case series studies [24]. This instrument
assessed the quality of included studies based on the research question, study population, the
participation rate of eligible persons, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size justification,
analyses, reasonable timeframe, exposure, outcome measures, outcome assessors and, loss to
follow-up.
2-3. Meta-analysis
Data from included studies were extracted for the number of events and total patients to perform
a meta-analysis. Cochraneâ€™s Q test and the I2 index were used to assess heterogeneity among
selected studies. Heterogeneity was categorized as low (below 25%), moderate (25%â€“75%), and
high (above 75%) [25]. Also, data adjusted by Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation
and their 95% CIs were calculated by the Clopper-Pearson method [26]. We calculate mean and
standard deviations from median and quartiles by using Wan method [27]. For continuous data,
we estimate pooled results of means and their respective 95% CI by the inverse variance method.
All analysis were performed using STATA statistical software, version 13 (StataCorp).

3. Results
As illustrated in (Figure 1), a total of 2353 studies were retrieved after a systematic search in the
aforementioned databases. After removing duplicates, 1760 studies remained. Then, we
narrowed the studies to 203 articles by screening with titles and abstracts. In full-text screening,
45 studies with no reliable or useful data, 24 review articles, 41 preprints, 6 case reports, 1 case
controls, 4 reports, 4 papers with specific children population, one study with specific pregnant
population, and 13 publications such as Commentary, editorial or Correspondence letters were
excluded. Finally, 64 studies [5-7, 15, 16, 28-86] including 11282 COVID-19 patients, met our
inclusion criteria, and were entered in meta-analysis. The main characteristics of our included
studies are presented in (Table 1).
(Figure 1)
(Table 1)
The total sample size of eligible studies was 11687, including 5568 females and 6114 males. The
mean age for non-critical patients was 48.557 (95% CI: 44.816%-52.299%) and for critical
patients was 58.965 (95% CI: 55.792%-62.139%). As shown in (Table 2), the proportion of

patients with travel history to Wuhan, Wuhan related exposure, and Living in Wuhan was
30.43%, 3.83%, and 4.74%, respectively. In addition, the proportion of patients with travel
history to other infected areas and contact with patients was 1.17% and 13.33%, respectively.
Mortality was assessed in 25 studies with a pooled incidence rate of 10.47%. The incidence rate
of positive females and males were 46.4% (95% CI: 43%-49.8%) and 49.5% (95% CI: 45.7%53.3%), respectively. 36.1% (95% CI: 27.9%-44.8%) of infected patients were in the severe,
critical, or Intensive care unit condition. In addition, the incidence rate of mortality and survival
were 10.47% (95% CI: 5%-17.3%) and 81.43% (95% CI: 65.7%-93.2%), respectively.
(Table 2)
Based on the results shown in (Table 3 and Figure 2), the most common manifestations were,
fever 79.39% (95% CI: 73.94%-84.37%), cough 54.77% (95%CI: 49.10%-60.38%), fatigue
31.13% (95% CI: 25.33%-37.23%), dyspnea 28.47% (95% CI: 21.49%-35.99%), Chest tightness
23.83% (95% CI: 17.84%-29.82%), and shortness of breath 20.42% (95% CI: 13.28%-28.85%).
The highest incidence rate among CNS symptoms of COVID-19 patients was for headache
(8.69% with 95% CI: 6.76%-10.82%), followed by Dizziness (5.94%, 95%CI: 3.66%-8.22%),
and Impaired consciousness (1.9% with 95% CI: 1%-2.79%).

4. Discussion
Recently, the world has encountered an emergent outbreak posed by the novel coronavirus 2019,
officially known as COVID-19 [87]. This infection has become a global threat, endangering
millions of lives worldwide [87]. Hence, many experts, researchers, scientists and clinicians are
attempting to investigate various aspects of this new infection to find useful solutions for coping
with COVID-19 [87]. One of the various aspects of COVID-19 is its impact on the CNS, as

reported in a growing number of studies [87]. In addition to the common symptoms in COVID19, several CNS symptoms such as headache and impaired consciousness have been observed in
infected patients [16].
While most investigated the respiratory symptoms of COVID-19, Mao et al. specifically
examined the prevalence of neurological manifestations ranging from

CNS to peripheral

nervous system (PNS) and neuromuscular symptoms in an observational study on COVID-19
patients [16]. They demonstrated CNS presentations ranging from dizziness and headache to
impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, and seizure [16]. Based on the
possible neuroinvasive potential of COVID-19, in this systematic review and meta-analysis, we
analyzed those evidence indicating the involvement of CNS. We assessed 11687 COVID-19
adult patients from six countries. We reported that COVID-19 patients commonly showed CNS
symptoms, including headache, dizziness, and impaired consciousness. Headache (8.69%) were
the most common CNS symptoms, followed by dizziness (5.94%) and impaired consciousness
(1.9%).
There are two main routes of CNS entry of COVID-19 (hematogenous and peripheral nerves
route) leading to CNS infection and inducing various symptoms such as meningitis and
encephalitis. In the hematogenous route, the virus infecting respiratory tracts can reach the CNS
through the bloodstream via overcoming a strict obstacle known as the blood-brain barrier
(BBB) [18, 88-93]. They also may enter the CNS through circumventricular organs, those CNS
organs lacking the BBB [94]. The second route, a peripheral nerve, can provide the virus with a
retrograde route in to access the CNS via an axonal transport machinery [18, 88-93]. In
accordance with this finding, some previous studies on other types of coronaviruses indicating
that coronaviruses can reach the brain via cranial nerves (e.g., olfactory, trigeminal nerve
terminals in the nasal cavity) [88, 95-97]. Such a neuroinvasive propensity is supported by
reporting of patients exhibiting smell impairment, as a hallmark of COVID-19 infection due to
the involvement of the olfactory nerve [16, 87].
The COVID-19 infection mechanism requires the virus attaching to its receptor called
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed in various tissues ranging from endothelial
cells of the cardiovascular system, airway epithelia, kidney cells, small intestine, and lung
parenchyma [98-100]. There exists a wealth of evidence that supports the expression and
distribution of the ACE2 in the CNS [100-106]. Hence, ACE2 may be a potential target of
COVID-19 upon the entrance into the CNS, triggering its effects on CNS tissue [92]. The

presence of the virus in the central nervous system is also supported by some evidence reporting
COVID-19 in the CSF of the infected cases [19, 21].
In our meta-analysis, the mortality rate of COVID-19 cases with at least one CNS symptom was
10.47%, which is much higher than the mortality rate of the general infected population [107].
Such a mortality rate can indicate the importance of careful monitoring of CNS manifestations in
COVID-19 patients. Moreover, in Maoâ€™s study, the prevalence of CNS manifestations were
higher in severe cases of the illness associated with higher mortality [16]. Although, this can be
due to the effect of COVID-19 on the brain stem and suppression of the cardiorespiratory control
centers causing respiratory failure and death [108], other possible reasons such as cytokine storm
and hypoxia have been suggested to explain the high mortality rate in cases with CNS
manifestations. Cytokine storm as an immune system response during COVID-19 infection could
enhance the permeability of the blood brain-barrier (BBB) [109, 110]. Infection of airway tissues
by COVID-19 in severe infection leads to impaired gas exchange, subsequently causing CNS
hypoxia resulting in neural dysfunction [111]. This hypoxic condition associated with severe
infection disrupts the BBB through elevation of some factors like nitric oxide (NO) and
inflammatory cytokines [112]. More precisely, all of these factors mentioned above may
contribute to making the BBB more permeable to the virus. Therefore, in the severe condition of
infection, COVID-19 easily enters the CNS via disrupted BBB and puts the brain at risk leading
to the manifestation of CNS features [113-116].
Furthermore, recent studies have shown that COVID-19 can accelerate the formation of the
blood clot in the blood vessels, increasing the risk of cerebrovascular diseases in COVID-19
patients [117, 118]. Hence, because the brain is nourished by a network of blood vessels, this
could be indicative of the importance of cerebral vasculature investigations on the CNS
symptoms in the COVID-19 infection.
In a nutshell, attention to the CNS aspects of COVID-19 infection has outstanding benefits for
clinicianâ€™s understanding of a very serious complication of this infection. At this point in time,
researchers have mainly focused on finding medicinal treatments for respiratory symptoms of
COVID-19. However, it is necessary to investigate the various CNS manifestations of COVID19 since they are associated with increased severity and mortality [16]. Not only respiratory
system dysfunction, but also impairment of respiratory control centers in the CNS (brain stem)
can induce acute respiratory failure [108, 119]. Therefore, considering all effective factors, it can
provide clinicians to choose the best way in an attempt to manage this pandemic more
efficiently.

5. Limitations
There are several limitations in our systematic review and meta-analysis. Since in this ongoing
pandemic, most of the investigations have conducted on typical signs and symptoms of COVID19. Thus the number of studies on the atypical complications of COVID-19, such as CNS
presentations are partially low. Moreover, there exist many COVID-19 preprint papers that have
not yet undergone peer review. Additionally, five studies included in our meta-analysis reported
headache and/or dizziness as one symptom in COVID-19 cases. Because we were not sure that
headache and/or dizziness is resulted from headache or is a consequence of the dizziness, it
would be challenging to categorize headache and/or dizziness in the subgroup of dizziness or
headache. Hence, in our meta-analysis, it was not reported as a CNS manifestation and are
implied as a separate symptom (table 3).

6. Conclusion
COVID-19 is a global problem that currently affects millions of people. This highly pathogenic
virus can affect various parts of the human body. Although the respiratory tract has been mainly
targeted by COVID-19, the central nervous system can be affected significantly. In addition,
patients with more severe illness showed more CNS symptoms, which may bring on worsen
clinical conditions. This study achieved an important estimation for the incidence of neurological
manifestations in patients with COVID-19. The results of our survey may be helpful for
clinicians for better diagnosis and management of CNS signs and symptoms in patients with
COVID-19.
