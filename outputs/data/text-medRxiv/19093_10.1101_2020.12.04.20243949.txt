Abstract
Background: Globally, the routinely used case-based reporting and IgG serosurveys underestimate
the actual prevalence of COVID-19. Simultaneous estimation of IgG antibodies and active SARS-CoV2 markers can provide a more accurate estimation.
Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 16416 people covering all risk groups was done between 3-16
September 2020 using the state of Karnataka’s infrastructure of 290 hospitals across all 30 districts.
All participants were subjected to simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG using a commercial
ELISA kit, SARS-CoV-2 antigen using a rapid antigen detection test (RAT), and reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for RNA detection. Maximum-likelihood estimation was used
for joint estimation of the adjusted IgG, active, and total prevalence, while multinomial regression
identified predictors.
Findings: The overall adjusted prevalence of COVID-19 in Karnataka was 27 ·3% (95% CI: 25 ·7-28 ·9),
including IgG 16 ·4% (95% CI: 15 ·1 - 17 ·7) and active infection 12 ·7% (95% CI: 11 ·5-13 ·9). The
case-to-infection ratio was 1:40, and the infection fatality rate was 0 ·05%. Influenza-like symptoms
or contact with a COVID-19 positive patient are good predictors of active infection. The RAT kits had
higher sensitivity (68%) in symptomatic participants compared to 47% in asymptomatic.
Interpretation: This is the first comprehensive survey providing accurate estimates of the COVID-19
burden anywhere in the world. Further, our findings provide a reasonable approximation of
population immunity threshold levels. Using the RAT kits and following the syndromic approach can
be useful in screening and monitoring COVID-19. Leveraging existing surveillance platforms, coupled
with appropriate methods and sampling framework, renders our model replicable in other settings.

The burden of active infection and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the general population:
Results from a statewide survey in Karnataka, India.
INTRODUCTION
The global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 causing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has raged across the
world within a few months. India has the second-highest burden of COVID-19 with 8 ·8 million
infected and 130070 deaths, as of 16 November 2020. 1 Currently, India has only case-based
reporting as the prime strategy through all the epidemic phases. Case-based reporting has the
advantages of rationalizing testing, isolating cases, and tracing and quarantining contacts. 2
However, it does not provide an estimate of the true burden of the disease, as it picks up mostly
sicker people seeking care or those who have better access to health care. Hence, the reported case
counts of COVID-19 grossly underestimate the true prevalence of the pandemic. The two rounds of
national seroprevalence surveys conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)
indicated that for every reported case, 81-130 infections were missed in the initial survey conducted
in May 2020,3 which improved to missing nearly 26–32 infections per reported case by August
2020. This may be underestimated as it captured only IgG prevalence, and the sampling was not
representative. Serological surveys, such as those conducted by the ICMR, can help understand the
burden of past infections. However, detecting new cases is challenging since 45% of the infected
people have mild or no symptoms.4 Furthermore, the estimation of active infections is affected by
poor in-person testing due to inaccessibility, stigma, and supply-side inadequacies.
Effective public health measures require understanding the existing burden of disease reliably
through epidemiological investigations. Joint estimation of IgG prevalence and active SARS-CoV-2
infections can help detect, manage, and control the disease outbreak. Seroprevalence estimates
from the world show varying numbers ranging from 0 ·07% in-hospital patients to 54 ·1% in slum
inhabitants.5-13 Although not representative, the ICMR survey results reported 0 ·73% prevalence
across the country (May-June 2020), which increased to 7% by the end of September. 3 The surveys
in slums and non-slums of Mumbai5 showed considerable variation, 54 ·1% (95% CI: 52 ·7 to 55 ·6)
and 16 ·1% (95% CI: 14 ·9 to 17 ·4) prevalence, respectively. Serosurveys in a healthcare setting of
North India showed prevalence increasing from 2 ·3% in April to 50 ·6% in July.14 However, there are
concerns about using only IgG prevalence as a marker of population immunity threshold. These
include the inability to detect the IgG antibodies over time, varying sampling methods, the
unreliable nature of the predictive value of positive antibody tests with varying sensitivity and
specificity of different tests affecting the tests' reliability, and the presence of other types of the

immune response. 15-17 This can be resolved to a great extent by understanding the burden of active
infections concurrently along with IgG estimation.
Karnataka has an estimated population of 70 ·7 million spread over 191791 square kilometers. The
first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported on 09 March 2020. As of 16 November 2020, there
were 861,647 cumulative cases, 27,146 active cases, and 11,529 deaths. 1 Our goal was to estimate
the IgG prevalence and active prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Karnataka jointly and assess
the variation across geographical regions and risk groups. Here we report the results of what is
perhaps the first comprehensive statewide survey in India. The design and analysis methodologies
of this survey can serve as the blueprint for other similar surveys.
METHODS
Study setting, design, and sample size
Setting: This was the first round of the proposed serial cross-sectional surveys across the districts of
Karnataka. This state has 30 administrative districts. The capital district Bengaluru has
approximately 13 ·6 million residents. The study was conducted during 03-16 September 2020.
Design: Each district was a unit of the survey except Bengaluru, which was subdivided into 9 units.
From the resulting geographically representative 38 units, health facilities with the expertise to
conduct the survey were selected (Figure 1 and Appendix D). The participants included only adults
aged 18 years and above. The survey excluded those already diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 Infection,
those unwilling to provide a sample for the test or those who did not agree to provide informed
consent. The population was stratified into three risk groups based on community exposure and
vulnerability to COVID-19. The Low-risk group comprised pregnant women presenting for antenatal
check-up (ANC) clinic, and persons attending the outpatient department for common ailments in
the hospitals and their attendees. The Moderate-risk group comprised persons with high contact in
the community, bus conductors and autorickshaw drivers, vendors at vegetable markets, healthcare
workers, individuals in containment zones, persons in congregate settings (markets, malls, retail
stores, bus stops, railway stations), and waste collectors. 18 The High-risk group comprised the
elderly (60 years of age and above) and persons with co-morbid conditions (chronic liver disease,
chronic

lung

disease,

chronic

renal

disease,

diabetes,

heart

disease,

hypertension,

immunocompromised condition, malignancy).
Sample size: Assuming 10% prevalence, the minimum sample size of 432 per cluster, for a target
95% confidence level, a margin of error 0 ·05, and design effect 3, led to a total sample size of 16416
across the 38 units.

Sample collection and laboratory testing
From participants in the low-risk group (Figure 2), we collected both nasopharyngeal and
oropharyngeal swab samples for the RT-PCR test following the ICMR protocol and 4 ml of venous
blood for the IgG antibody test. In the moderate and high-risk groups, we collected two swab
samples in different media for the antigen and RT-PCR tests and 4 ml of venous blood.
The rapid antigen detection test (RAT) was done using the Antigen Standard Q COVID-19 Ag
detection kit, a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for the qualitative detection of antigens
specific to SARS-CoV-2. The RT-PCR test was done on all low-risk participants and on those who
tested negative on the RAT (Figure 3) through the current ICMR-approved testing network. For
antibody testing, the collected venous blood sample was left undisturbed at room temperature for
30 minutes for clotting, then centrifuged at 3000 rpm, and the serum was transported to the
laboratory by maintaining a cold chain. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies were detected using a
commercially available, validated, and ICMR-approved kit (Covid Kavach Anti SARS-CoV-2 IgG
antibody detection ELISA, Zydus Cadila, India)19. The test was performed as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. The results were interpreted as positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies
based on the cut-off value of optical densities obtained with positive and negative samples provided
in the kit.
Data collection
After obtaining written informed consent, information on basic demographic details, exposure
history to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 in the preceding
one month, and clinical history were recorded on a web-based application designed specifically for
the study and were linked to the samples using the ICMR Specimen Referral Forms for COVID-19.
The category, symptoms, contact, and comorbidity information for participants were gathered using
the web-based application. RAT/RT-PCR results were entered into the ICMR test-data portal. The
IgG antibody test results were retrieved directly from the labs. A consolidated line-list of all the
participants was then created. From this, subsets of participants in risk-categories, subcategories,
age groups, sex, and geographical units were used to jointly estimate IgG prevalence, active
infection, and total burden in the respective categories. Symptoms and comorbidity data, which
were part of the consolidated line-list, were used in the regression. Only anonymized data with no
personal identifiers were used for the analysis.

Ethical considerations
The Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) of the Indian Institute of Public Health-Bengaluru campus
reviewed and approved the study (vide. IIPHHB/TRCIEC/174/2020). Participants’ test results were
available and shared with them by the concerned health facility.
Statistical analysis
To enable joint estimation of IgG prevalence, active infection, and total prevalence, we first
modelled an individual to be in one of four disease states: having active infection but no IgG
antibodies, having IgG antibodies but no evidence of active infection, having both IgG antibodies
and active infection, and finally having neither active infection nor IgG antibodies. The disease state
of the individual is, however, hidden and can only be inferred from the RAT, the RT-PCR, and the IgG
antibody test outcomes. This leads to a parametric model for the probabilities of test outcomes
(observations) given the disease-state probabilities (parameters of the model), after taking the
sensitivities and the specificities of the tests into account.
To get the joint estimates of the parameters in a stratum, we use maximum likelihood estimation,
which ipso facto provides estimates already adjusted for the sensitivities and the specificities of the
tests. The joint estimation is an extension of the Rogan-Gladen formula.20 The procedure also
accounts for the protocol-induced variation of test-types across participants. Confidence intervals
are obtained by invoking asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimates, with their
covariance matrix being approximated by the inverse of the Fisher information matrix of the
parametric model. Further, weighted adjusted estimates for Karnataka were obtained after
weighing each district’s prevalence estimates by the population fraction in that district. We
computed odds ratios by restricting attention to the relevant subcategories.
To identify the weights on various independent/explanatory variables (symptoms, comorbidities,
etc.) for predicting past infection and active infection, we use multinomial regression to regress the
test outcomes on the independent variables. The procedure can be embedded within the
framework of the generalized linear model with multinomial logit functions along with a custom link
function that accounts for not only the test-type variability across participants but also the tests’
sensitivities and specificities. Important explanatory variables are captured using the Wald test.
The details are given in the supplementary material provided.

RESULTS
Of the 16585 people surveyed in the different risk categories, we present the results for 15624
individuals whose RAT plus RT-PCR and COVID Kavach ELISA antibody test results have been linematched (Appendix C). A total of 16585 IgG results were provided. The results of 513 were not
considered due to missing information and the inability to match the participant in the database;
448 entries were further not mapped to the line-list because of manual data-entry errors or because
data was not retrievable from the ICMR portal. Also, 18 IgG samples were inconclusive (Figure 1 in
Supplementary Material/Appendix C).
IgG prevalence: The overall weighted adjusted seroprevalence of IgG is 16 ·4% (95% CI: 15 ·1 –
17 ·7). This was as of 03 September 2020 and at the state level, obtained after adjusting for the serial
sensitivities and specificities of all tests (Table 1).
Active infection: We estimate that 12 ·7% (95% CI: 11 ·5—13 ·9) of the seemingly unsuspected
participants in the general population, or an estimated 89,88,313 (95% CI: 81,39,023—98,37,602)
people, were having active infection (as on 16 September 2020). This is based on the numbers that
tested positive on RT-PCR/RAT and after taking into account the IgG outcomes and the serial
sensitivities and specificities of all tests (Table 1).
Overall COVID-19 prevalence: The overall adjusted prevalence of COVID-19 at the state level was 27
·3% (95% CI: 25 ·7 – 28 ·9) as of 16 September 2020 (combined IgG and active infection (Table 1)).
Stratifications: The seroprevalence of IgG among males and females were similar, but the active
infection was higher in males than females (15 ·5% vs · 8 ·4%) (Table 1, Figure 4). Thus, the overall
prevalence was higher in males than in females (29 ·8% vs. 21 ·9%). Estimates of both
seroprevalence and total prevalence were higher in the elderly population and low among the lessthan-30-years-old population (Figure 5). The high-risk population had a higher prevalence (31 ·7%

(CI: 29 ·1 – 34 ·2)), followed by the moderate-risk population (25 ·4% (CI: 23 ·0 – 27 ·8)) and then the
low-risk population (20 ·7 (CI: 18 ·4 – 23 ·0)) (Table 1 and Figure 4).
Case-to-infection ratio (CIR): At the state level, it is estimated that for every RT-PCR confirmed case
detected, there were 40 undetected infected individuals as of 16 September 2020 (Table 3 and
Figure 6). This is estimated by using 484,954 reported number of cases in Karnataka1 and the
adjusted prevalence of COVID-19 (27 ·3%) against SARS-CoV-2. The cases-to-infections ratio ranges
from 10 to 111 across units.
Infection fatality rate (IFR): As of 03 September 2020, the IFR due to COVID-19 in Karnataka is
estimated as 0 ·05%, with more than half the units (21 out of 38) above state IFR. The highest was
estimated in the Dharwad district (0 ·23%) (Table 3 and Figure 6).
District/unit variations across the state: The IgG prevalence was highest in Vijayapura district
(23 ·9%) and lowest in Bagalkot di s tri ct (4 ·1%). The state capital Bengaluru had an IgG
prevalence of 22% (95% CI: 19 ·1 – 24 ·9). The active infection was highest in Ballari (34 ·5%)
and lowest in Bidar (0 ·7%). Bengaluru’s active infection was an estimated 9 ·2% (95% CI: 7 ·1 11 ·3). The overall COVID-19 prevalence was lowest in Dharwad district (8 ·7%) and highest in Ballari
district (43 ·1%) (Table 2, Figures 7 and 8). The overall COVID-19 prevalence in Bengaluru was
estimated to be 29 ·8% (95% CI: 26 ·5 - 33). Within Bengaluru itself (with N = 3617 samples), we
estimated that BBMP West had the highest IgG against SARS-CoV-2 and prevalence of COVID-19.
In contrast, BBMP Mahadevapura had the least (Figures 7 and 9, and Supplementary Table 1). Again,
BBMP RR Nagar had the highest active infection within Bengaluru, and BBMP East had the lowest
(Figure 7, Supplementary material Table 1). Districts with high cases infections ratio (more
than 40) are Vijayapura, Belgaum, Chitradurga, Tumakuru, Raichur, Ramanagar, Haveri,
Chamarajanagar, Bidar, Davanagere, Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Kolar, Kodagu, Mandya, Chikmagalur,
Ballari, Bengaluru Rural, Hassan (Table 3 and Figure 6). To summarize in a sentence, there is
differential exposure to the disease across the state (Figure 8).
Explanatory variables: A generalized linear model-based multinomial regression indicated that
nausea, headache, chest-pain, rhinorrhoea, cough, sore throat, muscle ache, fatigue, chills, and fever
are significant variables that predict active infection (p-value < 0 ·05 for a Wald test). Fever is the
most significant variable for predicting active infection among the symptoms. Additional variables
that predict active infection are attendance at the Out-patient Department (OPD) of the hospitals
and contact with COVID-19 positive patients (again with p-value < 0 ·05 for the Wald test). Diarrhea,
chest-pain, rhinorrhea, and fever predict the presence of IgG antibodies to some extent, with
diarrhea having the highest weight among the three. Additional variables that predict the presence

of IgG are professions that involve greater contact with the public (bus conductors or auto drivers,
vegetable vendors), residence in containment zones, time since the first 50 cases in the district, and
the level of the district’s and the taluk’s urbanization (Figure 10 and Table 4).
We found that the RAT is more sensitive on symptomatic individuals since 543 were positive out of
798 RT-PCR-confirmed infected participants with symptoms yielding a sensitivity of 68 ·0% versus
348 being positive out of 742 RT-PCR-confirmed infected participants without symptoms yielding a
sensitivity of 46 ·9%.
DISCUSSION
This is the first study in India, and probably elsewhere, that jointly estimates the proportions of
people who already had the SARS-CoV-2 Infection (IgG antibody positive) and who currently have
an active infection (RT-PCR / RAT positive).
The study has several additional strengths. First, we conducted the study throughout the state of
Karnataka using the sentinel sites, thereby leveraging the state’s comprehensive surveillance
platform. The sampling frame serves as a reference standard and can be used for populationrepresentative surveillance in the future. Second, we used a serological test for IgG with high
sensitivity (0 ·921) and specificity (0 ·977), thereby yielding a better predictive value for a positive
test. Lastly, we assessed the prevalence in the key subgroups of populations with differential risk of
contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
An estimation of the IgG prevalence alone would have assessed the state's burden at 16 ·4%
prevalence. In contrast, the dual assessment of viral markers and antibodies gave us not only the
IgG prevalence but also evidence of active infection of 12 ·7% and a total COVID-19 burden of 27
·3%. This significantly larger estimate calls for an entirely different response from the state and
highlights our survey's benefits. We reported that 1 ·8% (95% CI: 1 ·2 – 2 ·3) of the population
shows both viral RNA and IgG antibodies. The IgG antibodies form 14-21 days after exposure to the
virus, while the RT-PCR test will likely return positive between 7-21 days after exposure. The
correlates and implications of the simultaneous presence of viral RNA and IgG antibodies might
require further examination in future studies.
Across risk-groups, the elderly and those with comorbidities had a higher prevalence of COVID-19,
21-23

suggesting that they are at higher risk of contracting the infection . Despite similar exposure,

higher prevalence in them offers the possibility of infection with lower viral dose or that the
younger age groups mounted a protective immune response.

The reported IFR due to COVID-19 of 0 ·05% is likely an underestimate, and a function of how
well the districts report death data in the state. Studies worldwide found that the IFR of COVID-19
ranged from 0 ·17% to 4 ·16%.24-26 The low IFR reported in our study concurs with similar results in
India and Asia, including China and Iran.27-29 A systematic review of published literature until July
2020 reported the IFR across populations as 0 ·68% (0 ·53%–0 ·82%).7 The IFR reported in the
survey matches the reported estimates in Mumbai (0 ·05-0 ·10%), Pune (0 ·08%), Delhi (0 ·09%),
and Chennai (0 ·13%).5,12,13,30 Districts with low CIR suggest that this might be the actual
proportion by which we might be missing cases in Karnataka.
Our regression analysis determined which symptoms accurately predict active and past infections.
Among the symptoms, we found that diarrhea, chest pain, rhinorrhea, and fever predict the
presence of past Infection (IgG antibodies). This suggests that COVID-19 may have consequences
that last beyond the active infection period. Diarrhea might suggest that the gastrointestinal tract
manifestations might stay longer and might have implications to explore oral vaccines. We also
found that ILI symptoms and history of contact with a COVID-19 positive patient can predict active
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The low-risk participants being recruited from hospitals may suggest the existence of a bias in the
estimate. The protocol mitigated this by sampling systematically only among pregnant women and
attendees of OPD. These participants are likely to have come from afar, thus providing information
on prevalence outside the immediate hospital vicinity. The sampling from the congregate settings in
the neighborhood of the hospital was made systematic to reduce sampling bias. The elderly and
those with comorbidities were to be taken from an elderly list (from the census) and a list (compiled
in April 2020) of vulnerable individuals with non-communicable diseases. Any deviation from the
protocol would have introduced a bias. Hence, we used a design effect of 3 to account for these
factors.
The low sensitivity and cost of RAT consideration led to a survey design in which the low-risk
participants were not administered the RAT. Further, due to logistical issues, serum samples from
one of the taluk hospitals were not available, and the corresponding participants had no antibody
test outcomes. Our statistical methodology was designed to handle these issues and make the best
use of all the available data.
The progress of the pandemic has been non-uniform, given the wide variation of COVID-19 burden
from 8 ·7% to 43 ·1% across various regions of the state. Regions with low IgG prevalence require a
targeted public health response. A revision in the testing strategy may be required in districts with
high CIR. Given the predictive power of specific symptom complexes for active infection, the state

should employ syndromic surveillance to detect active transmission areas. The high sensitivity of
the RAT in symptomatic participants indicates that it is better-suited as a point-of-care test when
people present themselves with symptoms.
In conclusion, our comprehensive survey and analysis provide insights on the state of the pandemic
in the different districts of Karnataka and the varying levels of prevalence across the different
stratifications based on age, gender, and risk. We also provide important epidemiological metrics
such as IFR, CIR and their variation across geographical regions and population strata (Figure 11).
Indeed, establishing district-level facility-based surveillance to systematically monitor the trend of
Infection in the long term to inform local decision-making at the district level would facilitate and
augment the necessary public health response towards the COVID-19 epidemic in Karnataka. It also
helps identify regions with high severity of the disease, identify at-risk populations, and enable
evidence-based intervention and resource allocation to manage the pandemic effectively.
Repetition of the survey can better inform changes in the extent and speed of transmission and help
evaluate the potential impact of containment strategies over time in different parts of the state.
Above all, this study's findings hold significant potential to improve clinical management and guide
public health interventions to reduce the burden of COVID-19 in India and other lower and middleincome countries.
CONTRIBUTORS
The survey was a collaborative effort of the Department of Health and Family Welfare, National
Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences , Indian Institute of Public Health - Bangalore, Indian

Figure 2: Schema for different tests in the survey, Round 1, Karnataka state.
A total of 16,416 participants assigned to 38 units across the state targeted 432 participants per unit. Within the units, the 432 were divided into 144 participants
from each risk-group – low risk, moderate risk, and high risk. Only the RT-PCR and antibody tests were conducted for the low risk group. All three tests were
conducted for the moderate and high risk groups. In the event RAT being positive, the RT-PCR tests were not conducted for the participants. The estimated number
of RT-PCR tests, Antigen tests, and IgG antibody tests were 12040, 10944, and 16416, respectively.

23

1. Check eligibility

2. Take informed consent

3. Registration
a. Register in RTPCR app and generate SRF ID
b. Fill the lab format and survey app and record SRF ID

4. Categories

Low risk (At health facility level)
Pregnant women, OPD attendees

5a. Samples collected in low risk
1. RT-PCR test:
 Nasopharyngeal swab and
Oropharyngeal swab is collected in
same VTM.
2. IgG antibody test:
 Venous Blood sample is collected
and separate serum at health

Moderate Risk (At community level)
Person with high contact in community

High Risk (At community level)
Elders and persons with comorbid conditions

5b. Samples collected in moderate and high
1. Rapid Antigen test: Nasopharyngeal swab from right nostril
2. RT-PCR test: Nasopharyngeal swab from left nostril and Oropharyngeal swab is collected in same VTM
3. IgG antibody test: Venous Blood sample is collected and serum is separated at health facility.

6. Rapid antigen test result
If Rapid Antigen Test is positive, it is considered as Confirmed Positive (discard the sample collected for RT PCR) and
manage the positive COVID case as per protocol
If Rapid Antigen Test is negative, send sample for RT PCR test for reconfirmation.

7. Labeling, Packing & Transportation of Samples
Check the tube to ensure no leakage, label VTM tube for RT PCR testing with name, age, gender & SRF ID.
Label the serum vials for IgG antibody testing with name, age, gender & the last six digits of SRF ID.
Seal the neck of the specimen containing VTM/ serum vials with parafilm.
Transport RT- PCR and IgG antibody test samples using the standard triple packaging system at 4 -8°C to the mapped ICMR testing lab.

8. Result Entry
Rapid Antigen test: Positive & Negative results should be entered to ICMR portal, Lab format and the Survey app at the Health Facility.
RT-PCR test & IgG antibody test: Results to be entered by the district level staff in the Survey App after receiving from ICMR lab.

Presence of viral RNA

Presence of IgG antibodies

Figure 10: Weights and error bars on a subset of independent variables in a multinomial regression whenever the p-value is lower than 0.05.
The abscissa lists the independent variables (symptoms and other factors). The ordinate refers to the weight assigned by the multinomial regression for those selected by the
Wald test. The blue bar’s height represents the predictive power for presence of viral RNA. The orange bar is for predicting presence of IgG antibodies. The black error line
indicates one standard error.

32

Figure 11: Scatter plot of CIR versus IFR. The size of the point indicates the IgG prevalence in the units.
The horizontal and the vertical lines intersect at Karnataka's IFR and CIR. We move clock-wise from the upper-left quadrant. A unit in the upper-left quadrant with a larger
green disk has high IgG antibody prevalence, low IFR, and high CIR. Such a unit is missing cases and deaths. A unit with a larger green disk in the upper-right quadrant has
high IgG antibody prevalence, high IFR, and high CIR. Such a unit is also likely missing cases, but death reporting is better than average. A unit with a larger green disk in
the bottom-right quadrant has high IgG antibody prevalence, high IFR, and low CIR. Such a unit has done well in identifying cases and has better-than-average reporting of
deaths. A unit with a larger green disk in the bottom left has low IFR and low CIR. Such a unit has seen a surge in cases, but has done well in identifying cases, and has low
fatality rates perhaps due to good clinical practices that could be studied and replicated elsewhere.
