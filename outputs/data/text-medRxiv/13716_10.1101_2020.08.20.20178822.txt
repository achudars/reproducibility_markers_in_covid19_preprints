Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to detrimentally impact the United States. Using a survey,
we collected demographic and COVID-19 risk perception, behavior, knowledge, and attitude
data from 672 adults across the U.S. in May 2020. These variables were compared with the
results from a survey in February 2020. Participants who were older (55+ years; M = 6.3, SD =
2.0), identified as Native American/Alaska Native (M = 6.8, SD = 1.0) or Asian (M = 6.0, SD =
2.0), and those who had contracted (M = 6.8, SD = 2.0) or knew someone who had contracted
COVID-19 (M = 6.2, SD = 1.7) reported higher perceived risk. Health behaviors, such as
physical distancing, have shown to impact infectious disease trajectories. As the U.S. reopens its
economy, public health officials and politicians must formulate culturally appropriate and
evidence-based messaging and policies, based on the public’s COVID-19 risk perceptions, to
encourage preventive behaviors.
Introduction
In less than six months, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become the
most challenging global health pandemic since the 1918 flu.1 Despite local and state
governments implementing measures to reduce the spread of the virus, the COVID-19 pandemic
continues to threaten human life and the immediate return to normalcy. As of August 20, 2020,
the U.S. leads the world in confirmed cases (5.5 million; 1.7% of U.S. population) as well as
total number of confirmed deaths (175,000).2 Although many Americans are following the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) COVID-19 guidelines, such as physical
distancing, wearing a mask, and frequent hand washing, others have decided to forgo these safe
and protective measures.3 Americans typically make health decisions by weighing risk for
consequences with benefits of action, which necessitates understanding risk perception trends
across the country.4 This need is further elevated because the number of COVID-19 cases and
deaths continues to rise in the U.S. Understanding the societal and cultural factors that drive
public health risk perception and associated health outcomes, therefore, becomes a high priority.
Studies conducted on previous pandemics demonstrate strong evidence on how compliance with
health behaviors recommended by public health officials can significantly influence the
trajectory of an outbreak.5-13 With COVID-19 vaccines currently under development and not
likely to be available for at least several months,14 U.S. public health officials and politicians
must evaluate the public’s risk perceptions of COVID-19 to formulate strategic messaging and
policies in hopes of increasing safe health behaviors and effectively controlling the COVID-19
pandemic. Additionally, while all Americans are impacted by COVID-19, vulnerable
populations are facing a disproportionate burden of cases and deaths.15 Due to social and
structural determinants of health and inequitable access to healthcare,16 current data show the
most alarming disparities are observed among low-socioeconomic populations and African
American, Hispanic, and Native American communities.17-22 While considering this nuance,
public health and political leaders must also develop culturally competent messaging strategies,
especially given the medical community’s history with conducting unethical studies within
underrepresented communities,23 that cater to vulnerable populations to mitigate these outcomes
and promote health equity.

As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve and the U.S. begins to gradually reopen its
economy, the purpose of our study is to understand the social and cultural factors that influence
COVID-19 risk perception among the adult U.S. population and how it has changed from the
early months of the pandemic. This will provide the public health community with the necessary
information needed to better inform messaging interventions.
Results
Demographic Differences in Risk Perception
The sample consisted of 672 out of 938 eligible adults (completion rate: 72%). The sample was
fairly representative of the U.S. population in terms of age, gender, race, ethnicity, and education
(Table 1). The majority of participants were non-Hispanic white (n = 436, 65%) and had a
college or graduate degree (n = 351, 52%). The average risk perception score was 5.9 (SD = 2.0).
When compared to results from our February 2020 survey, participants from the May survey
perceived they were at higher risk (MD = 0.91, p < 0.01) of contracting the coronavirus.
However, risk perception varied based on several different factors (Table 1). Older adults had a
high risk perception score (M = 6.3, SD = 2.0; Table 1) Additionally, participants who reported
being sick COVID-19 had a high risk perception score (M = 6.8, SD = 2.0; Table 1).
A multivariable linear regression analysis supported these descriptive findings. When controlling
for other variables, adults over 55 years of age reported higher risk perception than younger
adults (β = 0.9, p = 0.01; S Table 1). Participants who reported being Native American/Alaska
Native (β = 1.54, p = 0.03) and Asian (β = 0.87, p = 0.02) also reported increased risk perception
compared to participants who reported being Black/African American (S Table 1). Finally,
participants who knew someone who had been sick with COVID-19 in the past or at the time the
survey was conducted had an increased risk perception score compared to those who did not. (β
= 0.55, p = 0.01; S Table 1).
Knowledge
Approximately 93% (n = 627) of our sample reported that they were aware of the COVID-19
pandemic. When asked to rate their own knowledge about COVID-19, 72% (n = 481) of our
sample said they had good or very good knowledge about COVID-19 compared to 4% (n = 24)
who said they had poor or very poor knowledge about COVID-19. When we conducted this
survey in February 2020, 39% (n = 281) of our sample said they had good or very good
knowledge about COVID-19, and 17% (n = 119) said they had poor or very poor knowledge
about COVID-19 (p < 0.01).
When asked about whether there was a cure or a vaccine for COVID-19, 81% of our sample (n =
541) correctly answered that there currently was not. However, of the 13% who answered
incorrectly, 9% (n = 61) thought there was a curative treatment, and 4% (n = 26) thought there
was a vaccine. When asked where they learned about the curative treatment or vaccine, around
50% of participants said they got their information from the media on television (treatment: 48%,
n = 29; vaccine: 54%, n = 14).
A knowledge score was calculated based on 18-items. On average, the participants from the
second survey administered in May scored higher on the knowledge questions compared to the
participants from the first survey administered in February (MD = 0.85, p < 0.01; Figure 1).

Infection Prevention Policy and Practices
Strict policies for infection prevention including quarantine, travel restrictions, closing
community facilities, and cancelling major events were endorsed by most participants (Table 2).
Participants that agreed or strongly agreed with these policies had a higher risk score than
participants who disagreed with these policies (Table 2). Interestingly, 36% of participants
agreed or strongly agreed that non-violent inmates should be released from jail or prison to
decrease crowding and slow the pandemic (Table 2). Those who agreed with releasing inmates
had a higher risk perception score (M = 6.4, SD = 1.8) than those who disagreed (M = 5.6, SD =
2.1). Additionally, risk perception was higher (M = 6.2, SD = 1.9) in the 30% of participants who
agreed that in the case of a pandemic it is reasonable to “temporarily discriminate” against a
community based on their country of origin than in the 70% (M = 5.7, SD = 2.1) who did not
agree with this statement.
Most participants reported it was easy to follow the CDC public health recommendations (n =
395, 59%). For the 115 participants (17%) who reported it was hard to follow the CDC
guidelines, the most common reasons were “We don’t know how long this pandemic is going to
last” and “I’m classified as an essential worker” (Table 3). Excluding the use of facemasks, over
90% of our sample reported following CDC guidelines for infection prevention (S Figure 1). For
facemasks specifically, 85% (n = 571) of our sample reported using them.
Participants who practiced or planned on buying extra medicines, food and other everyday items,
and disinfectants had a statistically significant higher risk perception as compared to those who
did not (S Table 2).
Public Health and the Economy
Regardless of employment status, most participants agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic has
severely damaged the economy (n = 566, 84%) and that slowing the spread of COVID-19 is
more important than the economy (n = 457, 68%). Additionally, 70% (n = 473) of participants
said that public health should be prioritized over opening the economy (S Table 3).
Confidence in Sources of Information and Leadership
Overall confidence in healthcare professionals (M = 4.2, SD = 1.1) and health officials (M = 4.2,
SD = 1.2) was high, and confidence in social media was low (M = 2.9, SD = 1.5; S Figure 2).
With respect to the COVID-19 pandemic specifically, participants reported high confidence in
information from health professionals (M = 4.2, SD = 1.0) and their own physician (M = 4.2, SD
= 1.1; S Figure 2). Participants reported the lowest confidence in COVID-19 pandemic
information from the White House (M = 2.9, SD = 1.6) and Congress (M = 2.8, SD = 1.4; S
Figure 2). When compared to the survey administered in February 2020, there was significant
reduction in the reported confidence levels for CDC, DHHS, NIH, and other professional
organizations such as AMA (S Table 4).
We asked participants to rank who they wanted the U.S. COVID-19 response to be led by, and
35% (n = 237) of participants ranked the president as their first choice to lead the pandemic
response (S Figure 3). This is in contrast the survey results in February 2020 where 13% (n = 91)
of participants wanted the president to lead the response, (p < 0.01). Comparatively, 17% (n =

117) of participants wanted the CDC to lead the response, in contrast to the 53% (n = 382) who
wanted the CDC to lead the response when surveyed in February (p < 0.01; S Figure 3).
As sensitivity analysis, we carried out a weighted analysis for COVID-19 risk perception using
U.S. demographics. Data for weighted analysis were extracted from U.S. Census data.24
Weighting by age, gender, and race decreased the mean risk perception score from 5.9 to 5.2 and
increased the percentage of population that supports “temporary discrimination” based on
nationality from 30 to 38.
Discussion
While COVID-19 risk perceptions are high among the U.S. adult population, there is a great deal
of variability among different demographic groups. Additionally, compared to our previous
survey conducted in February 2020, a greater proportion of participants reported having an above
average perceived knowledge about COVID-19. Although currently there are treatments, such as
dexamethasone and remdesivir, that improve outcomes in patients experiencing COVID-19, at
the time the survey was conducted there were no scientifically accepted treatments. However,
over 15% of our participants thought there was a curative treatment or vaccine for COVID-19
and learned this information from television media. This finding is concerning and likely due to
the increased level of misinformation and inconsistent messaging among various news outlets.25
Therefore, our study demonstrates the continued need for targeted messaging about appropriate
infection prevention and protective measures. Understanding COVID-19 risk perception and
knowledge may help public health agencies anticipate and address potential barriers to
preventive behavior to avert thousands of more infections and deaths by COVID-19.26
There is strong evidence that a perceived lack of consistent information during a crisis may lead
to distrust, lack of confidence, and fear among the public.27 While 35% of our participants
ranked the president as their first choice to lead the pandemic response, participants reported the
lowest confidence in COVID-19 pandemic information from the White House and Congress.
Confidence in healthcare professionals and health officials was the highest; however, there was a
significant reduction in the reported confidence level in the CDC compared to the February 2020
survey. These findings may be due to the contradicting COVID-19 information and lack of
immediate response to the crisis from the White House, Congress, and CDC.28 The White House,
Congress, and public health organizations, especially the CDC, must agree on the information
being communicated to the public and be transparent with the American people to ensure trust in
public health and governmental authorities.
There is great responsibility on politicians and healthcare leaders to create messaging that is clear
and consistent, as well as evidenced-based and culturally competent. However, currently, there is
evidence that non-Asian Americans’ fear visiting local communities with higher concentration of
Asian Americans, which is reflected in their hesitance in ordering from Asian-owned eateries.29
This may be a result of fear in a subgroup of the population that there are greater chances of
contracting COVID-19 from Asian-Americans than non-Asian Americans. Moreover, this notion
is fueled by political leaders who repeatedly claim that China is responsible for the pandemic.30
Our finding that 30% of our participants agreed that it is reasonable to “temporarily
discriminate” against a community based on their country of origin in the case of a pandemic

supports this; those who agreed with “temporary discrimination” reported a higher risk
perception than those who disagreed.
Irrespective of employment status, 68% of our participants agreed that slowing the spread of
COVID-19 was more important than the economic disruption. Furthermore, most of our sample
supported the closure of community facilities and schools as well as the cancellation of large
social events. This contrasts with the common narrative depicted by the media that most
Americans are against the lockdown, and in doing so, the media may be spreading a narrative not
supported by the majority.31 Messaging strategies must build awareness and knowledge of risks
and benefits of prevention methods, especially considering that 17% of our participants reported
having difficulties following the CDC COVID-19 guidelines. These participants mostly
consisted of workers classified as essential or those unable to pay their bills, which also reflects
the detrimental economic impact of COVID-19. Public health leaders and politicians must
identify areas of citizens’ concerns and alleviate them through targeted messaging, and strongly
consider providing more financial support for Americans.
Our findings may be influenced by possible selection bias because participants needed a
CloudResearch account and access to a smartphone or computer to participate. We had a
response rate of 72% and our data are fairly representative of the U.S. adult population. Another
strength of our study includes timeliness. This is also one of the first studies that looks at detailed
COVID-19 risk perceptions and associated health behaviors. Moreover, due to it being a
longitudinal study, we were able to identify changes in risk perception, behavior, attitude, and
messaging needs among the U.S. adult population since the beginning of the COVID-19
pandemic.
Consistent with previous literature, our study calls on the importance of building trust and
understanding the risk perception landscape among the U.S. public. It also highlights the need
for evidence-based messaging of recommended prevention measures to mitigate crises during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
Participants and procedure
Data were collected using an electronic questionnaire via Qualtrics® (Qualtrics, Provo, UT). In
early May 2020, participants completed a questionnaire on CloudResearch.32 CloudResearch is
an online survey platform that allows for representative surveying. The goal of our sampling was
to be representative of the U.S. general population based on age, gender, education, race and
ethnicity. Participants were eligible if they were 18 years of age or older, could read English, and
had a CloudResearch account with access to the internet via computer or smartphone.
Participants received compensation in the amount they agreed to with the platform through
which they entered this survey.
Measures
Basic demographic information was collected as well as zip code, state of residence, and
employment status. Participants also completed the perceived risk scale (Cronbach’s α =0.72)
which had 10 survey-items (5-point Likert Scale: 0 = strongly disagree/disagree/neutral; 1 =
agree/strongly agree). Variables used for risk perception score calculation are shown in S Table
5. Participants were removed from score calculation if they selected “don’t know” to one or more

of the items on the risk perception scale. For scoring, variables collected on Likert Scale were
dichotomized as: 0 = strongly disagree/disagree/neutral; 1 = agree/strongly agree. Additionally,
participants were asked about their knowledge of COVID-19, effective preventive measures,
measures being practiced, confidence and the reliability of sources of information regarding the
COVID-19 pandemic (5-point Likert Scale: 1 = strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree), support
for restrictive infection prevention policies, and impact of COVID-19 on their employment and
behavior. Finally, participants were asked to rank who they thought should lead the U.S.
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The full survey instrument is included as a supplement.
This survey instrument was adapted from McFadden et al14 and COSMO standard protocol for
WHO.33
A knowledge score consisting of 17 survey-items was constructed by adding all the points for
correct items for each participant (Cronbach’s α = 0.78; S Table 6). For scoring, variables
collected on Likert Scale were dichotomized as: 0 = strongly disagree/disagree/neutral; 1 =
agree/strongly agree.
To compare the current risk perception and calculate change over time, we used data collected
from a similar survey in early February 2020. Details of this study are reported here.34
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages) were calculated for the sample demographic
characteristics, trust, attitude, and behavior of the participants. T-test and one-way ANOVA for
continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical variables were used to compare the
change in risk perception, knowledge, attitude, and behavior between the surveys in February
and May 2020 using variables collected at both time points.
To test the associations between demographic factors and exposure to COVID-19 with COVID19 risk perception, a multi-variable linear regression analysis was used.
Data were analyzed using Stata Version 16 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).
Ethical Approval
