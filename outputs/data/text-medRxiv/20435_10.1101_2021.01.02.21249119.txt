Abstract
Background: Population mobility is closely associated with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)
transmission, and it could be used as a proximal indicator to predict future outbreaks, which
could inform proactive non-pharmaceutical interventions for disease control. South Carolina (SC)
is one of the states which reopened early and then suffered from a sharp increase of COVID-19.
Objective: To examine the spatial-temporal relationship between population mobility and
COVID-19 outbreaks and use population mobility to predict daily new cases at both state- and
county- levels in SC.
Methods: This longitudinal study used disease surveillance data and Twitter-based population
mobility data from March 6 to November 11, 2020 in SC and its top five counties with the
largest number of cumulative confirmed cases. Daily new case was calculated by subtracting the
cumulative confirmed cases of previous day from the total cases. Population mobility was
assessed using the number of users with travel distance larger than 0.5 mile which was calculated
based on their geotagged twitters. Poisson count time series model was employed to carry out the
research goals.
Results: Population mobility was positively associated with state-level daily COVID-19
incidence and those of the top five counties (i.e., Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg,
Richland). At the state-level, final model with time window within the last 7-day had the
smallest prediction error, and the prediction accuracy was as high as 98.7%, 90.9%, and 81.6%
for the next 3-, 7-, 14- days, respectively. Among Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg,
and Richland counties, the best predictive models were established based on their observations in
the last 9-, 14-, 28-, 20-, and 9- days, respectively. The 14-day prediction accuracy ranged from
60.3% to 74.5%.

Conclusions: Population mobility was positively associated with COVID-19 incidences at both
state- and county- levels in SC. Using Twitter-based mobility data could provide acceptable
prediction for COVID-19 daily new cases. Population mobility measured via social media
platform could inform proactive measures and resource relocations to curb disease outbreaks and
their negative influences.

Introduction
Since the first confirmed case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United
States (US) on January 21, 2020, the countrywide COVID-19 outbreaks have surged quickly. As
of December 29, there were 19,566,140 cumulative confirmed cases and 338,769 COVID-19
related deaths in US [1]. South Carolina (SC), a state located in Southeastern US, had the first
confirmed cases on March 6, 2020. From March to May, the trends of daily new cases were flat
with an average of daily increased cases less than 500. However, after the early implementation
of reopening policies, the daily new cases in SC have risen sharply since June. On July 14, the
COVID-19 cases in SC surpassed 60,000, with more than 2,200 daily new cases, the second
highest increase in one day in the US [2]. Between August and October, the transmission rate
slowed down with the further implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such
as dine-in service restriction and face-covering requirement, but increased steadily after October.
By December 29, there were 300,602 reported cases and 5,198 deaths in SC [3]. Given the rapid
transmission of COVID-19 in SC, more research is needed to identify potential early predictors
of increasing transmission rates which could then be used to inform proactive NPIs to suppress
statewide disease transmission.
Population mobility is a potential early indicator of COVID transmission as population
mobility reflects the influences (both positive and negative) of NPIs, reopening actions, social
distancing practices and public holidays [4-6]. For instance, at the early stage of COVID-19
epidemic, the SC Governor issued a series of NPIs, such as shelter-in-place and school and nonessential business closure, to reduce social interaction. These NPIs showed positive effects in
suppressing the statewide COVID-19 spread. Later in May, the reopening policies and public
holidays diluted the implementation of NPIs leading to the increased social interactions and

statewide COVID-19 spread [7,8]. At present, it may be difficult to measure the real-time impact
of reopening policies, public holidays and fidelity of NPIs implementation. Therefore, population
mobility could be a proximal indicator allowing for real-time COVID-19 transmission
forecasting.
Social media platforms, such as Twitter, collect geospatial information and closely
monitor the change of population mobility [9,10]. Indeed, the tremendous volume of usergenerated geoinformation from social media helps promote the real-time or near real-time
surveillance of population mobility and provides timely data on how population mobility
responded to different phases of COVID-19 outbreak, policy reactions, and public holidays [1113]. Several studies have leveraged mobility data from social media (e.g., Google, Facebook,
Twitter) to investigate the relationships between population mobility and COVID-19
transmission [6,8,14-16]. These studies identified a consistently positive relationship between
population mobility and COVID-19 incidence. However, few studies used population mobility as
a predictor to forecast further outbreaks and to evaluate the prediction accuracy in addition to
correlation analysis. One study by Wang and Yamamoto predicted COVID-19 daily new cases in
Arizona using disease surveillance data, Google Community Mobility report, and partial
differential equation. They found acceptable prediction for the next 3-day [16]. This study only
classified Arizona into three regions (i.e., central, northern, southern of Arizona) and evaluated
the prediction accuracy for the next 3-day which did not cover the duration of viral incubation
(i.e., 14-day). More studies are needed to investigate the relationship between population
mobility using social media data and COVID-19 transmission at both state- and county- levels
and over longer timeframes.

Leveraging disease surveillance data and Twitter-based population mobility, the current
study aimed to construct time series models of COVID-19 daily new cases, investigate the
relationship between them, and evaluate the prediction accuracy of daily new cases for the next
two-week window at both state- and county- levels in SC.
Methods
COVID-19 incidence data
Cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 through November 11, 2020 at both state- and
county-levels in SC were collected from The New York Times, which was deposited in Github
[17]. Within the study period (March 6, 2020 [date of 1st COVID diagnosis in SC] to November
11, 2020 [251st day]), daily new cases were calculated by subtracting the cumulative confirmed
cases of previous day from the total cases for the entire state and its five counties with largest
numbers of cumulative confirmed cases (i.e., Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, and
Richland). The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University
of South Carolina.
Population mobility
Population mobility was assessed using the number of people (Twitter users) with
moving distance larger than 0.5 mile per day in SC and the selected counties. The methodology
of extracting daily population movement (origin-destination flows) from geotagged tweets is
discussed elsewhere [18,19]. Briefly, geotagged tweets during the study periods were collected
and used for calculation. Only users who post at least twice a day or posted tweets on at least two
consecutive days were included in the calculation. Daily travel distance was calculated for each
user based on the derived origin-destination flows and used to generate a variable of how many

people moved each day (with travel distance larger than 0.5 mile). This method of capturing
population mobility through Twitter has been previously validated [18].
Statistical analysis
First, daily new cases of COVID-19 and population mobility at both state- and countylevels were described using line charts in R version 3.6.3 (The R Foundation, “ggplot” package).
Daily new cases and mobility were also described using fives quantiles (i.e., minimum, 25th
percentile, 50th percentile, 75th percentile, and maximum) by each month.
Second, Poisson count time series model was used to model the impact of population
mobility on the daily new cases of COVID-19 at state-level. Time series models were built at the
various time windows. At the first round selection, a total of 17 time windows (by a 7-day
increment) were considered including 1 to 7 days, 1 to 14 days,…, and 1 to 119 days. The daily
new cases from the 1st to 234th days were used as the training dataset and those from the next 3day (235th ~ 237th) were used as testing dataset for the purpose of model evaluation. With the
smallest prediction error (Formula 1) and good interpretation, the predictive model with the best
time window was selected. After the best time window in the first round selection was
determined, second and third round selections were conducted to narrow down the time window
and obtain the final model with the smallest prediction error. The final model was used to predict
the COVID-19 daily new cases for the next 3-, 7-, and 14- days (238th ~ 251st days). Cumulative
difference (Formula 2) between observed and predicted cases and mean absolute percentage
accuracy (Formula 3) by each timeframe were reported.16

Finally, a similar analytic procedure was performed to construct the final model at the
county-level for each of the top five counties (i.e., Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg,
and Richland) in SC. Poisson count time series model was conduct using the R package
(“tscount”).
Results
Descriptive statistics
Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of COVID-19 new cases, and Figure 1 shows the
changes of COVID-19 daily new cases at both state- and county-levels. By October 31, there
were 176,612 cumulative COVID-19 confirmed cases in SC. The cumulative confirmed cases in
Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, and Richland were 17,384, 18,021, 12,591, 9,290,
and 17,531, respectively. At the state-level, the daily new cases from March to the end of May
were less than 500. From June to the middle of July, the daily new cases elevated, with 2,217
new COVID-19 patients on July 14. After that, the transmission rate decreased, with most of the
daily new cases less than 1,500. However, since October, the daily new cases steadily increased.
At the county- level, the top five counties showed a similar trend of COVID-19 outbreaks
and accounted for more than 40.0% of the total cases in SC. The daily new cases increased
earlier in Greenville than the other four counties (i.e., Charleston, Horry, Spartanburg, and
Richland).

Trends for population mobility at both state- and county- levels were similar. The
numbers of people in SC (Twitter users in our data) with a moving distance of more than 0.5
mile decreased from 1,400 to 550 between March 6 and April 9, 2020. Although there were
slight increases from the middle of April to that of June, the numbers were consistently around
1,000 after this timeframe. At the county-level, each of the five counties had less than 200 people
with moving distance larger than 0.5 mile after the middle of March. Figure 2 shows the changes
of population mobility at both state- and county- levels.
Model selection of time series analyses
Following the model selection procedure, Poisson count time series model of COVID-19
incidence at the state-level was constructed using daily new cases and population mobility.
Population mobility was positively associated with state-level COVID-19 daily new cases
(β=0.818, 95%CI: 0.761~0.876), and model using the past 7- day (1~7 days) as time window had
the smallest prediction error (Table 2). The prediction error of new cases in the next 3- day (235th
~ 237th) was 0.218.
At the county-level, a similar modelling procedure was employed. Population mobility
was consistently and positively associated with COVID-19 new cases across the top five
counties. The best time windows for Charleston, Greenville, Horry, Spartanburg, and Richland
were 9-, 14-, 28-, 20-, and 9- days, respectively. Table 2 displays the detailed results of final
model, correlation analysis, and 3-day prediction error at both state- and county- levels.
COVID-19 daily new cases forecasting
Table 2 also presents the results of forecasting and prediction accuracy. Using final
models with the selected time windows, COVID-19 daily new cases were forecasted for the next
14-day at both state- and county- levels. At the state- level, the 3-day cumulative difference and

prediction accuracy were 42 and 98.7%, respectively. As compared to the 3-day predication
accuracy, the 7- and 14- day accuracy reduced to 90.9% and 81.6%. At the county- level, among
the top five counties, the 3-day prediction accuracy ranged from 69.0% to 99.3%. The prediction
accuracy deceased in Charleston, Greenville, and Spartanburg with increased time span. In
contrast, the prediction accuracy in Horry and Richland increased in 7-day prediction but
decreased in 14-day prediction. The 14- day prediction accuracy among Horry and Richland
were closer to their values in 3-day prediction.

Discussion
This study leveraged disease surveillance data and Twitter-based population mobility to
test the relationship between mobility and COVID-19 daily new cases and forecast the future
transmission during the next 14 days at both state- and county- levels in SC. Results revealed
that population mobility was significantly and positively associated with new daily COVID-19
cases. Using the selected models to forecast COVID-19 transmission, we found that although the
prediction accuracy at state- level and most of the selected counties decreased as time span
increased, the prediction accuracy remained acceptable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study that combined correlation analysis and forecasting together to investigate the impacts
of population mobility on COVID-19 transmission at both state- and county- levels.
Population mobility could reflect the impacts of NPIs, reopening policies, and public
holidays and estimate the social movement during the current COVID-19 pandemic. It is closely
related to the COVID-19 outbreaks, which is in accordance with that of prior research [6,8,1416]. This study adds value to previous studies by examining the impacts of population mobility
on COVID-19 incidence and evaluate its prediction efficacy at both state- and county- levels in
SC during the two-week window. Although this indicator may only reflect the mobility among
people who used Twitter, the results still revealed the positive a correlation between mobility and
COVID-19 transmission.
Additionally, using Twitter-based mobility data to predict daily new COVID-19 cases
could provide acceptable accuracy, which could also justify the validity and prediction efficacy
of this indicator. The high prediction accuracy at the state-level was consistent with Wang’s
finding in Arizona [16]. However, such a high prediction accuracy did not exist at the countylevel. One possible explanation for this finding is that we did not capture or account for the

influences of contextual factors (i.e., population density) and the roles of mitigating factors (e.g.,
wearing face mask, practicing social distancing) [16,20,21]. Additionally, the Twitter-based
mobility did not differentiate the social movement at different locations, such as movement
around parks, workplace, and retail places, which show different impacts on COVID-19
incidence [6]. Furthermore, in this study, we only captured population mobility at state- and
county- levels while population mobility at zip code level might provide more accurate
prediction. Finally, compared with mobility data from other platforms (e.g., Facebook, Google,
Safegraph, Apple), our Twitter-based mobility indicator only estimated how many people with
moving distance larger than a specific value. Nevertheless, the findings generated from this study
confirmed the spatial-temporal relationship between Twitter-based mobility and COVID-19
outbreaks in SC as well as the prediction efficacy of population mobility.
Use of population mobility data has potential implications in future research and practices
to curb COVID-19 outbreaks. From a research perspective, studies on mobility and COVID-19
could be studied at state-, county-, and/or zip code levels. In addition, mobility around different
locations could provide detailed information regarding COVID-19 transmission, identify the
most relevant mobility associated with daily new cases, and inform tailored interventions on
social distancing by different locations to control disease outbreaks. Furthermore, the geospatial
difference in the prediction accuracy of population mobility on daily new cases by county
suggested that contextual factors, such as demographic characteristics and implementation
fidelity of NPIs at county-level, should be accounted for in future research. Finally, since the
incubation and transmission of COVID-19 are closely associated with time-varying factors, such
as temperature and weather, such impacts should be accounted for in forecasting studies [22].
Regarding the practice of disease control and prevention, leveraging social media platform to

monitor daily population mobility could improve the predictions of further COVID-19
transmission, inform proactive NPIs, and guide allocation of healthcare resources to reduce
disease morbidity and mortality [23,24].
Conclusions
Population mobility was positively associated with COVID-19 transmission at both stateand county- levels in SC. Using Twitter-based mobility data could provide acceptable prediction
for COVID-19 daily new cases. The application of social media platforms to monitor population
mobility and predict COVID-19 spread could inform proactive measures to curb disease
outbreaks and plan coordinated responses.
