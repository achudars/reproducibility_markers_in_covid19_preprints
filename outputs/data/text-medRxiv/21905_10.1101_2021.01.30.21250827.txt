Abstract
A logistic formulation in biology is applied to analyze deaths by the third wave of COVID19 in Japan.

Introduction

In previous papers [1], [2] we have proposed a logistic formulation of infection. The logistic
formula is useful in the population problem in biology. It is closely related to the SIR model
[3] in the theory of infection. which is powerful to analyze an epidemic about how it spreads
and how it ends [4-11]. The SIR model is composed of three equations for S, I and R, where
they are numbers for susceptibles, infectives and removed, respectively. Our logistic formula
has been driven approximately from this SIR model. This approximate formula, however, has
a simple form, so that it is very useful to discuss an epidemic.
In this paper, our policy is to use mainly data of deaths by COVID-19 in Japan, but not
so often of cases.
In Sec. 2, we review the derivation of this logistic formula and construct basic equations
used later. In Sec. 3, our logistic formula is applied to the 3rd wave of COVID-19 in Japan.
The final section is devoted to concluding remarks. We attach Appendix for error estimations.

The logistic formula

In previous works [1], [2] we found a logistic formula, which is an approximate one of the SIR
model [3] in the theory of infection. Let us summarize the formula briefly. The third equation
of the SIR model is given by
dR
= I(t′ ) = 1 − R − exp(−αR),
dt′

†

t′ = ct,

where R is the removed number, I(t′ ) the infectious number, α the basic reproduction number,
c the removed ratio and t the true time. There is another function S in the SIR model, which
stands for the susceptible number. Three functions S, I and R are normalized as S +I +R = 1.
Let us expand the exponential factor as, with x = αR, in the second order,
1
exp(−x) = 1 − x + x2 ,
2

(2.2)

Here we have assumed x2 /2 < 1. In this approximation we have
dR
1
= I(t′ ) = 1 − R − (1 − αR + α2 R2 ) = A(B − R)R, .
dt′
2

(2.3)

with A = α2 /2, B = 2(α − 1)/α2 . This equation is a type of that in the logistic growth curve
in Biology, easily solved as
R(t) =

R(∞)
. a = α − 1,
1 + exp (−ac(t − T ))

(2.4)

where AB = α − 1 = a and B = R(∞) = 2(α − 1)/α2 = 2R(T ), T being the peak day of
infection. Inserting this into Eq.(2.1) we get:
I(t) =

aR(∞)
,
2(1 + cosh ac(t − T ))

(2.5)

We make use of data [12] of deaths rather than cases. It is our policy not to use data of
cases. Define the mortality ratio λ by
λ=

D(t)
,
R(t)

(2.6)

where D(t) is the accumulated number of deaths. For the population N , the total number of
deaths at t is given by
N D(t) = λN R(t) =

d
,
1 + exp(−z)

z = ac(t − T )

(2.7)

where d = N D(∞) = λN R(∞) stands for the final total number of deaths. Note that from
Eq.(2.7) we have a theorem, N D(T ) = d/2, which means the total number of deaths at the
peak is just a half of the final ones.
Let us rewrite Eq.(2.7) in a form as
−z = ac(T − t) = ln F (t),

F =

d
−1 .
N D(t)

(2.8)

Accordingly, for diﬀerent times t1 , t2 and t3 we have equations
F (t1 )
,
F (t2 )
F (t2 )
ac(t3 − t2 ) = ln
.
F (t3 )

ac(t2 − t1 ) = ln

(2.9)
(2.10)

When time diﬀerences in Eqs. (2.9) and (2.10) are equal, we get a useful equation for d
F (t1 )F (t3 ) = F (t2 )2 ,

Application to the third wave of COVID-19

Our logistic formula is applied to the 3rd wave of COVID-19 in Japan.

Table 1: Date and the number of deaths in the 3rd wave
t
N D(t)
t1 =Dec. 17 n1 = 1150.143 ± 95.106
t2 =Dec. 31 n2 = 1826.714 ± 106.463
t3 =Jan. 14
n3 = 2673 ± 105.347
N D(t) is the accumulated number of deaths in the 3rd wave at t in Japan, which is an average
of deaths for 7 days in a middle at each t with standard deviations, where t is the date starting
from Oct. 11. We have subtracted the accumulated number of deaths, 1628, in the 1st and
2nd waves, from that in the 1st , 2nd and 3rd waves.
A use is made of data of deaths [12]. Substituting data on the Table 1 into Eq.(2.11), we
get the equation for d
(

d
d
d
− 1)(
− 1) = (
− 1)2 .
1150.143
2673
1826.714

(3.1)

We find a solution of this equation to be d = 5810.410. According to the theorem N D(T ) =
d/2, the number of deaths at the peak t = T is d/2 = 2905.205. The result of d = 5810.410 is
substituted into Eq.(2.9), then it follows that
14ac = ln

4.0519
F (t1 )
= ln
= 0.6195,
F (t2 )
2.1808

(3.2)

hence
ac = 0.04425 ,

(3.3)

ac(T − t3 ) = ln F (t3 ) = ln 1.1737 = 0.1602 .

(3.4)

and
The last equation means T − t3 = 3.62 ≃ 4, hence T =Jan.14 + 4 = Jan.18.
Error estimations for d = 5810.410 and T =Jan.18 (=99) can be seen from Appendix, i.e.,
δd
= 0.0331 .
d

(3.5)

which states δd = 192.3 and δT = −0.2.
To sum up we have
d
= 2905 ± 96.15 ,
2
T = Jan. 18 ± 1 .

(3.6)
(3.7)

In order to fix a, we make use of c = 0.041, which is frequently quoted value. Since
ac = 0.044, we have a = 1.07, that is, α = 1 + a = 2.07. Once having α = 2.07, we can draw
curves of S, I and R by means of Excel in Fig. 1. From this we find t′ = 4.86 at the peak of
I, so that from the formula t′ = ct we get c = t′ /T = 4.86/99 = 0.049. This value c = 0.049 is
slightely diﬀerent from c = 0.041, that is, its error is 16%. About the error we have discussed
in a previous paper [1] that the error of our logistic model against the SIR model is about
15%. Therefore, this diﬀerence may be allowed.

Concluding remarks

We found that the third wave began from Oct. 11 and will peak at around Jan. 18 ± 1, 2021
with total deaths 2905 ± 96. The total number of deaths for the 1st , 2nd and 3rd waves on
the peak is 2905 ± 96 + 1628 = 4593 ± 96. This should be compared with the observed value
4547. The basic reproduction number of the third wave is α = 2.07 with the removed ratio
c = 0.041. Curves of S, I and R are given in Fig. 1
Let us discuss the population related with infectives. Japanese population is divided
into two groups, one is self-isolated and the other is not self-isolated. We can remove the
self-isolated group from the infection route, because it is irrelevant to the infection. The nonisolated group is, therefore, relevant to the infection. We put such a population as N . From
Fig. 1, one can see that
R(Jan. 18) = R(t′ = 4.86) = 0.3520 ,

(4.1)

N R(Jan.18) = accumulated numbers of (deaths +discharged)
= 2919 + 174582 = 177501 = N × 0.3520

yield N = 504264. Therefore, we conclude that the non-isolated population N in the 3rd wave
is about 504,000. We can then estimate the number of infectives on Jan. 18 by formulas
I(Jan.18) = I(t′ = 4.86) = 0.1654 ,

(4.3)

N I(Jan.18) = 504, 000 × 0.1654 = 83362 ≃ 83, 000 .

(4.4)

and
The present number of infectives on Jan. 18 in Japan is about 74,000 and seems to be slightly
lower than the calculated value 83,000.
