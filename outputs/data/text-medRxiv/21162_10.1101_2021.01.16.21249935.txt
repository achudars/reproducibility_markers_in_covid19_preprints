Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has reached almost every corner of the world. Without a pharmaceutical solution,
governments have been forced to implement regulations and public policies to control social behavior and
prevent the spread of the virus. There is dramatic evidence of the social and economic effects of these
measures and their disparate impact on vulnerable communities. Individuals living in urban informal
settlements are in a structurally disadvantaged position to cope with a health crisis such as the COVID-19
pandemic. This paper examines the socioeconomic impact of the crisis brought by the pandemic in informal
settlements in Chile. We use a three-wave panel study to compare the situation in informal settlements
before and during the health crisis. We show that households living in informal settlements are paying a
high toll. Their employment loss is dramatic, substantially larger than the loss reported in the general
population, and has particularly affected the inmigrant population. We also find that the pandemic has
triggered neighborhood cooperation within the settlements. Targeted government assistance programs have
reached these communities; however, this group's coverage is not enough to counteract the magnitude of
the crisis. Our results suggest that governments, the non-profit sector, and the community need to urgently
provide economic support and protections to individuals living in informal settlements and consider this
opportunity for long-term improvements in these marginalized communities.

Introduction
Since early 2020, the world is experiencing a major health and social crisis caused by the COVID-19
pandemic [1]. As of November 5, 2020, more than 50 million cases and 1.2 million deaths have been
reported worldwide [2]. Without a readily available pharmaceutical solution to the COVID-19 crisis,
governments globally have implemented regulations and guidelines to control social behavior and prevent
the spread of the virus [3-5]. Already there is dramatic evidence of the social and economic effects of the
pandemic and the governments’ control measures on the general population [6-12]. Moreover, the
pandemic does not affect every social group in the same way. Studies suggest that the health crisis has
amplified existing disadvantages along racial, ethnic, gender, and socioeconomic lines [13-18].
Individuals living in informal settlements (often called “slums”) are in a structurally disadvantaged
position to cope with a health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic [19-23]. Around one billion people
live in an informal settlement in the global south, a number that has massively increased in the past
decades [24-26]. Informal settlements are heterogeneous places [27]. Their emergence and persistence
respond to different social, economic, and even political dynamics of the cities that host these
communities. [28-30]. They share some common characteristics, however. Informal settlements typically
host vulnerable populations in precarious housing conditions, without tenure security, with insufficient
access to basic services [31].
The labor, urban, and social conditions typically present in informal settlements may cause its residents to
be disproportionally affected during a health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This crisis has the
potential to exacerbate the spatial inequalities represented by these communities. For instance,
governments in many countries have imposed strict lock-down and stay-at-home orders [3,4,32,33].
However, many individuals in informal settlements have informal, precarious jobs, irregular income, no
savings, and need to go out to earn the income they need daily [34-36]. Most governments have also made
individual-level behavioral recommendations, including keeping physical distance, washing hands
frequently, self-quarantines, and sanitizing surfaces. Many of these regulations assume people live in
adequate housing conditions, with sufficient living space and access to basic services, such as water and
sanitation, which is not the case in most, if not all, informal settlements [31,37]. Residents of informal
settlements often develop strong social networks to share social and economic resources, and fight for
their access to public and private services [38,39]. During a health crisis, such as the COVID-19
pandemic, however, the possibilities for social interaction and collaboration are significantly reduced.

In this paper, we examine the socioeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in informal settlements
in Chile. The Ministry of Health reported the first COVID-19 case in the country on March 3rd, and
several epidemic control measures quickly followed [40,41]. Less than three weeks following the first
reported case, the government had announced the closure of schools and universities, national night
curfews, border controls, closure of non-essential businesses, and a strategy of localized lockdowns
starting March 22 in seven municipalities. In mid-May, Greater Santiago (~40% of the Chilean
population) was put under lockdown, and by mid-June, half the population in Chile was under lockdown
[40]. Research suggests that these mitigation strategies significantly slowed down epidemic growth [42]
but generated a large drop in mobility and economic activity [6,43]. The reduction in economic activity
does not affect all social groups in the same way, which calls for research on the impact on vulnerable
populations such as those in informal settlements.
We base our analysis on a three-wave panel (longitudinal) study of households living in Chile's informal
settlements. The baseline was conducted in person in August 2019 (n=5,622). We conducted two
telephone follow-up surveys with a representative subsample of 990 individuals in May and September
2020. The second panel (May) occurred when the government began implementing stay-at-home orders
in many urban areas. We conducted the third panel in September when the government began relaxing
some of the stricter control measures. The data allows us to compare individuals' socioeconomic situation
in informal settlements before the pandemic and at the beginning and the end of the period when strict
regulations were implemented.
The article provides granular data about the changes in the socioeconomic situation of informal
settlements during the pandemic. Our findings show that informal settlements are paying a high toll. Their
employment loss is substantially larger than the loss reported in the general population, even compared to
individuals with low educational levels. We also document that the immigrant population has been
particularly affected during this health crisis. We complement this finding by describing the change in
participation in government programs and the level of collaboration between neighbors that could
potentially attenuate the consequences of employment loss among this particular group of the population.
The pandemic triggered some degree of neighborhood collaboration, although the support neighbors
provide to each other does not persist over time. The government has implemented special financial
support programs (e.g., Bono COVID). However, despite the magnitude of the employment loss, those
programs have not reached most informal settlers. Governments, the non-profit sector, and the community
need to act immediately to provide economic support, urban infrastructure, and protections to individuals

living in informal settlements. Governments need to innovate with policies targeted at the informal sector,
immigrants, and single-headed households. This crisis may also be an opportunity for long-term
improvements in these marginalized communities. The pandemic has worsened the deprivation of
informal dwellers; without action, this may result in a long-term poverty trap for years to come.
The article proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides some contextual information on informal settlements
in Chile. Section 3 describes the data and methods used. Section 4 presents the main findings of the data
analysis. Section 5 discusses the findings and suggests some policy implications.

Context: Informal Settlements in Chile
Relative to other Latin American countries, Chile has a small number of informal settlements. According
to a cadaster conducted by the Ministerio de Vivienda y Urbanismo (44) (Ministry of Housing, MHU) in
2019, there are 802 informal settlements in Chile with 47,050 households. However, there is evidence that
the number of settlements has rapidly increased in the pandemic [45]. The MHU defines these places as
“precarious settlements of eight or more households that inhabit on a piece of land that they possess
irregularly, without at least one of three basic services (electricity, water, and sewer), and where all the
housing units composed a defined social and territorial unity”. The number of informal settlements has
been growing in the last decade, from 657 in 2011 to 802 in 2019 [44]. Most of this increase has occurred
in the country's northern region, which is likely explained by an accelerated migration from neighboring
countries in the last years. Many low-income individuals find a place to live in an informal settlement to
transition to better opportunities in the country. 73% of all informal settlements in Chile are located in
urban areas.
While the emergence of informal settlements in Chile’s urban areas dates back to the late nineteenth
century, they became a relevant political and policy issue in the middle of the twentieth century when
land invasions became politically salient [46-48]. People in those settlements organized to press the
government for permanent housing solutions. Consecutive governments responded to the housing deficit
through housing policies adopted or social programs designed for informal settlements [47,49]. In the
1960s and early 1970s, the public perceived informal settlements as politically organized communities
that provided popular support for progressive social reforms. The democratically elected socialist
government of Salvador Allende (1970-1973) had an ambiguous relationship with these communities,
legitimizing many land invasions. Those years saw a substantial increase in the number of informal

settlements formed in Chilean cities [47]. In a cadastre in 1972, the MHU counted 275 settlements, with
approximately 450,000 individuals nationally [47]. This estimate suggests that, with half the Chilean
population, three times more individuals lived in an informal settlement in 1972 than in 2019.
The military dictatorship (1973-1990) that followed Allende’s government took an aggressive approach
toward informal settlements. The land invasions were particularly problematic for an administration that
put a high value on private property to implement a market-oriented economic transformation. Thousands
of families were forced to move to low-income, segregated housing projects located in the periphery of
Chile’s urban areas [47]. A large-scale socioeconomic urban segregation pattern became the dominant
reality of Chile’s urban development. This socioeconomic spatial segregation persists until today.
Since 1990, democratic governments have addressed housing deficits through a large-scale housing
policy that, to a significant extent, has maintained the institutional architecture of the dictatorship [50,51].
A substantial portion of low and middle-income individuals have obtained access to formal housing
through government programs, including many former residents of informal settlements. From a
quantitative perspective, the success of the policy regime implemented since the 1990s in Chile is clear.
However, a substantial failure of Chile’s housing policy has been the agglomeration of low-income
individuals in segregated urban areas [52-54].
Chile has set up a policy scheme that has provided a substantial portion of informal settlers with a formal
housing unit that they own [39]. However, the number of informal settlements has been growing in the
past decade [49]. This growth, particularly in the north of Chile, may be partly explained by a growing
influx of low-income migration from neighboring countries. Another reason relates to the dramatic
increase in the price of urban land in many Chilean cities, which makes the government’s subsidies
ineffective [49]. Housing quality and location have become increasingly important for families living in
informal settlements [39]. Recent studies have suggested that for some essential dimensions of urban
welfare, households living in informal settlements have access to a better geography of opportunities than
those living in low-income housing projects where they own their dwellings [55,56]. These improved
opportunities may reveal a mismatch between the government’s housing options for the low-income
population and the actual expectations of those seeking access to formal housing, including those living in
informal settlements.
Although living in an informal settlement involves tenure insecurity, insufficient access to basic services,
and precarious housing conditions, for many residents these communities are perceived as a temporary

stop as the family seeks a permanent, formal housing solution that would meet their social and economic
demands. The COVID-19 pandemic can add another obstacle to the already complicated socioeconomic
situation of the settlement dwellers.

Data and Methods
We collected data in collaboration with TECHO-Chile (Techo), the Chilean branch of the largest Latin
American non-governmental organization working with residents of informal settlements in the region.
Our analysis is based on a three-wave panel (longitudinal) study of households living in Chile's informal
settlements. The baseline survey was conducted in person in August 2019 and obtained data from 5,622
household heads on different dimensions related to their life in the settlement.i
To examine the socioeconomic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on informal dwellers, we conducted
two telephone follow-up surveys with a representative random subsample of the total individuals
interviewed at baseline. The first wave was conducted by phone in May and collected information on 990
households. The second wave was implemented in September and reached a total of 703 households from
the first wave. Therefore, we built a panel of 703 individuals that were surveyed at three different
moments over eleven months. Table 2 examines the balance across the three waves. The attrition rate was
around 29% from wave two to wave three. However, based on the observable characteristics identified in
2019, the three waves are not significantly different in almost all observable categories (see
supplementary material Table S2).
We aim to measure the changes in a set of outcomes over time. We exploit the individual-level panel data
to analyze how each of the outcomes has changed over time. We estimate equation (1) as follows:
𝑦𝑖𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽1 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡1 + 𝛽2 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡2 + 𝛾𝑖 + 𝜖𝑖𝑡

(1)

Where 𝛽1 and 𝛽2 are our coefficients of interest and represent the change in the outcome observed in May
and September, 2020 respectively. In most specifications, we include an individual fixed effect (𝛾𝑖 ) that
controls for all time-invariant characteristics that may affect the different outcomes. We also discuss the
robustness of the results to the inclusion of individual fixed effects. We analyze the evolution over time of
outcomes related to employment status, cooperation among neighbors, and government assistance.

For employment status, we examine the magnitude of the results relative to other employment surveys.
We carefully compare our results to different population groups from the ENE-Survey. ENE is the main
employment survey run by Chile’s National Institute of Statistics, and we exploit individual microdata to
examine the employment evolution during the same period.ii We further examine the results for a
particular subset of individuals available in the sample. In particular, we look at whether or not the results
are driven by some underlying conditions related to informal dwellers that make them particularly
vulnerable to the type of crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Results
We present two sets of results that allow us to provide robust information about the socioeconomic
impact of the COVID-19 health crisis on informal settlements. The first set refers to the observed changes
in employment status over time, where we can examine their magnitude relative to other estimates
obtained from national population surveys. Here we find a dramatic employment loss among informal
dwellers during the pandemic, which is significantly larger than the labor decline in the general
population. We complement this finding by examining changes in cooperative behavior among neighbors
and the magnitude of the government policy take-up rate, which may ameliorate the economic impact
suffered by individuals in the settlements. Although our information does not allow us to assess the
overall change in economic wellbeing, we detect some responses oriented to reduce the dramatic loss in
employment.
Table 1 summarizes the evolution of employment status. We compare coefficients under different model
specifications. Columns (1) and (2) show results from a pooled cross-section model, while column (3)
shows our preferred specification, including individual fixed effects. The results are remarkably robust
across specifications. Post-1 and Post-2 capture the change in employment status observed in May and
September 2020, respectively, compared to the pre-pandemic period in August 2019. After the pandemic,
labor participation in the informal settlements drops 30 percentage points (Table 1, column 3, Post-1;
p<0.01), representing a 50 percent drop relative to the pre-pandemic level. The decrease in September is
even more considerable. Compared to August 2019, labor force participation decreases by around 40
percentage points (Table 1, column 3, Post-2, p<0.01), from a pre-pandemic level of 75 percent.

To examine the magnitude of the decrease in employment, we compare our results with a nationally
representative survey. Figure 1 compares the evolution of labor participation over time for different
groups: national population, individuals with incomplete formal education (less than secondary) residing
in the same municipalities as our sample, and informal dwellers. We show these results in two figures.
Fig. 1A examines the evolution of the percentage of people employed at any given moment, and Fig. 1B
shows the change relative to the observed levels for each category in the pre-pandemic period. Relative to
the national population, informal dwellers usually exhibit a higher level of participation in the labor
market [57].

monthly surveys, we plotted both the evolutions of the nationally-representative sample and a subsample of
respondents who reported less than complete secondary education and were residing in municipalities with at
least one informal settlement. Information on informal dwellers was obtained from Techo-Panel Survey 20192020.

Figure 1 shows that relative to the national population, employment loss is substantially larger among
informal dwellers. The decrease in employment status is even larger than for individuals with lower
education levels living in the same municipalities. Comparing the evolution of individuals in the same
municipalities may alleviate concerns about localized lockdowns implemented at the municipality-level.
These lockdowns may affect people differently, depending on the district where they live [6]. Although one
can imagine several reasons why these two populations may differ, such as the type of employment, the
magnitude of the difference shows that unemployment affected informal dwellers more severely.
We further examine the extent to which the larger drop in employment can be explained with some
observable attributes of informal dwellers that have been more affected by the pandemic at the national
level. Figure 2A examines whether the large proportion of immigrants living in informal settlements may
account for the larger employment loss. Figure 2B shows the employment impact disaggregated by gender.

Figure 2 shows that employment loss in May was particularly large among immigrants. Immigrants in
both surveys display a higher employment rate before the pandemic period and a dramatic loss at the
beginning of the pandemic. Among immigrant respondents with incomplete secondary education from the
representative national population survey, the employment rate drops from 80 to 60 percent between
February and April. Informal immigrant dwellers suffered a larger drop, from 80 to 40 percent between
September 2019 and May 2020.iii
Interestingly, after April, the immigrant population from the national population survey exhibits a
growing trend in employment up to 65 percent in August. This contrasts with the evolution of the Chilean
respondents where employment rate drops from 55 percent in February, to 45 percent in April, and
continues falling to 40 percent in August. Among informal dwellers, we observe a similar trend across
groups with an important difference in scale. Relative to Chilean settlement dwellers, employment loss
among immigrants was 15 percent larger in May. In September, the employment rate decreased further
for both groups up to 40 percent with no significant difference across groups.iv
We now analyze the evolution of collaboration among neighbors, a dimension of informal settlements’
social capital, which may mitigate some of the economic hardships we have described for the informal
settlements’ population. The questions analyzed refer to whether respondents provide help to their
neighbors in their communities. Table 2 shows the results. All Post-2 coefficients in Table 2 suggest a
large change in social collaboration among neighbors. Although for “listening to problems” and “lending
money” we detect no significant change in May, the variation is significant in the September wave. In the
case of “listening to problems” the increase over time may reflect an increase in social interactions. This
increase may not necessarily have shown up at the beginning of the mandatory lockdown when people
complied more strictly with social distancing measures. However, that strict interpretation should be
viewed with caution since we detect a deterioration in the percentage of respondents who report helping
neighbors with domestic work, clothes and food, and children care (Table 2, columns 2, 4, and 5
respectively). The pandemic's beginning may have triggered a large increase that persists over time with a
slight intensity decrease.

We finally analyze the take-up evolution of government programs implemented to reduce the
consequences of employment loss during this period. In May and September 2020, we incorporated
questions regarding participation in the unemployment insurance program and the COVID cash transfer
program (“Bono COVID”) that the government put in place in response to the pandemic crisis. Through
Bono COVID, low-income households can receive a cash benefit of approximately US $70.

Table 3 shows that participation in the unemployment insurance program among informal dwellers
increased from 6 to 17 percent between May and September, 2020. An essential limitation of the
unemployment insurance program’s ability to ameliorate the employment loss is the high level of
informal employment, leaving a large group of informal dwellers ineligible for this program. In fact, we
observe that roughly a quarter of the respondents that lost employment between 2019 and 2020 claimed
the unemployment insurance benefit. Similar to the unemployment insurance program, participation in
Bono COVID program increased from 33 to 37 percent during 2020.v Although take-up ratio for this
program was higher among those who never reported any employment (56 percent) or those who lost
employment after the pandemic (53 percent), more than half of the respondents reported having not
received this benefit during the pandemic period.

Discussion & Policy Implications
The COVID-19 pandemic has altered everyday life dramatically for most of the world’s population,
imposing new costs, restrictions, and risks on everyday life. These changes also affect individuals living
in informal settlements, but their options to cope with these changes are worse. This study’s empirical
evidence of the socioeconomic effects of the pandemic in informal settlements shows a grim situation.
Compared to the baseline in August 2019, our results showed a dramatic drop in employment status in
May and September 2020. This drop was more extensive for settlement dwellers than for the rest of the
population and also when compared to individuals with low education (a proxy for low income) in the
same districts. Our analysis shows that the pandemic has triggered some level of neighborhood
cooperation on some basic needs, but that cooperation has decreased over time. Last, we describe the
number of informal households that have received assistance from the government, which has increased
during the pandemic but has not reached the majority of the population examined.
There is substantial evidence of the harmful effects of the pandemic and viral transmission control
strategies, such as lockdowns and school closures, on economic activity. These effects have resulted in
substantial employment loss [7,9-11,58]. Residents of informal settlements are more economically
vulnerable to external shocks in the economy than the general population because a large proportion
perform informal jobs earning subsistence wages. Our findings are consistent with this evidence.
The pandemic has also exacerbated pre-existing social inequalities. For example, our results also show
that the drop in economic activity has more negatively affected immigrants than non-immigrant residents
of informal settlements. The situation of the most vulnerable populations is maybe even worse than we
found in our study, as there is increasing evidence of xenophobia, racism, and stigma against the poor and
migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic [59-62].
Our results also suggest neighborhood cooperation within informal settlements increased at the onset of
the pandemic but has decreased over time. This decrease may be an essential source of vulnerability, as
individuals living in these settlements often depend on local networks to access resources, including food,
labor, and childcare [26]. We also found that immigrant householdsare are substantially less likely to
receive any government assistance, such as the Bono COVID or in-kind food transfers. Informal
settlements often attract less public assistance because they are installed on land without a proper legal
title [34]. This complex relationship with governments could be more problematic during the pandemic.

Communities sometimes cope with the lack of aid from government offices by developing strong social
networks among neighbors and also with the aid of NGOs and other private institutions.
Strategies to prevent the spread of the virus need to consider the chronic vulnerabilities of individuals
living in informal settlements and the comparative advantages of these communities. Some of these
communities' vulnerabilities to infectious diseases include inadequate water, sewage, and hygiene
infrastructure; insufficient or nonexistant waste collection; material deprivation; space limitations; and
overcrowding [26,63,64]. These characteristics need to be considered when implementing large scale
regulations and policies to control a pandemic, as the livelihoods of people in informal settlements are
more vulnerable to external shocks in the economy. Some researchers have conceptualized these
communities as “poverty traps”, which prevent low-income families from accumulating the economic and
social resources necessary to improve their disadvantaged situation [37]. Other authors have provided a
more complex picture of informal settlements, conceiving these urban enclaves as low-cost housing
options for vulnerable individuals that aim to take advantage of the access that the settlements provide to
the economic and social opportunities that a city brings [36]. Individuals in some informal urban
settlements may have better access to economic and social urban opportunities – such as connectivity,
jobs, social networks, and community organizations – than low-income individuals in governmentsubsidized housing projects [39,55,56]. Urban informal settlements may be a relevant source of economic
activity and income in a city and may run social, political, and cultural initiatives [39,65,66].
Governments, non-profits, and the community need to act quickly to provide economic support, urban
infrastructure, and protections to individuals living in informal settlements. The value of lives saved and
disease burden averted will probably far exceed the economic costs of providing immediate support to
families facing severe hardship [20]. Schools provide essential meals and nutrition to children living in
poverty, including those in informal settlements. The closure of schools, implemented nationally in Chile
since March 16 [40], likely has affected child nutrition and other essential services, such as routine
vaccination programs [67]. This urgent support should not come at the expense of long-term efforts to
improve informal settlements and their residents’ other immediate needs [21]. Governments need to
innovate with policies targeted at the informal sector, including immigrants and single-headed
households. This crisis may also be an opportunity for long-term improvements in these marginalized
communities.
We have provided quantitative evidence of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation
strategies in informal urban settlements. The emergence and persistence of informal settlements in urban

areas represent a complex policy issue, as these settlements may offer advantages compared to
government-provided-low-income housing. Strategies to prevent the spread of the virus need to consider
the chronic vulnerabilities of individuals living in informal settlements and the comparative advantages of
these communities. Informal settlements are densely populated areas where compliance with social
distancing is challenging. This crisis has expanded the spatial inequalities of urban areas, affecting the
population living in informal settlements, many of whom may end up in a long-term poverty trap for
years to come.

Endnotes
i

See supplementary material Table S1 that describes the location of individuals surveyed in 2019, relative to
the sample of slums identified in each Chilean region, according to government official records.
ii

Encuesta Nacional de Empleo (ENE Survey) is a monthly national survey that surveys a random sample of
the Chilean household. The survey contains information of all individuals older than 15 years within a
selected household, and it corresponds to the main instrument to monitor the evolution of employment, among
other labor market outcomes. The sample of the survey considers approximately 12.000 households which
correspond to approximately 35,000 individuals each month. The survey considers as employees those who
answer with "yes" to the question if last week they worked for at least one hour. This survey is managed by
the Chilean national Institute of Statistics (Instituto Nacional de Estadísticas, INE).
iii

While we do not observe monthly evolution of employment among informal dwellers, an obvious concern
may relate to employment seasonality. Given the magnitude of the drop, seasonality seems to be a second
order issue that could affect the magnitude of the observed change. By using the same nationally
representative survey during 2019, we observe a fair degree of stability over time among the national
population and the subgroup of respondent with incomplete education residing in municipalities with at least
one slum. See supplementary material Figure S1.
iv

In supplementary material Table S4 we analyze these results using our individual-level panel data and
including heterogenous changes by immigrant status and gender. Coefficient results show a disproportionate
drop among informal immigrant dwellers in May, but no significant difference between Chileans and
immigrants in September. In terms of gender, we observe a larger drop -- but not statistically significant at
conventional levels -- among females.
v

We analyze heterogenous responses by immigration status and gender in supplementary material Table S5.
In this case, we are constrained by the fact that these questions were later incorporated in the 2020 surveys.
We observe several important facts. First, while we do not detect differences between Chileans and
immigrants in any of the two periods for the unemployment insurance program, differences in COVIDtransfers are substantial. In May, 2020, while 40 percent of Chilean informal dwellers had received the
transfer, only 20 percent of immigrants had participated. In terms of gender, we observe that women exhibit a
16 percent higher participation rate in COVID-transfer program in May, 2020 and the gender gap drops by 7
percentage points in September, 2020. In the case of unemployment insurance program participation, we
observe no difference by gender among informal dwellers in any of the two periods of analysis.

Notes †p-values for All- Wave1. ‡p-values for All- Waves1,2. The table shows the average values for each variable
and sample in the 2019 survey. Standard deviations are in parentheses. We calculate the p-value of the difference
across sample surveys for a different combination of samples identified in each column. The original 2019 survey was
conducted in person in August 2019. The first and second waves correspond to a random sample of the original
respondents re-surveyed in May 2020 and September 2020.

Figure S1. Employment rate evolution during 2018-2019. Evolution of employment rate during
2018-2019 following similar months described in figures 1 and 2 by immigration respondent status before and
after the COVID-19 pandemic period for different survey series. The figure shows the employment rate as the
proportion of people employed divided by the population older than fifteen years old on each survey. From
ENE monthly surveys, we plotted a subsample of respondents who reported less than complete secondary
education and were residing in municipalities with at least one informal settlement.

Notes: Coefficients are estimated under different model specifications. Columns (1) and (4) show results from
a pooled cross-section regression, and coefficients Post-1 and Post-2 show the change in employment status for
each particular period, relative to the pre-pandemic period measured in August 2019. Column (2) and (5)
reproduce the same specification as column (1) and (4) but including slum fixed effects. Column (3) and (6)
show results, including individual fixed effects as specified in equation (1). All coefficients are estimated using
survey weights. Robust standard errors in parentheses. * p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01.
