ABSTRACT

Keywords:
compartmental model
SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus
non-pharmaceutical containment strategies
network model

We present preliminary results on an all-Ireland network modelling approach to simulate the
spreading the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), commonly
known as the coronavirus. In the model, nodes correspond to locations or communities that
are connected by links indicating travel and commuting between different locations. While this
proposed modelling framework can be applied on all levels of spatial granularity and different
countries, we consider Ireland as a case study. The network comprises 3440 electoral divisions
(EDs) of the Republic of Ireland and 890 superoutput areas (SOAs) for Northern Ireland, which
corresponds to local administrative units below the NUTS 3 regions. The local dynamics within
each node follows a phenomenological SIRX compartmental model including classes of Susceptibles, Infected, Recovered and Quarantined (X) inspired from Science 368, 742 (2020). For
better comparison to empirical data, we extended that model by a class of Deaths. We consider
various scenarios including the 5-phase roadmap for Ireland. In addition, as proof of concept, we
investigate the effect of dynamic interventions that aim to keep the number of infected below a
given threshold. This is achieved by dynamically adjusting containment measures on a national
scale, which could also be implemented at a regional (county) or local (ED/SOA) level. We
find that – in principle – dynamic interventions are capable to limit the impact of future waves
of outbreaks, but on the downside, in the absence of a vaccine, such a strategy can last several
years until herd immunity is reached.

On 30th January, 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the newly emergent novel coronavirus
pathogen, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), to be a public health emergency of
international concern [41, 42]. This characterisation was later updated to pandemic status on 11th March 2020 [43].
Following its initial detection in a cluster of patients experiencing acute respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan, in
the Hubei province of China [13], the spread of SARS-CoV-2, which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
to 218 countries and territories in the months since has led to unprecedented social and economic disruption [18, 45].
Despite widespread efforts to contain the virus through a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions, global figures
show reported cases standing at over 63 million, with deaths from the virus totalling 1.5 million up to late November
2020 [17, 25]. It is clear that there is an urgent and ongoing need to understand how the virus spreads in order to
effectively protect populations.
As of yet there are no significantly effective pharmaceutical measures available that prevent the spread of the
disease. Vaccination programmes commenced on 14th December, 2020 and in the first month, approximately 35
million doses have been administered in 49 countries worldwide [7]. Immunisation of billions of people around the
world will be a logistical tour de force, and the time frame for a significant level of coverage is still on the order of
many months or more. Until such measures are widely implemented, the best available mitigation strategies include

A Metapopulation Network Model for the Spreading of SARS-CoV-2

the use of face masks, sanitisation, and social distancing. Authorities have implemented lockdowns to promote these
measures. Mathematical models are invaluable in providing us with an insight into the processes by which the disease
spreads [1, 8, 29–31, 33] and these models can help decide on the best course of action to take in the form of nonpharmaceutical interventions [4, 34–36].
The model proposed in this discussion paper and the numerical results arising from it are to be understood as
a contribution to the scientific and public discussion of possible spreading scenarios and the impact of intervention
measures including realistic levels of compliance. We will clearly state the model ingredients and assumptions and
elaborate on conclusions that can be drawn based on these limitations; some of which are unlikely for any practical
purpose, but worth exploring, e.g., for worst-case scenarios.
We start with an introduction of the model equations for the local and networked dynamics in sections 1 and 2,
respectively. This includes a discussion of the local dynamics from a geometric point of view, where we sketch the
trajectories and equilibria in phase space. Then, we continue with a case study of Ireland in section 3 including realistic
mobility data and compliance levels with respect to movement restrictions. Besides an unlikely, worst-case scenario,
we consider different levels of increased awareness during the post-lockdown period in section 3.2. In addition, in
section 3.3, we explore effects of dynamic interventions to keep the prevalence below a given level. These dynamic
lockdowns are considered at different levels of spatial granularity.

1. Local Dynamics
We start with the model for the local, well mixed dynamics at a single node as the basis for the network model:
𝑆𝐼
𝑆̇ = − 𝛽𝑐
𝑁
̇𝐼 =𝛽𝑐 𝑆𝐼 − 𝜇𝐼 − 𝛼𝐼 − 𝜅𝐼
𝑁
𝑋̇ =𝜅𝐼 − 𝜇𝑋 − 𝛼𝑋
𝑅̇ =𝜇𝐼 + 𝜇𝑋
𝐷̇ =𝛼𝐼 + 𝛼𝑋.

(1a)
(1b)
(1c)
(1d)
(1e)

The above model is a simple extension of the original Kermack and McKendrick SIR model [26], inspired by Ref. [31].
There are five compartments, 𝑁 individuals, and each individual may belong to just one compartment at any time:
Susceptible 𝑆(𝑡) Individuals who have not been infected by the disease.
Infected 𝐼(𝑡) Individuals who are infected with the disease and are capable of transmission.
Quarantined 𝑋(𝑡) Individuals who are infected with the disease, but are quarantined or self-isolating and thus not
transmitting.
Recovered 𝑅(𝑡) Individuals who have recovered from the disease and are considered immune.
Dead 𝐷(𝑡) Individuals who have died from the disease.
The above system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) assume homogeneous mixing of the population, which
can be a good approximation for small communities, and small number of deaths. The parameters of the ODE model (1)
refer to the rates of moving from one compartment to another and population size:
𝛽 probability of infection on contact.
𝑐 rate of contact/mixing.
𝜇 rate of recovery.
𝜅 rate of moving from infected to quarantined.
𝛼 rate of death.
𝑁 total population size 𝑁 = 𝑆(𝑡) + 𝐼(𝑡) + 𝑋(𝑡) + 𝑅(𝑡) + 𝐷(𝑡) = const..

Figure 1: Sketch of the outbreak dynamics in the local SIXRD model (1) for 𝑅0 > 1, shown as a (red) trajectory from the disease-free equilibrium 𝑆e = 𝑁 to one of
the stable equilibria with 0 < 𝑆e < 𝑆0 in the projection of the (𝑆, 𝐼, 𝑋, 𝑅, 𝐷) phase space onto the (𝑆, 𝐼, 𝑅) subspace. 𝑆0 is the herd immunity threshold separating the
triangular family of equilibria into the (pink) unstable and (blue) stable parts.

Much insight into the network dynamics can be gained from geometric analysis of the local, single-node dynamics.
In the (𝑆, 𝐼, 𝑋, 𝑅, 𝐷) phase space, system (1) has a whole family of stationary solutions (equilibria). They are given
by
𝐼𝑒 = 𝑋𝑒 = 0 and 𝑆𝑒 + 𝑅𝑒 + 𝐷𝑒 = 𝑁,
correspond to disease-free conditions, and form a triangular surface shown in Fig. 1. This family includes the important
pre-disease equilibrium
𝑆𝑒 = 𝑁, 𝐼𝑒 = 𝑋𝑒 = 𝑅𝑒 = 𝐷𝑒 = 0.
To discuss stability of equilibria, it is convenient to introduce the basic reproduction number:
𝑅0 =

𝛽𝑐
.
𝛼+𝜅+𝜇

(2)

When 0 < 𝑅0 < 1, all equilibria are stable, meaning that no disease outbreaks can occur. When 𝑅0 > 1, the pre-disease
equilibrium turns unstable, and disease outbreaks become possible. To be more specific, the family of equilibria is
divided into the (pink) unstable part with 𝑆0 < 𝑆e ≤ 𝑁, which contains the pre-disease equilibrium, and the (blue)
stable part with 0 ≤ 𝑆e < 𝑆0 , shown in Fig. 1. The instability threshold separating the two parts is given by
𝑆0 =

𝑁
.
𝑅0

(3)

Guided by these observations, we define herd immunity, whether achieved naturally or by means of vaccination, in
terms of stable equilibria as follows:
Definition. In the local SIXRD model (1), we define herd immunity as a disease-free state of the system such that a
small increase in infected 𝐼 decays monotonically to zero (no outbreak):
0 ≤ 𝑆 < 𝑆0 and 𝐼 = 𝑋 = 0.
In other words, herd immunity is represented by a stable equilibrium. We call 𝑆0 = 𝑁∕𝑅0 the herd immunity threshold.

A Metapopulation Network Model for the Spreading of SARS-CoV-2

In Fig. 1, a disease outbreak is depicted as the (red) trajectory from the pre-disease equilibrium, giving a peak in
infected 𝐼(𝑡) around the herd immunity threshold 𝑆0 , to one of the (blue) herd immunity equilibria that lie below 𝑆0 .
The lower the 𝑆0 , the higher the peak in 𝐼(𝑡). Thus, bringing the herd immunity threshold 𝑆0 closer to 𝑁 for a period
of time and then back to its original position, e.g., via imposing temporary public-health restrictions, can modify the
outbreak trajectory so that ultimate herd immunity is achieved in a controlled way, that is with a peak in 𝐼(𝑡) that
remains below some desired level.

2. Network Model
While the ODE model (1) can be justified for small communities, it fails at capturing the dynamics that occurs at
large spatial scales and cannot account for heterogeneities in a population and interaction between metapopulations via
mixing/commuting [5]. For this reason, we develop a network framework by splitting the population up into a number
of smaller communities based on their geographic location. Ideally, these communities are small enough to justify a
well mixed ODE model at the local level. Every community corresponds to a node in the network. Two nodes are
connected by a link, which represent the number of people travelling between the involved communities. The number
of people travelling can vary with time or remain static. The resulting network model is given by

For notational convenience, the compartments are now labelled by a subscript, i.e., 𝑆𝑖 , 𝐼𝑖 , 𝑋𝑖 , 𝑅𝑖 , and 𝐷𝑖 , to denote
the number of individuals belonging to the respective compartments of 𝑖-th node in the network (𝑆𝑖 + 𝐼𝑖 + 𝑋𝑖 + 𝑅𝑖 +
𝐷𝑖 = 𝑁𝑖 , 𝑖 = 1, ⋯ , 𝑛). Similarly, the number of individuals travelling from node 𝑖 to node 𝑗 belonging to a given
compartment is denoted by 𝑆𝑖𝑗 , 𝐼𝑖𝑗 , 𝑋𝑖𝑗 , 𝑅𝑖𝑗 , and 𝐷𝑖𝑗 resulting in 𝑁𝑖𝑗 = 𝑆𝑖𝑗 + 𝐼𝑖𝑗 + 𝑋𝑖𝑗 + 𝑅𝑖𝑗 + 𝐷𝑖𝑗 . The proposed
modelling framework accounts for travel as commuting pattern, that is, individuals return to their original location (cf.
Appendix D). The local dynamics is included via the single-subscript quantities. Hence, 𝑆𝑖𝑖 = 𝐼𝑖𝑖 = 𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 𝑅𝑖𝑖 = 𝐷𝑖𝑖 =
0. Note that the network model includes interactions between nodes only in the susceptible and infected compartments.
Accordingly, we account for the number of (i) individuals that remain in their home node and (ii) those who travel to
∑
other nodes in the first and second term of Eqs. (4a) and (4b), respectively. For example, the term 𝑛𝑘=1,𝑘≠𝑖 (𝐼𝑘𝑖 − 𝐼𝑖𝑘 )
in Eq. (4a) refers to the net flux of infected individuals, that is, the difference between individuals leaving node 𝑖 to 𝑘
and arriving from node 𝑘 to 𝑖.
Given a number of travellers 𝑁𝑖𝑗 between nodes, the network model (4) assumes that the number of travellers
𝑆

belonging to the respective compartments is determined by a relation such as 𝑆𝑖𝑗 = 𝑁𝑖𝑗 𝑁𝑖 . Thus, the number of
𝑖
travelling susceptibles is proportional to the number of susceptibles in the home node. The number of travelling
individuals in the other compartments is computed in the same fashion. 𝑁𝑖𝑗 may be randomly generated at each time
step. The distance travelled between locations often follows a power-law or heavy-tail distribution and can be described

by a gravity or radiation population model [9, 10, 20, 37–39]. Alternatively, empirical movement data can inform the
model. From these data one can either build a static network using, e.g., the jump-size distributions, or randomly
generate a network at each time-step. Note that the proposed network model does not account for any importation
from outside the considered network.
For the fully networked case [cf. Eqs. (4)], the basic reproduction number 𝑅0 can be computed from the system’s
next generation matrix 𝐺 [40]. This takes into account the couplings between the nodes when computing the stability
of the disease-free equilibria. The (𝑖, 𝑗) entry of this matrix corresponds to the expected number of new infections in
node 𝑖 caused by an infected individual introduced in node 𝑗. The next generation matrix, as derived in Appendix A,
is given as

where 𝛿𝑖𝑗 denotes the Kronecker delta: 𝛿𝑖𝑗 = 1 for 𝑖 = 𝑗 and zero otherwise. Then, the effective reproduction number
𝑅∗0 for the networked system is given by the spectral radius 𝜌 of the the next generation matrix,
𝑅∗0 =𝜌(𝐺).

(6)

This provides a condition necessary for the stability all disease-free equilibria (𝐼𝑖 = 𝑋𝑖 = 0, 𝑆𝑖 + 𝑅𝑖 + 𝐷𝑖 = 𝑁𝑖 for
all 𝑖 = 1, ⋯ , 𝑛). It also gives a natural definition for herd immunity in the network, as the networked reproduction
number 𝑅0 is now a function of all susceptible populations (cf. the definition of heard immunity for the local dynamics
in Sec. 1). All scenarios discussed in the next sections are simulated using our library for modelling epidemics on
networks, E PIG RAPH [24], which is implemented in C++ and freely available on G ITH UB.

3. Case study: Ireland
For the remainder of this discussion paper, we elaborate on the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 in Ireland as a case
study. The network model given by Eqs. (4) is informed by publicly available data detailed in the next section.

3.1. Network Data
For the Republic of Ireland, each of the 3440 nodes in the network represents an electoral division as defined
by the central statistics office (CSO), for which small area population statistics are published from the 2016 census
[11]. The links in the network are the number of commuters between each electoral division according to CSO data
[12]. Similarly, for Northern Ireland, nodes refer to 890 superoutput areas according to Northern Ireland Statistics
and Research Agency (NISRA) [32]. This spatial resolution corresponds to the local administrative units below the
category-3 regions of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) [19].

3.2. 5-Phase Roadmap without Additional Countermeasures
In order to demonstrate the general feasibility of the proposed modelling framework, we consider the 5-phase
roadmap for reopening society & business by reducing lockdown restrictions as outlined by the Irish Government in
May 2020 [16]. Our model attempts to follow the historic evolution of the disease up until phase 2. Then, we allow the
model to run under the predicted effects of the remaining lockdown phases. See Tab. 1 for implications on travel and
gathering restrictions. Appendix B provides a comparison to reported case numbers. It is important to note that at this
stage, we do not consider any reintroduction or roll back to earlier phases during the course of the simulated outbreak.
This corresponds to a worst-case scenario and is highly unlikely from a practical point of view, because interventions
will be reintroduced, if case numbers rise again.
The parameters are chosen such that the model results match the actual number of deaths in Ireland. See Tab. 2
for details. It is important to note, however, that this model is in the early stages of testing and has not undergone any

sensitivity training on the parameters. The effective infection probability 𝛽eff is computed as 𝛽eff = 𝛽𝑐. As defined in
Eq. (2), the basic reproduction number of the local dynamics [cf. Eqs. (1)] exceeds the critical value of 𝑅crit
= 1 during
0
pre lockdown and after phase 3. Conversely, only initial lockdown, phases 1 and 2 have a 𝑅0 value well below unity
and – neglecting network-related effects – exhibit a burn out of an outbreak and self-guided decrease of the number of
infected.
We introduce a small number of diseased individuals to the Dublin area on 22nd January, 2020, that is, 50 days
before the initial lockdown, and run the model such that the disease spreads naturally and without control. On the
12th of March, we introduce the initial lockdown measures, which take some time to reach full effect. Individuals’
movement is limited to 2km and this is adhered to with 80% compliance. This level of compliance is supported by
preliminary findings of a nation-wide series of phone interviews accounting for essential/justified and non-essential
travel [23]. The level of compliance to movement restrictions is kept constant at 80% in the simulations (cf. Fig. 11 for
the impact of compliance levels during regional interventions). We account for social distancing and self-isolation (𝑋
compartment) by reducing the rate of mixing 𝑐 within communities (cf. Tab. 2 for the respective parameter values).
During phases 1 and 2/3, the travel radius increased to 5km and 20km, respectively, and we assume the same level
of compliance. Travel restrictions are removed in phases 4 and 5 (cf. Tab. 1). Each of the numbered phases have a
duration of 21 days. See Appendix D for further details on the impact of movement restrictions on the mobility. In the
post-lockdown period, the social mixing parameter is not reset to 𝑐 = 1, but to a lower level of 𝑐 = 0.75 to account
for a residual effect of an increased level of awareness compared to pre-lockdown. This is justified, for instance, by
ongoing closure of schools and universities and higher levels of home office than at the start of the year.
Figures 2 depicts the time series of all five compartments – aggregated over all nodes – in semi-logarithmic scale.
One can see two distinct peaks: (i) a small peak that occurs before the lockdown and (ii) a second peak that occurs
once all lockdown measures are lifted. It is clear that unless some of the measure are maintained, then the lockdown
will just have the effect of delaying the epidemic and result in a second wave with a prevalence that – in this unlikely
worst-case scenario – is 100 times higher than the first one and exceeds any realistic capacity of the health-case system.
The number of infected eventually reaches zero due to a depletion of the pool of susceptibles. Following the geometric
analysis of the local dynamics (cf. Sec. 1), the trajectory lands at one of disease-free equilibria 𝐼e = 0. A change in
parameters, e.g., rate of mixing 𝑐, or a rescaling of the population to the number of remaining susceptibles can render

the model parameters but also the number of susceptibles. For details, see Appendix A. 𝑅∗0 is plotted as black dashed
curve in Fig. 3. For comparison, the local/simplistic value of 𝑅0 given by Eq. (2) is shown as (dash-dotted) red curve.
The value of 𝑅∗0 shows the potential for the disease to spread at each phase in the simulation. From Fig. 3 we can
see clearly that when 𝑅∗0 falls below unity, the number of infected also begins to fall. We also note the point of herd
immunity is reached is in when the number of susceptibles crossed the point where the 𝑅∗0 goes below 1.
As stated above, the parameters are chosen to match the actual number of deaths in Ireland. This, in turn, results
in a larger first peak compared to the reported numbers of confirmed cases on the 12th of March ranging from 27
according to [21] to 70 according to [44] (cf. Fig. 13 in Appendix B for a detailed comparison to reported data). The
simulated results, however, are not meant to reflect this range of confirmed cases, but following the logic of the model,
refer to all infected individuals including asymptomatic, non-diagnosed and untested.
Figures 4a and 4b show spatially resolved snapshots of the prevalence of the disease per km2 at times 𝑡 = 50d
(March 12) and 𝑡 = 320d (December 7), respectively (cf. [22] for a map based on data of reported, confirmed cases).
Figure 4a corresponds to the disease prevalence at the first peak before the lockdown. The disease remains in the
East of the country for the most part with the exception of big towns and cities. In contrast, at 𝑡 = 320d (Fig. 4b), the
outbreak covers the entire country and affects every electoral division. See Fig. 2 for a full time series of the aggregated
variables.
Figure 5 shows the effect of different levels of awareness during the post-lockdown phase, which is modelled by
different values for the mixing parameter 𝑐. For convenience, the plots only depict the time series of the aggregated
infected compartment 𝐼 in a linear scale. A reduction to 70% of the original probability of infection significantly
leads to a significantly smaller and delayed second peak (red curve), while the basic reproduction number of the local
dynamics remains above unity (cf. Tab. 2).
In order to show how the heavy-tail distribution of travel across the network causes a lack of sensitivity in initial
conditions, we run the model for a number of random initial seeds where for each run only a single individual is placed
in one electoral division or superoutput area at the start of the simulation. The resulting time series are shown in Fig. 6.

One can see that both amplitude and timing of the large, second peak are stable and it is impossible to visually
differentiate between any of the curves for different initial conditions. In the presented 4 cases, the initial location
is selected uniformly at random from all network nodes. We note that deliberately selecting urban or rural locations
will have no qualitative impact. To further corroborate the results, initial infections of a significant, finite fraction of
the population will be explored. This might account for a considerable amount of unreported cases at the start of the
recording of SARS-CoV-2 cases.

3.3. Dynamic Interventions
Finally, we discuss the likely scenario of a flexible lockdown policy that monitors the prevalence of the disease
within the island and aims to keep it below the capacity of the health-care system. As a simple measure, we define
some threshold 𝐼th as the maximum number of infected that can be present before we go back into lockdown and

go through earlier phases again. Such a procedure corresponds to dynamic [14, 27, 28] or active [4] interventions.
Specifically, we simulate until phase 3 as before to maintain the agreement with reported cases. Afterwards, if the
∑
condition 𝐼th > 𝑖 𝐼𝑖 is met, the system goes back to phase 1 and then progresses from there until the condition is met
again.

Island Interventions. In detail, we consider two scenarios with different threshold parameters, which are inspired by
the reported, maximum number of hospitalized cases during the first wave in April 2020 [22]: (i) 𝐼th = 104 , as shown
in Fig. 7 and (ii) 𝐼th = 103 as depicted in Fig. 8. In both figures, the worst-case scenario of Fig. 2 is added as dashed
curves. Note that the curves of recovered 𝑅 (orange) and deaths 𝐷 (red) are only increasing at a low rate. For the case
of 𝐼th = 104 , for instance, these values arrive at 105 after two years and thus, way below any effect of herd immunity.

A Metapopulation Network Model for the Spreading of SARS-CoV-2

Under the assumptions the considered network model, it would take many years for a significant depletion of the
pool of susceptibles. Extrapolating from an extended run of the model similar to Fig. 7, we find that it would take
roughly 27 years for the number of recovered to reach half the population, leading to a total number of approximately
92,000 deaths over the course of many waves. Even with a large threshold 𝐼th = 104 for the maximum number of
infected cases, the feasibility of such a strategy is questionable due to the time it would take to reach herd immunity
of on the island.
The re-introduction of lockdown measures to account for rising numbers of infected can change the stability of
the disease-free equilibria 𝐼e = 0. However, as soon as the restrictions are relaxed, e.g., during phases 3 to 5, an
unstable family of these equilibria re-emerges and the outbreak pattern repeats. Suppressing the occurrence of unstable
disease-free equilibria requires other forms of interventions. One could consider, for example, a fishing-type extension
of the model [3, 6, 15]. This will basically turn the rate 𝜅 in the local dynamics (1) into a function of the number of
ℎ
with a consumption/fishing rate ℎ (here: rate of isolation) and a reference capacity 𝐼𝑐
infected, e.g., 𝜅(𝐼) = 1+𝐼∕𝐼
𝑐
for 𝜅(𝐼) = ℎ∕2. This 𝐼 dependence will account for contact-tracing effects, which are especially effective for low
numbers of infected. As a consequence, a high rate ℎ of isolation will be able to push the basic reproduction number
[cf. Eq. (2) or Eq. (6)] below the critical value of 𝑅crit
= 1 and change the stability of the equilibria 𝐼e = 0.

Regional Interventions. Next, we consider another scenario that accounts for regional lockdowns at the level of
𝑐 . Thus, once the
counties. In our dynamic intervention model this corresponds to each county having its own 𝐼𝑡ℎ
county surpasses this threshold, another lockdown is triggered sending the county back to phase 1. When lockdown
phases differ between counties, we assume that the travel restrictions in and out are followed with the compliance of
the county being travelled to. When we run the simulations using the regional interventions, the model operates at
the level of electoral divisions and superoutput areas but their travel and interaction dynamics are consistent across
counties. The parameters used for each phase are the same as those given in Tabs. 2 and 1. For this run we took the
𝑐 = 1400 and as usual the model is allowed to run without intervention
maximum number of infected per county 𝐼𝑡ℎ
until phase 3 to match the historic number of deaths.

Figure 9: Number of individuals (aggregated over counties) belonging to the 𝐼 compartment. Parameters as in Tab. 2. Each successive lockdown phase is indicated by
the differently colored shaded regions on the plot up until the lockdown phases for each county become desynchronised. After the initial lockdown (violet), phases 1 – 5
last 3 weeks each. The four largest counties by population are explicitly denoted in the legend.

From Fig. 9 we see some interesting dynamics when we view the evolution of the number of infected in each county.
After Dublin re-enters phase 1 due to dynamic lockdown after only a few days the numbers start rising again. This is
not due to its own dynamics, but due to its interaction with neighbouring counties, which are not yet in lockdown. It is
only once all the other counties enter phase 1 lockdown do we see the numbers in Dublin and Cork begin to drop. We
conclude that treating such counties in isolation is not a good strategy due the strong coupling between each county that

Figure 12 shows the time evolution of infected aggregated over both Dublin and Cork county for different levels of
compliance (cf. Figs. 9 and 11). These examples show that lower compliance yields higher peaks after the introduction
of regional interventions.

4. Conclusion
We have proposed a dynamical network model to study the spreading of SARS-CoV-2 that accounts for travel or
commuting between nodes of the network. As a case study, we have presented results from numerical simulations for
Ireland, where the model is informed from publicly available data on geographical regions, population, and mobility
in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The network model is flexible in terms of spatial granularity
and parameter selection. We have focused on the governmental 5-phase roadmap for reopening society & business
and considered different initial conditions, parameters, and mobility data including realisitic levels of adherence to
movement restrictions. We have observed that the roadmap will lead to a decline of case numbers. However, once
the restrictions are lifted, the numbers will rise again, even if an increased level of awareness is considered. This is in
excellent agreement with reported case numbers (cf. Appendix B).
Finally, we have elaborated on a procedure of dynamic interventions that re-introduce lockdown measures, if a
certain threshold of infection is reached. Following such a protocol, the overall number of infected cases can be
controlled and safely kept below a prescribed threshold, which can be selected according to the capacity of the healthcare system. We have considered that containment measures would be re-introduced on a country-wide level, but a
more regional approach (county level) appears feasible as well. It is likely that in the long term, the disease will be
contained best by vaccination and not by the development of natural herd immunity [2]. While we have not considered
the effects of vaccination in this paper, in our model naturally acquired herd immunity, or population resistance, will
develop slowly over a long period of time. This is true even with our assumption that infection confers long-lasting
resistance, and it is far from clear that this actually the case. Therefore the model supports the view that effective herd
immunity will best be obtained with widespread immunisation [2] although factors such the duration of immunity,
efficacy in different age demographics or ethnic groups, likely vaccination uptake, effects of different vaccines, as well
as efficacy against novel variants are poorly understood. Our model could be used to study these variables but this is
outside the scope of this paper.
We hope that the results presented in this discussion paper will stimulate scientific and public discussion beyond
the island of Ireland about the purpose and effect of lockdown measures in the months ahead (cf. Appendix C). These
are plausible scenarios given the time frame of vaccination campaigns that have just begun.

A Metapopulation Network Model for the Spreading of SARS-CoV-2

A. Next Generation Matrix
In this appendix, we provide a detailed derivation of the next generation matrix given Eq. (5). We start by splitting
the networked SIXRD equations (4) into the parts that cause new infections and all other changes. We shall denote
the rate of appearance of new infections at node 𝑖 in compartment 𝑈 by 𝑈 ,𝑖 (𝑥). Similarly, let 𝑈 ,𝑖 (𝑥) be the rate of
change of individuals in compartment 𝑈 and node 𝑖 by all other means such that 𝑈̇ 𝑖 = 𝑈 ,𝑖 − 𝑈 ,𝑖 . This yields the
following equations:

B. Comparison to Real-World Data
Figure 13 shows a comparison of model results for a countrywide dynamic lockdown scenario with daily and
cumulative figures for reported deaths and infections from the Health Surveillance Centre (HPSC). Following the
initial lockdown and phased reopening as outlined in Tab. 1, the threshold of infection was chosen to be 10000 in
these simulations, before a national lockdown was reintroduced. This figure is adjustable based on current public
health guidelines. Panels 13a and 13b compare the model to daily and cumulative reported figures for infections,
respectively. Moreover, panels 13c and 13d compare the model results to daily and cumulative figures for deaths. The
blue curves correspond to the model results, and the red curves refer to the data reported by HPSC. A 14-day moving
average has been applied to data from the HPSC. Note that the infected compartment in the model does not distinguish
between confirmed/undetected symptomatic/asymptomatic cases. This explains the larger number of infections in the
model in which we see a clear qualitative agreement in the number of infections over time. The number of deaths,
however, is more reliable and the model reproduces the actual numbers with large agreement. Overall, we find that the
model results compare favourably to these real-world data.

Other parameters are as given in Tab. 2.

C. Projected Post-Christmas Lockdown
As a final scenario, we finish with a projection on the a possible post-Christmas projection during which we expect
to see the third wave of lockdown. Figures 14 considers the current period of the second wave and the corresponding
lockdown with level-5 movement restrictions in the Republic of Ireland. After a partial lifting of these measures scheduled for 1st December 2020, we find that the case numbers will rise again. Note that the numbers remain significantly
higher than during summer 2020. This is illustrated by the maps in Fig. 15, which compares the situation by the end of
June and 1st December. We project that the numbers will reach a high level similar to the introduction of the current
lockdown by late-January 2021 and thus will require another lockdown of similar duration.

Figure 14: Simulating the evolution of the disease such that the historic deaths are matched up until level 5 and projected form then on. There are two subsequent periods
of lockdown: the current lockdown that started mid-November and is expected to lift 1st December. The next lockdown, which occurs in January 2021, is projected
based on the number of the numbers of the November lockdown. Other parameters are as given in Tab. 2.

D. Movement data

Figure 16: The complementary cumulative proportion of individuals travel distance with the 2km (orange dashed), 5km (green dash-dotted), and 20km (red dotted)
restrictions in place for a compliance level of 80%. The original, pre-lockdown data, which are used during periods with no travel restrictions, is shown as blue solid
curve. The inset shows the the full range in a semi-log scale.

In this appendix, we demonstrate how travel restrictions affect the movement of individuals in the simulations. We
extracted the number of travelling individuals 𝑁𝑖𝑗 between locations 𝑖 and 𝑗 from CSO data and generated a probability
distribution of travelling from one electoral division/super-output area to another as a function of population density
and distance. Once the travel restrictions are put in-place, the probabilities of travelling to areas outside this distance
are scaled by the compliance factor making individuals less likely to travel there. Each 𝑁𝑖𝑗 was then generated from
these probability distributions inferred from real commuting data within the country.
The difference in these movement patterns can be seen in Fig. 16 where the cumulative distribution of travel
distances is plotted for each level of travel restrictions (2km, 5km, and 20km) and the original data prior to the first
lockdown period, which are used during periods with no travel restrictions (cf. Tab. 1). The inset shows the original
distribution for the full range in a semi-logarithmic scale. The kinks in the distribution of the restricted movement
occur at the respective radii. Larger distances still occur due to non-perfect compliance (here: 80%).
In addition, we show in Fig. 17 how the travels out of a particular area (here an electoral division in Dublin; red
area marked by the arrow) are affected by the different travel restrictions. As the travel radius is reduced, the movement
is confined to a more local vicinity. Note that travel beyond the travel radius is still present due to non-compliance.
