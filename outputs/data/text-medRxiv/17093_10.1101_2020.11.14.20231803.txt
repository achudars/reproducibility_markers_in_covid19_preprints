Occurrence of cardiovascular complications
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection: a systematic
review

Abstract: Cardiovascular Diseases represent the main cause of death in the world, and are

associated with risk factors that cause serious complications in cases of infections, such as those of
the respiratory tract. In March 2020 the World Health Organization declared a pandemic for
SARS-CoV-2, a new coronavirus causing severe pneumonia, which emerged in December 2019 in
Wuhan, China. The objective is to investigate the occurrence of cardiovascular complications
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is a systematic review, quantitative, in the databases,
PubMed and Science direct, including primary studies with hospitalized patients confirmed for
COVID-19 and who presented cardiovascular complications, the form used tools for evaluation of
quality and evidence, following the PRISMA recommendations. Results: 12 studies were included.
The occurrence of cardiovascular complications was: 27.35% of the sample of 3,316 patients. Types:
Acute cardiac injury 17.09%; Thromboembolism 4.73%; Heart failure 3.43%; Arrhythmias 1.77%;
stroke 0.33%. Mean age 61 years. Conclusions: This study showed that there are several
cardiovascular complications associated with SARS-CoV-2, that the main one is acute cardiac
injury, which causes several instabilities in the cardiopulmonary system, and that it is associated
with mortality.

Keywords: Cardiovascular Complications; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2.

1. Introduction

Cardiovascular Diseases (CD) are a set of pathological conditions involving the
cardiovascular system, such as Coronary Arterial Disease (CAD), Cardiac Arrhythmias, Valvopathy,
Inflammatory Heart Disease, Heart Failure (HF), Vascular Brain Injury (VBI), Pulmonary Embolism
(PE), and Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT). However, some risk factors, modifiable and
non-modifiable, potentiate or cause cardiovascular events, among them: Systemic Arterial
Hypertension (SAH), Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Dyslipidemias, Sedentarism, Obesity, Stress,
Hormone replacement therapy, Smoking, Family history of CD, Sex, Age and Heredity[1,2].
Thus, CD represents a major public health problem, since it is the leading cause of death,
accounting for 17.7 million deaths worldwide in 2015, representing 31% of all deaths globally. The
main cause of death is CAD [3,4].
In this context, previous research has shown a transient risk of acute vascular events, including
myocardial infarction and cardiovascular deaths, after clinically diagnosed Acute Respiratory
Infections (ARI). Influenza vaccine has been shown to minimize the risk of major adverse cardiac
events among people with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Studies have shown that influenza
epidemics are associated with cardiovascular mortality in subtropical and tropical climates. Thus,
seasonal mortality from all causes, specifically in the elderly, has been associated with several
viruses, including influenza, parainfluenza, RSV, and norovirus. A Dutch study suggests that these
viruses account for 6.8% of deaths in people aged ≥85, 4.4% in people aged 75-84, and 1.4% in people

aged 65-74. The impact of viral respiratory infections on the cardiovascular system causing fatal
events is thus evident[5,6].
In this sense, in December 2019, cases of influenza syndrome with evolution to ARI, of
unknown etiology, were registered in China and caused concern because of the several deaths and
rapid transmissibility. In January researchers isolated and identified the causative infectious agent as
a Coronavirus, named at the time 2019-nCov, however, due to the similarity to SARS-CoV, another
coronavirus causing ARI in humans, was renamed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as
SARS-CoV-2, and respectively the disease was named Cov Disease-19 (COVID-19)[7–9].
Soon, COVID-19, due to the high transmissibility via respiratory droplets, directly and
indirectly, spread to neighboring countries and reached the level of the pandemic in March 2020
declared by the WHO[10].
According to the studies, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have been shown to evolve in
three ways: Flu Syndrome (FS), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Asymptomatic. In
the FS it refers to the presentation of fever, cough, sore throat, coryza, nasal congestion, and myalgia.
In SARS, signs, and symptoms of FS are associated with oxygen saturation equal to or <95%, beating
of nose wings, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and cyanosis. The cases of SARS represent the serious
complications of COVID-19, requiring intensive care treatment and being responsible for several
deaths. The following risk factors stand out for the evolution of SARS: chronic heart diseases,
chronic respiratory diseases, neoplasms, elderly, pregnant women, obese people[11–13].
In a review study, several cardiovascular complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection
were cited[14]. However, studies do not specify the most frequent and prevalent associated
complications, so it was questioned: What is the occurrence of cardiovascular complications
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection? The objective of this research is to investigate the occurrence
of cardiovascular complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

2. Materials and Methods
Exploratory-descriptive research, of the type Systematic Review (SR), following the PRISMA
recommendations [15]. The SR is made up of seven stages: 1. formulating a research question; 2.
defining inclusion and exclusion criteria; 3. developing a research strategy and researching the
literature - finding the studies; 4. selecting the studies; 5. evaluating the quality of the studies; 6.
extracting the data; 7. summarizing the data and evaluating the quality of the evidence;[16].
For the elaboration of the research question, we used the PICO strategy, widely used in
evidence-based practice, in which it proposes that problems identified in clinical practice, research,
and teaching be organized from four elements: Patient; Intervention; Comparison; Outcome (PICO).
Because the construction from these elements provides greater scope for the resolution of the
problem addressed [17].
Research question: What is the occurrence of cardiovascular complications associated with
SARS-CoV-2 infection cited in the literature? Patient: Infected with SARS-CoV-2 of any age group,
hospitalized / Intervention: identify the cardiovascular complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 /
Comparison: Not applicable / Outcome: Describe the occurrence of cardiovascular complications
associated with SARS-CoV-2 cited in the literature.
For the search strategy in the literature, the following keywords were listed: cardiovascular
complications; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2. The selected databases were: PubMed, Science direct,
including studies of any language, published from 2019 until the date of the search 11/07/2020.
Inclusion criteria: primary studies, which evaluated individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2
hospitalized and presented results on cardiovascular complications, of all age groups. Exclusion
criteria: studies that do not specify the cardiovascular complications that occurred quantitively.
The PRISMA flowchart, a tool that is part of the PRISMA protocol, was used to visualize the
search in the databases, showing how the final sample was reached, describing all the stages, and
inclusion and exclusion [15].
According to the protocol, two reviewers researched the bases independently, and critically
evaluated each study from exhaustive reading in two stages, sorting by titles and abstracts/complete

text. They then met twice to discuss the evaluations and decided which studies were included in the
research.
The U.S. National Institutes of Health's Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and
Cross-Sectional Studies was used to assess the quality of studies
(https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/ study-quality-assessment-tools) It consists of 14 questions
that measure the representativeness, the type of sampling, the description and evaluation of the
exposure, the participants' overbite and the adjustments and qualifications of the confounding
variables. The results were discussed qualitatively among the researchers, and the disparities were
solved through the discussion.
In the evaluation of the quality of evidence, the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine's
Quality Classification Scheme was used for studies and other evidence [18], which is based on levels
1 to 5:
1- Randomized clinical trial properly fed and conducted; systematic review with meta-analysis.
2- Well designed controlled trial without randomization; a comparative prospective cohort
study.
3- Case-control studies; a retrospective cohort study.
4- Series of cases with or without intervention; transversal study.
5- Opinion of respected authorities; case reports.
When extracting the data, the researchers developed a form consisting of the following
variables: authors and year of publication, method, quality of evidence, location, age, participants,
gender, comorbidities, estimates of the occurrence of cardiovascular complications evidenced in
those infected by SARS-CoV-2. For data analysis, we opted for descriptive statistics. The results were
presented in tables.

3. Results

In PubMed, the initial search resulted in 294 articles, after the analysis by title and objective, 46
were selected for reading. 7 articles were included for the data analysis [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24],
[25]. In Science direct, 795 articles were initially searched, applying the filter for primary articles only
resulted in 257. 45 were selected, and after reading 5, [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]. In figure 1 is the
flowchart of the search and table 1 the detailing of the variables extracted from the studies.

4. Discussion
Infection with SARS-CoV-2 may manifest with mild symptoms (85%) and severe symptoms
(15)% (such as progression to SARS) with the potential to cause extrapulmonary damage, including
cardiovascular damage that directly influences morbidity and mortality [31].
Thus, this study showed, from the analysis of studies with 3,316 hospitalized patients
confirmed for COVID-19, that the occurrence of cardiovascular complications associated with
SARS-CoV-2 was 27.35% of the following types: Acute cardiac injury 17.09%; Thromboembolism
4.73%; Heart failure 3.43%; Arrhythmias 1.77%; stroke 0,33%.
The acute cardiac injury was the most recurrent, and two meta-analysis studies showed its
association with increased troponin and mortality, showing no association of cardiac injury with a
higher risk of developing SARS. The studies highlight that early troponin monitoring is a preventive
strategy for further myocardial injury[32,33]. This mechanism of injury is not yet clear to
cardiologists, however, they work with hypotheses of viral invasion in the myocardium, similar to
pulmonary invasion, via the connection of SARS-CoV-2 to the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2
(ACE2), which is extensively present in the myocardium. Additionally, pneumonia can influence
systemic inflammatory responses, causing non-ischemic complications in the myocardium, mainly
in the presence of cardiovascular comorbidities. It is also noted that the increased inflammatory
activity is a risk factor for the rupture of coronary atherosclerotic plaques, which can cause the
partial or total blockage of coronary arteries, causing myocardial ischemia and consequently
hypoxia injury, characterizing Acute Myocardial Infarction. Causes of cardiomyopathy due to stress,
physical injury, or pharmacological effects were not excluded.[34,35].
Research characterizes that the occurrence of acute cardiac injury is highly related to the
presence of cardiovascular comorbidities (such as hypertension and diabetes), admission to an
Intensive Care Unit, and mortality. They highlight as a characteristic the increase of troponin type I
associated with electrocardiographic and echocardiographic alterations, presenting segmental
abnormality of the wall movement or reduction of the left ventricle ejection fraction [36]. Thus, the
clinical presentation of the acute cardiac lesion may manifest as myocarditis or acute myocardial
infarction, with thoracic pain and ST-segment elevation, requiring percutaneous cardiac
procedure[37,38], which is an intervention that presents a risk of acute renal failure in hospitalized
patients with comorbidities, due to the use of contrasts, and can increase hospitalization and
mortality [39]. Showing that this complication requires procedures that can influence or enhance
clinical conditions for a worse outcome.
Thromboembolism was the second most recurrent cardiovascular complication, described in
the literature as Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation. In association with SARS-CoV-2, it is
related to a storm of inflammatory cytokines, directly attacking the vascular endothelium with an
elevation of the fibrinogen and D-dimer markers (product of fibrin/fibrinogen degradation), causing
thrombin dysregulation, exacerbated by inhibition of fibrinolysis. Thus the natural anticoagulants
are compromised, resulting in the formation of thrombi, which can travel to a smaller vessel and
obstruct, causing hypoxia. Thromboses can be venous or arterial and can evolve to Deep Venous
Thrombosis, Pulmonary Embolism, Ischemic Vascular Accident, or acute myocardial infarction.
These are serious complications associated with mortality. In this context, the heparin used in
anticoagulant therapy was associated with a better prognosis in some cases[40,41]. A study with 184
patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit confirmed for COVID-19, showed an incidence of 31%
of thrombotic events, all received standard-dose tombroprophylaxis[42]. In another study with 388
patients hospitalized by COVID-19 with thrombotic events in 28 cases (7.7%), being 8 cases in the
intensive care unit and 20 cases in the infirmary, the complications represented: 4.4% venous
thromboembolism, 2.8% Pulmonary Embolism, 0.3% Deep Venous Thrombosis, 2.5% ischemic
stroke and 11.1% acute myocardial infarction and Acute Coronary Syndrome. All cases used
tombroprophylaxis[43]. This study also showed the occurrence of stroke alone as a complication in

0.33% of cases, however, it is directly associated with thromboembolism associated with
SARS-CoV-2, because the inflammatory response generates a hypercoagulable condition.
Heart failure represented the third cardiovascular complication, being a complex clinical
syndrome, in which the myocardium cannot adequately pump the blood to meet the metabolic
needs of the tissues. This condition can be caused by structural or functional cardiac changes and
presents characteristic signs and symptoms that result from a reduction in cardiac output and/or
high filling pressures at rest or under stress[44]. Studies show that this complication occurs in
patients without heart disease, mainly as a consequence of acute heart injury, since the damage to
the myocardium has repercussions on its ventricular contraction function, resulting in a reduction in
systolic function. Additionally, coagulopathies can cause pulmonary embolism and have
repercussions in acute right ventricular failure. Stress cardiomyopathy can also lead to classic
ventricular decompensation, with high filling pressures and pulmonary edema. On the other hand,
in the carrier of chronic heart failure, there is a great chance of decompensation of the disease,
requiring hospitalization and intensive care, influencing mortality[45,46].
Another outstanding complication was cardiac arrhythmias, which are directly related to the
following factors: acute cardiac injury, heart failure, drugs that prolong the qt interval. Atrial
fibrillation proved to be the most common type of arrhythmia, with the potential risk of thrombus
formation, acute myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke, and antithrombotic therapy is
debatable even in cases without risk factors. Arrhythmias are also related to higher risks of heart
instability, cardiac arrest, and death[47].
This review showed that acute cardiac injury is the main cardiovascular complication
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, causing several instabilities in cardiopulmonary functions,
and also influencing other cardiovascular complications, in patients without chronic diseases and
with chronic diseases.

5. Conclusions
The main cardiovascular complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized patients
were several, among them: acute cardiac injury, thromboembolism, heart failure, arrhythmias, and
ischemic stroke, with a mean age of 61 years, with the most prevalent comorbidities, hypertension,
diabetes, and heart diseases.
The evidence on the association of cardiovascular complications and SARS-CoV-2 provides
information for the implementation of preventive measures and better therapeutic management, to
minimize hospital stay, morbidity, and mortality.
