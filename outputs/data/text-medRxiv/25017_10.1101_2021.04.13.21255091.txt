Abstract
Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, some countries have introduced early
evening curfews. Several studies try measure the effectiveness of such measures across
different countries, but clear identification of effects is elusive.
Objective: We examined the impact of an early evening curfew on mobility by studying
a shift in curfews from 9pm to 6pm in Greece.
Data and Methods: We took advantage of a natural experiment in Greece, where curfews
shifted from 9pm to 6pm in one Region, but not in another. We followed a difference-indifferences econometric approach, where we compared trends in mobility in groceries
and pharmacies as well as residential spaces before and after the introduction of the 6pm
curfew, in the two regions.
Results: The relative difference in the time spent in groceries and pharmacies between
the two regions before and after the intervention, is statistically insignificant [coeff: -9.95;
95%CI -44.358 to 24.458]. The relative increase in time spent at residential spaces after
the 6pm curfew was only 4.625 percentage points [coeff: 4.625; 95%CI 1.412 to 7.838].
Conclusions: We found that the 6pm instead of 9pm curfew in Athens led to a 4.63
percentage point relative increase in time spent at home and had no effect on time spent
in groceries and pharmacies. Considering that this was a result of a 18.75% reduction in
hours where people were allowed to leave home, it seems that the early evening curfew
led to more crowding in indoor spaces – which may facilitate the spread of disease.
Interventions should be based on a thorough analysis of human behaviour, that
anticipates substitution of activities.

1. Background
There is an ongoing debate about non-pharmaceutical interventions and how effective
they are in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic.1 Such measures are most often introduced
jointly, so disentangling the effects of individual measures is challenging, while finding
appropriate control groups is not always straightforward.
An increasing number of studies suggest that stringency of the lockdowns
measures does not make a difference in infection prevalence or related deaths.2 Of course,
such studies are often challenged by measurement and identification issues. Also, there
are examples of evidence that the ‘signal (inducing voluntary behavior changes) is
important in contrast to the actual regulation (mandated behavior changes)’.3 In general
though, the economic literature, as well as legal research, suggest that restricting one
human activity often leads to substitution by others, as humans seek alternatives. And
there is a strictness level beyond which extra measures can actually backfire. In this paper
we show that early curfews may be one of these cases, where excessive strictness can
lead to the opposite of the intended result.
Why would reducing the time window during which people are allowed to leave
their homes either fail to achieve the desired greater reduction in virus spread or, even,
backfire by contributing towards the spread? One straight-forward reason is that people
do not fully reduce the activity proportionately to the strictness of measures – they
reallocate part of it towards options that are still allowed. For example, mobile tracker
data in the US shows a large reallocation of consumer activity from “nonessential” to
“essential” businesses as well as from restaurants and bars toward groceries and other
food sellers.4 Whilst these studies do not measure the resulting congestion in the
essential businesses, we argue that it is likely to be high, resulting in greater risk of virus
spread.

In our study, we took advantage of within-country heterogeneity in the timing of
the introduction of an early evening curfew to evaluate this measure in tackling the
Covid-19 pandemic. The advantage of our data is that we can cleanly identify the effect
using a sudden and singular change in the lockdown rules.
While cross country studies are definitely also very useful, they suffer from several
drawbacks absent in our method. On the one hand countries differ in important
characteristics that affect the performance of measures (availability of ICUs, the state of
the health system), but crucially they also differ in the way they measure the pandemic
itself. Recorded cases are biased and since testing methods are not homogeneous across
countries, the bias is heterogeneous, differing greatly across countries. 5 On the other
hand, the measures are not the same across countries, and seldom are enacted alone
within a specific country. Usually, a complicated bundle of measures is enacted on the
same day (and some measures almost always come together, such as closing several
levels of schooling along with other face to face activities) which greatly complicates
isolating the effect of a single measure. In this paper we use a natural experiment in a
single European country to clearly identify the effect of early curfews, using a difference
in difference approach, comparing a region affected by the curfew to neighbouring
regions.

2. Data and Methods
While a 9pm-5am curfew applied in Greece since November 2020, a 6pm-5am weekend
curfew was introduced on 6 February 2021 in the Attica region (which includes the
capital city of Athens) as a response to increasing Covid-19 cases. We studied the impact
of the 6pm curfew on human activity using mobility data from Google Community
Mobility Reports6. In particular, we focused on time spent at home, and time spent at

groceries/pharmacies. Staying at home is considered a goal of lockdown measures, to
limit the spread of the novel coronavirus; while it has been shown that indoor spaces such
as supermarkets may facilitate transmission. 7 Google mobility reports show how time
spent in different places compares to the baseline, which was the “median value for the
corresponding day of the week, during the 5-week period Jan 3 – Feb 6, 2020”,6 before
the pandemic started in Greece. a
A simple before-after analysis to evaluate the impact of the policy on mobility may
not be reliable as other factors affecting mobility may change (e.g. the weather), which is
why we used the Epirus & Western Macedonia Region (where the curfew remained at
9pm during the study period) as a control group. We studied the difference in the
differences in mobility between these two areas in the five weekends before and the four
weekends after the introduction of the 6pm curfew in Attica using a difference-indifferences (DiD) ordinary least squares econometric estimator. A DiD model compares
trends in the outcome in the treatment group and a control group before and after a
particular intervention, which is used extensively in the literature for causal inference.89

In such empirical models, there is a treatment group dummy, which takes the value of 1

for the group that underwent a treatment; and a treatment period dummy, which takes
the value of 1 for the time after the intervention. The interaction of the treatment group
dummy and the treatment period dummy gives us the main variable of interest.
In the DiD model, the dependent variable is the percentage change in time spent
in a particular type of location compared to the baseline. In one model we study groceries
and pharmacies, and in the other we study residential spaces. We included a dummy

Apple mobility trends reports are also available. However, these only cover driving, walking and commuting,
and captures the volume of requests, rather than actual mobility. Furthermore, Apple makes data available for
Attica and Greece, so the control group would be contaminated by areas where the treatment applies. Despite
these issues, any evidence we could get out of the Apple data points at exactly the same direction as the
results using the Google data.

variable for the Attica region which is the treatment group (1 for observations on Attica
and 0 for Epirus & Western Macedonia – the control group), and a dummy variable which
takes the value of one in the post-treatment period (from 6 February onwards) and zero
otherwise. The interaction between the two shows whether the intervention had an effect
on relative trends. We used robust standard errors in regressions.
Figure 1 shows the trends in mobility the two regions before and after the 6pm
curfew intervention (in week 11). The results of the DiD regressions are presented in
Table 1. When considering the effect on time spent in groceries and pharmacies (column
1), the coefficient of the DiD interaction term, that shows the difference in the difference
between the two regions, is statistically insignificant [coeff: -9.95; 95%CI -44.358 to
24.458]. This suggests that there was no change in the relative trends in visits to groceries
and pharmacies in Attica compared to the control group after the intervention. Column 2
shows the results of the model with time spent at residential spaces as outcome. The DiD
interaction term is positive and statistically significant [coeff: 4.625; 95%CI 1.412 to
7.838], suggesting that the relative increase in time spent at residential spaces after the
6pm curfew was only 4.625 percentage points.
The results of the econometric analysis show that a reduction in the time when
people were allowed to go outside by 3 hours (a 18.75% decrease) led to a 4.63
percentage point increase in time spent at home and had no effect on time spent in
groceries/pharmacies, in relative terms. As the change in activities is much smaller than
the change in time, the early curfew led to greater crowding. Especially with regards to
grocery stores, the same amount of time appears to be spent in a narrower time window.
As more people were present simultaneously in high-risk places such as supermarkets,
the early curfew backfired, possibly leading to greater disease transmission. Finding the

4. Conclusions
We found that the 6pm instead of 9pm curfew in Athens led to a 4.63 percentage point
relative increase in time spent at home and had no effect on time spent in groceries and
pharmacies. Considering that this was a result of a 18.75% reduction in hours where
people were allowed to leave home, it seems that the early evening curfew led to more
crowding in indoor spaces – which may facilitate the spread of disease. Our findings add
to existing evidence from Toulouse,10 that suggests that a 6pm curfew backfired.
This study is subject to limitations. The outcome is mobility rather than infections.
Although certain environments such as supermarkets have a higher likelihood of
spreading the disease,7 our data do not show the actual impact on Covid-19. However,
such an effect would be extremely challenging to disentangle, even with clinical data for
the following reasons: (a) Other factors such as variants that may be more transmissible
may apply, distorting the effect on actual health outcomes; (b) there is dispersion in the
time lag between infection and symptoms or hospitalisation or death; and (c) the effect
might show via second-hand transmission. For example, individuals who first contract
SARS-CoV-2 due to more crowding may be younger people who are often
asymptomatic,11 and may pass the virus on to others with a longer lag. Furthermore,
Google mobility data do not include a breakdown by time of day, so we cannot be sure
how the distribution of mobility changes, and the extent to which crowding occurs. While
accurately estimating the effect is not possible, the data show a clear direction towards
more crowding in certain spaces.
Overall, lockdowns and other measures are needed to tackle Covid-19. However,
it is important to design smart measures that do not lead to substitution by activities that
contribute further to spreading the virus. It seems that in some measures can indeed be
too strict, even if containing the disease is the only goal.
