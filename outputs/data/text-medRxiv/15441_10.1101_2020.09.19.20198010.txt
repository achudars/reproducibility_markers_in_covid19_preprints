ABSTRACT
Many popular disease transmission models have helped nations respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by
informing decisions about pandemic planning, resource allocation, implementation of social distancing
measures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions. We study how five epidemiological models
forecast and assess the course of the pandemic in India: a baseline model, an extended SIR (eSIR) model,
two extended SEIR (SAPHIRE and SEIR-fansy) models, and a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical
model (ICM). Using COVID-19 data for India from March 15 to June 18 to train the models, we generate
predictions from each of the five models from June 19 to July 18. To compare prediction accuracy with
respect to reported cumulative and active case counts and cumulative death counts, we compute the
symmetric mean absolute prediction error (SMAPE) for each of the five models. For active case counts,
SMAPE values are 0.72 (SEIR-fansy) and 33.83 (eSIR). For cumulative case counts, SMAPE values are
1.76 (baseline) 23.10 (eSIR), 2.07 (SAPHIRE) and 3.20 (SEIR-fansy). For cumulative death counts, the
SMAPE values are 7.13 (SEIR-fansy) and 26.30 (eSIR). For cumulative cases and deaths, we compute
Pearson’s and Lin’s correlation coefficients to investigate how well the projected and observed reported
COVID-counts agree. Three models (SAPHIRE, SEIR-fansy and ICM) return total (sum of reported and
unreported) counts as well. We compute underreporting factors as of June 30 and note that the SEIRfansy model reports the highest underreporting factor for active cases (6.10) and cumulative deaths
(3.62), while the SAPHIRE model reports the highest underreporting factor for cumulative cases (27.79).

1. INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1). At the time of writing this paper, it has been identified as
an ongoing pandemic, with more than 18 million reported cases across 188 countries and territories. The
disease was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019 (2). Since then, more than 936,000
lives have been lost and 20.1 million recoveries have been reported as a direct consequence of the disease.
Notable outbreaks were recorded in the United States of America, Spain, Italy, Iran, Brazil and India -which was a crucial battleground against the outbreak. The Indian government imposed very strict
lockdown measures in order to attenuate the spread of the virus. Said measures have not been as effective
as was intended (3), with India now reporting the largest number of confirmed cases in Asia, and the
third highest number of confirmed cases in the world after the United States and Brazil (4), with the
number of confirmed cases crossing the 1 million mark on July 17, 2020. On March 24, the Government
of India ordered a 21-day nationwide lockdown, later extending it till May 3. This was followed by twoweek extensions starting May 3 and 17 with substantial relaxations. From June 1, the government started
‘unlocking’ most regions of the country in three unlock phases. In order to formulate and implement
policy geared toward containment and mitigation, it is important to recognize the presence of highly
variable contagion patterns across different Indian states (5). There is a rising interest in studying
potential trajectories that the infection can take in India to improve policy decisions.
A spectrum of models for projecting infectious disease spread have become widely popular in wake of
the pandemic. Some popular models include the ones developed at the Institute of Health Metrics (IHME)
(6) (University of Washington, Seattle) and at the Imperial College London (7). The IHME COVID-19
project initially relied on an extendable nonlinear mixed effects model for fitting parametrized curves to
COVID-data, before moving to a compartmental model to analyze the pandemic and generate
projections. The Imperial College model (henceforth ICM) works backwards from observed death counts
to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks ago, allowing for the time lag between infection
and death. A Bayesian mechanistic model is introduced - linking the infection cycle to observed deaths,
inferring the total population infected (attack rates) as well as the time-varying reproduction number
!(#). With the onset of the pandemic, there has been renewed interest in multi-compartment models,
which have played a central role in modeling infectious disease dynamics since the 20th century (8). The
simplest of compartmental models include the standard SIR (9) model, which has been extended (10) to
incorporate various types of time-varying quarantine protocols, including government-level macro
isolation policies and community-level micro inspection measures. Further extensions include one which
adds a spatial component to this temporal model by making use of a cellular automata structure (11).
Larger compartmental models include those which incorporate different states of transition between
susceptible, exposed, infected and removed (SEIR) compartments, which have been used in the early
days of the pandemic in the Wuhan province of China (12). The SEIR compartmental model has been
further extended to the SAPHIRE model (13), which accounts for the infectiousness of asymptomatic

(14) and pre-symptomatic (15) individuals in the population (both of which are crucial transmission
features of COVID-19), time varying ascertainment rates, transmission rates and population movement.
Researchers and policymakers are relying on these models to plan and implement public health policies
at the national and local levels. New models are emerging rapidly. Models often have conflicting
messages and it is hard to distinguish a good model from an unreliable one. Different models operate
under different assumptions and provide different deliverables. In light of this, it is important to
investigate and compare the findings of various models on a given test dataset. While some work has
been done in terms of trying to reconcile results from different models of disease transmission that can
be fit to data emerging from local and national governments (16), more comparisons need to be done to
investigate how differences between competing models might lead to differing projections. In the context
of India, such head-to-head comparison across models are largely unavailable.
We consider five different models of different genre, starting from the simplest baseline model. The
baseline model we investigate relies on curve-fitting methods, with cumulative number of infected cases
modeled as exponential process. Next, we consider the extended SIR (eSIR) model (10), which uses a
Bayesian hierarchical model to generate projections of proportions of infected and removed people at
future time points. The SAPHIRE (13) model has been demonstrated to reconstruct the full-spectrum
dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan between January and March 2020 across 5 periods defined by events
and interventions. Using the same model, we study the evolution of the pandemic in India over 4 welldefined lockdown periods, each with distinct transmission and ascertainment features. Another model
(henceforth, SEIR-fansy) modifies the SEIR model to account for high false negative rate and symptombased administration of COVID-19 tests. Finally, we study the ICM model, which utilizes a semimechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model based on renewal equations that model infections as a latent
process and links deaths to infections with help of survival analysis. Each of the models mentioned above
have had appreciable success in being able to satisfactorily analyze and project the trajectory of the
pandemic in different countries (17),(18),(19).
In order to fairly compare and contrast the models mentioned above, we study their respective treatment
of the different lockdown periods imposed by the Government of India. Additionally, we compare their
projections based on reported data, with special emphasis on how the models deal with (if they do, at all)
under-reporting and under-detection of COVID-cases, which has been a major point of discussion in the
scientific community (20).
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide an overview of the various models
considered in our analysis. The supplement has detailed discussion on the formulation, assumptions and
estimation methods utilized by each of the models. We present the findings of our comparative
investigation of the models in Section 3 and discuss the implications of our findings in Section 4.

2. METHODS

2.1. Overview of models
In this section, we discuss the assumptions and formulation of each of the five models described above.

2.1.a. Baseline model
Overview: The baseline model we investigate aims to predict the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic
by means of a regression-based predictive model (21). More specifically, the model relies on a
regression analysis of the daily cumulative count of infected cases based on the least-squares fitting.
In particular, the growth rate of the infection is modeled as an exponentially decaying process. Figure
1 provides a schematic overview of this model.

where '(#) is defined as the number of infected people at time # and λ is the growth rate of infection.
Unlike the other models described in subsequent sections, the baseline model analyses and projects only
the cumulative number of infections, and not counts/proportions associated with other compartments.
The model uses reported field data of the infections in India over a specific time period. The growth rate
can be numerically approximated from Equation (1) above as
λ,
!! =

'!" − '!"#$
.
2 ⋅ '!"

( 2)

Having estimated the growth rate, the model uses a least-squares method to fit an exponential timevarying curve to λ0! , obtained from Equation (2) above. Using projected values of 10! , we extrapolate the
number of infections which will occur in future.
Implementation: The baseline model described above has been implemented in R using standard
packages.

2.1.b. Extended SIR (eSIR) model
Overview: We use an extension of the standard susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) compartmental
model known as the extended SIR (eSIR) model (10). To implement the eSIR model, a Bayesian
hierarchical framework is used to model time series data on the proportion of individuals in the infected
and removed compartments. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are used to implement this
model, which provides not only posterior estimation of parameters and prevalence values associated with
all three compartments of the SIR model, but also predicted proportions of the infected and the removed
people at future time points. Figure 2 is a diagrammatic representation of the eSIR model.

Formulation: The eSIR model assumes the true underlying probabilities of the three compartments
follow a latent Markov transition process and require observed daily proportions of infected and removed
cases as input.
The observed proportions of infected and removed cases on day t are denoted by 2!" and 2!# , respectively.
Further, we denote the true underlying probabilities of the S, I, and R compartments on day t by 3!$ , 3!" ,
and 3!# , respectively, and assume that for any t, 3!$ + 3!" + 3!# = 1. Assuming a usual SIR model on the
true proportions we have the following set of differential equations
&3!$
= −53!$ 3!" ,
&#

(37)

&3!"
= 53!$ 3!" − 83!" ,
&#

(39)

&3!#

&#

(3:)

where 5 > 0 denotes the disease transmission rate, and 8 > 0 denotes the removal rate. The basic
reproduction number !% ≔ 5/8 indicates the expected number of cases generated by one infected case
in the absence of any intervention and assuming that the whole population is susceptible. We assume a
Beta-Dirichlet state space model for the observed infected and removed proportions, which are
conditionally independently distributed as
2!" |@& , A ∼ CD#7E1" 3!" , 1" (1 − 3!" )F

(47)

2!# |@& , A ∼ CD#7E1# 3!# , 1# (1 − 3!# )F.

(49)

Further, the Markov process associated with the latent proportions is built as:
@& |@&'( , A ∼ HIJI:ℎLD#EMN(@&'( , 5, 8)F

(5)

where @& denotes the vector of the underlying population probabilities of the three compartments, whose
mean is modeled as an unknown function of the probability vector from the previous time point, along
with the transition parameters. A = (5, 8, @*) , P, M) denotes the whole set of parameters where 1" , 1# and
M are parameters controlling variability of the observation and latent process, respectively. The function
N(⋅) is then solved as the mean transition probability determined by the SIR dynamic system, using a
fourth order Runge-Kutta (RK4) approximation (22).
Priors and MCMC algorithm: The prior on the initial vector of latent probabilities is set as
@) ~Dirichlet(1 − 2+" − 2+# , 2+" , 2+# ), 3%$ = 1 − 3%" − 3%# . The prior distribution of the basic reproduction
number is lognormal such that Z(!% ) = 3.28 (23). The prior distribution of the removal rate is also

lognormal such that Z(8) = 0.5436. We use the proportion of death within the removed compartment
as 0.0184 so that the infection fatality ratio is 0.01 (24). For the variability parameters, the default choice
is to set large variances in both observed and latent processes, which may be adjusted over the course of
iid

epidemic with more data becoming available: M, 1" , 1# ∼ Gamma(2, 10'. ).
Denoting #% as the last date of data availability, and assuming that the forecast spans over the period
[#% + 1, b], our algorithm is as follows.
Step 0. Take d draws from the posterior [@(:&% , A|e(:&% ].
Step 1. For each solution path f ∈ {1, … , d}, iterate between the following two steps via MCMC.

from k@& l@!'+ , A(3) m, # ∈ {#% + 1, … , b}.
(3)

from ke& l@! , A(3) m, # ∈ {#% + 1, … , b}.

Implementation: We implement the proposed algorithm in R package rjags (25) and the differential
equations were solved via the fourth-order Runge–Kutta approximation. To ensure the quality of the
MCMC procedure, we fix the adaptation number at 10. , thin the chain by keeping one draw from every
10 random draws to reduce autocorrelation, set a burn-in period of 104 draws to let the chain stabilize,
and start from 4 separate chains. Thus, in total, we have 2 × 104 effective draws with about 2 × 105
draws discarded. This implementation provides not only posterior estimation of parameters and
prevalence of all the three compartments in the SIR model, but also predicts proportions of the infected
and the removed people at future time point(s). The R package for implementing this general model for
understanding disease dynamics is publicly available at https://github.com/lilywang1988/eSIR.

2.1.c. SAPHIRE model
Overview: This model (13) extends the classic SEIR model to estimate COVID-related transmission
parameters, in addition to projecting COVID-19 counts, while accounting for pre-symptomatic
infectiousness, time-varying ascertainment rates, transmission rates and population movements. Figure
3 provides a schematic diagram of the compartments and transitions conceptualized in this model. The
model includes seven compartments: susceptible (S), exposed (E), pre-symptomatic infectious (P),
ascertained infectious (I), unascertained infectious (A), isolation in hospital (H) and removed (R).
Compared with the classic SEIR model, SAPHIRE explicitly models population movement and introduce
two additional compartments (A and H) to account for the fact that only ascertained cases would seek
medical care and thus be quarantined by hospitalization. The model described and implemented here
relies on the same methodology and arguments as presented by the authors of the SAPHIRE model. The
only difference is that while the original model analyzed data from China over a time period of December

2019 to March 2020 (which constituted the initial days of the pandemic in China), we analyze data from
India, for the initial period of the pandemic in India. Additionally, the original manuscript adjusted the
model to account for population movement. With the lockdown in India being severe (several states
closed their respective borders) and data on population movement not being available, we make no such
modifications. Additionally, described in greater detail in the subsequent sections, we note that the
SAPHIRE model returns reported and unreported cumulative COVID-case counts, in addition to
cumulative counts of the removed compartment. As such, for the purpose of comparisons, the SAPHIRE
model is used only to study cumulative COVID-case counts, and not active case counts or cumulative
death counts. The R package for implementing this general model for understanding disease dynamics is
publicly available at https://github.com/chaolongwang/SAPHIRE.

in which the three terms represent infections contributed by pre-symptomatic individuals, unascertained
cases and ascertained cases, respectively. The model adjusts the infectious periods of each type of case
by taking population movement (p/t) and isolation (H9'+ ) into account. For the case of India, we set
p = 0.
Initial states and parameter settings: We set α = 0.55 , assuming lower transmissibility for
unascertained cases. Compartment P contains both ascertained and unascertained cases in the presymptomatic phase. We set the transmissibility of P to be the same as unascertained cases, because it has
previously been reported that the majority of cases are unascertained (26). We assume an incubation
period of 5.2 days and a pre-symptomatic infectious period H; = 2.3 days. The latent period was H6 =
2.9 days. Because pre-symptomatic infectiousness was estimated to account for 44% of the total
infections from ascertained cases (27), we set the mean of total infectious period as EH; + H8 F =
H; /0.44 = 5.2 days, assuming constant infectiousness across the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic
phases of ascertained cases – thus the mean symptomatic infectious period was H8 = 2.9 days. We set a
long isolation period of H: = 30 days, but this parameter has no effect on the model fitting procedure,

or the final parameter estimates. The duration from the onset of symptoms to isolation was estimated to
be H9 = 7 as the median time length from onset to confirmed diagnosis in periods 1 - 4 respectively. On
the basis of the parameter settings above, the initial state of the model is specified on March 15. The
initial number of ascertained symptomatic cases '(0) is specified as the number ascertained cases in
which individuals experienced symptom onset during 12-14 March. The initial ascertainment rate is
assumed to be J% (J% = 2/100) , and thus the initial number of unascertained cases is s(0) =
J%'+ (1 − J% )'(0) . r+ (0) and Z+ (0) denote the numbers of ascertained cases in which individuals
experienced symptom onset during 15–16 March and 17–19 March, respectively. Then, the initial
numbers of exposed and pre-symptomatic individuals are set as Z(0) = J%'+ Z+ (0) and r(0) =
J%'+ r+ (0), respectively. The initial number of the hospitalized cases u(0) is set as half of the cumulative
ascertained cases on 8 March since H9 = 7 and there would be more severe cases among the ascertained
cases in the early phase of the epidemic.
Likelihood and MCMC algorithm: Considering the time-varying strength of control measures
implemented in India over the four lockdown periods, the model assumes that the value of 9 (J)
corresponding to the I !: lockdown period is 98 (J8 ) for I = 1,2,3, 4. The observed number of ascertained
cases in which individuals experience symptom onset on day # – denoted by ~! – is assumed to follow a
Poisson distribution with rate λ! = Jr!'+ H;'+ , with r! denoting the expected number of pre-symptomatic
individuals on day #. The following likelihood equation is used to fit the model using observed data from
March 15 (b% ) to June 18 (b+ ).

and the model is used to predict COVID-counts from June 19 to July 18. A non-informative prior of

the first two moments of the estimate using data from Singapore, as done by the authors of the SAPHIRE

model are more applicable. In the previous subsection we have seen an extension which includes the
‘asymptomatic infectious’ compartment (people who are infected and contributing to the spread of the
virus, but do not show any symptoms). In this model, we use an alternate formulation by defining an
‘untested infectious’ compartment for infected people who are spreading infection but are not tested after
the incubation period. This is necessary because there is a large proportion of infected people who are
not being tested. We have assumed that after the ‘exposed’ node, a person enters the either ‘untested
infectious’ node or the ‘tested infectious’ node. The ‘untested’ node mainly consists of the asymptomatic
people. To incorporate the possible effect of misclassifications due to imperfect testing, we include a
compartment for false negatives (infected people who are tested but reported as negative). As a result,
after being tested, an infected person enters either into the ‘false negative’ node or the ‘tested positive’
node (infected people who are tested and reported to be positive). We keep separate nodes for the
recovered and deceased persons coming from the untested and false negatives nodes which are
‘recovered unreported’ and ‘deceased unreported’ respectively. For the ‘tested positive’ node, the
recovered and death nodes are denoted by ‘recovered reported’ and ‘deceased reported’ respectively.
Thus, we divide the entire population into 10 main compartments: S (Susceptible), E (Exposed), T
(Tested), U (Untested), P (Tested positive), F (Tested False Negative), RR (Reported Recovered), RU
(Unreported Recovered), DR (Reported Deaths) and DU (Unreported Deaths).
Formulation: Like most compartmental models, this model assumes exponential times for the duration
of an individual staying in a compartment. For simplicity, we approximate this continuous-time process
by a discrete-time modeling process. The main parameters of this model are 5 (rate of transmission of
infection by false negative individuals), q; (ratio of rate of spread of infection by tested positive patients
to that by false negatives), qE (scaling factor for the rate of spread of infection by untested individuals),
H6 (incubation period in days), HF (mean days till recovery for positive individuals), H! (mean number
of days for the test result to come after a person is being tested), àG (death rate due to COVID-19 which
is the inverse of the average number of days for death due to COVID-19 starting from the onset of
disease times the probability death of an infected individual due to COVID), 1 and à (natural birth and
death rates respectively, assumed to be equal for the sake of simplicity), J (probability of being tested
for infectious individuals), N (false negative probability of RT-PCR test), 5+ 7p& 5?'+ (scaling factors
for rate of recovery for undetected and false negative individuals respectively), â+ and â?'+ (scaling
factors for death rate for undetected and false negative individuals respectively). The number of
individuals at the time point # in each node is governed by the system of differential equations given by
Equations (8a) – (8i). To simplify this model, we assume that testing is instantaneous. In other words,
we assume there is no time difference from the onset of the disease after the incubation period to getting
test results. This is a reasonable assumption to make as the time for testing is about 1-2 days which is
much less than the mean duration of stay for the other compartments (further, once the person shows
symptoms for COVID-19 like diseases, they are sent to get tested almost immediately). Figure 4 provides
a schematic overview of the model.

where o% = λ/µ = 1 since we assume that natural birth and death rates are equal within this short period
of time. Supplementary Table S1 describes the parameters in greater detail.
Likelihood assumptions and estimation: Using Bayesian estimation techniques and MCMC methods
(namely, Metropolis-Hastings method (29) with Gaussian proposal distribution) for estimating the
parameters. First, we approximated the above set of differential equations using a discrete time
approximation using daily differences. So, after we started with an initial value for each of the
compartments on the day 1, using the discrete time recurrence relations we can find the counts for each
of the compartments at the next days. To proceed with the MCMC-based estimation, we specify the
likelihood explicitly. We assume (conditional on the parameters) the number of new confirmed cases on
day # depend only on the number of exposed individuals on the previous day. Specifically, we use
multinomial modeling to incorporate the data on recovered and deceased cases as well. The joint
conditional distribution is
P[rI6J (#), !I6J (#), HI6J (#)|Z(# − 1), r(# − 1)]

Prior assumptions and MCMC: For the parameter J, we assume a Ç(0,1) prior, while for 5, we assume
an improper non-informative flat prior with the set of positive real numbers as support. After specifying
the likelihood and the prior distributions of the parameters, we draw samples from the posterior
distribution of the parameters using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with a Gaussian proposal
distribution. We run the algorithm for 200,000 iterations with a burn-in period of 100,000. Finally, the
mean of the parameters in each of the iterations are obtained as the final estimates of 5 and J for the
different time periods.

2.1.e. Imperial College London model (ICM)
Overview: Flaxman et al., 2020 introduce a Bayesian semi-mechanistic model for estimating the
transmission intensity of SARS-CoV-2 (7). The model defines a renewal equation using the time-varying
reproduction number !! to generate new infections. As a lot of cases in SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic
and reported case data is unreliable especially in early part of the epidemic in India, the model relies on
observed deaths data and calculates backwards to infer the true number of infections. The latent daily
infections are modeled as the product of !! with a discrete convolution of the previous infections,
weighted using an infection-to-transmission distribution specific to SARS-CoV-2. We implement this
Bayesian semi-mechanistic model in the context of COVID-19 data arising from India in order to
estimate the reproduction number over time, along with plausible upper and lower bounds (95% Bayesian
credible intervals) of the daily infections and the daily number of infectious people. We parametrize !!
with a fixed effect and a random effect for each week over the course of the epidemic for each state. The
fixed effect accounts for the variations in !! across India as a whole whereas the random effect allows
for variations among different states. The weekly effects are encoded as a random walk, where at each
successive step the random effect has an equal chance of moving upwards or downwards from its current
value. The model is implemented using epidemia (30), a general purpose R package for semi-mechanistic
Bayesian modelling of epidemics. Figure 5 represents a schematic overview of the model.
Formulation: The true number of infected individuals, I, is modelled using a discrete renewal process.
We specify a generation distribution (31) v with density v(τ) as v ∼ Gamma(6.5,0.62). Given the
generation distribution, the number of infections I!,3 on a given day #, and state f is given by the
following discrete convolution function:

observed 10 deaths. From this date, we seed our model with 6 sequential days of an equal number of

inferred in our Bayesian posterior distribution.
We estimated parameters jointly for all 20 states. Fitting was done with the R package epidemia (30)
which uses STAN (33), a probabilistic programming language, using an adaptive Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) sample.

2.2 Comparing models and evaluating performance

2.2.a Choice of parameters
In order to implement the models described previously, we make certain assumptions (which are then
utilized in back-calculations) in order to specify the model parameters. The initial reproduction number
is fixed at ! = 3.28(23). Unless mentioned otherwise, the mean time duration (in days) from infection
to onset of symptoms is set at H6 = 5.1(34), while that from onset of symptoms to recovery is set at HF =
17.8(13). The infection fatality rate was set at 0.01(24). The initial mean value of the removal rate is
γ% = 0.5436 and the proportion of death within the removed compartment is 0.01/0.5436 = 0.0184.

2.2.b Metrics used for evaluation of models
Having established differences in the formulation of the different models, we compare their respective
projections and inferences. In order to do so, we use the same data sources(35),(36) for all five models.
Well-defined time points are used to denote training (March 15 to June 18) and test (June 19 to July 18)
periods.
Using the parameter values specified above along with data from the training period as inputs, we
compare the projections of the five models with observed data from the test period. In order to do so, we
use the symmetric mean absolute prediction error (SMAPE) and mean squared relative prediction error
(MSRPE) metrics as a measure of accuracy. Given observed time-varying data {©! }*!D+ and an analogous
time-series dataset of projections {r! }*!D+ , the SMAPE metric is defined as
!D*

|r! − ©! |

odsrZ(©! , r! ) =

and the MSRPE is defined as

It can easily be seen that 0 ≤ odsrZ ≤ 100, with smaller values of both MSRPE and SMAPE
indicating a more accurate fit. The baseline model yield projections of reported COVID-cases alone. The
SAPHIRE and SEIR-fansy models return projections of reported and unreported COVID-cases and
COVID-deaths separately. Finally, projections from ICM include true counts of COVID-cases (i.e., the

sum of reported and unreported cases), in addition to true counts of COVID-deaths. Supplementary Table
S2 gives an overview of output from each of the models we consider.
In order to ensure a fair comparison, we compute the prediction error of reported projections from the
models with respect to the observed data. Since the ICM projections are total counts (sum of reported
and unreported), we do not include the same in this specific comparison method. For cumulative case
counts, the model accuracies (SMAPE and MSRPE) are computed for all other models. For active cases
(and cumulative deaths), accuracies of only the eSIR and SEIR-fansy models may be computed, as no
other model returns projections for reported active case (and death) counts. Further, we compare (when
possible) the estimated time-varying reproduction number !(#) over the four different stages of
lockdown in India. Specifically, for each lockdown stage, we report the median !(#) value along with
the associated 95% confidence interval CI. In addition to a systemic comparison of !(#), we also
compare the projected active reported cases, cumulative cases and deaths on certain dates (specifically,
June 30 and July 10) within the test period. The values are presented in Table 2.
Since we are interested in comparing relative performances of the models (specifically, their projections),
we define another metric – the relative mean squared prediction error (Rel-MSPE). Given time series
data on observed cumulative cases (or deaths) {©! }*!D+ , projections from a model A {r!W }*!D+ , and
projections from some other model B, {r!X }*!D+ , the Rel-MSPE of model B with respect to model A is
defined as

Since the baseline model yields projections of reported cumulative cases alone, we compute Rel-MSPE
for the other models with respect to the baseline model for reported cumulative cases. Projections from
ICM represent total (i.e., sum of reported and unreported) cumulative cases and deaths and are left out
of this comparison of reported counts. For cumulative reported deaths, we compute Rel-MSPE of the
SAPHIRE and SEIR-fansy and relative to the eSIR model. In addition to comparing the accuracy of fits
that arise from the different models, we also investigate if projections from the different models are
correlated with observed data. We use the standard Pearson’s correlation coefficient and Lin’s
concordance correlation coefficient(37) as summary measures to study said correlation. Rel-MSPE and
correlation metrics are presented in Table 3. As before, we carry out our comparisons based on the
reported projections (and not the sum of reported and unreported projections) from the two SEIR models.
No such consideration has to be made for the other three models.
Since two models (SAPHIRE and SEIR-fansy) yield both reported as well as unreported counts of active
or cumulative cases in addition to cumulative deaths, Table 4 reports said counts on two specific dates –
June 30 and July 10.

and other similar articles concerning the spread of this disease in India, we have created an interactive
dashboard (38) summarizing COVID-19 data and forecasts for India and its states.

3. RESULTS

3.1. Estimation of reproduction number
From Table 2, we compare the mean of the time-varying effective reproduction number !(#) over the
four phases of lockdown in India. The eSIR model does not return phase-specific values but returns a
mean value of 2.08 (95% CI: 1.41 to 2.12) over the entire lockdown period. The mean (and 95% CI)
values returned by the SAPHIRE model is 2.08 (95% CI: 2.05 to 2.11) during phase one of the lockdown,
1.42 (95% CI: 1.40 to 1.44) for phase two, 1.24 (95% CI: 1.23 to 1.26) for phase three and 1.28 (95%
CI: 1.27 to 1.29) for the fourth and final lockdown phase. The SEIR-fansy notes that the mean drops from
4.09 (95% CI: 3.99 to 4.20) during the first phase of lockdown, to 1.72 (95% CI: 1.70 to 1.76) during the
fourth lockdown phase. The ICM-based mean values fluctuate, from 1.41 (95% CI: 1.12 to 1.77) during
the first lockdown phase, followed by 1.20 (95% CI: 0.92 to 1.50), then dropping to 1.29 (95% CI: 1.01
to 1.59) and finally rising to 1.41 again (95% CI: 1.11, 1.77) for the fourth phase of lockdown. In terms
of agreement of reported values, SAPHIRE, SEIR-fansy and ICM report the highest mean ! for phase
one of the lockdown. While values reported by SEIR-fansy show a steady decrease over subsequent
lockdown phases, both SAPHIRE and ICM report a drop in intermediate lockdown phases, followed by
a rise. While SAPHIRE reports the lowest value of ! for phase three, ICM reports the lowest value of !
for phase two.

3.2 Estimation of reported case counts
From Figure 6 and Figure 9, we note that the eSIR model overestimates the count of confirmed
cumulative cases – a behavior which gets worse with time. The SAPHIRE, SEIR-fansy and baseline
models slightly underestimate the count, with the baseline model performing the best, followed closely
by SAPHIRE. This observation is supported by Table 2 and Table 3 as well – the projections from the
baseline and SAPHIRE model on two specific dates (June 30 and July 10) are closer to the actual
observed counts as compared to the other models. Additionally, the SMAPE and MSRPE values
associated with the baseline model (1.76% and 0.03, respectively) are smaller than the other models.
Table 2 reveals a consistent behavior of model performance in terms of the SMAPE and MSRPE metrics,
with the baseline model performing the best (SMAPE: 1.76%, MSRPE: 0.03), followed by the SAPHIRE
model (SMAPE: 2.07%, MSRPE: 0.05), then the SEIR-fansy model (SMAPE: 3.20%, MSRPE: 0.06)
and finally, the eSIR model (SMAPE: 23.10, MSRPE: 0.87). Table 3 further reveals a similar comparison
through Rel-MSPE values (all Rel-MSPE figures reported here are relative to the baseline model). The
SAPHIRE model performs the best (Rel-MSPE: 3.819), followed by SEIR-fansy (with Rel-MSPE:
0.579), and finally, the eSIR model (Rel-MSPE: 0.225). All four sets of projections are highly correlated
with the observed time series – with the baseline, SAPHIRE and SEIR-fansy models having a Pearson’s

correlation coefficient of 1 with the observed data, while the eSIR model yields a value of 0.985. Lin’s
concordance coefficient yields an ordering (from best to worst) of the baseline model (0.991), followed
by the SAPHIRE model (0.975), the SEIR-fansy model (0.965) and finally, the eSIR model (0.316).
Comparing confirmed active case counts across models, from Figure 7 and Figure 10, we note a similar
behavior, with the eSIR model consistently overestimating counts, while the SEIR-fansy model performs
the best – Table 2 and Table 3 support this observation. The projection from the SEIR-fansy model are
the closest to the actual observed values on June 30 and July 10. The eSIR model is much further off the
mark. In terms of prediction accuracy, the SEIR-fansy model has an SMAPE value of 0.72% and an
MSRPE value of 0.02. For eSIR model, those values are at 33.83% (SMAPE) and 1.55 (MSRPE).

3.3. Estimation of reported death counts
From Figure 8 and Figure 11, we note that the eSIR and SEIR-fansy models almost always overestimate
the confirmed cumulative death counts. The eSIR model exhibits the poorest performance of the four
models considered here – projecting an exponentially growing death count, whereas the observed data
and projections from the SEIR-fansy model shows a linear-like trend. From Table 2 and Table 3, the
SMAPE and MSRPE values, along with comparison of projections with observed data reveal that the
SEIR-fansy model is the more accurate (SMAPE: 7.13%, MSRPE: 0.19) as compared to the eSIR model
(SMAPE: 26.30%, MSRPE: 1.07). Relative to the eSIR model, the Rel-MSPE values of the models
reveal that the SEIR-fansy model performs better (Rel-MSPE: 7.61). Judging by values of Pearson’s
correlation coefficient, both sets of projections are highly correlated with the observed data. Lin’s
concordance coefficient yields an ordering of SEIR-fansy (0.742), followed by eSIR (0.206).

3.4. Estimation of unreported case and death counts
From Table 4, we observe that the SEIR-fansy model projects the maximum count of active cases and
cumulative deaths on June 30 and July 10, followed by the ICM. The relative ordering of projections is
reversed for cumulative cases, with the ICM projecting maximum case counts, followed by the SEIRfansy model and finally, the SAPHIRE model.
Comparing underreporting factors (total
counts/observed counts), we note that the factors remain fairly comparable over time (June 30 vs July
10). For active case counts and cumulative death counts, the factor is higher for SEIR-fansy as compared
to ICM. For cumulative case counts, SAPHIRE has the highest factor, followed by ICM and finally,
SEIR-fansy.

4. DISCUSSION
In this comparative paper we have described five different models of various stochastic structures that
have been used for modeling SARS-Cov-2 disease transmission in various countries across the world.
We applied them to a case-study in modeling the full disease transmission of the coronavirus in India.
While simulation studies are the only gold standard way to compare the accuracy of the models, here we
were uniquely poised to compare the projected case-counts against observed data on a test period. We
learned several things from these models. While the estimation of the reproduction number is relatively
robust across the models, the prediction of daily active number of cases does show variation across
models. The largest variability across models is observed in predicting the “total” number of infections
including reported and unreported cases. The degree of underreporting has been a major concern in India
and other countries(34). On two specific dates (June 30 and July 10), for cumulative case counts, we
estimate the underreporting factors to be 27.79 and 26.74 respectively from the SAPHIRE model, 7.74
and 7.53 respectively from SEIR-fansy and 9.15 and 7.67 respectively from ICM. Similarly, for
cumulative death counts, SEIR-fansy yields underreporting factors 3.62 on June 30 and 3.99 on July 10,
while ICM notes that the underreporting factor is approximately 2.00 for both dates. With a
comprehensive exposition and a single beta-testing case-study we hope this paper will be useful to
understand the mathematical nuances and the differences in terms of deliverables for the models.

There are several limitations to this work. First and foremost, all model estimates are based on a scenario
where we assumed no change in either interventions or behavior of people in the forecast period. This is
not true as there is tremendous variation in policies across Indian states in the post lock-down phase. We
did observe regional lockdowns that were enacted in the forecast period. None of our models tried to
capture this variability. Second, the five models we compare are a subset of vast amount of work that has
been done in this area, particularly models that incorporate age-specific contact network and
spatiotemporal variation. Finally, an extensive simulation study would be the best way to assess the
models under different scenarios but we have restricted our attention to India. Finally, we only report
point estimates and have not compared the uncertainty estimates from each model which also play a key
role in our choice.

3- < 1 represents the scenario where individuals who test positive are infecting susceptible individuals are a lower rate than infected individuals with false negative test
results. 3/ < 1 is assumed as U mostly consists of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases who are known to spread the disease at a much lower rate than those with
higher levels of symptoms.
Equal to the inverse of the average number of days for death starting from the onset of disease, times the probability of death of an infected individual. Natural birth and
death rates are assumed to be equal for simplicity.
0+ < 1, 0, < 1 are assumed, since the recovery rate is slower for individuals with false negative test results as compared to those who have been hospitalized. The condition
of untested individuals is not as severe as they consist of mostly asymptomatic people. Consequently, they are assumed to recover faster than those with positive test results.

d.

2+ < 1, 2, < 1 are assumed. The death rate for those with false negative test results is assumed to be higher than those with positive test results, since the former are not
receiving proper treatment. For untested individuals, the death rate is taken to be lesser because they are mostly asymptomatic. As a result, their survival probability is much
higher.
