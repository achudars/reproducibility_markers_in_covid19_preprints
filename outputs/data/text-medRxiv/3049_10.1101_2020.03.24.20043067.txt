Summary
To reliably estimate the demand on regional health systems and perform public health planning, it is
necessary to have a good estimate of the prevalence of infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that
causes COVID-19) in the population. In the absence of wide-spread testing, we provide one approach
to infer prevalence based on the assumption that the fraction of true infections needing hospitalization
is fixed and that all hospitalized cases of COVID-19 in Santa Clara are identified.
Our goal is to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, i.e. the true number of people
currently infected with the virus, divided by the total population size.
Our analysis suggests that as of ​March 17, 2020​, there are ​6,500 infections (0.34% of the
population)​ of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County. Based on adjusting the parameters of our model to
be optimistic (respectively pessimistic), the number of infections would be 1,400 (resp. 26,000),
corresponding to a prevalence of 0.08% (resp. 1.36%). If the shelter-in-place led to R​0​ < 1, we would
expect the number of infections to remain about constant for the next few weeks. However, even if this
were true, we expect to continue to see an increase in hospitalized cases of COVID-19 in the short
term due to the fact that infection of SARS-CoV-2 on March 17th can lead to hospitalizations up to 14
days later.

Introduction
Inference of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the US is complicated by the lack of widespread testing.
Testing is unreliable for providing prevalence of the disease in the entire population, because tested
individuals are not representative of the population at large. Tested individuals are selected based on
symptoms, and are necessarily a subset of the total number of individuals infected. There may be many
individuals with few to no symptoms that do not get tested, but nevertheless are vectors for the
SARS-Cov-2 virus.
Testing in the Bay Area has been reliable enough that most individuals hospitalized for pneumonia or
other complications caused by COVID-19 are likely to be tested, and positively identified. Therefore, we

can use these data, along with the hospitalization rate of COVID-19 estimated from other countries to
infer the number of cases in the area that would lead to this level of hospitalization.
Also, given the hospitalization data, we can estimate the rate of growth of cases, and project this
forward to estimate future hospitalizations. Given the shelter-in-place order for our area, our hope is
that R​0​ < 1, starting on March 17th. If we make the optimistic assumption that there are essentially no
new infections after the shelter-in-place order, we still expect hospitalizations to increase for 10 to 14
days, leading to a peak hospital bed demand 3x to 16x greater than at the time of the order; our best
guess is 6x, but the precise ratio would require modeling time lag from infection to symptoms to
hospitalization more precisely, where we defer to ongoing modeling efforts.

Modeling details
Our model is to assume that the number of hospitalizations at any point in time is proportional to the
number of total infections some number of days before, based on the ​lag time​ between infection and
hospitalization.

Simple model
Therefore, to estimate the number of infections on day ​t​, we use the number of hospitalizations ​h(t)​,
and use the formula ​infections(t) = exp(lag time * exponential growth rate) * h(t) / hospitalization rate.​
This can be converted to a prevalence fraction by dividing by the population size. Note that the
hospitalization rate is needed to estimate the total number of infections, but not for forecasting overall
hospital bed demand.

Incremental model
One might be concerned with the above approach because not all past infections would lead to a
hospitalization in lag-time days; only the new infections lead to new admissions. Therefore, we should
look at the increments in the number of hospitalizations to calculate the number of new infections from
the ​lag-time​ days prior. Then, we can sum up the number of new infections up to a given date to get the
cumulative number of infections. It turns out that because of the linearity of the conversion from
hospitalizations to infections, these two approaches will give approximately the same answer.
Therefore, we will stick to the simpler model for the results presented here.

Parameters and data sources
As input parameters to our model, we need an estimate of the ​lag time​, and the ​rate of growth of
infections​, and ​hospitalization rate​ for COVID-19 among those infected. As input data, we need the
number of hospitalizations​, and the ​size of the population​ from which those hospitalizations are drawn.
For the ​lag time​, we need to combine the incubation time and the time for disease progression to
severe symptoms. The median incubation time is estimated to be about 5 days​1​. The time from having
symptoms to needing hospitalization is about 1 week, adding up to 12 days. In the Chinese data, the
lag between the maximum onset proportion at January 23 to the maximum hospitalization at February 4

is 12 days, matching this estimate​2​. We believe these may be slightly overestimated, and use 11 days
in our model.
For the ​rate of growth of infections​, we compared two values: the first estimated from the change in
hospitalizations from March 3 to March 12 in the Santa Clara data, and the second calculated from the
reported 6-9 day doubling time​3​,​4.​ The estimate of the rate of growth of infections from hospitalizations
gives a 14.4% growth per day and the estimate from Chinese data gives 8-12% growth per day.
Because increases in the number of tests performed (which is growing quickly at about 30% per day​5​)
affects the number of confirmed cases, relying on the growth of confirmed cases in the Santa Clara
County will likely overestimate the growth rate of infections, so we use this as our upper bound.
We can approach estimating the ​hospitalization rate​ in three ways. The first is to use the Imperial
College report, which puts hospitalization at about 4.4% 6​​ . The second is to use our institution’s
hospitalization rate among those who test positive for COVID-19, and adjust for the fact that for many,
the disease is mild enough that they do not seek healthcare. If 80% of cases are mild, we can take the
Stanford test-hospitalization rate, which is 18.3% (95% CI 11.7%, 24.9%) and divide by 5 to get the
COVID-19 hospitalization rate of 3.66%. The third approach is to use the hospitalization rate from
China​7​, and adjust for the fact that many infections could have been missed. This value is likely an
overestimate due to substantial under-reporting in China 8​​ ​9​.
The ​number of hospitalizations​ are drawn from Santa Clara county’s reports on the number of
hospitalizations, using the Internet Archive ​Wayback Machine​. Therefore, these are drawn from a
population of 1.938 million people. This population could be larger, or smaller, depending on whether
everyone in the county goes to hospitals in the county, and whether these are the only people going to
Santa Clara hospitals.

Parameter uncertainty
Because we do not know many of the parameters exactly, we bracket them between a lower bound and
upper bound, and a best guess based on what we know so far. We use each of these (lower bound,
upper bound and best guess) to obtain the number of inferred infections and prevalence.
The parameters are summarized below in Table 1. Our lower bounds are a 10.5% increase in infections
per day, a 5 day lag time and a 6.2% hospitalization rate of the infected population. Our best guesses
are a 15% increase in infections per day, an 11 day lag time, and a 4% hospitalization rate. Our upper
bounds are a 22% increase in infections per day, a 12 day lag time, and a 2.3% hospitalization rate.
We can perform a sensitivity analysis under a variety of sampled estimates of these parameters,
drawing uniformly over the range specified above, and re-running the analysis a 1000 times. Below, we
report the range and quartiles of these analyses.

Results
The inferred number of infections for March 17 is 6,500, and the lower and upper bounds are 1,400 and
26,000, respectively. These estimates provide a prevalence of 0.34%, with bounds of 0.08% to 1.36%
(Table 1). If the shelter-in-place order worked, this would be the expected maximum prevalence in the
area, until people recover. Unfortunately, we will not know until about March 27-31 if this is the case, at
which point we expect the number of hospitalizations to plateau. The detailed results are in Table 2.
Table 3 contains the sensitivity analysis where we consider other combinations of the parameters in the
ranges provided, and rerun our analysis with 1000 randomly selected combinations. The results are
similar to those reported above, although they cluster closer to the best guess of parameters.

Discussion
It’s unclear if hospitalizations are a reliable source of data or not. One thing we noticed is that the
numbers are small, and so directly fitting a model for log(hospitalizations) as a function of days since
the outbreak does not give a very good estimate of the growth rate over time. This may be because
doing so is sensitive to noise. However, we think that while this may be more sensitive to noise, it is
less sensitive to selection biases, and therefore may serve as a more reliable estimate of prevalence
than positive testing rates.
There has been some discussion of deploying a randomized testing program. If the prevalence of
COVID-19 is between 0.13% and 1.36%, then such a prevalence estimate has implications for the size
of the testing necessary to get a reliable estimate of prevalence. To have at least 10 positive samples,
somewhere between 1,000 and 10,000 randomly selected individuals would need to be tested. To have
enough to have good statistical resolution may require many more. However, doing at least 5,000 tests
would help us to identify if we are in the right ballpark, in terms of prevalence.
One question that comes up from these analyses is when would we expect the number of infections to
plateau after the shelter-in-place order, if the order were to stop or reduce the spread to below
exponential growth. Such an order should immediately affect the number of infections that we projected
here, so that the number of infections does not grow beyond that of March 17th, and starts to dwindle
after the 14-21 day course of the virus infection. However, because of the lag between infection and
hospitalization, we expect the number of new hospitalizations to continue to increase for another 12
days. The lag time varies between 3 and 12 days​1​, therefore, we would expect to see a slight change in
rate of increase of hospitalizations in about 1 week from March 17th; the number of hospitalizations will
still continue to increase and only the rate of increase will slow. Due to such large variance in the

and reactively changing policy before the 12 days after the shelter-in-place may not be appropriate.
