Smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 positivity, while Never-smoking
reduces the risk
Samson Barasa,1 Josephine Kiage-Mokaya,2 Katya Cruz-Madrid,3 Michael Friedlander,1
Introduction:
Does smoking decrease the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 because the never-smokers (84%)
prevalence is high and the current-smokers prevalence is low among COVID-19 positive patients? 1,2 ’3,
4,5, 6
We sought to determine whether never smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 positivity among
the 50 to 69-year old patients because they are more likely to test positive for COVID-19.7

Method:
We conducted a retrospective chart review of COVID-19 Polymerase chain reaction, in-hospital tested
≥18-year-old patients. A Poisson regression analysis stratified into never-smokers and history of
smoking (current + former smokers) was conducted.

Results:
277 COVID-19 negative and 117 COVID-19 positive patients’ charts with a never-smokers prevalence of
42.32% and 54% respectively were analyzed. The never-smokers prevalence was 54%, 20-39-years;
61 %, 40 -49-years; 41%, 50 – 69-years; and 43%, 70 – 100-years.
The 40-49-year-old current and former smokers were more likely to test positive for
COVID-19 [1.309 (1.047 - 1.635)], unlike the 40-49-year-old never-smokers [0.976 (0.890- 1.071)] who
had a lower risk.
Regardless of their smoking status, males [1.084(1.021 - 1.151)] and the 50-69-year-old patients
[1.082 (1.014 -1.154)] were more likely to test positive for COVID-19, while end stage renal disease
[0.908(0.843- 0.978)] and non-COVID-19 respiratory viral illness [0.907 (0.863 - 0.953)] patients had a
lower risk of COVID-19 positivity.
Heart failure [0.907 (0.830 - 0.991)], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) [0.842 (0.745 - 0.952)] and Parkinson’s disease [0.823 (0.708 - 0.957)] never-smokers were
less likely to test positive for COVID-19.

Conclusion:
This is the first study to show that smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 positivity among
the 40-49-year-old patients, while not smoking reduces the risk of COVID-19 positivity among the heart
failure, COPD and Parkinson’s disease patients. This study emphasizes that COVID-19 positivity risk is
not reduced by smoking and not increased by not smoking.

Smoking increases the risk of COVID-19 positivity, while Never-smoking
reduces the risk
Introduction
The association between smoking and COVID-19 infection is unclear. It has been speculated that
smoking reduces the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 because the prevalence of current and
former smokers is low among COVID-19 positive patients, while the prevalence of never smokers is
high among COVID-19 positive patients. 1,2 ’3 , 4,5, 6
On the other hand, an increased risk of morbidity, mortality and need for mechanical ventilator
support has been reported among COVID-19 positive current and former smokers. 2
The 50-69-year-olds are more likely to test positive for COVID-19.7 If smoking reduces the risk of
testing positive for COVID-19, is the prevalence of current-smokers low and or the prevalence of
never-smokers high among the 50-69-year-olds?
Does never smoking really increase or decrease the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 among
hospitalized patients?
We sought to determine whether smoking increases the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 among
the 50-69-year-old patients by stratifying patients into never smokers and those with history of
smoking (current and former smokers).

Methodology
Study population and setting
A retrospective chart review of patients who were tested for COVID-19 during hospitalization using the
PCR test, between 2nd February 2020 and 21st October 2020 was conducted in Eugene, Oregon United
States of America (USA). The study enrollees were 18 years and older. The PeaceHealth institutional
review board (IRB) approved the study and waived the written informed consent requirement.
Data collection
The Microsoft Access software was used to manage data after being extracted from the electronic
medical records.
Risk factors
Data was obtained from documents and laboratory tests completed during hospitalization.
Lymphopenia data was gathered from the complete blood count results. While the non-COVID-19
respiratory viral illness data was collected from the respiratory viral panel results. In addition, the
following risk factors were examined: age, diabetes mellitus, stroke, dementia, congestive heart failure
(CHF), COPD, asthma, systemic lupus erythromatosus (SLE), organ transplant, chronic kidney disease
stage 3 (CKD-3), end stage renal disease (ESRD), coronary artery disease (CAD), smoking, hypertension,
Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, demyelination disease, human immune-deficiency virus (HIV)
infection and body mass index (BMI.

Outcome: The study outcome was the COVID-19 PCR test result.
Statistical analysis
Our study hypothesized that the 50-69-year old current plus former-smokers had a higher risk of
testing positive for COVID-19 than the 50- to 69-year-old never-smokers.
Data was stratified into never- smokers versus history of smoking (current plus former smokers) and
analyzed using the Generalized Poisson regression analysis while adjusting for the aforementioned risk
factors. The statistical analysis was performed using STATA version 15.

Smoking and COVID-19
Figure 1 below shows that while COVID-19 positive patients had a significantly lower prevalence of
current smokers (9%), they also had a higher prevalence of never smokers (54%) compared to
COVID-19 negative patients. Both COVID-19 positive (37 %) and negative (39.33%) patients had an
almost equal former-smokers’ prevalence.

The 50 to 69-year olds had a higher risk of testing positive for COVID-19. Besides that, males had a
higher risk of testing positive for COVID-19, while patients with CHF history, ESRD, HIV positive and
non-COVID-19 respiratory viral illness patients had a lower risk of testing positive for COVID-19. A

Is never smoking a confounder?
The analysis in tables 2 above shows that the association between COVID-19 status and age is not
confounded by never smoking. Similarly, never smoking doesn’t confound the association between
COVID-19 status and Gender, CHF, HIV or non-COVID-19 respiratory viral illness.

Section 1 of table 3 below shows partial results for the analysis of COVID-19 status and age among
those with history of smoking (current and former smokers). The 40 to 49-year olds were more likely to

were less likely to test positive for COVID-19. Please find the complete stratified analysis results of

Section 2 of table 3 above shows partial results of COVID-19 status and age association among the
never smokers. Age was not significantly associated with COVID-19 status, although 40 to 49-year old
patients were less likely to test positive for COVID-19. Stroke, COPD, CHF history, CKD, Parkinson’s
disease and non-COVID-19 respiratory viral illness patients were less likely to test positive for
COVID-19.
The difference between the never smokers and those with history of smoking (current plus former
smokers) among COPD, CHF, Parkinson disease and the 40-49-year-old patients was significantly
different as shown by the homogeneity test in Supplementary 1 table S3.
The COVID-19 and age analysis among the never smoker and current smokers (excluding former
smokers) shown in supplementary 2 tables, generated similar results to the analysis of never smokers
versus those with history of smoking (current smokers +former smokers) presented above.

Discussion
We found that 40-49-year-old current and former smokers were more likely to test positive for
COVID-19. Although males and the 50-69-year-old patients were at higher risk of testing positive for
COVID-19, smoking status had no influence on their COVID-19 positivity risk.
CHF, COPD and Parkinson disease never smokers were less likely to test positive for COVID-19. On the
other hand, non-COVID-19 respiratory viral illness and ESRD disease patients had a lower risk of testing
positive for COVID-19 regardless of their smoking status.
What we know about COVID-19 and Smoking
To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that smoking increases the risk of testing positive for
COVID-19, while never smoking reduces the risk of COVID-19 positivity.
The association between COVID-19 and smoking has attracted a lot interest,8,9,10,11 with some
speculating that smoking reduces the risk of COVID-19 infection, given that published research has
found a high prevalence of never smokers and a low prevalence of current smokers among COVID-19
positive patients. 1,2’3 However, these studies never compared COVID-19 positive and negative
patients.
According to the WHO scientific brief on smoking and COVID-19 last updated on June 30th 2020, “there
are no peer-reviewed articles assessing the risk of COVID-19 among smokers”.12 There are 3 yet to be
peer reviewed publications conducted in Israel, United Kingdom (UK) and France assessing smoking
and COVID-19 status.13,14, 15
The Israel study found that never smokers had a higher risk of testing positive for COVID-19 compared
to current and former smokers, while the UK study found no association between smoking and COVID19 positivity.13,14 On the other hand, the France study found that COVID-19 positive patients on
nicotine replacement therapy without smoking related diseases (all types of cancer, cardiovascular and

respiratory diseases) were less likely to be hospitalized, whereas nicotine replacement therapy was not
associated with the risk of hospitalization among COVID-19 positive patients with smoking related
diseases.15
Sarah et al found the odds of current-smokers self-reporting to have been diagnosed with COVID-19
higher than never-smokers, in a UK online and telephone survey examining COVID-19 mental and
social impact;16 it is unclear whether participants had a COVID-19 PCR test. 16
Despite the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 among smokers being unclear, current smokers and
former smokers have a higher risk of morbidity, mortality and need for mechanical ventilation during
hospitalization compared to COVID-19 never smokers.2 On the other hand, countries with the lowest
prevalence of smoking have the highest COVID-19 mortality, while countries with the highest smoking
prevalence have the lowest COVID-19 mortality according to Norden et al.17
Strengths of this study
Our study compared patients who tested positive and negative for COVID-19 during hospitalization and
stratified them based on their smoking status [never smokers versus history of smoking (current +
former smokers)]. Moreover, the smoking status data was collected at the time of COVID-19 testing in
our study.
Although the Israel study compared COVID-19 positive and negative patients, they didn’t stratify
patients based on their smoking status.13 In addition, the smoking status in the Israel study was
collected during prior medical visits before the COVID-19 pandemic.
Israel et al conducted a case controlled study using data of patients who sought (out-patient and inpatient) care from the Israel health care network.13 Each COVID-19 positive patient was matched to
five COVID-19 negative patients of the same sex, age and ethnicity or religion.13 Most of the enrollees
in the Israel study were not hospitalized, while most of our study enrollees were hospitalized. 13 Israel
et al found that never-smokers were more likely to test positive for COVID-19 compared to current and
former smokers, in contrast to our study findings.13
Cho et al14 in the UK study compared COVID-19 positive and negative patients enrolled in a large
prospective study between 2006 and 2010, aimed at studying genetics, environment and lifestyle
determinants in UK; 14 in contrast, our study examined hospitalized patients in USA. The smoking status
data in the UK study was collected during enrollment between 2006 to 2010.14 Cho et al study
stratified patients based on gender and excluded patients with respiratory disease; 14 while our study
stratified patients based on their smoking status and included patients with respiratory disease.
Consistent with the non-stratified results of our study, Cho et al found that current and past smoking
was not associated with testing positive for COVID-19 compared to never smoking. 14
The France study compared people who were reimbursed and those not reimbursed for nicotine
replacement therapy. Nicotine therapy reimbursed patients were assumed to have been currentsmokers. However, nicotine replacement therapies are prescribed to patients who quit smoking to

prevent nicotine craving and smoking relapse. 15 Therefore, patients who were not reimbursed for
nicotine replacement therapy could have been current-smokers, never-smokers or former-smokers
denied nicotine replacement reimbursement.
Prevalence of smoking
The WHO brief reported that 1.4 – 18.5% of all hospitalized patients were current smokers.12 In
consistent with the WHO brief, our study found that 15.76% of our study enrollees were current
smokers.
The UK and Israel studies examined non-hospitalized (majority) and hospitalized enrollees. 13,14 The UK
study (16.6%) had a higher prevalence of COVID-19 positive currents smokers compared to the Israel
study (9.8%).13,14 Similarly the UK study (26.95%) had a higher prevalence of COVID-19 positive former
smokers in contrast to the Israel (11.6%) study. 13,14 On the other hand, the Israel study (78.5%) had a
higher prevalence of COVID-19 positive never smokers compared to the UK study (52.6%).13, 14
The prevalence of current smokers among COVID-19 positive patients was similar in the Cleveland
study (8.6%) and our study (8.91%) during hospitalization.3 On the other hand, the mainland China and
the New York, USA studies reported a 12.6% and 5.1% current smoking prevalence respectively among
hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients.1,2
The mainland china (1.9%) study had the lowest prevalence of COVID-19 positive former smokers
compared to the Cleveland clinic (36.4%), New York study (19.9%) and our study (37%).2,3’4The
prevalence of COVID-19 positive never smokers was similar in the New York (84.4%) and the mainland
China (85.4%) studies,1,2 while our study and the Cleveland Clinic USA study had a low and similar
never smokers’ prevalence of 54% and 52 % respectively for COVID-19 positive patients3.
Age and Smoking
Studies with a higher median and interquartile age [our study 61 years (48 -73 years) and the Cleveland
clinic 64.37 years (54.83 – 76.58 years) study]3 had a lower prevalence of never smokers and a higher
prevalence of former smokers, while studies with a lower median and interquartile age [the Mainland
China 47 years (35 -58 years) and the Israel 39.54 years (27.38-58.26 years) studies] tended to have a
higher never smokers’ prevalence and a low former smokers’ prevalence.2,13
Contrary to the aforementioned trend, the Richardson et al and Goyal et al New York studies with a
median and interquartile age of [63 years (52-75 years)] and [62.2 years (48.6 -73.7 years)] respectively
had a high never smokers’ prevalence of 75 and 84% respectively,1,4 while the Seattle study with a
median age of 69 years also had a high never smokers’ prevalence of 74%.6 The UK study neither
reported the median nor the interquartile age.14
Studies with a higher prevalence of never smokers had a low prevalence of former smokers and vice
versa, since the current smoker’s prevalence (5.1% to 12.6 %) varied minimally irrespective of the
median and the interquartile age of the COVID-19 positive enrollees.

According to the CDC, the 25 to 44 year olds and 45 to 64-year olds have the highest current smoking
prevalence of 16.5% and 16.3% respectively in the USA general population.18 While the current
smoking prevalence among the 18 to 24 year olds and those ≥ 65-years old is 7.8% and 8.4%
respectively.18
On the other hand, our study found that the 70- to 100-year-old patients had the lowest prevalence of
current smokers (4.79%) while all the other age groups [(20-39-years), (40–49-years) and (50-69years)] had a similar current smokers’ prevalence of approximately 23%.
Our study found that 40-49-year-old current and former smokers had a higher risk of testing positive
for COVID-19 compared to the 20-to-39-year-old current and former smokers, despite both age groups
having a similar current smokers’ prevalence. However, the 40-to-49-year-olds had a lower former
smokers’ prevalence; perhaps the lower former-smokers’ prevalence increased the 40-49-year olds risk
of COVID-19 positivity. On the other hand, the 40-49-year-old never smokers had a lower COVID-19
positivity risk, though not significant statistically. Moreover, the 50-69-year-old patients were more
likely to test positive for COVID-19 regardless of their smoking status.
Medical comorbidities
The Israel et al study found that obese patients were more likely to test positive for COVID-19
[1.172(1.084-1.267)] while patients with hypertension [0.834(0.738-0.941)], asthma [0.766(0.6540.896)] and malignancy [0.788(0.677-0.917)] were less likely to test positive for COVID-19.13 However,
the Israel study used BMI calculated from weight and height collected prior to the COVID-19
pandemic.13
The UK study found that > 80 years old men [1.92(1.08-3.41)], men with a BMI of 27- <30 [1.64 (1.122.39)] and men with a BMI of ≥30, [1.60(1.10-2.32)] were more likely to test positive for COVID-19.14
However, the BMI in the UK study was calculated from weight and height collected during enrollment
between 2006 -2010.14 In contrast, our study found that BMI and the 70 to 100-year olds were not
associated with testing positive for COVID-19. Moreover, the UK study didn’t control for COPD because
they excluded patients with respiratory disease.14
Our study found that CHF history, COPD and Parkinson disease never smokers had a lower risk of
testing positive for COVID-19, while ESRD and non-COVID-19 respiratory viral illness patients had a
lower risk of testing positive for COVID-19.
Pathogenesis of COVID-19 among smokers
It has been hypothesized that the COVID-19 virus attaches to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2
(ACE-2) receptors using the spike (S) glycoprotein during pulmonary epithelial cell entry.19 Current
smokers, former smokers and COPD patients are more likely to have an increased ACE-2 expression in
their small airways20,21,22

Our study found that, although 40-49-year-old former and current smokers were at higher risk of
testing positive for COVID-19 than the 20-39-year olds, the prevalence of current smokers was not
significantly different between the 40 to 49-year olds and the 20 to 39-year olds. On the other hand,
COPD never smokers were less likely to test positive for COVID-19, while COPD current and former
smokers were neither at a higher risk nor at lower risk of testing positive for COVID-19.
Our study suggests that having an increased expression of ACE-2 receptors alone doesn’t increase the
risk of testing positive for COVID-19, given that that current smokers, former smokers and COPD
patients have an increased ACE-2 expression.20
Limitations:
Limitations of our study included missing data and not all patients had laboratory tests done. Even
though we didn’t have data on how long the former smokers had quit smoking, the analysis of never
smokers versus current smokers (excluding former smokers) shown in supplementary S2 yielded
similar results.

Conclusion
Based on our study findings, smoking increases the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 among the 40
to 49-year-old current and former smokers, while never smoking reduces the risk of testing positive for
COVID-19 among the CHF, COPD and Parkinson disease patients.
Regardless of their smoking status, males and the 50-69-year-olds are more likely to test positive for
COVID-19, while ESRD and non-COVID-19 respiratory viral illness patients are less likely to test positive
for COVID-19.
Our study emphasizes that smoking doesn’t reduce the risk of testing positive for COVID-19, while
never smoking doesn’t increase the risk of COVID-19 positivity, despite COVID-19 positive patients
having a low current-smokers’ prevalence and a high never-smokers’ prevalence.
