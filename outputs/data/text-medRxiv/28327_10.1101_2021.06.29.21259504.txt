Abstract:
A recent study analysed the relationship between neutralising antibody response and
protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection across eight vaccine platforms1. The efficacy results
from a phase 2b/3 trial of a ninth vaccine candidate, CVnCoV (CUREVAC), was announced on
16 June 20212. The low efficacy of this new mRNA vaccine, which showed only 47%
protection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, was surprising given the high efficacy of
two previous mRNA-based vaccines3,4. A number of factors have been suggested to play a
role in the low efficacy in the CVnCoV study, particularly around the dose and
immunogenicity of the vaccine (which uses an unmodified mRNA construct5,6) and the
potential role of infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants (which were the dominant strains
observed in the CVnCoV trial)2.
Main text:
To investigate the potential effects of dose and immunogenicity in the CVnCoV construct we
extracted data on in vitro neutralisation titre for three reported mRNA vaccines, CVnCoV6,
mRNA-12737, and BNT162b28. To allow comparison of neutralisation levels between studies
we normalised to the average convalescent titre in the same study (recognising that
convalescent groups were not standardised between studies). Figure 1a compares dose and
neutralisation levels across the 3 vaccines and suggests that the lower neutralisation in the
CVnCoV study is consistent with the neutralisation observed when lower doses of mRNA12737, and BNT162b28 were administered.
Another factor suggested to affect the observed vaccine efficacy was the circulating SARSCoV-2 variant viruses encountered during the CVnCoV trial. In the primary phase 3 studies
used for licensure of the other eight vaccines, the ancestral virus (which matches the spike
protein used as the vaccine immunogen) was the dominant strain in circulation1. However,
more recent non-randomised studies have suggested a reduced efficacy of some of these
vaccines against SARS-CoV2 variants9. In vitro studies have shown that many SARS-CoV-2
variants show a significant reduction in neutralisation titre compared to the ancestral virus,
and that this effect is observed using serum from both convalescent and vaccinated
subjects10,11. In the CVnCoV phase 3 trial the infecting virus was composed almost entirely of
a variety of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. For example, the alpha (B.1.1.7) variant

represented about 41% of infections in the CVnCoV trial and has been shown by others to
have a 2.3-fold drop in neutralising titre compared to the ancestral virus for another mRNA
vaccine10. Similarly, the beta (B.1.351), gamma (P.1) and delta (B.1.617.2) variants have
been shown to have a 5.8, 3.2-fold and 6.3-fold drop in neutralising titre respectively10,11.
To visualise the potential effects of reduced neutralising level on vaccine efficacy, Figure 1b
plots the in vitro neutralising titre (normalised to the mean convalescent sera) against the
ancestral virus observed in the CVnCoV phase 1 / 2 study6 along with the observed efficacy
in the Phase 3 trial. It also shows the predicted effects of the drop in neutralisation titre for
the different variants listed above10,11. The observed efficacy against variants appears
consistent with the initial level of neutralisation against the ancestral virus and the expected
drop in neutralisation titre to variants (as reported for other mRNA vaccines).
This analysis suggests that both a lower dose than the other mRNA vaccines (Fig 1a), as well
as the effects of SARS-CoV-2 variants in reducing the neutralising ability of vaccine-induced
serological responses (Fig 1b) were significant contributors to the low efficacy observed in
the CVnCoV study.
