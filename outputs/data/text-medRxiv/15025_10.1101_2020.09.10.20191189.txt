Abstract
COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted the healthcare and economy on a global scale. It is widely
recognized that mass testing is an efficient way to contain the infection spread as well as the
development of informed policies for disease management. However, the current COVID-19
worldwide infection rates increased demand in the rapid and reliable screening of SARS-CoV-2
infection.
We compared the performance of qRT-PCR in direct heat-inactivated, heat-inactivated/pelleted
samples against RNA in a group of 74 subjects (44 positive and 30 negative). In addition, we
compared the sensitivity of heat-inactivated/pelleted in another group of 196 COVID-19 positive
samples.
Our study suggests that swab sample heat-inactivation and pelleting show higher accuracy for
SARS-CoV-2 detection PCR assay compared to heat-inactivation only (89% vs 83% of the
detection in RNA). The accuracy of detection using direct samples varied depending on the sample
transport and storage media as well as the concentration of viral particles.
Our study suggests that purified RNA provides more accurate results, however, direct qRT-PCR
may help to significantly increase testing capacity. Switching to the direct sample testing is
justified if the number of tests is doubled at least.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. It was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province,
China, in December 2019, and the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus was already shared
in January 2020 [2], [3]. The current COVID-19 worldwide infection rates and a high proportion
of asymptomatic cases forced an unexpected burden on the health care systems worldwide and led
to massive, rapid, affordable, and efficient diagnostic tests for daily screening.
The current standard method for the detection of RNA viruses in clinical diagnostics is based on
the extraction of RNA from a nasopharyngeal swab in viral transport media (VTM) followed by
reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) [4]. Additionally, the
existing protocol was optimized to one-step qRT-PCR, which removes the need for a separate
reverse-transcription (RT) step resulting in complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis from the viral
RNA template [5]. However, in many sites, automatic isolation is not available, while manual
isolation takes 2-4 hours and requires significant work that can result in additional experimental
errors as well as limits the possibilities to extend testing capacity. On the other hand, there is also
a risk of reagent shortage in major kit suppliers. Therefore, the ability to omit the RNA purification
from diagnostic protocols would be not only affordable, operative, and efficient for COVID-19
screening, but also keeps the use of commercial kits to the minimum. The options of detection of
viral RNA by qRT-PCR directly from VTM, UTM (Universal Transport Medium) media have
been already explored [4–8]. The results are promising, however, it has been shown that Ct values
in those samples are shifted compared to the Ct values from purified RNA samples, which could
cause a decrease of sensitivity. And as a consequence, the “false-negative” results increase. Here

we optimized two different protocols for qRT-PCR with direct samples and systematically
compared them with the current detection assay with RNA extraction.
Materials and methods
Samples
We collected paired nasopharyngeal swabs and RNA samples from 270 patients. The first group
of 76 samples was collected randomly, without knowing the sample status. The second group of
196 samples was collected from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients only. The RNA and
nasopharyngeal swab samples were obtained from the National Center for Disease Control and
Prevention of MH RA, National Centre For Aids Prevention of MH RA, and Davidyants
Laboratories. Swab samples were stored in three different transport media types: Sample Storage
Reagent (Sansure Biotech, China) (n = 45) media, PBS (n = 91) and STORE-F UTM (DNA
technologies, Russia) (n = 134). No additional clinical or demographic information was collected.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Institute of Molecular Biology
NAS RA (IRB#: 00004079).
RNA extraction
RNA extraction was performed using both automated and manual extraction protocols. Automated
extraction (45 samples) was performed using Maxwell RSC Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification
Kit (Promega Corporation Inc, US). Manual extraction was performed using a triazole based
PREP-NA kit (87 samples) (DNA Technologies Ltd, Russian Federation) and magnetic beadbased ZipPrime nucleic acid isolation kit (64 samples) (ZipPrime Ltd, Turkey) according to the
manufacturer’s manuals.

Direct sample with heat-inactivation
To skip RNA extraction, 20 μl of swab samples in transport media were heat-inactivated at 95 °C
for 5 min before loading into the PCR.
Direct sample with inactivation and pelleting
To skip RNA extraction, 100-300 μl of swab samples in transport media were heat-inactivated at
95 °C for 5 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 12000 g. The supernatant was aspirated to leave 2030 μl liquid in a tube. Pellet was mixed by pipetting or vortexing and used in PCR.
qRT-PCR
We performed real-time qRT-PCR targeting the N gene and ORF1ab gene in the conserved region
of the new coronavirus genome [2]. The final reaction volume consisted of 10 μl PCR reaction

Data analysis
Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for PCR assays were calculated using caret and epiR
packages available in the R software environment for statistical computing. The Wilcoxon
matched rank test was used to compare differences in Ct values in matching samples.
Results and discussion
For this part of the study, we performed qRT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 using matched RNA,
heat-inactivated (H), and heat-inactivated and pelleted (HC) samples from 74 patients.
Nasopharyngeal swabs were stored in PBS (n = 47) and STORE-F UTM (n = 27) for 12-72 hours
at +4 °C. The RNA extraction method was compared to the direct addition of samples to the qRTPCR with and without centrifugation. The results suggest that the centrifugation step considerably
improved accuracy and sensitivity compared with the heat-inactivation alone (Table 1).

The low sensitivity values in both HC and H could be partially attributed to the issues of detection
in samples with low concentration of viral particles close to the detection limit. Interestingly, in
these samples, Ct values were mostly detected only by one channel. In fact, in samples with RNA
Ct values < 34, the sensitivity for heat-inactivation was 93% (28/30) and for heat-inactivation and
pelleting was 97% (29/30). Only one sample with Ct value < 20 was missed using HC samples
compared to purified RNA.
On the other side, we report three positive HC samples that hadn’t been detected with the extracted
nucleic acid. These samples were positive with Ct values around 22 (not detected in RNA), 32 (Ct
> 40 in RNA), and 35 (Ct > 40 in RNA). These samples were also positive in heat-inactivation
treatment alone, however, with higher Ct values compared to HC. We suggest that this discrepancy
could be a result of a failure during RNA isolation steps using manual extraction protocol.
We also compared the differences between Ct values (ΔCt) obtained in purified RNA with Ct
values obtained in heat-inactivated and heat-inactivated and pelleted samples (Table 2). In
agreement with the previous studies, we also observed a considerable shift of Ct values towards
higher values in direct samples. Meanwhile, the median ΔCt was lower by 1.55 and 2.29 cycles
(Wilcoxon signed-rank test p = 0.0018 and < 0.0001 for FAM and HEX channels, accordingly) in
HC samples compared to H samples (Figure 1A). We also observed cases where Ct values for HC
and H samples were smaller compared to the detection in RNA samples (Figure 1B), which
indicates that the omitting of RNA processing steps can reduce degradation. Thus, our results show
that additional centrifugation and pelleting steps can improve the sensitivity of the detection of
viral nucleic acids without much affecting the workflow of the direct PCR.

Next, we compared the performance of SARS-CoV-2 PCR detection in heat-inactivated (H) and
pelleted (HC) samples with the detection in RNA in the larger group of COVID-19 positive
samples (Table 3). From 196 samples the HC was able to detect virus 171 samples with the overall
sensitivity of 88% (CI95%` 83% – 92%).

Further analyses showed that detection sensitivity varies depending on both transportation media
and concentration of viral particles. In general, the sensitivity of detection in HC samples increases
along with the increase of viral particle concentrations (Table 4). Moreover, the sensitivity of
detection in HC samples differs depending on the transport media in which a sample was stored.
The best performance was obtained with Sample Storage Reagent (Sansure Biotech, China) media,
followed by PBS and STORE-F UTM (DNA technologies, Russia). However, it should be also
mentioned that sample storage time and conditions were not uniform before PCR assay, and we
were not able to obtain exact information for each sample. These factors could also affect the
performance of the direct assay.

Discussion
The standard molecular diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 is a multistep process that requires viral
RNA extraction and qRT-PCR implementation. Due to increased demand in the rapid and reliable
screening of this virus, alternative protocols with similar sensitivity are needed. Efforts to simplify
the current methods are critical to assess the viral spread and limit the pandemic, as well as could
benefit patients' care. Recent attempts have been made to omit viral RNA extraction to simplify

the direct qRT-PCR protocol of COVID-19 detection and also assess the impact of different swab
storage media composition on PCR efficiency [7]–[10]. However, most of the studies are done
with small sample size, and needs to be expanded for better understanding performance and
caveats associated with direct sample testing,
In this study, we compared different direct qRT-PCR methods (without nucleic acid extraction).
Overall, we observed consistent results for SARS-CoV-2 detection, however, the average Ct
values for both direct methods were higher than for extracted RNA samples. Our study suggests
that heat-inactivation and pelleting have more sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection PCR assay
compared to heat-inactivation only. For the HC method +4.65 (for ORF1ab gene) and +5.53 (for
N gene) median Ct differences were detected compared to purified nucleic acid samples. This
could be for several reasons: i) for the same input volume of samples nucleic acid extraction yields
higher quantity/quality of RNA compared with the direct sample; ii) RNA extraction was
performed from fresh swab samples, while the aliquots used for the direct method had been stored
at +4 °C for at least one day before heat-inactivation and PCR. The storage duration is known to
cause the shift of results by 2-3 Ct compared to Ct values for eluates of matched fresh aliquots of
the same nasopharyngeal specimens [11].
The overall sensitivity of 88% in our study was comparable to 87.8% (n = 41) reported by AlcobaFlorez et al. and was a bit lower than 93% (n = 77) reported by Brown et al., however the sample
size in both studies were much smaller [5], [9]. We also demonstrated that detection accuracy with
direct sample testing highly depends on the concentration of viral particles in the sample, and the
reliability of direct testing dramatically decreases in the samples with viral particle concentrations
close to the limits of detection.

In conclusion, our results indicate that the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in isolated and purified RNA
samples provides more reliable results, and direct methods are characterized by an increase of
false-negative detections. On the other side, omitting the isolation step may help to significantly
increase testing capacity, and switching to direct sample testing is justified if the number of tests
is doubled at least.
