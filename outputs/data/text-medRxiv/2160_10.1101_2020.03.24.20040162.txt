Lactate dehydrogenase, a Risk Factor of Severe COVID-19 Patients: A
Retrospective and Observational Study

Abstract
BACKGROUND
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) a public health emergency of global concern. Updated analysis of cases
might help identify the characteristic and risk factors of the illness severity.
METHODS
We extracted data regarding 47 patients with confirmed COVID-19 from Renmin
Hospital of Wuhan University between February 1 and February 18, 2020. The degree
of severity of COVID-19 patients (severe vs. non-severe) was defined at the time of
admission according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines for communityacquired pneumonia (CAP).
RESULTS
The median age was 64.91 years, 26 cases (55.31%) were male of which, and 70.83%
were severe cases. Severe patients had higher APACHE II (9.92 vs 4.74) and SOFA
(3.0 vs 1.0) scores on admission, as well as the higher PSI (86.13 vs 61.39), Curb-65
(1.14 vs 0.48) and CT semiquantitative scores (5.0 vs 2.0) when compared with nonsevere patients. Among all univariable parameters, APACHE II, SOFA, lymphocytes,
CRP, LDH, AST, cTnI, BNP, et al were significantly independent risk factors of
COVID-19 severity. Among which, LDH was most positively related both with
APACHE II (R = 0.682) and SOFA (R = 0.790) scores, as well as PSI (R = 0.465) and
CT (R = 0.837) scores. To assess the diagnostic value of these selected parameters,
LDH (0.9727) had maximum sensitivity (100.00%) and specificity (86.67%), with the
cutoff value of 283. As a protective factor, lymphocyte counts less than 1.045 x 109 /L
showed a good accuracy for identification of severe patients with AUC = 0.9845
(95%CI 0.959-1.01), the maximum specificity (91.30%) and sensitivity (95.24%). In
addition, LDH was positively correlated with CRP, AST, BNP and cTnI, while
negatively correlated with lymphocyte cells and its subsets, including CD3+, CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells (P < 0.01).

Introduction
First reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, on December 2019, outbreak of a viral
pneumonia has attracted extensive attention of international community (1). The
pathogen, a novel β-coronavirus, has currently been named severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy
of Viruses(2). The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently declared
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a public health emergency of global concern(3).
As of February 29, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases have been documented,
with more than 10,000 severe cases, and a mortality rate of 4-15%(2, 4).
Among recent studies, the presence of any coexisting illness was more common among
patients with severe disease(2). Most of the patients had elevated levels of C-reactive
protein, and lymphocytopenia was common, especially in severe cases(1, 2, 5), which
was thought to be a result of reduction of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells(6). Meanwhile,
prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was found
in more than 40% cases during the whole disease period(5, 7), with elevated ALT and
AST less common in COVID-19 patients(2).
Given the rapid spread of COVID-19, we considered that an updated analysis of risk
factors may help early recognition of the severity of the disease. In this study, we
analyzed the clinical and laboratory parameters of severe and non-severe COVID-19
patients in order to evaluate disease severity.

Results
1.Demographics and characteristics of COVID-19 patients
Diagnosis of COVID-19 was made according to World Health Organization interim
guidance(8). A total of 47 diagnosed cases were enrolled in this study, with 24 severe
cases and 23 non-severe cases (Table 1). The median age was 64.91 years (IQR, 31-87
years), 26 cases (55.31%) were male of which 70.83% were severe cases (P < 0.05). A
total of 32 (68.09%) patients had underlying conditions, including hypertension (18
[38.3%]), diabetes (7 [14.89%]), coronary heart disease (5 [10.64%]), and autoimmune
disease (2 [4.26%]); 7 (14.89%) had a history of smoking, and 6 cases (12.76%) had a
BMI ≥ 25. Although no significant difference on the underlying conditions between the
two groups, the patients with coronary heart disease (4, [16.67%]) and autoimmune
disease (2, 8.33%) in severe group were more than the ones in non-severe patient group.
All patients enrolled had fever, with maximum temperatures of approximately 38.2ºC
of which 12 (25.53%) had fever with dyspnea. The average days between onset of
symptoms to admission ranged from 3-26 days (mean 12.51 days). Severe patients had
higher APACHE II (9.92 vs. 4.74, P < 0.001) and SOFA (3.0 vs. 1.0, P < 0.001) scores
on admission, as well as the higher PSI (86.13 vs. 61.39, P = 0.003), Curb-65 (1.14 vs.
0.48, P = 0.001) and CT semiquantitative scores (5.0 vs. 2.0, P < 0.001).

2. Laboratory indices of COVID-19 patients
Compared to the non-severe patients, neutrophil levels (P < 0.001), alanine
transaminase (ALT) (P = 0.001), aspartate transaminase (AST) (P < 0.001), LDH (P <
0.001), urea (P = 0.004), C-reactive protein (CRP) (P < 0.001), troponin I (cTnI) (P =
0.002), creatine kinase-MB (CKMB) (P = 0.002), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) (P
= 0.006), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (P = 0.004), D-dimer (P = 0.003)
in severe patients were significantly higher at admission. And lymphocyte (P < 0.001),
monocyte (P < 0.001), CD3+ (P < 0.001), CD4+ (P < 0.001) and CD8+ (P < 0.001) T
cells in severe patients were significantly lower (Table 2). No significant differences in
the serum levels of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgE, IgG and IgM) or complement C3 and
C4 were observed between the two groups (Table 2).

3.Independent risk factors of severe COVID-19 patients
To assess the risk factors of the demographic, characteristics and laboratory indicators
on the severity of COVID-19 patients, logistic regression analysis was performed on
the parameters of significant difference using t test. In univariable analysis, odds ratio
of SOFA score, Curb-65 score, serum CKMB concentration and serum IgA level were
the highest in severe patients. Male patients infected with SARS-cov-2 showed as an
independent risk factor for getting severer condition as 3.76 (1.12-12.73). Apart from
the risk factors above, APACHE II score, PSI score, white blood cell count, neutrophil
count, serum AST, ALT, LDH, Urea, CRP, BNP level, PT, APTT were all associated
with the severity of COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, we found that the lymphocyte
counts, monocyte counts, CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD16+CD56+ lymphocyte counts
were protective factors (OR < 1) for COVID-19 patients. Based on the condition we
mentioned, laboratory indictors CRP, AST and LDH (P < 0.001) were chosen as the
three variables for multivariable logistic regression model. As a result, serum LDH
level was ruled out as a risk factor for the severity of COVID-19 patients (OR:1.02, 95%
CI:1.01-1.03, P < 0.05) (Table 3).

4. The Predictive factors correlated with severity of COVID-19
We used clinical severity scores (APACHE II and SOFA) to assess the disease severity
in COVID-19 patients. The average APACHE II score was 9.9 in severe cases versus
4.7 in non-severe cases, with SOFA score of 3.0 versus 1.0 (Table 1, P < 0.001). For
the predivtive factors we have speculated, lymphocyte cell counts, hepatic function
indicator AST, infection indicator CRP and myocardial injury biomarkers cTnI, BNP
as well as LDH were performed Pearson correlation ananalysis with APACHE II score
and SOFA score. We found that serum LDH level showed tightly positive correlation
of the highest R value respevtively with APACHE II (R = 0.682, P < 0.001) and SOFA
score (R = 0.790, P < 0.001) in all the indicators (Figure1. F&L). Apart from
lymphocyte cells showed a negative correlation with APACHE II (R = -0.593, P <
0.001) and SOFA score (R = -0.614, P < 0.001), other indicators CRP, AST and BNP
were also positively associated with the scores. It's worth noting that, the serum cTnI

level showed a positive correlation with SOFA score (R = 0.345, P = 0.025) while it
showed no correlation with APACHE II score (R = 0.292, P = 0.06). (Figure 1).
5.The predictive factors correlated with the severity of lung damage
We used PSI and the Curb-65 score to assess the disease severity of pneumonia in
COVID-19 patients. The average PSI score was 86 in severe cases versus 61 in nonsevere cases (Table 1, P = 0.003), with Curb-65 scores of 1.13 versus 0.48 (Table 1, P
= 0.001). We also evaluated the extent of inflammation on chest CT using a
semiquantitative scoring system (Supplement Table 1); the median score was 5.0 in
severe cases while only 2.0 in non-severe cases (Table 1, P < 0.001). Six indicators
above were futher performed Pearson correlation ananalysis with PSI score and CT
score to determine the potential biomarkers for the lung injury. As a result, the serum
LDH level still showed the highest R value with CT score (R = 0.8372, P < 0.001) and
the second highest R value with PSI score (R = 0.465, P < 0.001) in all the indicators
(Figure2. F&L). Nevertheless, the serum cTnI level showed no correlation with PSI
score (R = 0.203, P = 0.198) nor CT score (R = 0.232, P = 0.167). What’s more, the
serum AST level showed no correlation with PSI score (R = 0.211, P = 0.165) and the
serum BNP level showed no correlation CT score (R = 0.301, P = 0.837). Lymphocyte
counts were neagtively associated with PSI score (R = -0.434, P = 0.003) and CT score
(R = -0.602, P < 0.001), while serum CRP showed positvie correlation with the two
scores. (Figure 2)

6. The predictive factors for identification of severe COVID-19 cases
To assess the diagnostic value of these selected parameters, receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve and area under ROC curve (AUC) were calculated using R
package “pROC”. As indicated in Figure3, the area under curve (AUC = 0.9727, 95%
CI: 0.932-1.013) implied a perfect accuracy of the serum LDH level more than 283 U/L
in COVID-19 patients as a predictive factor for identification of severe condition, with
the maximum sensitivity (100.00%) and specificity (86.67%). The serum AST level
over 29.5 U/L and CRP over 37.3 mg/L showed relative moderate accuracy with AUC
= 0.9231 and AUC = 0.9292. As a protective factor, the lymphocyte counts less than
1.045 x 109 /L showed a good accuracy for identification of severe patients with AUC

= 0.9845 (95%CI: 0.959-1.01), the maximum sensitivity (95.24%) and specificity
(91.30%). Furthermore, AUC of SOFA score is 0.9493 and CT score is 0.9528. The
other indicators were relatively poor accuracy factors in ROC curve analysis (Figure3.
Table 4).

7. Relationship between LDH and inflammation, cardiac and liver injury
biomarkers.
As the serum LDH level showed the highest Pearson Correlation Coefficient in the
correlation with APACHE II score, SOFA score, PSI score and CT score, the best
accuracy identification for predicting severe patients, we evaluated the relationship
between LDH and lymphocyte cells number (including subsets), serum CRP, AST,
BNP and cTnI level.

We found LDH was positively correlated with CRP, AST, BNP

and cTnI, while negatively correlated with lymphocyte cells and its subsets, including
CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (P < 0.01) (Figure 4).

Discussion
In this study, we analyzed the clinical features in 47 patients with COVID-19 who were
admitted to Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between February 1 and February
1, 2020. Although the clinical characteristics of patients enrolled were somewhat akin
to those reported in previous studies(1, 5, 7), there were no differences in age, BMI,
and proportion with underlying diseases between severe and non-severe patients, as
well as smoking history. In concert with recent studies(1, 5, 9), we found that the
clinical characteristics of COVID-19 mimic those of SARS-CoV. Fever and cough
were the dominant symptoms, and both groups had similar days from symptom onset,
similar maximum temperature, and number of patients who had dyspnea. APACHE II
and SOFA scores were calculated based on admission data. PSI, CURB-65, and
the semiquantitative score were used to assess the severity of lung damage.
Significantly higher scores were found in severe cases.

Among the risk factors we investigated in this study, we surprisingly discovered that
LDH had the most positive relationship between both PSI and CT score. In addition, it
was also most positively relevant to APACHE II and SOFA scores, which reflected a
strong correlation between LDH with lung damage as well as disease severity. LDH is
a major player in glucose metabolism which is present in tissues throughout the body
and catalyzes pyruvate to lactate. It is released from cells upon damage of their
cytoplasmic membrane(10). Previous studies also had noted the importance of LDH as
an indicator of lung diseases. In a study on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), researchers found
that EBV infected B cells had more LDH transcripts than the uninfected B cells(11). In
addition, the serum levels of LDH increased in PcP patients, probably was due to lung
injury(12, 13). Among patients who were infected during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1)
pandemic, 77.8% whose laboratory test showed LDH > 225U/L had lung involvement,
without difference between adult and children(14), which indicated that LDH elevation
was associated with various pathogen including virus, and was relevant to lung injury.
Furthermore, there was a case reported in 2017 that a patient with human Zika virus
infection had markedly elevated LDH, which was associated with 70% mortality in

further Zika infected animal study. They considered LDH as an indicator of multiorgan
injury, not only affecting liver or cardiac function(15).

LDH is found in all human cells, especially in myocardial and liver cells. In our study,
LDH elevation was positively associated with AST, cTnI and BNP, which verified it
as an isozyme of heart and liver. However, it was somewhat surprising that cTnI was
neither associated with PSI nor CT semiquantitative score, while was relevant with
disease severity. Similarly, BNP that had a strong correlation with APACHE II and
SOFA, was not associated with CT semiquantitative score, either. Furthermore, AST
which was associated with the APACHE II and SOFA score, was not related to PSI
score. This rather intriguing finding might be explained by the fact that the myocardial
and liver injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 might be due to the direct damage of the virus
to targeted organs, while not because of hypoxia induced by lung injury. Since the
outbreak of COVID-19, structural analysis of the virus has suggested that SARS-CoV2 might be able to bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in
humans(16, 17). The ACE2 receptor is abundantly present in the epithelia of lung and
small intestine(18), which might provide possible routes of entry for SARS-CoV-2.
This epithelial expression, together with its presence in vascular endothelium(18), also
provides a step in understanding the pathogenesis of ARDS, cardiac injury, liver injury
and even MODS.

Furthermore, LDH was found to be positively associated with CRP and negatively with
lymphocytes. An increase in CRP and decrease in lymphocytes were observed in severe
cases during the 14-day observation period, which was consistent with findings of
recent reports(1, 5, 6). In our study, the development of lymphopenia in severe patients
was mainly related to the significantly decreased absolute counts of T cells, especially
CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+T cells, but not to B cells or NK cells. The decrease of T cells
in severe cases reached its trough within three days, and then slightly increased from
the first week while still maintaining low levels and not recovering to the level of nonsevere patients over two weeks (data not shown).

LDH is not only a metabolic but also an immune surveillance prognostic biomarker, its
elevation is harbinger of negative outcome in immunosuppressive patients(19). LDH
increases production of lactate, leads to enhancement of immune-suppressive
cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), and inhibition of cytolytic cells,
such as natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs)(10). LDH is
often induced upon T cell activation and proliferation(20, 21). In a retrospective
analysis of a CTLs antigen-4 antibody which could enhance T-cell activity and
proliferation, the result showed that increase in LDH level was indicative of a poor
outcome(22), that confirmed the inhibition effect of LDH on CTLs. Furthermore, CD4+
T cells produce less IFN-γ in the absence of LDH, demonstrating a critical role for LDH
in promoting T cell responses(21).

It was also hypothesized that change in lactate modulated the inflammatory response in
macrophages(23). Suppression of LDH has anti-inflammatory effects due to the
downregulation of several inflammatory mediators including cytokines and NO(23).
Also, significant correlations were found between LDH and cytokines/chemokines,
therefore, LDH may be a useful biomarker to assist the clinician in the decision to
hospitalize a child with bronchiolitis(24). In our study, lymphocytes, especially CD3+,
CD4+, and CD8+ T cells were significantly decreased and relevant with LDH elevation.
The decrease in T cell counts was strongly correlated with the severity of disease, which
was in keeping with previous studies on SARS(25, 26). On the other hand, elevation of
LDH, the immune-related factor, could be considered as a predictive factor, that
reflected a poor prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients.

Our study had some limitations. This study was conducted at a single-center with
limited sample size. Furthermore, because many patients remained in hospital and
outcomes were unknown at the time of writing, we only collected clinical data within
two weeks for our analysis. COVID-19 has spread rapidly and has a wide spectrum of
severity. A larger cohort study of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia globally would
help to further define the clinical characteristics and risk factors of the disease.

Conclusion
In summary, this study showed that LDH coule be identified as a powerful predictive
factor for early recognition of lung injury and severe COVID-19 cases. And importantly,
lymphocyte counts, especially CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood
of COVID-19 patients,which was relevant with serum LDH, were also dynamically
correlated with the severity of the disease.

Methods
1.Data collection
Forty-seven confirmed COVID-19 patients at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University
between February 1 to February 18, 2020 were enrolled into this retrospective
observational study. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as a positive result
on real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasalpharyngeal swab specimens.
A trained team of physicians and medical students reviewed and collected demographic,
epidemiological, clinical, physical examination findings, and laboratory data from
electronic medical records. Laboratory assessments consisted of complete blood count,
liver and renal function, markers of cardiac injury, measures of electrolytes, C-reactive
protein and procalcitonin, and assessment of coagulation and lactate dehydrogenase,
among other parameters. We defined the degree of severity of COVID-19 patients
(severe vs. non-severe) at the time of admission, according to American Thoracic
Society (ATS) guidelines for CAP(27). If imaging scans were available, the radiologic
assessments of chest computed tomography (CT) were reviewed and scored by an
attending radiologist who extracted the data. The APACHE II and SOFA score were
calculated basen on clinical and experimental data on admission, and CT score was
calculated based on a semiquantitative scoring system (Supplement Table 1).
Patients were followed up for 14 days after admission. Patient information was
confidentially protected by assigning a deidentified ID to each patient. The study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University.

2.Statistical Analysis
A sample size of at least 17 patients per group is needed to achieve 91% power to detect
a difference of 0.3 between the area under the ROC curve (AUC) under the null
hypothesis of 0.5 and an AUC under the alternative hypothesis of 0.8 using a two-sided
test at a significance level of 0.05 (PASS 15, NCSS, LCC).
Because the patients enrolled in our study were not randomly assigned, all statistical
findings should be interpreted as descriptive only. Quantized variables were presented
as means ± standard deviation, and significance was tested by t-test. Nonparametric

variables were expressed as medians and interquartile ranges or simple ranges as
appropriate, and we used the Mann Whitney U or Kruskal Wallis tests to compare
differences. Continuous and categorical variables were summarized as counts and
percentages, and significance was detected by chi square or Fisher’s exact test. To
explore the risk factors associated with severity of COVID-19, univariable and
multivariate logistic regression models were used. Correlation analysis was performed
by using Pearson Correlation Coefficient. The sensitivity and specificity of the risk
factors for the patient diagnosis were represented and analyzed by receiver operating
characteristic curve (ROC curve). All the analyses and figures were performed with
SPSS software (Version 26) and Graphpad Prism (Version 7.0). P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant in all analyses.
