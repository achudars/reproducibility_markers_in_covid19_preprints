OBJECTIVE

32

To investigate the association of diabetes and blood glucose on mortality of patients with

33

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

34

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

35

This was a retrospective observational study of all patients with COVID-19 admitted to

36

Huo-Shen-Shan Hospital, Wuhan, China. The hospital was built only for treating COVID-19 and

37

opened on February 5, 2020. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality during

38

hospitalization.

39

RESULTS

40

Among 2877 hospitalized patients, 13.5% (387/2877) had a history of diabetes and 1.9%

41

(56/2877) died in hospital. After adjustment for confounders, patients with diabetes had a 2-fold

42

increase in the hazard of mortality as compared to patients without diabetes (adjusted HR 2.11,

43

95%CI: 1.16-3.83, P=0.014). The on-admission glucose (per mmol/L≥4mmol/L) was significantly

44

associated with subsequent mortality on COVID-19 (adjusted HR 1.17, 95%CI: 1.10-1.24,

45

P<0.001).

46

CONCLUSIONS

47

Diabetes and on-admission glucose (per mmol/L≥4mmol/L) are associated with increased

48

mortality in patients with COVID-19. These data support that blood glucose should be properly

49

controlled for possibly better survival outcome in patients with COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

53

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a current pandemic disease caused by the

54

positive-sense RNA virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

55

(SARS-CoV-2). The mortality rates were reported to range from 1% to more than 5% 1. Diabetes

56

has been suggested as one of the most common comorbidities and associated with higher

57

mortality. Earlier reports with limited sample sizes, reported that diabetes had a hazard ratio of

58

2-3 for mortality2,3. Later on, summarized by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and

59

Prevention, among 72,314 patients with COVID-19 in China, those with diabetes had a mortality

60

of 7.3%compared with that of 2.3% in the general infected population1. However, none of these

61

previous studies have adjusted for confounding factors, such as age, hypertension, or

62

cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, which have been previously identified as predictors of

63

COVID-19 related death2,4.

64

On-admission glucose level has been identified to be associated with in-hospital adverse events

65

in patients with pneumonia 5-7. Compared with common pneumonia, the outbreak and pandemic

66

of COVID-19 could have much more impact the glucose level in diabetes. As to the patients,

67

anxiety and panic could lead to stress hyperglycemia, and as to the doctor, high workload could

68

result in the inadequate glucose management, and finally as to the SARS-CoV-2, it could impact

69

the glucose metabolism directedly. However, whether the dysglycemia from COVID-19 and the

70

corresponding anti-diabetic treatments have an impact on the mortality in patients with

71

COVID-19 have not been investigated.

72

Here, we investigated in 2877 patients, consecutively admitted to Huo Shen Shan Hospital,

73

dedicated solely to the treatment of COVID-19, in Wuhan, China. We investigated the

74

association of diabetes, admission glucose and anti-diabetic medications with COVID-19

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

78

Study Participants

79

This was a retrospective observational study comparing association of both diabetic status and

80

antidiabetic treatment with mortality among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. All patients

81

admitted to Huo Shen Shan Hospital, Wuhan, China, from February 5, 2020, to March 15, 2020,

82

with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. Huo Shen Shan Hospital was

83

specially built with a capacity of one-thousand beds and opened by the government on February

84

5th, 2020, dedicated to treating exclusively COVID-19 patients. Patients with COVID-19

85

included in this study were diagnosed according to World Health Organization interim guidance

86

8

87

This study was approved by the National Health Commission of China and the Institutional

88

Review Board at Huo Shen Shan Hospital (Wuhan, China) (HSSLL025). Written informed

89

consent was waived by the Ethics Committee of the Huo Shen Shan Hospital for patients with

90

emerging infectious diseases.

92

Patients’ demographic characteristics and clinical data (symptoms, comorbidities, laboratory

93

findings, and outcomes) during hospitalization were collected from electronic medical records by

94

two investigators (R.Z. and Y.C). All data were independently reviewed and entered into the

95

computer database by two analysts (C.G. and Y.C.).

96

The laboratory diagnoses of COVID-19 were confirmed by the Viral Nucleic Acid Kit 8

97

according to the kit instructions. A 2019-nCoV detection kit (Bioperfectus) was used to detect

98

the ORF1ab gene (nCovORF1ab) and the N gene (nCoV-NP) according to the manufacturer’s

99

instructions, using real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction 9. An infection was

00

considered laboratory-confirmed if both the nCovORF1ab and nCoV-NP tests showed positive

01

results.

02

Clinical Endpoints

03

The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality during hospitalization. Secondary endpoints

04

included the use of invasive mechanical ventilation, and the severity of the COVID-19. The

05

severity of COVID-19 was categorized as mild, severe, or critically ill. Mild included

06

non-pneumonia and mild pneumonia cases. Severe was characterized by dyspnea, respiratory

07

frequency ≥30/min, blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300, and/or lung

08

infiltrates >50% within 24-48 hours. Critically ill cases were defined as respiratory failure

09

requiring mechanic ventilation, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction/failure 1,10. The

10

close date of the follow-up was April 1, 2020.

11

Patients with medical history of diabetes were defined by the diagnosis given by their doctors

12

prior to the infection of SARS-CoV-2. A medical history of hypertension or blood

13

pressure≥140/90mHg on admission were defined as any hypertension . The antidiabetic regimens

14

were in principle unchanged during hospitalization whatever the patients had previous

15

prescriptions before admission. Discontinuation or alteration of the antidiabetic treatment during

16

hospitalization due to the clinical presentation of COVID-19 was at their physician’s discretion.

17

Statistical Analysis

18

Continuous variables with normal distribution were expressed as mean (standard deviation) and

19

compared using independent student’s t-test, and those with skewed distribution were expressed

20

as median (interquartile range) and compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables

21

were presented as frequencies and percentages and compared using Fisher’s exact test. Survival

22

time was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox's proportional hazard model was used

23

to assess effects of diabetic status and covariates on mortality during hospitalization. Binary

24

logistical regression analysis was used to assess the association between diabetic status and

25

covariates and secondary endpoints, and the results were presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95%

26

confidence intervals (CIs). Only those variables that affected the hazard ratios (HRs) or ORs of

27

endpoints with a P value <0.05 were included in the multivariate analysis. We excluded variables

28

from the univariable analysis if the number of events was too small to calculate ORs or HRs.

29

Restricted cubic splines were used to explore the relationship between blood glucose and hazard

30

of death. As the relationship of predicted blood glucose was approximately linear above and

31

below their cutoff, a linear spline model with a node at cutoff was fitted to calculate hazard ratios

32

(HR) per mmol/L increase in blood glucose. Analyses were performed using SPSS version 25.0

36

RESULTS

37

In total, 2877 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were consecutively

38

enrolled in the study. Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1. Among these patients,

39

56/2877(1.9%) died in hospital and 387/2877(13.5%) had history of diabetes. Compared with

40

patients with non-death, patients with death were older and more likely to be male, had higher

41

prevalence of comorbidities such any hypertension on admission, diabetes, myocardial angina,

42

previous PCI/CABG, and more often to have medications for diabetes and hypertension.

43

Compared with patients with non-death, patients with death had higher respiratory rate and more

44

likely presented with cough and shortness of breath. As shown in Figure 1and Table 2, there are

45

17/387 (4.4%) died in the diabetic patients and 39/2490 (1.6%) died in non-diabetic patients

46

(P<0.001). After adjusted for confounders, diabetic patients were still associated with a 2-fold

47

increase in the hazard of death as compared to non-diabetic patients (adjusted HR 2.11, 95%CI:

48

1.16-3.83, P=0.014). The baseline characteristics of patients with or without secondary endpoints

49

(the severity of COVID-19 and use of invasive mechanical ventilation) were presented in

50

supplemental Table 1. As compared with patients with mild COVID-19, the patients with

51

severe/critical COVID-19 had higher prevalence of diabetes (144/744, 19.4% vs 243/2133,11.4%,

52

P<0.001). After adjusted for confounders, diabetes was still associated with an increase in the

53

odds of developing a severe/critical COVID-19 as compared to non-diabetic patients (adjusted

54

OR1.48, 95%CI: 1.17-1.87, P=0.001) (supplemental Table 2).As compared with patients without

55

receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, the patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation

56

had higher prevalence of diabetes (17/65, 26.2% vs 370/2812, 13.2% P=0.002)(supplemental

57

Table1). After adjusted for confounders, diabetes was not associated with an increase in the odds

58

of receiving invasive mechanical ventilation as compared to non-diabetic patients (supplemental

59

table 3).

60

Restricted cubic splines were used to explore the possible relationship between blood glucose

61

and mortality. As shown in figure 2, U-shaped association between blood glucose and mortality

62

was observed in the overall population cohort, and the lowest value, as a reference point for

63

glucose to predict mortality was 4mmol/L. As shown in table 3, when glucose was more than

64

4mmol/L, it was significantly associated with subsequent mortality on COVID-19 (adjusted HR

65

1.17, 95%CI: 1.10-1.24, P=0.002).

66

Among the 387 patients with diabetes, there were 102/387 (26.4%) diabetic patients treated with

67

insulin, 140/387 (36.2%) with acarbose and 142/387 (36.7%) with metformin. No statistically

68

significant differences were found in the mortality between the Insulin and non-insulin treated

69

patients (8/102, 7.8% vs 9/285, 3.2% P=0.089), metformin and non-metformin treated patients

70

(5/142, 3.5% vs 12/245 ,4.9% P=0.524), and acarbose and non-acarbose treated patients (6/140,

71

4.3% vs 11/247 ,4.5% P=0.938).

74

In the presented analysis, we investigated the association of the diabetes and blood glucose on

75

mortality in patients with COVID-19. The salient findings from the present study are

76

summarized as follows:

77

1) After adjustment for the confounders, compared with non-diabetic patients, the diabetic

78

patients were still associated with a 2-fold increase in mortality.

79

2) The on-admission blood glucose (per mmol/L≥4mmol/L) was significantly associated with

80

subsequent mortality on COVID-19.

81

Previous reports have suggested that diabetes is one of the most common comorbidities of the

82

COVID-19 patients and might have influenced the prognosis11-13. The estimated incidence of

83

diabetes in the COVID-19 patients ranged from 9.7% to 20%11-13. COVID-19 patients with

84

diabetes may have poor prognosis, evidenced by the fact that the incidence of diabetes

85

was two-fold higher in ICU/severe cases than in their non-ICU/severe counterparts13. Although

86

the evidence is still limited, studies have suggested that diabetes had a hazard ratio of 2-3 for

87

mortality11-13. However, none of these previous studies have adjusted for confounding factors,

88

such as age, hypertension, or cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, which have been previously

89

identified as predictors of COVID-19 related death. Recently, a study including 191 COVID-19

90

found that patients with diabetes has a hazard ratio of 2.85 for death2. However, after adjusting

91

for potential confounding factors, the corresponding risk disappeared. The small sample size

92

maybe the main reason for the neutral results. In the present study, with a large-scale cohort of

93

2877 patients with COVID-19, we demonstrated that diabetes was associated with a high risk of

94

mortality during hospitalization after adjusting for the underlying confounders. To our

95

knowledge, this is the first study to report diabetes as an independent risk factor for mortality in

96

patients with COVID-19.

97

We found that the proportion of on-admission glucose (fasting glucose) above 7mmol/L, as one

98

of a criteria to diagnose diabetes, was 13.5% 14. Although possibility that inadequate

99

anti-medications were prescribed to the diabetic patients or that undiagnosed diabetes were

00

present, we still speculated that the dysglycemia was frequent in patient with COVID-19 given

01

the large proportion of patients with abnormal glucose value.

02

Large body of literature has found that dysglycemia including hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia and

03

the increased glucose variability is independently associated with mortality in critically ill

04

patients15,16.Furthermore, there were evidences showing that the blood glucose level on

05

admission is also independently associated with adverse outcomes in patients with community

06

acquired pneumonia (CAP). Earlier, admission glucose level >14 mmol/l was identified as one of

07

the 20 factors associated with poor outcomes in CAP6. Later on, a prospective cohort study

08

conducted by Finlay A et al. found that, even after adjustment for confounding factors, a lower

09

glucose level >11 mmol/l was also remained significantly associated with subsequent adverse

10

outcomes in patients with CAP5. In 2009, when the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus spread

11

worldwide, wang et al. demonstrated that the fasting blood glucose was an independent predictor

12

for severity of H1N1 pneumonia7. It has been inferred that the reasons for the hyperglycemia in

13

H1N1-mediated pneumonia are as follows: 1. By a direct pathway, H1N1 virus could potentially

14

damage pancreatic β-cells evidenced by downregulated homa-β in the H1N1 infected patients7; 2.

15

By an indirect pathway, H1N1-mediated elevations of FPG might be the result of multiple

16

factors' combinations caused by virus infection, such as inflammatory stress, multiple organ

17

impairment, and so on, while the changes of plasma glucose were not caused by H1N1 actions

18

on insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells or decreasing sensitivity to insulin7.

19

Although there is no direct evidence that pancreatic β-cells is also a target for SARS-CoV-2, the

20

dysglycemia is not uncommon in patients with COVID-19. However, whether the dysglycemia is

21

a predictor for clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 remains unknown. In the present

22

analysis, we used restricted cubic splines and Cox regression to investigate the predictive role of

23

dysglycemia for clinical outcomes. We found that after adjusted for the cofounders, the

24

admission blood glucose (per mmol/L≥4mmol/L) was significantly associated with subsequent

25

mortality on COVID-19. For each 1-mmol/l increase in admission glucose, risk of in-hospital

26

mortality increases 17% in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, a more active intervention

27

should be taken to control the blood glucose. Additionally, the hyperglycemia on admission

28

maybe a strong stratification factor to differentiate high risk patients with COVID-19.

29

According to our present data, the glucose control should be emphasized. Unfortunately, few

30

studies have been conducted to investigate the impact of anti-diabetic medications on the

31

mortality of COVID-19. So far, no specific anti-viral treatment exists, hence, a range of existing

32

host-directed therapies that have proven to be safe could potentially be repurposed to treat

33

2019-nCoV infection17. Several marketed drugs with safety profiles such as metformin,

34

glitazones could reduce immunopathology, boost immune responses, and prevent or curb

35

ARDS18. In the present study, we retrospectively investigate the effect of anti-diabetic

36

medications including metformin regarded as a medication for host-directed therapies on the

12

37

mortality in patients with COVID-19. No significant difference was observed as to the mortality

38

and other clinical endpoints in the COVID-19 patients with or without the above medications.

39

However, the analysis is underpowered, which might lead to the neutral results. Future dedicated

40

study with adequate sample size is needed to further investigate such issue.

41

Limitations

42

First, since our results were based only on admission glucose, it was likely that we had

43

underestimated the risks associated with hyperglycemia given that the patients with the highest

44

levels of glucose would have been more likely to be treated in the hospital setting.

45

Second, we did not routinely collect measures of long-term glucose control, such as HbA1c,

46

which would have allowed us to distinguish long-term poorly controlled diabetic patients from

47

those with hyperglycemia as a measure of significant physiological stress.

48

Third, even though we analyzed one of the largest cohorts of hospitalized patients with

49

COVID-19 up to date, we had insufficient numbers to examine the role of various anti-glycemic

50

treatments (e.g., insulin, metformin) on outcomes. Our findings should be interpreted cautiously.

51

Larger scale and dedicated cohort study or RCT were needed to verify our conclusions.

52
53

CONCLUSIONS

54

In conclusion, diabetes was independently associated with increased mortality, and on-admission

55

blood glucose (per mmol/L≥4mmol/L) was also an independent factor for mortality in patients

56

with COVID-19. The mortality was not affected by the anti-diabetic medications. These data

57

support that, regardless of anti-diabetic medications administrated, proper blood glucose control
