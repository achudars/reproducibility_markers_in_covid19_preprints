Abstract

31

Background: The number of infection and death by COVID-19 has been rapidly increasing

32

since December 2019 in all over the world. Until now, there is no specific treatment or vaccine

33

for this disease; WHO suggests only some protective measures like maintaining social distance,

34

staying home, washing hands with soap or sanitizer, wearing mask etc. The objective of this

35

study was to survey knowledge, attitude, practice and perception regarding COVID-19 among

36

students in Rajshahi University, Bangladesh.

37

Methods:

38

sectional study using mixed sampling from March 11 to March 19, 2020. Frequency distribution,

39

Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used in this study.

40

Results:

41

respectively. The study revealed that Rajshahi university students had average knowledge on

42

symptoms, protective way and transmission of COVID-19. Female students were more

43

knowledgeable than male. More than one third of the students had negative attitude to avoiding

44

public transport and going out to public places with friends and family. The practice of students

45

practice during our data collection period and in future was not satisfactory. More than one third

46

of students were not keen to stay at home and avoid going to crowded places. The perception

47

towards COVID-19 was not good; they had no idea whether the outbreak would affect their daily

48

routine, study and financial matters, study field work and restrict leisure time of meeting family

49

and relatives.

We collected data from 305 students of Rajshahi University for this cross-

Out of 305 participants, 224 (73.4%) and 81 (26.6%) were male and female students

Conclusions:

51

university students regarding COVID-19 were not satisfactory. This indicated that the situation

52

was worse among common people. In Bangladesh, the number of healthcare providers is

53

insufficient. University students can be employed as potential workforce to create awareness

54

among mass people on prevention of COVID-19.

Introduction

59

Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has appeared as one of the most severe pandemic

60

and fatal disease in human history. It has already affected millions of people, thousands of whom

61

are dying every day creating panic and a global deadlock in all spheres of life. The health

62

authorities in Wuhan City of China found 27 pneumonia cases of unknown etiology on 31

63

December, 2019, and Wuhan's Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was detected as the source of

64

the infection [1] that turned into an outbreak. On January 9, 2020, the China Government

65

reported that the causative agent of the outbreak was ‘severe acute respiratory syndrome

66

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)’. The World Health Organization (WHO) named the virus ‘2019

67

novel coronavirus’ (2019NCV) and termed the disease ‘COVID-19’ [2]. Later, WHO declared

68

the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [3]. The Chinese Center for

69

Disease Control and Prevention reported that the fatality rate of diagnosed cases was 2.3%, with

70

an increasing risk in the subjects aged 60 and older (3.6% in subjects 60-69 years old; 8% in

71

subjects 70-79 years old; and 14.8% in subjects aged 80 and older), and those with comorbidities

72

(case fatality rate in healthy subjects was 0.9%) [4]. According to the Corona Virus Resource

73

Centre of John Hopkins University and Medicine, 1,498,833 people were confirmed to contract

74

the 2019NCV by April 9, 2020 in 184 countries and out of them, 89,435 people died [5]. The

75

scenario is changing every day with increase in number of infection and death.

76

Evidences show that mammals and birds are the reservoirs of 2019NCV [6-7]. In Wuhan, the

77

virus attacked only those people who visited the wet animal market and their contacts [8-9]

78

indicating that person-to-person transmission is the likely route for spread of 2019NCV. The

79

virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose of an infected

person when she/he coughs or sneezes [10]. WHO reports that the best way to prevent and slow

81

down the transmission of 2019NCV is to be well informed about it, the disease it causes, and

82

mode of its transmission, and suggests people to wash hands with soap or use hand sanitizers

83

frequently, avoid touching the face, mouth, nose and eyes with unwashed or non-sanitized hands,

84

maintaining social distance, and staying home to remain protected from the infection [10].

85

Individuals should also practice respiratory etiquette such as coughing and sneezing into a flexed

86

elbow, cover mouth and nose with handkerchief or tissue paper and wearing masks to avoid

87

spreading of the virus [10]. Touching surfaces contaminated with the virus is also a way of

88

spread of 2019NCV that may survive on surfaces for several hours and days [11]. Till now, there

89

is no specific vaccine or medicinal treatment for COVID-19 [10]. The disease is manifested by

90

fever, sore throat and mild to moderate respiratory problems and most cases are cured without

91

any special treatment [10]. It may get severe and life-threatening in people of older age and with

92

comorbidities like cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease,

93

and cancer [10]. Though the outbreak of COVID-19 is a very recent occurrence, many studies

94

have already been done on it. But, to the best of our knowledge, no study has yet been conducted

95

on it with Bangladeshi population. In Bangladesh, COVID-19 situation is aggravating day by

96

day. As of April 9, 2020, a total of 218 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were detected and 20 of

97

them died [12]. This might be an underestimate, as the facilities of 2019NCV test are very

98

limited here. Bangladesh is an over-populated country with a population density of 976/sq.km.

99

[13], where most of its people do not maintain proper personal hygiene. The situation may turn

100

very serious here. The government and the concerned non-government authorities have taken

101

many measures, though too late and insufficient, to contain the outbreak. Educational

102

institutions, offices and markets have been closed, and the whole country has been put under

lock-down for more than two weeks. The government, non-government, social and professional

104

organizations as well as the print and electronic media of the country is conducting massive

105

publicity on mode of transmission of the virus, and sign-symptoms and measures of prevention,

106

control and treatment of COVID-19. However, there are media observations that a considerable

107

number of people are not following the suggestions properly. It is evidenced from previous

108

pandemics that lack of proper knowledge about the disease is associated with negative emotion

109

among people which can further complicate the attempts of preventing the spread of the disease

110

[14]. Taking the perspective into our consideration, we aimed to assess knowledge, attitude,

111

practice and perception regarding COVID-19 among the students of Rajshahi University who are

112

assets of the nation, and thought to be more knowledgeable and conscious about contemporary

113

happenings in home and abroad.

115

Materials

116

This cross-sectional study was conducted from March 11 to March 19, 2020. Rajshahi University

117

was considered as the target area, and all its students were selected as population for the study.

118

Rajshahi University is the second largest university of Bangladesh with an approximate number

119

of 38,300 students who come here from all over the country for higher education. Our study

120

population comprised of non-medical students.

121

Methods

122

Questionnaire: We developed a questionnaire following the instructions and guidelines of

123

WHO that had five parts: (i) general information of students, (ii) knowledge on COVID-19; it

124

was subdivided into three portions: (a) knowledge on signs and symptoms of COVID-19, (b)

125

knowledge on the protective ways to prevent COVID-19, (c) knowledge on COVID

126

transmission, (iii) perception about COVID-19; it was subdivided into two portions: (a)

127

perception towards COVID-19, and (b) perception about the impact of COVID-19, (iv) attitude

128

towards COVID-19, and (v) practice regarding COVID-19. The draft questionnaire was sent to

129

some experts and finally it was revised following the experts’ opinions and suggestions. We

130

could not conduct pilot study for post-testing of this questionnaire for shortage of time.

131

Sample size determination: The population size was known (34,300). In such case, the

132

following formula would be appropriate to calculate the required sample for this study:

133

n=

134

have considered d= 0.05) [15]. The formula provided that 396 samples would be sufficient for

135

this study.

136

Sampling and data collection: Mixed sampling was utilized in this study for selecting our

137

required samples. In the first step, we selected three departments from 58 departments using

138

random sampling (by lottery); the departments were: (i) Statistics, (ii) Mathematics and (iii)

139

Physics. In the second step, one academic year was selected randomly from each selected

140

department; these were: (i) second year from Statistics, (ii) first year from Mathematics, and (iii)

141

first year from Physics. In the third step, cluster sampling was used for collecting information

142

from the students of the selected years of the selected departments. Students were taken to a

143

particular class room and briefed about the objectives of the study. Written consents of the

144

agreed students were taken. They were abandoned from using their cell phones, laptops and

145

internet. They filled up the questionnaire in presence of the researchers without discussion with

146

their friends. A total number of 305 students were interviewed using this procedure. We could

147

interview no more students as the university was closed for COVID-19 outbreak in the country.

148

We decided to complete the study with data from 305 students.

149

Ethics statement: Prior to collecting data, we took ethical clearance from the Ethical

150

Committee, Institute of Biological Sciences (IBSc), Rajshahi University, Bangladesh to study on

151

communicable diseases.

152

Statistical analysis: All collected data were entered into SPSS (IBM, version 21) for

153

analysis. Level of students’ knowledge on COVID-19, and percentage of their perception,

154

attitude and practice based on the selected questions were determined by frequency distribution.

155

The normality of the data was checked by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The histogram, the test and

156

graph demonstrated that our data were not normally distributed. We used Mann-Whitney and

157

Kruskal-Wallis (nonparametric) tests to find the significance of difference in number of correct

158

answers between two and more than two groups respectively. Statistical significance was

159

accepted at p < 0.05.

160
161

Results

162

Of 305 samples, 73.4% were male and 26.6% were female students. Their age ranged from 17 to

163

28 years with mean and median ages of 20.66±1.78 and 20 years respectively. More than half of

164

the students (51.1%) came from rural area. Near about 50% fathers and 25.6% mothers of the

165

students were highly educated. 76.1% students came from nuclear family (Table 3).

166

91.8% students answered that fever was a symptom of COVID-19 followed by dry cough

167

(81.3%), difficulty in breathing (78.4%), a general feeling of unwell (77.7%), short of breath

168

(70.8%), headache (55.1%), running nose (54.8%), sore throat (49.8%) and diarrhea (16.4%).

169

More than 43% reported that chest pain was also a symptom of COVID-19 (Table 2). 97.7%

170

students believed that hand washing with soaps and water could prevent COVID-19 followed by

171

avoidance of touching nose, mouth and eyes with unwashed hands, covering mouth and nose

172

with tissue or handkerchief during coughing or sneezing, wearing clean surgical mask when

173

attacked of respiratory illness (coughing, sneezing and flu), avoiding contact with people having

174

respiratory illness symptoms such as coughing, sneezing and flu, cleaning and disinfecting

175

objects and surface, and always eating fully cooked eggs and meat. Some students had wrong

176

concepts also. 39.7% students believed that eating rice and vegetables could give protection from

177

COVID-19, and another 16.1% students felt no need of maintaining distance from infected

178

persons for protection from COVID-19 (Table 1). 97% students answered that COVID-19 could

179

spread from person to person through coughing or sneezing, from animal to human, through

180

objects contaminated with the virus, and eating not properly handled and cooked wild animal

181

meat and food. More than 84% students had wrong concept that COVID-19 could transmit

182

through touching persons with flu. 52.5% and 10.8% students believed that COVID-19 could

183

spread through water and food, and mosquito bite respectively (Table 1).

The average level of positive attitude and good practice among students were 6.40±2.32 and

231

3.52±1.20 respectively. Mann-Whitney test demonstrates that female students (3.86±1.16) were

232

significantly more practicing to avoid COVID-19 than male students (3.39±1.19) (p<0.01), and

233

students coming from rural environment (6.70±2.12) showed more positive attitude than their

234

counterparts (6.09±2.49) (p<0.05). Students living in nuclear family (3.62±1.16) had more

235

practice to avoid COVID-19 than students coming from joint family (3.21±1.28) (p<0.05). We

236

did not find the significance of difference in attitude and practice between other groups (Table

Discussion

271

The outbreak of COVID-19 in China attracted attention of the whole world including

272

Bangladesh since its early stage. Hundreds of students, businessmen and tourists started to return

273

home from China creating a hue and cry in the country. Soon Bangladeshi people from many

274

other countries started to rush to the homeland. Mismanagement of health check-up, COVID-19

275

test and 14 days quarantine of these home-coming people created a huge debate and became a

276

hot cake for print, electronic and social media. Being comparatively more knowledgeable part of

277

the population, the university students are supposed to have higher level of knowledge, attitude,

278

practice and perception regarding the disease. For that purpose, data were collected from 305

279

students of Rajshahi University. It is reported that adequate knowledge, and positive attitude and

280

perception are related to proper practice [16]. Four types of issues related to COVID-19 were

281

discussed in this study.

282

Knowledge on COVID-19

283

Signs and symptoms: This study revealed that only 3.9% and 10.5% students knew correct

284

answers of all nine and eight questions respectively. This indicates that the students did not have

285

good knowledge about the signs and symptoms of COVID-19. The knowledge level of our

286

students was far below than that of Chinese people [2] and Indian healthcare professionals,

287

students and non-medical healthcare staffs [17].

288

Protective way to avoid COVID-19: About 40% students thought eating rice and

289

vegetables could prevent COVID-19. Half of the students answered all seven questions correctly.

290

We may consider that the students had good knowledge on the protective ways of avoiding

291

COVID-19 though the level of knowledge was lower than that among Indian healthcare

292

professionals, students and non-medical healthcare staffs [17].

293

Knowledge of COVID-19 transmission: More than half of the students deemed that

294

COVID-19 could transmit via water and food, and 10.8% students believed that mosquito was a

295

vector of COVID-19. Only 35.1% students answered all the 6 questions correctly. It reveals that

296

the students had fair or moderate knowledge on COVID-19 transmission. However, it was lower

297

than the knowledge level of healthcare professionals and students but higher than that among

298

non-medical healthcare staffs of India [17]. We found that female students were more

299

knowledgeable than males regarding transmission of COVID-19. Usually females take

300

everything more seriously than males, and they have more curiosity to know anything than

301

males. This might be a reason of difference of the knowledge between male and female students.

302

Same result was observed in Chinese and Indian studies [16, 17].

303

Attitude

304

WHO suggests people to avoid public gatherings, maintain social distancing and stay home for

305

prevention of COVID-19. This study demonstrates that more than 40% had negative attitude

306

towards the measures. The facts reveal that the students of Rajshahi University did not have good

307

attitude towards COVID-19. Attitude towards COVID-19 among the Chinese people and Indian

308

healthcare professionals, students and non-medical healthcare staffs was very positive [2, 17].

309

The students coming from rural area showed more positive attitude than urban students. It could

310

not be compared as no similar study is available.

311

Practice

312

About 40% students were not using surgical face masks in public places. Scarcity and higher

313

price of masks might be a reason behind it. More than one-third of students were not interested in

314

staying home and avoiding crowds. In China, almost all people used face masks and avoided

315

public places to prevent COVID-19 transmission [2]. Level of practice of preventive guides was

316

also high among Indians [17]. Usually, practice of personal hygiene is comparatively poor in

317

Bangladesh, such as, only 40% people wash hands with soap and water and only 35% schools

318

have facilities of washing hands with soap and water [17]. This might contribute to poor practice

319

regarding prevention of COVID-19 among our respondents. The female students coming from

320

nuclear family were more practicing to avoid COVID-19 than males and joint family’s students.

321

A Chinese study supports the finding [16].

322

Perception

323

Perception towards COVID-19: A considerable number of students thought that they

324

were not exposed to COVID-19. Only a smaller part of them were moderately worried of its

325

infection and consequences, and slightly fearful of it. On the basis of answers of the four

326

questions of this section, we can conclude that the student’s perception towards COVID-19 was

327

not good. No previous study on this issue is available till now to compare our finding. Religious

328

and cultural faiths and views might play role in this regard.

329

Perception about the impact of COVID-19: This study shows that only a smaller

330

portion of students felt COVID-19 outbreak affected their daily routine, study, financial matters,

331

family’s daily routine, study field works, and leisure time. The respondents’ perception regarding

332

impact of COVID-19 was poor. To the best of our knowledge, there is no relevant study either in

333

home or abroad regarding the perception about the impact or consequences of COVID-19. We

334

think, during our data collection period, students had no idea how COVID-19 could affect their

335

life.

336

Limitation of this study: Perhaps, this is the first attempt of survey on knowledge, attitude,

337

practice and perception towards COVID-19 among university students in Bangladesh. This study

338

searched out some alarming facts. However, we had many limitations too. The sample size was

339

small. This cross-sectional study could not look into any change in students’ knowledge, attitude,

340

practice and perception on COVID-19 in course of time. By this time, some new information

341

was got, and new misconceptions and misinformation were publicized, but we could not consider

342

these issues. There are many universities in Bangladesh, but we considered only Rajshahi

University students as our sample due to limitation of time and budget. The limitations reveal

344

that more in-depth studies are needed.

345

Conclusions

346

In this study, we examined the students’ knowledge on signs and symptoms, preventive measure

347

and mode of transmission of COVID-19. We found that the general knowledge of the students on

348

our selected issues was not satisfactory. A remarkable number of students had negative attitude

349

towards COVID-19. During the data collection time, students’ practices of avoiding COVID-19

350

were found unsatisfactory. Also, students’ perception about COVID-19 was not good. We may

351

suggest the health authorities of Bangladesh to take necessary steps for improving university

352

students’ knowledge, attitude, practice and perception towards COVID-19. In our country where

353

the number of doctors and other healthcare providers are not sufficient, knowledgeable

354

university students can be employed to create awareness on COVID-19 among mass people.
