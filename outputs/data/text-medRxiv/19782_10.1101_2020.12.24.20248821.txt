General abstract

15

Public health strategies to contain the pandemic continue to vary markedly across the world.

16

In Sweden, compared to most advanced economies, social restrictions have primarily relied

17

upon voluntary adherence to a set of recommendations and strict lockdowns have not been

18

enforced. To better understand the development of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in the

19

Stockholm population before the start of mass vaccinations, healthy blood donors and pregnant

20

women (n=4,100) were sampled at random between 14th March-11th December 2020. All

21

individuals (n=200/sampling week) were screened for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) trimer- and

22

RBD-specific IgG responses with highly sensitive and specific ELISA assays, and the results

23

were compared with those from historical controls (n=595). Data were modelled using a

24

probabilistic Bayesian framework that considered individual responses to both antigens. We

25

found that after a steep rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased

26

steadily in approach to the winter second-wave of infections, approaching 15% of all

27

individuals surveyed by 11th December. In agreement with the high transmission rate observed

28

in the Stockholm area, seroprevalence in this cohort of active adults increased during the 9

29

months from the start of the outbreak, but was far from that required for herd immunity at the

30

end of 2020.

Objectives: As Sweden did not enforce social lockdown in response to the pandemic, it is

34

critical to establish seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 in healthy, active adults – here represented

35

by blood donors and pregnant women. Random sampling was carried out in Stockholm, the

36

country’s most populous region, and the study ran from virus emergence (March 2020) until

37

the end of 2020, shortly prior to the first round of vaccinations, allowing for an estimate of

38

population seropositivity in response to natural infection.

39

Design: In this cross-sectional prospective study, otherwise-healthy blood donors (n=2,100)

40

and pregnant women (n=2,000) were sampled at random for consecutive weeks (at three

41

intervals) between 14th March and 11th December 2020. Sera from all participants and a large

42

cohort of historical controls (n=595) were screened for IgG responses against the SARS-CoV-

43

2 spike (S) trimer and the receptor-binding domain (RBD). As a complement to standard

44

approaches to analyze the data, a probabilistic Bayesian approach that assigns likelihood of

45

past infection was used to analyze the population data. The study was carried out in accordance

46

with Swedish Ethical Review Authority registration no. 2020-01807.

47

Setting: Healthy participant samples were selected from their respective pools at random

48

through the Karolinska University Hospital.

49

Participants: None of the participants were symptomatic at the time of sampling and none had

50

previously been hospitalized for COVID-19. No additional metadata was available from the

51

samples.

52

Results: Blood donors and pregnant women showed a similar seroprevalence. After a steep

53

rise at the start of the pandemic, the seroprevalence trajectory increased steadily in approach to

54

the winter second-wave of infections, approaching 15% of all individuals surveyed by 11th

55

December 2020. Importantly, 96% of antibody-positive healthy donors screened (n=56)

56

developed neutralizing antibody responses at titers comparable to or higher than those observed

57

in clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccination, supporting that mild infection

58

engenders a competent B cell response.

59

Conclusions: In agreement with currently rising COVID-19 cases and ICU occupancy during

60

a second winter wave of infections, these data demonstrate that the metropolitan Stockholm

61

area was far from herd immunity nine months after the outbreak, with approximately one-in-

62

six persons in the examined cohort seropositive for SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

65
66

Densely populated areas – such as Stockholm county – facilitate the spread of SARS-CoV-2

67

and evidence suggests that transmission can be curtailed by temporary restriction of leisure and

68

business activities, and track and trace1. In contrast to the vast majority of European, American

69

and Asian countries, Sweden has favored a strategy in which individuals are encouraged to

70

adhere to a set of basic public health instructions, while society has remained largely open –

71

drawing numerous criticisms. The country has reported a significantly higher burden on the

72

healthcare system than its Scandinavian neighbors (Fig. 1A).

73
74

Enumerating past infection status over time is critical for estimating viral spread and

75

understanding characteristics of adaptive immune responses to a new pathogen. Antibody

76

testing is also important for optimal planning of vaccination campaigns, especially when

77

vaccines doses are limited. Therefore, to estimate seropositivity in the capital city, we

78

developed robust SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests and statistical methods and applied them to

79

healthy participants in the region throughout 2020.

80
81

Blood donors and pregnant women, studied throughout, represent two good proxies for adult

82

population health, being generally working age and mobile members of society without being

83

enriched for individuals at especially high-risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, such as healthcare

84

or public transportation employees, where seroprevalence may be higher. Similarly,

85

seroprevalence may be lower in the unexposed and elderly, and higher in children.

86
87

The data presented here follow seropositivity in across the first and second waves of infections

88

in Stockholm, providing critical information about population immunity over time and prior to

89

the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

Human samples and ethical declaration

95

Anonymized samples from blood donors (n=100/sampling week) and pregnant women

96

(n=100/sampling week) were randomly selected from their respective pools by the department

97

of Clinical Microbiology, Karolinska University Hospital. No metadata, such as age or sex

98

information were available for the samples in the study. Pregnant women were sampled as part

99

of routine screening for infectious diseases during the first trimester of pregnancy. Blood

100

donors (n=595) collected through the same channels a year previously (Spring 2019) were

101

randomly selected for use as assay negative controls. The use of study samples was approved

102

by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (registration no. 2020-01807) and no study subject

103

was hospitalized for COVID-19 or symptomatic at sample collection. Blood donors are

104

required to be a healthy for a minimum of two weeks before donation.

The plasmid for expression of the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized spike ectodomain with a

118

C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization motif was obtained from2. The plasmid was used to

119

transiently transfect FreeStyle 293F cells using FreeStyle MAX reagent (Thermo Fisher

Scientific). The ectodomain was purified from filtered supernatant on Streptactin XT resin

121

(IBA Lifesciences), followed by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 in 5 mM

122

Tris pH 8, 200 mM NaCl. The RBD domain (RVQ – QFG) of SARS-CoV-2 was cloned

123

upstream of a Sortase A recognition site (LPETG) and a 6xHIS tag, and expressed in 293F

124

cells as described above. RBD-HIS was purified from filtered supernatant on His-Pur Ni-NTA

128

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA

129

96-well ELISA plates (Nunc MaxiSorp) were coated with SARS-CoV-2 S trimers, RBD or

130

nucleocapsid (100 μl of 1 ng/μl) in PBS overnight at 4oC. Plates were washed six times with

131

PBS-Tween-20 (0.05%) and blocked using PBS-5% no-fat milk. Human serum samples were

132

thawed at room temperature, diluted (1:100 unless otherwise indicated), and incubated in

133

blocking buffer for 1h (with vortexing) before plating. Serum samples were incubated

134

overnight at 4oC before washing, as before. Secondary HRP-conjugated anti-human antibodies

135

were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated with samples for 1 hour at room temperature.

136

Plates were washed a final time before development with TMB Stabilized Chromogen

137

(Invitrogen). The reaction was stopped using 1M sulphuric acid and optical density (OD)

138

values were measured at 450 nm using an Asys Expert 96 ELISA reader (Biochrom Ltd.).

139

Secondary antibodies (from Southern Biotech) and dilutions used: goat anti-human IgG (2014-

140

05) at 1:10,000. All assays were developed for their fixed time and negative control samples

141

were run alongside test samples in all assays. Raw 450nm optical density data were log

142

transformed for statistical analyses.

144

In vitro virus neutralisation assay

145

Pseudotyped viruses were generated by the co-transfection of HEK293T cells with plasmids

146

encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein harboring an 18 amino acid truncation of the

147

cytoplasmic tail2; a plasmid encoding firefly luciferase; a lentiviral packaging plasmid

148

(Addgene 8455) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen). Media was changed 12-16 hours post-

149

transfection and pseudotyped viruses harvested at 48- and 72-hours, filtered through a 0.45 µm

150

filter and stored at -80°C until use. Pseudotyped neutralisation assays were adapted from

151

protocols validated to characterize the neutralization of HIV, but with the use of HEK293T-

152

ACE2 cells. Briefly, pseudotyped viruses sufficient to generate ~100,000 RLUs were incubated

153

with serial dilutions of heat-inactivated serum for 60 min at 37°C. Approximately 15,000

154

HEK293T-ACE2 cells were then added to each well and the plates incubated at 37°C for 48

155

hours. Luminescence was measured using Bright-Glo (Promega) according to the

156

manufacturer’s instructions on a GM-2000 luminometer (Promega) with an integration time of

157

0.3s. The limit of detection was at a 1:45 serum dilution.

159

Probabilistic seroprevalence estimations

160

Prior to analysis, each sample OD was standardized by dividing by the mean OD of “no sample

161

controls” on that plate or other plates run on the same day. This resulted in more similar

162

distributions for 2019 blood donor samples with 2020 blood donors and pregnant volunteers.

163

Our Bayesian approach is presented in detail in Christian et al3. Briefly, we used a logistic

164

regression over anti-RBD and -S training data (from n=595 historical blood donor controls and

165

n=138 SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ individuals across the clinical spectrum) to model the relationship

166

between the ELISA measurements and the probability that a sample is antibody-positive. We

167

adjusted for the training data class proportions and used these adjusted probabilities to inform

168

the seroprevalence estimates for each time point. Given that the population seroprevalence

169

cannot increase dramatically from one week to the next, we constructed a prior over

170

seroprevalence trajectories using a transformed Gaussian Process, and combined this with the

171

individual class-balance adjusted infection probabilities for each donor to infer the posterior

172

distribution over seroprevalence trajectories. We validated our Bayesian approach by

173

comparing the output with that of more established probabilistic algorithms (support vector

174

machines and linear discriminant analysis) that we have previously developed for ELISA

175

measurements4, finding strong congruency between the approaches.

176
177
178

Results

179

Blood donor and pregnant women serum samples (n=100 of each per sampling week) were

180

selected at random from their respective pools and the IgG response against SARS-CoV-2 S

181

glycoprotein trimers and the smaller RBD subunit was measured in all sera using established

182

ELISA assays4 (Fig. 1B-E). Test samples were run alongside historical (negative) control sera

183

(n=595 blood donors from spring 2019) throughout the study.

184
185

Using conventional 3 or 6 standard deviations (SD) from the mean of negative control sera as

186

assay cut-offs for positivity, and simple linear regression, between 17-21% and 14-19% of

187

individuals were IgG-positive against spike or the RBD, respectively, at the last sampling point

188

(11th December) (Fig. 1F).

189
190

However, the many measurements between the 3 and 6 SD cut-offs for both or a single antigen

191

highlight the problem of assigning case to low values. Therefore, to provide an accurate

192

seropositivity estimates for this metric and to model population-level changes over time, we

193

developed and validated a cut-off-independent, probabilistic Bayesian framework that models

194

the log odds a sample is antibody-positive based on responses in training data; in this case

195

SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ COVID-19 patients across the clinical spectrum that we have extensively

196

characterized3,4. The correct classification of low titers is important, since a number of cases

197

that have experienced asymptomatic or mild infection generate antibody titers closer to the

198

assay boundary, and antibody levels decline with time in all seropositive individuals, meaning

199

that incorrect classification can skew seroprevalence estimates4–7.

200
201

Using this more quantitative approach that considers the wide range of responses present in the

202

population and shares information between sampling weeks, we found seropositivity to

203

increase sharply at the start of the pandemic (Fig. 1G). By the time COVID-19 deaths in the

204

country were at very low levels during August, the seroprevalence trajectory increased at a

205

slower rate approaching to the winter second wave (Fig. 1A and G), in agreement with

206

continued viral spread in the Stockholm population, and consistent with persistent antibody

207

responses over a 9-month period.

208
209

By week 50 (11th December), our probabilistic approach identified 14.8% (95% Bayesian CI

210

[12.2-18.0]) of the cohort to have been previously infected (Supp. Table 1). We validated the

211

estimates from our Bayesian approach with an equal-weighted (cut-off-independent) learner

212

from the output of support vector machines and linear discriminant analysis that we previously

213

optimized for ELISA measurements (Fig. 1G)4, which showed highly consistent results.

214
215

Importantly, 96% of antibody-positive blood donors and pregnant women randomly sub-

216

sampled from the entire cohort (n=56) had virus neutralizing responses in their sera (ID50=600;

217

95% CI [357 – 1,010] and ID50=350; 95% CI [228 - 538], respectively, Fig. 1H-I), with titers

218

comparable to those engendered by recently-approved COVID-19 mRNA vaccines that were

219

shown to be protective in clinical phase 3 trials 8,9. These observations support that

220

asymptomatic/mild infection generates an antibody response that provides a first line of

221

defense against potential re-exposures10, although inter-individual heterogeneity will have a

222

role in outcomes11–13.

Discussion

227

To characterize immunological responses to SARS-CoV-2 and safeguard public health, it is

228

critical to monitor the level of population immunity after natural infection 14, especially in

229

settings with different public health measures – allowing for concurrent and retroactive

230

evaluation of different strategies. As Sweden has taken a unique public health approach to

231

mitigate the effects of the virus, data from the country provide an important contrast to

232

comparable settings and may help inform future pandemic management.

233
234

Serology is amenable to studies of large cohorts and is the gold standard for determining

235

previous exposure to pathogens. Importantly, increasing evidence suggests that most persons

236

infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop virus-specific antibodies, including following mild or

237

asymptomatic infections4,15,16. Studies have highlighted the protective role B cells play in

238

controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans10 and animal models17,18, while potent

239

neutralizing antibodies were rapidly isolated from infected donor samples19–21. Critical future

240

research is required to determine the duration of B cell memory in those infected, as well as

241

following vaccination. Early results show that infected individuals can maintain a detectable

242

virus-specific B cell response for at least eight months 20,22, which together with the steadily

243

increasing seropositivity observed in the study (and in NYC23), help allay early fears that

244

immunity waned in the short-term; although individuals with mild infection can have titers

245

close to the assay boundary that may decline from peak responses at different rates between

246

individuals. Neutralizing titers in our study samples were comparable to those engendered by

247

the first mRNA vaccines, supporting that natural infection generates immunological memory.

248

Given these observations, antibody testing should be used for optimal coordination of vaccine

249

interventions, especially in the near future when vaccine doses are expected to be limited.

250
251

Epidemiologically, the data presented here indicate that nine months after viral emergence in

252

Stockholm, Sweden – and in the midst of a winter second wave – approximately one-in-six

253

active adults (represented by blood donors and pregnant women) have been infected with the

254

virus. Although this is a considerable number, which is associated with a significant public

255

health burden24, this proportion remains far from that required for herd immunity. This situation

256

in Stockholm is similar to that observed in New York City, USA, where despite high rates of

257

infection and mortality25, herd immunity was not attained within six months of the outbreak,

258

reaching ca. 20% of the general popualtion23. Compared to other European regions, our study

259

supports that Stockholm has fared worse in terms of infections (following the first wave) than

260

the majority of study locations26–28, with the exception of Lombardy, Italy (23% seropositivity,

261

an early European center of infection)29, and comparable to London, UK (13%)30 and Geneva,

262

Switzerland (11%)31. However, direct comparisons between sites are complicated by

263

differences in the demographics of the study subjects as well as the sensitivity of the assay used

264

for antibody detection32. Longitudinal studies over longer timescales (first, second and future

265

waves), using robust antibody tests and different cohorts are urgently needed for improved

266

comparisons and understanding COVID-19.

267
268

Together, the results presented here highlight the continued need for measures to curtail virus

269

dissemination and protect the most vulnerable in society. Understanding seroprevalence

270

changes in the population (and individuals) over time - including following the introduction of

271

vaccines - is of fundamental importance for informing public health approaches.

Figure 1: SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity estimates in Stockholm: March-December 2020. (A) Population-adjusted COVID-19 deaths for
selected countries during the pandemic. (B) Anti-S IgG responses in blood donors (BD), pregnant women (PW) and n=595 historical control
sera. 100 BD and 100 PW samples were analyzed per sampling week. Conventional 3 and 6 SD assay cut-offs are shown as dashed and solid
lines, respectively. (C) Spike seropositivity in BD and PW according to 3 and 6 SD cut-offs. (D) Anti-RBD IgG responses in blood donors (BD),
pregnant women (PW) and n=595 historical control sera. Conventional 3 and 6 SD assay cut-offs are shown as dashed and solid lines,
respectively. (E) RBD seropositivity in BD and PW according to 3 and 6 SD cut-offs. (F) Seropositivity estimates in BD and PW combined
according to 3 and 6 SD cut-offs. Simple linear regression was applied to each estimate. (G) Cut-off-independent Bayesian modelling of
population seropositivity. A frequentist, equal-weighted ensemble learner from the output of support vector machines and linear discriminant
analysis was used to validate the Bayesian framework. (H) In vitro pseudotyped virus neutralizing titers in a subset of antibody-positive BD and
PW. Bars represent the geometric mean. (I) Binding and neutralization - for samples in (H) - are highly correlated.
