Introduction

36

37

The direct health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are colossal, and are continuing to

38

grow, with approximately one million deaths directly attributed to COVID-19 (1). However,

39

researchers and practitioners have already highlighted that the indirect effects of COVID-19

40

on global health - through the disruption of essential healthcare services - may be even

41

larger and longer lasting (2, 3).

42

43

TB

and

HIV

are

globally; in 2018, 1.5 and 1.1 million people died from TB and from HIV-related illnesses

Policies to minimise disruptions to TB and HIV care must be put in place urgently. To do this,

56

we need to understand the range of impacts of COVID-19 on TB and HIV services, and

identify feasible strategies for mitigation. Information from frontline health professionals

and researchers is invaluable and often insufficiently incorporated into policy planning or in

We used three approaches to share the invitation to complete our survey. First, we sent

Survey

The survey was initially designed in English by an international team with diverse expertise

88

in TB and HIV control working in Europe, Asia and Africa. It was first piloted with eight

95

Using SurveyMonkey enabled us to administer a survey that could only be answered once

96

per device, and did not collect identifying information. We provided introductory text and a

97

downloadable information sheet on the landing page. Respondents gave consent - after

98

reading the information sheet - by checking boxes to confirm that they agreed to participate

99

and allowed text responses to be quoted verbatim. It was possible for participants to agree

100

to participate, but to decline use of verbatim quotes.

101

102

We used adaptive questioning, whereby nine HIV or TB- specific questions, or 18 covering

103

both, were displayed based depending on which areas the respondent wanted to provide

104

information about. Of the nine questions, seven were multiple choice (Table 2), with space

105

to add free text using the ‘other’ option. There were two open response questions that only

106

collected free text and these constitute the qualitative responses. The first asked about

107

COVID-19 related rules that have been introduced by the government and how these have

108

impacted TB/HIV health services. The second solicited information about measures that can

109

be taken (or have already been taken) to minimize disruptions. There was no limit to the

110

amount of text a respondent could insert.

111

112

The survey and participant information sheet were translated into 10 additional languages:

113

Arabic, Bahasa, Chinese, French, Portuguese, Russian, Shona, Spanish, Swahili, and Urdu.

114

There were at least two translators for each language, so that every translation was checked

115

by an independent native or fluent speaker.

Results

131

132

Of the 923 respondents that initiated the consent process and accessed survey questions,

133

669 (72%) from 64 countries completed it. 567 respondents answered the TB section, and

134

346 answered the HIV section. There was a greater representation of health professional

135

based in sub-Saharan African countries in responses about HIV as compared to TB (Figure 1).

136

Demographic and professional characteristics of respondents are in Table 1.

mentioned over 30 times across Asian, African and Latin American countries. Specifically, it

158

was highlighted that both reduced access to usual modes of transport and increased cost of

159

transport created barriers to reaching healthcare facilities for both healthcare providers and

160

patients. Furthermore, the impact of transport disruptions on essential supplies reaching

161

healthcare facilities was noted repeatedly as an issue to address:

162

enforcement to make sure it really doesn't hamper movement of essential items; other

163

endemic diseases should not be neglected due to COVID-19. [M, doctor, Nigeria].

164

policies to address transport disruptions suggested were: proactive coordination between

165

the health and transport sector (including private transport companies); cards that facilitate

166

lower cost or easier travel for patients and providers, and public information to reassure

patients that they can travel for healthcare.

Disruptions to service provision at TB and HIV facilities

191

Over 70% of respondents reported that TB and HIV facilities had revised their operating

192

procedures to include physical distancing protocols for patients, and over 70% also reported

193

that TB and HIV facilities had introduced Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for healthcare

194

providers. The importance of PPE, and masks in particular, was mentioned commonly (35

195

times for healthcare providers and 20 times for patients) across numerous countries. We

Abstract

Objective

The experiences of frontline healthcare professionals are essential in identifying strategies

to mitigate the disruption to healthcare services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional study of TB and HIV professionals in low and middle-income

countries

(LMIC).

Between

May

and

12

August

6

2020,

we

collected

qualitative

and

quantitative data using an online survey in 11 languages. We used descriptive statistics and

thematic analysis to analyse responses.

Findings

669 respondents from 64 countries completed the survey. Over 40% stated that it was

either impossible or much harder for TB and HIV patients to reach healthcare facilities since

COVID-19. The

most common

barriers reported

to affect patients

were:

fear of getting

infected with SARS-CoV-2, transport disruptions and movement restrictions. 37% and 28%

of responses about TB and HIV stated that healthcare provider access to facilities was also

severely

impacted. Strategies

to address reduced transport needs and costs

– including

proactive coordination between the health and transport sector and cards that facilitate

lower cost or easier travel - were presented in qualitative responses. Access to non-medical

support for patients, such as food supplementation or counselling, was severely disrupted

according

to

36%

and

31%

respondents

suggested that the need for such services was exacerbated.

Patients and healthcare providers across numerous LMIC faced substantial challenges in
