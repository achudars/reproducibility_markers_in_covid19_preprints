Abstract

Background: Supportive treatment is an important and effective part of the

management for patients with life-threatening diseases. This study aims to identify and

evaluate the forms of supportive care for patients with respiratory diseases.

Methods: An umbrella review of supportive care for patient respiratory diseases was

undertaken. We comprehensively searched the following databases: Medline, EMBASE,

Web of Science, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), Wanfang Data and

CBM (SinoMed) from their inception to 31 March 2020, and other sources to identify

systematic reviews and meta-analyses related to supportive treatments for patient with

respiratory diseases including COVID-19, SARS, MERS and influenza. We assessed

the methodological quality using the AMSTAR score and the quality of the evidence for

the primary outcomes of each included systematic review and meta-analysis.

Results: We included 18 systematic reviews and meta-analyses in this study. Most

studies focused on the respiratory and circulatory support. Ten studies were of high

methodological quality, five studies of medium quality, and three studies of low quality.

According to four studies extracorporeal membrane oxygenation did not reduce

mortality in adults (OR/RR ranging from 0.71 to 1.28), but two studies reported

significantly lower mortality in patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane

oxygenation than in the control group (OR/RR ranging from 0.38 to 0.73). Besides,

monitoring of vital signs and increasing the number of medical staff may also reduce

the mortality in patients with respiratory diseases.

Conclusions: Our overview suggests that supportive care may reduce the mortality of

patients with respiratory diseases to some extent. However, the quality of evidence for

the primary outcomes in the included studies was low to moderate. Further systematic

reviews and meta-analyses are needed to address the evidence gap regarding the

supportive care for SARS, MERS and COVID-19.

Background
The aim of supportive care is to prevent or treat the symptoms of a disease, side effects

caused by treatment of a disease, and psychological and social problems related to a

disease or its treatment as early as possible (1). Supportive care can also be called

comfort care, palliative care, or symptom management. Supportive care can improve the

quality of life of patients who have a serious or life-threatening disease, such as cancer

(2). Besides, for patients with respiratory diseases, supportive care also is an important

and effective part of the management (3). A systematic review related to severe acute

respiratory syndrome (SARS) treatment suggested that meticulous supportive care is the

only form of treatment that can be recommended (4). Another systematic review

showed that continuous monitoring of vital signs outside the critical care setting is

feasible and may provide a benefit in terms of improved patient outcomes and cost

efficiency (5). According to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines there is

currently no treatment recommended for coronavirus infections except supportive care

as needed (6).

In early 2020, a pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)

emerged in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread to more than 100 countries around the

world (7). As of 12 April 2020, more than 1,690,000 cases and more than 100,000

deaths have been confirmed according to the WHO (8). The disease caused by

SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has had been declared a global

pandemic (9) However, there is so far no effective treatment or vaccine to curb the

spread of the epidemic. Thus, we conducted this overview to identify the available and

effective forms of supportive care for patients with respiratory diseases. We hope this

review will help physicians working on COVID-19 to understand more about

supportive care and make decisions on treatment selection for COVID-19.

reviews and meta-analyses that focused on the proportion of medical staff, monitoring

of vital signs, respiratory and circulatory support, and psychological intervention. We

also considered systematic reviews and meta-analyses with related indirect evidence if

no sufficient literature on COVID-19, SARS, MERS and influenza was found. We

excluded duplicates, conference abstracts and articles where we failed to access full text

and data despite contacting the authors.

Study selection and data extraction

Two reviewers (X Luo and M Lv) screened all titles, abstracts and full texts

independently and solved disagreements by consensus or consultation with a third

reviewer. We extracted the following basic information: 1) title, 2) first author, 3)

publication year, 4) journal, 5) number of included studies, 6) study design of included

studies, and 7) sample size; and the following information on the results; 1) primary

outcome, 2) effect size (odds ratio, OR; relative risk, RR), 3) 95% confidence interval

(CI), 4) heterogeneity, and 5) main conclusion.

Quality assessment

Two researchers (X Wang and X Zhang) independently evaluated the quality of the

included studies and cross-checked the results. If necessary, a third reviewer (X Luo)

participated in the discussion. Methodological quality assessment of included literature

was performed using the AMSTAR tool (10). The AMSTAR score has a total of 11

points, with studies scoring between 9 and 11 being considered to be of high quality,

studies scoring between 6 and 8 of medium quality, and studies scoring between 0 and 5

of low quality. We evaluated the quality of evidence for the primary outcomes of each

included systematic review and meta-analysis using the GRADE method (11).

Data synthesis

We conducted a descriptive analysis of the included literature. We analyzed studies on

the proportion of medical staff, monitoring of vital signs, respiratory and circulatory

support, and psychological intervention for patients with respiratory diseases separately.

All statistical analyses were conducted in STATA 14.0. A random-effects model was

used to show the primary outcomes from each systematic review and meta-analysis.

Results
A total of 3536 records were identified. After reading the full texts, eighteen systematic

reviews and meta-analyses were included (5,12-28) (Figure 1). Twelve reviews

(13,14,16-18,22-28) studied respiratory and circulatory support, three (5,15,21) the

monitoring of vital signs, two (19,20) the proportion of medical staff, and one (12)

psychological impact. (Table 1)

Quality assessment of included studies

According to the AMSTAR scores, ten studies (13-15,20-26) were of high quality, five

studies (5,16,17,19,28) of medium quality, and three studies (12,18,27) of low quality

(Table 2). According to our assessment using the GRADE approach, five of the 15

primary outcomes were based on moderate-quality evidence, and ten on low-quality

evidence (Table 3).

Respiratory and circulatory support
Twelve included systematic reviews and meta-analyses focused on respiratory
circulation support, of which seven studies explored the role of extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in reducing in the mortality of patients with acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and four studies reported outcomes of ECMO
on H1N1. One study explored the effects of prone ventilation on oxygenation index
and mortality in patients with ARDS (Figure 2).
Of the 11 systematic reviews and meta-analyses on ECMO, seven reported the
impact of ECMO on ARDS; four of them reviewed the impact of ECMO on ARDS in
adults, and the results of the four studies showed that ECMO did not reduce the
mortality of adults. There was large heterogeneity between the included studies in the
reviews. One study reported that mortality in ECMO group was lower than control
group in the subgroup of Chinese patients [OR=0.39, 95% CI, 0.17-0.86]. Another
article reported that the probability of experiencing at least one adverse event of
ECMO varied greatly between studies, with a range of 1.1%-100%. Two other
meta-analyses reported a reduction in ARDS related mortality in patients having
venovenous ECMO. Both meta-analyses showed that mortality was significantly
lower in the venovenous ECMO group than in the control group. However, both
studies also reported an association between venovenous ECMO and bleeding. Finally,
one study reported the mortality rate in patients receiving extracorporeal life support
(ELS) for the treatment of ARDS. Meta-analysis showed that ELS failed to show any
survival benefit in ARDS patients, and the heterogeneity among studies was large;

however, when the study type was limited to RCT, there was a mortality difference
favoring the ECMO group [OR=0.51, 95% CI, 0.37-0.70, P=0.33, I2=12.2%], and
bleeding was more common in the ELS group.
Of the 11 studies, four focused on H1N1 and conditions associated with it. Two
reviews reported the outcomes of patients infected with H1N1. The results of one
meta-analysis showed that outcomes were highly variable among the included studies,
with short-term in-hospital risk of death ranging between 8% and 65%, mainly
depending on baseline patient characteristics. Random-effect pooled estimates
suggested a 28% risk of in-hospital death [95% CI, 18%-37%] among patients with
H1N1-associated severe acute lung injury. According to another systematic review,
the risk ratio for death with versus without ECMO based on three trials was 0.93 [95%
CI, 0.71-1.22]，and the heterogeneity among studies was large. One systematic review
indicated that the pooled estimate of the survival probability among pregnant and
postpartum patients who received ECMO was 74.6% [95% CI, 60.7%-88.6%].
Heterogeneity was not significant in any combination of four of the five included
primary studies (I2=0-21%; P>0.25). The last of the four reviews reported the
outcomes of severe influenza infection with respiratory failure. The overall risk of
death was 37% [95% CI, 30%-45%], the median duration for ECMO was 10 days and
for mechanical ventilation 19 days, and the median length of ICU stay was 33 days.
However, the heterogeneity among studies was large (I2=65%).
One review reviewed the influence of ventilation in prone position on patients
with ARDS. Seven of the 12 included studies in this review evaluated the effect of the

prone position on the oxygenation index. The oxygenation index of the group
receiving ventilation in the prone position was significantly higher than that of the
control group (ventilation in supine position) [OR=69.65, 95% CI, 37.13-102.7,
P<0.001]. Eight studies evaluated the impact of the prone position on the mortality,
showing that the mortality in the prone position was significantly lower than that in
the supine position [OR= 0.63, 95% CI, 0.51-0.78, P<0.001].

Monitoring of vital signs
Three systematic reviews and meta-analyses explored the impact of monitoring vital
signs and symptoms on influenza patients and the general population (Figure 2). One
systematic review published in 2018 assessed if continuous monitoring is practical
outside of the critical care setting, and whether it confers any clinical benefit to
patients. The majority of studies showed benefits such as less need for critical care
and shorter hospital stay. Larger studies were more likely to demonstrate clinical
benefit, particularly in the need of critical care use and length of hospital stay.
Barriers to implementation of monitoring of symptoms and vital signs included
concerns about the negative effects among nurses and patients, and the burden of false
alerts. In summary, continuous monitoring of vital signs outside the critical care
setting is feasible and may provide a benefit in terms of improved patient outcomes.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2016 identified strategies to
improve the monitoring of intermittent or continuous vital signs and prevent adverse
events in general hospital wards. The results suggested that strategies for monitoring

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.13.20064360; this version posted April 17, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

13

continuous vital signs were not associated with significant reductions in in-hospital
mortality [OR=0.87, 95% CI, 0.57-1.33]. There was only minor heterogeneity
between studies (I2=27%, P=0.25). In contrast, enhanced monitoring of intermittent
vital signs was associated with modest reduction in the risk of death when compared
with usual care [OR=0.78, 95% CI, 0.61-0.99]. However, there was no evidence of
reduction in the need of transfer to ICU or in adverse events with either intermittent or
continuous monitoring.
Besides, the syndromic surveillance for influenza and influenza-like-illness from
the emergency department is becoming more common to detect yearly influenza
outbreaks, as shown in a systematic review.

Medical staff
Two systematic reviews reported the impact of the number of medical staff on disease
outcomes (Figure 2). One examined the association between registered nurse (RN)
staffing and patient outcomes in acute care hospitals. The results showed that
increased RN staffing was associated with lower mortality in intensive care units
(ICUs) [OR=0.91, 95% CI, 0.86-0.96], in surgical patients [OR=0.84, 95% CI,
0.80-0.89), and in medical patients [OR=0.94, 95% CI, 0.94-0.95]; all ORs reported
per additional full time equivalent RN per patient-day). An increase by one RN per
patient-day was associated with decreased odds of hospital acquired pneumonia
[OR=0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.88], unplanned extubation [OR=0.49, 95% CI, 0.36-0.67],
respiratory failure [OR=0.40, 95% CI, 0.27-0.59], and cardiac arrest (OR=0.72, 95%

CI, 0.62-0.84] in ICUs, with a lower risk of failure to rescue [OR=0.84, 95% CI,
0.79-0.90] in surgical patients. Increase of one RN per patient-day also shortened the
length of stay in ICUs [OR=0.76, 95% CI, 0.62-0.94] and in surgical patients
[OR=0.69, 95% CI, 0.55-0.86]. Another study examined the association between
nurse staffing levels and nurse-sensitive patient outcomes in acute special units. The
results of the meta-analysis, comprising of six original studies, reported ORs on
all-cause in hospital mortality of 175,755 patients admitted to ICUs or cardiac or
cardiothoracic units. A higher level of nurse staffing decreased the risk of in-hospital
death by 14% [95% CI, 0.79-0.94]. However, the meta-analysis also showed high
heterogeneity (I2=86%).

Psychological impact
A rapid review published in 2020 focused on the psychological impact of quarantine
to explore its likely effects on mental health and psychological wellbeing, and the
factors that contribute to, or mitigate, these effects. A total of 24 studies were
included and the results showed that stressors during quarantine were 1) duration of
quarantine; 2) fears of infection; 3) frustration and boredom; 4) inadequate supplies;
and 5) inadequate information. The stressors during post-quarantine time were
finances and stigma. This rapid review suggested to keep quarantine time as short as
possible, give people as much information as possible, provide adequate supplies,
reduce the boredom, and improve the communication. Special attention should be
paid on health-care workers’ mental health, and it is advisable to appeal to people’s

altruism and the public health benefits of isolation rather than compulsion. Overall,
the psychological impact of quarantine is wide-ranging, substantial, and can be long
lasting. Officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide
clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient
supplies are provided.

Discussion
Our study showed that for patients with respiratory diseases, especially H1N1 patients,
ECMO may effectively reduce mortality, but attention should be paid to the risk of
bleeding. For patients in non-critical wards, monitoring and recording of vital signs
can effectively reduce mortality. In addition, increasing the number of medical staff in
intensive care units can also reduce mortality. At the same time, psychological
intervention is equally important for isolating patients. All systematic reviews were of
low to moderate quality.
Supportive treatment is an important and effective part of the management for
patients with respiratory diseases (29). After systematic searching, we did not find
systematic reviews or meta-analyses for supportive care in SARS, MERS or
COVID-19-patients, and only five systematic reviews and meta-analyses for influenza.
In the absence of direct evidence, we focused on systematic reviews and
meta-analysis of ECMO for ARDS. Overall, compared with the control group, ECMO
did not reduce mortality in adult patients with ARDS, and the quality of evidence was
relatively low due to the large heterogeneity between studies. ECMO can improve

severe hypoxemia in patients with ARDS, keep the lungs at rest, and wait for lung
tissue to repair, but the clinical research results on the prognosis of patients with
ARDS are not consistent. At the same time, two systematic reviews have shown that
venovenous ECMO can reduce ARDS-related mortality, however the risk of bleeding
needs to be considered. For patients with H1N1, one of the two currently available
systematic reviews also reported that ECMO was associated with reduced risk of
death (13,16). A systematic review (16) published in 2013 suggested that ECMO is
effective in reducing the mortality of patients with H1N1, but not among patients with
ARDS caused by other pathogens. The benefit of ECMO may thus depend on the
cause of ARDS (30).
Monitoring vital signs with non-critical patients can reduce patient mortality and
shorten the length of hospital stay, but the specific circumstances of the patient need
to be considered, such as affordability and acceptability (31).
Increasing the number of medical staff in the intensive care unit can reduce the
mortality of patients. The likely reason is that due to the increase in the number of
caregivers, patients can receive more time, attention and care. However, given the
limited medical resources, investing in more medical staff into the ICU may need to
be balanced by savings in some other expenditure, for example staff in other
departments. Therefore, investing more medical staff into the ICU still needs further
evaluation. In addition, for infectious diseases like SARS, MERS and COVID-19,
psychological intervention is equally important. We found systematic reviews that
analyzed the factors that may cause mental illness and provides psychological

precautions, but none of them considered COVID-19. For psychological interventions
on COVID-19, relevant research is still needed.
We used the AMSTAR tool to evaluate the methodological quality of the
included systematic reviews and meta-analyses and found that the overall quality is
relatively high. In terms of evidence quality, the main problem was the large
heterogeneity between included studies. The included studies contained only indirect
evidence, and the reliability of the overall quality of evidence was low to moderate,
which must be taken into consideration when the evidence is used for making clinical
practice guidelines.
To our knowledge, this is the first overview of systematic review focusing on the
supportive care for patient with respiratory diseases. We comprehensively searched
systematic reviews and meta-analyses on SARS, MERS, COVID-19 and influenza
and evaluated the quality of methodology and evidence. Nevertheless, our work has
several limitations. First, we conducted a rapid literature searching and screening, and
some relevant studies may have been missed. Second, none of the included systematic
reviews focused on COVID-19, SARS or MERS, so they can be only used as indirect
evidence. Finally, there was large heterogeneity between the included studies, and
most primary studies included in these systematic reviews were observational studies,
which may influence the reliability of the reviews. However, systematic reviews and
meta-analyses of non-randomized studies can be meaningful and guide clinical
research and practice, even if only by emphasizing the limitations of the available
clinical evidence.

Conclusion
In conclusion, our overview suggests that supportive cares may reduce the mortality
of patients with respiratory diseases to some extent. Having more medical staff in ICU,
using of ECMO, monitoring vital signs and conducting counselling to patients
exposed to respiratory diseases are all effective measures to improve the patients’
outcomes. However, further studies are needed to address the evidence gap regarding
