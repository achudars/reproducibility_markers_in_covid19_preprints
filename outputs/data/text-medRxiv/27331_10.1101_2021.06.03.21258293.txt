Interim estimates of increased transmissibility, growth rate, and reproduction number
of the Covid-19 B.1.617.2 variant of concern in the United Kingdom.

Abstract
This paper relates to data from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, UK, regarding Covid-19
genomic surveillance. We use a simple model to give point estimates of the effective
reproduction numbers of the B.1.617.2 and B.1.1.7 lineages in England, from sequenced data
as at 15 May 2021. Comparison with the estimated reproduction number of B.1.1.7 enables
an estimate of the increased transmissibility of B.1.617.2. We conclude that it is almost certain
that there is increased transmissibility that will rapidly lead to B.1.617.2 becoming the
prevailing variant in the UK. The derived estimates of increased transmissibility have
uncertainty relating to the actual distribution of the generation interval, but they do point,
under present conditions of vaccination coverage and NPIs, to exponential growth of positive
cases.
1. Sequencing data
Table 1 shows numbers and proportions of positive genomically sequenced cases in
England that are B.1.617.2 (Indian variant) and B.1.1.7 (Kent variant), for the period 20 March
to 22 May 2021. That data [1], is expressed in cases per week (by date on which sample is
collected), calculated as two-week averages centred on 27 March, 3 April, …. , 8 May, 15
May. It excludes recent travellers, and special studies, so that it more realistically reflects
community transmission. Until mid-April 2021 it excluded “surge testing” but this is now included
as it is no longer thought to bias the proportion of the now common B.1.617.2 variant. The aim
of this paper is to obtain a rough estimate of the effective reproduction numbers of these two
variants at 15 May 2021, and hence the increased transmissibility of B.1.617.2 over B.1.1.7, for
different distributions of the generation interval. The data shown in the first 6 columns of table
1, extracted from [1], relate to these two lineages which account for between 98% and 99% of
all cases in this period. In tandem with these data, we used the number of all positive cases in
England (sequenced and un-sequenced), by date of specimen [2], and averaged over a centred
15-day cycle to replicate the approach used for sequenced data.
Relevant work in this area is that of Public Health England [3]. That includes estimates
of secondary attack rates for the two variants and of the growth rate of B.1.617.2 relative to
that of B.1.1.7 at 22 May 2021. The date is relevant as the present paper shows that the growth
rate of B.1.617.2 appears to be decreasing. Similar questions were addressed regarding the
detection in South East England in September 2020 of the, then, more transmissible variant
B.1.1.7. , [4].

2. Effective reproduction numbers, comparative transmissibility, and growth rate
Let 𝑅! (𝑡) and 𝑅" (𝑡) denote the effective reproduction numbers of B.1.1.7 and
B.1.617.2 at time 𝑡. Based upon those cases that were sequenced, the sample proportion of all
cases at time 𝑡, sequenced and un-sequenced, that are variant j, is #

. Here, it is assumed

that those cases that are sequenced are representative of the larger population of all positive
cases. With the Sanger data, the exclusion of travellers and special studies makes this more
likely. The estimated incidence of variant j cases per day is therefore #

where 𝐼(𝑡) is

A generation interval is the time between a (primary) individual becoming infected
and infecting (secondary) individuals. I assume that the distribution of generation interval is
stationary and is the same for both B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2. The latter will be the case providing
the transmission rate of one variant is simply a scaled version of the other. Assuming this to
2
be so, the increase in transmissibility of B.1.617.2 over B.1.1.7 is <2! − 1= 100%. I assume
"

that the generation interval is gamma distributed, as for example in [6,7], with mean 𝜇, shape

parameter 𝛼, and standard deviation . For 𝛼 >1, this allows for an initial phase following
√5
infection in which there is a monotonic increase in transmission rate approximating to the
latent and pre-symptomatic period, a second phase of high transmission, followed by a third
one of monotonic decrease.
3. Results

The Sanger data is available as centred two-week averages every week. This was
converted to daily data by linear interpolation within each week, of the proportions of cases
that are variant 1 and 2. The daily number of all positive cases was obtained from [2],
calculating centred 15-day averages, for each of the 49 days (7 weeks). Table 2 shows point
estimates, as of 15 May 2021, of 𝑅! (49) and 𝑅" (49), the increased transmissibility, and the
overall reproduction number

In table 3, the sample proportion of variants obtained from sequenced data is used to

4. Discussion and Conclusions
The degree of increased transmissibility is large and varies considerably with the
assumed distribution of generation interval. Although not shown here, for a given mean
generation interval, transmissibility increase was relatively insensitive to variability in
generation interval. These results might be compared with secondary attack rates among
contacts that have not travelled [3], (13.5% for B.1.617.2 versus 8.1% for B.1.1.7). Most of the
results in the final column of table 2 are larger than those suggested by the SAGE update of
13 May 2021, [8], where a 50% increase in transmissibility was thought to be a realistic
possibility. For comparison, the official overall effective reproduction number [9] was mainly
in the range (0.8-1.1) during this period.
The estimates of increased transmissibility of B.1.617.2 depend upon the distribution
of the generation interval and 𝑡. We have shown only the values calculated for all the data up
to 𝑡 = 7, that is 15 May (centred date). For low values of 𝑡 there is great uncertainty in the
growth rate of B.1.617.2 (but not of B.1.1.7) because the incidence is so low. However, it was
found that by 𝑡 = 6, 7 the incidence was now high enough for the increased transmissibility
to have stabilised and so the results shown in the last column of table 2 are a reasonable guide
for each given distribution of generation interval.

These results are contingent upon the validity of the model assumptions including the
assumption that the sequencing data are representative of overall community transmission.
With regards to this, local outbreaks might first become apparent in environments where the
transmission rate is biased to high values, for example in communities with large average
household size and less than average social distancing. When B1.617.2 becomes the almost
exclusive variant, as seems inevitable, then its proportion of all cases becomes 1, which
removes uncertainty about the extent to which sequenced data is representative of the entire
population. The uncertainty about the distribution of generation interval remains.
Figure 1 reveals an interesting feature in that the estimated positive growth rate of
B1.617.2 has been decreasing and the positive decline rate of B.1.1.7 increasing. A possible
explanation for this is that in both cases the increasing vaccine roll-out in the UK is more than
compensating for the gradual relaxation of NPIs. Nevertheless, when B.1.617.2 eventually
accounts for almost all cases, column 3 of table 2 shows that under present circumstances there
will be exponential growth as the reproduction number is significantly above 1. It might be
possible to reduce this below 1 by rapidly increasing vaccination coverage, but this might not
be enough in a context of further relaxation of NPIs. Policymakers will need to decide whether
the risks of not taking anticipatory action should that prove to be necessary, outweigh the risks
of intervening should that be shown not to be required. Finally, an unknown is whether
increased case numbers will lead to increased hospitalisations and deaths.
