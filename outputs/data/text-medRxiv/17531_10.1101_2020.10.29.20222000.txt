Abstract:
Objectives: Anti-type I interferon (IFN) autoantibodies have been reported in patients with
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Recently, an association of these autoantibodies with
severe COVID-19 was reported in the general population. We assessed whether having preexisting anti-IFNα autoantibodies was associated with COVID-19 infection in SLE patients.
Methods: Patients with SLE who developed COVID-19 between April 1 st to October 1st, 2020
were studied. Biobanked pre-COVID-19 plasma from these SLE subjects and healthy controls
were tested for anti-IFNα IgG autoantibodies by ELISA. The ability of plasma anti-IFNα
autoantibodies to block signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) phosphorylation
by recombinant human IFNα in vitro was assessed by flow cytometry.
Results: Ten SLE subjects with COVID-19 were identified. A 40% of these subjects had stable
autoantibodies against IFNα for up to three years preceding COVID-19 diagnosis. A 50% of the
subjects with these autoantibodies neutralized IFNα induced STAT1 phosphorylation. None of the
other SLE samples blocked IFNα signaling.
Conclusions: We noted an increased prevalence of pre-existing anti-IFNα autoantibodies in SLE
patients with COVID-19 compared to the reported prevalence in lupus patients and the general
population with severe COVID-19. Autoantibodies against IFNα in SLE patients may be
pathogenic and patients with them maybe at-risk of developing COVID-19.

Introduction:
Type I interferons (IFN), including IFNα, play fundamental roles in innate and adaptive
immune responses and are crucial in host defense against viral pathogens(1). Defects in signaling
pathways of these crucial cytokines, either related to monogenic inborn errors or to the presence
of blocking autoantibodies, results in immunodeficiency and recurrent infections(2, 3). Systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a clinically heterogenous autoimmune syndrome that
predominantly affects women and disproportionately afflicts minorities(4). It has been suggested
that SLE subjects could be at a higher risk of developing COVID-19 with more severe
symptomatology and need for hospitalization due to multiple underlying risk factors such as
immunosuppression, underlying organ damage and comorbidities(5). This hypothesis is still being
tested given the fluid situation of the pandemic. Dysregulation in the type I IFN pathway has been
proposed to play a key role in SLE pathogenesis(6). A comprehensive evaluation of multiple anticytokine autoantibodies showed presence of anti-type I IFN autoantibodies in 11% of SLE
subjects(7). A recent report showed an association between anti-type I IFN autoantibodies in 10%
of subjects with life-threatening COVID-19 in the general population(8). We hypothesized that
SLE patients that carry anti-IFNα autoantibodies at baseline (prior to 2020) may be at higher risk
of developing COVID-19 and that the presence of these autoantibodies may help in guiding
management and preventive strategies.

Methods:
Subject recruitment and clinical assessment.
Biobanked plasma samples from patients with SLE and healthy controls obtained prior to 2020
and stored at -80C were identified through IRB-approved protocols. Patients with SLE fulfilled the
1997 update of the 1982 American College of Rheumatology classification criteria of SLE(9).
Patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection based on symptoms and a positive RT-PCR
(n=6), rapid antigen (n=2) or antibody testing (n=1). One subject (Patient 9) had typical symptoms
of COVID-19 with close family members with RT-PCR positive COVID-19 but was not tested
during active infection or had antibody testing. COVID-19 disease severity for each patient was
assessed in accordance with the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus
Pneumonia (Trial Version 7)(10). Healthy control samples were from age-matched volunteers that
reported no acute or chronic infections.
Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for anti-IFN autoantibodies:

ELISA was performed as previously reported(8). In brief, 96-well ELISA plates (Corning, catalog
# 9018) were coated overnight at 4°C with 50μL of 2μg/mL recombinant human IFNα (rhIFNα)
(PBL assay science, Inc catalog # 11101-2). Plates were then washed, blocked, washed again
and incubated with 1:50 dilution of plasma samples for 3 hours at room temperature. After wash,
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated Fc-specific anti-human IgG (Millipore Sigma) was
added at 1:10,000 dilution, incubated for 1 hour at room temperature and washed. Substrate was
added and OD was measured. Arbitrary units were calculated based on the standard curve
generated using plasma from a patient with known high titer anti-IFNα autoantibodies from a prior
study(7). Values 2 standard deviations above mean in 119 healthy control samples were
considered positive.
Functional evaluation of anti-IFNα autoantibodies:
The blocking activity of anti-IFNα autoantibodies in plasma was determined by assessing
phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (pSTAT1) in healthy control
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) following stimulation with rhIFNα in the presence of
10% healthy control or lupus plasma as previously described(7).

Statistical Analysis:
Data were plotted and statistical analysis performed using GraphPad Prism version 7.

Results:
Prevalence of anti-IFNα autoantibodies in SLE subjects with confirmed COVID-19
Ten SLE subjects who developed COVID-19 between April 1st to October 1st, 2020 were
identified among the SLE individuals followed at the Lupus Clinic, Clinical Center, National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD, USA under IRB-approved SLE natural history protocol 94AR-0066. Demographic and clinical details of the ten SLE patients are listed in Table 1. All
patients were female, between 26-57 years old. Seven patients had mild to moderate COVID-19
symptoms that were managed at home with supportive care. Three patients had severe
symptoms requiring hospitalization and oxygen through nasal cannula and/or combination of
steroids, and convalescent plasma infusion. All patients had full recovery. Eight patients were on
daily prednisone (range 5-20mg/day) when they developed COVID-19 symptoms. Seven patients
were taking hydroxychloroquine prior to COVID-19 and continued it during the infection. Three
patients each were on azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. One patient (Patient 2) had
received rituximab in February 2020 and developed COVID-19 in May 2020. Another patient

(Patient 9) developed COVID-19 while on belimumab. Demographic details of the 119 healthy
controls are shown in Table 2.

We had previously noted that two of the SLE subjects who developed COVID-19 had antiIFNα autoantibodies in 2011(7). Biobanked plasma from healthy controls (n=119) and the ten SLE
subjects were tested for the presence of anti-IFNα autoantibodies. Anti-IFNα autoantibodies were
detected in 4 out of the 10 SLE patients (patients 2, 3, 9, 10) who had developed COVID-19 (40%;
Figure 1A). Plasma samples from six (5 males) out of 119 healthy controls also tested positive
(5%; Table 2). Longitudinal assessments of lupus plasma samples confirmed the presence of
these autoantibodies preceding the infection as far back as 2017 (Figure 1A). Overall, anti-IFNα
autoantibody positivity and levels persisted and were stable over time in SLE.
Patients with anti-IFNα autoantibodies were noted to have higher rates of hospitalization
requiring oxygen (2 out of 4) compared to those without (1 out of 6). Average prednisone dose at
time of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with these autoantibodies was higher (mean:
10.25mg/day, range: 5-20mg/day) compared to patients without them (mean: 3.75mg/day, range:
0-7.5mg/day). Of the two patients (Patient 2 and 9) who had received anti- B-cell therapy in the
prior years, both had persistent anti-IFNα autoantibodies. None of the patients with IFNα
autoantibodies had a history of recurrent or opportunistic infections. These results indicate that
the prevalence of IFNα autoantibodies is higher in those patients with confirmed COVID-19 than
what has been previously reported in SLE(7).
Lupus anti-IFNα autoantibodies block IFNα signaling:
We evaluated if the plasma positive for anti-IFNα autoantibodies could block IFNα
signaling in vitro. Out of the 4 SLE subjects with anti-IFNα autoantibodies, half of the samples ( 2
subjects; patients 3 and 9) blocked rhIFNα induced STAT1 phosphorylation in healthy control
PBMCs at 10% concentration (Figure 1B). These patients had the highest titers of anti-IFNα
autoantibodies. None of the plasma samples from SLE subjects with COVID-19 without the antiIFNα autoantibodies (n=6) or healthy controls who were positive for anti-IFNα autoantibodies
based on the above cut-off (n=6) were able to inhibit STAT1 phosphorylation by rhIFNα. These
results indicate that a significant proportion of anti-IFNα autoantibodies in lupus subjects who
developed confirmed COVID-19 are neutralizing.

Discussion:
In this initial assessment, 40% of SLE patients that developed confirmed COVID-19 were
positive for anti-IFNα IgG autoantibodies in samples obtained prior to infection with SARS-CoV2. In general, positive autoantibodies were present several years before and in some patients
persisted despite B-cell targeted therapy. Previous reports in the same cohort showed that SLE
subjects had an anti-IFNα autoantibody prevalence of 11% (7). Therefore, those SLE patients
that developed confirmed COVID-19 during this initial wave of the pandemic had enrichment in
anti-IFNα autoantibodies. Our observations suggest that the presence of these autoantibodies
may predispose SLE patients to infection with SARS-CoV-2 with a more severe presentation and
represent an additional risk factor in this patient population. Plasma samples with the highest
titers of anti-IFNα autoantibodies inhibited signaling of IFNα in vitro, suggesting that the level or
concentration of these autoantibodies, may affect their blocking ability. A recent report found a
worse outcome in patients with COVID-19 who had anti-IFNα autoantibodies in the general
population and suggested that these antibodies may precede infection based on two prestored
plasma samples(8). Our findings support this hypothesis as SLE patients who developed
confirmed COVID-19, had anti-IFNα IgG autoantibodies detected prior to the infection, suggesting
a potential pathogenic role for these autoantibodies in increasing susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2
infection. In contrast to that report, which showed male predominance of these autoantibodies, all
the SLE subjects were female, likely explained by the enhanced prevalence of lupus in women.
Our study is limited by the small sample size. Whether the presence of autoantibodies
will contribute to modulating the severity and outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in SLE
requires systematic assessment in larger numbers of patients. Additionally, as the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic is ongoing, we did not test SLE patients without confirmed COVID-19 since they may
still become infected in the future and the natural history of these autoantibodies should be further
evaluated in longitudinal studies.
This report highlights the key role that IFNα and autoantibodies against this cytokine may
play in both SARS-CoV-2 infection and in SLE pathogenesis. Anti-IFNα autoantibodies associate
with improved clinical and laboratory parameters and normalization of type I IFN-induced gene
signature in SLE(7). Conversely, presence of these autoantibodies may predispose to COVID-19
by blocking the action of a crucial antiviral cytokine. The presence of anti-IFNα autoantibodies
may prove a helpful prognostic marker to predict which SLE patient may develop COVID-19 and
could inform preventive measures and management of this subset of patients.
