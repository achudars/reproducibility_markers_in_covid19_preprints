Abstract
Importance: Particulate respirators such as N95 masks are an essential component of personal
protective equipment (PPE) for front-line workers. This study describes a rapid and effective UVC
irradiation system that would facilitate the safe re-use of N95 respirators and provides supporting
information for deploying UVC for decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID19
pandemic.
Objective: To assess the inactivation potential of the proposed UVC germicidal device as a
function of time by using 3M® 8211 - N95 particulate respirators inoculated with SARS-CoV-2.
Design: A germicidal UVC device to deliver tailored UVC dose was developed and snippets
(2.5cm2) of the 3M-N95 respirator were inoculated with 106 plaque-forming units (PFU) of SARSCoV-2 and were UV irradiated. Different exposure times were tested (0-164 seconds) by fixing
the distance between the lamp (10 cm) and the mask while providing an exposure of at least 5.43
mWcm-2.
Setting: The current work is broadly applicable for healthcare-settings, particularly during a
pandemic such as COVID-19.
Participants: Not applicable.
Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Primary measure of outcome was titration of infectious virus
recovered from virus-inoculated respirator pieces after UVC exposure. Other measures included
the method validation of the irradiation protocol, using lentiviruses (biosafety level-2 agent) and
establishment of the germicidal UVC exposure protocol.
Results: An average of 4.38x103 PFUml-1(SD 772.68) was recovered from untreated masks while
4.44x102 PFUml-1(SD 203.67), 4.00x102 PFUml-1(SD 115.47), 1.56x102 PFUml-1(SD 76.98) and
4.44x101 PFUml-1(SD 76.98) was recovered in exposures 2s,6s,18s and 54 seconds per side
respectively. The germicidal device output and positioning was monitored and a minimum output
of 5.43 mWcm-2 was maintained. Infectious SARS-CoV-2 was not detected by plaque assays
(minimal level of detection is 67 PFUml-1) on N95 respirator snippets when irradiated for 120s per
side or longer suggesting 3.5 log reduction in 240 seconds of irradiation.

Conclusions and Relevance: A scalable germicidal UVC device to deliver tailored UVC dose
for rapid decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 was developed. UVC germicidal irradiation of N95
snippets inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 for 120s per side resulted in 100% (3.5 log in total)
reduction of virus. These data support the reuse of N95 particle-filtrate apparatus upon irradiation
with UVC and supports use of UVC-based decontamination of SARS-CoV-2 virus during the
COVID19 pandemic.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by the severe-acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This respiratory pathogen belonging to the betacoronavirus group emerged at the end of 2019 in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province,
China1. As of late September 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected around 31million
individuals while accounting for more than 975,000 deaths worldwide2. So far, the United
States of America is one of the hardest hit countries worldwide. The long-term public
health and economic consequences are alarming and are often compared to the
“Spanish-flu” pandemic caused by an influenza virus in 1918 that resulted in more deaths
than there were victims in World War I3.
During pandemic outbreaks, frontline workers and essential workers across a spectrum
of industries including but not limited to medical professionals, scientists, academics as
well as individuals within food and beverage industries are required to carry out pivotal
duties to keep society functioning. Critical measures that are employed to prevent the
spread of the disease include avoiding social interactions through social distancing, and
lockdowns in combination with improved hygiene measures. Additionally, the use of
personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, gloves, sleeves and face-shields
play an essential role in protecting front line workers as well as minimizing the spread of
the respiratory pathogen SARS-CoV-24. SARS-CoV-2 can spread in aerosol droplets that
are formed when an infected person coughs, sneezes or even just speaks. Advanced
facemasks (filtering facepiece respirators; FFR) such as N95, KN95 and N99 are used as
a measure of personal protection when enhanced exposure risk to SARS-CoV-2 is
expected (For instance, when working with patients or within diagnostic and research

laboratories). The unexpected extent of this pandemic resulted in the long-anticipated
shortage of FFR and other facemasks, the need for more PPE supplies across the world
escalated significantly5. Such a situation negatively impacts healthcare settings, putting
frontline workers at a vulnerable position, potentially resulting in a collapse of the
healthcare system. This was further corroborated by the World Health Organization
(WHO) stating that insufficient supply of such PPEs would put essential frontline workers
at the risk of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2, which would further facilitate the spread of
this contagious disease6. As a measure to address this issue, on the 20th of March 2020,
methods to conserve PPE were discussed by panelists from the journal of American
medical association (JAMA) and as a result, the reuse of PPE was suggested7.
Though the reuse of the masks was suggested, there are several factors that one must
take into consideration. Firstly, it is of importance to have a general idea in terms of the
persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces. Several studies have demonstrated that viruses
such as SARS-CoV and its phylogenetic-relatives such as Middle-East Respiratory
Syndrome virus (MERS) and seasonal corona viruses (HCoV) may persist on inanimate
object surfaces including wood8, plastic9, metal, paper and glass up to 9 days8,9. In
contrast, a recent study suggested that SARS-CoV-2 is only able to last in such surfaces
more or less up to 72 hours10. Taking this information into consideration, one of the
solutions that was recommended was to recycle the use of respirators wherein users were
recommended to use one mask per day, ensuring a grace period of five days between
reuse. Given the lack of SARS-CoV-2 viral survivorship data in different surfaces, the
safety and the effectiveness of the above-mentioned suggestion is largely unknown. Due

to the urgency of the situation, a scalable, reliable, cost effective disinfection procedure
that would enable the safe reuse of PPE is of global interest11.
Several methods of decontamination have been proposed in order to facilitate the reuse
of PPEs. These typically branch off from chemical methods (I.e. alcohol, bleach etc.) or
energetic methods such as heat inactivation, microwave-based systems or ultraviolet
(UV) based systems12. In summary, chemical based inactivation methods have indicated
that virus contaminated surfaces can be effectively decontaminated using 70% ethanol,
bleach solutions (0.1% Sodium Hypochlorite) and hydrogen peroxide (0.5% H2O2) with
enough exposure time13. The issues with such methods include inability to scale up to
disinfect a large number of units and the need for specialized faculties with chemical
supplies. Furthermore, several chemical treatment methods have been shown to impair
the functionality of the filters found in the respirators 14. In contrast, energy-based systems
have also been explored for decontaminating PPEs. One category of methods that was
suggested was heat inactivation in which various protocols such as heating to 70°C for
24H or heating for 30 minutes at 56°C depending on the model was implemented

.

The caveat here is that this method is applicable only for a subset of respirators belonging
to the FFP2 category and most manufacturers recommend against heat treatment due to
its deleterious effects on the materials of the respirators which could result in ineffective
protective capacity 14,17.
Another energy-based decontamination method is the use of germicidal UVC (200 – 280
nm) based systems3. UVC based disinfection methods are effective due to the fact that
viral genetic materials such as RNA (relevant in this case given that SARS-CoV-2
genome is an RNA based one) and DNA strongly absorbs UVC radiation 18,19. This results

in damage for such genetic materials at a molecular and structural level (via
photodimerization), severely compromising the functionality of the virus leading to viral
inactivation, consequently prohibiting the capacity for the virus to replicate upon exposure
to compatible hosts20,21. Germicidal properties of UVC on PPE and FFRs such as N95s
have been studied in the context of other respiratory viral pathogens such as influenza A
viruses22,23. In particular, the use of UVC lamps to disinfect FFR has been studied by the
National Occupational Safety and Health and found that FFR retained good filtering and
air flow properties using UVC exposures that would far exceed those used to disinfect
FFR indicating that UVC irradiation methods have the potential to be highly effective,
point-of-use disinfection systems24. UVC radiation is a line of sight disinfection system
and pathogens in the shadows or shielded from the UVC radiation will remain viable. The
system described here is a UVC exposure system using a conveyor belt to transport
contaminated FFRs between a bank of opposing UVC mercury lamps producing intense
254nm UVC radiation. The system developed here uses a vertical mask support system
for UVC irradiation where both the inside and outside surfaces of the mask and straps
can be dosed with UVC radiation simultaneously. The concept is shown schematically
below (Fig. 1A) and a prototype has been built and tested (Fig. 1B). In the prototype,
standard low-pressure Hg lamps were used as the UVC source, but UVC LED could also
be used to the same effect. The system shown in figure 1B can expose contaminated
N95 masks at UVC dose levels up to 1.5 J/cm2 in an exposure time of approximately one
minute. The total dose can be controlled by changing the speed of the conveyor system.
Dose was evaluated using commercially available color changing dosimeter tags,

(Intellego Technologies, Stockholm, Sweden) which can be routinely added to the
conveyor system for frequent verification of UVC dose to the exposed masks.
Here we evaluate the effectiveness of a rapid UVC germicidal disinfection system that
can be scaled up to effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in potentially contaminated
respirators. We demonstrate that with 240s of total exposure, an approximate reduction
of 3.5 logs of SARS-CoV-2 was indicated by the lack of infective viral particles. This
information provides support for use of UVC-based decontamination of SARS-CoV-2
virus during the COVID19 pandemic.

Materials and methods.
UVC Mask Exposure System
A simple UVC mask exposure system was fabricated from two opposing IP55 high power
Hg lamp fixtures (American Ultraviolet) configured vertically and a simple motorized
conveyor system. The prototype system design moves FFR, supported vertically by the
straps, between the two lamps where the dose is controlled by the belt speed of the mask
conveyor system. The concept is shown schematically below (Fig. 1A) and a prototype
was built and its mechanical operation tested (Fig. 1B).
The system shown here can expose contaminated N95 masks at UVC dose levels up to
1.5 J/cm2 in an exposure time of approximately one minute (Figure 1C). The total dose
can be controlled by changing the speed of the conveyor system (Figure 1C). As
configured the unit contains two opposing IP55 lamp fixtures, but two more pairs can be
added to achieve effective irradiation at higher belt speeds for increasing FFR treatment
throughput.

For dose testing with SARS-CoV-2, one lamp was removed from the system (shown in
Figure 1B) and evaluated for germicidal activity in a BSL-3 facility. UVC irradiance was
measured using a calibrated Optometer P 9710 Gigahertz Optik UVC meter with the
254nm detection head that was positioned at a fixed distance approximating the distance
of the FFR from one of UVC lamps as configured in the UVC mask exposure system. The
lamps were allowed to warm up for approximately 2 minutes to achieve stable UVC
output. Due to potential masking effects that may occur in the space between the two
bulbs, the changes due to positioning was assessed using 1 cm increments and
experiments were done in position number 2 (Figure 1D and E).To approximate the
exposure of a contaminated FFR, tests with the single lamp system were made by
exposing experimental mask swatches, first on one side, then the other, as described
below.
Cells and viruses
Vero-E6 cells (ATCC® CRL-1586™, clone E6) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified
Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), penicillinstreptomycin, MEM non-essential amino-acids (Gibco; 25025CL) and Hepes buffer
(Gibco; 15630-080) at 37°C with 5% CO2. Cells were passaged every three days until
required for experimentation. A549 human lung carcinoma cells (ATCC® CCL-185) were
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS;
HyClone SH0066.03) and penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco; 15140-122) at 37oC with 5%
CO2. Infectious assays using 2nd generation lentivirus carrying a constitutive EGFP
transgene (pLV-EGFP, Addgene) were performed in the biosafety-level 2 (BSL2) Stem
Cell Core Facility at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Viral stocks were produced using

human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, with collection and concentration of LVV 48
hours after transfection of 2nd generation plasmid constructs. Infectious assays for this
study using SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/202, bei resource – NR52281) were handled within
a biosafety-level 3 (BSL3) containment facility at Icahn school of medicine at Mount Sinai
by trained personnel upon approval of protocols by a biosafety committee. Propagation
of viral stocks were done in Vero-E6 cell confluent monolayers by using an infection
medium composed of DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, Non-essential amino acids
(NEAA), Hepes and penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 72 hours.
Inactivation of N95 mask squares spiked with Lentivirus
Squares containing all layers of the 3M® 8211 - N95 particulate respirator were cut under
sterile conditions resulting in final dimensions of 25mm x 25mm. N95 mask coupons were
loaded with LVV-EGFP by incubation in a 50ml conical tube containing 30ml Dulbecco’s
Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS) with 2x108 transduction units (TU) of LVV-EGFP.
Virus was allowed to adsorb to the mask coupons for 15 minutes. Coupons were placed
in 10cm petri dishes (2 dishes, each with 4 coupons). One dish with four coupons was
placed, open, under the UVC lamp with aluminum foil under the petri dish to reflect UVC
light. The second dish was covered, wrapped in aluminum foil, and kept in the same
biosafety cabinet without UVC exposure as a control for presence of infectious virus. The
UVC lamp was placed 10 cm above the coupon surface. Coupons were exposed to UVC
light for 1 minute (equivalent of 2 mJcm-2), turned over with sterile forceps, and exposed
to UVC light for 1 additional minute. After UVC treatment, coupons were transferred to
15ml conical tubes and submerged in 5 ml of infection medium (DMEM + 1.5% heat-

inactivated fetal bovine serum). Control and UVC-treated infection media were used
immediately for viral infectivity assays.
Infectivity assays
Efficiency of LVV-EGFP inactivation was tested by serial 10-fold dilutions of infection
medium in the 15 ml conical tubes, followed by inoculation of 100% confluent A549 cell
monolayers in duplicate. Cells were incubated for 48 hours, fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde, treated with 4,6’ diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) nuclear stain for 10
minutes and imaged with a ThermoScientific Cellomics ArrayScan XTI high-content
microscope to visualize infected cells as indicated by GFP. Total cell number was
determined by counting DAPI+ objects and percent-infected determined by DAPI+ nuclei
associated with GFP signal.
Inactivation of N95 mask squares spiked with SARS-CoV-2
Squares containing all layers of the 3M® 8211 - N95 particulate respirator were cut under

with SARS-CoV-2 by incubating them in 50 ml conical bottom tubes containing 30 ml of
DMEM spiked with 1x106 plaque forming units (PFU) SARS-CoV-2. The virus was
allowed to adsorb into the mask coupons for 15 minutes at room temperature. Afterwards,
the coupons were transferred to sterile tissue culture grade 10cm petri-dishes. These
were placed over aluminum foil and under the UVC germicidal lamp after warming up the
lamp. In parallel, a similar setup was conducted in which the spiked dishes were incubated
in a biosafety cabinet without exposing to UV light in order to confirm the presence of
virus in the N95 mask coupons. A working distance of 10cm was maintained between the
lamp and the top of the coupon surface within the petri dish. Following lamp warm-up, the

irradiance was measured at the working distance to be 5-8 mW/cm2 and was measured
using the Optometer P 9710 Gigahertz Optik 254nm UVC meter and the coupons were
exposed for either 2, 6, 18, 54 120, 164 and 420 seconds per side and were flipped using
sterile forceps. The coupons were then transferred to 15 ml conical bottom tubes and
were submerged in 3 ml of infection medium and was vortexed for one minute and were
left overnight at 4°C and were assayed the following day.
Plaque assays
Confluent monolayers of Vero-E6 cells in 12-well plate format were infected with 10-fold
serially diluted samples in 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with bovine
serum albumin (BSA) and penicillin-streptomycin for an hour while gently shaking the
plates every 15 minutes. Afterwards, the inoculum was removed, and the cells were
incubated with an overlay composed of MEM with 2% FBS and 0.05% Oxoid agar for 72
hours at 37°C with 5% CO2. The plates were subsequently fixed using 4% formaldehyde
overnight and the formaldehyde was removed along with the overlay. Fixed monolayers
were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% tween-20 (TBS-T) for an hour.
Afterwards, plates were immunostained using a monoclonal antibody cocktail against
SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Creative-Biolabs; 2BCE5) and SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein
NP (Creative-Biolabs; NP1C7C7) at a dilution of 1:1000 followed by 1:5000 anti-mouse
IgG monoclonal antibody and was developed using KPL TrueBlue peroxidase substrate
for 10 minutes (Seracare; 5510-0030). After washing the plates with distilled water, the
number of plaques were counted. Data shown here is derived from three independent
experimental setups.

Results.
Inactivation of N95 mask squares spiked with LV-EGFP
Supernatants derived from untreated mask snippets were used to infect A549 cells and
a total of 36001 cells were analyzed. A total of 2.57% cells (approximately 925 cells)
were GFP positive because of LV-EGFP infection and constituted around 1155 viral
transduction units per ml of analyzed supernatant (Figure 2A). Supernatants derived from
snippets treated for 60 seconds each side showed only around 0.08% GFP positive cells
(approximately 27 cells out of a total of 33908) accounting for 34 viral transductions per
ml (Figure 2B).

Total inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in spiked N95 apparatuses by 120 seconds of
exposure per side.
The warmed up UVC device was able to neutralize approximately 1 log viral titer with as
little as 2 seconds of exposure per side (Figure 2A). Further reduction of approximately 2
logs was observed by an exposure of 54 seconds and by 120 seconds (per side). Total
inactivation was apparent by the lack of plaque forming units (PFU) derived from the
respective experimental settings. This was achieved by using an irradiance of at least
5.43 mW/cm2. Figure 3 demonstrates exponential decay (r2=99; p<0.001) in PFUs and
fraction of active virus remaining as function of both exposure times and dose. While we
observed a significant reduction by 54 seconds of exposure per-side, we were unable to
replicate it in one of the three independent experiments.

Discussion
COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has negatively impacted the entire world,
affecting all industries across multiple disciplines. All essential workers, particularly
healthcare workers, extensively rely on FFRs such as N95 respirators in order to minimize
the risk of contraction and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Given the rapidly expanding
nature and this biologically hazardous agent, a high use and demand for such respirators
is evident25. Owing to those reasons, such respirators are at the risk of running into a
considerable shortage, suggesting the need for safe reuse. Based on the limited number
of SARS-CoV-2 virus survivorship data coupled with the need to preserve FFRs, the
government of the USA recommended the use of one respirator per day, cycling them
throughout the week ensuring a minimum of five days between reuse26. The risk
associated with this due to the largely unknown virus survivorship data urges the need
for not only more survivorship studies, but also studies that would explore the effective
decontamination of facepieces. This has encouraged researchers to evaluate several
potential methods for the decontamination of FFRs. Thus, chemical-based methods
including the use of alcohol, bleach, ethylene oxide, ozone decontamination and H2O2
based methods have developed to effectively decontaminate respirators12,14,17,18,22. On
the other hand, the use of energy-based systems such as dry heat, microwave, gammaradiation and ultraviolet based germicidal systems have also been tested. However, there
are two important factors to consider in such instances; 1) any disinfection method used
should guarantee the complete inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and 2) treatment of choice
should not have deleterious effects that may impair the functionality of the respirator7.

Consequently, scientists, manufacturers and professionals in the medical field are
working towards devising a strategy that would address the aforementioned factors.
Amongst the methods of decontamination, ultraviolet C germicidal irradiation (UVGI) has
a lengthy history of antimicrobial applications in healthcare and medical based settings27.
Due to its scalable ease, UVC based decontamination methods are favorable during a
pandemic setting such as the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and can be deployed more
generally, for example to decontaminate public spaces. Here, we evaluated a germicidal
UVC irradiation system as a potential tool to decontaminate respirators with the aim of
assisting the safe reuse of them.
We first characterized the device by obtaining the dose response parameters as well as
identifying the importance of the positioning of the masks which are to be sterilized in
order to obtain the most efficient decontamination setting (Figure 1C, D and E).The
prototype derivative we had was first used to test the germicidal potential, using a lipid
enveloped 2nd generation Lentivirus as a model virus under biosafety level 2 containment.
The data suggested robust reduction of lentivirus from the supernatants that were infused
with the N95 snippets upon UVC treatment for a total 120 seconds (Figure 2). By taking
the above data into consideration, we then evaluated a time and dose dependent UVC
irradiation protocol for the decontamination of N95 mask snippets spiked with live SARSCoV-2 under BSL3 conditions. Of note, two seconds per side of irradiation (4 seconds
total exposure time) indicated the reduction of approximately 1 log of viral titer with a
minimal irradiance of 5.43 mW/cm2. While we were able to see an approximate 2.5 log
reduction of mask snippets treated for a total of 108 seconds (54 s per side) in two out of
three independent experiments, we were able to see the reduction of approximately 3.5

log viral reduction by 240 seconds of total UVC irradiation in all experimental replicates.
An important note to highlight here is that we used a functional assay such as plaque
assay to test the inactivation as opposed to utilizing a technique such as qPCR. Molecular
techniques as such may not truly reflect the degree of inactivation given that the presence
of nucleic acids such as RNA is not indicative of live virus.
Although we spiked the snippets with 106 PFU of SARS-CoV-2, we were only able to
retrieve an average viral titer of 4.3x103 PFU. This can be accounted to the fact that the
spiked snippets were suspended in a larger volume of 15 ml after spiking. Our study was
able to demonstrate a 3.5 viral log reduction by 240s of irradiation, yet it is currently
unknown as to the amount of viruses that may be present in FFRs derived from real-life
settings such as clinics and high biosafety level laboratories. Albeit the promising data in
the current study, several limitations warrants further investigation in this matter. For
instance, N95 manufacturers such as 3M do not recommend the decontamination as well
as the reuse of FFRs. This probably has been suggested based on a study conducted by
3M in which respirators were exposed to cumulative dose of 10 Jcm-2 between five to 10
cycles resulting in changes in mask fit and physical characteristics28. This is indicative of
the fact that FFRs are only able to withstand a certain amount of decontamination cycles
before the performance is compromised. Furthermore, studies have suggested that
repetitive donning and removal FFRs result in impaired mask fit29, indicating that such
respirators can only be reused a very small amount of time regardless of the
decontamination efficiency. While there are no strict guides explaining the possible
number of reuses for FFRs, the CDC recommends no more than 5 reuses based on two
studies 29-31. Therefore, a non-deleterious germicidal protocol can be implemented for the

decontamination of FFRs to support the safe reuse for a limited number of times. Other
studies have demonstrated the effects on the materials and fit upon UV-C irradiation using
doses 1-1.2 Jm-2. It was noted that there was no significant damage to the respirators,
compromising the performance. However, some impact on fit due to strap degradation
was noted after an unspecified number of cycles and was not quantitatively addressed
14,17,19,24

. Furthermore, a variety of N95 FFRs in the range considered here (1-1.2 J/cm2)

were tested for performance post treatment and found no significant respiratory filter
material damage, impact on filtration performance. The proposed device in the current
study will be operating below these dosages and exposure ranges.
The current COVID-19 pandemic has presented a multitude of challenges in healthcare
settings and the seemingly apparent shortage of the PPE such as FFRs is currently an
issue as such. This study evaluated UV-C based germicidal decontamination protocol
which has the potential to inactivate 3.5 log SARS-CoV-2 within a total time frame of 240s,
facilitating a potential avenue for the safe reuse of the FFRs.
