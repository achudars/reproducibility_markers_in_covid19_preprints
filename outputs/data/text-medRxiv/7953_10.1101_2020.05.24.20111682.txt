Abstract
Serological assays for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are now of critical importance to support
diagnosis, guide epidemiological intervention, and understand immune response to natural infection
and vaccine administration. We developed and validated new anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM and IgA
ELISA tests (ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 ELISA, DIESSE Diagnostica Senese S.p.a.) based on
whole-virus antigens. We used a total of 553 serum samples including samples from COVID-19
suspected and confirmed cases, healthy donors, and patients positive for other infections or
autoimmune conditions. Overall, the assays showed good concordance with the indirect
immunofluorescence reference test in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Especially for IgG and
IgA, we observed high sensitivity (92.5 and 93.6%, respectively); specificity was high (>96%) for
all antibody types ELISAs. In addition, sensitivity was linked to the days from symptoms onset

Introduction
The frontline diagnostic response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is represented by RT-PCR test
performed on nasopharyngeal swabs or other upper respiratory tract specimens (1). In this phase of
COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, there is a growing interest in antibody testing to
determine the immune status against SARS-CoV-2 in convalescent and suspected cases as well as
in the general population. In fact, serological investigation is crucial to better understand the host
response to the virus, support diagnosis and help provide epidemiological estimates of virus spread
(2, 3). Several serological assays are now becoming available and dozens of tests, including rapid
tests, with variable degree of sensitivity and specificity are already on the market (4). To identify
reliable laboratory diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2, validation on patient samples is necessary. Most
of the available tests detect specific IgM and IgG, while IgA response is rarely considered, although
representing the mucosal immunity (i.e. respiratory compartments) protecting the main sites of
entry and replication for SARS-CoV-2 (1).
Here, we report the results of a study aimed at establishing the performances of a set of new
commercial immunoenzymatic assays (ELISA) detecting specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG and
IgA antibodies. The work was carried out in the framework of a scientific collaboration established
between DIESSE Diagnostica Senese S.p.A. (Siena) and the National Institute for Infectious
Diseases (INMI) "L. Spallanzani” IRCCS.
Methods
The ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG and IgA tests have been developed by DIESSE
Diagnostica Senese S.p.A. and CE marked. These are based on the native antigen obtained from
Vero E6 cells infected with the SARS-CoV-2, strain “2019-nCoV/Italy-INMI1” (EVAg Ref-SKU:
008V-03893).
A total of 553 anonymized serum samples were used to assess the performance of the ENZYWELL tests. Of these, 115 were residual serum samples from 104 suspected and confirmed cases

for SARS-CoV-2 infection, collected between February and April 2020, and previously evaluated
with the reference in-house test established at the Laboratory of Virology at INMI, based on indirect
immunofluorescence assay (IFA) detecting IgG, IgM and IgA. Fifty of these samples were patients
with confirmed diagnosis by molecular testing. The anti-SARS-Cov-2 IFA results were as follows:
IgA (64/110 positive), IgM (69/115 positive) and IgG (71/115 positive). Three hundred fifty three
serum samples were retrieved from a retrospective collection of samples from healthy individuals
collected in the pre-pandemic time (2016, 2017, and January 2019) and assumed to be SARS-CoV2 negative. A group of 21 samples from patients who had been diagnosed with seasonal human
coronaviruses (HKU, NL63, 229E), and 64 found positive for other infections (i.e. Mycoplasma,
Cytomegalovirus, Adenovirus, Respiratory Syncitial virus, Influenza A, Influenza B, SARS-CoV)
or interfering factors (i.e. as anti-nuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor) was included in the
analysis, to estimate cross-reactivity.
ELISA tests were performed on 1:100 serum duplicate dilution. For IgM ELISA, samples were
treated with sorbent for IgG depletion. Serum dilutions were added to microwells coated with the
whole-virus crude extract and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Then, microwells were
washed and and anti-human IgG, IgM and IgA monoclonal antibodies, labeled with peroxidase, in
phosphate buffer containing phenol 0.05% and Bronidox 0.02%, were added to the microwells (100
μL/well) and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. After a second washing step, TMB
substrate (100 μL/well) incubation was performed for 15 minutes, followed by addition of stop
solution (100 μL/well). Optical density (OD) was read within 30 minutes at 450 nm with 620 nm
subtraction, using Synergy™ HTX Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments, USA).
Internal quality controls were included in each run: one positive control containing anti-SARSCoV-2 antibodies; one negative control not containing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; a cut-off (CO)
control with a known concentration of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The latter is used to calculate
the Index value (ratio between the OD of the target sample and the CO) of the samples under
evaluation. A blank control was also included in each run and values <0.150 contribute in

confirming the quality of the test and procedures. Samples were considered positive when the Index
is ≥1.0.
IFA, used as reference test, was performed using slides prepared in-house with Vero E6 cells
infected with SARS-CoV-2 isolate (2019-nCoV/Italy-INMI1), as described elsewhere (5). Serum
samples were tested for specific IgM, IgA and IgG using 1:20 screening dilution. FITC-conjugated
anti-human IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies (Euroimmun, Germany) were used as secondary antibody
and Evans Blue as cell counterstain. Antibody titres were obtained with titration by limiting dilution
and expressed as the highest serum dilution presenting fluorescent antibody staining.
The diagnostic performance of ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 ELISAs was calculated measuring
sensitivity and specificity on the panel of serum samples above described. Concordance, k
coefficient and Spearman correlation antibody levels amongst IFA and ENZY-WELL assays were
calculated with respect to IFA. The statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
version 7.00 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California).
The study was approved from the INMI Ethical Board. Informed consent was not required as
human samples used for this work were residual samples from routine diagnostic activities, patients'
data remained anonymous, and the results obtained with the new tests were not used for the clinical
management of the patient.
Results
On the samples from suspect and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection cases, ENZY-WELL SARSCoV-2 IgG and IgA kits showed a good sensitivity (92.5 and 93.6%, respectively) and specificity
(91.7% and 97.9%, respectively) as compared to the reference IFA test; on the contrary, IgM test
showed lower sensitivity and specificity (87.7% and 88.0%, respectively, Table 1). On the whole,
the agreement with IFA was excellent for IgG and IgA ENZY-WELL tests (92.7% and 95.4%
concordance, respectively; k coefficient =0.84 and 0.9), while the agreement for IgM was lower,
although still good (87.8% concordance and k coefficient =0.76).

obtained from IFA are expressed as the highest serum dilution presenting fluorescence; levels obtained from
ENZY-WELL ELISAs are expressed as Index value (ratio between the OD of the target sample and the CO).
Sample is considered positive when the Index is ≥ 1.0. Horizontal dashed-line represents the limits of
detection of IFA (1:20 dilution), vertical line represents the cut-off of positivity for ENZY-WELL ELISAs
(Index =1.0). p-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

The diagnostic specificity was also calculated by adding to the 115 samples tested by IFA, the 353
samples collected from healthy donors in the pre-pandemic period. Results of the analysis showed
an increase of specificity for IgG (96.3%, CI 95%, 94.0-97.8) and IgM (96.9%, CI 95%, 94.5-98.4),
while similar data were obtained for IgA (96.3%, CI 95%, 93.9-97.7).
The analysis of the results on 29 samples from COVID-19 patients with known date of symptoms
onset (DSO), ranging from 2 to 37 days, showed that the sensitivity of the ENZY-WELL SARSCoV-2 ELISAs increased after 10 DSO. In detail, 100% sensitivity was reached after 10 and 12
DSO for IgG and IgA, respectively; for IgM, 87.5% was achieved after 12 DSO (Table 2).

Discussion
In the present study, we report the first validation study of the new commercial whole-virus based
ELISAs (ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2) detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG and IgA.
Overall, diagnostic sensitivity of ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 ELISAs resulted higher for IgG
(92.5%) and IgA (93.6%) than IgM (87.7%). Similar results were observed for concordance with
IFA, with and excellent agreement for IgG and IgA (0.84 and 0.90, respectively). These results are

in line with other reports and support the inclusion of IgA in the panel of antibody testing (6, 7, 8),
also considering that this antibody class may be pathologically relevant for respiratory infections
(9). Specificity was similar for all ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 ELISAs (IgG: 96.3%; IgM: 96.9%;
and IgA: 96.3%). These tests showed a moderate cross-reactivity to other infectious and autoimmunity factors, which has to be taken into account for the interpretation of results. The main
evidence of non-specific reactivity was observed in sera from SARS-CoV cases and for IgM ELISA
(3). IgA ELISA showed the lowest number of non-specific reactions both to the tested infectious
and non-infectious interfering factors.
Differently from other serological tests based on specific viral antigens (such as N or S proteins),
these assays are based on crude extract from SARS-CoV-2 whole-virus which can increase the
possibility of antibodies detection, especially when the antigenic determinants for anti-SARS-CoV2 humoral response need to be fully identified. On the other hand, it could affect the specificity, an
aspect that need to be evaluated in comparison with single antigen-based tests.
As shown in previous reports, sensitivity is linked to the DSO due to the seroconversion window. In
fact, sensitivity of ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA ELISAs resulted 100% in those
samples collected after 10 and 12 DSO, respectively, while 88.5% of sensitivity was obtained for
IgM after 12 days (3, 7).
In the present study, the ELISAs were performed in manual mode; however, the tests can be totally
automatized and carried out from primary samples collection tube in combination with automated
ELISA analyzer with Laboratory Information System (LIS). This solution represents a great
advantage reducing laboratory turnover, especially when high loads of samples need to be tested,
and avoiding operator errors in ELISA procedures.
Laboratory testing plays the major role in identification and monitoring of infected persons,
enabling isolation of infected patients and interruption of the chain of transmission. Nucleic acid
detection remains the gold standard for identification of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection as the
detection of viral RNA in the nasopharyngeal swab or other respiratory specimens is linked to viral

shedding and potential for SARS-CoV-2 transmission (1,4). Serological testing can support
diagnosis and outbreak monitoring, and it can help in understanding immune profiles with
implications for epidemiological and public health measures, serologic therapy and vaccine (1,2).
Therefore, validating new serological methods and determining their performance and potential for
cross-reactivity is essential to address the use and ensure proper and reliable diagnosis, clinical and
epidemiological. The ENZY-WELL SARS-CoV-2 ELISAs here described may represent a valid
option for antibody detection and support its use for both diagnostic and epidemiological purposes,
covering all different antibody types developed in SARS-CoV-2 immune response.
