ABSTRACT
Background: Syndromic surveillance through web or phone-based polling has been used to
track the course of infectious diseases worldwide. Our study objective was to describe the
characteristics, symptoms, and self-reported testing rates of respondents in three different
COVID-19 symptom surveys in Canada.
Methods: Data sources consisted of two distinct Canada-wide web-based surveys, and phone
polling in Ontario. All three sources contained self-reported information on COVID-19 symptoms
and testing. In addition to describing respondent characteristics, we examined symptom
frequency and the testing rate among the symptomatic, as well as rates of symptoms and
testing across respondent groups.
Results: We found that 1.6% of respondents experienced a symptom on the day of their
survey, 15% of Ontario households had a symptom in the previous week, and 44% of Canadawide respondents had a symptom in the previous month over March-April 2020. Across the
three surveys, SARS-CoV-2-testing was reported in 2-9% of symptomatic responses. Women,
younger and middle-aged adults (versus older adults) and Indigenous/First nations/Inuit/Métis
were more likely to report at least one symptom, and visible minorities were more likely to report
the combination of fever with cough or shortness of breath.
Interpretation: The low rate of testing among those reporting symptoms suggests significant
opportunity to expand testing among community-dwelling residents of Canada. Syndromic
surveillance data can supplement public health reports and provide much-needed context to
gauge the adequacy of current SARS-CoV-2 testing rates.

BACKGROUND
While SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread globally, ascertaining its true incidence remains
a challenge.1,2 This is because a large proportion of those infected (20-75%) are
minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic.3,4 Further, in many regions only those with
severe illness or identified as a priority group are tested, and thus eligible for laboratory
test-based confirmation.5 Until a rapid test is widely available or barriers to diagnostic
testing in Canada are lowered, there will be a reliance on symptoms for early detection.1
Yet, the range of presenting symptoms is broad, including generally common
complaints (headache, fatigue) and more specific symptoms such as loss of smell or
new onset chilblains.6-9
Syndromic surveillance is a public health tool that has been used extensively to identify
the beginning of seasonal influenza outbreaks in the United States10-12 and Canada,
and for other viral and bacterial diseases globally.13 Where testing is incomplete, selfreported symptoms data is used to supplement confirmed case counts and estimate the
true extent of disease.1 The value of syndromic surveillance is higher when syndromes
are illness-specific. However, because of the broad range of symptomatic presentations
observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, a highly specific definition is likely to lack
sensitivity and miss most people who would be eligible for testing.7 Whereas grouping
symptoms into clinical syndromes is likely to increase specificity, looking at the
occurrence of any described symptom is the most sensitive way to measure all those
who would be eligible for COVID-19 testing.
In Canada, phone and internet methods have been used to collect symptomatic and
testing information from voluntary public participants. The primary objective of this study

was to describe the characteristics, symptoms, and self-reported testing rates of
respondents across three different COVID-19 symptom and testing surveys. The one
phone and two internet-based polls we studied covered varied population subsets,
timeframes, and scope.
METHODS
We retrospectively analyzed existing phone and internet survey data. This study was
approved by the Ethics Review Board of University Health Network.
Data Sources: Three data sources were used for this study.
The Angus Reid Institute COVID-19 symptom poll was administered online from April 16, 2020 to a randomly selected sample of Angus Reid Forum panel members (over
50,000 Canadian residents).14 Respondents were asked about symptoms during the
previous month, and about SARS-CoV-2 testing. Respondents were not asked about
test results.
COVID Near You (covidnearyou.org) is a web-based participatory health surveillance
tool created by infectious disease epidemiologists at Boston Children’s Hospital.15 This
team also created Flu Near You (flunearyou.org), a similar tool for influenza symptoms,
which has been validated against clinical data sources and applied to predict influenza
trends.10-12 Between the Canadian launch on April 3rd and April 26th, there were over
420,000 responses. For individuals opting to include their phone number to be
contacted for follow-up surveys (12% of responses) subsequent responses with the
same age/sex/phone number were excluded (N=3,511). Respondents were asked to
report on present symptoms, and related healthcare encounters, testing, and results.

The Forum & Mainstreet Research poll on COVID-19 symptoms was administered by
telephone and SMS (text) message to randomly selected households in Ontario in two
waves: April 11-12 and April 18-19, 2020.16,17 Datasets from both survey waves were
combined; only the first survey was used for households that appeared in both waves
(N=158). Respondents were asked to report on new symptoms in the household over
the previous week, about testing since the onset of symptoms, and test results.
Measures: Symptoms of possible COVID-19 were defined as inclusive of any of the
following, where information was consistently available (>50% of sample was exposed
to the question): fever, fatigue, runny nose, cough, aches and pains, chills/night sweats,
sore throat, diarrhea, headache, shortness of breath, nausea, and loss of taste or smell.
We excluded sneezing and rash as these are not described symptoms of COVID-19.
We also reported on the self-reported combination of fever with either cough or
shortness of breath, a COVID-like illness definition used by the World Health
Organization.18 Where possible, demographic variables were categorized to facilitate
qualitative comparison between surveys,.
Analysis: Due to considerable methodological differences across sources, results were
analyzed separately. Where survey weights were included in sources (Angus Reid and
Forum polls), we reported unweighted counts and weighted frequencies. As the COVID
Near You team does not derive or use survey weights, we report unweighted counts
and frequencies for results from this source. For Canada-wide data reported at the
individual-level (Angus Reid Institute and COVID Near You surveys), we further report
the frequency of any symptom, the syndrome of fever with cough or shortness of
breath,18 and testing across demographic groups. Testing for differences was done

RESULTS
Angus Reid Poll- Canada-wide, April 1-6, 2020.
There were 4,240 respondents, their median age was 46.5 years (IQR 33-61), 52.0%
(n=2,152) were women, nearly half had completed some college or university (46.8%,
n=2,023), and 13.1% (n=529) reported being a visible minority (Table 1). Completed
testing was reported by 1.3% (n=53), while 2.1% (n=93) were not able to get tested, and
30.7% (n=1,338) completed a COVID-19 self-assessment through a government
website or app.
Over the previous month n=1,863 (43.4%) reported at least one symptom. The most
common symptoms were sore throat (n=1229, 28.6%) and cough (n=1154, 27.0%). The
combination of fever with either cough or shortness of breath was reported by 6.9% of
respondents (n=295). Among those reporting any symptom, 2.6% (n=46) reported
having received testing. Among those reporting fever with either cough or shortness of
breath, 5.7% (n=15) reported having received COVID-19 testing.
More women than men reported at least one symptom (45.3% vs 41.2%, p=0.01, Table
2). Among both men and women, older persons were less likely to report at least one
symptom (p<0.0001) and the combination of fever with either cough or shortness of
breath (p=0.04 among women, p=0.003 among men). Indigenous/First

Nations/Inuit/Metis had significantly higher rates of symptoms (49.3% vs 42.9%, p=0.04)
and testing (3.7% vs 1.1%, p=0.0004) than those not reporting this background. This
group (11.0% vs 6.5%, p=0.005) and visible minorities (10.3% vs 6.3%, p=0.001) also
reported a higher rate of fever with cough or shortness of breath.

After excluding duplicates, there were 409,207 responses. The median age was 42
years (IQR 33-54) and 58.0% (n=237,150) were women (Table 1). Testing was reported
in 0.2% (n= 612) of responses, and 0.4% (n=1,479) reported seeing a health
professional. Positive test results were reported in 0.03% (n=105); some 0.1% (n=213)
reported that they were still waiting for their result. Among all respondents, 0.1%
(n=313) reported travel outside Canada in the previous two weeks and 0.1% (n=324)
reported contact with a known case of COVID-19.
The overall prevalence of symptoms was 1.6% (n=6,746) and the most common
symptoms were fatigue (n=3,982, 1.0%), cough (n=3,416, 0.8%) and headaches
(n=3,406, 0.8%). The combination of fever with either cough or shortness of breath was
reported by 0.2% of respondents (n=758). Among those reporting any symptom, 8.9%
(n=598) reported being tested. Among those reporting fever with cough or shortness of
breath, 21.0% (n=159) reported being tested. Of the symptomatic who were tested,
17.2% (n=103) reported a positive result.
More women than men reported at least one symptom (2.0% vs 1.2%, p<0.001, Table

middle-aged groups were more likely to report symptoms than older groups (p<0.001).
Among men, those over age 75 were more likely to have been tested (p=0.003). The
rate of symptoms varied significantly across provinces – reporting at least one symptom
was most common in British Columbia (2.1%) and Ontario (2.0%, p<0.001), yet reported
testing rates were the highest in Nova Scotia (0.4%) and Saskatchewan (0.3%,
p<0.001).

There were 9,147 unique households surveyed, and 41.7% (n=4,165) consisted of at
least 3 residents (Table 1). The survey respondents were more often women (53.3%,
n=4,931) than men. Completed testing was reported by 3.2% of all households (n=299),
and positive test results by 0.4% (n=43). In addition, 0.5% (n=50) were still awaiting test
results.
The overall prevalence of any new symptom in the previous week was 14.9% (n=1,385).
The most common symptoms reported were headache (n=662, 7.0%), sore throat
(n=377, 3.9%) and diarrhea (N=345, 3.8%). The combination of fever with either cough
or shortness of breath within the same household was reported by 0.8% (n=82). Among
those with any symptom, 6.5% (n=94) reported that a household member had been
tested. Among those with fever and either cough or shortness of breath, 37.5% (n=31)
reported that a household member had been tested. Positive test results were reported
for 26.5% (n=25) of all symptomatic households tested.

DISCUSSION
In this study of syndromic surveillance data from three different survey sources, we find
that described symptoms of COVID-19 are commonly reported by Canadian
respondents. Specifically, 1.6% of respondents reported a symptom on the day of
response, 15% of Ontario households had a new symptom in the previous week, and
43% of Canada-wide respondents had a symptom during March-early April 2020.
Across the three studies, SARS-CoV-2-testing was reported in 2-9% of symptomatic
responses, with a positive test rate among the symptomatic who were tested of 17% in
COVID Near You and 27% in the Forum Research poll. The three survey sources
differed in geography (one covered only Ontario), time period (March to end of April
2020), and their representativeness across different demographic variables. Yet, after
considering differences in the time window addressed with survey questions (present
day, past week, past month), results were mostly consistent.
In two different polls, women were more likely to report at least one symptom. In one
poll, women were more likely to report testing. In Ontario, more women than men have
been tested for SARS-CoV-2, yet men were more likely to have a positive test result.19
Although the higher testing rate among women could reflect their greater presence in
the healthcare sector, our findings also raise the possibility that women are more likely
to report COVID-19-like symptoms. We further found that older groups of both genders
were less likely to report at least one symptom. We found that Indigenous/First
Nations/Inuit/Metis individuals reported a higher rate of symptoms and testing, and that
visible minorities reported higher rates of fever with cough or shortness of breath.
Residents of Indigenous communities are a priority group for SARS-CoV-2 testing.5

Notably, we did not identify significant differences in the frequency of possible COVID19 symptoms across income or education groups. A recent report from the province of
Ontario also did not identify a consistent difference in testing rates across
socioeconomic groups, although neighborhoods with higher ethnic concentration had a
significantly higher rate of test positivity.20
An important consideration in interpreting our findings is that many people with reported
symptoms will not have COVID-19; conditions ranging from stress-related headaches
and allergies to undiagnosed malignancies could also cause these same symptoms.
Conversely, an estimated 20-75% of COVID-19 infected individuals are asymptomatic
or minimally symptomatic.3,4,21,22 Using a only a more restrictive symptomatic definition
such as fever with either cough or shortness of breath would miss many potential cases.
Similarly, a recently developed algorithm that combines loss of smell or taste, fatigue,
skipped meals, and cough, was only 65% sensitive for a positive test result.7 To better
understand current testing rates, we opted to use a broad symptom definition. This
definition essentially includes anyone who would be eligible for testing on the basis of
symptoms. To facilitate comparison, we also reported the proportion with fever and
either cough or shortness of breath, a syndromic definition used by the World Health
Organization.18 The weekly rate of household-level combination of fever with cough or
shortness of breath in this study (Forum Research poll of Ontario in mid-April: 0.8%)
was comparable to that obtained by the Public Health Agency of Canada’s FluWatchers
for the combination of cough and fever in early April 2020 (0.5%).23
There have been no previous reports of COVID-19 symptoms among the broader
Canadian population published in the peer-reviewed literature. Our study provides

essential information the prevalence of such symptoms, and the proportion of
symptomatic persons being tested. Major strengths of this study are its inclusion of selfreported data from three distinct sources, covering March-April 2020. The consistency
of our findings with published public health data suggests it is representative of the
general population. Finally, the information we provide allows for a more complete
picture of COVID-19 in Canada than just that which manifests through healthcare
encounters. Lower barriers to diagnostic testing are essential given the growing
understanding that COVID-19 can present with myriad symptoms. This will be helpful in
identifying and isolating cases and preventing outbreaks as public health measures are
lifted.
Our study also has several limitations. The variable time frames used in the three data
sources complicate cross-study comparison, and longer time periods of self-report (e.g.
“in the past month”) may lead to higher levels of recall bias than shorter time periods.
Similarly, household-level reporting does not easily compare to individual report, and
combining symptoms experienced within a household may erroneously attribute all
those symptoms to the same individual- these are important caveats. Furthermore,
survey questions varied in terms of symptoms covered and inclusion of questions
relating to healthcare encounters or testing results. Sample sizes were also quite small
within subgroups, particularly when looking at those that reported testing or testing
positive. Although the Angus Reid and Forum Research polls had a random sampling
strategy, respondents on COVID Near You were self-selected, and so it was important
to compare their characteristics, symptom reports, and testing rates to those obtained in
the other two studies. Finally, despite their overall higher risk for COVID-19, those

residing in long-term care and other institutional settings are likely not represented in
these data sources which focus on community-dwelling residents of Canada.
This study contributes essential data on the prevalence of COVID-19-related symptoms
in Canada, and the proportion of symptomatic persons being tested. This information
complements public health-reported data on testing numbers and confirmed cases in
Canada. We find that across three unique symptom surveys, less than 10% of those
with symptoms reported having been tested for SARS-CoV-2 in March-April 2020. Our
findings highlight the significant room to expand testing among community-dwelling
residents of Canada. We have also identified groups with higher symptom prevalence
(women, younger age groups, Indigenous/First Nations/Inuit/Métis)- information which
can be used to refine testing strategies and outreach. Syndromic surveillance data such
as these can supplement public health reports and provide much-needed context to
gauge the adequacy of current SARS-CoV-2 testing rates.
