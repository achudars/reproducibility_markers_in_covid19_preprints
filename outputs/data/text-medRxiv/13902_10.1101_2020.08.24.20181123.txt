Abstract:
The COVID-19 pandemic and its social and economic consequences have had adverse impacts on physical
and mental health worldwide and exposed all segments of the population to protracted uncertainty and daily
disruptions. The CoRonavIruS health and Impact Survey (CRISIS) was developed for use as an easy to
implement and robust questionnaire covering key domains relevant to mental distress and resilience during the
pandemic. In the current work, we demonstrate the feasibility, psychometric structure and construct validity of
this survey. We then show that pre-existing mood states, perceived COVID risk, and lifestyle changes are
strongly associated with negative mood states during the pandemic in population samples of adults and in
parents reporting on their children in the US and UK. Ongoing studies using CRISIS include international
studies of COVID-related ill health conducted during different phases of the pandemic and follow-up studies of
cohorts characterized before the COVID pandemic.

Introduction
Since its first documented occurrence in December 2019, COVID-19 has taken an enormous toll on human life
and health and is in line to become the leading cause of death in many countries, including the US. Along with
the immediate health impacts, the virus and prevention strategies have perturbed the core structure of daily
life, including financial security, work, school, recreation, and social interactions. The COVID-19 pandemic
stands in stark contrast to recent epidemics such as SARS and MERS in terms of the total number of cases
and deaths​1​. Prior mass disasters (World Trade Center attacks, mass shootings), natural disasters (hurricanes,
floods) and environmental exposures (oil spills, radiation exposures) have been associated with increases in
depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance use, generalized anxiety disorder and a range of
other mental health outcomes.​2–6 These studies were conducted primarily in the aftermath of these
catastrophes. Much less is known about the risk and protective factors for well-being during and after
prolonged threats​3​, like the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to unfold.
The pernicious mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may result from death of loved ones, disease
severity, social isolation and quarantine, unemployment, financial hardship, domestic violence, and educational
disruptions. Each of these factors is independently associated with psychological comorbidities.​7–13 Apart from
studies of the neuropsychiatric impact of COVID-19 on health care workers and people who contracted the
virus,​9,14,15 there are a growing number of international longitudinal surveys designed to document
community-level pandemic-related psychological distress. Many of these surveys have been adapted to
encompass a wider range of mental health outcomes than measured in previous epidemics​4​, with the most
common domains including stress, anxiety, loneliness, depression, social support, media and technology use,
sleep, and post-traumatic stress. Most of these surveys included established symptom scales, such as the
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and UCLA Loneliness
Scale,​14,16,17 as documented by the COVID-MINDS network of longitudinal studies on the global mental health
impact of COVID-19 ). Published findings from these studies have shown high levels of anxiety and depression
symptoms post COVID-19 based on cut-points from US and European sources. However, the most robust risk
factors for disaster-related mental ill health – prior psychopathology and exposure severity​2,6 – remain largely
understudied to date. With some exceptions​18–24 few of the COVID-19 specific assessment tools developed to
track mental health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have been psychometrically validated.
Aligning with NIH COVID-19 research priorities,​25,26 the Coronavirus Health and Impact Survey (​CRISIS)
Initiative was established as a collaborative and multidisciplinary effort to identify predictors of acute and
long-term psychopathology. Key predictors include impairment and disability associated with the COVID-19
pandemic in samples that were well-characterized prior to the pandemic across the globe. The first step was to
develop, pilot, and test the psychometric properties of a comprehensive instrument that captured a core set of
domains. Specifically, the CRISIS instrument was designed to assess pertinent mental, behavioral, and
physical health domains that capture the multi-level emotional and behavioral impact of the pandemic, as well
as a range of pandemic-related and pre-existing risk and protective factors. The CRISIS includes forms for
adults ages 19-64, parent reports for children aged 9-18, and youth aged 9-18. The following domains are
assessed: (1) background and demographic characteristics, including household composition and crowding;
(2) physical and mental health 3 months prior to the pandemic; (3) COVID-19 exposure and infection status;

(4) life changes due to the pandemic; (5) concerns and worries associated with COVID-19; (6) current
well-being determined by the circumplex model of affect;​27,28 and (7) behavioral factors, such as media use,
sleep, physical activity, and substance use. We also developed a short form of the CRISIS for follow up of the
samples that excludes the background and the 3-months prior physical and mental health sections. Both the
baseline and follow up surveys are licensed on Creative Commons (CC) BY4.0 and are available for download

This article describes the properties of the CRISIS in relatively large (n = 5,646) pilot samples of adults and
parents in the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) collected in April 2020. Across the multiple
samples, the aims were to: 1) describe the CRISIS and assess its acceptability and feasibility, 2) evaluate the
factor structure of the major domains; 3) examine the test-retest reliability and construct validity of these
domains across the multiple samples, and 4) estimate the relative importance of the measured domains to
current mood states (operationalized as mood over the previous 2 weeks).

2 Methods
2.1 Samples
Pilot data were collected between April 7th and 17th, 2020, through Prolific Academic (​https://www.prolific.ac/​)
(PA), an online crowdsourced survey recruitment service. Participants who signed up to join the PA participant
pool received monetary compensation for their time. PA participants have been shown to be more diverse and
provide higher quality data than similar data collection platforms.​29 ​We requested 3,000 adult self-report and
3,000 parent-report participants in the US and the UK. For parent reports, users were screened based on
having a child between 5 and 17 years old, and reported on their oldest child in that age range. Portions of the
sample were targeted at regions that were more severely impacted by COVID-19 in late March 2020 (New
York, California, London, and Manchester).
We received a total of 5,928 unduplicated responses, from which we dropped 282 with incomplete forms. The
final analytic sample sizes were 1,527 US adults (231 California; 246 New York), 1,539 UK adults (248
London; 238 Manchester), 1,121 US parents (27 California; 19 New York), and 1,459 UK parents (172 London;
219 Manchester). Samples were further divided into training (⅔) and hold-out (⅓) samples for assessing the
reproducibility of associations with current mood states. Resulting training data sample sizes were 935 (US
Adult), 938 (UK adult), 673 (US Parent), and 877 (UK Parent). Separate 24-hour test-retest reliability samples
were obtained from 74 US adults, 76 UK adults, 71 US parents, and 75 UK parents concurrently with the main
US/UK samples.
Because all data were collected anonymously, no IRB oversight was required. Exemption from IRB oversight
was approved by the Advarra Institutional Review Board. Participants using the PA website are required to
agree to the Terms of Service notification (​https://prolific.ac/assets/docs/Participant_Terms.pdf​) before being
allowed to complete surveys. Per the IRB exemption, no additional informed consent was required.
2.2. Measurement domains
To assess the structure, psychometric properties, and construct validity of the CRISIS, we focused on the
following domains and indicators (see Supplement for more details):
Participant characteristics: Age, sex, race/ethnicity, self- or parent-rated health, urbanicity, education,
household size, health insurance coverage, and family’s receipt of government assistance. Race was reported
to Prolific Academic and combined with a question on Hispanic ethnicity to generate the following categories:
Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Asian, and other.
SARS-CoV-2 exposure/infection in the past 2 weeks: Possible exposure to SARS-CoV-2, possible symptoms
of COVID-19, family member diagnosis of COVID-19, essential worker in the household, and whether there
had been any impacts on family members such as hospitalization, quarantine, and job loss because of
COVID-19.

COVID Worries in the past 2 weeks: ​P​articipants reported on a 5-point Likert scale how worried ​they have
been during the past 2 weeks ​about infection, friends and family being infected, and possible impacts on
physical and mental health, as well as time spent reading or talking about COVID-19, and hope that the
pandemic will end soon.
Life Changes due to the pandemic in the past 2 weeks: Downstream and subjective impacts of structural
changes, such as changes in social contacts, effects on family relationships, changes in living situation, food
insecurity, and stressors associated with these changes (14 items). Participants were also asked about job
loss and school closure due to the pandemic; these items were used as internal validators.
Mood States:​ Ten items from the circumplex model of affect​27,28 ​were included to measure mood/anxiety, both
during the past 2 weeks (hereafter referred to as “Current Mood States”) and during the 3 months prior to the
pandemic (hereafter referred to as “Prior Mood States”).
Substance Use: F
​ requency of use of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and other substances during the past 2
weeks and during the 3 months prior to the pandemic.
Daily Behaviors: Average weekday and weekend bedtime and sleep duration, frequency of exercise, time
spent outdoors, and length of media use per day were rated for the past 2 weeks and the 3 months prior to the
pandemic.
2.3. Analysis
Overview: ​Analyses focused on 5 domains of interest: COVID Worries, Life Changes, Mood States, Substance
Use, and Daily Behaviors. The statistical approaches are described below, with additional details in the
supplement. Structure was assessed via factor analysis and community detection subtyping. Test-retest
reliability was measured via the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC(3,1)).​30 ​Construct validity was assessed
by comparing associations between domains using chi-squared tests, ANOVAs and ANCOVAs, and via
random forests.
Factor Analysis (Aim 2): Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed in each sample. To assess the
stability and reproducibility of our factor structure, we split the ⅔ training dataset further into two datasets each
corresponding to ⅓ of the full dataset, we performed CFA on each. To assess unidimensionality, CFA was
applied in each sample split, with a comparative fit index (CFI) of > 0.95 and an Omega of > 0.8 indicating
adequate fit.​31​ Resulting factor scores were used to assess construct validity for Aim 4.
Community Detection Based Subtyping (Aim 2): Louvain community detection (LCD)​32 ​was used to derive
data-driven subtypes on domains that exhibited poor unidimensional fit in CFA. In order to maximize the
modularity of the sample, LCD selects the cluster resolution that maximizes the within-community coherence
and between-community segregation. LCD​32 was enhanced through bootstrap aggregation (i.e., bagging)
which has been shown to generate more reproducible clusters (see Supplement).​33,34 Resulting subtypes were
used to assess construct validity for Aim 4.
Test-Retest Reliability (Aim 3): We assessed the reliability of the factor scores and individual items using
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 3,1)​30 on the separate 24 hour test retest sample for each of the US and

UK adult and parent report samples. ICC results for factors and individual items are summarized in the
Supplement.
Random Forests (Aim 4): ​Random forest (RF), a robust technique known for its ability to model dependencies
between predictor variables (See Supplement),​35,36 was used to examine associations of participant
characteristics with Mood States and Behaviors (e.g., COVID Worries, Life Changes, Daily Behaviors, Media
Use, Substance Use, and Prior Mood States). RF assesses performance across the ensemble of decision
trees on the samples not included in each bootstrap iteration. The out-of-bag mean square error (MSE) and
node impurity were used as measures of relative variable importance for each predictor. ​Generalizability of the
importance of the variables identified in each random forest analysis was assessed in the ⅓ hold-out datasets.
In each subsample, a linear regression model was trained using the four most important variables and their
interaction terms. These models were then applied to each corresponding hold-out set to evaluate
out-of-sample performance.

3. Results
3.1 Acceptability and Feasibility (Aim 1)
Characteristics of the total analytic sample are presented in Table 1. Supplemental Table 1 shows the amount
of missing data and time to completion. The proportion of complete surveys was high (95.2%). The numbers of
missing items per survey were low, on average 0.6 (SD = 1.8) and 0.5 (SD = 1.1) for the US and UK Adult
reports respectively, and 0.4 (SD = 0.9) and 0.4 (SD = 1.0) for the US and UK parent reports. There was an
average of 13.9 (SD = 13.1) and 14.4 (SD = 11.5) minutes to completion for the US and UK Adult reports
respectively and 14.1 (SD = 7.5) and 13.9 (SD = 20.9) for the US and UK parent reports. Feedback from the
open-ended questions was generally positive, and no comments suggested that CRISIS was a burden,
consistent with the high completion rate and low rate of missing values.

respondents in the US and UK.

3.2 Factor Analysis and Community Detection Subtyping (Aim 2)
To evaluate the structure of the 5 domains of interest, we first conducted confirmatory factor analysis (Table 2).
The Mood States and COVID Worries domains each demonstrated high internal consistency as assessed
using coefficient Omega (>0.8), and good unidimensional model fit as assessed using the comparative fit index
(CFI >0.95) across each split samples of US and UK in both the Adult Self-Report and Parent-Report data.
Associations between factor scores are depicted in Supplementary Figure 2. We did not find strong evidence
for unidimensional model fit for Daily Behaviors and Media Use (CFI < 0.9), Life Changes (Adult CFI < 0.9;
Parent CFI <0.95), or adult Substance Use (CFI > 0.95 in US and <0.75 in UK), which was expected given that
these domains were designed to capture a broad variety of behaviors.
Because the Life Changes, Substance Use, and Behavior & Media Use domains generally exhibited poor
unidimensional fit in CFA, they were summarized via community detection subtyping. We conducted 2
subtyping analyses: one focused on the Life Changes domain, and another focused on the combined
Substance Use and Behavior & Media Use domains, using questions pertaining to the 3 months prior to the
pandemic (referred to as Prior Habits). The derived Life Changes subtypes in adults and children are displayed
in Figure 1. For both the adult self-report and parent report, the Life Changes subtypes were highly
reproducible across the US and UK samples, as Pearson’s correlations across the US and UK profiles show
high consistency (r = 0.91-0.99). Prior Habits subtypes in adults and children are described in the supplement.
In the adult sample, the ​low stress subtype (purple; 1) reported greater positive changes, in-person
conversations, and time outside; lower levels of stress from distancing, cancellations, and relationship
changes; and lower levels of food insecurity, financial difficulty, and housing instability. The ​social/interpersonal
stress subtype (blue; 2) reported worsening of relationships, higher stress levels, few positive changes, and
moderate levels of economic concerns. The ​economic stress subtype (orange; 3) reported the most problems

with food security, financial difficulty, and housing stability, but lower levels of other stresses, while also having
the least in-person conversations.
In the parent report, the ​low stress s​ ubtype (purple; 1) had somewhat improved family and friend relationships,
low stress related to social and interpersonal changes, and average levels of economic stress, time outside,
and positive changes. The ​social stress subtype (blue; 2) reported moderate to high levels of stress related to
social and interpersonal changes; low levels of economic stress; higher levels of positive changes, time
outside, and in-person conversations; US parents reported more worsening of relationships than did UK
parents. The ​social/economic stress subtype (orange; 3) reported the highest levels of economic and
social/interpersonal stress, worsening of family relationships, and the lowest levels of positive changes, time
outside the home, and in-person conversations.

3.3 Test-Retest Reliability (Aim 3)
24-hour test-retest reliability results are presented in Supplemental Table 4. We found the Mood States and
COVID Worries factor reliabilities were high (ICC (3,1) = 0.79-0.87) in all Adult and Parent Report samples.
Reliability of single items not included in factor scores was generally moderate to excellent (ICC of Prior Habits
variables mean = 0.79, sd = 0.09; ICC of Life Changes variables mean = 0.64, sd = 0.15; ICC of Substance
Use variables mean = 0.88, sd = 0.19) and are presented in Supplementary Table 2.
3.4. Associations Between Domains (Aim 4)
Mean factor scores by participant characteristics among adults are presented in Table 3. Most associations
were consistent across US and UK adults. COVID Worries was consistently higher among those with any
family impact (US p=.001; UK p < .001), a family member with a COVID diagnosis (US p=.019; UK p=.005),
and potential symptoms (US p=0.001; UK p<.001). In addition to associations with age and sex, Mood States
scores were also consistently higher among those with any family impact (US p=.011; UK p=.005), exposure to
someone with symptoms (US p=.036; UK p=.038), and potential symptoms (US p<.001; UK p<.001). COVID
Worries and Mood States factor scores were not associated with participant race/ethnicity or having an
essential worker in the home.
Associations of Life Changes subtypes with factor scores, participant characteristics, and school closure and
job loss are presented in Table 4. Life changes subtype was associated with Mood States (Prior: US p<
0.00001, UK p< 0.00001; Current: US p > 0.00001, UK p > 0.00001), as well as COVID Worries score (US p <
0.00001, UK p < 0.00001). Adjusting for Prior Mood States, Current Mood States scores were highest in the
social/interpersonal stress subtype among adults and the ​social/economic stress subtype among parent
reports (Table 4). Life Changes subtypes also differed by key demographic characteristics including age,
race/ethnicity, education, rooms in house, household density, and employment (see Table 4). Corresponding
results for Prior Habits subtypes appear in Supplemental Tables 3 and 4. Briefly, we find differences between
Prior Habit subtypes in COVID Worries, Prior Mood States, and Current Mood States, indicating the
importance of prior behavioral and psychological states in influencing the negative mental health outcomes of
the pandemic.
3.5 Predicting Mood States in the Early Phase of the Pandemic (Aim 4)
The random forests estimation of the relative importance of demographics, Prior Mood States, COVID Worries,
Life Changes subtype, and Prior Behavior, Media, and Substance Use, in predicting Current Mood States are
shown in Figure 2. Variables are ranked along the y-axis according to their importance in predicting out-of-bag
Current Mood States as measured by the percent change in MSE, displayed on the x-axis. Models accounted
for a high percentage of the out-of-bag variance in Current Mood States across all samples (Adult; US: 42.2%,
UK: 48.7%; Parent; US: 52.6%, UK: 44.6%).
Prior Mood States, COVID Worries, Life Changes Subtype, and age were the most important domains for
predicting Current Mood States in descending order of importance in the adult sample. On the other hand in
the parent report sample, after prior Mood states, the Life Changes subtype, COVID Worries and parent-rated
health predicted Mood States. Across the US and UK these importance values were highly replicable (Adult
Self Report: MSE Pearson’s r = 0.98; Impurity Pearson’s r = 0.99. Parent Report: MSE Pearson’s r = 0.96;
Impurity Pearson’s r = 0.98).

To assess the successive impact of adding COVID Worries and the Life Changes Subtype to our predictions,
we tested a baseline model without these variables and found much lower predictive accuracy (Adult; US:
30.4%, UK: 28.0%; Parent; US: 35.8%, UK: 20.7%). Performance increased dramatically when adding either
COVID Worries (Adult; US: +10.0%, UK: +16.8%; Parent; US: +7.9%, UK: +12.4%) or Lifestyle Changes
Subtype (Adult; US: +5.5%, UK: +7.2%; Parent; US: +13.3%, UK: +17.4%). As expected based on the
performance and variable importance ranking of the full models, COVID Worries conferred more additional
predictive performance for the Adult sample, while Lifestyle Changes Subtype conferred more additional
predictive performance for the Parent report sample.
Based on the random forest results, the 4 most important predictors of Current Mood States in adults were
Prior Mood States, COVID Worries, Life Changes Subtype, and age; in children, next most important was a
variable of parent-rated health of the child. Our trained linear model, including interactions, was able to predict
between 49.6-56.5% of the variance in Current Mood States across all four of the ⅓ sample hold-out data. This
result strongly demonstrates the generalizability of the importance of these variables in predicting Current
Mood States.

DISCUSSION
The findings presented here demonstrate the feasibility, reliability, and construct validity of the CRISIS in large
pilot samples in the US and UK. The high completion rates, low rates of missing data, and rapid completion
times demonstrate that the CRISIS is feasible to administer in large samples. The unidimensional Mood States
and COVID Worries factor scores reached excellent levels of both internal and test retest reliability (Omega >
0.9; ICCs between 0.79-0.87), and individual items from other measured domains showed high ICC as well.
High reliability of survey instruments is absolutely critical in evaluating change and in robustly identifying those
in need of interventions or other forms of support. The unidimensional structure of the COVID Worries and
Mood States domains were highly replicable across all samples. The construct validity of the CRISIS was
demonstrated by the reproducible associations between measured domains as well as the associations of
COVID Worries and pandemic-associated life changes with Current Mood States determined from the
well-established circumplex model of affect.​27,28 Together, the results demonstrate the utility of the CRISIS for
population-based mental health research during the COVID-19 pandemic. The highly robust replication of our
findings across samples, countries, and informants suggests that CRISIS would be appropriate for application
across an array of research settings around the world. To date, the CRISIS is being administered in more than
eight countries and translations have been developed in several languages. Thus, we will have the opportunity
to test the reliability and validity in middle- and low-income countries around the globe. More about CRISIS and
its adaptation for Autism and related Neurodevelopmental Conditions (CRISIS AFAR; ​www.crisissurvey.org/​),
and other such international collaborations through the Wellcome Trust (​www.COVIDminds.org/​) can be found
online.
COVID Worries was either the first (UK) or second (US) most important predictor of Current Mood States
among adults in April, 2020, followed by pandemic-associated life changes. These results suggest that fear
and worry about COVID and resulting changes in routines and daily life are significant drivers of adverse
mental health outcomes associated with the pandemic, consistent with previous data on the impact of the
Fukushima disaster.​37,38 This speaks to the value of measuring COVID-related fears and worries, as in the
CRISIS and other instruments developed for the COVID pandemic.​18–24 It also implies that active steps that
could be taken to offset the impact and lessen the burden of changes in lifestyle by social, governmental or
other agencies could have a significant impact in ameliorating negative mental health outcomes.​39 Future
studies including repeated longitudinal assessments could assess the potential long-term effects of such
policies on mental health and enable comprehensive evaluation of costs and benefits.
Our finding of parent report data that indicated that Current Mood States among children was more strongly
related to Life Changes than COVID Worries is consistent with the known importance of regular, predictable,
daily routines for pediatric mental health,​40,41 and suggests that attending to changes in children’s lives may be
key to predicting those at greatest risk for negative psychological impact of the pandemic. Consistent with the
review of Brooks et al,​7 subgroups reporting family and social isolation stress in both adults and children in the
US and UK had significantly higher Current Mood States scores. In addition, subgroups of children with higher
family and social isolation stress also experienced the highest parent-reported stress related to financial and
food security. This underscores the impact of multifactorial physical, emotional, interpersonal, social, and
financial stressors that converge during this pandemic. The links between Life Changes profiles and the
COVID Worries and Mood States factors attest to the validity of these domains and their potential utility as
targets for pandemic-related interventions.

Possessing information on mental and behavioral health prior to the pandemic significantly enhances the ability
to assess the impact of the pandemic and its correlates on mental health outcomes by allowing researchers to
evaluate both the change in mental health during the pandemic and the potential for prior characteristics to
moderate the effects of pandemic-related stressors. Indeed, this is a central goal of the CRISIS initiative.
Because information on prior mental health may not be available to all researchers, we included retrospective
reports of key domains in the CRISIS to enable researchers to evaluate the role of prior characteristics and
clinical state.​42 Our finding that Prior Mood States and Prior Habits were significantly associated with Current
Mood States provides support for the importance of psychological status prior to the pandemic. The
reproducibility of the structure of the multi-dimensional domains of Life Changes and Prior Habits attests to the
value of this feature of the CRISIS. Ultimately, prospective measures of pre-COVID mental health will facilitate
the identification of those at greatest risk of long term sequelae of this pandemic, as shown in previous disaster
research.​2,6
This study is limited by its use of a web-based convenience sample, which raises the possibility of selection
bias and impedes our ability to generalize our findings to the broader US and UK populations. This limitation
applies to the majority of the current mental health surveys of COVID-19, which have mostly used samples
ascertained through web-based sources.​43 We employed this approach in order to quickly deploy the CRISIS
to large numbers of participants within a brief time frame during the initial peak of the pandemic, to rapidly
evaluate test-retest reliability, and to pilot the shorter follow-up version of the CRISIS. We do not expect the
composition of our sample to strongly affect our findings regarding the structure of the CRISIS, the reliability of
its items or unidimensional domains, or its construct validity. The relatively lower racial/ethnic diversity in the
present study is an important limitation, particularly in light of the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on
marginalized communities.​44,45 Further work is required to assess the properties of CRISIS in different
racial/ethnic groups, cultural settings, and languages. However, these data source provided samples with
broad coverage of the US and UK populations with respect to age, sex, and race.​44,46,47 Moreover, this pilot
study did not include the youth self-report version of the CRISIS, but this work is now underway in our
collaborative network. Validation of youth reports will be particularly relevant because the profiles of predictors
of change derived from families with children under age 18 differed from those from adult households.
These findings reflect the initial steps of instrument development to implement our collaborative effort on the
mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. With some exceptions,​18–24 this study of the CRISIS is one of
the few COVID-19 stress/anxiety questionnaires that has provided psychometric data on its factor structure
and/or validity of the content. The factors derived in our study replicate those of Taylor ​et al 21
​ who likewise
employed statistical approaches that demonstrated the heterogeneity of impact of COVID-19 fears and anxiety,
and the impact of prior mental health problems on its severity. We further demonstrate the utility of the CRISIS
through its reproducible structure, its acceptability, feasibility, and reliability, and its construct validity across
multiple samples. The inclusion of adult and parent versions to examine differences in the impact of COVID-19
across the life span will also facilitate our ability to gain insight into the impact of the pandemic on children and
families. Efforts to administer the survey in previously well characterized samples such as the Healthy Brain
Network, a landmark ongoing mental health study of 10,000 children with deep phenotyping across a range of
psychiatric, cognitive, affective, language, genetic, and neuroscientific characteristics,​48 are underway. The
major goal of our initiative is to conduct research that informs priorities for interventions and policy changes to
ameliorate the mental health consequences of the pandemic, both acutely and in the long term.

Supplemental Methods
Overview: ​First, we used confirmatory factor analysis to assess the structure of each of the domains and
inform the calculation of factor scores for unidimensional constructs. Test-retest reliability was calculated for
unidimensional factors and individual items using ICC(3,1).​30 We used Louvain community detection, a
clustering technique, to meaningfully summarize domains for which unidimensional factors exhibited poor fit.
Finally, we used random forests to demonstrate the construct validity of the CRISIS by assessing the
importance of the included domains in predicting the Current Mood States factor.
Subtyping: ​We use bagging-enhanced Louvain Community Detection to discover groups of individuals that
have profiles across both the Life Changes questions, and the Daily Behaviors, Media Use, and Substance
Use questions, which we called the Prior Habits subtypes. Louvain Community Detection is known to robustly
link observations together through the use of an iterative modularity-optimizing procedure to find groups of
individuals. Other clustering approaches, such as K-means, or spectral clustering, require the experimenter to

choose the resolution of the clustering a priori, which can be problematic and lead to instability across
samples.​49–51 Louvain Community detection on the other hand, through iterative permutations of individuals in
each community, optimizes for modularity, a commonly used metric of cluster quality.​32,52 We enhance the
reproducibility of our subtyping method through the use of bootstrap aggregation, or bagging. Using bootstrap
aggregated clustering creates more reproducible clusters by reducing variability that may occur due to random
variations in sample composition.
Random Forest: ​Briefly, the RF algorithm creates a series of decision trees for which a random selection of
variables are chosen and a bootstrapped sample is used to train the model. For each iteration of the 1000
bootstrap runs, the performance on each of these decision trees on the out-of-sample data, roughly ⅓ of the
sample, is aggregated and used to assess the performance of the RF model. (For a review of RF, see​51​). RF
provides a robust assessment of the relative impact of each of these variables in predicting outcomes, known
as variable importance, which we assess for each variable in our predictive model. To protect against
overfitting, we create a null performance distribution from our own data by shuffling the outcome variable and
repeating the random forest prediction pipeline 1000 times. The out-of-sample prediction R-squared value is
then calculated for our prediction and compared to the distribution of these 1000 shuffled null models. We
assess if our predictive accuracy surpasses the 99.9999% confidence interval of the null model. We used
COVID Worries and Prior Mood States transformed into quintiles in order to protect against the inflation effects
that RF can have on the variable importance of continuous versus categorical variables.​53

Supplemental Results
Prior Habits Subtyping: We found 3 Prior Habits subtypes in both US and UK adult samples. Individuals in
subtype 1 spend the least amount of time exercising and outdoors, and in the US go to sleep relatively later
and spend more time on media, while in the UK this subtype goes to sleep earlier and spends an average
amount of time on media. Subtype two goes to bed later, in the US this subtype gets relatively less sleep but
spends more time exercising and outdoors, while in the UK this group gets an average amount of sleep and
time spent exercising and outdoors. Subtype 3 goes to bed earliest and spends more time exercising and
outdoors, and reports relatively lower media use and drug use.
Across US and UK samples these subtypes were highly reproducible, with high Pearson’s correlations
between subtype mean scores (r 0.71 – 0.96) for the adult sample. ANOVA revealed Prior Habits subtypes had
different Prior Mood States factor (US p< 0.00001, UK p< 0.00001) but ANCOVA of Current Mood States
controlling for Prior Mood states only differed in the US sample (US p > 0.05, UK p > 0.05). The US sample
also showed different Mood States scores by subtype (US p < 0.00001; UK p = 0.06). COVID Worries scores
differed by subtype in the UK but not US (US p > 0.05, UK p < 0.01). Mean factor scores by subtype are shown
in the Supplemental table 3. Overall, results indicated significant differences between subtypes in prior mood
states scores in both US and UK, with subtype 1 showing highest scores in the US and subtype 3 showing
highest scores in the UK. We also see significant subtype differences by age in both US and UK. Prior Habits
subtypes also differed by key demographic variables including age, race, education, rooms in house,
household density, and employment status (see Supplement).
The parent report US and UK subtypes were highly reproducible, with high Pearson’s correlations between
subtype mean scores (r 0.97 – 0.99) In the parent report data we found 3 Prior Habit subtypes in the US
sample and 4 in the UK sample. Individuals in subtype 1, in both the US and UK went to bed later in the
evening and got the least amount of sleep, and also spent less time exercising and outdoors. Subtype 1 also
reports the highest media use and ratings of drug use. Subtype 2 went to bed early and got above average
sleep, but below average exercise, outdoor time, and social media use. Compared to previous subtypes,
Subtype 3 showed relatively divergent patterns across the US and UK, with the US sample showing later than
average bedtime and media use, less than average sleep, while in the UK individuals had an early bedtime but
greater than average sleep and less media use on average. Subtype 4, in the UK only, showed the earliest
bedtime, and the greatest amount of sleep, exercise and outdoor time, and the least amount of media use.
One-way ANOVA of subtype by Prior Mood score and ANCOVA of Current Mood factor score, controlling for
Prior Mood Score, indicates that these Prior Habits subtypes show different patterns of Mood States over time
(Prior Mood State: US p > 0.05, UK p< 0.00001; Current Mood State: US p > 0.05, UK p > 0.05). One-way
ANOVA of subtype by COVID Worries factor score shows that these Prior Habits subtypes are sensitive to
differences in COVID worries in the UK but not US (US p < 0.05, UK p < 0.00001). ​The parent report subtypes
show subtype 1 and 2 with the highest and lowest COVID worries factor scores respectively. We also see that
subtype 1 and 2 are significantly different in age distribution, with subtype 1 having the most teenagers and
subtype 2 having the most children under 5.

loadings are displayed on the y-axis. US subtypes in solid lines, UK in dashed lines. Notes: ∆ Family Relations
and ∆ Friends Relationships were reverse coded to facilitate Subtype interpretation; higher scores indicate
worsening quality of the relationships. Prior to the community detection analyses In-Person Conversation was
re-coded into tertiles.

S. Table 5. ​Random Forest tests identified the above five variables (COVID Worries, Prior Mood States, Life
Changes Subtypes, Age, and Physical Health) to be the most important for predicting Current Mood States.
The relationship between COVID Worries, Prior Mood States and Current Mood States was tested with
Pearson correlations in and out of sample. ANOVA was used to test the difference in Current Mood States with
Age (Adult Report) and parent-rated Physical Health (Parent Report) in out of sample. P values < .05 indicate
significant differences in membership between Prior Habits and Life Changes subtypes. Correlation values are
provided next the p value for COVID Worries and Prior Mood States.

S. Table 6​. Chi-Square tests were conducted between the Prior Habits and Life Changes subtypes to assess
the existence of a differential makeup. P values < .05 indicate significant differences in membership between
Prior Habits and Life Changes subtypes.
