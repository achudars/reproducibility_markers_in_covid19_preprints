Abstract
The global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 has raised concerns about the potential
mental health impact on frontline clinical staff. However, given that poor mental health is
common in staff working in acute medicine, we aimed to estimate the additional burden of
working directly with infected patients during epidemic and pandemic health emergencies.
We completed a rapid review of the evidence and identified 74 relevant studies from
outbreaks of COVID-19, Ebola, H1N1 influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS),
and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Due to varying caseness criteria, a metaanalysis of prevalence was not possible. However, it was clear that levels of self-reported
depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related symptoms were high,
and somewhat higher in clinical staff working in high exposure roles. To assess the impact of
high- versus low-exposure healthcare work more formally, we estimated the standardised
mean difference (SMD) of scale means using a random effects meta-analysis. High exposure
work was associated with only a small additional burden of acute mental health problems
compared to low exposure work (anxiety: SMD=0.22, 95% CI 0.06 – 0.38; PTSD symptoms:
SMD=0.21, 95% CI 0.01 – 0.4; depression: SMD=0.20, -0.07 – 0.47). This effect was
potentially inflated by publication bias and there was a moderate risk of bias in the studies in
the meta-analysis. A narrative review of candidate risk factors identified being a nurse, seeing
colleagues infected, experiencing quarantine, non-voluntary role assignment, and
experiencing stigma, as associated with particularly poor mental health outcomes. Protective
factors included team and institutional support, use and faith in infection prevention
measures, and a sense of professional duty and altruistic acceptance of risk. Notably, formal
psychological support services were valued by frontline staff, although those with the highest
burden of mental health difficulties were the least likely to request or receive support.

Introduction
The recent SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 pandemic has seen an increased demand on clinical
staff, who need to treat large numbers of patients, often in newly-purposed wards, with little
disease-specific evidence to guide treatment. Many clinical staff have been moved into new
roles and may be managing acutely unwell patients using unfamiliar equipment. Stresses
caused by high patient mortality rates, staffing shortages, concerns about infecting self or
family members, and changing guidance on personal protective equipment can add to work
pressure. This has raised concerns about the potential impact on the mental health of
epidemic and pandemic responders (Chen et al., 2020; Greenberg et al., 2020).
However, high rates of poor mental health are common in clinical staff working in acute
medicine generally (Carrieri et al., 2018; He et al., 2020; Su et al., 2009) and so estimating
the additional impact of epidemic and pandemic response, not solely the extent of poor
mental health, is also important in guiding decisions to protect staff’s mental health during
times of increased demand on clinical services. In doing so, identifying risk and protective
factors for mental health outcomes is key.
Consequently, we review and meta-analyse studies on the mental health of clinical staff
dealing with epidemics and pandemics of high-risk infectious diseases, including studies
from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), Ebola virus disease, H1N1 influenza, severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) to
understand the potential impact on mental health and to inform policy on supporting staff
during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods
There is no standardised procedure for conducting rapid reviews, although several approaches
have been used to reduce the complexity of the review process (Haby et al., 2016). We used
an iterative rapid review procedure that selected search terms with a high sensitivity for
relevant articles and then used the reference lists to identify further articles. We searched
PubMed, Medline, PsychInfo and Embase for articles including ‘mental health’ or
‘psychosocial’ or ‘emotional’ and ‘staff’ and a number of disease specific key words
(epidemic, epidemics, pandemic, flu, SARS, MERS, COVID-19, Ebola, Marburg, H1N1,
H7N6) in the title. We also searched pre-print servers MedRXviv and SSRN for pre-prints
relating to COVID-19.

published in English or Spanish (the languages of the authors) that reported mental health
outcomes in clinical staff managing high-risk infectious disease outbreaks. One article in
Chinese with numeric results reported in the English-language abstract was also included.
Studies of all methodologies reporting original results were included (including qualitative
and quantitative studies).
The final count of articles included by condition were: COVID-19: 14, Ebola: 11, H1N1: 4,
MERS: 6, SARS: 39. No relevant studies on Marburg or H7N6 flu were found. Studies were
conducted in China (16), Hong Kong (12), Taiwan (11), Canada (8), Singapore (6), Sierra
Leone (4), Saudi Arabia (3), South Korea (3), Germany (1), Greece (1), Israel (1), Japan (1),
Liberia (1), Mexico (1), Uganda and the Republic of Congo (1), United States (2), and two
studies that recruited aid workers who had worked in various West African countries.
Numeric data from studies reporting i) above-cut off prevalence or, ii) means and standard
deviations from validated anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression
symptom scales were collated. Due to studies using differing cut-offs for determining
caseness even when using the same scale, meta-analysis for prevalence was not possible and
so a narrative review of prevalence was conducted. However, meta-analysis for differences in
mean scale scores between high and low exposure roles was possible and was used to help
determine the mental health impact of work involving high exposure to infected patients in
epidemic and pandemic health emergencies. We defined high and low exposure as direct
contact with infected patients, or work in wards where direct contact was considered highly
likely (e.g. critical care, designated treatment wards, emergency departments) compared to
clinicians working without direct contact or work in hospital areas where direct contact was
unlikely. A narrative review of risk factors was conducted across all studies regardless of
methodology.
We conducted a power analysis for meta-analysis (Valentine et al., 2010) to determine the
minimum number of studies required to detect a statistically significant difference in
standardised mean difference between high and low exposure groups. We calculated power to
detect a small effect size and based on results of the Brooks et al. (2018) systematic review of
SARS response studies, assumed medium study heterogeneity and an average group size of
N=150. This indicated that a minimum study count of 5 was needed. Effect sizes were
calculated as standardised mean differences and we used a random effects model to estimate
pooled effect sizes. The possibility of publication bias was assessed using trim and fill (Duval
and Tweedie, 2000), rank correlation test of funnel plot asymmetry (Begg and Mazumdar,
1994), and Egger’s test (Egger and Smith, 1998). All analysis was conducted with R (version
3.6.1) using the ‘meta’ package (version 4.11.0) and was conducted on a Linux x86_64
platform.
A risk of bias assessment was conducted for all studies reporting prevalences or included in
the meta-analysis.

Results
Prevalence of poor mental health of epidemic and pandemic response healthcare workers
All studies except one (Lancee et al., 2008) used self-report scales to measure symptoms. As
can be seen from Tables 1-3, there was considerable variation in the cut-offs used to
determine caseness with lower cut-offs understandably producing higher prevalence
estimates. Because of this, a meta-analysis of prevalence was not possible.
However, a narrative analysis indicates that the majority of healthcare workers involved in
the treatment of patients during high-risk epidemics and pandemics do not report mental
health problems, and those that do typically report symptoms in the mild to moderate range
with a smaller percentage of responders reporting severe psychopathology. There were only
two studies in which the majority of healthcare workers reported symptoms of poor mental
health on any measure (COVID-19: Lai et al., 2020; MERS: Lee et al., 2018), and one of
these (Lai et al., 2020) used a particularly low cut-off for reporting prevalence (mild range
and above).
Although direct statistical comparison between studies is prevented by the use of different
cut-off criteria, inspection of the differences in prevalence rates for high and low exposure
groups within studies show that high exposure working is associated with higher rates of
above cut-off scoring across all measures (mean 29.86%, SD=18.83%) compared to low
exposure working (mean 22.82%, SD = 17.01%) with an average additional prevalence of
7.57% in high exposure groups. However, because these are means of above cut-off
prevalences where studies have used different cut-offs it is not clear what an additional
7.57% of prevalence represents in terms of severity.

Meta-analytic estimate of the effect of exposure on acute mental health outcomes
Given that high rates of poor mental health are common in staff working in acute medicine
(Carrieri et al., 2018; He et al., 2020; Su et al., 2009) we attempted to estimate the additional
impact of working in high exposure roles. Meta-analytic estimates of impact of working in
high exposure roles are presented in Figure 2 (anxiety symptom measures), Figure 3 (PTSD
symptom measures) and Figure 4 (depression symptom measures).
All analyses show that the difference between working in high and low exposure roles was
small (effect sizes of 0.22 and below). The confidence intervals for estimates did not cross
zero for anxiety and PTSD symptom measures, but they did cross zero in the case of the
meta-analysis for depression measures. However, study heterogeneity was larger than we
assumed during the power calculation and there were the fewest number of studies included
for the depression meta-analysis (k=6), meaning it was likely under-powered to detect small
effects.
Inspection of the funnel plot suggested evidence of publication bias but the statistical tests of
funnel plot asymmetry were not interpreted as the minimum criteria of 10 included studies
was not met (Ioannidis and Trikalinos, 2007).

Risk and protective factors
Although it was not possible to examine risk and protective factors meta-analytically, a
narrative review was conducted to identify likely candidates.
Nurses typically reported higher levels of symptoms and distress than doctors (Goulia et al.,
2010; Huang et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2020; C. Liu et al., 2020; Matsuishi et al., 2012; Nickell
et al., 2004; Poon et al., 2004; Tham et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2020) with a few studies
reporting no difference (Dai et al., 2020; Maunder et al., 2006; Sun et al., 2020) and one
study reporting higher rates in doctors (Chan and Huak, 2004).
Several studies noted that seeing colleagues infected was a particular source of distress (Dai
et al., 2020; Khalid et al., 2016; Raven et al., 2018). Furthermore, being quarantined after
infection was reported as a predictor of psychological distress and poor mental health (Bai et
al., 2004; Dai et al., 2020; Fiksenbaum et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2012; Marjanovic et al., 2007;
Styra et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2009, 2008) which was also reflected in one qualitative study
(Robertson et al., 2004) although three studies found no negative impact of quarantine
(Chong et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2018; Styra et al., 2008).
Notably, numerous studies reported that clinical staff dealing with high-risk infectious
disease experienced stigma from friends, family and the public (Bai et al., 2004; Goulia et al.,
2010; Grace et al., 2005; Hewlett and Hewlett, 2005; Khee et al., 2004; Koh et al., 2005;
Maunder et al., 2006; McMahon et al., 2016; Meyer et al., 2018; Nickell et al., 2004; Park et
al., 2018; Poon et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2017; Styra et al., 2008; von Strauss et al., 2017) and
perceived stigma was found to be a predictor of poor mental health in the three studies that
looked at this association statistically (Koh et al., 2005; Maunder et al., 2006; Park et al.,
2018).
Three studies found that clinical staff who were conscripted, were not willing, or had not
volunteered for high exposure roles reported particularly poor mental health outcomes (Chen
et al., 2005, 2006; Dai et al., 2020; Tam et al., 2004).
Although small in number, longitudinal studies tended to suggest that symptoms of poor
mental health tend to peak early during outbreaks but resolve for the majority of responders
as time goes on (Chen et al., 2006; Su et al., 2009). This pattern of initially high levels of
anxiety and distress that reduce over time was also reflected in some of the qualitative studies
(Chung et al., 2005; Shih et al., 2009). One cross-sectional study conducted at two time
points and sampling from the same clinical teams found high levels of self-reported poor
mental health for high exposure workers one year after high-exposure work (Maunder et al.,
2006) although a study on a subsample of participants using a structured interview
assessment found the incidence of new onset mental health problems was essentially no
different to that found in the general population (Lancee et al., 2008).
In terms of protective factors that reduced the chance of poor mental health or psychological
distress, social support, team cohesion or organisational support were identified by numerous

studies (Chan and Huak, 2004; Chang et al., 2006; Fiksenbaum et al., 2006; Khalid et al.,
2016; Lee et al., 2005; Marjanovic et al., 2007; Sun et al., 2020; von Strauss et al., 2017;
Xiao et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). This theme was reflected in several qualitative studies
(Meyer et al., 2018; Raven et al., 2018).
Furthermore, the use, availability, training with, and faith in, infection prevention measures
were identified as reducing distress (Chua et al., 2004; Khalid et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2005,
2005; Marjanovic et al., 2007; Maunder et al., 2006; Nickell et al., 2004; Sim et al., 2004;
Zhu et al., 2020)
A sense of professional duty and altruistic acceptance of risk were found to be a protective
factor in several studies (Goulia et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2012; Oh et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2009)
which was a theme that was strongly reflected in qualitative studies (Chung et al., 2005;
Hewlett and Hewlett, 2005; Raven et al., 2018; Wong et al., 2012) although one study found
accepting the risk of SARS infection as part of the job was not associated with reduced
psychopathology (Koh et al., 2005).
Notably, all studies that asked about positive aspects of working in epidemic and pandemic
response reported that participants described several factors related to learning and
development as an individual and a team (Chua et al., 2004; Grace et al., 2005; Nickell et al.,
2004).
Role of formal psychological support services
Although a recent anecdotal report noted clinicians did not find mental health support
particularly useful during COVID-19 response (Chen et al., 2020) several studies found that
participants reported formal psychological support services to be a useful source of support
(Goulia et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2005; Meyer et al., 2018; Smith et al., 2017; von Strauss et al.,
2017). One study specifically asked whether staff needed ‘psychological treatment’ and 8.6%
of healthcare workers dealing with COVID-19 reported they did (C. Liu et al., 2020).
Conversely, however, Chung and Yeung (2020) reported that only 2% of staff responding to
COVID-19 requested psychological support and all “were reassured after a single phone
contact by the psychiatric nurse” although this was a notably small study with just 69
participants.
Notably, two large COVID-19 studies suggest that the staff who are most in need of
psychological support are the least likely to request or receive it. One study found that high
exposure staff were likely to say they needed psychological treatment at half the rate of low
exposure staff despite reporting higher levels of psychopathology (C. Liu et al., 2020). In
another, clinicians with mental health problems were less likely to receive psychological
support than clinicians without (Z. Liu et al., 2020).

Discussion
To estimate the impact of high exposure work in epidemic and pandemic health emergencies,
we completed a rapid review and meta-analysis of studies reporting on the mental health of
clinical staff working in high-risk epidemic and pandemic health emergencies, including
studies from the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Both of these comparisons suggest that the
impact of epidemic and pandemic response work on mental health is small, but in the case of
meta-analytic assessment, statistically detectable. However, this is in addition to already high
levels of poor mental health that are common in acute medical staff. A narrative review of
potential risk factors for poor mental health in epidemic and pandemic response identified
being a nurse, experiencing stigma from others, seeing colleagues infected, and being
personally quarantined as predictors of worse outcomes. Protective factors included social
and occupational support, effectiveness and faith in infection control measures, a sense of
professional duty and altruistic acceptance of risk. Formal psychological support services
were identified as a valuable form of support.
It is worth noting some of the shortcomings of the evidence used to inform this review. More
studies reported results from the analysis of mental health measures than reported sufficient
detail (prevalence, mean scores etc) to allow them to be included in the numeric assessment
of results in this review. Study quality was moderate at best and there was a suggestion of
publication bias. Furthermore, studies almost exclusively used self-report measures rather
than structured interview assessments.
The results of this review and meta-analysis raise several issues with regard to provide
ongoing and long-term support for clinical staff responding to such health emergencies. One
is the extent to which epidemic and pandemic response is uniquely ‘traumatising’ and might
lead to high levels of posttraumatic stress disorder, thereby implying that a trauma-focus for
staff support should be the dominant approach to addressing outcomes of poor mental health.
With regard to the published studies, although there are seemingly high rates of staff who
score above cut-off on measures of PTSD symptoms, some significant caveats need to be
born in mind. As can be seen from Table 3, cut-off values used for defining a positive ‘case’
varied considerably even between studies using the same measure. The most widely used
scale in these studies is the Impact of Events Scale-Revised for which a cut-off of 33-34 has
been found to be the most predictive of diagnosable PTSD (Creamer et al., 2003; Morina et
al., 2013) and yet most studies use a cut-off of considerably less. This suggests that an
important proportion of those reported under the prevalence figures are likely to have
transitory, sub-syndromal PTSD symptoms, or non-specific distress, that may be a risk for
PTSD but are unlikely to reach the level of a diagnosable case. Indeed, the prevalences
reported here are comparable to prevalences found in clinical staff more widely. For example,
the reported prevalence of >33 scoring on the IES-R is 15% in acute medical staff (Naumann
et al., 2017), 16% in surgical trainees (Thompson et al., 2017), and 17% in cancer physicians
(McFarland and Roth, 2017). Studies included in this review using similar IES-R cut-offs
tended to report lower prevalence rates with only one study (Zhu et al., 2020) reporting
higher.

Furthermore, studies often did not differentiate between PTSD symptoms arising from
pandemic and epidemic response work and those from other events meaning it is not clear to
what extent epidemic or pandemic response work was the key causal factor. Finally,
symptoms were almost exclusively measured by self-report measures which are known to
inflate the rate of true cases (Bonanno et al., 2010). Indeed, high rates on self-report measures
but low rates on structured interview assessments have been found in SARS responders
(Lancee et al., 2008).
This suggests that although there is potential for trauma and this should be included in
considerations for staff support, it is currently not clear that PTSD is an outcome particularly
associated with epidemic and pandemic response meaning support efforts should be ‘trauma
ready’ rather than ‘trauma focused’. However, we note here the importance of contextual
factors. The capacity of the healthcare system, and indeed the population, are key factors in
determining the impact of the medical response on the staff responsible for delivering it.
Indeed, some of the contextual factors were reflected in the risk and protective factors
identified in the review. These chime with previous work on epidemic response work (Brooks
et al., 2018b) and the wider literature on mental health outcomes in high-risk work (Brooks et
al., 2019) and suggest similar measures to support staff, namely promoting good leadership
and team cohesion, maintaining high standards of infection control and training. In addition,
this review highlights that additional attention should be given to nurses, those affected by
seeing colleagues infected, where staff are quarantined after being infected, and where
individuals experience stigma from others.
It is worth highlighting that formal psychological support was considered useful by clinical
staff but that it was least requested and less frequently received by those with higher levels of
mental health difficulties. Although voluntary engagement with mental health services is
considered the ideal model to avoid potential iatrogenic effects (Brooks et al., 2018a),
particular attention should be paid to pathways to formal support to make these as accessible
as possible for those who need them. This is particularly important as staff working in acute
medicine may already have high levels of poor mental health and access to effective
treatment during health emergencies should be a priority.
Priorities for research
The majority of studies are cross-sectional measuring mental health in staff working in
epidemic and pandemic response. These studies typically have large sample sizes and good
response rates. However, there remains a need for: i) standardisation of measures, reporting,
and criteria for prevalence; ii) adequately sampled case-control studies that compare
epidemic and pandemic response staff to control groups of other staff in acute medicine; and
iii) longitudinal studies to examine the course of psychological distress over time. We also
note that i) would effectively be solved if open data was available from the relevant studies,
and we strongly encourage researchers to make this data available, particularly when
researching infectious disease health emergencies.
