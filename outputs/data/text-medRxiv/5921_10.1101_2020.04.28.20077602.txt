Abstract
In response to the rapidly evolving COVID‐19 pandemic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
rapidly issued 49 emergency use authorizations (EUAs) for SARS‐CoV‐2 in vitro diagnostic test‐kits. A
critical metric in the performance evaluation for a diagnostic test kit is the analytical sensitivity, which is
measured by the limit of detection (LOD). Commercial RNA stocks with known titers are used to determine
LOD. We identified a problem with the titer reported for the commercial stocks when examining the
analytical sensitivity of the reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT‐qPCR) protocol that is
recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) using plasmid DNA from
Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), synthetic RNA from BEI Resources (BEI), and extracted genomic RNA
from BEI. We detected 3/3 positives for reactions containing synthetic RNA at a concentration of 0.1
copies/reaction (based on the supplier’s label concentration). The apparent better‐than‐single‐molecule
performance is a statistically highly unlikely event, indicating a potential inaccuracy in the supplier’s
quantification of the stock material. Using an ultrasensitive and precise assay, reverse transcription digital
PCR (RT‐dPCR), we independently quantified concentrations of commercial SARS‐CoV‐2 plasmid DNA and
SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA stocks. For plasmid DNA, the actual concentration measured by RT‐dPCR was 11% of the
nominal label concentration. For synthetic RNA, the actual concentration measured by RT‐dPCR for one
lot was 770% of the label concentration and for a different lot was 57% of the label concentration. For
genomic RNA, the concentration measured by RT‐dPCR for one lot was 240% of the label concentration
and for a different lot it was 300% of the label concentration. This SARS‐CoV‐2 genomic RNA from BEI
Resources has been used in at least 11 approved FDA Emergency Use Authorizations as of April 27, 2020.
Such deviations of reported RNA or DNA stock concentrations from true concentrations can result in
inaccurate quantification and calculation of LOD. Precise and accurate reporting of DNA and RNA stock
concentrations by commercial suppliers will enable accurate quantification of assay performance, which
is urgently needed to improve evaluation of different assays by diagnostic developers and regulatory
bodies.

Introduction
As of April 27, 2020, the COVID‐19 pandemic has reached 185 countries/regions, with more than 3 million
infected individuals, and more than 210,000 deaths.[1, 2] The rapid spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 (the virus that
causes COVID‐19) and the large proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals has led to widespread
demand for diagnostic test kits. To meet the massive demand, on February 4, 2020, the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services (HSS) secretary declared that circumstances exist justifying the
authorization of emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for detecting SARS‐CoV‐2.[3] Since then, the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has fast‐tracked 49 Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for SARS‐
CoV‐2 test‐kit manufacturers and commercial laboratories.[4]
The application to receive an EUA requires a description of the assay and an evaluation of its
performance.[5] A key metric in evaluating assay performance is the analytical sensitivity, which describes
the ability of a test to detect very low concentrations of the target analyte. Analytical sensitivity is typically
measured using the limit‐of‐detection (LOD), which is the concentration of target analyte that can be
consistently detected at least 95% of the time (19 of 20 replicates are positive). It is important for test kits
to demonstrate a low LOD, which indicates good sensitivity of the test and the ability to detect samples
containing very low viral RNA concentrations. Thus far, many diagnostic test kits for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA have
reported good LODs, with some reporting down to as low as 40 copies/mL.
We obtained SARS‐nCoV‐2 plasmid DNA from IDT, synthetic SARS‐nCoV‐2 RNA from BEI, and genomic
RNA from SARS‐nCoV‐2, isolate USA‐WA1/2020 from BEI. In a well‐functioning assay (i.e., perfect
transcription of RNA), we would expect to observe the same LOD for all 3 stocks. Instead, using the
quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐qPCR) protocol recommended by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we found substantial discrepancies, leading us to
question the accuracy of the reported stock concentrations from the commercial suppliers.
In this manuscript, we aimed to resolve the discrepancies in the LODs obtained with the three SARS‐CoV‐
2 NA stocks by performing our own quantification of each stock concentration using a highly sensitive
digital quantification method, reverse transcription digital PCR (RT‐dPCR).[6, 7]

Results and Discussion
Half‐log dilutions of NA stocks in RT‐qPCR
We first performed half‐log dilutions on each SARS‐CoV‐2 NA stock (plasmid DNA from 10,000 to 3.16
nominal copies/reaction and synthetic RNA and genomic RNA from 100 to 0.0316 nominal
copies/reaction) using the CDC‐recommended RT‐qPCR protocol (Fig. 1). A priori, we expect all NA stocks
to have similar LOD. We also expect that the RNA LOD may be slightly worse than the DNA LOD because
RNA must be transcribed prior to amplification. Contrary to these expectations, we observed that both
RNA stocks outperformed the DNA stock. The first non‐detects (reactions failing to amplify) appeared at
31.6 copies/reaction for plasmid DNA (Fig. 1A), at 0.0316 copies/reaction for synthetic RNA (Fig. 1B), and
at 0.316 copies/reaction for genomic RNA (Fig. 1C). We also observed lower Cq values for synthetic RNA
compared with genomic RNA at the same input dilution (using the supplier’s label concentration).

Of particular interest, when quantifying the synthetic RNA, we detected 3/3 positives at a dilution of just
0.1 copies/reaction, indicating a virtually impossible better‐than‐single‐molecule assay performance. An
RT‐qPCR reaction requires a minimum of 1 RNA copy as a template to exponentially amplify and generate
a detectable signal. Better‐than‐single‐molecule assay performance is highly unlikely based on statistics.
Using the Poisson distribution,[8] which accounts for the stochasticity in loading a reaction well, when
loading a solution into a well at an average target RNA concentration of 0.1 copies/reaction there is a
~9.5% chance that a reaction well actually contains at least one RNA copy. If testing a set of 3 reaction
wells, the probability that all 3 wells contains at least one RNA copy each drops to 0.086% (0.0953).

recommended by the CDC using half‐log dilution series of SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleic‐acid targets. Plots show number of
quantitation cycles (Cq) for half‐log dilutions of (A) plasmid DNA lot 508728 from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT),
(B) synthetic RNA lot 70033953 from BEI Resources (BEI), and (C) genomic RNA lot 70033700 from BEI. No‐template
controls (n=12) did not amplify after 80 cycles.

Re‐quantification of NA stocks with RT‐dPCR
To resolve the differences in LOD and understand the apparent better‐than‐single‐molecule performance
of the CDC assay, we re‐quantified the NA stocks using an RT‐dPCR protocol (Bio‐Rad dPCR EvaGreen
Supermix with added WarmStart Rtx (NEB) (Fig. 2). We first ran 16 no‐template controls and measured an
average background concentration of 1.9 ± 1.0 copies/µL. We defined the assay detection limit (99.7%
confidence) as the background concentration plus 3 standard deviations of the background,[9] and
calculated the assay detection limit of RT‐dPCR to be 4.9 copies/µL. To quantify each stock concentration,
we first diluted the NA stock down to a concentration within the digital quantification range (10 ‐ 120,000
input copies of target) and measured with RT‐dPCR.[10] We then took the concentration obtained from
the RT‐dPCR measurement, subtracted the background concentration, and multiplied the result by the
dilution factor to calculate our RT‐dPCR measured stock concentration.
We ran a dilution series for each SARS‐CoV‐2 NA stock. For plasmid DNA (IDT, lot 508528), we observed
that all RT‐dPCR quantifications were systematically lower than the concentration we expected from the
supplier’s label concentration, except when our measurements dropped below the assay detection limit
(Fig. 2A). To further validate our results, we performed 2 additional dilutions down to what should have

been 633 copies/µL. Of the three measurements taken at 633 copies/µL, two were performed using RT‐
dPCR and the third was performed using dPCR (no reverse transcription). The RT‐dPCR measurements
were 69 and 66 copies/ µL and the dPCR measurement was 65 copies/µL. As expected for DNA, there was
no difference in our measurements when using the dPCR assay with or without reverse transcription. To
reduce the contributions of Poisson noise and background signal on our quantification, we used the
highest concentration that we tested to quantify the stock concentration. Using the dilution for which we
expected 2000 plasmid DNA copies/µL, we actually measured 220 copies/µL. From this measurement, we
calculated a stock concentration of 2.2x104 copies/µL, which is 11% of the supplier’s label concentration
of 2x105 copies/µL.
For synthetic RNA (BEI, lot 70033953), we observed that all RT‐dPCR quantifications were systematically
higher than the supplier’s label concentration of 5x105 copies/µL (Fig. 2B). We performed two additional
dilutions (three in total) down to what should have been 6.33 copies/µL and observed that all three values
were higher than expected (54, 67, and 66 copies/µL). In a separate experiment, we performed dPCR (no
reverse transcriptase) and observed that the signal was below background levels, which is expected
because no amplification should occur in an RNA sample in the absence of reverse transcriptase. Using
the dilution for which we expected 2000 copies/µL (based on the label concentration), we actually
measured 15,000 copies/µL. From this measurement, we calculated a stock concentration of 3.9x106
copies/µL, which is 770% of the supplier’s label concentration of 5x105.
For genomic RNA (BEI, lot 70033700), we observed that all RT‐dPCR quantifications were systematically
higher than the supplier’s label concentration of 5.5x104 copies/µL (Fig. 2C). We performed two additional
dilutions (three in total) down to what should have been 6.33 copies/µL and observed that all three values
were higher than expected (19, 15, and 23 copies/µL). The genomic RNA in a dPCR (no reverse
transcription) experiment also measured below the background signal. Using the dilution for which we
expected 63.3 copies/µL, we actually measured 155 copies/µL. From this measurement, we calculated a
stock concentration of 1.3x105 copies/µL, which is 240% of the supplier’s label concentration of 5.5x104.

concentration (circles) for half‐log dilutions of the label concentrations (triangles) based on supplier‐reported values
of (A) plasmid DNA (lot 508728 from IDT), (B) synthetic RNA (lot 70033953 from BEI), and (C) genomic RNA (lot
70033700 from BEI). Individual dilution series were repeated twice more for the 633 copies/µL dilution with plasmid
DNA and the 6.33 copies/µL dilution for both RNA stocks. The background (solid line) was calculated by averaging
no‐template controls (n=16), and the assay detection limit (dashed line) was calculated as the background signal in
no‐template controls plus 3 standard deviations of the background signal (99.7% confidence).[9]

We next investigated potential differences among lots of stock SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA. We obtained an
additional lot of synthetic RNA (lot 70034198) and an additional lot of genomic RNA (lot 70033320) from
the same supplier (BEI). For each, we diluted the label concentration down to what should have been 63.3
copies/µL and measured the concentration with RT‐dPCR (n=1). The synthetic RNA stock (lot 70034198)
measured 38 copies/µL. From this, we calculated a concentration of 1.7x105 copies/µL, which is 57% of
the label concentration of 2.9x105 copies/µL. We note that lot 70034198 was much closer (57%) to the
label value as compared with lot 70033953 (770%). The genomic RNA stock (lot 70033320) measured 193
copies/µL. From this measurement, we calculated a concentration of 1.4x105 copies/µL, which is 300% of
the label concentration of 4.8x104 copies/µL. We found that the RT‐dPCR measurements for genomic RNA
stocks were similarly higher (240% for lot 70033700, 300% for lot 70033320) than the supplier’s label
concentration.
Dilutions of NA stocks in RT‐qPCR with RT‐dPCR correction
Next, we selected concentrations near the LOD for each NA stock, and reran RT‐qPCR with greater sample
size (N=10 for each of three dilutions of each stock, Table 1). If we use the suppliers’ label concentrations
to understand the RT‐qPCR results, we observed large deviations (orders of magnitude differences) from
expected values. For example, 3 of 10 wells turned positive for a label concentration diluted to 0.0316
copies/reaction with synthetic RNA (lot 70033953), whereas we would expect (based on statistical
calculations) for 3 out of 100 wells to be positive. We also note that only 7 of 10 wells turned positive for
a label concentration diluted to 31.6 copies/reaction with plasmid DNA (lot 528728), whereas statistically
we expect all 10 wells to turn positive (assuming single‐molecule detection). By Poisson distribution, we
would expect 1 out of every 5x1013 wells to be negative at this concentration.
If we instead use our RT‐dPCR measured concentrations to understand our RT‐qPCR results, the observed
results are statistically more likely for all 3 NA stocks. The highest tested concentrations of plasmid DNA
(lot 5208728), synthetic RNA (lot 70033953), and genomic RNA (lot 70033700) were measured by RT‐dPCR
to have concentrations of 3.45, 2.44, and 2.42 copies/reaction respectively. We observed 70%, 100%, and
90% positives for these conditions, which is a reasonable result considering that the Poisson distribution
corresponding to 3 copies/reaction predicts an expected value (most likely) of 95% positives. For the
tested concentrations measured by RT‐dPCR to be near 1 copy/reaction with an expected value of 63%
positives, we observed 30%, 80%, and 60% positives. Lastly, for the lowest tested concentrations
measured by RT‐dPCR to be near 0.3 copies/reaction with an expected value of 26% positives, we
observed 20%, 30%, and 60% positives.

the label concentrations based on the RT‐dPCR measurements reported in Fig. 2. Positives were counted as detected
if they amplified within 40 cycles. No‐template controls (N=6) did not amplify after 80 cycles.

Conclusions
In this manuscript, we observed vast discrepancies in the analytical sensitivity of the CDC‐recommended
RT‐qPCR protocol based on which commercial NA stock was used. Performing an ultrasensitive digital PCR
method, RT‐dPCR, revealed there are likely errors in the supplier‐reported concentrations. Specifically,
using RT‐dPCR, the measured concentration of plasmid DNA (IDT, lot 508728) was 11% of the label
concentration. For synthetic RNA (BEI), the measured concentration by RT‐dPCR was 770% of the label
concentration for lot 70033953, whereas it was 57% of the label concentration for lot 70034198. For
genomic RNA (BEI), the measured concentration by RT‐dPCR was 240% of the label concentration for lot
70033700 and 300% of the label concentration for lot 70033320. An underreporting of the stock
concentration could lead to an artificially improved LOD for a diagnostic assay. Such discrepancies in how
NA suppliers quantify their stock can introduce significant biases and impair proper development and
evaluation of in vitro diagnostics being considered for regulatory approvals and mass production.
The inaccurate quantification of the SARS‐nCoV‐2 genomic RNA concentration is concerning because our
analysis of EUA documents indicated that this RNA stock (BEI, NR‐52285) has been used in at least 11
EUAs: Lyra SARS‐CoV‐2 Assay, Abbott RealTime SARS‐CoV‐2 assay, AvellinoCoV2 test, NxTAG CoV

Detect SARS‐CoV‐2 rRT‐PCR Kit, BD SARS‐CoV‐2Reagents for BD MAX System, and Curative‐Korva SARS‐
Cov‐2 Assay.[4] We note that the GeneFinder COVID‐19 Plus RealAmp Kit and the STANDARD M nCoV
Real‐Time Detection Kit both report using genomic RNA, but we could not determine whether or not BEI

was the supplier. Of the kits that used BEI genomic RNA, the majority did not report the lot or starting
stock concentration (which could be used to deduce the lot number).
Discrepancies in stock quantification can be attributed to multiple factors, including differences in
quantification method, reaction conditions, reverse transcriptase efficiency, polymerase efficiency, etc.
We acknowledge that no assay is perfect (ours included), and it is virtually impossible to obtain a “true“
count of an underlying NA concentration. Nevertheless, it is possible to come close using an assay which
yields the highest NA concentration, has low background, and produces statistically plausible results. For
this, here we have successfully used ultrasensitive digital RT‐dPCR. We suggest that RT‐dPCR or a similarly
improved methodology is implemented for quantification of all RNA stocks used for SARS‐CoV‐2 assays
being submitted for emergency use authorization or equivalent regulatory approval. We also encourage
independent evaluations of in vitro diagnostic assay performance using the same quantified standards by
unbiased sources.[11]

Materials and Methods
Stocks and Dilutions
A DNA plasmid control (2019‐nCoV, research‐use only) was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies
(IDT; Coralville, Iowa, USA; Cat#148365270, Lot 0000508728; 2x105 copies/µL). Quantitative Synthetic
RNA from SARS‐Related Coronavirus 2, NR‐52358 (Lot 70033953, 5x105 genome equivalents/µL; Lot
70034198, 2.9x105 genome equivalents/µL) and Genomic RNA from SARS‐Related Coronavirus 2, Isolate
USA‐WA1/2020, NR‐52285 (Lot 70033700, 5.5x104 genome equivalents/µL; Lot 70033320, 4.8x104
genome equivalents/µL) were obtained from BEI Resources (Manassas, VA, USA). All stocks were
aliquoted and stored at ‐80 C. For all dilution series, an aliquot was thawed and serially diluted in 1x TE
buffer with 0.05% Tween‐20 in 1.5 mL DNA LoBind Tubes (USA Scientific Incorporated; Ocala, FL, USA).
RT‐qPCR
qPCR was performed using protocol recommendation from the CDC’s Real‐Time RT‐PCR Panel for
Detection of 2019‐Novel Coronavirus.[12] Briefly, 5 µL TaqPath 1‐Step RT‐qPCR Master Mix (ThermoFisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was added to 1.5 µL combined primer/probe mix (N1; Lot 0000509022 from
IDT’s 2019‐nCoV CDC qPCR Probe Assay), and 8.5 µL nuclease‐free water. Master‐mix was added to a 96‐
well plate (thin‐wall clear well, HSP9641, Bio‐Rad) and 5 µL of template was mixed by pipette in individual
wells. The 96‐well plate was sealed (Microseal B, MSB1001, Bio‐Rad) and spun briefly in a Mini Plate
Spinner Centrifuge (14‐100‐141, Fisher Scientific) to bring down droplets. Thermocycling and real‐time
imaging were performed on the Bio‐Rad CFX96 Touch Real‐Time PCR Detection System (Bio‐Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) by heating to 25 °C for 2 min, 50 °C for 15 min, 95 °C for 2 min, and cycling
80 times between 95 °C for 3 s and 55 °C for 30 s.
RT‐dPCR
RNA was quantified with reverse transcription droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (RT‐dPCR).
Reaction mix contained 1X Bio‐Rad EvaGreen ddPCR Mix, 200 nM forward and backward COVID primers
(N1 primers purchased from IDT, re‐suspended in NF‐H2O),[13] 1 U/µL Riboguard RNase inhibitor (Lucigen
Corp., Madison, WI, USA), and 300 U/mL WarmStart RTx (New England Biolabs, NEB; Ipswich, MA, USA).

Template was added at 10% of the reaction mix and the original concentration calculated from the dilution
series. All samples were made to 50 µL and duplicates were run by adding 22 µL to two sample wells in
the DG8 Cartridge (1864008, Bio‐Rad). Dilutions were quantified using the QX200 droplet digital PCR
system (Bio‐Rad) and droplet generation, droplet transfer, and foil sealing followed manufacturer’s
instructions. Thermocycling took place on a C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (Bio‐Rad) with an RT step at 55
°C for 10 min, pre‐melt at 95 °C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 30 s, and
a stabilization at 4 °C for 5 min, 90 °C for 5 min, and a hold at 12 °C until droplet analysis. A temperature
ramp rate of 2 °C/s was used for temperature transitions. Droplets were read according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Analysis thresholds were manually set to 10,000. Final concentrations were determined using
the merge setting on the QuantaSoft analysis software (Bio‐Rad). Measured stock concentrations were
calculated by subtracting background (signal average of 16 no‐template controls) and multiplying by the
dilution factor.
