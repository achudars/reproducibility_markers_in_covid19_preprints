What this paper adds
What is already know on this subject
• The COVID-19 pandemic has presented challenges to patients seeking
medication abortion, including lockdown travel restrictions and infection risk during
in-person clinic visits.
• Yet in most European countries, medication abortion must still be provided through
in-person models of care. The sole exception is Great Britain, where a fully remote
medication abortion service was introduced in response to the pandemic.
• Anecdotal reports suggest that patients are struggling to access in-person abortion
services and may turn to self-managed abortion as a result. However, to date there has
been no systematic assessment of this possibility.
What this study adds
• Our study provides the best evidence to date that demand for self-managed
medication abortion provided using online telemedicine increased following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.
• The largest increases were observed in countries where medication abortion is
provided mainly in hospitals and where travel restrictions were most stringent. By
contrast, in the one country that implemented fully remote services, demand for selfmanaged abortion declined almost to zero.
• Our findings demonstrate the urgent need for policymakers to
expand access to telemedicine models of medication abortion within the formal
healthcare setting.

Objectives: In most European countries, patients seeking medication abortion during the
COVID-19 pandemic are still expected to attend healthcare settings in person despite lockdown
measures and infection risk. We assessed whether demand for self-managed medication abortion
provided by a fully remote online telemedicine service increased following the emergence of
COVID-19.

40

Design: We used regression discontinuity to compare the number of requests to online
telemedicine service Women on Web in eight European countries before and after they
implemented lockdown measures to slow COVID-19 transmission. We examined the number
deaths due to COVID-19, the degree of government-provided economic support, the severity of
lockdown travel restrictions, and the medication abortion service provision model in countries
with and without significant changes in requests.

41

Setting: Eight European countries served by Women on Web.

42
43

Participants: 3,915 people who made requests for self-managed abortion to Women on Web
between January 1st, 2019 and June 1st, 2020.

44
45

Main Outcome Measures: Percent change in requests to Women on Web before and after the
emergence of COVID-19 and associated lockdown measures.

Results: Five countries showed significant increases in requests, ranging from 28% in Northern
Ireland (p=0.001) to 139% in Portugal (p<0.001). Two countries showed no significant change
in requests, and one country, Great Britain, showed an 88% decrease in requests (p<0.001).
Countries with significant increases in requests were either countries where abortion services are
mainly provided in hospitals or where no abortion services are available and international travel
was prohibited during lockdown. By contrast, Great Britain authorized teleconsultation for
medication abortion and provision of medications by mail during the pandemic.

53
54
55

Conclusion: These marked changes in requests for self-managed medication abortion during
COVID-19 demonstrate demand for fully remote models of abortion care and an urgent need
for policymakers to expand access to medication abortion by telemedicine.

Introduction

59

The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic posed challenges for the provision of abortion care

60

in Europe. Reallocation of resources, redeployment of staff, and social distancing requirements

61

all introduced new barriers to in-person clinic visits.1,2

62
63

Countries differed in their policy responses to these new challenges. Great Britain expanded

64

remote access to medication abortion, allowing teleconsultation with providers, and mifepristone

65

and misoprostol to be provided by mail.3-5 France extended the ability to take abortion

66

medications at home following an in-person visit with a healthcare professional from 7 weeks to

67

9 weeks of gestation.6 Germany allowed mandatory pre-abortion counselling to take place by

68

phone or video teleconsult instead of in person.7 Most other countries, however, made few

69

changes to medication abortion service models and continued to require fully in-person

70

provision, despite calls from human rights groups to prioritize patient safety and expand remote

71

access.7,8

72
73

At the same time, the economic downtown and rising unemployment across Europe in the wake

74

of the pandemic may increase demand for abortion care at a time when it is most difficult to

75

access in the clinic setting. This situation raises the possibility of an increase in abortions taking

76

place outside the formal healthcare setting. Marie Stopes International estimates that an

77

additional 2.7 million unsafe abortions will take place globally as a result of health service

78

disruptions caused by the pandemic.9

79
80

However, not all abortions that take place outside the formal healthcare settings are unsafe.

81

Medication abortion provided through online telemedicine services has been shown to be a safe

82

and effective option.10,11 Using data from one such service, we assessed whether demand for

83

online telemedicine abortion changed in eight European countries after stay-at-home restrictions

84

to slow the spread of COVID-19 were introduced.

85
86

Methods

87
88

We obtained fully de-identified data from Women on Web (WoW), a non-profit organisation

89

that provides telemedicine medication abortion services up to 10 weeks of gestation.12 The

90

service is accessed via an online form, which directly populates the database from which our data

91

were obtained. Submitted forms are screened by a doctor, and if clinical eligibility criteria are

92

met, mifepristone and misoprostol are sent by mail. In some countries, referrals are also made to

93

local in-clinic services. A donation of 70-90 Euros is requested to support the service, but may

94

be waived or reduced in cases of financial hardship. Information and support are provided via

95

email in a variety of languages by a trained helpdesk team. People accessing the service consent

96

to the fully anonymized use of their data for research purposes at the time of submitting the

97

online consultation form.

98
99

Our analytic sample includes eight countries: Germany, Hungary, Italy, Malta, The Netherlands,

100

Northern Ireland, Portugal, and Great Britain. WoW does not accept consultations from all

101

countries in Europe, because abortion is legal and normally relatively accessible in most places.

102

Among those countries that WoW does serve, some have only a few consultations requests over

103

the course of a year. We excluded countries that had too few requests to reliable detect

104

differences in request numbers between the ‘before’ and ‘after’ periods (i.e. fewer than 10

105

expected requests in the ‘after’ period). We also excluded Spain, because the Spanish

106

Government censored the WoW website during the study period and so no requests could be

107

made,13 and Poland because the number of requests made to WoW has been unstable since the

108

beginning of 2020.

109
110

We obtained the daily number of requests made to WoW from the eight countries in our sample

111

between 1st January 2019 and 1st June 2020 (the last day that lockdown measures were lifted in a

112

country included in the analysis). We excluded duplicate requests, which were identified as >1

113

request with the same information and location made within 12 hours. The number of requests

114

from each country was analysed using a regression-discontinuity design.14 We designated a

115

‘before’ period, which began on 1st January 2019 and ended on the date that each individual

116

country’s government issued their first ‘stay-at-home’ directive. The one exception was

117

Germany, where the ‘before’ period begins on 1st January 2020, due to the fact that WoW did

118

not accept consultations from Germany in until late 2019. The ‘after’ period began the first day

119

after the ‘stay-at-home’ directive was issued for each country, and ended on the first day that the

120

directives were eased in each country. ‘Stay-at-home’ directives were chosen as the threshold date

121

defining the “pre” and “post” periods, because the majority of European countries issued such a

122

directive, which posed definitive limitations on population movement and activities. Of the

123

countries included in our analytic sample, only Malta did not issue a population-wide directive,

124

and we instead used the date that the Maltese government issued a directive to close public

125

places as the discontinuity point.15

126
127

We fit a generalised linear model (GLM) for each country’s daily requests between 1st January

128

2019 ( 1st January 2020, for Germany) and the date of easing ‘stay-at-home’ restrictions. The

129

model incorporated a dummy variable for the ‘before’ v. ‘after’ period, representing a possible

130

discontinuity at the day of the ‘stay-at-home’ directive. The significance of the discontinuity for

131

each country was assessed using a likelihood ratio test to compare with a null model that did not

132

include a dummy variable for the ‘before’ v. ‘after’ period. The null model was also used to

133

generate Monte Carlo simulations for each country, which create a probability distribution of the

134

expected requests in the ‘after’ period with no discontinuity. The observed requests line would

135

be highly likely to lie within this probability distribution if there was no difference in requests

136

between the ‘before’ and ‘after’ periods. We also calculated the percentage difference between

137

observed and expected requests in the ‘after’ period. For Northern Ireland, both the null and

138

discontinuity models also included a dummy variable indicating the period after 10th April 2020,

139

because abortion services became available for the first time in Northern Ireland on this date.16

140
141

We also compiled information for each country included in the analysis on several metrics we

142

hypothesised could be related to demand for online abortion: stringency of ‘stay-at-home’

143

requirements; deaths due to COVID-19; economic assistance provided by governments in

144

response to the pandemic; 17 and abortion service provision before and during the pandemic.7,18-20

145

We examined each of these metrics across each country included in the analysis to assess their

146

relationship to changes in requests to WoW.

147
148

Data analyses were conducted using the R statistical package version 3.6.2.21 Findings were

149

considered statistically significant at an alpha level of 0.05. The study was reviewed by the

150

University of Texas at Austin Institutional Review Board and considered exempt on the basis

151

that the study is an analysis of pre-collected, fully de-identified data.

152
153

Patient involvement

154

Patients were not involved in the design or conduct of the study. However, the follow-up that

155

WoW provides is designed to address the priorities and experiences of people who access the

156

service. Thus, although this study is an analysis of secondary, de-identified data, with no direct

157

participant involvement, the research questions were informed by the needs of people who rely

158

on WoW to access abortion.

Results

162

During the data collection period, Women on Web received 3,915 requests for abortion

163

medications from the eight countries included in the analysis. Among these, we observed a

164

statistically significant increase in requests during the ‘after’ period in five countries: Hungary,

165

Italy, Malta, Portugal, and Northern Ireland (Figure 1). The magnitude of the observed increases

166

ranged from 139% above expected in Portugal to 28% above expected in Northern Ireland

167

(Table 1). In two countries (Germany, the Netherlands) there was no statistically significant

168

difference in observed compared to expected numbers of requests in the ‘after’ period (Figure 1

169

and Table 1). In one country (Great Britain), there was a statistically significant decrease in

170

requests in the ‘after’ period (Figure 1 and Table 1).

171
172

Countries that had higher numbers of COVID-19 related deaths or which provided less

173

government economic support during the pandemic did not appear to have higher numbers of

174

requests to WoW (Table 2). We did however, observe a relationship between higher numbers of

175

requests and both the location of abortion service provision, and the severity of domestic and

176

international travel restrictions (Table 2). In Italy, Portugal, and Hungary, all of which showed

177

significant increases in requests to WoW, abortion is provided mostly in the hospital setting and

178

all enacted stringent stay-at-home requirements. In Northern Ireland and Malta, where

179

significant increases in requests were also observed, in-clinic abortion services are only available

180

by traveling outside of the country, and international travel was restricted during the study

181

periods. In Germany and the Netherlands, we observed no increases in requests, abortion

182

services remained available in clinic settings, and no country-wide domestic travel restrictions

183

were enacted. In Great Britain, abortion services were made available by fully remote

184

telemedicine shortly after lockdown began and we observed a significant decrease in requests.

Discussion

188
189

During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, we observed changes in requests

190

to the WoW online telemedicine abortion service among five out of eight countries in our

191

analysis. Among countries where abortion is legally available within the formal healthcare setting,

192

we observed increased requests to the WoW online telemedicine service in those countries that

193

had more stringent stay-at-home requirements––including country-wide domestic travel

194

restrictions––and where abortion is mostly available only in the hospital setting. Among the two

195

countries where abortion was not legally available within the formal healthcare setting during the

196

study period, and where travel outside the country was restricted, we also observed an increase in

197

requests. Among countries where abortion is legally available but which enacted less stringent

198

stay-at-home policies (including no country-wide domestic travel restrictions) and where

199

abortions are provided outside the hospital setting, we observed no increases in requests. In the

200

sole country where abortion services were made available by fully remote telemedicine during the

201

study period, we observed a significant decrease in requests.

202
203

Our data provide a unique window into requests for self-managed medication abortion using

204

online telemedicine during COVID-19. Key strengths include the ability to measure changes in

205

demand for self-managed abortion from a reliable source that does not rely on self-reporting,

206

and the ability to compare data from before and after the emergence of COVID-19. An

207

important limitation, however, is that there are of course other pathways to abortion outside the

208

formal healthcare setting in Europe, including alternative sources of mifepristone and

209

misoprostol, and non-medication methods. Thus, we cannot measure all demand for self-

210

managed abortion during the pandemic. We also lack nuanced insight into the exact reasons

211

underlying changes in requests to WoW for any particular country. It is important to note that in

212

the two countries where we observed no increases in requests, people likely still encountered

213

challenges to accessing abortion services.22 Future qualitative work could address this important

214

knowledge gap.

215
216

Our results may reflect two distinct phenomena. First, in some countries, more people may be

217

seeking abortion through all channels during the pandemic. The decision to end a pregnancy

218

could be due to the perception of risk posed by COVID-19, reduced access to pre-natal care,

219

and limited social support during lockdowns.23 Additionally, decision-making could be influenced

220

by the economic downturn COVID-19 has precipitated, with many people facing unemployment

221

or financial losses.24 It has also been suggested that social distancing policies may increase rates

222

of unintended pregnancy due to increased time spent at home with a partner or reduced access

223

to contraception.25

224
225

Second, the observed increases in requests may represent a shift in demand from in-clinic

226

abortion to self-managed abortion using online telemedicine. In countries where abortion

227

services are provided predominantly or solely in hospital settings, people may have feared

228

entering a hospital due to perceived or real risk of infection. Even where limited alternatives are

229

available in the community setting––for example in Portugal, where a few private clinics offer

230

abortion services––accessing these services may still have been extremely challenging due to the

231

infection risk associated with public transport, inability to escape surveillance from a controlling

232

partner, or difficulty finding childcare while daycares and schools were closed. Moreover, in

233

countries with no abortion services, the inability to travel outside of the country to seek abortion

234

care due to travel restrictions may have led more people to seek an alternative in online

235

telemedicine. Indeed, our findings from Northern Ireland show a steep increase in requests to

236

WoW following the introduction of lockdown measures, followed by a levelling off shortly after

237

the introduction of within-country abortion services.

239

These challenges to accessing medication abortion during COVID-19, coupled with the

240

increases we observed in requests for online telemedicine are reflected in the fact that people in

241

countries where the challenges are greatest found their own solutions outside the clinic setting.

242

However, while medication abortion provided via online telemedicine is a safe and effective

243

option,10,11 it is not without legal risks.26 Its safety also depends on access to the formal healthcare

244

system when necessary, which is not guaranteed during a pandemic. Additionally, while some

245

people may prefer self-managed medication abortion, others may experience it as fraught and

246

isolating due to stigma or the threat of criminalization, or may have preferred in-clinic care.27

247

Despite the fact that the WHO recommends the use of telemedicine abortion provision models

248

during COVID-19,28 only one country in the analysis, Great Britain, responded to pandemic by

249

purposefully changing their medication abortion service to circumvent the difficulties of in-

250

person care. Following the introduction of a fully remote telemedicine service for medication

251

abortion up to 10 week’s gestation, where consultations with healthcare professionals are done

252

by phone or video, and medications are mailed or made available for pick-up from a clinic front-

253

desk, requests to WoW decreased to a single consultation. This dramatic decrease points not

254

only to the removal of access barriers posed by COVID-19, but also of pre-existing barriers.

255

Evidence from other settings suggests that similar telemedicine models for medication abortion

256

are safe, effective, and acceptable to patients.29

257
258

Conclusion

259

Our findings provide evidence in support of the need for service model changes to make

260

medication abortion more accessible during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.30 Fully

261

remote provision of early medication abortion negates the need to visit a hospital or healthcare

262

facility, thus preserving personal protective equipment, and reducing infection risks for both

263

patients and healthcare providers. Follow-up care can be provided in the clinic if necessary, and

264

patients have clear continuity of care in the rare instances that adverse events occur. Authorizing

and implementing telemedicine models within the formal healthcare setting in line with the

would ensure truly patient-centered care.
