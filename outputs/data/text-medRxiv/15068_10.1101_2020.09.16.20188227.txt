Parents’ and guardians’ views on the acceptability of a future Covid-19 vaccine: a multimethods study in England

Abstract

22

Background: The availability of a COVID-19 vaccine has been heralded as key to controlling

23

the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 vaccination programme success will rely on public

24

willingness to be vaccinated.

25

Methods: We used a multi-methods approach – involving an online cross-sectional survey

26

and semi-structured interviews - to investigate the views of parents’ and guardians’ on the

27

acceptability of a future COVID-19 vaccine. 1252 parents and guardians (aged 16+ years)

28

who reported living in England with a child aged 18 months or under completed the survey.

29

Nineteen survey respondents were interviewed.

30

Findings: Most participants reported they would definitely accept or were unsure but

31

leaning towards accepting a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves (Definitely 55.8%; Unsure but

32

leaning towards yes 34.3%) and their child/children (Definitely 48.2%; Unsure but leaning

33

towards yes 40.9%). Participants were more likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine for

34

themselves than for their child/children. Less than 4% of participants reported that they

35

would definitely not accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves or their children.

36

Participants that self-reported as Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity were

37

almost 3 times more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children

38

than White British, White Irish and White Other participants. Respondents from lower

39

income households were also more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine.

40

The main reason for vaccine acceptance was for self-protection from COVID-19. Common

41

concerns were around COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness, which were largely

42

prompted by the newness and rapid development of the vaccine.

43

Conclusion: To alleviate concerns, information on how COVID-19 vaccines are developed

44

and tested, including their safety and efficacy, must be communicated clearly to the public.

45

To prevent inequalities in uptake, it is crucial to understand and address factors that may

46

affect COVID-19 vaccine acceptability in ethnic minority lower-income groups who are

47

disproportionately affected by COVID-19.

Background

51

Over 20.6 million cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) and almost 750,000 deaths have been

52

reported globally since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to 13th August 2020 [1]. In

53

addition to the global mortality and morbidity costs attributed to COVID-19, the pandemic

54

and restrictions implemented to slow COVID-19 spread (i.e. lockdown, quarantine, curfew

55

and social distancing measures) have resulted in devastating social and economic

56

consequences. The pandemic has exacerbated global inequalities, with the world bank

57

predicting that 71 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty in 2020 [2].

58
59

According to COVID-19 mortality figures, the UK is one of the worst affected countries in the

60

world, with over 310,000 cases and 41,000 deaths reported as of 13th August 2020 [1, 3]. In

61

efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the UK, stringent restrictions on movement were

62

enforced on 23rd March 2020, with the general public directed to only leave their homes to:

63

shop for basic essentials, take one form of exercise per day, access medical care or help a

64

vulnerable person, and to travel to and from work if absolutely necessary (where unable to

65

work from home) [4]. People most at-risk from COVID-19 were asked to protect themselves

66

by shielding from 23rd March 2020: staying at home at all times, for at least 12 weeks. In

67

addition, schools were closed to all but children of key workers or vulnerable children [4].

68
69

Although restrictions to slow COVID-19 spread have eased in many countries, including the

70

UK, day-to-day life globally remains distinctly marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, and

71

measures to prevent COVID-19 spread [5]. A COVID-19 vaccine has been heralded as key to

72

ending the pandemic [6]. With an accelerated process, in which development stages take

73

place in parallel, scientists aim to produce a COVID-19 vaccine within 12-18 months, at an

74

anticipated cost of at least $3 billion for vaccine development, manufacture and delivery [7,

75

8]. In the UK, a Vaccine taskforce has been created to ‘drive forward, expedite and co-

76

ordinate efforts to research and then produce a coronavirus vaccine and make sure one is

77

made available to the public as quickly as possible’ [6]. On 20th July 2020, the UK

78

government secured early access to 90 million doses of promising COVID-19 vaccines,

79

‘giving the UK the most likely chance of getting access to a safe and effective vaccine at the

80

quickest speed’ [9].

81
82

In planning for the near-future availability of a COVID-19 vaccine, as well as focusing on how

83

to deliver COVID-19 vaccine programmes and ensure equitable vaccine allocation globally

84

[10], it is crucial to explore the acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine to the public. The success

85

of any COVID-19 vaccination programme will depend on public willingness to receive the

86

vaccination.

87
88

The priority groups to receive a future COVID-19 vaccine in the UK are frontline National

89

Health Service (NHS) workers and social care workers, and those at increased risk of COVID-

90

19 (i.e. due to age or other risk factors, including underlying health conditions). It is not

91

currently known when or if children or adults not in risk groups for COVID-19 will be eligible

92

for a COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccinating young and healthy members of the population may help

93

to prevent COVID-19 transmission to high-risk groups. We conducted a multi-methods study

94

to investigate the views of parents and guardians in England on the acceptability of a future

COVID-19 vaccine, looking at their views on receiving a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves

96

and their children.

97
98

Methods

99

We used a multi-methods approach – combining qualitative and quantitative methods –

100

with the aim of gaining a more complete insight into the acceptability of a future COVID-19

101

vaccine. The study utilised a cross-sectional questionnaire survey and semi-structured

102

interviews, to quantify the prevalence of different views on COVID-19 vaccine acceptability,

103

and to explore reasons behind these views. The questions asked regarding COVID-19

104

vaccine acceptance were part of a larger study exploring parents’ and guardians’ views and

105

perceptions towards childhood vaccinations and use of NHS general practice services for

106

childhood vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic

Cross-sectional survey

109

Recruitment

110

Survey recruitment took place between 19th April and 11th May 2020. Eligible participants

111

were required to be (1) a parent or guardian of a child (or children) aged 18 months or

112

under, (2) a resident of England, and (3) aged 16+ years.

113
114

We utilised an online social media strategy to recruit survey participants. This strategy

115

involved the creation of a Facebook page dedicated to the study with a single post

116

advertising the study, outlining the eligibility criteria for participation, and including the

117

hyperlink to the survey. An email was then sent to organisers of 284 baby and toddler play

groups in England. This contact email included a study summary and a request to share the

119

advertising post through the groups various means of communication (e.g. Facebook,

120

WhatsApp, Twitter or an email list). In addition to this, Facebook’s paid promotion feature

121

was used to target the survey at eligible potential participants.

122
123

Measures

124

The survey included demographic questions concerning age, gender, household income,

125

employment, marital status of participants, and number and age of children. Two questions

126

were designed to capture acceptance of a new COVID-19 vaccination. The text of the

127

questions read “If a new coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine became available would you accept

128

the vaccine for yourself?” and “If a new coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine became available

129

would you accept the vaccine for your child/children?”. A 4-point Likert scale was used to

130

encourage participants to take a stance on the vaccine (rather than selecting a ‘do not

131

know’ answer). The Likert scale options were “Yes, definitely”, “Unsure but leaning towards

132

yes”, “Unsure but leaning towards no” and “No, definitely not”. Open-text boxes were

133

included for participants to explain their responses to the two questions on vaccine

134

acceptability for themselves and for their children. Participants could give more than one

135

reason in the open-text boxes.

136
137

Analysis

138

A paired samples t-test was used to compare acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine for self and

139

for the participant’s child. Two subsequent logistic regressions were then conducted to

140

determine the demographic factors associated with rejection of the COVID-19 vaccine for

141

both self-vaccination and that of the participant’s child. Alpha was set to 0.05 for all tests.

142

Age, household income, ethnicity, location, and employment were included as predictive

143

variables in the logistic regression models. In the logistic regression model for child

144

vaccination, number of children was also included as a predictive variable.

145
146

To perform the logistic regressions ethnicity was dichotomised into ‘White’ (i.e. White

147

British, White Irish and White Other participants) and ‘Black, Asian or minority ethnic

148

(BAME)’ (i.e. Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity). Household income brackets

149

were reduced to a “low income” (<£35,000), “medium income” (£35,000 - £84,999) and

150

“high income” (>£85,000), and the vaccine acceptance variables were dichotomised into

151

“likely to accept” (those that answered Yes, definitely or Unsure but leaning towards yes)

152

and “likely to reject” (those that answered No, definitely not or Unsure but leaning towards

153

no).

154
155

Free text responses were analysed thematically in Microsoft Excel. Coding schemes were

156

produced based on the content of the free-text comments.

157
158

Semi-structured interviews

159

On completing the survey, participants were asked to provide their contact details if

160

interested in taking part in a follow-up semi-structured interview. Participants that had

161

expressed interest were purposively selected based on a range of characteristics, including

162

ethnicity, household income, and geographical location.

164

Participants were emailed an information sheet, fully detailing the study objectives and

165

explaining all aspects of participation, including the right to withdraw from the research.

166

Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Interviews lasted

167

approximately 30 minutes and were conducted over the phone. Topic guides, shaped

168

around the content of the questionnaire, were used to assist the interviews. Interview

169

participants received a £10 gift voucher as a thank you for their time and contribution. The

170

interviews took place between 27th April and 27th May 2020.

171
172

Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically in NVivo12 using the stages

173

outlined by Braun and Clarke [11]: data familiarisation, coding and theme identification and

174

refinement. To enhance the rigour of the analysis, coding approaches and data

175

interpretations were discussed between SB, RC, PP and SM-J.

176
177

Public involvement

178

We gained feedback from parents with young children, including children aged 18 months

179

or under, in the refinement of the survey questions and layout. This involvement aimed to

180

increase the user-friendliness and appropriateness of the survey.

181
182

Findings

183

1252 parents and guardians completed the survey (see participant characteristics in Table

184

185

(97.0%), and identified as being White British, White Irish or White Other (94.1%). The age

Quantitative findings - Acceptability of a future COVID-19 vaccination

201

A high proportion of survey participants reported that they would definitely accept or were

202

unsure but leaning towards accepting a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves (Yes, definitely

203

55.8%, n=699; Unsure but leaning towards yes 34.3%, n=429) and their child/children (Yes,

204

definitely 48.2%, n=604; Unsure but leaning towards yes 40.9%, n=512) (Table 3). Less than 1

205

in 10 participants reported that they were unsure but leaning towards rejecting or would

206

definitely reject a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves (Unsure but leaning towards no 6.2%,

207

n=78; No, definitely not 3.7%, n=46) and their child/children (Unsure but leaning towards no

220

participants that stated they would definitely accept or were leaning towards accepting a

221

COVID-19 vaccine for their child (n=1116), 925 (82.9%) gave a reason for definitely accepting

227

said they would definitely accept or were leaning towards accepting a COVID-19 vaccine for

228

their children in their survey responses (see Table 2). Interestingly, one interviewee (#19)

229

that was leaning towards accepting the vaccinate at the time of completing the survey was

230

leaning towards refusing the vaccination (for herself and her child) at the time of interview.

232

The following reasons were given for COVID-19 vaccine acceptance for self and for

233

child/children, in order of how often they were mentioned by survey participants and

234

importance to interviewees.

235

To protect self and others

236

Of survey participants expressing positive intentions to vaccinate and leaving an open-text

237

response, the most prevalent reason was to provide protection from COVID-19 to the

238

person being vaccinated (for self n=380, 42.4%; for child n=393, 42.5%), followed by

239

protecting other people (for self n=213, 23.7%; for child n=180, 19.5%), including family

240

members (for self n =109, 12.2%; for child n=49, 5.3%). Participants also reported that they

241

would vaccinate to protect someone known to them in a risk group for COVID-19 (for self

242

n=74, 8.2%; for child n=29, 3.1%). 5.0% (n=45) of survey participants specifically mentioned

243

that they wanted to receive the vaccine to stay healthy to look after their child/children.

244

Interviewees also corroborated these findings, highlighting that vaccinating would make

245

them feel safer in visiting older family members.

246
247
248
249

‘…. for us, I definitely want that. I'd want us protected as a family. You
know, my parents, his [partner’s] parents are ageing, so we'd be going to
see them, and I don’t want to put them at risk. So, certainly, I think it's
really important.’ (Interview #13)

250
251

Several survey participants cited that they would vaccinate as they were key workers (e.g.

252

involved in health and social care, education and childcare, or the food sector) and in

253

frequent contact with other people (n=60, 6.7%). Health and social care workers particularly

254

noted a need to vaccinate to protect themselves and ‘at risk’ patients and clients.

Parents’ and guardians’ views on the acceptability of a future Covid-19 vaccine: a multimethods study in England
256

Vaccination as a route to ‘returning to normal life’

257

For several interviewees, the availability of a vaccine was viewed as the only way of ending

258

social-distancing measures and returning to normal life. Interviewees talked about

259

lockdown as being financially unsustainable, and detrimental to physical and mental

260

wellbeing and children’s educational and social development. Interviewees that were

261

shielding during the pandemic were particularly keen to accept a future vaccine, with one

262

parent who had looked into entering a COVID-19 vaccine trial saying they ‘would be first at

263

the door’.

264
265

Survey participants also indicated that they would be vaccinated (n=33, 3.7%) and get their

266

children vaccinated (n=24, 2.6%) as a means of stopping the need for social distancing.

267
268

Trust and belief in the importance of vaccination

269

Survey participants indicated that they would receive the vaccine for themselves (n=46,

270

5.1%) or their child/children (n=65, 7.0%) if it was recommended by the government or

271

healthcare workers. Survey participants cited their belief in the importance of vaccination as

272

a reason to receive the vaccination themselves (n=35, 3.9%) or to vaccinate their children

273

(n=50, 5.4%).

274
275

A proportion of survey participants specifically reported trust in vaccinations, science or

276

healthcare workers as a prompt to vaccinate their child/children (n=38, 4.1%) and

277

themselves (n=24, 2.7%).

Less risk in vaccinating adults

280

Interviewees discussed a greater willingness to ‘risk’ receiving the vaccination for

281

themselves than for their children due to safety concerns. Survey participants also reported

282

the perception that it was less risky to vaccinate adults than children (n=29, 3.2%) as the

283

vaccine trials were conducted in adults.

289

Of the participants that stated they would definitely reject or were unsure but leaning

290

towards rejecting a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves, 100 left an open-text reason (80.6%)

291

and 24 did not give an open-text reason (19.4%). 124 (91.2%) gave a reason for definitely

292

rejecting or leaning towards rejecting a COVID-19 vaccine for their child and 12 did not give

293

an open-text reason (8.8%). Three interviewees reported that they were unsure but leaning

294

towards rejecting a COVID-19 vaccine for their child/children (see Table 2).

The following reasons were given for COVID-19 vaccine rejection by survey participants and

297

interviewees.

299

Vaccine safety and effectiveness concerns

300

The most common concerns expressed by survey participants about a COVID-19 vaccine

301

were around vaccine safety (for self n=49, 49.0%; for child n=77, 62.1%) and effectiveness

302

(for self n=11, 11.0%; for child n=10, 8.1%), which were largely prompted by the newness

303

and rapid development of the vaccine (for self n=50, 50.0%; for child n=84, 67.7%), and the

304

newness of COVID-19 (for self n=3, 3.0%; for child n=5, 4.0%). Participants were worried that

305

the development process might be too rapid, not allowing enough time for adequate testing

306

to confirm the vaccine’s short and long-term safety, and also vaccine effectiveness.

307
308

These concerns were echoed by interviewees who had reservations around how a vaccine

309

developed in a fraction of the usual timeline for vaccine development could be confirmed as

310

safe.

311
312
313
314
315
316
317
318

‘I'm very pro-vaccines in general, but my main concern was as long as it
hasn't been rushed through. As long as we know it' safe and all the proper
tests have been done, and, you know, when you sort of heard things in the
news like well, it's been 18 years and they haven't developed a SARS
vaccines, or whatever it was that was sort of banded around yesterday, it
sort of makes you go, why is that? So, I think that if a vaccine was to come
out like this one could do in a hurry it need to have associated information
to how this has been able to happen so quickly.’ (Interviewee #19)

319
320

Some survey participants and interviewees wanted to ‘wait-and-see’ if the vaccination was

321

safe before being vaccinated themselves, or getting their children vaccinated. One

322

interviewee discussed preferring for her family to remain in lockdown for longer (i.e. living

323

for a longer duration with the restrictions implemented on 23rd March 2020), to allow more

324

time for vaccine development and safety testing. This interviewee acknowledged this

325

situation as not a financially viable option for those unable to work from home.

327

Children less at risk of COVID-19

328

Some survey participants expressed a lack of benefit to vaccinating their children, citing that

329

children are hardly affected, are at lower risk of severe COVID-19 infection than adults

330

(n=24, 19.4%), and less likely to catch or transmit COVID-19 (n=4, 3.2%). Participants and

331

interviewees discussed the decision to vaccinate their children in terms of balancing

332

potential advantages and disadvantages. The perception that children are less at risk of

333

COVID-19 was combined with safety concerns as a reason not to vaccinate.

334
335
336
337
338
339

‘Any vaccine for covid-19 will have been produced in a huge hurry, possibly
bypassing some of the normal processes and procedures that ensure
safety. As small children have a very low risk of being seriously ill from the
virus, I'm not sure I would risk it. I would encourage my mum, who is 70
with underlying health conditions, to take it though as the risk /reward is
different.’ (Survey participant #1095)

340
341

Several survey participants indicated that they would be more likely to get their

342

child/children vaccinated if this was beneficial in reducing COVID-19 spread to older people

343

and clinical risk groups.

344
345

Low perception of risk

346

Some survey participants indicated not needing the vaccine as they (n=16, 16.0%) and their

347

child/children (n=4, 3.2%) were ‘fit and healthy’ and not in an at-risk group. 2% of

348

participants (n=2) indicated that it was better to prioritise ‘at-risk’ groups for vaccination.

350

Already had COVID-19

351

A small number of survey participants indicated that they would not accept a COVID-19

352

vaccine for themselves or their child/children as they (n=6, 6.0%) or their child (n=4, 3.2%)

353

had already had COVID-19.

354
355

Need for transparency to make an informed vaccine decision

356

To be able to make an informed choice about vaccination, parents expressed a need for

357

transparent information on vaccine development, vaccine efficacy and vaccine safety. A lack

358

of vaccine information at present was given as a reason not to accept the vaccine for a

359

minority of survey participants for their children (n=6, 4.8%) and for themselves (n=1, 1.0%).

360

One interviewee also discussed that the information should come from trusted sources such

361

as healthcare professionals, the NHS and Public Health England.

362
363
364

‘…if the NHS is telling you something you’re more likely to believe it,
whereas if it’s a politician, you know, you’ve got much more incentive to
think, “Well, are they telling the truth?” (Interviewee #17)

365
366

Lack of trust

367

A small number of survey participants stated a lack of trust in vaccinations, science or the

368

medical profession as a reason to not accept a vaccine (for self n =4, 4.0%; for child n =2,

369

1.6%).

Quantitative findings – Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine rejection for self

373

A forward stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed with a dichotomised version

374

of the self-vaccination against COVID-19 variable as the discrete variable. Age, household

375

income, ethnicity, location and employment were included as predictive variables. The final

376

model included three predictor variables (household income, employment and ethnicity) and

377

significantly predicted ‘Likely to reject’ (omnibus chi-square = 50.225, df = 7, p < .001). Age

378

and location did not significantly predict ‘Likely to reject’, as such they are excluded from

379

the model. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test demonstrates that the model adequately fits the

380

data chi-square = 4.239, df = 7, p = .752. Table 4 gives coefficients and the Wald statistic,

381

odds ratio and associated degrees of freedom for each of the predictor variables.

382
383

Participants in the lower household income bracket (<£35,000) were almost twice (OR: 2.08,

384

95%CI: 1.31 – 3.3) as likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine than participants with a medium

385

household income (£35,000-£84,999). Those in the highest income bracket (>£85,000) were

386

almost three times (OR: 0.35, 95%CI: 0.17 – 0.73) as likely to accept the vaccine as middle-

387

income bracket participants (£35,000-£84,999).

388
389

Participants that self-reported as Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity were 2.7

390

times (95%CI: 1.27 – 5.87) more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine than White British,

391

White Irish and White Other participants. There was also some indication that those that

392

identify their employment as homemaker were more likely to reject the vaccination than

393

those in full time employment or on parental leave from full time employment.

Quantitative findings – Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine rejection for child

396

A forward stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed with a dichotomised version

397

of the child vaccination against COVID-19 variable as the discrete variable. Age, household

398

income, ethnicity, location, employment and number of children were included as predictive

399

variables. The final model included three predictor variables (income, ethnicity and number

400

of children) and significantly predicted ‘Likely to reject’ (omnibus chi-square = 37.896, df = 6,

401

p < .001). Age, location and employment did not significantly predict ‘Likely to reject’, as

402

such they were excluded from the model. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test demonstrates that

403

the model adequately fits the data chi-square = 1.502, df = 6, p = .958. Table 5 gives

404

coefficients and the Wald statistic and associated degrees of freedom and probability values

for each of the predictor variables.

407

Similarly, to accepting a novel covid-19 vaccination for themselves, participants that self-

408

reported as Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity were 2.74 times (95%CI: 1.35 –

409

5.57) more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine for their child than White British, White Irish

410

and White Other participants. This finding was also found for income, with participants in

411

the lower household income bracket (<£35,000) being 1.8 times (95%CI: 1.17 – 2.82) as

412

likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine for their child than participants with a medium household

413

income (£35,000-£84,999). Participants with more than four children were also found to be

414

around four times (OR 4.13; 95%CI: 1.873 – 9.104) more likely to reject the vaccination for

415

their children than those with only one child, however, caution should be taken with this

416

finding due to the small sample size.

418

Discussion

419

In this mixed methods study, the majority of parents and guardians reported they would

420

definitely accept or were unsure but leaning towards accepting a COVID-19 vaccine for

421

themselves (Yes, definitely 55.8%, n=699; Unsure but leaning towards yes 34.3%, n=429) and

422

their child/children (Yes, definitely 48.2%, n=604; Unsure but leaning towards yes 40.9%,

423

n=512). Less than 4% of parents and guardians reported that they would definitely not

424

accept a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves or their children.

425
426

Attitudes towards a COVID-19 vaccine appear more positive in our study (in terms of the

427

proportion of participants reporting they would definitely accept or were leaning towards

428

accepting vaccination) than those reported in surveys conducted with adults in France,

429

Germany, Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands and the US [12-14], and comparable to reports

430

from Denmark and Australia [13, 15]. However, this could be due to differences in the

431

questions asked; highlighting the need for cross-country surveys and consistency in the

432

wording of questions. These surveys indicate that the difference in vaccination acceptance

433

ranges greatly between countries, from around 62% in France to 80% in Denmark and the

434

UK [13], and are reflective of trust in vaccines and health systems more broadly, and in

435

governments. More positive attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination in our study appear to

436

reflect the high level of parent trust in vaccines in the UK, and trust in the NHS.

437
438

The main reasons, or ‘pros’ for vaccinating, were to protect the individual being vaccinated

439

against COVID-19, followed by protecting others from the disease. Uncertainties around

440

vaccine safety, effectiveness, and the benefit of vaccinating children were the most

441

prevalent reasons given for COVID-19 vaccine refusal. Safety and effectiveness concerns

442

were prompted by fears that the accelerated vaccine development process, considered

443

politically motivated, could result in cutting corners. Comparably, previous research also

444

suggests that people consider older vaccines safer than newer ones [16, 17], and highlights

445

the importance of transparency in communicating about the vaccine development process

446

and of vaccination safety testing.

447
448

When a COVID-19 vaccine is launched, should any safety signals or safety concerns arise, it

449

will be key for government and public health officials to reassure the public with

450

transparency, action, accountability and timeliness in order to avoid any detrimental impact

451

of the new vaccine on the current national immunisation programme. The Dengvaxia

452

controversy in the Philippines highlights how safety concerns around a newly launched

453

vaccine, Dengvaxia, can derail a successful national immunisation programme leading to

454

drops in childhood vaccine uptake, and even spill over to other health care treatments [18].

455
456

Other surveys have identified that views on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance are influenced by

457

vaccine efficacy and perceptions of disease risk. In a cross-sectional survey conducted in

458

Indonesia, Harapan et al [19] found that 93.3% of participants would receive a COVID-19

459

vaccine that was 95% effective but only 67.0% of participants would accept a 50% effective

460

vaccine. The authors also found that acceptance was higher amongst participants that

461

considered themselves at greater risk of COVID-19 infection.

Parents’ and guardians’ views on the acceptability of a future Covid-19 vaccine: a multimethods study in England
463

In our study, lower levels of vaccine acceptance for children were discussed by parents in

464

terms of children being at lower-risk of COVID-19. Evidence suggests that children have

465

lower susceptibility to COVID-19 [20], very few children develop severe COVID-19 (even if

466

they are in a clinical risk group), and their role in the transmission of COVID-19 is unclear

467

[21]. Similarly with influenza vaccination, parents and guardians in our study more often

468

considered the perceived benefits to their child, rather than societal benefits, as a reason to

469

vaccinate their children [22].

470
471

Acting now to prevent inequalities in COVID-19 vaccine uptake

472

We found that participants of Black, Asian, Chinese, Mixed or Other ethnicity reported were

473

more likely to reject a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their child/children compared

474

to White participants (i.e. White British, White Irish or White Other). Comparably, lower

475

levels of COVID-19 vaccine acceptability in Black African and lower income groups have

476

been reported in US based surveys [14]. This is of concern given the evidence that Black,

477

Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups and people living in the most deprived areas are at

478

higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection and at increased risk of death from COVID-19

479

[21]. Inequalities in vaccination uptake amongst BAME communities [23-26] and lower

480

income groups [26, 27] already exist for certain vaccines and a concerted effort must be

481

made to understand factors affecting vaccine acceptance and prevent ethnic inequalities in

482

uptake of a future COVID-19 vaccine. We were unable to explore ethnic differences in

483

COVID-19 vaccine acceptance due to insufficient representation of ethnic minority groups in

484

writing free-text responses and agreeing to participate in interviews.

486

Strengths and limitations

487

The quality of the study was enhanced through the use of a multi-methods approach in

488

which interview and open-text responses were used to develop insight into factors

489

underpinning quantitative responses. Our study took place at the height of the COVID-19

490

pandemic in England and a survey repeated now that we are ‘past the peak’ of COVID-19

491

cases and deaths and lockdown has been eased may yield different responses. This has

492

already been indicated in the second wave of a large European survey looking at COVID-19

493

vaccine attitudes [28]. This highlights the need for longitudinal studies to measure the

494

acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine at different intervals.

495
496

Our recruitment strategy, using social media, achieved a high number of responses

497

(n=1252). Although geographically representative, our participants were not overly

498

representative in terms of household income and ethnicity. This meant that it was not

499

possible to explore differences in vaccination views by ethnicity and household income

500

when looking at open-text responses and conducting interviews.

501
502

Conclusion

503

The success of COVID-19 vaccination programmes will rely heavily on public willingness to

504

accept the vaccine. The main concerns raised by parents in our study were around the

505

safety and effectiveness of a ‘rushed’ and new COVID-19 vaccine. To alleviate these

506

concerns, there needs to be clear communication and transparency as to how COVID-19

507

vaccines are developed and tested, and safety and efficacy information.

Opening up a conversation with members of the public at an early stage is key to

510

understanding factors that may affect vaccine acceptability, and developing approaches to

511

allay any concerns. This must happen in parallel with efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.

512

Importantly, efforts must be made to understand and address factors that may affect

513

COVID-19 vaccine uptake in Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups and lower-income

households who are disproportionately affected by COVID-19.
