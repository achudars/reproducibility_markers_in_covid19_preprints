Abstract
Currently, there are no approved specific antiviral agents for 2019 novel coronavirus disease
(COVID-19). In this study, ten severe patients confirmed by real-time viral RNA test were enrolled
prospectively. One dose of 200 mL convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered
donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an
addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of
CP transfusion. The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory
parameters within 3 days after CP transfusion. The median time from onset of illness to CP
transfusion was 16.5 days. After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly
up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). The
clinical symptoms were significantly improved along with increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation
within 3 days. Several parameters tended to improve as compared to pre-transfusion, including
increased lymphocyte counts (0.65×109/L vs. 0.76×109/L) and decreased C-reactive protein (55.98
mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L). Radiological examinations showed varying degrees of absorption of lung
lesionswithin 7 days. The viral load was undetectable after transfusion in seven patients who had
previous viremia. No severe adverse effects were observed. This study showed CP therapy was
welltolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in
severe COVID-19 cases. The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP
therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.
Significance Statement
COVID-19is currently a big threat to global health. However, no specific antiviral agents are
available for its treatment. In this work, we explored the feasibility of convalescent plasma (CP)
transfusion to rescue severe patients. The results from 10 severe adult cases showed that one
dose (200 mL) of CP was welltolerated and could significantly increase or maintain the neutralizing
antibodies at a high level, leading to disappearance of viremia in 7 days. Meanwhile, clinical
symptoms and paraclinical criteria rapidly improved within 3 days. Radiological examination

showed varying degrees of absorption of lung lesions within 7 days. These results indicate that CP
can serve as a promising rescue option for severe COVID-19 while the randomized trial is
warranted.

Main Text
Introduction
Since December 2019, a pneumonia associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), named as 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) by World
Health Organization (WHO), emerged in Wuhan, China (1-3). The epidemic spread rapidly
worldwidewithin three months and was characterized as a pandemic by WHO on March 11,2020.As
of March 12, 2020, a total of80,980confirmed cases and 3,173deaths had been reported in China.
Meanwhile, a total of 44,377 confirmed cases and 1,446 deaths was reported in other 108 countries
or regions.Currently, there are no approved specific antiviral agents targeting the novel virus, while
some drugs are still under investigation, including remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir (4, 5). Although
remdesivirwas reported to possess potential antiviral effectin one COVID-19 patient from the U.S.,
randomized controlled trials of this drug are ongoing to determine its safety and efficacy (6).
Moreover, the corticosteroid treatment for COVID-19 lung injury remains controversial, due to
delayed clearance of viral infection and complications(7,8). Since the effective vaccine and specific
antiviral medicines are unavailable, it is an urgent need to look for an alternative strategy for
COVID-19 treatment, especially amongsevere patients.
Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy, a classic adaptiveimmunotherapy, has been applied to the
prevention and treatment of many infectious diseases for more than one century. Over the past two
decades,CP therapy was successfully used in the treatment of SARS, MERS, and 2009 H1N1
pandemic with satisfactory efficacy and safety (9-12). A meta-analysis from 32 studies of SARS
coronavirus infection and severe influenza showed a statistically significant reduction in the pooled
odds of mortality following CP therapy, compared with placebo or no therapy (odds ratio, 0.25; 95%
confidence interval, 0.14-0.45) (13). However, the CP therapy was unable to significantly improve
the survival in the Ebola virus disease, probably due to the absence of data of neutralizing
antibodytitrationfor stratified analysis (14). Since the virological and clinical characteristics share
similarity among SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 (15), CP therapy might be a promising treatment
option for COVID-19 rescue(16). Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 with a high
neutralizing antibody titermay bea valuable donor source of CP. Nevertheless, the potential clinical
benefit and risk of convalescent blood products in COVID-19 remains uncertain. Hence, we
performed this pilot study in three participated hospitals to explore the feasibility of CPtreatment in
10 severe COVID-19 patients.

Results

Neutralizing activity of CP against SARS-CoV-2
The neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated by classical plaque reduction test
using a recently isolated viral strain (1). Among the first batch of CP samples from 40 recovered
COVID-19 patients, 39 showed high antibody titers of at least 1:160 whereas only one had a
antibody titer of 1:32. This result laid the basis for our pilot clinical trial using CP in severe patients.
General characteristics of Patients in the trial
From January 23, 2020, to February 19, 2020, ten severe COVID-19 patients (six males and four
females) were enrolled and received CP transfusion. The median age was 52.5 years (IQR, 45.0–
59.5 years) (Table 1). None of the patients had direct exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale
Market. The median time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission and CP transfusion was 6
days (IQR, 2.5–8.5 days) and 16.5 days (IQR11.0–19.3 days), respectively. Three patients were
affected by clustering infection. The most common symptoms at disease onset were fever (seven
of ten patients), cough (eight cases), and shortness of breath (eight cases), while less common
symptoms included sputum production (five cases), chest pain (two cases), diarrhea (two cases),
nausea and vomiting (two cases), headache (one case), and sore throat (one case). Four patients
had underlying chronic diseases, including cardiovascular and/or cerebrovascular diseases and
essential hypertension. Nine patients received arbidolmonotherapy or combination therapy with
remdesivir (in one case not included in the current clinical trial), or ribavirin,or peramivir, while one
patient received ribavirin monotherapy(Table 2). Antibacterial or antifungal treatment was used
when patients had co-infection. Six patients received intravenousmethylprednisolone (20 mg every
24 hrs).
On computer-assisted tomography (CT), all patients presented bilateral ground-glass opacity
and/or pulmonary parenchymal consolidation with predominantly subpleural and bronchovascular
bundles distribution in the lungs. Seven patients had multiple lobe involvement and four patients
had interlobular septal thickening.
Effects of CP transfusion
Improvement of clinical symptomsAll symptoms inthe 10 patients, especially fever, cough,
shortness of breath and chest pain, disappeared or largely improved within 1-3 days upon CP
transfusion. Prior toCP treatment, three patients received mechanical ventilation, three received

high-flow nasal cannula oxygenation, and two received conventional low-flow nasal cannula
oxygenation. After treatmentwith CP, two patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation to
high-flow nasal cannula and one patient discontinued high flow nasal cannula. Besides, in one
patient treated with conventional nasal cannula oxygenation, continuous oxygenation was shifted
to intermittent one (Table 2).
Reduction of pulmonary lesions on chest CT examinationsAccording to chest CTs, all patients
showed different degrees of absorption of pulmonary lesions after CP transfusion. Representative
chest CT images of patient 9 and patient 10 were shown on Fig. 1. Patient 9, a 49-year-old female
admitted on 1 day post onset of illness (dpoi), showed the most obvious pulmonary image
improvement. On 10 dpoi, one dose of 200 mL transfusion of CP was given. The SARS-CoV-2
RNA converted to negative on 12 dpoi. Compared with the result on 7 dpoi, massive infiltration and
ground-glass attenuation disappeared on CT image performed on 13 dpoi, accompanied bya much
better pulmonary function. Patient 10, a 50-year-old male, was admitted on 3 dpoi and was given
a 200 mL transfusion of CP on 20 dpoi. His chest CT presented massive infiltration and widespread
ground-glass attenuation on admission andstarted to show a gradual absorption of lung lesions 5
days after CP transfusion. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA became negative on 25 dpoi.
Amelioration ofroutine laboratory criteria and pulmonary functionLymphocytopenia, an
important index for prognosis inCOVID-19 (2), tended to beimprovedafter CP transfusion (median:
0.65×109 per L vs. 0.76×109 per L), seven out of ten patients showingan increase of lymphocyte
counts (Fig. 2). Concerning other laboratory tests, we observed a tendency of decrement of
parameters indicative of inflammation and/or liver dysfunction as compared to the statusbefore CP
therapy. These included C-reactive protein (CRP) (median: 55.98 mg/L vs. 18.13 mg/L), alanine
aminotransferase (median: 42.00 U/L vs. 34.30 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (median:
38.10 U/L vs. 30.30 U/L) (Table 3). The total bilirubin (median: 12.40 μmol/L vs. 13.98 μmol/L)
remained unchanged except an obvious increment in patient 1 (Fig. 2). An increase of SaO2
(median:93.00% vs. 96.00%), a measurement constantly performed in most patients in our trial,
was found, which could indicaterecovering lung function.This temporal relationship was notable
despite the provision of maximal supportive care and antiviral agents.
Remarkably, patient 1, a 46-year-old male admitted on 8 dpoi, had a very quick recovery with much
improved result of laboratory tests. He received antiviral drugs (arbidol and ribavirin) treatment and
high flow nasal cannula on admission. Mechanical ventilation was given on 10 dpoi for critical care
support. CP transfusion was performed on 11 dpoi. On 12 dpoi, the SARS-CoV-2test turned to
negative, with a sharp decrease of CRP from 65.04 mg/L to 23.57 mg/L and incrementof SaO2 from
86% to 90% (Fig. 3). The mechanical ventilation was successfully weaned off 2 days after CP

transfusion. On 15 dpoi, a steady elevation oflymphocyte count and a drop ofaminopherase
levelwere observed, indicating improvement ofimmunological and hepatic function.
Increase of neutralizing antibody titers and disappearanceof SARS-CoV-2 RNAWe
determined neutralizing antibody titers before and after CP transfusion in all patients except one
(patient2) (Table 4). The neutralizing antibody titers of five patients increased and four patients
remained atthe same level after CP transfusion.SARS-CoV-2 RNA, assayed by reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), was positive in seven patients and negative in
three cases before CP transfusion. Of note, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was decreased to anundetectable
level in 3 patients on day 2, 3 patients on day 3 and 1 patients on day 6 after CP therapy.These
results were in support of anneutralizing effectof CP on serum SARS-CoV-2.
Outcome of patients treated with CP as compared to a recent historic control groupAhistoric
control group was formed by random selection of10 patients from the cohort treated in the same
hospitals andmatched by age, gender and severity of the diseases to the 10 cases in our trial.
Baseline characteristics of patients between CP treatment group and control group showed no
significant differences, while clinical outcomesof these two groups weredifferent: 3 cases
dischargedwhile 7 cases in much improved status and ready for discharge in CP group, as
compared to 3 deaths, 6 cases in stablized status and one case in improvement in the control group
(p<0.001, Supplementary table 1).

Adverse effects of CP transfusions
Patient 2 showed an evanescent facial red spot. No serious adverse reactions or safety events
were recorded after CP transfusion.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the feasibility of CP therapy in COVID-19. All
enrolled severe COVID-19 patients achieved primary and secondary outcomes. One dose of 200
mL CP transfusion was welltolerated, while the clinical symptoms significantly improved with the
increase of oxyhemoglobin saturation within 3 days, accompanied by rapid neutralization of viremia.
Severe pneumonia caused by human coronavirus was characterized by rapid viral replication,
massive inflammatory cell infiltration, and elevated proinflammatory cytokines or even cytokine
storm in alveoli of lungs, resulting in acute pulmonary injury and acute respiratory distress

syndrome (ARDS) (17). Recent studies on COVID-19 demonstrated that the lymphocyte counts in
the peripheral blood were remarkably decreased and the levels of cytokines in the plasma from
patients requiring ICU support, including IL-6, IL-10, TNF-ɑ, GM-CSF, were significantly higher than
those who did not require ICU conditions (2, 18). CP, obtained from recovered COVID-19 patients
who had established humoral immunity against the virus, contains a large quantity of neutralizing
antibodies capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 and eradicating the pathogen from blood
circulation and pulmonary tissues (19). In the present study, all investigated patients achieved
serum SARS-CoV-2 RNA negativity after CP transfusion, accompanied by the increase of oxygen
saturation and lymphocyte counts, and the improvement of liver function and C-reactive protein.
The results suggested that the inflammation and overreaction of the immune system were
alleviated by antibodies contained in CP. The case-fatality rates (CFRs) in the present study were
0% (0/10), which was comparable to the CFRs in SARS which varied from 0% (0/10) to 12.5%
(10/80) in four non-comparative studies using CP treatment (9, 20-22). Based on our preliminary
results, CP therapy can be an easy-accessible, promising and safe rescue option for severe
COVID-19 patients. It is nevertheless worth mentioning that the absorption of pulmonary lesions
was often behind the improvement of clinical symptoms, as shown in patients 9 and 10 in this trial.
The first key factor associated with CP therapy is the neutralizing antibody titer. A small sample
study in MERS-CoV infection showed that the neutralizing antibody titer should exceed 1:80 to
achieve effective CP therapy (12). To find eligible donors who have high levels of neutralizing
antibody is a prerequisite. Cao (23) et al showed that the level of specific neutralizing antibody to
SARS-CoV decreased gradually 4 months after the disease process, reaching undetectable levels
in 25.6% (IgG) and 16.1% (neutralizing antibodies) of patients at 36 months after disease status. A
study from the MERS-CoV infected patients and the exposed healthcare workers showed that the
prevalence of MERS-CoVIgGseroreactivity was very low (2.7%), and the antibodies titer decreased
rapidly within 3 months (24). These studies suggested that the neutralizing antibodies represented
short-lasting humoral immune response and plasma from recently recovered patients should be
more effective. In the present study, recently recovered COVID-19 patients, who were infected by
SARS-CoV-2 with neutralizing antibody titer above 1:640and recruited from local hospitals should
be considered as suitable donors. The median age of donors was lower than that of recipients (42.0
vs. 52.5 years). Among the nine cases investigated, the neutralizing antibody titers of five patients
increased while four patients kept the same level to 1:640 within two days. The antibody titers in
CP in COVID-19 seem thus higher than those used in the treatment of MERS patient (1:80) (12).
The second key factor associated with efficacy is the treatment time point. A better treatment
outcome was observed among SARS patients who were given CP before 14 dpoi (58.3% vs 15.6%;
P < 0.01), highlighting the importance of timely rescue therapy (9). The mean time from onset of
illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 days. Consistent with previous research, all three patients

receiving plasma transfusion given before 14 dpoi (patients 1, 2 and 9) in our study showed a rapid
increase of lymphocyte counts and a decrease of CRP, with remarkable absorption of lung lesions
in CT. Notably, patients who received CP transfusion after 14 dpoi showed much less significant
improvement, such as patient 10. However, the dynamics of the viremia of SARS-CoV-2 was
unclear, so the optimal transfusion time point needs to be determined in the future.
In the present study, no severe adverse effects were observed. One of the risks of plasma
transfusion is the transmission of the potential pathogen. Methylene blue photochemistry was
applied in this study to inactivate the potential residual virus and to maintain the activity of
neutralizing antibodies as much as possible, a method known to be much better than ultraviolet C
light (25). No specific virus was detected before transfusion. Transfusion-related acute lung injury
(TRALI) was reported in an Ebola virus disease woman who received CP therapy (26). Although
uncommon in the general population receiving plasma transfusion, this specific adverse reaction is
worth noting, especially among critically illed patients experiencing significant pulmonary injury (27).
Another rare risk worth mentioning during CP therapy is antibody-dependent infection
enhancement, occurring at sub-neutralizing concentrations, which could suppress innate antiviral
systems and thus could allow logarithmic intracellular growth of the virus (28). The special immune
enhancement was reportedly more common in Dengue fever, but also could be found in SARSCoV infection in vitro (29). No such pulmonary injury and infection enhancement were observed in
our patients, probably owing to high levels of neutralizing antibodies, timely transfusion, and
appropriate plasma volume.
There were some limitations to the present study. First, except for CP transfusion, the patients
received other standard cares. All patients received antiviral treatment despite the uncertainty of
the efficacy of drugs used. As a result, the possibility thatthese antiviral agents could contribute to
the recovery of patients, or synergize with the therapeutic effect of CP, could not be ruled out.
Furthermore, some patients received glucocorticoid therapy, which might interfere with immune
response and delay virus clearance. Second, the median time from onset of symptoms to CP
transfusion was 16.5 days (IQR11.0-19.3 days). Although the kinetics of viremia during natural
history remains unclear, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 RNA reduction and CP therapy,
as well asthe optimal concentration of neutralizing antibodies and treatment schedule, should be
further clarified. Third, the dynamic changes of cytokines during treatment were not investigated.
Nevertheless, the preliminary results of this trial seem promising, justifying a randomized controlled
clinical trial in a larger patient cohort.
In conclusion, this pilot study on CP therapy showed a potential therapeutic effect and low risk in
the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients. One dose of CP with high concentration of neutralizing

antibodies can rapidly reduce the viral load and tends to improve clinical outcomes. The optimal
dose and treatment time point, as well as the definite clinical benefits of CP therapy, need to be
further investigated in randomized clinical studies.
Materials and Methods
Patients
From January 23, 2020, to February 19, 2020, ten patients in three participating hospitals (Wuhan
Jinyintan Hospital, the Jiangxia District Hospital of Integrative Traditional Chinese and Western
Medicine, Wuhan, and the First People's Hospital of Jiangxia District, Wuhan) were recruited in this
pilot study. All patients were diagnosed as having severe COVID-19 according to the WHO Interim
Guidance (30) and the Guideline of Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 of National Health
Commission of China (version 5.0) (31), with confirmation by real-time RT-PCR assay. The
enrollment criteria were one of the conditions (2 to 4) plus condition (1): 1). Age ≥18 years;
2).Respiratory distress, RR ≥30 beats/min; 3).Oxygen saturation level less than 93% in resting
state; 4). Partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/oxygen concentration (FiO2) ≤300 mmHg (1
mmHg=0.133 kPa). The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1). Previous allergic history to plasma
or ingredients (Sodium Citrate); 2). Cases with serious general conditions, such as severe organ
dysfunction, who were not suitable for CP transfusion; Written informed consent according to the
Declaration of Helsinki was obtained from each patient or legal relatives. This study was approved
by the Ethics Committee of the China National Biotec Group Co., Ltd. (Approval number:20200001). The registration number of this trial was ChiCTR2000030048.
Donors for convalescent plasma transfusion
Tendonor patients who recovered from COVID-19 were recruited from three participating hospitals.
The recovery criteria were as follows: 1). Normality of body temperature for more than 3 days; 2).
Resolution of respiratory tract symptoms; 3). Two consecutively negative results of sputum SARSCoV-2 of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay (one-day
sampling interval). The donor's blood was collected after three weeks post-onset of illness and 4
days post-discharge. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient.
Plasma preparation procedure and quality control
Apheresis was performed using a Baxter CS 300 cell separator (Baxter, Deerfield, IL, USA).
Convalescence plasma for treatment was collected from 40donors. The median age was 42.0 years
(IQR, 32.5–49 years). A 400–600 mL ABO-compatible plasma sample was harvested from each

donor depending on the age and body weight, and each sample was divided and stored as 200 mL
aliquots at 4℃ without any detergent or heat treatment. The CP was then treated with methylene
blue and light treatment for 30 minutes in the medical plasma virus inactivation cabinet (Shandong
Zhongbaokang Medical Appliance Co., Ltd).
Serology test and real-time RT–PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens
The neutralized activity of plasma was determined by plaque reduction neutralization test using
SARS-CoV-2 virusin the high biosafy level (BSL-4) laboratory of Wuhan Institute of Virology,
Chinese Academy of Sciences.Neutralization titer was defined as the highest serum dilution with
50 % reduction in the number of plaques, as compared with the number of plaques in wells in the
absence of novel coronavirus antibody as blank control. The neutralization activity of the receptorbinding domain (RBD) of antibody in the CP was detected by a sandwich ELISA.SARS-CoV-2-IgG
antibody titer was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected
by RT-PCR assay and the result was presented as cycle threshold (Ct) value (Shanghai BioGerm
Medical Biotechnology Co., Ltd). Methylene blue residue was detected by the verified ultraviolet
method. The serology screening for hepatitis B and C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and
syphilis spirochete was negative. The protocols for SARS-CoV-2 serology and RNAtest are
presented in the supplementary materials.
Treatment
All patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and received antiviral therapy and other
supportive care, while somepatients received antibiotic treatment, antifungal treatment,
glucocorticoid and oxygen support at the appropriate situation. One dose of 200 mL inactivated CP
with neutralization activity >1:640 was transfused into the patients within 4 hours following the WHO
blood transfusion protocol.
Data collection
Clinical information of all enrolled patients was retrieved from the hospital electronic history system,
including the baseline demographic data, days of illness duration, presenting symptoms, different
kinds of examination and methods of treatment. Bacterial co-infection was identified by a positive
culture from respiratory, urinary or blood culture within 48h of hospital admission. Complications
including acute renal failure, acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, acute respiratory distress
syndrome, and nosocomial infection were recorded. The applications of assisted mechanical
ventilation, intranasal oxygen inhalation, and medication regimen were recorded. The SARS-CoV2 RNA from the serum sample was monitored during treatment.

Outcome Measures and Definitions
The clinical symptoms were recorded by attending physicians daily. The blood test and biochemical
tests were carried out every 1-2 days. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected every 2-3 days. CT scan
was repeated every 3-5 days. The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. The second
endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms, laboratory and radiological parameters
within 3 days after CP transfusion.

The clinical symptoms improvement was defined as

temperature normalization, relief of dyspnea, and oxygen saturation normalization, and the
radiological improvement was defined as different degrees of absorption of lung lesions.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were presented as the median and interquartile range (IQR). Graphs were
plotted using GraphPad Prism 7.0. Statistical software used included SPSS 24.0.
