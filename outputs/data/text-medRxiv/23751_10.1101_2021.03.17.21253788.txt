Abstract
Background: There is ongoing controversy regarding the potential for increased respiratory
effort to generate patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) in spontaneously breathing
patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory failure. However, direct clinical evidence linking
increased inspiratory effort to lung injury is scarce. We adapted a recently developed
computational simulator that replicates distinctive features of COVID-19 pathophysiology to
quantify the mechanical forces that could lead to P-SILI at different levels of respiratory
effort. In accordance with recent data, the simulator was calibrated to represent a
spontaneously breathing COVID-19 patient with severe hypoxaemia (SaO2 80.6%) and
relatively well-preserved lung mechanics (lung compliance of 47.5 ml/cmH2O), being treated
with supplemental oxygen (FiO2 = 100%).
Results: Simulations were conducted at tidal volumes (VT) and respiratory rates (RR) of 7
ml/kg and 14 breaths/min (representing normal respiratory effort) and at VT/RR of 15/14,
7/20, 15/20, 10/30, 12/30, 10/35, 12/35, 10/40, 12/40 ml/kg / breaths/min. Lung compliance
was unaffected by increased VT but decreased significantly at higher RR. While oxygenation
improved, significant increases in multiple indicators of the potential for lung injury were
observed at all higher VT/RR combinations tested. Pleural pressure swing increased from
10.1 cmH2O at baseline to 30 cmH2O at VT/RR of 15 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min and to 54.6
cmH2O at 12 ml/kg / 40 breaths/min. Dynamic strain increased from 0.3 to 0.49 at VT/RR of
12 ml/kg / 30 breaths/min, and to 0.6 at 15 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min. Mechanical power
increased from 7.83 J/min to 17.7 J/min at VT/RR of 7 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min, and to 240.5
J/min at 12 ml/kg / 40 breaths/min.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that the forces generated during increased inspiratory effort
in severe COVID-19 are compatible with the development of P-SILI. If conventional oxygen
therapy or non-invasive ventilation is ineffective in reducing respiratory effort, control of

Keywords: COVID-19, acute respiratory failure, hypoxaemia, patient self-inflicted lung
injury

Introduction
On admission, some patients with COVID-19 acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure (AHRF)
exhibit profound hypoxaemia, combined with relatively preserved lung compliance and lung
gas volume on CT chest imaging, and substantial increases in respiratory effort - tidal
volumes (VT) up to 20 ml/kg (1) and respiratory rates (RR) exceeding 24 breaths/min (2)
have been reported. There is currently significant debate regarding whether such increased
respiratory effort could risk causing further damage to the lungs through patient self-inflicted
lung injury (P-SILI) (3-11).
Direct evidence for the existence of P-SILI in the context of purely spontaneous breathing is
largely based on animal studies (12), although two studies in asthmatic children suggested
that increased breathing effort could promote negative pressure pulmonary oedema (13, 14).
A number of studies have also established the potential for injurious effects due to
spontaneous breathing during mechanical ventilation in acute respiratory failure (15). In the
context of COVID-19, a recent study has asserted an association between increased
respiratory effort and worsening of respiratory function during attempts to wean patients
from mechanical ventilation, although without definitively establishing a delineation between
cause and effect (9-11, 16). Two recent case reports also noted the existence of spontaneous

pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 patients, suggesting the generation of
injurious transpulmonary pressures (17, 18).
To obtain some additional evidence with which to inform debate on this issue, we
hypothesised that a computational model of COVID-19 pathophysiology could be used to
investigate the effects of increased respiratory effort on parameters that have been associated
with lung injury, namely tidal swings in pleural and transpulmonary pressure, and maximum
values of mechanical power (19) and dynamic strain.

Methods
The core model used in this study is a multi-compartmental computational simulator that has
been previously used to simulate mechanically ventilated patients with various pulmonary
disease states (20-27), including COVID-19 ARDS (28). The simulator offers several
advantages, including the capability to define a large number of alveolar compartments (each
with its own individual mechanical characteristics), with configurable alveolar collapse,
alveolar stiffening, disruption of alveolar gas-exchange, pulmonary vasoconstriction and
vasodilation, and airway obstruction. As a result, several defining, clinical features of acute
lung injury can be represented in the model, including varying degrees of ventilation
perfusion mismatch, physiological shunt and deadspace, alveolar gas trapping with intrinsic
positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), collapse-reopening of alveoli etc. A detailed
description of the physiological principles and mathematical equations underlying the
computational model implemented in the simulator is provided in the supplementary file.
For the current study, the model was configured to represent a patient of 70 kg ideal body
weight with COVID-19 acute respiratory failure. Based on currently available data regarding
potential pathophysiological mechanisms e.g. (29-34), the model provides a heterogeneous
disease profile distributed across 100 gas-exchanging compartments implementing (a)

vasodilation leading to hyperperfusion of collapsed lung regions, (b) disruption of hypoxic
pulmonary vasoconstriction, with hypoperfusion of normally aerated lung regions (c)
disruption of alveolar gas-exchange due to the effects of pneumonitis, and (d) heightened
vascular resistance due to the presence of microthrombi, while maintaining relatively well
preserved lung compliance and gas volumes. It replicates closely the levels of ventilationperfusion mismatch and hypoxemia (34, 35), as well as the lack of responsiveness to PEEP
(36-38), that has been documented in some patients with COVID-19; see (28) and the
supplementary file for full details.
For the investigation of P-SILI, the model was adapted to represent spontaneously breathing
patients. Spontaneous breathing is simulated by incorporating the variable ùëÉ"#$ , which
represents the pressure generated by the respiratory muscles acting on the lung. ùëÉ"#$ is
modelled as a piecewise function as described in (39) and adapted from (40). The function
consists of a parabolic profile during the inspiration phase of the respiratory cycle,
representing the progressive increase in pressure exerted by the respiratory muscles, followed
by an exponential profile during the expiration phase of the respiratory cycle, characterizing
the passive relaxation of the muscles. Accordingly,

The resultant alveolar pressure ùëÉIJK depends on ùëÉ"#$ , as well as on the pressures of the gases
within the compartment, the stiffness of the compartment (ùëÜ0 ), and parameter ùëÉ3M>,0 which
represents extrinsic pressures acting on the compartment. Pleural pressure is calculated as

where ùëâJ is the total lung volume, ùê∂RS is the compliance of the chest wall, which is set to 0.2
L/cmH2O (40), and ùëâQ,J is the unstressed volume of the lung (set to 1L).
To observe the pulmonary effects of interest, the following values were computed and
recorded: arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2), arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure
(PaCO2), arterial pH (pH), arterial oxygen saturation of haemoglobin (SaO2), volume and
pressure of individual alveolar compartments at end-inspiration and end-expiration (ùëâIJK_UVWX ,
ùëâIJK_YZX and ùëÉIJK_UVWX and ùëâIJK_YZX , respectively), cardiac output (CO), pleural pressure, and
transpulmonary pressure (ùëÉ>N ), calculated as the difference between the lung pressure and
pleural pressure. Shunt fraction (QS/QT) was calculated using the classical shunt equation,
based on the calculated values of arterial, pulmonary end-capillary and mixed venous O2
content. Physiological deadspace (and deadspace fraction; VD/VT) were calculated from
PaCO2, mixed expired CO2 pressure (ùëÉùê∏\ ùê∂ùëÇ4 ) and the exhaled tidal volume.
A range of indices associated with the risk of P-SILI were recorded, including the
transpulmonary and pleural pressure swings, dynamic strain (calculated as VT / end
expiratory lung volume), and the mechanical power applied to the lungs, calculated as:

the airway resistance (calculated as the driving pressure generated by ùëÉ"#$ divided by the
average flow rate during inspiration).
All model simulations were run for 30 minutes, with the reported data averaged over the final
1 minute, and conducted using Matlab version R2019b.v9 (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA,
USA).

Results
The simulated patient replicates levels of hypoxaemia that have frequently been reported in
spontaneously breathing COVID-19 patients. SaO2, PaO2 and PaCO2 on 100% oxygen at
baseline were 80.6%, 48.06 mmHg, and 58.43 mmHg, respectively (Table 1). Oxygenation
improved at higher respiratory efforts (SaO2 of 99.7% at VT / RR of 12 ml/kg / 40
breath/min) and PaCO2 decreased. Values of lung compliance and functional residual
capacity (FRC) at baseline were 47.5 ml/cmH2O and 1743.6 ml, showing good agreement
with the data for a cohort of COVID-19 patients reported in a recent study (average values
for lung compliance and lung gas volume of 49.9 ml/cmH2O and 1670 ml, respectively,
(41)). Lung compliance was unaffected by increased VT but reduced significantly at higher
respiratory rates (to 32.9 ml/cmH2O at VT / RR of 7 ml/kg / 20 breath/min, and 15.6
ml/cmH2O at 10 ml/kg / 40 breaths/min). Physiological shunt / deadspace were decreased /
increased at higher respiratory effort (minimum shunt of 25.8% at VT / RR of 12 ml/kg / 40
breath/min, maximum deadspace of 369.7 ml at VT / RR of 15 ml/kg / 20 breath/min).
Muscle pressures required to generate the different increased breathing patterns (maximum
ùëÉ"#$ of 64.9 cmH2O at VT / RR of 12 ml/kg / 40 breath/min) were well within the limits
specified for a 70kg adult male (maximum ùëÉ"#$ of 78.5 cmH2O at age 60, and 108.9 cmH2O
at age 40, (42)).

As shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1, significant increases in multiple indicators of the potential
for lung injury were observed at all higher VT / RR combinations tested. Pleural pressure
swing increased from 10.2 cmH2O at baseline to 30 cmH2O at VT / RR of 15 ml/kg / 20
breaths/min, up to a maximum of 52.9 cmH2O at 12 ml/kg / 40 breaths/min. Dynamic strain
increased from 0.3 to 0.49 at VT / RR of 12 ml/kg / 30 breaths/min, up to a maximum of 0.6
at 15 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min. Mechanical power increased from 7.83 J/min to 17.7 J/min at
VT / RR of 7 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min, and up to a maximum of 239.9 J/min at 12 ml/kg / 40
breaths/min.
The effect of increased respiratory effort on the distribution of maximum alveolar
compartmental volumes is shown in Fig. 2 here and Fig.1.3 in supplementary file. The model
consists of 100 independently configured gas-exchanging compartments. Compartments 93
to 100 are collapsed at baseline, at greater respiratory effort some of these compartments are
partially recruited. As shown, at the higher values of tidal volume and respiratory rate, the
proportion of compartments experiencing larger maximum volumes is significantly
increased.

Discussion
During mechanical ventilation, the power required to inflate the lungs is provided by an
external source of energy, whereas during spontaneous unassisted breathing it is provided by
the respiratory muscles. However, as pointed out in (19), lung injury (in the sense of
mechanical lesions in the interstitial space due to microfractures of the extracellular matrix or
the capillary walls) arises from the mechanical energy applied to the lungs, which generates
the relevant pressures. There is therefore no reason to believe that the extent of injury will be
significantly different whether excessive pressures are generated by respiratory muscles in
spontaneous breathing or by a mechanical ventilator. Similarly to the case of VILI, there is

also no reason to expect that, in the case of injured lungs, forces generated by respiratory
muscles could not lead to injurious effects on a regional level due to lung heterogeneity.
While the levels of transpulmonary pressure at higher respiratory effort in our model were
well within generally accepted safe limits, we observed large increases in pleural pressure
swings, up to a maximum of 30 cmH2O. Interestingly, in a recent study of inspiratory effort
in non-invasive ventilation, reductions in pleural pressure (recorded as oesophageal pressure
using a multifunctional nasogastric tube with a dedicated pressure transducer) of 10 cm H2O
or more after 2 hours of treatment was strongly associated with avoidance of intubation and
represented the most accurate predictor of treatment success (43). Also, as discussed in (44),
negative alveolar pressures created by large changes in pleural pressure, and therefore
positive changes in transvascular pressure, favour lung edema, a mechanism that is amplified
with increased vascular permeability, (45, 46). Given that negative pressures from
diaphragm contraction are not distributed uniformly, there is also the potential to cause
pendelluft gas movement due to localised changes in pleural pressures in dependent regions,
(47). Finally, it is important to recognise that when dynamic systems (from aircraft engines to
human lungs) are subjected to repeated cycles of excessive stresses and strains, their
deterioration over time is often not linear; rather, damage can accumulate ‚Äúsilently‚Äù before
eventually manifesting and spreading rapidly (48).
In light of the above considerations, it is difficult to see how, for a respiratory effort that a
patient (and their treating clinician) might consider tolerable, the levels of pleural pressure
swing, mechanical power, and dynamic strain produced in our model (Table 1), as well as the
corresponding skewing of compartmental volumes towards higher values (Fig. 2), could be
regarded as safe. Certainly, it is unlikely that any mechanical ventilation strategy that
produced similar values would be considered ‚Äúprotective‚Äù according to current standard
guidelines. Our results also highlight that improvements in PaO2/FiO2 ratio associated with

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.17.21253788; this version posted March 17, 2021. The copyright holder for this

larger tidal volume and respiratory rate should be interpreted in the context of the associated
increased respiratory effort and are not necessarily expressions of improved lung condition.
Indeed, the improvement in PaO2/FiO2 ratio we observed at higher respiratory effort was
coupled with reduced lung compliance and the development of levels of mechanical power
associated with worse short (49, 50) and long term (51) survival.
The debate around the potential role of P-SILI in contributing to the rapid deterioration
observed in some COVID-19 patients is a vigorous one, but we would suggest that it is
unnecessary to adopt extreme positions regarding the resulting implications for timing of
intubation. While more evidence is gathered, it is surely prudent is to adopt a ‚Äúprotective
ventilation‚Äù strategy, i.e. carefully monitor, and seek to reduce, high respiratory effort in such
patients, via either standard supplemental oxygen treatment or non-invasive ventilation. If
these options fail to promptly reduce high respiratory effort even after resolution of
hypoxaemia, then controlling driving and transpulmonary pressure through mechanical
ventilation and the institution of strategies such as prone positioning should be initiated in a
timely fashion to avoid the potential additional risks associated with P-SILI.
On this point, a recent case-study described in (8) may illustrate those risks. The author
reports a patient who presented to the emergency department with moderate respiratory
distress and increased respiratory effort. After initial treatment with supplemental oxygen via
a non-rebreather facemask followed by a failed trial of bilevel positive airway pressure, she
required tracheal intubation 5 hours later. The chest X-ray (CXR) at the time of intubation
‚Äúshowed a remarkable progression of infiltrates since the admission CXR‚Äù. The author notes
that ‚Äúwhile worsening pneumonia could have contributed to her CXR findings, it is hard to
overlook the contribution of P-SILI to her worsening pulmonary infiltrates‚Äù.
Our study has some limitations, principally that the results are based on computational
modeling of COVID-19 pathophysiology, rather than data from patients with COVID-19.

Investigating the issues raised here in clinical trials is likely to prove challenging both from
an ethical and practical point of view, however, and suitable animal models of COVID-19
pathophysiology to study these questions are yet to emerge (52). In these circumstances, we
hope that insights from detailed computational models that recapitulate patient breathing
patterns and lung mechanics can provide useful evidence with which to inform current
debate.

Conclusions
Our results indicate that pressures compatible with the occurrence of P-SILI can develop in
patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory failure who experience only moderately increased
respiratory effort, i.e. without overt dyspnoea, through significant increases in pleural
pressure swings, mechanical power and dynamic strain. If conventional oxygen therapy or
non-invasive ventilation is ineffective in reducing respiratory effort, control of driving and
transpulmonary pressures with invasive ventilation may reduce the effects of P-SILI and
allow time for the resolution of the underlying condition.
