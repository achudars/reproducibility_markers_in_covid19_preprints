Abstract
Countries worldwide have adopted various strategies to minimize the socio‐economic im‐
pact of the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic. Stringency of imposed measures universally
reflects the standpoint from which protecting public health and saving economy are seen
as contradictory objectives. We analyzed epidemic trajectories of 25 highly developed
countries and 10 US states in the mobility reduction vs. reproduction number plane to
show that the consequence of delayed lockdown is a surge of infections and deaths, that
is ultimately suppressed by stringent and long‐lasting quarantine. As a consequence, cu‐
mulative mobility reduction and population‐normalized cumulative number of COVID‐19‐
associated deaths are significantly correlated and this correlation increases with time. We
thus demonstrated that, as long as epidemic suppression is the aim, the trade‐off between
the death toll and economic loss is illusory: high death toll correlates with deep and long‐
lasting lockdown and severe economic downturn.

Introduction
The COVID‐19 epidemic is a major threat to both public health and global economy. To mini‐
mize death toll and economic loss, countries worldwide have assumed various strategies (not
always officially declared). Two main strategies to counteract the epidemic spread are eradi‐
cation and suppression. Countries such as China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, New Zealand,
Australia, and others, decided to fully eradicate the disease on their territories and then limit
and control incoming travelers. Geographic isolation helps to implement such strategy. Most
European countries have chosen the suppression strategy that aims to limit the exponential
growth of the outbreak and then reduce daily new cases to a small number. Both the erad‐
ication and the suppression strategy are founded on the expectation that a vaccine will be
developed in near future, and that massive vaccination will ultimately enable governments to
lift imposed restrictions. A third strategy, in which it is anticipated that, on the contrary, no
effective vaccine will be available soon and thus long‐term containment is not realistic, is to
rely on mitigation and ultimately acquisition of herd immunity. This strategy had been initially
declared in the UK but was promptly abandoned due to a rapid increase in the death toll and
the threat of overwhelming the health system.
In the conceptual framework of mathematical models of infectious diseases, any policy that
aims at reducing transmission of the virus seeks to decrease the effective reproduction num‐
ber. Within S(E)IR‐type epidemic models [1], the reproduction number R is equal to the ratio
of the contact rate ˛ of the infectious and the susceptible individuals and the removal rate ‚
of the infectious individuals, R = ˛/‚. In terms of policy‐making, the contact rate ˛ can be re‐
duced by prohibiting mass gatherings (that increase the risk of super‐spreading events), social
distancing, and hygienic precautions. These countermeasures decrease the risk that a given
contact is infectious. Reduction of is ˛ may be also achieved through quarantine that obligates
individuals to stay home or at least significantly limit their out‐of‐home activity. The removal
rate ‚ can be increased by enhanced testing and contact tracing, which both enable prompt
isolation of (potentially) infectious individuals. While a nation‐wide quarantine (lockdown) is
an effective mean of reducing ˛ (and R) and saving lives, it hampers economic activity and
may thus incur a significant loss of country GDP, in addition to psychological and social costs.
Policy‐making is thus intuitively understood as a balancing act between health and fiscal risks
of the pandemic.

We show that when the strategies of multiple countries are juxtaposed, there is effectively
no trade‐off between the death toll and the economic loss. As the total number of deaths
and cumulative lockdown are the two quantities that have to be jointly minimized, we use
Pareto fronts to evaluate the European and North American suppression policies as well as
East Asian eradication policies. We demonstrate that there is a strong correlation between
the population‐normalized cumulative number of COVID‐19‐assigned deaths and cumulative
lockdown. A similar relation is observed for excess deaths and decrease of GDP in the first
half of 2020. We interpret this result by dissecting the impact of testing and nation‐wide
quarantine on the effective reproduction number.

Results
Severity of national lockdowns can be inferred from data on the reduction of mobility gathered
in Google COVID‐19 Community Mobility Reports [2]. We expect that the relative reduction
of mobility in locations belonging to two categories—workplaces and places related to retail
and recreation—is strongly associated with economic slowdown. We thus assume that the
cumulative average mobility reduction in these two categories serves as a good indicator of
the impact the epidemic has on economy.
In Fig. 1 we analyzed Western, Central, and South European countries with populations
of at least five million, ten most populous US states, and Canada—that nearly unanimously
adopted the suppression strategy—as well as Taiwan, South Korea and Japan—that adopted
the eradication strategy. In all considered countries, human development index, that factors in
life expectancy and standard of living, exceeds 0.8 [3]. Also, all considered locations are in the
Northern Hemisphere, which minimizes the influence of seasonal effects related to weather
and holidays [4]. We marked positions of the considered locations on the plane of cumulative
mobility reduction (lockdown) vs. square root of the population‐normalized cumulative number
of COVID‐19‐assigned deaths as of July 1 (Fig. 1a) and November 1 (Fig. 1b) 2020.
Figures 1a and 1b suggest high correlation between the population‐normalized cumulative
number of COVID‐19‐assigned deaths and the cumulative mobility reduction. Both these data
series are normally distributed (whereas the set of non‐transformed population‐normalized
cumulative numbers of COVID‐19‐assigned deaths does not satisfy the normality condition,
see Methods for details). This allowed us to quantify interdependence of these two data se‐

ries using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. For November 1, 2020, we obtained ȷ = 0.75 and
substantially higher population‐weighted correlation coefficient, ȷw = 0.87. Importantly, as
demonstrated in Fig. 1b, both correlation coefficients, ȷ and ȷw , increased in time. In Sup‐
plementary Figure S1 we show how positions of considered locations changed in time in the
coordinate system of Fig. 1a and Fig. 1b.
The observed high correlation clearly indicates for a lack of trade‐off between life/health
cost and lockdown‐induced economic/social loss. Consequently, when locations represented
by such diagonally scattered data points are evaluated from the perspective of Pareto opti‐
mality, layered Pareto fronts are rather short (Fig. 1b). The trade‐off between the considered
objectives would be manifested by anti‐correlation and correspondingly long Pareto fronts. In
the Pareto approach, both objectives are considered simultaneously without assigning weights
to them. By definition, each location from a considered layer performs worse (considering both
criteria) than at least one location from the previous layer. We decided to group locations us‐
ing “fuzzy” fronts to reduce the number of fronts and make them more robust with respect to
small (and random) differences in values of considered objectives.
The first optimal front (first layer) consists of a single country, Taiwan, which has simul‐
taneously the smallest cumulative lockdown and smallest population‐normalized number of
deaths; both next two optimal fronts also contain a solitary East Asian country, South Ko‐
rea and Japan; the fourth optimal front contains four European countries: Slovakia, Norway,
Greece, and Denmark. The first pessimal front (last layer) contains New York State (with the
highest population‐normalized number of deaths), Spain, and UK (with the highest cumulative
lockdown); the second pessimal front is spanned by the state of California, and France, Italy
and Belgium; the third, broad pessimal front groups several US states, Canada, and Portugal.
High correlation between cumulative lockdown and population‐normalized cumulative num‐
ber of deaths can be explained by analysis of trajectories of individual countries in the mobil‐
ity reduction vs. effective reproduction number plane, see Fig. 2. The effective reproduction
number R (equal ˛/‚ in the SEIR model that we used to estimate R [5]) is calculated from the
number of daily new registered cases as explained in Methods. In the countries that are close
to the current Pareto‐pessimal front (last layer), the epidemic had three distinguishable phases,
depicted schematically in Fig. 3. In the initial phase, characterized by a high R value and no mo‐
bility reduction, R decreases due to suppression of potential super‐spreading events and social

distancing. In the next phase, R drops below 1 due to the reduction of mobility, which leads
to a decrease of the contact rate ˛. When analyzing individual trajectories plotted in Fig. 2 we
may notice that in the second phase the number of tests per case (indicated by line width and
color intensity) remains constant or decreases (possibly due to saturation of the capacity of
facilities that perform tests), suggesting that in this phase the removal rate ‚ remains constant
or decreases. This confirms that the reduction of mobility, and thus ˛, was instrumental in
bringing R below 1.

We digress here to note that the daily number of performed tests can be analyzed in re‐
lation to either the population size or the number of positive cases (positive tests). We think
that this latter scaling is more adequate as it reflects the idea of contact tracing, when the indi‐
viduals that had contact with an infected individual undergo testing. The bigger is the tested
cluster of individuals, the higher is the probability that majority of the secondary infectious will
be identified and “removed”. Thus we assume that ‚ grows monotonically with the number of
‘tests per case’. Another measure related to ‘tests per case’ and ‚ is the ratio of the delayed
daily new cases to daily new deaths. A large number of ‘cases per death’ indicates that a large
fraction of infected individuals have been identified (and isolated), and thus implies large ‚.
In the third phase, while mobility is increasing, R is smaller than 1 and remains nearly con‐
stant, suggesting that the inevitable growth of ˛ is compensated by a proportionate growth
of ‚. Indeed, when R is kept below 1, there is epidemic regression, during which the number
of daily new cases is steadily decreasing. This leads to an increase of the average number of
tests per case as can be seen for nearly all countries in Fig. 3. As a consequence, a given value
of mobility reduction (and, thus, of ˛) corresponds to two values of R: higher than 1 in the
second phase (when ‚ is low) and lower than 1 in the third phase (when ‚ is high).
Considered countries that introduced restrictions when the number of daily cases was rel‐
atively small were able to perform a higher number of tests per case and thus achieved higher
‚. This allowed them to reduce R below 1 at larger ˛ values, that is, at smaller mobility reduc‐
tion (see Fig. 2). This explains a positive correlation between the cumulative death toll and
cumulative lockdown (as shown in Fig. 1c), implying that, when the epidemic eradication or
suppression is the objective, there is no trade‐off between public health costs and economic
loss.

Figure 4: GDP loss in the first half of 2020 vs. cumulative lockdown in this period for European and
East Asian countries, ten US states, and Canada.

For most locations, data on COVID‐19‐registered deaths as well as lockdown level become
available with a short delay. We thus consider these values as rapid indicators of life/health
costs and of economical/social costs. At the time of manuscript revision it has become already
possible to juxtapose the GDP decrease in the first half of 2020 with cumulative lockdown
in this period. As one can see in Fig. 4, these two quantities are correlated with Pearson’s
correlation coefficients ȷ = 0.81 and ȷw = 0.81.
Finally, we use the recently available data and directly juxtapose the population‐normalized
number of epidemic‐associated deaths in the first half of 2020 with the GDP decrease (on a
year‐on‐year basis) in this period of time, see Fig. 5. The epidemic‐associated deaths are here
defined as a maximum of the number of COVID‐19‐assigned deaths and excess deaths (the
difference between actual all recorded deaths and their expected value based on recent years

[6, 7]). We propose to take the maximum of these two values as for a handful of countries the
death excess in the first half of 2020 is negligible (or even negative) due to the preventive lock‐
down which also reduced deaths associated with, e.g., car accidents, influenza, or air pollution
[8, 9]. In the first wave of the epidemic in some considered countries, such as Spain or Nether‐
lands, the difference between COVID‐19‐assigned deaths and excess deaths was significant
(about 40% of excess deaths), whereas in others, such as France or Belgium, it was negligible
[10]). The data from the second wave suggest that in some Central European countries (e.g.,
Poland and Bulgaria) the difference between the number of COVID‐19‐assigned deaths and
excess deaths is larger than 40% of the latter. Obviously, the excess deaths (that are counted
with some delay) serve as a better indicator of health‐related damage than COVID‐19‐assigned

deaths. When all countries and states are considered jointly, as in Fig. 4, correlation between
the square root of the population‐normalized number of epidemic‐associated deaths and GDP
is ȷ = 0.55 and ȷw = 0.68. When only‐European countries are considered, correlation rises to ȷ =
0.68 and ȷw = 0.81, however this subset of data does not fulfill normality assumption according
to majority of tests (see Methods for details) and thus should be considered with caution.
The difference is likely caused by different socio‐economic conditions in the US, Europe,
and Japan. Gini index [11] for the US is 0.39, which is higher than for EU, 0.31, and Japan,
0.34, and is associated with lower social security level. Consequently, in the US the pandemic
caused a sharp unemployment surge of 10 percentage points, while in the EU and Japan the
rise of unemployment was close to 1 percentage point (first half of 2020 with respect to the
first half of 2019) [12–14]. Thus, in the EU and Japan the GDP drop is the main consequence
of lockdown, while in the US a comparatively smaller drop of GDP is accompanied by a higher
increase of unemployment. Nevertheless, even when restricting to a single economical indi‐
cator, GDP, the correlation observed in Fig. 5 shows that during pandemic saving lives and
protecting economy are not the opposite objectives.

Discussion
Construction of Pareto fronts allowed us to identify countries that, up to a given time point,
minimized the socio‐economic and medical costs more effectively than others. Economic and
social costs associated with lockdown include GDP loss, surge of unemployment, as well as
educational and psychological costs caused by closing of schools and universities. Analysis
of the latter costs requires additional studies as countries significantly differ in the stringency
of restrictions imposed on their educational institutions. Medical costs are deaths but also
severe cases, number of which is proportional to the number of deaths. Severe cases may be
associated with lasting health effects. Additionally, high number of COVID‐19 cases impact
healthcare systems, aggravating treatment of other conditions.
Without weights being assigned to cumulative deaths and to the cumulative lockdown,
one may not compare countries in a given Pareto front. Nevertheless, constructed layered
Pareto fronts clearly show that the considered East Asian countries outperformed European
countries and US states in both categories. These East Asian countries are on the “good” side
of the European Pareto‐optimal front formed by Slovakia, Norway, Greece, and Denmark (as

of November 1, 2020). The Pareto‐pessimal front is formed by UK (with the highest cumulative
lockdown), Belgium, and New York State (with the highest cumulative population‐normalized
number of deaths). These locations, as well as locations in the second Pareto‐pessimal front,
at first suffered from a high number of deaths due to the delayed lockdown decision and
then had a long and stringent lockdown introduced to stop the spread of the epidemic. Short
Pareto fronts that clearly separate countries and states that up to a given time point perform
better than others are the consequence of the strong correlation between (square root of) the
population‐normalized number of cumulative deaths and cumulative lockdown.
We have explained this non‐intuitive correlation by analysis of trajectories of individual
countries and states on the mobility reduction vs. effective reproduction number plane. We
have shown that when the number of daily new cases exceeds some threshold, further epi‐
demic growth can be suppressed only by a strict quarantine. In the growth phase, the number
of tests per case decreases, implying reduction of the removal rate ‚. This in turn implies that
the reproduction number R = ˛/‚ is decreased only due to the lockdown that reduced the
contact rate ˛. Only after the imposed quarantine reduced R below 1 can the epidemic be
further suppressed by the increased efficiency of testing (number of test per case), increasing
the removal rate ‚. The increase of ‚ allows for curbing the number of daily new cases (and
resulting deaths) at gradual relaxation of lockdown measures.
To recognize reasons of vast differences in the number of cumulative deaths between coun‐
tries after the first wave of the epidemic one can consider two hypothetically identical coun‐
tries. Let us assume that in both countries in each week the number of daily cases grows
twofold (which roughly corresponds to R = 2). Then, the first country decides to impose a
strong lockdown which eventually (with some time delay) causes that the number of daily
cases decreases 1.4‐fold each week (which roughly corresponds to R = 0.7, which is the value
achieved by Italy or Spain). If the second country introduces lockdown of the same stringency
but delayed by one week, it will reach a twofold higher number of daily cases and additionally
will have to sustain its lockdown 2 weeks longer in order to reduce the number of daily cases
to the same level as the first country. Having twofold higher peak of daily cases and three‐
week longer epidemic wave, the second country will suffer from more than doubled count of
deaths with respect to the first country and additionally will have higher economic loss due to
the longer lockdown.

Over time, countries may change their Pareto fronts. The “velocity” of a country in the
cumulative lockdown vs. cumulative deaths plane is given by the number of daily deaths and
current mobility reduction. In a bit longer perspective, countries having currently R > 1 are in
the unfavorable situation as their number of daily new cases is still increasing. In a longer time
scale, both the cumulative death toll and the country‐specific history of lockdown (lockdown
fatigue) should be taken into consideration when predicting plausible further country trajec‐
tory. Clearly, these two factors influence risk avoidance and risk acceptance, respectively.
Societies that managed to prevent high death toll by early and effective lockdown may find
themselves in a psychologically more challenging situation as they will face lockdown fatigue
that will not be counterbalanced be the “accumulated fear”. On the other hand, in countries
that had a high wave of deaths, the accumulated fear is overshadowed by accumulated lock‐
down fatigue. In these countries the lockdown was more stringent and longer compared to
countries that avoided the first wave of the epidemic by preventive lockdown. Comparison of
the current situation (as of November 2020) in Central European countries that avoided the
first wave of epidemic (due to preventive lockdown) with the situation in Western European
countries that suffered from both a high death toll and long and stringent lockdown does not
give a clear answer about their preparedness to the second wave. Currently, both Western and
Central European countries, as well as the US, are attempting to contain the second wave with‐
out imposing lockdowns as stringent as during the first epidemic wave. Our analysis, however,
suggests that this strategy can again lead to a high death toll and high economic and social
costs.
An important assumption in our reasoning is that all analyzed countries continue the sup‐
pression strategy until the epidemic is terminated by a widespread immunization through vac‐
cination. The relation between health and economic costs can be different when countries
abandon the suppression strategy and chose the herd immunity option, in which the adminis‐
tratively imposed restrictions are replaced by voluntary risk‐avoiding and risk‐adapting strate‐
gies of the individuals [5]. In this case the preceding transient lockdowns may be not beneficial
as they add economic costs to the high and unavoidable death toll.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated that in the epidemic mitigation strategy, non‐intuitively, there is no
trade‐off between the (population‐normalized) number of deaths and the cumulative lock‐
down: these two variables are strongly correlated. Furthermore, the cumulative lockdown
correlates with GDP decrease. Countries or states that refrained from imposing lockdown be‐
fore the surge of infections suffered form both high numbers of epidemic‐associated deaths
as well as delayed but stringent and long‐lasting lockdown. The “hit hard, hit fast” strategy,
although difficult to implement for political reasons, appears to be the least devastating option.
Strategies of individual countries (or states) can be evaluated with the help of Pareto fronts
that stratify groups of countries with respect to the success of their anti‐epidemic policies,
without weighting medical and economic costs. The ordered ladder of short Pareto fronts
clearly indicates that saving lives and protecting economy are not the opposite objectives.

Methods
Data sources
The COVID‐19 dataset maintained by Our World in Data [15] is used as the source of data
on the number of confirmed cases and deaths (original data source being European Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control) and the number of tests (collected from national government
reports). For the states of the USA, analogous data were extracted from The COVID Tracking
Project [16]. Mobility reduction has been taken from the Google COVID‐19 Community Mo‐
bility Reports [2].
Missing counts of daily new cases and deaths are filled with zeros and missing cumulative
counts of cases and deaths are taken from the previous available counts. When the number of
tests is not available daily, their number is linearly interpolated between available data points.
To avoid artifacts in analyzed trends that would result from temporally non‐uniform reporting,
negative daily new counts were replaced by zeros while positive daily new counts known to
result from aggregation of counts from multiple days were replaced by an average of counts
in adjacent days.
Testing density [17] is analyzed according to: the number of people tested: in Canada,

To compute R based on the daily new confirmed cases (Fig. 2) we first estimated the doubling
time Td at each ith day as:
Td (i) =

log 2
,
1
x
log i+w/2
w–1
xi–w/2

(1)

where xi is rolling mean of the respective daily new counts (calculated within a 14‐day window
with equal weights) and the time span is set to w = 14 days. Let us notice that Td is positive
when the number of daily cases (or deaths) is increasing, and Td is negative when the number of
daily cases is decreasing; when the number of daily cases remains constant in time, then Td =
∞. The reproduction number R on ith day was then computed in accordance with Wallinga
& Lipsitch (2007) Wallinga and Lipsitch [18] and Wearing et al. (2005) Wearing, Rohani, and
Keeling [19] as:

«m
„
log 2
log 2
+1
Td (i) Td (i) m ﬀ
R(i) = „
«–n « ,
„
log 2
‚ 1–
+1
Td (i) n ‚

(2)

assuming m = 6, n = 1, ﬀ = 1/(5.28 days), ‚ = 1/(2.9 days). These parameter values reflect the
assumption that the incubation period is Erlang‐distributed with the shape parameter 6 and
mean of 5.28 days [20], while the period of infectiousness is distributed exponentially with
the mean of 2.9 days. As a simplification, to estimate R the identical and constant in time ‚
has been assumed in all countries, however, as discussed in the Results section, the period of
infectiousness is affected by testing capacity. For given m, n, and ﬀ the reproduction number
R is a decreasing function of ‚ for Td > 0 and an increasing function of ‚ for Td < 0. For Td = ∞,
we obtain R = 1, regardless of remaining parameters; thus the critical point in which R passes
1 in Fig. 2, is independent of the specific values of model parameters.

Quantification of mobility reduction
To account for mobility reduction related to the decrease of economic activity, we averaged
daily mobility reduction in categories of ‘workplaces’ and ‘retail and recreation’ (includes shop‐
ping centers and restaurants) on weekdays, excluding days of country‐wide holidays in each
country. National epidemic trajectories shown in Fig. 2 are drawn by taking current R(i) (com‐
puted based on the daily new cases as described above) and mobility reduction in previous
days weighted according to the (time‐reversed) distribution of infection‐to‐removal times,
which is the hypoexponential distribution with rates {–, –, –, –, –, –, ‚} where – = 6ﬀ.

Normality of distributions
We confirmed normality of marginal distributions of points, for which Pearson’s correlation
coefficient was computed, using an array of statistical tests as shown in Table 1.
Table 1: P‐values from normality tests performed for data for which Pearson’s correlation coefficient
is estimated. Columns labeled x and y correspond to projections of data points onto the horizontal and
the vertical axis (marginal distributions), respectively. Values of p < 0.05 (bold) indicate violation of the
normality assumption.
