Abstract
Background: Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19)
rapidly spread in China, reached multiple continents currently.We aimed to reveal the
infectious characteristics of COVID-19 that provide more information for the research
of novel coronavirus.
Methods: We performed a retrospective study on the clinical characteristics of 128
COVID-19 cases with laboratory-confirmed from Xiangyang No 1 Hospitalad during
January 2020 to 16 February 2020.
Results: Female patients account for 53.1%. The aged below 20 years that
accounts for 1.6% of overall patients. The aged in 21~50, 51~65, over 66 years were
accounts for 44.5%, 35.1%,18.8%, respectively. In the difference age spectrum, all
severe groups compared with non-severe groups were difference significantly ( P <
0.01 ). Fever ( 89.8% ) and Cough ( 67.2% ) were common clinical symptoms. The
rate of patients with sore throats (14.1%) was rare. The rate of chest computed
tomography scan showing ground glass opacity in overall, non-severe, severe groups
were 63.3%, 60.7%, 76.2%, respectively. White blood cell counts in the normal range
of overall patients, but severe group patients were increased significantly ( P < 0.01).
Lymphocytes of overall patients were decreased. Alanine transaminase (ALT) and
aspartate transaminase (AST) in the normal range of overall patients, but its were
elevated in the severe group. Creatinine (CR) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of
overall patients in the normal range. C-reactive protein (CRP) level of all patients
were increased markedly, but it in the severe group was significantly higher than that
in the non-severe group ( P < 0.01 ).
Conclusions: Our data provide more information that advanced age, lower
lymphocytes levels at the diagnosed COVID-19 patients may be a risk factor for
unfavourable prognosis. The white blood cells and C-reactive protein level elevated in
severe COVID-19 patients may be accompanying bacterial infection. 2019-nCov may
be carries a risk factor of impaired liver and kidney function.

INTRODUCTION
Since December 2019, fast-multiplying outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus
(2019-nCov) in China, which have reached multiple continents currently. 2019-nCov
mainly cause pneumonia that the desease was named as novel coronavirus pneumonia
(COVID-19) 1. The 2019-nCov is an betacoronavirus that possibly originated from
wild animals that genome is highly homologous to bats 2. Human-to-human
transmission is the main way of cause infection 3. The World Health Organization
(WHO) has declared it to be a public health emergency of international concern 4.
Until February 20, 2020, a total number of 75569 COVID-19 cases have been
diagnosed in China, including 2239 deaths 5. Despite the rapid spread over the world,
the clinical features and laboratory inspection of COVID-19 keep largely unclear. The
clinical characteristics of severe COVID-19 cases were similar to severe acute
respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS )
that could occur acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury,
and even death 6.Whereas the main clinical features of COVID-19 patients are fever,
cough and sore throat. However, there are few reports on the clinical features and
laboratory detection results of NCP cases in every regions of Hubei province outside
Wuhan. We aimed to through analyzed 128 laboratory confirmed cases of Xiangyang
No. 1 Hospital to reveal the infectious characteristics of COVID-19 that provide more
information for the research of novel coronavirus.

METHODS
We performed a retrospective study on the clinical characteristics of laboratoryconfirmed 128 cases with COVID-19. Patients were admitted to the Xiangyang No.1
Hospital from 1 January 2020 to 16 February 2020, with final follow-up for the
research on 21 February 2020. Clinical data were collected from the hospital

electronic medical records system and laboratory information system. On admission,
107 and 21 patients were divided into non-severe and severe groups, respectively. A
confirmed case with COVID-19 was defined as a positive result to real-time reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) assay for nasal and pharyngeal
swab specimens 7. Only the laboratory-confirmed cases were included the analysis.
Suspected patients and clinical diagnosised patients were not part of our study. The
study was approved by the ethics committee of the Xiangyang No. 1Hospital with
written informed consent from the patients.
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY,
USA). The data between groups with variables were compared by χ2 test or Fisher's
exact test, and one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test. All means were
reported with the corresponding standard deviation in tables. The P values < 0.05
were regarded as statistically significant.

The 128 COVID-19 patients were confirmed by laboratory detection. On admission,
107 and 21 patients were divided into non-severe and severe groups, respectively. The
demographic and clinical features were showed in Table 1. The data showed that
female patients account for 53.1%, the proportion of these female patients in the
severe and non-severe groups was 55.1% and 42.9%, respectively. The overall
patients throughout the whole spectrum of age. The aged below 20 years that
accounts for 1.6% of overall patients. The rate of overall patients who aged in 21~50
years were 44.5%, no-severe and severe patients accounts for 46.7%, 33.3%,
respectively. The 51~65 years accounts for 35.1% of overall patients. The older
patients aged over 66 years in the group of overall patients accounts for 18.8%.
However, aged over 50 years accounting for 53.9% of overall patients. In the
difference age spectrum, all severe groups compared with non-severe groups were
difference significantly ( P < 0.01 ). Fever ( 89.8% ) and Cough ( 67.2% ) were
common clinical symptoms. The rate of patients with sore throats (14.1%) was rare.
The rate of chest computed tomography scan showing ground glass opacity in overall,
non-severe, severe were 63.3%, 60.7%, 76.2%, respectively. However, no marked
differences in fever, cough, sore throat between the two groups (all P > 0.05).
Moreover, there were distinctly different of chest computed tomography scan
showing ground glass opacity in severe group compared with non-severe group (P <
0.05).

Laboratory inspection of patients infected 2019-nCov
All patients were summoned to the laboratory for a routine blood sample, all of
which were analyzed. Laboratory detection results were showed in Table 2. Results
indicated that white blood cell counts in the normal range of overall patients, but
severe group patients were increased significantly ( P < 0.01). Lymphocytes of overall
patients were decreased, yet Platelets in the normal range. Whereas, Lymphocytes and
Platelets level of severe group obviously lower than no-severe group ( P < 0.01 ).
Alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase in the normal range of overall
patients, but its were elevated in the severe group. Creatinine and blood urea nitrogen
of overall patients in the normal range and no marked difference between no-severe
and severe group. C-reactive protein level of all patients were increased markedly, but
it in the severe group was significantly higher than that in the non-severe group ( P <
0.01 ).

DISCUSSION
2019 novel coronavirus was an batacoronavirus which was transmitted by droplets
and direct contact with a patient’s body fluids, other ways of it transmission was
unclear8,9. Until 16 February 2020, the number of COVID-19 patients was more than
70 000, yet the number of infections was still rising 5. However, there are
still no effective treatment for COVID-19, the main treatment is symptomatic
and supportive therapy to alleviate symptoms and maintain organ function in severe
diseases10. Although some studies have reported that some drugs can be used against
the 2019-nCov, these drugs still in the research stage11.
Our 128 case series by laboratory-diagnosed that all of them comeback from Wuhan,
or had contacted with people from Wuhan, or close contacted with diagnosed patients.
However, there are unavoidable misdiagnosis through laboratory- confirmed by
real-time quantitative fluorescence PCR detection of 2019-nCov due to sampling
deviation. In our study, the aged over 50 years patients accounted for over half of
the diagnosed patients (53.9%). Fever (89.8%) and cough(67.2%) were
common symptoms, yet sore throat (14.1%) was rare. Chest computed tomography
scan showing ground glass opacity of diagnosed patients account for 63.3%, whereas
the severe pneumonia up to 76.2%, these were inconsistent with other studies12. Our

data suggested that gender may not be an influence factor in 2019-nCov infection, yet
advanced age was a risk factor for viral infection and poor prognosis.
Our data of laboratory detection indicated that the white blood cells and C-reactive
protein level were elevated in severe case series and the lymphocytes were decreased.
The results suggested that severe pneumonia may be accompanying bacterial infection
and immune deficiency may be also a risk factor for unfavourable prognosis in
patients13. In addition, alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and
creatinine (CR) were elevated in the patients of severe pneumonia. The results
suggested that 2019-nCov may be carries a risk factor of impaired liver and kidney
function.
In summary, our data provide more information that advanced age, lower
lymphocytes levels at the diagnosed COVID-19 patients may be a risk factor for
unfavourable prognosis. The white blood cells and C-reactive protein level elevated in
severe COVID-19 patients may be accompanying bacterial infection. 2019-nCov may
be carries a risk factor of impaired liver and kidney function.
