Abstract

Background: The SARS-CoV-2 virus causing COVID-19 binds human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) receptors in human tissues. ACE2 expression may be associated with COVID-19 infection and
mortality rates. Routinely prescribed drugs which up- or down-regulate ACE2 expression are
therefore of critical research interest as agents which might promote or reduce risk of COVID-19
infection in a susceptible population.
Aim: To review evidence on routinely prescribed drug treatments in the UK that could up- or downregulate ACE2 and potentially affect COVID-19 infection.
Design and setting: Systematic review of studies published in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the
Cochrane Library and Web of Science from inception to April 1st 2020.
Method: A systematic review will be conducted in line with PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion criteria will
be: i) assess effect of drug exposure on ACE2 level; ii) drug is included in British National Formulary
(BNF) and therefore available to prescribe in UK; iii) a control, placebo or sham group is included as
comparator. Exclusion criteria will be: i) ACE2 measurement in utero; ii) ACE2 measurement in
children under 18 years; iii) drug not in BNF; iv) review article. Quality will be assessed using the
Cochrane risk of bias tool for human studies, and the SYRCLE risk of bias tool for animal studies.
Results: Data will be reported in summary tables and narrative synthesis.
Conclusion: This systematic review will identify drug therapies which may increase or decrease ACE2
expression. This might identify medications increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission, or as targets
for intervention in mitigating transmission.

Version 1

How this fits in
Clinicians, researchers and patients are increasingly interested in whether existing drug
treatments may influence outcomes in COVID-19. As the binding site for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2
is of particular interest. In this systematic review, we will identify what evidence exists on
effects of drugs prescribed in the UK on ACE2 levels. The findings will highlight drugs which
might promote or prevent transmission of COVID-19.

Version 1

Introduction
The rapid spread of the novel, pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) 1
between late 2019 and April 2020 has escalated to a global health emergency . As of April 2020 over 2 million
individuals have been infected worldwide; over 150,000 people have died of the associated disease COVID-19
(COronaVirus Disease 2019)2. Focus on strategies to reduce viral transmission and disease mortality has
intensified, including both pharmacological3 and non-pharmacological approaches4,5, alongside high speed
vaccine development programmes6.
SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to enter cells via binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)7. The
8
ACE2 receptor performs a broad range of roles in a variety of tissues including lung, kidney, brain and heart .
As part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), ACE2 is implicated in roles including blood
pressure homeostasis9 and downregulation of inflammation10. It has been hypothesises that SARS-CoV-2 may
mediate effects contributing to viral sepsis and mortality through interaction with ACE2 in a variety of
tissues11. Furthermore, differential expression of ACE2 in disease states such as hypertension may be
12
associated with differing rates of COVID-19 infection or mortality .
A key research question is whether any routinely prescribed drugs may be associated with altered ACE2
expression, and whether this altered expression may be of clinical relevance in COVID-19. For example, debate
is ongoing about whether patients taking ACE inhibitors should be advised to switch drug class due to their
association with increased ACE2 expression13,14. Conversely, medications which downregulate ACE2
transmission may be interest as part of a strategy to reduce viral transmission15.
In this systematic review we seek to identify what evidence exists on existing drug therapies that may increase
or decrease ACE2 expression. Identifying drugs with these effects will help direct future COVID-19 research by
highlighting drugs which may either prevent or promote transmission of the disease.

Methods and Analysis
Protocol Development

The systematic review will be conducted in line with guidance set out in the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis PRISMA statement16.
Search Strategy

Systematic searches will be conducted from inception until 1/4/2020 in the following databases:
MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. The detailed search strategy
is provided in Table1. References of relevant reviews and articles meeting selection criteria will
additionally be screened; advice will be sought from topic experts; and OpenGrey will be searched to
identify additional texts. We will set no language limits or study design filters on our search.
Study selection criteria

The study inclusion criteria will be:
1. Studies measuring ACE2 levels (of either activity or gene expression)
2. Studies including a drug that is available on a UK prescription according to the British
National Formulary (BNF)17
3. Measuring the effect of the drug against a control, placebo or sham group
Study exclusion criteria will be:
1. ACE2 measurements in utero

Version 1
2. Studies in children under 18 years of age
3. The medication being studied is not available to prescribe in primary care in the UK, as
assessed by inclusion in the (BNF)
4. Review articles
All methodologies meeting the above criteria, including randomised and non-randomised controlled
trials and other experimental studies, will be included. Conference abstracts will be included if
sufficient data can be elicited from them. Review articles will be excluded from synthesis, but their
references will be screened and all appropriate studies included.
Screening & Data Extraction

Study titles and abstracts will be reviewed for eligibility by four members of the review team (AA,
HDM, CW, SH). Full text review, data extraction and quality assessment will be performed by five
members of the team (AA, HDM, CW, SH, SK). Initial screening will be performed using the
systematic review web app Rayyan QCRI18.
The following data will be extracted and verified by one of the five members of the review team (AA,
HDM, CW, SH, SK): i) drug class; ii) drug name; iii) duration of treatment; iv) effect on ACE2 level
(defined as upregulation or downregulation or no effect); v) model (e.g. human, mouse); vi) site of
ACE2 receptor (e.g. lung, brain); vii) study design; viii) study population; ix) sample size; x) country.
Given the urgency of this research question during the COVID-19 pandemic, we will extract all
available information from the text but will not separately contact authors.
Quality Assessment

Methodological quality of included animal studies will be assessed using the SYRCLE risk of bias tool
(SYstematic Review Center for Laboratory animal Experimentation)19. This tool has been adapted
from the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised studies20 to include criteria to specifically assess
the quality of animal studies. The quality of human studies will be analysed separately using the
Cochrane risk of bias tool.
Summary Tables and Narrative Synthesis

Numbers of studies identified in searches and subsequently included in analysis will be
demonstrated using the PRISMA flowchart in line with PRISMA guidance16. Extracted data will be
presented in summary tables to meet the primary objective of this review.
Given the expected heterogeneity in study designs, models included in analysis (including in vivo and
in vitro human and animal studies), and methods for measuring ACE2, meta-analysis via forest plots
will not be appropriate. A narrative synthesis of results will be produced. Where inconsistencies are
identified in the effect of a drug between studies, we will consider additional data such as materials,
quality of study, and outcome measurement for potential explanatory factors.
PPI

Patients and the public were not directly involved in the design of this study due to funding
limitations. We have invited patients to help us to develop our dissemination strategy.
Amendments

Any amendments to this protocol will be documented and communicated in the final prepared
manuscript.

Version 1
Dissemination

The results of this review will be published in an open access journal to ensure free and immediate
access for researchers and clinicians. Findings will also be disseminated in various media including
through presentation at medical conferences and through digital platforms, including research group
websites and social media.

Discussion
Summary

This review will deliver timely and key answers to an important question amidst the COVID-19 pandemic: do
any routinely prescribed drugs up- or down-regulate ACE2 expression and therefore play a potential role in
disease transmission?
Strengths and limitations

The strengths of this review protocol include its broad search strategy; inclusion of both human and animal
studies; inclusion of studies from all languages; and the intention to rapidly assess and synthesise the evidence
to meet the pressing research needs of the COVID-19 pandemic. Weaknesses include anticipated
heterogeneity across animal and human models which may complicate result interpretation. Furthermore, we
do not intend to contact authors of papers to obtain missing data due to the need to urgently report findings
amidst the current pandemic.
Comparison to existing literature

We believe this to be the first systematic review assessing associations between drug exposure and ACE2
expression for drugs routinely prescribed in the UK.
Implications for practice

Identification of the best evidence on these drugs might, for example, inform clinicians considering whether
patients should be advised to stop ACE inhibitors21. Conversely, drugs which are associated with ACE2
downregulation might represent a therapeutic strategy to reduce viral transmission and disease spread.
