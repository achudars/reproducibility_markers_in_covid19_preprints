Abstract
Background. The US Food and Drug Administration authorized Convalescent Plasma (CCP) therapy for
hospitalized COVID-19 patients via the Expanded Access Program (EAP) and the Emergency Use
Authorization (EUA), leading to use in about 500,000 patients during the first year of the pandemic for
the US.
Methods. We tracked the number of CCP units dispensed to hospitals by blood banking organizations
and correlated that usage with hospital admission and mortality data.
Results. CCP usage per admission peaked in Fall 2020, with more than 40% of inpatients estimated to
have received CCP between late September and early November 2020. However, after randomized
controlled trials failed to show a reduction in mortality, CCP usage per admission declined steadily to a
nadir of less than 10% in March 2021. We found a strong inverse correlation (r = -0.52, P = 0.002)
between CCP usage per hospital admission and deaths occurring two weeks after admission, and this
finding was robust to examination of deaths taking place one, two or three weeks after admission.
Changes in the number of hospital admissions, SARS-CoV-2 variants, and age of patients could not
explain these findings. The retreat from CCP usage might have resulted in as many as 29,000 excess
deaths from mid-November 2020 to February 2021.
Conclusions. A strong inverse correlation between CCP use and mortality per admission in the USA
provides population level evidence consistent with the notion that CCP reduces mortality in COVID-19
and suggests that the recent decline in usage could have resulted in excess deaths.

Introduction
In the Spring of 2020, the United States embarked on a historic and unprecedented deployment of
plasma derived from patients who survived COVID-19 (COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma (CCP)) for
treatment of the disease, and one-year into this effort more than 500,000 individuals have been treated.
The synergism created by the lack of effective alternate therapies, a plentiful supply of plasma from an
efficient and high-capacity blood banking network, motivated donors and strong community partners
fueled this deployment. Sensible US FDA regulatory oversight was provided first by its Expanded Access
Program (EAP) in partnership with the Mayo Clinic, with first transfusion on early April 2020,1 and then
by its Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of August 23, 2020, both of which restricted CCP use to
hospitalized patients 2.
The demonstration by the summer of 2020 that CCP was safe 3,4, that antibody in plasma correlated with
survival in people treated before ventilation 5 along with initial suggestions of efficacy 6-8, fueled interest
in and use of this product. However, the interpretation of the potential efficacy of CCP is complex as
many of the positive findings arose through post hoc examinations and subgroup comparisons.
Nonetheless, the use of CCP rose rapidly without the ideal evidence base of efficacy from randomized
controlled clinical trials (RCT), since early RCTs though generally trending positively, were unsatisfactory,
mostly due to small size or premature termination as the epidemic abated in the early surge regions 9.
Later in the pandemic several larger RCTs reported no mortality benefit 10-12, raising doubts as to CCP
efficacy. However, these latter trials were undertaken in hospitalized patients treated late in the course
of disease and some used plasma with variable antibody levels 9, and contrasted with a highly successful
trial in elderly patients treated within 3 days of illness onset prior to hospitalization 13. Despite potential
explanations for the negative studies, the results of these studies were sometimes accompanied by
editorials that reinforced message of futility with the British Medical Journal calling CCP ‘ineffective’ 14,
Nature Biotechnology reported that CCP fell ‘flat’ 15 and JAMA published a meta-analysis of RCT
concluding that there was no evidence of benefit from CCP therapy 16. On February 17, 2021 the Wall
Street Journal reported that Mount Sinai Hospital, which had been a leader in deploying CCP and
reported early encouraging results 8, had stopped using plasma in patients with COVID-19, and the
report specifically mentioned the negative results from CCP RCTs in this decision 17.
On March 13, 2021 the New York Times reported that COVID-19 mortality remained high with nearly
1,500 daily deaths despite a drop in the number of new infections since earlier in the year 18. This
finding was surprising in light of an apparent reduction in the mortality of hospitalized patients as the
epidemic progressed, thought to be from improved management of the disease as clinical experience
grew 19. Analyzing weekly reports from the blood banking industry, we noted that plasma use was on
the decline, based on the ratio of units dispensed to hospital admissions. The increase in mortality
combined with the reduction in CCP use led us to hypothesize first, that the two phenomena were
related, and second, that the decline in CCP use reflected reduced use following the disappointing trial
findings. The blood banking network maintains careful and complete records for every blood product
unit used including time, date and geographic provenance and destination, providing a virtually
complete record of trends in CCP use for the US. We therefore examined the use of CCP units as a
function of time, assessing the relationship of CCP use to COVID-19 mortality, denominating both
plasma units and deaths to hospital admissions. The aim of the study was to determine whether the
reduction in plasma use was associated with any change in the pattern of mortality seen in patients
hospitalized for COVID-19.

Materials and Methods
Convalescent Plasma Usage. CCP usage was inferred from the distribution of plasma units to hospitals in
the USA from data obtained from Blood Centers of America (BCA, West Warwick, RI). Data fields
included collections, distributions to hospitals, distributions to research or other use. This file
consolidated all the reports from regional blood bank reports and provided a total of collected units and
units distributed to hospitals. The data file did not have information on whether a unit was actually
transfused but BCA can infer usage from hospital re-ordering information and there has been a strong
correlation between the total number of units shipped to a hospital and the units transfused by that
hospital. Hence, the CCP units dispensed to hospitals represent a reasonable proxy value for the total
number of units being transfused to patients. To validate this assumption, we compared the numbers of
plasma units dispensed to those used by the EAP. There was a powerful and significant correlation
between the weekly counts of units distributed in the United States and those used to treat patients as
part of the EAP between April 06 and August 23, 2020. (Spearman rho = 0.953, P<0.001) (Figure S1).
Units transfused in the EAP were reported by providers as part of the official case report forms and each
transfusion could comprise one or two units.
Admission and mortality data. For population level data on COVID-19 admissions and mortality we
relied on publicly available databases. Specifically, we used information from the Our World in Data
(OWID) (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) database. Data used for this analysis were
downloaded on March 18, 2021 and are available as Supplemental Table S1. We confirmed these
findings using Centers for Disease Control (CDC, Atlanta, GA) data on admissions and deaths
https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#new-hospital-admissions and https://covid.cdc.gov/coviddata-tracker/#trends_dailytrendsdeaths. CDC data were downloaded on 3/31/2021, and are available
as Supplemental Table S2.
Statistical analysis. Preliminary descriptive analyses were used to explore the associations of the ratio of
number of CCP units dispersed to the number of hospitalizations (CCP utilization ratio) with the ratio of
national deaths to national admissions, the latter being a reasonable proxy for the case fatality rate. No
individual-level data were available to link the mortality events directly to the individuals hospitalized to
permit a calculation of the true case-fatality rate. To address this limitation, the mortality counts
reported by the CDC were shifted to better align the deaths with the admitted patients. Since the
overwhelming majority of COVID-19 deaths occur in hospitals 20,21, since CCP is only authorized for use in
hospitals, and since death generally occurs a few days to weeks after admission, mortality was adjusted
for the time lag between admission and death. The median time between admission and death has been
reported as 9 days in the US 22 and 6.7 days in Belgium 23. For the analysis, which was based on weekly
aggregated data, a two-week shift was selected to align the mortality with the median and upper
quartile estimates in these reports. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to describe the
relationship of the CCP utilization ratio with CFR. To further define this relationship, a linear statistical
model was used to regress the utilization ratio onto CFR. This statistical model was weighted by the
number of hospitalizations per week. The fit of the model was examined using standard residual-based
diagnostic plots and the fit was deemed acceptable using only a linear fit of the CCP utilization ratio.
Three in silico scenarios were created to summarize the effect of alterations to the CCP utilization ratio
using the fitted model. In scenario 1, the effect of maintenance of plasma usage was considered. To
define maintenance of use, a weighted average of the utilization ratio over the months of August

through September 2020 was estimated. This value was then used to estimate the number of deaths
that would be expected to occur throughout the study period (admissions starting 8/3/2020 –
2/22/2021). In scenario 2 a constant 50% CCP utilization ratio was set over the entire study period. The
utilization rate was approximately the value observed in the early October 2020 period. A final scenario
estimated the CFR that may have been observed had CCP not been used at all (i.e., the y-intercept from
the model). Model contrasts were used to estimate the change in expected deaths among these
scenarios in addition to a fourth condition – the actual number of events reported by the CDC. Values
are summarized based on the observed number of hospitalized patients over the study period along
with the same values indexed into expected mortality events per 1000 hospitalizations. Pointwise
confidence bands for each scenario were obtained by multiplying the model-predicted CFR, and its
associated 95% confidence interval, by the number of hospitalizations per week. Cumulative
summations were used to describe the differences in expected deaths over the entire study period. This
analysis was repeated independently a third time using a weighted average of utilization ratio of the
months October-November on a separate database (OWID) to investigate stability between reporting
bodies. As a final method for estimating the overall effect of the changes in CCP utilization, the CDC data
were grouped into two time periods representing relative use. The difference in the CFR was used to
estimate the expected value for the changes in the expected number of deaths.
Statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.6.2.24 95% confidence intervals and two-sided pvalues were used to summarize association and test for significance at the alpha=0.05 level of
significance, respectively.
Results
Convalescent plasma use.
The FDA first allowed compassionate use of CCP on a case-by-case basis in late March 2020, but very
quickly initiated the Expanded Access Program in early April 2020. The EAP was, in effect, a registry of
all CCP use in the US from April to August 2020 and led to a sharp rise in CCP use. The findings of the
EAP, which established that CCP was as relatively safe 3,4, and that high antibody titer was associated
with lower mortality in unventilated plasma recipients 5, were major considerations behind the
Emergency Use Authorization of August 23, 2020, which broadened its use. Distribution of CCP to
hospitals rose to 25,000 - 30,000 weekly units by the December 2020 to January 2021 time period, but
this rise in plasma distribution largely reflected the great increase in hospital admissions for COVID in
those months. (Figure 1). When CCP distributions are analyzed as a function of the number of new
hospital admissions per week, peak utilization per capita occurred much earlier, in early October 2020
and declined sharply in the following months (Figure 2).
Correlation between CCP and mortality.
To explore whether there was a relationship between CCP distribution in the USA and mortality we first
compared the doses per patient versus reported COVID-19 deaths per hospital admission from publicly
available databases (Figure 2). The comparison of curves showed a trough in deaths per admission
coinciding with the peak of CCP usage per admission. A plot of mortality versus doses per hospitalized
patient using mortality per admission data from the OWID database revealed a strong negative
correlation (Pearson’s correlation coefficient of -0.52 with P = 0.002) (Figure 3). To account for lags in
the reporting of death that vary by state, we also investigated whether this correlation was maintained

while adding weeks to the time between admission and death (Figure S2). Additionally, as we show in
Supplemental Figure 3, if plasma use is divided into quintiles from lowest using weeks to highest using
weeks, a dose-response relationship between use of plasma and mortality is apparent.
Estimates of excess deaths.
The linear model using the CCP utilization ratio to predict the CFR fit the data well in that this model
explained 25% (R2 = 0.254) of the variance of CFR using only the CCP utilization ratio. The model
estimated the CFR decreased by 1.8 percentage points for every 10-percentage point increase in the
rate of utilization of CCP (p = 0.004). The linear regression analysis yielded a mortality in patients not
receiving CCP of 25.2% as the y-intercept. A comparison of this number with that from USA studies
shows reasonable agreement between with the average mortality of 23.5% in patients not receiving CCP
(Table S3). This percentage also closely matches the 24% mortality for COVID-19 patients for the large
RECOVERY trial in the United Kingdom 12 and the 30% mortality of patients receiving late CCP in analysis
from the Expanded Access Program 5. An extrapolation of the linear model to the situation where every
patient is treated with CCP yields a mortality of 7.6%, which is lower than the average mortality in USA
studies, but still within the range reported (Table S3). However, this extrapolation to maximal use is
much less reliable given the absence of points in the y axis region above an CCP utilization ratio of 0.6
and uncertainty as to whether the relationship is linear in those ranges. Hence, we caution the reader
about making any strong inference from this estimate while noting that it is close to the 6.2% mortality
reported for COVID-19 patients treated with high titer CCP very early upon hospitalization 25.
Nevertheless, it is possible to use these efficacy numbers to estimate what the effect on deaths would
have been had the United States continued to use CCP at the height of its usage in early Fall 2020, when
more than 40% of all patients received plasma therapy.
With this model as a framework for estimating the excess number of deaths, the results of three
scenarios were obtained (Figure 4). The total observed deaths over the study period was 356,534. Had
the rate of CCP utilization observed during August through October 2002 carried over for the remaining
months, the expected number of deaths was 327,516 (95%: CI: 293,811 to 361,221), which would result
in 29,018 (95% CI: 3535 to 54,501) fewer deaths than observed. This excess death, in comparison, was
small relative to the estimate that results from assuming plasma utilization was as high as it was after
the EUA was issued. Had 50% utilization of plasma been continued, 62,383 (95% CI: 7599 to 117,166)
fewer deaths may have been observed. Under the most extreme scenario comparing no plasma use to
the highest observed use, a difference of 158,409 (95% CI: 19,296 to 297,523) deaths is estimated. We
repeated this analysis independently for each of the databases used (CDC vs OWID) with concordant
results (Figure S5 and Tables S1, S2).
As an alternative method to estimating the excess deaths, which alleviated the need for a model, the
data were summarized into two key periods (Table 1). In each of the seven weeks from September 21st
to November 8th, 2020, the estimated proportion of in-patients transfused with convalescent plasma
42.6%. The two-week lagged mortality ratio for hospitalized patients was 18.16%. In the following
period from 11/9/2021 to the week starting 3/22/21, transfusion rates declined steadily, averaging
27.4%. In parallel, mortality ratio rose to 20.08% for the 1,344,463 patients admitted in those 18 weeks.
Table 1 shows that if the mortality rate in those 18 weeks had been the same as during the hightransfusion period, 25,871 fewer deaths would have taken place.

Discussion
The use of CCP in hospitalized patients peaked from mid-September to the end of October 2020 shortly
after the FDA allowed its widespread use under the EUA of August 23, 2020. This increase was not
blunted by some claims that evidence of efficacy was insufficient for the authorization, 26,27 However,
RCTs from India 10 and Argentina 11 reporting that CCP use did not reduce mortality in hospitalized
patients were followed by a decline in use in November. This decline was accelerated after the
RECOVERY trial in the UK issued a January, 2021 news release announcing no effect of CP on mortality 12.
The pattern suggests that physicians were more influenced by clinical research data than by the
controversies that played out in the media. A poll by the American Association of Blood Banks revealed
a 50% increase in the number of institutions planning to stop offering CCP between February and March
2021, which cited lack of stronger efficacy data as the major reason for this decision 28.
The results show that CCP use per hospital admission closely paralleled the severity of the epidemic
throughout much of 2020, increasing in parallel with hospital admissions, but then declined late in 2020
and in the early months of 2021, a time following the publication of several negative RCT studies. Of
concern, the drop in per capita CCP utilization appeared to be associated with an increase in mortality
among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. If there is a causal link between these two trends, we estimate
that the decline in per capita CCP use resulted in 29,000-36,000 excess deaths. Given that this analysis
was done during the ongoing pandemic and that the variables that affect mortality are not fully
understood we urge caution with our findings. Nevertheless, applying Occam’s razor to the problem,
the results do raise the disturbing possibility that reduced CCP use may have contributed to the deaths
of thousands of patients.
While the relationship we describe needs to be interpreted with caution, several aspects of the
evidentiary landscape point to CPP efficacy when used appropriately.

An analysis of several dozen studies for which results were available by mid-January 2021
associated the administration of CCP with reduced mortality, with an effect size of ~35% 29.
Convalescent plasma has proven effective in individuals with defective humoral immunity and B
cell defects 30,31.
The active agent in plasma, antibody titer, is strongly related to mortality in transfused patients
5,13,32

The active agent of CCP, specific antibody to SARS-CoV-2, has powerful antiviral activity and has
been shown to reduce the viral load in patients with COVID-19, thus providing a mechanistic
explanation for its therapeutic effect 33.
Human convalescent plasma is protective in murine models of COVID-19 34.
Patients treated with CCP manifest reduced inflammatory markers 35-37 that can lead to host
damage. 38
Research has identified nine places where plasma affects the cascade of inflammation to the
benefit of treated patients 39.

Late use of plasma, or use in people with advanced illness, is not likely to be effective, because at that
time, the inflammatory response itself is the major pathophysiologic pathway to severe illness and
death, by which time antibody is powerless to change the course of illness. 40

The results of RCTs are mixed, but many trials treated very advanced disease. For example, while the
overall findings of the RECOVERY trial were null 12, patients treated early in the course of illness (before
antibody conversion, in the first seven days, not receiving steroids or oxygen) all showed lower mortality
in the CPP arm.
The observed association between CCP use per hospitalized patient and mortality helps define the
potential for effectiveness of this therapy at a population level. This inference is strengthened by the
fact that mortality from COVID-19 among hospitalized patients decreased substantially over most of
2020, consistent with worldwide trends 19, but then began to rise in late November and early December
2020, a period that coincided with precipitous reduction in CCP/admission.
Buttressing such a conclusion would require excluding the contribution of other variables that can affect
mortality, which is challenging during an ongoing pandemic where information about the
pathophysiology and clinical course of COVID-19 is accruing rapidly. Three factors can be excluded. The
mean age of the hospital population with COVID-19 was actually older during peak use of CCP than later.
The number of hospital admissions per week was not associated with increased mortality. The
occasional delay seen in recording of death certificate information would apply largely to the most
recent months when mortality was already highest. This analysis – based as it is on ecological
correlations - must acknowledge some critical limitations. Many possible confounders are not available
to evaluate for this analysis.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with higher mortality is another variable that must be
considered. In the United Kingdom a new lineage of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in the September 2020
known as B.1.1.7, which is associated with higher contagiousness and perhaps, mortality 41. This variant
was identified in the United States in early winter 2021 but as of January only 76 cases had been
described in 12 states, which was estimated to be <0.5% of the infections at the time 42. Hence this
variant constituted a small minority of cases during much of the time involved in our analysis. Even as
late as mid-March 2021 the CDC estimated that B.1.1.17 variant comprised only 25% of US isolates and
increased mortality from these infections would not manifest itself until times later than our analysis 43.
Limiting our analysis to the time from March 2020 to January 2021 shows maintenance of the trends
described here.
Taking a page from the reluctance of citizens to accept vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, a phenomenon that
has been termed ‘vaccine hesitancy’ 44, we call the phenomenon of reduced use of CCP ‘plasma
hesitancy’. In this regard, we note that both the vaccines being administered in the USA and CCP are
being used under a EUA regulatory framework, since neither has full approval status and that these
hesitancies lead to avoidance behaviors based on the interpretation of available data by the public and
health care providers, respectively. Plasma hesitancy may be a result of health care providers
overvaluing and over-emphasizing negative results from RCT findings while dismissing other evidence
that CCP reduces mortality. On the other hand, remdesevir has been widely embraced by the health
care provider community for treatment of Sars-CoV2, despite a lack published data on reductions in
mortality from its use and with conflicting RCT data regarding its clinical usefulness 45,46. In contrast, CCP
has some data demonstrating a reduction in mortality for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from its
early use in non-ventilated patients29, and clear evidence of effectiveness in outpatients13 and yet has
met with use hesitancy.

Why might this be? One possibility is that there is relatively little recent experience with treating
infectious diseases with antibody therapies 40. The different receptions for plasma and for chemical
agents could reflect confirmational bias by a health care community experienced in the successful use of
antiviral drugs against Human immunodeficiency (HIV) and Hepatitis C (HCV) viruses.
In summary, CCP is one of few options available to physicians for treating COVID-19. It is available
wherever there are recovered patients, it is relatively inexpensive and has a good safety profile 3. With
regards to its efficacy, we have argued that physicians need to consider all the evidence, from
observational studies to RCTs, when evaluating clinical efficacy data 47. We note that the FDA reaffirmed
the EUA status of CCP in February 2021 2 by permitting its continued use in hospitalized patients if used
early in COVID-19 and with units that have a sufficient content of specific antibody. In addition, interim
guidelines for American Association of Blood Banks 48 and Brazil 49 emphasize that CCP is more likely to
be effective when used in early COVID-19 with units having high content of specific antibody. We are
hopeful that physicians consider the totality of the available evidence, including our findings, when
making decisions for CCP use in individual patients.

Figure 4. Estimated deaths under modeled scenarios of Covid-19 Convalescent Plasma. Panel A presents
the longitudinal observed (dashed line) and modeled number of deaths under three scenarios for CCP
over the study period (8/3/2020 – 2/22/2021) that included 356,534 deaths in 1,793,502 hospitalized
patients. Over the entire study period, the CCP utilization ratio was 29.1%. In the scenario labeled
maintenance of plasma, the CCP utilization ratio was set to 39.5%. With the no plasma and 50% plasma
usage scenarios, the CCP utilization ratio was set at 0% and 50%, respectively. Panel B provides the
pairwise comparisons of these scenarios to estimate the difference in expected number of deaths
among the scenarios for the entire hospitalized patients (upper right triangle) and re-indexed to events
per 1000 patients (lower left triangle). The rows represent the comparator or reference scenario,
columns indicate the altered CCP use scenario. For example, the cell that intersects the observed deaths
and the maintenance of plasma column shows that 29,018 fewer deaths would result had plasma use
remained at the 39.5% level.

Supplementary Figure 1. Correlation of convalescent plasma distribution and usage within the
Expanded Access Program. Shown is the progressive increase in the number of convalescent plasma
units distributed in the United States and convalescent plasma units used in the Expanded Access
Program (EAP). Data between April 06 and August 23, 2020 are pooled in weekly intervals and
represented as filled circles. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to assess correlation (r=
0.946, P<0.001) and a LOESS smoother with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and a reference line were
overlayed. Points below the reference line represent weeks where more convalescent plasma was
distributed than used within the EAP. Conversely, points above the reference line are indicative of more
convalescent plasma being used in the EAP than distributed.

Supplemental Figure 2. A series of linear regressions and Pearson’s correlation tests comparing weekly
reported deaths to new weekly hospital admissions, offset by various numbers of weeks to identify the
length of lag between admission and death of patients. Y axes values reflect the parameter of each gray
box throughout the shifted weeks. Correlations peak at 2-3 weeks shifted, suggesting the lag time
between admission and reported death is roughly two weeks

Supplemental Figure 4. Investigation of high age group mortality. The shifted mortality is compared to
the percent of hospitalized patients 65+ each week as reported by the CDC. There is no significant
correlation between the two variables, suggesting changes in mortality are not explainable by an
increase in hospitalized high risk patients.
