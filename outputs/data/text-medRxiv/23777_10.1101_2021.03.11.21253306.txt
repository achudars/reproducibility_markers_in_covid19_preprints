ABSTRACT
Medical education in Ghana has been affected in many ways by the onslaught of the COVID19 pandemic. Though the pandemic has affected both preclinical and clinical segments of
medical education, the effect has been felt more at the clinical stage. Medical students on
vacation who started their clinical training abroad could not return to their destination of
study to complete their programme because of COVID-19 linked travel restrictions. This
qualitative study examined how COVID-19 impacted on teaching and learning at a public
higher education institution offering clinical medical education in Ghana for over 200
medical students. These medical students were from three different higher education
institutions with varied curriculum outcomes. Thus, for them to be considered as a single
group required innovativeness on the part of administrators. Open-ended interviews were
held with administrators and the outcome indicated that salient aspects of the clinical training
process had been impacted. These included administration of clinical education, curriculum,
student learning, student assessment and code of practice. As a result of the pandemic,
student learning shifted from traditional face to face interaction to online learning at the
beginning. Some of the administrative challenges that ensued included the need for reduced
number of students per tutor and introduction of afternoon sessions with a limited budget.
The paper concludes that COVID-19 has been disruptive to traditional medical education in
Ghana. However, the novel learning processes may provide opportunities to increase access
to medical education using a phased system of learning. The findings from this study should
have implications for policy and contribute to the discourse on blended learning in medical
education in Ghana while ensuring that quality is maintained in all instances.

Introduction

32

COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a number of transformations in the education sector

33

globally and the medical education unit has not been spared [1]. Clinical and practical

34

components of medical education that had been handled on a face-to-face basis for decades

35

had to be suddenly revised and transformed into a blend of online and limited face-to-face

36

programmes while ensuring that COVID-19 protocols were observed to guarantee faculty and

37

student safety. Suffice it to say that in the Sub-Saharan African country of Ghana, the global

38

COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the traditional model of medical education which, over a

39

long period of time has been very conservative in its structure and function [2].

40

Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused an overhaul of medical school orthodoxy that

41

whilst disruptive, may serve to expose institutions to novel means of teaching and assessment

42

which may ultimately improve medical education in the future [3]. In Ghana, COVID-19 has

43

interrupted the clinical aspect of medical education in many ways. During a three-week

44

lockdown in Ghana which ended on April 19, 2020 clinical medical education was suspended

45

just like any other educational activity. After the lifting of the three-week lockdown and

46

easing of some restrictions, medical students in higher education institutions undertaking

47

clinical components, transitioned to a blended form of learning. Initially, medical students

48

were reluctant to attend classes for fear of contracting the virus even with all the safety

49

protocols in place, and this affected teaching and learning. However, with counselling and

50

assurance from administrators of these institutions, the students gradually eased into the

51

learning mode. The students also attended classes with new codes of dressing proffered by

52

the administration. Findley [4] notes that when students returned to clinical rotation

53

eventually, all didactic teaching have evolved to online formats. Moreover, clinical

54

experiences of students had to come with the wearing of personal protective equipment and

55

maintenance of social distance. Faculty members and administrators also had to be creative in

56

their clinical supervision of students.

57

In line with safety protocols, there were fewer number of cases for teaching the clinical

58

component in Ghana’s higher education institutions. In addition to merging some of the

59

lessons, administrators ensured that class sizes were reduced to prevent infection while e-

60

learning was rapidly deployed as a means of teaching. Research indicate that the beginning of

61

the pandemic led to a suspension of didactic teaching to be replaced by live-stream

62

synchronous or recorded lectures which negatively impacted collaborative experiences and

63

communication skills of students [ 5, 4, 6].

64

Medical education in Ghana is a five and a half year programme consisting of preclinical and

65

clinical stages. The clinical stage of training includes in-hospital clinical rotations, theoretical

66

lectures and at the same time revolves around patient interaction which aids in understanding

67

the pathology of diseases. Traditionally it was structured on face-to-face communication

68

(history taking) and physical contact (physical examination). This method of teaching thus

69

required close contact with patients whose diseases were not predetermined. Indeed the

70

essence of the clinical training stage is for the student to interact, determine the disease and

71

plan an appropriate management. Since COVID -19 has been known to have a direct human

72

to human transmission as well as a high morbidity and mortality rate the traditional clinical

73

training mode was affected. One key mode of transmission is contact with an infected person

74

in an unprotected manner. However, as most infected persons may be asymptomatic,

75

preventive measures required distancing and reduced contact. The combination of the disease

76

transmission, its fatality and preventive measures have greatly impacted the clinical stage of

77

medical education. According to Findley [4] classes for medical students in clinical training

78

in Texas, U.S.A. who were inured to the hands-on nature of clinical medical education, were

79

suspended to among others, protect students and ensure social distance in clinical settings.

80

Notably, the transition to a blend of both online and limited face-to-face contact was not

81

without its challenges as students needed this fusion to enable the efficient practical

82

application of theories learnt [5, 4, 6].

83

Invariably, the COVID-19 pandemic has obliged administrators of higher education

84

institutions to be innovative in their ability to replicate some of the face-to-face clinical

85

contact and engagement into a virtual environment. Thus, this paper aims to describe and

86

explain the experiences of a higher education institution offering clinical medical education

87

during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ghana. These experiences have come with challenges and

88

opportunities for administrators, faculty members and students. It is worthy of note that a

89

number of publications have examined student experiences in this pandemic (5, 4, 7] but

90

there is a dearth of papers on how institutions offering medical education have coped with the

91

pandemic [8] especially in the Sub-Saharan African region generally and Ghana in particular.

92

This paper therefore attempts to bridge this gap by offering a Ghanaian perspective about

93

innovative practices adapted in teaching and learning in view of resource challenges that

94

higher educational institutions in developing countries are encountering in the midst of the

95

pandemic. Three research questions guided this study: (a) How has departmental

96

administrators of a higher education institution offering clinical medical education in Ghana

97

adapted teaching and learning to the COVID-19 pandemic? (b) How did the administrators

98

overcome challenges associated with the shift to a blend of online learning and limited face to

99

face interaction? (c) How were the clinical rotations of three different groups of students

100

managed simultaneously?

101

Method

102

This qualitative study purposefully selected and interviewed six departmental administrators

103

from a Ghanaian public higher education institution that has provided clinical training to

104

undergraduate medical students for a number of decades. The study employed an in-depth

105

unstructured open-ended interview protocol. The objective of the interview method was to

106

obtain salient information from the administrators regarding the processes that had gone into

107

the provision of blended learning to medical students undergoing clinical training in the era

108

of COVID-19. Interviewing is an effective means to gain insights into experiences and

109

perspectives of administrators in a higher education institution [9]. Similarly, according to

110

Rubin and Rubin [10] interviews are very beneficial because they enable the researcher to

111

decipher what has happened, why and what it largely means. The 37 Military hospital was

112

selected for the study because it is a tertiary facility that provides final year clinical training

113

for undergraduate medical students in surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatrics and

114

internal medicine trained both in and outside the country. It is significant to note that during

115

the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the hospital had over 200 students from three higher

116

education institutions (namely a public, private and a foreign medical school) undertaking

117

clinical rotations simultaneously and at various stages of training. Students from the public

118

and private medical schools were taking their regular clinical courses while the foreign

119

medical students were included due to air travel restrictions during the pandemic. Previously

120

these rotations were staggered such that each category had its own period of clinical rotation.

121

The 37 Military hospital coordinated with all three institutions and adapted its own situation

122

to facilitate the provision of clinical training programmes. The clinical programme is

123

supervised by the undergraduate unit of the hospital and implemented by six clinical

124

departments namely Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Units, Obstetrics and Gynaecology,

125

Medicine, Paediatrics, Public Health and Surgery. The Department of Surgery is made up six

126

core units namely Cardiothoracic, General Surgery, Orthopedics and Truama, Plastic and

127

Reconstructive, Urology and Neurosurgery. Other associated units are Opthalmolgy,

128

Ortholaryngology and Maxillofascial. The Medical Department has subspecialty units

129

including Cardiology, Nephrology, Diabetes and Endocrinology, Respiratory, Nephrology,

130

Dermatology, Psychology, General Medicine and the Haematology unit. The Paediatric unit

131

has a Neonatal Intensive Care unit and a Paediatric emergency unit. It runs specialist clinics

132

in Cardiovascular, Sickle Cell, and General Paediatrics. The Obstetrics and Gynaecology

133

Department has separate Gynaecological and Obstetrics emergency units. The Public Health

134

Department has all the components of preventive health and has clinics and programmes

135

from mother and child welfare as well as infectious disease clinics. This unit is involved in

136

community health and public health education campaigns

137

In this study, all six participants were recruited by the lead researcher in October 2020 from

138

the departments that constitute the undergraduate unit. Telephone and face-to-face interviews

139

as the situation demanded were conducted while obeying all the COVID-19 safety protocols.

140

These contacts with participants were made after the clinical training sessions for final year

141

students had ended. The study was also approved by the lead researcher’s Institutional

142

Review Board (IRB) with reference number 37MH-IRB/NF/IPN/467/2020. An unstructured

143

open-ended interview protocol served as a guide for the data collection. The lead researcher

144

conducted all interviews in person and permission was sought from the participants to audio

145

record. When interviews are recorded, it offers an accurate data capture [11]. In order to

146

maintain confidentiality, actual participant names were not included in the study. The

147

duration of each interview ranged from 50 minutes to about an hour and a half. Copies of the

148

interview protocols, which were informed by the research questions guiding the study, were

149

given to the participants prior to the interview date. Essentially, the interview schedule for the

150

administrators focused on how they have adapted teaching and learning to the era of COVID-

151

19 and addressed challenges encountered among others.

152

The transcripts from the interviews with each participant were coded separately through the

153

application of content analysis by using both inductive and deductive approaches [12]. The

154

coding was done manually by reading through the interview transcripts several times to look

155

for repeating ideas that were relevant to the research questions among others. Each interview

156

transcript was read at least three times to acquaint the researchers with the themes that would

157

emerge from the coding process. The researchers also undertook open coding of the

158

transcripts to be followed by axial coding by developing categories. The researchers

159

examined themes that emerged from the interviews both deductively and inductively and

160

looked for linkages and patterns among themes. Descriptive categories were identified and

161

copies of the interview transcripts and emergent themes were sent to participants by email.

162

The participants acknowledged that the interpretation of the data was accurate after reviewing

163

the transcripts. To further ensure reliability and validity of data analysed, there was member

164

checking thus, a peer reviewer reviewed all the codes to eliminate possible research bias.

165

Results

166

The outcomes of the study are reported under the following thematic areas namely:

167

administration of clinical education, student learning, curriculum, student assessment, code of

168

practice, opportunities and challenges

169

Administration of Clinical Education

170

The participants noted that they had to think outside the box to enable the smooth running of

171

the clinical component of education as well as address some of the challenges that this

172

pandemic has brought about. The clinical part of medical education is indicated as a very

173

critical component of the training process, without which a medical student will not be able to

174

graduate and practice. A participant from the undergraduate unit noted that discussions were

175

held with stakeholder establishments regarding the clinical rotation of medical students and

176

the need for those in their final year to complete their rotations and graduate. However, there

177

were challenges associated with the attainment of this objective. One participant that we will

178

call Kodjo stated:

179
180

The common theme among all the schools was the need to complete rotations and
graduate their final year group. The challenge for our institution was the aggregate

large number of students from the beneficiary institutions….. The 37 Military hospital
had adequate infrastructure and technology backbone to mitigate the impact of the
COVID -19 but there were still challenges with inter and intradepartmental
implementation of programmes. A centralised planning was done for the overall
implementation of programmes.

187

For very valid reasons, participants indicated that they had to find ways of balancing the need

188

to complete the academic calendar despite the substantial time lost because of the pandemic,

189

while incorporating social distance into the programmes. Student groups had to be reduced

190

from an average of 10 per tutor to five for clerkship rotation. Afternoon sessions which were

191

not the norm, were introduced to accommodate the increased student groups created as a

192

result of the pandemic. Another administrative concern that had to be addressed was

193

recruiting tutors on short term basis to meet the demands of COVID-19 protocols. This had

194

to be undertaken without an increase in either departmental or institutional administrative

195

budget. Some of the innovative activities that participants had to implement include ensuring

196

reduced face-to-face interactions and long hours of screen time [13]. Majority of the

197

participants agreed that the success of this blended form of clinical education may continue to

198

be the new normal for a while. However, it was imperative that the preliminary challenges

199

encountered were addressed efficaciously so that medical students get the best out of this

200

experience and eventually contribute their quota to the health field in the long run. Though

201

there is no clarity on the overall impact of COVID-19 on medical education and how the

202

current adaptions may influence its future, participants were of the view that the innovative

203

ways had yielded positive results [14]. Kwaku, a participant stated: Staggering the different

204

groups’ clinical rotation times was a useful approach to managing the large number of

205

students while adhering to the COVID-19 safety protocols.

206

Student Learning

207

Student learning has changed drastically in the era of COVID-19. As earlier indicated the

208

common mode of learning in clinical years in Ghana is by clerkship rotation at various
8

209

clinical wards, outpatient departments and theatres. The participants noted a need for

210

modification to two components of clinical teaching consisting of practical sessions and

211

classroom lectures/tutorials. Practical sessions were modified to have reduced numbers while

212

aspects of the classroom sessions were changed from face to face to online teaching.

213

However, the student numbers for the online teaching were kept unchanged. Before COVID-

214

19 struck, faculty members had to contend with large class sizes in didactic lectures and

215

clinical rotations. There was also institutional adoption of the creative use of video

216

conferencing, social media platforms, and usage of free open access medical tools. These

217

were used to maximum effect at departmental levels with Zoom video conferencing being the

218

most common method adopted [15, 16] according to majority of participants. Effecting

219

technology into medical education in Ghana, though distinct, had its challenges. Some of the

220

challenges encountered by students included bandwidth issues and reliable and stable internet

221

connectivity [16]. On a significant note, participants also observed that student attendance

222

and utilisation of library facilities increased during this COVID era.

223

Kwame (not his real name), a participant, made an important observation about faculty

224

members’ usage of technology. He stated: Younger faculty members found online learning

225

exciting and quickly adapted. On the other hand, older faculty members had initial

226

difficulties adapting. Further, there were limited clinical experiences sessions for students

227

mainly because of the imposed nationwide restrictions. These restrictions required medical

228

educators to outline priorities for the limited clinical experiences and design different

229

approaches to competency attainment [17]. Kwame further noted that: During the pre-

230

COVID era, practical sessions for medical students were held mainly in the morning but with

231

the onset of the pandemic, afternoon clinical training sessions were added to cater for the

232

increased numbers in student groupings.

233

The COVID-19 protocols that had to be adhered to included social distancing rules and the

234

wearing of personal protective equipment (PPE). Since the disease can cause life threatening

235

conditions instructors must deliver lectures safely, while ensuring the integrity and continuity

236

of the medical education process [18]. Consequently, participants were of the view that

237

emergency units that used to be a critical site for training, should be excluded because of

238

COVID-19, and this limited the number of cases for learning. They also note that before the

239

pandemic, students were expected to have daily contacts with patients but this was reduced

240

and replaced by tutor-led demonstration of clinical signs of diseases. During these

241

demonstrations, the tutors directed students on what to do and what to find on a patient.

242

In the pre-COVID era, students were to elicit their own findings based on lessons taught in

243

the classroom that encouraged a more hands-on process while the tutor corrects mistakes. The

244

present system under COVID, uses observation of patients by students to acquire the skill

245

needed for practice which is not desirable. It has been reported that in teaching by

246

observation, clinical learners are passive observers which indicates a low yield use of an

247

invaluable resource [19]. As an alternative to hands-on procedures, the institution introduced

248

the use of dummies and mannequins as replacement for live patients. During the clinical

249

training process, medical institutions in Ghana needed to ensure that students are exposed to a

250

wide range of cases including those that present as emergencies. But COVID-19 changed this

251

traditional learning trajectory as exposure to all emergencies was drastically reduced. Thus

252

medical students did not encounter many emergencies such as heart failure and ectopic

253

pregnancies. Moreover, administrators of medical institutions in Ghana had to ensure that

254

switching partly to online learning would not adversely affect student learning outcomes.

255

Curriculum

256

Data from the study indicates that the curriculum in clinical medical education in Ghana was

257

modified because of COVID-19. Sani [8] in examining the consequences of the pandemic on

258

curriculum delivery and student assessment in the UK, noted that many of the written

259

assessments were changed to open-book examinations by medical schools in response to the

260

COVID-19 pandemic. This raised a possible issue of examination being an inadequate

261

measure of students’ theoretical knowledge due to ease of access to online resources.

262

Overwhelmingly, the participants believed that as a result of COVID-19, curricula for the

263

clinical stages had to be redesigned to highlight the essential requirements that meets the

264

minimum standards of training. Changes had to be made to both content and duration

265

components of the course structure. It was a challenging task striking a balance between the

266

different curriculum requirements for the three groups of students. A participant that we will

267

call Ama noted:

268
269
270
271
272
273

In most instances about a quarter of the proposed programme had to be omitted according to

274

majority of the participants. This was to make up for time lost in the academic calendar. As

275

part of the innovations, lectures were done online at the beginning of the clinical rotation and

276

the practical sessions followed. This was intended to keep students away from the patients as

277

much as possible. Previously, lectures and practical sessions were held concurrently but with

278

this innovation, contact between students as well as the risk element was reduced by half. It is

279

anticipated that ingenuities of medical education will emerge out of the COVID-19 pandemic

280

[20]. Ultimately, curriculum revision resulted in reduced duration of contact and content.

281

Research further indicates that the beginning the pandemic led to suspension of didactic

282

teaching to be replaced by live-streams or recorded lectures. And this negatively impacted

283

collaborative experiences and communication skills of students [5, 4, 6].

The institutions made changes to curriculum used for training medical students. At
our Department, the mode of delivery of the curriculum content varied and changed
from online to demonstration teaching. The different institutions had varied
curriculum for the same clinical rotation.

284

Student Assessment

285

The goal of student assessment during clinical years is to meet requirements of the Medical

286

and Dental Council in Ghana and the universities of training. Prior to the onset of the

287

pandemic medical students’ assessment in Ghana was gradually shifting from the traditional

288

long case and short case type of assessment to the Objective Structured Clinical Examination

289

(OSCE). Notably, the participants were of the view that pandemic has accelerated the

290

introduction of OSCE into student assessment in medical education in Ghana. While OSCE

291

was suitable for the pandemic, a participant (Ama) stated: ….it had its drawback in difficulty

292

with implementation and maintenance of high standards set by most medical schools.

293

As a result of COVID-19, practical assessments had to be rescheduled; the implication being

294

that students had longer periods to prepare adequately for the practical component. The

295

participants further noted that clinical students’ end of rotation assessment took the form of

296

multiple choice questions and short answer clinical-based questions. Practical clinical

297

examinations and oral interviews were excluded.

Code of Practice

299

Data from this study indicates that the advent of COVID-19 has brought swift changes in the

300

code of practice for medical education in Ghana. The code of practice comprises student

301

dressing and preparation for clinical sessions among others. Participants noted that they had

302

to be creative in their supervision of students both theoretically and during practical sessions.

303

Previously, the dress code of medical students had traditionally been orthodox and

304

conservative where the student is expected to be attired in a formal dressing with a white

305

overcoat. But with the advent of the pandemic it meant that students have to appear in

306

“scrubs” (short sleeve dresses used for surgical operations) to protect them from infection. In

307

order for stakeholders to accept the current reality of new dress modes, they had to be

308

formally informed. One participant called Abena intimated that: It needed internal

309

communication to have all stakeholders accept the current reality. The reason being that this

310

was an alien practice to faculty members, hospital staff and clients attending hospitals. It thus

311

portrayed a sociocultural phenomenon of how society perceived medical students in training

312

as well as doctors.

313

It is significant to note that the use of the open book method of learning in wards and clinical

314

settings was not part of the traditional way of teaching and learning in Ghana. Students were

315

expected to have undertaken their reading before an outpatient ward or theatre session and

316

apply this knowledge acquired to practical scenarios but the pandemic changed this tradition.

317

COVID-19 also provided students with the opportunity to use technology to find information

318

during practical sessions. While the use of technology made some sessions disruptive because

319

students were online searching for answers, other tutors used the opportunity to motivate

320

students to research and stimulate self-directed learning at practical sessions. But some of the

321

participants indicated that students had difficulties with older faculty in this instance because

322

they regarded the use of gadgets in clinical sessions as inappropriate behaviour. There was

323

also a challenge regarding patients voluntarily offering themselves to be used for practical

324

sessions during this COVID-19 period. A participant that we will call Kofi stated: Patients

325

were not used to medical students searching for information online during clinical training

326

sessions. This affected their willingness to volunteer for teaching purposes.

327

Majority of the participants noted that privacy, a key component of medical interaction,

328

became a challenge due to fewer number of available patients. Therefore, students had to be

329

paired and patients had to be reused multiple times for training sessions. Providing medical

330

and personal history to more than one student for multiple times compromised privacy of

331

patients. The situation worsened when patients have to be subjected to physical examination

332

in the same manner. Eventually, the consequences were that parts of the examination were

333

excluded from the teaching sessions. A participant (called Kodjo) noted: It is yet to be

13

334

determined the effect of these practical sessions on the ability of trainees to perform these

335

examinations and make interpretations appropriately.

336

The elimination of some aspects of clinical education as a consequence of COVID-19 led to a

337

feeling of vulnerability among students as they could not be of immediate assistance to their

338

faculty members in the discharge of their clinical duties. The students did not partake in

339

frontline service provision perhaps from the fear of contracting COVID-19. However, the

340

students found ingenious ways of assisting medical personnel and were not directly involved

341

in the frontline service provision. In Singapore, medical students were involved in the design

342

of workflows for patient management [7]. Findley [4] also indicates that when students

343

returned to clinical rotation eventually, all didactic teaching have evolved to online formats.

344

Students had to wear personal protective equipment while maintaining social distance and

345

obeying all the safety protocols.

346

Opportunities and Challenges

347

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about opportunities as well as challenges in clinical

348

medical education in Ghana. Research indicates that the establishment of small groups or

349

interactive learning communities through leverages in technology such as webinars and

350

videoconferences has enhanced student learning experiences in this era while quality is not

351

sacrificed [5, 7, 8]. This was largely the observation in this study. Another major impact that

352

COVID-19 had on medical education is the cancellation of face-to-face conferences which

353

has affected medical students who require it in their applications for residency. This has

354

resulted in the demand for online conferences to enable prospective students participate. The

355

pandemic has therefore provided a need for leveraging technology such as

356

videoconferencing, teleconferencing, webinars and the usage of e-learning platforms for both

357

undergraduate and postgraduate medical education [5, 4, 6].

358

Nonetheless, Jaideep [6] is of the view that though teaching online during the pandemic is

359

now the new normal, it comes with challenges such as students’ inability to sufficiently meet

360

their learning goals in relation to internal assessment examinations and clinical ward rounds

361

among others. A participant indicated that some sessions were merged and others were not

362

completed as a result of the pandemic. This was done to enable final year medical students to

363

graduate. The suspension of in-person didactic class sessions among others, negatively

364

impacted on the capability of students to develop collaborative, clinical and communication

365

skill sets as well as group learning [5, 4, 7, 6]. Equally, a number of noticeable challenges

366

surfaced during this period. Majority of the participants indicated that as a result of multiple

367

student sessions at the clinical stage, there was the need for increased numbers of faculty

368

members and support staff though funding was not readily available. Also, it was sometimes

369

difficult to track student attendance online and attitude to practical sessions as there was

370

noticeable fatigue among faculty members resulting in cancelled lectures and practical

371

sessions. There was additional financial strain on the departments as administrative staff who

372

shared a common office had to relocate to a new building so that social distancing protocols

373

could be followed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This required the use of additional

374

resources and finances that had not been budgeted for. Financial constraints and work output

375

of support staff continue to be some of the pressing challenges in managing medical

376

education [21]. Kwame, a participant stated: ….. One other noticeable issue was that the

377

work output of administrative staff working from home in alternate weekly fashion decreased

378

when compared to work output in the pre-COVID era.

379

Discussion

380

This study examined the impact of COVID-19 on clinical medical education in Ghana from

381

the perspective of administrators of a higher education institution in Ghana, a country in Sub-

382

Saharan Africa. The outcome of the study noted themes such as administration of clinical

15

383

education, student learning, curriculum, student assessment, code of practice, opportunities

384

and challenges in the assessment of COVID-19’s impact on medical education in Ghana.

385

Some of the perspectives noted in this study aligned with what pertains globally [22]. The

386

participants generally noted that they had to think outside the box regarding clinical rotations

387

as well as determining innovative ways of completing the academic calendar to enable

388

medical students graduate and complement the national health workforce. The participants

389

for the first time, had to tussle with three student groups of varied backgrounds concurently.

390

Thus they had to run three different curricula simultaneously in a midst of a global pandemic.

391

The study further indicated that student learning changed from a face to face didactic

392

component to a blend with online and expansive use of technology. Younger faculty

393

members seamlessly adapted to technology usage as opposed to older faculty members who

394

had issues during the transitioning process. Students’ challenges with technology usage had

395

to do more with bandwidth issues, reliable and stable internet for online classes rather than

396

skill. Participants further noted that the regular class sizes also had to be reduced to ensure

397

that COVID-19 safety protocols such as social distancing and wearing of personal protective

398

equipment were adhered to. The reduction in class sizes however, came with faculty fatigue

399

as they had to do more sessions than they were previously accustomed to.

400

Emergency cases were also reduced in clinical training and this impacted on the collaborative

401

learning skills of students [5, 4, 6]. The adaption in practice where students have to appear in

402

protective equipment and scrubs aggregating around a patient was new to our sociocultural

403

practices. The absence of emergency cases for clinical education needs to be studied further

404

to determine its impact on performance in practice. This study highlights the need for a

405

harmonised curriculum among medical schools for effective administration of course content

406

during clinical years. The content should meet the minimum standard of care while preparing

407

students for new and unanticipated global emergency.

408

Student assessment also shifted from the traditional long case assessment to the Objective

409

Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). This was a rapid paradigm shift that students,

410

faculty members and administrators adapted to. The data suggests that though administrators

411

were ill prepared in terms of resources and training to undertake the OSCE but were able to

412

achieve the desired objective. OSCE is an expensive method for clinical assessment and the

413

cost must be adjusted in medical education funding. The use of OSCE as an assessment tool

414

is suitable in times of emergencies and provides a practical method in the absence of patients.

415

Findings from the study also indicate opportunities and challenges that participants had to

416

address. Some of the opportunities included the leveraging of technology for

417

videoconferencing, webinars and e-learning platforms for medical education as a result of the

418

pandemic [5, 4, 6]. Technology also had to be leveraged by the institution to foster

419

synchronous teaching and a limited face-to-face component, though it did not come without

420

its challenges such as quality of internet streaming [5, 4, 6, 23]. The code of practice relating

421

to student dressing changed as a result of COVID-19. The surge in technology usage in

422

clinical medical education has become the new normal. There is now a rise in online

423

conferences, interactive learning communities, webinars and video-conferences among others

424

through leverages in technology usage. These have enhanced student learning experiences in

425

the era of the pandemic while quality is not totally sacrificed [5, 7, 8]. There is an anticipated

426

prolonged lifespan of physical infrastructure from reduced usage and subsequent wear and

427

tear.

428

Challenges that participants indicated included inability to track student attendance since

429

some class sessions were held online. There was also limited opportunity to evaluate attitude

430

to practical sessions. Other challenges were inadequate funding and resources, and faculty

431

fatigue emanating from numerous class sessions scheduled to make up for lost time. The

432

participants noted that they had to find ways of balancing the need to complete the academic

433

calendar despite time gone, while incorporating all the needed safety protocols into the

434

clinical programmes. There were reported long hours of screen time and reduced face-to-face

435

interactions [13, 14]. Primarily before the onset of the pandemic, medical education in Ghana

436

had traditionally been a structured face-to-face communication. However, this structure has

437

changed in the COVID-19 era as administrators had to be innovative to continue the clinical

438

component of medical education. Moreover, the clinical experiences of students had to come

439

with the wearing of personal protective equipment and maintenance of social distance [14].

440

Some older faculty members were not too happy with the opportunity given to students to

441

look for answers online during clinical sessions since they felt it was interrupting its smooth

442

flow.

443

Limitations of Study

444

This study has several limitations in that the participants were purposefully selected from one

445

public institution providing clinical training for medical students from three higher education

446

institutions. Thus the findings may not be entirely generalizable. Second the number of

447

participants was small and the study only focused on experiences and perspectives from

448

administrators. Future studies could investigate student and faculty member experiences and

449

perspectives from both public and private institutions. The experiences of student and faculty

450

member could be compared with that of administrators’ to determine if there were any

451

similarities and differences. These findings could also aid institutions offering clinical

452

medical education in Sub-Saharan Africa as to what will work best in Africa’s peculiar

453

environment.

454

Conclusion

455

This paper has examined innovative ways adopted by a public higher education institution in

456

Ghana offering clinical medical education to three higher education institutions during the

457

COVID-19 pandemic using a blended format. A number of innovations had to be

458

implemented to ensure student graduation. Though some of the implemented programmes

459

were not without challenges, the incorporation of technology greatly enhanced the training

460

process and aided in completion and graduation while taking cognizance of student

461

assessment, curriculum and administration among others. As students, faculty members and

462

administrators adapt during this pandemic, technology continues to be leveraged and novel

463

initiatives improved on while quality is not sacrificed. This paper has shown that COVID-19

464

has been disruptive to traditional medical education in Ghana. However, the innovative

465

learning processes may provide the opportunity to increase access to medical education

466

through the introduction of a phased system of learning. An alternative to foreign medical

467

training will also have to be evaluated if part of training can be undertaken in-country. The

468

findings from this study should have implications for policy and contribute to the discourse

469

on blended learning in medical education in Ghana while ensuring that excellence is

470

maintained in all instances. It is believed that the discussions in this paper may be of

471

significance to other medical institutions in the Sub-Saharan African region.
