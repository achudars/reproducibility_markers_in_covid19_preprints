The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic is causing a huge toll on

6

individuals, families, communities and societies across the world. Currently, whether

7

wearing facemasks in public should be a measure to prevent transmission of severe

8

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains contraversial.1 This

9

is largely because there have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for

10

coronavirus to directly support this. However, lessons may be taken from published

11

RCTs examining influenza-like illness (ILI).2,3 Recent studies suggested that

12

SARS-CoV-2 shares similar transmission route with influenza virus,4 and the

13

incidence of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with ILI is

14

high.5 Therefore, we undertook this meta-analysis of RCTs examining the efficacy of

15

wearing facemasks to prevent ILI in community settings, irrespective of confirmatory

16

testing for the causative virus.

17
18

We undertook a systematic literature search for RCTs related to facemasks and

19

ILI between 1966 and April 2020 using PUBMED, EMBASE, and Cochrane library.

20

RCTs undertaken in community (not hospital) settings comparing wearing and not

21

wearing facemasks for ILI were included. Incidence of ILI (e.g., fever, cough,

22

headache, sore throat, aches or pains in muscles or joints) was estimated per group.

23

Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated.

24
25

We screened 899 related abstracts and eventually included 8 RCTs (Figure S1).

26

Basic characteristics and quality of included RCTs are listed in Supplement.

27

Participants wearing facemasks had a significantly lower risk of developing ILI than

28

those not wearing facemasks (pooled RR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.70-0.95) and there was no

29

heterogeneity (Figure 1). The decreased risk of ILI was more pronounced if everyone

30

wore facemask irrespective of whether they were infected or not (RR=0.77, 95% CI:

31

0.65-0.91), compared to those wearing facemasks when infected (RR=0.95, 95% CI:

32

0.58-1.56) or uninfected (RR=1.26, 95% CI: 0.69-2.31).

33
34

This study shows that wearing facemasks, irrespective of infection status, is

35

effective in preventing ILI spread in the community. This situation mirrors what is

36

happening now in public settings where we do not know who has been infected and

37

who has not. Although there are no RCTs of facemasks for SARS-CoV-2, as with

38

other simple measures such as social distancing and handwashing, these data support

39

the recommendation to wear facemasks in public to further reduce transmission of

40

SARS-CoV-2 and flatten the curve of this pandemic, especially when social

41

distancing is impractical, such as shopping, or travelling with public transport for

42

work that cannot be done from home.
