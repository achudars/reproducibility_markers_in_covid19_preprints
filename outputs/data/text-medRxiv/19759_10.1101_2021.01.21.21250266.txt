Abstract
Background
Though SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have been documented in occupational settings and though there is
speculation that essential workers face heightened risks for COVID-19, occupational differences in excess
mortality have, to date, not been examined. Such information could point to opportunities for intervention,
such as workplace modifications and prioritization of vaccine distribution.

Methods and findings
Using death records from the California Department of Public Health, we estimated excess mortality among
Californians 18–65 years of age by occupational sector and occupation, with additional stratification of the
sector analysis by race/ethnicity. During the COVID-19 pandemic, working age adults experienced a 22%
increase in mortality compared to historical periods. Relative excess mortality was highest in
food/agriculture workers (39% increase), transportation/logistics workers (28% increase), facilities (27%) and
manufacturing workers (23% increase). Latino Californians experienced a 36% increase in mortality, with a
59% increase among Latino food/agriculture workers. Black Californians experienced a 28% increase in
mortality, with a 36% increase for Black retail workers. Asian Californians experienced an 18% increase, with
a 40% increase among Asian healthcare workers. Excess mortality among White working-age Californians
increased by 6%, with a 16% increase among White food/agriculture workers.

Conclusions
Certain occupational sectors have been associated with high excess mortality during the pandemic,
particularly among racial and ethnic groups also disproportionately affected by COVID-19. In-person
essential work is a likely venue of transmission of coronavirus infection and must be addressed through strict
enforcement of health orders in workplace settings and protection of in-person workers. Vaccine distribution
prioritizing in-person essential workers will be important for reducing excess COVID mortality.

Introduction
More deaths are occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic than predicted by historical trends [1-4]. In
California, per-capita excess mortality is relatively high among Blacks, Latinos, and individuals with low
educational attainment [4]. An explanation for these findings is that these populations face unique
occupational risks because they may disproportionately make up the state’s essential workforce and because

essential workers often cannot work from home [4-6]. Additionally, due to historical structural inequities,
low-wage essential workers may be more likely to live in crowded housing [5-7], resulting in household
transmission.
Despite the inherent risks that essential workers face, no study to date has examined differences in excess
mortality across occupation. Such information could point to opportunities for intervention, such as
workplace modifications and prioritization of vaccine distribution. Using time-series models to forecast
deaths from March through October 2020, we compare excess deaths among California residents 18–65 years
of age across occupational sectors and occupations, with additional stratification of the sector analysis by
race/ethnicity.

Methods
We obtained data from the California Department of Public Health on all deaths occurring on or after
January 1, 2016.
To focus on individuals whose deaths were most plausibly linked to work, we restricted our analysis to
decedents 18–65 years of age. Death certificates include an open text field for “Decedent’s usual occupation,”
described as “type of work done during most of working life.” Retirement is not separately recorded. We
processed the occupation information listed on the death certificates using an automated system developed
by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which converts free-text occupational data to
2010 US Census codes. A team of 3 researchers manually categorized the resulting 529 unique codes into
occupational sectors, with a focus on the 13 sectors identified by Cailfornia officials as comprising the state’s
essential workforce[8] and retail workers; we anticipated that these sectors would be most at risk. To ease
presentation, we combined or eliminated some sectors, placing the defense, communications/IT, and financial
sectors in the not-essential category (under the logic that it was particularly difficult to ascertain which
workers in these sectors fully met the state’s definitions for essential work) and placing chemical, energy, and
water sectors in the facilities category. This resulted in the following 9 groups: facilities, food/agriculture,
government/community, health/emergency, manufacturing, retail, transportation/logistics, not essential, and
unemployed/missing. We defined 4 racial/ethnic groups: Asian, Black, Latino, and White, with the
definition of Latino overwriting any racial designation in the death records. Our definition of Asian, Black,
and White excludes individuals identified on the death certificate as multiracial.
We defined pandemic time as beginning on March 1, 2020. In some time-stratified analysis, we compared the
months of March through May to the months of June and July. We chose the cutoff of June 1 because it is

roughly 3 weeks after the state’s post-shutdown reopening in early May, and because we anticipate lags
between policy, infection, and death. Similarly, the ending date of July 31 is roughly 3 weeks after the state
ordered restaurants and indoor businesses to close in early July.
We conducted time-series analysis for each occupational sector, with additional stratification by
race/ethnicity. For each group of interest (for example, each occupational sector of interest), we repeated the
following procedure. We aggregated the data to months or weeks, using the weekly analysis for visualizations
and the monthly analysis to derive summary measures. Following our previous work [4], we fit dynamic
harmonic regression models with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) errors for the number
of monthly/weekly all-cause deaths, using deaths occurring among the group prior to March 1, 2020. For
each iteration, we used a model-fitting procedure described by Hyndman and Khandakar [9]. Using the final
model, we forecast the number of deaths for each unit of time, along with corresponding 95% prediction
intervals (PI). To obtain the total number of excess deaths for the entire time window, we subtracted the
total number of expected (forecast) deaths from the total number of observed deaths. We obtained a 95% PI
for the total by simulating the model 10,000 times, selecting the 97.5% and 2.5% quantiles, and subtracting
the total number of observed deaths. We report in our tables the observed number of deaths divided by the
expected number of deaths, as predicted by our models. We interpret these ratios as risk ratios for mortality,
comparing pandemic time to non-pandemic time. We also estimated excess mortality for all specific
occupations; for individual occupations, we defined excess mortality and risk ratios by comparing 2020
deaths to the arithmetic mean of 2018 and 2019 deaths.
We conducted all analyses in R, version 4.04.

Results
We estimate that from March 2020 through October 2020, there were 10,047 (95% PI: 9,229–10,879) excess
deaths among Californians 18–65 years of age (Table 1). Relatively large numbers of excess deaths were
recorded among workers in the facilities sector (1,681; 95% PI: 1,447–1,919) and the transportation/logistics
sector (1,542; 95% PI: 1,350–1,738). Relative to pre-pandemic time, mortality increased during the pandemic
by 39% among food/agriculture workers (risk ratio RR=1.39; 95% PI: 1.32–1.48), 28% among
transportation/logistics workers (RR=1.28; 95% PI: 1.24–1.33), 27% among facilities workers (RR=1.27; 95%
PI: 1.22–1.32), and 23% (RR=1.23; 95% PI: 1.18–1.28) among manufacturing workers.

Risk ratios are defined as the observed number of deaths divided by the
expected number of deaths. They are interpretable as the risk ratio for
mortality, comparing pandemic time to non-pandemic time.

Relative increases in mortality varied over time (Fig 1) and by occupational sector (Fig 2). In March through
May, there was a 14% increase in mortality among all working-age Californians (RR=1.14; 95% PI:
1.09–1.20) compared to a 31% increase among workers in the food/agriculture (RR=1.31; 95% PI: 1.17–1.49).
In the months of June and July, the RR were particularly high in the food/agriculture (RR=1.61; 95% PI:
1.44–1.83), transportation/logistics (RR=1.52; 95% PI: 1.38–1.69), manufacturing (RR=1.52; 95% PI:

RR also varied by race/ethnicity (Table 2). Latino Californians experienced a 36% increase in mortality
during the pandemic (RR=1.36; 95% PI: 1.29–1.44), with a 59% increase among Latino food/agriculture
workers (RR=1.59; 95% PI: 1.47–1.75). Black Californians experienced a 28% increase in mortality

Discussion
Our analysis of deaths among Californians between the ages of 18 and 65 shows that the pandemic’s effects
on mortality have been greatest among essential workers, particularly those in the food/agriculture,
transportation/logistics, facilities, and manufacturing sectors. Such workers experienced an increased risk of
mortality of greater than 20% during the pandemic, with an increased risk of greater than 40% during the
first two full months of the state’s reopening. Excess mortality in high-risk occupational sectors was evident
in analyses stratified by race/ethnicity, especially for Latino, Black, and Asian workers.
Our findings are consistent with a small but growing body of literature demonstrating occupational risks for
SARS-CoV-2 infection. For example, a study of the UK Biobank cohort found that essential workers,
particularly healthcare workers, had high risks for COVID-19 [10]. Similarly, numerous studies have
documented SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers [11]. Our study, however, is unique in
examining excess mortality and multiple occupational sectors. Though our work is in agreement with prior
studies in finding pandemic-related risks among healthcare workers [11], it suggests that the risks are even
higher in other sectors, such as food/agriculture and transportation/logistics.
This study is also among the first to examine deaths by both occupation and race/ethnicity. Occupational
exposures have been postulated as an important contributor for disparities in excess mortality by race
ethnicity, particularly because certain occupations require in-person work [4]. Though we tended to find the
largest relative increases in mortality in each racial/ethnic group in the food/agriculture and
transportation/logistics sectors, there was variation across race/ethnicity. For example, among Asians, the
largest RR was in the health/emergency sector, even though the relative risk increases in that sector were
relatively low among other racial/ethnic groups. Such differences may reflect cross-sector differences in
demographics. There are, for example, a large number of Latinos who work in meat-processing facilities [12],
consistent with data that show that Latinos make up a large proportion of COVID-19 cases in such settings
[13]. Similarly, the large RR among Asians in the health/emergency sector could be due to the relatively
large number of Filipino Americans in nursing professions [14]. During the pandemic in particular, such
disproportionate representation may easily lead to cross-race variability in risk. A recent study found, for
example, that Black workers are more likely to be employed in occupations that frequently require close
proximity to others [15]. Inequalities in risk may be exacerbated by underlying structural inequities, such as
immigration status or poverty [16].
Though non-occupational risk factors may be relevant, it is clear that eliminating COVID-19 will require
addressing occupational risks. In-person essential workers are unique in that they are not protected by

shelter-in-place policies. Indeed, our study shows that excess mortality rose sharply in the food/agriculture
sector during the state’s first shelter-in-place period, from late March through May; these increases were not
seen among those working in non-essential sectors. Complementary policies are necessary to protect those
who cannot work from home. These can and should include: free personal protective equipment, clearly
defined and strongly enforced safety protocols, easily accessible testing, generous sick policies, and
appropriate responses to workplace safety violations. As jurisdictions struggle with difficult decisions
regarding vaccine distribution, our findings offer a clear point of clarity: vaccination programs prioritizing
workers in sectors such as food/agriculture are likely to have disproportionately large benefits for reducing
COVID-19 mortality.
We acknowledge limitations to the study, including misclassification of occupation in death certificates due to
coarse categories or inaccurate reports. The decedent’s primary occupation is typically reported by the next
of kin who may not be able to precisely describe the work. The primary occupation, which is reported on the
death certificate, may not match the most recent occupation, which is more likely to drive occupational risk.
These limitations would in general attenuate apparent differences across occupational sectors but are unlikely
to account for our primary results.
Our study places a powerful lens on the unjust impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality of working
age adults in different occupations. Our analysis is among the first to identify non-healthcare in-person
essential work, such as food and agriculture, as a predictor of pandemic-related mortality. Essential
workers—especially those in the food/agriculture, transportation/logistics, facilities, and manufacturing
sectors—face increased risks for pandemic-related mortality. Shutdown policies by definition do not protect
essential workers and must be complemented with workplace modifications and prioritized vaccine
distribution. If indeed these workers are essential, we must be swift and decisive in enacting measures that
will treat their lives as such.
