Abstract

26

Introduction: Vaccines against COVID-19 have been developed in unprecedented time.

27

However, the effectiveness of any vaccine is dictated by the proportion of the population

28

willing to be vaccinated. In this observational population-based study we examined intentions

29

to be vaccinated against COVID-19 over the course of the pandemic.

30

Methods: We analyzed longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of 7,547

31

US adults enrolled in the Understanding America Study (UAS). Participants reporting being

32

willing, undecided and unwilling to get vaccinated against coronavirus across 13 assessments

33

conducted from April-October, 2020. Public attitudes to vaccination against the coronavirus

34

were also assessed.

35

Results: Willingness to vaccinate declined from 71% in April to 53.6% in October. This was

36

explained by an increase in the percentage of participants undecided about vaccinating (from

37

10.5% to 14.4%) and the portion of the sample unwilling to vaccinate (from 18.5% to 32%).

38

The population subgroups most likely to be undecided/unwilling to vaccinate were those

39

without a degree (undecided: RRR=2.47, 95% CI: 2.04-3.00; unwilling: RRR=1.92, 95% CI:

40

1.67-2.20), Black participants (undecided: RRR=2.18, 95% CI: 1.73-2.74; unwilling:

41

RRR=1.98, 95% CI: 1.63-2.42), and females (undecided: RRR=1.41, 95% CI: 1.20-1.65;

42

unwilling: RRR=1.29, 95% CI: 1.14-1.46). Those aged 65+, those on high incomes, and other

43

race/ethnicity participants were least likely to be undecided or unwilling to vaccinate.

44

Concerns about potential side effects of a vaccine were common.

45

Conclusions: Intentions to be vaccinated against coronavirus have declined rapidly during

46

the pandemic and close to half of Americans are undecided or unwilling to be vaccinated.

INTRODUCTION

70

As of November, 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic has been responsible for more than 1.3

71

million deaths worldwide1. Potential vaccines against COVID-19 have been developed in

72

unprecedented time and early findings suggest there are multiple candidate vaccines that may

73

protect against infection and be suitable for mass roll out in the near future2,3. However, the

74

overall effectiveness of any vaccine is dictated, at least in part, by the proportion of the

75

population willing to be vaccinated.. Simulation studies suggest at least three quarters of the

76

population may need to be vaccinated to extinguish the ongoing coronavirus pandemic4,5.

77
78

During the early stages of the pandemic (March-June), studies of small samples of European

79

and Australian adults suggested that the majority of people surveyed reported that they would

80

be vaccinated when a widely available vaccine was available6-7. Similarly, a nationally

81

representative study of adults in China conducted in March found that 9 out of 10 would

82

accept a vaccine when available8. US studies conducted early in the pandemic found that

83

between 58% and 86% of adults reported they were likely to be vaccinated against COVID-

84

196,9-11.

85
86

However, the rise of ‘fake news’ during the pandemic has been widely acknowledged11,12 and

87

widespread misinformation about the pandemic may have been damaging to public uptake of

88

measures designed to reduce the spread of the virus (e.g. mask-wearing, social distancing)

89

and willingness to vaccinate10,13,14. In addition, because the speed at which coronavirus

90

vaccines have been developed has been unprecedented and this has been widely reported2,3,

91

this may have made the general public more hesitant about accepting a vaccine when

92

available15,16. Furthermore, research indicates that in some countries public trust in

93

government handling of the COVID-19 crisis has been negatively affected17 and this too may

94

have detrimentally affected intentions to follow public health guidance.

95
96

COVID-19 has had a disproportionately large impact on ethnic minorities18 and groups from

97

lower socioeconomic backgrounds19 and as infections will likely continue to be socially

98

patterned, understanding whether population demographics determine willingness to

99

vaccinate will also be important. For example, research examining previous influenza

100

vaccination programmes has found that vaccination intentions and uptake are reduced among

101

more disadvantaged groups20,21. Initial research examining coronavirus vaccination intentions

102

has produced mixed findings on the role of demographic predictors, which may be due to a

103

reliance to date on relatively small and non-representative samples to examine population

104

subgroup differences9,10,22.

105
106

At present, there is a lack of up-to-date estimates of the proportion of the general population

107

that would be willing to use a vaccine when available and it is unclear whether estimates of

108

vaccination uptake collected much earlier in the pandemic have changed over time. It will be

109

also important to understand whether intentions to vaccinate are socially patterned and more

110

or less likely in specific population sub-groups, in order for public health messages to be

111

directed at those who are least likely to vaccinate15,16. In the present research we therefore

112

made use of data from the Understanding America Study (UAS), a large nationally

113

representative panel of US adults who have reported their vaccine intentions on thirteen

114

occasions from the outbreak of the pandemic through to October, 2020.

METHODS

119

Study design and participants

120

This study utilized data collected as part of the Understanding America Study (UAS), a

121

nationally representative longitudinal study of adults aged 18 and over. The UAS is a

122

probability-based sample recruited via address-based sampling from the US Postal Service

123

Computerized Delivery Sequence file containing all US postal addresses23. Participants

124

complete surveys online and those without internet access are provided with tablet computers

125

and internet access. Of 8547 UAS participants eligible to take part in the COVID-19 tracking

126

study, 7547 participated and provided data across 13 waves of assessment conducted every

127

two weeks between April 1st and October 31st, 202024.

128
129

In total, participants provided 80,060 observations across the 13 survey waves (average

130

response rate of 81.6% among COVID tracking study participants). A small portion (2%) of

131

observations were omitted because they were submitted after October 31st or were missing

132

vaccination intentions or covariate data leaving a total of 78,453 observations (10.4 per

133

participant). The UAS weights were applied to adjust for unequal probabilities of selection

134

into the UAS. Post-stratification weights were also incorporated to provide a correction for

135

non-response by aligning each survey wave with the distribution of demographic

136

characteristics of the US population25.

137
138

Measures

139

In each survey wave participants indicated how likely there were to get vaccinated for

140

coronavirus when a vaccine becomes available to the public on a five-point scale. Participants

141

were classified as either: (1) Undecided (responses of ‘unsure’), (2) Unwilling to vaccinate

142

(responses of somewhat or very unlikely to vaccinate), or (3) Willing to vaccinate (responses

143

of somewhat or very likely to vaccinate).

144
145

Vaccination intentions were predicted by month of survey (April, May, June, July, August,

146

September, October) and a set of demographic variables: age (coded as 18-34, 35-44, 50-64,

147

65+), sex (coded as male, female), race/ethnicity (White, Hispanic, Black, Other

148

race/ethnicity), household income (≤$40,00/$40,000–$100,000/ ≥$100,000 gross per annum),

149

college degree (vs. none), and the presence of a chronic health condition (present vs. not

150

present). Specifically, participants indicated whether they had been diagnosed with the

151

following conditions: diabetes, cancer, heart disease, kidney disease, asthma, chronic lung

152

disease, an autoimmune disease.

153
154

Participants also reported their level of agreement (from 1 = strongly disagree, to 4 = strongly

155

agree) with nine items assessing their attitudes towards a potential vaccine (see Table 3 for

156

items in full) in late October (14th-31st). Questions assessed participant beliefs that the

157

COVID vaccine would be beneficial, important for personal and community health, and a

158

good way to protect from coronavirus disease. Participants also indicated whether they

159

agreed approved vaccines would be effective and whether they were concerned about the lack

160

of long-term follow-up information and potential side effect of a COVID vaccine were

161

assessed (e.g. “I think the COVID-19 vaccine might cause lasting health problems for me.”).

162
163

Statistical analysis

164

First, we examined trends in vaccinate intentions over the period of the study by comparing

165

the prevalence of willingness/undecided/unwillingness to vaccinate in April and October,

166

2020. To estimate the statistical significance of time trends we used multinomial logistic

167

regression analysis with robust standard errors clustered at the individual-level. Those

168

willing to vaccinate were compared to: (i) those undecided on vaccination, and (ii) those

169

unwilling to vaccinate. A series of multinomial logistic regressions were run to identify if the

170

relative risk of being undecided or unwilling to vaccinate increased from April to October for

171

the overall sample and each population subgroup examined. This model contrasts the natural

172

log [Pr(Willing to vaccinate)/Pr(Unwilling to vaccinate)] and natural log [Pr(Undecided on

173

vaccination)/Pr(Unwilling to vaccinate)] estimates across different demographic groups to

174

ascertain relative risk ratios (RRR).

175
176

Next, multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the extent to which survey month

177

and different demographic factors predicted vaccination intentions. A single adjusted analysis

178

was used to estimate the independent effect of each predictor variable (i.e. month of survey,

179

age, sex, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, income, presence of a chronic condition)

180

controlling for all others. In addition, we tested a separate model where interactions between

181

survey month and participant demographics were added to our main model to test whether

182

changes in vaccination intentions over time differed systematically between demographic

183

groups.

184
185

All analyses incorporated the UAS sampling weights to generate nationally representative

186

estimates. RRRs and 95% CIs were estimated using the Stata version 15 (Statacorp).

RESULTS

192

Participants were aged 47.2 (SD = 16.6) years on average, 52.1% were female, 34.2% had a

193

college degree, and 64.1% were White, 17.8% Hispanic, 12.2% Black, and 5.9% Other

194

race/ethnicity (see Table 1). On average, willingness to vaccinate declined from 71% in April

195

to 53.6% in October. This was explained by an increase in the percentage of participants

196

undecided about vaccinating against COVID-19 (from 10.5% to 14.4%) and the portion of

197

the sample unwilling to vaccinate (from 18.5% to 32%), as shown in Table 1. A decrease in

198

the willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 between April and October was evident

199

across all population subgroups examined (Table 1).

200
201

An unadjusted multinomial logistic regression analysis confirmed that from April to October,

202

2020 there was a statistically significant higher risk of being undecided (RRR = 1.82, 95%

203

CI: 1.62-2.05) or unwilling (RRR = 2.29, 95% CI: 2.11-2.48) to be vaccinated versus being

204

willing to get vaccinated (see Table S1). Unadjusted multinomial logistic regression analyses

205

also showed that all population subgroups were more likely to be undecided or unwilling to

206

vaccinate in October compared to April (Table S1). There was also an over 2-fold higher

207

relative likelihood of being undecided or unwilling to get the COVID-19 vaccine in October

208

compared to April, 2020 (undecided: RRR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.79-2.29; unwilling: RRR =

209

2.47, 95% CI: 2.27-2.68) in a fully adjusted model that included controls for participant

210

demographic factors and the presence of chronic illness (Table 2). An examination of month-

211

to-month changes confirmed that the likelihood of being undecided or unwilling to vaccinate

212

(versus being willing to vaccinate) increased in a graded fashion from April to October, as

213

shown in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 1.

215

When all observations from 13 survey waves were examined, those without a college degree

216

were at elevated relative risk of being undecided or unwilling to vaccinate (undecided: RRR

217

= 2.47, 95% CI: 2.04-3.00; unwilling: RRR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.67-2.20), as were Black

218

participants (undecided: RRR = 2.18, 95% CI: 1.73-2.74; unwilling: RRR = 1.98, 95% CI:

219

1.63-2.42) and females (undecided: RRR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.20-1.65; unwilling: RRR = 1.29,

220

95% CI: 1.14-1.46). In contrast, a reduced relative risk of being undecided or unwilling to

221

vaccinate was found among those aged 65+ (undecided: RRR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.38-0.63

222

unwilling: RRR=0.61, 95% CI: 0.51-0.74), those on high household incomes (undecided:

223

RRR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.32-0.50; unwilling: RRR=0.52, 95% CI: 0.39-0.71), and other

224

race/ethnicity participants (undecided: RRR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.40-0.82; unwilling:

225

RRR=0.52, 95% CI: 0.39-0.71).

226
227

An examination of the interactions between survey month and individual demographic

228

characteristics did not yield evidence for systematic differences in changes in vaccination

229

intentions over time between demographic groups.

230
231

Finally, we examined attitudes towards the vaccine reported between October 14-31, 2020.

232

The majority of the sample (70-80%) agreed that the COVID vaccine would be personally

233

beneficial, important for personal and community health, a good way to protect from

234

coronavirus disease, and effective if approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration

235

(FDA) or the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; see Table 3). However,

236

responses differed markedly between those willing and unwilling to be vaccinated. For

237

example, while 92% of those who were willing to be vaccinated agreed that the vaccine

238

would be effective if approved by the FDA or CDC, only 43% of those unwilling to be

239

vaccinated agreed. In the overall sample it was common for participants to report concerns

240

over the vaccine and 69.7% agreed they were concerned about serious side effects of the

241

vaccine. Forty-four % agreed the vaccine might cause lasting health problems for them.

242

However, such concerns were more prevalent among those unwilling to be vaccinated. For

243

example, 65% of this group were concerned about lasting health problems resulting from the

244

vaccine compared to 27% of those willing to be vaccinated.

245
246

DISCUSSION

247

In a large nationally representative sample of US adults, intentions to be vaccinated against

248

COVID-19 have declined from a high of 71% of the population in April to close to only 54%

249

reporting being willing to vaccinate in October, 2020. Reporting being undecided or

250

unwilling to vaccinate was more likely among those with lower levels of education and

251

income, females, Black (African American) and younger adults. Concerns about the vaccine

252

causing long lasting health problems and uncertainty about the benefits of the vaccine were

253

also common.

254
255

Based on estimates that vaccination coverage of close to 75% may be required to vaccinate to

256

eradicate coronavirus4,5,10,26, our estimates that close to 50% of the population may be willing

257

to vaccinate are concerning. It will now be critical to better understand the reasons why a

258

large proportion of the population are sceptical about vaccination against COVID-19. Public

259

concerns about the safety of vaccines may be an important driver of the increase in the

260

proportion of the population reporting being unsure or explicitly stating they will not

261

vaccinate10.

262

In line with this, 70% of the present sample reported being concerned about serious side

263

effects of the vaccine and 44% believed that a vaccine might cause lasting health problems

264

for them. To some extent these concerns are to be expected given the unprecedented speed at

265

which vaccines have been developed2,3 and current lack of information on long-term safety of

266

candidate vaccines. However, the rise of anti-vaccination misinformation (e.g. misleading

267

healthcare information, conspiracy theories) may also have played a role in explaining this

268

increase11-14,26. It will therefore be critical that accurate safety information is widely and

269

transparently communicated by trusted sources to promote confidence in the scientific

270

decision-making underpinning the approval of COVID-19 vaccines16,21.

271
272

It will also be important to address social inequalities in vaccination intentions20,21, and to

273

ensure widespread uptake of effective COVID-19 vaccines. In the present study, willingness

274

to vaccinate was strikingly lower among more disadvantaged groups (e.g. African Americans,

275

those with lower income and education levels) and these groups have already been

276

disproportionately affected by COVID-1918,19. Previous research on influenza vaccines also

277

suggests that access issues may prevent minority and disadvantaged groups from being

278

vaccinated21,27. It will therefore be important to identify strategies to reduce social

279

inequalities in both vaccination intentions and opportunities to vaccinate20.

280
281

Strengths of the present research include the use of a large probability-based nationally

282

representative sample of adults allowing generalizations to be made to the population. The

283

current study also moves beyond prior research by including a high frequency longitudinal

284

assessment of vaccination intentions throughout the pandemic. In addition, participant

285

concerns and perceptions of the benefits of a potential vaccine were assessed to shed light on

286

potential reasons for low willingness to vaccinate.

287

Limitations are our reliance on self-reported intentions and the lack of detailed assessment of

288

factors that may explain why vaccination intentions have declined over time in the US.

289

However, in advance of the deployment of a COVID vaccine it is necessary to rely on

290

intention-based measures which have been shown to predict vaccination behavior27. Further,

291

intentions are malleable and represent a target for evidence-based approaches aiming to

292

increase the proportion of the population that are willing to vaccinate28. This now represents

293

an urgent public health priority to minimize further loss of life due to the COVID-19

294

pandemic29. Finally, studies tracking vaccination attitudes including perceived health benefits

295

and side-effects of vaccination, long-term health concerns, and the role of misinformation are

296

now needed to provide an in-depth understanding of the drivers of changes in vaccine

297

CONCLUSION

300

Intentions to be vaccinated against coronavirus have declined rapidly during the pandemic

301

and close to half of Americans are undecided or unwilling to be vaccinated. This reduced

302

willingness to vaccinate may undermine the pandemic response and the public health benefits

303

of an effective vaccine.

Note: Estimates are based on weighted data. aBased-on responses to the question “How likely are you to get vaccinated for coronavirus once a
vaccine is available to the public?”. In this survey wave (responses between October 14-31, 2020) 54% of the sample were classified as
‘Willing to vaccinate’, 14% ‘Undecided’, and 32% ‘Unwilling to vaccinate’. b Each item was rated on a four-point scale with those responding
‘Somewhat’ or ‘Strongly’ agree are coded as ‘Agree’ and those responding ‘Somewhat’ or ‘Strongly’ disagree are coded as ‘Disagree’.
