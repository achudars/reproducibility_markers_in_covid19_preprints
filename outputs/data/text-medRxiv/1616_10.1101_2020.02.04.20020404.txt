Abstract
The many respiratory viruses that cause influenza-like illness (ILI) are reported
and tracked as one entity, defined by the CDC as a group of symptoms that include a fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit and a cough and/or a sore throat. In the
United States alone, ILI impacts 9-49 million people every year. While tracking
ILI as a single clinical syndrome is informative in many respects, the underlying
viruses differ in their parameters and outbreak properties. Most existing models
treat either a single respiratory virus or ILI as a whole. However, there is a need
for models capable of comparing several individual ILI viruses. To address this
need, here we present a flexible model and simulations of epidemics for influenza,
RSV, rhinovirus, seasonal coronavirus, adenovirus, and SARS/MERS, parameterized by a systematic literature review and accompanied by a global sensitivity
analysis. We find that for these biological causes of ILI, their parameter values,
timing, prevalence, and proportional contributions differ substantially. These
results demonstrate that distinguishing the viruses that cause influenza-like illness will be an important aspect of future work on ILI diagnostics, mitigation,
modeling, and preparation for future unknown pandemics.

1. Introduction
Emerging infectious diseases are a major threat to global health security,
as exemplified by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The ease of transmissibility
makes respiratory pathogens especially suited for epidemic spread [1]. Viral res5

piratory infections account for a large burden of annual morbidity and mortality
worldwide [2] and are the cause more than 400,000 hospitalizations in children
less than 18 years old [3] in the United States every year, demonstrating the
perpetual scale of the challenge.
Most of these viral infections are categorized as Influenza-like Illnesses (ILI),

10

which are defined as cases of possible influenza, or other illnesses resulting
in a set of symptoms that are indistinguishable from those attributed to influenza viruses [4]. The CDC characterizes ILI as infections presenting with a
fever of 100◦ F, and a cough and/or a sore throat [5], although common symptoms attributed to ILI include fever, chills, malaise, dry cough, loss of appetite,

15

body aches, and nausea, combinations of which manifest depending on various
pathogen-specific, environment specific, and host-determined factors [6].
The number of people impacted by ILI in the USA and beyond is significant
every single year, notwithstanding the COVID pandemic. ILINet, which consists
of outpatient healthcare providers in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of

20

Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands, reports over 60 million patient visits
during the 2018-19 season [7, 8]. Indeed, 8% of the US population is considered
to be infected with symptomatic influenza-like illness every year [9].
Defining ILI as a syndromic cluster rather than a specific disease or diseases
is informative for keeping track of syndromic case counts, as well as for impor-

25

tant analysis and forecasting [10]. However, the cluster of symptoms known
as ILI is caused by many underlying pathogens [11, 12], most commonly, influenza viruses, common cold viruses, such as rhinovirus, adenovirus, human

respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) [13], and human coronaviruses (HCoV), a novel variant of
30

which is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic [14].
Despite the multifaceted biological etiology of ILI, diagnostic testing for
specific viruses underlying ILI is relatively rare [5], and many of the diagnostic
outcomes are based on syndromic evaluation at the point of care. There are
no tailored discriminatory diagnostics for use at the point of care, to evalu-

35

ate pathogens that impact 9-49 million people every year in the United States
alone [5]. This creates a knowledge gap in which an emergent novel respiratory
pathogen such as COVID-19 can go undetected [15]. An increased understanding of the biological dynamics of specific pathogens causing ILI is needed to
prevent unnecessary suffering and death [16, 17, 18].

40

Although clinical studies have been conducted to assess the contribution of
different viruses to ILI [19, 12, 20, 21, 22, 23], the reliance on syndromic diagnostics and the consequent impact on identification and of novel threats has not
been assessed until recently [24]. Modeling studies that explore the mechanism
of transmission and spread of ILI pathogens have also been conducted [25]. A

45

recent study has shown that aggregrating the underlying ILI viruses separately
rather than considering ILI as a single pathogen can improve ILI forecasts [24].
However, modeling studies using diagnostics measurements, and aimed at gaining insight into differing epidemic properties of the viruses underlying ILI, have
been less abundant [26, 27].

50

To address the need for a flexible, abstract system that enables comparison
of several ILI viruses in one paper, here we provide a deterministic model for five
of the most common viral pathogens responsible for ILI. Our aim is to explore
how pathogens with similar syndromes (and hence grouped together as ILI), can
present with varied outbreak properties, thereby requiring varied interventions.

55

We chose the pathogens on the basis of available literature, and the outcomes
of a parallel clinical study conducted in Northern New Mexico - Influenza (A
and B), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), rhinovirus, Human Coronavirus
(HCoV), and Adenovirus. We parameterized the model by conducting a sys3

the gap analysis performed in our clinical studies.
This study presents a shift in perspective that contributes a practical foundation for advancement of diagnostics, interventions and improved pandemic
preparedness of anticipated and novel ILI pathogens, and for developing modeling strategies that can support biosurveillance architectures and pandemic

To model five viruses that underly ILI during the course of one seasonal infection cycle, we developed a deterministic system of ordinary differential equations (Eq. 1). We then simulated daily infections of the five seasonal viruses
after subtracting probable coinfections, and calculated the proportion of total
daily infections contributed by each virus during the course of a hypothetical

75

ILI season.
The model diagram (Fig. 1) illustrates the progression of ILI for 365 days in
a human population of a hypothetical town containing 10,000 individuals. Five
common seasonal ILI viruses, along with the historic outbreak coronaviruses
SARS-CoV and MERS-Cov, are assumed to similar determininistic transmission

structure.
The total population (N) consists of seven classes: susceptible (S), exposed
but not infectious (E), first infectious class (I1 ), second (non-hospitalized) infectious class (I2 ), hospitalized (H), recovered (R), or deceased (D) (Table 1).
Individuals are considered susceptible until they contact an infectious individual

85

from (I1 ), (I2 ), or (H).

We modeled the progression of disease as follows: Given contact with an
infectious individual, transmission takes place with some probability. After
transmission has occurred, susceptible people move to the exposed class (E),
where they spend a number of days equal to the period between infection and
90

the onset of infectiousness (the latent period). In accordance with accepted
literature, we assume that the latent period equals the incubation period, which
is the period of time between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms.
After the latent period, individuals move to the first infectious class, (I1 ).
The duration of the first infectious period differs according to the underlying

95

virus. Symptoms worsen for some proportion of individuals in the first infectious
class, who then require hospitalization (H), where they remain infectious, with
reduced transmission c. From the hospital, individuals either recover (R) or
die (D). Individuals who remain sick, but do not require hospitalization for
the duration of the second infectious period (I2 ), typically do not suffer from

100

serious manifestations of the disease, and we assume that they recover entirely.
We assume that hospitalized individuals have 25% less contact with susceptible
individuals than do infectious people outside the hospital, which results in 25%
less transmission during hospitalization. We further assume that all recovered
individuals (R) gain full immunity to the virus causing the illness.

105

We assume that the total infected population (T = E + I1 + I2 + H) and
the total infectious population (TI = I1 + I2 + H) are homogeneously mixed.
We assume that in the duration of a single year, demographics (natural birth
or death) are negligible, and they are not modeled. We assume that the viruses
act independently, although coinfection is not ruled out. Each epidemic begins

110

with a single infected individual, and we calculate the transmission rate β for
each virus is by solving for β in the expression for R0 in Appendix B, using the
mean R0 values for each virus from the literature.
2.2. Model Parameterization
To parameterize the model, we reviewed the literature for epidemiological

115

measurements of incubation period, infectious period, hospitalization period,

hospitalized proportion, case fatality proportion, and R0 (cf. Table 2) for influenza A and B, RSV, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and adenoviruses. We included results from experimental and observational studies, as well as from
systematic reviews. We also included estimates of R0 from modeling studies,
120

for even when symptomatically similar, many viral pathogens vary in their reproductive number. In the case of SARS, we included an estimate for the
infectious period, since values were lacking in the literature [28]. We searched
Google Scholar for each virus, using the name of the virus, a description of the
parameter, and the type of study. For example, “influenza AND incubation

125

period AND experimental” yielded a list of papers reporting the results of experimental studies to determine incubation period of influenza virus infections
in humans. We then read the top 10 cited papers, examined the details of each
study, and recorded the results (Table 3).
We iterated this process for each pathogen, until either no additional studies

130

could be found, or the information garnered had already been incorporated in
our assessment. We consulted modeling and review studies only when experimental and observational studies were not available for a given pathogen. We
obtained from two to nine values for each parameter, with the exceptions of
R0 for Adenoviruses, and the hospitalization period for SARS and MERS, for

135

which we found only one value each. We calculated the mean and standard
deviation of each parameter (Table 3).
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is a member of genus Betacoronavirus, along with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [29]. Our parameter review
includes values for strains 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-

140

CoV, the six commonly circulating strains of Coronaviruses that existed prior to
the advent of COVID-19. We generated a separate Coronavirus parameter table, focused on comparing the parameter values of the seasonal strains to those
of the more recent SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Table 4). We collected means
when possible; and when means were not available, we recorded medians.

2.3. Global Sensitivity Analysis
To prioritize the impact of parameters on model outputs for this nonlinear
system, we carried out a global sensitivity analysis. We bounded the parameter
space with the minimum and maximum parameters from the literature (Tables
3, 4, Appendix C.4). We simulated epidemics of five common upper respi-

150

ratory viruses implicated in ILI: influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),
Rhinovirus, seasonal human coronavirus (HCoV), and adenovirus, alongside
outbreak strains of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, grouped together.
We assessed the impact of five model input variables of β (basic transmission
rate), γ1 (1/incubation period), γ2 (1/onset to hospitalization), γ3 (1/hospital-

155

ized period), and γ4 (1/non-hospitalized period) on three response variables of
total number of infections, magnitude of epidemic peak (peak height), and time
to epidemic peak. We used Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) [30] to generate
10,000 sets of values from the total parameter space for each of the five parameters, for each of the viruses. We considered the parameter ranges for seasonal

160

coronaviruses (HCoV) separately from SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV. We calculated
β ranges by solving Equation B.4 for β and substituting the minimum and
maximum values from the literature (Table D.5). In the case of adenovirus, we
found only one R0 value in the literature, and assumed minimum and maximum
values of −20% and +20% from this single value. We solved the ODE system

165

numerically for these sample input values using the default integration routine
“ode” in R package deSolve, then constructed a dataframe of the marginal relations between the individual parameters and outputs. We generated sensitivity
plots in R using Smoothed Conditional Means (“statsmooth”) and trend lines
using weighted least squares method Local Polynomial Regression Fitting in R

170

(“loess”) [31]. We assumed a uniform distribution on the parameters.

daily infections for five seasonal ILI viruses for one hypothetical year. The x-axis shows time
in days; the y-axis shows number of infections. Each virus begins by infecting one individual,
with 9,999 susceptible individuals. We assume no background immunity, vaccination, or
mitigations; each virus acts independently; probable coinfections are subtracted. Inputted
parameter values are the means from the literature (Table 3). Values for coronavirus are the
means for the pre-SARS-CoV-2, endemic, seasonal coronaviruses OC43, 229E, HKU1, and
NL63, considered as a group. Panel 2B displays six snapshots of the proportion contributed
by each virus on the first day of each month of the hypothetical ”flu” season. The x-axis

We find that when we numerically simulate seasonal epidemics for five common ILI viruses, setting all of their starting times at October 1st, the varied
175

ranges of historic parameter values for each virus result in varied timing, prevalence, and contributions of these underlying biological causes of ILI (Figure 2).
RSV peaks in December, followed by rhinovirus. Seasonal coronavirus peaks in
January, adenovirus peaks in February, and influenza peaks in March. RSV has
the greatest total cumulative infections and the highest peak (greatest maxi-

180

mum daily number of infections), while influenza has the least total cumulative
infections and the lowest peak. The numerical simulation of SARS and MERS,
not illustrated here as an epidemic curve because not considered seasonal, has
the greatest overall number of cumulative infections.
We find that on the first day of any given month during the simulated ILI

185

season, the composition of ILI attributable to the individual viruses varies considerably (see the stacked bar chart in (Figure 2)). On October 1st, each represents 20% of the total five infections, reflecting the initial condition that each
epidemic begins with one infection. On November 1st and December 1st respectively, RSV constitutes 55% and 56% of total ILI infections. On January 1st,

190

seasonal coronavirus contributes 50% of the total; on February 1st, adenovirus
contributes 54%; on March 1st, influenza contributes 73%.
3.2. Model Parameterization Results
We find 104 studies that contained relevant parameter values (Table 3). According to our literature review, adenovirus exhibits the longest mean incubation

195

period, seasonal coronavirus has the longest total mean infection period, and
RSV has the highest mean R0 . Notably, out of the viruses studied, RSV incubation period values have the least standard deviation, while adenovirus values
have the greatest standard deviation. Rhinovirus infectious period values have
the least standard deviation, while SARS/MERS has the greatest. And finally,

200

rhinovirus R0 values have the least variation, while RSV R0 values have the
greatest variation.

We find that the seasonal and historical outbreak coronaviruses differ considerably in their defining epidemiological parameters. The incubation and hospitalization periods of SARS and MERS are almost double that of their seasonal
205

counterparts, while their infectious period is more than double. The mean R0
for the betacoronaviruses SARS and MERS is 3.81, while that of the seasonal
coronavirus strains is 2.84 (Table 4).
Of the 104 studies, 10 provide values for the percentage of each of the five
viruses in question identified among ILI patients. In these 10 studies, on average,

210

at least one virus is identified in 62% of individuals with ILI symptoms. Out
of these 62% (mean values), influenza is identified in a 21.3% of samples, RSV
in 13.5% , rhinovirus in 22.6%, human coronavirus in 8.8%, and adenovirus in
8.1%. The presence or absence of co-infection is not taken into account in the
percentages reported by these studies.

3.3. Global Sensitivity Results
The global sensitivity analysis for our nonlinear system reveals several differences between the six viruses under consideration: influenza, RSV, rhinovirus,
seasonal coronavirus, adenovirus, and SARS/MERS.
The impact of the basic transmission rate β on total cumulative infections

220

is relatively tightly constrained for all six viruses (Appendix E). The trend line
for influenza is slightly sigmoid, while the trend lines appear exponential for the
other five, approaching 100% of the population asymptotically near their mean
β values. For influenza and RSV, the Latin Hypercube Samples (LHS) for all
five input variables have bimodal distributions for cumulative cases and time to

225

peak. That is, for influenza and RSV, but not for the other four viruses, there
are trivial numerical solutions for the system in which epidemics never take off,
as well as nontrivial solutions, where they do take off. This is reflected in the
disease-free equilibrium (Appendix A) and in the histograms (Appendix E).
The impact of β on peak height for the 10,000 LHS samples is not as con-

230

strained overall as for cumulative cases, although the variance is narrower than
that of the other four input variables. The LHS sample distributions for output
variable time to peak are bimodal for influenza and RSV, while they are unimodal for the other four viruses. Distributions for seasonal coronaviruses and
historic outbreak coronaviruses (SARS/MERS) are unimodal (Appendix E).

235

An important difference between the seasonal and outbreak coronaviruses
may be seen in Figure 3. Note that the y-axis for the outbreak coronaviruses
represents approximately double the time period of the y-axis for seasonal coronaviruses. In both cases, the relationship of the transmission rate to the number
of days to the epidemic peak is logarithmic and well constrained. In both cases,

240

as the transmission rate increases, the time to peak shortens; conversely, as the
transmission rate decreases, the time to peak is delayed. The other four input
variables, representing speed of progression through the stages of disease, have
unremarkable impacts on the output variables.

4. Discussion
245

Although the five viruses considered here present clinically with similar
symptoms, their parameters and epidemic characteristics differ, illustrating the
vast potential not only for misdiagnosis and uninformed mitigation strategies,
but for missing early signals of future novel emerging diseases. These results
support those in Pei and Shaman’s recent paper [24] that demonstate differing

250

outbreak properties of individual viruses that contribute to ILI.
From our sensitivity analysis, it is apparent that virus transmission rates,
and therefore also effective reproduction numbers, have much greater impact on
the output variables than do the other four input variables, more biologically
intrinsic to each virus, that represent speed of the phases of disease progression.

255

From a mitigation perspective, the transmission rate is the variable we can
impact with public health policies. For example, by implementing mask-wearing
and physical distancing, we can reduce and delay epidemic peak(s) of outbreak
respiratory viruses, reducing cases and deaths as well as the burden on the
healthcare system.

260

Many of the studies that generated parameter values evaluated populations
treated at clinics or admitted at hospitals. However, a significant proportion of
illness and death may occur outside of hospitals and clinics (see Cohen et al.
2017). Our formula for R0 is based on the traditional assumption of a naive
population; however, our parameter review reports many values from clinical

265

studies conducted on populations that have been exposed to the seasonal ILI
viruses in circulation, and therefore have some level of background immunity.
Thus, these values likely reflect the effective reproductive number (Re ) rather
than R0 , with the exception of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which were novel
zoonoses when they appeared. Further, the studies reviewed herein have taken

270

place over many decades, during which viral evolution may be presumed to have
occurred.
In our simulations, we treat the viruses contributing to the clinical syndrome

of influenza-like illness as though they act independently, although a recent theoretical study has shown that even noninteracting pathogens are not necessarily
275

mathematically independent [131]. A recent clinical study has shown rhinovirus
can function to block subsequent infection by influenza [132]. Further studies
are needed to assess the potential for both within-host and between-host viral
interactions.
A limitation of our simulation results is that we have based them on mean

280

historic parameter values, which does not take into account seasonal impacts
on those parameters. Further, we have uniformly introduced the first infected
individual for all viruses on October 1st of our hypothetical ILI season; however,
in real world phenomena, these initial infections may happen at different times
in different populations, and could happen in varied orders in different years.

285

The flexible deterministic model, numerical simulations, and sensitivity analysis included herein set the stage for future studies to investigate potential interactions of individual viruses that contribute to ILI. The parameterization study
provides a meta-analysis of clinical studies during the past century that have
provided the basic epidemiological parameters for modeling five of the common

290

viruses contributing to the clinical syndrome of influenza-like illness. Along
with previous work, the results presented herein indicate that in order to improve diagnosis, mitigation, and modeling of respiratory viruses, as well as to be
prepared for the next pandemic, individual viruses contributing to influenza-like
illness should be considered separately.

Declaration of Competing Interest
The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests
or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work re310

ported in this paper.

Appendix A. Disease-free Equilibrium
In the disease-free state, all infected classes are zero, that is, E = I1 = I2 =
H = 0. Substituting and setting the derivatives equal to zero, it is evident
315

that in the disease-free state, the other state variables R and D will continue to
contain zero individuals, and that the Susceptible class S will remain equal to
the total population N.

If we set any one of E, I1 , I2 , or H to zero, the other three state vari320

ables representing infected classes must also be zero. In this case, N=S=10000.
Thus, where x = (S, E, I1 , I2 , H, R, D) denotes solutions of the system, xdf e =
(10000, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) represents the disease-free equilibrium for the system.

Appendix B. Derivation of Basic Reproductive Number
The basic reproductive number (R0 ) is defined as the average number of
325

secondary infections produced when one infected individual is introduced into
a fully susceptible population. Four compartments, latently infected individuals (E), symptomatic and infected individuals (I1 ), symptomatic and infected
and non-hospitalized individuals (I2 ), and hospitalized individuals (H), together
characterize the total infected population for the ILI virus system. To calculate

330

R0 for this system, we derive the next generation matrix [133].

1. Derive the matrix for the transmission term describing everyone entering (E):
the “F” matrix;

2. Derive the matrix for the transition terms describing everyone transitioning
between infected classes (E, I1 , I2 , H): the “V” matrix;
3. Next Generation Matrix (NGM) = (F )(V −1 );
4. The largest dominant eigenvalue or spectral radius of the NGM = R0 for the
system.
