Abstract
Background: During the current pandemic, a great effort is made to understand the COVID19 and find an effective treatment. As of 17 August 2020, there is no specific drug or biologic
agent which have been approved by the FDA for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19.
Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and radiological findings of 211 COVID19 in-patients that were treated between March - August 2020. Confirmation of a COVID-19
diagnosis was made according to a positive RT-PCR result with a consistent high-resolutionCT (HRCT) finding. Radiological images and the rate of clinical response of patients were
investigated.

Result: While 128 patients (58.7) did not develop pneumonia, the mild, moderate and severe
pneumonia ratios were 28(13.2%), 31(18.7%) and 27(22.9%). 72 patients (34.1%) whose
PCR tests were positive did not show any symptom and they were followed in isolation
without treatment. 52 patients (24.6%) received hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, 57
patients (27%) received favipiravir and 30 patients (14.2%) received favipiravir plus
dexamethasone as the first line of treatment. 63.1% of pneumonia patients who received
hydroxychloroquine plus azithyromycine, 28.3% of patients who received favipiravir and
10% of patients who received favipiravir plus dexamethasone showed a failure of treatment.
Conclusion: The pulmonary infiltrates of COVID-19 are not infective; therefore, the
characteristic of the disease should be described as COVID-19 pneumonitis instead of
pneumonia. The favipiravir plus dexamethasone seems to be the only drug combination to
achieve the improvement of radiological presentation and clinical symptoms in COVID-19
pneumonia patients.

Introduction
After the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in the Wuhan, China in late 2019
from a zoonotic source; the outbreak spread rapidly throughout the world. On March 11
2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic (1).
Although the majority of COVID-19 cases are either asymptomatic or mild, COVID-19 may
cause a respiratory compromise requiring hospitalization and supportive care in a significant
proportion of patients (2). As of August 17 2020, this pandemic caused the death of more than
772.000 people with a significant economical and sociological burden globally (3). Besides
its high infectivity rate, COVID-19 also has high morbidity and mortality due to autoimmune
destruction of the lungs stemming from the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (2).
It is known that; the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mainly
affects the respiratory tract and reaches the lungs, eventually causes the potentially fatal
pneumonia in severe cases (2). Since the studies investigating the pathophysiological
characteristic of this novel disease are still ongoing, the search for effective therapies requires
a comprehensive approach. As of 17 August 2020, there is no specific drug or biologic agent
which is approved by the FDA for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 (4). Numerous
other antiviral agents, immunotherapies, and vaccines continue to be investigated and used as
potential therapies in the clinical trials. Several guidelines and reviews of pharmacotherapy
for COVID-19 investigating the potential drugs have also been published (4,5). Existing
drugs with well-documented effects including hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, favipiravir
and dexamethasone are being used as a combination or alone to diminish the symptoms of
respiratorily compromised severe COVID-19 patients. (4,5).

To find an effective treatment, the most important point to be illuminated in patients with
COVID-19; is the question of whether lesions in the lung are infective or inflammatory in
nature. Therefore, in this retrospective study, we aimed to find the answer of the two
questions: “Is pulmonary infiltrate of COVID-19 infective or inflammatory in nature?” and
“Is Hydroxychloroquine plus Azithromycin or Favipiravir plus Dexamethasone more
effective in the COVID-19 treatment?”.

Material & Method
Study design
We retrospectively analyzed the radiological and clinical findings of COVID-19 in-patients
and out-patients that were treated in Samsun VM Medicalpark Hospital between March-

August 2020. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of SB (IRB No.
2020-07-21T10-25-53) and performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki.

Patient Selection
Patients who were suspected to be infected with COVID-19 were confirmed with laboratory
results and included in the study. Only laboratory-confirmed cases were included in the study.
A total of 211 patient has been included in the study. All the recovered patients were
discharged with 2 consecutive negative RNA detection (interval above 24 h) and clinical
improvement and followed for another 14 days after discharge.

Patient Grouping
Patients with pneumonia were divided into three groups by means of severity as mild,
moderate and severe depending on the total volume of radiologic infiltrations. Small and by
one by ground-glass opacities or consolidations were considered as mild pneumonia (Figure
1). Those with a total volume of diffuse ground-glass opacities or consolidations, smaller than
the volume of right upper lobe were considered as moderate pneumonia (Figure 2). Severe
pneumonia was defined as the total volume of diffuse ground-glass opacities bigger than the
volume of right upper lobe (Figure 3).

COVID-19 testing
Respiratory samples were obtained by nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs and analyzed by
reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Confirmation of a COVID19 diagnosis was made according to a positive RT-PCR result with a consistent highresolution-CT (HRCT) finding. Also, the patients whose multiple nasopharyngeal swab
samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 but the serological IgM/IgG antibody was positive in
the rapid antibody test included in the study.

Treatment Protocol
In the beginning, all patients were prescribed with oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate 400 mg
two times in the first day as the loading dose and, 200 mg two times per day for the following
four days. Azithromycin 500 mg was prescribed as the loading dose on the first day and 250
mg one time per day for the following four days. Favipiravir was loaded as 1600 mg two
times in the first day as the loading dose and 600 mg two times for the following four days as
the

maintenance

dose.

The

dose

of

the

systemic

steroid

(dexamethasone

or

methylprednisolone) was adjusted according to daily status of the patient. All the patients
who seem to recover by fibrosis were prescribed as long-term low dose oral steroid. The

treatment was considered as effective if clinical and radiological recovery was observed at the
end of the treatment.

Statistical Analysis
The quantitative data were described as the mean±standard deviation, or as the median
(min−max). The qualitative data were described by the number of cases (proportion, %).
All of the analysis was performed using SPSS Version 22.0.

Results
A total number of 211 patient was included in the study. The characteristics of the patients
were shown in Table 1. The nasopharyngeal swab PCR tests were positive in 97.2% of
patients and serological IgM/IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 was positive in 2.8% of
patients at the time of diagnosis. The mean age was 63.2 years old and male to female ratio
was 110/101. The number of pregnant, <18 years old and >65 years old patients were
7(3.3%), 23(10.9%), and 36(17%), respectively. 81 patients (38.3%) had pulmonary
infiltrates on HRCT. There was no pneumonia in pregnant patients and patients who were
<18 years old. 10 patients (4.7%) developed respiratory failure and 3 patients (30% in ICU
and 1.4% of total patients) died during the follow-up time.

The mild, moderate and severe pneumonia ratios were 28(13.2%), 31(18.7%) and 27(22.9%),
respectively as shown in Table II. The radiologic images of each group of patients were
shown in Figures 1,2 and 3.

The given drugs and treatment failure rates were shown in Table III. 72 patients (34.1%)
whose PCR tests were positive did not show any symptom. They did not receive any
treatment and were observed in the isolation for 14 days. 52 patients (24.6%) received
hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, 57 patients (27%) received favipiravir and 30 patients
(14.2%) received favipiravir plus dexamethasone in the first place. 63.1% of pneumonia
patients who received hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin showed a failure of treatment as
shown in Figure 4A-4B, 5A-5B, and 6A-6B. The patients that have treatment failure were
successfully re-treated with favipiravir plus dexamethasone and their radiological infiltrates
were shown in Figures 4C, 5C and 6C.

As of August 16 2020, there is no FDA-approved specific drug for COVID-19. However, an
array of the already-existing drug is approved for their other indications, and multiple
investigational agents are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19 in different
clinical trials around the globe (5-14). A large volume of data from randomized controlled
trials, observational cohorts, and case series are emerging at a very rapid pace; some in peerreviewed journals, others as pre-peer-review manuscripts, and, in some cases, in press
releases.

On March 9, Yao X. et al. reported that the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine sulfate was
effective in killing the SARS-CoV-2 in the laboratory settings (6). In March 2020, the US
FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to allow the emergency use of
hydroxychloroquine sulfate supplied from the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) for the
treatment of COVID-19 in certain hospitalized patients. Since then, many national agencies
have authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients (7)(8). On June 15
2020, however, the FDA revoked the EUA. Since then, contradictory conclusions have been
drawn by many researchers around the world regarding the efficiency of viral clearance and
clinical benefit with the regimen of hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (7-10). Recent
prospective and randomized trials found no evidence of a strong antiviral activity or clinical
benefit from the use of hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (8-10). Cavalcanti et al. even
reported that occurrence of any adverse event was more frequent in patients receiving
hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin (7). According to our results, although this
combination can be effective in the laboratory conditions, it was not effective on diminishing
pulmonary infiltrates of COVID-19 since 65.3% of patients treated with this combination
demonstrated a failure of treatment.

Favipiravir is a viral RNA polymerase inhibitor, which acts by its metabolite ribofuranosyl5′-triphosphate (RTP) that inhibits influenza virus RNA polymerase activity (11). Favipiravir
was urgently used and presented good inhibitory effects on the replication of Ebola virus in
2014. Favipiravir is also proven to protect mice from lethal infection with various types of
Influenza viruses (12). It is the first approved drug with the potential curative effect on
COVID-19 in China, which then played an important role in the prevention and control of
SARS-CoV-2 infection (13). Although there have been many registered clinical trials
focusing on antiviral drugs for COVID-19, how antivirals may contribute to control the
disease progression remains unclear. Q. Cai et al. reported that favipiravir causes an
improvement of chest imaging by inhibiting the replication of SARS-CoV-2 (13). They also
stated that the relationship between viral clearance and improvement in CT image together
helps improvement of the clinical picture of the patient. We observed that, for our patients,

favipiravir was the only drug to achieve clinical (especially in fever) and radiological
improvement in patients with COVID-19.

Glucocorticoids have been widely used in the syndromes closely related to COVID-19,
including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS), severe Influenza infections and community-acquired pneumonia. Commonly, in all
of those severe viral pneumonia cases, the host immune response plays a key role in
determining the pathophysiological effects of organ failure (2). The RECOVERY trial has
recently demonstrated that dexamethasone reduced the risk for death among seriously ill
COVID-19 patients by up to one third (2). However, the drug did not appear to help patients
with less serious presentations of COVID-19. The benefit was thought to occur in patients
who were being treated more than 7 days after symptoms onset, when inflammatory lung
damage likely to constitute the clinical picture (2). Guidelines issued by the U.K. chief
medical officers and by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States have
already been updated to recommend the use of glucocorticoids in severe patients hospitalized
with COVID-19 (2,4,5,14). In the presented case series, we showed that severe patients who
failed to respond to the hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin combination were successfully
treated with favipiravir plus dexamethasone, consistent with the idea of the existence of
inflammatory lung environment.

After early May, when the clinicians at our hospital have realized that hydroxychloroquine
was not as effective as favipiravir for the recovery of pneumonia patients, all the patients with
pneumonia were prescribed with favipiravir instead of hydroxychloroquine. However,
creating a randomized controlled group would not be ethical at the time of the pandemic,
therefore, we were not able to compare the effects of drug by the matched randomized group.
Instead, we tried to compare the before after results of two different patient populations
treated at different time intervals. In our perspective, it is important to distinguish COVID-19
patients who developed pneumonia and adjust a new treatment for them according to clinical
severity of each patient.

The most important point to be illuminated in patients with COVID 19 pneumonia; is the

are

or

inflammatory(pneumonitis). Radiology and pathology examinations of patients with COVID19 revealed inflammatory reactions in the lung that resembled what is observed in
hypersensitivity pneumonitis rather than in other viral pneumonia (15,16). Tian S et al.
reported histopathology data of COVID-19 pneumonia deriving from the accidental cases of
two patients who underwent lobectomies for lung cancer (16). Pathologic findings were

with

multinucleated giant cells, interstitial fibroblastic proliferation, and reactive hyperplasia of
pneumocytes. Since patients had no symptoms at the time of surgery, the authors conclude
that these features could represent an earlier phase of COVID-19 pneumonia. Instead, in the
advanced stages of the disease, the main pathological findings are diffuse alveolar damage
with lymphocytic infiltrate, small thrombotic vessels, and foci of alveolar hemorrhage (1618). Supportively, Polak et al. mentioned the three stages of COVID-19 being the viral
replication, inflammation with coagulopathy and fibrosis phases, all occur either
simultaneously or consecutively (19). Potus et al. also stated that endothelial dysfunction and
microthrombosis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is strikingly similar to what is seen
in pulmonary vascular diseases. They also stated that for this reason, patients with preexisting
pulmonary vascular disorders with altered endothelial cell metabolism are at great risk of
mortality (20). Thus, awareness regarding the precise nature of the immunological reaction on
the entire vasculature and the lung tissue in response to viral infection is essential to initiate
timely and targeted supportive therapy.
Supportively, we concluded that; SARS-CoV-2 first starts as an infection of the nasopharynx
and progresses as the inflammation of the lung parenchyma, depending on the degree of the
response that is shown by the host immunity. We also think that pulmonary radiological
findings that appear as opacities are also caused by the inflammatory reaction against the
virus. The response to the anti-inflammatory therapy that is proven by radiological and
clinical improvement, as well as published pathological data all support this finding.
However, one limitation of this study includes a lack of pathological investigation of patients
due to the inability to take a biopsy during clinical practice due to the circumstances during
the pandemic.
Segmental small pulmonary vessel enlargement on chest CT has been stated as a unique
feature associated with COVID-19, different from other viral or bacterial pneumonia findings
on chest CT (21). Lang et. al also stated that medium to small vessel dilatations are not
confined to areas of the diseased lung, and often involve subpleural distal vessels, suggesting
a diffuse vascular process (22). One theory behind those findings is the possibility of COVID19-induced secondary pulmonary vasculitis that is responsible for vascular changes and
abundance of pulmonary parenchymal ground-glass opacification (21, 22). The vascular
dilatations seen in ground glass-opacities of COVID-19 can be a good indication to
differentiate COVID-19 from other etiologies of ground-glass opacities, as seen in our cases
(Figure 7 and 8). Those vascular dilatations might indicate that COVID-19 starts as vasculitis

and progresses to the perivascular inflammation. It is not clear if it is an immune-complex
vasculitis or not, and further pathological examinations must be done to have a clear result.
This study has some limitations. Since this study was not designed to compare the two groups
at the same time but rather to compare the outcomes of two different groups of patients
treated at different times retrospectively, the study lacks the features of a randomized control
trial. Future studies with matched control groups and patients with other appropriate
pathologies, including bacterial or other types of viral pneumonia would be helpful to explain
the findings and clarify the extent of the vascular findings. Well-designed large randomized
clinical trials are also necessary to identify effective treatments based on a high level of
evidence. Further imaging and pathologic studies are also required to investigate the diffuse
pulmonary vascular dysregulations that are caused by unclear mechanisms.
In conclusion, we suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 causes an infectious disease that progresses
to inflammatory lung disease. The pulmonary infiltrates seem to be not infective; therefore,
the characteristic of the disease should be described as COVID-19 pneumonitis instead of
pneumonia. We concluded that, although the hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin can be
used effectively in the infected people without pneumonia, there is no clinical benefit from
the use of such a combination in infected patients who developed pneumonia. The favipiravir
plus dexamethasone seems to be the only drug combination to achieve the improvement of
radiological presentation and clinical symptoms in severe COVID-19 patients.

Figure 5B. Despite five days of treatment with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, the
fever and cough complaints of patient in Figure 5A did not resolve. Since the control CT on
the 7th day revealed an increase in the ground-glass infiltrates, treatment with favipiravir plus
dexamethasone was started.
Figure 5C. After five days of treatment with favipiravir plus dexamethasone, chest x-ray on
the 7th day revealed the regression of lesions and patient’s complaints (cough and fever) have
shown a significant improvement.
Figure 6A. A 32-year-old female patient presented with the complaints of cough, dyspnea
and fever. Her COVID-19 PCR test was positive. Due to the bilaterally nodular and ground
glass infiltrates that were seen at thorax HRCT, treatment with hydroxychloroquine plus
azithromycin was started.
