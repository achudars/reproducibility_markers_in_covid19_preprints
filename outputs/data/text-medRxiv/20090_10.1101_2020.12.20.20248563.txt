Abstract
Background: The Covid-19 pandemic has become a global public health crisis and providing optimal patient care while preventing a
collapse of the health care system is a principal objective worldwide. Objective: To develop and validate a prognostic model based on routine
hematological parameters to predict uncomplicated disease progression to support the decision for an earlier discharge. Design: Development
and reﬁnement of a multivariable logistic regression model with subsequent external validation. The time course of several hematological
variables until four days after admission were used as predictors. Variables were ﬁrst selected based on subject matter knowledge; their number
was further reduced using likelihood ratio-based backward elimination in random bootstrap samples. Setting: Model development based on
three Austrian hospitals, validation cohorts from two Austrian and one Swedish hospital. Participants: Model development based on 363
survivors and 78 non-survivors of Covid-19 hospitalized in Austria. External validation based on 492 survivors and 61 non-survivors
hospitalized in Austria and Sweden. Outcome: In-hospital death. Main Results: The ﬁnal model includes age, fever upon admission,
parameters derived from C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration, platelet count and creatinine concentration, approximating their baseline
values (CRP, creatinine) and change over time (CRP, platelet count). In Austrian validation cohorts both discrimination and calibration of this
model were good, with c indices of 0.93 (95% CI 0.90 - 0.96) in a cohort from Vienna and 0.93 (0.88 - 0.98) in one from Linz. The model
performance seems independent of how long symptoms persisted before admission. In a small Swedish validation cohort, the model
performance was poorer (p = 0.008) compared with Austrian cohorts with a c index of 0.77 (0.67 - 0.88), potentially due to substantial
diﬀerences in patient demographics and clinical routine. Conclusions: Here we describe a formula, requiring only variables routinely acquired
in hospitals, which allows to estimate death probabilities of hospitalized patients with Covid-19. The model could be used as a decision support
for earlier discharge of low-risk patients to reduce the burden on the health care system. The model could further be used to monitor whether
patients should be admitted to hospital in countries with health care systems with emphasis on outpatient care (e.g. Sweden).

Introduction
Background
The Covid-19 pandemic evokes a complex global public
health crisis with clinical, organizational and system-wide
challenges. As we are currently experiencing the second or
even third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Europe as well

as other parts of the world, the health care system in many
countries is at risk to collapse. To date no reliable biomarker
exists to predict patient outcome and severity of disease
progression. Therefore, care providers are often making
decisions based on individual experience or non-validated
biomarkers. Given the intensive workload of health care
providers worldwide, a reliable, easily accessible prognostic
tool would be beneﬁcial.
Although a plethora of prognostic models for Covid-19 were
quickly published at the beginning of the pandemic to support
medical decision making at a time when they were urgently
needed, a large consortium including clinical scientists,

Participants

epidemiologists, biologists, and statisticians, came to the
conclusion that ‘the proposed models are poorly reported, at
high risk of bias, and their reported performance is probably
optimistic’ (Wynants et al., 2020). Based on that, the authors
did ‘not recommend any of these reported prediction models
for use in current practice’, while there remains an urgent need
to develop more rigorous prediction models and validate
promising ones. The authors recommended building on
previous literature and expert opinion to select predictors,
rather than selecting predictors in a purely data driven way.
Promising candidates include age, body temperature, sex,
blood pressure, creatinine, basophils, neutrophils,
lymphocytes, alanine transaminase, albumin, platelets,
eosinophils, calcium, bilirubin, creatinine, CRP and
comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease.
Besides the critically ill patients who need to be treated in
intensive care units, the multitude of patients being treated in
general wards bind substantial resources that would be needed
for patients with other diseases. This negatively impacts the
treatment options of patients who do not have Covid-19,
causing collateral medical damage. Speciﬁcally, the measures
to avoid infection of personnel and spreading of SARS-CoV-2
throughout the hospital, as putting on and taking oﬀ protective
clothing, are time consuming. Nevertheless, many of these
Covid-19 cases cannot be discharged since the critical phase
of Covid-19 frequently starts around 7-10 days after onset of
the initial symptoms. Clearly, a tool reliably predicting the
likelihood of a severe or fatal disease would be beneﬁcial and
could support the decision for an earlier discharge.

The predicted outcome is death from any cause during the
hospital stay. There was no loss to follow up as patients were
either discharged or died.

Objectives

Predictors

Hence, the ﬁrst objective of this study was to develop a
prognostic model with predictors selected based on
pathophysiological considerations and literature.
Importantly, the predictors had to be easily accessible routine
parameters to avoid obstacles to clinical application. The
second objective was to validate the model in independent
cohorts and to provide a publicly available online calculator
and a formula to facilitate decision making during the current
pandemic.

As the aim was to build a prognostic model that has
widespread applicability, only routinely measured variables
were considered, such as measurements of the blood count
and other hematological parameters. Thus, the methods of
measurement are the ones usually used in the respective
hospital.
The ﬁrst selection of predictors from all available variables
was based on graphical inspection of data, providing
information on the time course of variables and the proportion
of missing data. Further selection of possibly useful
predictors considered pathophysiological processes, the
published literature, and had a special focus on the reported
Covid-19-associated coagulopathy. The graphical
exploration showed that although some potential predictors
are not changed to a relevant extent at the time of admission,
they develop considerably diﬀerently between survivors and
non-survivors during hospital stay. Therefore, we included
the variable’s time course in the prognostic model. Since
blood samples were often taken only every two days from
admission, and as data from two days seemed too short for a
prognosis, the pragmatic decision was made to use the data
from day 0 to 4 (i.e., 5 calendar days) after admission for
prognosis. Data processing is described in detail in the
statistical methods section.

Methods
Source of the data
We conducted an observational cohort study to develop and
validate a prognostic model to predict in-hospital mortality of
patients with Covid-19. For this purpose, only data collected
in clinical routine were used. There were no additional
measurements for study purposes. Within all cohorts, data of
all consecutive patients were accessed. For model
development cohorts of three Austrian hospitals were used:
the Clinic Favoriten (former Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital) in
Vienna, the Johannes Kepler University Clinic in Linz and the
Medical University of Innsbruck (cohorts 1-3). The model
was validated in additional consecutive patients treated in the
Clinic Favoriten and other patients treated in the Johannes
Kepler University Clinic in Linz as well as in the Danderyd
Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden (cohorts 4-6).

For model development 417 Covid-19 patients from three
diﬀerent large-scale medical centers were included,
validation is based on 405 patients from two medical centers
in Austria and one in Sweden (Fig. 1). SARS-CoV-2
positivity was determined from nasopharyngeal or
oropharyngeal swabs via real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR) according to the Charité protocol (Corman et al.,
2020). Routine laboratory analyses were performed within
clinical routine. Additional blood withdrawals were
performed if clinically indicated.
All patients had available outcome data at time of analysis.
Of note, the recovery of data at the Clinic Favoriten in Vienna
is part of the ACOVACT study (ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT04351724) approved by the local ethics committee
(EK1315/2020), which aims to compare the eﬀect of diﬀerent
antiviral and adjunctive treatments on outcome of
hospitalized Covid-19 patients. This study was further
approved by the ethics committee of the Innsbruck Medical
University (ID of ethical vote: 1167/2020), the ethics
committee of the Kepler University Clinics (1085/2020) and
the Stockholm Ethical Review Board (COMMUNITY study
dnr 2020-01653).

variables were not blinded to the outcome.
Sample size
A formal sample size calculation was not performed. The
cohort of hospitalized patients suﬀering from Covid-19
continues to grow. For the development of the model, we
roughly oriented ourselves on 10 events per variable,
considering that this rule of thumb might be an
oversimpliﬁcation of the problem regarding an adequate
sample size in logistic regression (Ogundimu et al., 2016;
Vittinghoﬀ and McCulloch, 2007). For validation, we also
aimed for this number in each validation cohort. However, we
had to consider that a model that can potentially reduce the
burden on health systems should be available to the general
public rather sooner than later.
Missing data
There were no missing data regarding outcome. Regarding
missing data of predictors, one has to discriminate two types
in the context of our prognostic model. First, as the time
course of variables over the ﬁrst four days was processed by
linear regression within each patient into the predictors used
in the logistic regression model, the ﬁrst type of missing data
is missing data points within the four days after admission
within a patient. As the frequency and exact time points of
blood samplings within patients naturally diﬀer between
patients and clinics, we decided to ﬁt a linear regression line if
any data on this variable were available. This might, on the
one hand, reduce the regression line’s correspondence of the
underlying biological process, on the other hand allow
application of the model even if very few blood samples are
available within the ﬁrst four days. The second type of
missing data is missingness of the regression coeﬃcients
within a patient, if no blood samples were available, or if a
certain analyte in blood samples was not determined. The
proportion of patients with missing linear regression-based
predictors used for logistic regression was considered low
enough to exclude all patients from the analysis with such
missing data. The number of patients with missing data on
predictors is given in the results section with each result and in
Fig. 1.
Statistical analysis methods
Processing of measured values in blood samples to the
predictors used in logistic regression models
Inspection of the raw data, as shown exemplary for platelet
count and CRP (Fig. 2A, B), suggested that both values
measured in blood samples taken upon admission and those
taken at later time points contain information regarding
survival. Whereas the platelet count appeared to increase
throughout the hospital stay in survivors, this was not
observed in patients who died. Conversely, CRP levels tended
to return to baseline in survivors but increased in nonsurvivors. To make use of these diﬀerent time courses in a
prognostic model, a linear regression approach was used in
each patient and for each potential predictor separately. A
linear regression line was ﬁtted through the data acquired

3

within days 0 to 4 of hospitalization. The resulting intercept
and slope were considered as potential predictors in logistic
regression models. The intercept roughly reﬂects the value at
admission. We also considered using the baseline value on
admission instead of the intercept as predictor in logistic
regression. However, this would have rendered the prognostic
model unusable for patients without blood sampling upon
admission. In contrast, the intercept as an estimate of the
baseline value can also be used when, e.g., only data of day
two and four are available. The slope on the other hand
approximates the change over time. An example of such a
linear regression within a patient’s platelet count data is
shown in Fig. 2C.
Handling of predictors
To avoid a loss of information, all continuous potential
predictors were used as such, i.e., were not categorized.
Although it seems likely that body temperature in its
continuous form would have contained some information
regarding outcome, it was only available as dichotomous
variable fever on admission, ‘Yes’ was coded as 1, ‘No’ as 0.
The distributions of the continuous predictors platelet count
intercept, platelet count slope, CRP intercept and CRP slope
are visualized in Fig. 2D-G separately for survivors and
deceased.
Type of model, variable selection, model building procedures
To estimate death probability, multivariable binary logistic
regression models were used. A subject matter knowledgebased pre-selection of potential predictors was determined
before modeling and is listed in Fig. 2H. We aimed to further
reduce the number of variables during modeling for two
reasons. First, we wanted the ﬁnal model to be as simple as
possible for a high degree of clinical applicability. Second, we
aimed to have a number of events per variable that at least
approximates ten. A bootstrap approach was chosen for this
purpose, whereby 100 random bootstrap samples were
generated from data of cohort 1 at ﬁrst. Following this, the
pre-selection of predictors was entered and subsequently
removed stepwise backward in logistic regression models
built based on each bootstrap sample separately. Which
variables remained in each model was based on the
signiﬁcance of the change in the log-likelihood upon removal
of a variable. The percentage of bootstrap samples in which a
candidate variable was not removed is plotted in Fig. 2H.
Those variables that were retained most often in the model
were chosen. Although fever on admission was retained only
in approximately two thirds of bootstrap samples, it seemed
likely that fever on admission contains information regarding
the outcome, wherefore it was retained in the model.
Univariable predictor outcome analyses were not performed.
Due to the limited number of events at this stage, interactions
were not tested to avoid overﬁtting.
After the ﬁnal selection of the predictors was determined, we
decided to further develop the model before external
validation. To this end we added patient data to the already
existing dataset. As most of the additional patient data were
from diﬀerent cities in Austria than the original one, we
expected that generalizability of the model would be

improved. Based on the combination of the original data and
the new data all regression coeﬃcients were re-estimated. The
resulting model was adjusted for optimism using a linear
shrinkage factor (Steyerberg et al., 2001). In short, 100
random bootstrap samples with the same sample size as the
original dataset were generated from the available data (i.e.,
cohorts 1-3). Within each bootstrap sample, a logistic
regression model was ﬁtted using the previously determined
predictors. This resulted in diﬀerent beta coeﬃcients for each
predictor in each bootstrap sample. Using the coeﬃcients of
these 100 logistic regression models, the prognostic indices
were calculated for each patient in the original sample. The
prognostic index is the linear combination of the regression
coeﬃcients as estimated in the bootstrap sample with the
values of the covariables (e.g., age) in the original sample.
Next, the prognostic index derived from each bootstrap
sample was used as a single covariable in logistic regression
analyses in the original dataset. The beta coeﬃcient of the
single covariable ‘prognostic index’ reﬂects the slope of the
prognostic index. For each bootstrap sample, a slightly
diﬀerent slope occurred. The mean of these slopes, usually
below 1, reﬂects that the regression coeﬃcients are too
extreme for prognostic purposes and was used as linear
shrinkage factor, i.e., the coeﬃcients were multiplied by this
factor. The result was the ﬁnal prognostic formula
subsequently validated externally.
External validation was performed by calculating the death
probabilities of additional patients using the established
formula and calculating performance measures. Thereby,
patients that were treated at the Favoriten Clinics in Vienna
(Cohort 4) and at the Kepler University Hospital, Linz
(Cohort 5) served for validation purposes in the sense of
temporal validation. We also validated the model in a cohort
from the Danderyd hospital in Stockholm, Sweden (Cohort
6).
In addition to plotting the predicted death probabilities of each
patient against the outcome, we used the area under the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (equivalent to
the c statistic) as measure for discrimination. For assessment

of calibration, we plotted the observed risks on the y-axis
versus the predicted risk on the x-axis. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst
generated ﬁve groups of patients. The groups were deﬁned by
predicted death probabilities: i) 0 to ≤ 0.2, ii) > 0.2 to ≤ 0.4,
iii) > 0.4 to ≤ 0.6, iv) > 0.6 ≤ 0.8, v) > 0.8. Within each group,
the mean of all probabilities was calculated, which served as
an x-axis coordinate for the plotted symbol. The y-axis value
was determined by the proportion of deaths in the respective
group. To visualize the uncertainty regarding these
probabilities, 95% conﬁdence intervals were calculated as
described (Brown et al., 2001). Due to the relatively low
number of patients, especially those with higher predicted
death probabilities, ﬁve groups were chosen instead of the
usual ten groups. The performance of the model in the two
Austrian validation cohorts was compared with the
performance of the same model in the Swedish cohort by the
probability P of the z-value corresponding to the AUC
diﬀerence calculated as follows:

Risk groups
Risk groups were not generated, as this generally might not be
in the best interest of patients (Steyerberg, 2009).
Additionally, groups do not seem meaningful in the context of
how our model could be used clinically: To assign insuﬃcient
resources, the patients with the lowest death probability could
be discharged.
Diﬀerences between development and validation
As this study encompasses both development and validation,
diﬀerences in deﬁnitions and variables including their coding
are not of concern. However, in the Swedish cohort, outcome
of in-hospital mortality could in principle be aﬀected by
diﬀerences in admission and discharge practices. This might
aﬀect the proportion of Covid-19 caused deaths occurring in
hospital and thus counting as an event.

Results
Participants
An overview of the cohorts including the number of survivors
and non-survivors is shown in Fig. 1. Patient characteristics
are listed in Tables 1 and 2.
Model development
Predictor selection during modeling
After the subject matter-based pre-selection of predictors,
their selection was further narrowed down using a bootstrap
approach with data of cohort 1. Of 210 patients in this cohort,
6 were not included in the analysis since at least one predictor
had missing data. One of these 6 patients died, leaving 46
deaths to be included in the analysis. The extent of the loss of
information due to these 6 patients seemed negligible.
Therefore, multiple imputation was abstained from and only
complete cases were analyzed. Results (Fig. 2H) suggested
that the following predictors should be retained in the model:
1) patient age in years, 2) fever on admission (binary, with
fever being deﬁned as a body temperature > 38°C), 3) the
intercept of the linear regression line through CRP levels over
time, approximating the level upon admission, 4) the slope of
this regression line, reﬂecting the change per day, 5) the
intercept of the regression line through creatinine levels and
6) the slope of the regression line through the platelet count.
The model including the selected predictors ﬁtted on the
original (non-bootstrapped) data led to the predicted death
probabilities shown in Fig. 2I. The corresponding regression
coeﬃcients and ROC curve can be found in Fig. 2J and K. The
apparent performance measured by the c statistic was 0.97
(95% CI 0.95 - 0.99), Nagelkerke’s pseudo R² measure of
0.776 indicated a large eﬀect size.

Further development and reﬁnement of the model
The initial model based on cohort 1 was updated by adding 33
more patients of the same hospital (referred to as additional
patients of cohort 1), cohort 2 comprising 143 patients and
cohort 3 consisting of 64 patients. Of the total of 450 patients,
9 had missing data, leaving 363 survivors and 78 nonsurvivors. Reestimation of all regression coeﬃcients led to a
slightly reduced eﬀect size indicated by a Nagelkerke’s R² of
0.597 (Fig. 3A). The predicted probabilities of all cohorts are
plotted in Fig. 3B, to allow inspection of predicted
probabilities in each cohort they are also plotted separately by
cohort (Fig. 3C-E). The ROC curve corresponding to the
predicted death probabilities in Fig. 3B is plotted in Fig. 3F.
The adjustment of the regression coeﬃcients for optimism
using a linear shrinkage factor (Fig. 3G) resulted in the
shrunken coeﬃcients (Fig. 3H).
Model speciﬁcation and performance
The explicit formula of the model is given in Fig. 4A. To
calculate a patient's risk one ﬁrst needs to ﬁt linear regression
lines as described in the methods section to obtain intercepts
and slopes for CRP, creatinine, and platelet count. Following
this, the patient’s age in years, the information whether fever
was present upon admission (1 for ‘Yes’ and 0 for ‘No’),
intercepts (abbreviated with ic) and slopes (sl) need to be
entered in the formula. The result is the predicted death
probability. Alternatively, the values in their original form
(e.g. the day after admission with the platelet count in
thousands / µl measured at that day) can be entered into the
online calculator.
The probabilities calculated in this way are presented in
Fig.4B separated by outcome, but pooled for the two Austrian
validation cohorts, with the corresponding ROC curve in Fig.
4C. The c statistic of 0.93 (95% CI 0.90 - 0.96) indicates that

the formula will assign a higher predicted death probability to
a random subject that died compared to a random subject that
survived in 93% of cases. The calibration plot (Fig. 4D) serves
to compare the predicted probabilities over the whole range of
probabilities with the actual outcome. Ideally, the symbols are
exactly positioned on the diagonal dotted line of identity,
which indicates identity of the predicted death probability
with the observed proportion of deaths. The 95% conﬁdence
intervals, being a measure of uncertainty of the observed
proportions, are wider towards higher death probabilities as
there were less patients with a high probability to die than
there were patients with a lower probability. Overall, the
calibration plot shows a clinically useful calibration, with
relatively precise prediction of death in patients with a low
death probability, which is relevant for the model’s intended
use, and a slight overestimation of death probabilities in
patients with a high proportion of deaths. Respective separate
plots for cohorts 4 and 5 (Fig. 4 E-J) show discrimination and
calibration measures for cohort 4 and 5 separately, suggesting
similar performance in both cohorts.
However, the model performed signiﬁcantly worse in the
Swedish validation cohort (Fig. 4K-L). Although still
signiﬁcant, as indicated by a 95% conﬁdence interval of the c
index not including 0.5, both discrimination and especially
calibration seem clinically less useful. Of note, patients from
Sweden showed a longer duration between symptom onset
and admission to the hospital compared to both Austrian
validation cohorts (Fig. 5).
Model performance in relation to the lag time between
symptom onset and hospital admission
It is particularly challenging to assess the future disease
course of Covid-19 patients who have had a more recent onset
of symptoms. Therefore, it is clinically important that the
model also performs well in such a patient collective. To
explore this issue, we grouped all Austrian validation patients
(cohorts 4 and 5) according to their self-reported symptom
onset. Regarding the Swedish cohort, the event count is
currently insuﬃcient to perform an analogous meaningful
subset analysis. As measured by the c indices, the model’s
performance seems to be roughly stable over the range of
periods between symptom onset and admission in Austrian
cohorts (Fig. 6). However, due to the low number of events,
especially in those patients with a long symptom duration
before admission, these exploratory results need to be
interpreted with great caution. Still, even in those patients
where the symptom onset could not be veriﬁed, the model
seems to discriminate between patients who die and those
who survive.
Model updating
The model was not updated after validation.
Discussion
The main result of this study is a simple formula that predicts
the risk of death of hospitalized patients with Covid-19 within
the period of their stay. This information could be used as
additional decision support regarding discharge of clinically

8

stable Covid-19 patients in case adequate therapy is also
available at home. The formula is based on predictors
routinely measured in hospitals, which allows immediate and
widespread use. This is also facilitated by a publicly available
online calculator.
Limitations
The most important limitation is the uncertainty whether the
model performs adequately in other geographical regions
than Austria. Validation in a relatively small Swedish cohort
showed a signiﬁcantly worse model performance than in two
Austrian cohorts. However, we have to state that there are
substantial diﬀerences between the Austrian and the Swedish
cohorts, which could explain the discrepancy in the
performance. First, admission criteria diﬀered between
Austria and Sweden when the patients included in this
analysis were hospitalized. While Swedish patients were only
admitted if they needed additional oxygen, the indication for
hospitalization was far more permissive in Austria.
Consequently, patients in Sweden were hospitalized at a later
stage of the disease, as evidenced by the signiﬁcantly higher
number of days with symptoms before admission in the
Swedish cohort compared to the Austrian ones. Further, the
peak of the ﬁrst wave of the pandemic hit Sweden far stronger
than Austria, which also aﬀected clinical care diﬀerently. For
instance, few patients from nursing homes were admitted to
Swedish hospitals at that time, explaining why the Austrian
cohorts show a wider age distribution compared to the
Swedish cohort. Of note, while in general mortality rates
during spring were much higher in Sweden compared to
Austria, the percentage of in hospital mortalities was much
lower in this cohort compared to Austria (12.5% in Stockholm
versus 22.4% in Vienna at the same period). This indicates
that the hospitalized Swedish cohort represents only a fraction
of severe Covid-19 cases, while in Austria a larger fraction of
patients with severe symptoms were treated in hospital. We
can therefore not completely rule out that if outpatient data
would have been included the performance would have been
similar in both countries. Hence, it is necessary to validate and
possibly adapt the model for other regions.
The model in its original form might also be repurposed for
the decision whether hospitalization should take place. For
example, regular blood samplings could be done in Covid-19
positive patients in nursing homes or outpatient clinics. As
soon as the model indicates a death probability substantially
above zero, a patient could be admitted to hospital to provide
optimal care. Importantly, validation of the model for this
repurposing is warranted.
Another limitation is inextricably linked to the way this
prognostic model is built. The fact that data are used from the
ﬁrst ﬁve calendar days (including the day of admission) of the
hospital stay means that a prognosis can only be made after
this period. However, based on 920 German hospitals with
over 10,000 patients (Karagiannidis et al., 2020), even the less
critical non-ventilated patients had a median stay of 9 days
(interquartile range 5-15 days), while critical (ventilated)
patients stayed much longer. Therefore, despite this
limitation, we believe that earlier discharge of non-critical
patients based on our model could save resources that might

and pathophysiological considerations. For each analyte from blood samplings, intercepts and slopes were calculated. The most important predictors in 100
random bootstrap samples of the original dataset were selected separately within each bootstrap sample using logistic regression with backward stepwise
selection, whereby removal testing was based on the probability of the likelihood-ratio statistic. The horizontal bars indicate the percentage of bootstrap samples
in which the respective variable was retained in the ﬁnal model after the stepwise procedure. Based on that, it was decided to use the variables in bold face with
ﬁlled corresponding bars in the ﬁnal model. I) A logistic regression model with regression coeﬃcients listed in J was estimated using the original dataset and the
previously selected predictors. The resulting estimated probabilities for death are plotted against the observed outcome. J) Regression coeﬃcients of the model in
the original dataset of Cohort 1. Nagelkerke’s R² is given as a measure of eﬀect size and represents a version of the coeﬃcient of determination (R²) for logistic
regression. The odds ratios result from the constant e raised to the power of the respective coeﬃcient. The odds ratio of age, for instance, can be interpreted that
each additional year of age raises the odds of death by a factor of 1.179. K) Corresponding ROC curve. The c statistic indicates the probability that when two
random individuals are selected with diﬀerent outcomes, the model assigns a higher predicted death probability to the subject who died. This probability equals the
area under the ROC-curve. To illustrate which cut-oﬀ values of predicted probabilities for the discrimination between survival and death result in which
combination of true and false positive rates, some exemplary cutoﬀ values are plotted on the curve. Assuming a fatal outcome for every patient above a predicted
death probability of 0.32, for example, results in a sensitivity of 91% and a false positive rate of 7%, i.e., a speciﬁcity of 93%.

beneﬁt patients in a more critical condition.
There is another caveat regarding the interpretation of the
calculated death probabilities. As can be seen in the
calibration plots of the validation in Austrian cohorts (Fig. 4D,
G, J) in the lower left corners, the lower predicted
probabilities agree well with the observed proportion of
deaths. Conﬁdence in this regard is quite high, as indicated by
the relatively small error bars reﬂecting the 95% conﬁdence
intervals. These narrow intervals result from a large sample
size of patients at low risk. Conversely, the upper right corner
shows that the probabilities of death appear to be
overestimated, and that the corresponding uncertainty
indicated by the wide 95% conﬁdence intervals is high. Thus,
while the model might be quite accurate in case the true
underlying proportion of deaths is in the range of the upper
end of the conﬁdence interval plotted, i.e., near the line of
identity, it might also be that the model markedly
overestimates the probabilities of death if the actual
proportion of non-survivors is more likely to be at the lower
end of the conﬁdence interval. Notably, this limitation does
not aﬀect the clinical usability of the model because only the
lowest probabilities would result in consequences, i.e.,
discharge, whereas high estimated probabilities would not
have practical implications. From our point of view, it is
therefore essential to convey to patients that a high predicted
probability of death is associated with considerable
uncertainty and must therefore under no circumstances be
interpreted as a certain death verdict. On the other hand, much
greater conﬁdence can be placed in a very low estimated
probability of death.
Interpretation
Model performance in validation datasets compared to
development data
As this study contains both development and validation of the
model, diﬀerences in predictor deﬁnitions do not apply. Also,
the validated model is identical to the ﬁnal version of
development. As could already be expected by the shrinkage
factor relatively close to 1, the model performance was good
in the Austrian validation cohorts originating from the same
hospitals as the patient data used for development. However,
the model performed not as good in a small Swedish cohort,
potentially due to discrepancies outlined in the limitation
section.

Overall interpretation
Our prognostic model is far from being the ﬁrst. However, as
many of the previously published ones must be assumed to be
at high risk for bias (Wynants et al., 2020), we believe that our
model can make a valuable contribution to relieving the
burden on health systems. Compared to other well developed
and validated models, e.g., the 4C mortality Score (Knight et
al., 2020), ours distinguishes patients who die from those who
survive better than many others, indicated by a c index well
above 0.9. However, this good performance may be
geographically limited. As a result, we can only recommend
the use of the model in Austria before the model has been
validated in other regions and, if necessary, adapted to them.
In addition, we strictly adhered to the TRIPOD reporting
guideline (Moons et al., 2015) and provide the whole datasets
to allow our work to be scrutinized.
Another aspect that discriminates our model from others is the
use of the time course of variables. Many others merely
included the values at admission, which is reasonable, as
information regarding prognosis should be available as early
as possible. However, as our data show, many diﬀerences
between survivors and non-survivors only develop over the
course of a few days. While the use of this information is a
major strength of our model, it could also be one of its possible
drawbacks as decision making takes until day 4 of
hospitalization. Clinical variables considered and ﬁnally
included in our model have been included in other prognostic
models for Covid-19, and are biologically plausible. The
underlying pathogenesis of Covid-19 seems complex, yet
four main intertwined loops (the viral, the hyperinﬂammatory,
the non-canonical renin-angiotensin system (RAS) axis and
the hypercoagulatory loop) responsible for patient
deterioration have been identiﬁed. Three out of the four loops
are represented in our model. The pathology starts with the
viral loop and is rapidly followed by the second loop, the
hyperinﬂammatory loop, which is represented by CRP in our
model. CRP levels positively correlate with lung lesions and
disease severity in Covid-19 (Manson et al., 2020; Wang,
2020). Therefore, daily monitoring CRP values in
hospitalized Covid-19 patients has been suggested to
facilitate risk stratiﬁcation and prognostication (Sharifpour et
al., 2020). This suggestion is implemented by the CRP
intercept and slope and is in agreement with a recent paper
demonstrating that diversion of inﬂammatory marker trends
over time predict a fatal or good outcome of severe Covid-19

University, Linz, Austria. F) ROC curve corresponding to death probabilities plotted in B. G) To adjust the regression coeﬃcients for optimism, a shrinkage
approach with a linear shrinkage factor was applied (Steyerberg et al., 2001). In short, the regression coeﬃcients were estimated in each bootstrap sample. Next,
the prognostic index, i.e., the result of the linear combination of the regression coeﬃcients, was determined in the original dataset for each patient based on the
coeﬃcients of each bootstrap sample. This resulted in 100 prognostic indices for each patient in the original data, corresponding to the 100 bootstrap samples.
Subsequently, the prognostic indices for each patient were used as a single covariable in a logistic regression using the original dataset. The coeﬃcient of the
covariable, i.e., the slope, naturally diﬀers between prognostic indices derived from diﬀerent bootstrap samples. The violin plot shows the distribution of the
slopes based on the 100 bootstrap samples, the circle with the error bar represents the mean. The mean slope less than 1 indicates that the original coeﬃcients are
too extreme for predictive purposes, but with a mean slope of 0.969 there was only a slight overestimation. H) Shrinkage of the original coeﬃcients according to
the mean slopes, i.e., the linear shrinkage factor.

(Manson et al., 2020).
Lymphocyte counts have been suggested previously as
prognostic markers as well. Although changes in leukocyte
counts are clinical indicators of disease progression in Covid-

19, investigating the changes in lymphocytes might be
important for prediction (Fouladseresht et al., 2020).
However, based on the variable selection method employing
random bootstrap samples inclusion of this parameter as

a predictor of adverse outcome in Covid-19 (Li et al., 2020).
In line with studies on other viral infectious diseases, a study
found that prolonged fever for 7 days from onset of illness is
associated with adverse outcomes from Covid-19, while
saddleback fever is not indicative of adverse outcome (Ng et
al., 2020). In our model fever at admission was incorporated
in the prediction model. The time course of body temperature
would have been interesting to include, however, available
records only allowed inclusion as a binary variable.
Implications
For the time being, the model is primarily applicable to
patients hospitalized with veriﬁed Covid-19 and should
support decision making on earlier discharge. Since the model
performed best within the Austrian health care system,
validation of the model in diﬀerent regions is required to
assess where it can be used in its original form and where it
needs to be adapted.
The model was developed for and its use should be restricted
to a speciﬁc clinical application, if not validated for other
purposes. In case the number of patients with Covid-19 in the
general ward exceeds numbers that can easily be handled and
thus binds resources that would be urgently needed elsewhere,
the attending physicians could decide to discharge those
patients with the lowest model-predicted death probabilities.
It is vital that the estimated probability is not the sole criterion
for decision-making and that the physician should always
include a further assessment of the situation. Furthermore, it
should be ascertained that discharge has no relevant impact on
treatments, i.e., only those patients should be discharged
where an adequate treatment can be implemented on an
outpatient basis or in quarantine. It is necessary to emphasize
that high estimated death probabilities should not be
overinterpreted, as their reliability is not as well determined as
Symptom onset, days before admission

intercept and slope would not have led to a relevant
improvement of the model.
Further, LDH is related to inﬂammation and cell damage and
has been suggested as a risk factor for severe Covid-19 (Chen
et al., 2020; Poggiali et al., 2020). However, both intercept
and slope remained in less than 20% of the bootstrap samples,
which indicated that this variable was less important and was
therefore dropped from the model.
In addition, the third loop, the non-canonical reninangiotensin system (RAS) axis loop was described, which is
in a broader sense represented by creatinine in our model.
Kidney involvement in Covid-19 is common and associated
with high mortality and was described to serve as an
independent risk factor for all-cause in-hospital mortality in
patients with Covid-19 (Ali et al., 2020). Renal viral tropism
has been reported, which is also associated with age and
comorbidities as well as decreased survival (Braun et al.,
2020). Data for more than 17 million people in the UK suggest
that patients with chronic kidney disease are at higher risk for
adverse events in Covid-19 than those with other known risk
factors, including chronic heart and lung disease. (Gansevoort
and Hilbrands, 2020). The fact that the slope of creatinine
seemed to have less prognostic value than the intercept might
reﬂect the importance of chronic kidney disease.
The fourth loop is the hypercoagulatory loop, which is
represented by platelet count in this model. A meta-analysis of
7,613 Covid-19 patients revealed that patients with severe
disease had a lower platelet count than those with non-severe
disease (Jiang et al., 2020), which is in line with our data.
However, not all studies have found platelet counts to be a
predictor of Covid-19 mortality (Amgalan and Othman,
2020). This would also have been the case in our cohort if only
the platelet count upon admission would have been
considered. Accordingly, changes in platelet count were
retained in the model in the form of the slope.
Undoubtedly the most important predictor of severe Covid-19
is age. A meta-analysis of 88 articles (69,762 patients) shows
that age along with CRP were strong risk-factors for ICU
admission and/or mortality (Katzenschlager et al., 2020).
Since the incidence and severity of many diseases are
positively correlated with age, this variable could implicitly
include many other diseases in the model. Moreover, aging
itself leads to inﬂammatory and immunological changes
which could directly aﬀect the response to viral infection and
accelerate disease progression in Covid-19. A recent metaanalysis of twelve studies that investigated the role of age in
Covid-19 indicates that the risk increased in some but not all
studies when adjusting for important age-dependent risk
factors as diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease,
cerebrovascular disease, compromised immunity, previous
respiratory disease, and renal disease (Romero Starke et al.,
2020).
Concerning fever, a recent meta-analysis reported that fever is

low death probabilities.
There is no general recommendation for a cutoﬀ value, below
which an earlier discharge would be justiﬁed. This cutoﬀ
depends on current strain on the health care system. In case
patients need to be discharged, one could start with the ones
with the lowest death probabilities. In this case, the ROCcurves provide the proportion of true and false positives for a
speciﬁc cutoﬀ.
In countries which rely on outpatient care, the model could be
repurposed to decide whether patient hospitalisation is
indicated to provide optimal treatment for patients requiring
intensive care. Future research should include validation of
the model in diﬀerent geographical regions, repurposing for
outpatient care and updating, as standard of care and the
pandemic evolve.
