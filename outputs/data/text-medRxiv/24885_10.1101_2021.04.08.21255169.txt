Abstract
We analyzed the number of cumulative positive cases of COVID-19 as a
function of time in countries around the World. We tracked the increase in
cases from the onset of the pandemic in each region for up to 150 days.
We found that in 81 out of 146 regions the trajectory was described with a
power-law function for up to 30 days. We also detected scale-free
properties in the majority of sub-regions in Australia, Canada, China, and
the United States (US). We developed an allometric model that was
capable of fitting the initial phase of the pandemic and was the best
predictor for the propagation of the illness for up to 100 days. We then
determined that the power-law COVID-19 exponent correlated with
measurements of human mobility. The COVID-19 exponent correlated
with the magnitude of air passengers per country. This correlation
persisted when we analyzed the number of air passengers per US states,
and even per US metropolitan areas. Furthermore, the COVID-19
exponent correlated with the number of vehicle miles travelled in the US.
Together, air and vehicular travel explained 70 % of the variability of the
COVID-19 exponent. Taken together, our results suggest that the scalefree propagation of the virus is present at multiple geographical scales and
is correlated with human mobility. We conclude that models of disease
transmission should integrate scale-free dynamics as part of the modeling
strategy and not only as an emergent phenomenological property.

Introduction
There is an increasing number of studies showing that the number of positive cases of
COVID-19 have power-law dynamics (1-9). If indeed, the propagation of the illness is
governed by scale-free processes and is not only an emergent dynamic from complex
interactions that assume exponential growth then, modeling strategies might have to be
revised. However, except for a few cases (3), these studies have focused on a few
countries or regions. Thus, it is important to understand how prevalent power-law
propagation is around the World. It is also important to understand if a power-law

spread of the illness measured at a national level is reflected in its sub-regions.
Furthermore, since policies on restricting the spread of the virus have included reducing
mobility, it is necessary to find how that affects the power-law properties of the
propagation of COVID-19 (10).
Traditional modeling approaches to illness propagations, such as COVID-19,
assume an exponential growth (11-16). However, increasing evidence shows that
human dynamics have power-law properties (17-20). In fact, recent work has shown
that multiple measurements of human activity follow allometric properties such as
𝑤 ∝ 𝑁 𝛼 , where N is the number of individuals and w a metric of activity (21). Since
most of the world population now lives in urban areas (22) it is important to consider
how such urban human dynamics affects the spread of illnesses. Furthermore, since
asymptomatic transmission is a prevalent feature of SARS-Cov-2 (as the virus that
causes COVID-19) (23) then the virus will propagate in a population following the
dynamics of the healthy population, as opposed to illnesses in which the probability of
infections is highest when individuals are symptomatic (24). Therefore, the spread of
COVID-19 could be influenced by allometric properties observed in urban areas.
In this project, our aim was to understand the spread of the virus at the beginning
of the pandemic. For this, we analyzed the total positive cases of COVID-19 in all
countries and regions in the World. We also analyzed sub-regional behavior in four
countries in three continents. Furthermore, we studied the spread of the virus in the
United States (US) at the national, state, and urban levels. We found that the majority of
countries followed a power-law in the cumulative number of positive cases of COVID-19
for at least 30 days. The majority of the sub-regions of the countries we studied,
including 33 of the 50 US states, followed power-law dynamics. We built an allometric
growth model that was able to replicate the power-law increase in COVID-19 cases.
More interestingly, the model was also capable of capturing the dynamics of the initial
days of the pandemic, which did not follow power-law increases. We tested the model’s
predictive power by extrapolating its values up to 100 days and compared to actual
data. We show that the allometric growth model is better than a simple power-law or
exponential fits. We end the study by showing that the value of the COVID-19 powerlaw exponent is correlated with air travel at the world, national, and metropolitan scales.
For the US we show that 70 % of the variance of the value of the power-law exponent is
explained by air and vehicular travel. Overall, our work shows that power-law behavior
of the spread of COVID-19 is observed across scales, it is related to human mobility,
and that allometric models are a good strategy to increase the predictive power of
computational studies.

Results
Power-law propagation of COVID-19 at the global and regional scales
We studied the number of cumulative test positive cases of COVID-19 (𝐼) in 187
countries and territories from 22 January 2020 to 23 August 2020. We wanted to obtain
a date that acted as reference for a period of sustained increase. For this purpose, for
each region, we started our analysis after 𝐼 ≥ (𝐼𝑇ℎ = 100). We did this to avoid plateaus
and sudden changes in cases reported in the first days of the pandemic. Then, we
calculated the ratio between 21 days (𝑅 = 𝐼(𝑡 + 21)/𝐼(𝑡)) and we selected the day (𝐼𝑜 )

when 𝑅2 ≥ 2 for the first time. As a result, we obtained a list of 146 regions. The other
41 regions included countries with small populations; regions that had a spread of the
pandemic slower than 𝑅2 ; or than when they reached that threshold did not have
enough data points for analysis (at least 35 days). We then fitted the cumulative cases
per day to a power-law, 𝐼 = 𝑡 𝛼 + 𝑏, where 𝛼 is the COVID-19 exponent; or an
exponential function, 𝐼 = 𝐴 𝑒𝑥𝑝(𝑡/𝜏) + 𝑑, where τ is the time constant. In order to
compare the fits, we fitted all the traces over a range that started 𝐹𝑠 = 5 days after 𝐼𝑜
and lasted 30 days (𝐹𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒 ), except for Australia (𝐹𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒 =15) and China (𝐹𝑠 = 3 and
𝐹𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒 = 10) because of their early strict social mobility policies. The mean value of
cumulative cases on 𝐼𝑜 was 124.31 ± 5.44 SEM cases. We calculated the root mean
square error (RMSE) and the r-square values for each fit. We determined the goodness
of fit by comparing the RMSE of the power-law and exponential fits. The fit with the
lowest RMSE had to have an r-square larger than 0.97. This analysis showed 81regions
were better fit by a power-law, 31 were better explained by an exponential fit, and 34 by
neither (see Supplementary Materials). We plotted the trajectories of all regions fitted by
a power-law for 100 days after their respective 𝐼𝑜 (107 of the 146 areas had enough
data points). This showed that the propagation followed a similar trajectory (Figure 1,
the Supplementary Materials contain the table form data). The average value of the
COVID-19 exponent was ̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
𝛼𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑙𝑑 =1.50 ± 0.08 SEM with an inter-quantile range of 0.99.
The propagation of COVID-19 seems to follow a different trajectory than previous
pandemics. For example, we analyzed the total positive cases during the Ebola
epidemic in West Africa and influenza deaths during the 1918 pandemic in Philadelphia
and found that both follow exponential fits (25) (Supplementary Materials Figure S1).
Thus, our analysis suggested that most of the regions in the world experienced a
power-law increase in the propagation of COVID-19.
We were interested in understanding if the propagation of COVID-19 followed
power-law dynamics in sub-regions within countries. For this, we chose Australia,
Canada, China, and the Unites States (US). In the case of Australia, our algorithm
determined that the propagation of COVID-19 followed an exponential function. Never
the less, we studied the propagation of the pandemic in all Australian states. In order to
detect the onset of activity in a smaller population we used an 𝐼𝑇ℎ = 20 (Figure 2a). Our
regional analysis shows that 5 of the 8 Australian states had a power-law propagation
𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠
with a mean of 𝛼𝐴𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑎
= 1.47 ± 0.26 𝑆𝐸𝑀. The states that followed power-law
dynamics included most of the Australian population. However, the most populous
state, New South Wales, followed exponential growth. Another aspect that did not allow
the power-law dynamics be reflected nationally was that the start of the epidemic in
each state (day of first reported case) took place over 18 days. Thus, while the
propagation of the illness appeared exponential at the national level the majority of the
country showed power-law behavior.
The same analysis in Canada showed that 8 out of 14 provinces and territories
𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠
followed power-law propagation with an average of 𝛼𝐶𝑎𝑛𝑎𝑑𝑎
= 1.84 ± 0.32 𝑆𝐸𝑀. In this
case, the national propagation of COVID-19 also followed a power-law increase with a
value of 𝛼𝐶𝑎𝑛𝑎𝑑𝑎 = 2.57 ± 0.08 𝐶𝐼95. In this case, the national result was influenced by
the faster propagation of COVID-19 in more populous provinces, with British Columbia

2.14 ± 0.17 𝐶𝐼95), which was dominated by Hubei, where the virus originated (𝛼𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑎
=
2.14 ± 0.17 𝐶𝐼95) (Figure 2c). Finally, for the US, we used 𝐼𝑇ℎ = 10, 𝐹𝑠 = 5, and
𝐹𝑅𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒 = 20. This analysis showed that 33 of 50 states had power-law dynamics
𝑆𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑠
(𝛼𝑈𝑆
= 2.37 ± 0.12 𝑆𝐸𝑀). Again, the analysis for the entire country shows a faster
propagation (𝛼𝑈𝑆 = 3.98 ± 0.21 𝐶𝐼95) (Figure 3). Overall, our regional analysis shows
that COVID-19 propagated following power-law dynamics in the early stages of the
pandemic.

An allometric model predicts the spread of cases
The propagation of COVID-19 seems to have been driven by asymptomatic infected
individuals. This is different from other illnesses in which patients are infectious when
showing symptoms. Thus, the modeling approach should be based on the behavior of
healthy populations. Increasing information shows that the metrics of metropolitan
community activity have a power-law, or allometric, scaling with the size of the
population (21). We assumed that human activity, for example travel, shows such
behavior and thus the activity of the infected population could be described by:
𝑊 = 𝑎𝐼 𝑏 #1
As postulated by others (see eq 4.65 and 4.67 in (26)), the state of resources used by a
population can be described by:
𝑑𝐼
𝑊 =𝑅𝐼+𝐸
#2
𝑑𝑇
Re-arranging and renaming variables we obtained:
𝑑𝐼
= 𝛾𝐼(𝑡)𝑏 − 𝛽𝐼(𝑡)#3
𝑑𝑇
Where 𝛾is the classical rate of infections and, in our simplified model, 𝛽 is the
number of recovered or diseased. This model is equivalent to one in which the rate of
infection depends on time:
𝑑𝐼
= 𝛾𝐼(𝑡)𝑏−1 𝐼(𝑡) − 𝛽𝐼(𝑡) = 𝛾 ∗ (𝑡)𝐼(𝑡) − 𝛽𝐼(𝑡)#4
𝑑𝑇
In the Methods section, we show that the solution to equation 3 has a temporal
regime in which the model has power-law behavior, 𝐼 ∝ 𝑡 𝛼 , and the relation of b with 𝛼
is:
1
𝛼=
#5
1−𝑏
With 𝑏 < 1.
We fitted the solution of our allometric model using the same parameters used to
fit the power-law function. We used the value of 𝛼 that we calculated before and allowed
the fitting algorithm to get values for 𝛾 and 𝛽. While fitting the data from the start of the
spread was not our objective, we compared the values predicted by the fits to the
number of cases at 𝐼0 . This shows that in the allometric fit deviated -52 %, the powerlaw -73 % and the exponential 181 % (see examples in Figure 4a and 4b). These
results suggested that the allometric model could better fit the behavior of cases in the
initial days of the pandemic. In order to compare the predictive power of the power-law,
exponential, and allometric fits we calculated the percentage difference between the

models and real data for up to 100 days after the last day used for the fit (only 20
regions had enough data points for this analysis). This analysis shows that the
allometric fit is the best model to predict the propagation of COVID-19 (Figure 4a, right).
The same analysis for US states also shows that the allometric model provides reliable
predictions of the evolution of the spread (Figure 4b). Overall, our allometric model is a
parsimonious framework to model the initial spread of the pandemic and provides
strong predictive power.
Human travel is correlated with propagation of COVID-19 from countries to cities
Lockdown measures enacted to reduce the spread of COVID-19 included the reduction
of human mobility. In this context, we wanted to understand how travel affects the value
of 𝛼. As such, we analyzed the relationship between the number of air passengers per
country against the value of 𝛼. We found that the magnitude (Log10) of the number of
𝑊𝑜𝑟𝑙𝑑
passengers strongly correlated to the value of 𝛼, with 𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑟
= 0.71, 𝑝 ≪ 0.05 (Figure
5a). We repeated this analysis for the number of air passengers in the 33 US states that
𝑈𝑆
were described with a power-law. Here again we found a strong correlation, 𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑟
=
0.66, 𝑝 ≪ 0.05 (Figure 5b). We also analyzed the countries and US states that were
better described by an exponential fit. In this case, we again found a significant
correlation between the value of the calculated time constant and the magnitude of air
travel (Supplementary Figure S2). This suggested that the processes represented by a
time constant could be also part of a slower power-law process. Furthermore, we
analyzed the spread of COVID-19 in 30 metropolitan areas that corresponded to the
largest airports by number of passengers in the US. From these, 23 metropolitan
regions serviced by those airports showed a power-law increase and there was a
𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠
correlation coefficient of 𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑟
= 0.53, 𝑝 = 0.01 (Figure 5c). Together, our analysis
suggests a strong effect of air travel magnitude in the power-law propagation of COVID19.
The previous analysis suggest that air travel affects the dynamics of the
propagation of the virus. However, this could be due to long-distance movement and not
directly related to air travel. In order to compare the propagation of the virus to other
forms of travel we studied vehicle miles traveled in the US. We obtained the data for
urban, suburban, and rural travel per state. Our results show that there is no correlation
between the value of 𝛼 per state against the corresponding average urban miles
𝑆𝑢𝑏𝑢𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑛
𝑈𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑛
(𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑠
𝑈𝑆 = −0.21, 𝑝 = 0.23) and suburban miles travelled (𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑈𝑆 = 0.16, 𝑝 = 0.38,
Figures 5d and 5e). However, there is a positive correlation with rural miles traveled
𝑅𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑙
(𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑠
𝑈𝑆 = 0.43, 𝑝 = 0.01, Figure 5f). There was no correlation between the number of
air passengers per state and any of the three measurements of miles traveled per state
(although the urban miles were almost significant, see Supplementary Materials),
suggesting that the two modes of transport contribute independently to the propagation
of the virus. Finally, we constructed linear models for all the combinations of air
passenger and miles traveled by state against their respective value of 𝛼. This showed
that air passengers accounted for 43 % of the observed variance of 𝛼 but when
combined with the three measurements of miles traveled by vehicle the model accounts
for 70 % of the variance observed in the value of 𝛼 (Figure 6).

Discussion
The power-law propagation of COVID-19 was reported recent in the pandemic (9, 27).
In our current work, we found that the total positive cases of COVID -19 infection follows
a power-law increase in the majority of the regions of the World as well as at the
regional level in Australia, Canada, China, and the US.
The emergence of power-law propagation of the virus could be due to different
time constants of the propagation that together appear as a power-law or due to the
effect of lockdown measures (10). However, we showed that power-law behavior is
present in sub-regions of geographically large countries (Australia and Canada) or with
big populations (China and US). We went further to show that metropolitan regions
served by the busiest airports also showed power-law dynamics. This multi-scale
property suggests that the propagation of the virus is following scale-free human
dynamics properties (28).
The power-law infection dynamics could also be comparable to the
experimentally observed power-law dispersal of bank note trajectories (28) which was
used as a proxy for human travel on all geographical length scales. Other previous work
(29, 30) showed that the spread of SARS 2003 can be reproduced by a model that
considers nearly the entire civil aviation network; however, this model could only
describe global trends but not local spatial scales. Other work has found an association
between mobility patterns and COVID-19 transmission in the US (31). Their analysis
showed that mobility patterns were strongly correlated with decreased COVID-19 case
growth rates for the most affected counties in the US. An early analysis of COVID-19
propagation show the importance of air travel in the propagation of the virus (32).
The traditional SIR (33) (susceptible, infected, recovered) model can be
recovered from our allometric equation by setting b = 1 . An area of further study is to
understand how some illnesses are better described by the classical SIR approach. In
order to formulate the allometric model we hypothesized that the behavior of healthy
populations follows scale-free dynamics. This allometric property could arise from small
world networks (34) in human society. Since COVID-19 seems to have a significant
component of asymptomatic transmission, the propagation of the virus has access to
the two important features of small world networks: a clustering coefficient larger than in
random networks, and a logarithmically increasing diameter that depends on the
number of interactions. In this context, when a virus propagates symptomatically, then
we assume that individuals reduce their interactions, particularly those that go across
clusters, thus not allowing the virus to propagate across the network and only
interacting with their nearest connections. However, further modeling and analytical
work is required to test these ideas.
Our analysis confirms that the power-law dynamics of COVID-19 is correlated to
human dynamics. In fact, 𝛼 is correlated to air travel passengers per country. In the US,
𝛼 is also correlated to air passengers per state and metropolitan area. Furthermore, 𝛼 is
correlated with some types of vehicle travel. Our simplified allometric model was able to
predict the evolution of the illness several weeks in advance. These observations let us
to conclude that current models of disease transmission should integrate power-law
dynamics as part of the modeling strategy and not only as an emergent
phenomenological property.

Methods
Data
The data for the number of cases of COVID-19 across the World was obtained from the
Github repository of the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering
(35). The data file contained information for sub-regions in Australia, Canada, and
China (36).
The data for US states (us-states.csv) and counties (us-counties.csv) were
obtained from the New York Times database(37).
The data for World air travel was obtained from the World Bank (38). We used
the data reported for 2019. The data for Norway and Sweden was obtained from
www.statista.com (39, 40).
The data for the number of air travel passengers for the US was obtained from
the 2019 airport ranking by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (41). From the
location of each airport, we computed the total number of passengers for each state. In
the case of New York, we incorporated the numbers of La Guardia (located in New
Jersey).
To calculate the spread of COVID-19 in the metropolitan areas served by major
airports we used the US county database. We created custom software that extracted
the number of cases for the counties that corresponded to a given metropolitan area.
The cumulative number of COVID-19 in each metropolitan area was fitted as in all the
other cases.
The data on number of vehicles miles traveled for each US state in urban,
suburban, and rural areas was also obtained from the Bureau of Transportation
statistics that corresponded to 2017 (42).
The data on the 1918 pandemic in Philadelphia and the Ebola pandemic in West
Africa were obtained from Fig 1 and Fig 2 of (25) by data extraction using the software
‘WebPlot Digitizer’ (43).
Model
We solved the allometric growth equation (Eq. 3) where 𝑏 < 1 and 𝛾 and 𝛽 are
constants. If 𝛾 is much larger than 𝛽, then the growth of 𝐼(𝑡) saturates to reach the
equilibrium value:
1

𝐼𝑒𝑞 =

𝛾 1−𝑏
( ) #6
𝛽

If we make a change of variables in Eq. 3:
𝐼(𝑡) = 𝑢(𝑡)𝑟 #7
we obtain,
1
𝑢̇ = {𝛾𝑢1−(1−𝑏)𝑟 − 𝛽𝑢}#8
We set 𝑟 =

1
1−𝑏

𝑟

which turns Eq. 8 into:
𝑢̇ = −𝛾 ′ 𝑢 + 𝛽′ #9

with
𝛾 ′ = (1 − 𝑏)𝛽#10
and
𝛽′ = (1 − 𝑏)𝛾#11
Thus, we get

exponential cases. For the allometric function, we did not perform any modifications. In
all instances we used the fit() function in Matlab with a non-linear least square
algorithm. Individual fits are reported with their 95 % confidence intervals (CI95). Pooled
data is reported with standard error of the mean (SEM). All scripts and data files are

in 2017. B) and C) same as in A but for total passengers per state in the US (B) and for
metropolitan areas served by the major airports in the US. D-F) as in A-D for the
average miles traveled by vehicle in urban (D), suburban (E), and rural (F) areas. Lines
were plotted when the correlations were significant. See text for details.

Figure 6. The variance observed in the power-law COVID-19 exponent (𝛼) in the US is
explained by air and vehicle travel. A) Rendering of the values of 𝛼 versus number of air
passengers and rural miles traveled per US state. The linear model (grid) explains 57 %
of the variance. A model including urban and suburban miles explains 70 %. B) a
different view angle of the same data. See text for details.
