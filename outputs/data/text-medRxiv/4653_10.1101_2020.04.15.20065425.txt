ABSTRACT

The severe acute respiratory syndrome virus SARS-CoV-2, a close relative of the SARS-CoV
virus, is the cause of recent COVID-19 pandemic affecting, to date, nearly 2 million
individuals across the globe and demonstrating relatively high rates of infection and
mortality. A third virus, the H5N1, responsible for avian influenza, has caused infection
with some clinical similarities to those in COVID-19 infections.
Cytokines, small proteins that modulate immune responses, have been directly implicated
in some of the severe responses seen in COVID-19 patients, e.g. cytokine storms.
Understanding the immune processes related to COVID-19, and other similar infections,
could help identify diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets.
Here we examine data of cytokine, immune cell types, and disease associations captured
from biomedical literature associated with coronavirus, SARS, and H5N1 influenza, with
the objective of identifying potentially useful relationships and areas for future research.
Cytokine and cell-type associations captured from MeSH terms linked to thousands of
PubMed abstracts, has identified differing patterns of associations between the three
corpuses of abstracts (coronavirus, SARS, or H5N1 influenza). Clustering of cytokinedisease co-occurrences in the context of coronavirus has identified compelling clusters of
co-morbidities and symptoms, some of which already known to be linked to COVID-19.
Finally, network analysis identified sub-networks of cytokines and immune cell types
associated with different manifestations, co-morbidities and symptoms of coronavirus,
SARS, and H5N1.
Systematic review of research in medicine is essential to facilitate evidence-based choices
about health interventions. In a fast moving pandemic the approach taken here will identify
trends and enable rapid comparison to the literature of related diseases.

INTRODUCTION
The recent respiratory disease pandemic (COVID-19) [1], caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has both high rates of infection
as well as high mortality rates [2, 3]. In many inflammatory diseases, signaling proteins
termed cytokines play a critical role in disease pathology. These proteins are secreted
mainly from hematopoietic cells including lymphocytes and macrophages, and along with
such cells, play a central role in many diseases as well as in health [4-7]. In the case of
COVID-19, and other viral diseases, they can significantly affect the course and outcome for
the patient. This may manifest itself as a cytokine release syndrome or cytokine storm,
observed in many patients as highly elevated levels of these proteins during acute disease.
While first linked to the 1918 influenza pandemic [8] the cytokine storm was extensively
documented in the avian H5N1 influenza virus infection [9]. H5N1 influenza virus causes
acute lung injury as also observed in COVID-19. Acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) is the principal cause of respiratory failure associated with severe influenza as it is
with COVID-19 and other members of the Coronavirus family. In severe influenza
infections the extent of lung injury is due to dysregulated inflammatory responses. Hence,
to compare and contrast immune-related trends in H5N1 influenza and coronavirus
infections could enable clinical research to more effectively consider treatment options.
SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV, the virus responsible for the 2003 SARS
pandemic. Since COVID-19 is an emerging pandemic, there is currently less data available
on the involvement of the immune system. However, the resource available for
Coronaviruses more generally, SARS more specifically, as well as H5N1 influenza, makes it
possible to gain insight into the pathology associated with SARS-CoV-2, in respect of proinflammatory events and lung damage.
One rich, readily available source of immune- and disease-related knowledge is the corpus
of published scientific research. Within research publications, a copious amount of diseaserelated trends are captured; these can be freely extracted from PubMed records [10]. We
have previously developed a framework for extracting disease-immune relationships from
PubMed abstracts by relying on the linking of such abstracts to concepts from Medical
Subject Headings (MeSH) [11]. MeSH is the National Library of Medicine’s controlled
vocabulary thesaurus, consisting of terms (naming and descriptors) within a hierarchical
structure; they are used for indexing MEDLINE PubMed publications. MeSH descriptors
associated with each MEDLINE citation are manually assigned and provide a
straightforward, and useful, knowledge resource. Numerous works using concept cooccurrences in biomedical texts or in associated MeSH terms have shown the utility of
MeSH in capturing biomedical knowledge [12-18]. Our own assessment of the ability of
MeSH descriptors associated within the same PubMed record to represent a true
(meaningful and feasible) relationship between the terms has shown that co-occurrence of
MeSH descriptors linked to any given PubMed record are a good source for mining
dependencies between different types of biomedical entities [11].
The work presented here examines immune-related molecular and cellular patterns in the
context of Coronaviruses, SARS, and in H5N1 influenza. By identifying links between these
conditions and different immune system players, novel research can be better targeted at
areas of greater impact.

METHODS
Extracting PubMed Record-Associated MeSH Descriptors
A complete description of the approach taken by this study can be found in [11]. Briefly, a
list of cytokine MeSH descriptors (such as “interferon gamma,” “transforming growth factor
beta,” and “chemokine CCL3”) was manually compiled by a domain expert, who browsed
MeSH’s sub-trees and selected those descriptors that were deemed relevant to this work.
Similarly, a list of immune-related cell type MeSH descriptors (such as “lymphocytes,” “Th1
cells,” and “basophils”) was also compiled (see Supplementary File 1). A comprehensive list
of disease names and synonyms was extracted from the Human Disease Ontology. This
approach to capturing associations between disease, cytokines and different cell types had
been extensively evaluated, as described in [11]. For each PubMed abstract (see below) the
associated MeSH descriptors were recorded, and the lists of cytokine names, cell types, and
diseases were searched for exact matches.
PubMed data
The PubMed database was searched on April 6th, 2020 for abstracts tagged with either the
‘Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome’ MeSH term, the ‘influenza a virus, h5n1 subtype’
MeSH term, or with the ‘Coronavirus’ MeSH term (excluding those with the SARS Mesh
term). These searches formed the SARS corpus with a total of 4493 abstracts, the H5N1
corpus with a total of 5975 abstract, and the Coronavirus corpus with a total of 9810
abstracts, respectively (Figure 1).

linked to the ‘Coronavirus’ MeSH term but not to the SARS MeSH term.

Clustering and correlation analysis
In order to examine disease similarities based on cytokine or cell-type co-occurrences in
the context of Coronavirus or SARS, we set out to cluster these patterns of co-occurrences
in the literature. To do so, a quantitative cytokine-disease or cell-disease matrix was
generated by obtaining, for each disease and cytokine/cell in the data, a count of the
number of records mapped to that disease and that cytokine/cell.

Using these matrices as input, hierarchical clustering was performed using (1-correlation)
as the distance measure.
Network analysis
Network analysis was carried out with the Cytoscape software. One network was created
using the information extracted from the Coronavirus (but not SARS) corpus; a second
network was created using data extract from the SARS corpus; and a third was created for
H5N1. Sub-networks were created by selecting nodes (primarily disease nodes) of interest
and then selecting first-degree neighbors. Node and edge attributes such as, node type,
node counts (of occurrences) and edge counts (of co-occurrences) were used for colouring,
sizing, and layout of the networks.

RESULTS

Using a previously published approach (Geifman et al 2015) associations between
cytokines, immune cell types, and diseases were captured from PubMed records related to
Coronavirus, SARS and H5N1 influenza. Differing patterns of associations were identified in
a corpus of over 9000 Coronavirus (excluding SARS) related abstracts and compared to
those obtained in a corpus of over 4000 SARS related abstracts, and a corpus of nearly
6000 H5N1 related abstracts.
Different cytokines and cell types are associated with Coronavirus, SARS and H5N1 influenza
In a comparison of the number of associations of cytokines and immune cells with
abstracts between the three corpuses, some interesting differences were identified (Figure
2 and Supplementary File 1). For example, Coronavirus is more highly associated with
Interferon-gamma than both SARS and H5N1; while Interferon-beta is less associated with
SARS-related abstracts than Coronavirus- or H5N1-related abstracts (Figure 2A). On the
other hand, SARS -related abstracts have a higher percentage of those linked to CXCL10
(interferon-γ inducible protein 10) and Interleukin (IL)-8 (Figure 2A). Other differences
between the three corpuses are found for different immune cells (Figure 2B).

Immune-related correlations between diseases associated with Coronavirus
Clustering of cytokine-disease co-occurrences in the literature has potentially identified
novel relationships between different diseases that are somehow related to Coronavirus.
For example, based on these patterns of cytokine associations, the common cold, asthma,
and status asthmaticus (a severe form of repetitive asthma attacks) were clustered
together (Figure 3). A second cluster included hypertension, nephritis, chorioretinitis and
uvetis, while a third interesting cluster included diabetes, hepatitis C and B, panuveitis,
pneumonia and pseudorabies. It should be noted however that there was a relatively small
number of cytokine-disease co-occurrences in this corpus (when compared for example, to
analysis of the entire PubMed database as in [11]).

of associations with different cytokines.

Immune interactions in comorbidities of Coronavirus, SARS and H5N1 influenza
Network analysis of the interactions between the different entities captured from PubMed
abstracts has identified some interesting and differing sub-networks and connections. For
example, in the network generated from the Coronavirus-related associations (Figure 4)
different links between cytokines and immune cells and comorbidities or symptoms
associated with Coronavirus can be seen. Where asthma and the common cold are directly
linked to Interferon-gamma (IFNg), IL-8, IL-2 and IL-5, diarrhea is linked to IL-18.
Differences in the types of cells included in each sub-network can also be seen. Similarly, in
the SARS-related network, we identify differing sub-networks each around a different
SARS-related comorbidity (Figure 5); as we did in the H5N1-related network (Figure 6).

DISCUSSION
In this work, we examined possible links of interest between cytokines, immune system
cells and diseases in the context of Coronavirus and related infections. By mining
information captured within biomedical publications, in the form of MeSH descriptors, and
their co-occurrences, we identified associations that may warrant further investigations.
As the literature on SARS-COV-2 develops our approach can be reapplied to identify the
strongest, direct links.
In examining the associations between cell types and cytokines, in PubMed abstracts linked
to Coronavirus (but not SARS) and those linked to SARS, we found some differences that
may point to aetiological differences between SARS-CoV and Coronaviruses more generally.
Coronavirus-related abstracts had a significantly higher percentage of associations with
Interferon-gamma, Interferon-beta, T-lymphocytes, and macrophages (Figure 2). On the
other hand, SARS-related abstracts had higher associations with C-X-C motif chemokine 10
(CXCL10), IL8, and alveolar macrophages; however, these were only marginally higher than

the number of associations found in the Coronavirus-related corpus. When comparing
these cytokine and cell occurrences to those in H5N1-related abstracts, some patterns are
similar to those observed in the Coronavirus-related abstracts; specifically, similar rates of
occurrences were observed for IFNb, TNFa, IL-18, and Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony
Stimulating Factor (GMCSF), in all cases these were higher than in the SARS-related
abstracts. On the other hand H5N1-related abstracts had similar rates of association for
monocytes, CD8-positive, and CD4-positive T-lymphocytes to those in SARS, in all cases,
lower than those in Coronavirus-related abstracts.
While we cannot rule out that these differences between the three corpuses are partially
due to noise, or random variance, it is likely that differences in research focus reflect an
underlying cause, and this may reflect biological or clinical differences. The clearest picture
of the key features of COVID-19 disease becomes apparent by a consideration of all
relevant publications and comparison to related diseases. Here we have shown this is
applicable immediately.
Hierarchical clustering of diseases linked to Coronavirus-related abstracts has also
identified some interesting groupings of diseases and symptoms associated with
Coronavirus infections. For example, the common cold, asthma, and status asthmaticus, are
all highly correlated based on their pattern of associations with cytokines within the
Coronavirus-related corpus (Figure 3). In a second example, hypertension, nephritis,
chorioretinitis and uveitis are all clustered together; and in a third example, diabetes,
hepatitis C and B, panuveitis, pseudorabies all cluster with pneumonia. These clusters may
suggest similar underlying immunological mechanisms in the context of coronaviruses.
In our third analysis, networks illustrating the connections between cytokines, immune cell
types and different diseases, captured from the three abstract corpuses, were generated.
Sub-networks, each stemming from a selected disease, illustrate some differences between
Coronavirus-, SARS-, and H5N1-related comorbidities and complications. For example, in
Coronavirus-related abstracts, diarrhea, one of the reported symptoms of COVID-19, is
associated with IL-18, monocytes, T-lymphocytes, dendritic cells and erythrocytes. On the
other hand, asthma, a risk factor for adverse outcomes in COVID-19, is linked to IL-8, IL-5,
IL-2, IFNg, eosinophils, and neutrophils. This analysis has highlighted some potential
targets for therapy. For example, IL-5 is a key growth factor for and activator of eosinophils
(both picked up by our research). Eosinophils can be recruited to the lungs, where they
have a poorly understood role in health and disease [19]. It has also been reported
eosinophil count is a potential marker for COVID-19 patient improvement [20, 21]. The role
of eosinophils and IL-5 in this disease certainly requires further investigation. Treatments
for asthma that modulate eospinophil action are available; Reslizumab and Mepolizumab
are anti-IL-5 antibody therapies that may have potential in treatment of viral respiratory
disease, if eosinophils are activated [22, 23]. It is speculative to comment on the role of
eosinophils in COVID-19 disease; however in overall consideration of a fast developing
literature in a pandemic many possible clinical trial options could be considered. As the
literature evolves we suggest the methodologies described here can play a progressive part
in rational development of strategies for optimal treatment in an informed environment.
Our approach to capturing immune-related associations from MeSH descriptors is not
without limitations. We first assume that co-occurrences of MeSH descriptors within a
PubMed record represent a true relationship or dependency; further, some of the
associations and co-occurrences were low (i.e. present in only few abstracts). However, our
previous investigation into the extent to which MeSH term co-occurrence captures real

association has found that at least 70% of co-occurrences of different types of entities
(disease, cell type, or cytokine) represent true direct or indirect dependencies, but it is
likely to be higher than that [11]. Additionally, patterns of MeSH co-occurrence have shown
to capture known medical associations, as well as identify potentially novel ones, thus
providing further confidence in the approach. A second limitation is a lack of directionality
and type for the associations captured by approach; nevertheless, we show that these mere
co-occurrences may still hold valuable information. Finally, since at the time of writing,
very few publications directly related to COVID-19 are available, our data mining has had
to focus on Coronavirus- and other related lung-damaging diseases as a proxy for COVID19. Nevertheless, we have created a paradigm for such research which is easy to use and
apply, and demonstrated its utility.

CONCLUSION

Herein, we have identified possible links between immune-related patterns, related comorbidities, complications and symptoms in the context of Coronavirus and related
infections. These associations may have direct implications for COVID-19 and can help
focus on potentially useful avenues of future research to understanding of the immune
mechanisms underlying COVID-19 and related complications.
