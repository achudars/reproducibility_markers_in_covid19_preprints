Abstract:
Objectives. To investigate self-reported discrimination and concern for physical assault due to
the COVID-19 pandemic among disaggregated Asian subgroups in the US.
Methods. We conducted a nationwide survey to assess self-reported discrimination and concern
for physical assault due to COVID-19 across racial/ethnic groups, including diverse subgroups of
Asians.
Results. Chinese respondents experienced the largest change (15% increase) in proportion of
respondents reporting discrimination from 2019 to 2020 (P<.01). Chinese, Korean, Japanese,
Vietnamese, and Other API showed up to 3.9 times increased odds of self-reported racial/ethnic
discrimination due to COVID-19 and, with the addition of Filipino, experienced up to 5.4 times
increased odds of concern for physical assault due to COVID-19 compared to Whites.
Conclusions. Our study is the first to examine self-reported discrimination and concern for
physical assault due to COVID-19 in subgroups of Asian Americans, finding that East (Chinese,
Korean, Japanese) and Southeast (Vietnamese, Filipino) Asian Americans have been
disproportionately affected. Future studies should disaggregate Asian subgroups to fully
understand experiences of discrimination in diverse populations in the US.

INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic has polarized America and reports of discrimination have increased in
many racial groups.1–3 Notably, public figures and the media have promoted racist rhetoric
implicating Chinese in the pandemic, coining terms such as the “Chinese virus” or “Kung Flu.”4,5
Several sources have reported that the popularization of these views has resulted in increased
racist and xenophobic discrimination.6–8 Many incidents have targeted not only people of
Chinese descent but also the broader population of people of any Asian descent.9 During the
pandemic from March 19 to August 5, 2020, one advocacy center, STOP AAPI HATE, received
reports of over 2,583 incidents of discrimination ranging from verbal harassment to physical
assault against Asian Americans across the United States.6 Other experiences of Asians during
the pandemic have included vandalization, being refused service, and decreased patronization of
Asian-owned businesses at the start of the pandemic.6,9,10
Despite the increase in anti-Asian discriminatory incidents, few studies have examined the
prevalence and effects of these experiences on Asian Americans. A recent study found that since
the outbreak, Asians are twice as likely to experience discrimination compared to Whites, which
was associated with significant mental distress.11 Asians are also shown to be more likely to
report adverse experiences due to their race or ethnicity, with three in ten Asian adults being
subjected to racial slurs or jokes.2 However, these studies were conducted on small Asian
American sample sizes (278 and 119 respectively) and aggregated Asian American and Pacific
Islander ethnic subgroups. Given the heterogeneity of Asians in the United States, disaggregating
this data is vital to unmask the effects of discrimination on Asian American subgroups and
address racial injustice in diverse populations as a matter of public health.12
We conducted a nationwide survey to understand the prevalence and severity of self-reported
racial/ethnic discrimination due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States across
disaggregated Asian subgroups, Whites, Hispanics/Latinos, and Blacks. We specifically assessed
self-reported race/ethnicity, participant place of birth, mental distress, self-reported
discrimination and concern for physical assault due to COVID-19. To our knowledge, this study
is the largest survey to assess the impact of COVID-19 discrimination on disaggregated Asian
subgroups in the United States.

METHODS
IRB: The study was considered exempt by Stanford University Institutional Review Board
(Protocol: 56235)
Funding: The study was funded by the Stanford Center for Asian Health Research and
Education.
Study design: We conducted a nationwide online survey on self-reported discrimination using
convenience sampling. The survey was distributed via Pollfish and email listservs for Asian
American organizations in order to achieve an oversampling of Asian Americans.

Main Measures:
Survey Development: Based on prior survey instruments11,13,14, we developed a survey matrix to
explore the major domains of discrimination, including being hassled or made to feel inferior,
physical violence, and mental distress specifically in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. The
survey questions were designed to include wording that had clear translations in Asian
languages. Translation was performed by Interpretation and Translation Services at Stanford
Health, and back translation was performed by an independent translator to ensure that exact
meaning was conveyed. An initial 20 item survey was pilot tested with Stanford Medicine
faculty and student interest groups. We revised the survey after feedback to 15 final items
(Supplemental Materials 1), including demographics (age, gender, educational level,
immigration status), ethnicity (White; Hispanic or Latino; Black; Asian American or Pacific
Islander: Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, Filipino, South Asian, Other API; Other),
change in behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic, self-reported discrimination overall (2019
and 2020), self-reported racial/ethnic discrimination due to COVID-19, physical assault due to
COVID-19 (concern and actual), and mental health (Patient Health Questionnaire-4).
We assessed self-reported discrimination as being “hassled or made to feel inferior because of
race or ethnicity.” To measure self-reported discrimination overall, Participants were asked
“Were you ever hassled or made to feel inferior because of your race or ethnicity for any
reason?” for both 2019 and 2020. Participants answered “yes”, “no”, or “unsure.” To measure
self-reported racial/ethnic discrimination due to COVID-19, participants were asked “Were you
ever hassled or made to feel inferior because of your race or ethnicity as related to the COVID19 disease?” Participants responded “yes”, “no”, or “unsure”.
To measure COVID-19 related physical assault, participants were asked, “In the year 2020, were
you ever physically assaulted due to your race or ethnicity as related to the COVID-19 disease?”.
To differentiate between actual incidents of assault and concern for COVID-19 related physical
assault, participants were asked, “In the year 2020, were you ever concerned about physical
assault due to your race or ethnicity as related to the COVID-19 disease?” Both questions
required participants to answer “yes”, “no”, or “unsure.”
The survey was implemented through Qualtrics (Provo, Utah) and Pollfish (New York City, New
York).
Participants: The survey was conducted in two phases, with the survey in the second phase
including an additional question on immigration status. In both phases, we recruited participants
via two simultaneous approaches: (1) Pollfish, a paid online survey platform with a pre-recruited
sample15 and (2) a Qualtrics survey link distributed via social media and email listservs identified
as serving Asian American groups. For the latter, an advertising flyer explained the study and
encouraged participants to respond to the survey with the provided link. The flyer and survey
were made available in multiple languages, including English, Chinese (Traditional), Chinese
(Simplified), Korean, Vietnamese, and Tagalog. Outreach for the first phase began on May 13th,
2020 and concluded on July 19th, 2020. The second phase of the survey, including the question
on immigration status, was distributed via the same approaches from July 20th, 2020 to August
12, 2020. After excluding 95 participants who did not answer all survey questions, a total of
1,861 responses were obtained over both phases, with 1,588 from Pollfish and 273 from

Qualtrics. Pollfish participants received a small non-cash incentive through the platform in
exchange for a completed survey15, whereas no incentive was provided for all other respondents
who completed the Qualtrics survey. Respondents came from 50 states and the District of
Columbia, with similar proportions of total state population from 2010 US Census.16
Analysis: Of 1861 respondents that completed the survey, 1,038 were from Phase 1 (1004
Pollfish and 34 Qualtrics) and 823 were from Phase 2 (584 Pollfish and 239 Qualtrics). After 44
participants who listed their race/ethnicity as “Other” were excluded, a total of 1817
questionnaires were analyzed. We categorized responses to discrimination and physical assault
measures as “yes” or “no” and “unsure,” and participants who answered “no” or “unsure” served
as the reference group for those who answered “yes.” Less than 9% of participants responded
“unsure” to each variable. We examined the difference in self-reported discrimination overall
before (2019) and during (2020) the pandemic across all ethnic groups, using chi-squared testing
for overall difference and pairwise comparisons across racial/ethnic groups. We then used
multivariate logistic regressions of self-reported racial/ethnic discrimination due to COVID-19
with the key predictor of race/ethnicity, using White as the reference group, and covariates
including age, gender, education level, geographic location, self-reported discrimination overall
in 2019, and survey phase. Similarly, a multivariable logistic model was used for physical assault
on the same set of covariates. To take into account multiple comparisons, we considered P<.01
as statistically significant, and reported 99% confidence intervals. Analyses were performed
using RStudio (Version 1.2.5001, Boston, MA).

RESULTS
Table 1 shows the demographic profile of our respondents based on race/ethnicity, age, gender,
education attainment, and immigration status. The Asian American and Pacific Islanders were
further stratified to Chinese (25%), Korean (6%), Japanese (6%), Vietnamese (9%), Filipino
(14%), and South Asian (which includes Indian and Pakistani - 18%). Race/ethnicity was not
independent from age, gender, immigration, and education by chi-squared analysis, so these
demographic variables were adjusted for in subsequent multivariate models.
Among all respondents, Chinese respondents experienced the highest increase in self-reported
discrimination overall from 2019 to 2020 (15%, P<.01). The increases in Vietnamese (13%) and
Other API (9%) were larger than in White (7%), but these differences were not statistically
significant (Figure 1).
Vietnamese (58%), Chinese (51%) and Other API (43%) respondents had the highest proportion
of reported concern for physical assault due to COVID-19 compared to White respondents (all
P<.001). Filipino (32%) and Korean (41%) respondents also had a higher proportion of reported
concern for physical assault compared to White respondents (all P<.01). South Asian, Black and
Hispanic or Latino respondents did not differ from White in the proportion of concern for
physical assault (Supplemental Figure 1).
Of Asian American subgroups, Vietnamese were most likely (46%) to self-report racial/ethnic
discrimination due to COVID-19, followed by Koreans (43%), and South Asians were least

likely to report incidents of perceived discrimination (12%). The proportion of self-reported
racial/ethnic discrimination due to COVID-19 was the highest for Vietnamese, followed by
Korean, Chinese, and Other API, all of which were greater than White (all P<.01). The
proportion of reported incidents of perceived discrimination did not significantly differ in
Japanese, Filipino, South Asian, Black, and Hispanic respondents compared to White
respondents (Supplemental Figure 1).
After adjusting for age, gender, education, prior discrimination experience, and the survey
distribution phase, Chinese (AOR=3.5, 99% CI=1.9, 6.5), Korean (AOR=3.8, 99% CI=1.7, 8.4),
Japanese (AOR=3.1, 99% CI=1.3, 7.5), Vietnamese (AOR=3.9, 99% CI=1.9, 8.0), and Other
API (AOR=2.7, 99% CI=1.5, 5.0) respondents were more likely to self-report racial/ethnic
discrimination due to COVID-19 compared to White respondents, but South Asian and Filipino
respondents did not differ from White respondents in likelihood of experiencing discrimination
(Figure 2).
The results for concern for physical assault due to race/ethnicity related to the COVID-19
pandemic were similar to those of self-reported racial/ethnic discrimination due to COVID-19,
such that Chinese (AOR=4.4, 99% CI=2.6, 7.7), Vietnamese (AOR=5.4, 99% CI=2.8, 10.6),
Japanese (AOR=2.3, 99% CI=1.0, 5.3) and Other API (AOR=2.4, 99% CI=1.4, 4.3) respondents
were more likely to experience this concern than White respondents. Additionally, Filipino
(AOR=2.2, 99% CI=1.2, 4.1) respondents were also more likely to report concern for physical
assault due to race/ethnicity related to COVID-19 than White respondents (Figure 3). In addition
to race/ethnicity, age and prior experience of discrimination were associated with increased odds
of both self-reported racial/ethnic discrimination due to COVID-19 and concern for physical
assault due to COVID-19 (Supplemental Table 1). Mental distress, as measured by PHQ-4, was
not higher in Asian Americans compared to Whites, despite higher self-reported racial/ethnic
discrimination in Asian Americans.

DISCUSSION
The current study sought to examine self-reported discrimination in Asian American subgroups
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings show that Chinese Americans have experienced a
significant increase in overall racial/ethnic self-reported discrimination from before (2019) to
during (2020) the pandemic. Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Other API
subgroups have been adversely affected by pandemic, as measured by concern for physical
assault and self-reported racial/ethnic discrimination due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in
comparison to Whites. Our findings are the first to oversample Asian Americans, disaggregate
Asian subgroups, and provide a national cross section of perceived discrimination, giving insight
into the domains of discrimination faced especially by East (Chinese, Korean, Japanese) and
Southeast (Vietnamese, Filipino) Asians during the pandemic.
Our findings reveal that Asian Americans have been adversely affected by the COVID-19
pandemic, supporting the findings of previous studies and anecdotal evidence of anti-Asian
violence, assault and discriminatory attitudes towards these groups.2,3,6,9,11 However, certain
Asian American subgroups experienced higher self-reported racial/ethnic discrimination due to

COVID-19 (up to 3.9 times higher in Vietnamese Americans) compared with Whites, suggesting
that the issue may be more severe than previous findings that Asian Americans as a group were 2
times more likely to experience COVID-19 associated discrimination during April 2020.11
Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Other API groups in the current study all
experienced increased self-reported racial/ethnic discrimination due to COVID-19 than the rates
previously reported for Asian Americans overall.11 Additionally, while the current study found
that certain Asian American subgroups reported high concerns for physical assault (up to 46% in
Vietnamese Americans), previous studies have found that only 26% of Asian Americans overall
feared someone might threaten or physically attack them.2 These prior studies2,11 did not
disaggregate by Asian ethnic subgroups, masking any possible differences in experiences
between them. Additionally, their small sample size of 119 and 278 Asian respondents,
respectively, compared to the current sample of 1325 Asian American respondents could have
contributed to these observed differences in effect size between studies.
The current study found that during the pandemic, East Asians, including Chinese, Korean, and
Japanese, have frequently been targeted in discriminatory incidents and have expressed high
levels of concern for physical assault, which can be rationalized due to the fact that these groups
share more facial and physical similarities with Chinese17, who have been linked to the
coronavirus outbreak. Southeast Asians in our study (Vietnamese, Filipino) were also more
likely to experience discrimination and express concern for physical assault, while South Asians
did not differ significantly in their responses compared to Whites. The disparities in prevalence
and magnitude of these experiences among different Asian American ethnic subgroups, would be
expected given the heterogeneous socioeconomic and cultural characteristics and history of
discrimination among Asian Americans.18–20 The differences among Asian American subgroups
in this study illustrates the need for better approaches to studying Asian American populations
throughout research, such as disaggregation of data on Asian Americans, especially in studies
focusing on the diverse Asian American population in the US.12,21,22 Future studies should further
explore this approach in order to assess the impact of the pandemic on the Asian American
population.
Chinese Americans have faced increased anti-Asian xenophobia and racism because of the
association of China with COVID-19.8,23 The proportion of Chinese Americans experiencing any
type of discrimination has increased by over 50% over the course of the pandemic. While other
Asian American groups (Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Filipino, South Asian, Other API) did
report changes in discrimination from before (2019) to during (2020) the pandemic, these
increases were not statistically significant, which could be attributed to the higher baseline
discrimination (2019) faced by some of these groups (Korean, Vietnamese, Other API) compared
to Chinese Americans.
After adjusting for age, gender, education, prior discrimination experience, and the survey
distribution phase, Vietnamese Americans were more than 3 times more likely to experience
self-reported racial/ethnic discrimination due to COVID-19 and 5 times more likely to be
concerned about physical assault than Whites, the highest likelihood seen amongst all Asian
American subgroups in the current study. This contrasts previous findings that Vietnamese are
less likely to perceive discrimination than Chinese and Korean Americans.18 Given historical
conflicts and the recent increase in tension between the nations of Vietnam and China over the

South China Sea24,25, one possible reason for this observation is that Vietnamese respondents
may have been especially angered by being associated with China, which has been blamed for
the coronavirus, and having to bear the same burden of discrimination as Chinese Americans.
Future qualitative work in Vietnamese Americans may be necessary to fully contextualize these
early findings.
While the current study presented robust evidence for the experiences of Asian Americans
related to COVID-19, several limitations should be considered in the interpretation of these
findings. Firstly, our use of a novel measurement of self-reported racial/ethnic discrimination due
to COVID-19 has not been validated. The survey, which was advertised and administered via
online platforms including email listservs, social media, and Pollfish, limited our sample to
technologically literate populations, leading to a lack of older respondents (Table 1) and
relatively few respondents with limited English proficiency, despite the fact that alternative
language surveys were offered. Additionally, given the cross-sectional, retrospective, and survey
nature of our current study, selection, recall, and social desirability biases may have all played a
role in overrepresenting or underrepresenting participants experiencing discrimination. There is
no evidence to suggest that these biases are differential by race/ethnicity, though these
racial/ethnic comparisons should be viewed with these caveats in mind. While this is the largest
sample of COVID-19 discrimination survey data in Asian Americans published to date, each
Asian subgroup displayed a relatively small sample size. Future studies should strive to
disaggregate Asian subgroups and achieve higher sample sizes to further explore trends that were
observed in our study. There are also numerous factors not controlled for in this study that could
have contributed to participant self-reported discrimination, including exposure to social media
and differences in shelter-in-place orders across regions.11,26
While the current study did not show an increase in mental distress associated with self-reported
racial/ethnic discrimination due to COVID-19 among Asian subgroups, previous studies have
shown that Asians are less likely to report anxiety and depression because of stigma attached to
mental disorders.27–29 Despite the fact that an increase in anxiety and depression was not shown
in this study, future studies should further explore the possible implications of COVID-19
discrimination on health and wellness using instruments that are sensitive in Asian populations.30
The findings of this study illustrate the differences in discrimination experienced across diverse
Asian American communities. This study confirms anecdotal evidence and builds on prior
studies on Asian Americans as a group that have explored discrimination.2,9,11 Our study suggests
that the anti-Chinese sentiment5,23,31 related to the COVID-19 pandemic has affected not only
Chinese Americans, but also a wide range of other Asian Americans including East Asians
(Japanese, Korean) and Southeast Asians (Vietnamese, Filipino). Including less affected groups
(South Asians) in aggregate with these more affected groups may underestimate overall
estimates of COVID-19 related discrimination among Asian Americans as a group. Compounded
with the social and health challenges that the pandemic has brought upon all Americans,26 this
surge in harmful xenophobia and racism towards Asian American populations related to the
COVID-19 pandemic represents a major public health issue in the United States requiring further
study and intervention efforts.
