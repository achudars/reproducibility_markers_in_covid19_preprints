Abstract
Background: Males are at a higher risk of dying from COVID-19. Older age and cardiovascular
disease are also associated with COVID-19 mortality. We compared the male-to-female (sex)
ratios in mortality by age for COVID-19 with cardiovascular mortality and cancer mortality in
the general population.
Methods: We obtained data from official government sources in the US and five European
countries: Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. We analyzed COVID-19 deaths
by sex and age in these countries and similarly analyzed their deaths from cardiovascular disease
(coronary heart disease or stroke) and cancer, the two leading age-related causes of death in
middle-to-high income countries.
Findings: In both the US and European countries, the sex ratio of deaths from COVID-19
exceeded one throughout adult life. The sex ratio increased up to a peak in midlife, and then
declined markedly in later life. This pattern was also observed for the sex ratio of deaths from
cardiovascular disease, but not cancer, in the general populations of the US and European
countries.
Interpretation: The sex ratios of deaths from COVID-19 and from cardiovascular disease exhibit
similar patterns across the adult life course. The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood,
but could stem partially from sex-related biological differences that underlie the similar pattern
for cardiovascular disease. These include, we propose, comparatively longer telomeres in
females, ovarian hormones, and X chromosome mosaicism.
Funding: The authors received no specific funding for this work.

Research in Context
Evidence before this study
Mortality from COVID-19 is higher in males and older persons. We searched PubMed.gov in
June 2020, with no date restrictions, for articles published in English using the search terms
“COVID-19”, “deaths”, “mortality”, “sex”, “male”, “female”, “age”, “disaggregated”, “ratio”,
and “stratified”. We identified studies in several countries that stratified COVID-19 mortality
data by age or by sex, but no study examined male-to-female (sex) ratios by age at a multinational level.

Added value of this study
To our knowledge, this is the first study to aggregate data on COVID-19 deaths at a multinational level, and analyze how the sex ratio in deaths varies by age, taking into account the
population at risk in each sex/age stratum. We found a distinctive pattern in sex ratio of deaths
by age, illuminating the nature of the sex effect on death from COVID-19. Moreover, we found a
similar pattern in sex ratio of deaths by age for cardiovascular disease, which is strongly
associated with increased risk of dying from COVID-19. We did not find a similar age pattern
for the sex ratio in deaths by cancer.

Implications of all the available evidence
The sex ratio in deaths from COVID-19 peaks in middle age and decreases at older ages, a
pattern mirrored in deaths from cardiovascular disease. This intriguing similarity warrants
research about whether sex-based differences in mortality from COVID-19 and from
cardiovascular disease in general are partly due to common biological causes.

Introduction
More males than females die from COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2
virus1. This was first observed in China, where 64% of COVID-19 deaths occurred in males1. As
the epidemic spread worldwide, other countries similarly observed a higher percentage of deaths
from COVID-19 occurring in males1. The higher number of deaths among males is consistent
with mortality patterns observed in several major viral epidemics/pandemics of the 20th and 21st
centuries, including the Western African Ebola virus epidemic (2013-2016)2 and the H1N1
Spanish Flu pandemic of 19183. Adult men also have an overall higher mortality rate than adult
women from seasonal influenza based on an analysis of data in the US between 1997-2007, with
some variation depending on age group and underlying conditions4.
In contrast, COVID mortality by age differs from other viral pandemics. More than 80%
of COVID-19 deaths in the US and European countries have occurred in individuals older than
65 years5, with very few deaths in young children6. Seasonal influenza causes relatively more
pediatric deaths, especially in infants under the age of six months7, in addition to a
disproportionate number of deaths in individuals over the age of 65 years8. Several major viral
pandemics of the 20th and 21st centuries have also shown different age-based mortality patterns
from COVID-19. For instance, in the Spanish Flu of 1918 a large proportion of deaths were in
young adults9, and in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic a large proportion occurred in children
and non-elderly adults10. Therefore, COVID-19 mortality trends are consistent with sex-based,
but not with age-based patterns seen in many other viral pandemics.
In searching for explanations for the distinctive pattern of deaths in COVID-19, we first
examined variation by age group in the male-to-female (sex) ratio of mortality in data from the

US and five European countries. Given that cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been strongly
associated with increased risk of mortality in COVID-1911, we next examined variation in the
sex ratio of CVD mortality by age group in the same countries. As CVD and cancer are the two
major age-related disease categories that largely determine survival of adults in middle-and-high
income societies, we further examined variation by age in the sex ratio of cancer mortality. Here
we report our findings and offer potential explanations regarding their meaning.

Methods
We focused our analysis on the US, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the Netherlands
because of (a) availability of their sex- and age-disaggregated mortality data from COVID-19,
(b) data stratification into age group bins of 10 years or less, and (c) a high number of cumulative
deaths from COVID-19 (sources are shown in Supplementary Table 1). COVID-19 mortality
data were retrieved from national databases including the US Centers for Disease Control, the
Italian National Institute of Health, the French Institute for Demographic Studies, the Spanish
Ministry of Health, the German Federal Ministry of Health, and the Dutch Ministry for Health,
Welfare and Sport. The data were retrieved on June 18th, 2020 and reflect the cumulative
COVID-19 deaths in each country from the beginning of the pandemic up to dates between May
29th – June 17th 2020 (see Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2 for details). In the
US, data were included for age groups 25 years and older, and stratified into 10-year bins. For
the European Countries, data were included for age groups 30 years and above and stratified into
10-year bins, and deaths were combined across the five countries by age group and sex. Age
groups with less than 200 total deaths were excluded from the analysis. The population at risk in

each age group was retrieved from populationpyramid.net, a website that aggregates data from
the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division.
For the analysis of mortality from CVD and cancer, data were extracted from the World
Health Organization Mortality Database (https://www.who.int/healthinfo/mortality_data/en/),
which collects national data on deaths from civil registries. The Database contains number of
deaths by country, year, sex, age group and cause of death, and population size by country, year,
sex and age group. The causes of death are categorized by International Classification of Disease
(ICD)-10 codes. CVD deaths principally included deaths from coronary heart disease (ICD-10
codes I20-I25) or stroke (I60-I69)12. Cancer death data included deaths from all neoplasms (C00C97, D00-D48) (Supplementary Table 3). Data was extracted for France (2014), Germany
(2015), Italy (2015), Netherlands (2016), Spain (2015), and the US (2015), with the year of the
most recent data available indicated in parentheses (Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary
Table 5). Population adjustment was done using population data from the same years as the
mortality data. These population data were also extracted from the World Health Organization
Mortality Database.
Plots and data visualizations were created using the ggplot2 package in R
(https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org).

Results
ry
Stratified by age, and adjusted for population at risk in each age group (Supplementary
Figure 1, Supplementary Table 2), the sex ratios for COVID-19 deaths among adults in the US
S
and five European countries (Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the Netherlands) showed
ed
similar overall patterns, initially rising to a peak in midlife and then falling (Figure 1).
Specifically, the sex ratio of mortality peaked between the ages of 35-44 years in the US and 60-69 years in the European countries, and then progressively declined at older ages without
ut
dropping below one.

We next examined the sex ratio of CVD mortality by age in these countries (Figure 2).
The sex ratio for CVD mortality initially rose to a peak in midlife and then declined, in both the
US and Europe. For ages younger than 70 years, the sex ratio for CVD mortality in Europe was
higher than in the US.

As cancer is the other leading cause of adult mortality in the US and Europe13, we also
examined the sex ratio for cancer mortality by age (Figure 3). The sex ratio for cancer mortality

increased after midlife with no evidence of decline thereafter.

When the sex ratios of mortality by age for COVID-19, CVD and cancer were overlaid,

the COVID-19 profile mirrored that of CVD, although, the ratio for CVD was much higher in
Europe than the US for ages younger than 70 years (Figure 4). The profile of the sex mortality

ratio by age for cancer, however, clearly differed from the ratios for COVID-19 and for CVD.

Discussion

General Considerations
as
Our key findings are as follows: (i) for all age groups, the death rate from COVID-19 was
higher in males than females; (ii) the sex ratio rose to a peak in midlife and then narrowed with
ith
increasing age; and (iii) the sex mortality ratio for COVID-19 by age mirrored that for CVD but
ut
not cancer mortality. Since the COVID-19 data were not linked to population databases with
ith
individual-level health information, we could not specifically examine the potential contribution
on
of CVD to the age pattern of the sex mortality ratio from COVID-19. We propose, nonetheless,

based on data displayed in Figure 4 that the sex ratio for COVID-19 mortality, particularly for
persons older than 60 years, might partially reflect the same underlying mechanisms that drive
the age pattern of the sex mortality ratio for CVD in the general population.
What then might be the mechanisms explaining the similar age patterning of the sex ratio for
mortality in COVID-19 and in CVD? The underlying biological reasons are likely multifactorial
and complex. We review several potential explanations: telomeres, ovarian hormones, and X
chromosome mosaicism.

Telomeres
Single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with leukocyte telomere length have been used
as instrumental variables in Mendelian randomization studies to infer a causal role of short
telomeres in CVD and long telomeres in major cancers14. Older persons with short leukocyte
telomere length show a higher risk of dying from CVD15, and a recent paper proposed that short
telomere length might be a common denominator that partially explains increased mortality from
COVID-19 of older persons, males and individuals with CVD16. Telomeres are longer in females
than males from birth onwards17,18, a finding that might contribute to the skewed sex ratio in
mortality from COVID-19 and CVD not only in older persons but also throughout the adult life
course.

Ovarian hormones
Endogenous estrogens have been associated with a protective effect against CVD in
premenopausal women19, while predisposing women to certain cancers20. Higher estrogen21 and
progesterone22 levels in premenopausal women might also modulate immune responses and

attenuate the severity of COVID-19. In this regard, data from the US show a decline in the sex
ratio of COVID-19 mortality after ages 45-54 years, which coincides with the average age that
women undergo menopause23. However, the data from the European countries suggest otherwise,
with the drop in the sex ratio of COVID-19 mortality starting in the 70-79-year age group; well
beyond the average age of menopause. Clinical trials are currently investigating whether
estrogen or progesterone treatment can alleviate COVID-19 symptoms, which may provide
clarity to the role of ovarian hormones in COVID-19 pathogenesis (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers
NCT04359329, NCT04365127).

X chromosome mosaicism
The two X chromosomes provide an advantage related to X-linked recessive diseases and
other deleterious mutations on the X chromosome. Random inactivation in utero of one X
chromosome in each somatic cell engenders mosaicism that provides females with somatic cell
diversity and the potential for selection of cells with an X chromosome harboring advantageous
variant genes24. X chromosome mosaicism might be particularly advantageous for surviving
infectious disease, since the X chromosome encodes a number of genes engaged in immune
function – therefore having two copies of these genes confers additional immunological diversity
in women25. In addition, the X chromosome harbors ACE2, the gene encoding angiotensinconverting enzyme 2, the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-226. ACE2 variants might play a role
in left ventricular hypertrophy that is often the outcome of hypertension27, a comorbidity that
tracks with age28. Some of these variants might also influence CVD in general29, the severity of
COVID-1926, or interact with other genes and environmental factors that influence mortality
from both diseases.

Limitations
Limitations to this study include: (a) potential differences in reporting COVID-19 deaths
between the countries analyzed; (b) the lack of linked individual-level health and social
databases; and (c) no information on the sex ratio of survival rates among people who acquired
COVID-19. The latter would require, at a minimum, COVID-19 infection rates by age and sex in
the general population (including asymptomatic infections) in order to determine whether there
are sex- and age-based differences in survival from it.
Additionally, the study does not account for some anomalies in the overall similar patterns
for COVID-19 and CVD in the United States versus Europe. The peak sex ratio for COVID-19
occurs at an earlier age in the United States than Europe, and the sex ratio for CVD mortality is
higher for Europe than the United States until the older age groups. Finally, we could not rule
out that finding the lowest sex ratios in COVID-19 and CVD for the oldest age groups was partly
due to selection by survival in that males who survive to an exceptionally old age are “escapers”
who hardly represent the general population of older males, whereas females who survive to
such an old age might be “delayers” who largely represent the general population of older
females30.

Conclusions
Our analyses show similar trends in the sex ratio by age of mortality from COVID-19 and
from CVD. We propose that these findings might be due to some shared underlying biological
mechanisms. Individual-level data are essential to examine potential shared mechanisms and to
establish the potential contribution of CVD to the age patterning of the sex ratio of mortality in
