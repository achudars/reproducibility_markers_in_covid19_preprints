Abstract
Introduction
The study objective was to determine the breakthrough infection rate of Covid-19 (SARSCoV-2) infection in those vaccinated with either BBV152 or AZD1222 (ChAdOx1-S)
vaccine among healthcare workers (HCWs).
Methods
A cross-sectional analysis was conducted a medical college and hospital complex in Delhi,
India through telephonic interviews among HCWs who had received at-least one dose of a
Covid-19 vaccine during January to March’ 2021. Breakthrough infections were
operationally defined as occurrence of Covid-19 infection ≥14 days after administration of
two doses of either Covid-19 vaccine.
Results
We enrolled 325 HCWs with mean (SD) age of 29.1 (9.9) years including 211 (64.9%)
males. Two seventy nine (85.8%) HCWs were fully vaccinated while 46 (14.2%) were
partially vaccinated. There were 168 (51.7%) BBV152 and 157 (48.3%) AZD1222
(ChAdOx1-S) recipients.
A total of 37 (11.3%, 95% C.I. 8.3, 15.3) breakthrough infections were observed in the
HCWs. The median (IQR) time until incidence of Covid-19 breakthrough infection since
receiving second dose of either Covid-19 vaccine was 47 (28.5, 55) days. Additionally, 20
(6.1%) non-breakthrough Covid-19 infections were recorded in the HCWs post vaccination
with either a single dose of a Covid-19 vaccine or both doses but prior to a period of 14 days
since administration of the second dose.
Most breakthrough infection cases (94.4%) were mild and did not require supplemental
oxygen therapy. HCWs without a history of natural Covid-19 infection and recovery prior to
vaccination were 3.8 times more at risk to contract a Covid-19 infection or reinfection in spite
of vaccination with at-least one dose of either Covid-19 vaccine.
Conclusion
Nearly one in nine HCWs experienced a Covid-19 breakthrough infection in the present
study.

Introduction
Vaccines are considered the mainstay in halting and ending the Covid-19 pandemic which
has caused over 172 million cases and 3.7 million deaths worldwide till date [1]. India
launched the world’s largest Covid-19 mass vaccination campaign from January’ 2021 in a
phased manner beginning with healthcare, sanitation and essential frontline workers,
followed by the geriatric population, people with comorbidities, those aged > 45 years and
finally the entire adult population [2].
The vaccines approved and deployed in India by the regulatory authority included AZD1222
- ChAdOx1-S (Covishield), manufactured in India by Serum Institute of India through license
from Astrazeneca-Oxford [3] and BBV152 (Covaxin), indigenous vaccine developed by
Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) [4].
The AZD122 (ChAdOx1-S/nCoV-19) recombinant vaccine against Covid-19 is a replicationdeficient adenoviral vector vaccine that expresses the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein gene [3].
BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine adjuvanted with Algel-IMDG to
induce T-helper-1 cell (Th1) responses [4]. The efficacy of AZD1222 (ChAdOx1-S) after
administration of two doses of the vaccines irrespective of interval between the doses has
been reported as 63.1%, with possibly higher efficacy on longer intervals [3]. The interim
phase-3 clinical trial data reported BBV152 to have efficacy of 78% against infection with
SARS-CoV-2 [5]. However, the real-world effectiveness of vaccines may differ from the
efficacy reported in clinical trials due to a multitude of factors including the dynamics of
disease exposure, diminished antibody response in sub-groups like the elderly and the
immunocompromised, and the emergence of newer mutant strains with greater infectivity and
virulence [6, 7].
A small proportion of individuals will contract Covid-19 despite complete vaccination as no
vaccine accords 100% protection against the disease, and occasionally newer virus variants
evolve mechanisms for bypassing the vaccine induced antibody response. Breakthrough
infections with reference to Covid-19 refers to the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in
individuals who have already been partially or completely vaccinated with any authorized
Covid-19 vaccine [8].
According to the ICMR between 0.02 and 0.04% infections have occurred after partial or
complete vaccination with either BBV152 or AZD1222 (ChAdOx1-S) [9]. However,
healthcare workers (HCWs) represent a very high-risk group for contracting COVID-19 due

to sustained occupational exposure to the virus [10, 11], and the breakthrough infection rate
assessed in this cohort would provide crucial evidence in understanding the effectiveness of
vaccination in preventing symptomatic disease and disease transmission.
The study objective was therefore to determine the breakthrough infection rate of Covid-19
(SARS-CoV-2) infection in those vaccinated with either BBV152 or AZD1222 (ChAdOx1-S)
vaccine among healthcare workers.
Methods
Study design and setting: We conducted a cross-sectional study among healthcare workers of
the Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi most of whom provide services at the largest
dedicated tertiary care Covid-19 hospital in Delhi. As per the government of India policy, two
doses of either BBV152 (Covaxin) or AZD1222 (Covishield) vaccine at-least 4 weeks apart
were available for administration to all HCWs since January 2021 with no mixing of doses
allowed.
The primary outcome of the study was the proportion of breakthrough infection in HCWs
which was defined as any Covid-19 infection occurring ≥14 days after receiving both the
doses of either of the vaccine(s). The secondary outcome was the proportion of nonbreakthrough Covid-19 infections that occurred post vaccination with either a single dose of a
Covid-19 vaccine or both doses but prior to a period of 14 days since administration of the
second dose.
The independent variables included age, sex, time since vaccination, vaccine type, adherence
to non-pharmaceutical measures post-vaccination and previous history of natural Covid-19
infection and recovery prior to vaccination.
The sample size was calculated considering the prevalence of breakthrough infection among
HCWs in India as 13.3% as reported in a study from a chronic care facility in Delhi [12], at
95% confidence level, 4% precision, and 10% non-response. The minimum sample size was
estimated as 270.
The data was collected during a period of 7 days from May 31 to June 6 through telephonic
interviews conducted by multiple trained investigators using the following sources in a
consecutive order: (i). Registration records of all the healthcare workers vaccinated at the
Covaxin administration site within the college campus during February-March 2021 (ii).

(F.1/IEC/MAMC/(84/02/2021/No338). Verbal consent was obtained from the HCWs who
responded to the telephonic interviews prior to the initiation of the survey.
Results
We enrolled 325 healthcare workers including 258 medical doctors and interns (79.4%), 52
(16%) frontline health workers, 12 (3.7%) lab technicians and 3 (0.9%) nurses. The mean
(SD) age of the participants was 29.1 (9.9) years including 212 (65%) males and 114 (35%)
females. Two hundred eighty (90.9%) HCWs were fully vaccinated with two doses while 46
(14.1%) had received only one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine at the time of interview. There
were 168 (51.7%) BBV152 recipients and 157 (48.3%) AZD1222 (ChAdOx1-S) recipients.
Fifty (15.4%) HCWs reported a past history of natural Covid-19 infection and recovery prior
to receiving the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine with 47 (94.1%) being mild cases and 3
(5.9%) being moderate cases needing supplemental oxygen therapy.
A total of 57 (17.5%, 95% C.I 13.8, 22.0) Covid-19 infections comprising 37 breakthrough
and 20 non-breakthrough infections were observed in the HCWs vaccinated with at-least one
dose of Covid-19 vaccine. The infections were diagnosed with RT-PCR, Ag test, and on
clinical suspicion in 48 (84.2%), 3 (5.2%), and 6 (10.5%) cases, respectively. The severity of
Covid-19 infections were mild requiring only home isolation in 51 (89.4%) cases while 6
(10.6%) were moderate cases needing supplemental oxygen therapy. Within the households
of HCWs suffering Covid-19 infection post-vaccination with at-least one dose of either
Covid-19 vaccine, all members were diagnosed concurrently with Covid-19 in 9 (15.8%)
cases while at-least one member was infected in 24 (42.1%) cases.

A total of 37 (11.3%, 95% C.I. 8.3, 15.3) breakthrough infections were observed in the
HCWs of which 32 (86.5%), 3 (8.1%) and 2 (5.4%) cases were diagnosed with RT-PCR, Ag
test and on the basis of clinical symptoms, respectively. The median (IQR) time until
incidence of Covid-19 breakthrough infection after receiving the second dose of either Covid19 vaccine was 47 (28.5, 55) days.
Among the HCWs experiencing a breakthrough infection, 35 (94.6%) were mild cases
managed through only home isolation while there were 2 (5.4%) moderate cases requiring
supplemental oxygen therapy prior to recovery. Within the households of HCWs reporting
the incidence of a Covid-19 breakthrough infection, concurrent infection in all members was
observed in 5 (13.5%) cases while at-least one member was infected in 14 (37.8%) cases.
Table 1 summarizes the Covid-19 infection rates in HCWs after administration of at-least a
single dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. HCWs without a history of natural Covid-19 infection
and recovery prior to vaccination compared to HCWs with such a history were 3.8 times
more at risk to contract a Covid-19 infection or reinfection despite vaccination with at-least
one dose of either Covid-19 vaccine (p=0.029).
The proportion of breakthrough infections did not show statistically significant variation
when compared across subgroups including type of vaccine, age, sex, adherence to nonpharmaceutical measures after vaccination, and history of a natural Covid-19 infection prior
to vaccination (Table 2).
Discussion
In this study, nearly, one in five HCWs reported the incidence of Covid-19 infection after
receiving at-least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine but prior to either complete vaccination or
before 14 days post administration of the second vaccine dose. Furthermore, one in nine
HCWs experienced a breakthrough infection after being administered both scheduled doses
of either Covid-19 vaccine. These findings suggest that in real world settings a significant
proportion of vaccinated individuals with high risk of exposure remain vulnerable to Covid19 infection albeit with reduced disease severity in most cases.
Vaccine seroconversion through robust anti-spike antibody response is likely to be induced
after a single dose of AZD1222 (ChAdOx1-S) compared to BBV152 wherein two doses are
usually required to stimulate adequate antibody levels [7]. However, in the present study,
although breakthrough and non-breakthrough infections were higher in the BBV152 group
compared to the AZD1222 group, the differences were not statistically significant.

Evidence from a previous study suggests that a single dose of either BBV152 or AZD1222
induced higher concentration of neutralizing IgG antibody in those having a history of natural
infection and recovery from COVID-19 [13]. Similarly, in this study, a history of a natural
infection and recovery from Covid-19 was observed to be protective against a subsequent
Covid-19 infection or reinfection in those HCWs who had been administered at-least a single
dose of Covid-19 vaccine.
The rates of breakthrough infection observed in the present study (11.3%) were slightly lower
than that observed during surveillance in a chronic care facility in Delhi, India (13.2%) where
HCWs received either AZD1222 (ChAdOx1-S) or BBV152 [12]. However, another study in
a large cohort of HCWs from a north Indian city vaccinated with AZD1222 (ChAdOx1-S)
reported the incidence of Covid-19 breakthrough infections to be only 1.6% (48 out of 3,000)
while 2.6% tested positive after receiving at-least one dose of the vaccine [14]. In contrast,
Hacisuleyman et al. report the incidence of breakthrough infection as just 0.5% in a cohort of
417 health care workers who had previously received two doses the BNT162b2 (Pfizer–
BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine [15].
The period of observation in this study coincided with a massive wave of the Covid-19
epidemic in Delhi during April and May 2021 which witnessed 0.737 million cases including
11,075 deaths [16]. Furthermore, the emergent evidence from genomic analysis also reveals
that the Covid-19 variants of concern, B.1.617.2 (Delta) and B.1.1.7 (Alpha) having ~50%
higher transmissibility were primarily responsible for the surge in cases during the same
period. These variants also constituted the predominant lineages found in the breakthrough
infections cases due to a probable immune escape mechanism that could occasionally bypass
the vaccine induced immunity [17]. Moreover, diminished neutralizing antibody activity and
limited protectiveness against the delta variant of the SARS-CoV-2 has been observed in
most of the currently available Covid-19 vaccines globally especially prior to complete
vaccination with both vaccine doses [18, 19].
The strengths of the study are that it was conducted in real-world settings with the period of
observation inclusive of the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in Delhi, India when health
systems were overwhelmed resulting in large scale viral exposure of HCWs providing either
outpatient or inpatient treatment services. However, there are certain study limitations. First,
since infection status of the HCWs was based on self-report in the absence of a mandatory
testing policy, mostly symptomatic breakthrough infections diagnosed with RT-PCR or the
6

Ag test were likely to be captured while asymptomatic infections also capable of viral
transmission were potentially omitted. Second, although, we observed high rates of
transmission in the household members of the HCWs, the vaccination status in the infected
household members was not recorded. Third, non-breakthrough infection rate could be
inflated since the HCWs at the time of administration of their first dose of vaccine may
already have been infected. Fourth, comorbidity status was not ascertained in the participants
although the likelihood of underlying morbidities in the HCWs was less considering their low
median age. Consequently, future studies should assess the extent of vaccine induced
antibody response and protection after vaccination with Covid-19 vaccines in patients with
diabetes, heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and older people at risk of reduced protection
in addition to pre-existing concerns causally linked with the occurrence of severe disease. A
final limitation is that the sample size was not adequately powered to detect statistically
significant differences between subgroups.
In conclusion, breakthrough infections represent a major public health challenge in ending
the Covid-19 pandemic. Robust surveillance through large-scale epidemiological studies to
identify the predictors of breakthrough infection among individuals at risk, and rapid
genomic analysis for early recognition of emerging variants of concern that have greater
capability of causing breakthrough infections warrant continued prioritization.
