ABSTRACT
Objectives
Governments worldwide have recommended unprecedented measures to mitigate the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As pressure mounts to scale back
these measures, understanding public compliance with and priorities for COVID-19
mitigation is critical. The main aim of this study was to assess public compliance with
and support for government-imposed stay-at-home orders in nations and cities with
different COVID-19 infection and death rates.
Design
In this cross-sectional study, questionnaires were administered to nationally
representative respondents from April 2-8, 2020.
Setting
Regions with different disease prevalence included two nations [the United States
(US—high) and Australia (AU—low)] and two cities [New York (NY—high) and Los
Angeles (LA—low)].
Participants
For adults 18 years or older residing in specified regions, eligible respondents were
empaneled until representative quotas were reached for age, gender, and either race
and ethnicity (US, NY, LA) or ancestry (AU), matching the 2010 US or 2016 AU census.
Of 8718 eligible potential respondents, 5573 (response rate, 63.9%) completed surveys
(US: 3010; NY: 507; LA: 525; AU: 1531). The median age was 47 years (range, 18-89);
3039 (54.5%) were female.

Exposure
The prevalence of COVID-19 in each region (cumulative infections, deaths) as of
April 8, 2020: US (458610, 15659), AU (5956, 45),1 NY (81803, 4571), LA (7530, 198).2
Main Outcomes Measures
Public compliance with and attitudes regarding government-imposed stay-at-home
orders were evaluated and compared between regions.
Results
Of 5573 total respondents, 4560 (81.8%) reported compliance with recommended
quarantine or stay-at-home policies (range of samples, 75.5%-88.2%). Despite
significant disruptions of social and work life, health, and behavior, 5022 respondents
(90.1%) supported government-imposed stay-at-home orders (range of samples,
88.9%-93.1%). Of these, 90.8% believe orders should last at least three more weeks or
until public health or government officials recommend, with such support spanning the
political spectrum.
Conclusions
Public compliance with stringent quarantine and stay-at-home policies was very high, in
both highly-affected (US, NY) and minimally-affected regions (AU, LA). Despite
extensive disruption of respondents’ lives, the vast majority supported continuation of
long-term government-imposed stay-at-home orders. These findings have important
implications for policymakers grappling with the decision as to when to lift restrictions.

Introduction
To date, more than 2,500,000 confirmed cases and 175,000 deaths have been
attributed to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.3 Absent
widespread testing or safe and efficacious treatments, isolation and quarantine have
been recommended worldwide for the first time in a century. Disease prevalence and
associated public health policies have varied across jurisdictions and changed over
time, largely without systematic assessment of public responses to the crisis or the
mitigation strategies.
Methods
Study Design and Recruitment
To evaluate public compliance with and support for recommended COVID-19 mitigation
strategies, we collected cross-sectional surveys of nationally representative
respondents using demographic quota sampling.4 Surveys were administered to an
online respondent panel by Qualtrics, LLC (Provo, Utah, and Seattle, Washington, US),
a commercial survey company with a network of participant pools consisting of
hundreds of suppliers. Recruitment methodologies include digital advertisements and
promotions, word of mouth and membership referrals, social networks, TV and radio
advertisements, and offline mail-based approaches.
Between April 2-8 2020 (a one-week period), samples were drawn from regions with
markedly different infection and death rates from COVID-19 (Table 1), including
nationwide samples in the United States (US, high incidence) and Australia (AU, low
incidence), and two citywide samples in the New York (NY, high incidence) and Los

Angeles (LA, low incidence) metropolitan areas.
Study Approval
The study protocol was approved by the Monash University Human Research Ethics
Committee (MUHREC) and conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines.
Respondents were informed of the study purposes and provided electronic consent
prior to commencement. Investigators received anonymized responses.
Population
Target numbers of respondent-completed surveys follows: US (3000), NY (500), LA
(500), AU (1500). To be eligible to participate, respondents were required to report
being aged 18 years or older with current residence in specified regions. Demographic
sampling quotas were implemented for age, gender, and either race and ethnicity (US,
NY, LA) or ancestry (AU), based on 2010 US and 2016 Australian census data.
Potential respondents likely to qualify based on demographic characteristics listed in
their Qualtrics panelist profile were targeted during recruitment; demographic questions
were included in the survey to confirm eligibility. Potential respondents received
invitations and could opt to participate by activating a survey link directing them to the
participant information and consent page preceding the survey. Ineligible respondents
who did not meet inclusion criteria (e.g., less than 18 years of age, not a resident of a
targeted region) or exceeded set quotas (i.e., maximum demographic characteristic
quota already met) were disempaneled from the survey.
Survey Instruments
The surveys contained 86 [United States (US), New York (NY), Los Angeles (LA)] or 85

[culturally adapted for Australia (AU)] items, with each item requiring a response, and
was designed to take approximately 15 minutes to complete. Respondents were
required to self-report demographic characteristics and respond to questions about
COVID-19 and mitigation strategies including compliance, priorities, sources of concern,
and comparisons of current lifestyle versus lifestyle between October and December
2019 (i.e., before COVID-19 and mitigation strategies). Additional health-related
questions were asked independent of COVID-19. When possible, brief validated
instruments were used, including the Short-Form Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI-01) for
insomnia risk assessment, Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) for anxiety and
depression risk assessment, the Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS-4) for perceived stress
assessment, and the Mini Z for burnout risk assessment.5-8 When required, validated
instruments were adapted, including the Horne and Östberg Morningness-Eveningness
Questionnaire (MEQ) for chronotype assessment, the μshort Munich ChronoType
Questionnaire (μMCTQ) for chronotype and sleep behavior assessment, Obstructive
Sleep Apnoea 50 (OSA50) for obstructive sleep apnea risk assessment, single-item
physical activity measure, and Hurt-Insult-Threaten-Scream (HITS) screening tool for
domestic violence.9-14
Quality Screening
To verify response quality, Qualtrics conducted standardized quality screening and data
scrubbing procedures. Techniques included algorithmic analysis for attention patterns,
click-through behavior, duplicate responses, keystroke analysis, machine responses,
and inattentiveness. Country-specific geolocation verification via IP address mapping
was used to ensure respondents were from the country specified in their response.

Respondents who failed an attention or speed check, along with any responses
identified by the data scrubbing algorithms, were excluded from the final sample.
Results
Between April 2 and April 8, 2020, respondents completed 5573 surveys (US: 3010;
NY: 507; LA: 525; AU: 1531) with a 63.9% response rate (Figure 1). Overall, 3039
(54.5%) were female; the median age of participants was 47 years (range, 18-89). See
Table 2 for respondent characteristics. Cross-sectional results of COVID-19-mitigation
compliance, public priorities, and life impact for each sample are reported by region
(Figure 2; Table 1). Altogether, 4560 respondents (81.8%) reported quarantining or
voluntarily self-isolating (range of samples, 75.5%-88.2%). Moreover, 5022 (90.1%)
believe a government-imposed stay-at-home order is warranted (range of samples,
88.9%-93.1%). Of these, 90.8% believe the order should last at least three more weeks
(9.1%), a month or longer (43.8%), or until public health (31.1%) or government officials
(6.8%) determine it is safe to lift the restrictions. Of 5304 respondents (95.2%) who
made predictions, the average predicted date by which COVID-19 would no longer
affect their daily lives was between mid-June and mid-August, though there was high
variability in predictions. Strong support for a government-imposed stay-at-home order
spanned the political spectrum (Table 1).
Overall, 4431 respondents (79.5%, range of samples, 77.5%-82.1%) reported moderate
to extreme concern about their own (61.9%) or others’ (75.5%) infection and 3974
(71.3%, range of samples, 69.8%-76.0%) about their own (43.4%) or others’ (68.7%)
death. Access to testing (59.3%), medical care for COVID-19 (64.5%), medical care for
pre-existing conditions due to hospital overload (59.2%), social or physical isolation

(58.1%), and sense of purpose (49.8%) were also sources of moderate to extreme
concern. Overall, 1217 respondents (21.8%) identified as high risk for severe COVID-19
infection. Across regions, nearly half (42.0%-45.3%) reported spending considerable
time (average, 23.2 hours per week) consuming information (media, government
reports, health officials, family) about COVID-19. NY had the highest percentage of
respondents who reported knowing someone who has tested positive for (27.0% vs.
5.6%-11.0%), been hospitalized for (14.6% vs. 2.4%-6.5%) or died from (9.5% vs.
0.7%-2.9%) COVID-19.
Consistent across regions, respondents reported that COVID-19 and mitigation
strategies have caused moderate to extreme disruption of social life (75.3%), family life
(41.0%), work/studies (43.5%), productivity (41.6%), physical activity (45.1%), sexual
activity (23.6%), and sleep patterns (39.3%). Overall, 1999 respondents (35.9%)
reported exercising less frequently, and 409 (7.4%) reported concerning weight gain.
Daily outdoor light exposure was reduced by 1 hour or more in 2279 respondents
(40.9%). The estimated percentage of virtual interactions (versus face-to-face)
increased from 14.6% to 66.1%, and 1786 respondents (32.0%) reported more than 1
hour increase in daily screen time.
Widespread concerns included the possibility of an economic recession and openendedness of COVID-19 and mitigation measures (79.2% and 72.2%, respectively). A
total of 3119 respondents (56.0%) reported feeling anxious or nervous, 2453 (44.0%)
depressed or hopeless, and 2511 (45.1%) unable to stop or control worrying at least
several days in the prior two weeks.

Discussion
Resounding compliance with and support for disruptive mitigation measures evidenced
in these nationally representative samples, despite belief by 91.4% of respondents that
they will never be infected with COVID-19 (range of samples, 89.2%-92.6%), suggests
that controlling COVID-19 is a top public priority.15 We used quota sample surveys to
rapidly assess public compliance, priorities, and life impact related to COVID-19 and
mitigation strategies. We recognize the potential for self-selection bias; however, the
high response rate (63.9%) and consistency of responses across cities and countries
despite different rates of infection, governments, and mitigation strategies indicate that
these results are robust. Contrary to public attitudes and compliance with recommended
mitigation during the last pandemic16-17 declared by the World Health Organization for
novel influenza A (H1N1) in 2009,18 the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic
represents a hitherto unprecedented and rapid level of compliance with public health
emergency measures that have and will continue to have a profound impact on
economics and public life. These results demonstrate an escalated public response
compared to before shelter-in-place orders were widely implemented,19 and contribute
to a growing body of evidence that mitigation strategies for COVID-19, like those for
previous outbreaks, are associated with significant disruption of life and general health
consequences.20-25 These findings may also provide insight into behavioral
countermeasures related to sleep, exercise, and diet that may reduce adverse health
consequences of COVID-19 mitigation measures. As controversies over the legality26
and balance between duration and nature of mitigation strategies and related
consequences continue to mount, and with the recent prospect of repeated and

protracted stay-at-home orders being recommended over the next two years,27
assessment of public priorities, compliance, and life impact is paramount.
Compliance with and support for COVID-19 mitigation strategies, alongside concerns
and life impact, were assessed in nationally representative samples in the United States
and Australia. These timely findings indicate that the public is not only willing to accept
current mitigation measures and their associated costs, but that people endorse their
continuation until the COVID-19 pandemic is controlled.

Fig 1. The survey was managed through an online respondent panel by Qualtrics. A
priori quota limits were determined prior to study initiation to ensure nationally
representative samples were collected and included the following: age, gender, and
either race and ethnicity (US, NY, LA) or ancestry (AU), based on 2010 US and 2016
Australian census data. Of 8718 eligible potential respondents, 5573 completed
surveys, providing a 63.9% response rate.

Fig 2. (A) Percentage of respondents by region who report: compliance with nationally recommended
mitigation strategies; support for a government‐mandated stay‐at‐home order; perceived risk of
eventual infection with COVID‐19; personal experience with COVID‐19 (i.e., knowing someone who was
infected with or died from COVID‐19); and moderate to extreme concerns regarding: one’s own or
others’ risk of infection with or death from COVID‐19, personal financial loss, and possible economic
recession. (B) Upper quadrants: Impact by region of COVID‐19 and mitigation strategies on social life,
family life, work and/or study, productivity, sleep patterns, physical activity, and sexual activity;
percentage of respondents reporting that the indicated behavioral category was moderately to
extremely disrupted or improved is shown. Lower quadrants: Percentage of respondents reporting
decreases or increases in six categories [virtual interactions vs. face‐to‐face interactions; time spent
outdoors during daylight hours; time on light‐emitting screens; weekly work hours (among respondents
employed in the fourth quarter of 2019, n=3328); commute time; and weight] at the time of the survey
in April, 2020 (after the COVID‐19 pandemic was declared and mitigation was underway) as compared to
the fourth quarter of 2019 (before the COVID‐19 pandemic was declared).

Quarantine was defined as "not attending public places, including work, supermarkets or pharmacies, school or childcare, places of worship, etc. Individuals in
quarantine do not have visitors and only live with people who usually live in your home. They stay at home or accommodation unless medical care is required."
b
Predictions in the year 2030 or beyond were excluded. There were six such predictions, which follow: (US, 8/6/2064, 2/1/2071), (LA, 1/1/2030, 1/1/2032,
12/31/2050), (AU, 8/10/2066)
c
Stay-at-home was defined as "all non-essential services, such as dine-in restaurants, bars, social venues, gyms, fitness studios, and convention centers, are
shut down. Essential services, such as groceries, pharmacies, gas stations, food banks, convenience stores, and delivery restaurants, remain open. Banks,
local governments that provide services, and law enforcement agencies also remain open."
