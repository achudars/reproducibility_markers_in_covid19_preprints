Abstract
Background. The progression and geographical distribution of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) infection in the UK and elsewhere is unknown because typically only symptomatic
individuals are diagnosed. We performed a serological study of blood donors in Scotland

40

between the 17th of March and the 18th of May to detect neutralising antibodies to SARSCoV-2 as a marker of past infection and epidemic progression.
Aim. To determine if sera from blood bank donors can be used to track the emergence and
progression of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.

45
Methods. A pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay was used to detect
neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The study group comprised samples from 3,500
blood donors collected in Scotland between the 17th of March and 19th of May, 2020.
Controls were collected from 100 donors in Scotland during 2019.
50
Results. All samples collected on the 17th March, 2020 (n=500) were negative in the
pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay. Neutralising antibodies were
detected in 6/500 donors from the 23th-26th of March. The number of samples containing
neutralising antibodies did not significantly rise after the 5th-6th April until the end of the
55

study on the 18th of May. We find that infections are concentrated in certain postcodes
indicating that outbreaks of infection are extremely localised. In contrast, other areas remain
comparatively untouched by the epidemic.
Conclusion. These data indicate that sero-surveys of blood banks can serve as a useful tool

60

for tracking the emergence and progression of an epidemic like the current SARS-CoV-2
outbreak.

Introduction
SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 in Hubei province China as a
140

cause of respiratory disease occasionally leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and
death (COVID-19) (1,2). On the 11th of March, the WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2
outbreak a pandemic. As of July 2020, roughly 10 million confirmed cases of COVID-19
have occurred resulting in 500,000 deaths (3). Increasing age, male gender, smoking and
comorbidities such as cardiac disease, hypertension and diabetes have been identified as risk

145

factors for severe infections (4,5).
Symptomatic individuals typically exhibit fever, cough and shortness of breath 2-14 days
after infection (6). However, an unknown proportion of individuals experience no symptoms
(7–9). Antibody responses in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals are detectable

150

in the blood 14 to 28 days after infection (10,11). Subsequently antibody levels drop and can
become undetectable by some antibody assays in the early convalescent phase (10,12,13)
In this study, we follow blood donors as a means of estimating population exposure from the
start of the pandemic in March through to mid-May when PCR-detected cases in the UK had

155

plateaued (14,15). Samples from donors in an age range of 18-75 years collected across
Scotland were assayed for neutralising antibody to SARS-CoV-2 using a pseudotyped SARSCoV-2 virus microneutralisation (pMN) assay used previously for SARS-CoV and Ebola
virus seroepidemiology purposes (16–18). The sensitivity of the neutralisation assay was
confirmed using an enzyme-immunosorbant (ELISA) assay detecting antibodies to spike

160

protein. The detection frequency of neutralising antibodies in blood donors and a discussion
of its applicability for estimating population level exposure are presented.

500 plasma samples collected on the 17th March, 21st-23rd March, 5th-6th April, 18th-20th
April, 2nd-4th May and 16th-18th May were analysed in the study. An additional 500 samples
from the Greater Glasgow region, collected between the 2nd-4th of May were also analysed.

Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) anonymous archive collected between
September 2018 and December 2019 (IRAS Project No. 18005), before the first reports of the
spread of SARS-CoV-2 in China (1,2). Seventeen control samples from contract-traced
individuals who were PCR-confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infected were used as positive
175

controls in the study. All the individuals from whom the positive control sera samples were
taken had asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections and were recruited through the ISARIC
WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (CCP-UK) at the discharge plus 28 day timepoint. Samples were heat inactivated prior to serological testing by incubation at 56°C for 30
minutes.

SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype microneutralisation assay
A lentivirus-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particle was constructed displaying the full
spike protein on the surface of the pseudotyped virus using a synthetic codon optimised
185

SARS-CoV-2 expression construct (Accession number: YP_009724390.1). Virus infectivity
was determined by titration on HEK 293T ACE2-plasmid transfected cells as previously
described (19). Neutralising antibody titres were determined by endpoint two-fold serial
dilutions of test samples mixed with 105 relative light units (RLU) of pseudotyped virus,
incubated at 37°C for two hours and then mixed with 104 HEK 293T ACE2-transfected cells

190

per well. Plates were incubated for 72 hours at 37°C and then cells were lysed and assayed
for luciferase expression. Neutralisation titres are expressed as 𝐼𝐶!" values. During the assay,
plates were barcoded and controls were spaced throughout the runs. Individuals were blinded
regarding the arrangement of spaced positive controls on the plates.

195
Titration
Pre-pandemic samples and samples collected on the 17th March and the 21st-23rd March were
all titrated to optimise the neutralisation assay. After this point, samples were initially
200

screened for neutralisation using the highest 1:20 dilution. Dilutions of 1:20 were performed
in triplicate along with virus-only, no virus and positive control wells. Samples that produced
a mean RLU two standard deviations below the mean were then titrated out to obtain
𝐼𝐶!" values.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Antibodies to the trimeric spike protein were detected by ELISA. MAXISORP immunoplates
(442404; NUNC) were coated with StrepMAB-Classic (2-1507-001;iba). Plates were blocked
with 2% skimmed milk in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for one hour and then incubated

210

with 0.125ug of soluble SARS-CoV2 trimeric spike protein or 2% skimmed milk in PBS.
After one hour, plasma was added at 1:50 dilution, followed by alkaline phosphatase (AP)conjugated anti-human IgG (A9544; Sigma) at 1:10,000 dilution or AP-conjugated antihuman IgM (A9794; Sigma) at 1:5000 dilution. The reaction was developed by the addition
of p-Nitrophenyl Phosphate (PNPP) substrate and stopped with NaOH. The absorbance was

215

measured at 405nm after 1 hour. Further information is provided in Adams et al 2020 (20).
Estimating the 50% inhibitory concentration
RLUs for each well were standardised against technical positive (cells and virus with no sera)

220

and negative (cells with no sera) controls on each plate to determine a percentage
neutralisation value. An average neutralisation was calculated across the two sample
replicates on each plate (for each dilution). Dilution curves were fit to each sample, with the
percentage neutralisation modelled as a logistic function of the dilution factor. This yielded
an 𝐼𝐶!" value for each sample where a curve could be fit; samples that showed no dilution

225

response because of complete or no neutralisation were not given an 𝐼𝐶!"   value. Dilution
curves were estimated using nonlinear least squares in R version 3.6.3 (21). An error
weighted mean of the 𝐼𝐶!" value was calculated for samples that were repeated on more than
one plate. We classified positive samples as having an 𝐼𝐶!" value greater than the largest
negative control (1:69) with a standard error less than or equal to the least neutralising

230

positive control.
Determining test sensitivity and specificity
Test sensitivity (probability of neutralisation given positive sera) and specificity (probability

235

of a negative result given no exposure) was estimated using 17 (RT-PCR confirmed) positive
controls and 100 pre-pandemic blood donor samples as negative controls. The highest
inhibitory concentration observed for a negative control was used as a threshold to determine

positive samples (giving 100% [98.10-100] specificity). Of the 17 positive controls, 16
samples neutralised with high confidence, giving an estimated sensitivity of 94.11% [79.17240

99.98] (Figure 1).
Accounting for sensitivity and specificity in sample prevalence estimates
Uncertainty in test sensitivity and specificity can be propagated to sample prevalence

245

estimates using a simple hierarchical Bayesian model (22). The number of positive tests in
the positive (𝑛! =   16) and negative (𝑛! = 0) control groups was modelled as a binomial
distribution:
𝑛! ∼ 𝐵𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑚 π! , 𝑁 !
𝑛! ∼ 𝐵𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑚 1 − π! , 𝑁 !

250
where the sensitivity is given by π! and the specificity by π! (𝑁 ! = 17 and 𝑁 ! = 100 are
the number of positive and negative controls respectively). An estimate of the true proportion
of positive sera for samples from a given week and health board (𝑝!,! ) is comprised of
neutralising sera that were missed ([1 − π! ]) and those incorrectly identified as neutralising
255

samples (from 1 − π! ). The observed number of positive samples for the week, w, and
health board, h, (n!,! ) was modelled as a binomial distribution accounting for test
performance:
n!,! ∼ 𝐵𝑖𝑛𝑜𝑚 𝑝!,! π! + 1 − 𝑝!,! 1 − π! ,   𝑁!,!

260

with   𝑁!,! the number of samples from each health board in each week. Using this method,
the uncertainty in test specificity and sensitivity is propagated to the estimate of the
seroprevalence; this results in broader credible intervals that better reflect the inherent
uncertainty in test parameters.

Modelling sample prevalence
270

In estimating seroprevalence, we assume that neutralising antibodies do not wane in the blood
donor population during the survey period and accrue to an equilibrium (13). Making this
assumption, we can fit the logistic function to the time series of sample seroprevalence:

𝑝!,! =

θ!
1 + exp −ρ! w − τ!
θ! ~β ϕ! , η!

275
ρ! ~𝒩 µμ! , σ! !
τ! ~𝓝 µμτ , στ 2 .
Here, θ! is the equilibrium seroprevalence, ρ! , is the rate with which the seroprevalence
approaches this maximum and τ! is the midpoint of the logistic curve for each health board.
280

Parameters were modelled using hierarchical distributions across health boards (the
maximum as a beta to bound it between 0 and 1, the rate and the midpoint as a normal
distribution). Priors are given in the supplementary material. The model was fit in R version
3.6.3 using the Bayesian inference package JAGS version 4.3.0 (23). Models were run across
6 chains until convergence (potential scale reduction factor less than 1.02 and effective

285

sample size > 10,000).

Results
The estimated 𝐼𝐶!" values and standard errors for the control and blood donor samples are
300

shown in Figure 1. Of the 3500 post-pandemic blood donor samples, a total of 111 contained
anti-SARS2 neutralising antibodies using the 𝐼𝐶!" and standard error based thresholds
described in the methods. The results of the neutralisation assay were positively correlated
with ELISA optical density (Figure S2, Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.86, p < 0.001).

305

No samples from the 17th March showed neutralising activity. Blood donor samples obtained
from donations during the 21st-23rd March, 5th-6th April, 18th-20th April, 2nd-4th May and 16th18th May contained neutralising anti-SARS2 antibodies (Figure 2). The number of samples
containing neutralising antibodies did not significantly rise after the 5th-6th April.

310

Estimates of seroprevalence in the healthcare boards based on the final sampling point
between the 16th-18th May are illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. The lowest uncertainty is
associated with estimates from the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board (5.35% [3.197.89%]); Tayside, Lothian and Grampian have similar median estimates with higher
uncertainty. Lanarkshire is predicted to have the highest seroprevalence of all health boards

315

(7.59% [4.60, 11.20%]) whilst the Highlands and Borders have the lowest seroprevalence of
around 2.08 [0, 5.08%] and 2.16 [0, 5.85%], respectively. Throughout this period, IC50 values
between weeks did not show a statistically significant difference (Figure S3). No statistically
significant variation in IC50 value was seen based on age or sex (Figure S4).

320

The outbreaks as a whole in Scotland were centred in the major urban centres – Glasgow and
Edinburgh, in addition to the Lanarkshire health authority region (Figures 3&4). To explore
this phenomenon in further detail, a separate analysis of 491 samples from the Great Glasgow
region collected between the 18th-20th April was performed. 42/490 of these samples have
neutralising antibodies. Analysis of the distribution of samples containing neutralising

325

antibodies by postcodes showed that most of these samples located in the Paisley (PA)
(14/85) and Motherwell (ML) (15/197) postcodes of Greater Glasgow, indicating that
outbreaks in these regions are localised. By comparison, Central Glasgow had comparatively
few samples containing neutralising antibodies (7/195; Figure 5).

The findings from this study suggest that blood donors can be used as a sentinel population to
track the emergence and progression of an epidemic.
Whilst the demographics of blood donors differs in several aspects from the general
335

population, most notably because of the exclusion of those at risk for blood-borne viruses
(HIV-1, HCV, HBV) and syphilis, they might be considered a reasonable representation of
the adult population in the absence of any obvious predisposing factors for infection. The
only other general exclusions were a four-week and a four month donation deferral period in
those people who travelled to specified countries at risk for arbovirus and malaria infections,

340

respectively.
However, estimates of seroprevalence are complicated by non-uniform sampling (Figures
2&3). The blood donations collected and tested in this study tend to be focused in specific
postcodes, based on the locations where weekly donations took place. This produces an

345

added level of complexity as our data shows that outbreaks are focused in specific
communities even on the scale of a medium sized city such as Glasgow (Figure 5). This is
further confounded by the absence of samples from individuals below the age of 18 and
individuals over the age of 75.

350

The results presented in this study are based on a formally non-validated assay. However, by
using contact traced asymptomatic individuals who had been PCR-confirmed as infected by
SARS-CoV-2 and 100 donors obtained prior to the epidemic we were able to ascertain the
sensitivity of the assay. Furthermore, a second ELISA based assay was used to confirm the
analysis. As 16/17 PCR confirmed asymptomatic cases were detected, the assay is estimated

355

to have a sensitivity of 94.11% [79.17-99.98] (Figure 1). Other studies have previously
shown that the pMN assay correlates well with other lab-based and commercial serological
assays (24).
Based on our data, the assay appears to be specific to SARS-CoV-2. There are four

360

circulating seasonal coronaviruses: HKU1, OC43, NL63 and 229E which circulate during the
winter months (25). The 100 pre-pandemic samples collected in the winter months of 2019,
prior to the start of the epidemic in Scotland, did not cross-react with the SARS-CoV-2
pseudotyped virus (Figure 1). Individuals in this cohort will have been infected with the
seasonal coronaviruses but not SARS-CoV-2 and contain neutralising antibodies to them.

365

Therefore, as there were no false positive results in the pre-pandemic samples, which were
not due to noise within the neutralisation assay, we can have a high degree of confidence that
the antibodies detected in the samples from March to May 2020 were generated by SARSCoV-2 infection.

370

The utility of using pMN assays and ELISAs to track population exposure is dependent on
the assumptions that (i) every infected individuals seroconverts, and (ii) that once
seroconverted, the antibodies remain circulating in the blood at detectable levels. A decrease
in total antibody and neutralsing antibody titres have been noted in samples drawn up to two
months post peak neutralising antibody response (approximately 3-4 weeks post infection). In

375

some instances antibody levels occasionally becoming undetectable when tested with a
specific assay and analysis methodology (10,13). This drop in titres may lead to false
negatives in the later timepoints. However, the dates of collection used in this study all fall
within three months of the diagnosis of the first confirmed case in Scotland on 1st March (26).
For this reason, it is unlikely that this study is hampered by the drop in neutralising antibody

levels described elsewhere, although future seroprevalence studies may potentially
underestimate the true level of population exposure. It is possible that some individuals also
may not seroconvert, representing a small pool of patients that will be false negative (12).
Samples containing anti-SARS2 neutralising antibodies were detected in blood donors who

385

gave blood between the 16th-17th March in all Health Boards (Figures 2&3). Subsequently,
samples containing anti-SARS2 neutralising antibodies were detected in every further time
point assayed until the end of the study. Consequently, due to the 14-28 day incubation
period prior to seroconversion, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 began circulating in Scotland in
late February 2020 and potentially earlier (10,11).

𝐼𝐶!"  and  a  standard  error  at  least  as  small  as  the  worst  neutralising  positive  control.  This  penalises  samples  
with  poorly  defined  inhibitory  concentrations.  Pre-­‐pandemic  samples  are  shown  in  yellow,  positive  controls  
in  red  and  blood  donor  samples  as  blue.  ELISA  results  are  annotated  on  top  of  the  points.

Figure  3.  Estimates  of  sample  prevalence  at  the  end  of  our  study  period  (the  parameter  θ!   from  the  
logistic  equation)  ordered  by  the  lower  95%  confidence  interval.  The  median  parameter  estimate  is

intervals,  respectively.  All  sample  estimates  are  characterised  by  high  uncertainty:  the  Lanarkshire  health  
board  is  predicted  to  have  the  highest  prevalence;  Greater  Glasgow  and  Clyde  is  estimated  with  the  most  
confidence;  while  Forth  Valley,  Borders  and  Highland  could  not  be  interpreted:  and  estimates  for  the  
Forth  Valley  should  be  treated  with  scepticism  due  to  poor  sampling  (see  Figure  2).
