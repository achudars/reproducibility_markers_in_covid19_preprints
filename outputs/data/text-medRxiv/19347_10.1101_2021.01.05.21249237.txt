Abstract

39

Pandemic SARS-CoV-2 causes a mild to severe respiratory disease called

40

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Control of SARS-CoV-2 spread will depend

41

on vaccine-induced or naturally acquired protective herd immunity. Until then,

42

antiviral strategies are needed to manage COVID-19, but approved antiviral

43

treatments, such as remdesivir, can only be delivered intravenously. Enisamium

44

(laboratory code FAV00A, trade name Amizon®) is an orally active inhibitor of

45

influenza A and B viruses in cell culture and clinically approved in countries of the

46

Commonwealth of Independent States. Here we show that enisamium can inhibit

47

SARS-CoV-2 infections in NHBE and Caco-2 cells. In vitro, the previously identified

48

enisamium metabolite VR17-04 directly inhibits the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA

49

polymerase. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that VR17-04

50

prevents GTP and UTP incorporation. To confirm enisamium’s antiviral properties,

51

we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in adult,

52

hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which needed medical care either with or without

53

supplementary oxygen. Patients received either enisamium (500 mg per dose) or

54

placebo for 7 days. A pre-planned interim analysis showed in the subgroup of

55

patients needing supplementary oxygen (n = 77) in the enisamium group a mean

56

recovery time of 11.1 days, compared to 13.9 days for the placebo group (log-rank

57

test; p=0.0259). No significant difference was found for all patients (n = 373) or those

58

only needing medical care (n = 296). These results thus suggest that enisamium is

59

an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis and that enisamium treatment shortens

60

the time to recovery for COVID-19 patients needing oxygen.

61
62

Significance statement

63

SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. Although vaccines are now

64

becoming available to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spread, the development of antivirals

65

remains necessary for treating current COVID-19 patients and combating future

66

coronavirus outbreaks. Here, we report that enisamium, which can be administered

67

orally, can prevent SARS-CoV-2 replication and that its metabolite VR17-04 can

68

inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase in vitro. Moreover, we find that COVID-19

69

patients requiring supplementary oxygen, recover more quickly than patients treated

70

with a placebo. Enisamium may therefore be an accessible treatment for COVID-19

71

patients.

Introduction

74

Severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an important human

75

pathogen and the causative agent of COVID-19. Vaccines are available to prevent

76

the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and several antiviral strategies, such as treatment with

77

remdesivir or reconvalescent plasma, have received emergency approval. However,

78

the development of additional strategies remains necessary since vaccine roll-out is

79

slow and current treatments can only be delivered intravenously. A key target for

80

novel drug screening is the RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2 (1-4).

81

SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus and contains a positive-sense, non-

82

segmented RNA genome of around 30 kilobases (5, 6). The 5’ two-thirds of the viral

83

genome encode two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), 1a and 1b, which are

84

translated into two large polyproteins by host cell ribosomes. The two polyproteins

85

are cleaved by intrinsic proteolytic activity to produce 16 non-structural proteins

86

(nsps). Nsp12 is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that copies and transcribes

87

the SARS-CoV-2 genome (7, 8). Nsp12 requires nsp7 and nsp8 for processivity in

88

vitro (9) and likely other nsps, such as nsp9 and nsp13, for processivity in vivo. The

89

structures of nsp12/7/8 and nsp8/9/12/13 complexes from SARS-CoV and SARS-

90

CoV-2 have been solved by cryo-EM (10-12).

91

Remdesivir has been shown to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12/7/8 complex

92

and other nucleoside analogue drugs or small molecule inhibitors have been

93

suggested as therapeutic candidates (1-3). One of the drugs highlighted by the

94

World Health Organisation as a candidate therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2 is

95

enisamium

96

FAV00A, marketed as Amizon®; Fig. 1A). Enisamium is licensed for use in 11

97

countries and a recent study found that enisamium is hydroxylated in humans and

98

human lung cells to a compound called VR17-04 (Fig. 1A). VR17-04 inhibits the

99

activity of the influenza virus RNA polymerase and reduces viral shedding and

100

(4-(benzylcarbamoyl)-1-methylpyridinium)

iodide

(laboratory

code

improves patient recovery in influenza patients (13).

101

In this study, we show that enisamium metabolite VR17-04 inhibits the SARS-

102

CoV-2 nsp12/7/8 complex in vitro, likely by preventing incorporation of GTP and

103

UTP. We also show that parent compound enisamium inhibits SARS-CoV-2 growth

104

on Caco-2 and NHBE cells. In patients needing medical care and supplementary

105

oxygen COVID-19 (Severity Rating 4 [SR 4] of the modified WHO ordinal scale),

106

enisamium significantly improved the time to recovery compared to a placebo

108

SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Results

111

Enisamium inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture

112

Previous experiments showed that enisamium (Fig. 1A) can efficiently inhibit

113

influenza virus replication in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cultures and

114

A549 cells, and to a lesser extent in Caco-2 cells (13). Previous experiments have

115

also demonstrated that enisamium is not cytotoxic to these cells (13). To test if

116

enisamium can inhibit pandemic SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture, we first

117

incubated Caco-2 cells, a standard cell-line for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, with

118

enisamium iodide or enisamium chloride for 6 hours and subsequently infected the

119

treated cells with SARS-CoV-2. After 48 hours, inhibition of viral infection was

120

assessed by antigen staining for viral nucleoprotein expression and RT-qPCR for

121

viral genome replication. We observed a significant reduction in both viral

122

nucleoprotein expression (Fig. 1B), a reduction in the cytopathic effect of the SARS-

123

CoV-2 infection on Caco-2 cells (Fig. 1C), and a 2-log reduction in the number of

124

viral genome copies in the infected cells as a function of the enisamium

125

concentration (Fig. S1). The IC50 for enisamium chloride in Caco-2 cells was 1.2 mM

126

(~300 µg/ml), which is comparable to the inhibitory effect of enisamium on influenza

127

A virus replication in Caco-2 cells (13). To test if enisamium inhibited SARS-CoV-2

128

replication in NHBE cells, NHBE cells were incubated with enisamium iodide for 6

129

hours and subsequently infected with SARS-CoV-2. Analysis of the viral RNA levels

130

in infected NHBE cells revealed an IC50 of 250 µg/ml (Fig. 1D). We obtained

131

comparable results in NHBE cells infected with alpha-coronavirus HCoV NL63 (Fig.

132

1E), implying that enisamium can inhibit coronavirus replication.

133
134

Enisamium and VR17-04 inhibit SARS-CoV-2 nsp12/7/8 activity

135

Previous experiments showed that enisamium and VR17-04 can inhibit the influenza

136

A virus RNA polymerase in vitro (13). To determine if enisamium and its putative

137

metabolite VR17-04 can inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase, we used a

138

SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase in vitro assay that involved nsp12 as the RNA-

139

dependent RNA polymerase, and nsp7 and nsp8 as processivity factors. We

140

expressed and purified SARS-CoV-2 nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12, and mixed them at a

141

ratio of 2:2:1 to form a nsp12/7/8 complex. Next, we incubated the nsp12/7/8

142

complex with a hairpin template (Fig. 1F) in the presence of 0.5 mM of each

143

nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) and varying concentrations of enisamium or the

144

previously identified enisamium metabolite VR17-04. Enisamium inhibited nsp12/7/8

145

activity at relatively high concentrations, with an IC50 of 26.3 mM (Fig. 1G). By

146

contrast, VR17-04 had an estimated IC50 of 0.98 mM on the hairpin template (Fig.

147

1G). These IC50 values are within an order of magnitude of those observed for the

148

inhibition of the influenza virus RNA polymerase (13). Moreover, the IC50 value for

149

VR17-04 on SARS-CoV-2 nsp12/7/8 is similar to remdesivir triphosphate in the

150

presence of 0.5 mM NTPs in a comparable assay (14). A 10-fold reduction of the

151

NTP concentration in the assay lowered the VR17-04 IC50 value to 0.029 mM (Fig.

152

1G), suggesting that VR17-04 is competing with NTP incorporation. Collectively,

153

these data suggest that RNA synthesis by the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12/7/8 complex is

154

inhibited by enisamium and its metabolite VR17-04 in vitro.

155
156

Enisamium forms hydrogen bonds with adenine and cytosine in nsp12 and influenza

157

polymerase active site

158

Previous studies (13, 15) and our data in Fig. 1A, suggest that enisamium acts

159

through metabolite VR17-04 and inhibits the activity of the influenza A virus and

160

SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 RNA polymerases. However, the mechanism of RNA synthesis

161

inhibition by VR17-04 is not fully understood. We hypothesised that the additional

162

OH-group of VR17-04 could support hydrogen bond formation with adenine and

163

cytosine (Fig. 2A), creating two hydrogen bonds in total, while enisamium would form

164

only one hydrogen bond with these bases. We expected that VR17-04 would not

165

form hydrogen bonds with guanine or uridine (Fig. S2), suggesting that the inhibitory

166

effect of VR17-04 would be dependent on the template sequence.

167

The CO and OH groups of VR17-04 can adopt trans and eclipsed

168

conformations that are characterized by three dihedral angles: φ1, φ2 and φ3 (Fig. 2B).

169

Dihedral angles φ1 and φ2 are also present in enisamium, but φ3 involves different

170

atoms (Fig. S4). In VR17-04, dihedral angle φ3 is ~180° in the trans conformation

171

and ~0° in the eclipsed conformation (Fig. 2B). Based on quantum chemical

172

calculations, the eclipsed conformation has a lower energy than the trans

173

transformation (Table S1), and only the eclipsed conformation would be compatible

174

with cytosine or adenosine binding (Fig. 2B). To confirm that VR17-04 can adopt the

175

eclipsed conformation in solution, we measured the 1H NOESY spectrum of VR17-

176

04 in water and found a correlation between the protons ‘HN’ and ‘H5’ that is

177

compatible with a φ3 value of 0° (Fig. 2C). The chemical shifts of the selected

178

protons are reported in Table S2. Additionally, we observed a correlation between

179

the HN and the CH2, or the ortho aromatic protons of the Ph group (Fig. 2C). These

180

observations suggest that VR17-04 can adopt a conformation that would be

181

compatible with hydrogen bond formation with cytosine and adenine.

182

To further investigate whether VR17-04 can inhibit the activity of the SARS-

183

CoV nsp12 RNA polymerases through base-pair interactions with the template, we

184

docked enisamium or VR17-04 into the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12/7/8 complex bound to

185

template RNA and remdesivir monosphosphate (PDB 7bv2, Fig. 2D). Prior to

186

docking, we removed the remdesivir monosphosphate from the complex, and used

187

in silico mutagenesis to change the uridine in the active site to cytosine or adenine.

188

After selection of the most significant poses, we found that both enisamium and

189

VR17-04 can be accommodated in the +1 position of the nucleotide binding pocket

190

(Fig. 2E-G), in a position similar to remdesivir monosphosphate (Fig. 2D). VR17-04

191

was specifically coordinated through hydrogen bond interactions with the unpaired

192

cytosine residue of the template RNA. Nsp12 residues K545 and K555 were

193

predicted to preserve the VR17-04 position in the catalytic cavity (Fig. S4). In

194

addition, our modelling suggests that VR17-04 can form a stacking interaction with

195

the -1 base of the nascent strand. By contrast, enisamium docked in the same +1

196

nascent strand position, but only formed one hydrogen bond with the cytosine in the

197

+1 template position (Fig. S4).

198

To estimate the binding stability of enisamium or VR17-04 in the nsp12 active

199

site, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of enisamium or VR17-04

200

in the nsp12 active site (see Material and Methods for specifics). Our MD simulations

201

predict that VR17-04 favourably binds the unpaired cytosine in the +1 position of

202

nsp12/7/8 complex, maintaining two hydrogen bonds (Watson-Crick base pair) as

203

seen by the preserved hydrogen bonds distances (Fig. 2 E-G) and the coplanarity

204

angle (Fig. 2H, I). By contrast, our simulations predict that enisamium binds less

205

stably to the nsp12/7/8 complex, based on the ~2-fold difference in distance between

206

enisamium and cytosine compared to VR17-04 and cytosine (Fig. 2E, F; Table S3),

207

and a higher estimated Poisson-Boltzmann free energy for the enisamium binding

208

(43.6 kcal/mol) compared to VR17-04 binding to either cytosine (-19.8 kcal/mol) or

209

adenine (-14.8 kcal/mol) (Table S4).

210

To investigate if VR17-04 inhibits the SARS-CoV nsp12/7/8 RNA polymerase

211

complex in a sequence-specific manner, we analysed the extension of a hairpin

212

template containing a cytosine or adenine in the +1 position of the template (Fig. 2J)

213

in the presence or absence of VR17-04. We found that at high VR17-04

214

concentrations, the nsp12/7/8 RNA polymerase complex was prevented from

215

incorporating GTP and UTP (Fig. 2J). When we subsequently moved the cytosine

216

residue to the +2 nt position of the template down and introduced a uridine at the +1

217

position, ATP was incorporated in the presence of VR17-04 but GTP was not (Fig.

218

2K), suggesting that the inhibitory activity of VR17-04 is dependent on the sequence

219

of the template.

221

Enisamium Improves COVID-19 Patient Recovery in Interim Analysis of Clinical Trial

222

To investigate if enisamium affects the clinical course of COVID-19 patients, a

223

double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III clinical study was performed.

224

The COVID-19 diagnosis was based on a body temperature of ≥37.8 °C and

225

laboratory confirmed presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR in pharyngeal

226

swabs or sputum. The patient cohorts required either medical care but no

227

supplementary oxygen (Severity Rating (SR) 5; WHO score 3), or medical care and

228

supplementary oxygen (SR 4; WHO score 4) on the day of enrolment and

229

randomization. Randomized COVID-19 patients were treated with either placebo or

230

enisamium iodide for 7 days. The chosen primary endpoint of the trial was time-to-

231

recovery, and recovery was defined as an improvement in the SR baseline status by

232

2 SR score values (e.g., a change from SR 4 to SR 6).

233

In accordance with the study protocol, an interim analysis on all patients in the

234

Intent-to-Treat evaluation set (ITT) was performed for the primary endpoint by an

235

Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) using a pre-defined Charter. The

236

ITT set for interim analysis included 373 patients of which 296 patients had SR 5 and

237

77 patients had SR 4 on day of randomization (Fig. 3A). The interim analysis showed

238

no difference in time-to-recovery and median time–to-recovery between all placebo-

239

and enisamium-treated ITT patients (Fig. 3B) nor in the subgroup of patients with SR

240

5 (Fig 3C). In contrast, analysis of the SR 4 subgroup alone (n = 77) revealed a

241

faster time-to-recovery with the enisamium-treated patients compared to the

242

placebo-treated for the whole period of recovery, starting 7 days after randomization

243

(Fig. 3D). The estimated median time–to-recovery was 13 days for the placebo-

244

treated patients and 11 days for the enisamium-treated patients. The mean time-to-

245

recovery was 13.9 days for the placebo-treated group and 11.1 days for the

246

enisamium-treated group. The log-rank test showed a significant advantage in

247

recovery time in favour of enisamium treatment at interim stage (P = 0.0259). The

248

maximum time-to-recovery was reached on day 21 for the enisamium-treated group.

249

Not all patients recovered in the placebo-treated group. For these patients, the

250

recovery time was displayed as 29 days (Fig. 3D).

251

Based on the above findings, the IDMC recommended to stop recruitment of

252

patients requiring only medical care but no oxygen (SR 5; WHO score 3) and to

253

continue the study with COVID-19 patients requiring supplementary oxygen in

254

addition to standard medical care (SR 4; WHO score 4).

255

257

Discussion

258

The rapid global spread of SARS-CoV-2 necessitates development of effective

259

therapeutic interventions, and the most promising short-term strategy is to repurpose

260

existing drugs. In this study we showed that enisamium, which is approved for use

261

against influenza in 11 countries, can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis (Fig. 1).

262

Moreover, we showed that enisamium and its metabolite, VR17-04, inhibit the RNA

263

synthesis activity of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12/7/8 complex (Fig. 1, 2). Molecular

264

dynamics analysis and in vitro activity assays suggest that VR17-04 prevents GTP

265

and UTP incorporation into the nascent RNA chain (2).

266

It was previously reported that enisamium inhibits the influenza A virus RNA

267

polymerase activity in vitro with a relatively high IC50 value of 46.3 mM (13). This

268

inhibition was improved 55-fold by addition of a hydroxyl group in the compound

269

VR17-04 (13). We find that SARS-CoV-2 nsp12/7/8 complex activity is inhibited by

270

274

promise in both cell culture and clinical trials as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2

275

infection (16).

276

Our docking and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that VR17-04 can

277

bind a template cytosine or adenine base in the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA

278

polymerase. This hypothesis is supported by our NOE experiments performed in

279

water, which indicate that VR17-04 can adopt an eclipsed conformation in solution.

280

Only the eclipsed conformation is compatible with the sequence-specific inhibition

281

we observed in our in vitro polymerase reactions. We cannot fully exclude the

282

possibility that VR17-04 can also bind bases in the nascent RNA strand. However,

283

we think that this alternative explanation does not adequately explain our data.

284

We observed that the inhibitory effect of enisamium was more pronounced in

285

NHBE cells than in Caco-2 cells, which is in line with previous influenza A virus

286

experiments (13, 15) and suggest that enisamium is more readily metabolised into

287

VR17-04 in primary bronchial epithelial cells compared to adenocarcinoma cells.

288

Interestingly, the interim phase III clinical trial results that we disclose here reveal a

289

faster improved recovery in COVID-19 patients needing supplementary oxygen,

290

strongly suggesting that our in vitro data are well-aligned with the data from the

291

clinical trial. We cannot exclude that enisamium or its metabolite has effects beyond

292

RNA polymerase inhibition and that these additional effects contribute to the COVID-

293

19 patient recovery.

294

Overall, our results strongly suggest that enisamium metabolite VR17-04

295

inhibits RNA synthesis by the SARS-CoV-2 nsp12/7/8 complex. Together with the

296

interim phase III clinical trial findings that enisamium improved the recovery of

297

COVID-19 needing supplementary oxygen (SR 4) by more than 2 days, our

298

observations raise the possibility that enisamium could be used a viable therapeutic

299

option against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, unlike remdesivir, enisamium does

300

not require intravenous administration, which would be advantages for its use

301

outside of a hospital setting. Together with observations that enisamium can inhibit

302

other RNA virus infections, and DNA virus infections (13, 15, 17), these results here

303

suggest that it can act as broad-spectrum polymerase inhibitor.

375

The VR17-04 and enisamium conformational characterization and geometry

376

optimization was done using the quantum chemical approach DFT B3LYP/6-31G*.

377

The lowest energy conformation of VR17-04 (φ3 eclipsed) and enisamium were

378

selected for further docking and for partial charge estimation (Table S1).

379
380

Molecular docking

381

The docking simulation was performed using Autodock 4.2 software (21). The

382

geometry of the ligands was previously optimized by DFT B3LYP/6-31G*. The

383

geometry of the receptor RdRp was extracted from the PDB 7bv2 (22). The catalytic

384

site of the nsp12/7/8 complex include the template RNA strand, the nascent strand

385

RNA, the pyrophosphate moiety [O3P-O-PO3]-4 (pyr) and two Mg+2 ions, whose

386

positions were included in 7BV2. The two Zn+2 ions that were co-crystallized in 7BV2

387

were also included in the models. The co-crystallized inhibitor remdesivir was

388

removed from the complex, while its position and the contacts with the template RNA

389

trough the unpaired uracil base in the +1 position were used to guide the molecular

390

docking. The unpaired uracil base was subsequently mutated in cytosine (Cyt) or

391

adenine (Ade) in Pymol 2.3.4 (Schrodinger LLC), generating two different

392

complexes, identified as nsp12/7/8(Cyt) and nsp12/7/8(Ade) respectively. Next,

393

Gasteiger charges were calculated for both ligands (VR17-04, enisamium) and the

394

receptor complexes, and used as parameters of the docking simulation (23). In the

395

docking simulation VR17-04 and enisamium were described by five and four

396

rotational degrees of freedom, respectively. The docking gridbox was built by

397

orthogonal hedges of length between 60 to 80 points. The gridbox centre was set to

398

the NH2- group of the target cytosine or adenine residues of the template RNA

399

strand, respectively, and further set-up to fit the space between the R555 and K545,

400

and the uracil of the nascent RNA strand. The docking runs used the default Genetic

401

Algorithm search, with parameters: number of GA runs, population size, max number

402

of energy evaluation, and max number of generations set as 100, 2000, 2.5⋅107,

403

270.000. At each run the docking solutions were clustered using a tolerance RMSD

404

= 2.0 Å. Three different docking simulations were run: VR17-04 and enisamium were

405

docked on to nsp12/7/8(Cyt), while, for comparison, VR17-04 was further docked on

406

nsp12/7/8(Ade). The docking solutions were selected based on two criteria. The first

407

criterium was the possibility to form a Watson-Crick base-pair interaction between

408

VR17-04 (or enisamium) and the unpaired cytosine or adenine. The second criterium

409

was based on the possibility to figure out interferences of the ligand with the catalytic

410

mechanism, for example by interaction with key residues of the nsp12/7/8 complex.

411

The selected poses were further ranked by preliminary MD simulation (approximately

412

20 ns) in explicit solvent, to predict the stability of the interaction, and to estimate the

413

Poisson-Boltzmann free energy of binding, this last property was used to obtain a

414

final selection and ranking of the poses.

415
416

Molecular dynamic simulation

417

Explicit solvent MD simulation were run using NAMD 2.12 (24) software, applying the

418

Amber force field (ff14SB) (25). The TIP3P (26) water solvent model was used. The

419

t-leap application of the Ambertools 14.0 package (25) was applied to generate the

420

topology, the parameters, and the coordinate files of the macromolecular complex

421

simulated. The coordinates of the macromolecular elements of the nsp12/7/8

422

complex: nsp12, nsp8, nsp7, pyr, template RNA, nascent strand RNA, were

423

extracted from the PDB 7bv2. The geometries of the VR17-04, enisamium (before

424

docking) and pyr were optimized using the quantum chemical approach DFT

425

B3LYP/6-31G*; the corresponding partial charges were estimated fitting the

426

electrostatic potential that was calculated at level of theory B3LYP/6-31G*/RHF/6-

427

31G*. This procedure is in accord to the standard required by the Amber force field.

428

The quantum chemistry software GAMESS (27) was used for this stage. The Amber

429

atomtypes (parm10.dat)

430

(antechamber application, Ambertools 14.0). Three macromolecular complexes

431

indicated as VR1704-nsp12/7/8(Cyt), enisamium-nsp12/7/8(Cyt), and VR1704-

432

nsp12/7/8(Ade), were solvated by a 15 Å wide layer of TIP3P water molecules in

433

each X, Y, Z direction; the orthogonal simulation box was built with hedges of

434

approximate length 116, 116, 127 Å. The non-bond electrostatic and dispersive

435

interactions were described by the standard cut-off technique (12.0 Å). Before

436

running MD simulation, each simulation cell box was energy minimized running 200

437

K steps of the default energy minimized algorithm, as implemented in NAMD. The

438

MD simulations were run fixing the number of particle (N), the absolute temperature

439

(T), and the pressure (P) applied to the cell hedges. The absolute temperature was

442

Langevin piston algorithm. The first MD simulation stage was run to adjust the

443

simulation cell box density, allowing the relaxation of all the inter-molecule distances,

444

i.e., the solute-solute, solute-solvent, and solvent-solvent distances. The cell density

445

equilibration stage was run restraining the atoms of the solute to their initial position

446

(energy minimized geometry of the complex) applying a harmonic restraint. In this

447

stage of cell density equilibration, the water molecules were left free to move. The

448

harmonic restraint constant value was set initially as 1 Kcal mol-1 for each atom of

449

the solute, and progressively reduced at 0.5 and 0.2 Kcal mol-1. The cell density

450

equilibration stage was monitored plotting the cell volume (Å3) vs time (ns), until the

451

cell volume fluctuations level-off to a horizontal axis that corresponds to the average

452

final volume of the cell. This stage required between 20 to 50 ns approximately and

453

was further checked by the formation of a thin water shell that surround the face of

454

the inhibitor molecule that is exposed to the empty catalytic cavity of the nsp12/7/8

455

complex. In the second stage of the MD simulation, the harmonic restraint was

456

removed, and the inhibitor-nsp12/7/8 complex was allowed to equilibrate in the

457

geometry and the relative position of their elements: inhibitor, template RNA, nascent

458

strand RNA, pyr, Mg+2, and Zn+2. To monitor the equilibration of position and

459

orientation that VR17-04 (or enisamium) presents in the +1 position of the catalytic

460

cavity, the distances between the carbonyl oxygen of VR17-04 and the hydrogen

461

(NH2-) of cytosine (or adenine), and between the hydroxyl group of VR17-04 and the

462

nearby lone pair of cytosine nitrogen (or adenine), were plotted vs simulation time.

463

These distances provide a direct indication of the stability of the Watson-Crick base

464

pair interaction that hold the inhibitor and the target base. The orientation of the

465

VR17-04 in the catalytic site of the nsp12 were also monitored by the improper

466

dihedral angle φ defined by the following atoms (bold) CO-NH2-N-OH, in which CO

467

and OH belong to VR17-04, while the remaining NH2 and N belong to the opposite

468

cytosine (or adenine). Alternatively, the enisamium-cytosine pair require the following

469

atoms CO-NH2-N-CH to define φ, in this case CO and CH belong to enisamium,

470

while NH2 and N belong to the opposite cytosine. In fact, values of this angle around

471

‘0’ indicate that the ‘base pair’ contact between VR1704 the cytosine (or adenine) is

472

coplanar, a geometric condition favouring the Watson-Crick ‘base-pair’ interaction

473

between VR17-04 and the base. VMD 1.9.3 (28) was used for the MD simulation

474

trajectory visualization and image creation.

ventilation or high flow oxygen; 4 (5) - Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen;

544

5 (3) - Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen – requiring ongoing medical

545

care; 6 (-) - Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen – no longer requires

546

ongoing medical care; 7 (2) - Not hospitalized, limitation on activities and/or requiring

547

home oxygen; 8 (1) - Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities. Safety of

548

enisamium iodide will be analysed based on the incidence of adverse events, vital

549

signs, judgement of global tolerability on day of hospital discharge (separately by

550

patient and investigator) and laboratory data when the study is completed.

Statistical Analysis of Interim Data.

553

The unblinded interim analysis was carried out by an Independent Data Monitoring

554

Committee based on a pre-specified Charter. At this stage, the primary outcome was

555

pre-planned to be tested by using the two-sided log-rank test stratified by centre.

556

Because of the low patient number in some centres the stratification was omitted for

557

gaining primary interim results. The primary outcome was defined as an

558

improvement from baseline of at least two SR points and was evaluated for all ITT

559

patients at the interim stage as well as for subgroups with baseline score of SR 4

560

and 5 separately. The interim analysis used the promising zone approach according

561

to (31) that was implemented according to (32). For this method no adjustment of the

562

type-I error rate is needed.
