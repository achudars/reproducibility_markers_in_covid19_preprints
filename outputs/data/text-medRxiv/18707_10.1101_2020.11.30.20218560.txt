determine the safety and mortality of CP among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

54

Study Design and Methods: This multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled clinical trial is currently

55

being conducted at nine hospitals in Chile. Patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 who were

56

still within 14 days since symptom onset were classified into four groups: Patients with cancer

57

and severe COVID-19. Patients with cancer and non-severe COVID-19. Patients with severe

58

COVID-19 and patients with non-severe COVID-19 only. The intervention involved two 200-cc.

CP transfusions with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers ≥ 1:320 collected from COVID-19-recovered

Results:

64

transfusion was 5.7% and 16.1% respectively. There were no differences at either time point in

65

mortality between the four groups. Patients on mechanical ventilation when receiving CP had

66

higher mortality rates than those who were not (22.8% vs. 11.5%; p = 0.037). Overall 30-day

67

mortality was higher in patients over 65 than in younger patients (p = 0.019). Severe adverse

68

events were reported in four patients (2.1%) with an overall transfusion-related lung injury

rate of 1.56%. No CP-related deaths occurred.

Adverse events

226

We registered a total of 11 CP transfusion-related adverse events (2.9%), four (1.1%) of

227

which were considered to be serious adverse events (SAEs) related to CP transfusion including

228

three cases of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and one case of thrombocytopenia.

No CP transfusion-related deaths were reported (Table 4). The adverse events are summarized

To the

best of our knowledge, this is

the

first report of in-hospital

mortality and

233

treatment safety from a Latin-American multicenter study on patients with COVID-19 who

234

received CP. Although this study did not aim to demonstrate the efficacy of CP, our reported 7-

235

and 30-days mortality rates are comparable with those reported by the Mayo Clinic in the

236

largest CP study to date, which showed 7- and 30 day-mortality rates of 10.5% and 24.5%,

237

respectively. Unlike the series published by Joyner et al. (2020), our cohort did not display

258

The main endpoint of our study was a safety assessment of the occurrence and type of

259

CP-related adverse events. Overall, 70% of patients reported at least one adverse event. This

260

rate is typical in a cohort of critically ill patients. Only 11 adverse events were related to the CP

261

transfusion, and four of these were identified as SAEs. All 11 adverse events were classified as

262

“possibly related” to the intervention by the treating physician using a four-item Likert-type

263

scale (probably, possibly, remotely, or not related). TRALI was the most frequent SAE (1.5%, n

264

= 3). This incidence is within the 0.001 to 2.1% range reported in both the general population

and critically ill patients (

The present study has some limitations. Since we aimed to assess mortality rates and
