ABSTRACT
Objectives The aim of this study was to compare the perception, confidence, hesitancy, and
acceptance rate of various COVID-19 vaccine types among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Saudi
Arabia, a nation with MERS-CoV experience.
Design National cross-sectional, pilot-validated questionnaire.
Setting Online, self-administered questionnaire among HCWs.
Participants A total of 2,007 HCWs working in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia participated;
75.3% completed the survey and were included in the analysis.
Intervention Data were collected through an online survey sent to HCWs during November 115, 2020. The main outcome measure was HCW acceptance of COVID-19 candidate vaccines.
The associated factors of vaccination acceptance were identified through a logistic regression
analysis and via measurement of the level of anxiety, using the generalized anxiety disorder 7
(GAD7) scale.
Results Among the 1512 HCWs who were included, 62.4% were women, 70.3% were between
21 and 40 years of age, and the majority (62.2%) were from tertiary hospitals. In addition, 59.5%
reported knowing about at least one vaccine; 24.4% of the participants were sure about their
willingness to receive the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, and 20.9% were willing to receive the
RNA BNT162b2 vaccine. However, 18.3% reported that they would refuse to receive the Ad5vectored vaccine, and 17.9% would refuse the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine. Factors that
influenced the differential readiness of HCWs included their perceptions of the vaccine’s
efficiency in preventing the infection (33%), their personal preferences (29%), and the vaccine’s
manufacturing country (28.6%).
Conclusions Awareness by HCWs of the several COVID-19 candidate vaccines could improve
their perceptions and acceptance of vaccination. Reliable sources on vaccine efficiency could
improve vaccine uptake, so healthcare authorities should use reliable information to decrease
vaccine hesitancy among frontline healthcare providers.

INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted normal societal and economic activities
worldwide and is expected to continue imposing strains and burdens on health systems in most

countries. Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic remains out of control.[1] The existing measures
to control COVID-19 are detrimental to the global economy[2] and result in significant
impairment in physical and psychological well-being.[3] To keep COVID-19 under control
requires an effective vaccine. Without COVID-19 vaccination, healthcare workers (HCWs) will
likely be at risk of infection and are likely to serve as a reservoir inside health institutes, which
would undermine efforts to end the pandemic. According to the World Health Organization
(WHO), 56 and 166 candidate vaccines are in clinical and pre-clinical evaluation, respectively,
as of December 17, 2020.[4] These include JNJ-78436735, an adenovirus vaccine
(Ad26.COV2.S)[5, 6]; mRNA-1273, an mRNA vaccine[7]; AZD1222, an adenovirus vaccine
(ChAdOx1 nCoV-19)[8]; BNT162b1, an mRNA vaccine[9]; NVX-CoV2373, a full-length
recombinant SARS CoV-2 glycoprotein nanoparticle vaccine adjuvanted with Matrix M[10]; and
Ad5-nCoV, an adenovirus vaccine.[11-14] The encouraging news is that several vaccines have
been released; many are in phase III clinical trials and show promising effectiveness.[15] As
some safe and efficacious vaccines became available, policymakers must ensure successful,
large-scale uptake of COVID-19 vaccines to achieve community immunization. However, the
success of COVID-19 vaccination programs will largely depend on people’s acceptance of the
vaccine. A recent global survey suggested that nearly 30% of participants would hesitate to take
a COVID-19 vaccine when it is available.[16] A systematic review on the acceptance of a
COVID-19 vaccine, based on nationally representative surveys in 20 nations, indicates that the
vaccine acceptance rate in most nations would not reach the 67% necessary for achieving
population immunity.[17] Mathematic modelling suggested that, if the efficacy of a COVID-19
vaccine was 80%, at least 75% coverage would be needed to extinguish the ongoing
pandemic.[18] Therefore, a timely understanding of community responses to the forthcoming
COVID-19 vaccines is important for policymaking and service planning.
Extant literature has explored vaccine acceptance and identified a few demographic and
psychosocial correlates, such as gender, age, trust in research, knowledge, and concerns about
the novel vaccine, as well as people’s judgment and perceptions about the risk of COVID19.[19-21] Risk of exposure is one of several essential issues that directly shape people’s
assessments of their vulnerability and risk. Even when using personal protective equipment,
healthcare providers and other essential workers experience high-risk exposures to COVID-19
and should be given priority in vaccine allocations. Several studies suggest that being an HCW

or being involved in the care of patients with COVID-19 is positively associated with COVID-19
vaccine acceptance.[22-24]
The lessons learned from previous infectious disease pandemics and outbreaks, including
SARS, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and Ebola outbreaks, demonstrate the important role that health
information has on disease control and vaccine acceptance.[25] Source of health information can
affect the manner and frequency of the utilization of such information. The degree to which the
information source is trusted can have a remarkable impact on the acceptance of information.[26]
If HCWs distrust the source, they will doubt the information about different COVID-19
vaccines, and this doubt will in turn shape the attitudes, perceptions, and potential actions they
take toward various COVID-19 vaccines.
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is one of the top 30 countries with the highest
reported COVID-19 cases: The KSA had 360,690 laboratory-confirmed cases and 6101 deaths as
of December 19, 2020.[27] Acceptance of a potential COVID-19 vaccine assessed among HCWs
in the KSA in a survey of 2007 participants showed an acceptance rate of 70%,[28] which is
slightly higher than the acceptance rate found in a public survey among 992 participants from the
general population (acceptance rate of 65%).[29] Perception of, confidence in, and hesitancy
about various COVID-19 vaccines in the context of emerging viral infections and pandemics and
with regard to manufacturing companies and different sources of information are principal
factors in assessing vaccine acceptance. To the best of our knowledge, no published surveys
specifically target and compare HCW perception, confidence, and hesitancy toward different
types of COVID-19 candidate vaccines. Our previous research showed that most (70%) HCWs
are willing to receive COVID-19 vaccines once they are available,[28] so we aimed in this study
to compare the perception, confidence, hesitancy, and acceptance rates of various COVID-19
vaccine types among HCWs.

METHODS
Data collection
This study was a national cross-sectional survey among HCWs in Saudi Arabia during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected during November 1–14, 2020. At the time of data
collection, at least seven COVID-19 vaccine candidates had been reported in the scientific

literature. HCWs were screened for their awareness of any of the seven published vaccines.[28]
Participants were invited using a convenience sampling technique. We used several social media
platforms and email lists to recruit participants. The survey was a pilot-validated, selfadministered questionnaire that was sent to HCWs online through SurveyMonkey©, a platform
that allows researchers to deploy and analyze surveys via the internet.[30] The questionnaire was
adapted from our previously published study,[31] with modifications and additions related to the
potential COVID-19 vaccine.
The questions included the demographic characteristics of respondents (job category, age,
sex, years of clinical experience, and work area), and any previous exposure to Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) or to patients with COVID-19 (either suspected
or confirmed). We assessed the following outcomes related to the seven COVID-19 vaccine
candidates that had been reported in the scientific literature: knowledge, perceived awareness,
and readiness to receive each type of COVID-19 vaccine candidate. In addition, we assessed
factors affecting respondents’ readiness to receive various COVID-19 vaccine candidates and the
HCW’s sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines.
Before participation, the purpose of the study was explained in English at the beginning
of the online survey. The respondent was given the opportunity to ask questions via a dedicated
email address. The institutional review board at the College of Medicine and King Saud
University Medical City approved the study (approval #20/0065/IRB). A waiver for signed
consent was obtained because the survey presented no more than a minimal risk to participants
and involved no procedures for which written consent is usually required outside the study
context. To maximize confidentiality, personal identifiers were not required.
HCWs were screened for their awareness of any of the seven published vaccines.
Notably, Pfizer announced during the study that the efficacy of their vaccine in the first interim
analysis was more than 90%.[32]
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics approaches, with means and standard deviations, were applied to
continuous variables, and percentages were used for dichotomous variables. The two-sample t
test was used to evaluate continuous scores, and the Z test was used to compare proportions.
A multivariable logistic regression model was used to explore associations between the
outcome variable of HCW knowledge about the available COVID-19 vaccine candidates and

HCW demographic, belief toward vaccine candidates, and level of anxiety. The association
between predictors and the outcome was expressed as the odds ratio and 95% confidence
interval. SPSS (version 21; IBM Corp) was used for the data analysis, Excel (Microsoft) was
used for creating figures and depictions, and statistical significance was set at p=0.050. [33]

RESULTS
A total of 2079 HCWs were invited to participate in the study; 2007 (96.5%) agreed to
participate, and 1512 participants (75.3%) were included in the analysis. The participants’
sociodemographic characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Women comprised the majority of the population (62.4%), most participants (70.3%)
were between 21 and 40 years of age, 68.6% were married—though only 47.3% were living with
their families—and 76.2% reported not having any chronic illnesses.
Respondents’ working areas were distributed almost evenly across different sectors of health
institutions, but the majority were from the public/governmental (47.1%) sectors and tertiary
institutions (62.2%). In terms of awareness of potential vaccine candidates reported in the
literature, the majority (59.5%) reported knowing about at least one vaccine.

The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was the vaccine recognized the most by HCWs
(39.3%), followed by the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine (31.9%) and the RNA BNT162b2 vaccine
(30.8%). The least well-known vaccine among HCWs was the mRNA-1273 vaccine (19.9%;
Table 2).
HCWs were asked to indicate their readiness to receive each type of COVID-19 vaccine
with response categories of never, maybe, or sure (i.e., willing to receive). The vaccine that most
HCWs reported they were willing to receive was the AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (24.4%),
followed by the Pfizer RNA BNT162b2 (20.9%) vaccine. Conversely, HCWs reported that they
were most likely to refuse receipt of the CanSino Ad5-vectored (18.3%) and Gamaleya GamCOVID-Vac (17.9%) vaccines. The respondents reported maybe most often for any vaccine
candidate, with maybe responses ranging from 65.1% for the AstraZeneca vaccine to 75.5% for
the Moderna mRNA vaccine (Table 2).

In determining the factors that influenced differential readiness of HCWs to receive the
vaccine candidates that had been reported in scientific literature, a multiple-response dichotomies
analysis showed that respondents’ perceptions of the vaccine candidate as more efficient in
preventing infection was the most influencing factor (33%) in their decisions, followed by their
personal preferences (29%) and the vaccine’s manufacturing country (28.6%). The least
influential factors were media and social media coverage (12.3%) and trustworthiness (4.2%;

The HCW’s sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines are shown in Table 4. The
WHO website was the most utilized source for information (51.1%), followed by social media
networks (48.3%), the Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) website (43.8%), and official press
releases (38.3%). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website was utilized by only

A substantial number of HCWs in this study (n=612, 40.5%) reported unawareness of
some vaccine candidates reported in scientific literature as of the time of the study. Therefore, as
a secondary analysis, the generalized linear multivariate gamma regression analysis was used to
explain the predictors of how likely the surveyed HCWs were to be aware of the different
scientifically reported vaccine candidates. These results are presented in Table 5 and show that
women knew significantly less than men about the different vaccine candidates (p=0.016). Older
age correlated significantly and positively with more knowledge (p=0.027). Also, physicians
knew significantly more about vaccine candidates than other HCWs did (p=0.001), and the
HCWs from primary and secondary health centers knew of significantly fewer COVID-19

vaccine candidates than did HCWs from tertiary medical centers (p=0.002 for primary, p=0.02
for secondary). The participant’s belief in the ability of COVID-19 vaccines to stop the
pandemic predicted significantly higher knowledge of the available vaccine candidates
(p=0.009). HCWs who did not interact with COVID-19–infected family members knew
significantly less about the available vaccine candidates (p=0.018). Other specific worry/anxiety
levels and beliefs were assessed, as reported in Table 5

NOTE: Dependent variable was the total number of vaccines the HCW knew about. The
exponentiated (β) coefficient was interpreted as a rate.
Our analysis (Fig 1) showed a significantly higher percentage rate of HCW
readiness to receive any COVID-19 vaccine relative to the refusal rate after the Pfizer
announcement compared to before it (χ2[1)]4.56, p=0.032). This result was similar to HCW
readiness to receive the BNT162b2 vaccine (Fig 2).

DISCUSSION
Since the beginning of the pandemic, an unprecedented global effort to develop a vaccine has
been underway; research and development of different technologies have been applied for
different vaccine candidates. The effort resulted in several types of vaccine candidates developed
with various technologies, including adenovirus and RNA-based vaccines, all of which are novel
and have not been developed for wide clinical use in other infectious diseases. Gaining
knowledge of such new vaccines, with the rapid evolution of the development process, may be
challenging: only 40% of study participants were aware of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine,[5-9,
11, 34, 35] and only one third were aware of the BNT162b2, Gam-COVID-Vac, and
Ad26.COV2-S vaccines. Only a quarter of participants knew about the remaining vaccines. To
our knowledge, data about HCW knowledge of vaccine candidates has not been published
elsewhere.
Acceptance about COVID-19 vaccines in general has been studied. In a global survey in
19 countries about the potential acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine among the public, 71.5%
reported they would very or somewhat likely agree to receive a vaccine; respondents from China
gave the highest proportion of positive responses (631 [88.6%] of 712 respondents) and the
lowest proportion of negative responses (five [0.7%0 of 712) when asked if they would take a

proven, safe, and effective vaccine. Respondents from Poland reported the highest proportion of
negative responses (182 [27.3%] of 666), whereas Russian respondents gave the lowest
proportion of positive responses (373 [54.9%] of 680). Data are available about other diseases
with multiple vaccine types as well. In a parental survey on acceptance of an intranasal, live,
attenuated influenza vaccine, 81% preferred this version compared with the injectable inactivated
influenza vaccine[36]; however no such acceptance rate has been evaluated among HCWs.[37]
It is interesting to note that, of all the HCW respondents asked about taking a COVID-19
vaccine, only 20% or 24% preferred to receive the AstraZeneca or the Pfizer vaccine,
respectively. This low response to acceptance of any vaccine in development may indicate
variability in the knowledge and understanding about the different vaccines. Vaccine knowledge
is an area that needs more study to understand variables contributing to acceptance or rejection
of each type of vaccine according to different development platforms used. This understanding
would aid policymakers in the development of appropriate educational materials to boost
confidence in various vaccine platforms.
Many factors affect the choice to receive vaccines. In this study, the top reason for
choosing a vaccine was that the vaccine seems more effective at preventing infection (33%). A
previous study found that 50% vaccine efficacy was associated with a 51% rate of
acceptance.[38]
The manufacturing country was another reason given for accepting the vaccine (in 28.6%
of respondents). This finding is similar to results from a US survey related to hypothetical
vaccines. The surveyed individuals had lower acceptance of the vaccine if it originated from a
country outside the United States.[38] Other contributing factors, such as fewer adverse effects,
were also reported in this study.[38] Understanding these factors is important to build strategies
for vaccine acceptance in any community. Strategies should address concerns, contributing
factors, and misconceptions.[39] Trustworthiness was indicated by approximately 4% of the
respondents as a factor in accepting a COVID-19 vaccine. It is important to note that trust is an
important modifiable element of any successful vaccine campaign. Trustworthiness was strongly
associated with acceptance of COVID-19,[40] and this factor was also related to acceptance of
other vaccines, such as H1N1, SARS, and MERS vaccines.[25]
The most-reported sources of information for HCWs were the WHO website and social
networks (as expected in a pandemic). Previously, Alsubaie et al.[41] reported results from the

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.22.20248657; this version posted December 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this

same HCWs’ population, which showed that hospital announcements and MOH official
statements were more commonly sought for information about the MERS-CoV national
outbreak. Seeking knowledge from reliable sources about the pandemic and vaccinations could
significantly impact the HCWs’ perceptions of vaccine acceptance. Misinformation about the
COVID-19 vaccine was associated with decreased vaccination acceptance among those who
would otherwise definitely vaccinate.[42]
Interestingly, HCWs working in tertiary and academic centers were more knowledgeable
about various vaccine candidates compared with HCWs working in primary and secondary
centers. This result may be explained by more scientific activity and educational campaigns
typically associated with teaching hospitals. This increased knowledge was especially common
among physicians in our study, like other studies; in a cross-sectional survey conducted in Italy
among HCWs to assess their knowledge, attitudes, and practices about vaccinations, physicians
and those who had received information about vaccinations from scientific journals, educational
activities, or professional associations were more likely to have adequate knowledge.[43] The
knowledge differences identified between centers and types of providers highlight the
importance of academic activities and keeping up-to-date with the scientific literature during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
Remarkably, after the Pfizer and BioNTech announcement about the efficacy rate of
BNT162b2, the HCWs in our study demonstrated significantly more willingness to undergo
vaccination.[33] This change was despite simultaneous negative news on some COVID-19
vaccination trials, such as the halting of clinical studies with the CoronaVac vaccine by the
Brazilian national sanitary regulator (Anvisa) due to a serious adverse event.[44] Vaccine
acceptance is a multifactorial issue, but having positive COVID-19 vaccine trial results
circulating in the news and social media for several days after the press release on the efficacy of
BNT162b2 could improve the HCWs’ willingness to vaccinate.

CONCLUSION
HCW awareness of the several COVID-19 candidate vaccines could improve perception and
acceptance of vaccination. Reliable sources on vaccine efficiency could improve vaccine uptake,
and healthcare authorities should utilize these sources to decrease vaccine hesitancy among
frontline healthcare providers.
