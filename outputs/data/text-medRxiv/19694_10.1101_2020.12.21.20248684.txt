ABSTRACT

: Greater COVID-19 related mortality has been reported among persons with various non-

Objective

communicable diseases (NCDs). We performed an ecological study to determine the association of
state-level cases and deaths with NCD risk factors and healthcare and social indices.
: We obtained cumulative national and state-level data on COVID-19 cases and deaths from

Methods

publicly available database www.covid19india.org from February to end November 2020. To identify
association with major NCD risk factors, NCDs, healthcare related and social variables we obtained data
from public sources. Association was determined using univariate and multivariate statistics.
: More than 9.5 million COVID-19 cases and 135,000 deaths have been reported in India at end

Results

November 2020. There is significant positive correlation (Pearson’s r) of state-level COVID-19 cases and
deaths per million, respectively, with NCD risk factors- obesity (0.64, 0.52), hypertension (0.28, 0.16),
diabetes (0.66, 0.46), literacy, NCD epidemiological transition index (0.58, 0.54) and ischemic heart
disease mortality (0.22, 0.33). Correlation is also observed with indices of healthcare access and quality
(0.71, 0.61), urbanization (0.75, 0.73) and human (0.61, 0.56) and sociodemographic ( 0.70, 0.69)
development. Multivariate adjusted analyses shows strong correlation of COVID-19 burden and deaths
with NCD risk factors (r2=0.51, 0.43), NCDs (r2=0.32, 0.16) and healthcare related factors (r2=0.52, 0.38).
Conclusions

: COVID-19 disease burden and mortality in India is ecologically associated with greater

state-level burden of NCDs and risk factors, especially obesity and diabetes.

KEY MESSAGES

•

There is significant state-level variability in COVID-19 cases and deaths in India.

•

In a macrolevel statistical analysis we find that Indian states with better human and
sociodemographic indices, more literacy, longer age, greater burden of non-communicable
diseases and risk factors have greater COVID-19 case burden and mortality.

•

Non-communicable disease risk factors- obesity and diabetes are the most important
determinants on multivariate analyses.

INTRODUCTION

There is strong association of COVID-19 with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and their risk
1

factors. Multiple studies from across the globe have reported that individuals with established coronary
heart disease, heart failure, chronic respiratory, renal or liver disease and cancers or their risk factors
such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and other vascular risk factors are at greater risk of acquiring
infection and developing complications and deaths from COVID-19.2-10 Environmental factors such as
urbanization, crowding, ambient and indoor air pollution and poor sanitation and low socioeconomic
status are also important in increasing the risk of disease and deaths.5,11-13
India has one of the highest absolute burden of COVID-19 infection with more than 9.5 million
cases and 135,000 deaths reported by November 2020.14 However, the rates of infection related cases
and deaths per million population are lower than many developed countries.15 Mortality rate (casefatality rates) from the infection are also lower than many developed countries.15 There is also
significant state-level variation in incidence of cases and deaths with more developed and urbanized
states of the country reporting greater disease burden.16,17 Small case-series from India have reported
greater mortality from COVID-19 among hospitalized patients with diabetes, heart failure, chronic
respiratory and chronic liver and kidney diseases.18-20 It is likely that state-level variation in incidence of
COVID-19 and mortality is influenced by NCD and their risk factors as hypothesized in a previous study.21
We performed a macrolevel ecological analysis using publicly available data to identify association of
regional (state-level) burden of COVID-19 cases and deaths with non-communicable diseases, NCD risk
factors and selected social determinants.
METHODS

The study has been conducted using publicly available data on COVID-19, NCD risk factors and
social factors.14,22 The project proposal was approved by the institutional ethics committee as part of
COVID-19 database at our centre. Daily data on COVID-19 in various states and regions of India are being
regularly updated at a non-commercial public website, www.covid19india.org.14 This website updates
daily data on COVID-19 related cases, deaths, recovery and testing at the state level of India. We
obtained data for all the states in the country and clubbed daily data into weekly and monthly numbers
beginning February 2020 to end of November 2020. The data were collated on spreadsheets. We then
calculated number of cases and deaths per million population, using 2020 estimates, for each state
(Table 1).

We obtained data on state-level burden of related NCD risk factors (obesity, hypertension,
diabetes, smoking, literacy), NCDs (epidemiological transition index, ETI, proportion of disability
adjusted life years due to NCDs vs. communicable, maternal, neonatal and nutritional diseases), and
diseases (ischemic heart disease deaths and disability adjusted life years, DALYs) from national data
sources as shown in Table 2.23-29 Data on healthcare related factors (healthcare availability index (HAI),
healthcare access and quality in index (HAQI) and sociodemographic indices of each state were also
obtained from public websites.25,26 The following indices were used: urbanization index (UI, proportion
of urban to rural population),27 human development index (HDI),28 sociodemographic index (SDI),25 social
development index,29 and vulnerability index.30 Details of estimation of each of these indices have been
reported earlier.22

Statistical analyses

of November 2020 for each state of the country. Descriptive statistics for each state is reported. To
determine association of COVID-19 cases and death with state-level NCD and risk factors, healthcare
indices and sociodemographic variables we calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r value) using
SPSS Statistical Package. MS Office Powerpoint-2007 was used to plot scatter-graphs for estimation of
correlation of various NCD risk factors, NCD and sociodemographic indices with total cases/million and
deaths/million. Linear correlation was calculated and R2 values are reported. ). To identify factors of
importance we also calculated multivariate regression statistics. P value <0.5 was considered significant.
RESULTS

More than 9.5 million COVID-19 cases and 135,000 deaths have been reported in India at end of
November 2020.14 The national burden of cases and deaths is 6900/million and 100.4/million
respectively. There are wide disparities in rates of cases and deaths in different states of India (Table 1)
with reported cases more than 20,000/million in states of Delhi and Goa and 10,000-20,000/million in a
number of states. Similarly deaths rates of more than 300/million are observed in Delhi (490), Goa (434)
and Maharashtra (383). The case-fatality rate also shows significant differences with less than 0.5% in
Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Kerala and Assam to more than 2% in Punjab, Maharashtra and Sikkim.
The data on various state-level NCD risk factors (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and literacy),
NCDs (NCD epidemiological transition index, ischemic heart disease), healthcare indices and various
sociodemographic indices are in Table 2 and shows wide variability.
Univariate correlation analysis (Pearson’s r value) (Table 3) shows significant correlation of
state-level COVID-19 cases/million with obesity (0.642), hypertension (0.283), diabetes (0.656) and

literacy (0.460) and inverse association with tobacco use (-0.555). Significant correlation is also observed
with ETI (0.585), HAQI (0.710), urbanization (0.745), HDI (0.608), sociodemographic index (0.698) and
social development index (0.608). COVID-19 death rates have significant correlation with obesity
(0.520), diabetes (0.458) and literacy (0.458) and inverse association with tobacco use (-0.554).
Significant correlation is also observed with ETI (0.437), IHD death rate (0.332), HAQI (0.614),
urbanization (0.726), HDI (0.563) and sociodemographic index (0.686). There is significant association of
state-level cases/million as well as deaths/million (r=0.86). Correlation of NCD risk factors (obesity,
hypertension, diabetes and tobacco with COVID-19 cases (Figure 1) and deaths (Figure 2) show that the
strongest association is with state-level diabetes prevalence.
Multivariate analyses shows significant association of COVID-19 cases as well as deaths with
NCDs risk factors (unadjusted r2, cases 0.73, deaths 0.51; multivariate adjusted r2, cases 0.65, deaths
0.36) (Table 4). NCD burden as estimated by epidemiological transition index shows significant
association with COVID-19 cases (unadjusted r2 0.34, adjusted r2 0.32) and not with deaths. This
association disappears after adjustment for NCD risk factors. Association of COVID-19 cases and deaths
was also observed with healthcare related factors (unadjusted r2, cases 0.55, deaths 0.42; multivariate
adjusted r2, cases 0.52, deaths 0.38), however, this association was no longer observed with various
social variables after accounting for the NCD risk factors, NCDs and healthcare related factors.
DISCUSSION

Indian states with greater burden of non-communicable disease risk factors (obesity, diabetes)
and in advanced stage of epidemiological transition with greater NCD burden, better healthcare access
and quality, urbanization and human and sociodemographic development have greater COVID-19 case
burden and mortality. This finding has important implications for implementation of population and
individual level preventive measures and equitable vaccine deployment.
That NCD risk factors as well as the disease conditions increase risk of adverse outcomes in
COVID-19 is well reported. Large registries as well as population based databases in UK, USA, Europe
and elsewhere have reported such association. OpenSafely and QRESEARCH patient-level cohorts in
UK,5,31 and multiple cohorts in USA have reported this association. Little is, however, known regarding
macrolevel association of NCD risk factors and diseases on COVID-19 burden and mortality. A significant
association of aging with adverse outcomes in COVID-19 has been reported in China, Europe and USA.1
In India a study reported heightened adverse events among the elderly using a modeling algorithm.32 It
is well known that NCD risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes as well as NCDs increase with age,

also in India,33 and this could be a reason of greater COVID-19 related deaths in more urbanized and
better developed states as observed in the present study (Table 3). Average life expectancy of all these
states is significantly greater than those states where the disease burden is lower.26 A macrolevel
analysis from India previously reported greater case-fatality in states with greater aging population.21 In
USA, a study reported macrolevel association of COVID-19 burden and case-fatality with air pollution,
gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and urbanization.34 Another country-level macroecological
study reported association of COVID-19 burden and mortality with national GDP, urbanization,
population density, number of tourists in a country and geographic longitude.35 Influence of
demographic and socioeconomic factors in the COVID-19 case-fatality rate globally was examined
among 10.5 million cases in 209 countries. Doubling in size of population, proportion of female smokers,
higher stringency index and active testing policies were associated with higher case-fatality rate while
inverse association was found between cardiovascular disease death rate and diabetes prevalence.36 In
the present study we did not find any association of case-fatality rates in different Indian states with
various NCD risk factors and social indices (data not shown) and therefore we have not commented on
this issue. No sub-national studies, similar to the present study, have been reported from developed
countries although recent surge of COVID-19 in rural locations in USA, where the NCDs as well as risk
factors are significantly greater,37 suggest such an association.38 More studies in different geographic
locations are needed.
In the present study, association of COVID-19 with sociodemographic factors such as
urbanization and other indices of development and better healthcare access and quality indices indicate
better diagnosis of the condition in these locations.1 In lesser developed states of the country as well as
rural areas of India it is likely that the condition is not diagnosed well due to lack of access to quality
healthcare.39 Undiagnosed COVID-19 related deaths in the rural hinterlands of the country are also
possible.40 Possible gaps in COVID-19 data from India has been highlighted.41 Other limitations of our
analyses are absence of detailed readily available cause-specific morbidity and mortality data, lack of
population based registries of COVID-19 cases and deaths, absence of concurrent mortality data to
evaluate excess deaths from COVID-19 and absence of other collinear data.
Our study shows that COVID-19 burden is significantly greater in more developed and urbanized
states of the country where there is a greater prevalence of NCD risk factors. These findings have
important implications for prioritization of deployment of preventive strategies and vaccinations. Large
scale government-led non-pharmaceutical prevention strategies that have proven effective in COVID-19

control include mandatory mask-wearing in public spaces, limited public gatherings (<100 or <10 people
depending on context), closure of non-essential businesses, schools and universities, and stay at home
orders with appropriate exemptions.42 Individual level non-pharmacological interventions include
proper masking, physical distancing and avoiding crowded spaces. Although, vaccines have become
available and need scientifically appropriate strategies to achieve maximum impact and development of
population-level immunity.43,44 Equitable vaccine distribution is essential.45 However, in the present
macrolevel scenario highlighted in this report we posit that more developed states, who are at forefront
of the COVID-19 epidemic, need non-pharmacological interventions as well as vaccines more than the
lesser developed.
