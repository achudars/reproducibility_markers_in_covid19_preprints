Abstract (260 words):

Background: Famotidine has been posited as a potential treatment for COVID-19. We compared the
incidence of COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., death; and death or intensive services use) among hospitalized
famotidine users vs. proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) users, hydroxychloroquine users or famotidine nonusers separately.
Methods: We constructed a retrospective cohort study using data from COVID-19 Premier Hospital
electronic health records. Study population were COVID-19 hospitalized patients aged 18 years or older.
Famotidine, PPI and hydroxychloroquine exposure groups were defined as patients dispensed any
medication containing one of the three drugs on the day of admission. The famotidine non-user group
was derived from the same source population with no history of exposure to any drug with famotidine
as an active ingredient prior to or on the day of admission. Time-at-risk was defined based on the
intention-to-treat principle starting 1 day after admission to 30 days after admission. For each study
comparison group, we fit a propensity score (PS) model through large-scale regularized logistic
regression. The outcome was modeled using a survival model.
Results: We identified 2193 users of PPI, 5950 users of the hydroxychloroquine, 1816 users of
famotidine and 26,820 non-famotidine users. After PS stratification, the hazard ratios for death were as
follows: famotidine vs no famotidine HR 1.03 (0.89-1.18); vs PPIs: HR 1.14 (0.94-1.39); vs
hydroxychloroquine:1.03 (0.85-1.24). Similar results were observed for the risk of death or intensive
services use.
Conclusion: We found no evidence of a reduced risk of COVID-19 outcomes among hospitalized COVID19 patients who used famotidine compared to those who did not or compared to PPI or
hydroxychloroquine users.

Introduction:

Famotidine, a specific histamine- type 2 receptor antagonist that suppresses gastric acid production, has
been proposed as an attractive candidate for COVID-19 treatment, based on the potential role that the
histamine pathway may play in immune modulation and its long history of safe use .

SARS-CoV-2 virus infection can induce histamine release via aberrant mast cell activation. The
pathological histamine release has a potential to provoke the excessive synthesis of proinflammatory
cytokines that may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome observed in patients with severe COVID19 . The finding of lower levels of inflammatory markers (e.g. C-reactive protein, ferritin, etc.) in
famotidine-treated patients with COVID-19 suggests that the drug can dampen an uncontrolled
proinflammatory immune response. This has prompted recent studies to postulate that the above effect
of famotidine can be mediated via the antagonism and/or inverse agonism of histamine type 2 receptors
. In another bioinformatics study, Wu et al identified famotidine as one of the drugs most likely to
inhibit the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), which processes proteins essential for viral
replication. Furthermore, famotidine has been shown in vitro to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus
replication . Famotidine is currently being tested under an IND waiver for treating COVID-19 in a double
blind randomized clinical trial at high intravenous doses (360 mg/day) in combination with either
hydroxychloroquine or remdesivir (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04370262).

Recently, several observational studies have investigated the effect of famotidine on COVID-19
outcomes but have been limited to single-institutional explorations of small samples with varying
statistical methods and inconsistent results. Freedberg et al reported that 84 patients receiving
famotidine during a hospital stay, had a significantly reduced risk of death or intubation when compared
to patients who did not . Another study using electronic health data from Hartford hospital, included
83 patients receiving famotidine, and produced similar estimates . Additionally, a sequential case series
suggested benefits of famotidine treatment in an outpatient setting . In contrast to these findings, a
territory-wide study in Hong Kong found no significant association between severe COVID-19 disease
and use of famotidine .

Real world data can potentially provide critical and timely evidence on the effectiveness of famotidine
on improving COVID-19 outcomes. However, the design and interpretation of an observational
population-level effect estimation study might be challenging. The appropriateness in the selection of a
comparator and adequacy of adjustment of baseline covariates can impact the risk of selection bias and
confounding. Given the recency of this pandemic, assessments are further challenged by insufficient
sample size, which introduces random error and also can limit the fidelity of any statistical adjustment
performance.
Using real world data from a large national database on hospitalized patients with COVID-19, we aimed
to estimate and compare the incidence of COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., death; and death or intensive
services) among hospitalized famotidine users vs. proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) users,
hydroxychloroquine users or famotidine non-users separately.
Methods:

We conducted a prevalent-user comparative retrospective cohort study measuring the association
between famotidine use and severity of COVID-19 outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19

Data Source

The study population was comprised of hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 available in
the COVID-19 Premier Hospital Database (PHD). The PHD contains complete clinical coding, hospital
cost, and patient billing data from approximately 700 hospitals throughout the United States. It captures
from 20 to 25% of all inpatient admissions in the US. Premier collects de-identified data from
participating hospitals in its health care alliance. The hospitals included are nationally representative
based on bed size, geographic region, location (urban/rural) and teaching hospital status. The database
contains medications administered during the hospitalization; laboratory, diagnostic, and therapeutic
services; and primary and secondary diagnoses for each patient’s hospitalization. Identifier-linked
enrollment files provide demographic and payor information. Detailed service-level information for each
hospital day is recorded; this includes details on medication and devices received. All data were
standardized to the Observational Health and Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Observational
Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) version 5.3. The full description of
the extract, transform and load of the data can be found here:
https://github.com/OHDSI/ETLCDMBuilder/blob/master/man/PREMIER/Premier_ETL_CDM_V5_3.doc.
PHD contains deidentified patient information, is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA) compliant, and is considered exempt from institutional review board (IRB) approval .

Study period and follow -up

The study period started from 02/01/2020 and ended at the latest available date for all data in 2020
(05/30/2020). Figure 1. illustrates the retrospective study design schematic. As illustrated in Figure 1,
follow-up for each of the cohorts started at an index date defined by the first inpatient admission (day
0). Time-at-risk was defined based on the intention-to-treat principle starting 1 day after admission and
continuing up until the first of: outcome of interest, loss to follow-up or 30 days after admission.
Study population

We included patients aged 18 years or older with an inpatient visit occurring after 02-01-2020; a
condition, measurement or observation indicative of COVID-19 during or within 21 days prior to
admission. Patients with evidence of intensive services (i.e., mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy or
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) at or within 30 days prior to admission were excluded.
Exposures, outcomes and confounders

Famotidine, PPI and hydroxychloroquine exposure groups were defined as patients dispensed any
medication containing one of the three drugs of interest -as an ingredient- on the day of admission.
Patients who received both famotidine and any of the comparator drugs on day of admission were
excluded. The famotidine non-user group was derived from the same source population (participants)

with no history of exposure to any drug with famotidine as an active ingredient prior to or on the day of
admission.
Outcomes of interest were death, identified based on patient discharge status within admission records,
and death or intensive services (combined). Intensive services were defined as any condition, procedure
or observation code indicative of mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy or extracorporeal membrane
oxygenation. The code list used to identify study participants, exposures and outcomes can be found

studies/Covid19EstimationFamotidine/blob/master/Protocol/Annex%20I%20%20Concept%20Set%20Expressions.xlsx
Statistical methods

To adjust for potential measured confounding and improve the balance between comparison cohorts,
we built large-scale propensity score (PS) models for each comparison using regularized regression (Tian,
Schuemie, and Suchard 2018). We used a Laplace prior (LASSO) with the optimal hyperparameter to fit
the model, determined through 10-fold cross validation in which the outcome is a binary indicator for
the potential comparator. This process used a large set of predefined baseline patient characteristics,
including patient demographics (i.e., gender, age, index month) and all observed conditions within 30
days prior to or on admission. For computational efficiency, we excluded all features that occurred in
fewer than 0.1% of patients within the target and comparator cohorts prior to PS model fitting. For the
main analysis, we stratified into 5 PS strata and used conditional Cox proportional hazards models to
estimate hazard ratios (HRs) between target and alternative comparator treatments for the risk of each
outcome. The regression for the outcome models conditioned on the PS strata with treatment as the
sole explanatory variable.
As a sensitivity analysis, we utilized a 1:1 PS matching and used an unconditional Cox proportional
hazards model to estimate HRs in the matched set. We declared a HR as significantly different from no
effect when its p < 0.05 without correcting for multiple testing.
Blinded to the results, the study team evaluated study diagnostics for these treatment comparisons to
assess if they were likely to yield unbiased estimates. The suite of diagnostics included (1) minimum
detectible risk ratio (MDRR), (2) preference score (a transformation of the PS that adjusts for prevalence
differences between populations) distributions to evaluate empirical equipoise and population
generalizability, (3) extensive patient characteristics to evaluate cohort balance before and after PSadjustment. We defined target and comparator cohorts to achieve sufficient balance if all afteradjustment baseline characteristics return absolute standardized mean differences (SMD) < 0.1 .

Results:

Population and incidence

A total of 2193 users of PPI, 5950 users of the hydroxychloroquine, 1816 users of famotidine and 26,820
non-famotidine users were identified in the data and were eligible for the study. Table 1 illustrates
patient cohort size, follow up duration, incidence of the two outcomes and MDRR for each
famotidine/drug comparison for the PS stratified analysis. Among the famotidine group, a total of 1,331
(73.29%) and 374 (20.59%) patients received a dose of 20 and 40 mg of famotidine on the day of
admission, respectively. Furthermore, 1,155 (63.60%) and 709 (39.04%) patients received oral and IV
formulations of famotidine on the day of admission, respectively, with 1.4% (n=25) of patients receiving
both oral and IV formulations.
Famotidine users versus PPI users

After PS stratification, a total of 1,527 COVID-19 patients exposed to famotidine were compared to
1,855 patients exposed to PPI. Among famotidine users, the incidence of death alone was 12.83% (196
patients) vs 15.20% (282 patients) among PPI users. The incidence of death or intensive services
(combined) was 18.96% (298 patients) vs 22.10% (410 patients) among famotidine and PPI users
respectively.
Famotidine users versus hydroxychloroquine users

After PS stratification, A total of 1,186 COVID-19 patients exposed to famotidine were compared to
5,047 patients exposed to hydroxychloroquine. Among famotidine users, the incidence of death alone
was 13.40% (159 patients) vs 13.59% (686 patients) among hydroxychloroquine users. The incidence of
death or intensive services (combined) was 20.07% (238 patients) vs 22.10% (1077 patients) among
famotidine and hydroxychloroquine users respectively.
Famotidine users versus non-users

After PS stratification, A total of 1,623 COVID-19 patients exposed to famotidine were compared to
24,404 patients in the famotidine non-user group. Among famotidine users, the incidence of death
alone was 13.19% (214 patients) vs 16.09% (3923 patients) among non-users. The incidence of death or
intensive services (combined) was 20.09% (326 patients) vs 22.68% (5534 patients) among famotidine
users and non-users respectively.
Characteristics of patients

Selected baseline characteristics of famotidine users compared to PPI users before and after PS
stratification are shown in Table 2. Compared to PPI users, prior to propensity score adjustment,
famotidine users were younger and had fewer comorbid conditions (based on (SMD) > 0.1). Specifically,

PPI users were more likely to have chronic liver diseases, chronic obstructive lung disease,
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hyperlipidemia, lesion of liver,
osteoarthritis, renal impairment, rheumatoid arthritis, viral hepatitis C and cardiovascular disease.
Selected baseline characteristics of famotidine users compared hydroxychloroquine users and to
famotidine non-users, before and after PS stratification, are shown in Supplement Tables 1 and 2
respectively. Compared to hydroxychloroquine users, prior to propensity score adjustment, famotidine
users were more likely to be females, have GERD, some cardiovascular diseases, urinary tract infections
and depressive disorder but less likely to have pneumonia. Compared to non-users, famotidine users
were less likely to be in the older age group (85-89 years) but were more likely to have GERD.
PS model adjustment and cohort balance

More than 2400 baseline patients’ characteristics were available for PS adjustment. After large-scale PS
stratification or matching, SMDs for most baseline characteristics were <0.1. In the PPI comparison, SMD
exceeded 0.1 for 21 covariates after PS stratification, including gastrointestinal hemorrhage, anemia due
to blood loss, melena, pregnancy and pregnancy complications, venous varices, diaphragmatic hernia
and chronic pulmonary edema. In the hydroxychloroquine comparison, the SMD exceeded 0.1 for the
following covariates; age group 30-34, venous varices, distention of vein, ectactic vein, pneumonia and
influenza. In the famotidine non-users comparison, all SMDs for baseline characteristics were less than
0.1 after PS stratification. For all baseline characteristics before and after PS adjustment for famotidine
users compared to PPI users are plotted in Figure 2. For all baseline characteristics before and after PS
adjustment for famotidine users compared to hydroxychloroquine users and to famotidine non-users
before and after PS stratification are plotted in Supplement Figures 1, 2 respectively. The complete list
of baseline characteristics before and after matching is available in the study link above, under the tab
Covariate balance.
Risk of death and death or intensive services

HRs for the relative risk of incidence of death and death or intensive services are presented in Table 3
for the PS stratified and PS matched analyses. The risk of death was not significantly different among
famotidine users compared to PPI users with PS stratification (HR 1.14, 95%CI 0.94-1.39). Similarly, the
risk of death or intensive services (combined) was similar among the two groups (HR 1.13, 95%CI 0.961.32) after PS stratification. When comparing famotidine users to hydroxychloroquine, both the risk of
death (HR 1.03, 95% 0.85-1.24) and the risk of death or intensive services (combined) (HR 1.05, 95%
0.90-1.22) were similar between groups after PS stratification. Finally, when comparing famotidine users
to non-users, no significant difference in the risk of death (HR 1.03, 95% 0.89-1.18) or the risk of death
or intensive services (combined) (HR 1.03, 95% 0.95-1.15) was observed after PS stratification. PS
matching HRs followed the same trend.

Discussion:

Using real-world data from a large multi-institutional hospital database, we found no evidence of a
reduced risk of death among hospitalized COVID-19 patients who used famotidine compared to those

who did not or compared to PPI or hydroxychloroquine users. Similarly, there was no observed effect on
the composite outcome of death or intensive services when comparing famotidine users to patients in
the three comparator groups.
Prior literature on safety and mortality outcomes among COVID-19 patients treated with famotidine is
limited to a series of small single-institution studies, and results from these studies are conflicting.
Freedberg, et al found that after PS matching, patients who used famotidine (84 users) were at
reduced risk of death or intubation (combined outcome) with a HR of 0.43 (95% CI 0.21-0.88) . Another
retrospective observational study found that when comparing hospitalized COVID-19 patients who
received famotidine (83 patients) to those who did not, famotidine users were at reduced risk of inhospital mortality (odds ratio OR 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.16–0.86, P = 0.021) and combined
death or intubation (OR 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.23–0.96, P = 0.040) . However, results from a
retrospective cohort study conducted on 51 patients in Hong Kong found no significant association
between severe COVID-19 disease and use of famotidine compared to non-users (OR:1.34, 95% CI:0.24–
6.06; p=0.72) . These findings, both for positive and no association, could be potentially attributed to
confounding and selection bias in comparator selection, two sources of systematic error that our study
sought to address.

We implemented large scale PS adjustment to account for possible measured confounding. We
implemented a set of study diagnostics and included 3 different comparators to increase our confidence
in the study findings. However, residual confounding due to unobserved factors, such as pre-admission
drug use, may still exist, as evidenced by having some SMDs>0.10 even after propensity score
adjustment. While PHD contains hospital data from multiple institutions, this study still represents
results from one data source and further replication across other sources would increase confidence in
the findings. Our study did not consider strength or dose or duration of exposure for any of the
exposures and may not generalize to the high dose exposure under investigation in the ongoing clinical
trial or in other clinical contexts outside of hospital admission. However, our study findings reflect the
real-world use of famotidine in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and suggests further evidence is needed
to demonstrate its real-world effectiveness.
