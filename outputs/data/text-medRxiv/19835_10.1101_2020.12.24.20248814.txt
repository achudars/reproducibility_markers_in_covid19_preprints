Recently, multiple novel strains of SARS-CoV-2 have been found to share the same deletion of
amino acids H69 and V70 in the virus S gene. This includes strain B.1.1.7 / SARS-CoV-2 VUI
202012/01, which has been found to be more infectious than other strains of SARS-CoV-2, and
its increasing presence has resulted in new lockdowns in and travel restrictions leaving the UK.
Here, we analyze 2 million RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests performed at Helix to identify the rate of
S gene dropout, which has been recently shown to occur in tests from individuals infected with
strains of SARS-CoV-2 that carry the H69del/V70del mutation. We observe a rise in S gene
dropout in the US starting in early October, with 0.25% of our daily SARS-CoV-2-positive tests
exhibiting this pattern during the first week. The rate of positive samples with S gene dropout
has grown slowly over time, with last week exhibiting the highest level yet, at 0.5%. Focusing on
the 14 states for which we have sufficient sample size to assess the frequency of this rare event
(n>1000 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples), we see a recent expansion in the Eastern part of the
US, concentrated in MA, OH, and FL. However, we cannot say from these data whether the S
gene dropout samples we observe here represent the B.1.1.7. strain. Only with an expansion of
genomic surveillance sequencing in the US will we know for certain the prevalence of the
B.1.1.7 strain in the US.

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been concern about novel SARS-CoV-2
mutations emerging that are more transmissible. Recently, multiple novel strains of
SARS-CoV-2 have been found to share the same deletion of amino acids H69 and V70 in the
virus S gene. At least some of these strains are hypothesized to have increased
transmissibility, and some have been found to infect both minks and humans​1,2​. This includes
strain B.1.1.7 / SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01, which has been found to be more infectious than
other strains of SARS-CoV-2, and its increasing presence has resulted in new lockdowns in and
travel restrictions leaving the UK 3–5​
​ . The B.1.1.7 strain has not yet been found in the United
States, but viral sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 for surveillance purposes has been very limited
and performed on only a relatively small number of samples.
The Helix​®​ COVID-19 Test includes amplification of three viral genes: Orf1ab, N and the S
genes​6​. A recent preprint has shown that deletion of H69 and V70 can be characterized by a
dropout of the S gene in standard and widely used RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests​7​. This analysis
technique can therefore serve as a proxy to detect infections driven by these newly emerging
sequence variants. Given the new information about the link between S gene dropout and the
H69del/V70del mutation, together with the concern over increased transmissibility of the B.1.1.7
strain, we examined the prevalence of S gene dropout in 2 million samples from across the US
tested at Helix.
We observe a rise in S gene dropout starting in early October, with 0.25% of our daily
SARS-CoV-2-positive tests exhibiting this pattern during the first week (Figure 1). The rate of
positive samples with S gene dropout has grown slowly over time, with last week exhibiting the
highest level yet at 0.5% of SARS-CoV-2-positive tests that are consistent with the
H69del/V70del variant.

Figure 1. Weekly observations of S gene dropout. ​ The raw number of tests per week with S
gene dropout (left), as well as normalized by the number of positive tests (right), indicates that
the presence of the H69del/V70del or potentially other S gene variants is increasing in our
tested population.

Since we test samples from all 50 states in our laboratory, we examined the nationwide
distribution of these S gene dropout positive samples as well as state-level trends (Figure 2).
We have observed S gene dropout positive samples in 19 states so far. Focusing on the 14
states for which we have sufficient sample size to assess the frequency of this rare event
(n>1000 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples), we see a recent expansion in the Eastern part of the
US, concentrated in MA, OH, and FL.

Figure 2. US cumulative distribution of S gene dropout-positive SARS-CoV-2 tests as of
Dec 20, 2020. ​Values indicate percent of positive tests with S gene dropout. To ensure that low
sample sizes do not skew frequencies, only states with more than 1,000 SARS-CoV-2 positive
tests are shown. States with insufficient data are shown in gray. Additional states with S gene
dropout, but with <1K positives in our dataset thus far are: AL, ME, NH, NY, RI, VA. An
animated graphic showing the percent of positive samples over time can be found at
https://blog.helix.com/sars-cov2_uk-variant/.
As mentioned above, the H69del/V70del variant has been reported in many viral strains
available from Nextstrain, which depicts SARS-CoV-2 sequence evolution for epidemiological
surveillance​8​. Yet, as of today, only 25 individuals with this variant have been sequenced in the
US since March, with all but three found prior to July (when we began testing at Helix)​9​. The rise
in S gene dropout in our positive samples in early October is consistent with the rise of
H69del/V70del variation globally in recent weeks, including the B.1.1.7 strain that is taking hold
in the UK.

B.1.1.7 harbors several variants, including the H69del/V70del, but it is unknown which are
causing the rise in transmission. We cannot say if the S gene dropout samples we observe here
represent the B.1.1.7. strain which harbors the N501Y variant that is said to bind the virus to
human cells more tightly, nor ​P681H​ that likely affects biological function. Given the
exceptionally low fraction of positives that we observe with this variant today, only with an
expansion of genomic surveillance sequencing in the US will we know for certain if the B.1.1.7
strain has arrived in the US.
Limitations:
- Following the conservative approach from Bal et al.​7​, for this analysis we only analyzed
positive samples with strong amplification of the N gene (Ct < 25), and dropout samples
with absolutely no S gene detected. Because some samples may have lower viral titer,
and therefore result in a weaker amplification signal, we are not analyzing all positive
samples here. Therefore, the final fraction of dropouts may differ slightly.
- Since samples are deidentified prior to analysis, and some individuals may test more
than once, there may be some duplicate individuals that could cause deviation from the
true population fraction
- Testing per state does not reflect the population distribution of the US, and therefore
some states without S gene dropout may be false negatives.
- As we do not store samples longitudinally, we are unable to perform viral sequencing to
confirm that our S gene dropouts are indeed deletions of amino acids H69 and V70.
However, the method used here showed 100% concordance between observed S gene
dropout and deletion in viral sequence in the original manuscript.
- Without sequencing, we cannot distinguish between the different viral lineages that carry
the H69del/V70del variant. This variant is present in at least three major clades since
Oct 2020, including B.1.1.7.
