Abstract
Background: COVID-19 has heterogeneous manifestations, though one of the most common symptoms is a
sudden loss of smell (anosmia or hyposmia). We investigated whether olfactory loss is a reliable predictor of
COVID-19.
Methods: This preregistered, cross-sectional study used a crowdsourced questionnaire in 23 languages to
assess symptoms in individuals self-reporting recent respiratory illness. We quantified changes in
chemosensory abilities during the course of the respiratory illness using 0-100 visual analog scales (VAS) for
participants reporting a positive (C19+; n=4148) or negative (C19-; n=546) COVID-19 laboratory test outcome.
Logistic regression models identified singular and cumulative predictors of COVID-19 status and post-COVID19 olfactory recovery.

Results: Both C19+ and C19- groups exhibited smell loss, but it was significantly larger in C19+ participants
(mean±SD, C19+: -82.5±27.2 points; C19-: -59.8±37.7). Smell loss during illness was the best predictor of
COVID-19 in both single and cumulative feature models (ROC AUC=0.72), with additional features providing
negligible model improvement. VAS ratings of smell loss were more predictive than binary chemosensory
yes/no-questions or other cardinal symptoms, such as fever or cough. Olfactory recovery within 40 days was
reported for ~50% of participants and was best predicted by time since illness onset.
Conclusions: As smell loss is the best predictor of COVID-19, we developed the ODoR-19 tool, a 0-10 scale
to screen for recent olfactory loss. Numeric ratings ≤2 indicate high odds of symptomatic COVID-19
(4<OR<10), which can be deployed when viral lab tests are impractical or unavailable.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic has left a staggering level
of morbidity, mortality, and societal and economic disruption in its wake.1 Early publications2–8 indicate that
sudden smell and taste loss are cardinal, early and potentially specific symptoms of COVID-19,9 including in
otherwise asymptomatic individuals.10–13 While fever and cough are common symptoms of diverse viral
infections, the potential specificity of early chemosensory loss to COVID-19 could make it valuable in screening
and diagnosis.
Anosmia and other chemosensory disorders have serious health and quality-of-life consequences for patients.
However, the general lack of awareness of anosmia and other chemosensory disorders by clinicians and the
public, including their association with upper respiratory infections,14 contributed to an underappreciated role of
chemosensory symptoms in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Additionally, the impact of smell loss as a clinical
consequence of COVID-19 has not been adequately addressed. Thus, there is an urgent need to better define
the chemosensory dysfunctions associated with COVID-19 and to determine their relevance as predictors of
this disease. It is critical to develop rapid clinical tools to efficiently and effectively integrate chemosensory
assessments into COVID-19 screening and treatment protocols. Information on the duration and reversibility of
post-COVID-19 chemosensory impairment is also lacking.
We used binary, categorical and continuous self-report measures to determine the chemosensory phenotype,
along with other symptoms and characteristics, of COVID-19-positive (C19+) and COVID-19-negative (C19-)
individuals who had reported recent symptoms of respiratory illness. Using those results in logistic regression
models, we identified predictors of COVID-19 and recovery from smell loss. Finally, we propose the Olfactory
Determination Rating scale for COVID-19 (ODoR-19), a quick, simple-to-use, telemedicine-friendly tool to
improve the utility of current COVID-19 screening protocols, particularly when access to rapid testing for
SARS-CoV-2
is
limited.

Methods
Study design
This preregistered,15 cross-sectional online study was approved by the Office of Research Protections of The
Pennsylvania State University (STUDY00014904); it is in accordance with the revised Declaration of Helsinki,
and compliant with privacy laws in the U.S.A. and European Union. Data reported here were collected between
April 7 and July 3, 2020 from the Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research (GCCR) core questionnaire
(Appendix 1 and https://gcchemosensr.org),8 an online crowdsourced survey deployed in 32 languages that
used binary response and categorical questions (e.g. Appendix 1, Questions 6,9) and visual analog scales
(e.g., Appendix 1, Question 13) to measure self-reported chemosensory ability and other symptoms in adults
with current or recent respiratory illness. Data reported here include responses in Arabic, Bengali, Chinese
(Simplified and Traditional), Danish, Dutch, English, Farsi, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi,
Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and Urdu.

A convenience sample of 52,334 volunteers accessed the GCCR questionnaire; 25,620 mett eligibility

lying preregistered exclusion criteria, 15,747 participants were included in reported analyses (Figure 1).

Based on the self-reported outcome of a COVID-19 lab test, participants were labeled as eithe

(positive result) or C19- (negative result). The specific collider bias characterizing this sample (high fraction

C19+ participants and high prevalence of chemosensory disorders in both groups) underestimates the

correlation between smell loss and COVID-19 (Figure S1). Thus, it represents a conservative scenario

sample underestimates the positive association between smell loss and C19+ (Figure S1, Table S1). The
country-wise fraction of C19+ participants is correlated (r~0.45) when responses from the same calendar week
are aligned (Figure S2). These findings are in line with other comparisons between crowdsourced versus
representative health data,16 confirming that trends identified in crowdsourced data reasonably approximate
population data. Because the GCCR cohort is not demographically balanced, it should not be used to estimate
prevalence. However, the representative YouGov cohort indicates globally ~33% of C19+ individuals report
smell loss (Table S1).

Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed in Python 3.7.6 using the pandas,17 scikit-learn,18 and statsmodels19
packages. The data and annotated code is included as supplemental material and will be publicly available on
GitHub (http://github.com/GCCR/GCCR002) upon publication. Missing values for covariates used in prediction
models of COVID-19 status and smell recovery were imputed as follows: binary features = 0.5, numeric
features = median, categorical variables = “Missing”. Prediction targets themselves were never imputed.
Responses incompatible with model generalization (e.g., open ended questions) were excluded. A one-hot
encoding was applied to all categorical variables to produce binary indicators of category membership. L1regularized logistic regression (penalty α=1) consistently produced sparse models with comparable crossvalidation accuracy and were therefore the prediction test of choice. Model quality was measured using
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC). Cross-validation was performed in 100
random splits of 80% training set and 20% test set, and ROC curves are concatenated over each test set.
ROC curves are computed on predicted probabilities from each model, circumventing the high-cardinality bias
of AUC. For single feature models, AUC is independent of most modeling details, including all rank-invariant
decisions. To correctly compute p-values for model coefficients, the normalized data were standardized (mean
0, variance 1) and then coefficients back-transformed to normalized form after fitting.

Results
Chemosensory loss associates with COVID-19
A preregistered replication of our prior study8 confirmed that reported smell, taste, and chemesthesis abilities
drop significantly in both lab-tested C19+ participants and those diagnosed by clinical assessment (Figure S3,
Table S2).
Next, we compared lab-tested C19+ and C19- participants. C19+ participants reported a greater loss of
smell (C19+: -82.5±27.2 points; C19-: -59.8±37.7 points; p=2.2e-46, extreme evidence of difference:
BF10=8.97e+61; Figure 2A,B; Table S3), taste (C19+: -71.6±31.8 points; C19-: -55.2±37.5 points; p=6.7e-26,
extreme evidence of difference: BF10=6.67e+24; Figure 2C,D; Table S3) and chemesthesis ability (C19+: 36.8±37.1 points; C19-: -28.7±37.1 points; p=1.6e-07, extreme evidence of difference: BF10=3182; Figure
2E,F; Table S3). However, both groups reported a similar degree of nasal obstruction (Figure 2G,H; Table
S3). Self-reported changes in smell, taste, and chemesthesis were highly correlated within both groups (C19+:
0.71<r<0.83; C19-: 0.76<r<0.87) and orthogonal to nasal obstruction changes (C19+: r=-0.20; C19-: r=-0.13).

Prediction of COVID-19 status from survey responses
Binary (yes/no) and categorical reported symptoms suggested that COVID-19 is more strongly associated with
chemosensory than with non-chemosensory symptoms, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath,
cardinal symptoms currently highlighted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)(Figure
3A). Using AUC to assess prediction quality (Figure 3B), we found that self-reported smell ability during
illness, reported on a continuous scale, was the most predictive survey question for COVID-19
status(AUC=0.71). Changes in smell as a result of illness (the difference between smell ability during and
before illness) was similarly predictive (AUC=0.69). Changes in taste ability (assessed via rating) were the next
most predictive features (AUC=0.64-0.65) (Figure 3B). Models fit to the same data but with shuffled COVID-19
status consistently produced AUC~0.5 for all features. The most predictive non-chemosensory symptom, sore
throat (which was negatively associated with COVID-19) was substantially less predictive (AUC=0.58) than the
top chemosensory symptoms. Nasal obstruction was not predictive (AUC=0.52). Responses given on a
continuous scale were more predictive (AUC=0.71) than binary responses to parallel questions (e.g.,
Appendix 1, Question 13 versus 14, FigureS5) (AUC=0.60-0.62), likely because a continuous scale contains
a greater amount of diagnostic information (Figure S4).
Next, we examined which simple multi-feature model would best predict COVID-19 status. As some
questions have highly correlated responses, the question most complementary to “Smell during illness” is
unlikely to be one that carries redundant information. Adding “Days since onset of respiratory symptoms”
(DOS) to “Smell during illness” (Smell Only) produced the largest incremental gain in predictive performance
(AUC=0.72, +0.01 versus the Smell Only model) (Figure 3C).
We directly compared the Smell Only+DOS model to other candidate models. The Smell Only+DOS
model (Figure 3D) yielded an equal or higher AUC than the model including the three cardinal CDC symptoms
(AUC=0.55) or the full model using 70 features (AUC=0.72). Because the Smell Only+DOS model exhibits the
same AUC as the full model it strikes a good balance between model parsimony and predictive accuracy for
C19+. However, the Smell Only model also offers reasonable sensitivity of 0.85 (at specificity=0.51, cutoff=13
on the 100-point VAS) and/or specificity of 0.75 (at sensitivity=0.51, cutoff=1) as desired. By sharp contrast,
fever has a sensitivity of only 0.54 with specificity of 0.49 and dry cough has sensitivity of 0.52 and specificity
of 0.46.

Recovery from smell loss
Recovery from smell loss was modest (approximately half the initial average loss) in C19+ participants with full
or partial resolution of respiratory symptoms. Overall, self-reported, post-illness olfactory ability was still lower
for C19+ (39.9±34.7) than C19- (52.2±35.2, p=2.8e-11, Figure S6A). However, the mean recovery of smell
(after illness relative to during illness) was greater for C19+ (30.5±35.7) than C19- (24.6±31.9, p=0.0002,
Figure S6B). A similar but smaller effect of COVID-19 status on recovery was observed for taste (Figure S6C,
D), while little to no association with COVID-19 was observed for recovery of chemesthesis (Figure S6E,F) or
nasal obstruction (Figure S6G,H). When illness-induced change in olfactory function (during minus before
illness) and recovery of olfactory function (after minus during illness) were evaluated, we identified three
respondent clusters: those self-reporting no loss of smell (Intact Smell), those reporting recovery from smell
loss (Recovered Smell), and those reporting smell loss without recovery by up to 40 days (Persistent Smell
Loss, Figure 4, Table S3). Intact smell was reported by only 8.5% of the participants in the C19+ group but by
27.5% in the C19- group (p=3.8e-31). A greater proportion of C19+ participants were included in both the
Recovered Smell group (C19+: 40.9%, C19-: 33.3%; p=4.9e-10) and the Persistent Smell Loss group (C19+:
50.7%, C19-: 39.2%; p=5e-5; Figure 4A, B). C19+ participants in both the Recovered Smell and Persistent
Smell Loss clusters reported a similar extent of olfactory loss, irrespective of time since respiratory symptom
onset. By contrast, the rate of self-reported smell recovery increased over time, with a plateau at 30 days
(Figure 4C). Finally, DOS was the best predictor (AUC=0.62) between the Persistent Smell Loss and the
Recovered Smell groups (Figure S6A, Table S3).

Simple screening for COVID-19: the Olfactory Determination Rating scale in
COVID-19 (ODoR-19) (136)
Our results indicate that a continuous rating of current olfactory function is the single best predictor of COVID19 and improves the discrimination between C19+ and C19- over a binary question on smell loss. For
example, the Smell Only model can reach a specificity of 0.83 at the low end of the VAS (sensitivity=0.36,
cutoff=0). We propose here a numeric variation of the rating scale (0-10), the ODoR-19, that can be
administered in person or via telemedicine to improve early COVID-19 screening for individuals without
preexisting smell and/or taste disorders. Responses to the ODoR-19 scale ≤2 indicate high odds of COVID-19
positivity (4<OR<10, Figure 5D). An ODoR-19 response of 3 indicates a borderline risk (OR=1.2).

Discussion
Self-reported smell loss was more common in C19+ than C19- participants, but present in both
th groups.
The use of a VAS to assess olfactory loss better predicted COVID-19 status than using a binary questi
stion. We
found that the best predictor of COVID-19-associated smell recovery, within the time frame captured
ed by the
survey (~40 days), was days since onset of COVID-19.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires healthcare providers and contact tracers to quickly and reliably
assess an individual’s COVID-19 risk, often remotely. Thus, reliable screening tools are critical to assess a
person’s likelihood of having COVID-19 and to justify self-quarantine and/or testing recommendations. Indeed,
some reports suggest that COVID-19-associated smell loss might be an indicator of disease severity.2,20
Current symptom criteria (e.g., fever, dry cough) are less specific than severe olfactory loss. Indeed, the value
of our ODoR-19 tool lies in the high specificity of values ≤2 for indicating COVID-19 positivity, therefore
representing a valuable addition to the current repertoire of COVID-19 screening tools. Those who receive a
negative outcome from a COVID-19 viral test, yet report significant idiopathic smell loss, should be considered
as high-priority candidates for COVID-19 re-testing.
Our online survey and sampling methodology likely selected participants with a heightened interest in
smell and taste and/or their disturbances. This self-selection bias could be viewed as a limitation since the
C19- group also showed chemosensory loss. However, finding difference between groups in a sample with a
higher barrier for discriminating between C19+ and C19- supports the robustness of this tool when used in a
typical clinical population; our collider bias analysis also suggests that our findings are likely conservative
estimates (Figure S1, Table S1).
Our results suggest that chemosensory impairment has strong COVID-19 predictive value and is useful
when access to viral testing is limited or absent. As with any self-report measure, veracity of self-reports
cannot be guaranteed. However, the ability to screen individuals in real-time should outweigh this potential
confound.21 While objective smell tests are the gold standard for assessing olfactory function,22,23 they are
costly, time-consuming to administer, and can require in-person interactions with potentially infectious
patients.23,24 By contrast, the ODoR-19 is free, quick, and can be administered in person or remotely. We
cannot exclude that our C19- sample contains COVID-19 false negatives.25 However, self-reported smell
during illness distinguishes between C19+ and C19-, but not between randomly shuffled cases, suggesting
that the difference between C19+ and C19-, even in a sample with over-represented chemosensory
dysfunction, is substantial and can be captured via self-report.
Approximately half of the participants in the C19+ group recovered their sense of smell within 40 days
from the onset of respiratory symptoms. This suggests the presence of at least two subgroups of patients: one
that recovers quickly (<40 days, 40.9%) and another that may present a more variable time course of recovery
(50.7%). Since these data are collected before the full recovery of all symptoms, we cannot offer a complete
picture of recovery from olfactory loss in COVID-19-positive individuals, but they align with other early
reports.26 The COVID-19 pandemic will greatly increase the number of patients suffering from anosmia and
other chemosensory disorders,27 conditions that significantly affect quality-of-life,28,29 dietary behavior,30
cardiovascular health,31 and mental health.32,33 Thus, it is necessary to prepare healthcare providers to address
the long-term needs of these patients.
Based on our results, we propose the use of the ODoR-19 tool, a quick, free, and effective smell-based
screening method for COVID-19. This 0-10 rating scale accurately predicts COVID-19 in individuals without
pre-existing smell and taste disorders (e.g., from head trauma, chronic rhinosinusitis34). ODoR-19 combines
the utility of a continuous scale with the ease and speed needed for a screening tool. ODoR-19 is safe for
remote administration during an illness with high viral spread and can precede and complement viral testing.
This tool will improve screening for patients with limited or no access to medical care around the globe.

Collider bias results in underestimation of an association between smell loss
and COVID-19
As others have noted,35 collider bias, resulting from selection or conditioning on variables involved in the
analysis, may result in the distorted association between COVID-19 and candidate symptoms or patient
attributes. In the present sample, it is likely that we have selected for both a higher probability of COVID-19
and a higher probability of smell and taste disorders than the population at large. However, rather than leading
to an overestimation of the positive correlation between smell loss and COVID-19, collider bias is expected to
lead to an underestimation of this correlation (Figure S1). If we consider the hypothetical scenario in which
there is no association between smell loss and COVID-19 status in the general population, we would expect a
distribution similar to that depicted in Figure S1A, where the correlation between the likelihood of smell change
and likelihood of COVID-19 is r = 0. Based on our recruitment method, we expect that the participants who
elected to complete the GCCR core questionnaire were likely to have COVID-19, smell loss, or both. We can
simulate participant selection to reflect this hypothesis by censoring subjects which do not meet a fixed sum of
smell loss and COVID-19 probabilities (i.e., the red dots are excluded from the calculation of the correlation;
Figure S1B). As a result, the estimated correlation between smell loss and COVID-19 status originating from a
population with r = 0 would be negative (Figure S1B). A similar scenario would manifest if the association
between smell loss and COVID-19 status in the general population is positive (Figure S1C). Again, simulating
the removal of participants with low likelihood of having COVID-19 and/or reporting smell loss would result in a
bias of the estimated correlation towards more negative values (Figure S1D). This collider bias indicates that
the positive correlation between smell loss and C19+ is underestimated in the present sample. Indeed, a direct
comparison of the binary (y/n) smell loss questions in the two empirical samples yields an C19 odds ratio of
5.96 in the YouGov sample (Table S1) but only 4.89 for GCCR. Therefore, our analyses represent a
conservative scenario for the prediction of C19+ and C19- based on chemosensory alterations.

Column 1 includes the list of countries available in the YouGov database. Column 2 indicates the number of participants over the history
of their survey up to July 3, 2020. Minimum N=1000 per time point. Column 3 reports the percentage of participants who reported C19+.
Column 4 reports the percentage of participants who reported C19-. Columns 5-7 report the odds ratios using Smell Loss for either C19+
vs. C19- (Column 5, and as reported in Figure 5 based on the data of the GCCR survey), for C19+ vs. untested individuals (Column 6) and
C19- vs. untested individuals (Column 7). Untested individuals in YouGov's survey are those who did not report to be sick but were
contacted as representative participants of a country. Column 8 reports the probability of smell loss in the C19+ group. The first row
indicates the Global average (across countries) weighted by sample size. The global odds ratio for Smell loss calculated from a binary
question for the group C19+ vs. C19- is 6.72, which is greater than what we identify in the GCCR survey (OR for changes in smell (binary
question) = 4.89). The OR for C19+ vs. untested individuals is 58 and lowers to 11 for C19-. This confirms that smell loss is also associated
with other etiologies, but is not nearly as prevalent as in participants with C19+

How representative is the GCCR sample?
As with most COVID-19 studies,19 the sample studied here is not representative of the general population. To
better understand the extent to which this is the case, we computed a cross-correlation between GCCR and
YouGov data.36 These data were aligned by weighting YouGov samples to achieve an identical survey date
distribution to the GCCR samples. Specifically, GCCR survey dates were converted to a YouGov “week
number” because YouGov surveys only weekly. The distribution of week numbers was computed for each
country in the GCCR data. The YouGov data for the same country was then weighted by week number to
match the corresponding GCCR distribution for that country. So, for example, if a country had 10 GCCR survey
responses in week 1 of the YouGov survey period, and 30 in week 2 of that period, then the YouGov data in
week 1 would be weighted at 25% and in the YouGov data in week 2 at 75%. This procedure was applied
independently for each country, and the weights were used to compute a weighted mean COVID-19-positive
rate for each country from the YouGov data. This was then directly compared against the raw COVID-19-

Sample description
Based on responses to question 7 of the GCCR survey (“Have you been diagnosed with COVID-19?”,
Appendix 1), participants can be split into six groups (see Figure 1). Participants who responded with Option
2 (“Yes – diagnosed with viral swab”) or 3 (“Yes – diagnosed with another lab test”) were classified as C19+;
participants who responded with option 5 (“No – I had a negative test, but I have symptoms”) were classified as
symptomatic C19-; participants who responded with option 4 (“No – I was not diagnosed, but I have
symptoms”) were classified as C19 Unknown; participants who responded with option 6 (“No – I do not have
any symptoms”), with option 7 (“Don’t know”), or with option 8 (“Other”) were classified as undefinable and
excluded from the final analyses. To replicate our previous findings,8 we first compared individuals newly
included in the GCCR dataset (responses from 14 May to 2 July, 2020, replication sample in Figure 1) with
COVID-19 who were lab tested and those who were diagnosed by a clinician based on the self-reported
quantitative changes in smell, taste, chemesthesis, and nasal obstruction (Figure S3). Participants with labtest confirmed C19+ did show slightly greater chemosensory deficits than did those diagnosed with C19+
clinically, but the difference was not clinically meaningful (smell: 4.4±28.6, p=2.7e-13) (Figure S3, Table S2).
We then focused our descriptive and predictive analyses of participants who received a positive (C19+) or a
negative (C19-) lab test for COVID-19. We also computed descriptive and predictive analysis for the C19+
subsample who reported partial or full signs of recovery from their recent respiratory illness. Lastly, the
unknown group was originally hypothesized as similar to the C19- group. Yet the ratings of smell ability during
illness suggest that the majority of these participants has a smell profile closer to C19+ than C19- (Figure S4).
To maximize the validity of the COVID-19 diagnosis in our sample, we therefore excluded the C19 Unknown
group from further analyses.

Change means the rating “before” illness minus the rating “during” illness on the 0-100 visual-analog
scale. Δ indicates the mean difference in change between lab-test and clinically-assessed COVID19-positive subjects, while σ indicates the standard deviation. D indicates effect size (Cohen’s D). p
indicates p-value from a Mann-Whitney U-test. In contrast to the prediction of the pre-registration, we
found statistically significant differences between groups. However, the effect sizes are small and
thus unlikely to be of practical importance.

Chemosensory characterization of C19+ and C19We asked how accurately COVID-19 status could be predicted from the survey responses. The data matrix
had strictly non-negative values and was normalized (column-wise min=0, max=1) to apply regularization in an
equitable fashion across features and give regression coefficients the same interpretation for each feature.
Compared with the main text, models with similar AUC values (but with non-zero coefficients for additional,
likely spurious features) were obtained for smaller values of α, and inferior results for larger ones (which
contained fewer or no non-zero coefficients). Quantitatively similar AUC values were obtained for other models
predicting COVID-19 status using multiple features including ridge regression and random forest, but L1regularized logistic regression consistently produced sparser models with comparable cross-validation
accuracy. Each logistic regression model included an intercept term and one or more normalized features.
Each model attempted to predict, using the value of the response to a single question (and an additive
constant), whether a subject reported a C19+ or C19- status. Coefficients in a logistic regression model can be
interpreted as changes in odds, or as odds ratios when two values are compared. Each ROC curve -constructed using predictions on holdout test sets and concatenated over these test sets -- summarizes the
tradeoff between sensitivity (fraction of C19+ cases correctly identified) and specificity (fraction of C19- cases
correctly identified) as the threshold value for the predictor is varied.

Value of using a scale rather than a binary response to detect C19+
We quantified the information entropy for each survey question used the following standard equation: I

dividing response values by a constant and rounding to the nearest integer. Relative mutual information was

Prediction of recovery from COVID-19-associated smell loss

symptoms (AUC=0.62), indicating that those who experienced their first respiratory symptoms less rece
cently are
more likely to have Recovered Smell (Figure S6A). Adding additional features to the model provided

improvement (AUC=0.65 for the optimal model), but overall it was difficult to predict whether a C19+ par

The core questionnaire of the Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research (GCCR) has been deployed in
Compusense Cloud in 32 languages. The questionnaire was published previously8 and also appears in the
NIH Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) research tools for COVID-19.39 Responses
to the GCCR core questionnaire in 23 languages were collected between April 7 and July 2, 2020 and included
in the final dataset, on which we conducted the analyses reported in this paper.
