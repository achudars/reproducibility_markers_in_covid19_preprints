ABSTRACT
While the nasopharynx in the upper respiratory airway is the dominant initial infection site for SARS-CoV2, the physiologic mechanism that launches the infection in the lower airway is still not well-understood.
Based on the rapidity with which SARS-CoV-2 infection progresses to the lungs, it has been conjectured
that the nasopharynx acts as the seeding zone for subsequent contamination of the lower airway via
aspiration of virus-laden boluses of nasopharyngeal fluids. In this study, we examine the plausibility
of this proposed mechanism. To this end, we have developed computational fluid mechanics models
of the inhalation process in two medical imaging based airway reconstructions and have quantified the
nasopharyngeal liquid volume ingested into the lower airspace during each aspiration. The numerical
predictions are validated by comparing the number of projected aspirations (approximately 2 – 4)
during an eight-hour sleep cycle with prior observational findings of 3 aspirations in human subjects.
Extending the numerical trends on aspiration volume to earlier records on aspiration frequency for the
entire day indicates a total aspirated nasopharyngeal liquid volume of 0.3 – 0.76 ml per day. We then
used sputum assessment data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients to estimate the number of virions
that are transmitted daily to the lungs via nasopharyngeal liquid boluses. For mean sputum viral load,
our modeling projects that the number of virions penetrating to the lower airway per day will range over
2.1 × 106 – 5.3 × 106 ; for peak viral load, the corresponding number of penetrating virions hovers between
7.1 × 108 – 17.9 × 108 . These findings fill in a key piece of the mechanistic puzzle of the progression from
SARS-CoV-2 infection of the nasopharynx to the development of COVID-19 disease within a patient, and
point to dysphagia as a potential underlying risk factor for COVID-19. The findings also have significant
practical implications in the design of COVID-19 prophylactics and therapeutics that aim to constrain the
pathogenic progress of the disease within the limits of the upper airway.

1 Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent for coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19), has been linked1, 2 to a remarkable pattern of relatively high infectivity in ciliated epithelial cells along
the nasal passage lining in the upper airway, moderate infectivity in cells lining the throat and bronchia, and relatively
low infectivity in lung cells. Such viral tropism is governed by the abundance of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2), a single-pass type I membrane protein that is exploited by the viral spike protein binding as a gateway for
cellular entry. ACE2 is abundant on ciliated epithelial cells, but is highly expressed in only a smaller subset of the

alveolar cells in the lower airway. The findings are nonetheless for in vitro samples; virus-laden droplets deposited
along the anterior nasal airway might not be so effective at launching an infection despite the presence of ciliated
cells, as the thicker mucus layer there provides some level of protection against virus invasion and infection3 . Hence,
the nasopharynx, which is the region in the upper airway posterior to the septum comprising the superior portion of
the pharynx, has been postulated to be the main initial infection site for SARS-CoV-2. Efficacy of nasopharyngeal
swabs over oropharyngeal swabs for accurate detection4 of COVID-positive cases supports this hypothesis. Based
on the brisk pace at which lower airway infections ensue following the emergence of initial symptoms1 , it may be
conjectured that the nasopharynx (marked in Fig. 1, see Panels (a)-(f)) acts as the seeding zone for subsequent spread
of the disease to the lungs via lower airway aspiration of virus-laden boluses of nasopharyngeal fluids.
While this conjectured mechanism is superficially plausible, a key unanswered question is whether the rate of
virion flow from the initial site of infection to the lungs would be sufficiently high to account for a second infection
site. In this report, we have combined earlier data on aspiration trends5, 6 with virological assessments of sputum in
COVID-positive patients7 and computational findings on the flow physics variables in anatomically realistic airway
models8 – to quantify bolus-borne virion transmission rates from the nasopharynx into the lower airway.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Frequency and quantification of pharyngeal aspiration
Aspiration of upper airway secretions acts as a major carrier of pathogens to the lower airway, and the phenomenon,
fortunately enough given the current pandemic, has been studied in great detail over the last few decades. As reported
in the late-1990s5 , aspirated pharyngeal liquid volume during sleep ranges from 0.011 ml to 0.129 ml, measured
through tracking mildly-radioactive tracers after the subjects wake up. Further introspection of the data clearly shows
that the maximum data-point in the reported range is a statistical outlier. Including the maximum-reported volume in
the analysis, the mean aspirated volume comes out to be 0.0345 ml and the median is 0.0215 ml. Excluding the
outlier, the mean volume revises to 0.021 ml and the median volume adjusts to 0.020 ml. The study was based on a
total of 10 normal subjects.
Further, while evaluating swallowing mechanisms, it has been reported6 that for bolus volumes 5 ml or less,
aspirations happen during 13% of swallows; and for bolus volumes 10 ml or less, aspirations happen during 11% of
swallows. Boluses smaller than 10 ml are associated with silent aspiration9 and presumably are the major sources of
pathogen-carriers to the deep lungs, and with averaging the reported data, 12% of the swallowing actions (for 10 ml
or smaller bolus volumes) should result in aspiration.
Finally, earlier findings10 suggest that a typical person will swallow 500 – 700 times during a day and 24 times
during sleep (assuming a standard eight-hour sleep cycle). These numbers thus indicate that a subject will aspirate
approximately 12% of 500 – 700 times, i.e. 60 – 84 times during the day, and 12% of 24 times, i.e. approximately 3
times during sleep.
2.2 Development of anatomically realistic computational fluid mechanics models
Allometric relations11 show that the minute inhalation is approximately 14.5 – 20.0 L/min for a 65-kg male and
8.8 – 22.4 L/min for a 65-kg female, both for gentle steady breathing. For simplicity, in this study, we have
simulated inhalation at only 15 L/min; the process can be modeled using viscous-laminar steady state flow physics
schemes12–21 .
2.2.1 Anatomic airway reconstructions

The in silico anatomic geometries were reconstructed from medical-grade computed tomography (CT) scans sourced
from existing de-identified imaging data from two CT-normal subjects. Use of the archived records was approved
with exempt status by the Institutional Review Board of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with the
informed consent requirement waived for retrospective computational use. The test subjects include a 61 year-old
female (subject for anatomic reconstruction 1, or AR1) and a 37 year-old female (subject for anatomic reconstruction
2, or AR2). As for imaging resolution, the CT slices were collected at coronal depth increments of 0.4 mm. The
anatomic airspace was extracted from the scans over a delineation range of -1024 to -300 Hounsfield units, the

process was complemented by careful hand-editing of the selected pixels for anatomic accuracy. Subsequently, the
reconstructed geometries were spatially meshed into minute volume elements. As per established mesh refinement
protocols22, 23 , each computational grid in this study has more than 4 million unstructured, graded tetrahedral
elements (namely, 4.54 million in AR1, 4.89 million in AR2).
2.2.2 Simulating inhalation

The viscous-laminar flow simulations of the inhalation process were carried out using a segregated solver on ANSYS
Fluent, with SIMPLEC pressure-velocity coupling and second-order upwind spatial discretization. We monitored
the solution convergence by minimizing the mass continuity and velocity component residuals, and by stabilizing
the mass flow rate and static pressure at the airflow outlets. For the pressure-driven flow solutions, typical run-time
for 5000 iterations was 5 – 6 hours through 4-processor based parallel computations executed at 4.0 GHz speed. We
assumed the air density to be 1.204 kg/m3 and the dynamic viscosity of air to be 1.825 × 10−5 Pa.s.
We enforced the following boundary conditions in the flow simulations: zero velocity (no slip) at the internal
airway walls i.e. at the tissues and cartilages enclosing the airway; zero pressure at nostril openings, which acted as
the pressure-inlet zones; and negative pressure at the airflow outlet at the base of the nasopharynx, which acted as
the pressure-outlet zone. See Fig. 1 for the relative locations of the anatomic regions.

2.2.3 Theoretical estimation of aspirated nasopharyngeal liquid volume

For an instantaneous pathogenic event such as pharyngeal aspiration, the transport of the nasopharyngeal liquids
downstream to the lower airway can be mathematically described through a reduced-order model of steady unidirectional flow. With the assumption of axial symmetry in the airway conduit and no slip boundary condition at the
walls, integrating the Navier-Stokes equation for momentum conservation results in
Q=−

πR4 d p
,
8µ dz

(1)

where Q is the instantaneous aspirated volume, R is the hydraulic radius (cross-section of conduit divided by the
perimeter at the nasopharyngeal base), µ is the sputum viscosity (quantified at 4.59 Poise for mucopurulent24 ),
and d p/dz is the spatial rate of pressure gradient in the streamwise direction. To adapt the formulation to the
present problem, we have post-processed the simulations to extract the averaged wall pressure at the nasopharynx
(pn ), since the bolus would typically arise from the shearing action along nasopharyngeal surfaces. We have also
extracted the averaged pressure (po ) at the outlet (see Fig. 1), located 20 mm (streamwise ∆Z, so as to ensure full
flow development in the simulations) below the nasopharyngeal base. With ∆P = po − pn , the gradient rate d p/dz
can therefore be approximated to simply ∆P/∆Z.
2.3 Data on viral loading
SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus, and virological assessments7 performed on the sputum of hospitalized
COVID-19 patients indicate a mean viral load of Vave = 7 × 106 RNA copies/ml of oral fluid. The peak load was
Vpeak = 2.35 × 109 copies/ml.

3 Results
3.1 Computational prediction of shear-generated, pressure-driven nasopharyngeal bolus volume
With inhalation simulated at 15 L/min: for AR1, ∆P was -0.82 Pa; for AR2, ∆P was 2.33 Pa (see Fig. 1, Panels
(g) and (h)). The hydraulic radius in AR1 was 3.43 mm, i.e. R = 0.00343 m; the hydraulic radius in AR2 was
3.06 mm, i.e. R = 0.00306 m. Consequently using Equation 1, in AR1: the liquid bolus in each aspiration is
π × R4 × |∆P| / (8 × 0.459 × 0.02) = 4.86 × 10−9 m3 = 0.00486 ml. Similarly in AR2: the liquid bolus volume
ingested during each aspiration is 0.00874 ml.
3.2 Estimation of aspiration frequency and validation of the computational predictions
Using the earlier observational data in the first paragraph of Section 2.1, in conjunction with the computed
volumes in Section 3.1, the aspiration frequency during each sleep cycle ranges between 0.021 ml/0.00874 ml and
0.021 ml/0.00486 ml, or approximately 2 – 4 times. Calculations based on direct experimental observations provide
an estimate of 3 aspirations during a sleep cycle (derived in the third paragraph of Section 2.1, using previous
reports6, 10 ). The computational framework thus provides strong agreement with the direct experimental observations,
providing a measure of validation for the underlying fluid dynamics framework.
3.3 Estimation of virion flow to the lower airway
Section 2.1 shows that the total number of aspirations of liquid boluses into the lower airway approximately ranges
between 63 – 87 times in a day (including the subdued phase during sleep). Based on the data from the current
subjects in the numerical simulations (see Section 3.1), the total volume of aspirated liquid in a day is thus between
0.00486 × 63 ml and 0.00874 × 87 ml, or between 0.3 – 0.76 ml. With the virological data from Section 2.3, the
number of virions penetrating into the lower airway, while suspended in nasopharyngeal fluid boluses, is therefore
between 0.3 × Vave = 2.1 × 106 and 0.76 × Vave = 5.3 × 106 , while considering the mean viral load. For peak viral
load (Vpeak ) in the sputum, the corresponding number of penetrating virions ranges over 7.1 × 108 – 17.9 × 108 .

4 Discussion
We have demonstrated a novel computational approach to estimate virion flow rates to the lower airway from
the initial dominant infection zone in the upper airway, i.e. the nasopharynx, which acts as the seeding site for
the progressive infection via aspiration of virus-laden boluses of nasopharyngeal fluids. The computational fluid
mechanics prediction of the aspirated liquid volume in each occurrence is validated by comparing the number of
projected aspirations (approximately 2 – 4) during an eight-hour sleep cycle with prior observational findings of 3
aspirations in human subjects.
The numerically projected aspiration volumes have been linked to earlier records on aspiration frequency for
the entire day, to obtain a total aspirated nasopharyngeal liquid volume of 0.3 – 0.76 ml each day. Subsequently
using sputum assessment data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we see that the number of virions penetrating
the lower airway ranges over 2.1 × 106 – 5.3 × 106 , for mean sputum viral load. When the viral load peaks, the
number of penetrating virions increases to 7.1 × 108 – 1.8 × 109 . Deep sequencing studies suggest that theminimum
infectious dose for SARS-CoV-2 transmission from one human host to another is on the order of O 102 virions25
(also supported by our earlier computational findings8 ), so it stands to reason that a dose 104 – 107 times higher will
suffice to seed a second infection site within the same host, particularly given the relatively high levels of ACE2
expression in a subset of alveolar cells26 .
Our results should be interpreted as being preliminary, given that the numerical findings are based on simulated
data from only two CT-normal subjects. We note that there is good agreement between numerical predictions of
aspiration frequency with earlier observational findings, which speaks to the validity of the underlying computational
and mathematical framework. The size of the projected viral dose also speaks to the robustness of the conclusion – it
is likely that virion flow from the nasopharynx to the lungs occurs in large excess of the minimum dose required to
seed a lung infection for many individuals.
Our findings suggest a simple aspiration-based physiological mechanism for COVID-19 etiology following
initial SARS-CoV-2 infection in the nasopharynx. Such a mechanistic link may be valuable in identifying risk
factors that predispose patients to progress to COVID-19 disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection. For example,
a prediction that flows readily (pun intended) from this proposed mechanism is that individuals with dysphagia
(problems initiating swallowing) may be at increased risk of developing COVID-19 following SARS-CoV-2 infection,
and may have more negative outcomes with the disease.
One condition associated with dysphagia is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)27–29 , with increased nocturnal
aspiration30 and risk of aspiration pneumonia31 . Based on the mechanism proposed by us for viral spread to the
lungs, individuals with OSA would thus be expected to be at a higher risk for COVID-19. In fact, this has been
reported by a number of different investigators32–36 . One study, for example, reported an association of OSA with
increased risk for hospitalization (OR 1.65; 95CI (1.36, 2.02)) and respiratory failure (OR 1.98; 95CI (1.65, 2.37))
due to COVID-19, after adjusting for diabetes, hypertension, and body mass index37 . As a practical matter, our
work suggests that individuals with OSA should not suspend the use of their CPAP devices upon testing positive for
SARS-CoV-2, as has been suggested by some practitioners38 .
As the prevalence of dysphagia also increases with other factors such as increased age39 , cancer treatment40 ,
and Parkinsonism41 , the physiological mechanism proposed here may also account for some of the documented
increased risk of adverse outcomes42–45 in these groups. Further study is required to understand the importance of
dysphagia in general as a predictive factor for adverse outcomes with COVID-19.
Our findings also point to the critical importance of reducing SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the early stages of the
infection. Therapeutics and prophylactics that fail to prevent the virus from gaining a foothold in the nasopharynx
will allow the escalation of the disease in at least a subset of the population, which may already be more vulnerable
to adverse outcomes from the disease. If vaccinal prophylaxis does not provide sterilizing immunity, then vaccinated
individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharynx may be subjected to a steady stream of virions testing
their immune system with potential immune-evading mutations. Such a scenario is of particular concern for antibody
prophylactics and vaccines that target the spike protein, work by us46 and others47, 48 suggests that the spike protein
has a relatively high mutational tolerance, and is expected to readily generate immune-evading mutations when

antibody-based prophylaxis becomes widespread. In this scenario, some proportion of patients may experience
breakthrough infections as a result of evolutionarily-mediated resistance, and seed transmission chains of antibodyor vaccine-resistant SARS-CoV-2 within the population. Biomedical interventions that rely on limiting the spread of
the virus, that has established itself within the body, may underestimate the systemic threat that nasopharyngeal
SARS-CoV-2 infections pose to individual patients as well as to public health.
