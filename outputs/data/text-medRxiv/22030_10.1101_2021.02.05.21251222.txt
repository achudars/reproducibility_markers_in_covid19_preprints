Abstract
OBJECTIVES: With declining numbers of COVID-19 cases in the State of São Paulo,
Brazil, social distancing measures were gradually being lifted. The risk of an increase in
the number of cases, however, cannot be overlooked. Even with the adoption of nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as restrictions on mass gatherings, wearing masks,
and complete or partial closure of schools, other public health measures may help to
control the epidemic. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the contact tracing of
symptomatic individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic regardless of the use of diagnostic
testing.
METHODS: We developed a mathematical model that includes isolation of
symptomatic individuals and tracing of contacts to assess the effects of the contact
tracing of symptomatic individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic in the State of São
Paulo.
RESULTS: For a selection efficacy (proportion of isolated contacts who are infected) of
80%, cases and deaths may be reduced by 80% after 60 days when 5000 symptomatic
individuals are isolated per day, each of them together with 10 contacts. On the other
hand, for a selection efficacy of 20%, the number of cases and deaths may be reduced
by approximately 40% and 50%, respectively, compared with the scenario in which no
contact tracing strategy is performed.

INTRODUCTION
The first case of COVID-19 in Brazil was reported on 26 February 2020 in the
State of São Paulo, the most populous Brazilian state with 44,639,899 inhabitants (1).
Genome sequencing coupled with phylogenetic analyses corroborate multiple
importations of the virus from Italy followed by local spread (2). As of 30 October
2020, 1,113,788 cases and 39,255 deaths were reported in Brazil (3), the largest
numbers in Latin America (4).
Isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment are
important non-pharmaceutical public health interventions to control the explosive
growth of COVID-19 (5). Liberal testing, followed by contact tracing and isolation of
all test positive persons have direct and clear benefits (6).
The World Health Organization recommends a combination of rapid diagnosis,
immediate isolation of cases, rigorous tracking and precautionary self-isolation of close
contacts (6). In a previous paper, we analyzed the impact and costs of test-tracequarantine strategies (7). Here we set out to model the effects of a contact tracing
strategy of symptomatic individuals to control the COVID-19 spread regardless of the
use of diagnostic testing. This may be an alternative strategy for places with limited
availability of diagnostic tests.

METHODS
The model
The model is based on a modified version of the SEIR model (7,8) and considers that
the population at time t is divided into several compartments, namely: susceptible
individuals, S (t ) ; isolated susceptible individuals, QS (t ) ; susceptible individuals
previously isolated, ST (t ) ; exposed individuals, E (t ) ; asymptomatic/oligosymptomatic

individuals, A(t ) ; symptomatic individuals, I (t ) ; isolated infected individuals, Q(t ) ;
hospitalized individuals, H (t ) ; individuals with severe disease hospitalized in intensive
care units (ICU), G (t ) ; and recovered individuals, R(t ) .
A schematic representation of the model is shown in Figure 1.
The dynamics of individuals between compartments may be described as
follows:
(i)

Susceptible individuals, S (t ) , grow with a birth rate (t ) , either may acquire

the infection with contact rate  , or be isolated with constant rate  S (i.e.,  S
individuals isolated per unit time).
(ii)

Isolated susceptible individuals, QS (t ) , after a period of 1 /  , are moved to the

compartment ST (t ) .
(iii)

Once infected, the susceptible S (t ) and ST (t ) individuals move to the state of

exposed individuals, denoted E (t ) .
(iv)

Exposed individuals may evolve to symptomatic individuals, I (t ) , with rate  I ,

or evolve to asymptomatic/oligosymptomatic individuals, denoted A(t ) , with rate  A ,
and may be isolated with constant rate  E .
(v)

Infectious individuals, I (t ) , may either evolve to one of two states, hospitalized

individuals denoted H (t ) , with rate  H , or to a state in which individuals develop
severe disease and are admitted to intensive care units, denoted G (t ) , with rate  G .
Infectious individuals, I (t ) , may be isolated with constant rate  I and may also die by
the disease, with rate  I .
(vi)

Asymptomatic individuals A(t ) may be isolated with constant rate  A .

(vii)

Individuals in the states A(t ) , H (t ) , and G(t ) may die by the disease, with rates

 A ,  H , and  G , respectively.
(viii) All individuals who acquired the infection and who did not die by the disease,
recover to a new state, denoted R(t ) , with rates  I ,  A ,  H and  G , as depicted in
Figure 1.

(ix)

Isolated infected individuals are moved to a state denoted Q(t ) . Since these

individuals are isolated from the rest of the population, they do not transmit the virus
and will eventually recover from the infection, with rate  Q .
(x)

All individuals may die by natural causes with rate  .

(xi)

We assumed that the population birth rate (t ) is equal to the natural mortality

of the population, disregarding the disease-induced mortality.

Fitting procedure
We used the fitting procedure proposed by Amaku et al. (7) and described as
follows.
Data on the cumulative number of reported cases and deaths were obtained from
Seade (Fundação Sistema Estadual de Análise de Dados do Estado de São Paulo). Data
on the number of ICU patients were obtained from SIMI (Sistema de Monitoramento
Inteligente do Estado de São Paulo). A fitting procedure based on the LevenbergMarquardt non-linear least-squares algorithm was used to fit the model’s parameters
simultaneously to the data on cases, deaths and ICU patients. We used the R package
minpack.lm (Elzhov et al., 2016).
We assumed that the potentially infective contact rate, the notification ratio, and
the ICU admission rate change every 10 days.
The parameter values used are shown in Table 1.
Model projections for future dates were obtained by keeping fixed the fitted
values of the parameters from the last date observed in the data.
The contact tracing (CT) strategy
A number  I of symptomatic individuals are isolated per unit time. c contacts
of each symptomatic individual are also isolated. We varied both  I and c . Isolated
individuals remain in isolation during 14 days.
Assuming that a fraction of the isolated contacts may be susceptible or
recovered, we define a selection efficacy as the proportion of isolated contacts who are
infected (asymptomatic or symptomatic individuals).
We calculated the efficacy of the CT strategy subtracting from 1 the result of the
division of the cumulative number of cases by the number of cases in the baseline
scenario in which CT is not performed.
We assumed an initial condition with 15%, 83% and 2% of recovered,
susceptible and infected individuals. These estimates are consistent with the model
projections for the beginning of August, 2020 in the State of São Paulo. Among the
infected individuals, an asymptomatic-to-symptomatic ratio of 5 and a ratio of
asymptomatic-to-exposed (from the compartments A and E) of 9 were assumed.

Sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis was performed using a Monte Carlo method to sample
parameter values and a PRCC (Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient) estimation to
measure the strength of association between an input parameter and an output variable
after the linear effects on the output variable of the remaining inputs are discounted
(9,10). Parameter values were sampled using a Monte Carlo sampling method assuming
a uniform distribution for each parameter. The following input parameters were
included in the analysis: proportions of susceptible ( f S ), infected ( f I ), and recovered
( f R ) individuals in the initial condition; number of symptomatic individuals isolated
(  I ) per unit time; number of contacts ( c ) of each symptomatic individual isolated; the
selection efficacy ( eff ); and the asymptomatic-to-symptomatic ratio ( rAS ). The ranges
of parameter values used in the sensitivity analysis are shown in Table 2. The
cumulative number of cases after 60 days was used as the output variable.

RESULTS
We fitted the model parameters simultaneously to the data of cumulative number
of reported cases, deaths and the number of ICU patients (Figure 2) for the state of São
Paulo until July 18, 2020. To estimate a 95% probability interval (shaded area in Figure
2), we assumed a normal distribution for the contact rate with a standard deviation of
1.0%.
The cumulative number of cases and deaths over time for different numbers
(1000, 3000 or 5000) of symptomatic individuals isolated per day and their contacts (5
or 10 contacts per symptomatic individuals) are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively.
Selection efficacies of 20% and 80% were taken into account. The solid line shows the
results when no CT strategy was used. The efficacy of the CT strategies and the number
of isolated individuals are shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively.

The higher the number of symptomatic individuals isolated per day, the lower
the cumulative number of cases and deaths (Figures 3 and 4). For instance, when 5000
symptomatic individuals are isolated per day, each of them together with 10 contacts,
the number of cases and deaths are reduced by approximately 40% and 50%,
respectively, compared with the scenario in which the CT strategy is not performed, for
a selection efficacy of 20% and 60 days since the beginning of the strategy
implementation. For the selection efficacy of 80%, cases and deaths are reduced by 80%
approximately.
As the calculation of the efficacy of the CT strategy is based on the reduction in
the number of cases, for the scenarios described in the previous example, the efficacy of
the CT strategy is 40% for the selection efficacy of 20% (Figure 5). For the selection
efficacy of 80%, the efficacy of the CT strategy is 82% approximately.
Regarding the number of isolated individuals, when the selection efficacy is low
(20%), the number of isolated individuals may be as high as 3.2 million isolated
individuals after 60 days for the strategy with 5000 symptomatic individuals isolated
per day together with 10 contacts for each individual (Figure 6). On the other hand,
when the selection efficacy is high (80%), about 1.6 million individuals were isolated
after 60 days.
PRCC values are shown in Figure 7. The sign of the PRCC is related to the
qualitative relationship between the input parameter and the output variable (number of
cumulative cases). The number of cumulative cases decreases as the number of
symptomatic individuals isolated (  I ), the selection efficacy ( eff ) and the number of
contacts ( c ) increase, thus the PRCC values are negative. The positive values of the
PRCC for the initial proportion of infected individuals ( f I ) and the asymptomatic-tosymptomatic ratio ( rAS ) imply that, when these parameters increase, the number of
cumulative cases also increase. The PRCC values for the initial proportion of
susceptible ( f S ) and recovered ( f R ) individuals are positive but closer to zero (low
correlation) when these two initial condition values are in the ranges shown in Table 2.

DISCUSSION
We modelled the impact of a strategy based on contact tracing of symptomatic
individuals on the COVID-19 epidemic in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. This strategy
has lower costs when compared to a test-trace-and-quarantine strategy (7). It may be a
potential alternative strategy when the number of diagnostic tests available is not
sufficient for a massive testing strategy.
In the sensitivity analysis, we observed that the reduction in the number of
cumulative cases was more sensitive to the number of symptomatic individuals isolated,
the selection efficacy, and the number of contacts, in decreasing order of the PRCC. The
increase in the number of isolated symptomatic individuals and their contacts poses
logistical challenges and associated costs. These costs, however, are likely to be lower
than the costs of a test, trace and quarantine strategy (7).
The higher the selection efficacy, the higher the efficacy of the CT strategy
(Figure 5). The use of high performance diagnostic tests would likely increase the
selection efficacy. However, without the use of diagnostic tests, one could think that
tracing of close contacts of symptomatic individuals, such as household members or
coworkers, would probably increase the selection efficacy, thus increasing the overall
efficacy of the CT strategy.
Optimising tracing coverage and minimizing tracing delays, for instance with
app-based technology, further enhance contact tracing effectiveness, as pointed out by
Kretzschmar et al. (11). As discussed by Bilinski et al. (12), the benefits of contact
tracing depend on adherence to isolation and quarantine among individuals who are
traced. The adherence may be enhanced by measures such as out-of-home
accommodations, income replacement, and social supports (12).
A limitation of this analysis is that we are assuming that the isolated
symptomatic individuals are infected by SARS-CoV-2 and not by other virus that could
cause similar symptoms. This limitation, however, would be less important in a scenario
in which a substantial part of the respiratory infections are caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, one could interpret the number of isolated symptomatic individuals as an
effective number of individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 who should be isolated in
order to observe the outcomes of the model.

CONCLUSION
We evaluated the impact of contact tracing of symptomatic individuals and their
contacts on the number of cases and deaths related to COVID-19. Depending on the
number of symptomatic individuals isolated per day and also on the efficacy of
selecting infected (asymptomatic) contacts to be isolated, the overall efficacy of the
contact tracing strategy can be high. For instance, for a selection efficacy of 80%, cases
and deaths may be reduced by 80% after 60 days when 5000 symptomatic individuals
are isolated per day, each of them together with 10 contacts. On the other hand, for a
selection efficacy of 20%, the number of cases and deaths may be reduced by
approximately 40% and 50%, respectively, compared with the scenario in which no
contact tracing strategy is performed. Thus, contact tracing of symptomatic individuals
may be a potential alternative strategy when the number of diagnostic tests available is
not sufficient for a massive testing strategy.

Figure captions
Figure 1 – Schematic representation of the model compartments.
Figure 2 – Cumulative number of reported cases and deaths, and number of ICU
patients (black dots) and the corresponding fitted model (blue lines). The solid lines and
shaded area correspond, respectively, to median values and 95% probability intervals.
Figure 3 – Cumulative number of cases as a function of time for different numbers of
isolated symptomatic individuals per day, isolated contacts and selection efficacy of (a)
20% and (b) 80%. The solid black line shows the effect that would be observed if no
isolation strategy is used.
Figure 4 – Cumulative number of deaths as a function of time for different numbers of
isolated symptomatic individuals per day, isolated contacts and selection efficacy of (a)
20% and (b) 80%. The solid black line shows the effect that would be observed if no
isolation strategy is used.
Figure 5 – Efficacy of the CT strategy, defined as 1 minus the ratio of the number of
cases under a CT strategy divided by the number of cases without CT strategy, as a
function of time for different combinations of symptomatic individuals isolated per day,
number of isolated contacts and selection efficacy of (a) 20% and (b) 80%.
Figure 6 – Cumulative number of isolated individuals as a function of time for different
combinations of isolated symptomatic individuals per day, isolated contacts and
selection efficacy of (a) 20% and (b) 80%.
Figure 7 – Partial rank correlation coefficients for the number of cumulative cases as
output variable and the following input variables: number of symptomatic individuals
isolated (  I ), selection efficacy ( eff ), number of contacts ( c ), initial proportion of
infected ( f I ), susceptible ( f S ) and recovered ( f R ) individuals, and asymptomatic-tosymptomatic ratio ( rAS ).
