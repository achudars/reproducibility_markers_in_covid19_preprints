ABSTRACT
In order to properly understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection and development of
humoral immunity, researchers have evaluated the presence of serum antibodies of people
worldwide experiencing the pandemic. These studies rely on the use of recombinant proteins
from the viral genome in order to identify serum antibodies that recognize SARS-CoV-2
epitopes. Here, we discuss the cross-reactivity potential of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with the full
spike proteins of four other Betacoronaviruses that cause disease in humans, MERS-CoV,
SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(ELISAs), we detected the potential cross-reactivity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 towards
the four other coronaviruses, with the strongest cross-recognition between SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS /MERS-CoV antibodies, as expected based on sequence homology of their respective
spike proteins. Further analysis of cross-reactivity could provide informative data that could lead
to intelligently designed pan-coronavirus therapeutics or vaccines.

INTRODUCTION
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has reached almost every country on Earth. As with many viral
infections, our immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection through a variety of cellular
and humoral effectors. These include antibodies produced by B cells, which can be formed
against various viral proteins. For SARS-CoV-2, antibodies have been detected that recognize
three of the four SARS-CoV-2 proteins exposed on the surface of the viral capsid: the
nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), and spike (S) proteins (1). The spike protein forms as a
homotrimer and mediates receptor binding through its receptor binding domain (RBD) to host
cell ACE2 and is thus the major target of neutralizing antibody responses (2, 3). When testing for
the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, researchers have utilized the full spike ectodomain as
well as the RBD domain alone for antigens in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)
and other serologic assays (4).
The zoonotic Betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (endemic/pandemic B-lineage),
and MERS (endemic C-lineage) transferred primarily from bats, while the viruses OC43 and
HKU1 (seasonal A-lineage coronaviruses) are endemic in humans (5, 6). All of these viruses

bear the spike protein on their surface (7, 8). As such, anti-spike antibodies are common in
response to each of the five human-infecting Betacoronaviruses (9–11). Knowledge of crossreactivity of anti-spike antibodies against different viruses is critical for understanding of SARSCoV-2 immunity of individuals who have had prior exposure to other Betacoronaviruses and of
potential future immunity of COVID-19 survivors to other coronaviruses (12). Furthermore,
knowledge of cross-reactivity is necessary to understand and properly interpret results from
serologic studies such as serosurveys and clinical antibody tests (13, 14). Previous research has
shown minimal cross-reactivity between RBD domains from differing coronaviruses; however,
these studies largely ignore the rest of the spike protein, which will be an important consideration
for identification of potential therapeutic antibodies and can be used in vitro to help identify
polyclonal responses that are not detected with RBD alone (15).
Here, we evaluated the serologic reactivity of pre-pandemic archival blood serum samples (pre2019) and samples collected in April 2020 from a community highly affected by SARS-CoV-2.
Utilizing twelve previously reported ELISAs (15), we tested IgG, IgM and IgA reactivity against
spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1
(Fig. 1).
RESULTS
Sequence homology between pandemic, endemic, and seasonal coronaviruses
To evaluate the potential for cross-reactivity, we first compared the spike protein sequence
homology among SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1
(Fig. 2, Supplementary Figure 1). The greatest homology was between SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV (76% identity, 87% similarity), followed by MERS (42% identity, 58% similarity)
and lastly OC43/HKU1 (OC43: 30% identity, 41% similarity; HKU1: 29% identity, 40%
similarity). A-lineage OC43 and HKU1 are more similar to each other (64% identity, 75%
similarity) than to the two endemic Betacoronaviruses. There is a larger fraction of homology
towards the C-terminus of the protein in all coronavirus spike proteins, which represents the
major structural regions of the protein including the heptad repeat regions responsible for

insertion of the fusion peptide into the host cell membrane. Homology is significantly lower in
the N-terminal regions of spike, with significant lack of similarity in the regions including the
receptor-binding domain, correlating with the difference in receptors and determinants used for
host cell entry in the different Betacoronaviruses (MERS-CoV: receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4
(DPP4), SARS-CoV/SAR-CoV-2: ACE2, OC43/HKU1: the sugar N-Acetylneuraminic acid)(8).
Serologic reactivity of anti-spike IgG, IgM and IgA antibodies
Functional cross-reactivity was determined through the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assays (ELISAs) measuring IgG, IgM and IgA subclasses, representing mature, early stage, and
mucosal specific serologic responses, respectively. We produced recombinant soluble spike
proteins of SARS-CoV-2, MERS, SARS-CoV, OC43, and HKU1 using the Expi293 expression
system, which yielded pure, intact ectodomain trimers suitable for ELISA (16). Notably, the
yields of all coronavirus spike proteins were significantly different even though all four of five
were cloned in identical vectors and contained the same modifications to the wildtype sequences
(elimination of furin cleavage site, prefusion-stabilizing proline mutations (2P), similar Cterminal tags), none of which is expected to alter serologic recognition due to their internal
locations. The HCoV-OC43 construct has all of these features but the wild-type furin cleavage
site is present. Using similar expression conditions, SARS-CoV-2 spike was produced at a
maximum of 2 mg/L culture, while the other spike proteins were significantly easier to produce
with yields of 5, 11, 8, and 6 mg/L respectively for SARS-CoV, MERS, OC43, and HKU1. We
utilized a semi-automated ELISA protocol to detect serum antibodies from pre-2019 archival
samples and samples from a community with high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence during the 2020
pandemic (Fig. 3). In serum samples collected from healthy volunteers prior to 2019, there was
minimal reactivity with SARS-CoV-2, MERS and SARS-CoV. The majority of tested samples (n
= 114) displayed high IgG reactivity with OC43 and HKU1 spike proteins, consistent with the
extensive spread of seasonal Betacoronavirus infections within the United States (Fig. 3a,b). As
reported previously, we detected a high proportion of donors who seroconverted and were
SARS-CoV-2 IgG+ in a community in New York City, along with a significant number of IgM
and IgA seropositive donors, including several donors who were non-symptomatic (15). All
samples had low levels of IgM reactivity against MERS, SARS-CoV, OC43, and HKU1 (Fig.

3c,d). IgA antibodies were present at higher levels than IgM, but still well below levels of IgG,
correlating well with biologic prevalence of antibody classes in response to pathogens (Fig. 3e,f).
Minimal linear correlation of SARS-CoV-2 signal intensity with other Betacoronaviruses
When comparing the assay absorbance signal (optical density, OD) between SARS-CoV-2 and
the other spike proteins in the high-incidence population, we saw a stronger correlation of signal
intensity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV IgG (Correlation = 0.711, R2 = 0.505) and the
lowest correlation with HKU1 (Correlation = 0.281, R2 = 0.079) (Fig. 4a, Supplementary
Figure 2). Though there was not a precise linear correlation for IgG, donors who represented
signal intensity in the lower 50% of SARS-CoV-2 absorbance readings did have a significantly
lower MERS and SARS-CoV signal intensity when compared to the upper 50% of SARS-CoV-2
intensity (Fig. 5). Overall, these data suggest some cross-reactivity occurs that is more easily
detectable at high titers of antibody.
Cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies with endemic and seasonal coronaviruses
Since we observed a difference in the IgG signal intensity of other Betacoronaviruses with high
levels of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, we further analyzed the relationship between SARS-CoV-2
seroprevalence and antibody titer with SARS-CoV, MERS, OC43, and HKU1 in pre-pandemic
(pre-2019), high-prevalence symptomatic donors, and high-prevalence asymptomatic donors
(Fig. 6, Supplementary Figure 3). Overall, archival pre-2019 samples displayed an equivalent
low signal intensity of SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and SARS-CoV spike reactivity (Fig. 6a). One
cross-reactive donor from this group was negative for both MERS and SARS-CoV. As
previously discussed, the majority of donors were OC43 and HKU1 seropositive due to the broad
circulation of these viruses in humans. In the high incidence community, for both symptomatic
and asymptomatic individuals, there appeared to be a correlation in SARS-CoV-2 signal
intensity with MERS and SARS-CoV. To further analyze this, we directly compared the signal
intensity of archival sample controls to the high-incidence pandemic population (Fig. 6b). There
was a significant difference in signal intensity of MERS, SARS-CoV, OC43, and HKU1,

suggesting potential cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies with MERS, SARS-CoV,
OC43 and HKU1 spike proteins.
DISCUSSION
Cross-reactivity of antibodies with multiple coronaviruses is an important consideration in
studying the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, both technically, for identifying individuals who have
been exposed to and recovered from the virus, as well as therapeutically, to identify broadly
neutralizing antibodies or epitopes on multiple coronavirus subtypes (12, 17, 18). Accordingly,
we analyzed potential serologic cross-reactivity of antibodies with spike proteins derived from
SARS-CoV-2 as well as two endemic (MERS, SARS-CoV) and two seasonal (OC43, HKU1)
Betacoronavirus species. It is unclear, in terms of plasmid-based protein expression, why there is
so much variability in spike protein expression levels between the different viruses, but this
argues again for significant differences in the behavior of these proteins regardless of their
primary sequence homology.
Antibodies that react with the spike proteins of OC43 and HKU1 are highly prevalent in the
general population of the United States as determined by their measurement in archival pre-2019
serum samples. Previous reports of their prevalence show that the majority of children are
exposed to OC43 and seroconvert early in life (19). The detection of high serologic reactivity of
archival controls with HKU1 might, thus, be due to the strong seroprevalence of OC43
antibodies. Further studies would be needed to determine this interaction, though due to the high
level of sequence and structural homology of their spike proteins, such a cross-reactivity between
the two tested seasonal Betacoronaviruses would not be surprising.
When compared to reactivity with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, antibodies that react to OC43
and HKU1 have minimal cross-reactivity with the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 or two other endemic
coronaviruses, MERS and SARS-CoV. This phenotype correlates with the sequence homology
of these proteins, wherein SARS-CoV-2 spike is more similar to SARS-CoV and MERS, as
opposed to OC43 and HKU1 seasonal coronaviruses.

When comparing serum from healthy volunteers collected pre-2019 (archival controls) to those
from a high-exposure community, we observe that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies react intermediately
with MERS and SARS-CoV spike proteins. The mean ELISA signal intensity is significantly
greater for both MERS and SARS-CoV when comparing archival controls versus the highincidence community. Although there is minimal linear correlation between signal intensity of
SARS-CoV-2 and MERS/SARS-CoV, the higher titer SARS-CoV-2 donors also display a
significantly higher MERS and SARS-CoV signal intensity compared to their lower titer
counterparts within the same population.
Given the low seroprevalence of SARS-CoV and MERS outside of their endemic regions, and
the significantly lower reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 patient sera to SARS-CoV and MERS spike
proteins, it is likely that any reactivity between the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and
MERS/SARS-CoV endemic viruses would result in minimal noise between SARS-CoV-2 signal
and endemic coronavirus signal in serological assays. In countries with a higher prevalence of
MERS & SARS-CoV, researchers should include thorough analysis of archival patient sera (pre2019), including sera from known SARS-CoV and MERS convalescent patients, to properly
analyze the resulting data and adjust any estimates of seropositivity as needed. No clinical
serology studies of SARS-CoV-2 immunity in populations previously infected with either SARS
or MERS have yet emerged.
Additionally, individuals who have strongly seroconverted after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and
who display cross-reactivity for both MERS and SARS-CoV spike proteins, are of great interest
for translational study. These individuals could potentially harbor antibodies that are universally
reactive to multiple Betacoronaviruses and, if these antibodies are functional for neutralization,
could be important to identify to inform the development of novel therapeutics or vaccines.
MATERIALS & METHODS
Human serum samples
Archival (pre-2019) serum samples (n = 114) were collected between January 2014 and
December 2018 from healthy adults (aged 18 – 55 years) through an existing NIH study

NCT01386424. High-incidence community samples are deidentified uncoded samples donated
from a community blood draw from donors in New York and New Jersey in April 2020. Twentytwo (22) of these donors had a previous SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab PCR-based
diagnosis, 46 were symptomatic but undiagnosed, and 6 were asymptomatic but had known
exposure (n = 68 symptomatic, n = 6 asymptomatic). All clinical trials were conducted in
accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice
guidelines. All clinical trial participants signed written informed consent prior to enrollment.
Plasmid sourcing and preparation
SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-HKU1 and SARS-CoV spike plasmids were produced from
the McLellan lab at UT Austin and NIAID VRC and prepared as previously described (2, 20,
21). Briefly, for HCoV-OC43 S, a mammalian-codon-optimized gene encoding HCoV-OC43 S
(GI: 744516696) ectodomain with a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization domain, an HRV3C
cleavage site, an 8xHis-tag and a Twin-Strep-tag were synthesized and subcloned into the
eukaryotic-expression vector pαH. The S1/S2 furin-recognition site was mutated to produce a
single-chain S protein and 2 prolines were substituted, following previous-published prefusion
stabilizing mutation strategy.
Protein production and purification
Soluble spike trimers were produced by expression in Expi293 cells and purified by a
combination of tangential flow filtration, immobilized metal affinity chromatography, and
desalting, following the procedures noted in Esposito et al. Expression was carried out at 37°C
for 72 hours prior to harvest. Final purified proteins were validated by a combination of SDSPAGE and analytical size exclusion chromatography (AnSEC). All spike proteins produced
single peaks on AnSEC over a Superdex 200 column, and the peak elution was consistent with
the size of a trimeric spike protein. Of note, the OC43 spike protein undergoes cleavage during
SDS-PAGE leading to the appearance of two bands at 80 and 100 kDa as well as the
appropriately full-length band migrating at 180 kDa. AnSEC confirms that this is an artifact of
the SDS-PAGE process, as the protein elutes in a single trimeric peak of the appropriate size.

We performed ELISAs as previously described (15). Briefly, spike proteins were suspended at 1
ug/ml in 1x PBS. One hundred (100) microliters of protein suspension was added to each well of
a 96-well Nunc MaxiSorp ELISA plate and allowed to coat overnight at 4oC for 16 hours. Wells
were washed three times with 300 ul of 1x PBS + 0.05% Tween20 (wash buffer) followed by
blocking for 2 hours at room temperature with 200 ul of 1x PBS + 0.05% Tween20 + 5% Nonfat dry milk (blocking buffer). Wells were washed again three times with 300 ul of wash buffer
prior to addition of 100 ul of sample diluted in blocking buffer (serum samples were heat
inactivated for 45 minutes at 56oC and diluted at 1:400 in blocking buffer). Samples were
incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, then washed three times with 300 ul of wash buffer.
One hundred (100) microliters of 1-Step Ultra TMB Substrate (ThermoFisher) was added and
the plate was incubated for 10 minutes prior to stopping the reaction with 1N sulfuric acid (Stop
Solution, ThermoFisher). Absorbance was read at 450 nm and 650 nm on a BioTek Epoch2 plate
reader. The process is semi-automated through the use of a BioTek EL406 plate
washer/dispenser and two BioStack 4 plate stackers to minimize plate-to-plate variation and
increase throughput (see Klumpp-Thomas C, Kalish H et al. 2020 for detailed automation
methods).
Data Analysis
Absorbance values (optical density) were collected at 450 and 650 nm. A650 was subtracted
from A450 to remove background signal. Data were subsequently analyzed utilizing Microsoft
Excel and GraphPad Prism.
