Abstract
Background
The mortality of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 is unclear
due to variable censoring and substantial proportions of undischarged patients at follow-up.
Nationwide data have not been previously reported. We studied the outcomes of Swedish
patients at 30 days after ICU admission.
Methods
We conducted a registry-based cohort study of all adult patients admitted to Swedish ICUs
from 6 March-6 May, 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 disease and complete 30day follow-up. Data including baseline characteristics, comorbidities, intensive care
treatments, organ failures and outcomes were collected. The primary outcome was 30-day
all-cause mortality. A multivariable model was used to determine the independent
association between potential predictor variables and the primary outcome.
Results
A total of 1563 patients were identified. Median ICU length of stay was 12 (5-21) days, and
fifteen patients remained in ICU at the time of follow-up. Median age was 61 (52-69),
median Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III) was 53 (46-59), and 66·8% had at least
one comorbidity. Median PaO2/FiO2 on admission was 97·5 (75·0-140·6) mmHg, 74·7%
suffered from moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The 30-day
all-cause mortality was 26·7%. The majority of deaths occurred during ICU admission. Age,
male sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1·5 [1·1-2·1]), SAPS III score (aOR 1·3 [1·2-1·4]), severe
ARDS (aOR 3·1 [2·0-4·8], specific COVID-19 pharmacotherapy (aOR 1·4 [1·0-1·9]), and CRRT
(aOR 2·2 [1·6-3·0]), were associated with increased mortality. With the exception of chronic

lung disease, the presence of comorbidities was not independently associated with
mortality.
Conclusions
Thirty-day mortality rate in COVID-19 patients admitted to Swedish intensive care units is
generally lower than previously reported. Mortality appears to be driven by age, baseline
disease severity, the degree of organ failure and ICU treatment, rather than preexisting
comorbidities.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
In previous studies reporting outcomes for COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care
units (ICUs), none reported 30-day mortality rates, many were censored after short
observation periods, and most had substantial proportions of undischarged patients at the
time of follow-up. Incomplete data may cause bias in reported mortality rates. Further,
national data on critically ill patients have not been previously published.
Added value of this study
Our study provides complete 30-day follow up in a nationwide population of 1563
unselected patients admitted to intensive care units in Sweden. All but 15 patients had been
discharged from ICU at follow-up thus the study also provides an accurate reflection of ICU
mortality. We also provide age-stratified mortality rates and information on ICU treatment
and outcomes. This cohort also differs from previous studies in so far as directed antiviral
therapy for COVID-19 disease was infrequently used. Adjusted risk estimates for the effect of
baseline factors, ICU complications and treatment demonstrate that age, the severity of
respiratory failure and need for continuous renal replacement therapy were the most
important risk factors for death.
Implications of all the available evidence
Mortality rates of COVID-19 patients in Swedish ICUs are lower than those previously
reported, despite the high incidence of comorbidities, an ageing population and a high
proportion of patients with severe ARDS. Directed antiviral pharmacotherapy was given only
to a minority of patients suggesting that survival from COVID-19 in ICU is achievable with
good supportive care. Our analysis also suggests that unaccounted factors eg. process and
organizational, may be important in determining the outcome of critically ill patients with

COVID-19. Our results may be of interest since Sweden has a very limited number of ICU
beds and has adopted a unique response to the pandemic compared to other countries.
Despite limited numbers of ICU beds per capita, Sweden was able to increase its ICU capacity
during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic and provide essential care to the
critically ill with encouraging results.

Background
Since the initial detection of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus–2 (SARS
CoV-2) in Hubei Province, China over 16,000,000 cases have been confirmed worldwide.1
Admission rates to intensive care units (ICUs) vary substantially, ranging from 5% to 26% in
studies from China, Italy and the USA.2-6 Explanations for the differences between studies
include predisposing factors such as age and comorbidities, availability of ICU beds and
mechanical ventilation, as well as ICU admission and treatment practices. The availability of
testing also affects the denominator of these statistics, thus the true need for intensive care
among SARS-CoV-2 positive persons is difficult to estimate. Yet, knowledge of the incidence
and outcomes of critical illness is essential for disaster planning and there is a need to
accurately document the healthcare burden for future planning of hospital and ICU surge
capacity. Current data in critically ill populations are generally limited in sample size4,11-14,
with the largest report to date consisting of 1591 patients from the Lombardy Region in
Italy.5 Better and expedient information with minimal missing data and bias are needed to
inform the continued care of COVID-19 patients.

The Swedish Intensive Care Registry (SIR) collects data on patients admitted to ICUs, with
100% coverage since 2019. Thus, SIR is well-poised to report on outcomes in the intensive
care population. Little is known about the epidemiology of COVID-19 infections in Sweden,
which has one of the world’s highest life expectancies and a significant burden of
comorbidity. Sweden also has the second lowest number of ICU beds per capita in Europe
and has a low ICU-to-acute care bed ratio.15 For comparison, in the first quarter of 2020
Sweden had 5·1 ICU beds per 100000 population, compared to 27/100000 in the USA.16,17
The COVID-19 pandemic unleashed a coordinated response in Swedish Intensive Care Units

with an increase in the number of beds to 1131 at its peak (pers. comm. Anders Tegnell,
Public Health Agency of Sweden), which is twice the pre-pandemic level. Coupled with what
is widely perceived to be a ‘relaxed’ national pandemic strategy, results for ICU care in
Sweden are understandably under scrutiny. The main goal of this study is to describe
demographic characteristics, coexisting conditions, treatments and outcomes among
critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to Swedish ICUs during the first two months of
the pandemic. A secondary goal is to identify independent risk factors associated with
increased mortality for these patients.

Methods
This is a registry-based cohort study of all adult patients (≥18 years) admitted to Swedish
Intensive Care Units with PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease from
March 6 to May 6, 2020. The study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority
(no. 2020-01884 and 2020-02498). Written, informed consent was not required. Data on ICU
patients are routinely and prospectively uploaded to the SIR. All patients and/or their nextof-kin are informed of the registry and given the possibility to opt-out at any time.
Patients registered in SIR and its supplementary database Swedish Intensive Care Influenza
and Viral Infections Registry (SIRI) were eligible. The inclusion period of the study was 6
March (first Swedish COVID-19 case admitted to an ICU) to 6 May 2020 and the population
was retrieved from SIR using the diagnosis code U07.1. Only patients with complete 30-day
follow-up were included. The first ICU admission during this period for each patient was
defined as the index admission. Direct transfer to another ICU was regarded as a
continuation of the index admission. Only index admissions were included in the analysis.

Data regarding baseline characteristics including comorbidities, intensive care treatments
and outcomes were extracted. We also documented ICU length of stay and 30-day and ICUmortalities. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality.

Statistical considerations
Categorical variables are given as frequencies and percentages. Continuous variables are
described using medians and interquartile ranges. Simple statistical models are used to
provide 95% confidence intervals of the individual measured variables, to facilitate
comparisons with similar studies internationally, and future meta-analyses. Mann-Whitney U
tests, chi-squared or Fisher’s exact tests are used for comparisons of survivors vs nonsurvivors.

A multivariable model was used to determine the independent association between
predictor variables (e.g. age, sex, comorbidities, Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS
III) score, ICU treatments and complications) and the primary outcome. Predictor variables
were chosen on the basis of clinical plausibility and previous studies. Logistic regression was
used, and the independent effect (adjusted odds ratio) of different predictor variables
estimated from the model.

For categorical variables, a minimum of 10 cases in the smallest category was required for
inclusion in a univariable model. For quantitative variables, a minimum n = 30 was required.
Only variables with <10% missing data (minimum n = 1407) were included in the
multivariable model. Given the exploratory nature of the research, we place more emphasis

on the size of the effects found rather than on the outcome of significance tests (although
these were performed with a critical p < 0·05 for each test).
Since the degree of preparedness may have been limited during the early stages of the
pandemic, we planned a sensitivity analysis for patients admitted only within the first
month.

Results
A total of 2129 case episodes were registered in SIR between 6 March and 6 May, 2020.
After removal of duplicates and patients without a Swedish personal identification number,
we identified 1563 unique patients admitted to intensive care units in Sweden during the
first two months of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (Fig 1) with complete 30-day follow-up.

The median age for patients admitted to ICU was 61 (52-69). The median time from
symptoms to ICU admission was 10 (7-13) days and the median length of ICU stay was 12 (520) days. A majority has at least one comorbidity (66·8%), with hypertension, diabetes
mellitus, obesity (BMI>30) and chronic cardiopulmonary diseases being the most common
illnesses. The incidence of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) was 80·3%, with
74·7% classified as moderate or severe. Almost half of all patients developed acute kidney
injury and 18% received continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). ICU and 30-day
mortality rates were 23·2% and 26·7% respectively. At 30-day follow up, all but 15 patients
had been discharged from ICU, with the majority discharged to a hospital ward.
Characteristics and main outcomes of the population are shown in Table 1.

0·0001). Compared to patients without the comorbidity, 30-day mortality was significantly
higher among those with heart disease (37·3% vs 25·2%, p = 0·0007), hypertension (31·2% vs
23·7%, p = 0.001) and pre-existing lung disease (32·5% vs 25·6%, p = 0·0350), but not
diabetes mellitus (27·0% vs 26·5%, p = 0·842). Those with obesity had a significantly lower
30-day mortality rate (21·6% vs 27·7%, p = 0·0372; although this was not significant in the
multivariable analysis, see Table 3). Patients who were subjected to transfers to other ICUs
did not have a higher 30-day mortality (24·6% vs 27·4%, p = 0.273). Compared to survivors,
proportionally more nonsurvivors were treated with invasive mechanical ventilation, prone
positioning, specific COVID-19 pharmacotherapy and vasopressors or inotropes, and CRRT
(Table 2).

Univariable analysis demonstrated an association between the primary outcome and
increasing age, sex, most comorbidities, increasing SAPS III and SOFA scores, invasive
mechanical ventilation, prone positioning, the use of CRRT, vasopressors and inotropes, as
well as specific COVID-19 pharmacotherapy.

Multivariable analysis was applied to 1474 patients with the full dataset. Increasing age,
SAPS III score, severe ARDS, the use of CRRT and specific pharmacotherapy against COVID-19
were identified as independent risk factors for 30-day all-cause mortality. The use of high
flow nasal oxygen was protective, an effect retained even after adjustment for confounders.
Except for chronic lung disease, none of the other registered comorbidities were associated
with the primary outcome after adjustment (Table 3).

A sensitivity analysis limiting the cohort to patients admitted within the first 30 days of the
pandemic indicated that 30-day mortality was higher during this period compared to the
second 30 days (OR 1·9 [1·5-2·4]), Fisher's Exact Test, p-value < 0.0001) with no interaction
between admission period and the other terms in the multivariable model (Likelihood ratio
test, χ2 = 32·5, p = 0·115). Risk estimates for all covariates were similar compared to the
whole cohort (Supplementary Table 1).

Discussion
In this study of early admissions to Swedish ICUs, we found a 30-day all-cause mortality of
26·7% and ICU mortality of 23·2% for adult patients admitted with COVID-19. With the
exception of a case series from Vancouver, Canada10, these mortality rates are generally
lower than those previously reported in ICU populations. Comparison of mortality rates
across studies is difficult due to different lengths of follow-up and significant proportions of
patients remaining in ICU at follow-up in many studies.5,6,8,11,12,14 Our results compare
favorably to a recent systematic review that reported an ICU mortality of 41·6% for patients
with completed ICU admissions.14 We also noted a decrease in mortality rates in the second
half of our population. Our results add to current knowledge by providing a longer and
complete follow-up for an unselected, nationwide ICU population. Characteristics and

outcomes of the present population, and those of other ICU populations are summarized in
Supplementary Table 2. The 30-day mortality rate is only slightly higher than ICU mortality
rates for our population, indicating that most patients succumb during ICU care.

We confirm previous findings4,5,7,10,13 that mortality rates are significantly higher among
those aged >65 years. Very old patients (>80 years of age) made up 3·4% of all admissions,
within the range reported in previous studies.4,5,9,13 The mortality in this group was high,
60·4% in our study compared to 35-100% in Wuhan4,13, 63% in New York9, and 55% in
Lombardy5 although the latter is likely an underestimation with 36% of patients still in ICU at
the time of data collection. These data should however be interpreted with caution since
sample sizes are very small and not likely representative of the population means. Although
octogenarians have a >6·5-fold adjusted risk of death compared to those <50 years of age,
our data demonstrate that provision of intensive care should not be restricted on the basis
of age alone.

A majority of patients suffered from comorbidities, the most commonly hypertension,
diabetes and obesity. Whilst most comorbidities were associated with the primary outcome
in univariable analyses, their effects were no longer significant after multivariable
adjustment. The exception was chronic lung disease, which was associated with a 1·6-fold
risk of death. These findings are consistent with a recent case series from New York9 and
deviate from other studies that have not adjusted for confounders.4,5 Obesity was not
associated with increased mortality as suggested by other studies.18,19 These differences may
be due to differences in adjustment for other confounders and risk modifiers, or the
definition of obesity.

The median ICU length of stay (LOS) for this cohort exceeds that for ICU patients in Sweden
prior to the pandemic.20 As a comparison, the median LOS for influenza cases during 2015-19
was 3·65 days.21 We also observed a higher incidence of AKI than has been previously
reported13,22, and have identified only one other study with reported incidences in excess of
30%11. Of those with documented AKI, 38% suffered from severe kidney injury defined as
Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 3. We can only speculate as to the
causes of the high incidence of AKI, which may be due to a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 on
the kidneys or a consequence of treatment in intensive care such as fluid restriction and
nephrotoxic agents. We demonstrate for the first time that CRRT is independently
associated with 30-day mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19, with a 2-fold
increased adjusted risk. Our findings support those observed by Cheng et al. that
demonstrated an independent association between the degree of AKI and in-hospital
mortality.23 These findings highlight the importance of potentially preventable complications
for survival outcomes.

Eighty percent of patients received invasive mechanical ventilation, less than those reported
in Lombardy5 (88%) and Vitoria12 (94%) despite more severe hypoxemia on admission in our
population. The high proportion of moderate-severe ARDS in this population may be a
consequence of Swedish ICU admission policies. Of note, only severe ARDS was
independently associated with mortality. A larger proportion (40%) patients were cared for
in the prone position compared to previous reports4,5,9,10, possibly reflecting the availability
of nursing resources. Swedish ICUs employ nurses’ aides to facilitate nursing care, and
during the pandemic medical students were also recruited to assist in this role. The use of

high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) was protective even after adjustment for baseline disease
severity and degree of ARDS. However, unaccounted confounders may explain this effect,
and our experience is that most patients were intubated expediently either on arrival to, or
prior to ICU admission due to the severity of hypoxemia, and not often extubated to HFNO.

Another noteworthy observation was that only 22% of patients received specific
pharmacotherapy for COVID-19 disease compared to 38-100% in previous reports
(Supplementary Table 3).4,5,6,7,11-13 The vast majority were treated with Chloroquine or
Hydroxychloroquine during the first month of data collection. Only five patients received this
drug in the second month of data collection consistent with compliance with the European
Medicines Agency directive published on 1 April, 2020 for use of the Chloroquine and
Hydroxychloroquine only within clinical trials of emergency use programs. Although we
demonstrated an increased risk of death associated with COVID-19 pharmacotherapy in the
whole cohort, this finding should be interpreted cautiously since the present study was not
designed to assess such an effect.

We chose a simple, exploratory, multivariable model with covariates chosen based on
previous findings, clinical plausibility and the availability of data. In general, 30-day mortality
was less driven by preexisting comorbidities than variables reflecting severity of organ
failure such as ARDS and CRRT. Unfortunately, the degree of missing data for treatment with
vasopressors and inotropes precluded its entry into the multivariable analysis. Nevertheless,
the avoidance of further deterioration of pulmonary and renal function seems to be a
prudent strategy for supportive care, in the absence of specific COVID-19 therapy. We are
encouraged by the generally lower mortality rates than previously reported, that was

achievable by supportive care. We hypothesize that process and organizational factors have
likely contributed to the relatively good outcomes seen in Swedish ICUs as staffing,
protective equipment, availability of drugs, medical and technical equipment were
considered within the pandemic plans at an early stage at hospital and regional levels.

The ICU admission rate among test positive persons for the first two months of the
pandemic in Sweden was 6·5% (1608 of 24722 test positive on 6 May 2020, pers. comm.
Anders Tegnell, Public Health Agency of Sweden) 24 similar to that described by the Chinese
Centre for Disease Control, where 5% of 72314 confirmed cases of COVID 19 were classified
as ‘critical’ ie. respiratory failure, septic shock and/or multiple organ failure.3 Other studies
document ICU admission rates of 8% among hospitalized patients in a single center in
Wuhan4, 14·2% among hospitalized patients in New York2 and 9% among test positive
persons in the Lombardy region5. The lower proportion of ICU admissions due to COVID-19
in Sweden may reflect the very limited availability of ICU beds, and organizational
differences between countries.

The encouraging outcomes for the intensive care population are in contrast to those
reported from nursing and aged care facilities who make up the majority of deaths in SARSCoV-2 positive patients in Sweden.25 We believe it is unlikely that intensive care admission
would have been effective in preventing these deaths, given the extremes of frailty, age and
comorbidities in this population group. These results should also be interpreted within the
wider context of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Sweden. The pandemic response in Sweden, with
a population of 10 million, has been different from other countries, with emphasis on
individual social responsibility. The main strategy is to maintain hygiene, practice distancing

to avoid close contacts, limit the size of social gatherings, as well as voluntary closure of
large winter resorts and mandatory closure of some leisure centres, with enforcement of
distancing rules in restaurants. The results of this approach appear to have been successful
in so far as the health care system capacity in Sweden has not been overwhelmed. The
number of available ICU beds was doubled but the proportion of occupied ICU beds in the
country during the study period never reached maximal capacity (pers. comm. Anders
Tegnell, Public Health Agency of Sweden). To cope with the increased flow of patients,
specific COVID-19 disaster management plans were activated and all hospitals repurposed
other units to admit COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care. Intermediary care units
were opened. A massive educational effort was launched to prepare physicians and nurses
not traditionally involved in the care of the critically ill to provide this level of care under the
supervision of intensivists. Also, anesthesia and intensive care are combined specialities in
Sweden, and physicians have dual competence in these areas which facilitated rapid
diversion of resources from perioperative to intensive care. Sweden also has a large number
of nurse-anesthestists, who, although not specifically trained in intensive care, were
expediently deployed for care of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients after short
‘refresher’ courses. Elective surgical procedures were postponed and many postoperative
care units were converted to pandemic ICUs instead. This mitigated situations of acute
staffing, bed and equipment shortages. While this has been advantageous in the short-term,
the longer-term effects are still unknown. Future staffing shortages, the looming possibility
of burn-out and numerous organizational challenges remain. A significant burden is the
management patients that did not receive care during the pandemic. For example, Sweden
now has a massive backlog of elective surgical procedures with a cumulative reduction of
60% during the first 2 months of the study.26

Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature, although data was prospectively
registered in a large centralized database. We were unable to explore outcomes related to
ethnicity or socioeconomic status as these are not registered in SIR. Specific data on
laboratory variables such as lymphocyte counts and inflammatory parameters, ventilatory
modes, sedation and analgesia and imaging were not recorded. Complications related
COVID-19 are reported by each unit but are not validated and the degree of missing data
varies widely from 100% for delirium and myocardial injury to 61% for acute kidney injury.
Important complications such as venous thromboembolism, cardiac injury and cognitive
dysfunction at discharge are not systematically queried and are likely to be substantially
underreported in the SIRI database. While we make observations regarding pharmacological
treatment and availability of ICU beds, any relationship with outcomes are purely
speculative. Finally, we only capture data for the first two months of ICU admission and
reported outcomes may change over the course of time; and may not be generalizable
outside Sweden.

The strengths of this study are that it encompassed an unselected population in Sweden,
and captured the peak of COVID-19 admissions to intensive care units. This is significant in
so far as it covers the period during which the intensive care capacity was maximally
stressed, with possible consequences of outcome. We noted a significantly higher 30-day
mortality during first 30 days of the study period. This was an effect of admission period
only, as there were no interactions between this and any of the other covariates, and the
risk estimates for individual covariates remained similar throughout. Thus, unaccounted
confounders (eg. availability of beds, personnel and familiarity with COVID-19 care,

differences in supportive treatments) are likely to be in play. Data beyond 30 days are not
yet available and it would be relevant to investigate long-term outcomes to assess the true
burden of COVID-19 disease.

All but 15 patients had been discharged from ICU at follow-up thus the study also provides
an accurate reflection of ICU mortality. Another strength of this study is the full coverage of
SIR during our inclusion period (100% from 2019, pers. comm. Riitva Kiiski Berggren, Swedish
Intensive Care Registry), completeness and accuracy of the routinely collected variables and
validation of these basic ICU data by SIR. All eligible patients were included thus selection
bias is minimal. Mortality outcomes were available for all patients, except 45 persons
without a Swedish personal identification number, and verified in the Swedish Registry of
Deaths. This is in contrast to previous studies where data were censored at various
timepoints after ICU admission and with substantial proportions of patients still in ICU at
follow up.5,9,11,12

Conclusion
In conclusion, mortality rates in COVID-19 patients admitted to Swedish intensive care units
are generally lower than previously reported. Mortality appears to be driven by age, baseline
disease severity, the degree of organ failure and ICU treatment, rather than preexisting
comorbidities.
