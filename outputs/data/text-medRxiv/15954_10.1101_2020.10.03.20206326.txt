ABSTRACT
As COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the United States, there has been a
search for policies to prevent individual infections, to slow the spread of the virus in
general, and to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. Masks have proven to
be a cost-effective measure in all regards, and as such some state governments have
begun to mandate their use. However, while the efficacy of masks has been
demonstrated, the efficacy of public policies which mandate the use of masks has not
been demonstrated. This paper compares the rates of mask use in counties as defined
by state policy. It finds that state mandates are strongly correlated with higher rates of
mask use, and that mandating use by all individuals in public spaces is more effective
than a less comprehensive mandate for mask use by all public facing employees.

INTRODUCTION
At the time of writing, the COVID-19 pandemic has killed over 175,000 people in the
United States alone1. It has drastically impacted economic activity, producing an
annualized US GDP contraction of ~30%, the largest economic contraction since the
Great Depression2. One tool that can be used to reduce the impact of COVID-19 is
wearing a face mask in public. Face masks are a cost-effective tool in contending with
respiratory infections3. Face mask use reduces the airborne inoculum of COVID-194 5 6 7
, and there is some empirical evidence that mask use reduces the spread of COVID-198
9 10 11. The evidence for state policies’ impacts on the use of face masks by the public is
more limited12. To explore the relationship between state policy and public use of face
masks, a previously reported survey of mask use was analyzed and compared between
three distinct populations based upon their state-level policies in the United States13.

This retrospective cohort study was performed to assess the equality of the three
populations for reported face mask usage.

METHODS
A comparative analysis of state level mask policy on public face mask use in the United
States was undertaken. Data for mask use was from a previously reported survey 13.
The three groups for comparison were defined by their state level mask policy. The first,
states with no state level mask mandate (None). The second, those with state level
mandated mask use for public facing employees (Public). The third, those with a state
level mandate for all Individuals in public spaces (All). States with a mandate for both
public facing Employees and all individuals in public spaces were treated as belonging
to the more restrictive All group.
Survey results were calculated for the 3,142 Federal Information Processing Standard
(FIPS) counties14 in the United States and the District of Columbia from 7/2/2020 until
7/14/2020. The original data on mask usage is from the New York Times and Dynata
online survey of 250,000 individuals from the 74,134 US census tracts 13. The survey
data was weighted by age and gender, and survey respondents’ locations were
approximated from their ZIP codes to transform raw survey responses into county-level
estimates. Then mask-wearing estimates were made for each census tract by taking a
weighted average of the 200 nearest responses, with closer responses getting more
weight in the average. The county-level estimates were assigned to one of three groups
defined by their state mask policy. The comparison is a retrospective cohort study which
uses the state level mask mandate as of 7/2/2020, reported in the COVID-19 US state
policy database (CUSP)15, defining the three groups.
The original survey asked:
“How often do you wear a mask in public when you expect to be within six feet of
another person?”
With responses:
“NEVER”, “RARELY”, “SOMETIMES”, “FREQUENTLY” or “ALWAYS” reported
as a percentage of responses for each county.
Additionally, a county Mask Score was calculated as a weighted score for each county.
Mask Score = (%NEVER*0) + (%RARELY*1) + (%SOMETIMES*2) +
(%FREQUENTLY*3) + (%ALWAYS*4)
The three comparison groups were defined by their state policy of face mask use as
described above:

None (1,124 Counties): CO, FL, GA, ID, IA, KS, LA, MO, MT, NH, OK, SC, SD,
TN, VT and WI
Public Facing Employees (945 Counties): AL, AK, AZ, AR, MN, MS, NE, ND,
OH, TX, WV and WY
All Individuals in Public (1,068 Counties): CA, CT, DE, DC, HI, IL, IN, KY, ME,
MD, MA, MI, NV, NJ, NM, NY, NC, OR, PA, RI, UT, VA and WA

Each group of the three comparison groups were examined for normality with the
Shapiro-Francia test for normality, intended for samples of up to 5,000 observations16.
To visualize the degree of skewness between the three populations a skewness test for
normality was determined17 18. Analysis of equality-of-populations test was performed
using the Kruskal –Wallis test19 20 Statistical analysis was done with Stata 16.121.

Potential bias rests principally in the original survey. Respondents were surveyed online
and may be representative of subjects more concerned about COVID-19. Additionally,
as with any self -report, social desirability impacts reporting. The strength of the study
lies in its large sample size and in its geographic reach.

RESULTS
The Shapiro-Francia test for normal data show that responses in the group None was
normally distributed (p=0.067) but that the responses in the groups Public and All were
not normally distributed (p ≤ 0.001). The equality of populations test was therefore
determined by the Kruskal-Willis test. The populations were statistically significantly
different from each other (p ≤ 0.001).

All differences between groups are statistically significant with p ≤ 0.0001. Mask Score
for each of the 3124 counties studied was determined by the weighted sum of
responses such that MASK SCORE = (%NEVER*0) + (%RARELY*1) +

DISTRIBUTION OF COUNTY MASK SCORE BY POLICY

County mask scores show a shift from normal distribution of mask use for people living
in counties with no mask mandate (NONE skewness of -0.01) to progressively more
significant skewness for counties with a mask mandate for all public facing employees
(PUBLIC skewness of -0.20) and the greatest skewness for the more universal
mandate for all individuals in public (ALL skewness of -0.57).

DISCUSSION
Different state policies are related to three different patterns of reported mask use. The
more comprehensive the state policy the larger the scale of change – halving the
percent of NEVERS and increasing the percent of ALWAYS by a third. The distribution
of the responses was normal for the county Mask Score for states with No mandate, but
skewed in the states with mask mandates, perhaps indicating an impact of the
mandates in shifting attitudes toward face mask use in public.
These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that public policies impact public
behaviors relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. The policy of state level mask mandates
appears to increase the use of masks in public. While these results are not sufficient to
demonstrate a causal impact on COVID-19 spread, they are suggestive that
governmental policies related to mask use may help limit COVID-19 spread. These
results further suggest that mask policies may help reduce the health and economic
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, these empirical results have clear
