ABSTRACT: COVID-19 is an emerging and rapidly evolving pandemic around the world, which causes severe acute

6

respiratory syndrome and results in substantial morbidity and mortality. To examine the transmission dynamics of COVID-

7

19 and its interactions with some exogenous factors such as limited medical resources and false detection problems, we

8

employ a simple epidemiological model and analyse this system using modelling and dynamical systems techniques. We

9

discover some contrasting findings with respect to the observations of basic reproduction number, and we investigate how

10

the issues of limited medical resources and false detection problems affect the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.

INTRODUCTION

12

Recently, a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 (or previously referred to as 2019-nCoV) has been identified

13

as the causes of a severe acute respiratory syndrome and a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China 1, 2 .

14

This virus rapidly spreads throughout China, followed by increasing number of cases across the globe, which

15

lead to pandemic outbreaks in different countries such as United States, Italy, Malaysia 2 . The World Health

16

Organization terms the disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 virus as COVID-19, which refers to coronavirus

17

disease 2019.

18

In curbing the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia, the government through its Ministry of Health has

19

announced a targeted testing approach so as to optimally use the country’s limited medical resources 3 . In

20

targeted testing, the tests are conducted based on location of COVID-19 hotspots and high-risk groups only 3 .

21

However, this approach has been questioned by some medical practitioners 4 , which reckon that Malaysia should

22

conduct COVID-19 testings as wide as possible (i.e., mass testing) so that these tests would be able to pick up

23

most (if not all) of the possible cases; this crucial information can help government to devise an effective contact

24

tracing strategy, and these possible patients could be placed on 14-day quarantine to contain the spread of the

25

disease.

26

Motivated by the aforementioned problem, we utilise a simple epidemiological system with limited medical

resources component, which results in the possibility of under-testing issue. Inspired by the previous reports 5, 6 ,

28

the problem of false detection (i.e., false negative tests) and the possibility of ‘reinfection’ are also investigated

29

by employing our Susceptible-Infected-Removed-Susceptible (SIRS)-type system, based on daily reported

30

cases in Malaysia, which is used a case study.
2.

MODEL AND METHODS

31

To model the combined effects of limited medical resources and false detection problems in shaping the COVID-

32

19 pandemic, we revisit a simple ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of SIRS-type 7–10 :

34

where population of N individuals are divided into three compartments: S(t) corresponds to susceptible

35

population, which can be infected (with transmission rate of β); I(t) corresponds to the number of infectious

36

individuals and R(t) corresponds to the removal class where those individuals who have recovered (with

37

recovery rate of γ) or dead are removed from the population. The parameters µ and ν correspond to the birth

38

and death rates of the population, respectively. To investigate the impacts of false detection on COVID-19

39

transmission dynamics, we allow for some proportions of individuals from the removal compartment to re-enter

40

the susceptible class (at a transfer rate of ε); this component is also used as a proxy to account for the likelihood

41

of ‘reinfection’: it has been reported that, until this research work is conducted, we do not know whether some

42

of the COVID-19 patients who have recovered are truly been ‘reinfected’, or, at the time of their ‘recovery’,

43

they still had low levels of the virus in their systems 5 . There is also no evidence whether people have herd

44

or long-term immunity against this new coronavirus attack 6 . Another concern in controlling this pandemic is

45

about the issue of under-testing for COVID-19, which is evident in some developing countries; this situation

46

occurs due to limited medical resources such as tests, drugs and hospital beds 3, 11, 12 . To study the consequence

47

of the limited medical resources on the spread of COVID-19 outbreak, we employ the term of

48

motivated by Zhou and Fan 9 : the parameter α > 0 represents the medical resources supplied per unit time and

49

ω > 0 corresponds to half-saturation constant, which measures the efficiency of the medical resource supply

50

(i.e., if ω is smaller, then the efficiency is higher). In fact, this quantity also represents the efficiency of the

51

supply of available medical resources, and this situation would also depend on other factors such as the control

The model (1) has two types of steady states, which are disease-free and pandemic equilibria: (i) disease

56

to determine stability of each of these steady states. To obtain basic reproduction numbers, R0 , we used the next

57

generation matrix method (and the correstness of these quantities are checked using eigenvalues analysis). The

58

simplest SIR system can obtained from the model (1) by letting µ = ν = ε = α = 0, with basic reproduction

Numerical simulations are conducted for the model (1) and the results are discussed in the next sections. As a

68

case study, the transmission dynamics are investigated using daily confirmed cases in Malaysia, where some of

69

the parameters are estimated based on the fitting of the model (1) to COVID-19 cases in the interval between

70

March 24 and April 23, 2020 13 . Unless otherwise stated, parameter values used in the simulation are given in

71

figure captions. In all cases, we employed numerical simulation using MATLAB ode15s solver. We also used

72

numerical continuation package XPPAUT to perform one- and two-parameter bifurcation analysis; the stable

73

and unstable steady states are tracked as a model parameter changes.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

74

First, we consider a simple scenario shown by Fig. 1A where the assumption of limited medical resources

75

is relaxed (i.e., α = 0) and there is no possibility of false detection or ‘reinfection’ (i.e., ε = 0) in this

76

epidemiological system. This situation corresponds to the dynamics of basic SIR model (solid lines) with

77

R0S = 2.7586: we observe that the active cases increase on daily basis until the infection curve (solid red)

The Predictions of SIR and SIRS Models Based on Malaysia COVID-19 Scenario

based on predictions of SIRS model: as R0u < 1, the pandemic can be excluded; when R0u > 1, the pandemic persists for a
long period of time. Other parameter values: β = 0.16 (fitted), γ = 0.058 (fitted), µ = ν = 0.00002 14, N = S + I + R and
ε = 0.0009 (fitted).

peaks around first week of April; this observation is in agreement with the number of reported active COVID-

79

19 cases in Malaysia (cyan asterick), which peaks around April 5-8, 2020 with the highest 2596 active cases

80

recorded on April 5. Consequently, the number of active cases start to decrease and SIR model predicts that

81

infection will be excluded in the long run.

82

The predictions of SIR represents an ‘ideal’ situation, assumming medical resources to fight this pandemic

83

are being allocated enough, apart from citizens have been screeneed massively and detected (i.e., quarantined)

84

quickly; additionally, it is also assumed that the test results are reliable and can be trusted. In reality, some

85

nations especially the developing countries (e.g., Malaysia, Vietnam, etc.), face the risk of under-screening due

86

to limited medical resources, and also the possibility of false detection. To illustrate the impacts of inaccurate

87

detection or ‘reinfection’ problem using SIRS system (1), we let ε > 0 (keeping α = 0) and the results

88

are plotted in Fig. 1A (dashed lines). In comparison to our previous predictions of COVID-19 transmission

89

dynamics in Malaysia, we realise that SIR and SIRS observations are indistinguishable before the infection

90

peak; after the infected trajectories reach the peak point, SIRS results show worst-case scenario with increasing

91

number of infectious (dashed red) and susceptible (dashed black) individuals; in this case, SIRS demonstrates

92

that the pandemic will persist for a long time. This is in agreement with our analysis of basic reproduction

93

number: R0u is calculated to be 2.7577 using equation (3) for Malaysia’s COVID-19 scenario (in practice,

94

R0u > 1 implies a pandemic outbreak). In order to control this pandemic, it is vital to employ proper mitigation

95

measures such as quarantine, travel restrictions and social distancing; these strategies can help to push R0u to

The Predictions of SIRS Model with Limited Medical Resources Scenario

96

be less than 1, which in principle can eradicate this pandemic in a long run (Fig. 1B).

97

However, the use of basic reproduction number should be interpreted with care in managing the deadly

98

and fast evolving pandemic outbreaks such as COVID-19. Other counterintuitive observations are also possible

99

even when R0 < 1. To illustrate this observation, we consider our SIRS model with limited medical resources

100

scenario (i.e., ε > 0 and α > 0). Fig. 2A depicts an example of bifurcation analysis of the model (1) with

101

β = 0.095 and ε = 0.0009 as the efficiency of the medical resource supply (ω) is varied. There occurs one

102

critical value i.e., ωT , which corresponds to transcritical bifurcation (blue point). From an epidemiological

103

viewpoint, ωT is a minimum threshold of medical resource supply to ensure the infection dynamics can be

104

reduced efficiently and effectively. There are also several branches of steady states: (i) the upper branch

105

(pandemic equilibrium) is always stable (red curve); (ii) lower branch (disease-free equilibrium) can be stable

106

(red curve) or unstable (black curve), depending on the values of ω. When ω < ωT , we observe the occurrence

107

of alternative stable states, with both pandemic and disease-free equilibria are stable; convergence to either one

108

of these steady states depends on initial abundances of individuals in susceptible, infected and removal classes.

109

When ω > ωT , this situation leads to rapidly evolving pandemic outbreaks. Closer examination of these

110

outcomes reveals that R0L of SIRS model (1) with limited medical resources scenario is 0.8396 (calculated

111

using equation (4)) when ω < ωT . While basic reproduction number is less than 1 in this case, it is observed

112

that the COVID-19 pandemic is still likely to occur due to a relatively small basin of attractions of disease-

113

free equilbrium (lower branch steady state), which can cause a catastrophic shift to pandemic equilbrium (upper

114

branch steady state). In general, the two bistable attractors are separated by a basin boundary (unstable pandemic

115

equilibrium), which determines the long-term dynamics of this epidemiological system.

116

Based on equation (4), we also notice some mechanisms that can result in R0L to be shifted to larger values:

117

(i) higher magnitudes of ω indicate inefficiency or lack of medical resource supply, which consequently could

118

lead to pandemic outbreaks; (ii) as the transmission rate, β, is higher, the pace of pandemic spread increases

119

significantly. To demonstrate these mechanisms, we plotted a two-parameter bifurcation diagram in Fig. 2B as

120

ω and β are varied. The blue and red curves correspond to transcritical bifurcations, and the interaction between

121

these two local bifurcations determine the dynamical behaviours of this epidemiological system and separate the

122

parameter space into three different regions: (i) purple region corresponds to pandemic equilibrium; (ii) cyan

123

region corresponds to disease-free equilibrium; (iii) green region corresponds the appearance of alternative

124

stable states between pandemic and disease-free outcomes. We can see that an increase in ω and β will

125

dramatically increase R0L , and this situation can be detrimental in controlling the negative impacts of COVID-

126

19, as more outcomes of pandemic outbreak are possible.

4.

CONCLUSION

127

In this study, the most important case that we identified is the possibility of a COVID-19 pandemic through

128

bistable behaviour, even when the basic reproduction number is less than unity. This scenario is observed when

129

certain complexities such as limited medical resources and false detection problems are incorporated into the

130

model, which make the epidemiological system to be more realistic. Based on these findings, we caution policy

131

makers not to make their decisions solely based on the guidance of the basic reproduction number only, which

132

clearly courting trouble. This is because other factors such as alternative stable states phenomenon can interfere

133

with distinct epidemiological forces and lead to catastrophic shifts in transmission dynamics. We recommend

134

for the existing policies in Malaysia e.g., movement control order, quarantine and social distancing to be further

135

practiced so as to break the chain of infections and flatten the infection curve, given the country’s limited

136

medical resources scenario and other pressing issues such as the risk of under-screening. Careful consideration

137

of these issues will minimise spurious conclusions and maximise the amount of knowledge extracted from our

138

modelling practices, which can also promote an evidence-based decision making in public health sector.
