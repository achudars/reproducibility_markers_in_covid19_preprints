Abstract

Background and Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has heavily hit Brazil and, in particular,
our Clinic’s current location in Copacabana – Rio de Janeiro city, where, as of mid-February
2021, it led to one death per 266 inhabitants. After having recently updated the vital status
and mortality data in our exercise population (CLINIMEX exercise cohort), we hypothesized
that the review of their evaluation reports would offer a unique opportunity to unearth some
relevant information about the association between selected variables assessed in our
comprehensive Exercise Medicine evaluation protocol, in particular, aerobic and
musculoskeletal (MUSK) fitness, clinical variables, and death due to COVID-19.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective study using data from the CLINIMEX exercise cohort
that included 6,101 non-athletic men and women aged >30 years who were alive as of
March 12 , 2020, and who’s vital status was followed up to December 14 , 2020. For data
analysis, two approaches were used: 1) comparison of frequency of deaths and relative % of
underlying causes of death between the last 18-months pre-pandemic and 9-month
pandemic periods; and 2) data from 51 variables from the participant’s most recent
evaluation, including sex, age and clinical profile plus other variables obtained from physical
examination, spirometry, (MUSK) fitness (e.g., sitting-rising test) and maximal cycling leg
cardiopulmonary exercise testing (e.g. maximal VO and cardiorespiratory optimal point)
were selected for comparison between groups of non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 deaths.
Results: Age at death varied from 51 to 102 years [mean = 80 years]. Only 4 participants
that died – 3 COVID-19 and 1 non-COVID-19 - were healthy at the time of their evaluation
[p=.52]. COVID-19 was the most frequent (n=35; 36.5%) cause of death among the 96
deaths during this 9-month period. Comparing pre-pandemic and pandemic periods, there
was a 35% increase in deaths and proportionately fewer deaths due to neoplasia and other
causes other than cardiovascular or endocrine diseases. Results of aerobic and MUSK fitness
tests indicated that the majority of the study participants were relatively unfit when
compared to available age and sex-reference values. Indeed, there were few differences in
the 51 selected variables between the two groups, suggesting a somewhat healthier profile
among COVID-19 death participants: lower body mass index [p=.04], higher % of predicted
forced vital capacity [p=.04], lower number of previous percutaneous coronary interventions
[p=.04] and lower resting supine diastolic blood pressure [p=.03], with no differences for
aerobic/MUSK fitness variables or past history of exercise/sports [p>.05].
Conclusion: Our data support that COVID-19 was a frequent and premature cause of death in
a convenience sample of primarily white, unhealthy, middle-age and elderly individuals and
that data from exercise/sport history and physical fitness testing obtained some years earlier
were unable to distinguish non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 deaths.

Introduction

We all know that death is inevitable but we do not know
when it will occur and what its cause will be. Maybe
knowing more about this might enable us to delay our
death
As of the current date (mid-February, 2021), more than 200 countries and territories
have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching extraordinary numbers of worldwide
confirmed cases of >110 million affected individuals and >2.4 million deaths due to COVID19, with 7-day moving averages slightly dropping from a recent peak of 750,000 new cases
and 15,000 deaths per day.(1)
However, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as its temporal trends and its
public health effects, varied throughout the different countries and regions around the world.
For instance, whichever criteria is applied, the United States and Brazil emerged as the two
most affected countries, both in absolute and relative (per capita) number of cases,
hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, even though they represent together only 6.9% of the
world population, approximately one third of all confirmed cases and deaths from COVID-19
have occurred in either one of these two countries.(1) Therefore, the number of cases and
deaths in both Brazil and the United States is four to five times higher than the world’s
average, despite their widely recognized high-level quality of medical technology and human
resources. (2-6)
Just over a year after the World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 was a
public health emergency of international concern, a “coronavirus cascade” has occurred in
scientific journals.(7) More than 100,000 COVID-19-related papers were published in PubMed
and >10,000 in MedRvix. With the primary goal of sharing knowledge as fast as possible
about the spread of the disease and its prevention and treatment, researchers around the
world raced to share their work on COVID-19. However, it is particularly interesting that
despite this large volume of papers, original scientific data about the relationship between
COVID-19 and physical activity, exercise, sport practice and physical fitness are still scarce.(813) Since both cardiorespiratory or aerobic (14, 15) and musculoskeletal (MUSK) (16) fitness
are positively and strongly associated with longer survival and several other favorable (but
not all) health outcomes (17), it is plausible to speculate that individuals with higher fitness
levels would have a more benign clinical course once infected by COVID-19. Indeed, there are
very limited data on this matter and somewhat conflicting results (17-20). Moreover, to the
best of our knowledge, there are no data regarding the potential association between
exercise-related variables and the most relevant outcome, i.e., death from COVID-19.

This is of particularly interest as following strict recommendations from health
authorities and institutions to stay home, maintain physical distancing and use mask, not
surprisingly led to a significant drop in regular exercise and sports participation globally,
contributing to a growing prevalence of sedentary lifestyle.(8, 9, 21-26) Even exercise-based
cardiac rehabilitation programs were strongly affected, and thousands of exercise programs
around the world had to interrupt their services either temporarily or permanently, or
innovate with the help of modern technology and telemedicine resources in order to provide
their services and keep their patients physically active.(27-30).
The first COVID-19 case in the city of Rio de Janeiro was recorded on March 6 , 2020,
just 11 days after Brazil’s first registered case.(31) As of mid-February, COVID-19 mortality
per one million inhabitants reached 1,810 in Rio de Janeiro state (17,366,189 inhabitants
and 397 inhabitants/km ) increasing substantially to 2,700 in Rio de Janeiro city (6,747,815
inhabitants and 5,265 inhabitants/km )(32) with a very high demographic density. However,
as mentioned above, even in a single city such as Rio de Janeiro, huge inequalities can occur
due to demographic characteristics, including population density and median age of
inhabitants in given areas of the city.(31) For example, the 161,178 inhabitants of
Copacabana (~30% ≥60 years of age) have been extremely affected by the COVID-19
pandemic. In Copacabana, a famous upper middle-class and commercial coastline area, the
inhabitants live primarily in apartment buildings that are literally packed in 7,84 km
(including some green and mountain areas), with some statistics suggesting that the actual
population density may reach the astonishing figure of 3.5 inhabitants/m . Indeed, by again
using mid-February/2021 for comparison purposes, Copacabana had registered 600 deaths,
reflecting the tragedy of COVID-19 mortality of 3,750 per one million inhabitants, or 1 death
per 266 inhabitants.

Located in one of the major streets of Copacabana (south zone of Rio de Janeiro city),
the Exercise Medicine Clinic (CLINIMEX) is a privately-owned medical enterprise founded at
the beginning of 1994, aiming to primarily provide medical services through comprehensive
evaluation protocols and advanced medically-supervised exercise programs. Additionally,
CLINIMEX conducts continuing education and has a strong interest and focus on developing
innovations and high-quality research in the areas of exercise and health. As part of these
actions, since its beginning, the CLINIMEX cohort study was planned and implemented,
including all the participants who attended the Clinic for an Exercise Medicine evaluation
and/or to attend a medically-supervised exercise program. Over these 27 years, the
CLINIMEX cohort data with detailed information on aerobic or cardiorespiratory and nonaerobic or MUSK fitness have been carefully obtained and organized, allowing the research
team – researchers and graduate students from different universities – to develop several

scientific studies and to publish a number of papers and books at local, regional, national
and international journals and/or publishers.
Periodically, as has recently occurred, vital status and mortality data of this cohort are
updated. In reviewing a 9-month period, from mid-March/2020 – when Brazil had its first
confirmed COVID-19 death – to mid-December/2020, a total of 97 deaths for different
causes were identified in the participants of our cohort. Therefore, the analysis of the
CLINIMEX cohort data provided a unique opportunity to analyze potential associations
between the variables assessed in our comprehensive Exercise Medicine evaluation protocol,
in particular, aerobic and MUSK physical fitness and clinical variables and death due to
COVID19.

Methods
Study Sample
This is a retrospective study using the CLINIMEX open cohort that includes 9,243
participants evaluated at CLINIMEX from 1994 to December 14 , 2020. In brief, it is
important to emphasize that this is a convenience and voluntary sample that substantially
differs from the typical Rio de Janeiro’s city average population in terms of ethnic origin and
socioeconomic status. While these items were not objectively assessed, it is assumed that
almost all of the participants evaluated are in the upper quintile of the population for
socioeconomic status and more than 90% are white. Moreover, despite the fact that about
10% are athletes(33) and nearly 20% of the participants were apparently healthy based on
their baseline evaluation in the Clinic, the vast majority of the participants had chronic
diseases, primarily cardiovascular diseases. Most of these participants were referred for
evaluation at CLINIMEX by their own attending private physicians and the evaluations were
paid by themselves and/or by their own personal/company medical insurance plan. Around
22% of the participants were evaluated more than once, comprising a total of 13,575
evaluations in these over 26 years. More details of the CLINIMEX cohort are provided in
supplemental materials.
th

For the present study, a selected sample was obtained by applying the following
exclusion criteria: 1) classified as an athlete,(33) 2) younger than 31 years of age at his/her
first evaluation in the Clinic, and 3) deceased before Mar 12 , 2020. A detailed flowchart is
presented in Figure 1. All participants read and signed an informed consent form authorizing
the use of their de-identified data for research purposes. Retrospective mortality studies with
the CLINIMEX cohort are officially registered and approved in the official Brazilian National

Research Registry – Plataforma Brasil number CAEE 40122320.8.0000.9433 and were
formally reviewed and approved by an external Research Ethics Committee – Centro de
Capacitação Física do Exército (reference number 4.459.555, December 13, 2020)

Censoring of vital status and mortality in the CLINIMEX cohort was updated to midDecember 2020 from the official registry data formally provided by the Rio de Janeiro State
Secretary of Health. This information was complemented, when appropriate, by additional
internet searches, CLINIMEX patient records and direct information obtained from assistant
physicians and patients’ relatives and close friends.
After having applied the exclusion criteria, there remained a total of 6,101 alive
participants – 4,004 men (65.6%) and 2,097 women (34.4%), aged 52.2 ± 12.7 years (mean
± standard deviation) at the time of their first evaluation. From these 6,101 participants, 97
(1.59%) died between March 12 and December 14 , 2020, the first 9-month period of the
COVID-19 pandemic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
th

th

Using ICD-10 coding data, the main cause of death in 35 participants was COVID-19,
and for the remaining 62 participants other non-COVID-19 causes. One of the non-COVID-19
deaths was excluded from the study due to a missing evaluation report file. Thus, the final
study sample consisted of 96 patients who died during the first 9-month period of the COVID19 pandemic in Brazil; these were divided into non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 deaths for
comparison. Additionally, the CLINIMEX cohort death registry was searched for number and
causes of death that occurred during the 18-month period preceding the pandemic (twice the
period of time covered by this study), i.e., between mid-September, 2018 and mid-March,
2020, aiming to obtain information about the typical CLINIMEX cohort mortality pattern prior
to the COVID-19 pandemic.

CLINIMEX Evaluation Protocol
In brief, the CLINIMEX evaluation protocol starts with a clinical history – with special
emphasis on physical activity and exercise/sport profile – followed by a physical
examination. In sequence, several anthropometric measurements are collected and a
standard 12-lead supine resting electrocardiogram is registered. As part of the evaluation
protocol, participants undergo various assessment evaluations, including handgrip strength,
maximal muscle power, Flexitest,(34) sitting-rising test and balance tests in order to assess
musculoskeletal physical fitness - muscle strength/power, flexibility and balance-.
Participants are then seated and properly fitted to a leg cycle ergometer (Inbramed CG-04
[Brazil] or Cateye EC-1600 [Japan]), and disposable electrodes are placed on their chest for

monitoring and continuously recording a one-lead electrocardiogram (Micromed Wincardio
[Brazil]). The evaluation continues with pulmonary function testing - lung spirometry –
(Schiller [Switzerland] or Koko [United States] spirometers) and a cardiac vagal tone
evaluation by the 4-second exercise test protocol. Finally, a maximal cycling cardiopulmonary
exercise testing (CPX) is undertaken following an individualized ramp protocol based on the
responses to the CLINIMEX Aerobic Questionnaire. The initial and increment in workload ratio
are selected by the evaluator based on the information collected on the history of physical
activity, exercise and sport in the most recent years. Participants expire through a
pneumotach (MedGraphics prevent [United States]) adapted to a mouthpiece and
measurements of air flow and expired gas fractions are carried out by a metabolic analyzer
(MedGraphics VO2000 [United States]). The spirometer and metabolic analyzer are
calibrated daily for flow and gas concentrations using a 3-L sealed syringe and standard gas
mixtures. All tests are performed in an exercise lab at sea level with properly controlled
temperature and relative humidity under the presence of qualified medical staff including at
least one Exercise & Sports Medicine physician and a nurse assistant. Personnel were
adequately trained and the exercise laboratory was equipped for handling medical
emergencies that could occur during the evaluation protocol, as recommended by the
Brazilian Society of Cardiology.(35)

Selected Variables for the Study
From all variables and data collected during this comprehensive Exercise Medicine
evaluation protocol, 51 variables were chosen for the comparison between the non-COVID-19
and COVID-19 death groups. A total of 12 variables collected either during the medical
history or CPX were classified in binary format; sex (men or women), clinical status (healthy
or unhealthy), and presence or absence (yes or no) of: coronary artery disease, myocardial
infarction, previous percutaneous coronary intervention, previous coronary artery bypass
grafting, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, regular use of ßblockers, and arrhythmias during maximal exercise testing.

Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics are presented as number of participants, mean, and standard
deviations for continuous variables and as frequency and percentage for nominal variables.
Statistical comparisons between the two groups were made by unpaired two-tailed t-test and
chi-square test, respectively, for continuous and nominal variables. A 5% level of probability
was set for statistical significance. Inferential testing results with probabilities between 5 and
10% were considered as borderline in terms of statistical significance. Prism software
version 8.4.3 (GraphPad, San Diego, US) was used for all statistical calculations.

Results
Considering the 9-month period of the study, 96 of the 6,101 participants died,
corresponding to 1.6% of the study’s sample. COVID-19 was the most frequent underlying
cause of death in our cohort representing 35 participants and 36.5% of all 96 identified
deaths or 0.57% of the total selected cohort participants for this study. In order to place this
information in context, 35 COVID-19 deaths represents a mortality ratio of 5,736/one million
or 1 death/174 cohort participants, corresponding to >20 times and >1.5 times, the world’s
average and Copacabana’s mortality ratio respectively, when compared here with data from
the end of 2020. Among the other specific causes of death, cardiovascular diseases,
neoplasia and respiratory diseases were, in sequence, the most common underlying causes
of death.
Considering the typical cohort historical profile of deaths as ascertained from the prepandemic 18-month period, there were clear differences. First, the absolute number of
deaths increased by 35% comparing the 9-month (obtained by dividing the 18-month total
value by 2) pre-pandemic and pandemic periods (71 versus 96 deaths). While no deaths
were previously reported from COVID-19, there were also differences in the profile of
underlying causes of deaths between the two periods of time considered. Since the fraction
of deaths due to cardiovascular and endocrine diseases were quite similar during the two
studied periods –28.2% and 4.2% (pre-pandemic) versus 29.2% and 3.1% (pandemic) -, the
percentage of participants dying from causes such as neoplasia, respiratory, digestive and
renal diseases, were clearly higher (2-3x) during the pre-pandemic period. Table 1 presents
detailed information about the underlying causes of death during the two periods of time
analyzed.

The first cohort COVID-19 death occurred on April 3 , 2020. The month-to-month
analysis indicated that non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 deaths peaked in May/2020 during the
9-month period of study, with 10 cases for each group. Indeed, from April 23 to May 22 ,
2020(a 30-day period), 14 participants died from COVID-19 as compared to 5 participants
dying from other causes. Two-thirds of COVID-19 deaths occurred in the months of April, May
and June/2020, that is, in only three of the 9 months of study observation. By carefully
looking at the non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 deaths on a monthly basis, it was possible to
determine that, indeed, the frequency of monthly deaths dramatically changed over the 9month period considered in the study (Figure 2).

The main results of descriptive and inferential statistics for all 51 variables in both
study groups are presented in tables 2 (binary variables) and 3 (continuous variables). Since
there were missing data for some variables, the exact number of subjects in both groups for
all variables is also shown. Sex distribution was similar between the groups of participants
with COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 deaths with women comprising 22% and 20% in each
group, respectively [p=.913]. This permitted us to combine participants of both sexes within
each group for subsequent analyses. Regarding clinical status, almost all – 92 (96%) – of the

participants that died during the 9-month period were classified as unhealthy according to
the results of their last evaluation carried out some years before their death, with no clear
distinction between the two groups [p=.269].
In terms of the remaining clinical data, table 2 shows that participants who died from
non-COVID-19 causes exhibited a worse profile for most of these variables with a significant
difference observed for history of previous percutaneous coronary intervention [p=.0423].
Presence of coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension, obesity and regular use of ßblockers, as well as history of myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass grafting were
1.5 to 1.9 times more common among participants that died from non-COVID-19 causes,
although these differences did not reach statistical significance [p values ranging from .1255
to .2247]. Nevertheless, nearly identical percentages were found for participants in both
groups for presence of dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus; 54% and 30% respectively. On the
other hand, borderline statistical significance was observed for the presence of any type of
arrhythmias during or immediately after CPX [p=.0939], with a slightly lower percentage
among non-COVID-19 as compared to COVID-19 participants, respectively, 74% versus 81%.

The main findings - mean, standard deviations and number of cases -, as well as
the corresponding statistical probability level found for the comparisons between the two
groups for the 39 continuous variables studied are presented in table 3 and further
described as follows. Age at last evaluation, age at death and time elapsed from
evaluation to death was remarkably similar between non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 groups
[p values ranging from .87 to .99]. Similarly, no differences were found for history of
physical activity, exercise and sport in childhood/adolescence or adult life and the prior
year of the evaluation [p values ranging from .43 to .78]. On the other hand, despite very
similar heights – mean difference of only 1.2 cm -, the participants dying from non-COVID
causes were 7 kg heavier [p=.0500], resulting in a 3 kg.m higher body mass index – 28.9
versus 26.9 [p=.04] and a 13% higher sum of the 4 skinfolds [p=.11] when compared to
those who died from COVID-19.

Concerning resting lung spirometry, participants from the two groups showed
mean results for 3 of 4 variables that were slightly lower than age- and sex-predicted, with
a significantly lower value for % predicted forced vital capacity in non-COVID-19 when
compared to the COVID-19 death group (85% versus 91%, respectively [p=.0439]). Results
of the 4-second exercise test were similarly lower than expected, corresponding to the 38
percentile when age-adjusted in the two groups [p=.58].

th

Data from 13 continuous variables derived from the CPX were analyzed involving
cardiovascular and respiratory variables. Similar mean values were found for seated preCPX heart rate [p=.41] and systolic blood pressure [p=.96] in the two groups, with a 5-mm
Hg lower mean seated pre-CPX diastolic blood pressure [p=.0344] for COVID-19 death
participants. Overall median CPX duration was 9 minutes, with most of the participant’s
CPX lasting between 8 and 12 minutes; CPX duration was almost identical between the
two groups [p=.90]. Hemodynamic exercise data – maximal systolic and diastolic blood
pressure, maximal heart rate and 1-min post-exercise heart rate were not different
between those dying from non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 causes [p values ranging from .50
to .86].
In analyzing CPX ventilatory data, there were absolute and relative to body weight
results. In general, the 96 participants that died showed poor aerobic fitness, with a mean
VO max of only 17 mL.kg .min [<5 METs] that corresponds to a mean of only 63.3% of
age- and sex-predicted VO max. There were no significant differences between nonCOVID-19 and COVID-19 death groups for any of the five aerobic-related variables studied
[p values ranging from .53 to .99].

Several test results were obtained from individual components or from overall
MUSK fitness. There were no statistical differences between non-COVID-19 and COVID-19
death groups for any of the 6 MUSK variables assessed [p values ranging from .26 to .81].
Generally, overall mean MUSK results were clearly lower than expected based on age- and
sex-predicted values – around the 20 percentile with the exception of the Flexindex(34,
42) (the sum of the scores obtained from 20 different joint movements in a single
participant) which was approximately the 30th percentile.

Discussion
This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to address the relationship
between physical fitness and exercise-related variables and COVID-19 deaths, by
retrospectively reviewing and combining data from a well-established exercise-oriented
epidemiological cohort and an official death certificate registry. We found that COVID-19
was the most frequent and premature cause of death in this convenience sample of
primarily white and middle-aged and elderly participants with chronic non-communicable
diseases in the CLINIMEX cohort (Rio de Janeiro – Brazil). Additionally, exercise/sport
history and aerobic and MUSK physical fitness testing data obtained some years earlier
were unable to distinguish between non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 deaths.
As currently documented in United States(2) (and perhaps in other countries as
well), COVID-19 was the leading cause of death during the first 9-months of Brazil’s
pandemic period in primarily chronically ill middle-aged or elderly men and women
belonging to the CLINIMEX cohort that have been evaluated along the 26 years of
existence of the Clinic.
Interestingly, the month-by-month analysis indicated that COVID-19 and nonCOVID-19 deaths peaked in May/2020 (a total of 20), a number not reached previously in
the entire cohort’s history during the 9-month period of observation. However, the death
profile substantially changed over these 9 months. While most of the COVID-19 deaths
occurred between April and June/2020, the non-COVID-19 deaths were more uniformly
distributed along the full period of observation. An exception occurred in May/2020 when
non-COVID deaths reached their peak; coincidently this was the peak of the first COVID-19
wave in the city of Rio de Janeiro and when the entire City’s public and private health
systems were overstressed and had nearly collapsed. Among several explanations, two of
them are highly likely: 1) Were some of these non-COVID-19 deaths in fact COVID-19related deaths that were misclassified in the death certificate? 2) Was the overcrowded
city’s health system unable to provide adequate services to patients who would not have
typically died and they either died at home or from insufficient access to expected and
needed medical services?
There are several possible reasons to explain why COVID-19 deaths were not
evenly distributed over the 9-month period. Perhaps the most important is the fact that
this profile somewhat reflects the total of COVID-19 deaths in Rio de Janeiro city and was
likely influenced by a combination of high transmission rates, very limited testing, poor
contact tracing strategies, poor adherence to physical distancing and mask use and
potentially ineffective medical therapeutic choices (e.g., hydroxycloroquine and

azythromicyn). All of these factors might have contributed to the proportionally higher
mortality ratio seen during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, in
contrast to most countries in the world, Rio de Janeiro city has not seen a period of strong
pandemic deceleration of COVID-19 infection or hospitalizations, and deaths have
continued to occur through this writing (mid-February/2021), as is partly reflected by our
updated data. Additionally, while our data suggest that some underlying causes of death
were proportionally less common during the pandemic, the small absolute number of
deaths for each specific cause surely precluded a more definitive analysis of this
information in our study. Future detailed epidemiological studies are recommended to
address and clarify these relevant questions.
Our study benefits from the fact that sex distribution, age at evaluation, age at
death and time elapsed between these two events were not significantly different
between those dying from non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 causes. Only 3 of the total 96
deaths – 2 non-COVID-19 and 1 COVID-19 - were younger than 60 years old. Due to the
rather restricted number of deaths, this study was not able to deeply analyze the
demographic and clinical profiles of participants that died from COVID-19, in contrast to
other much larger clinical and epidemiological studies.(46-52) Nevertheless, this study’s
participants who died during this 9-month pandemic period were generally elderly and
largely chronically ill. Data analysis identified only 4 dead participants who were classified
as healthy after their last evaluation. i.e., no relevant regular medications, no relevant
clinical diseases diagnosed and normal results on the evaluation protocol – 1 (2%) in nonCOVID-19 vs 3 (8%) in COVID-19 groups [p=.518] -.
Coronary artery disease, arterial hypertension and regular use of ß-blockers were
present in 52 to 54 (54-56%) of the 96 participants with non-COVID and COVID-19 deaths;
more than half of the participants with coronary artery disease also had a previous
diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Additionally, dyslipidemia (54%) and diabetes mellitus
(32%) were also very common among the participants. On the other hand, it should be
noted that the prevalence of obesity, as defined by a body mass index > 30 kg.m , was
relatively low. According to body mass index, 25% of all participants had normal
weight/height relationship and only 7 (20%) of those that died from COVID-19 were
classified as obese. Moreover, only one participant dying from atherosclerotic heart
disease had a body mass index indicating morbid obesity. There are recent data from the
UK Biobank(51) suggesting that among those older than 70 years, body mass index
tended to be a weaker predictor of the COVID-19 clinical course. Notwithstanding,
considering the relatively small sample size of our study, affirmative conclusions could not
be made from regarding this matter.

It was not unexpected that resting lung spirometry and cardiac vagal tone were
below the age- and sex-predicted reference values, since most participants had chronic
non-communicable diseases. It is interesting to note further that despite the fact that
most of the participants had a diagnosis of arterial hypertension, the average value for
seated pre-CPX and maximal systolic and diastolic blood pressure were in an acceptable
range, suggesting that these participants were, in fact, medically well-controlled in terms
of arterial hypertension. Most likely due to the fact that the regular use of ß-blockers was
highly prevalent among the participants, the mean overall maximal heart rate was only
about 78% of the age-predicted value,(53) though it did not differ between the two groups.
Aerobic (cardiorespiratory) fitness variables were objectively measured in 94% of
all participants by expired gas analysis during a maximal cycling CPX using an
individualized ramp protocol, with an optimal duration having been obtained in the
majority of the participants. No statistical differences in cardiorespiratory fitness were
observed between groups. The mean overall aerobic fitness as reflected by VO max was
much lower than age- and sex-predicted values, clearly indicating that the vast majority of
participants were aerobically unfit. The cardiorespiratory optimal point was higher than
age- and sex-predicted for the majority of the participants and, as defined in a previous
epidemiological study, 11%, 53% and 36% of the participants were, respectively,
classified as good, average and poor for the cardiorespiratory optimal point when
considering previously defined cut-off values for all-cause mortality. While we were unable
to find in our literature search papers directly relating aerobic fitness to COVID-19
mortality, some but not all available studies support the idea that high levels of aerobic
fitness or physical activity could prevent hospitalizations due to COVID-19.(18, 47, 54, 55).
Therefore, some uncertainty remains as recently stated by Zbinden-Foncea et al.(17):
“whether a high level of cardiorespiratory fitness can reduce the early amplified
proinflammatory responses in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and confer some
protective effect against the development and severity of the disease remains to be
established from retrospective epidemiological data”.

MUSK fitness variables were assessed by four specific tests that were applied
according to well-defined protocols by properly trained personnel. Similar to the aerobicderived CPX variables, no statistical differences were found between non-COVID-19 and
COVID-19 death groups. Nevertheless, it should be noted that by using age and sexreference values for the four tests, it was clear that MUSK fitness was lower than expected
in all four tests, expressed in both absolute and relative to body weight (when applicable)
for the vast majority of the participants in the non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 death groups.

Considering our previous studies, it is worth adding a comment regarding two
other CPX variables – exercise heart rate gradient (56) and maximal oxygen pulse,(57, 58)
both previously shown to be associated with all-cause mortality and in principle could
have been predictors of mortality in the current study. However, a more recent study has
shown that the exercise heart rate gradient was not useful to predict mortality in patients
using ß-blockers (59), as was the case for 56% of our participants, and its use was
discarded for this study. Regarding maximal absolute or relative oxygen pulse, since VO
max and maximal heart rate were closely similar in both groups, it was thought that the
inclusion of oxygen pulse as a study variable would not be meaningful.

Looking at the individual profile of each participant that has died could be very
informative (readers may contact the corresponding author for access to those detailed
data). For example, the youngest participant that died was one of the very few that had an
undetermined cause of death (R99 code in ICD-10) occurring at 51 years of age.
Interestingly, in his last evaluation (the fourth in CLINIMEX) carried out ten years before
the death, he presented with arterial hypertension and dyslipidemia and had the best nonage adjusted aerobic indicators - highest VO max (37.9 mL.kg .min ) and lowest
cardiorespiratory optimal point (19.1) - among all 96 participants that died.

In summary, participants of the CLINIMEX cohort that died during this 9-month
pandemic period were primarily elderly and largely chronically ill and unfit. In retrospect,
our data suggest that the occurrence of death of any cause seems to be a relatively rare
event in a given 9-month period among our healthy middle-aged and elderly cohort
participants. In a future study, it would be likely relevant to analyze the aerobic and MUSK
fitness levels among elderly CLINIMEX cohort survivors from the pandemic of COVID-19.

Limitations
This study has several relevant limitations: 1) The study has a retrospective design
and there was a large range in the interval of time between the evaluations and the
outcomes, i.e., death, as previously mentioned. While recent clinical data was available for
some unhealthy and healthy participants that died, as in those that were attending onsite
or remote exercise programs shortly before death, regarding many others, no recent
information was available for the current study. However, this situation is similar for both
COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 deaths in terms of the number of days elapsed between last
evaluation and fatal outcomes (see table 2); 2) For this study, we relied on the
information made available on the death certificates and no formal attempt was made to
check their accuracy; 3) while this paper is being written (mid-February), the pandemic
continues strong and Brazil is reaching new tragic records of 7-day rolling average of

COVID-19 deaths/day; thus, we do not know if the findings herein would differ if a longer
period of observation is considered; 4) A theoretical and logical possibility was that the
participants dying from COVID-19 were more exposed and less “prudent” in regard to the
virus infection. Unfortunately, there is no available information about how adherent the
participants were to recommended sanitary precautions; however, as far as we could find
out from information obtained from spouses, relatives and friends of the participants, the
vast majority of them adopted a high level of self-protection and this did not seem to vary
among participants in the two groups;. 5) While we have been aware of several cases of
COVID-19 infection among participants in our cohort, unfortunately, we were unable to
obtain reliable data regarding the actual number or percentage of them that got infected
or were hospitalized or needed mechanical ventilation due to COVID-19. As such, we were
unable to analyze the association between our selected variables and these rather minor
or intermediate but clinically relevant health outcomes in our cohort as other studies have
done.(18, 19) 6) In relation to the analysis of conventional cardiovascular risk factors, it is
worthwhile mentioning the reason why smoking was not considered in the study. In
contrast to several other countries in the world, the prevalence of smoking status is
currently very low in the Brazilian adult population, and in particular among the elderly
CLINIMEX cohort. At baseline, only 1 to 2% of all participants were current smokers,
although the majority of them reported to have smoked in the past. Therefore, smoking
habit was not considered to be relevant for this study.

Positive aspects
This study also has several positive aspects or features that should be
underscored. 1) Only six experienced Exercise & Sport physicians were involved in all
evaluations over the 26 years of data collection, warranting the same protocol and quality
to the data obtained for all testing and measurements; 2) All maximal leg cycling exercise
tests were conducted in a single exercise lab following individualized ramp protocols and
expired gas was collected and analyzed in metabolic units from the same manufacturer;
3) None of our physicians were involved in the care of COVID-19 for the participants in the
cohort or in signing their death certificates, which were independently and officially
obtained from the State Secretary of Health; 4) The use of data originating from
participants from the same cohort for comparisons – non-COVID-19 versus COVID-19
deaths – provided a unique opportunity to address these issues, particularly given the fact
that both groups were similar in terms of sex distribution, age at evaluation and at death
and percentage of those regularly using ß-blockers.

Conclusions
COVID-19 was the most frequent and premature cause of death in a convenience
sample of primarily white and middle-aged and elderly participants with chronic noncommunicable diseases in the CLINIMEX cohort (located in Copacabana – Rio de Janeiro
– Brazil). Our data suggest that exercise/sport history and aerobic and MUSK physical
fitness testing data obtained some years earlier were unable to distinguish between nonCOVID-19 and COVID-19 deaths. However, CLINIMEX cohort participants who died due to
non-COVID-19 related causes during the first 9-month period (mid-March to midDecember/2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic were more severely affected by noncommunicable diseases or cardiovascular risk factors than those who became victims of
COVID-19. Therefore, the presence of cardiovascular risk factors like obesity was
associated with an increased number of deaths in the non-COVID-19 but not COVID-19
groups.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN
•
•

•

COVID-19 has caused thousands of deaths worldwide and Brazil has been one of
the most affected countries.
COVID-19 deaths are unevenly distributed within countries, regions and cities. As
of mid-February/2021, the Copacabana area in the city of Rio de Janeiro has been
heavily hit by COVID-19, with a tragic figure of 1 death per 266 inhabitants.
CLINIMEX, a privately-owned Exercise Medicine Clinic situated in Copacabana,
started an open cohort in 1994 that currently has over 9,000 participants and a
large amount of accumulated data – including history of exercise and aerobic and
musculoskeletal fitness; this cohort has undergone periodic updates of their vital
status and mortality information.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
•
•

COVID-19 is the most frequent cause of death in a population of primarily white,
elderly and unfit men and women with various non-communicable diseases
In comparing clinical, exercise, aerobic and musculoskeletal fitness data obtained
from middle-aged and elderly participants from a Rio de Janeiro cohort that died
in the first 9-month period of COVID-19 pandemic, those who died from COVID-19
tended to be somewhat healthier than those dying from other causes. However, no
differences were identified in sex distribution, history of exercise/sports and
several indicators of aerobic and musculoskeletal fitness

FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS
•

•

To assess whether or not objectively measured aerobic and musculoskeletal
physical fitness is associated with COVID-19 deaths in both healthy and unhealthy
young and middle-aged men and women adults
To verify whether recent levels of physical activity and/or exercise and/or sport are
able to predict the clinical course of COVID-19 once infection occurs
