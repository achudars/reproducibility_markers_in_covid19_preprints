ABSTRACT
Background
As COVID-19 continues to spread around the world, understanding how patterns of human
mobility and connectivity affect outbreak dynamics, especially before outbreaks establish
locally, is critical for informing response efforts. In Taiwan, most cases to date were imported or
linked to imported cases.
Methods
In collaboration with Facebook Data for Good, we characterized changes in movement patterns
in Taiwan since February 2020, and built metapopulation models that incorporate human
movement data to identify the high risk areas of disease spread and assess the potential effects of
local travel restrictions in Taiwan.
Results
We found that mobility changed with the number of local cases in Taiwan in the past few
months. For each city, we identified the most highly connected areas that may serve as sources of
importation during an outbreak. We showed that the risk of an outbreak in Taiwan is enhanced if
initial infections occur around holidays. Intracity travel reductions have a higher impact on the
risk of an outbreak than intercity travel reductions, while intercity travel reductions can narrow
the scope of the outbreak and help target resources. The timing, duration, and level of travel
reduction together determine the impact of travel reductions on the number of infections, and
multiple combinations of these can result in similar impact.
Conclusions
To prepare for the potential spread within Taiwan, we utilized Facebook’s aggregated and
anonymized movement and colocation data to identify cities with higher risk of infection and
regional importation. We developed an interactive application that allows users to vary inputs
and assumptions and shows the spatial spread of the disease and the impact of intercity and
intracity travel reduction under different initial conditions. Our results can be used readily if
local transmission occurs in Taiwan after relaxation of border control, providing important
insights into future disease surveillance and policies for travel restrictions.

BACKGROUND
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China in December
2019 and has since caused a global pandemic, with over 15,000,000 confirmed cases and over
600,000 deaths reported by July 23, 2020.1 Scientific discoveries have advanced at an
unprecedented pace, with numerous clinical trials of drugs and vaccines underway.2,3 In the
meantime, public health officials must rely on other interventions, such as social distancing and
travel restrictions, to slow the spread and reduce the peak of the outbreak, in order to prevent
health systems from being overwhelmed.4,5
In January 2020, as the epidemic in Wuhan grew, many countries implemented travel bans, and
airlines canceled flights to attempt to slow the spread.6 A number of studies have estimated the
risk of importation globally, with some suggesting up to two-thirds of all imported cases went
undetected.7,8 For Taiwan, there have been 411 reported cases as of June 30, 2020 9, with 356
imported (87%) and 55 local cases (13%). 52 local cases (94.5 %) were linked to imported or
known cases, and 3 local cases (5.5 %) have unknown origin. Since February 7th, Taiwan has
implemented entry restrictions on foreign nationals based on their travel histories; 14-day home
quarantine started being required for visitors from certain locations from February 10th and
became required for all travelers from March 19th.10 While COVID-19 transmission in Taiwan is
relatively well-controlled, the number of cases globally is still increasing.1 When border control
is relaxed in Taiwan in the future, importation from other countries has the potential to lead to
local outbreaks, especially if other non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as hand washing or
mask wearing, are not adopted at the same level as in March and April 2020.
As the number of cases globally due to community transmission grows relative to the number of
imported cases, attention has turned to more local measures to decrease spread, such as
cancellations of mass gatherings, business closures, and local travel restrictions.11 Mobility data
can provide critical information for responding to outbreaks and understanding the impact of
travel restrictions.12 Recent studies have analyzed the effects of human mobility and travel
restrictions on disease spread during the COVID-19 pandemic.6,13–16 Here, to prepare for
COVID-19 and its impact, in collaboration with Facebook Data for Good, we describe the
metapopulation models we’ve built that include human movement data to better understand the
high risk areas of disease spread and assess the potential impact of local travel restrictions in
Taiwan.
METHODS
Movement data and geographic unit
We incorporated two different sources of mobility data from Facebook into our models:
Facebook colocation data and Facebook movement data. Facebook’s newly developed
colocation matrices (Facebook colocation data) give the probability that people from two
different geographic units will be in the same 600 m × 600 m location for five minutes using data
over the course of a week. Facebook’s regular movement data (Facebook movement data)
aggregates the number of trips Facebook users make between locations every eight hours (Figure
S1).17 Mobility data between January 26th and June 30th were used. Facebook movement data

were disaggregated by weekdays (Monday to Friday), weekends, and holidays (Lunar New Year,
Ching Ming festival, and Dragon Boat Festival). Facebook colocation data included weeks
containing holidays and weeks containing only regular (i.e. non-holiday) days.
The geographic unit used in this study was at the centrally-governed level of “city” (here “city”
indicates city, county or special municipality in Taiwan). Shape files were downloaded from
Government open data platform (https://data.gov.tw/dataset/7442). We excluded three cities
outside of the main island of Taiwan from the analysis due to their low connectivity with the
main island, leaving 19 cities.
Metapopulation Models
We developed susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered (SLIR) models of the spread of COVID19 throughout Taiwan. We ran the models stochastically to understand the initial stages of
disease spread. We ran the model until either (1) it reached n cumulative infections or (2) the
total number of infections became 0 to estimate the probability of having more than n infections
(denoted by Pn,k, where k represents the number of initial infections), the time it takes to reach n
infections (denoted by Tn,k), and the standard deviation of infection numbers at Tn,k (denoted by
Vn,k). To assess the initial stages of the outbreak, we used n=1000 and k=3 as our baseline values.
Let Si, Li, Ii, Ri be the number of susceptible, latent, infectious, and recovered individuals in
location i, respectively, and Ni be the total population in location i. Let DL (=3.5) be the latent
period, and DI (=3) be the duration of infectiousness.13 Because transmission rates can change
with non-pharmaceutical interventions, as shown in previous studies, we vary
R0 in our model (R0 =2.4, 1.2, or 0.9).13,18,19
We modified spatial models from previous studies20–23 and constructed two metapopulation
models, a contact model and a residence model, with the former using Facebook colocation data
and the latter using Facebook movement data. In the “contact model”, we assumed that contact
rates (and therefore transmission rates) varied among locations and was proportional to
colocation probabilities (Cij, the probability that a person from location i collocates with a person
from location j) from Facebook colocation data. We scaled R0 by Cij*Nj (for j not equal to i) or
Cii*(Ni-1), standardized to Cii*(Ni-1) in Taipei.

In the “residence model”, we first estimated the proportion of time people living in location i
spend in location j (Pij) based on Facebook movement data (see details in Supplementary
Methods), and modeled the transmission dynamics by considering both that (1) non-travelers get
infected by infectious visitors to their home location (the first part in the following equation) and
that (2) naïve travelers get infected when they travel (the second part in the following equation).

In addition to using different movement data, the major difference between two models is that
the transmission rate within each city (R0/DI) varies with colocation matrices in the contact
model, while it remains constant in the residence model. In this sense, the contact model is
similar to the traditional density dependent model, where contact rates (and therefore
transmission rates) vary with population density, and the residence model is similar to the
frequency dependent model.24 As it is unclear which is most appropriate for COVID-19, we used
both and compared the results.
Risk of infection and regional importation
We defined three connectivity measures relevant for disease transmission, risk of infection, risk
of regional importation, and source of importation. Using Facebook colocation data, we defined
R0ii as intracity R0 and ∑"1! 𝑅#!" as intercity R0 for location i. The sum of intracity R0 and
intercity R0 reflects total risk of infection and was standardized to the highest value.

Modeling travel reduction
To assess the potential effect of travel restrictions at multiple levels, we modeled either intra-city
travel reductions, inter-city travel reductions, or a combination of both travel reductions (“overall
reduction” in texts and figures) for 1, 2, 3, or 6 months or for the whole period of time. Travel
reductions started from the beginning of the simulations or when there were 10, 20, 30, 50, or
100 accumulated infections. The proportion of reduction is denoted by G. In the contact model,
intracity reduction was modeled by R0ii*(1–G) for all i, and intercity reduction was modeled by
R0ij*(1–G) for all i not equal to j. In the residence model, intracity reduction was modeled by
R0*(1–G) and intercity reduction was modeled by Pij*(1–G) for all i not equal to j and Pii +(1–
Pii)*G for all i.
RESULTS
Varying human mobility across space and time in Taiwan
We quantified how intercity and intracity mobility varied at the centrally-governed level in the
past five months using Facebook mobility data. On average, intracity movement was 7-fold of
intercity movement, and intracity colocation probability was over 200-fold of intercity colocation
probability. We quantified the difference in connectivity between locations by three measures:
risk of infection, risk of regional importation, and source of importation (Figure 1 and Table S1).
Risk of infection identifies locations with larger colocation probabilities. If assuming contact
rates were proportional to colocation probabilities, disease transmission rates are expected to be
higher in locations with higher risk of infection, such as Taipei City, New Taipei City, and
Kaohsiung City. Risk of regional importation represents the relative number of travelers and
local people, and higher values indicate higher possibility that travelers will transmit virus to
local people. Source of importation calculates how much travelers from each location contribute
to other locations. Viruses are expected to spread more quickly if initial local infections in
Taiwan occur in locations with higher values of source of infection. Taipei and New Taipei City
are cities with the highest risk of regional importation and source of importation, respectively.
These three measures quantify different but related aspects of mobility and connectivity that are
relevant for disease transmission, and while well-connected cities tend to have high values for all
three measures, there are still some differences among them.
We found intercity mobility between some of the locations first decreased and then increased in
the past few months, which is consistent with the changes in the number of local cases in Taiwan
and global number of cases (Figure S2 and Figure S3), indicating the level of change that can
happen without travel restrictions imposed by the government. We also observed significant
changes during holidays. Lunar New Year was within the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2
outbreak, and for most of cities pairs (95%), colocation probabilities during Lunar New Year was
significantly higher than regular days, as expected during holidays. However, the proportion of
city pairs with higher than usual intercity connectivity during the Ching Ming Festival, which
occurred at the time when the number of cases was increasing dramatically globally and the
number of local cases was just starting to decrease, decreased to 67%. Dragon Boat Festival was
at the time the number of local cases remained zero for more than a month, and the proportion of
city pairs with higher than usual intercity mobility increased to 76%.

The impact of the location of initial infections on the risk of the spread
At the end of June 2020, most cases in Taiwan were imported or linked to imported cases.
Therefore, we used meta-population models parameterized by human mobility data from
Facebook to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 under a variety of initial conditions, including
both the number of initial infections and their locations. We developed a web-based interface
(https://roachchang.shinyapps.io/TW_CoV_Dynamics/) to show the geographic distribution of
infections given different initial conditions, which can be readily used to inform targeted
surveillance and control if SARS-CoV-2 starts spreading locally in Taiwan. Because other
disease-relevant hygiene behaviors, such as hand washing, mask wearing, or social distancing,
may also have changed due to the awareness of COVID-19, we explored different transmission
rates (R0 =2.4, 1.2, or 0.9).
We considered different aspects of disease spread – the probability of outbreak, the speed of
spread, and the geographic range of outbreak. We estimated the probability of having more than
1000 infections (denoted by P1000,k, where k represents the number of initial infections) using
stochastic simulations and used this to represent the probability of an outbreak. As expected, we
found that, if we assumed that the transmission rates varied among cities (contact model), the
probability of having more than 1000 infections also varied with the locations of initial
infections, with the cities with larger risk of infection showing larger P1000 (Figure S4A and
Table S2). In simulations where 1000 infections were reached, the time it took to reach 1000
infections (denoted by T1000,k) was also shorter for cities with larger risk of infection (Figure
S4B). When assuming that the transmission rates in different cities were the same (residence
model), the probability of having more than 1000 infections and the time to reach 1000
infections did not vary much with the locations of initial infections (Figure S5 and Table S3).
The effect of intercity connectivity, however, was reflected in the variation in infection numbers
across cities at T1000 (denoted by V1000). The variation in infection numbers was lower in cities
with higher values of source of importation (Figure S4C) as the chance of spreading the virus to
other cities was higher. In both models, well connected cities played more important roles, as
they spread the virus to other cities more quickly and more widely.
The impact of varying mobility on the risk of spread
Above results were based on mobility data on regular days. Given that human mobility varied
significantly in the past few months without travel restrictions imposed by the government, we
further quantified the impact of varying mobility in Taiwan on the risk of spreading SARS-CoV2. The impact was mainly reflected in the geographic range of infections in both models. When
initial infections occurred in or around Lunar New Year, the speed of disease spread was
enhanced (Figure 2). Because mobility during Ching Ming Festival and Dragon Boat Festival
differed less from regular days and these two holidays only lasted four days, it only led to minor
differences in the geographic range of infections (Figure 2). In the contact model, the probability
of local outbreak was higher if initial infections occurred in or around Lunar New Year, and this
impact was more apparent when initial infections were in locations with lower risk of infection
(Figure S6).
The effect of travel restrictions

We examined the impact of varying mobility that occurred naturally during holidays on the
disease spread above. Here we explored the level to which travel restrictions imposed by the
government could potentially reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Taiwan at the initial stage of
an outbreak. In both the contact model and the residence model, decreasing intracity movement
had a much larger impact on P1000,3 (Figure 3) and T1000,3 (Figure S7) than decreasing intercity
movement. The impact of reducing intercity travel was most evident in influencing how
widespread the virus was: the infections were located in only a few cities at T1000,3 if intercity
travel was reduced (Figure S8).
We then investigated the impact of duration and timing of travel reductions (Figure 4, and details
at https://roachchang.shinyapps.io/TW_CoV_Dynamics/). The probability of local outbreak
decreased with increased duration of intracity travel reduction, but not change with the duration
of intercity travel reduction. The results suggest that higher levels of reduction and longer
periods of reduction for intracity travel can have similar impacts. For example, a 60% intracity
travel reduction for 20 days had similar outcomes as a 70% reduction for 10 days. While P1000,3
did not change with the length of intercity travel reduction, longer intercity travel reduction led
to slower progression of the outbreak (higher T1000,3) in the contact model and more clustered
infections (higher V1000,3) in both models (Figure S9). Furthermore, among the parameters we
used, it was the best to reduce travel as early as possible to reduce the risk of outbreak (Figure
S10).
DISCUSSION
By utilizing aggregated human mobility data from Facebook, we characterized how mobility
patterns in Taiwan changed since the emergence of COVID-19, and built metapopulation models
to understand the potential spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Taiwan and assess the potential impact of
travel restrictions. We identified the top cities with the highest risk of infection as well as the top
cities with the highest importation risk from other cities based on Facebook data and population
sizes. We made a web-based interface showing the geographic distribution of infections at
different time points (T100, T500 and T1000) in the initial stages of the outbreak given different
locations of initial infections. We demonstrate that these modeling results based on empirical
mobility data can be obtained before an outbreak occurs, and can be readily used to help the
public avoid high-risk areas, help public health professionals identify surveillance targets, and
inform decisions on travel restrictions, providing one of the key elements for COVID-19
preparedness.
Consistent with previous findings showing that international or domestic travel bans are less
effective than social distancing,6,25 we found that intracity travel reduction has a higher impact
on disease dynamics than intercity travel reduction and increasing the length of intracity travel
reduction increases the impact. Intercity travel reduction, however, influences the variation in
infection numbers across cities and can reduce the number of cities that have infections at the
initial stage of the outbreak. While intercity travel did not decrease the probability of outbreak,
containing the infections to a few cities has important public health impacts, as this means
surveillance system can focus on fewer cities and control efforts can be more targeted.
Practically, intercity reduction might be easier to implement than intracity reduction.

Intracity travel reduction in our model is effectively the same as any measure that can reduce
contact rates between individuals, such as social distancing, or transmission probability given
contact, such as hand washing or wearing facemasks. These measures have been shown to be
effective in reducing the transmission of respiratory viral pathogens in both modeling and
empirical studies,26–30 and should be encouraged. It has been shown that contact rates can be
reduced by more than 70% during a lockdown.31
Our study found that similar probabilities of outbreak can occur with various combinations of
length, level, and timing of travel reductions. Health officials can therefore take into
consideration feasibility of different interventions, impact on society, and the capacity of the
healthcare system to determine the optimal interventions and their duration.5 Because the volume
of travel in and around holidays can increase the speed of virus spread, our results suggest that it
is important to avoid travel or reduce the impact of travel through measures such as limiting
social interactions and wearing facemasks when taking public transportation to reduce the spread
of the virus.
We showed that Facebook mobility data can be used to track how the volume and pattern of
travel change through time as the outbreak progresses, and we can incorporate any change in
human mobility into the metapopulation models in nearly real time to help fight COVID-19.12,32
Moreover, our model utilizing human mobility data from Facebook is not limited to intercity or
intracity level, or Taiwan. Facebook mobility data are also calculated at finer geographic scales
(such as towns) and for other countries, and our model can be easily applied in these settings to
understand disease dynamics of COVID-19.
CONCLUSIONS
In Taiwan, most cases to date were imported or linked to imported cases. To prepare for the
potential spread within Taiwan, we utilized Facebook’s aggregated and anonymized movement
and colocation data to identify cities with higher risk of infection and regional importation. We
showed that both intracity and intercity movement affect outbreak dynamics, with the former
having more of an impact on the total numbers of cases and the latter impacting geographic
scope. The timing, duration, and level of travel reduction together determine the impact of travel
reductions on the number of infections, and multiple combinations of these can result in similar
impact. These findings have important implications for guiding future policies for travel
restrictions during outbreaks in Taiwan.

Estimating Pij
We built a travel model to estimate the proportion of time people living in location i spend in
location j (Pij) by fitting the model to the Facebook movement data. Xij represents the proportion
867 represents the equilibrium state of
of people living in location i currently in location j, and 𝑋
Xij, and its value under the fitted model is used as our estimate of Pij. People living in location i
travel with probability Fi, and the probability that a traveler from location i travels to location j is
denoted by Tij. Travelers go back to their home location at probability 𝜆! per unit of time. Mij,t,t+1
represents the number of people moving from location i to location j between time t and t+1.
𝑋!" (𝑡 + 1) = 𝑋!" (𝑡) + 𝑋!! (𝑡)𝐹! 𝑇!" − 𝑋!" (𝑡)𝜆!

For simplicity, we assumed that the majority of travel is work-related travel and on average
travelers spend eight hours in the travel destination (𝜆! =1 given the unit of time is 8 hours) and
that Tij is proportional to Mij, leaving Fi the only parameters to be fitted. We used a gradient
descent algorithm to find the local optimum solution for Fi, where the cost function is defined by
the sum of the squared difference between normalized mij and the normalized value of Mij from
the model. We calculated 𝑋867 under fitted parameters to obtain estimates of Pij.

Figure S4. Disease spread was associated with measures of connectivity. In the contact
model, (A) the probability of having more than 1000 infections (P1000) increased with risk of
infection (Spearman's correlation test, rho= 0.95, p-value=5´10-10), and (B) the time it took to
reach 1000 infections (T1000) decreased with risk of infection (Spearman's correlation test, rho= 0.46, p-value=0.05). (C) In the residence model, the variation in infection numbers across cities
at T1000 (denoted by V1000) decreased with values of source of importation (Spearman's
correlation test, rho= -0.64, p-value=0.004). R0=2.4.

Figure S7. The impact of travel reduction on time to reach 1000 accumulated infections. If
initial infections were in a big city, it took less time to reach 1000 infections in the contact
model. The difference between big and small cities was not significant in the residence model.
Intracity and overall travel reduction delayed the time to reach 1000 infections in both models,
while intercity reduction did not. For some conditions, P1000,3 was 0 and no bar was shown. Here
travel reduction was applied during the whole time and R0=2.4.

reduction started from the beginning of the simulations (denoted by 0), or when there were 10,
20, 30, 50, and 100 infections in both contact (left) and residence (right) models. Two different
lengths of travel reduction duration were shown: (A) 10 days (B) 1 month. Only intracity travel
reduction was shown here because intercity travel reduction only had minimal impact on P1000,3
and the results from overall reduction and intracity reduction were qualitatively similar. It was
best to reduce travel at the beginning if the duration was for 10 days or 1 month. Here initial
