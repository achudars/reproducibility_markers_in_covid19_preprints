Abstract
Objectives
To develop and validate patient-reported instruments, based on patients' lived experiences, for
monitoring the symptoms and impact of long covid.
Design
The long covid Symptom and Impact Tools (ST and IT) were constructed from the answers to
a survey with open-ended questions to 492 patients with long covid. Validation of the tools
involved adult patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19 and symptoms extending over
three weeks after onset. Construct validity was assessed by examining the relations of the ST
and IT scores with health related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), function (PCFS, post-covid
functional scale), and perceived health (MYMOP2). Reliability was determined by a testretest. The "patient acceptable symptomatic state" (PASS) was determined by the percentile
method.
Results
Validation involved 1022 participants (55% with confirmed covid-19, 79% female and 12.5%
hospitalised for covid-19). The long covid ST and IT scores were strongly correlated with the
EQ-5D-5L (rs = -0.45 and rs = -0.59 respectively), the PCFS (rs = -0.39 and rs = -0.55), and
the MYMOP2 (rs = -0.40 and rs = -0.59). Reproducibility was excellent with an interclass
correlation coefficient of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.86) for the ST score and
0.84 (0.80 to 0.87) for the IT score. In total, 793 (77.5%) patients reported an unacceptable
symptomatic state, thereby setting the PASS for the long covid IT score at 30 (28 to 33).
Conclusions
The long covid ST and IT tools, constructed from patients’ lived experiences, provide the first
validated and reliable instruments for monitoring the symptoms and impact of long covid.

Introduction
As of February 2021, about 100 million people worldwide have been infected by the SARSCoV 2 virus.1 According to some studies, from 10% to 70% of them, including many who
only had a mild disease, report the presence of symptoms such as fatigue, dyspnoea, chest
pain, memory problems, and concentration disorders persisting beyond three weeks from the
initial onset of symptoms.2-8 Yet, so far, surveillance systems around the world remain
focused exclusively on the acute aspect of the pandemic, tracking new cases, hospitalisations,
and deaths, while neglecting these long-term consequences of covid-19.9
Persisting signs and symptoms three weeks after the acute covid-19 infection may be
associated with several distinct clinical entities: 1) organ injury from the acute disease or its
treatment (e.g., lung scarring, complications of intensive care, etc.),8 10-12 2) post-viral fatigue
syndrome,13-15 3) prolonged viral shedding, especially in immunosuppressed patients,16 4)
reinfection, and 5) mental factors, such as post-traumatic stress. From the patient's
perspective, all or several of these causes are often intertwined and produce a substantial
burden of disease. As a result, patients themselves created the term “long covid” to describe
all of the symptoms they could experience, independently of their specific cause.17
Today, advances in understanding and treating long covid are impeded by the heterogeneity
of its assessment: each study uses different sets of symptoms, most generally defined from the
care givers’ perspective.3

18 19

There is currently no comprehensive, validated, and reliable

instrument for monitoring either the course of long covid symptoms or its impact on patients’
lives—an absence that incurs the risk of missing important patient perspectives. For example,
many patients with long covid report an inability to sleep, difficulties concentrating, or
exhaustion after mild exercise—manifestations not considered in all existing studies.20 The
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recently called for the development
and validation of scales to assess long covid,21 and in February 2021, the World Health
Organization issued a standardised, albeit non-validated, case report form for the follow-up of
patients after acute covid-19.22
In this study, we aimed to develop and validate a set of patient reported instruments for
monitoring the symptoms and impact of long covid, usable in clinical practice and constructed
from patients’ lived experience.

Methods
The development and validation of these instruments applied a two-stage method.23 The study
was

nested

within

ComPaRe

(Communauté

de

Patients

pour

la

Recherche,

www.compare.aphp.fr), an e-cohort of patients with chronic conditions who volunteer to
participate in research by regularly answering patient reported outcome measures (PROMs)
and patient reported experience measures (PREMs).24 Because of the similarities between
long covid and chronic conditions, recruitment in ComPaRe was extended to patients
reporting symptoms of covid-19 lasting more than three weeks past initial onset. All
participants provide electronic consent before participating. The Institutional Review Board of
Hôtel-Dieu Hospital, Paris, approved ComPaRe (IRB: 0008367).

Stage 1: Development of a set of patient reported instruments to
monitor the symptoms and impact of long covid from the patients’
lived experiences
We sought to develop the contents of the instruments from the patients' lived experiences of
long covid. We invited adult patients in the ComPaRe cohort who reported a covid-19
infection (laboratory confirmed or not) with symptoms persisting more than three weeks past
the initial infection to complete an online survey of open-ended questions that asked them to
describe in detail the symptoms, potential triggers, and the effects of long covid on their lives.
The survey, which took place from October 14 to November 29, 2020, used broad questions
to avoid directing patients about long covid's consequences (Supplementary material 1).
Participants were recruited through a social media and media campaign and by partner patient
associations. Participants who had participated were invited to encourage people in their
entourage who may have had a COVID-19 infection, to participate, by a ‘snowball’ sampling
method 25.
Two investigators (VTT and CR) used an inductive multiple-round qualitative content
analysis to examine the participants' responses. First, they independently coded the responses
(i.e., they identified within each response any expression found in the text expressing a
symptom or impact of long covid and assigned it a code). Answers related to the acute phase
of covid-19 (that is, symptoms during the first three weeks of infection) were removed from
analysis. For example, when a participant stated that “I had a cough and fever for one week

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.18.21253903; this version posted March 20, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

and joint pain for 7 months”, we considered only “joint pain” to be a potential long covid
symptom. If the response did not specify a timeframe, all reported symptoms were kept in the
analysis. Next, the investigators grouped the identified codes into a standardised set of
symptoms and consequences of long covid, based on their medical knowledge and the
literature.4 18 Analysis continued on until a comprehensive list of symptoms was obtained, i.e.,
until data saturation was reached. The point of data saturation was assessed with a
mathematical model to predict the number of new symptoms that could be identified by
adding new participants to the study.26 In a third step, they reduced the number of symptoms
by: 1) grouping closely related symptoms (eg, loss of taste and changes in taste were grouped
as loss/change of taste) and 2) eliminating those expressed by less than 2% of participants in
the open-ended survey.
The two investigators used the results of the open-ended survey to develop a preliminary
patient reported instrument for monitoring long covid's current symptoms and impact. We
chose to split the instrument into two independent parts. The first part aimed at assessing
patients’ long covid-related symptoms over the previous 30 days with the checklist of
symptoms identified above, a list we named the long covid Symptom Tool (ST). The second
part aimed at assessing the disease's impact on their lives over the past 30 days from the
responses to six questions constructed from themes identified and examples provided by
patients in their open-ended answers. Items used a numeric scale ranging from 0 (no impact)
to 10 (maximal impact). This second instrument was called the long covid Impact Tool (IT).
These two instruments were reappraised by the two author patients (BC and CC) for content
validity, clarity, and wording during a telephone interview with the main investigator (VTT)
that used the double interview method.27

Stage 2: Validation of the long covid symptom and impact tools
A second sample of adult patients reporting a SARS-CoV 2 infection (laboratory confirmed or
not) with symptoms persisting three weeks past the initial infection served as the validation
sample. Patients who had participated in the first stage could also participate in the validation
stage. In addition, we increased our sample through a call for participation on the
“TousAntiCOVID” app, the official French contact tracing app used by 12 million people. As
our instrument intends to evaluate patients’ current symptoms and their impact, only patients
reporting at least one symptom during the previous 30 days could participate in the validation
study.

Each tool was validated independently. The long covid ST score was defined as the number of
symptoms reported by patients, and the long covid IT score as the sum of the responses to
each impact question.
Construct validity was determined by confirming several theories or conceptions (ie,
constructs) about long covid. First, we hypothesised that both the ST and IT scores would be
negatively correlated with patients’ quality of life, which was evaluated with the EuroQol
five-dimension five-level (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire and the EuroQol visual analogue scale
(EQ-VAS).28 Our second hypothesis was that both the ST and IT scores would be positively
correlated with patients’ functional status after covid-19, assessed by the Post-Covid
Functional Scale (PCFS), an ordinal tool categorising patients in 5 grades ranging from 0 “No
functional limitation” to 4 “Severe functional limitations”.29 30 Finally, we hypothesised that
both the ST and IT scores would also be negatively correlated with patients’ general
perceived health, assessed with the Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile 2 (MYMOP2)
tool, an instrument focused on complaints that patients identified as most important to them.31
Correlations were assessed by Spearman correlation coefficients (rs) and considered high with
rs > 0.50 and moderate with rs = 0.35 to 0.50.
The reliability of both the ST and IT scores was determined by the test-retest method. Some
patients completed the questionnaires twice: at baseline and two weeks later. Reproducibility
was assessed by the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for agreement.32 The 95%
confidence intervals (95% CIs) were determined by a bootstrap method. Reproducibility was
considered acceptable with ICC > 0.70.33 Reliability was also tested by Bland and Altman
plots, which present the differences between two measurements against the means of the two
measurements.34 Finally, internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach’s α and was
considered acceptable between 0.70 and 0.95.35
The Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) is the level of a continuous treatment outcome
measure below which patients consider themselves well.36 The PASS for the long covid IT
was determined by matching the scores to an anchor question: “Taking into account all your
symptoms in daily life and your functional impairment, do you consider that your current
state is satisfactory?” The threshold was the impact score below which 75% of patients
considered their symptom state acceptable.37 Percentile bootstrap with 2000 replications
provided the 95% CIs.
Statistical analyses were performed with R v. 3.6.3.

Patient and public involvement
The tools were developed from qualitative data about patients’ lived experiences, captured
during a survey with open-ended questions. The qualitative results and the implementation of
the items in the patient reported tools were discussed in detail with two patients meeting the
criteria for long covid. They also participated in the critical revision of the manuscript and are
co-authors of the paper (BC and CC).

Results
Step 1: Development of the long covid symptom and impact tools
from patients’ lived experiences
During the survey period (from October 14 to November 29, 2020), 528 members of the
ComPaRe cohort received emails inviting them to complete the open-ended survey, and 492
(93%) did so. Their median age was 45 years (IQR 35 to 50.25), and 414 (84%) were women.
In total, 210 (43%) had tested positive for SARS-CoV2 by PCR swab or serological assay and
were considered confirmed covid-19 patients. Median time since symptom onset was 217
days (IQR 205 to 230) (Supplementary material 2).
Participants’ open-ended answers represented a corpus of 116 657 words. Inductive content
analysis of patients’ answers was stopped after the analysis of 380 answers and the definition
of 53 symptoms of long covid because models showed that 99.99% of all possible symptoms
had been identified in both the total sample and in the subgroups of confirmed and suspected
cases (Supplementary material 3). The list of symptoms was further organised in 10
categories: general symptoms (n=11), thorax (n=6), digestive (n=3), ear/nose/throat (n=5),
eyes (n=3), genitourinary (n=2), hair and skin (n=4), musculoskeletal (n=4), neurological
(n=11), and blood and lymph circulation (n=4) symptoms (Supplementary material 4).
The analysis of patients’ open-ended answers also enabled us to identify six aspects of
patients’ lives that were affected by long covid: 1) difficulties in performing personal
activities such as driving, shopping, or doing household chores; 2) difficulties in their
professional lives; 3) difficulties in fulfilling their family roles and/or feeling that they're a
burden to their family or friends; 4) difficulties related to social activities; 5) morale, fear of
the future and of not returning to normal, and 6) negative impact on relationships with care
providers. Examples of what patients wrote are provided in Supplementary material 5.

Thus the list of symptoms and the themes and examples related to the impact of long covid on
patients’ lives were used to develop preliminary versions of the long covid tools, which were
further reviewed and improved by two patients. The Box presents the items for both tools.

Step 2: Validation of the long covid symptom and impact tools
From November 30, 2020, to February 15, 2021, 1360 ComPaRe participants reported they
had had long covid. In all, 1022 had experienced at least one covid-19-related symptom in the
30 days before responding to the survey and were included in the validation sample. Among
them, 418 (40%) had participated in the development sample, in the first stage. Table 1
presents the characteristics of all patients included in the validation sample. Their median age
was 45 years (IQR 37 to 52), and 817 (79.9%) were women. Overall, 564 (55%) had tested
positive for SARS-CoV2 by PCR swab or serological assay and were considered confirmed
cases. Among all cases, 128 (12.5%) patients had been hospitalised for covid-19, and 17
(1.7%) had been admitted to an ICU. The median time since symptom onset was 263 days
(IQR 123 to 289), with a bimodal distribution corresponding to the first (260 to 300 days) and
second waves (50 to 100 days) in France.
Symptoms and impact of long covid
The median long covid ST score was 16 (IQR 11 to 23). This score reports the number of
symptoms patients experienced over the last 30 days and has a theoretical range from 0 (no
symptoms) to 53 (all symptoms identified during step 1). The symptoms most frequently
reported were fatigue (n=899), headaches (n=709), difficulties concentrating/mental fog
(n=650), sleep disorders (n=603), and dyspnoea (n=570) (Figure 1). Symptom frequency was
similar in confirmed and suspected cases except for “change/loss of taste” and “change/loss of
smell”, both more frequent in confirmed cases. Besides symptoms, 824 patients (80.6%)
reported a relapsing-remitting disease course with daily (n=285, 34.6%), weekly (n=320,
38.8%), or less than weekly (n=219, 26.6%) relapses.
Patients' median long covid IT score was 36 (IQR 24 to 45). This score has a theoretical range
of 0 (no impact) to 60 (maximum impact) and represents the sum of item scores for the six
questions related to the disease's impact on their personal activities, family lives, professional
lives, social lives, their morale, and their relationships with care providers. In all, 265 (26%)
patients rated the impact of the disease on their work lives at 10 (out of 10). In general, the
disease's impact on patients’ lives was similar for patients with confirmed and suspected

infections, except for the item about its effect on their relationships with care givers, which
was rated higher in suspected cases (Supplementary material 6).
The long covid ST and IT scores were highly correlated (rs=0.54, p<0.0001) and did not seem
to differ by time from symptom onset (Supplementary material 7).
Construct validity
Overall, 970 (95%) patients completed the EQ-5D-5L quality of life questionnaire, the EQVAS scale, and the PCFS functional status scale, while 746 (73%) answered the MYMOP2
questionnaire.
For health-related quality of life, the median EQ-5D-5L and EQ-VAS values in our sample
were respectively 0.83 (IQR 0.60 to 0.89) and 51 (IQR 40 to 70). As hypothesised, we found
that the long covid ST score was moderately and negatively correlated with the EQ-5D-5L
questionnaire (rs = -0.45, p<0.0001) and the EQ-VAS (rs = -0.39, p<0.0001), while the long
covid IT score had a strongly negative correlation with the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire (rs = 0.59, p<0.0001) and the EQ-VAS (rs = -0.54, p<0.0001).
For functional assessments, 469 (48%) patients in our sample indicated that they were no
longer able to perform some activities at home or at work by themselves (grade 3 or 4 of the
PCFS), and 371 (38%) reported that they had had to reduce some of their activities (grade 2 of
the PCFS). We found a moderate correlation between the long covid ST score and the PCFS
score (rs = -0.39, p<0.0001) and a high correlation between the long covid IT score and the
PCFS score (rs = -0.55, p<0.0001).
Similarly, for patients’ perceived health state, we found that the long covid ST score was
moderately correlated with the MYMOP2 score (rs = -0.40, p<0.0001) while the long covid IT
score was highly correlated with it (rs = -0.59, p<0.0001) (Table 2).
Reliability
Of the 351 patients invited to complete the long covid ST and IT twice for the test-retest, 235
(67%) did so. The symptom score had an ICC of 0.83 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.86), with Bland and
Altman plots showed a mean difference of 0.8 (95% limits of agreement, -14 and 16). The
impact score's ICC was 0.84 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.87), with Bland and Altman plots showing a
mean difference of 0.5 (95% limits of agreement, -11 to 12 (Figure 2). Finally, Cronbach’s
alpha was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.88 to 0.90) for the long covid ST score and 0.86 (95% CI, 0.85 to
0.88) for the IT score.

Patient acceptable symptom state
Only 229 (22.4%) patients reported an acceptable symptomatic state, while 793 (77.5%)
patients reported it was unacceptable. Long covid's impact was considered acceptable for
>75% of patients with IT scores < 30 (95% CI, 28 to 33), that is, below 50% of the maximum
score. (Figure 3).

Discussion
In this study, we present the long covid ST and IT. They are the first set of validated and
reliable instruments for monitoring this disease's symptoms and impact and assess
respectively 53 long covid symptoms and 6 dimensions of patients’ lives that it can affect.
Until now, two issues have limited the assessment of long covid. First, the sets of symptoms
used have been both unreliable and defined from the care givers’ perspective. The number of
symptoms assessed in studies has ranged from 8 to 205 manifestations, the latter also
including triggers and laboratory test result anomalies3

and usually failed to cover

difficulties in concentration, even though several studies report that this symptom is frequent
in long covid.8

38

The long covid ST and IT were built from patients’ lived experiences,

captured during a survey with open-ended questions. Our tools thus provide a comprehensive
picture of the disease. By using mathematical models to assess data saturation, we ensured
that our instruments covered all manifestations and impacts of long covid relevant to patients.
Both of our tools showed robust psychometric properties. Construct validity was
demonstrated by the high correlations with patients’ quality of life, functional status, and
perceived health state. Reliability was excellent with an ICC ≥ 0.8 during the test-retest.
Finally, we defined a PASS (Patient Acceptable Symptomatic State) for long covid that
provides thresholds to be met by pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological interventions
aimed at reducing its impact on patients’ lives.
Second, most studies have focused on counting symptoms, but have failed to assess the
disease's impact on patients’ lives.4

The long covid IT fills this gap by providing

validated, and reliable questions for assessing its burden. This is critical, in view of the major
impact that long covid has on the quality of life and functioning of the patients in our
ComPaRe cohort. The health related quality of life for patients with long covid, assessed with
the EQ-VAS, was on average 40% lower than in the reference general population,39 and
similar to that of patients living with epilepsy or multiple sclerosis.40 Half reported impaired

functioning, that is, they were no longer able to perform some activities unassisted at home or
at work (PCFS grade 3 or 4), a figure similar to that described in the study by Davis et al.38
The symptoms captured in the long covid ST overlap with those presented in sections 2.5 and
2.6 of the recent case report form issued by the WHO for the follow-up of patients after their
acute illness. The WHO form covers 45 symptoms of long Covid (all included in our
instrument) and includes questions on patients’ functioning (e.g., washing themselves,
dressing, ability to join in community activities, etc.).22 Our set of instruments goes further by
inquiring about patients’ perceptions of the disease's impact on their lives, roles, and
relationships, beyond assessing whether they can or cannot perform specific activities.
Moreover, besides collecting information, our instruments provide a scoring method
producing valid and reproducible measurements of the disease- and patient-relevant cut-offs
to interpret these measures. In all, the overlap of the long covid ST and IT with the WHO case
report form strengthens the content validity of our instruments and provides a glimpse of the
potential validity and reliability of the WHO form.
This study has limitations. Generalisation of the estimates obtained in this study must be
cautious. Our study recruited volunteer patients who reported persistent symptoms. This
might have selected younger, more educated, and more often female patients willing to share
their experiences with others and/or with more severe conditions. Nonetheless, we were able
to involve and validate our instrument in a diverse sample of participants by using a broad
media campaign and a call for participation on the “TousAntiCOVID” app.41 Second, our
study may not be appropriate for examining the longitudinal impact of the disease. Although
we recruited patients with various times from symptom onset, the assessment of symptoms
and impact was cross-sectional. Future work following up patients with standardised,
validated tools is required to investigate the duration of the disease and the course of the
symptoms over time. Finally, in view of the limited number of patients who were hospitalised
in ICUs in our study, we cannot confirm that our tool is suitable for measuring the
consequences of ICU on patients.
According to the United Kingdom Office for National Statistics, 10% of people who were
infected with SARS-CoV-2 still experience symptoms after three months, including those
whose acute infection was asymptomatic.42 With about 100 million cases of COVID-19
worldwide, long covid may well affect millions of patients. The severe burden of illness and
the impairment of quality of life associated with long covid call for urgent research to

and reliable measurements in these initiatives will enable the comparison and combination of
study results.

Conclusions
The long covid Symptom and Impact Tools, constructed from patients’ lived experience,
provide the first validated, reliable instruments for monitoring the symptoms and impact of
long covid. It may help the development of treatment strategies to mitigate the considerable
burden of this disease.

• On your social life (avoiding relationships because of the way people look at you, coping
with others not taking your disease seriously, being afraid of infecting others)
• On your morale/mood (low morale, feeling that life is passing you by, fearing of the future
or not recovering)
• On your relationship with caregivers (guilt, taking the illness seriously, lack of response,
complexity of the care pathway)

Relations between the scores and continuous variables were explored with Spearman’s
correlation coefficient. Correlation coefficients range from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to
1 (perfect positive correlation) with 0 indicating no correlation. *Higher EQ5D scores indicate
better quality of life; higher PCFS scores indicate more severe functional limitations; higher
MYMOP2 scores indicate worse general health.
