Summary (198/200 words)
Virus detection methods are important to cope with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics.
Apart from the lung, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in multiple organs in severe cases.
Less is known on organ tropism in patients developing mild or no symptoms, and
some of such patients might be missed in symptom-indicated swab testing.
Here we tested and validated several approaches and selected the most reliable RTPCR protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patients’ routine diagnostic
formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens available in pathology, to
assess a) organ tropism in samples from COVID-19-positive patients, b)
unrecognized cases in selected tissues from negative or not-tested patients during a
pandemic peak, and c) retrospectively, pre-pandemic lung samples.
We identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in four samples from confirmed COVID-19 patients,
in two gastric biopsies, one colon resection, and one pleural effusion specimen, while
all other specimens, particularly from patients with mild COVID-19 disease course,
were negative. In the pandemic peak cohort, we identified one previously
unrecognized COVID-19 case in tonsillectomy samples. All pre-pandemic lung
samples were negative.
In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in FFPE pathology specimens can
potentially improve surveillance of COVID-19, allow retrospective studies, and
advance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 organ tropism and effects.

Introduction
Identification and isolation of infected individuals with severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an effective preventive measure to limit
the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Previous studies suggested
that between 40-45% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop only mild
symptoms or even remain asymptomatic (Oran and Topol, 2020). Some patients may
initially present with very mild respiratory or atypical, e.g., gastrointestinal, symptoms
(Wang, et al., 2020). This could limit the effectiveness in identifying infected
individuals if the examination is indicated only by the presence of symptoms. Apart
from the nasal and respiratory tract and the lung (Hou, et al., 2020), several organs
have been described as positive for viral RNA, especially the salivary gland, heart,
liver, central nervous system, kidneys, lymph nodes, spleen, and colon (Azzi, et al.,
2020, Lamers, et al., 2020, Puelles, et al., 2020, Sekulic, et al., 2020).
Pathologists analyze a wide variety of samples from virtually all tissues, most of
which are formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE). The latter is an efficient
method for long-term preservation of proteins and nucleic acids but also inactivates
infectious agents, including SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the analysis of FFPE
specimens does not require the high biosafety precautions required for swabs or
unfixed specimens. A smaller proportion of specimens analyzed in pathology,
particularly for perioperative diagnostics, biobanking, and some cytologic analyses,
are processed unfixed and are thus potentially infectious (Guerini-Rocco, et al.,
2020). To date, the majority of SARS-CoV-2 RNA analyses have been performed on
FFPE autopsy specimens or cell pellets (Liu, et al., 2020, Puelles, et al., 2020). For
the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in non-autopsied tissues, mainly case reports on a

small number of individual patients and very few studies with more than 20 cases
focusing on single organs have been published so far (Escher, et al., 2020,
Smithgall, et al., 2020). In this single-center study, we established a SARS-CoV-2
RNA detection protocol for FFPE material to a) assess the feasibility of detecting viral
RNA in samples from clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients, b) evaluate the
potential use of FFPE samples to screen for previously unrecognized infected
patients, and c) consider the use of archival material, e.g. to screen for potential
cases before identification of the first local index patients, as recently proposed
(Deslandes, et al., 2020). To search for previously unrecognized infected patients,
given the previous data on the traceability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in various tissues
and organs, we focused on samples from oropharyngeal and sinonasal mucosa,
salivary glands, lung, colon, and kidney (Borczuk, et al., 2020, Guerini-Rocco, et al.,
2020, Puelles, et al., 2020, Remmelink, et al., 2020, Sekulic, et al., 2020).
One of the first and most affected SARS-CoV-2 hotspots in Germany was in the
catchment area of our center in Aachen, with 22% asymptomatic patients (Streeck, et
al., 2020). Therefore, our Institute of Pathology was well-positioned to address the
above research questions using FFPE material from our diagnostic archive.

Results

Evaluation of various RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection systems for FFPE
specimens screening
Using a SARS-CoV-2 RNA standard with a defined viral copy number (2-fold
dilution), we validated two different one-step RT-PCR methods (RealStar and
TaqMan) in single- and multiplex approaches with different primer and probe sets for
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection (Figure 1a), and evaluated RNA detection in FFPE
samples in this context. The RealStar method is a simple single-tube assay that
detects the SARS-CoV-2 S gene and the B-βCoV E gene in a multiplex approach as
a dual-target assay. We measured amplification and, using linear regression, found
that RT-PCR efficiency for the SARS-CoV-2 S gene was within the range of efficient
RT-PCR (90-110%) (Taylor, et al., 2010). In contrast, the efficiency of the B-βCoV E
gene was outside this range (<90%). Using the TaqMan method, we analyzed the
RT-PCR efficiencies of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene, the RdRp gene, and the N gene as
previously suggested (Corman, et al., 2020), in a singleplex approach for selecting
two assays to establish a dual-target assay. We found that the E- and RdRp-gene
assays were within the range of efficient RT-PCR, but the N-gene assay was out of
this range (>110%). Therefore, we additionally analyzed the RT-PCR efficiency of the
E- and RdRp-gene in a multiplex approach as a potential method to save resources,
but we found that the efficiency decreased in the multiplex approach (Figure 1b). In
addition to RT-PCR efficiency, we determined the theoretical limit of detection by the

y-axis intercept of the linear regression, i.e., the Ct value of the smallest detectable
unit of a viral copy number μL-1. The detection limit of the RealStar multiplex and
TaqMan singleplex approach was similar for all assays, but for the TaqMan multiplex
approach, the detection limit decreased compared to the singleplex approach (Figure
1c). In general, we observed higher Ct values (2-5 Ct values) for detection of the
RdRp gene in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA standard dilution compared to detection of the
E gene at the same viral copy number. Based on the Ct values of the SARS-CoV-2
RNA standard dilution series, we additionally found that the multiplex RealStar
approach became inaccurate at <100 viral copy numbers μL-1. With the singleplex
TaqMan approach, detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by the E and RdRp genes was
accurate up to 3 viral copy numbers μL-1, whereas detection by the N gene became
inaccurate at <25 copies μL-1. The multiplex TaqMan approach with E and RdRp
gene became inaccurate at <100 viral copy numbers μL-1 (Table 1). To evaluate RTPCR methods in FFPE samples, we used diluted RNA (1:50) isolated from the
trachea and lung of clinically confirmed COVID-19 autopsy cases. We tested the
RealStar multiplex and TaqMan singleplex approaches for the E-gene assay and
found that in the same samples, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was negative with the
RealStar method but positive with the TaqMan method (Table 2).
Therefore, we established a workflow for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection using the
TaqMan RT-PCR singleplex approach with the E gene assay for screening RNA
isolated from FFPE tissue samples from patients. For confirmatory testing (dualtarget assay), we established the RdRp gene assay (Supplementary Figure 2).

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the COVID-19 Patients Cohort
In the COVID-19-positive patient cohort, the relatively small number of tissue
samples (n = 34 samples from 22 patients) was not surprising because invasive
procedures are kept to a minimum in COVID-19 patients. The 34 samples included
two gastric biopsy specimens, one colon resection specimen, and one FFPE
specimen from a cytospin preparation of a pleural effusion in which SARS-CoV-2
RNA was detectable (Figure 2a, 2d; Table 3). Using fluorescence in situ hybridization
(FISH)), intracytoplasmic SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detectable in cells morphologically
identified as macrophages (Figure 2b'), supported by hematoxylin-eosin staining
(Figure 2c'). This sample, as well as autopsy lung samples from COVID-19 patients
(Figure 2b''', 2c''', 2d), allowed us to confirm the specificity of the RT-PCR method
with an independent FISH approach using a different target RNA sequence. All
remaining samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Tables 3 and 4). Notably, in
patients with mild disease progression (i.e. not requiring mechanical ventilation) and
early COVID-19 stage, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detectable in soft tissues, normal
and neoplastic oral mucosa, lymph nodes, salivary gland, ovarian and peritoneal
lavage fluid, placenta, and a lung biopsy. In patients with severe disease (i.e.
requiring mechanical ventilation) and early COVID-19, samples from soft tissues,
thymoma, and also from pleural effusion were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Morphologically, no characteristic features of viral infection or sequelae of viral
infection were evident in extrapulmonary tissues. Lung samples from three patients
with onset of COVID-19 symptoms long before surgery, i.e., 50-81 days, showed
pulmonary morphologies consistent with the severity of clinical COVID-19 disease

progression, e.g. focal fibrosis in a mild disease course (patient 10, Table 3, Figure
3a’ and 3a’’) and diffuse fibrosis with nearly complete obliteration of the alveolar
spaces in severe disease courses (patient 17, Table 4, Figure 3b’ and 3b’’).
Confounding factors such as previous lung disease, radiation to the lungs, or a
history of tobacco abuse were not known to exist in these patients.

SARS-CoV-2 detection in the Pandemic Peak Cohort
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in two samples from the pandemic peak period in a
previously unrecognized COVID-19 patient (Figure 2a). The positive samples were
bilateral tonsillectomy specimens from a young female patient with clinical symptoms
of tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess formation (Figure 2b'', 2c'' and 2d). She
remained without symptoms typical for COVID-19. The remaining N = 221 specimens
from the head and neck, colon, lung, and kidney during the pandemic peak were
negative (Supplementary Table 2,Supplementary Table 3).

SARS-CoV-2 detection in the Pre-Pandemic Cohort showed no positive cases
None of the samples in the pre-pandemic cohort were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA
(Figure 2a).

Discussion
This study established and validated SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection methods in nonautopsy FFPE tissues, showing its utility as a prospective and retrospective
screening method and a tool to investigate organ tropism and effects of SARS-CoV2. We used commercially available kits, that enable broad applicability, and validated
the analytical efficiency and limit of detection, as suggested previously (Vogels, et al.,
2020). We established a dual-target assay using the E gene assay (TaqMan) as firstline screening and the RdRp gene assay (TaqMan) as a confirmatory test, both
assays in a singleplex approach, are in line with a previous study (Corman, et al.,
2020). A dual-target assay is included in most commercially available molecular
diagnostic kits for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection to increase sensitivity and specificity,
but single-target assays are also available (Afzal, 2020). Our results show typical
analytical RT-PCR efficiencies for the target E and RdRp gene assays, and the
detection limit of the RdRp gene was higher than that of the E gene. When
comparing the Ct values of the E and RdRp gene assays of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA
standard dilution with each other, we found that the Ct values at the same viral copy
number for the RdRp gene were generally higher than the Ct values of the E gene,
indicating lower virus detection rates by the RdRp gene assay. A possible reason for
this observation could be the detection of genomic and subgenomic mRNA, since the
RdRp gene is present only in genomic mRNA (ORF1b) and the E gene is present in
the genomic and also in subgenomic mRNA (Alexandersen, et al., 2020, Kim, et al.,
2020). Therefore, we used the E gene standard to determine the viral load in
samples. Previous studies attributed the lower virus detection to mismatch of the

RdRp reverse primer and described the assay as not reliable for samples with <1000
copy numbers μL-1 (Corman, et al., 2020). In contrast, we found accurate viral
detection up to a viral copy number of 3 μL-1 using the RdRp gene assay. However,
in the clinically confirmed COVID-19 patient cohort, we found four positive samples
using the detection of the E gene, two with a high viral load (>80 viral copies μL-1)
and two with a low viral load (<5 viral copies μL-1), whereas both samples with low
viral load were undetectable using the RdRp gene assay. This suggests that
detection of the RdRp gene in RNA isolated from FFPE samples is less efficient
compared to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA standard, but the RdRp gene can be detected up
to at least 80 viral copies μL-1. Taken together, our established SARS-CoV-2 RNA
detection method provides a reliable screening method for RNA isolated from FFPE
specimens.
The virus detection method can be used to analyze viral spread in different organs
and disease mechanisms by correlating pathological and molecular findings with
virus presence in specimens from previously confirmed COVID-19 patients. Previous
studies in autopsies from deceased COVID-19 patients suggested that a low to very
low viral load can be detected in extrapulmonary organs (Best Rocha, et al., 2020,
Menter, et al., 2020, Polak, et al., 2020, Puelles, et al., 2020, Sekulic, et al., 2020,
Wichmann, et al., 2020). However, these are all severe and fatal cases, and it
remained unclear whether such viral spread is also found in less severe and non-fatal
cases. For this, analyses of pathology specimens might likely be the only available
approach. In two out of 10 patients (20%) with a mild disease course not requiring
mechanical ventilation, we detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in two gastric biopsies at a
very early stage of infection (one day before and one day after the first positive swab,
respectively). To our knowledge, detection of viral RNA in gastric tissues has

previously not been reported. This is likely because mostly postmortem tissues were
analyzed, which are usually subject to strong autolytic changes in the stomach. We
detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in two out of 12 patients (17%) with a severe disease
course requiring mechanical ventilation. We also identified a SARS-CoV-2 RNApositive FFPE sample from a pleural effusion cytospin preparation of a severely ill
COVID-19 patient in the early phase of infection (<21 days after first symptoms,
patient 12, Table 4). Because the sample contained predominantly macrophages,
this suggests the presence of the virus in these cells. We confirmed and visualized
this finding with direct detection of viral RNA by FISH in these cells, in agreement
with previous reports showing SARS-CoV-2 RNA in pleural effusion fluid (Lescure, et
al., 2020, Mei, et al., 2020). Finally, we found a positive colonic resection specimen,
interestingly in a late-stage 57 days after the first positive test, confirming previous
reports of positive RNA detection in the colon and wastewaters (Lamers, et al., 2020,
Lodder and de Roda Husman, 2020, Remmelink, et al., 2020). We found no other
SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive cases in the remaining 30 samples from 18 confirmed
COVID-19 patients.
Of the ten PCR-negative samples from COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms,
one patient was in an asymptomatic early phase of the disease (one day before the
first symptoms), and nine were in a late phase of the disease, i.e. >21 days after the
first symptoms. In the late phase of the disease, the virus was likely already
eliminated from the organism by the immune system, and therefore was not
detectable in the colon or the lungs. The negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR of the lung
samples, some of which showed progressive circumscribed or organized diffuse
alveolar damage (Figure 3), suggests ongoing tissue damage in the absence of the
virus and thereby might help to differentiate direct effects from sequelae of COVID-

19. The data also confirm the concept of fibrotic pulmonary late effects of COVID-19
(Polak, et al., 2020).
We investigated the feasibility of using pathology specimens to screen for SARSCoV-2. We did this because a) even during the first pandemic peak in our region,
SARS-CoV-2 testing was only performed when patients were symptomatic, whereas
some infections are known to be mild or even asymptomatic, b) false-negative
results, especially depending on the stage of the disease, are not uncommon, c) no
additional patient intervention is required to perform this test, d) in case of a positive
result, improved tracing of infection would be possible, e) in case of a positive result,
additional and more complex molecular analyses on these tissues would be possible,
e.g. cell-specific virus detection using FISH. For this analysis, we focused on the
period of the first local pandemic peak and on tissues that were most frequently
positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in previous studies. Interestingly, among the n = 223
samples analyzed, we found one previously unrecognized positive patient who
underwent bilateral tonsillectomy. In addition to identifying new COVID-19 patients,
this might also help to improve occupational hazard assessment for staff involved in
specimen acquisition, e.g. in surgery, and processing, e.g. in pathology. The analysis
of SARS-CoV-2 RNA can provide information on potential exposure to such
unrecognized infectious specimens, which is particularly important in perioperative
diagnostics, biobanking, or cytology, where fresh unfixed specimens are processed
directly.
Finally, this method also allows retrospective studies to be performed on archived
FFPE material. A previous study reported a retrospective positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA
detection in a respiratory specimen from December 2019 in France, well before the
onset of the pandemic in Europe (Deslandes, et al., 2020). In our cohort focusing on

the most affected lung tissues, we did not find a single positive case between
December 2019 and February 2020.

Limitations
The study has several limitations. These include the single-center design and the
relatively small sample size, especially for samples from COVID-19 confirmed
patients. Despite this, our screening could identify a previously unrecognized case of
COVID-19 and also indicated no viral spread in mild COVID-19 cases. We believe
that future larger and multicenter studies could further address these limitations,
potentially in a similar approach to COVID-19 autopsies, for which we recently
established the first national registry aimed at collecting data from all COVID-19
autopsies

analyses

(www.DeRegCOVID.ukaachen.de) (von Stillfried, et al., 2020).
In COVID-19 positive patients, we did not have information on the date of first
symptoms in six of the 22 cases, limiting the interpretation of these data. Another
limitation is the reduced number of specimens sent for histopathologic analysis
during the lockdown. Starting in calendar week 13 in 2020, all hospitals were asked
to postpone all elective procedures to keep ICUs free for COVID-19 patients and
minimize the risk of transmission to patients within the hospital. This was reflected in
a 12% reduction in pathology specimens received at our center compared with the
same time in previous years (data not shown), which has also been reported
previously (Stathonikos, et al., 2020). Besides, the surgical staff was reduced to
minimize potential exposure to infection, and many patients were also reluctant to
seek medical attention during this time (Dinmohamed, et al., 2020). Even though our

center was located in one of the hardest-hit early hotspots in Germany, the number of
cases was still very low compared with pandemic activity in some other countries.
Therefore, our results cannot be generalized to other centers, countries, or pandemic
situations. Another limitation includes the use of FFPE material itself. Formalin is
known to result in RNA degradation, which might reduce the sensitivity. However, in
positive cases, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detectable even at higher dilutions, when
RNA concentration was not detectable or the RNA was strongly degraded, e.g. in
autopsy cases.
Finally, our assay approach was not quantitative in terms of viral RNA copy
numbers. Accurate quantification is probably not well possible for these samples
given the variability in the preanalytical phase and thus potential virus and RNA
degradation, i.e., unclear and variable time between surgery/sample collection and
formalin fixation and unclear and variable duration of formalin fixation itself. However,
from a diagnostic point of view, a dichotomous positive/negative result seems to be
sufficient for most applications.

Experimental procedures
Histology samples & cohort description
We routinely analyzed diagnostic FFPE samples archived at the Institute of
Pathology, University Hospital Aachen. The diagnostic process was completed for all
samples. The study was given ethical approval by the ethics committee at the
medical faculty of RWTH Aachen University (EK 304/20, EK 119/20, and EK 092/20).
Details of the total number of identified samples, selection and exclusion criteria,
topography of the samples, and final numbers of selected samples included in the
study are shown in Supplementary Figure 1 and outlined in the Supplementary
Methods in more detail.

RNA isolation from FFPE specimens and SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection
We extracted RNA from FFPE tissue using a Maxwell® 16 LEV RNA FFPE
Purification Kit (Promega GmbH, Walldorf, Germany) on the Maxwell® 16 IVD
instrument (Promega GmbH) or with the ReliaPrep™ FFPE Total RNA Miniprep
System (Promega GmbH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The workflow
for sample preparation is shown in Supplementary Figure 2. We stored the RNA
samples at -80°C until further processing.
We examined two different kits for RT-PCR analysis. We used the RealStar®
SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit 1.0 (altona Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) for
qualitative multiplex detection of the S gene (encoding spike glycoprotein) of SARSCoV-2 and the E gene (encoding envelope protein) of lineage B beta-coronavirus (B-

performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.(Lohse, et al., 2020,
Visseaux, et al., 2020) In addition, we used the TaqMan™ Fast 1-Step Master Mix
(Thermo Fisher Scientific GmbH, Dreieich, Germany) for the qualitative detection of
the E gene, the RdRp gene (encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene)
and the N gene (nucleocapsid protein gene) by primer and probe sets labeled with
fluorescent reporters and Quencher dyes. We used TaqMan® Exogenous Internal
Positive Control reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific GmbH, Dreieich, Germany) as
internal PCR controls. We tested for TaqMan™ singleplex and multiplex assays. RTPCR was performed according to a previous publication (Remmelink, et al., 2020).
The primer and probe sequences used and the corresponding concentrations for RTPCR are listed in Supplementary Table 5.

Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by SARS-CoV-2 RNA control
We evaluated the two RT-PCR kits and the different primer and probe sets with the
Amplirun® SARS-CoV-2 RNA control (bestbion dx GmbH, Cologne, Germany)
provided with 13000 viral RNA copies μL-1. We prepared a 2-fold dilution series with
12 concentrations. We tested the multiplex approach of the RealStar® kit, the
singleplex approach of the TaqMan™ kit with each of the E, RdRp, and N genes, and
the multiplex approach of the TaqMan™ kit with the E and RdRp genes in
combination. To further evaluate the methods, we used diluted RNA isolated from
FFPE tissue from clinically confirmed COVID-19 positive autopsies (lung, trachea).

We deparaffinized freshly cut 1-μm-thick paraffin sections from the RT-PCR-positive
cytology sample and a clinically confirmed COVID-19-positive autopsy lung sample,
followed by dehydration with 100% ethanol. We performed FISH on the sections
using the RNAscope® Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v2 assay (Advanced Cell
Diagnostics, Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Statistical and Data Analysis
Using a SARS-CoV-2 RNA standard, we created a 2-fold dilution series to determine
a standard curve for each RT-PCR assay by linear regression of the measured Ct
values as a function of log viral copy number (Supplementary Figure 3). We
determined the detection limit of each RT-PCR assay based on the y-intercept,
making the smallest unit of a copy number detectable (100 = 1) (Vogels, et al., 2020).
Using the slope, we calculated the RT-PCR efficiency E according to the equation
E=100x(-1+10-1/slope) (Vogels, et al., 2020).
