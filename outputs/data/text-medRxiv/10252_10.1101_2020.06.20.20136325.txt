ABSTRACT
Background: With the lack of an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, mathematical modeling
has stepped up in the COVID-19 management to guide non-pharmaceutical intervention
(NPI) policies. Complete lockdown has been characterized as the most powerful strategy
for the epidemic; anyhow, it is associated with undeniable negative consequences. Not
aware that global panic could make countries adopt premature and lengthy lockdowns,
previous studies only warned about the inefficacy of late quarantine sets. Therefore, we

proposed ourselves to find the optimal timing and lasting for COVID-19 suppressive
measures.
Methods: We used our previously elaborated compartmental SEIR (SusceptibleExposed-Infected-Recovered) model to scan different timings for lockdown set and
various lockdown lengths under different reproduction number (R0) scenarios. We
explored healthcare parameters focusing on ICU occupation and deaths since they
condition the sanitary system and reflect the severity of the epidemic.
Results: The timing for the lockdown trigger varies according to the original R0 and has
great impact on ICU usage and fatalities. The less the R0 the later the lockdown should
be for it to be effective. The lockdown length is also something to consider. Too short
lockdowns (~15 days) have minimal effect on healthcare parameters, but too long
quarantines (>45 days) do not benefit healthcare parameters proportionally when
compared to more reasonable 30 to 45-day lockdowns. We explored the outcome of the
combination of a 45-day lockdown followed by strict mitigation measures sustained in
time, and interestingly, it outperformed the lengthy quarantine. Additionally, we show that
if strict mitigation actions were to be installed from the very beginning of the epidemic,
lockdown would not benefit substantially regarding healthcare parameters.
Conclusion: Lockdown set timing and lasting are non-trivial variables to COVID-19
management.

BACKGROUND
COVID-19 pandemic has changed our lives since its outbreak by the end of 2019. The
world is still struggling to control this catastrophe. Scientists from different areas of
expertise are working non-stop looking for a treatment, a vaccine, or the optimal public
health management. Without the possibility of immunization in the immediate future[1],
non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) remain the most effective action. In the guidance
of these NPIs mathematical modeling of the epidemic has been a critical factor.
NPIs can be divided into mitigation and suppression strategies. Mitigation criteria involve
hygienic recommendations, case-isolation, general social distancing, banning of public
gatherings, college closures, etc. Suppression measures include complete lockdown or
quarantine of the whole population except for essential activities, intending to lower the
reproduction number to ≤1 [2].

It is clear that the most potent strategy today against SARS-CoV-2 is complete lockdown,
still, this is not without collateral damage. Most evidently, the economy has been hurt
worldwide impacting as well directly in human health (increase in poverty, stress, lack of
preventive medical interventions)[3,4]. The other undeniable consequences of lockdown
are of psychological nature due to confinement, as addictions, domestic violence,
increase in obesity, deterioration of pre-existing psychiatric illnesses, disturbance in the
education especially in children[5–8], etc.
Mathematical modeling of the epidemic has been at the service of public health
strategies early in the pandemic and has supported the use of lockdown as a necessary
measure to overcome COVID-19 [2,9]. However, not aware that global fear could make
countries adopt an extremely premature suppressive policy, none have alerted of the
importance of the correct lockdown timing set.
In response to the different strategies adopted world round, we asked ourselves if the
timing and lasting of the different NPIs were critical variables to take into account when
embracing them. Furthermore, we proposed ourselves to analyze the optimal setting of
different stages of NPIs and the possibility of combining them to achieve the best
possible outcomes.
METHODS
We based this paper on our previously elaborated SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-InfectedRecovered) model for COVID-19 epidemics that incorporates specific compartments.
We modeled asymptomatic or very mildly affected individuals as a subset of the
infectious compartment and integrated healthcare burden parameters[10]. In the
supplementary material (supplementary figures and tables), we expose the
compartments and parameters that we used in our model. Furthermore, we share the
set of differential equations that give rise to the model.
We considered an infective injection of 100 symptomatic cases/1 million inhabitants on
day 0 for the modeled scans.
To facilitate the use of the model, the simulation was programmed in the free software
COPASI (copasi.org), and the corresponding file is provided as supplementary material.
RESULTS
When to start lockdown? Under which primary conditions?
If a single lockdown was raised as the strategy, when would it be more beneficial to start
it? Is a premature or late quarantine effective as far as healthcare parameters? Under

which basic reproduction conditions (R0) would it be more convenient to trigger
lockdown?
To answer these questions, we scanned the set of a single 45-day lockdown at different
times during the epidemic progression in an R0=2.3 scenario. In other words, at different
times, the R0 was switched from 2.3 to 1 for 45 days and then raised to 2.3 until the end
of the simulation. The results are shown in video 1 (Supplementary material, video 1)
and Figure 1. If the lockdown is initiated too early, its only effect is to delay the epidemic’s
onset without affecting the final fatality number nor the maximal ICU occupancy (Fig.
1A). According to our scan, to minimize the ICU requirements over time, quarantine
should start at day 87 (Fig. 1B). To reduce deaths, lockdown should be triggered on day
105 (Fig. 1C). Finally, as expected, a late start has no effect on the epidemic
consequences (Figure 1D). It is worth noticing that the least fatalities do not match with
the least ICU occupation, this is because the number of deaths accumulate in time and
ICU holding changes over time according to the incorporation and release of patients to
the healthcare system. One would obviously prefer to minimize deaths. Even so, the
capacity of the local healthcare system regarding ICU should be taken into account when
deciding the best option for the local scenario.

Figure 1: Quarantine set at different times in a R0=2.3 scenario. A and D show too early and too
late lockdowns without any impact on healthcare parameters (ICU and deaths). B and C show
effective lockdown settings regarding ICU occupancy (B) and fatalities (C).

It is evident that the timing for quarantine set is vital for a better outcome. To explore the
best lockdown starting times to minimize fatalities and ICU occupancy, the same scan
was performed under different R0s. Considering R0=4 for a totally uncontrolled scenario
(as observed in Europe in March 2020[11]), R0=2.3 as considered in the first instance of
the epidemic in Wuhan, China[12], R0=1.5 as strict mitigation measures and R0=1 as
complete lockdown.
Figure 2 shows the maximum ICU usage and fatalities, according to when the lockdown
is started. The lower the basal R0 is, the later the effective lockdown should be, and the
fewer deaths and ICU use is observed. Furthermore, the lower the R0, the less the slope
of the curve and the more flexible the period for which an effective lockdown could be
triggered. Additionally, this analysis shows that if strict mitigation measures could be

sustained in time from the beginning of the epidemic (initial R0=1.5) lockdown would not
change deaths nor ICU requirements substantially.

Figure 2: Fatalities and maximum ICU occupancy according to the R0 and lockdown set timing
(a single 45-day lockdown was used for this scan).

How long should lockdown last?
Next, we wanted to explore how long the quarantine should last for it to be efficient. With
that aim, we scanned different lockdown periods and evaluated the impact on deaths
and ICU tenancy for an R0=2.3 scenario. As expected, the longer the lockdown, the fewer
deaths and ICU requirements. Nonetheless, the advantage in healthcare parameters
and quarantine lasting is not linear. The benefit in healthcare variables increases
significantly when comparing a 15-day with a 30-day or 45-day lockdown. Quarantines
longer than that do not benefit much more regarding deaths nor ICU occupation (Figure
3)

burden parameters (deaths and ICU occupation) in a R0=2.3 scenario. B. Different lockdown
periods and their best efficacy in lowering deaths and ICU occupation in the same R0=2.3
scenario.

Combining strategies (lockdown + strict mitigation)
A 3-month lockdown, apart from untenable, would be extremely demanding due to the
social and economic impact. Furthermore, the benefit is not significant compared to a
45-day confinement period. Hence, we ventured to see if we could equal the healthcare
parameters obtained with the lengthy lockdown combining a 45-day quarantine followed
by strict mitigation strategies (R0=1.5) for a prolonged period (270 days) awaiting the
arrival of an effective vaccine or heard immunization.
In video 2 (Supplementary material, video 2) and Figure 4 we explore when this
combined strategy would be optimal to be set according to the aimed healthcare
parameters. Day 73 and day 100 would be the optimal quarantine time sets to minimize
ICU and deaths, respectively. Again, lockdown timing shows to be crucial to obtain the
best outcome.

lockdown settings regarding ICU occupancy (B) and fatalities (C)

When comparing this combined strategy with the 90-day complete lockdown, the former
outperformed the latter not only in the number of deaths and ICU usage but also, the
time for which it is optimal to set quarantine is more flexible (Figure 5)

Figure 5: ICU occupation and COVID-19 deaths according to lockdown timing set in a R0=2.3
situation using a 3-month lockdown or a combined strategy= 45-day lockdown followed by strict
mitigation measures (R0=1.5) for 270 days. The combined strategy benefits fatalities and
healthcare burden and also shows a more flexible period to set a successful quarantine.

Defining an objective lockdown trigger
It is easy to select the best day to start a lockdown after performing a scan in a simulation.
However, the same decision is exceedingly difficult in the real-life epidemic situation.
When to start a lockdown depends on a large and complex set of factors, including R0
and the present state of the epidemic. It is impossible to determine when day 1 is
because the outbreak can be missed at the beginning due to the mild symptoms of the
majority and the injection of infectious cases may vary according to different
circumstances.
As an exercise, and being aware of the oversimplifications implied, we searched for
objective parameters other than “days” that could help determine when to start the strict
confinement periods. We scanned a range of R0 associated to their optimal lockdown
trigger day (regarding ICU occupation and deaths) and explored the number of
hospitalized patients in ICU at that point. Interestingly, the ICU occupation level at which
a successful quarantine should be triggered is similar in all R0>2. Considering that in R0
<2, lockdown is questionable, we thought that ICU occupation level was the best
impartial parameter to ponder as a lockdown trigger. Notably, the level of ICU patients
at lockdown set to favor the least ICU usage is practically the same for all R0s. Using a
45-day quarantine strategy, for R0 higher than 2, to favor the least ICU occupation, the
trigger for lockdown should be around 100 occupied ICU beds/1million inhabitants. To

favor the least mortality, the trigger should be an occupation of about 400 ICU beds/1
million inhabitants. (Figure 6)

Figure 6: Defining an objective lockdown trigger. To determine the timing to set suppressive
actions, we looked for objective healthcare burden parameters. Hospitalized patients requiring
ICU(HICU) can be used to mark the lockdown trigger. Using a 45-day lockdown strategy, for R0
>2, to favor the least ICU occupation, the trigger for lockdown should be ~ 100 HICU/1million
inhabitants. To favor the least mortality, the trigger should be ~ 400 HICU/1 million inhabitants.

CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION
We have seen the world adopt a wide range of strategies in response to COVID-19 and
all have had or are having different outcomes according to the local scenarios. Premature
lockdowns have seemed to work in isolated places such as New Zealand where border’s
irruption is difficult[13]. In most countries where borders are weak or large countries that
need inner intercommunication to function, it seems that the epidemic will arrive sooner
or later, and a premature lockdown will only postpone the arrival. In the optimistic view
of an imminent vaccine this could be an ascertained strategy, but we will only know that
in the months to arrive.
With the more skeptical assumption that a vaccine would only have a chance to be
available after the end of 2020[1], the most logical strategy is to minimize the harm the
epidemic can cause as it develops. For this, different non-pharmaceutical interventions
(NPIs) are being adopted world round[2,11,14].
In this paper, we used a parametrized SEIR model to represent the COVID-19 epidemic
and show that the timing for NPIs is not trivial to the healthcare outcomes. Too premature

or too late lockdowns have no impact on deaths nor ICU occupation. We also evidenced
that a higher ICU capacity would minimize deaths and shorten the epidemic period, so
expanding the healthcare system could be a profitable but complicated strategy.
In addition, it is clear that mitigation measures cannot be released until an efficient
vaccine arrives or until heard immunization is reached. Sustained and firm mitigation
measures from the beginning could even avoid the need for a strict lockdown period and
could be an alternative for areas with low ICU capacity.
The particular days to start a lockdown strategy to minimize harm are greatly influenced
by the selected model and its parameters. Nevertheless, in most of the conceivable
scenarios, the level of hospitalized patients in ICU at a specific time can be used as a
reliable lockdown trigger.
The conclusion of this work supports that lockdown set timing and lasting are
transcendent variables to COVID-19 management.
