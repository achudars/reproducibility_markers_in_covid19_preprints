Abstract
BACKGROUND: Efficient and early triage of hospitalized Covid-19 patients to detect those with

higher risk of severe disease is essential for appropriate case management.

METHODS: We trained, validated, and externally tested a machine-learning model to early identify

patients who will die or require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization from clinical and

laboratory features obtained at admission. A development cohort with 918 Covid-19 patients was

used for training and internal validation, and 352 patients from another hospital were used for

external

testing.

deployed in an open source calculator, in which Covid-19 patients at admission are individually

stratified as being at high or non-high risk for severe disease progression.

CONCLUSIONS: This machine-learning model, applied at hospital admission, predicts risk of severe

disease progression in Covid-19 patients.

Introduction
Since late 2019, a pneumonia outbreak caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 began in the Chinese

city of Wuhan and has evolved into a global pandemic.

1

Clinical manifestations of patients with

SARS-CoV-2 infection range from mild disease (e.g., only fever or cough) to critically ill cases with

acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock. In a large report from the Chinese Center for

Disease Control and Prevention, with 44415 cases, 36160 (81%) were described as mild, 6168

(14%) as severe, and 2087 (5%) as critical illness, with a mortality of 49% in the latter group.

2

Due

to this variability, several factors have been identified to predict increased severity, such as older

3

age, neutrophilia, organ dysfunction, coagulopathy, or elevated D-dimer levels.

Therefore, in this context of worldwide health emergency, early detection

of patients who are likely to develop critical illness is of paramount importance and may aid in

delivering proper care and optimizing use of limited intensive care resources.

For this purpose, we report here a machine-learning model able to predict risk of severity of

disease progression in Covid-19 patients at the time of admission, developed and validated in two

large cohorts of patients from two university hospitals, including easy-to-collect variables such as

peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio, age, estimated

glomerular filtration rate, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, updated Charlson comorbidity index

and lymphocytes.

To develop a friendly calculator, the number of features used by the machine-learning model was

reduced from 140

to less

than 10. In order to ensure that all relevant clinical features

were

present a number of additional models were built, i.e. using combinations of death or death plus

the use of mechanical ventilation as label and restricting the data set to older of 75 years of age,

younger than 75 years of age or without age-restriction. The importance of each feature for these

models was computed using Mean Decrease Accuracy.

9

We tallied the number of times each

feature appeared as one of the most important in a model and chose the most frequent features.

Additionally, correlated features with similar importance were chosen by clinical significance and

by their availability in the external data set. The new model developed with the selected features

was validated to ensure similar results to the original one with all the features.

10.8%). Regarding clinical manifestations at admission, shortness of breath and labored breathing

were present in 68.9% and 55.7% of the patients who progressed to severe disease, respectively.

This group of patients had a significantly lower ratio of oxygen saturation as measured by pulse

oximetry divided by the fraction of inspired oxygen (391.7 vs. 296.3) and 66.4% of them required

oxygen supplement at admission whilst only 38.6% in the non-severe progression group.

Table 2 represents the laboratory findings at the time of admission by outcome. The patients with

severity of disease progression presented at admission with neutrophilia, lymphopenia and higher

levels of D-dimer, ferritin, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and fibrinogen. The critically ill group

patients had altered renal function at admission, measured by increased urea and creatinine levels

and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate.

Risk Model Performance
In order to develop the risk model, we first selected all variables included in the tables 1 and 2.

Using all the cohort patients and variables, the best model obtained in the internal cross-validation

an AUC of 0.86 (CI: 0.83-0.88). With the aim of developing a more user-friendly application and

according to the described methodology, we identified 7 variables present in all models with

independent

prognostic

significance:

peripheral

blood

oxygen

saturation

(SpO2)/fraction

of

inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, procalcitonin, C-reactive

protein, updated Charlson comorbidity index and lymphocytes. By restricting to these 7 variables,

out of the 3 trained machine-learning classifiers, the best classifier achieved a highest mean AUC

of 0.85 (CI: 0.82-0.87) from our development cohort without significant difference among them

(Figure 1).

External Testing cohort

th

2020, 352 patients were admitted at the Clinic Hospital of

Barcelona because of their first episode of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia confirmed by RT-PCR assay

from nasopharyngeal swab. Among them, 128 (36.3%) patients developed critical illness (64 died

and 77 required mechanical ventilation -13 of them finally died-) and 224 (63.6%) did not and

were discharged by May 20th. The baseline characteristics and laboratory findings at the time of

admission in this external testing cohort are represented in the Table 3. Patients with severity of

disease progression were older (median age of 68.7), with lower SpO2/FiO2%, lower glomerular

filtration rate and higher procalcitonin and C-reactive protein values. In addition, they presented

with lower lymphopenia count and higher updated CCI scores.

The three trained classifiers restricted to the 7 most relevant variables were externally validated

on this cohort. In this case, the best classifier obtained a mean AUC of 0.83 (CI: 0.81-0.85), again

without significant differences respect to the other classifiers (Figure 1) and very consistent with

the results obtained in the development cohort.

this score may therefore serve to adjust for comorbidity in other Covid-19 studies.

The ratio of oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry divided by the fraction of inspired

oxygen is a simple measure, which has been previously used in the setting of acute respiratory

distress syndrome instead of more complex variables,

16

and thus can be evaluated in each patient

with Covid-19 pneumonia to help identify patients at higher risk of severe disease.

Regarding laboratory variables, decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate and increased acute

phase reactants like procalcitonin or C-reactive protein are associated with higher risk of severe

a simple

a predictor of increased Covid-19 inpatient mortality rate has been previously described in a single-

center study in China.

Increased levels of C-reactive protein and its association with prognosis and severity in Covid-19

have been reported and correlated with pro-inflammatory response.

Disease severity has also

been linked with increased procalcitonin levels and described in some series although its elevation

might be likely associated with the presence of bacterial superinfection.

as influenza

decrease of specific lymphocyte subpopulations and tissue infiltration

.

The score presented here exhibits a very good performance and accuracy, as well as excellent

validation in the testing cohort with an easy-to-use web interface. Most previous scores have been

developed and validated among Chinese Covid-19 patients

14,18

and this is, in our knowledge, the

first risk model developed with machine-learning methodology in Caucasian population including

clinical and analytical variables at admission and therefore, it can be more applicable in Western

countries. We would also like to highlight the possibility of the open-source web calculator to

In summary, this risk model represents a reliable system that uses widely available clinical and

laboratory parameters at hospital admission. The application of machine-learning methods has led

to better prediction of the outcome for the identification of Covid-19 inpatients that will likely

develop progressive disease after admission.
