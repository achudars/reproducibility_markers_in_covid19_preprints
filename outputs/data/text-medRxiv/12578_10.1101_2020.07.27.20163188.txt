ABSTRACT: COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs, but evidence of systemic disease with multiorgan involvement is emerging. Here, we developed a blood test to broadly quantify cell, tissue,
and organ specific injury due to COVID-19, using genome-wide methylation profiling of circulating
cell-free DNA in plasma. We assessed the utility of this test to identify subjects with severe
disease in two independent, longitudinal cohorts of hospitalized patients. Cell-free DNA profiling
was performed on 104 plasma samples from 33 COVID-19 patients and compared to samples
from patients with other viral infections and healthy controls. We found evidence of injury to the
lung and liver and involvement of red blood cell progenitors associated with severe COVID-19.
The concentration of cfDNA correlated with the WHO ordinal scale for disease progression and
was significantly increased in patients requiring intubation. This study points to the utility of cellfree DNA as an analyte to monitor and study COVID-19.

The Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major global health crisis. COVID-19 is
a complex disease with diverse clinical features, ranging from asymptomatic infection to acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ dysfunction. There is an urgent need for
predictive biomarkers of COVID-19 severity detectable early in disease onset, and improved
understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Here, we have investigated the utility of
circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in blood as an analyte i) to broadly monitor cell, tissue, and
organ injury due to COVID-19, ii) to assess disease severity and predict disease outcomes, and
iii) to elucidate the multi-organ involvement that characterizes COVID-19.

Autopsy studies indicate a broad organotropism for the SARS-CoV-2 virus beyond the lungs [1],
[2]. Detection of the virus in the kidneys, heart, liver, brain and blood of many patients has been
reported [2], [3]. The significant viral burden in the kidney seen in some patients may help explain
the increased risk of acute kidney injury in patients with COVID-19. Damage to endothelial cells
may contribute to COVID-19 coagulopathy and prothrombic state [4]–[8].

Initial reports have primarily described COVID-19 as a disease affecting tissues expressing ACE2 [9]. However, there are emerging data that SARS-CoV-2 infection may also be accompanied
by hematological derangements [10]–[13]. In addition, a dysregulated immune response to SARSCoV-2 can occur, contributing to the development of ARDS, systemic tissue injury, and multiorgan failure [14]. A strong association between increased cytokine profiles and the severe
deterioration of some patients has been observed [15]. In children, a multisystem inflammatory
syndrome linked to recent SARS-CoV-2 infection is reported [16]. Given the disparate clinical
manifestations and potential complications of COVID-19, there is an urgent need for tests that
can quantify injury to multiple tissues simultaneously to monitor patients, analyze disease
pathogenesis, predict clinical outcomes, and guide clinical management in patients with COVID19.

Since the advent of cfDNA based noninvasive prenatal testing, myriad applications of cfDNA in
diagnostic medicine have been established [17]–[19]. These short fragments of circulating DNA
are the debris of dead cells from across the body. The value of cfDNA as a quantitative marker of
tissue and organ injury was first recognized in solid-organ transplantation, where the level of
transplant donor derived cfDNA in the blood is now widely used as a marker of transplant rejection
[20]–[22]. More recently, several approaches have been developed to quantify the tissues-oforigin of cfDNA and thus monitor injury to any cell, tissue or organ type [23]–[27]. This is achieved
by profiling epigenetic marks within cfDNA by quantitative molecular measurement technologies
such as DNA sequencing. Here, we tested the hypothesis that cfDNA tissues-of-origin profiling
enables the identification of specific tissue or cell types that are directly or indirectly targeted and
injured throughout COVID-19 pathogenesis. We studied two independent patient cohorts, and
found evidence of significant injury to the liver, lung, and kidney associated with COVID-19. We
further observed a striking increase, both in terms of proportion and total abundance, of cfDNA
derived from red blood cell precursors when compared to patients infected with other RNA viruses
and healthy controls. Last, the total burden of cfDNA correlated with the WHO ordinal scale for
disease progression, with an increase in cfDNA being strongly associated with admission to the
intensive care unit and need for mechanical ventilation. Thus, cfDNA can provide a marker of
disease severity as well as a prognostic tool that is straightforward to adopt.

We tested the utility of cfDNA to quantify cell, tissue, and organ specific injury associated with
COVID-19 in two independent patient cohorts from two different hospitals in North America (Fig.
1A, supplementary table 1,2). We assayed a total of 104 plasma samples from 33 patients
across these cohorts. We performed shotgun DNA sequencing after bisulfite treatment to
determine the tissues-of-origin of cfDNA isolated from all plasma samples by methylation profiling.
We obtained 62 ± 35 million (mean ± standard deviation) paired-end reads per sample, leading
to a per-base genome coverage of 1.3 ± 0.8. We verified that we achieved a high bisulfite
conversion efficiency for all samples (0.996 ± 0.005, Methods). To determine the cell, tissue, and
organ types that contribute cfDNA to the mixture in blood (Methods), we analyzed plasma cfDNA
methylation profiles against a reference set of 147 cell, tissue, and organ types using previously
described bioinformatic approaches (Fig. 1B,C, supplementary data 1, Methods) [25].

We first assayed 52 serial samples collected at short time intervals from five adult patients with
COVID-19 that were treated at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Medical Center
(median of 8 samples per patient [range 6-18]). These plasma samples were residual from clinical
testing and were collected from this group of patients over a treatment time-period of up to 14
days with up to four samples collected within 24 hours (median time between consecutive
collections of 13 hours [range 5-64]). These samples allowed us to study dynamic changes in
cfDNA profiles in patients diagnosed with and treated for COVID-19 (Fig. 2A). Treatments
included standard of care (n=2), remdesivir (n=1), hydroxychloroquine (n=1), or a combination of
remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and tocilizumab (n=1). In addition to plasma from
COVID-19 patients, we performed cfDNA tissues-of-origin profiling for six samples collected from
patients with other respiratory viral infection treated at the same hospital, including influenza B
(n=2), Metapneumovirus (n=1), Coronavirus HKU1 (n=1), Coronavirus NL63 (n=1) and
Respiratory syncytial virus B (n=1) (Fig. 2B).

We plotted the relative abundance of cfDNA derived from different cell, tissue, and organ types
and found that differences in cfDNA profiles between individuals were larger than differences
within individuals over the sampling period. For subjects Z1, Z5, Z6, and Z42 but not Z12, we
observed gradual changes in the tissues-of-origin profiles over sampling periods of six to seven
days. We used the Bray Curtis dissimilarity to quantify the inter and intra-individual differences in
cfDNA profiles (Fig. 2C-D). This analysis confirmed the visual appearance of the tissues-of-origin
profiles in Figure 2A and demonstrated that the largest differences in cfDNA were found for
samples collected from different individuals. Within subjects, smaller differences were observed
for samples collected on the same day (Fig. 2D). Last, the Bray Curtis dissimilarity increased with
time interval between samples for patients Z1, Z5, Z6, and Z42 but not for Z12. Together these
analyses indicate that cfDNA profiles are subject specific, and that changes in cfDNA tissues-ororigin profiles occur gradually over days and not hours, therefore adequate longitudinal data can
be collected every few days.

We next compared the cfDNA tissues-of-origin profiles associated with COVID-19 versus those
associated with respiratory infection with other viruses (Fig. 2E, supplementary table 3). We
found significant increases in the relative proportion of lung specific cfDNA in the blood of COVID19 patients, which was likely related to COVID-19 associated tissue injury (2.5% vs 0.6%, p-value
= 0.019, Wilcoxon). We found a similar association with liver-derived cfDNA (5.0% vs 0.9%, pvalue = 0.025, Wilcoxon), and this was validated by the elevated liver function tests in 4 of 5
COVID-19 patients. Strikingly, we also observed an increase in the relative proportion of cfDNA

vs 17% samples with an erythroblast fraction greater than 0, p-value = 0.003, 2-sample
proportions test, Fig. 2E, supplementary figure 1). Erythroblasts are nucleated cells typically in
the adult bone marrow from which red blood cells develop. The increase in cfDNA derived from
red blood progenitor cells seen here may be an indirect consequence of the hypoxemia and/or
cytokine-mediated anemia that characterize severe COVID-19, or may indicate a more direct
involvement of coronavirus with red blood cell precursors. We note that erythroblast cfDNA was
elevated in a single patient in the control group, who was being treated for recurrent stage IV
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Fig. 2 B,E).

To test the robustness of these initial observations, we assayed an additional 52 samples
collected from 28 patients that were recruited into a randomized control trial at the McGill
University Health Centre in Montreal, Canada. Patients were assigned to either an experimental
antiviral therapy consisting of a combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir (brand name Kaletra) or
to the standard of care. Of these patients, 14 were treated with the Lopinavir/Ritonavir, and 14
were treated with the standard of care. Of the 28 patients, 21 were discharged after treatment,
one patient remains hospitalized as of July 19th, 2020, and six patients died. Serial samples were
collected from these patients at three predetermined time points: days 1, 5, and 15 after
enrollment in the clinical trial, provided they remained hospitalized on the days of collection (Fig.
3A). We determined the relative abundance of tissue-specific cfDNA using the approaches
described above. In addition, we quantified the absolute concentration of tissue-specific cfDNA
by multiplying the proportion of tissue-specific cfDNA with the concentration of total cfDNA
(Methods).

We first compared the cfDNA tissues-of-origin profiles measured for these patients with the
tissues-of-origin profiles for four healthy subjects (Fig. 3B, supplementary figure 2). We found
that 62% of samples from patients with COVID-19 had a higher concentration of lung cfDNA than
the highest concentration measured for a healthy individual (p-value = 0.017, 2-sample
proportions test). In addition, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 had both an elevated relative
and absolute burden of cfDNA derived from the liver (liver fraction 9.1 vs 1.6%, p-value = 0.054,
and 0.051 ng/µL vs 0.00029 ng/µL, p-value = 0.010, Wilcoxon). In addition to these tissue-specific
features, we again observed a significant increase in cfDNA derived from erythroblast cells for
COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (7.7% vs 0%, p-value = 0.027, Wilcoxon; 65%
vs 0% of samples showing erythroblast fraction greater than 0, p-value = 0.0099, 2-sample
proportions test, Fig. 3B). We evaluated the temporal dynamics of the contribution of different cell
and tissue types to the mixture in plasma of COVID-19 patients and observed a slow recovery in
tissue injury and a slow increase in the contribution of cfDNA derived from erythroblasts
(supplementary figure 3).

We then compared cfDNA signatures for COVID-19 patients as function of disease severity, and
found that erythroblast cfDNA proportions at any timepoint are predictive of in-hospital mortality
(19.6% vs 4.1%, p-value = 0.0004, Wilcoxon). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis
of the performance of the relative proportion of Erythroblast derived DNA to predict COVID-19
mortality yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 (95% CI 0.69-0.98, [deceased n = 12;
hospitalized or discharged n = 40]). Additionally, our analysis revealed that kidney cfDNA was
significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients who eventually died (1.8% vs 0.5% vs 0.005%
between deceased, non-deceased and healthy controls, p-value = 0.0018 between deceased and
non-deceased COVID-19 patients).

We then compared the cfDNA tissues-of-origin profiles to the WHO clinical progression scale for
COVID-19 [28] (Fig. 3C). We found a strong association between the total cfDNA concentrations
isolated from plasma and the WHO clinical progression scores (Fig. 3C,D). Notably, a clinical
score of 7 or greater (indicating the need for admission to the intensive care unit and invasive
mechanical ventilation), was associated with a sharp increase in the total burden of cfDNA (Fig.
3C,D, mean 1.5 ng/µL vs 0.16 ng/µL, between clinical scores from 7 to 9 and 4 to 6, respectively;
p-value = 1.5x10-6, Wilcoxon). ROC analysis of cfDNA concentrations to predict ordinal scores
revealed AUCs of 0.89 (95% CI 0.80-0.99), 0.84 (95% CI 0.72-0.97) and 0.56 (95% CI 0.37-0.76)
for total, erythroblast and lung cfDNA, respectively. Furthermore, samples taken from patients
with a clinical score of 9 (use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO]) had significantly
higher erythroblast-derived cfDNA than patients with a clinical score of 7-8 (1.23 ng/µL vs 0.06
ng/µL, p-value = 0.006, Wilcoxon). Patients on ECMO tend to bleed and require additional blood
volumes, which may contribute to the increased erythroblast signal. However, erythroblastderived cfDNA was significantly increased in patients with a clinical score of 7 or higher as well
(Fig. 3C,D, mean 0.43 ng/µL vs 0.003 ng/µL, p-value = 1.83x10-5, Wilcoxon).

Erythroblast and liver cfDNA contributions correlated with clinical metrics for anemia and liver
damage, respectively (Fig3. E-G). We observed significant negative correlations between the
proportion of erythroblast cfDNA and hematocrit and hemoglobin (Pearson’s R (R) = -0.51,
Spearman’s r (r) = -0.37 and R = -0.52, r = -0.49, respectively). Similarly, we found positive
correlations between the proportion of liver-derived cfDNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
and aspartate transaminase (R = 0.63, r = 0.47 and R = 0.76, r = 0.24, respectively). We did not
observe a correlation between kidney-derived cfDNA and serum creatinine (R = 0.05, r = 0.09).
We found similar results when comparing the tissue-derived cfDNA concentration to these clinical
markers (erythroblast cfDNA concentration vs hematocrit and hemoglobin: R = -0.42, r = -0.32
and R = -0.38, r = -0.45, respectively. Liver cfDNA concentration vs ALT and AST: R = 0.84, r =
0.52 and R = 0.20, r = 0.23, respectively. Kidney cfDNA concentration vs creatinine: R = 0.56, r
= 0.20).

Recent papers from Yan et al. and Zhou et al. identified lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as a strong
predictor of COVID-19 outcome [29], [30]. LDH is found in virtually all cells and is a commonly
used biomarker for tissue damage and hemolysis [31]–[33]. We found significant correlation
between LDH and the proportion of erythroblast-derived cfDNA (R = 0.64, r = 0.65), and between
LDH and total cfDNA (R = 0.67, r = 0.76). Together, these data suggest that cfDNA tissues-oforigin can be applied to resolve the specific tissues contributing to non-specific detection of LDH
in blood.

Finally, we found no differences between lung, liver, kidney or erythroblast-derived cfDNA for
patients receiving standard of care, or the experimental lopinavir/ritonavir treatment
(supplementary figure 4). These data are in line with the results of recent clinical trials that
treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir is not significantly different from standard of care treatment for
COVID-19 [34], [35].

We find significant support for the utility of cfDNA profiling as a prognostic tool for the early
detection and monitoring of cell and tissue injury associated with COVID-19. A minimally invasive
molecular blood test that can inform cell, tissue and organ specific injury due to COVID-19 has
the potential to alleviate the impact of the COVID crisis i) by providing quantifiable prognostic
parameters and a more granular assessment of clinical severity at the time of presentation; and

In line with the diverse clinical manifestations of COVID-19, we find evidence for lung, liver and
kidney injury in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. While lung-derived cfDNA was elevated in
COVID-19 patients, we did not find it to be a major contributor to plasma cfDNA. The level of lung
specific cfDNA in plasma was similar to the levels observed in lung transplant patients that suffer
acute lung transplant rejection [20] and lung cancer patients [36], [37]. We observed a striking
correlation between the total abundance of circulating cfDNA in plasma and the WHO ordinal
scale for disease progression. We propose that the total abundance of cfDNA, which can be
measured within one hour at a low cost, can be used in the context of clinical trials and patient
management in the near term.

In addition to the practical application of cfDNA profiling to patient monitoring and COVID-19 risk
stratification, the cfDNA methylation assay and data reported may help elucidate aspects of
COVID-19 pathogenesis. The most significant cfDNA signature observed in the two cohorts
relative to controls was an increase in cfDNA derived from erythroid or red blood progenitor cells.
Given that cfDNA is estimated to have a half-life of about 1 hour [38] and that the proportion of
the erythroid lineage was relatively stable over several days, the elevated erythroid cfDNA is likely
due to a continuous increased erythroid turnover. In support of elevated erythroid turnover and
production, two recent studies have identified red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a measure
of the variation in size of red blood cells (RBCs), as an important prognostic predictor for severe
COVID-19 [15], [16]. The increased RDW was speculated to be associated with increased
turnover of RBCs since increased reticulocytes or newly formed RBCs have a wider diameter
[16]. However, our analysis demonstrated that there was no association with RDW and patient
outcomes (mean 15.4 vs 14.0 between deceased and discharged or hospitalized, p-value = 0.2,
Wilcoxon) and that erythroblast cfDNA was not strongly correlated with RDW (R = 0.26, r = 0.13
[with data from UCSF and MUHC]).

Increased erythroid turnover may be due to erythroid destruction as the primary driver, followed
by compensatory production, and is supported by anemia (Hgb <13.5 g/dL for men and Hgb < 12
for women) found in 26 of 33 COVID-19 patients across both studies. Possible mechanisms
include: i) excessive inflammation and cytokine storm [39], [40], ii) hemophagocytosis in relation
to inflammation [41], and iii) consumption in microthrombi [6]–[8], [10]. We note that 18 of 33
patients in all studies, C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated (> 10 mg/L). It is notable however
that megakaryocytes proportions were not increased in either cohort and would not support
microthrombi as the predominant reason for increased erythroid turnover. Alternatively, past work
has shown that angiotensin II regulates normal erythropoiesis and stimulates early erythroid
proliferation through unclear downstream mechanisms [42]–[44]. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to
the host ACE2 may dysregulate erythropoiesis through the downstream angiotensin II pathway.
The significant increase in cfDNA derived from red blood progenitor cells, may alternatively be
due to injury to red cell precursors [45], through direct or indirect processes. These hypotheses
are further testable through various routes, including comprehensive evaluation of erythrocytosis
in patients with COVID-19, for example through evaluation of circulating reticulocytes and
evaluation of the bone marrow; these measures were not systematically in place during the initial
rapid wave of the pandemic and were not implemented in this study.

This study has several limitations. First, we assayed samples from only hospitalized patients, and
we have not evaluated cfDNA profiles for mild COVID-19 cases. Second, while this study spans
two independent cohorts, with patient groups that are genetically and geographically unrelated,
the overall sample size and patient numbers may not be sufficient to generalize our findings to

provide immediate insights into the dynamics and pathogenesis of COVID-19. Last, the resolution
of our measurements is limited by the availability of isolated cells and tissue methylation patterns.
Our current reference dataset does not include all known human cell types and tissue types.
Therefore, we are not sensitive to those rarer tissues that may play a role in the pathogenesis of
COVID-19. More comprehensive investigations are therefore needed to confirm and further refine
the observations reported here.

In summary, we report the application of cfDNA profiling to quantify cellular and tissue specific
injury due to COVID-19.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
High frequency sampling. Clinical samples from UCSF were processed through protocols
approved by the UCSF Institutional Review Board (protocol number 10-00476, 18-25287).
Residual plasma was collected as part of routine clinical testing and stored at 4 °C for up to 5
days and subsequently stored at -80 °C until batched extraction. Plasma was initially isolated from
blood by the clinical laboratory after centrifugation at approximately 800g for 10 minutes. After
storage, the plasma was centrifuged at 16,000g for 10 minutes. cfDNA extraction was performed
according to manufacturer recommendations (Qiagen MinElute Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit,
reference #55204 or Qiagen EZ1 Virus Mini Kit v2.0 955134) at 0.4-1 mL plasma input.
Randomized clinical trial. Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 were recruited to a randomized,
controlled clinical trial at the McGill University Health Center, where they received either
Lopinavir/ritonavir, or standard-of-care (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04330690). Blood
samples were collected under MUHC Research Ethics Board protocol 10-256 through standard
venipuncture in standard blood collection tubes and immediately centrifuged at 850g for 10
minutes. The supernatant is then transferred to new tubes, and centrifuged at 16,000g for 10
minutes. Plasma-containing supernatant is collected and stored in DNA cryostorage vials
(Eppendorf, reference #0030079400) at -80 °C. Plasma was shipped overnight on dry ice from
the McGill University Health Center (Montreal, Canada) to Cornell University (Ithaca, UnitedStates). Plasma was stored at -80 °C until used for cfDNA extraction. cfDNA extraction was
performed according to manufacturer recommendations (Qiagen Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit,
reference #55114).
Healthy controls. Volunteers were recruited for blood donations through a protocol approved by
the Cornell Institutional Review Board (protocol number 1910009101). Blood was collected in K2
EDTA tubes (BD, reference #366643) and immediately centrifuged at 1600g for 10 minutes. The
supernatant was transferred to new tubes, and centrifuged at 16,000g for 10 minutes.
Supernatant is then stored in DNA cryostorage vials (Thermo Scientific #363401) at -80 °C until
cfDNA extraction. cfDNA extraction was performed according to manufacturer recommendations
(Qiagen Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit, reference #55114).
Whole genome bisulfite sequencing. Bisulfite treatment of DNA converts cytosine residues to
uracil but leaves methylated cytosines unaffected [46]. DNA sequencing of bisulfite-treated cfDNA
can be used to reveal methylation patterns with single nucleotide resolution. Because these
patterns are cell, tissue, and organ types specific, they can inform the origins of cfDNA. Following
treatment with bisulfite, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) libraries were prepared according to
manufacturer’s protocols (Zymo EZ Methylation-Gold kit, #D5005 and Swift Biosciences AccelNGS Methyl-Seq DNA Library Kit #30024) using a dual indexing barcode strategy (Swift

biosciences #38096, NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina E7500L, or custom primers). Pairedend DNA sequencing was performed on the Illumina NextSeq 500 (2x75bp) at Cornell University
or the Illumina NovaSeq (2x150bp) at University of California San Francisco. Resulting pairedend fastq files were trimmed to 75bp for downstream analysis.
Human genome alignment. Adapter sequences were trimmed using BBDUK (BBTools software
suite [47]). Resulting sequences were aligned to the human genome (version hg19) and
deduplicated using Bismark [48]. Alignment files were filtered with a minimum mapping quality of
10 using SAMtools [49].
Reference methylomes and tissues of origin. Reference methylation profiles were obtained
from publicly available datasets and international epigenetic consortium projects (supplementary
data 1) and processed as previously described [25]. Briefly, files were downloaded and
normalized to a standard 4 column BED format at single nucleotide resolution using hg19
coordinates. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were found using Metilene [50].
Methylation densities within these DMRs were averaged. Tissues with methylation profiles highly
dissimilar from the same tissues were removed. cfDNA methylation densities were extracted
using Bismark [48] and averaged over the DMRs. Tissues of origin were deconvoluted using a
non-negative least squares approach.
cfDNA concentration measurement - MUHC patients. Plasma samples were processed in
batches of 4 to 10 alongside a control containing 8 µL of approximately 150 ng/µL of synthetic
oligos. DNA concentration measurements were performed after cfDNA extraction (Qubit
Fluorometer 3.0) and the normalized concentration was calculated by multiplying the sample’s
concentration by the input/output ratio of the control.
Depth of coverage. The depth of DNA sequencing coverage was calculated by dividing the
number of mapped nucleotides to the autosomal chromosomes to the size of the non-N hg19
autosomal genome.
Bisulfite conversion efficiency. The bisulfite conversion efficiency achieved in experiments was
estimated using MethPipe [51] by calculating the reported methylation density of cytosines
present at C[A/T/G] dinucleotides, which are rarely methylated in mammalian genomes.
Quality control filtering. Samples from the high frequency sampling cohort were selected for
analysis if 10 or more spike-in molecules were identified after sequencing and were also filtered
for sufficient depth of sequencing (>0.2x human genome). Samples from the randomized control
trial cohort were sequenced to a minimum depth of 0.7x human genome coverage. All samples
had a minimum bisulfite conversion efficiency of 96%.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were performed in R, version 3.5.0. Groups were
compared using the two-sided, nonparametric Wilcoxon test. If the data distributions were zeroskewed, a two-sided, 2-sample proportions test without continuity correction was performed.
Boxplots span from the 25th and 75th percentiles. The band in the box indicates the median,
lower and higher whiskers extend to the smallest and largest values at most 1.5× IQR of the
hinge, respectively.
Data availability.
Genomic data will be hosted on the Sequence Read Archive. The code used to generate figures
and analyze primary data is available at www.github.com/alexpcheng/cfDNAme.

FIGURE CAPTIONS

Figure 1. Study design. A) Two independent cohorts were used in our study: First, a high
frequency collection cohort with 5 SARS-CoV-2 patients (n = 52 samples) and 6 SARS-CoV-2
negative, RNA-virus positive patients (n = 6 samples). Second, a randomized control trial of 28
SARS-CoV-2 patients with plasma at serial time points (n = 52 samples). 4 healthy individuals
volunteered plasma for cell-free DNA analysis. B) Experimental workflow. cfDNA is extracted from
plasma and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing is performed. In parallel, methylation profiles of
cell and tissue genomes are obtained from publicly-available databases. cfDNA methylation
profiles are compared to those of cell and tissue references to infer relative contributions of tissues
to the cfDNA mixtures. C) UMAP of differentially methylated regions for isolated cell and tissue
types used as a reference.
