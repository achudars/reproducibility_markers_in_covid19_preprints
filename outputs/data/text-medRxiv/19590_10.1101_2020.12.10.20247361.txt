summary
Understanding the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions as well as accounting for the unascertained cases remain critical challenges for epidemiological models for understanding the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 spread.
In this paper, we propose a new epidemiological model (eSEIRD) that extends
the widely used epidemiological models such as extended Susceptible-InfectedRemoved model (eSIR) and SAPHIRE (initially developed and used for analyzing data from Wuhan). We fit these models to the daily ascertained infected
(and removed) cases from March 15, 2020 to Dec 31, 2020 in South Africa that
reported the largest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths from the
WHO African region. Using the eSEIRD model, the COVID-19 transmission
dynamics in South Africa was characterized by the estimated basic reproduction number (R0 ) starting at 3.22 (95%CrI: [3.19, 3.23]) then dropping below 2
following a mandatory lockdown implementation and subsequently increasing to
3.27 (95%CrI: [3.27, 3.27]) by the end of 2020. The initial decrease of effective
reproduction number followed by an increase suggest the effectiveness of early interventions and the combined effect of relaxing strict interventions and emergence
of a new coronavirus variant in South Africa. The low estimated ascertainment
rate was found to vary from 1.65% to 9.17% across models and time periods. The
overall infection fatality ratio (IFR) was estimated as 0.06% (95%CrI: [0.04%,
0.22%]) accounting for unascertained cases and deaths while the reported case
fatality ratio was 2.88% (95% CrI: [2.45%, 6.01%]). The models predict that
from December 31, 2020, to April 1, 2021, the predicted cumulative number of
infected would reach roughly 70% of total population in South Africa. Besides
providing insights on the COVID-19 dynamics in South Africa, we develop powerful forecasting tools that enable estimation of ascertainment rates and IFR while
quantifying the effect of intervention measures on COVID-19 spread.

Introduction

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first detected in early December 2019 in Wuhan, China
and then quickly spread to majority countries worldwide. At the end of January 2021, over
a hundred million people worldwide have been diagnosed with COVID-19 [30], yet the true
number of infections in the population remains underestimated, owing to a combination
of selection bias from unascertained cases and lack of access to tests early on during the
pandemic.
South Africa: Consider the transmission dynamics we have observed so far in South Africa,
the ‘epicenter of the outbreak in the African continent’ [29]. The first case was confirmed
in South Africa on March 5, 2020. As of February 23, 2021, there are 1,504,588 confirmed
cases of COVID-19 (cumulative total) with 49,150 deaths confirmed in Africa [30]. South
Africa remains the worst-hit African country with the largest number of confirmed cases
and deaths, by the end of 2020, contributing to 54% of the total confirmed cases and 44%
of deaths in the WHO African region, while accounting for only 5% of population [26]. A
seroprevalence survey on 4,858 blood donors in South Africa estimated the prevalence of
mid January 2021 by province as 63% in the Eastern Cape, 52% in the KwaZulu Natal,
46% in the Free State and 32% in the Northern Cape [38] while the the number of reported
cases is 1.83% of the total population at the same time, implying the possibility of a large
degree of under-reporting/undetected cases in South Africa. Thus, understanding the key
epidemiological constructs for COVID-19 outbreak is paramount for containing the spread
of COVID-19 in South Africa, as well as explaining the disparity between seroprevalence
estimates and reported number of cases. Two critical factors emerge from analyzing the
majority of available evidence of the public health crisis: (1) the unascertained cases and
deaths and (2) the role of non-pharmaceutical interventions.
Unascertained cases and deaths: Based on the clinical characteristics of COVID-19,
a majority of patients are symptomatic (roughly 84% according to a recent study [16]),
most of whom have mild symptoms [29] and tend to not seek testing and medical care.
While private hospitals have reached maximum capacity, public and field hospitals beds
have still some margin left with additional challenges due to scarcity of staff [9]. Several
recent studies [15, 32, 4] reported that a non-negligible proportion of unascertained cases
contributed to the quick spreading of COVID-19. It is suggested that only 1 in 4 mildly
ill cases would be detected in South Africa [8]. The relatively lower testing rate in South
Africa (Table 1; Figure 1) coupled with a very high test positivity rate especially in July and
August [18], suggests inadequacy of testing, as well as the possibility of a large unobserved
number of unascertained cases [27]. Thus, modeling both ascertained and unascertained
cases and deaths can measure infection fatality ratios (IFRs, the proportion of deaths among
all infected individuals [28]) of COVID-19, leading to a better understanding of the clinical
severity of the disease.
Interventions: With a universal goal to ‘flatten the curve’, a series of non-pharmaceutical
interventions were implemented by the government in South Africa, that have been gradually

lifted since early May 2020 [25]. On March 27, 2020, South Africa adopted a three-week
nationwide hard-lockdown (level 5) along with closure of its international borders, which
was extended to April 30, 2020. Thereafter, to balance the positive health effects of strict
interventions against their economic costs [1], South Africa began a gradual and phased
recovery of economic activities with the lockdown restriction eased to level 4 [25], allowing
inter-provincial travel only for essential services. From June 1, national restrictions were
lowered to level 3 allowing for inter-provincial travel and school opening and eased to level
2 and level 1 from August 18 and September 21, 2020 (Table 1). Face-mask wearing was
mandatory in public places at all times, with limitations on gatherings, and sale of alcohol
and cigarettes were restricted [12]. Although these interventions implemented at an early
stage had a higher potential for pandemic containment, previous studies [12, 24, 42] reported
a consistently large value for the estimated basic reproduction number (R0 ) ranging from
2.2 to 3.2 in South Africa by models trained with data in relatively early time windows.
Using data observed under various intervention scenarios over a longer period of time, we
carry out a thorough investigation to assess the current COVID-19 spread and the effect
of these interventions, which will provide valuable insights into the transition dynamics of
COVID-19 and intervention deployment in South Africa, and beyond.
Epidemiological models: Since the early days of the pandemic, researchers have responded to the unprecedented public health crisis by providing forecasts and alternative
scenarios to inform decision-making, both locally and globally. This has resulted in hundreds of mathematical models of varying complexity. The Susceptible-Infectious-Removed
or SIR model [20] is arguably the most commonly used epidemiological models for modeling
the trajectory of an infectious disease. A recent extension of SIR, called extended-SIR or
eSIR [35], was developed to incorporate user-specified non-pharmaceutical interventions and
quarantine protocols into a Bayesian hierarchical Beta-Dirichlet state-space model, which
was successfully applied to model COVID-19 dynamics in India [33]. One major advantage
of this Bayesian hierarchical structure is that uncertainty associated with all parameters and

functions of parameters can be calculated from posterior draws without relying on largesample approximations [33]. Extending the simple compartment structure in eSIR model,
the SAPHIRE model [40] delineated the full transmission COVID-19 dynamics in Wuhan,
China with additional compartments by introducing unobserved categories [15].
In this article, we extended the eSIR approach to the eSEIRD model to combine the
advantages of the two existing models, using a Bayesian hierarchical structure to introduce
additional unobserved compartments and characterize uncertainty in critical epidemiological
parameters including basic reproduction number, ascertainment rate and IFR, with input
data as observed counts for cases, recoveries and deaths. Furthermore, we applied these
three models and compared the results of the eSEIRD model with two of the existing alter4

natives, namely the eSIR and the SAPHIRE model, with the following primary objectives:
(i) characterizing the COVID-19 dynamics from March 15 to December 31, 2020 – under
different time-varying intervention scenarios; (ii) evaluating the effectiveness of the main
non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdown, and mandatory wearing of face-mask
in public places; (iii) capturing the uncertainty in estimating the ascertainment rate and
IFR; and (iv) forecasting the future of COVID-19 spread in South Africa.
The organization of this paper is as follows: we describe the two competing epidemiological models and our proposed extension in §2. The study design and parameter settings for
modeling COVID-19 transmission in South Africa are described in §3, and the results and
their possible implications are described in §4. We conclude with a discussion of nuances
and limitation of the methods and sources of data used here and suggest future directions
in §5.

Statistical Methodology

We propose an extension of the eSIR model, called eSEIRD, and compare it against two existing epidemiological methods, the eSIR and SAPHIRE model. In this section, we describe
the dynamic systems and the hierarchical models underlying these three epidemiological
models. The schematic diagrams for the three compartmental models are shown in Fig. 2
(eSIR and SAPHIRE) and Fig 3 (eSEIRD).

2.1

eSIR model

The eSIR model assumes the true underlying probabilities of the three compartments susceptible (S), infectious (I) and removed (R) follow a latent Markov transition process and
require observed daily proportions of cumulative infected and removed cases as input [31, 35].
The observed proportions of infected and removed cases on day t are denoted by YtI /N and
YtR /N (the infected and removed counts YtI and YtR divided by total population size N )
respectively. Further, we denote the true underlying probabilities of the three compartments
on day t by θtS , θtI and θtR , respectively, and assume that for any t, θtS + θtI + θtR = 1. The
following set of differential equations describe the dynamic system for the usual SIR model
on the true proportions.

system, using a fourth order Runge-Kutta (RK4) approximation (see supplementary §S.3

2.2

SAPHIRE model

The SAPHIRE model [15] is an extension of the basic SIR model with additional compartments to allow for unobserved categories such as ascertained, unascertained and hospitalized
population. Specifically, in a SAPHIRE model the population is compartmentalized into susceptible (S), exposed (E), presymptomatic infectious (P), ascertained infectious (I), unascertained infectious (A), isolation in hospital (H) and removed (R). Denoting the true underlying accounts of the S, E, P, A, I, H and R compartments on day t by St , Et , Pt , At , It , Ht
and Rt , respectively, the dynamics of these compartments across time t were described by
the following set of differential equations (see Fig. 2(b) for a schematic representation):

als experienced symptom onset on day t, YtI , were assumed to follow a Poisson distribution:
YtI ∼ Poisson(λIt = rPt−1 /Dp ),
where Pt−1 denotes the underlying number of pre-symptomatic individuals and r denotes
the ascertained rate. For an observation window spanning t = 1 to t = T , the sampling

after plugging τ 2 = (XT0 , α, De , Dp , Dq , Di , Dh ) and Xt = (St , Et , Pt , At , It , Ht , Rt ). Here,
Xt denotes the vector of the underlying population counts of the compartments at time
t. With the initial values for the compartments X0 set at pre-fixed values, the pseudolikelihood function in (2.1) can be approximated as a function of the parameters of interest,
i.e. β and r, by the following steps:
Step 0 The transition parameters τ2 = (X0T , α, De , Di , Dh , Dq ) and the initial values for
the compartments X0 = (S0 , E0 , P0 , A0 , I0 , H0 , R0 ) are fixed;
Step 1 Use the differential equations to generate the change of each compartment at time
t = 1, i.e. dXt /dt = (dSt /dt, dEt /dt, dPt /dt, dAt /dt, dIt /dt, dHt /dt, dRt /dt);
dXt−1
Step 2 Compute the state values of each compartment at time t = 1: Xt = X(t−1) + d(t−1)
, and the expected new ascertained cases λIt on day t;

Step 3 Repeat the step 1-3 for t = 2, 3, 4, . . . , T .
For the SAPHIRE model, the MCMC algorithm is implemented with the delayed rejection adaptive metropolis algorithm implemented in the R package BayesianTools (version
0.1.7) to collect posterior samples of the underlying parameters r and β, then calculate the
derived quantities the effective reproduction number Re based on the posterior draws. We
refer the reader to [15] for more details.

2.3

eSEIRD model

Similar to the hierarchical structure used in eSIR model, this eSEIRD model (vide Fig. 3)
works by assuming that the true underlying probabilities of the 7 compartments follow a
latent Markov transition process which fits not only the count of daily infected, but also the
recovered and death counts.
The dynamics of these 7 compartments across time t were described by the following set
of ordinary differential equations:

University [39] from the onset of the first 50 confirmed case (March 15, 2020) to February
21, 2021. We fitted the models using data up to December 31, 2020 and predicted the state
of COVID-19 infection in South Africa in a time window, from January 1 to April 1, 2021.
To compare the model prediction performance of different models, we used the symmetric
mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE), given by:
n

SM AP E =

100% X |Ft − At |
,
n t=1 (|At | + |Ft |)/2

where At is the observed value and Ft is the forecast value in the same time period. This
design enabled us to select an optimal modeling strategy for South Africa data and check
the robustness of prediction performance across different models.
3.1.1

Prior Specification

We describe the prior choices and where appropriate, initial values for the model hyperparameters in this section and a complete summary and list of notations and assumptions are
available in Supplementary Table S.1.1. To begin with, we assumed a constant population
size (N = 57, 779, 622) for all models and fixed a few transition parameters below in the
SAPHIRE and eSEIRD model. First, we set an equal number of daily inbound and outbound
travelers (n), in which n = 4 × 10−4 N from March 15 to 25, 2020 estimated by the
number of international travelers to South Africa in 2018[3], otherwise n = 0 when border
closed, i.e. after March 26. We fixed the transmissibility ratio between unascertained and
ascertained cases at α = 0.55 assuming lower transmissibility for unascertained cases [2], an
incubation period of 5.2 days, and a pre-symptomatic infectious period of Dp = 2.3 days
[23, 17], implying a latent period of De = 2.9 days. The mean of total infectious period was
Di + Dp = 5.2 days [23], assuming constant infectiousness across the pre-symptomatic and
symptomatic phases of ascertained cases [22], thus, the mean symptomatic infectious period
was Di = 2.9 days. We set the period of ascertained cases from reporting to hospitalization
Dq = 7 days, the same as the median interval from symptom onset to admission reported
[10, 13]. The period from being admitted in hospital to discharge or death was assumed
as Dh = 8.6 days [41]. We fit the SAPHIRE and eSEIRD model in six time periods
of 2020: March 15-March 26, March 27- April 30, May 1- May 31, June 1- August 17,
August 18-September 20, and September 21-December 31, separated by the change-points
of the lockdown strictness level, and denote the ascertained rate and transmission rate
in the time periods as r1 , r2 , r3 , r4 , r5 ,r6 , β1 , β2 , β3 , β4 , β5 and β6 . In addition, we
denote the IFR for non-hospitalized cases κ11 , κ12 , κ13 , κ14 , κ15 , κ16 and for hospitalized
cases κ21 , κ22 , κ23 , κ24 , κ25 , κ26 in eSEIRD model.
Choice of Initial states: For the eSIR model, the prior mean for the initial infected/removed proportion was set at the observed infected/removed proportion on March
15, 2020, and that for the susceptible proportion was the total number of the population
minus the infected and removed proportions [35]. For the SAPHIRE model, other than
setting prior parameters for initial states, we set the number of initial latent cases E(0) was

the sum of those ascertained and unascertained cases with onset during March 15-17, 2020
as De = 2.9 days [15] and the number of initial pre-symptomatic cases P (0) was that from
March 18-19, 2020 as Dp = 2.3 days [15]. The number of ascertained symptomatic cases
I(0) was assumed as the number of observed infected cases on March 15, 2020 excluding
H(0), R(0) and D(0) (the initial numbers for hospitalized, recovered, and deaths). The
initial ascertainment rate (r0 ) was assumed as 0.10 as reported in literature [4, 6], implying
A(0) = 0.90/0.10I(0), and a sensitivity analysis with r0 = 0.25 was conducted to address
weak information for r0 obtained in South Africa and variation of r0 in different scenarios. H(0) was assumed as 50% of the observed ascertained cases on March 9, 2020 (by
assuming the period from reported to hospitalized was 7 days [10, 13] at the early stage of
the pandemic). In addition, we denoted R(0) as the sum of observed recovered and death
cases on March 15. The number of initial susceptible cases S(0) was calculated as the total
population (N ) minus E(0), P (0), I(0), A(0) and R(0).
In the eSEIRD model, we set the prior mean of initial ascertained, unascertained and
hospitalized cases as I(0), A(0) and H(0) discussed above. However, since the latent compartment incorporates the pre-symptomatic cases, the mean of the initial latent cases was
set as the sum of those ascertained and unascertained cases with onset during March 1519, 2020 as De + Dp = 5.2 days [15].The prior mean of initial recoveries and deaths were
fixed as the number of observed recovered and death cases on March 15, 2020, respectively.
Therefore, the prior mean of initial susceptible compartment was set as the total population
excluding the mean of other compartments.
Prior distributions: In the eSIR model, the log-normal priors were used for the removed
rate ν and the basic reproduction number R0 , in particular ν ∼ LogN (2.955, 0.910),with
E(ν) = 0.082 and SD(ν) = 0.1 [35], and R0 (= β/ν) ∼ LogN (0.582, 0.223) with E(R0 ) = 3.2
and SD(R0 ) = 1 [33]. Flat Gamma priors were used for the scale parameters of the BetaDirichlet distributions as follows [33]:
ω ∼ Gamma(2, 0.0001), λI ∼ Gamma(2, 0.0001), and λR ∼ Gamma(2, 0.0001)
In the eSEIRD model, for the six time periods, all the transmission rates β1 , β2 , β3 ,
β4 , β5 and β6 were given a U(0, 2) prior, ascertained rates r1 , r2 , r3 , r4 , r5 and r6 were
given Beta(10, 90) prior [21], the IFR for non-hospitalized cases κ11 , κ12 , κ13 , κ14 , κ15 , κ16 ∼
Beta(0.03, 2.93) and for hospitalized cases κ21 , κ22 , κ23 , κ24 , κ25 , κ26 ∼ Beta(0.44, 1.76) with
mean equal to 0.1% and 20% , respectively [41].
In addition, to account for the effect of time-varying contact rate during the prediction
period, we set a time-varying contact rate modifier π(t) in the eSIR and eSEIRD model
where t from January 1 to April 1, 2021: π(t) was set as 0.75 since the lockdown was tuned
to level 3 after December 28, 2020. Note that the modifier π(t) is a conjectural quantity
and hence must be guided by empirical studies [33]. Using MCMC sampling method for the
eSIR and eSEIRD model, we set the adaptation number to be 104 , thinned by 10 draws to
reduce auto-correlation, and set a burn-in period of 5 × 104 draws under 105 iterations for
4 parallel chains.

We fit the SAPHIRE model in six time periods as in the eSEIRD model. We used
r1 ∼ Beta(10, 90) and reparameterized r2 , r3 , r4 , r5 , and r6 by

logit (ri ) = logit (ri−1 ) + δi−1 , i = 2, . . . , 6,
where logit(r) = log(r/(1−r)), and δi ∼ N (0, 1), for i = 1, . . . , 5. We use non-informative
prior distributions for transmission rates βi ∼ U(0, 2) for i = 1, . . . , 6 to reflect lack of
information about these hyperparameters [15]. Therefore, β and r were assumed to follow
different distributions for these six time periods. Finally, the effective reproduction number
can be derived to be:


r
Re = β αDp + α(1 − r)Di +

(1/Di + 1/Dq )
We set a burn-in period of 105 iterations and continued to run 105 iterations with a sampling
step size of 10 iterations for the MCMC algorithm of the SAPHIRE model.
A comparison between assumptions of the three models in the Supplementary §S.2. All
analyses were conducted in R (version 4.0.0), and source codes are available at https:

95% credible interval (95% CrI) were reported for the parameters of interests.

Results

Here we present the detailed results for South Africa, subdivided into estimation of key epidemiological parameters, short-term and long-term forecasts, and finally model evaluation
in terms prediction and quality of fit.

4.1

Reproduction number and intervention evaluation

The estimated posterior mean of R0 was 1.18 (95%CrI: [1.09, 1.28]) in the eSIR model
throughout the training period while in the eSEIRD model, the value of R0 started at 3.22
(95%CrI: [3.19, 3.23]) then dropped though still significantly above 1 after the lockdown
implementation and increased to 3.27 (95%CrI: [3.27, 3.27]) during the last three months of
2020 (Table 2). It suggests that the effective contact rate decreased by more than 50% over
the lockdown time period and attained the lowest point in its trajectory during August to
September, 2020 though the lockdown was eased to a relatively less strict level. On the other
hand, the effective reproduction number (Re ) in different lockdown periods estimated by
the SAPHIRE model demonstrates that a similar trend but the magnitude of the estimated
Re decreased dramatically when r0 increases from 0.10 to 0.25 (Table 2; Fig. 4), possibly
suggesting lack of robustness with respect to the choice of initial r0 .

4.2

Short-term and long-term forecasts

We forecast the total cumulative number of infections, including unascertained cases, in
the SAPHIRE model up to February 28, 2021 depending on the time-period considered for
estimating the trend. The estimated cumulative number of infections are: (a) 43.3 million if
the trend of the least strict lockdown (level 1) was assumed, (b) 36.9-37.8 million if the trend
of the lockdown level 2-4 was assumed, and (c) 29.3 million if the trend of strict lockdown
was assumed (r0 = 0.10). However, the short-term forecasts in SAPHIRE model exhibits
lack of robustness under different r0 settings, for example, when r0 = 0.25 the estimated
cumulative number of infections was 10.6 million if the trend of the least strict lockdown
(level 1) was assumed and 0.9 million if the trend of the lockdown level 2 was assumed. In
the eSEIRD model, the predicted total cumulative number of cases reach 41.2 million under
r0 = 0.10, and 41.6 million under r0 = 0.25, along with estimated total deaths counts as 35
or 37 thousand when r0 = 0.10 or 0.25, respectively, by February 28, 2021. Furthermore,
we used the eSEIRD model to forecast the epidemic trajectory for a relatively longer time
period, where we found that by April 1, the cumulative number of total infected and deaths
would reach roughly 41.3 million (which is around 70% of the total population in South
Africa) and 35 thousand, respectively.

4.3

Fitting and prediction performance

All the three candidate models were applied to the COVID-19 data in South Africa with high
accuracy as the estimated daily new cases were close to the observed numbers from March
to October, 2020 (Fig. 4 (a)-(c)). However, the eSEIRD model showed a poorer fit during
the second pandemic wave in South Africa from November to December 2020, compared to
the other two models. The eSIR model performed best in terms of fitting the cumulative
ascertained cases with the smallest SMAPE (2.43% when r0 =0.10) while the SAPHIRE
model had the second smallest training SMAPE (Table 4). In terms of predictive accuracy,
the SAPHIRE model performed best with the smallest SMAPE (4.41% for 15 days and
5.92% for 31 days when r0 =0.10) while the eSIR model had the second smallest SMAPE
(6.90% for 15 days and 10.78% for 31 days when r0 =0.10) (Table 4). We note that for a few
selected important time points, the estimated number of cumulative ascertained infected
cases for the eSEIRD model was closest to the observed on December 31, 2020, while the
predicted number of cases in the eSIR and SAPHIRE model are closer to the observed on
January 31, 2021 (Table 3). The predictive performances for the three competing models
substantiate their credibility in terms of capturing the transmission dynamics for the timeperiod considered in this study.

4.4

Unascertained cases and deaths

As demonstrated by SAPHIRE modeling results in Figure 4 (d), the large number of unascertained and pre-symptomatic cases contributed to the rapid spread of disease.The estimated
ascertained rates were very low, starting at 8.99% (95% CrI: [8.20%, 9.80%]), decreasing

to below 2 during level 5 to level 3 lockdown and then increasing to 15.48% (95% CrI:
[15.24%, 15.73%]) during the second pandemic wave in South Africa, respectively (Table
2; Fig. 4 (f)). Similarly, in the eSEIRD model, the estimated ascertained rates were also
at a very low level (1.65% to 9.17%) and had a similar trend as in SAPHIRE model (vide
Table 2). As mentioned before, the estimated ascertained rates were robust with respect to
choices for r0 in eSEIRD model, but changes drastically in SAPHIRE model with r0 changed
to 0.25: 95.58% (95%CrI: [76.20%, 99.50%]) before lockdown, between 30.18% to 35.93%
during level 5 and 4 lockdown, 95.53% (95%CrI: [81.09%, 99.58%]) in level 3 lockdown, and
then decreasing form 33.23% to 18.80% in level 2 to level 1 lockdown.
By the eSEIRD model, the overall IFR was estimated as 0.06% (95%CrI: [0.04%, 0.22%])
throughout the whole time period taking the reported and unreported cases and deaths into
account while the observed overall case fatality ratio was estimated as 2.88% (95% CrI:
[2.45%, 6.01%]) (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the eSEIRD model provided Bayesian estimates
for IFR and deaths among hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases. The estimated IFR for
hospitalized cases was 15.28% (95%CrI: [0.01%, 69.10%]) before lockdown and increased to
65.86% (95%CrI: [51.00%, 82.91%]) in the first time period of lockdown. After that, the IFR
for hospitalized cases decreased from 22.9% (95%CrI: [20.75%, 25.18%]) to 7.46% (95%CrI:
[7.46%, 7.71%]) during May to September. By the end of 2020, it again increased to 19.25%
(95%CrI: [18.82%, 19.69%]). The IFR of hospitalized cases was much larger than that of
non-hospitalized cases (less than 0.01%),and these estimates were robust to the choice of r0 .

Discussion

In this paper, we propose a new infectious disease forecasting model that incorporates the
unascertained cases, population movement over different time periods, and the effect of
intervention strategies in a unified way and use it to investigate the spread of COVID-19 in
South Africa, the hardest hit country on the African continent. The methodological tools
developed here can be used to estimate the IFR as well as estimate actual COVID-19 deaths
from the reported death counts.
The lockdown intervention and mandatory face-mask wearing in public places employed
in South Africa seemed to contain the spread of COVID-19 effectively as the Re decreased
dramatically initially but increased later following the relaxation of lockdown stringency
afterwards. However, the Re was consistently above 1 throughout the whole period analyzed,
which implies the interventions failed to dampen the transmission fully, further substantiated
by the basic reproduction number estimates in the eSEIRD model as well. This agrees with
the public health experts advice of carefully implemented intervention policies while taking
account their potential economic costs [37].
We also found that the estimated ascertainment rate is very low in South Africa compared
to that reported for many other countries [15, 4, 32], also implied by the low testing rate
and high testing positive rate in South Africa. As of February 21, the number of total
tests conducted is 8.9 million, suggesting that about 15.4% population were tested [18].

Furthermore, the estimated ascertainment rate is consistent with that in other multiple
global epicenters under severe pandemic of COVID-19, such as France, the United States,
Italy and Spain in March [21]. The large number of unascertained cases is likely to contribute
significantly to the continuing spread of COVID-19 [23, 7, 19]. Our findings suggest that
there are around 70% of the total population in South Africa infected by December 31, 2020,

which is roughly consistent with the seroprevalence survey conducted in South Africa that
the estimated prevalence is around 63% in the Eastern Cape, one of the pandemic centers
in South Africa [38]. Despite the potential high prevalence of COVID, the second wave of
pandemic appeared in South Africa and other pandemic centers like Brazil, which may due
to the waning immunity against infection with the time to the first wave increasing, and
the coronavirus lineages might have higher inherent transmissibility than the pre-existing
lineages and be able to evade the immunity generated in response to previous infection
[34]. To prevent potential resurgence in the future, addition to the strict interventions,
more surveillance testing and effective testing strategies under conditions of limited test
availability, such as contact tracing of the contacts and confirmed cases, will be helpful to
curtail the pandemic in South Africa [12].
Although highly transmissible and poorly ascertained, the COVID-19 IFR is estimated
as 0.06% taking account of unreported cases and deaths in South Africa, comparable to the
estimates in other locations with similar low mortality rate based on serological data [19].
The low IFR may be due to the South African population being relatively young which
lessens the fatal impact on general population to some extent [36]. Our estimates of the
IFR of hospitalized cases are much higher than that for non-hospitalized cases, suggesting
that the most severe cases may have been admitted to hospitals despite the relatively lack
of the testing arrangements. The very low estimated IFR for the non-hospitalized cases also
imply that the degree of under-reporting for death by the model is very low (0.24% by April
1, 2021), and likely to be affected by the same factors.
Comparison of the models: The eSIR and the SAPHIRE model have been successfully
applied to the data in India and Wuhan, China, separately [35, 13]. Although SAPHIRE
model exhibits superior prediction performance on COVID-19 cases, the estimates of un17

derlying paratemters and unascertained cases showed lack of robustness to the change of

clinical characteristics. The eSEIRD model also has a good fitting performance but a relatively poor prediction capacity. Table 2 also suggests that the estimates in eSEIRD model
are robust estimated compared to the SAPHIRE model, probably an artifact of the Bayesian
hierarchical model used.
Strengths and Limitations: The key methodological innovation for the proposed method
is revealed by a quick comparison between the schematic diagrams for eSEIRD model (Fig.
3) and SAPHIRE model (Fig. 2(b)). Broadly speaking, eSEIRD incorporates π(t), the

transmission rate modifier as well as splits the ‘removed’ compartment into ‘recovered’ and
‘deaths’ while accounting for separate rates for ascertained, unascertained and hospitalized
cases.
Despite the superior performance and robustness exhibited by the models examined
here, there are some important limitations. First, the model assumptions were elicited
from previous reports from other countries because of the lack of such information for
South Africa, especially the fixed values for hyper-parameters. Though the estimation of
parameters and prediction of infections seem to be robust to these assumptions to some
extent, the inference and prediction would be much more convincing when based on accurate
information specific to South Africa.
Second, the ascertained rate was assumed to follow the same distribution in a long time
period in the eSEIRD model although in reality it might be time-varying depending on the
accumulating knowledge and deployment of clinical resources for COVID-19, given the spatial variation within South Africa regarding the population density and movement, as well
as regarding location of COVID-19 hotspots and hospital resources. Further, the population
density is highly heterogeneous in different regions in South Africa with higher concentration near high-density economic hub cities, such as Cape Town and Durban. COVID-19
cases are also diversely spread. For instant, Gauteng Province is a very small, highly dense
province with roughly 30% of total cases in the nation, and 49% of confirmed cases cluster in
KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Western Cape Province. In addition, the seroprevalence
study also suggested that the prevalence may vary from city to city: 63% in the Eastern
Cape, 52% in the KwaZulu Natal and 32% in the Northern Cape [38]. Without considering
these heterogeneities and potential confounding factors in individual region, the conclusion
on the national data might be biased. The burden of HIV and tuberculosis comorbidity, particularly among the less privileged socio-economic population, also adds to the complexity
of analyzing the COVID-19 data from South Africa [5].
Third, in this paper we implicitly assumed that the recovered cases would not be infected
again but it is still inconclusive based on extant research for COVID-19 [14]. It might
lead to a resurgence if this assumption is not valid and the interventions are totally lifted.
Thus, it might be necessary to conduct more national serological surveys on COVID-19
among the general population in South Africa to confirm the national, as well as provincial,
seroprevalence. Such large-scale studies will also provide more powerful evidence to examine
the evolving benefits of non-pharmaceutical interventions decisions and provide guidance to
manage provincial level disparity.
Finally, from the early stage of this pandemic to now, there has been an explosive development in COVID-19 forecasting models but systematic comparison between the available
models in terms of out-of-sample prediction and inference has been rare (see e.g. [11]) as
are carefully done simulation studies where the ‘ground truth’ is known. Lack of simulation
studies comparing the candidate methods is also a limiting feature of this paper, and we
hope to pursue this in a future endeavor.
