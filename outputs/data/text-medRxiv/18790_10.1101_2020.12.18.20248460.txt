Abstract
Festive gatherings this 2020 holiday season threaten to cause a surge in new cases of novel
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Hospitals and long-term care facilities are key
hotspots for COVID-19 outbreaks, and may be at elevated risk as patients and staff return
from holiday celebrations in the community. Some settings and institutions have proposed
fortified post-holiday testing regimes to mitigate this risk. We use an existing model to
assess whether implementing a single round of post-holiday screening is sufficient to detect
and manage holiday-associated spikes in COVID-19 introductions to the long-term care
setting. We show that while testing early helps to detect cases prior to potential onward
transmission, it likely to miss a substantial share of introductions owing to false negative test
results, which are more probable early in infection. We propose a two-stage post-holiday
testing regime as a means to maximize case detection and mitigate the risk of nosocomial
COVID-19 outbreaks into the start of the new year. Whether all patients and staff should be
screened, or only community-exposed patients, depends on available testing capacity: the
former will be more effective, but also more resource-intensive.
Main
As much of the world gathers to celebrate Christmas and the end of the 2020 calendar year,
there is mounting concern that a holiday-associated surge in novel coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) lies in wait for early 2021. Past experiences in China, Israel and elsewhere have

holidays, which tend to draw individuals from distant places into close contact for prolonged
periods.1,2 Nevertheless, in a compassionate bid to alleviate the pandemic’s psychological
toll, healthcare authorities in some regions will relax their COVID-19 restrictions this holiday
season. In France, for instance, the Ministry of Health announced that nursing homes will
admit visitors and allow residents to return to the community to stay with their families,
provided they undergo RT-PCR or antigenic testing upon their return.3
For healthcare facilities in areas with active community circulation of SARS-CoV-2, postholiday screening regimes seem well-founded. Yet surveillance is challenged by several
factors, including delayed/absent clinical symptoms and imperfect diagnostic sensitivity of
gold-standard RT-PCR tests, which are unlikely to detect SARS-CoV-2 over the first three days
of infection.4 For long-term care residents and healthcare workers returning to their
respective institutions after the holidays, and potentially exposed to the virus all the while, a
simple test upon their return may not suffice.
We adapted an existing COVID-19 surveillance model to evaluate post-holiday screening
regimes in the long-term care setting. Described elsewhere,5 this model uses inter-individual
contact data to reproduce patient-staff interactions in a rehabilitation hospital, and
simulates transmission and clinical progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as active RTPCR testing with time-varying diagnostic sensitivity, peaking at 80% eight days postinfection.4 Here, we made minor adjustments to reflect the current epidemiological context:
(i) baseline immunizing seroprevalence among 20% of patients and staff, and (ii) reinforced
infection control practices (e.g. face masks), reducing per-contact transmission risk by 80%.6
We initialized our model to reflect enhanced community SARS-CoV-2 acquisition risk for
100% of staff and 50% of patients over the holidays (Figure 1A). This translated to three
members of staff and one patient returning to the hospital with “holiday-associated” SARSCoV-2 infection at simulation outset, with an on average 5-day age of infection (range 1-8).
An additional 0-3 holiday-associated cases were gradually introduced from the community
over the following week. Ensuing nosocomial outbreaks were simulated for two weeks
(Figure 1B). We evaluated a suite of mass-testing strategies deployed at varying time
intervals over the week following Christmas, under the baseline assumption that individuals
presenting with COVID-19-like symptoms are tested immediately (Figure 1C). For each
strategy, we calculated the proportion of imported cases detected and the cumulative
number of secondary cases averted over two weeks, assuming that infected individuals stop
transmitting once diagnosed, and accounting for a 24-hour delay for RT-PCR test results
(Figure 1B).
We found distinct advantages to different mass-testing schedules. When conducted earlier
(1 day since return from holiday), testing was more likely to detect imported cases prior to
transmission events, thereby preventing a greater share of onward nosocomial spread
(Figure 1E). However, imported cases were more likely to be missed, because not all
introductions were necessarily present on day 1, and because false-negative tests were
overall more likely at earlier time points given the time-varying nature of RT-PCR sensitivity
(Figure 1D). Taken together, multi-day screening regimes were most effective for both
detecting holiday-associated SARS-CoV-2 introductions and preventing onward nosocomial
spread.

Screening everyone present in the hospital was unsurprisingly more effective than screening
only patients or staff, but also more resource-intensive (Figure 1F). Given resource
limitations, testing community-exposed patients was found to avert more cases than testing
only staff. This result may be biased by the characteristics of the hospital we modelled,
which includes more staff than patients and high rates of patient-to-patient contact.7 Rapid
antigen testing may help to alleviate resource limitations, but is less diagnostically sensitive
than RT-PCR, and perhaps more likely to benefit from multi-stage screening to overcome
false-negative results.
After a fraught 2020, many will find solace in reuniting with their loved ones this holiday
season. This may come at the unfortunate cost of energizing the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with
potential to trigger outbreaks in hospitals, nursing homes and other vulnerable settings.
Promising vaccines on the horizon may turn the tide in 2021, but are unlikely to have
substantial epidemiological impact before the new year. In the meantime, with COVID-19
cases at greater numbers worldwide than ever before, healthcare institutions should
consider enhanced post-holiday surveillance regimes to protect their patients and staff from
infection.
