Abstract

28

Objectives: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is spreading

29

rapidly worldwide and threatening the collapse of national health care systems. The

30

development of effective resource models are critical for long term health planning. The aim

31

was to evaluate the available literature, to consider parameters affecting hospital resources,

32

to effectively guide health policy and planning for future waves of infection.

33

Design: A detailed search of the literature, using Google Scholar, PubMED, MedRxiv and

34

BioRxiv, was conducted for the time period 1st Dec 2019 to 31st May 2020; using appropriate

35

keywords: resultant articles were scrutinised in detail, and appraised for reported data

36

pertaining to hospitalization and hospital length of stay (LOS).

37

Results: Disease presentation was described in China; 81 % mild, 14 % moderate and 5 %

38

severe. The experience, thus far, in Europe and the USA are suggestive of a higher degree of

39

severity. Initial reports suggest high hospitalisation and ICU admittance rates. More recent

40

reports from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) lower this

41

estimation. Perhaps the relative age, the level of pre-existing conditions, and other health

42

factors may be contributors to differences. Data from Irish cases suggest hospitalisation rate

43

may be lower in parts of Europe and time dependent. Hospital LOS is described in 55 articles,

44

with median lengths of stay between 3 and 52 days. The evidence regarding the LOS in ICU is

45

reported in 31 studies, 26 deemed relevant. The majority of studies report ICU LOS between

46

7 to 11 days. Many of these studies are likely skewed towards shorter stay due to study cut-

47

off dates. Indications based on ICU LOS reported for patients continuing care suggest median

48

ICU stay will progressively increase.

49

Conclusions: These parameter estimates are key to the development of an effective health

50

care resource model. Based on our appraisal of the literature, is it essential that Europe

51

manages mitigation measures to ensure that hospital and ICU capacity does not become

52

overwhelmed to manage COVID-19 in subsequent infection waves.

Strengths and limitations of this study
•

The study provides timely information on the differences in hospitalisation, length of

58

stay and ICU length of stay due to COVID-19 in a number of countries worldwide at

59

the end of wave one in Europe;

60

•

This rapid review builds on a previously available review paper that reported length

61

of stay in the early phase of the pandemic; many more studies outlining length of

62

stay, and in particular, ICU length of stay, are now available;

63

•

64
65

This rapid review reports on study mortality rate giving an interesting insight into
differences across countries and continents;

•

Limitations associated with any rapid review are pertinent to this study; a narrow

66

aim was set, and the sources of the literature may be limited by the time-limited

67

constraint of gathering relevant literature; and a number of articles available were in

68

pre-print form and only undergoing peer review; and

69

•

This rapid review provides evidence-based estimates of Hospital and ICU length of

70

stay due to COVID-19 infection across a number of countries to steer policy and

71

provide parameter estimates for utilisation within a hospital resource model as

72

preparations are made for subsequent waves of infection.

INTRODUCTION

76

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is spreading rapidly across

77

the world, threatening the collapse of many national health care systems and exerting a

78

grave impact on the global economy. As of 31st May 2020, data compiled from the European

79

Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) [1] reported 6,028,135 confirmed

80

infections of COVID-19 cases worldwide with 368,944 deaths recorded. The SARS-CoV-2

81

virus, first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan China, has spread to 213 countries and

82

territories. By 31st May 2020, European countries, including the European Union (EU-27), the

83

UK, Norway, Switzerland and Iceland have reported 1,429,104 cases and 166,421 deaths

84

following infection with SARS-CoV-2 infection [1]

85
86

Clinical presentations of COVID-19 range from asymptomatic to life threatening and fatal. In

87

China, 81 % of COVID-19 cases were considered mild, 14 % severe and 5 % critical [2,3]. The

88

experience in European countries has differed, and varied among countries. The eighth

89

update report from the ECDC [4] indicates that up to 30 % of diagnosed COVID-19 cases

90

were hospitalised in some countries. Individual studies from Italy [5,6] indicated a higher

91

proportion were accessing intensive care unit (ICU) care, with 16 and 18 % of all COVID-19

92

patients being cared for in an ICU setting. However, the European wide analysis report [4]

93

suggests that 2.4 % of cases presented with severe illness requiring respiratory support or

94

ICU care; the most recent report; the ninth update [7] lowers this estimate (median 2 %).

95
96

Worldwide, age and co-morbidities have been demonstrated as major risk factors for the

97

development of severe disease [3,4,7-14]. Children are implicated as possible asymptomatic

98

carriers of SARS-CoV-2 virus and a number of articles report both symptomatic and

99

asymptomatic infection in children [3,15-20]. Many, but not all [17], studies indicate a higher

100

proportion of cases are male [4,7-9, 21-24]; and recent risk assessments conducted by the

101

ECDC [4,7] indicates that males are at higher risk of death compared with their female

102

contemporaries. Close contact with a case is a risk factor [2], and the basis of public health

103

advice includes social distancing and staying at home apart from essential activity [4]. Other

104

factors, including smoking [25] have been highlighted as risk factors for severe infection.

105

There are indications too that infection rate may be altered by blood-group [21,26].

106
107

The prevention of infection among health care workers is of critical importance to the

108

management of this pandemic. Of serious concern to policymakers is the clear evidence

109

indicating that both healthcare workers and hospitalised persons are at particularly high risk

110

of exposure [2, 27]. Indeed some of the work conducted early in the epidemic reported that

111

hospital-associated transmission of virus was suspected in 41% of patients [28]. Of concern

112

too, many healthcare authorities are bringing retired medics and nurses back into service.

113

The placement of these people considered vulnerable due to their age must be considered.

114

At a national level, the latest work by Stier et al. [29] emphasizes population density, with

115

attack rates increasing with city size.

116
117

Preparedness is key and resource matching to clinical requirement essential. Previous work

118

[30] suggests a large variation in availability of critical care bed in the EU / EEA area, ranging

119

from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal for critical care beds per 100,000 population.

120

Perhaps this is key to understanding the difference in coping between different EU

121

countries. Clearly too, differences will exist between cultures, few western governments will

122

seek to use hospitalisation as a tool for quarantine. An comprehensive review on length of

123

hospital stay in the early part of the pandemic was conducted by Rees et al. [31]. Large

124

variations across studies within China (4 to 53 days) and outside China (4 to 21 days) were

125

reported. However the early studies offered limited evidence for length of ICU stay. Rees et

126

al. [31] reports ICU stay in 8 studies, four within and four outside China, and limited by study

127

subjects so early in the pandemic. Many of the early studies reported hospital length of stay

128

(LOS) for groups with a defined outcome, died or discharged, many too indicated a short

129

follow up time. It is key to consider the influence of those continuing in care. As the infection

130

is spreading across the world, this rapid review paper considers parameters affecting

131

hospital resources resulting from infection with SARS-CoV-2 beyond the evidence published

132

from China. The objective is to evaluate the current scientific literature from across the

133

developed world with the overall aim to influence health policy and support evidence-based

134

decision-making as countries in Europe prepare for a second wave of infection. The

135

proportion of patients hospitalized and their outcomes in terms of mortality rate due to

136

infection with SARS-CoV-2 infection is discussed. The proportion of patients who required

137

critical or ICU care is outlined. Time spent hospitalised, both in a general and an ICU setting,

138

is considered. For those who have been admitted to an ICU, the length of time pre-ICU, the

139

length of time in ICU was collated from available literature. These estimates are central to

140

national resource modelling, which are being developed to aid policymakers to ensure

141

optimal resourcing during subsequent infection waves in this pandemic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

144

Initial study appraisal

145

This paper follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-

146

Analyses—Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist [32]. A comprehensive

147

search of the scientific literature and national and international government reports was

148

conducted by contributing researchers for the time period 1st December 2019 to 20th May

149

2020. The search engines Google Scholar, PubMED, MedRxiv and BioRxiv were used, using

150

the following keywords: (“Novel coronavirus” OR “SARS-CoV-2” OR “2019-nCoV” OR “COVID-

151

19”) AND (“length of stay” OR “duration of stay” OR “hospital stay” OR “ICU”). No restriction

152

on language was imposed as long as the abstract was available in English. References within

153

these publications were also searched as additional possibilities for inclusion. Inclusion

154

criteria for ‘the proportion of cases hospitalised’ were papers that reported the proportion

155

of hospitalised and proportion of those hospitalised accessing higher level care including

156

critical care and ICU care. Inclusion criteria for LOS included articles that reported length of

157

hospital stay, length of stay in ICU, and length of stay prior to admission to ICU. Each article

158

was assessed briefly for suitability for inclusion in this study. Papers that did not report

159

hospitalisation, length or duration of time in hospital or in ICU were discarded. The latest

160

governmental reports from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), Ireland [33],

161

and from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC), UK [24] were

162

consulted after the 30th May cut-off.

163
164

Study appraisal

165

All articles and reports that described the proportion of COVID-19 positive cases

166

hospitalised, the proportion of cases that were admitted to higher level care including

167

critical or ICU care, the length of hospital stay or the duration of hospital stay or length of

168

time in critical care or ICU were scrutinised in detail, and appraised for reported data and

169

quality of the scientific evidence. Parameter estimates for the length of stay in non-ICU or in

170

an ICU setting from the relevant articles were recorded and evaluated.

171
172

For quality control, studies were (1) selected from search terms outlined above and initially

173

screened by three members of the team (KH, SM and LL), with parameters identified and

174

recorded; (2) reviewed and supplemented by manual search by LL, again with parameters

175

identified and recorded, and (3) the review was then internally reviewed by an additional

176

three members of the team (SM, DB, MC), and cross-referenced with other parameter

177

synthesis documents being developed by the group (all authors). Details of the resultant list

178

(n = 263), which included published and pre-printed articles, were entered in an Excel file.

180

Some 55 studies relating to hospital LOS and 31 studies or reports relating to LOS in ICU

181

were selected for detailed scrutiny as they each reported summary estimates with a

182

corresponding variance.

Source data and management

185

Data tabulating the number of notified cases and deaths for all countries and Territories

186

worldwide for each calendar date was downloaded in Excel format from the European

187

Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [1]. Data was imported into STATA version 14

188

(STATA Corporation, USA). Sum of cases and deaths were tabulated for European countries

189

of the EU, the UK, Switzerland, Iceland and Norway (n = 31). Cumulative cases and deaths

190

were generated for each calendar day for countries of interest and expressed as a

191

percentage of cumulative deaths to cumulative cases. The crude mortality rate was

192

expressed as a percentage over time, from day of outbreak, defined as the day on which the

193

tenth case was reported, in selected European Countries.

194
195

Data regarding the epidemiological situation in Ireland was extracted from the Health

196

Protection Surveillance Centre daily epidemiological reports [33]. Data were entered into

197

Excel, then imported into STATA 14 to generate the trends in cumulative cases, percentage

198

of known cases hospitalised and the percentage of confirmed cases admittance into ICU over

199

time.

European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC updates)

225

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) collates the laboratory-

226

confirmed cases reported to the European Surveillance System (TESSy) and thus far has

227

published nine update reports as the situation unfolds across Europe [4,7]. Preliminary

228

estimates of severity were collated based on the analysis of data from EU and EEA countries

229

and from the UK. As expected, some data were incomplete or missing in TESSy. The eight

230

update [4] indicates that 48,755 of 152,375 (32 %) were hospitalised based on data from 26

231

European countries; with a country median 28 % (IQR 14 to 63 %). Severe presentations that

232

required ICU and or respiratory support accounted for 2,859 of 120,788 (2.4 %) cases from

233

16 countries; median 1.4 % (IQR 0 to 33 %). Among hospitalized cases only, severe illness

234

was reported in 3,567 of 38,960 (9.2 %) cases from 19 countries, median 15 % (IQR 3.8 to 35

235

%). Death occurred in 1,005 of 9,368 (11 %) of hospitalized cases from 21 countries (3.9 %,

236

IQR 0 to 13 %). Age-specific risk increased among those 60 years and older, thus

237

consideration to age profile within a country is important. The report of 23rd April [7]

238

reported increased rate of hospitalisation with a pooled estimate of 42 % (160,485 of

239

381,410 cases); based on data from 19 countries, however the country median was 28 %

240

(IQR 16 to 39 %). Severe presentations that required ICU and or respiratory support

241

accounted for 5,456 of 220,412 (2 %) cases with data from 14 countries; median 2 % (IQR 0

242

to 4 %). Again, hospitalisation increased with age, and for males from 30 years. The changes

243

over time in the crude mortality rate for all notified cases since day of outbreak, defined as

244

the day on which the tenth case was notified, for selected European countries is presented

USA Studies

250

Admission rates to ICU in the USA varied between 4.9 to 11.5 % in the report conducted by

251

the CDC [85]. Myers et al. [89] indicated 8.7 % ICU admission in a study conducted in

252

California in March, whereas Lewnard et al. [99] observed a higher ICU admission rate (25.6

253

%) also in California. A number of studies conducted in New York outlined ICU admission

254

rates of 14.2 % [13]; 22 % [14]; 23.6 % [92]; and 36% [11]. Of significance, are the mortality

255

rates in hospitalised groups (and specifically not ICU only groups) reported in a number of US

256

studies: 15.4 % [89]; 15.6 % [85]; 21 % [13]; 21 % [91]; and 29 % [11].

In Ireland, the proportion of COVID-19 test positives cases (confirmed cases) hospitalised is

259

reducing with time (Figure 3). Daily epidemiology reports compiled by the Health Protection

260

Surveillance Centre [79] with data to March 30th reports a hospitalisation rate of 27.9 % (834

261

of 2,990 cases hospitalised) and admission to ICU in 4.2 % of cases (126 of 2,990). The

262

hospitalisation rate reduced over time to 17.5 % (1,968 of 11,261) by April 13th [80]; 13.5 %

263

(2,669 of 9,723) by 29nd April [81]; and 13.1 (2,878 of 21,908 cases by 4th May [82]. The rate

264

of admission to ICU reduced, concomitantly, from 4.2 % of cases (126 of 2,990) [79] to 1.7 %

265

(373 of 21,908) [82] of cases by May 4th. The reports collated by the HPSC [33] in Ireland

266

indicate that proportion of hospitalisations and transfer to ICU increased occurred with age.

case studies were excluded due to small numbers of relevant cases [8,55,57]. Median

285

lengths of stay in ICU between 7 to 10 days were observed in studies based in China

286

[21,35,38,39,44,51]. European studies conducted by Graselli et al. [63] in Italy, Ceruti et al.

287

[75] in Switzerland, and the ICNARC report [24] report similar LOS between 7 to 11 days.

288

Earlier reports from the ICNARC [23] indicated shorter LOS for ICU patients, indicating the

289

bias towards shorter stay as fewer patients had progress through their complete stay.

290

However median LOS outlined by studies based in North America were more variable and

291

reported lengths of stay between 3.8 to 14 days for various resolved groups (Figure 3);

292

however three studies highlight the continuing care groups with extended median ICU stays

293

of 20 [101], 23 [110] and 36 days [96]. The Reyes-Gil et al. [90] study was excluded from

294

consideration as it was suspected that all patients contributed to the ICU LOS, even if not

295

admitted to ICU.

DISCUSSION

317

HOSPITALISATION RATE

318

The relative variation in disease severity is very clear in the published literature from China,

319

with 81 % mild presentation, 14 % moderate presentation with 5 % severe or critical

320

presentations that require high-level on-going care in critical care beds or within the ICU

321

environment [3]. Nevertheless, the experience, thus far, in Europe and the USA would

322

suggest some countries are experiencing a higher degree of severity of COVID-19 being

323

reported. Early indications from Italy suggested hospitalisation rates of 30 % and admission

324

to ICU between 16 to 18 % [5,6]. While the eighth update report from the ECDC [4] restates

325

this but suggests, based on data from 16 EU countries, that respiratory and or ICU support is

326

needed in 2.4 % of cases; the ninth ECDC report [7] slightly revises this country specific

327

median 2 % (IQR 0 to 4 %). Observational studies conducted in the USA also report high rates

328

of hospitalisation [85], high proportion of patients admitted to ICU care and very high

329

mortality rates in hospitalised patients, even among studies with large numbers

330

[11,89,91,91,99,104]. The cause of the differences in disease presentation between

331

countries is not clear. Perhaps differences in case definition, the relative age of the

332

population, the level of pre-existing conditions within the population, and other health

333

factors may be contributing to these differences. Thus far, the experience in Italy suggests

334

that mitigation measures must be carefully managed to ensure ICU capacity is not reached

335

or breached. However, another major influencer on hospitalisation rate will be the definition

336

of a suspect case and the extent of COVID-19 testing within the community; the detection of

337

a greater number of milder cases, diagnosed within the community will ultimately influence

338

the hospitalisation rate. The influence of community testing is becoming evident in Ireland;

339

as April progressed, it was clear in each subsequent HPSC report [79,80,81,82] that the rate

340

of hospitalisation and proportion of patients admitted to ICU was reducing. This is evidence

341

perhaps that a broader case suspect definition and a wider testing approach will impact the

342

overall rate of hospitalisation and admission to ICU.

343
344

LENGTH OF STAY (LOS)

345

Length of stay in hospital (Non-ICU)

346

The overall length of hospital stay varied between 3 and 52 days among studies. Two of

347

these studies were case series based on the observations of 10 [56] or 12 [83] patients, a

348

further article [22] was based on data extracted from publicly available datasets. The studies

349

are very diverse in their reporting and presentation of hospital length data. The largest study

350

is from Italy [66] reporting the median hospital stay of 5 days for cases that did not require

351

ICU level of care. However, no range or confidence interval is described by this report.

352

Similar to the shorter duration of hospital stay in Italy, a more recent study conducted in the

353

USA [13], which examined hospital records of 5,700 sequential admissions to New York

354

hospitals, reported a short length of stay, with a median 4.1 days (IQR 2.3 to 6.8). The

355

hospital length of stay varies dramatically among different studies. Perhaps differences in

356

hospital capacity, overcrowding, government policy, funding source and other factors might

357

influence length of stay. Of interest Richardson et al. [13] indicates 45 patients were re-

358

admitted to hospital for further care, indicating perhaps the pressure on bed availability.

359

Argenziano et al. [92] outlines the critical situation faced in some Emergency Departments in

360

New York and describes the death of 14.7 % of ED only patients; patients who died in the

361

emergency room prior to being admitted to hospital. Given the large variation in length of

362

stay and the difference between continents; the studies relating to hospital LOS outside an

363

ICU setting were not appropriate to use to calculate a central tendency.

364
365

Length of stay in hospital (ICU)

366

With the exception of Bi et al. [51], the majority of Chinese studies reported median ICU

367

stays of 7 to 10 days [21,35,38,39,44]. The Bi et al. [51] study reported exceptionally long

368

hospital and ICU stays, with a median 34 day duration of stay in ICU, for 19 critically ill

369

patients. Similar median lengths of stay have been reported in Italy. The Italian report [66]

370

dated 28th May 2020 describes median LOS of 9 days if admitted to an ICU setting (n =

371

31,851); however, actual length of time in ICU and proportion or number of patients cared

372

for in ICU were not specified. It is important to note too that this report while including a

373

large number of cases, only includes those who have died, and hence will not reflect the

374

possible longer stay of survivors. Another Italian study conducted by Grasselli et al. [63]

375

reports the median length of ICU stay was 9 days (IQR 6 to 13 days) for 1,581 patients. A

376

Swiss study, too, outlined the median length of stay was 9 days for 41 patients followed to

377

discharge [75]. It is noticeable that length of ICU stay is more variable in US studies. In

378

particular studies that breakdown length of stay into those completed stay compared to

379

patients continuing care. It is evident that care must be taken with interpretation, continuing

380

care groups are reported to have longer stays; median LOS of 11.4 [96]; 14 [109]; and 23

381

days [92] are outlined. Albeit, the Argenziano et al. study [92] similar to the Italian report

382

[66] reports hospital LOS rather than specific ICU LOS. A smaller case series conducted by

383

Valente-Acosta [110] in Mexico highlights this continuing care group; this study describes a

384

case series of 33 patients admitted to ICU in Mexico city, the median LOS of 23 days is

385

indicative that LOS in ICU can be significant; although their continuing care group is only n =

386

4. The authors of the UK ICNARC [24] report highlight the continued bias towards shorter

387

stay; with both survivor and non-survivor groups reported to have a median LOS of 11 and 9

388

days, respectively [24]. Indeed, earlier reports from INCARC [23} reported shorter LOS of ICU

389

patients, as fewer persons had progressed through to completion of treatment. It is evident

390

that study cut-off, and short follow ups, have influenced reported ICU LOS; it is clear that the

391

influence of continuing care groups will lengthen length of ICU stay somewhat in time.

392
393

Length of hospital stay prior to transfer to ICU

394

The Median length of hospital stay prior to transfer to ICU was short varying from 0 to 2 days

395

in the relevant articles (21,24,98,104] indicating the short time at which patients not

396

admitted directly to ICU are identified for stepped up care.

397
398

STUDY MORTALITY RATE

399

It is evident from the data reported in Figure 6 that overall mortality rate varies among

400

studies. In the studies from Asia, the mortality rates were generally low, although rates

401

higher than 10% were noted in 6 studies. In contrast, the mortality rates reported in

402

European and North American studies were substantially higher, in almost all cases

403

exceeding 10% and often much higher. Apparent too, that median (or mean) age differs

404

among these studies; the median age is lower in Asia, only two (of 31) studies report groups

405

with a median age in their sixties, while Wu and Grogan [3] report an overall mortality rate

406

of 2.3 % with 87 % of participants aged between 30 and 79. In contrast, the European and

407

North American studies document an older median age, only one UK study conducted by

408

Boddington et al. [67] reports a median age in the forties (48) for the first few hundred UK

409

COVID-19 cases; indeed 23 of 26 studies conducted in Europe and North America report

410

median age above 60 in Europe of North America. Criteria for hospitalisation will have

411

varied between countries and continents, and are thus likely to influence the relative

412

severity among hospitalised patients. Important too, to note, that some studies such as Bi et

413

al. [51] have clearly indicated that hospitalisation was used as a tool for isolation or

414

quarantine, which is a practice not generally conducted in Europe or North America. An

415

alteration in case definition may also be a factor, and should be further explored. Atypical

416

case presentations for pneumonia are described in the elderly [112,113], and a US review

417

[113] outlines tachypnoea, delirium, unexplained tachycardia or lowered blood pressure as

418

presenting symptoms in the elderly. Early studies from China refer to COVID-19 pneumonia,

419

while more recent studies refer to COVID-19 illness. Differences in case presentation due to

420

age might be a contributor to the relative lower numbers of elderly patients not being

421

included in the studies within China. The influence of pre-existing conditions and BMI within

422

the geographical area also cannot be overlooked.

423
424

CONCLUSIONS

425

Differences in the severity of case presentations and outcomes have been described

426

between continents, and countries should base its expectation on those cases observed in

427

countries of similar demographics. Advice from the ECDC suggests hospitalisation rates of up

428

to 42 % can be expected; and admission to critical care and ICU levels in up to 3 % of cases,

429

to allow for spare capacity, as mitigation measures are relaxed in our jurisdiction. There is no

430

doubt that the case definition in use and the availability of community testing will determine

431

the hospitalisation rate within a country. In countries where community testing has been

432

significant, we can expect the rate of hospitalisation and the proportion requiring ICU level

433

care to be lower. Data in Ireland certainly supports this assertion.

434
435

The length of stay in hospital outside of the ICU setting, due to COVID-19 is highly variable in

436

the literature, with median estimates varying from 3 to 52 days. Studies diverged in their

437

inclusion criterion. It is likely that the aim of hospitalisation varied among countries.

438

Discharge criteria diverged in different jurisdictions, whether it related to a patient required

439

to test negative prior to discharge or where there was pressure to free up overcrowded

440

hospitals. Indeed, it is reported that some countries used hospitalisation to ensure

441

quarantine.

442
443

As the pandemic spreads rapidly throughout the world, more and more evidence regarding

444

the length of stay in ICU following COVID-19 has been reported. Many of these reports

445

indicate a median ICU length of stay between 7 to 11 days; however a number of these

446

studies report length of stay based only on resolved cases, and as such duration of stay is

447

likely skewed towards a short stay due to bias towards those who have completed their ICU

448

stay and are now discharged or have died. Thus the upper estimates of the range should be

449

considered for use in resource models. It is apparent too that the data generated by each

450

individual country during the initial months of the outbreak will be critical to estimate the

451

parameters used for any national resource model.

reported. The estimate for Argenziano et al [92] also includes hospital LOS,
