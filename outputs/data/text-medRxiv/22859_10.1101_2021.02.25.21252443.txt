Abstract

20

Background: COVID-19 infection is a global pandemic threatening the public health. Due to the

21

development and initiation of vaccination, currently significant difference upon vaccine

22

acceptance is seen between developed and developing countries. However, there are no data on

23

the level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its associated factors in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

24

Methods: An embedded mixed method study [QUAN(quali)] was conducted among residents of

25

Akaki Kality sub-city in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. For the quantitative part, a multi-stage sampling

26

technique was used to recruit the study participants (n = 422). Twenty four adults were included

27

purposively for the qualitative in-depth interview. Data was collected by face-to-face interview

28

by using a semi-structured questionnaire. Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy

29

were identified by multivariable binary logistic regression model.

30

Result: The mean age of the participants was 34.1 years (±12.9). Nearly half (46.7%) of the

31

participants exhibited poor level of knowledge and 51.8% had negative attitude towards COVID-

32

19 and its preventive measures. One out five (19.1%) participants were not willing to get

33

vaccinated when it becomes available. In the multivariable analysis, vaccine hesitancy was

34

significantly associated with being female (aOR=1.97; 95% CI: 1.10 - 3.89, p=0.03), negative

35

attitude towards COVID-19 and its preventive measures (aOR=1.75; 95% CI: 1.08 - 3.02,

36

p=0.04), and information source being social media (internet) (aOR=3.59; 95% CI: 1.75 - 7.37, P

37

<0.0001).

38

Conclusion: A considerable proportion of the people in Addis Ababa have concerns on COVID-

39

19 vaccine and unwilling to accept once it is available. Several conspiracy theories were put

forth to justify their stance and this was mainly due to the misconceptions distributed from the

41

use of social media as source of information. Overall, providing the community with health

42

education and consistent government efforts in uphold the prevention measures are of paramount

43

importance to tackle this pandemic.

Introduction

48

Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona

49

virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also known as Novel coronavirus (nCov) [1]. The first case of COVID-

50

19 was discovered in Wuhan city, Hubei province of China with unexplained pneumonia on

51

December 12, 2019 [2]. The virus is transmitted through large droplets generated during

52

coughing or sneezing of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients [3]. Therefore, frequent hand-

53

washing with soap and water, using alcohol based hand rub or sanitizer, avoidance of hand

54

shaking/public gathering and use of face mask are crucial to halt the spread of COVID-19 [4].

55

COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World health organization on March 11, 2020 [5].

56

Since its emergence, this pandemic has shown its capability to spread rapidly in the world

57

causing the most dramatic global health crisis of our time resulting in devastating social,

58

economic and political crises [6].

59

Globally, more than 210 countries/territories have been affected by the virus, with more than one

60

hundred ten million people being infected and 2.5 million deaths reported as of February 24,

61

2021. Ethiopia ranks 71st regarding COVID-19 with more than 154, 000 infected and 2,305 dead

62

(February 24, 2021) [7]. Unfortunately, Ethiopia was found to be one of five African countries

63

with the highest case burden of COVID-19 [7]. However, the government of Ethiopia has been

64

striving to spread information on COVID-19 preventive measures via television, radio or social

65

media outlets and declared a state of emergency [8].

66

Currently, COVID-19 vaccine has been made available but it is highly controversial. More than

67

seven billion doses have been pre-purchased by countries and organizations of the world, of

68

which more than half was sold-out to high income countries [9]. This figure is threatening to the

69

global health as may be an indication of the disparities on the health delivery globally.

70

Myths and conspiracy theories on vaccinations have been spreading and can easily be accepted

71

by the developing world. This may cause people to be reluctant and maleficent towards

72

vaccination, which has been demonstrated by a study in Nigeria by a low vaccine acceptability

73

rate [10]. WHO defined vaccine hesitancy as it is a difficulty in accepting or an outright refusal

74

of vaccines, despite their availability. In 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health

75

Organization listed vaccine hesitancy as one of the ten global threats to public health [11].

76

Currently, Ethiopia has not started administering the vaccines.

77

Hence it is very crucial to understand the varying vaccine attitudes among the community to

78

design a strategy to overcome the vaccine hesitancy. Furthermore, unraveling the specific fears

79

and doubts of the community with regards to receiving the vaccine can help government and

80

other concerned officials to adequately address the misconceptions and various conspiracy

81

theories in their campaigns. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the level of COVID-19

82

vaccine acceptability among the population in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia by

83

employing a community based mixed methods study.

86

Methods and Materials

87

Study design and participants

88

A concurrent embedded mixed methods design [QUAN(qual)] was employed from January 20 –

89

31, 2021 among adult population (≥18 years) currently residing in Akaki Kality sub city of Addis

90

Ababa, Ethiopia. The qualitative part of the study was embedded in the bigger quantitative cross-

91

sectional study. The qualitative part was mainly intended to explain the reasons for COVID-19

92

vaccine hesitancy, as a supplementary of the quantitative study.

93

A sample size for the quantitative part of the study (n = 422) was determined by using a single

94

population proportion formula, by taking 95% confidence interval, 5% margin of error, 50%

95

proportion of vaccine hesitancy and adding up 10% non-response rate. For the qualitative part,

96

24 participants were included into the study based on the information saturation.

97

Multi-stage sampling technique was employed to recruit the participants for the quantitative part.

98

There were 13 districts in the sub-city; of which three of them were selected randomly (lottery

99

method). The total sample was allocated proportionally to the districts. Then, the households

100

from each district were selected by employing a systematic random sampling (sampling interval

101

= every 4th house). From the specific households selected, only one randomly selected eligible

102

individual was interviewed. For the qualitative part of the study, purposive sampling method was

103

used to recruit participants who have reach information.

104

Data collection tools and procedures

105

Data was collected by using a semi-structured questionnaire which was adapted from reviewed

106

literatures [10, 12, 13]. The questionnaire has 5 components: socio-demographic, knowledge

107

towards COVID-19, attitude towards COVID-19, practice of COVID-19 prevention measures,

108

and COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. The questionnaire was in English and translated into

109

Amharic for the interview. The questionnaire was administered face-to-face by the medical

110

interns. For the qualitative part of the study, in-depth interviews were made by the investigators.

111

Data management and analysis

112

Data was coded and entered into SPSS-for windows version 25 for analysis. Frequency and

113

proportions were used to summarize categorical variables, whereas mean and standard deviation

114

were used to summarize continuous variables.

115

The primary outcome variable of the study was COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy which was

116

assessed by asking a question “Will you get vaccinated if you get COVID-19 vaccine?” then the

117

response was dichotomized as “Yes” or “No”.

118

Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify factors associated

119

with vaccine hesitancy, as expressed by adjusted odds ratio (aOR) along with its respective 95%

120

confidence interval (CI). Variables with <0.25 in bivariate analysis were considered for

121

multivariable analysis. Variables having P value <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

122

Multicollinearity was assessed by the colleniarity diagnostics (Variance Inflation Factor and the

123

tolerance test). Goodness of the model was checked by the Hosmer Lemshow goodness of fit

124

test. The qualitative data analysis was initiated by transcription and translating of the interviews,

125

then coded and analyzed by thematic analysis. The findings of the qualitative study were used to

126

supplement the findings of quantitative data.

127

Ethical consideration

128

Ethical approval of this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of

129

Myungsung Medical College. The participants of the study was informed about the purpose of

Knowledge towards COVID-19

140

Almost all of the participants heard about COVID-19 from Television or Radio. However, the

141

average knowledge score was 56.7 ± 3.7, with 46.7% (n=191) exhibited poor level of knowledge

142

(Supplementary Table 1).

143

The qualitative part of the study found that some of the study participants stated that they do not

144

possess enough knowledge and would like to know more about things like the prospective

145

vaccines, the new strain and how to prevent getting infected from asymptomatic patients.

146

For example, one 39 year old male participant said that;

“I want to know where the virus really came from initially; is it natural or
manmade?”[39 year old, male]

149

Attitude towards COVID-19

150

The mean attitude score was found to be 20.3 ± 1.2, with 51.8% of the participants have negative

151

attitude regarding COVID-19 and its preventive measures (Supplementary Table 2).

152

This result is corroborated by the findings on the qualitative part of the study where the majority

153

of the respondents stated that they were initially very concerned but now they were less so. In

154

fact, the majority of the participants stated that they were very afraid and anxious initially

155

believing that they were definitely getting infected and that they would certainly die if they

156

caught it. Currently, most of the respondents reported feeling less anxious. While some stated

157

that while they were still aware that it was a serious illness they were less concerned since they

158

believed it was preventable. While others stated the reason for their lack or decreasing concern

159

was that they believed they would recover if they got infected.

160

In a spectrum of similar answers, five of the participants stood out stating that they did not

161

believe the disease exits anymore since they have not personally encountered an infected person.

162

In contrast to these responses, we also found two participants who stated that while they initially

163

were not concerned they are starting to get worried now since the number of infected individuals

164

and the resulting death toll in this country is increasing.

165

One female participant stated the following to show that she is not concerned about COVID-19:

166

167

168

“I am not scared because I expected this to happen; we brought this on ourselves and we
are paying for our sins. It has been long time coming.”[Female, 50 year old]
Another 45 year old female participant stated:

169

“I have been through an outbreak before…I got sick and I had to be isolated from my

170

family but I recovered easily and I don’t believe this would be any different.” [Female,

171

47 year old]

172

More than two-thirds (68.7%) of the participants believed Ethiopia would win the battle against

173

the pandemic. This finding was also supported by the qualitative study.

Vaccine hesitancy

More than 90% of the participants heard about the prospective COVID-19 vaccine mainly from

179

TV/Radio. However, 78 (19.1%) were not willing to get vaccinated when it becomes available

In the qualitative in-depth interview, some stated they did not have enough information about the

186

vaccine and wanted to see other people take it first. Majority of the respondents feared it would

result stated that they preferred other methods to prevent COVID-19. A few of the participants
nts

189

thought that the vaccine that will be distributed in Africa would be of lower quality. Others
ers

190

thought it would be used as a biological weapon by the developed nations to cause infertility and
nd

191

control the population of poor countries. Moreover, it was also mentioned that the vaccines
es

192

might be used as a weapon to insert microchips made by the illuminati, into the body as the mark
rk

193

of the beast “(666)” that would cause them to forsake their faith. A few others did not think they

needed the vaccine because they had God’s protection.

“I don’t think the vaccine will come to this country and even if it does I don’t need it;
God will be my vaccine.” [Female, 45 year old]

197

Close to 20% of the participants thought that children should not get vaccinated. Some of the
he

198

participants did not recommend the vaccine to children even though they would take it

199

themselves. These participants further expressed in the in depth interview that they thought the

virus did not affect children or it would be too dangerous for them.

Factors associated with vaccine hesitancy

215

In the multi-variable analysis (Table 2), COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was associated with sex,

216

attitude and source of information about the vaccine.

217

It was found that the odds of vaccine hesitancy was 1.97 times (aOR=1.97; 95% CI: 1.10 - 3.89,

218

p=0.03) higher among female participants as compared to male participants. The odds of vaccine

219

hesitancy was 1.75 (aOR=1.75; 95% CI:1.08 - 3.02, p=0.04) times higher in those participants

220

who were found to have a negative attitude towards COVID-19 and its preventive measures as

221

compared to those who had a positive attitude. Similarly, the odds of vaccine hesitancy was 3.6

222

times (aOR=3.59; 95% CI: 1.75 - 7.37, P <0.0001) higher among those participants that received

223

their information from social media (internet) as compared to those who received information

224

only from TV/radio.

Discussion

229

For the COVID-19 battle, the population adherence to preventive measures is crucial; however,

230

it is mainly affected by their KAP toward the disease [1]. The findings of this study showed that

231

nearly half of the study participants demonstrated inadequate knowledge of COVID-19,

232

indicating a great knowledge gap. This finding is higher than studies conducted in other parts of

233

Ethiopia such as Arbaminch (23.5%) and Gedeo (39.5%), and other low income countries such

234

as Ghana (34.9%), and Malaysia (22.7%) [14-17]. The discrepancies might be due to differences

235

in the community awareness creation through mass media and social media. Further, in our

236

study, more than half the participants had negative attitude towards COVID-19 and its preventive

237

measures, which is higher than the finding of a study conducted in Southern Ethiopia [15, 18]

238

and lower than study done among Dessie and Kombolcha town residents in Ethiopia [19]. The

239

discrepancy in the findings may be due to differences in the study period. The later studies were

240

conducted earlier in the pandemic when the declaration and enforcement of state of emergency

241

and other measures were still in place. Our findings show a significant decrease in the

242

community’s attitude towards COVID-19 and its prevention measures which can lead people to

243

become discouraged to consistently adhere to the measures set forth by the government and the

244

world health organization. These findings of the study has an implication on the public health

245

and underscore the need for urgent concerted efforts to promote the knowledge of the general

246

public in Ethiopia towards COVID-19 preventive measures. If the current trend evidenced by

247

this study continues in Ethiopia, COVID-19 will pose a devastating outcome on the medical,

248

financial and social aspect of citizens besides the potential for new strains of disease developing.

249

As COVID-19 continues to ravage the world, vaccination offers the most reliable hope for a

250

permanent solution to controlling the pandemic. However, a vaccine must be accepted and used

251

by a large majority of the population to create herd immunity [20]. The findings of this study

252

showed that about one out of five participants are not willing to receive COVID-19 vaccine

253

when it is available, which is higher than the findings reported from developed countries such as

254

UK (3%) [9, 21, 22]. The discrepancies might be due to insufficient knowledge about the vaccine

255

and difference in the perception of the seriousness of the pandemic. This implies that if the

256

doubts and fears of the majority regarding the vaccine are not addressed properly, we may not be

257

able to attain herd immunity. Surprisingly, the finding of this study was lower than a study

258

conducted in the US (31%) and Nigeria (80%) [13, 20]. This might be due to difference in access

259

to wide variety of conspiracy theories and doubts via internet.

260

Consistent to the study conducted in China [23], vaccine hesitancy was more likely among

261

females as compared to males in our study. This could be due to higher exposure of males for

262

different media as compared to females in Ethiopia. In the present study, increased likelihood of

263

vaccine hesitancy was also indicated among those with negative attitude towards COVID-19 and

264

its preventive measures. The qualitative aspects of this study also found that those participants

265

who would not take the vaccine stated one of their reason to be their lack of implicit trust in the

266

government and in health professionals. Thus, this lack of confidence in the government

267

exhibited by 41.8% of our participants may be a potential hurdle we might face after the arrival

268

of the vaccine to Ethiopia.

269

In our study, those participants who received their information from social media (internet) were

270

more likely to have vaccine hesitancy as compared to those who got their information only from

271

TV/radio. This finding of the study is in line with a study conducted to assess health protective

272

behaviors and conspiracy theories during the pandemic found that there was significant

273

association between holding a conspiracy belief and checking social media for news of COVID16

274

19 [24]. As a result, this finding is justified by our findings on both the quantitative and

275

qualitative aspects of our study which found that the majority of the reasons given for hesitancy

276

towards the vaccine were the belief in the conspiracy theories. Thus, the spared of these

277

conspiracy theories is a potential issue that can cause problems when vaccine distribution starts

278

in Ethiopia. Particularly, if these conspiracy theories start getting a wider audience thus there

279

may be a need to act in haste and find a solution before this issue worsens.

280

This study is the first community based study to assess the Ethiopian community’s perception

281

towards COVID-19 vaccine and its level of acceptance. We employed a mixed methods design

282

which enables us to make the deep understanding of the issue. However, the study might be

283

limited due to the recall bias and social desirability bias during the data collection. In addition to

284

this, our sample over represents female population because the majority of the study participants

285

that were found at home during data collection time were housewives. Therefore, generalization

286

of the study results need to be cautious.

287

Conclusion

288

A considerable proportion of the people have concerns of the COVID-19 vaccine and unwilling

289

to accept once it is available. Several conspiracy theories were put forth to justify their stance

290

and this was mainly due to the misconceptions distributed from the use of social media as source

291

of information about the vaccine. Overall, providing the community with health education and

292

consistent government efforts in uphold the prevention measures are of paramount importance to

293

tackle this pandemic.
