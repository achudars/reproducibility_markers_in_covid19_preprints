Abstract
Effectively evaluating, controlling and predicting the course of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
knowledge of the true number of infections in the population. This number, however, generally differs
substantially from the number of confirmed cases due to a large fraction of asymptomatic infections as
well as geographically and temporally variable testing effort and strategies. Here I use age-stratified
death count statistics, published age-dependent infection fatality risks and stochastic modeling to estimate the true prevalence and growth of COVID-19 infections among adults (age ≥ 20 years) in 161
countries, from early 2020 until November 1, 2020. My predictions are largely consistent with data
from multiple previous nationwide seroprevalence surveys. As of November 1, 2020, the nationwide
cumulative COVID-19 prevalence (past and current infections relative to the population size) is estimated at 31% (95%-CI 22-50) for Peru, 27% (17–41) for Mexico, 22% (14–34) for Brazil, 12% (7.2-20)
for the US, 11% (6.4–18) for the United Kingdom, 8.2% (5.2–15) for France, 7.4% (4.9–13) for Sweden, 4.2% (2.5–6.8) for Canada, 1.8% (1.2–3) for Germany and 0.12% (0.074–0.26) for Japan. These
time-resolved estimates expand the possibilities to evaluate the factors influencing the pandemic’s progression and to assess vaccination needs around the world. Periodically updated estimates are available

Introduction
Accurate estimates of the true prevalence of COVID-19 in a population are needed for evaluating (and optimizing) disease control policies and testing strategies, determining seasonal effects, predicting future disease
spread, assessing the risk of foreign travel and determining vaccination needs [1]. Further, parameter-rich
and potentially underdetermined epidemiological models [2, 3] generally benefit from independently obtained estimates of disease prevalence. Due to the existence of a large fraction of asymptomatic cases, as
well as variation in reporting, testing effort and testing strategies (e.g., random vs symptom-triggered), confirmed case counts cannot be directly converted to infection counts and a comparison of confirmed case
counts between countries is generally of limited informative value [4]. While large-scale seroprevalence
surveys (e.g., using antibody tests) can yield information on the disease’s true prevalence in a population,
such surveys involve substantial financial and logistical challenges and only yield prevalence estimates at a
specific time point.
In contrast to case reports, COVID-19-related death counts are generally regarded as less sensitive to
testing effort and strategy [5, 6], and fortunately most countries have established nationwide continuous
reporting mechanisms for death counts. Hence, in principle, knowing the infection fatality risk (IFR, the
probability of death following infection) should permit a conversion of death counts to infection counts [5, 6].
The IFR of COVID-19, however, depends strongly on the patient’s age, and hence the effective IFR of the
entire population depends on the population’s age structure as well as the disease’s age distribution [7].
Indeed, it was shown that the age-dependency of the IFR, the age-dependency of COVID-19 prevalence,
and the age structure of the population are largely sufficient to explain variation in the effective IFR between
countries [8]. This suggests that age-stratified death counts can (and must) be used with age-dependent IFR
estimates in order to obtain an accurate estimate of infection counts. This approach has been successfully
used to estimate COVID-19 prevalence over time in Europe until May 4, 2020 [6].
Unfortunately, the ongoing pandemic necessitates continuously updated prevalence estimates. Moreover,
age-stratified and time-resolved death statistics are not readily available for many countries with insufficiently
comprehensive reporting, thus preventing a direct adoption of the above approach [6, 9]. In cases where
only total death counts are available (e.g., as disseminated by the World Health Organization) one needs to
somehow independently determine the likely age distribution of infections in order to convert total death
counts to infection counts. Here I address this challenge by leveraging information on the age distribution of
COVID-19 infections from multiple countries with available age-stratified death reports, to estimate the likely
age-distribution of COVID-19 in other countries, while accounting for each country’s age structure. Based
on these calibrations, I estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 (cumulative number of infections, weekly new
infections and exponential growth rate) over time in 161 countries up until November 1, 2020, among adults
aged 20 years or more. My predictions are largely consistent with data from multiple previously published
nationwide seroprevalence surveys.

Calibrating the age distribution of COVID-19 prevalence
In order to calculate infection counts solely from total (i.e., non-age-stratified) death counts, while accounting
for the age-dependency of the IFR and each country’s population age structure, independent estimates of the
ratios of infection risks between age groups (i.e., the risk of infection in any one age group relative to any
other age group) are needed. To determine the general distribution of age-specific infection risk ratios, I
analyzed weekly age-stratified COVID-19-related death reports from 20 countries around the world using
a probabilistic model of Poisson-distributed time-delayed death counts (see Methods for details). Briefly,
for any given country c, any given week w, and any given age group g, I assumed that the number of new

infections during that week (Ic,w,g ) is approximately equal to αc,g Ic,w,r Nc,g /Nc,r , where r represents some
fixed reference age group, Nc,g is the population size of age group g, and αc,g is the relative risk of an
individual in age group g being infected compared to that of an individual in age group r. The expected
number of deaths in each age group 4 weeks later (roughly the average time lag between infection and death
[10]), denoted Dc,w+4,g , was assumed to be Ic,w,g Rg , where Rg is the IFR for that age group. Age-specific
IFRs were calculated beforehand by taking the average over multiple IFR estimates reported in the literature
[8, 9, 11–14]. This model thus accounts for the age-structure of each country, the age-distribution of the
disease in each country and the age-dependency of the IFR. A critical assumption of the model is that, in any
given country, nationwide age-specific infection risks co-vary linearly between age groups over time, i.e.,
an increase of disease prevalence in one age group coincides with a proportional increase of prevalence in
any other age group. This assumption is motivated by the observation that nationwide death rates generally
covary strongly linearly between age groups (Fig. 1A and Supplemental Fig. S1); the adequacy of this model
is also confirmed in retrospect (see below). For each country, I fitted the infection risk ratios αc,g (for all
g 6= r) as well as the weekly infections in the reference age-group Ic,w,r (one per week) to the age-stratified
weekly death counts using a maximum-likelihood approach and assuming that weekly death counts follow
a Poisson distribution. This stochastic model explained the data generally well, with observed weekly death
counts almost always falling within the 95% confidence interval of the model’s predictions (Supplemental
Fig. S2). This supports the initial assumption that infection risks co-vary approximately linearly between
age groups over time and suggests that country-specific but time-independent infection risk ratios are largely
sufficient for describing the age-distribution of COVID-19 infections in a country and over time. For any
given age group g, the fitted infection risk ratios αc,g differed between countries but were generally within
the same order of magnitude (Fig. 1B). On the basis of this observation, and as explained in the next section,
it thus seems possible to approximately estimate the number of infections in any other country based on total
death counts, the population’s age structure and the ensemble of infection risk ratios αc,g fitted above.

Estimating infection counts over time
Based on the ensemble of fitted infection risk ratios and total (non-age-stratified) COVID-19-related death
count reports disseminated by the WHO, I estimated the true weekly infection counts over time in each of
161 countries (details in Methods). Briefly, for any given country c, week w and any given set of relative
infection risks α1 , α2 , .., the total number of deaths 4 weeks later was assumed to be Poisson-distributed with
expectation equal to:
X
Nc,g
Ic,w,r
Rg αg
,
(1)
Nc,r
g
consistent with the previously described model, where as before Rg is the IFR for age group g, Nc,g is the
population size of age group g and Ic,w,r is the (a priori unknown) number of new infections in the reference
age group r during week w. For the sum in Eq. (1), I considered only age groups at 20 years or older (in
5-year intervals), because estimates of the infection risk ratios αg were unreliable for younger ages (due to
low death counts) and because deaths among less-than-20-year olds were numerically negligible compared
to the total number of deaths reported. For each week, the unknown Ic,w,r was estimated via maximumlikelihood based on the total deaths reported 4 weeks later. The total number of new infections among
P
≥20-year olds during that week was estimated as Ic,w = Ic,w,r g αg Nc,g /Nc,r . Cumulative (i.e., past
and current) infection counts were calculated as incremental sums of the weekly infection count estimates.
The pandemic’s exponential growth rate over time was subsequently calculated from the estimated weekly
infection counts based on a Poisson distribution model and using a sliding-window approach.
Depending on the particular choice of infection risk ratios, this yielded different estimates for the weekly

nationwide infection counts, the cumulative infection counts and the exponential growth rates over time.
Uncertainty in the true infection risk ratios in any particular country was accounted for by randomly sampling
from the full distribution of fitted infection risk ratios multiple times, and calculating confidence intervals of
the predictions based on the obtained distribution of estimates. Estimated weekly and cumulative infection
fractions (i.e., relative to population size) and exponential growth rates over time are shown for a selection of
countries in Fig. 2 and Supplemental Figs. S3 and S4. A comprehensive and periodically updated report of
estimates for all 161 countries is being made available at www.loucalab.com/archive/COVID19prevalence.
Global color-maps of the latest estimates for all countries are shown in Fig. 3.
To assess the accuracy of the above approach, I compared the estimated cumulative infection fractions
to previously published nationwide antibody-based seroprevalence surveys across 12 countries (Supplemental Table S2). Only surveys attempting to estimate nationwide seroprevalence in the general population (in
particular, either using geographically or demographically stratified sampling or adjusting for sample demographics) were included. Agreement between model estimates and seroprevalence estimates was generally
good, with seroprevalence point-estimates for 8 out of 9 countries (all except Brazil) being included in the
model’s 95%-confidence intervals (Figs. 2K,L,N,O and Supplemental Fig. S3). Apart from potentially erroneous model predictions (discussed below), deviations from seroprevalence-based estimates may also be
due to the fact that antibody concentrations in infected individuals (especially asymptomatic ones) can drop
over time, rendering many of them seronegative [15–17]. Thus, previously infected individuals may not
all be recognized as such. Further, sensitivity and specificity estimates for antibody tests performed in the
laboratory or claimed by manufactures need not always apply in a community setting [17], thus introducing
biases in seroprevalence estimates despite adjustments for sensitivity and specificity.

Case counts alone can yield wrong impressions
Estimates of the true COVID-19 prevalence in a population can yield insight into the pandemic’s growth
dynamics that may not have been possible from reported case counts alone. Indeed, according to the present
estimates, in most countries case counts initially severely underestimated the number of true infections and
often did not properly reflect the progression of the pandemic, although in many countries more recent case
reports do capture a much larger fraction of infections and more closely reflect the pandemic’s dynamics
(Figs. 2A–E and Supplemental Fig. S4). For example, in the US, France, Sweden, Belgium, Spain, United
Kingdom and many other European countries reported cases only reflected a small fraction of infections
occurring in Spring 2020, while the majority of infections occurring in Summer and Fall 2020 have been
successfully detected. Nevertheless, in multiple countries even recent case counts do not correctly reflect the
actual dynamics of the pandemic, sometimes even suggesting an opposite trend in its growth. For example,
recent case counts in Turkey, Iran, Egypt and Afghanistan severely underestimate the disease’s rapid ongoing
growth (Supplemental Fig. S5). Future investigations, enabled by the infection rate estimates presented here,
might be able to identify the main factors (e.g., political, financial, organizational) driving the discrepancies
between infections and detected cases and suggest concrete steps to eliminate them or correct for them.
As infection counts do not depend on testing effort and strategies, they are arguably more suitable for
comparing the pandemic’s progression between countries. Future investigations, enabled by the estimates
presented here, might be able to identify concrete political, environmental and socioeconomic factors influencing the pandemic’s growth. For example, my results indicate that as of November 1, 2020 Sweden —
often criticized for it’s reluctance to impose strong restrictions on it’s citizens — was experiencing a slower
increase of infections (relative to its population size) than many other European countries such as France,
Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom (Supplemental Fig. S4). A similar observation can be made for the US,
also frequently pointed out as a particularly severely affected country: As of November 1, 2020 the weekly

fraction of newly infected individuals (relative to population size) appears to be substantially lower in the
US than in many European countries (Fig. 2F and Supplemental Fig. S4), while the cumulative fraction of
infected individuals in the US is comparable to some European countries (e.g., Belgium, United Kingdom,
Spain) and much lower than many South American countries (Supplemental Fig. S6). These observations
highlight the importance of considering actual infection counts (and of course death counts) relative to population size when evaluating policy differences between countries.

Caveats
The predictions presented here are subject to some important caveats. First, incomplete, erroneous or agebiased reporting of COVID-19-related deaths will have a direct impact on the estimated infection counts.
This caveat is particularly important for countries with less developed medical or reporting infrastructure,
as well as for countries were reports may be censored or modified for political reasons. Comparisons of
results between countries should thus be done with care. Second, the age-specific infection risk ratios (αc,g )
were calibrated based on available age-stratified death statistics from a limited number of countries, and may
not apply to all other countries (for example due to strong cultural differences). Uncertainty associated with
this extrapolation is partly accounted for by considering infection risk ratios calibrated to multiple alternative
countries (see Methods). Third, age-specific IFRs were obtained from studies in only a few countries (mostly
western) and often based on a small subset of closely monitored cases (e.g., from the Diamond Princess cruise
ship). These IFR estimates may not be accurate for all countries, especially countries with a very different
medical infrastructure, different sex ratios in the population or a different prevalence of pre-existing health
conditions (e.g., diabetes), all of which can affect the IFR. That said, estimated trends over time within
any given country, in particular exponential growth rates (e.g., Figs. 2P–T), are unlikely to be substantially
affected by such biases. To nevertheless examine the robustness of my estimates against variations in the IFR,
I repeated the above analyses by considering for each age group an ensemble of IFRs, i.e., randomly sampling
from the set of previously reported IFRs [8, 9, 11–14] rather than considering their mean. Median model
predictions remained nearly unchanged, however unsurprisingly the uncertainty (i.e., confidence intervals)
of the estimates increased (examples in Supplemental Fig. S7).

Conclusion
I have presented estimates of the true nationwide prevalence and growth rate of COVID-19 infections over
time in 161 countries around the world, based on official COVID-19-related death reports, age-specific infection fatality risks and each country’s population age structure. My estimates are largely consistent with
data from nationwide general-population seroprevalence surveys. My findings suggest that while in many
countries the detection of infections has greatly improved, there are also examples where even recent reported
case counts do not properly reflect the pandemic’s dynamics. In particular, comparisons between countries
based on infection counts can yield very different conclusions than comparisons merely based on confirmed
case counts. My estimates thus enable more precise assessments of the disease’s progression, evaluation and
improvement of public interventions and testing strategies, and estimation of nationwide vaccination needs.

Methods
Age-specific infection fatality risks
Age-specific infection fatality risks (IFRs) were calculated based on the following literature: Table 1 in [12],
Supplementary Appendix Q in [8], Table S2 in [13], Table 2 in [11], Table S4 in [9], and Eq. (1) in [14]. For
each considered age group, the average IFR across all of the aforementioned published IFRs was used, after
linearly interpolating where necessary (Supplemental Table S1).

Calibrating age-specific infection risk ratios
Age-specific population sizes for each country (status 2019) were downloaded from the United Nations website (https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/CSV) on October 23, 2020 [18]. Time
series of nationwide cumulative COVID-19-related death counts grouped by 5-year age intervals were downloaded on November 30, 2020 from COVerAGE-DB (https://osf.io/7tnfh), which is a database that
gathers and curates official death count statistics from multiple official sources [19]. For each country included in COVerAGE-DB, and separately for each age-group, I ensured that cumulative death counts are
non-decreasing over time by linearly re-interpolating death counts at problematic time points. The resulting
time series were then linearly interpolated onto a regular weekly time grid, i.e., in which adjacent time points
are 7 days apart (no extrapolation was performed, i.e., only dates covered by the original time series were
included). The weekly number of new deaths in each age group were calculated as the difference of cumulative deaths between consecutive time points on the weekly grid. To ensure a high accuracy in the estimated
infection risk ratios, in the following analysis I only considered countries for which COVerAGE-DB covered
at least 10 weeks with at least 100 reported deaths each. The following 20 countries were thus considered:
Argentina, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Germany, Ecuador, France, United Kingdom,
Indonesia, India, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, Peru, Philippines, Sweden, Turkey and United States.
For each considered country c, I chose as “reference” age group r the age group that had the highest
cumulative number of deaths. For each other age group g, I estimated the infection risk ratio αc,g , i.e., the
probability of an individual in group g being infected relative to the probability of an individual in group r
being infected, using a probabilistic model according to which the number of deaths in group g during week
w (denoted Dc,w,g ) was Poisson distributed with expectation:
Dc,w,r · αc,g ·

Nc,g Rg
·
.
Nc,r Rr

(2)

Here, Nc,g is the population size of age group g in country c and Rg is the IFR for age group g. Under this
model, the maximum-likelihood estimate for αc,g , i.e. given the weekly death count time series, is given by:
X
w

α̂c,g = X

Dc,w,g

Nc,r Rr
·
.
Dc,w,r Nc,g Rg

(3)

w

To avoid errors due to sampling noise, only weeks with at least 100 reported deaths were considered in the
sums in Eq. (3). I mention that αc,g might also alternatively be estimated as the slope of the linear regression:
Dc,w,g ∼ αc,g Dc,w,r ·

Estimates obtained via linear regression were nearly identical to those obtained using the aforementioned
Poissonian model, and were thus not considered further.
For purposes of evaluating the model’s adequacy (explained below), I also estimated the weekly number
of infections in the reference age group, Ic,w,r , via maximum-likelihood based on a probabilistic model in
which Dc,w,g was Poisson-distributed with expectation:
E{Dc,w,g } = Rg Ic,w−4,r α̂c,g

Nc,g
.
Nc,r

(5)

Under this model, the maximum-likelihood estimate for Ic,w−4,r is given by:
Nc,r

X

Dc,w,g

g

Iˆc,w−4,r = X

α̂c,g Rg Nc,g

.

(6)

g

To evaluate the adequacy of the above stochastic model in explaining the original death count data, I simulated
multiple hypothetical weekly death counts for each age group and compared the distribution of simulated
death counts to the true death counts. Specifically, for each country c, week w and age group g, I drew 100
random death counts (D̃c,w,g ) from a Poisson distribution with expectation:
E{D̃c,w,g } = Rg Iˆc,w−4,r α̂c,g

Nc,g
.
Nc,r

(7)

Median simulated death counts and 50 % and 95% confidence intervals, along with the original death counts,
are shown for a representative selection of countries and age groups in Supplemental Fig. S3. As can be seen
in that figure, the model’s simulated time series are largely consistent with the original data.

Estimating infection counts from total death counts
Time series of total (non-age-stratified) nationwide cumulative reported death and case counts were downloaded from the website of the World Health Organization (https://covid19.who.int/table) on November 30, 2020. Cumulative death and case counts were made non-decreasing and interpolated onto a weekly
time grid as described above. Only countries that reported at least one death per week for at least 10 weeks
were included in the analysis below. For each country c, week w and any particular choice of age-specific
infection risk ratios α1 , α2 , .., the number of infections was estimated as follows. Let r denote some fixed
reference age group with respect to which infection risk ratios are defined, i.e., such that αr = 1 (here, ages
70–74 were used as reference). Let Ic,w,r be the (a priori unknown) number of new infections occurring
during that week in the reference age group. The number of deaths occurring 4 weeks later in any age group
g, Dc,w+4,g , was assumed to be Poisson-distributed with expectation equal to:
E {Dc,w+4,g } = Rg αg Ic,w,r

Nc,g
.
Nc,r

(8)

The total number of weekly deaths, Dc,w+4 , is thus Poisson-distributed with expectation:
E {Dc,w+4 } =

X

Rg αg Ic,w,r

g

Nc,g
.
Nc,r

(9)

As explained in the main text, only age groups ≥20 years were included because infection risk ratios could
not be reliably estimated for younger ages and because the contribution of younger ages to total death counts

can be considered numerically negligible. Under the above model, the maximum-likelihood estimate for
Ic,w,r is given by:
Dc,w+4 Nc,r
Iˆc,w,r = X

The total number of weekly infections, Ic,w , can thus be estimated as:

(11)

The cumulative number of total infections up until any given week can be estimated by summing the weekly
infection counts.
Exponential growth rates over time were estimated from the weekly infection counts using a slidingwindow approach, as follows. In every sliding window (spanning 4 consecutive weeks), an exponential
function of the form I(t) = Aetλ was fitted, where t denotes time in days and A and λ are unknown parameters (in particular, λ is the exponential growth rate in that window). The parameters A and λ were fitted
via maximum likelihood, assuming that the total number of weekly infections, Ic,w , was Poisson distributed
with expectation Aetw λ . Under this model, the log-likelihood of the data (more precisely, of the previously
estimated weekly infection counts) is:
ln L =

Xh

i

Iˆc,w ln A + Iˆc,w λtw − Aeλtw − ln(Iˆc,w !) ,

(12)

w

where w iterates over all weeks in the specific sliding window. The maximum-likelihood estimates of A and
λ are obtained by solving ∂ ln L/∂λ = 0 and ∂ ln L/∂A = 0, which quickly leads to the condition:

Equation (13) was solved numerically to obtain the maximum-likelihood estimate λ̂.
To assess estimation uncertainties stemming from sampling stochasticity and uncertainties in the infection
risk ratios, I repeated the above estimations 100 times using alternative infection risk ratios (for each age
group drawn randomly from the set of infection risk ratios previously fitted to various countries) and replacing
in Eq. (10) the death counts Dc,w+4 with values drawn from a Poisson distribution with mean Dc,w+4 . Hence,
rather than point-estimates, all predictions are reported in the form of medians and confidence intervals. Only
infection risk ratios for which the corresponding linear curve (Eq. 4) achieved a coefficient of determination
(R2 ) greater than 0.5 were used (shown in Fig. 1), to avoid less accurately estimated infection risk ratios
(typically obtained from countries with low death rates). Tables of all estimates for all considered countries
up until November 1, 2020 are provided as Supplemental File 1; periodically updated estimates and visual
summaries can be found at: www.loucalab.com/archive/COVID19prevalence

Figure S1: Comparison of weekly death counts between age groups. Weekly COVID-19-related death counts per
age group (vertical axes) compared to death counts in the same week in age group 70–74 (horizontal axes), in various
countries with particularly high reported death rates. Each column corresponds to a different country, each row to a
different age group, and each point to a specific week. Regression lines are shown for reference; the corresponding
fractions of explained variance (R2 ) are shown in the figures.

Figure S2: Reported weekly death counts for various countries and selected age groups (blue curves, source: COVerAGE database), compared to death counts predicted by the stochastic model fit to age-stratified death counts (black
curves are expectations, dark shades denote 50% and light shades denote 95% confidence intervals). Each sub-figure
shows a distinct age group for a distinct country.

Figure S3: Comparison of predicted infection fractions to seroprevalence data. Predicted cumulative infection
fractions relative to population size (aka. prevalence) in various countries (among adults aged ≥20 years). Black curves
show prediction medians, dark and light shades show 50 % and 95 % confidence intervals, respectively. Small circles
show empirical nationwide prevalence estimates from published seroprevalence surveys for comparison (horizontal
error bars denote survey date ranges, vertical error bars denote 95%-confidence intervals as reported by the original
publications). Seroprevalence data sources are listed in Supplemental Table S2.

Figure S4: Weekly infection fractions in Europe. Estimated weekly nationwide fraction of new infections (relative
to population size) over time, in member countries of the European Union as well as the United Kingdom, among
adults aged ≥20 years. Black curves show prediction medians, dark and bright shades show 50 % and 95 % confidence
intervals, respectively. Blue curves show weekly reported case fractions (all ages). Note that cases are shown 1 week
earlier than actually reported (corresponding roughly to the average incubation time [10]) for easier comparison with
infection counts.
