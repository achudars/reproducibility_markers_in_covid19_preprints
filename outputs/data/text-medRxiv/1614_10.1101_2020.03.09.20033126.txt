Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly spread
throughout China, but the clinical characteristics of Tibetan patients living in the
Qinghai-Tibetan plateau are unknown. We aimed to investigate the epidemiological,
clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of these patients. We included 67
Tibetan patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patients were divided into
two groups based on the presence of clinical symptoms at admission, with 31 and 36
patients in the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups, respectively. The
epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics were extracted and

analysed. No patient had a history of exposure to COVID-19 patients from Wuhan or
had travelled to Wuhan. The mean age of Tibetan patients was 39.3 years and 59% of
the patients were male. Seven patients presented with fever on admission and
lymphocytopenia was present in 20 patients. 47 patients had abnormal chest CTs at
admission instead of stating that 20 were unchanged. Lactate dehydrogenase levels
were increased in 31 patients. Seven patients progressed to severe COVID-19; however,
after treatment, their condition was stable. No patients died. Of the 36 asymptomatic
patients, the mean age was younger than the symptomatic group (34.4±17.3vs
44.9±18.1 years, P=0.02). Lymphocyte count and prealbumin levels were higher in the
asymptomatic group than the group with clinical symptoms (1.6±0.5 vs 1.3±0.6 and
241.8±68.2 vs 191.9±60.3, respectively; P<0.05). Imported cases of COVID-19 in
Tibetan patients were generally mild in this high-altitude area. Absence of fever or
radiologic abnormalities on initial presentation were common.

Introduction
Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas
of China and has now become a global threat. At the time of writing on March 2nd
2020, COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in 92 countries, with more than 100,000
cases globally. Wuhan is thought to be the site of earliest COVID-19 occurrence, and
cases further afield were infected by SARS-CoV-2 carriers from Wuhan. In particular,
the mortality of patients in Wuhan was higher than in any other city in China, at 4.3%
compared with 0.8% in the rest of mainland China(updated data available at

64bed4d89174914f9792895db5b15e8&spsw=1). The clinical characteristics and
outcome of patients seem to be different between Wuhan and other areas. Despite the
publication of many articles regarding the clinical features of COVID-19 patients,
most of these patients were considered in the context of Wuhan. Daofu, located within
the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau at an altitude of more than 3000 m, is a low-income
county in Sichuan Province, China. There are more than 3000 Tibetans living here. Of
those becoming infected, none of them had travelled to Wuhan or had a history of

exposure to COVID-19 cases from Wuhan. The clinical characteristics in Tibetans
living in these highlands were unclear. Thus, herein we provide an analysis of data
from these patients describing epidemiological, clinical laboratory and radiological
characteristics, treatment and outcome.

Methods

Patient enrollment and data collection
Daofu People’s Hospital was the only hospital that could accept COVID-19 patients.
Since the first patient with confirmed COVID-19 on Feb 4th, the local Centre for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collected nasal and pharyngeal swabs or blood
to detect viral nucleic acids by real-time PCR from more than 8000 people living in
Daofu, with and without clinical symptoms. Those with positive samples were taken
to Daofu People’s Hospital for further tests. We enrolled all patients who had been
confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 carriers from Jan4th–Feb 28th, according to a rapid advice
guideline by the Wuhan university Novel Coronavirus Management and Research
Team 1 The clinical outcomes were monitored until March 5th. This study was
approved by the institutional ethics board of Sichuan Hospital.
Epidemiological, clinical laboratory and radiological characteristics, chronic medical
histories, clinical symptoms, treatment and outcome data were obtained from
electronic medical records and analysed by two independent researchers. When
missing or uncertain records were encountered, the researchers communicated directly
with patients or their families to collect and clarify the relevant data. The date of
disease onset was defined as the day when symptoms were first noticed or the day
when the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in respiratory or blood samples from
asymptomatic patients was positive. The patients were then divided into two groups
based on the presence of clinical symptoms at time of admission. The symptomtic
group was defined as those patients with any clinical symptoms such as fever, cough
and headache. According to the diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19
issued by the Chinese National Health Committee, severe COVID-19 was defined as

the occurrence of either one of the following criteria: respiratory distress with
respiratory frequency ≥30/min; oxygenation index (artery partial pressure of
oxygen/inspired oxygen fraction, PaO2/FiO2) ≤300mmHg. Importantly, oxygenation
index should be corrected if the local altitude is higher than 1000 m using the
corrector formula: PaO2/FiO2*atmospheric pressure/760.

Laboratory testing
Patient nasal and pharyngeal swabs or blood samples were collected for detection of
SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid using real-time PCR assay. Laboratory confirmation
of SARS-CoV-2 was performed by the local CDC as previously described 1.

Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages. Continuous
variables were expressed as median + standard deviation (SD) or inter-quartile range
(IQR). Continuous variables were compared using Student’s t-test and the MannWhitney test. The chi-squared and Fisher’s tests were used for the frequencies of
categorical variables. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software
(version 24, IBM, Armonk, NY). P-values less than 0.05 were considered to be
statistically significant.

Results
Clinical findings
A total of 67 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included in this study. All of
them were Tibetans living in Qinghai-Tibetan plateau Twenty-six were members of
one family ,34 had a history of attending a funeral or temple; however, none had
visited Wuhan or had contact with Wuhan residents. The first patient to be diagnosed
with SARS-CoV-2 infection had travelled to Chengdu，the city of westchina., 10
days before onset of symptoms but denied any contact with COVID-19 patients. The
clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1.2. Thirty-nine of 67

patients (58.2%)were male, with a median age of 39.3 years. The youngest patient
was 3 years old, with his family all confirmed as SARS-CoV-2-positive. Twenty
(29.9%)of the total cohort had chronic diseases. Fever was present in only seven
patients (10%) on admission and developed in a further nine (24%) during
hospitalization. Thirty-six patients (54%) showed no clinical symptoms when they
were admitted to hospital. The remaining 31 patients (46%) presented with clinical
symptoms, of which cough was the most common (13/67, 19%). Other symptoms
included fatigue, headache, muscle ache and dizziness. Of note, the asymptomatic
group was significantly younger than the symptomatic group, with median ages of 34
and 44 years (P=0.02), respectively.

All patients consented to CT scans on admission. Forty-seven patients (70%) had
abnormal results, with 21 and 26 patients in the symptomatic and asymptomatic
groups, respectively, of which ground glass opacity was the most common pattern and
bilateral onset was the main manifestation. Chest CT imaging changed in 21 of the
patients without clinical symptoms. In five patients with clinical symptoms, chest CT
imaging showed no change. Liver injury was found in 24 of 67 patients (36%), but the
injury was very light. Increases in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate
aminotransferase were lower than twice the normal value. Creatinine levels were

(46%). Twenty-one of 67 patients (31%) showed elevated levels of hypersensitive Creactive protein. Less common findings were elevated levels of Prothrombin time and
creatine kinase, and lymphocytopenia, which was present in all patients. The
symptomatic patient group showed a higher proportion of lymphocytopenia than the
asymptomatic group. Prealbumin was significantly lower in the group with clinical
symptoms compared with asymptomatic patients (241.8±68.2 vs 191.9±60.3,

hospital, and their condition has become stable. No patients died of their illness.

Discussion
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread from Wuhan to other areas
of China and beyond. At the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, most patients had
a history of exposure to COVID-19 cases from Wuhan or had travelled to Wuhan.
With advancing time, the medical history associated with case exposure to SARSCoV-2 infected patients from Wuhan has become less obvious. Human to human
transmission is now occurring, resulting in imported cases with no direct contact with
patients in Wuhan. In our study, we assessed 67 SARS-CoV-2 infected Tibetan

patients living in theQinghai-Tibetan plateau. None of these patients had a history of
exposure to COVID-19 cases from Wuhan or had travelled to Wuhan. However, most
of them had a history of attending a gathering or contact with a SARS-CoV-2-infected
family. Isolation of cases and contact tracing has been implemented for COVID-192.
In our study, most patients did not present with typical clinical symptoms at time of
admission. This is inconsistent with recent studies, which have most commonly found
fever and cough to be the dominant symptoms3, 4. In our study, fever was only found
in 10% of patients on admission and increased to13.5% during hospitalization. Cough
was only presented by 18% of patients. The absence of fever and cough was frequent
in our study. Unlike the other studies that included only the cases who actively sought
medical attention3, our cohort included sub- or preclinical cases identified by local
CDC collection of nasal and pharyngeal secretion samples from most residents to
detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, even though the majority of residents had no
clinical symptoms or any history of exposure to COVID-19 cases. Through active
screening, we found 36 virus carriers without clinical symptoms. If surveillance relies
on fever detection or on patients actively seeking medical advice due to clinical
symptoms, many potential virus carriers may be missed.
Lymphocytopenia was common, especially in those with clinical symptoms, which is
consistent with the data reported recently. Nearly half of patients showed increased
levels of LDH, while one-third of patients suffered liver injury and decreased levels of
prealbumin. However, these changes were mild. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) may act as a potential intermediate host receptor which transmitting SARSCoV-2 to human. ACE2 is expressed in liver tissue and an overactive inflammatory
response in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause increased ACE2
expression, and thus result in the observed liver tissue injury 5, 6. Therefore, in
addition to the obvious target organ of the lungs, the liver is another important organ
that is vulnerable following infection with SARS-CoV-2.
In our study, the condition of most patients was mild, with only 10% of patients
developing to severe disease. After antiviral and oxygen therapies, the patients’
conditions gradually stabilized, with none succumbing to disease. The fatality rate

was therefore lower than that reported by the national official statistics, which
recorded a rate of death of 3100 among 80000 cases of COVID-19 to date in China.
One reason for this discrepancy may be that in our study, all the patients were
imported cases resulting from serial human to human transmission rather than direct
contact with cases in Wuhan. In addition, the altitude at which our cohort lives is
higher than 3000 m and so virus viability and virulence may be decreased. The second
reason may be that the median age was 39.3 years in our study, which was younger
than that reported by Huang et al 7. Interestingly, the median age of patients with
clinical symptoms was older than that of asymptomatic patients (44.9 vs 34.4 years,
P=0.02). In general, older persons appear more susceptible to COVID-19 and more
likely to suffer severe disease, which may be due to underlying health issues and
comorbidities 8. In our study , the mean age of severe cases were 58.5 years. A further
reason for the discrepancy in mortality rates between our study and the national
figures may be that because the local CDC actively screened a large number of
residents, approximately half of the patients were identified and admitted to hospital
before clinical symptoms appeared. Patients therefore received treatment at the
earliest stages of disease. Early identification and timely treatment are of crucial
importance for effective prevention of severe disease.
Our study has some notable limitations. First, only 67 patients were included,
although this study describes the largest cohort of Tibetan patients. With the effective
measures taken by the government, the number of new patients has decreased.
Second, some patients remained in hospital and the outcome is unknown at the time
of data cutoff. We will continue to focus on the prognosis of these patients and report
outcomes in due course.
In conclusion, imported cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Tibetan patients were
generally mild in this high-altitude area. Absence of fever or radiologic abnormalities
on initial presentation was common. Our findings highlight the importance of active
screening for residents who live in areas with high incidence rate of COVID-19.
