Abstract
Current guidelines recommend that individuals who have had COVID-19 should receive the identical
vaccine regimen as those who have not had the infection. This includes two doses of the mRNA platform
vaccines (BNT162b2/Pfizer; mRNA-1273/Moderna) that are approved for use in the United States. In this brief
report, we show that after a single dose of the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, individuals that had prior SARSCoV-2 infection had significantly higher antibody levels than individuals that had no history of infection. This
provides the rationale for changing vaccination policy to deliver only a single dose to individuals with recent
SARS-CoV-2 infection that may free up additional doses for individuals that have no preexisting immunity to
the virus. Future study of other immune parameters such as T cell response and durability of immune response
should be rapidly undertaken in individuals that had COVID-19 prior to vaccination.
Main
Currently, there are two SARS-CoV-2 vaccines approved for emergency use by the FDA that utilize
mRNA platform technology (BNT162b2/Pfizer; mRNA-1273/Moderna) 1,2. Phase 3 trials of these vaccines
showed greater than 90% efficacy at preventing symptomatic infection after two doses administered three to
four weeks apart. These trials were conducted primarily in participants without previous SARS-CoV-2
infection. There have been over 26 million documented cases of COVID-19 in the US with high rates of
seroprevalence observed in recent studies3. Thus, there is an urgent need to determine the immune response to
vaccination in persons with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Due to current shortages in global vaccine
production and distribution, single dose regimens in certain populations, such as those with preexisting
immunity, may increase vaccine availability.
Here we determined antibody levels at baseline and 3 weeks after the first vaccine dose of the Pfizer
BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine in healthcare workers with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection 30-60 days prior to vaccine (COVID19+; N=36) or workers without history of infection (COVID19;N=152). Using a multiplex bead binding assay (Millipore #HC19SERG1-85K) that measures IgG levels
against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunits S1, S2, Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and the nucleocapsid
protein (NP), we found that after the 1st vaccine dose, both COVID19- and COVID19+ individuals antibody
titers were enhanced to all proteins with the exception of NP which is not a vaccine antigen (P<0.0001,
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney; Figure 1A). At baseline, we observed 6 individuals that had antibody levels that
matched COVID-19 seropositive status and may have had undiagnosed infection. Namely, having MFI ≥1000
for the S1 protein. We separated these individuals from analysis (Undiagnosed) and found that they resembled
the COVID19+ in the week 3 serology assays. After the first vaccine dose COVID19+ individuals had
significantly higher antibody titers to the S1, S2 and RBD compared to COVID19- individuals (P<0.0001,

Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney). As a proxy for measuring virus neutralizing antibodies, we utilized an FDA
approved in vitro assay that allows qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in the blood
(Genscript, #L00847; Figure 1B). We found that neutralizing antibodies were boosted for the COVID19+
individuals (median 48.6% blocking at baseline and median 96.3% blocking at week3; P<0.0001, WilcoxonMann-Whitney). While COVID19- individuals neutralizing antibodies were also boosted after vaccination
(median 8.9% blocking at baseline and median 59.5% blocking at week3) they were significantly lower than the
COVID19+ individuals (P<0.0001, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney).
These findings suggest that in individuals with recent SARS-CoV-2 infection or seropositive status elicit
a more rapid booster antibody response to vaccination and provides a rationale for considering a single dose
vaccine regimen in this population. The duration of antibody responses also will need further investigation.
