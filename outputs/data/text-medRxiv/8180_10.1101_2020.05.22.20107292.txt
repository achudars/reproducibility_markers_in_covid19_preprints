The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a public health problem unprecedented in the recent
history of humanity. Different in-house real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) methods for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis
and the appearance of genomes with mutations in primer regions have been reported. Hence, wholegenome data from locally-circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains contribute to the knowledge of its global
variability and the development and fine tuning of diagnostic protocols. To describe the genetic
variability of Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genomes in hybridization regions of oligonucleotides of the main inhouse methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection, RNA samples with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis
were processed through next-generation sequencing. Primers/probes sequences from 13 target regions
for SARS-CoV-2 detection suggested by 7 institutions and consolidated by WHO during the early stage of
the pandemic were aligned with Muscle tool to assess the genetic variability potentially affecting their
performance. Finally, the corresponding codon positions at the 3’ end of each primer, the open reading
frame inspection was identified for each gene/protein product. Complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes were
obtained from 30 COVID-19 cases, representative of the current epidemiology in the country.
Mismatches between at least one Colombian sequence and five oligonucleotides targeting the RdRP and
N genes were observed. The 3’ end of 4 primers aligned to the third codon position, showed high risk of
nucleotide substitution and potential mismatches at this critical position. Genetic variability was
detected in Colombian SARS-CoV-2 sequences in some of the primer/probe regions for in-house rRT-PCR

rates of false-negative results should be experimentally evaluated. The genomic surveillance of SARSCoV-2 is highly recommended for the early identification of mutations in critical regions and to issue
recommendations on specific diagnostic tests to ensure the coverage of locally-circulating genetic
variants.

In late December 2019 in Wuhan city (China), a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 (initially nCoV-2019)
caused the outbreak of a respiratory disease known as the infectious disease due to the new
coronavirus (COVID-19 ) (Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Soon after learning about the potential for
transmission of this virus in the context of a globalized world, countries took swift and extreme
measures such as border closings, rigorous follow-up of contacts, and mandatory preventive isolation. In
Colombia, the first case of COVID-19 was identified on March 6, 2020, shortly before the World Health
Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic after it had spread in 114 countries in all
continents and having claimed the lives of 4,291 people (WHO, 2020a).

The first case of COVID-19 in Colombia was imported from Italy, a country that had the most alarming
epidemic peak in Europe at that time. Shortly afterwards, cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed in travelers
from other origins, as well as in multiple of their contacts. On April 20, 2020, community transmission
cases already exceeded 10% of the total cases registered in the country, which is why the transition to
the mitigation phase was declared. Until May 18, 2020, 4,629,000 cases and 297,380 deaths have been
reported globally, and in Colombia, 16,295 cases and 592 deaths have been reported (Dong, Du, &
Gardner, 2020).

SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus with a positive polarity single-stranded RNA genome of approximately
30 kb. This new coronavirus shares a global identity of 96.2% with the bat coronavirus RaTG13 (Zhou et
al., 2020), 91.2% with the Malay Pangolin coronavirus isolate, Pangolin-CoV (Zhang, Wu, & Zhang, 2020),
and even 97.5% with RmYN02 derived from bat when the ORF1ab gene is exclusively analyzed (Wang,
Pipes, & Nielsen, 2020). Its recent origin is enigmatic since there is a high similarity between the amino
acid sequence in the receptor-binding domain (RBD domain) of subunit 1 (S1) of the Spike protein of
SARS-CoV-2 and that of Pangolin-CoV , but the latter lacks the polybasic furin processing site, exclusive
to SARS-CoV-2 (Andersen, Rambaut, Lipkin, Holmes, & Garry, 2020). Accumulated evidence suggests a
zoonotic origin of the virus as a result of recombination with a yet unidentified coronavirus or
convergent evolution driven by natural selection to optimize interaction with the human ACE2 cell
receptor (Wang et al., 2020; WHO, 2020b). After the publication of the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome in

genomic data repositories such as NCBI (MN908947.3) and GISAID in mid-January 2020, health agencies
and researchers from different countries quickly developed SARS-CoV-2 screening tests based on realtime RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) that amplify different SARS-CoV-2 gene regions. Hundreds of commercial kits are
under development and many of them have been licensed for emergency use
(https://www.finddx.org/covid-19/pipeline/). Various in-house protocols were also developed and
published on the website of the World Health Organization (WHO) for informational purposes without
implying endorsement, preference or validation by this entity (WHO, 2020c). However, most of these
protocols were published during January 2020 when only 230 virus sequences were available that
circulated exclusively in Asia and Europe, except for a few cases in the United States and Canada
(Holshue et al., 2020).

Since then, refinements of these protocols are not known in the context of nearly 30,000 sequences
reported on May 18, 2020, worldwide, including Latin America, which provide a more complete
perspective of the accumulated genetic variability and sequence particularities of viruses circulating in
specific regions that could affect the efficiency and sensitivity of the rRT-PCR protocols currently shared
by WHO. The mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 as a virus with an RNA genome is higher than that of viruses
with a DNA genome (Tang et al., 2020), with an estimated mean evolutionary rate of 2.24 x 10-3
substitutions/site/year (Li, Li, Cui, & Wu, 2020); therefore, changes in the sequence could occur over
time that compromise the operational performance of diagnostic tests (PAHO, 2020). The objective of
this study was to describe the genetic variability of Colombian SARS-CoV-2 genomes in hybridization
regions of oligonucleotides of the main in-house methods for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

Nasopharyngeal swab samples from patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were received at the
Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS) as part of the virological surveillance of COVID-19 from 11 Colombian
departments and the capital district. According to the national law 9/1979, decrees 786/1990 and
2323/2006, the INS is the reference lab and health authority of the national network of laboratories and
in cases of public health emergency or those in which scientific research for public health purposes as
required, the INS may use the biological material for research purposes, without informed consent,
which includes the anonymous disclosure of results. This study was performed in accordance with the
ethical standards noted in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. The information
used for this study comes from secondary sources of data that were previously anonymized and do not
represent a risk to the community.

The complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence of 30 patients was obtained through NGS, ten genomes
with Oxford Nanopore (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) and 20 genomes with Illumina
MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) technologies, following the artic.network "nCoV-2019 sequencing
protocol" (Quick, 2020). In both strategies, SARS-CoV-2 specific oligonucleotides were used for the
generation of amplicons by means of a Q5® high fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc.,
UK), in order to avoid the introduction of artificial mutations. The genomes were assembled by mapping
to the reference genome (NC_045512.2) using the BWA (Li et al., 2020) and BBmap (brian-jgi, 2020)
software to generate a consensus genome by the two assembly tools.

The Colombian genomes and oligonucleotides from of the in-house protocols were aligned with the
Muscle tool (Edgar, 2004) using the MEGA X software (Kumar, Stecher, Li, Knyaz, & Tamura, 2018).
Substitutions matrices of the Colombian genomes respect to the reference genome (NC_045512) at the
nucleotide and amino acid levels were generated for the 13 rRT-PCR protocols published at the WHO
website (WHO, 2020c), which several countries have established as their preferred diagnostic protocol
for SARS-CoV-2.

A total of 39 primer and probe sequences from the main in-house rRT-PCR protocols for SARS-CoV-2
detection published at WHO website were aligned to the reference sequence derived from the first
confirmed case at Wuhan, Hubei province, China, and named Wuhan-1 strain (GenBank Accession
Number: NC_045512.2). The protocols targeted 13 different genome regions inside the Orf1ab (Nsp9,
Nsp10, Nsp11, RdRp, ExoN), E (Envelope) and N (Nucleocapsid) genes with 61,5% (8/13) of the assays
targeting the N gene (Figure 1).

district (Antioquia, Bogotá D.C., Bolivar, Caldas, Cauca, Magdalena, Norte de Santander, Quindío,
Risaralda, Santander, Tolima and Valle del Cauca) through the National Public Health Laboratories
Network to the Colombian National Institute of Health for diagnostic confirmation.

From the alignment of the 39 oligonucleotides to the reference and Colombian SARS-CoV-2 sequences, 5
showed mismatches with at least one Colombian sequence (Table 1). The conflicting sites in the
primer/probe sequences were due to 1) a mismatch between the oligonucleotide and the reference and
Colombian sequences or 2) a mismatch between the oligonucleotide and one or more Colombian
sequences.

The Hong Kong(2020) HKU-NP probe (Chu et al., 2020) (Figure 2) was extremely different to all the
reference and Colombian SARS-CoV-2 by four nucleotide sites. This probe also presents the formation of
a highly stable hairpin and self-dimer structures (Table S1). The Corman Berlin(2020) RdRP SARSr-F2
(Victor M. Corman et al., 2020) (Figure 3) region was variable in one Colombian SARS-CoV-2 sequence
from the department of Valle del Cauca (ID: 79943), involving a critical site at the 3’ pentamer. This site
is supposed to prevent the correct hybridization of the 3’ end of the primer, leading to inefficient or
unsuccessful extension by the DNA polymerase. The RdRP SARSr-R1 primer (Victor M. Corman et al.,
2020) showed a degenerate site which does not comprise the nucleotide found in the reference and
Colombian SARS-CoV-2 sequences. However, this mismatch was located at an internal site of the primer,
only partially affecting the thermodynamic profile of the primer-target hybridization. The Zhu 2020 CDCChina Set I Probe(ORF1ab) (Zhu et al., 2020) (Figure 4) was found to be almost completely
complementary with the Colombian SARS-CoV-2 sequences, except for a viral sequence obtained from a
human case in the department of Antioquia (ID: 79253), bearing a single substitution at the seventh
probe position, without considerable effect on the thermodynamic features for probe-target
hybridization (Table S1). The Zhu 2020 CDC-China Set II Fw(N) primer (Figure 5) hybridization was found
to be critically affected by the accumulated genetic diversity of the Colombian SARS-CoV-2 strains. At
the 5’ end of the primer a triple-nucleotide substitution GGG AAC in three sequences from Bogotá and
Valle del Cauca affected the Tm and ΔG. At the 3’ region, two sequences from Quindío displayed a
substitution affecting the 3’ pentamer stability.

Codon positions in coding regions are differentially susceptible to nucleotide substitution, being the
third codon position associated with a higher substitution rate. On the other hand, the perfect matching
of the last nucleotide at the 3’ end of every forward and reverse primer is critical for DNA polymerasebased extension during PCR amplification (Staheli, Ryan, Bruce, Boyce, & Rose, 2009). Therefore, the
rational design of primer to be used with rapidly evolving RNA viruses should have the requisite of
avoiding third and sometimes first codon positions.

195
196

Codon position of the last nucleotide at the 3’ end of every analyzed primer was identified according to
the corresponding open-reading frame. The 3’ end of 11 primers corresponded to the first codon

position, another 11 primers had 3’ ends located at the second codon position and the 3’ end of 4
primers aligned with the third codon position (Table 1). One of the primers (Nao 2020(Japan)NIID 2019nCOV N F2) had the 3’ end aligned with the first codon position of the codon CUA which encodes for
alanine. This codon allows a substitution at the first codon position (C to U) to be synonymous and
therefore may escape to the selection pressure at the protein level.

corresponding ORFs. Two of these primers were the forward and reverse primers proposed to amplify a
specific target (CDC 2020(USA) 2019-nCoV N3) at the N gene making this protocol very susceptible to
false negative results as the viral genetic variability increases.

Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies are a valuable tool in determining the whole genome of
microorganisms impacting on public health, they have accelerated our ability to understand important
factors in the biology of infectious diseases such as the identification of determinants of virulence, drugresistance associated substitutions, vaccine design and genomic epidemiology, a powerful approach to
integrate epidemiologic and genetic information in reconstructing transmission patterns and infectious
disease dynamics (Gwinn, MacCannell, & Armstrong, 2019). NGS has also enabled pathogen discovery in
a timely manner compared to traditional methods, being essential to the virus taxonomic classification
during the beginnings of COVID-19 pandemics (Zhou et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). This robust molecular
information is also the raw material for the development and refinement of molecular and serological
diagnostic methods (Wang et al., 2020) and all sequence-based designs are susceptible to improvement
as the virus disseminates and its genetic variability increases.

Mutation is the fundamental source of genetic variation and RNA viruses are particularly susceptible to
have high mutation rates during the genome replication (Sanjuan, Nebot, Chirico, Mansky, & Belshaw,
2010). Therefore, RNA viruses display high substitution rates when analyzed through time. Although
sequence identity between the analyzed genomes and the Wuhan reference strain (NC_045512) was
around 99.9%, the estimate substitution rate for SARS-CoV-2 is in the range of 1.67-4.67 x 10-3/site/year
(Tang et al., 2020). Therefore, it is evident that the genomic data of this study allow the refinement or
even the design of more precise and efficient protocols for the molecular detection of the genetic
variants of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Colombia.

An enormous effort of every official and private laboratory around the word has led to the availability of
hundreds of commercial kits and in-house protocols for the molecular detection and COVID-19
diagnostic confirmation. While this effort is welcome and some recommendations have been provided
by regional agencies, the availability of all these methods imply the need for an evidence-based criterion
for decision-making about the best option at country level. In this study, based on NGS data of complete
SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Colombian cases, timely evidence is provided on the genetic variability of
representative strains of the circulating viruses in the country that should be considered for an
evidence-based improvement of the routine diagnostic tests.

The majority of the evaluated in-house molecular assays displayed genetic stability at the
primers/probes target regions. However, some these oligonucleotides displayed mismatches that were
considered of minor or major importance for the test performance based on the in silico analysis. Some
of the analyzed primers/probes displayed mismatches when compared to target sequences of some
Colombian SARS-CoV-2 strains. Polymorphic sites in the complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes obtained in this
study, were supported by sequencing depths between 123 and 390X sufficient to identify these
sequence variations unequivocally. The analyzed genome sequences corresponded to the early
introduction and dispersion of the virus in the country. It is expected that some of the identified
nucleotide substitutions remain stable in subsequent transmission chains of the corresponding clusters
of cases, as demonstrated in the present study as character states shared by two or more sequences.

Prior to the arrival of SARS-CoV-2 in Colombia, the Charité-Berlin protocol described by Corman and
collaborators was established as a routine in detection (Victor M. Corman et al., 2020) following the
recommendation of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). Their three molecular targets (RdRp,
E and N genes) were analyzed and RdRp displayed some conflicting nucleotide sites. The antisense
primer RdRp SARSr R1 presented a degenerate site at the nucleotide position 15,519 equivalent to
nucleotides G or C (S) while the reference and all Colombian sequences displayed T at that position.
However, this mismatch was expected not to affect seriously the overall stability of its hybridization.
There was an important finding in the sense primer RdRp_SARSr_F1 which displayed a mismatch at
position 15,451 when compared to the hCoV/Colombia/Valle_del_Cauca/79943/2020 genome. This
mismatch located at the second base of the 3’ end of the primer is expected to severely affect the
primer hybridization and subsequent DNA polymerase-mediated extension. In the present study, we
propose to include a degenerate site (R) as follows (RdRP_SARSr-F2 Mod 5'GTGAAATGGTCATGTGTGGC G-3'). Thus, covering the genetic variability and improving the
thermodynamic stability with this genetic variant to avoid false-negative results (Table S2). The
nucleotide identity of the Colombian genomes with respect to the Corman Berlin (2020) E Sarbeco and N
Sarbeco designs was 100%. These results supported the PAHO recommendation of diagnostic
confirmation based on the single E gene in the context of sustained transmission at high levels in this
region where other coronavirus species of the subgenus Sarbecovirus are expected to be absent (PAHO,
2020).

Another critical characteristic of the primers/probes of the current in-house protocols listed by WHO
and assessed in the present study was the codon position at the 3’ end of the sense and antisense
primers in coding regions. The major and minor susceptibility to nucleotide substitutions for the third
and second codon positions, respectively, is widely known. As any change at the 3’ end can affect the
primer hybridization, it is highly recommended that this position aligns with the second (preferable) or
first codon position. Some primers and indeed primer sets were found to be coincident with the third
codon position. Despite not finding substitutions at these sites in the Colombian strains, that position is
expected to be unstable through time.

Genomic data available from this study allowed the in silico evaluation/refinement of the protocols for
molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Colombia. It is highly recommended to establish
routine molecular surveillance of the virus in order to determine the real impact of every mutation in
the diagnostic test’s performance (PAHO, 2020).

Finally, the implementation of molecular tests at country-level should be supported by the estimation of
the analytical sensitivity (Limit of detection [LOD] in copies/reaction), specificity (Victor M. Corman et
al., 2020), and the accumulated genetic variability should be tested during the implementation of a
molecular detection protocol including the clinical sensitivity in different biofluids (V. M. Corman et al.,
2016), reproducibility, repeatability, inter-operator, inter-instrument, inter-site and inter-batch assays
(Hu et al., 2019).

293

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA using nucleic acid amplification techniques such as rRT-PCR continues
to be the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (WHO, 2020d). However, all sequence-based
methods are susceptible to nucleotide substitution affecting the oligonucleotide hybridization efficiency
and resulting in false negatives. Some of the in-house protocols analyzed in the present study require an
experimental evaluation of their performance in the context of virus genetic variability. The genomic
data of this study allow the refinement or even the design of more precise and efficient protocols for the
molecular detection of the genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in Colombia. However, more NGS
data from Colombian SARS-CoV-2 will be determinant to a better comprehension of the impact of
genetic variability on specific molecular assays of routine use as the virus evolves.
