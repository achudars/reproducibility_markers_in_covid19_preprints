Background The COVID-19 outbreak in Stockholm, Sweden, is characterized by a near-absence of
governmental interventions and high fatalities in the care home population. This study analyses the
outbreak and the social-distancing effectiveness timeline in the general population and the care
homes.

Methods A novel distributed-compartmental, time-variant epidemiological model was designed
specifically for COVID-19 transmission characteristics, featuring a/pre/symptomatic transmission, a
non-linear hospital model, a weakly-coupled sub-model for the care-home population, and
parametrized continuous social-distancing functions. The model parameters and the socialdistancing timelines are determined by randomization and Monte-Carlo simulations analysing realworld data.

Findings Despite a high initial reproduction number (3·29) and the near-absence of governmental
interventions, the model quantitated that the transmission rate in the general population was
suppressed by 73%, and in the care homes by 79%. The measures in the care homes took effect 4·8
days delayed; and if applied 4 or 8 days earlier, the fatalities could have been reduced by 63·2% or
89·9%. The infected population is estimated to 16·2% (June 10). An expected underestimation of
population immunity by antibody studies is confirmed. The infection fatality ratio extrapolates to
0·61% (peak: 1·34%). The model indicates a seasonal effect which effectively suppressed a new rise.
An analysed large-scale public event had no large influence. The asymptomatic ratio was determined
to 35%.

Interpretation The proposed model and methods have proven to analyse a COVID-19 outbreak and
to re-construct the social-distancing behaviour with unprecedented accuracy, confirming even minor
details indicated by mobility-data analysis, and are applicable to other regions and other emerging
infectious diseases of similar transmission characteristics. The self-regulation of the population in
Stockholm, influenced by advices by the authorities, was able to suppress a COVID-19 outbreak to a
level far beyond that the stringency index of governmental interventions suggests. Proper timing of
effective measures in the care homes is important to reduce fatalities.

Sweden, has never imposed a lockdown and only issued very few governmental restrictions. Instead,
the population has been briefed daily with advices by the Public Health Agency of Sweden
(Folkhälsomyndigheten, FHM). As of June 10, 4795 confirmed COVID-19 deaths have been reported
in Sweden (population: 10·3 million), by that time the fifth highest death rate per capita in the
world. Sweden has a 80·3% share of the deaths in North Europe, despite only having 38·2% of the
Nordic population.1 The region Stockholm (23% of the population of Sweden) accounts for 45·4% of
all deaths in Sweden, and is characterized by a large proportion of deaths (43·3%) having occurred in
the care-homes population (only 0·6% of the total population).

Epidemiological modelling of the COVID-19 outbreak has been used for forecasting the healthcare
demand2 and to develop containment strategies using non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI).3,4,5
Modelling is also used to determine key parameters such as population immunity and infection
fatality rate (IFR), and to analyse the impact of imposing and revoking social-distancing
measures.6,7,8,9,10 A well-established class of models is the Susceptible(S)-Exposed(E)-Infected(I)Recovered(R)-Deceased(D) compartmental model.11,12,13 Due to short simulation times, in particular
deterministic SEIRD models are used for parameter estimation by randomization.14 The impact of
interventions is usually modelled by discrete steps of the infectivity parameter.2,6,8,15 It was found
that multiple inferring change points are more suitable for tracking the effect of specific
interventions.7 A continuous modelling of the transmission-rate reduction is assumed to be more
suitable for countries like Sweden, without disruptive governmental interventions and adjusting to
the self-regulation behaviour of the population.

The deterministic, time-variant SEIRD model (Figure 1) features distributed compartments for more
realistic modelling of the different phases of the infection by time-distributed parameters
(infectivity, hospitalization and death rates, probabilities for PCR or antibody positive testing) as
shown in Figure 2:A. The model comprises two weakly coupled sub-models, for modelling the
different dynamics of the general population (GP) and the care homes (CH). The GP model features
an asymptomatic (individuals never developing clearly noticeable symptoms) and a symptomatic
branch, with the latter structured into pre-symptomatic and symptomatic compartments. Only
individuals in compartments I1—I4 are considered infectious in both branches, and only
compartments I3-I6 of the symptomatic branch have associated hospitalization and death rates.
Environmental transmission is not modelled due to its minor contribution for COVID-19.16,17,18 Agegroups, work/household environment, or individual susceptibility is not modelled.19,20

For the GP model, the force of infection 𝜆𝐺𝑃 (in Δ𝑆𝐺𝑃 = −𝜆𝐺𝑃 ∙ 𝑆𝐺𝑃 ) is as follows:

The CH model is simplified (3-day latency; 3-day infectious phase I1 including two presymptomatic

respectively.

The GP and CH transmission rates are scaled by the time-variant factors 𝛽0 and 𝛽𝐶𝐻 , in the following
referred to as social-distancing effectiveness functions (SDEF), which track the social-distancing
behaviour and seasonal effects. All elements of the transmission-rate matrix are independently
controllable by time-dependent reduction factors, which allows to investigate the effect of different
advices to the population, from staying-home with symptoms to whole-household quarantine
(Figure 2:B).

Since the reported number of patients in ICU in Stockholm follows not exactly the shape of the
general ward, it was assumed that with time a growing proportion of patients can be kept in regular
ward, which was implemented by a three-parameter logistics function (details in Appendix). The
hospital death rate, in relation to the hospital occupancy, was found to decrease with time, which
might reflect increasing treatment experience or a reduced number of CH patients transferred to
hospital, which is also modelled by a parametrized logistics function. A non-linear hospital and ICU
death-rate scaling factor, depending on the hospital occupancy, is also implemented by a logistics
function.

The onset of symptoms after infection is set to 5 days (discretization of the 5·2 days incubation
time).22,23 The distribution of the transmission rates in the two presymptomatic (I1, I2) and the two
symptomatic (I3, I4) infectious compartments (Figure 2:A) is following the distribution of
transmission-pair analysis so that the proportion of the presymptomatic transmission events in the
symptomatic branch is 44%.24 The total contagious period (I1-I4) is 7 day.22 Since literature reports no
significant difference in viral spread between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals,25,26 the
initial infectivity in the two branches is the same, followed by a 75% reduction after the first
symptomatic day in the symptomatic branch when symptomatic individuals are assumed to reduce
social interaction.

The proportion of cases moving into the asymptomatic branch is determined by analysing the

the literature (pre- and post-lockdown study in Vo, Italy;25 Diamond Princess;27 Heinsberg study;28

For the care-home model (CH), the outcome is decided in average seven days after onset of
symptoms (FHM: two thirds of all CH fatalities in the first week). The CH death rate is 39·75%
(reported CFR for CH, Stockholm, May 25). The hospital transfer rate is set to 5% (assumption based
on: only 10·7% of all care-home inhabitants in Sweden are younger than 75 years;31 and FHM: only a
small fraction of care-home patients benefits from critical and intensive care), which is also reflected
by the high proportion of CH deaths and the low ICU death rate.

The ICU is modelled after a report by the Swedish Intensive-Care Register (SIR) of April 30
(median/mean/max time: 6·75/7·25/31·8 days; 29·75% death rate; time on ward before transfer to
ICU: 2·1 days). 32 The average times on regular (H1) and on post-ICU (H2) ward are 8 and 5 days,
respectively.33 It is assumed that most people surviving ICU recover, therefore the H2 death rate is
arbitrarily set to 5% of the H1 death rate. The hospitalization-rate distribution, i.e. the transfer from
the GP symptomatic-branch compartments, was set so that the average time from onset of
symptoms to hospitalization is 8·16 days.32

The starting values and randomization confidence intervals of the unknown model parameters (SDEF
for GP and CH; hospitalization rate; ward-to-ICU transfer, hospital death-rate, and the hospital nonlinearity parameters) were determined by sensitivity analysis using multi-dimensional parameter
variation, with the GP SDEF initially modelled by a three-parameter logistics function. The
parameters were then refined by randomization with Monte-Carlo simulations. Minimum mean
square error functions were used to benchmark the model outcome to real-world data: the number
of patients in critical care and in intensive care, the number of date-adjusted GP and CH deaths
(daily situation reports, Region Stockholm), and the results of two PCR studies by FHM in April.34,35
The results of four weekly antibody studies by FHM (April to June),36 where non-COVID-19 patients
seeking ambulatory care in Stockholm were sampled, was not included for model fitting since FHM
reported on May 26 a potential bias towards persons with a lower risk of infection for this type of
sampling, and since in particular mild/asymptomatic people do not have a robust antibody
response.26,37

The model is started by injecting infected cases to the latency compartment so that the daily new
infections are matching the reported confirmed cases from contact tracing, assuming a 5-day
reporting delay and a 5—10 times larger dark number range (Figure 3:B). The injections happen
primarily in Stockholm’s winter school vacation week, reported by FHM to have been the major
source of imported cases.

For the determination of the SDEF function of the GP by Monte-Carlo simulations, 15 randomized
points with shape-preserving piecewise cubic interpolation were mapped on the initial logistics
function. The points were optimized by three subsequent Monte-Carlo batches with 1 million
simulation runs each, where the 95%CI calculated from the corrected sample standard deviation of
the 100 best functions of a previous batch were used as the 95%CI for the randomization in a

was done by a subsequent 1-million-run batch (Figure 4:C). For the CH model, the SDEF was
modelled as a three-parameter logistic function, determined with the internal and external
transmission-rate factors by a 1-million simulation-run batch. All parameters were fine-adjusted with
a combined 1-million run batch. More details on the model and data fitting in the Appendix.

The SDEF determined for the GP with the advices to the population by FHM, governmental
measures, and key events of the outbreak mapped on the timeline, with comparison to Google’s
mobility data analysis38 and the Oxford Governmental Stringency Index,15 is shown in Figure 5. From
an initial 1·0 (February 1), the function falls to a minimum of 0·29 (April 5). The major reduction
happens between March 6 and 20, when the majority of the governmental restrictions and advices
were issued. The slope and the increase after April 4 are in good agreement with the mobility data,
which recorded for Stockholm a major slope between March 7 and March 19 (-31% retail/recreation
mobility; -45% public-transport; -42% workplace-mobility) and shows a minimum for the Easter
weekend, for which media reported a traffic reduction by 90% as compared to previous years. A
more detailed mapping of the Easter week (April 5-15) was carried out by three additional
randomization points, while randomizing also all surrounding and following points in two 1-million
simulation-run batches (Figure 4:B), revealing a 3·9% improved error-function, a deeper SDEF
minima to 0·27, and a rise thereafter to the previous level (comparison of the two SDEF in Figure 5).
After a local peak (May 13; 0·34) the social distancing function falls again, contrary to the mobility
data. A time-shifting of the SDEF by ±2 days results in a large variation in peak hospital beds (-763 (29%) to 1517 (+39%); Figure 4:D), which confirms the previously reported sensitivity to the timing of
NPIs.7 Verification tests of the SDEF and its independency on the starting point choice were done by
shifting the starting points ±1—±3 days (500000 Monte-Carlo runs each). The SDEF function was
confirmed by all verification functions, with the local minima (April 5) and the local maxima (May 13)
of the original SDEF matching the 95%CI (estimated from the 100 best functions each) of 5 out of 6
verification functions. The average deviation of the 50% transition was 0·32 days (95%CI[0·28, 0·36])
(details in Appendix).

The delay between the SDEFs of the CH to the GP was determined to 4·8 days (95%CI[4·67, 4·92]),
and the final level is lower for the CH (0·2048, 95%CI[0·2038, 0·2058]) than for the GP, indicating
that measures in the CH were taken later but were more effective. Figure 4:E shows that the CH
deaths could have been reduced by 63·2% (606 people, 95%CI[604, 608]) if the transmission-rate
reduction in the CHs would have been simultaneously with the GP, or, if additional four days earlier,
even by 89·9% (95%CI[89·6, 90·2]). If the imported infections by CH workers and visitors would have
been halved early on, the CH deaths could have been reduced by 44·6% (95%CI[44·4, 44·6]; Figure
4:F). With 43·3% of Stockholm’s total deaths attributed to the care homes, these reductions would
have decreased the total fatalities by 15·9%, 43·7%, and 24%, respectively. The hospital death-rate
nonlinearity for peak day (April 6) was determined to +6·6% (95%CI[-5·5, 18·8]). By June 10, 16·2%
(95%CI[15·9, 16·48]) of the hospital patients had needed intensive care.

injection (Figure 6:F). Reff, after falling below 1·0 on March 27 and reaching a minimum of 0·84 on
April 1, increases to 0·99 on May 7, after which it falls again. The confidence intervals given in the
following, for data referring to the total number of infected, are dominated not by the data-fitting
but by the PCR-study reference-points uncertainty. By June 10, 16·2% (95%CI[10·9, 22·8]) of the
population in Stockholm had been infected, increasing by 0·8% (95%CI[0·54, 1·12]) per day (Figure
6:D). The population immunity predicted by the model matches the results of FHM’s antibody
studies at the upper quartile of their confidence-intervals (Figure 6:D), confirming the expected
underestimation (average difference: -1·57%, 95%CI[-1·06, -2·22]). The number of infectious people
has been reduced from its peak of 44140 (95%CI[29680, 62269]; April 1) to 15120 (95%CI[10167,
21330]), and the daily new infections are down from a peak of 6719 (95%CI=[4518, 9478), March 23)
to 1590 (95%CI[1069, 2243]), same level as of March 8 (Figure 6:E). The hospitalization rate was
2·27% (95%CI[1·52, 3·20]). The peak infection fatality rate (IFR) was 1·34% (95%CI[0·90, 1·89]), and
would extrapolate to 0·61% (95%CI[0·41, 0·86]; Figure 6:F). The asymptomatic ratio is determined to
35% by analysing the literature with this model.

The Eurovision Song Contest (ESC) Swedish Final (Stockholm, March 7, 27000 attendees), took place
at a time when Sweden was the only country in Europe which had not banned large-scale public
gatherings. Several COVID-19 super-spreader are known,28,39 and can have severe impact an
outbreak, as in South Korea where 61·3% of all cases by March 15 were associated with a church
service on February 9.40 The model determines the epidemiological parameters in Stockholm on
March 7 to: Reff=2·76, 6674 infected, 2011 contagious, 1449 daily new infections, 23·3 contagious
people present at the event. The potential impact of the event was analysed by injecting an average
number N of transmissions per contagious person, scaling the model starting sequence to maintain
same outcome, and then removing the injected ESC incidences to determine the outcome without
the event. For N=5/10/20, the ESC contributes by 115/226/439 additional transmissions, and, if
cancelled or conducted without public, the peak hospital occupancy would have been reduced from
1084 to 1069/1055/1028 patients (-1·4/-2·7/-5·4%). A local raise in the number of hospital patients,
even for N=50 determined to only 4·6 patients, is not visible in the real-world data with a localized
(17 points) standard-deviation of 11·4 patients. If happened on February 2 or 3 weeks earlier, and a
single contagious individual present would have triggered 20 or 50 transmission-chains, the event
would have added 12·9% or 30·8% to the epidemic, respectively.

The proposed distributed-compartmental epidemiological model, with COVID-19 specific infection
characteristics including a sub-model for the care homes, was able to track the Stockholm outbreak
and to quantitate the social-distancing effectiveness function with an unprecedented accuracy so
that even small details in the timeline, indicated by mobility data analysis, were resolved. The model
is constructed as a trade-off between model complexity, accuracy, and speed for suitability for largescale data fitting methods. This study has quantitated that by primarily relying on the advices by
authorities and on the self-regulation of the population, as in Sweden, it is possible to at least
temporarily suppress COVID-19 by 73%, far beyond the government stringency-index indication. The
determined social-distancing behaviour of the general population follows the mobility data analysis,
whereas the determined care homes transmission-rate reduction, delayed by several days, follows
the delayed government stringency index timeline. This indicates that the general-population selfregulation effect was ahead of time of the effect of governmental measures. The decrease of the

social-distancing function after a local peak in May, contradicted by mobility data, indicates the
onset of a summer seasonal effect and has prevented Reff from climbing again above 1·0. The model
outcome, in agreement with previous studies, is very sensitive to the timing of the social-distancing
function. An anticipated underestimation of the population immunity by antibody studies is
confirmed. This study has quantitated the importance of applying early care-home protection
measures. The analysis of Europe’s last large-scale public event in pre-corona times has found that at
an already wide-spread community transmission such an event has a significantly lower impact as
compared to happening in a more sensitive earlier phase. The proposed model and methods are
applicable to other regions and other emerging infectious diseases with similar transmission
characteristics as COVID-19.
