Abstract

2

Identifying areas with high COVID-19 burden and their characteristics can help improve

3

vaccine distribution and uptake, reduce burdens on health care systems, and allow for

4

better allocation of public health intervention resources. Synthesizing data from various

5

government and nonprofit institutions of 3,142 United States (US) counties as of

6

12/21/2020, we studied county-level characteristics that are associated with cumulative

7

case and death rates using regression analyses. Our results showed counties that are

8

more rural, counties with more White/non-White segregation, and counties with higher

9

percentages of people of color, in poverty, with no high school diploma, and with

10

medical comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension are associated with higher

11

cumulative COVID-19 case and death rates. We identify the hardest hit counties in US

12

using model-estimated case and death rates, which provide more reliable estimates of

13

cumulative COVID-19 burdens than those using raw observed county-specific rates.

14

Identification of counties with high disease burdens and understanding the

15

characteristics of these counties can help inform policies to improve vaccine distribution,

16

deployment and uptake, prevent overwhelming health care systems, and enhance

17

testing access, personal protection equipment access, and other resource allocation

18

efforts, all of which can help save more lives for vulnerable communities.

20

Significance statement: We found counties that are more rural, counties with more

21

White/non-White segregation, and counties with higher percentages of people of color,

22

in poverty, with no high school diploma, and with medical comorbidities such as

23

diabetes and hypertension are associated with higher cumulative COVID-19 case and

Introduction

10

COVID-19 has had significant medical, social, and economic impacts on all

11

communities in the United States (US), and efficient allocation of limited resources,

12

mitigation of public health control measures, and prevention of overwhelming health

13

care systems have been constant challenges (1–8). Concerns about access to testing

14

and personal protective equipment (PPE) arose during Spring 2020, and existing

15

challenges in Winter 2020-2021 include vaccine distribution, deployment and uptake (9–

16

14). The rapidly increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in

17

the US present an urgent need to develop efficient vaccine distribution, deployment and

18

uptake strategies and to craft effective public health measures. This will allow for better

19

control of the pandemic and reduce the burden of COVID-19 on health care systems.

20

Current US national vaccine guidelines use individual-level factors to prioritize

21

certain high-risk people, such as healthcare workers and long-term care residents first,

22

and then certain essential workers and elderly (15, 16). However, this strategy has been

23

shown to lead to vaccines being distributed proportional to population density, leaving

1

more sparsely populated areas at increased risk (17). Given the high vaccine efficacy of

2

the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines, vaccination implementation and

3

compliance to increase vaccine uptake is the defining challenge in 2021(18, 19).

4

Vaccine distribution and uptake strategies that additionally account for spatial

5

information and local community characteristics of regions with the most COVID-19

6

cases and deaths can help more rapidly get vaccines into people’s arms, save even

7

more lives, and make the COVID-19 burden on healthcare systems more manageable

8

(20–22).

9

It is hence of substantial interest to identify counties of high case and death rates

10

and understand the characteristics of these counties. For a comprehensive assessment

11

of total COVID-19 impact across all US regions, raw observed case and death counts

12

and rates per capita (population size) at the county level are typically presented (23–

13

25). However, 2019 US county population sizes vary from as small as 86 residents in

14

Kalawao County, Hawaii to over 10 million residents in Los Angeles County, California.

15

Using per capita rates, one case equivalent in Kalawao County is equivalent to

16

approximately 117,000 cases in Los Angeles County. Crude rate estimates for small

17

counties are unstable, and a more statistically sound framework is needed to

18

appropriately quantify total COVID-19 case and death burdens for US counties of all

19

population sizes. By leveraging data across different counties and accounting for

20

uncertainty, and we can also identify county-level characteristics that are associated

21

with county-level disease burdens.

22

In this study, we use county-level demographic, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic,

23

and medical comorbidities variables synthesized from various data sources to build

24

regression models that i) study county-level covariate associations with COVID-19 total

case and death rates, ii) provide estimates of COVID-19 total case and death rates that

2

are more reliable than raw observed rates for all US counties, and iii) explore season-

3

varying county-level associations with COVID-19 weekly case and death rates. Our

4

models show disease burdens greatly vary between counties, and our models reveal

5

common characteristics of counties with high disease burdens. Counties that are more

6

rural, have a greater percentage of people of color, more White/non-White segregation,

7

and more residents in poverty, with no high school diploma, and/or with medical

8

comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension, are associated with higher

9

cumulative COVID-19 case and death rates.

10

Our models provide more reliable model-based county cumulative case and

11

death rates by leveraging information across counties and accounting for instability in

12

estimated rates from less populated counties. Season-varying analyses revealed that

13

urban counties with more racial minorities were associated with higher weekly case and

14

death rates in the Spring, more rural counties were associated with higher weekly rates

15

in the Fall, and counties with more residents with no high school diploma and

16

comorbidities such as hypertension were associated with higher weekly rates in the

17

Spring, Summer, and Fall. These association analysis results and county-specific case

18

and death rate estimates can be used to identify vulnerable US counties with high-risk

19

county-level factors and with the greatest total COVID-19 burden to date. Such counties

20

can be prioritized for prevention and intervention efforts including but not limited to

21

vaccine distribution and uptake, testing and resources for control measures, and

22

management of COVID-19 burdens on local health care systems.

We obtained demographic, socioeconomic and comorbidity data from a COVID-

2

19 GitHub repository that drew from the US Department of Agriculture, Area Health

3

Resources Files, County Health Rankings and Roadmaps, Centers for Disease Control

4

and Prevention, and Kaiser News Health (26). We obtained COVID-19 county cases

5

and deaths from 1/22/20-12/21/20 from USA Facts (27) and additional demographic

6

data from the US Census Bureau (28).

7

We used a Poisson mixed model to model cumulative case and death counts for

8

all 3,142 US counties through 12/21/20. We included fixed effects for each state to

9

account for state-to-state variation not explained by variables in the model (such as

10

state testing rates), a random effect for each county to account for overdispersion and

11

county testing rates, and an offset term for log county population (2019 US Census

12

estimates). Model variables are listed in Table S1 and model covariate geographic

13

heatmaps are in Figures S1-S2. Continuous covariates were scaled to have mean zero

14

and standard deviation one for modeling. County model-based estimates and

15

confidence intervals were calculated from model output.

16

Model coefficient estimates and confidence intervals were used to explore

17

associations between county-level covariates and COVID-19 rates. Exploratory total

18

case fatality rate (CFR) analyses were performed by modeling total county death counts

19

with an offset for log total case counts. Additional spatiotemporal modeling of weekly

20

county case, death, and case fatality rates from 3/23/20-12/21/20 (40 repeated

21

measures per county) was performed to investigate how county-level associations

22

varied by season. Extra details about data sources and statistical methods are available

23

Results
Our model estimated case and death rates matched well with the corresponding

3

observed rates. Figure1 shows heatmaps of the observed rates, heatmaps of the

4

estimated rates, and a scatterplot of observed versus estimated values by county.

5

There was the most agreement between observed and estimated case rates (Figure

6

1A). While there were only 3 counties reporting zero total cases as of 12/21/20, there

7

were 111 counties reporting zero total deaths as of 12/21/20. These zero death counties

8

can be appreciated in the left panel observed heatmaps of Figure 1B by the “coarse,

9

pixelated” patterns, particularly noticeable in the central Midwest. The corresponding

10

center panel estimated death rate map values are noticeably “smoother” in this region.

11

These patterns are also reflected in the right panel scatterplot by the increased number

12

of points on the y-axis.

13

Associational relative risks (RR) for the multiplicative increase in county COVID-

14

19 cumulative case, death, and case fatality rates were calculated for a one standard

15

deviation increase of a county-level variable. Figure 2 shows univariable and

16

multivariable case rate RR, and Figure 3 shows univariable and multivariable death rate

17

RR. Univariable analyses show that more rural counties and counties with more racial

18

minorities, socioeconomic disadvantage, and increased health comorbidities tend to

19

have higher total case and death rates. After adjustment in multivariable analyses, more

20

rural counties, and counties with increased White/non-White segregation, poverty, no

21

high school diplomas, diabetes, heart failure, and hypertension tended to have higher

22

total case and/or death rates.

shows how many of these variables are correlated. More rural counties tend to have

2

more males residents, residents 60+ years, and fewer minorities. Black/African

3

American percentage tended to be positively correlated with socioeconomic and health

4

comorbidity variables. Socioeconomic and health comorbidity variables tended to be

5

positively correlated. Spatial patterns among different covariates also exist. Figures S4-

6

S5 show heatmaps of standardized covariate values for modeling. Black percentages,

7

stroke, heart failure, hypertension, and kidney disease percentages are all greatest in

8

the Southern states. Hispanic percentages are greatest along the Southwestern states.

9

Smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) percentages are elevated

10

along the Appalachian Mountains.

11

Our model estimated rates can be used to identify states with the greatest

12

COVID-19 burden. Figure 4 shows (A) the counties with the top 30 estimated total case

13

rates and (B) the counties with the top 30 estimated total death rates. States such as

14

North Dakota, South Dakota, and Texas have multiple counties in the top 30 estimated

15

case and/or death rates. Counties with smaller populations tend to have larger

16

confidence intervals. For example, among case rates, Buffalo County in South Dakota

17

has a population around 2,000 and a relatively larger confidence interval, while Hale

18

County in Texas has a population around 33,000 and a relatively smaller confidence

19

interval. Among death rates, Kenedy County in Texas has a population around 400 and

20

a relatively larger confidence interval, while the Bronx Borough in New York has a

21

population around 1.4 million and has a relatively smaller confidence interval.

22

We performed exploratory total case fatality rates (CFR) analyses. Assuming the

23

ascertainment rates of reported cases vary by state or county, and by including fixed

state effects and county random effects, the CFR and infection fatality rate (IFR)

regression analyses produced identical results for covariate associations (see

2

Supporting Information for further discussion). Observed and estimated CFR rates

3

matched well, similar to the death rates (Figure S6). The CFR results had similar

4

directions to the primary death rate results, and counties with more residents age 60+

5

years were associated with increased case fatality rates on both univariable and

6

multivariable analyses (Figure S7). However, these analyses are likely subject to bias

7

due to several factors, such as differential underestimation of the total number of cases

8

by race and ethnicity selection bias of subjects who have been tested (29, 30).

9

We further explored how county-level covariate associations with COVID-19

10

rates varied over the course of the pandemic. Figures S8-S9 show longitudinal trends

11

of COVID-19 county cases and deaths over time. Figures 8A and 9A show total case

12

and death counts were mostly concentrated in a few areas including the Northeast

13

during the Spring, increased in the South during the Summer, and increased

14

everywhere including rural areas during the Fall. Figures 8B and 9B show similar

15

patterns for case and death rates respectively, though the increased case and death

16

rates in some Midwest States are more prominent. Figures 8C and 9C show case and

17

death rates by US Census region were highest in the Northeast during the spring,

18

highest in the South during the summer, and highest in the Midwest during the Fall.

19

Longitudinal modeling of weekly county case and death rates was performed.

20

Tables S2 and S4 show univariable season varying relative risks for weekly case and

21

death rates respectively, and Tables S3 and S5 show multivariable relative risks for

22

weekly case and death rates respectively. Similar to total rate analyses, many

23

covariates had significant associations in univariable modeling that changed in

24

multivariable modeling. During the Spring, more urban counties and counties with more

1

racial minorities and racial residential segregation tended to have greater case and

2

death rates. As the pandemic progressed, during the Fall, more rural areas tended to

3

have greater case and death rates. Socioeconomic variables such as no high school

4

diploma and medical comorbidity variables such as hypertension were associated with

5

increased case and death rates throughout the Fall, Summer, and Spring.

6

Lastly, we look at case fatality rates over time. Figure S10 shows longitudinal

7

trends of COVID-19 case fatality rates over time. Figure S10A shows how due to

8

possible delays between COVID-19 testing confirmation and official recording of

9

COVID-19 deaths, national death rates lagged by about one week peak at the same

10

time as national case rates for USAFacts data. Figure S10B does not show any distinct

11

geographic case fatality rate patterns, but case fatality rates appear to be decreasing in

12

all regions over time. Figures S10C shows case fatality rates have fallen since the start

13

of the pandemic.

14

Longitudinal modeling of case rates adjusted for the observed one-week

15

reporting lag specific to USAFacts data (ex. weekly deaths ending on 12/21/20 were

16

matched with weekly cases ending on 12/14/20). Table S6 and S7 show univariable

17

and multivariable season-varying weekly case fatality relative risks. Counties with more

18

residents ages 60+ years and counties with larger percentages of medical comorbidities

19

tend to have increased case fatality relative risks throughout the Spring, Summer, and

20

Fall. More rural areas have tended to have greater case fatality rates during the Fall.

21

However, just as with the cumulative case fatality rate analyses, various reporting

22

biases exist. Additional challenges include matching individuals death and case dates

23

using aggregated data and instability from low weekly case count offsets, especially for

24

sparsely populated areas.

Discussion
Using county-level data obtained from various government and nonprofit

4

sources, we provide model-based estimates of COVID-19 total case and death rates for

5

every county in the US. Unlike observed per capita rates, our model-estimated rates are

6

more stable in counties with smaller populations and allow for better quantification of

7

estimate uncertainty. We also explore associations between county-level covariates and

8

total case and death rates using our model, and we find that rural counties, counties

9

with more White/non-White segregation, and counties with increased socioeconomic

10

disadvantage and increased medical comorbidities all tend to have greater cumulative

11

case and death rates. These findings and results can better inform policies for strategic

12

vaccine distribution, deployment and uptake, mitigation of public health control

13

measures, assessment of preparedness of health care system capacity, and reduction

14

of health care burdens to vulnerable US counties.

15

The CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) releases

16

recommendations for vaccine distribution,(15, 16) but state governments ultimately

17

decide how to distribute vaccines and encourage vaccine uptake (31). To assist states

18

in formulating their own vaccine distribution policies and vaccine uptake strategies, we

19

provide observed and estimated case, death, and case fatality rates for all US counties.

20

Tailored strategies can also target county-level factors we have identified in

21

associational analyses. All results will be updated regularly.

22
23

We are primarily interested in studying the associations between county-level
covariates and total case and death rates to identify county-level characteristics for high

11

1

disease burdens. These results can then be used to identify vulnerable counties so that

2

tailored strategies can be developed to improve vaccine distribution and uptake and

3

improve disease control measures. Our county-level association analysis results are

4

consistent with results from various individual-level studies. Racial minorities have been

5

found to have increased COVID-19 case, hospitalization, and death rates in the Spring

6

(32–36). Older patients are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms and

7

have greater mortality rates (37). Household size is known to affect COVID-19 contact

8

and transmission rates (38). Heart failure, hypertension, and stroke are important

9

biological and clinical risk factors for COVID-19 disease severity and mortality (37, 39).

10

We are primarily interested in this paper studying how county-level

11

characteristics are associated with their cumulative case and death rates. These

12

county-level associations should not be interpreted as individual level associations.

13

Associations observed at an aggregated level may be in the same direction, different

14

direction, or not exist at the individual level (40). As seen in Figures S1-S2, S4-S5 and

15

noted earlier in the results section, most county-level covariates have a clear

16

geographic pattern that likely makes estimating individual-level effects difficult. Multiple

17

covariates are correlated in multivariable modeling and complicate confounding issues

18

in estimation and inference. Lastly, as with all observational studies, associational

19

findings do not imply causality. However, the focus of our study is on estimating county-

20

level case and death rates and identifying county-level characteristics of vulnerable

21

counties to help counties develop tailored strategies for vaccination, public health

22

control measure and management of health care burden, not estimating individual-level

23

effects. Therefore, these limitations are less relevant to our primary study goals.

1

Our analyses of weekly COVID-19 case and death rates also support how

2

COVID-19 has disproportionately affected various vulnerable populations at different

3

times. The early stages of the pandemic in the Spring had disproportionately affected

4

racially diverse but socioeconomically disadvantaged urban areas. More recently in the

5

Fall, predominately white, rural, socioeconomically disadvantaged areas have been hit

6

harder. Most research on the COVID-19 pandemic has focused on urban areas, and

7

more studies of rural areas with individual-level data are needed to better characterize

8

the experience of these diverse 46 million individuals (5, 41).

9

Next steps to improving our model-based estimates can include obtaining data at

10

finer geographic resolution such as at the US census tract or zip code level. Additional

11

variables such as neighborhood testing rates, percentage of healthcare workers,

12

percentage of essential workers, exposure to infected individuals within households and

13

in communities, personal protective equipment access, use of public transportation,

14

utilization rates of available healthcare facilities/resources, access to living resources

15

(such as a lack of access to clean water in many households of American

16

Indian/Alaskan Native communities), health literacy, occupation and work conditions,

17

housing conditions, basic living resources, and access to COVID-19 treatments may

18

further improve modeling accuracy. As more counties report COVID-19 deaths and

19

fewer counties have zero deaths, as with the case rates, our estimated death rates will

20

likely also closer match the observed death rates. Modeling of longitudinal case and

21

death counts can also be done using differential equations and incorporating

22

information on unascertained and asymptomatic cases (29).

23
24

In summary, multi-faceted efforts are needed to combat the pandemic, optimize
COVID-19 vaccine distribution, deployment and uptake and resource allocation, prevent

more rural counties and counties with more residential racial segregation, less

7

education infrastructure, and/or greater prevalences of medical comorbidities.

8

Intervention measures can include policies requiring face coverings, guaranteeing

9

workers can take paid sick leave, providing personal protective equipment to essential

10

workers, and ensuring prioritized and robust testing, tracing, and isolation infrastructure.

11

Outreach efforts can include vaccination education by engaging community leaders and

12

health care providers, transportation assistance, social and community support, and

13

increased accessibility and affordability of health care. Our model estimated county

14

case and death rates are more reliable metrics of total COVID-19 burden and can

15

further help optimize resource allocation, plan education efforts on public control

16

measure and vaccination deployment and uptake, reduce burdens on health care

17

systems, and minimize additional loss of life.

Statistical Analyses
Cumulative COVID-19 county case and county death counts were each modeled

19

using a Poisson mixed effects model using log(county population size) as an offset.

20

Models included fixed effects for covariates and indicator variables for each state to

21

account for differences in state geography, testing rates, and other sources of

22

variability. County specific random effects were included to account for overdispersion

23

and county testing variability. All continuous variables were scaled to have mean 0 and

24

standard deviation 1. Heatmaps of standardized covariates are in Figures S4-S5.

1

To explicitly define the cumulative case rate model, assume 𝑅𝑖𝑗 is the number of

2

reported cases and 𝑃𝑖𝑗 is the population of county j of state i. Then the case rate

3

Poisson mixed model can be written as
′
ln(𝑅𝑖𝑗 ) = ln(𝑃𝑖𝑗 ) + 𝜃𝑖 + 𝑋𝑖𝑗
𝛿 + 𝑒𝑖𝑗 ,

4
5

where 𝜃𝑖 is the state effect, 𝑋𝑖𝑗 is a vector of covariates, and the 𝑒𝑖𝑗 are county-specific

6

random effects. The death and case fatality rate models follow the same structure. Total

7

death rates modeled total deaths instead of total cases. Total case rates additionally

8

used log total cases as an offset instead of log population size. For case fatality rate

9

models, counties with total case counts of zero were set to one so the log offset would

10
11

be defined.
Univariable models included a single covariate for 𝑋𝑖𝑗 , and separate models were

12

fit for each outcome and each covariate combination. Multivariable models included all

13

covariates for 𝑋𝑖𝑗 and a single model was fit for each outcome. Predicted rates were

14

calculated from the cumulative case and death rate models used. Predictions included

15

estimated fixed and random effects (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) and confidence

16

intervals incorporated estimated standard errors for both fixed and random effects.

17

Estimates and confidence intervals for 𝛿 were used to explore associations between

18

county-level covariates and COVID-19 rates.

19

We also explored including state testing rates as a covariate for modeling.

20

However, we found this did not change any estimated effects adjusted for demographic,

21

race/ethnicity, socioeconomic, and comorbidity variables because we already controlled

22

for fixed state effects using state dummy variables. Adding state testing rates only

23

changed the estimated state fixed effects through re-parametrization.

1

To explore how county-level associations have changed with time, we modeled

2

county weekly case and death counts (40 repeated measures per county). To define our

3

case rate model, let 𝑃𝑖𝑗 be the population size and 𝑅𝑖𝑗𝑡 be the observed deaths in county

4

𝑗 of state 𝑖 on week 𝑡. The Poisson mixed model with mean cases 𝜆𝑖𝑗𝑡 can be written as

5

′
ln(𝜆𝑖𝑗𝑡 ) = ln(𝑃𝑖 ) + 𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑗
𝛿 + 𝑆(𝑡)′ 𝛽𝑠 + 𝑏̃𝑖𝑗 + 𝑏𝑖𝑗𝑡 ,

6

where 𝑋𝑖𝑗𝑡 is a vector of covariates including state fixed effects and covariate season

7

interactions, 𝛿 is a vector of regression coefficients, 𝑆(𝑡)′ 𝛽𝑠 is a cubic spline basis for

8

time with knots every 14 weeks that varies by US Census region, 𝑏̃𝑖𝑗 are independent

9

and identically distributed (i.i.d.) county specific random effects with 𝑏̃.𝑗 ~ 𝑁(0, 𝑉(𝜎1 )),

10

and 𝑏𝑖𝑗𝑡 are county specific longitudinal random effects with AR-1 correlation structure

11

𝑏𝑖𝑗 i.i.d 𝑁(0, 𝑉(𝜎2 )). Estimation and inference proceed using penalized quasi-likelihood

12

as implemented in the “glmmpql” command from the MASS package in R.(47–49)

13

The weekly death rate model is the same except weekly new deaths instead of

14

weekly case counts are the outcome variable. A time-invariant population size offset is

15

still used. For the weekly case fatality rate model, due to delays between COVID-19

16

diagnosis and official recording of death, we introduced a one-week lag for weekly

17

COVID-19 deaths specific to the USAFacts data. For example, weekly deaths on

18

12/21/20 for example were shifted back to have an offset for weekly cases on 12/14/20.

19

For case fatality rate models, counties with total case counts of zero were set to one so

20

the log offset would be defined. Additionally, if the number of weekly deaths was greater

21

than the number of matched weekly cases, we set the weekly cases offset to be equal

22

to the corresponding weekly deaths outcome.

Case Fatality Rate and Infection Fatality Rate Regression

3

We conducted case fatality rate (CFR) and infection fatality rate (IFR) regression

4

analyses to investigate death rates among infected subjects. CFRs were calculated by

5

dividing the number of deaths by the number of reported cases in each county. CFR

6

regression was performed in a similar way to the cumulative death rate regression by

7

fitting Poisson mixed models except for using an offset for log(total reported cases)

8

instead of log(population size). IFR were calculated by dividing the number of deaths by

9

the number of infected cases in each county.

10

Since county-specific number of total infected cases were not observed and

11

would likely be underestimated by using the numbers of reported cases, we estimated

12

the county-specific total number of infected cases by dividing the number of total

13

reported cases by a constant ascertainment rate of cases. Since the county-specific

14

testing data and ascertainment rates were not available, we modeled them using state-

15

specific fixed effects and county-specific random effects and allowed the ascertainment

16

rates to vary between states and counties.

17

To define the CFR model, assume 𝑅𝑖𝑗 is the number of reported cases and 𝜇𝑖𝑗 is

18

the mean number of cumulative deaths in county j of state i. Then the CFR Poisson

19

mixed model can be written as

20

ln(𝜇𝑖𝑗 ) = ln(𝑅𝑖𝑗 ) + 𝜃𝑖 + 𝑋𝑖𝑗′ 𝛿 + 𝑒𝑖𝑗 ,

21

where 𝜃𝑖 is the state effect, 𝑋𝑖𝑗 is a vector of covariates, and the 𝑒𝑖𝑗 are county-specific

22

random effects to account for overdispersion.

23

For the IFR model, let 𝐼𝑖𝑗 be the unobserved total number of infected cases in

24

county 𝑗 of state 𝑖. Suppose 𝑎𝑖𝑗 is the unobserved ascertainment rate for state i and
28

1

county j. The estimated ascertainment rate has been estimated to be between 4% to

2

20%(30). We have 𝐼𝑖𝑗 = 𝑎𝑖𝑗. Let 𝑎𝑖𝑗 = 𝑐𝑖 𝑑𝑖𝑗 , where 𝑐𝑖 is the overall ascertainment rate

𝑅

𝑖𝑗

3

for state 𝑖 and 𝑑𝑖𝑗 is the multiplicative departure of the ascertainment rate of county 𝑗

4

from the state level acertainment rate 𝑐𝑖 . Then the IFR Poisson mixed model can be

5

written as
′
′
ln(𝜇𝑖𝑗 ) = ln(𝐼𝑖𝑗 ) + 𝑋𝑖𝑗
𝛼 + 𝛽𝑖 + 𝑏𝑖𝑗 = ln(𝑅𝑖𝑗 ) − ln(𝑐𝑖 ) + 𝛽𝑖 + 𝑋𝑖𝑗
𝛼 − ln (𝑑𝑖𝑗 ) + 𝑏𝑖𝑗 ,

6
7

where 𝛽𝑖 is the state effect. Write 𝛾𝑖 = −ln(𝑐𝑖 ) + 𝛽𝑖 and 𝑢𝑖𝑗 = − ln(𝑑𝑖𝑗 ) + 𝑏𝑖𝑗 . Then we

8

have

9

′
ln(𝜇𝑖𝑗 ) = ln(𝑅𝑖𝑗 ) + 𝛾𝑖 + 𝑋𝑖𝑗
𝛼 + 𝑢𝑖𝑗 .

10

Assuming 𝑢𝑖𝑗 to be county-specific random effects following a normal distribution

11

𝑁(0, 𝜏), it follows that the IFR regression model is identical to the CFR regression model

12

except that the estimated state effects and the county-specific random effects can also

13

be interpreted as capturing the state and county-level ascertainment rates. Therefore,

14

the identical results for CFR and IFR regressions are presented in Figure 5. Future

15

work can investigate allowing the county-specific ascertainment rate to be better

16

estimated when county-specific testing data are available.

17

The CFR/IFR results differed from the cumulative death rate results possibly

18

because of differential underestimation of asymptomatic and mildly asymptomatic cases

19

by race/ethnicity(29), selection bias associated with both the subjects who were tested,

20

e.g., symptomatic subjects were more likely to be tested and to test positive, large

21

fluctuations in the numbers of tests from county to county, and insufficient testing

22

capacity. Additional data collection, such as county-level testing data and race/ethnicity

23

specific case and death counts, is needed to better estimate the number of infected
