Abstract
Two of the COVID-19 vaccines currently approved in the United States require two doses,
administered three to four weeks apart. Constraints in vaccine supply and distribution capacity,
together with a deadly wave of COVID-19 from November 2020 to January 2021 and the
emergence of highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 variants, sparked a policy debate on whether to
vaccinate more individuals with the first dose of available vaccines and delay the second dose, or
to continue with the recommended two-dose series as tested in clinical trials. We developed an
agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission to compare the impact of these two vaccination
strategies, while varying the temporal waning of vaccine efficacy following the first dose and the
level of pre-existing immunity in the population. Our results show that for Moderna vaccines, a
delay of at least 9 weeks could maximize vaccination program effectiveness and avert at least an
additional 17.3 (95% CrI: 7.8 - 29.7) infections, 0.71 (95% CrI: 0.52 - 0.97) hospitalizations,
and 0.34 (95% CrI: 0.25 - 0.44) deaths per 10,000 population compared to the recommended 4week interval between the two doses. Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines also averted an additional 0.61
(95% CrI: 0.37 - 0.89) hospitalizations and 0.31 (95% CrI: 0.23 - 0.45) deaths per 10,000
population in a 9-week delayed second dose strategy compared to the 3-week recommended
schedule between doses. However, there was no clear advantage of delaying the second dose
with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in reducing infections, unless the efficacy of the first dose did

and durability of vaccine-induced protection after the first dose in order to determine the optimal
time interval between the two doses.

Introduction
The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has ravaged global health and suppressed
economic activity despite the range of mitigation measures implemented by countries worldwide
[1]. A number of vaccines, including those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and
Oxford-AstraZeneca, have received emergency use authorization from regulatory bodies in
different countries [2]. Clinical trials and evaluations of mass vaccination campaigns have
demonstrated that these vaccines can provide high levels of protection against symptomatic and
severe disease with two doses administered three to four weeks apart [3–6]. In contrast to the
remarkable speed of development, vaccine delivery has proven to be challenging due to supply
shortages and limited distribution capacity in several countries [7,8].
The emergence of novel, more contagious SARS-CoV-2 variants in several countries [9–13], and
the potential for their widespread transmission have led to a public health conundrum regarding
whether to vaccinate more individuals with the first dose of available vaccines and delay the
second dose, or to prioritize completion of the two-dose series based on tested schedules in
clinical trials [14–17]. Broader population-level protection against COVID-19 in a delayed
second dose (DSD) strategy, even with lower individual-level efficacy from the first dose in the
short term, may improve the impact of vaccination compared to the recommended two-dose
strategy that provides more complete protection to a smaller subset of the population [14,17].
However, the conditions under which this improvement is achievable remain unexamined [18],
such as the durability of first-dose efficacy and protection against infection [19–21].
Here, we employed an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission and vaccination to
compare the epidemiological impact of tested and DSD vaccination schedules, considering a
range of pre-existing immunity accrued since the emergence of COVID-19. We determined the
optimal timing for administering the second dose based on vaccine efficacy estimated in clinical
trials and population-level studies following first and second doses [3,4,6,22–24]. For Moderna’s
two-dose vaccine, we show that a DSD strategy would outperform the recommended interval
between doses in terms of reducing the number of hospitalizations and deaths. The maximum
benefits would be achieved with a delay of at least 9 weeks from the recommended schedule for
administering the second dose. A DSD strategy with Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines is comparatively
inferior to Moderna vaccines, and the delay to achieve maximum benefits depends on the
durability of the first-dose efficacy.

Methods
Model structure
We extended our previous model of agent-based COVID-19 transmission to include vaccination
[25]. The model encapsulates the natural history of COVID-19 with classes of individuals
including: susceptible; vaccinated; latently infected (not yet infectious); asymptomatic (and
infectious); pre-symptomatic (and infectious); symptomatic with either mild or severe illness;
recovered; and dead. Model population was stratified into six age groups of 0-4, 5-19, 20-49, 5064, 65-79, and 80+ years based on United States (US) census data [26]. We sampled daily
contacts within and between age groups from a negative-binomial distribution parameterized
using an empirically-determined contact network (Appendix, Table A1) [27].
Disease dynamics
In our agent-based model, the risk of infection for people susceptible to COVID-19 depended on
contact with infectious individuals that could be in asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, or
symptomatic stages of the disease. Using recent estimates, we parameterized the infectivity of
asymptomatic, mild symptomatic, and severe symptomatic individuals to be 26%, 44%, and 89%
relative to the pre-symptomatic stage [28–30]. For each infected individual, the incubation period
was sampled from a Gamma distribution with a mean of 5.2 days [31]. A proportion of infected
individuals developed symptomatic disease following a pre-symptomatic stage. The duration of
the pre-symptomatic stage and infectious period following symptom onset was sampled from a
Gamma distribution with a mean of 2.3 days and 3.2 days, respectively [29,32,33]. Those who
did not develop symptomatic disease remained asymptomatic until recovery, with an infectious
period that was sampled from a Gamma distribution with a mean of 5 days [33,34]. We assumed
that recovered individuals are immune against reinfection for the remainder of simulation
timelines. Model parameters are summarized in Appendix, Table A2.
Infection outcomes
A proportion of severe symptomatic cases were hospitalized within 2-5 days of symptom onset
[25,35], and thereafter did not contribute to the spread of infection. We assumed that all mild
symptomatic cases and severely ill individuals self-isolated within 24 hours of symptom onset.
The daily number of contacts during self-isolation was reduced by an average of 74%, based on a
matrix derived from a representative sample population during COVID-19 lockdown [36]. NonICU and ICU admissions were parameterized based on age-stratified data for COVID-19
hospitalizations, and the presence of comorbidities [37,38]. The lengths of non-ICU and ICU
stays were sampled from Gamma distributions with means of 12.4 and 14.4 days, respectively
[39,40].

We implemented a two-dose vaccination campaign, and simulated a rollout strategy with a daily
rate of 30 vaccine doses per 10,000 population, corresponding to 1 million vaccine doses per day
for the entire US population. This rate corresponds to the goal of administering ~100 million
vaccine doses in the first 100 days, as outlined by the Biden administration [33]. As an additional
scenario, we extended our analysis to a daily vaccination rate of 45 doses per 10,000 population,
corresponding to 1.5 million daily doses in the US. In all scenarios, prioritization was
sequentially set to: (i) healthcare workers (5% of the total population) [41], adults with
comorbidities, and those aged 65 and older; and (ii) other individuals aged 18-64 [42]. We
assumed that the maximum achievable coverage was 95% among healthcare workers and those
aged 65 and older. This maximum coverage was set to 70% among other age groups, with an
age-dependent distribution (Appendix, Table A3).
For Moderna vaccines, the interval between the first and second doses in the recommended
schedule (i.e., tested in clinical trials) was 28 days [3]. This interval was 21 days for PfizerBioNTech vaccines [4]. Vaccine coverage of the entire population with two doses under the
recommended schedules reached 51% and 76% for Moderna, and 52% and 77% for PfizerBioNTech with vaccination rates of 30 and 45 doses per day, respectively, within one year.
We performed a review of published studies and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
briefing documents on the efficacy of Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in preventing
infection, symptomatic disease, and severe disease [3,4,6,22–24]. We extracted reported
estimates for vaccine efficacies and associated timelines, as presented in Figure 1. These
estimates indicate no statistically significant difference between the protection of vaccinated and
unvaccinated cohorts for the first 10-14 days following the first dose of vaccines.

In order to evaluate the impact of vaccination with DSD relative to the tested schedules in
clinical trials, in the base-case scenario, we assumed that the efficacy of the first dose for both
Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines would be maintained for up to 18 weeks without a
second dose. As a sensitivity analysis, we considered a waning rate of 5% per week for first-dose
se
vaccine efficacy starting from week 7 after the first dose. We assumed that the full two-dose
efficacy was achieved regardless of delay in the administration of the second dose from the
recommended schedule [43]. We simulated the model with the mean, lower bound, and upper
bound of the 95% CIs for vaccine efficacy of the first and second doses against infection,
symptomatic disease, and severe disease.

We considered a range of 10%-30% pre-existing immunity (i.e., seropositivity prior to
vaccination) in the population, with 20% for the base-case scenario [44,45]. To parameterize the
model at a given level of pre-existing immunity, we ran simulations in the absence of
vaccination, and derived the infection rates in different age groups once the overall attack rate
reached the pre-specified level. The corresponding age distributions of recovered (i.e., immune
against reinfection) individuals were used for the initial population at the start of vaccination. We
simulated the model with a 10,000 population for a time horizon of one year to evaluate the
impact of DSD vaccination compared with the recommended schedule of 28-day interval for
Moderna vaccines and 21-day interval for Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines. For the results presented
here, outcomes of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths were averaged over 1000 independent
replications of each scenario. Credible intervals (CrI) at the 5% significance level were generated
using the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap method (with 500 replications).

Results
DSD vaccination without waning efficacy of the first dose
When the efficacy of the first dose did not wane for up to 18 weeks after being administered, we
found that the DSD strategy with the daily rate of 30 vaccine doses per 10,000 population
averted more infections, hospitalizations, and deaths, compared to the recommended schedules
for both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines (Figure 2). The largest reduction of severe
outcomes was achieved with a 12-15 week delay in administering the second dose. At 20% preexisting immunity, for example, a 12-week DSD strategy with mean efficacy of Moderna
vaccines would avert an additional 0.85 (95% CrI: 0.62 - 1.07) hospitalizations and 0.41 (95%
CrI: 0.33 - 0.52) deaths per 10,000 population, compared to the recommended vaccination
schedule (Figure 2B-2C). We observed similar benefits of a DSD strategy for Pfizer-BioNTech
vaccines, averting 0.74 (95% CrI: 0.48 - 1.04) hospitalizations and 0.41 (95% CrI: 0.31 - 0.54)
deaths per 10,000 population in a 12-week delay scenario. As the daily number of vaccine doses
increases, the maximum benefits of a DSD strategy in averting hospitalizations and deaths would
be achieved with a shorter delay in administering the second dose (Figure 2E-2F).
When simulating the model with upper bounds of vaccine efficacy, we found that the benefits of
a DSD strategy in terms of reducing infections, hospitalizations, and deaths were comparable to
those obtained in scenarios with mean efficacy for both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines
(Appendix, Figure A1). However, when vaccine efficacy was at the lower bounds of estimated
ranges, there was no clear advantage with a DSD strategy compared to the recommended
schedules in terms of reducing infections (Appendix, Figure A2). While both vaccines averted
more hospitalizations and deaths in a DSD strategy, Moderna vaccines outperformed PfizerBioNTech vaccines in all scenarios of pre-existing immunity at the lower bounds of vaccine
efficacy. The largest reduction of severe outcomes was achieved with a 9-15 week delay in the
second dose (Appendix, Figure A2). These benefits are due to the prioritization of elderly and

We found that Moderna vaccines in a DSD strategy averted more infections compared to the
recommended schedule of 28 days between doses (Figure 3). However, there was no advantage
of DSD using Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in reducing infections. Both vaccines averted more
hospitalizations and deaths with DSD. The largest reduction of hospitalizations and deaths using
Moderna vaccines was still achieved with a 12-15 week delay in administering the second dose.
With Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, the highest benefits in reducing the same outcomes would be
attained with a shorter delay of 6-12 weeks in a DSD strategy. Overall, Moderna vaccines
outperformed Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines with regards to achieving the maximum benefits with a
DSD strategy. For example, with 20% pre-existing immunity and a daily vaccination rate of 30
doses, Moderna vaccines averted an additional 0.72 (95% CrI: 0.54 - 0.96) hospitalizations per
10,000 population with a 12-week DSD strategy (Figure 3B). For Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, this
maximum benefit was achieved with a 9-week DSD which averted 0.44 (95% CrI: 0.16 - 0.72)
hospitalizations. Similarly, we projected that Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines would
avert an additional 0.39 (95% CrI: 0.29 - 0.49) and 0.26 (95% CrI: 0.16 - 0.39) deaths per 10,000
population with a 12-week delay of administering the second dose, respectively (Figure 3C).
When the daily vaccination rate increased to 45 doses, we observed similar outcomes of a DSD
strategy with Moderna vaccines outperforming Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in the corresponding
scenarios (Figure 3D-3F). The largest benefits of Moderna vaccines in terms of averting
hospitalizations and deaths were achieved with a shorter delay of 9-12 weeks in administering
the second dose, but still outperformed those obtained using Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in all
scenarios of pre-existing immunity (Figure 3E,3F).
When simulating the model with upper bounds of vaccine efficacy with waning, we found that
the performance of a DSD strategy in terms of reducing infections, hospitalizations, and deaths
was qualitatively similar to those obtained in scenarios with mean efficacy for both Moderna and
Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines (Appendix, Figure A5). However, when vaccine efficacy was at the
lower bounds of estimated ranges, the impact of a DSD strategy was reduced significantly in
both vaccines (Appendix, Figure A6). There was no advantage in reducing infections with DSD
compared to the recommended schedules. We found that, while the performance of a DSD
strategy in averting hospitalization and deaths depends on the level of pre-existing immunity,
Moderna vaccines still outperformed Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines in most scenarios of pre-existing
immunity with a delay of longer than 6 weeks from the recommended schedules (Appendix,
Figure A6).

population in a DSD vaccination program compared to the recommended schedule of two-doses
of Moderna (with a 28-day interval) and Pfizer-BioNTech (with a 21-day interval) vaccines. Thee
daily vaccination rate was (A,B,C) 30 doses and (D,E,F) 45 doses per 10,000 population.
Vaccine efficacy was set to the mean of estimated ranges (Figure 1), and the waning rate of firstdose efficacy was 5% per week, starting from week 7 after the first dose prior to the
administration of the second dose.

Discussion
Vaccination can have a substantial impact on mitigating COVID-19 outbreaks [46]. However,
vaccine distribution in the US did not meet the initial goal set by federal officials due to

significant shortfalls in distribution [47]. Challenges with vaccine supply and rollout, coupled
with a deadly wave of outbreaks that overwhelmed hospitals [48–50], and the emergence of
highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants [12,51,52], sparked a debate as to whether available
vaccines should be used to rapidly increase the coverage with the first dose [14–17], or be
distributed according to tested schedules. While the US has committed to delivering the second
dose on time for those who receive the first dose [53], a few countries have approved guidelines
for DSD, including UK and Canada to defer the second dose by up to 12 and 16 weeks,
respectively [54,55].
In this study, we evaluated whether deferral of the second dose beyond the recommended
schedules of 3 and 4 weeks for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, respectively, could
improve the effectiveness of vaccination programs in reducing infections, hospitalizations, and
deaths. We found that if the efficacy of the first dose did not wane until the administration of the
second dose, then the DSD strategy will be more effective than the recommended schedules for
both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, achieving maximum benefits with a delay of 1215 weeks. If the efficacy of the first dose wanes over time, our results show that delaying the
second dose of Moderna vaccines could prevent more infections, hospitalizations, and deaths
compared to the recommended 4-week interval between the two doses. The maximum benefits
for averting severe outcomes were achieved with a DSD of 9-15 weeks. A DSD strategy with
Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines beyond the 3-week tested schedule, on the other hand, may lead to a
higher number of infections compared to the recommended schedule, if the first-dose efficacy
waned over time. However, depending on the level of pre-existing immunity, additional
hospitalizations and deaths could be averted with DSD as a result of vaccine prioritization for
individuals at higher risk of severe outcomes. While our study aimed to compare the outcomes of
vaccination between the recommended schedules and DSD, we note that the reduction in disease
burden by DSD strategy would be even higher when compared to a scenario of no vaccination.
Our results are based on available evidence and estimated vaccine efficacy in published studies
of clinical trials, FDA briefing documents, and vaccination campaigns [3,4,6,22–24]. Key data
on the durability of vaccine-induced immunity following the first (if the second dose is delayed)
and second doses, and the rate of temporal decline of immunity post-vaccination are still lacking.
Our model assumptions were conservative and based on limited empirical evidence available
thus far. For example, in the base-case scenario, we assumed that the estimated protection
efficacy of vaccines against infection and symptomatic/severe disease remained intact until the
administration of the second dose. Further, we assumed that the protection efficacies after two
doses in a DSD strategy will be the same as those estimated with two doses in schedules tested in
clinical trials. As sensitivity analyses, we also considered scenarios in which vaccine efficacy of
the first dose waned over time when the second dose was delayed. Currently, there are no data
that quantify the decline of vaccine-induced immunity under different schedules of a DSD
strategy. However, as clinical investigations on vaccine performance continue and more

estimates on population-wide effectiveness of vaccination campaigns become available, our
assumptions may need to be revised. Should any future evidence alter these assumptions, further
analyses would be warranted and conclusions of our study might change.
Our findings highlight two important parameters in the evaluation of vaccination programs with
DSD. First and foremost is the durability of vaccine efficacy [20,21], which requires clinical and
epidemiological studies monitoring vaccinated individuals for several weeks after inoculation
with the first dose. Second is the ability of vaccines to block transmission. In addition to these
parameters, vaccine supply and many other factors such as the potential for the emergence of
vaccine-resistant strains under low individual-level protection; public confidence in vaccines;
risk behaviour of individuals following vaccination; and the possibility of a drop in uptake of the
second dose with a delay significantly longer than the recommended schedules, would be
important considerations in public health decision-making regarding DSD vaccination [19].
However, given the relatively high vaccine efficacies estimated after the first dose against severe
outcomes (i.e., over 50% in most end-points), broader population-level protection would be
expected to further reduce the disease burden, even with limited vaccine supplies in the near
term. When racing against a burgeoning outbreak, our results show that prioritizing vaccine
coverage with rapid distribution of the first dose would be critical to mitigating adverse
outcomes and allow the healthcare system to also address non-COVID-19 medical needs of the
population. In the case of low incidence, it would still be important to accelerate vaccination
with the first dose to protect the maximum number of individuals ahead of any outbreak surge.
