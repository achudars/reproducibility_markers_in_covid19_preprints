Abstract
With the rapid development of mobile Internet in China, the information of the
epidemic is full-time and holographic, and the role of information diffusion in
epidemic control is increasingly prominent. At the same time, the publicity of all
kinds of big data also provides the possibility to explore the impact of media
information diffusion on disease transmission. This paper explores the mechanism of
the influence of information diffusion on the spread of the novel coronavirus,
develops a model of the interaction between information diffusion and disease
transmission based on the SIR model, and empirically tests the role and mechanism of
information diffusion in the spread of COCID-19 by using econometric method. The
result shows that there was a significant negative correlation between the information
diffusion and the spread of the novel coronavirus; The result of robust test shows that
the spread of both epidemic information and protection information hindered the
further spread of the epidemic.
Key words: COVID-19, information diffusion, urban centrality

1.Introduction
Since December 2019, a number of cases of viral pneumonia with unknown causes
have been found in Wuhan, which has been confirmed as the novel coronavirus 2019
(hereinafter referred to as COVID-19). Despite strict interventions such as isolation
treatment and traffic control, the epidemic spread rapidly to all provinces and cities in
the country at an unprecedented rate. As of February 25, 2020, according to the
reports of 31 provinces (autonomous regions, Municipality) and Xinjiang Production
and Construction Corps, a total of 77271 confirmed cases, 3434 suspected cases, 2596
death, and 25065 cured cases have been reported. This is another major public health
emergency in China after the attack of the SARS virus in 2003.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19 occurred around the Spring Festival, the scale of
population movement was large and the frequency was high, which also increased the

difficulty of epidemic prevention and control. In order to prevent the spread of the
epidemic, the central government has taken unprecedented prevention and control
measures, including setting up designated admission hospitals, expanding the supply
of beds in the hospital, coordinating the dispatch of medical prevention and control
materials, extending the Spring Festival holiday, implementing peak staggering return,
measuring the temperature of vehicles and stations, disinfecting, ventilating, etc. The
National Health Commission has also sent a number of supervision teams to hospitals
and disease control agencies to conduct on-site supervision. Wuhan also announced
the closure of the city on January 23, suspending urban public transport and strictly
controlling the access of people inside and outside Wuhan. Subsequently, 31
provinces, regions and cities in the country successively launched the level 1
emergency response to public health emergencies, strictly controlled the transmission
of the virus, and made every effort to prevent the further spread of the epidemic.
At the early stage of the epidemic (December 31 to January 20), due to the lack of
public reports in Wuhan's official media, the information of the epidemic was mainly
disclosed by the media, so the epidemic was not paid attention by the public, which
delayed the best time to expand the social impact, thus leading to the further spread of
the epidemic. After January 20, with the outbreak of the epidemic and the release of
information, COVID-19 epidemic information became the most concerned
information of the public, and media reports entered a white-hot stage. The emergence
of the novel coronavirus pneumonia has also caused widespread panic among the
public. The official media, micro-blog, WeChat and other media have followed up the
reports of real-time epidemic, new symptoms and prevention measures, and timely
conveyed clear and positive information to the society and advised the public to
protect themselves and to view the epidemic more objectively and objectively. Will
the information diffusion help to eliminate rumors and guide the public to do a good
job in protection and further inhibit the spread of the epidemic? Therefore,
understanding the impact of information diffusion on epidemic transmission can help
improve the prediction of epidemics and find preventive measures to slow down the
spread of diseases.
Therefore, this paper studies the problems above. The innovation points of the
research are as follows: First, combing the epidemic theory, complex network analysis
and the temporal and spatial background of the COVID-19 spread, we comb the
mechanism of epidemic transmission; Second, we use econometric method to conduct
a regress, and get the basic conclusion that information diffusion can effectively
reduce the spread of COVID-19; third, using big data mining technology, Baidu
search index, Baidu population migration, prevention and control data during the
epidemic were mined through Baidu and government information websites at all
levels.
The remaining sections of the paper are as follows: the second section combs the
research literature and puts forward the hypothesis; the third section is the research
design, which describes the model construction, data source, main variable calculation,
and statistical description; the fourth section is empirical analysis. The fifth section is
a conclusion and discussion.

2.Literature Review and Hypotheses
2.1 Literature Review
Since the beginning of the 21st century, due to the outbreak of SARS, avian influenza,
novel H1N1 influenza and Ebola cross the world, the public has been increasingly
concerned about the emerging infectious diseases, and the problem of disease
transmission has been widely studied (Mao & Yang, 2012). In general, the spread of
an epidemic is considered to be a dynamic process in which the disease passes from
one individual to another through contact between individuals on the contact network
(kleczkowski et al., 2011). Disease transmission often occurs in a dynamic social
environment, and individual health behavior decision-making is guided by cultural
norms, peer behavior and media reports (Kim et al., 2019). Although vaccination is a
major strategy to protect individuals from infection, the development, testing and
production of new vaccines often take a long time (stohr &amp; esveld, 2004). Before
getting enough vaccines, the best protection for individuals is to take preventive
actions, such as wearing masks, washing hands frequently, taking drugs, avoiding
contact with patients, etc. (Centers for Disease Control and prevention, 2008). The
historical experience of SARS tells us that effective national control measures, such
as early identification and isolation of SARS cases, tracking and isolation of the
contacts, screening of travelers, and raising public awareness of risk, can help to
contain the spread of the virus (Ahmad et al., 2009).
As the public gradually realized the importance of personal behavior in preventing the
spread of infection, researchers began to explore the mathematical model of disease
transmission including personal behavior. These models have been used to guide
strategies for disease transmission control (vardavas et al., 2007) and quantify the role
of individual protective measures in controlling several outbreaks, including the Ebola
virus outbreak in West Africa in 2014 (fast et al., 2007), the SARS outbreak in Hong
Kong in 2003 (Riley, 2003) and the H1N1 outbreak in central Mexico in 2009
(springborn et al., 2007). Saunders et al. (2017) also tested the effectiveness of
personal protective measures in preventing the spread of pandemic influenza in
humans. Recently, the research on the outbreak of COVID-19 from the perspective of
transmission dynamics is also increasing. Sun et al. (2020) evaluated the

epidemiological trend of COVID-19 based on the public epidemic data, and studied
the outbreak progress in all parts of China.
Understanding the impact of the media on the spread of the disease can help improve
the prediction of epidemics and identify preventive measures to slow the spread of the
disease. Many models also link the disease-related media transmission with the
protection function, usually assuming that the influence of media will reduce the
effective transmission rate and slow down the spread of diseases. These studies
indicate that the impact of media increases with the number of people infected (Sun et
al., 2011; Liu et al., 2007; Cui et al., 2008), or both with the number and the rate of
change (tchuenche &amp; bauch, 2012; Xiao et al., 2015). When the number of cases
is high or the prevalence of diseases increases rapidly, the information diffusion slows
down the spread of diseases and creates interesting disease transmission dynamics,
such as multi-wave outbreaks (Liu et al., 2007; Cui et al., 2008). However, it is not
clear whether the media function formalization proposed by the model fully reflects
the actual influence. The choice of media function directly affects the form of disease
transmission, making the accurate parameterization of the media is the key (collison
et al., 2014).
However, most of the current researches only focus on the development of the disease
itself on the complex network, as well as the impact of protective measures on the
spread of the disease. There are relatively few studies on the spread of
disease-related information, and only a few of them are carried out through numerical
simulation with the preconditions which are too idealized and too dependent on the
setting of parameters. In addition, the model has just begun to consider how to
combine the data from actual media reports (collison et al., 2015), lacking the
econometric analysis based on real-time data. In decade years, China's Internet has
experienced unprecedented development, various online social media based on the
Internet (such as major search engines, social networking sites, news sites, etc.) have
been integrated into people's daily life, providing a broad platform for the
dissemination of various information. Compared with the outbreak of SARS in 2003,
the economic link between regions are increasingly close, and during the Spring
Festival in China, the population flow is more frequent. Although the government has
taken unprecedented measures to prevent and control the epidemic, and the official
media and social media have timely released the latest epidemic information, the
actual effect needs to be further tested. By combing and integrating the existing
literature, we propose the hypothesis that information diffusion is helpful to curb the
spread of new coronavirus.
2.2 Hypothesis
As shown in the figure 2, there is a clear correlation between the COVID-19-related
information and the spread of the epidemic. This indicates that it is feasible to study
the development of the epidemic through the Network public opinion information.
Further, we visualized the geographic distribution of the epidemic and information (as
shown in figure 3). Overall, there is a correlation between the two. It can be seen that
the place with the most public opinion information is actually not the place where the
epidemic is the most serious (such as Hubei Province, but it does not rule out that the

epidemic area has no time to process the information), but the first-tier provinces such
as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong (The situation in these cities is still severe, but it
is relatively stable compared to Hubei Province). Therefore, this article proposes a
hypothesis: the spread of epidemic information will inhibit the spread of the epidemic.

Information in China (February 10)

2.3 Analysis of Mechanism
The mechanism of the influence of information dissemination on the spread of
COVID-19 is as follows:
When a disease spreads among people, information about the disease spreads
immediately. In the early days of the outbreak, a small amount of information spread,
mainly about the popular science of the virus and the current infection dynamics. The
information has improved the public's awareness of the virus. Many people choose to
continue to pay attention to the epidemic-related information, and respond faster when
the outbreak later occurs, reducing the probability of infection.
In the stage of the outbreak, information about it will also be spread on major social
media. When individuals learn about the existence of the disease, they will change
their behavior, such as wearing a mask and vaccinating to avoid being infected, which
can have an impact on the spread of the disease. The susceptible (or infected person)
who knows the information of the epidemic will break the connection with the around
infected person (or susceptible person) in order to prevent the further spread of the

disease.
After receiving the epidemic-related information, governments at all levels also
quickly launched emergency plans, and gradually adopted a series of measures such
as early identification and isolation, traveler screening, closing of public places, and
even “lockdown” the cities in accordance with the deterioration of the epidemic to
limit traffic and population flow, greatly reducing further transmission of the

3.Methodology
3.1 Model Construction
In the current literature, models of disease transmission and behavioral spread have
been developed for decades, all are based on human networks ((Deffuant, Huet &
Amblard, 2005; Keeling & Eames, 2005). However, few people committed to
combining information diffusion and human behavior, considering these two
interactive processes. In fact, when a disease-related information spreads among
people, people will naturally take some precautionary measures to counteract it,
which in turn limits the spread of the disease.
In order to study the impact of information diffusion on epidemic outbreaks, this
paper draws on the conceptual framework of Mao & Yang (2012) to develop a model
of the interaction between disease and information. We divided the population into
two categories according to their health status: the susceptible (S) and the (I);
according to the level of information obtained, they were divided into two categories:
conscious (+) and unconscious (-). Therefore, the population in the entire society can
be divided into four states: (1) S−: unconscious susceptible; (2) S +: conscious
susceptible; (3) I−: unconscious infected; (4) I +: conscious infected. As shown in the
figure 5, the transmission process of COVID-19 including the information diffusion is
proposed. The entire propagation process of the model is described as follows:

Figure 5 Schematic Diagram of COVID-19 Spread and Information Diffusion

Information diffusion: In this process, the Internet and other media reported
epidemic-related information on a large scale. Some unconscious individuals in the
susceptible (

1 ) received the information and became conscious individuals; and

some of the unconscious individuals in the infected (

 2 ) received the information and

become conscious individual.
Spread of the COVID: In this process, unconsciously susceptible people (S-) are
infected with the virus with probability  , while consciously susceptible people
usually take self-protection measures such as wearing a mask, reducing going out,
disinfection, etc. so they are infected with the probability of  (    ); due to
isolation treatment for the infected patients, they (I− and I +) pass the disease to
surrounding susceptible (S + and S−) with the same probability of transmission  .
Since the reinfection process after recovery of patients with COVID-19 is not
clear,here we don’t take it into consideration.
Therefore, the information diffusion can reduce the spread of the epidemic in two
ways. First, information diffusion will cause some conscious and susceptible people
(  S + ) to take proactive protective measures to prevent infection; second,
information diffusion will change some unconsciously susceptible people (

1 S  )

into consciously susceptible people, and then take protective measures to reduce some
(

1 S   ) infection.

According to the hypothesis above, the empirical model of the influence of
information diffusion on the spread of COVID-19 is as follow:
XGBDij =  1searchij   2 X ij  i   j   ij

Where，i denotes date ， j denotes city； XGBD is the spread of COVID-19，which
is measured by the number of cumulative and newly confirmed cases published by the

3.2 Data Resource
In order to quantitatively explore the relationship between the spread of the
COVID-19 and information diffusion, we first visited the Baidu Index website
through Python to obtain the Baidu search index2 of the keywords related to the
epidemic during the outbreak from January 19 to February 10, 2020 to measure the
level of information diffusion. The data of infected case during the corresponding
period mainly come from the daily epidemic data released by the National Health
Commission. The self-control and traffic control data come from the public
information of each city's Health Commission website and government website on
taking preventive and control measures, and they are scored uniformly according to
the degree of control, and the corresponding values are added up. The national
migration data and Wuhan's outflow data come from Baidu Migration. The control
variables at the city level come from China City Statistical Yearbook. In addition,
cities without outbreaks were also excluded. After collation, 6417 observations from
301 cities were finally obtained.
3.3 variable description and measures
Coronavirus transmission ( XGBD ): The number of the infected in this article is used
to indicate the transmission of the virus. After the outbreak of the epidemic, the
National Health Commission provided daily outbreak data. Therefore, we have
compiled a list of the daily number of cumulative and newly confirmed in
prefecture-level cities from January 19 to February 10, 2020.
Information diffusion ( search ): The main explanatory variable---information
diffusion in this paper is measured by the number of searches for epidemic-related
information by the national people every day during the epidemic. Different from the
media data (***) used in previous studies as the level of information diffusion, the
search index can better reflect people's acceptance of information diffusion. Therefore,
based on the search services provided by Baidu Index, six epidemic-related terms of
"the novel coronavirus", "pneumonia", "Zhong Nanshan", "pneumonia symptoms",
"masks" and "correct wearing of masks" were selected as search terms, and the search
index during the epidemic period (January 19-February 10) was crawled by Python,
and the daily level of information diffusion of prefecture-level cities was summed up.
In addition, the search index is divided into two categories, one is about the

Keywords: the novel coronavirus, pneumonia, Zhong Nanshan, symptoms of pneumonia, masks, and
correct wearing of masks.

information on epidemic with "the novel coronavirus, pneumonia, Zhong Nanshan"
( search1 ), and the other is about the protection with "pneumonia symptoms, correct
wearing of masks and masks" ( search 2 ).

Figure 5 Distribution of Search Index of prefecture-level administrative units in China
(February 10)
Traffic Control ( traf _ con ) and Self-control ( self _ seg ): This paper collects,
summarizes and collates the epidemic prevention and control mechanisms published
by the Emergency Command of the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and
Control in each province and city, mainly including traffic control and self-control.
According to these preventive and control measures taken by all prefectural
administrative regions in the country, they are classified and scored into 15 items (see
Table 1), each with a score of 1, starting from the time when each measure is
implemented until the measure is cancelled. For example, Shanghai began to
implement the "isolation of close contacts of confirmed patients" for 14 days on
January 21. Since this measure belongs to "social isolation", the "social isolation"
score of Shanghai was 1 from January 21. On January 24, Shanghai began to
implement the "partial cessation of public places in the city", then the "social
isolation" was added 1 point from January 24, and so on. Finally, traffic control was
carried out separately. The scores of each measure of social alienation were summed
up.
Population Flow ( migration ): As the epidemic occurred during the Spring Festival
Movement in China, the large-scale population flow provided favorable conditions for
the spread of the virus, and reasonable control of population flow helped to slow
down the spread of the epidemic. Baidu Migration Big Data provides a migration
index that reflects the scale of population migration into or out, and is comparable
between cities. Therefore, the migration indexes of population moving in and out of
prefecture-level cities were obtained respectively during the epidemic respectively
and the indicators reflecting the overall population flow status of the city were
summed up.

other cities to represent the population inflow in Wuhan; (2) GDP per capita ( pergdp ). GDP per

4.1 Benchmark regression
According to the econometric model constructed above, benchmark regression was
performed by controlling time and urban fixed effects separately. Column (1) in Table
3 performed a direct regression on the spread of information and the spread of the
COVID-19, and the results were statistically significant and negative. Column (2)
showed results when added traffic control and personal control variables. Column (3)
showed the results after adding further variables such as population flow, Wuhan
inflow, and GDP per capita based on column (2). The regression results are also
statistically significant and negative. This indicates that after controlling other factors
affecting the COVID-19, the spread of information has significantly reduced the
spread of COVID-19 in the country. The regression coefficients of traffic control and
personal control were significantly negative, indicating that after implementing a

first-level response measures such as urban traffic control, segregated observation,
and closed communities adopted by local governments were significantly effective,
reducing the spread of the COVID-19. In terms of variables reflecting population
migration, the coefficient of urban population migration variable is significantly
negative, indicating that the decrease in population inflows and outflows has also
reduced the spread of COVID-19; the coefficient of Wuhan population inflow
variables is significantly positive, indicating that the population inflow in Wuhan has
accelerated the spread of the virus to a certain extent.
Wuhan is the place where the disease first spread on a large scale. The timing of the
initial confirmed cases is unknown, and the lack of medical equipment and supplies
after the outbreak has caused the number of confirmed cases to be lower than the
actual number of confirmed cases. Therefore, in column (4), we exclude the data of
Wuhan City, and the regression results are still stable.

In order to learn more about the impact of information diffusion on the spread of
COVID-19, this article divides the information represented by the Baidu search index
into two categories. One is information on COVID-19 that the public desires to know
(Search 1). The other is the self-protection information (search2) during the epidemic
search by the public in order to prevent themselves from being infected by the virus.
Columns (1) and (2) in Table 4 are the results of robustness test which shows the
impacts of the spread of epidemic information on the spread of COVID-19, the
regression coefficients are significantly negative. Columns (3) and (4) are the results
of robustness test which shows the impacts of the self-protection information
diffusion on the spread of COVID-19, and the regression coefficients are also
significantly negative. It shows that both the spread of virus information and
self-protection information has hindered the further spread of the COVID-19.

The data released by the National Health and Construction Commission includes the
daily number of newly diagnosed patients, which can better reflect the spread of the
epidemic every day. Therefore, we use the new confirmed number instead of the
cumulative confirmed number in the previous model for further robustness testing.
The regression results when use the comprehensive search index in column (2) in
Table 5 are significantly negative, and the regression results when use the search
index of disease information and protection information in column (3) and column (4)
are also significantly negative, this further indicats that the regression results are
robust and the spread of information can reduce the spread of the COVID-19.

5. Conclusions and discussions
5.1 Conclusion
This paper draws on the model of behavioral dynamics, uses econometric methods
and high-frequency data such as new coronavirus epidemic data published by the
National Health and Medical Commission, Baidu search index and Baidu migration
index to explore the relationship between information diffusion and the spread of
COVID-19 Relationship. Studies show that: Firstly, after fixing time and cities and
controlling other variables that affect the spread of New Coronavirus, the spread of
information significantly reduces the spread of COVID-19. After excluding Wuhan
from the sample, the regression results are still robust. Secondly, two robustness tests
of information classification and new confirmed diagnoses show that both the spread
of epidemic information and self-protection information have significantly reduced
the further spread of the COVID-19. This shows that when the epidemic occurs, the
timely and accurate spread of information plays an important role in the prevention
and control of the epidemic.
5.2 Discussion
Excessive and inaccurate spread of epidemic information may also bring unexpected
counter-effects, such as causing panic among the people, causing snatching of living
materials, and curbing economic activities. Therefore, while information diffusion has
played a role in the practice of epidemic prevention and control, it may be possible to
take interventions to reduce the adverse effects. This article puts forward the
following suggestions: (1) The government convenes a press conference in a timely
manner to disclose the epidemic situation information and make the information
transmission more transparent. The state-run media played a role of weathervane, they
need to timely follow up the epidemic report to let public learn about the virus. (2) Do
a good job of information management and control. Official authority, hospital and
well-known experts need to timely deny a rumor for various purposes to avoid
unhealthy social impact. (3) In view of the differences in urban and rural internet
penetration rates, governments at all levels need to issue official documents timely to
transfer information to rural areas.
