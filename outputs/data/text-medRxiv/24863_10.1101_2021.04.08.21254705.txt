ABSTRACT

28

Background: Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 are a promising treatment for

29

limiting the progression of COVID-19 and decreasing strain on hospitals. Their use, however, remains

30

limited, particularly in disadvantaged populations.

31
32

Methods: Electronic health records were reviewed from SARS-CoV-2 patients at a single medical center

33

in the United States that initiated mAb infusions in January 2021 with the support of the U.S. Department

34

of Health and Human Services’ National Disaster Medical System. Patients who received mAbs were

35

compared to untreated patients from the time period before mAb availability who met eligibility criteria

36

for mAb treatment. We used logistic regression to measure the effect of mAb treatment on the risk of

37

hospitalization or emergency department (E.D.) visit within 30 days of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.

38
39

Results: Of 598 COVID-19 patients, 270 (45%) received bamlanivimab and 328 (55%) were untreated.

40

Two hundred and thirty-one patients (39%) were Hispanic. Among treated patients, 5/270 (1.9%)

41

presented to the E.D. or required hospitalization within 30 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, compared

42

to 39/328 (12%) untreated patients (p<0.001). After adjusting for age, gender, and comorbidities, the risk

43

of E.D. visit or hospitalization was 82% lower in mAb-treated patients compared to untreated patients

44

(95% confidence interval [CI]: 66%-94%).

45
46

Conclusions: In this diverse, real-world COVID-19 patient population, mAb treatment significantly

47

decreased the risk of subsequent E.D. visit or hospitalization. Broader treatment with mAbs, including in

48

disadvantaged patient populations, can decrease the burden on hospitals and should be facilitated in all

49

populations in the United States to ensure health equity.

BACKGROUND

51

In late 2019, a new respiratory infection was detected in China and alarmed global health experts with its

52

growing case incidence and clinical severity [1,2]. Over the course of a few months, severe acute

53

respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread around the world, overwhelming health

54

systems. While a substantial proportion of patients remain asymptomatic [3], coronavirus disease 2019

55

(COVID-19) can rapidly progress and require hospitalization and intensive care. Severe disease is

56

associated with older age, obesity, and several chronic medical conditions including cardiovascular,

57

kidney, and pulmonary comorbidities [4–7].

58
59

As of late January 2021, approximately 15,000 new COVID-19 hospital admissions were occurring per

60

day in the United States (U.S.) and hospital bed capacity exceeded 72% [8,9]. As healthcare systems

61

continued to approach maximum bed capacity, a critical need for therapeutic interventions to reduce

62

COVID-related hospitalizations emerged. Although therapeutic options for COVID-19 remain limited,

63

monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 are a promising treatment for limiting the

64

progression of disease. Four mAbs are available in the U.S. through Emergency Use Authorizations

65

(EUAs) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA): bamlanivimab monotherapy [10],

66

bamlanivimab in combination with etesevimab [11], and casirivimab in combination with imdevimab

67

[12]. These products are human IgG1 antibodies that neutralize the virus by binding the spike protein of

68

SARS-CoV-2, preventing attachment of the virus to the human cellular receptor angiotensin-converting

69

enzyme-2. A single infusion of bamlanivimab was recently demonstrated to reduce the risk of

70

hospitalization, emergency department (E.D.) visits, and death among patients with mild to moderate

71

COVID symptoms in randomized, controlled phase 2/3 trials by more than 70% [10].

72
73

Monoclonal antibodies are underutilized as a treatment for reducing severe disease and could significantly

74

decrease hospitalizations and potentially long-term COVID effects [13]. Utilization can be particularly

75

challenging in minority, disadvantaged populations, in whom prevalence of risk factors for COVID-19

76

progression and death may be higher [14]. Thus, mAb may be particularly underutilized in precisely the

77

populations that would have the greatest benefit, threatening to exacerbate existing health inequities in the

78

United States. Two primary barriers to implementation of mAb infusion therapy are: 1) a limited

79

understanding of the necessary resources and processes to mobilize infusion sites, and 2) understanding

80

the magnitude of the potential impact of mAb treatment on reducing the severity of disease. We

81

previously addressed the first barrier through a process assessment and improvement analysis [15],

82

demonstrating considerable flexibility in assembling an infusion site and the feasibility of mAb delivery

83

in diverse treatment locations. Here, we aim to determine the extent to which mAb treatment decreases

84

COVID-related hospital admission and E.D. visits among patients with mild to moderate COVID-19

85

within 30 days of treatment in the U.S..

86
87

METHODS

88

We conducted a retrospective cohort study in February 2021 of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients to

89

evaluate the effect of mAb treatment on the risk of a medical visit within 30 days. This study evaluated

90

patients who presented to a single medical center to which the U.S. Department of Health and Human

91

Services’ Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) had deployed elements of the

92

National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) to establish a mAb infusion site. This medical center is

93

located in a moderately sized city with a population of approximately 500,000. The city’s population is

94

56.4% non-White with a median household income that is 64% of the U.S. level and a poverty rate of

95

23.4% [16,17]. This clinical support activity was conducted as part of the ASPR public health response to

96

the COVID-19 pandemic and at the request of the host medical center. Under HHS Office of Health

97

Research Protection guidelines, it was judged a non-research COVID-19 response [18]. The Johns

98

Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and the medical center concurred with a non-research

99

determination.

101

The target population for this evaluation was patients with positive results of SARS-CoV-2 viral testing

102

who were 12 years of age or older, at least 40 kg in weight, and at high risk for progressing to severe

103

COVID-19 or hospitalization. Clinical data were obtained in February 2021 from electronic health

104

records maintained by the medical system, which includes both a major medical center and several

105

outpatient clinics with integrated health records.

106
107

Our retrospective cohort consisted of patients presenting to either outpatient clinics or the medical center

108

who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via an antigen or polymerase chain reaction-based test. Patients

109

with positive viral test results recorded in the electronic health record between July 1st and December 20th,

110

2020 were identified as untreated patients. These patients were eligible for inclusion in the analysis if they

111

met the eligibility criteria for mAb treatment (Table 1). Treatment with mAb became available at the

112

medical center on January 7th, 2021. SARS-CoV-2 patients who received mAb infusions between

113

January 7th and January 15th, 2021, are referred to as treated patients. We selected the test date of

114

December 20th , 2020, as the final date of eligibility for untreated patients to ensure no overlap in the

115

treated and untreated patient populations based on the maximum ten-day symptom onset window

116

permitting mAb treatment eligibility and decreased healthcare seeking behavior during winter holidays

117

[19]. The decision to seek mAb treatment for COVID-19 was made by the patient and the provider. At

118

presentation for mAb treatment, the date of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity was confirmed through paper

119

records provided by the patient or rapid antigen test performed on-site, and intake staff collected

120

demographic and clinical information, including eligibility criteria for treatment (Table 1). Any adverse

121

events were recorded on patient forms. While mAb treatments continued after January 15th, the end date

122

was established to permit sufficient follow-up at the time of data collection.

123
124

Data extracted from existing medical records included age, sex, race, ethnicity, height and weight, and

125

presence of the following pre-existing conditions as recorded by clinicians in the health record: blood

126

disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease, thalassemia), cancer, diabetes, Down syndrome, chronic lung disease,

127

chronic liver disease, hypertension, immunosuppressive condition, chronic kidney disease, obesity or

128

overweight, and organ transplant. Pre-existing conditions were captured from the Chief Complaint of

129

health records within the six months prior to the date of SARS-CoV-2 testing. Laboratory values and

130

clinical exam measurements were not extracted to define pre-existing conditions.

131
132

Race categories were defined as American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, Black, Hawaiian/Pacific

133

Islander, White, and other. Ethnicity was defined as Hispanic or Non-Hispanic. Body mass index (BMI)

134

was calculated as kilograms per meter-squared. In the absence of height and weight, the pre-existing

135

conditions of “obesity” and “overweight” were used for BMI categorization. The composite outcome of a

136

medical visit was defined as the first instance of COVID-19-related E.D. visit or hospitalization after

137

positive SARS-CoV-2 viral test result and was obtained from the electronic health record. A medical visit

138

was COVID-related if one or more of the following chief complaints were identified: blood in sputum,

139

chest congestion, chest pain, cough, COVID-19 screening, difficulty breathing, fever, flu-like symptoms,

140

hypoxia, shortness of breath, sore throat, or weakness [20–23]. Dates of COVID-19 symptom onset and

141

positive SARS-CoV-2 antigen test results performed at the infusion center were recorded on paper-based

142

forms upon arrival of patients for mAb treatment, but were not recorded in electronic health records.

143
144

Characteristics of patients were compared using Welch t-tests for continuous variables and Chi-squared

145

test for categorical variables. Age was categorized as younger than or equal to 65 years of age or older

146

than 65 years. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the effect of mAb treatment on medical visits that

147

occurred within 30 days of SARS-CoV-2-positive viral test by applying a generalized linear model with a

148

logits link function. The occurrence of a medical visit was evaluated as a binary outcome. Variables

149

included in the model were those deemed epidemiologically relevant. Model diagnostics indicated that no

150

data points substantially influenced model estimates, as assessed by Cook’s distance. All data processing

151

and analyses were conducted using R version 4.0.3 [24].

RESULTS

154

Medical records were available from 875 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients (Figure 1) confirmed during July

155

1 through December 20, 2020. Of these, 547 patients did not meet eligibility criteria for mAb treatment

156

(Figure 1). This resulted in the analysis of 598 patients, 270 of whom (45%) were eligible for and

157

received bamlanivimab during a single week in January 2021, comprising the treated group. A total of

158

328 untreated patients (55%) served as the historical comparator population. These untreated patients

159

represented individuals who would have been eligible for mAb infusion had the treatment been available

160

at the time of their COVID-19-positive viral test results.

161
162

Among the 598 patients, no statistically significant differences in sex or ethnicity were identified between

163

the treated and untreated study groups (Table 2). Untreated patients were an average of three years

164

younger than the treated patients (p=0.02), and health records were more likely to report untreated

165

patients as overweight or obese and with a history of hypertension or cardiovascular disease (all p<0.001).

166
167

In the 30 days following a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, five of 270 treated patients (1.9%) presented

168

to the E.D. or required hospitalization within 30 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, compared to

169

39 of the 328 untreated patients (12%) (p<0.01) (Table 2). Untreated patients had a medical visit a median

170

of four days after SARS-CoV-2-positive viral test result (interquartile range [IQR]: 2, 8 days), while

171

treated patients had a medical visit an average of eight days after mAb treatment (IQR: 4, 8) (p=0.112 by

172

Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). No adverse events were reported among mAb-infused patients.

173
174

Treatment with mAb was associated with an 82% decrease in the risk of a COVID-19-related medical

175

visit within 30 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2 viral test after adjusting for demographic factors and pre-

176

existing conditions (95% CI: 66%, 94%) (Table 3). A BMI ≥ 35 greatly increased the risk of a medical

177

visit in the multivariable analysis (odds ratio: 6.44 [95% CI: 2.48, 16.71]). Age ≥ 65 was also associated

178

with a 2.10-fold increased risk but this was not statistically significant (95% CI: 0.97, 4.77).

DISCUSSION

181

This study demonstrated that a single infusion of bamlanivimab within 10 days of COVID-19 symptom

182

onset decreased the risk of COVID-related hospitalization and E.D. visits among a real-world, diverse

183

patient population in the U.S. who were at risk of progression to severe disease compared with an

184

historical untreated population. The association between treatment and improved clinical outcome

185

remained significant after controlling for gender, age, race, ethnicity, and pre-existing conditions. A BMI

186

of greater than 35 remained highly associated with disease progression requiring a medical visit after

187

adjusting for mAb treatment and other co-factors.

188
189

Approximately 2% of the treated group were hospitalized or visited the E.D. after mAb infusion, which

190

was similar to the rate of medical visits in the efficacy assessment of bamlanivimab [10]. In contrast,

191

almost 12% of untreated patients in the current study required a medical visit within 30 days of a positive

192

COVID test. This risk was nearly double the 6.3% of placebo controls who presented to the E.D., required

193

hospitalization, or died in the Phase 2/3 trial [10], suggesting that the current study’s patient population

194

was older and had a higher risk of progression to severe disease. This difference reinforces the need to

195

evaluate therapeutics in diverse populations and in real-world clinical situations, as patients who are

196

referred for and receive treatments often differ from those who are enrolled in a clinical trial.

197
198

Few treatment options have been available during the COVID-19 pandemic for reducing the severity of

199

disease and preventing hospitalization, leading to significant strain on many hospitals[8]. Reducing the

200

proportion of patients who progress to severe disease and require hospitalization by approximately 80%

201

would be of immense value to medical centers, in which intensive care units contain an average of only

202

15 staffed beds [25]. The availability of mAbs at no drug cost due to their procurement by the U.S.

203

government places a therapeutic option more easily within reach of many who are at the highest risk of

204

severe disease.

205
206

The use of electronic health records is a strength of the current study. Due to the medical center’s

207

electronic record system, we were able to assemble a SARS-CoV-2-positive cohort who would have been

208

eligible for mAb treatment at the time of their diagnosis based on pre-existing risk factors, had the

209

therapeutics been available at that time. An additional strength of this study was the diverse patient

210

population in the area, resulting in the inclusion of a large proportion of patients of Hispanic ethnicity

211

(39%). Our results are consistent with prior clinical trial data showing a 70% reduction in medical visits

212

by mAb-infused patients compared to placebo controls[10]. A BMI of 35 or higher was a strong

213

independent predictor of an increased risk of medical visits, which was consistent with other COVID-19

214

studies [7].

215
216

A significantly larger proportion of untreated patients had co-morbidities that increase the risk of severe

217

COVID-19 outcomes compared to treated patients in the current study, notably a higher proportion with

218

elevated BMI. Although mAb treatment remained significantly associated with a decreased risk of

219

hospitalization or E.D. visit after adjusting for pre-existing conditions (82% reduction; 95% CI: 66%,

220

94%), the baseline differences between the treated and untreated groups suggest a potential difference in

221

accessibility of mAb treatment. For example, patients with fewer co-morbidities may have more easily

222

been able to avail themselves of treatment. The continued U.S. government efforts to increase access to

223

mAbs are intended to ensure that COVID-19 therapeutics are equally available to all patients - an

224

important national health equity consideration.

225
226

To receive mAb infusions, patients must seek out treatment within 10 days of a positive SARS-CoV-2

227

antigen test result. This can be burdensome and stresses the importance of widespread availability of

228

testing. Evidence also suggests that patients with more significant or severe co-morbidities are likely to

229

have more complete health records [26,27]. This effect may have overrepresented patients with more

230

severe chronic conditions into the untreated group based on the application of mAb eligibility criteria for

231

inclusion in the analysis. Additionally, without active follow-up of patient outcomes, misclassification of

232

the medical visit outcome was possible as patients could seek follow-up care at any facility. These

233

considerations and the differences between the study groups suggest confounders remain that were

234

unmeasured in this analysis. These limitations could be further evaluated in a larger, prospective,

235

observational study.

236
237

While individuals at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease are prioritized for

238

vaccination in most U.S. states, therapeutic options such as mAb infusions remain a necessity for those

239

who remain unvaccinated due to contraindications or vaccine hesitancy [28,29]. Although viral variants

240

are being discovered that are poorly neutralized by several mAbs in laboratory studies [30,31], suggesting

241

reduced effectiveness in patient populations, relatively minor adjustments to the currently available mAb

242

products can counter these changes. Additionally, the FDA has issued guidance encouraging use of

243

existing formulations, platforms, and clinical protocols to facilitate expedited review and rapid

244

introduction of these modified mAb products to general public [32].

245
246

In summary, we demonstrated that mAb treatment with bamlanivimab was associated with an

247

approximately 80% reduction in the risk of medical visits among a diverse COVID-19 patient population

248

under real-world conditions. Increasing availability and utilization of novel COVID-19 therapeutics may

249

improve patient outcomes, reduce burden on the health system, and contribute to increased health equity

250

in the United States.
