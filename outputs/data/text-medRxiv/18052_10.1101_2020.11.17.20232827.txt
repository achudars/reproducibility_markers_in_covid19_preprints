ABSTRACT

59

Many healthcare facilities report SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks but transmission analysis is complicated by the high

60

prevalence of infection and limited viral genetic diversity. The contribution of different vectors to nosocomial

61

infection or the effectiveness of interventions is therefore currently unclear. Detailed epidemiological and viral

62

nanopore sequence data were analysed from 574 consecutive patients with a PCR positive SARS-CoV-2 test

63

between March 13th and March 31st, when the pandemic first impacted on a large, multisite healthcare

64

institution in London. During this time the first major preventative interventions were introduced, including

65

progressive community social distancing (CSD) policies leading to mandatory national lockdown, exclusion of

66

hospital visitors, and introduction of universal surgical facemask-use by healthcare-workers (HCW). Incidence

67

of nosocomial cases, community SARS-CoV-2 cases and infection in a cohort of 228 HCWs followed the same

68

dynamic course, decreasing shortly after introduction of CSD measures and prior to the main hospital-based

69

interventions. We investigated clusters involving nosocomial cases based on overlapping ward-stays during

70

the 14-day incubation period and SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence similarity. Our method placed 63 (79%) of

71

80 sequenced probable and definite nosocomial cases into 14 clusters containing a median of 4 patients (min

72

2, max 19) No genetic support was found for the majority of epidemiological clusters (31/44, 70%) and

73

genomics revealed multiple contemporaneous outbreaks within single epidemiological clusters. We included

74

a measure of hospital enrichment compared to community cases to increase confidence in our clusters, which

75

were 1-14 fold enriched. Applying genomics, we could provide a robust estimate of the incubation period for

76

nosocomial transmission, with a median lower bound and upper bound of 6 and 9 days respectively. Six (43%)

77

clusters spanned multiple wards, with evidence of cryptic transmission, and community-onset cases could not

78

be identified in more than half the clusters, particularly on the elective hospital site, implicating HCW as vectors

79

of transmission. Taken together these findings suggest that CSD had the dominant impact on reducing

80

nosocomial transmission by reducing HCW infection.

INTRODUCTION

83

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China in

84

December 2019 (1), since when over 40 million infections and 1 million deaths have been reported worldwide

85

(2). New cases in the UK peaked during the first wave after implementation of progressive community social

86

distancing (CSD) (3), starting with an announcement on March 16th that, with few exceptions, the whole UK

87

population must stay at home, later being made mandatory on March 23rd. COVID-19 hospital admission then

88

peaked around 8 days later (4).

89

The first few weeks of the pandemic were unique, due to introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into populations without

90

prior immunity. Society and healthcare organisations were adapting to the pandemic for the first time with

91

frequent new infection control policies and behavioural changes while incidence was still accelerating. During

92

the first wave, elective hospital admissions were often postponed (5). Currently, hospitals around the world

93

either have, or are preparing for, a further influx of COVID-19 patients, while restarting and rescheduling

94

postponed non-COVID-19 work. It is therefore important to identify evidence from these first few weeks to help

95

healthcare organisations efficiently plan for any subsequent increase in cases.

96

Most COVID-19 transmission studies to date have utilised epidemiological analysis alone to identify outbreaks,

97

including those from the UK (6) (7), China (8), France (9) and South Korea (10). The main limitation with using

98

epidemiology alone is that when point prevalence is high, for instance at 2.2% in London during the first wave

99

in April 2020 (11), this increases the chance two people in epidemiological contact are independent cases.

100

Furthermore, a wide incubation period of between 2 and 14 days (12,13) makes it difficult to define hospital-

101

onset cases as hospital-acquired, as even when they arise several days after admission to hospital the

102

transmission event may still have occurred in the community.

103

To improve the confidence in detecting hospital clusters, epidemiological analysis can be supplemented with

104

genomic data obtained by sequencing viral isolates. For COVID-19, thus far only two published studies have

105

used genomic sequencing to analyse hospital transmission (14) (15). However, application of genomic data

106

to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is not straightforward, particularly as during early stages of the pandemic, genetic

107

diversity was low with less than 200 mutations registered in the international GISAID database by April 2020

108

(16). SARS-CoV-2 also has a low mutation rate with only 2-3 mutations per genome per month (17). These

109

factors increase the chance that two people infected with virus sharing identical genetic sequence are not

110

closely epidemiologically linked cases. However, epidemiological linkage combined with viral sequence data

111

can provide stronger evidence for a COVID-19 transmission cluster than would be possible with either source

112

of data alone.

113

Nosocomial infection is reported to account for around 10-20% of all confirmed cases (18) (19) (6) (20) often

114

in designated outbreaks (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) and with a crude death rate of up to 30% (19). The

115

routes of transmission are between patients and involving healthcare workers (HCW) , with potential for all

116

combinations of directionality to occur within the same nosocomial cluster. In each case, the transmitting

117

individual may be either symptomatic or asymptomatic. There is also potential for super-spreading events (21).

118

It is important to determine the contribution of each pathway to help prioritise resourcing of interventions. Most

119

hospitals excluded visitors, who are an alternate source for introducing infection, and although the environment

120

can become contaminated with infectious droplets, cleaning policies effectively removes virus from the

121

environment (22), so fomite spread remains an unproven mode of transmission (23). Airborne transmission

122

via aerosols remains controversial (23).

123

The aim of this study was to develop a methodology for combining epidemiological and genomics analysis of

124

SARS-CoV-2 transmission to help determine the pathways for nosocomial transmission during the first wave

125

of the pandemic. During this time there was a high incidence in the community (11) and high incidence of

126

COVID-19 infection amongst healthcare workers (HCWs) as judged by subsequent seroconversion (24) (25).

RESULTS

129

Setting, clinical characteristics and epidemiology of cases in the first wave of the pandemic

130

SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing for all hospital admissions and inpatients with compatible clinical symptoms of new

131

fever or cough was commenced on March 13th in line with national UK recommendations. Between 80 and

132

150 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed per day until the end of April when testing increased further

133

(Table S1), with 637 positive tests on 574 individuals up until March 31st. The majority of positive cases were

134

admitted to hospital (483/574, 84%, Table S4), consistent with national recommendations to only test those

135

requiring hospital treatment. Cases detected on admission to hospital had a median reported symptom history

136

of 7 days (interquartile range IQR 3-10, available for 385/483, 80%, of cases; Table S4).

137

New positive cases increased rapidly to a peak between March 31st and April 8th, before falling steadily

138

through to the end of April (Figure 1). The number of daily new combined probable and definite nosocomial

139

cases initially increased in line with community diagnoses, but peaked a week earlier than hospital SARS-CoV-

140

2 admissions on March 23rd to a maximum of 12 new cases per day. Nosocomial cases then rapidly declined

141

to low levels of 0-2 cases a day during April (Figure 1) and none in the following 4 months (data not shown).

142

When the symptom onset date for community cases admitted to hospital is considered, the peak of symptom

143

onset for community and nosocomial cases overlap (Supplemental Figure 1).

144

462 (80%) of the 574 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were categorised based on NHS England and ECDC

145

definitions (26) as community-onset, with 63 (11%) definite nosocomial, 27 (5%) probable nosocomial and 22

146

(4%) indeterminate cases (see Methods). Demographics of each group are shown in Table 1. 323 (56%) were

147

male and the median age was 61, although indeterminate, probable nosocomial, and definite nosocomial

148

cases were older (73 years for each group) than community cases (58 years). 225 (49%) of the 455 patients

149

having ethnicity recorded were of black and minority ethnicities (BAME). This proportion was higher amongst

150

community cases (201/371, 54%), compared to indeterminate (6/12, 50%), probable (5/20, 25%) and definite

151

nosocomial cases (13/52, 25%). Comorbidity was lower in community-onset cases 89compared to probable

152

and definite nosocomial cases (median Charlson score 2 (IQR 0-5) versus 5 (IQR 4-6) respectively). The

153

overall crude in-hospital mortality was 20%, ranging from 17% for community-onset cases to 37% for definite

154

nosocomial cases. Of the 574 cases diagnosed until March 31st, 541 were within the study period for genomic

155

analysis between March 13th and 31st. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was obtained from 370 of 541 (68%)

156

cases, including 89% (80/90) of all probable and definite nosocomial cases and 72% (168/234) of cases placed

157

into epidemiological clusters (Table S4, S7).

Healthcare worker symptomatology and sero-conversion

159

The cumulative number of HCWs reporting COVID-19 compatible symptoms and having documented

160

seroconversion from a cohort of 228 HCWs is shown in Figure 1. 43/228 (19%) seroconverted to SARS-CoV-

161

2 IgG, with 44% (19/43) having done so by their first follow-up (April 10th) and 95% (41/43) by May 1st (Table

162

S2). Of note 13/43 (30%) were asymptomatic. Figure 1 presents the predicted period of peak HCW

163

infectectiousness based on a combination of ± 2 days from date of symptom onset (n=30) or seroconversion

164

data where symptoms were not present (n=13) . The rapid rise in HCW infection is predicted to have been

165

between March 16th and 25th overlapping with similar rapid rises in community cases reported elsewhere (3),

166

and both symptom reporting by our community-onset cases and incidence of nosocomial cases.

167

Linking epidemiology and genomics to define transmission clusters

168

Strict epidemiological criteria were used to place patients into clusters based on having at least one overlapping

169

time-point in the same ward, outpatient setting, care home or dialysis facility during 14 days prior to their

170

positive sample (Figure 2a). Each cluster had to include a nosocomial case. This identified 44 epidemiological

171

clusters involving 234 cases comprising 123 community admissions, 89 nosocomial acquisitions (62 definite,

172

27 probable) and 22 indeterminate cases, with a median of 6 patients per cluster (range 2 - 21) (Table S6;

173

Figure 2c for clusters 4-33). Viral genomic haplotype information for each case was then used to resolve the

174

44 epidemiological clusters to create ‘combined’ final epidemiological and genetic clusters. In combined

175

clusters the majority of all patient haplotypes must be identical, and no patient’s viral haplotype can differ from

176

the main cluster haplotype by more than 1 SNP (Figure 2a). This process resulted in 14 combined

177

epidemiological and genetic clusters (Figure 2b, d). The combined clusters were then mapped onto the original

178

44 clusters constructed from epidemiological data alone (Figure 2c, Table S8), where each patient in an

179

epidemiological cluster is classified as either belonging to a combined cluster (coloured bar), or having a

180

haplotype that was not in any combined cluster (grey) or without viral sequence (black).

181

In this manner, 31/44 (70%) epidemiological clusters, including some of the largest, did not have genetic

182

support as they did not have even two cases belonging to any combined cluster (Figure 2c, Table S7). 13/44

183

(30%) included at least one case from two or more combined clusters, indicating cases from multiple

184

contemporaneous outbreaks harboured within an epidemiological cluster (Figure 2c, Table S7).

185

Cluster spatial distribution and enrichment

186

Of the 14 combined epidemiological and genetic clusters, 5 were on the acute admitting hospital site, 7 were

187

on the elective hospital site and two at intermediate care facilities. These 14 clusters contained 63/80 (79%)

188

of all sequenced probable and definite nosocomial cases (Figure 2d). 3/5 (60%) clusters on the acute site

189

(STH) included a community-onset or indeterminate case, which plausibly served as the originator of SARS-

190

CoV-2 outbreak. This contrasts with the 9 clusters on elective and intermediate sites, which by policy did not

191

knowingly admit COVID-19 patients, where only three (3/9, 33%) included a community-onset or indeterminate

192

case that could have plausibly originated the outbreak (Figure 2d; Supplemental Figure 2 for ward movements).

193

The validity of creating these final 14 clusters was supported by comparing their lineage enrichment compared

194

to community sequences reported to COG-UK consortium CLIMB database during the study period (27).

195

Clusters were enriched by between 1 (for the smallest clusters) and 14-fold (median 4-fold) (Figure 2d, Table

196

S7). In terms of spatial distribution, 7/12 hospital clusters were contained within single wards, 3 clusters were

197

spread on two wards (in 2 cases this involved adjacent wards), and 2 clusters were spread across more than

198

two wards (Figure 4).

199

Unsequenced community-onset cases are unlikely to be originators of clusters

200

We assessed the likelihood that unsequenced community-onset cases may have served as the originator of

201

clusters, where no community-onset or indeterminate cases could be found, by reviewing cases

202

epidemiologically linked with nosocomial clusters. We excluded cases as potential originators if i) they were

203

diagnosed after the first nosocomial case, or ii) available sequence did not meet cluster inclusion criteria (i.e

204

differed from main cluster viral haplotype by >1 SNP), or iii) if they were not community-onset or indeterminate

205

cases (Table S11). Of all the clusters without originators, only 2 clusters could have potentially been originated

206

by an unsequenced community-onset case with epidemiological linkage (case 50 or case 187 for GUY4; case

207

62 for GUY5).

208

Deducing Transmission Networks and Estimating Incubation Period

209

Patient movements, timing of positive SARS-CoV-2 test, viral haplotype data and SNP acquisition were

210

combined and analysed to infer the place and time period of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, and predict the direction

211

of transmission from donor to recipient. This analysis could be applied to 5 hospital clusters comprising 24

212

patients (Figure 5, Supplemental Figure S 3A-D, Table S9 and S10) with patients assigned a lower bound

213

(n=12) and/or upper bound (n=23) for acquisition of SARS-CoV-2, and hence their incubation period (Figure

214

5a,b,c). The aggregate analyses gave a median lower bound of 6 days and median upper bound of 9 days

215

(Figure 5d, Supplemental Figure 3 A-D, Table S10), consistent with estimates that range from 2-14 days with

216

a median estimate of 5-7 days (28).

Representation of healthcare workers in transmission networks

218

HCW were required to self isolate immediately upon developing COVID-19 compatible symptoms and were

219

not routinely offered SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing. For this reason there are only 20 SARS-CoV-2 sequences

220

from HCW in the dataset. 17 did not share genomic similarity with other cases, which excludes them from

221

contributing to transmission within sequenced clusters. The viral haplotypes from 3 HCW shared genetic

222

similarity with cluster cases, 1 of which (case 280) cared for a nosocomial case (case 60) within cluster STH1

223

and shared the same haplotype. Case 280 therefore can be added to cluster STH1, however 280 is unlikely

224

to be the originator of this cluster as they were diagnosed more than 7 days after the first case in this cluster.

227

DISCUSSION

228

This combined epidemiological and genomic analysis spans 19 days of intense community transmission in

229

London during the first wave of the pandemic, which coincided with the main period of nosocomial

230

transmission, comprising 90 definite or probable nosocomial cases across our healthcare institution. This was

231

also the period when stepwise increases in public health restrictions were introduced, including repeated

232

instructions to stay at home and socially distance by at least 2 metres in public places from 16th March, through

233

to national lockdown on March 23rd.

234

Our transmission analysis during this important period provides evidence informing methodological

235

approaches to nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak detection. First, both epidemiological and genomic

236

information is essential for accurate linkage of nosocomial cases into putative SARS-CoV-2 clusters: we could

237

not find genomic support for over half of the transmission clusters discovered using epidemiological data alone,

238

and the rest are significantly reduced in size (Fig 3c, Table S7, S8). This latter point is illustrated by

239

epidemiological cluster 8, where genome sequence identified the presence of 3 genomic clusters within a

240

single epidemiologically defined cluster. Second, we show that isolates with a single SNP difference can

241

reasonably be included within clusters given the known SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate and the timeframe of

242

nosocomial transmission clusters. These single SNPs were highly informative as they helped determine the

243

sequence of transmission (Figure 5, Supplemental Figure 3 A-D). Third, it is important to assess the likelihood

244

that linked nosocomial cases even with identical genomes might be due to chance due to the high prevalence

245

of that sequence in the community. We included a method to assess enrichment compared with the

246

surrounding London population by comparing data from the COG-UK CLIMB database, which showed cluster

247

enrichment ranging from 1 to 14 fold. Importantly, the lowest enrichment was seen for clusters of size 2 (Figure

248

2d). For cases where the enrichment is over 1, this approach gives greater confidence in the definition of

249

clusters and is an important measure that has not thus far been used in other genetic studies. Fourth, we show

250

that for SARS-CoV-2, given its relatively long incubation time, patients should be considered in clusters based

251

on contact during previous admissions. Five patients across 3 clusters (case 520, 362, 236 in STH1, 278 in

252

STH3 and 277 in GUY1, see Supplementary Figure 1) had epidemiological contact during a previous

253

admission to the one during which they were diagnosed. Such contact is not currently considered in published

254

definitions. Finally, we were also able to robustly estimate median incubation period for nosocomial cases as

255

between 6-9 days, which, to our knowledge, is the first time the COVID-19 incubation period has been

256

estimated using both genetics and epidemiological data. This is consistent with published evidence that most

257

people become symptomatic within 7 days of exposure (13). In addition, our study showed a similar proportion

258

of probable and definite nosocomial cases could be placed into transmission clusters. Thus when a probable

259

nosocomial case is found it is likely to be a genuine nosocomial case and should be treated as such.

260

A number of clusters (GUY1, GUY2, GUY4, GUY5) involved cryptic transmission across multiple wards which

261

is consistent with untested individuals such as staff or asymptomatic patients, but not patient visitors, as

262

missing links in transmission clusters. For instance, clusters GUY1 and GUY2 involved 4 wards, with an

263

identical viral haplotype circulating with high enrichment compared to the community. Whilst these two clusters

264

meet our cluster definition as defined in Methods, they are not merged due to there being no patient overlap

265

in ward stay between the clusters. Given these were highly enriched clusters, in the same building just a few

266

floors apart, and with no community-onset case as the originator of GUY2, the most parsimonious explanation

267

is cryptic transmission between the two. Similarly in GUY1 there is no patient who clearly could have infected

268

case #551 (see Supplementary Figure 1). Lastly, GUY4 and GUY5 involve highly enriched haplotypes across

269

neighbouring wards. These situations suggest cryptic transmission, and ‘missing links’ which may be HCW or

270

asymptomatic, untested patients.

271

With the above methodological approaches defined, we focussed on the initial period of nosocomial SARS-

272

CoV-2 transmission to try and identify factors explaining its rapid rise and fall. There was initially a complete

273

temporal overlap between the increase in community cases, healthcare worker symptoms, and incidence of

274

nosocomial cases. We propose that the most likely explanation is that HCWs were an essential contributor to

275

the intensity of nosocomial transmission during this initial period, potentially by both initiating and sustaining

276

transmission. This is supported by a number of findings. First, reported symptoms in HCW with confirmed

277

infection were before or at the time of lockdown on 23rd March, with their peak infectivity predicted to coincide

278

with peak nosocomial transmission (Figure 1). Second, cryptic transmission between wards was clearly

279

demonstrated, suggesting involvement of untested individuals moving between wards, with HCWs being the

280

most likely vector. Third, we were unable to identify community or indeterminate cases who may have served

281

as originators for more than half of clusters, suggesting involvement of untested individuals such as HCW.

282

Indeed many clusters also occurred on the elective sites, where cases were not knowingly admitted. Finally,

283

we did link 1 of only 20 tested HCWs to a transmission cluster, which although not the originator, is consistent

284

with the potential for HCWs to sustain outbreaks. Whilst HCW seem the most likely source of transmission it

285

is however possible that unrecognised patient-to-patient transmission occurred, for instance by asymptomatic

286

patients or in areas where we do not have epidemiological data, such as radiology departments

287

Subsequently, from around March 16th, progressive CSD rapidly reduced community SARS-CoV-2

288

transmission, which would also decrease the incidence of HCWs infected in the community, lowering their

289

potential to contribute to nosocomial transmission. Consistent with this conclusion, nosocomial infection fell

290

rapidly from March 23rd to the end of the study in line with reported community infections, and before any

291

potential impact from surgical mask use or banning of visitors to hospital.

292

It is harder to interpret events after 31st March. It is notable that SARS-CoV-2 patients continued to be

293

admitted, peaking on 8th April, whilst nosocomial cases fell and remained low. One conclusion is that

294

admission of community-onset cases is in itself unlikely to cause large clusters. Partly this may be due to rapid

295

diagnosis of clinically suspected cases and pre-emptive isolation, in an environment where HCWs are wearing

296

appropriate PPE. Additionally, It may be that by the time community-onset cases of SARS-CoV-2 are admitted

297

to hospital (in our study a median day 7 days post onset of symptoms) they are less infectious because viral

298

load is falling. Indeed, this is consistent with previous studies showing a median duration of viral shedding of

299

4 days post onset of symptoms (29).

300

In summary, this study supports routine use of genome sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 outbreak investigation

301

and provides a framework for data interpretation that calls into question continued reliance on using

302

epidemiology alone. A multi-site clinical trial, COG-UK HOCI, is currently investigating whether provision of

303

real-time sequencing for outbreak analysis can help infection control teams interrupt transmission (30). We

304

provide data supporting a conclusion that HCWs infected in the community are a major contributor to

305

nosocomial transmission during the initial stage of the first wave of the pandemic, which was halted by

306

implementation of CSD policies. With community transmission returning, including to HCWs, there will be an

307

opportunity to assess whether nosocomial transmission returns to the same intensity with policies such as

308

universal mask use in place, or whether additional interventions such as regular staff testing or rapid SARS-

309

CoV-2 genome sequencing is required to limit nosocomial transmission. This is particularly important given

310

the challenges re-introducing CSD policies and the need to continue with non-COVID-19 clinical activity.

METHODS

314

Setting

315

Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital NHS Foundation Trust includes: 1) an acute admitting adult hospital site with

316

an Emergency Department (St Thomas’) also hosting the network lead centre for nationally-commissioned

317

respiratory high consequence infectious diseases (HCID), which admitted some of the first UK SARS-CoV-2

318

cases to specialised intensive care and general wards. It was also the only site knowingly admitting COVDI-

319

19 patients. 2) an elective ambulatory site including elective orthopaedic and thoracic surgery, a cancer centre,

320

dialysis and renal transplant unit (Guy’s); 3) two long stay community care units and 4) multiple community

321

dialysis units. All sites are part of the same management structure and were part of a single operational

322

pandemic response structure with daily meetings throughout and received the same laboratory diagnostic and

323

infection control services. Infection control policies were reviewed daily with reference to frequent updates from

324

Public Health England and NHS England, to implement stepwise measured derogation of Personal Protective

325

Equipment (PPE) use while caring for known and suspected COVID-19 patients moving from HCID designation

326

to caring for hundreds of COVID-19 patients. Hospital visitors and relatives were excluded from the hospital

327

from March 25th, and universal HCW surgical mask use policy was introduced for all patient interactions across

328

all hospital and community facilities on March 28th.

329
330

Sample retrieval and clinical data collection

331

490 surplus RNA extracts from SARS-CoV-2 combined nose and throat swabs collected between 13th and

332

31st March 2020 inclusive, predominantly from patients within the catchment South East London boroughs,

333

and stored in the routine diagnostic laboratory after completion of all clinically-requested tests, were retrieved

334

by the primary care team. Swabs had been tested using multiplexed tandem PCR (AusDiagnostics two-step

335

multiplexed-tandem (MT-PCR) Coronavirus Typing Eight-well Panel; cat. no. 2061901) targeting ORF1a of

336

SARS-CoV-2. 448 extracts had been reported as SARS-CoV2 detected and 42 not-detected. The cycle

337

threshold (Ct) value was taken as 15 plus the diagnostic MT-PCR take off value. Isolates with a Ct of 16 – 37

338

were regarded as eligible for WGS. Extracts were anonymised and linked with a limited set of clinical data

339

(Table 1) and the admission and ward stay dates by the primary care team, before submission to the research

340

team. Favourable opinion to conduct this work was granted by the North West Preston Research Ethics

341

Committee (Reference 18/NW/0584).

343

Anonymisation

344

All patients and samples were anonymised using a unique patient and sample identification number. Ward

345

stays were anonymised using the following schema: locations beginning with ‘A’ represent ambulatory or

346

outpatient locations numbered A01 to A60; if prefixed with ‘ED’ represent emergency departments; if starting

347

with ‘IC’ represent an intensive care unit; each patients usual residence was named ‘Home’ followed by their

348

anonymised patient ID, and inpatient wards were anonymised using three letter international airport codes.

352

PTC_9096_v109_revF_06Feb2020-gridion from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) with V3 PCR primers

353

from the ARTIC protocol (31). 24 samples were prepared in each library. 3µl of synthesised cDNA was used

354

in each PCR reaction instead of the ONT suggested 2.5µl and 35 PCR cycles were conducted. The 20°C

355

incubation was extended to 10 minutes in the end-prep step. All the AMPure XP bead clean-up steps used a

356

1:1 ratio of library to AMPureXP beads. The post-barcode ligation bead clean-up was washed with 2x 450µl

357

SFB washes rather than the ONT suggested 700µl. 17.5ng of the final library was loaded onto the flow cell for

358

sequencing. The flow cell sequenced for 3 days or until there were very few active pores remaining.

359

Generation of SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequence and variant and lineage calling from raw Nanopore reads

360

From raw Nanopore reads, COVID-19 viral consensus sequences and variants were generated using the Artic

361

bioinformatic pipeline v 1.0 as described in Artic Network(32) . Lineages were assigned using the Pangolin

362

software (33) version 1.1.14 with lineages version 2020-05-19.

363

Haplotype construction for patients

364

For each patient, a viral haplotype was constructed by juxtaposing all variants from the .pass.vcf file output by

365

the Artic bioinformatics pipeline above. The exception was for genomic positions that were known to be

366

homoplasic according to problematic sites (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/W-L/ProblematicSites_SARS-

367

CoV-2/master/problematic_sites_sarsCov2.vcf) . These sites at positions 635, 11074, 11083, 16887, 21575,

were all masked and not included in any haplotypes.

369

For patient 363, three variants (C3096T, G13627T, C15540T) were also taken from the .fail.vcf file. This patient

370

was in a transmission cluster with strong epidemiological evidence linking them to 4 patients who all had

371

variants C3096T, G13627T, and C15540T. All three of these variants were found in all of the other patients in

372

this transmission cluster. This situation with variants in the .fail.vcf file rather than the .pass.vcf file only arose

373

for patient 363 in our dataset.

374

Definitions and deduction of transmission Clusters

375

Transmission clusters were deduced in a series of stages using combined epidemiological and genetic

376

information, in three phases as follows. First, each patient sample was placed in nosocomial categories based

377

on date of testing according to NHS England and ECDC definitions (26): Community (<3 days from admission),

378

indeterminate (3-7 days from admission), probable Nosocomial (8-14 days from admission) and definite

379

nosocomial (>14 days from admission). Epidemiological clusters were constructed using the following rules

380

(Fig 2a and table S7): At least two cases in the epidemiologically defined cluster; at least one probable or

381

definite nosocomial case; all cases in the seed cluster must overlap with at least one other patient in the same

382

seed cluster. Overlap was defined as both patients being on the same ward at the same time for at least one

383

day during the incubation period set as 14 days prior to the positive SARS-CoV-2 positive swab (13).

384

In the second phase of cluster construction, genetic information was added by considering the viral haplotype

385

for each patient in the epidemiological cluster. Epidemiological clusters were split into combined

386

epidemiological + genetic clusters where every patient has the same viral haplotype. These combined

387

epidemiological plus genetic clusters are termed “seed” clusters.

388

In the third phase, additional patients were added to seed clusters based on the following criteria: the patient

389

added must overlap with at least one patient in the seed cluster (where overlap is defined as above); the added

390

patient has a viral haplotype that differs only one SNP from the seed cluster viral haplotype. Patients who met

391

criterion 1 (overlap) but whose viral haplotypes differed by 2 SNPs from the seed cluster viral haplotype were

392

added to the cluster if at least one of the “missing” SNP positions was called as an N due to insufficient

393

sequence coverage in consensus sequence generation. For two clusters, (STH4, STH5) phase 3 involved

394

merging two different seed clusters whose viral haplotypes differed from each other by one SNP.

395

There are two clusters that are exceptions to the above rules: GUY3 and GUY4. These two clusters were

396

added upon manual inspection of the combined epidemiological and genetic data. In both cases, two patients

397

whose viral haplotype differed by a single SNP overlapped on the same ward during their incubation period,

398

and a third patient, whose viral haplotype was identical to that of one of the two previously mentioned patients

399

was present on an adjacent ward at the same time, also during their incubation period. These two clusters

400

violate the criterion given above that seed clusters should be on a single ward, but are nonetheless considered

401

as transmission clusters because the two wards (Samaritan and Hedley Atkins) in both cases are spatially

402

adjacent and with frequent sharing of staff across wards, especially at night..These clusters also showed high

403

enrichment compared to community haplotypes (see below.)

404

Calculation of Hospital compared with Community Enrichment for cluster viral haplotypes

405

Enrichment of viral haplotype frequencies amongst nosocomial and community cases were calculated as

406

follows (Table S8 and Fig 2). For a given haplotype, the hospital frequency (H) was calculated by dividing the

407

number of patients in the dataset by the total number of sequenced patients in our dataset (370). COG-UK

408

consortium data in COV_GLUE was extracted on 29th June 2020 to assess community haplotype frequencies

409

(27). To assist with SQL queries, a view from several tables was created with the following SQL query:

410

“create

411

collection_date,adm0,adm1,adm2,num_ns,longest_n_run,num_unique_snps,pang_lineage,cov_glue_lineag

412

e,cov_nt_mutation_id

413

cov_cov_nt_mutation_sequence ms on m.id = sequence_id and ms.sequence_sequence_id = sequence_id ;”

414

Two numbers were used to calculate the community frequency,: the entire community population of relevance,

415

and the number of patients with the given haplotype in the community population. The community population

416

(Cd) was defined as all the sequenced patients within the study period (13th to 31st March inclusive) with a

417

location of ‘GREATER LONDON’, ‘LONDON’, or ‘CITY OF LONDON’, whichever had greater than 90%

418

sequence coverage (952 people). This number was obtained using the following SQL query:

419

“select count(distinct sequence_id) from full where (adm2 like '%LONDON%' and adm2 != 'LONDONDERRY')

420

and (collection_date >= '2020-03-13' and collection_date <= '2020-03-31') and num_ns/29401 < 10;”

421

Where 29401 is the length of the reference viral genome coding region, so given the percentage of Ns in the

422

sequenced sample. Requiring a cutoff of less than 10% Ns is equivalent to greater than 90% sequencing

423

coverage, which is the cutoff required for our samples in this study.

424

The number of patients with the given haplotype in the community population was calculated by determining

425

the number of sequences in the community population that had all of the SNP variants in the given haplotype,

and no more. For this purpose, any homoplasic SNPs that had been removed from consideration when

427

constructing patient viral haplotypes within our study population (see section “Haplotype construction for

428

patients” above), namely SNPs at positions 635, 11074, 11083, 16887, 21575, were added back to calculate

429

the haplotype numbers in the community, as these SNPs had not been removed in the samples submitted to

430

COG-UK. The following is an example query to obtain the number of patients in the community with the

431

haplotype for our cluster STH1 (C241T,C3037T,C14408T,A23403G,C25350T):

432

“select distinct sequence_id from full where 100*(num_Ns/29903) < 10 and

433

439

by sequence_id having count(distinct mut_id) = 4”

440

Results were obtained for 11 community sequences where community frequency was defined as Cn / Cd. A

441

correction factor of 1 was then added to Cn as a pseudocount to avoid dividing by zero for cases where Cn =

442

0. Thus the formula for community frequency is (Cn + 1) / Cd and the formula to calculate nosocomial

443

enrichment for a given haplotype was H / [(Cn + 1) / Cd].

444

Healthcare worker (HCW) serology and symptom reporting

445

Blood sample collection to determine COVID-19 seroconversion was offered to consenting healthcare workers

446

at Guy’s & St Thomas’ Hospital after expedited approval from the Trust’s R&D office, occupational health and

447

medical director ((34)). Sequential serum samples were collected approximately every 1-2 weeks from 228

448

HCWs between 13th March and 10th June 2020. Samples were tested using a published ELISA assay with

449

sera diluted 1:50 considered positive if they gave an OD for IgG against both N and S that was 4-fold above

450

the negative control sera. Self-reported COVID-19 related symptoms were recorded by participants and days

451

post onset of symptoms in seropositive individuals was determined using this information. For asymptomatic

452

seropositive individuals, days POS was defined as the first timepoint SARS-CoV-2 Abs were detected. Six

453

HCWs had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 PCR+ infection. Serology results were communicated individually to

HCWs and collectively to the hospital as part of preparation for universal HCW serology testing that

who stay on the same ward at the same time, both during their potential incubation period (red circles). The

473

incubating patients are on the same ward at two non-overlapping times (i.e. different days).

iii) An epidemiological (epi) cluster is defined as a set of overlapping patients based on ward stays, where

475

overlap is defined as above, and every patient in the set overlaps at least one other patient in the set, and at

476

least one patient in the set is nosocomial (in hospital >7 days before tested for COVID-19 after having shown

477

symptoms). When viral haplotypes information is taken into account for the patients in a single epi cluster,

478

there are two possible results. In scenario 1, the epi cluster is decomposed into several epi + genetic clusters

479

(indicated by non-red colours) where different colours mean different haplotypes, and a star indicates that a

480

patient has a single additional genetic variant (at most) in addition to the variants comprising the coloured

481

haplotype. In scenario 2, the addition of genetic information decomposes the single epidemiological cluster

482

into individual patients with unique haplotypes, not clustering by genomics.

514

inside that ward during their incubation period (as defined in Figure 2a).

FIGURE 5a) Patient movement diagram and inferred transmission network for cluster STH3. Patient

517

movements from home to hospital and between wards within St. Thomas’ Hospital are shown from the 8th to

518

the 25th of March. Shapes indicate the nosocomial designation assigned to the patient as in Figure 2 (d).

519

Patients are coloured according to viral haplotype (Figure 2b) from the earliest date at which it can be deduced

520

that they could have caught COVID-19 onwards, based on the viral haplotype and the movement of other

521

patients within the cluster. Prior to the inferred earliest possible infection start date they are shown as white

522

shapes. Double-sided arrows indicate a patient staying on a ward for several days. Patients 16 and 29 originate

523

the cluster, arriving from home sites within 1km of each other on the 8th and 9th, into Ward A (LON), where

524

they transmit the same viral haplotype to patients 90 and 144. Patient 90 is then moved to Ward B (INV) on

525

the 11th, which leads to the infection of patients 230 and 319, and in the process an accumulation of an extra

526

SNP in the viral haplotype (pink asterisk, A11781G). Patient 278 is infected with this new viral haplotype

527

sometime between the 16th and 18th, when they are on ward B. Patient 278 went back and forth between

528

home and the hospital several times, so while strictly designated as “Community”, likely caught this rare

529

hospital-enriched SARS-CoV-2 haplotype in Ward B.

FIGURE 5b) Inferred transmission network. The most parsimonious COVID-19 transmission network for this

cluster based on patient ward movements and viral haplotypes is shown. The pink asterisk indicates the

533

mutation of the original haplotype via the acquisition of an additional SNP A11781G.

on the patient ward movements (part a) and the transmission network (part b), the lower and upper bounds of

SUPPLEMENTAL FIGURE 2 Ward movement diagrams for the combined clusters formed through

epidemiological and genetic analysis. Each row represents one patient’s movements. Lineage, nosocomial

designation and haplotype are shown. Ward stays are shown coloured by different ward location, with time on

557

the horizontal axis. Where a patient is on two wards in one day, the ward with the longest stay is represented.

558

An ‘x’ marks date of specimen collection for the first positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 for each patient.

559

SUPPLEMENTAL FIGURES 3A - 3D Patient movement and transmission network analogous to figure 5 a-c

560

for clusters STH1 (Figure S 3A), STH4 (Figure S 3B), GUY1 (Figure S 3C), and GUY3 (Figure S 3D). Patient

561

shapes are as specified for Figure 5. Colours are for cluster-specific viral haplotypes, as specified in Figure

562

2b. Ward names are independent for each cluster (so “Ward A” on Figure S 3A is not necessarily the same as

563

“Ward A” on Figure S 3B).

564

SUPPLEMENTAL FIGURE 3A Patient 127 is the likely origin of the part of cluster STH1 that is on Ward A

565

(KUL ward from Table S5, Table S8). Patient 127 arrives from home to the ward where the nosocomial patients

566

are infected (Ward A) within a two day period. Nosocomial patients 245, 206, 354, 293, and 480 are infected

567

in Ward A after the arrival of patient 127 onto Ward A having already been on this ward before patient 127

568

arrives (245,480, 293, 206) or arriving after patient 127 (354). Patients 245, 480, 293, and 206 are then

569

transferred to Ward C (SFO), which sets a lower bound on when they must have been infected (as they were

570

infected in Ward A). Subsequently nosocomial patient 469 is infected on Ward C. Independently, patient 127

571

is moved to Ward B (DEL), where patient 268 gets infected.

572

SUPPLEMENTAL FIGURE 3B Two transmission scenarios (i and ii) are considered for cluster STH4. Either

573

patient 212 arrives on Ward A already a carrier, which leads to the infection of nosocomial patients 337, 396,

574

351, and 374 (scenario “i”), or the viral haplotype was already circulating on Ward A (DEN) prior to the arrival

575

of patient 212 (scnarion “ii”). In scenario (i), patient 212 transmits the virus to one of patients 337, 396, or 351,

576

and in this transmission, SNP A12918 (purple asterisk) is acquired. Subsequently patient 212 transmits the

577

strain without A12918 to patient 374. In scenario (ii), when patient 212 arrives on Ward A, there are already

578

two strains that differ by a single SNP (A12918 ) circulating on that ward. “X” and “Y” indicate two separate

579

unknown “missing links” -- either asymptomatic patients or staff. For both scenarios i and ii, the inferred upper

580

bounds for acquisition are identical for patients 374, 396, 351, shown in part c.

581

SUPPLEMENTAL FIGURE 3C Patient 277 originates cluster GUY1, arriving from home onto Ward A (PVG),

582

where nosocomial patients 355 and 199 are infected. Nosocomial patient 309 is infected on Ward A, picking

583

up the additional variant TTA28062T. Patient 355 is then transferred to Ward B (AMS), which leads to the

584

infection of nosocomial patient 256 and patient 356. In an independent transmission network, nosocomial

585

patient 434 is infected on Ward C (CAN) after the arrival of patient 551, and in the process acquires SNP

586

T2978C.

587

SUPPLEMENTAL FIGURE 3D Patient 71 originates cluster GUY3, arriving from home onto Ward A (IC9),

588

then moving to Ward B (HKG) within three days, where nosocomial patients 229, 295, and 363 are infected.

589

All three of these patients acquire SNP A1678G in the process, so it is most parsimonious that patient 71

590

transmitted to one of these patients, who then transmitted it to at least one of the other two. Several days later,

591

patient 301 is admitted to Ward B, where they are infected, and acquire SNP A24033G in the process.
