Abstract
Background: To investigate impacts of COVID-19 on CR delivery around the globe, including
effects on providers and patients.
Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a piloted survey was administered to CR programs
globally via REDCap from April-June/2020. The 50 members of the ICCPR and personal
contacts facilitated program identification.
Results: Overall, 1062(18.3% program response rate) responses were received from
70/111(63.1% country response rate) countries in the world with existent CR programs. Of these,
367(49.1%) programs reported they had stopped CR delivery, and 203(27.1%) stopped
temporarily (mean=8.3±2.8weeks). Alternative models were delivered in 322(39.7%) programs,
primarily through low-tech modes (n=226,19.3%). 353(30.2%) respondents were re-deployed,
and 276 (37.3%) felt the need to work due to fear of losing their job, despite the perceived risk of
contracting COVID-19 (mean=30.0%±27.4/100). 266(22.5%) reported anxiety, 241(20.4%)
were concerned about exposing their family, 113(9.7%) reported increased workload to
transition to remote delivery, and 105(9.0%) were juggling caregiving responsibilities during
business hours. Patients were often contacting staff regarding grocery shopping for heart-healthy
foods (n=333,28.4%), how to use technology to interact with the program (n=329,27.9%),
having to stop their exercise because they have no place to exercise (n=303,25.7%), and their
risk of death from COVID-19 due to pre-existing cardiovascular disease (n=249,21.2%).
Respondents perceived staff (n=488,41.3%) and patient (n=453,38.6%) personal protective
equipment, as well as COVID-19 screening (n=414,35.2%) and testing (n=411,35.0%) as
paramount to in-person service resumption.

Highlights

-

COVID-19 has impacted cardiac rehabilitation (CR) delivery around the globe.

-

In this cross-sectional study, a survey was completed by 1062 (18.3%) CR programs
from 70 (63.1%) countries.

-

The pandemic has resulted in cessation of ~75% of CR programs, with others ceasing
initiation of new patients, reducing components delivered, and/or changing of mode
delivery with little opportunity for planning and training.

-

There is also significant psychosocial and economic impact on CR providers.

-

Alternative CR model (e.g. home-based, virtual) reimbursement advocacy is needed, to
ensure safe, accessible secondary prevention delivery.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease with high
transmissibility caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), [1]
which was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO).
COVID-19 disproportionately affects older adults, and there is a higher case fatality rate in those
with underlying conditions such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD) [2,3]. In addition to
respiratory effects, COVID-19 has negative cardiovascular effects as well [4,5]. COVID-19 has
placed tremendous pressures on health care organizations around the world.
CVDs are among the most prevalent non-communicable diseases worldwide [6]. Cardiac
rehabilitation (CR) is recommended as the standard of care for secondary prevention of CVD
[7,8] as it significantly reduces morbidity and mortality [9]. Although models vary, CR is
generally delivered in clinical settings [10], involving semi-weekly visits for exercise and
education/counselling sessions over several months, for a median of 24 sessions globally [11].
These in-person visits therefore, if continued during COVID-19, carry a high risk of exposure.
Government response and restrictions to the COVID-19 pandemic have varied widely,
but include limits to non-essential health care services, including non-urgent outpatient
appointments. As a result, the delivery of CR has been impacted. Early information suggests
many CR programs globally have closed or switched to virtual delivery [12-21]. This has
negative impacts on patients, who are fearful of, or cannot access, cardiac care, adding to this
health crisis [22-24]. In addition, CR providers are experiencing occupational health, and
economic threats [25]. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate impacts of
COVID-19 on CR delivery around the globe, including impacts on providers and patients.

Design and Procedure
This research was cross-sectional in design. This work was undertaken by the
International Council of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (ICCPR;
globalcardiacrehab.com); York University's Office of Research Ethics (Toronto, Canada)
approved secondary use of the data for publication purposes. Participation in the survey
constituted voluntary consent to participate. Responses were confidential.
All 40 ICCPR member associations and 10 “friend” members were contacted, and
requested to circulate the survey to their members and any other programs of which they were
aware in their regions. Contacts of the investigators were also approached to circulate and
complete the survey. Potential respondents were also recruited from the attendance list of the
ICCPR webinar on COVID-19 and CR [26], which was attended by more than 300 participants.
Data collection occurred from March to June 2020 via online survey administered
through REDCap (English). The original survey was not available within China. Therefore, the
survey was translated (Simplified Chinese) by co-author XL, a bilingual nurse with CR
expertise, and disseminated through Sojump, a professional online survey platform.
Sample
The sample comprised CR programs around the world, with programs defined as those
that offer (1) initial assessment, (2) structured exercise, and (3) at least one other strategy to
control risk factors. We asked the CR program manager to complete the survey where possible.
Countries were categorized by WHO region [27]. To ultimately understand
representativeness of the sample, the availability of CR by country and programs per country
was ascertained from ICCPR’s first global audit of CR (2016/2017) [28]. Through that process, it
was estimated that there were 5,813 programs in 111/203 countries with CR internationally (note

in the global audit only a random subsample of programs was recruited in the United States, but
all programs were emailed for this study) [28]. Information from key informants and respondents
were used to update these numbers where available.
Measures
A 33-item questionnaire was developed by the investigators to examine the objectives of
this study (Online Appendix 1). Non-COVID-related questionnaire items were based on
ICCPR’s previous CR program survey [18]. The questionnaire was divided into three sections:
(1) CR program characteristics and impacts of COVID-19, (2) barriers and facilitators to
delivering CR programs virtually, and (3) COVID-related impacts on staff and patients. The
items had forced-choice (some were select all that apply) and open-ended response options, and
skip-logic was used to get more detail where applicable. Input from CR providers was solicited,
with minor changes made to questions and wording prior to launch of the survey.
Respondents were asked to report their country and the date. To contextualize responses,
information on COVID-19 cases at the time of survey completion in each country was extracted
from the website “Our World in Data” [29] and confirmed with data available on each country’s
government website. The Government Response Stringency Index - information on 9 common
policy responses that governments have taken to respond to the pandemic such as workplace
closures and stay-at-home requirements (rescaled to a value from 0 to 100, with 100 = strictest
responses) – was also extracted from this website for each country, with information
corresponding to the mean date of survey completion by respondents in each country.
Data Analysis
Data were exported from REDCap and Sojump to SPSS version 26, where all the
analysis was performed. All initiated surveys that had at least one response were included. The

number of responses for each question varied due to missing data (e.g., respondent did not
answer a question due to inapplicability, skip logic, or decided to not answer for other reasons);
for descriptive analyses, percentages were computed using the number of valid responses for the
specific item as the denominator.
Descriptive statistics (e.g., frequency with percentage) were applied for all closed-ended
items in the survey. All open-ended responses were coded.
Results
Respondents
Overall, 1062 responses were received, of which 1044 (98.3%) identified their country.
As shown in Table 1, responses were received from 70 (34.5%) of the approximately 203
countries in the world (covering all 6 WHO regions; response rate by region ranged from 14.1100.0%; median number of responding programs per country=98.0; Q25-75=36.0-108.0), or
63.1% of the 111 countries identified to have any CR programs in ICCPR’s global audit [28].
Given the estimated number of programs globally28 and updates gleaned through this process (no
additional countries were determined to have CR, but 13 countries had increases in the number
of programs since ICCPR’s 2016/17 audit, with a total of 60 additional programs globally; Table
1), responses were received from 18.3% of the estimated 5,813 programs worldwide.
In regards to location, 392 (37.4%) CR programs were located in a community hospital,
364 (34.7%) in a referral center, quaternary or tertiary facility, and/or academic center, 46 (4.4%)
in a rehabilitation hospital or residential facility, and 70 (6.7%) in other locations, including
private clinics, universities, and fitness centers. With regards to reimbursement, 690 (66.4%)
programs have their services covered by the government, 557 (52.8%) programs’ services were

paid directly by patients, and 484 (47.5%) were paid by health insurance (many programs had
multiple sources).
Table 1 presents number of cases and stringency index by country. The COVID-19
restrictions that had taken place in their area at any time before respondents completed the
survey were as follows: 961 (80.2%) reported that gatherings over a certain number of people
were prohibited, 947 (79.4%) reported that anyone potentially exposed to COVID-19 was under
quarantine or self-isolation, 891 (75.3%) reported schools were closed, 859 (72.1%) reported
hospitals were not allowing visitors, 848 (71.7%) reported hospitals were not doing elective
surgeries, 840 (71.2%) reported all but essential services/ businesses were closed, 797 (67.0%)
reported that people had to wear masks when physical distancing was not possible, 649 (54.4%)
reported travel within their region was restricted, and 633 (54.4%) reported the enforcement of
physical distancing with fines and other means.
Impact of COVID-19 on CR Program Delivery
Overall, 106 (14.4%) programs had suspected or positive COVID-19 patients (see Table
1 for COVID-19 cases by region). At the time of survey completion, 367 (49.1%) programs
reported they had completely stopped CR delivery for the COVID-19 pandemic, and 203
(27.1%) stopped for a period but had already resumed services (mean 8.3±2.8 [standard
deviation] weeks); 178 (23.8%) programs did not stop (see Table 1 for this information by
country). As shown, Nigeria has the poorest CR density, and all programs closed. Of those that
stopped for any amount of time, 363 (30.0%) made no other arrangements to provide patient
care, and the 202 (16.7%) that did describe the following: home-based CR/ telehealth, online
consultations (with respondents reporting WeChat, MS Teams, and Zoom), phone or email
consultations, and education offered more often via phone, online or via postal mail to patients.

During COVID-19, 202 (42.3%) programs were only treating existing patients, while all others
were still accepting new patients; programs reported having the capacity to serve a median of
20.0 (Q25-27 =10.0-40.0) patients / month pre-COVID, and 3.0 (Q25-75=0.0-15.0) during. The
most common program adaptations were: reducing the number of program elements offered
(n=228, 19.5%), deferring graduation until post-program assessments could be completed
(n=120; 10.3%), shortening the program duration (n=95, 8.2%), and graduating patients more
quickly (n=85, 7.3%). On the other hand, 177 (15.1%) respondents reported adapting all program
elements to retain service levels (see Table 2 for adaptations by WHO region).
Table 3 displays the components that are delivered by CR programs, and continue to be
provided during the COVID-19 pandemic. As shown, most impacted was supervised exercise
training, resistance training, inclusion of family / informal caregivers, end of program reassessment, and functional capacity testing. Indeed, of the programs providing services or
without COVID-19 restrictions, 119 (14.5%) had changed the type of functional capacity test
they use. Of these, 30 (26.3%) were performing functional capacity testing remotely, most
commonly: a walk test (n=19; 1.6%), step test (n=6; 0.5%); 15 (1.3%) cited other tests, such as
the Duke Activity Status Index and timed sit-to-stand.
Of those that continued providing services, the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted the
way exercise is prescribed for 306 (37.5%) programs (e.g., virtual consultations with no
structured supervised exercise program), and monitored for 226 (27.8%; e.g., focus on rating of
perceived exertion rather than target heart rate, all done virtually). Where patients were
encouraged to exercise at home or in their community, the following changes were made to
manage patient symptoms, reporting or concerns: education about symptoms enhanced, regular

virtual (phone and online) consultations with CR staff were added, and patients were encouraged
to directly contact their physician if symptoms were experienced.
Furthermore, of programs continuing to provide services, in 111 (13.6%) programs, the
type of provider delivering CR had changed, and in 122 (15.0%) patients have had to interact
with a different provider (e.g., mainly one professional interacting with patients – mostly nurses,
as access to allied health care providers ceased due to COVID-19).
Online Appendix 2 provides details of patient education delivery modes and providers, in
light of the COVID-19 pandemic. As shown, there was a drastic reduction in exposure to all
disciplines. Modes of delivery were chiefly phone, email, online resources, and mail; live video
was only exploited in approximately 20% of programs. For those that offered it, education
session frequency before COVID-19 was 8.7±8.4 / month / patient (mean of 50.1±47.5 minutes /
session), dropping to 4.1±7.5 (mean of 20.2±26.0 minutes / session) during the pandemic.
Alternative / Remote Delivery of CR due to COVID-19
Reimbursement and delivery of alternative models (e.g., home-based) is shown in Table
4, including the proportion of patients served (shown before COVID by country elsewhere).30 Of
those delivering alternative models, 226 (31.7%) programs offered low-tech home-based (e.g.,
landlines, mail only), 175 (24.5%) offered high-tech home-based, 83 (11.7%) some hybrid
format with supervised and unsupervised sessions, 74 (10.4%) offered community-based, and 6
(0.9%) offered “other” models (e.g., livestream).
Forms of communication used in remote models are also shown in Table 4. Overall, 182
(62.8%) programs reported barriers to using these communication tools, most commonly: lack of
patient access (i.e., patients not having computer with email; n=146, 12.5%), difficulties for the
patients (e.g., lack of technical knowledge; n=111, 9.6%), logistical problems such as

connectivity issues (n=107, 9.2%), and difficulties for the clinical staff (e.g., being too busy, lack
of staff; n=53, 4.6%).
Barriers to delivering CR remotely were: patients did not have the technology to connect
with program staff remotely (n=195, 16.8%), lack of equipment /program resources for secure
and private remote delivery (n=148, 12.7%), insufficient funding (n=123, 10.5%), insufficient
staff (n=118, 10.1%), patients’ risk is too high for unsupervised exercise/safety concerns (n=111,
9.5%), too inefficient (i.e., cannot see as many patients because they do not offer remote program
elements in a group, but only individually; n=90, 7.7%), staff need training (n=90, 7.7%), and no
policy (n=69, 5.9%); other barriers (n=24, 2.1%) included language proficiency, remote delivery
not reimbursed, not enough referrals and hours.
Finally, to increase their capacity to deliver home-based/remote CR services to patients
(open-ended item), respondents perceived they would need: time to research and develop the
model (including appropriate services for illiterate patients); secure /private means for staff to
communicate with patients electronically; equipment to communicate remotely with patients
(e.g., multiple laptops with built-in cameras and microphones, headsets); facilities / space (e.g.,
videoconferencing in private room); home equipment to loan patients including tablets,
wearables/activity trackers for exercise monitoring and assessment of all risk factors (e.g.,
sphygmomanometers/cuffs); cheap and reliable wireless technology to monitor for adverse
events remotely (e.g., heart rate and rhythm); reliable and low-cost high-speed internet access for
staff and patients (including those living in rural and remote areas); a dedicated multidisciplinary
team (including more nurses and exercise physiologists); staff training (by those with experience
in remote models), physician champions; administrative staff to facilitate scheduling of virtual
sessions; a structured, evidence-based home-based CR program software platform or smartphone

app (including that it has capacity to reach groups of patients, that family / informal caregivers
can also access it, that it is comprehensive [e.g., includes structured exercise livestreaming,
education], and includes tracking diaries with two-way communication; or funding for
technology upgrades), with associated assessment tools (including functional capacity) and
policies to implement; technology support staff (with time) to train patients (potentially in-person
when they are in acute care) and staff to use the remote technology (e.g., zoom) and equipment,
and also for database management support; ability to have at least one safe in-person session
with each patient to ensure safety and education; financial resources as well as reimbursement of
remote model; and patient as well as provider awareness of availability of the remote model
(including referrals).
Impact on CR staff
CR team communication was also impacted. Overall, 295 (25.0%) reported having only
ad-hoc meetings as needed, 274 (23.0%) reported they were having routine staff meetings via
remote means (e.g., videoconferencing), 137 (11.8%) reported not being able to communicate as
much as needed (e.g., staff re-deployed, staff lack home technology), and 88 (7.6%) reported
they could not really communicate except via email.
Occupational impacts on staff are displayed in Table 5 by WHO region. Moreover, 114
(15.3%) staff reported feeling stigmatized outside of work for being a healthcare worker (i.e.,
greater risk of COVID-19 exposure), 275 (36.9%) felt valued for providing care, and 325
(43.6%) felt no stigma (others responded ‘not applicable’). Negative psychosocial impacts that
do or could impact their work are shown in Figure 1 (respondents were directed to check all that
apply; n=98, 8.4% responded ‘not applicable’ as they have experienced no COVID-19 impacts;

n=267, 22.8% of respondents reported no personal suffering due to COVID-19; and n=233,
20.0% have been using the opportunity to catch up on things and learn).
When asked whether they had the equipment (e.g., video camera, remote access to
hospital servers) and space / privacy to work from home efficiently during business hours, 198
(26.6%) responded affirmatively, 141 (19.0%) responded only for work that does not involve
patient care, and 272 (36.6%) reported no (for reasons provided including: no access to work
materials and hospital server remotely).
Table 5 also displays whether programs have treated suspected or COVID-19 positive
patients by WHO region, and associated concerns. Figure 2 displays perceived risk in contacting
COVID-19 through their CR work by country (global mean=30.0%±27.4). Generalized linear
mixed models, accounting for country as a higher-order variable, revealed degree of perceived
risk was associated with country stringency index (p=0.01), but not number of cases (p=0.80).
Impact on Patients
CR staff reported patients contacting them and expressing the following reservations and
concerns regarding COVID-19: whether they need to change their exercise prescriptions (n=337,
28.7%), adherence to a heart-healthy diet while concerned about going to grocery stores (n=333,
28.4%), about their mental well-being (n=331; 28.2%), using technology to interact with the
program (n=329, 27.9%), questions about medications (n=318, 26.9%), stopping exercise due to
a lack of space to exercise in their homes or inability to exercise outside without potential
COVID-19 exposure (n=303, 25.7%), questions about how to safely receive CR care without
COVID-19 exposure (n=255, 21.4%), their risk of death from COVID-19 due to pre-existing
CVD (n=249, 21.2%), and many patients contacted programs about reservations regarding
receiving CR care and staff had to let them know they closed down the program temporarily

(n=230, 19.6%). On the other hand, 142 (12.2%) reported patients had not really been contacting
the program more often due to COVID-19, and 62 (5.3%) reported patients seemed to be
avoiding contacting their programs at all, under the assumption that services were suspended.
Resumption of CR services
Overall, 273 (36.8%) reported that their institution had a policy regarding the
circumstances under which regular services could resume (for n=167, 22.5% this was not
applicable). Figure 3 illustrates the factors that respondents perceive should form the basis for
resumption of face-to-face CR services given COVID-19. Other responses included: number of
deaths reduced for 2 consecutive weeks, as well as when government allows gyms to open for
business and instructs hospitals to open outpatient services.
Discussion
This first-ever global survey on the impacts of COVID-19 on outpatient rehabilitation has
confirmed that the impact of this infectious disease goes well beyond those suffering from it,
affecting availability, structure, delivery format, and components of chronic disease care, as well
as the mental health of CR providers and patients alike. Given that three-quarters of responding
programs reported complete or temporary cessation of services, we estimate COVID-19 has been
responsible for the closure of approximately 4400 CR programs worldwide; it is unknown when
or if these programs will resume care delivery. Capacity was incredibly low in the programs that
remained open (i.e., 3 patients/month, with no new patients) and key risk-reducing components
were no longer delivered in more than 60% of on-going programs, including supervised exercise
training. This substantial service loss will likely result in greater CVD morbidity and mortality in
the coming months and years, further straining already-taxed healthcare systems.

While we must be guided by evidence on transmission and efficacy of protective
measures, and monitor progress with regard to vaccination and treatment, results of the study can
inform safe resumption of CR services. American [31], British [17] and Canadian [32] CR
Associations have published recommendations on resuming face-to-face CR services, which
include external and internal (patient, staff, and program) considerations; most of these were also
identified as paramount in our study. Specifically, program respondents perceived the bases for
resumption of in-person CR services in the context of COVID-19 should chiefly be availability
of personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff and patients, screening capacity for COVID-19
symptoms before every in-person visit, sufficient testing capacity, and no CR staff redeployment.
The optimal CR setup once services resume is also unknown. Although considered a
good option to continue CR during to the COVID-19 pandemic [15-17], over 60% of programs
did not offer any remote model of CR delivery. Many did however, despite the fact that it is not
reimbursed in most jurisdictions. Studies have shown that home-based models of CR have
similar effects in improving clinical outcomes and quality of life in cardiac patients compared to
center-based models [16,33]. Programs that already had remote services significantly increased
the proportion of patients served through this modality. Programs are actively trying to continue
to deliver CR during this challenging time, but face many barriers, including development of the
remote model, as well as the associated policies, and acquiring and learning the new technologies
to support this.
To balance both infection risk and risk of an adverse event, some in-person contact at the
beginning of the CR program was advocated, following screening and with PPE (indeed onequarter of respondents were concerned about delivery due to lack of PPE), perhaps at reduced
volume to enable physical distancing. Programs have transitioned to using different functional

capacity testing methods to inform exercise prescription and different means to monitor exercise.
There was great interest in using technology to remotely monitor risk factors, with the goal of
loaning required equipment to patients during their program. Most CR components could then be
safely delivered through remote means, with the use chiefly of webcam/videoconferencing where
resources and supports exist. The significant drop in amount of patient education was
concerning; comprehensive, evidence-based virtual patient education is available open access in
8 languages for programs to use [34]. Of note, ICCPR is supporting programs worldwide in
transitioning to such lower-risk forms of delivery, by connecting members to share best
practices, collating patient and provider resources on our website [35], as well as offering - and
promoting other societies’ - free CR webinars to increase provider knowledge. Research is now
needed on implementation, patient engagement and outcomes with COVID-adapted CR, as well
as cost.
The social restriction, anxiety and occupational impacts resulting from coronaviruses
adversely affects the psychological well-being of healthcare workers, and this impact can be
substantial and long-lasting [36-38]. Although about a fifth of respondents in this study reported
they have been coping “alright” with COVID-19, many are experiencing anxiety, fear of
exposing family, loneliness, difficulty sleeping, and stress due to higher workloads (including
answering many questions from patients about their concerns). Over a third felt the need to work
despite perceived risk, due to fear of losing their job or pay (and one in five had no sick pay).
Approximately a third of CR program respondents had been redeployed, rendering it impossible
to deliver CR services without staff. Almost 10% have needed to work double-duty, serving as
caregivers during business hours. The inequities uncovered by this outbreak [39] are also
evidenced in the data from this study, with variation in occupational / economic and

psychosocial impacts by WHO region (although inferential tests were not performed due to some
small cell sizes).
Caution is warranted in interpreting the findings of this study. First, this was a
convenience sample; results may be biased, representing mainly programs that still had some
staff working and available to respond to the survey. However, there was good representation
from programs in community and academic hospitals alike. We did assume that each response
was received from a unique program, however it is possible different staff members from the
same program completed a survey, given most respondents were working remotely. Response
rate was lower in the Americas and Europe, so generalizability to those regions is more
questionable; country representation was high, however. Second, the reliability and validity of
the survey is unknown; it was pilot-tested, but responses in a random subsample of programs
were not verified against actual delivery. Programs may have responded in a socially-desirable
manner, although the survey was confidential. Third, because of small cell sizes in some case,
inferential comparisons by WHO region could not be performed. Finally, since the survey was
mainly completed in English, some concepts could have been misunderstood by respondents for
whom English was not their first language.
Conclusion
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted CR programs worldwide, including cessation of
services or of initiation of new patients, a decrease in CR components delivered, change of mode
delivery without much opportunity for planning and training, as well as psychosocial and
economic impact on healthcare providers. Technology is seen as a safe means to ensure cardiac
patients receive the care they need during this difficult time, within the context of screening,
testing and sufficient PPE. Remote delivery is not often reimbursed, and therefore advocacy is
