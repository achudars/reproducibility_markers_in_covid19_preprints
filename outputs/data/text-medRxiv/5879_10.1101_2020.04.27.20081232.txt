We evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 control strategies of 25 countries
which have endured more than four weeks of community infections. With
an extended SEIR model that allows infections in both the exposed and infected states, the key epidemic parameters are estimated from each country’s
data, which facilitate the evaluation and cross-country comparison. It is found
quicker control measures significantly reduce the average reproduction numbers and shorten the time length to infection peaks. If the swift control measures of Korea and China were implemented, average reductions of 88% in
the confirmed cases and 80% in deaths would had been attained for the other

23 countries from start to April 10. Effects of earlier or delayed interventions
in the US and the UK are experimented which show at least 75% (29%) less
infections and deaths can be attained for the US (the UK) under a Five-Day
Earlier experiment. The impacts of two removal regimes (Korea and Italy) on
the total infection and death tolls on the other countries are compared with
the natural forecast ones, which suggest there are still ample opportunity for
countries to reduce the final death numbers by improving the removal process.

Introduction
The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to the world causing a pandemic
with more than 2 millions infections and more than 148 thousands deaths world wide (1) on
April 19th, 2020. There have been studies for the effects of early control measures taken in
China: (2–4) on public health interventions and control strategies on Wuhan’s outbreaks; (5) on
Wuhan travel ban on the spread of COVID-19 inside China and (6) on both the domestic and
international implications of Wuhan travel ban; (7) on the transmissibility and severity in mainland Chinese locations outside Hubei. Three months after Wuhan being sealed off, there are
more than 25 countries which have endured at least four weeks of community infections with
good amount of epidemic data accrued (8–10). Given the unprecedented pressure on nations’
healthcare systems and the deaths so far, there is an urgent need to learn from these countries’
paths when other countries plan to counter the epidemic.
Our evaluation is based an extended SEIR model (11–15) with time varying coefficient
(vSEIdR model) that permits infections in both the Infected state and the Exposed state to reflect
the COVID-19 clinical reality that more infections are made before cases being diagnosed (16).
We provide frequentist estimates to the infection, diagnosis and removal rates, and the effective
reproduction number Rt which may be time-varying. The latter allows capturing the changing

dynamics in the spread of the virus and to assess the effects of different policy scenarios.
Twenty-one out of the twenty five countries have reached the turning point of infection
defined as the first day that Rt < 1 since the start of community infection. The average time to
the turning point is 34.1 days (SE 2.27), but among the 10 countries which took action to reduce
person to person contacts sooner (see Table A1 for specifics), the average time to the turning
points is 28.7 days (3.5), which is significantly (p-value 0.026) lower than the later action group
(mean 37.8, SE 2.7). Taking early control measures is also effective in reducing the infection
rates leading to suppressing the effective reproduction numbers Rt by 0.819 (p-value 0.007 ) in
weeks 2-4 after the start of the epidemic between the quick and slow action groups of countries.
China (excluding Hubei Province) and Korea are found to be the most effective in bring
down the reproduction of COVID-19 in the first four weeks of community infections (Table 1
and Figure 1). The benefits of acting early in reducing both the infection size and total deaths
are demonstrated by counter-factual calculations under the Korea and China scenarios. Figure
2 shows reductions of 1.20 million (1.26 millions) infected cases and 75,105 (79,543) deaths
among the 23 countries would be made if Korea (China)’s daily reduction percentage in the
infection rates are adopted from Day 8 of each country’s start of community infection to April
10, while maintaining each country’s removal and diagnostic rates. These numbers mount to
86% (90%) and 78% (82%) of the total infected cases and deaths of the 23 countries on April
10th, respectively.
That taking control measures sooner can significantly impact the sizes of epidemics and
deaths can be shown without having to mimic Korea and China’s experiences. For the US and
the UK, if policy interventions were made to ensure the declines in the Rt from March 13 for the
US (17) and March 20 for the UK (18) happened five days earlier (delayed), the US would have
the cases and the deaths reduced (increased) by about 80% and 75% (71% and 53%), and the
UK by 40% and 29% (61% and 40%), respectively, relative to the observed statistics on April

10 (Figure 4). The US and the UK experiments also inform the role played by the diagnosis
rate α that regulates the speed of movement from the exposed state to the infected (diagnosed)
state. In particular, if the UK’s low diagnosis rate (0.1) were applied to the US (0.17), both
the infection cases and the deaths would be increased by 314% and 213% under the Five-Day
delayed setting.
The study shows that the removal processes (recovery and death rates) are influential in
determining the death tolls for most of the 25 countries while also so on the infection cases for
countries which have not reach the turning point. Relative to each country’s so-called natural
forecasting designs, the deaths would increase by 169.1% in average among the 24 countries
under the Italian removal regime. However, Under the Korea’s removal rates, the deaths would
decline by an average of 26.7%. Therefore, there are still ample opportunities for countries to
substantially reduce the final death tolls if the removal processes can be improved.

Effective reproduction numbers
We did not include data from Hubei province where Wuhan is the capital city for China due to
incomplete observation before January 16, 2020. This actually makes the epidemic of the 25
countries more comparable as they are all started with imported cases.
We first estimate the time varying daily infection rate βt and the effective reproduction number Rt under the time-varying coefficient SEIdR model for the 25 countries. The starting date
of local transmission (Table 1) is identified from the estimated infection rates and by checking
on each country’s early epidemic data and the date given by the WHO (9). Table 1 also reports
the estimated reproduction numbers Rt on the start date, and their weekly averages over the
next four weeks. Figure 1 displays the Rt curves.
The average reproductive numbers on the start, which may be viewed as the basic reproduction number R0 , was 5.70 (SE: 0.37) among the 25 countries with the lower and upper 25%

quartiles being 4.57 and 6.26. The 14 European countries had the highest R0 , averaged at 5.82
(SE: 0.50). See Table S1 in Supplementary Material (SM) for the 95% confidence intervals of
R0 . As R0 is known to be subject to over-estimation (19) with high volatility, one may look at
the average Rt in the 1st week after the start of local transmission, which were averaged at 4.35
(SE: 0.23). Our estimates of R0 were higher than most of the R0 s from the existing studies on
COVID-19, mostly under the SEIR models, for instance 2–3 from (20, 21) on Wuhan and 3.15
(3.04-3.26) in (5). Our estimate of R0 for non-Hubei China (4.78) was closer to (22) (R0 = 5.7
for Wuhan). A reason for our higher R0 is that the vSEIdR model allows infection prior to
clinical diagnosis as reflected by the Rt having two terms from equation (S.4) in SM, reflecting the infections made in the Exposed (pre-diagnosis) and Infected (Diagnosed) compartments
respectively.

Effectiveness of Korea and China’s approaches
Figure 1 shows that China and Korea’s Rt curves fell sharply below the other 23 countries’
over most of the four weeks after the start dates. Their rapid decline in the reproducing power
was well reflected in Table 1 as their average Rt over the four weeks were 1.03 and 1.54,
respectively. In contrast, 20 countries had the four week average larger than 2.0, and 10 of them
more than 3.0. Not only that the absolute infectiousness of Korea and China were the lowest
over the four weeks, their cumulative percentages of declines were the most as shown in Table
S2. The drastic decline in the reproduction of China echos recent studies on the effectiveness
of Chine’s control measures (23, 24). Behind Korea and China’s rapid declines in their Rt
were two similar but not the same strategies. China’s measures are largely based on limitation
of population movement and contacts by sealing off cities and enforcing high levels of selfisolation at homes (5, 25), which led to rapid reduction in the contact rates (2, 26). In addition
to limiting population contacts, and a quick blockade of Daegu, Korean conducted more active

testing for potential infections in the population with more than half million tests being carried
out in the first four weeks (27, 28), which is an extra from China’s largely population isolation
approach. In additional to the significant effects on the average reproduction numbers Rt and
the time to turning point by taking action to restrict population contacts earlier (Panels (a)-(b) in
Figure 3), there are some evidence for lowering the death number and the infection number per
100,000 population (Panels (c)-(d) in Figure 3) by taking action earlier, although not significant
due to other likely confounding factors including the varying degrees of enforcement on the
control measures and differential medical capability.

Epidemic projections under Korea and China’s scenarios
Given the effectiveness of Korea and China’s approaches in containing COVID-19, we generate
scenarios for other countries that mimic Korea and China’s daily reduction percentages in the
infection rates from the 8th day since the start of local transmission, while keeping their diagnosis rate, recovery and death rates intact. The generated hypothetical infection rates after Day
8 (shown in Figures S1 and S2 in SM) create scenarios for other countries should the control
measures of Korea and China were implemented.
Comparing to the actual cases observed up to April 10, Figure 2 shows that 1.20 (1.26)
millions total reductions in the confirmed cases and 75,105 (79,543) reduction in deaths for
the 23 countries under the Korea’s (China’s) scenario, mounting to 88% and 80% reductions
of the confirmed cases and deaths in average, respectively (more details in Table S3–S5). The
reductions in the cases and deaths would be phenomenal for US, UK, Germany, Australia,
Japan and France, attaining more than 89% reduction in the confirmed cases and 74% reduction
in deaths under Korea’s scenario, if control measures were implemented earlier which would
lead to the reductions in the infectious rates from Day 8 of community transmission. And those
under China’s scenario would be about a few percentage points more.

Evaluation on the US and the UK
We consider two policy intervention experiments specific to the US and the UK, which represent
early and delayed implementation of counter-COVID-19 measures. March 13 and March 20
represented the dates of firm policy measures by the US and the UK governments, respectively,
when the US declared the national emergency and the UK started to close schools and public
facilities. It appears from Figure 4 that sustained declining trend of Rt was established after
March 13 and March 20 for the US and the UK, respectively. The experimental design of FiveDay Earlier intervention would mean the Rt curves start to decline from March 8 for the US
and March 15 for the UK at the actual daily declines rates from March 13 and 20, respectively.
The Five-Day Delayed experiments is to mimic later actions that would delay the decline in Rt
from March 13 and 20 for five days to March 18 and 25, respectively. Panels (a)-(b) of Figure
4 display the actual Rt curves with the hypothetical ones under the two designs.
The total numbers of confirmed cases and death cases under the two experiments are reported in Figure 4 (c)–(f) (Table S10 for specific numbers) along with the observed statistics
up to April 10. Our result shows that by acting earlier both countries would see substantial
reductions in the total number of infected cases and deaths: the US would see the cases and the
deaths reduced by about 80% and 75% respectively; and the UK by 40% and 29% respectively.
In contrast, under the Five-Day Delayed postulations, the US would see the cases and deaths
increase by 71% and 53%, and the UK by 61% and 40%, respectively.
The above results indicate that the US is more responsive to the intervention than the UK,
as the earlier (delayed) intervention would reduce (increase) more infection cases and deaths
than the UK. This can be explained in several aspects. First, the absolute decline of US’s Rt is
2.23, more than the UK’s 1.75 over the two weeks from March 13 and March 20, although the
relative declines were comparable at 52% and 51%, respectively. Second, the US implemented

the intervention relatively earlier as March 13 was the 14th day after the US’s start date while
March 20 was the 24th days for the UK. Thus, the US would have more time to amplify the
effect of the intervention.
A less obvious reason for the differential sensitivity lays in the estimated diagnosed rates:
0.17 for the US and 0.1 for the UK, implying the UK having longer time for diagnosing the
infected than the US. The larger diagnosis rate for the US means quicker turn-over time from
expose to diagnosis, which would bring early peak time for the confirmed infected cases I(t)
and reduce the size of infections and hence the death number. Our result shows the numbers
of cases and deaths for the US with the UK’s diagnosis rate (0.10) would make the US cases
amplified by more than 243 % and the deaths by 171% under Five-Day Delay design. For the
UK with the US’s higher diagnosis rate (0.17), there would be a further 10% reduction in the
number of confirmed cases under 5-Day Early design, where the impacts on the death was not
significant. A high diagnosis rate is part of the Korea’s counter COVID-19 strategy.

Forecasting and projections
We consider future courses of the COVID-19 epidemic by forecasting the sizes of total infections, deaths and the peak active infection number of a country. The forecasting requires first
projecting the key parameters of the epidemic processes, which we do under two designs (Natural Designs 1 and 2) for each country. The two designs impose two minimum recovery rates:
γr,min = 1/17.5 based on the clinical results (16, 29, 30) and γr,min = 1/28 with a two week
transitional period, as some countries (the UK, Holland, Brazil, Norway) have severe underreporting for the recovered (see the unseemly high proportion of death in the total removal rate
in Table S6 in SM), while leaving the infection, diagnosis and removal rate due to death naturally determined by each country’s epidemic forcing. We also conduct parallel projections by
replacing the recovery rate (γr,t ) and the removal rates due to death (γd,t ) by those of Korea and

Italy, respectively, to generate comparative results. Korea’s latest death rate γd,t = 0.001 which
is about one fifth of Italy’s (0.0050) while its total removal rate (0.0412) is more than twice of
Italy’s (0.0185). Thus, the Korea removal situation represents a more effective treatment, faster
recovery with less death regime, while Italy’s is of a much overwhelmed system with relatively
high γd,t and low γr,t .
The projected total deaths vary substantially to the four designs, especially to the Italy and
Korea removal regimes, relative to the two Natural designs as shown in Figure 5. With the Italian removal rates, the deaths would increase by 169.1% in average among the 24 countries, and
11 countries would increase by more than 200%. Under the Korea’s removal rates, the deaths
would reduce by 26.7% in average, and for five countries, the US, the UK, Belgium, Sweden
and Canada, the deaths would be more than halved, as compared to the predicted casualties
under the Natural Designs. In contrast to the deaths, the predicted total infected cases (Figure
6) are less responsive to the designs, especially for countries which have had their Rt < 1
on April 19th as the low Rt s cushion much of the design differences for the projected final
cases. It is also due to the four designs all used the same infection and diagnosis rates. The
differences in the numbers of infected cases and deaths between the two Natural Designs are
not much for almost all countries, although Design 1 (γr,min = 1/17.5) leads to less infections
and deaths in general for countries whose recovery rate has not reached 1/17.5 benefited by a
shorter infectious period.

Methods
Data
We consider 25 countries in our study as listed in Table 1, which have experienced COVID-19
with at least four weeks of established community infections. The daily records of infected,
dead and recovered patients are obtained from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems

Science and Engineering (8) and WHO (9) for the 25 countries, supplemented by these nations’
official health ministry’s statistics and Dingxiangyuan Pneumonia website (10). The population
sizes are from the United Nation (31).

Time-varying coefficient SEIdR model
Let S(t), E(t), I(t) and R(t) be the counts of the susceptible, exposed, infected and removed
persons in a country at time t, respectively, where R(t) is the sum of the recovered Rr (t) and
the death Rd (t). We propose an extended varying coefficient Susceptible-Exposed-InfectedRecovered (vSEIdR) model, which extends the SIR (11) and SEIR models (14) by allowing
infections in the exposed E state. This would better capture the COVID-19 reality that most
infections are made before clinical diagnosed.
The vSEIdR model has the following differential equations for the conditional Poisson
means of the daily increments given the observation prior to date t:
dS(t)

dI(t)

where βtE , βtI , γr,t and γd,t are time-varying functions, representing the infection rates of the
unconfirmed exposure group and the confirmed infected group, the recovery rate and the death
rate, respectively, and γt = γd,t + γr,t is the total removal rate. The diagnostic rate α is regarded
as a constant, though extension to make it varying can be readily made.
The effective reproduction number under vSEIdR is
Rt = β̃tI /γt + β̃tE /α,

where β̃tI = βtI S(t)/M and β̃tE = βtE S(t)/M , where M is the population size. As quite some
countries have severe under-reporting in the recovered cases as reflected in the unseemly high
proportion of death in the total removal rate in Table S6 in SM, we take γt = 1/14 in calculating
Rt based on the clinical results for COVID-19 (16).

Estimation
The reported numbers of confirmed infections are subject to measurement errors. To reduce the
errors, we apply a weighted average with boundary kernel on the daily new infection number
and new recovery number. Our estimation is based on the smoothed data. We assume the
infectious rate β̃tE in the E-state is r-times of that in the I-state for a fixed constant r > 1 and
all t. We first estimate β̃tE , γr,t and γd,t under a fixed diagnosis rate α. The estimation of α is
attained via the leave-one-out cross validation based on the fitting performance. See the SM for
more details.
Let N (t) = I(t) + R(t) be the total number of accumulative infections at time t. Let
∆S(t), ∆E(t), ∆N (t), ∆Rr (t) and ∆Rd (t) be the daily changes in the compartments. From
the progression of the epidemic in (1), we have the daily increase of new exposed and confirmed
infections as
∆E(t) = (β̃tE − α)E(t) + β̃tE I(t)/r and ∆N (t) = αE(t),

(3)

respectively. This implies we can estimate β̃tE by a kernel weighted local regression of E(t +
1) + (α − 1)E(t) on E(t) + I(t)/r with imputed values for the unobserved numbers of the
pre-diagnosed infections E(t). Similarly, γr,t and γd,t can be estimated by a local weighted
regression of ∆Rr (t) and ∆Rd (t) on I(t), respectively. To conduct statistical inference for the
estimates, we generate parametric bootstrap processes under the stochastic vSEIdR model with
Poisson increment and the estimated parameters from the original data. The parameters βtE , βtI ,
γr,t and γd,t are re-estimated using the bootstrap resampled data, and their confidence intervals

are constructed based on the re-centered bootstrap estimates. See SM for more details.

Start and Action Dates
The start date for established community transmission of a country is determined by considering
the time when new confirmed cases of local infection emerges, the start date provided by the
WHO for local infection (9) and the estimated infection rate under the vSEIdR model. The start
date is determined by the first local maximum of the estimated infection rate after the WHO
date.
The action dates for COVID-19 control measures are provided in Table S1 based on both
governmental and credible media sources. When a series of measures are implemented over a
time window, the middle date of the time window is used as the action time.

Designs for scenario analyses
We project the numbers of confirmed infections and death under the Korea and China scenarios
and earlier and delayed interventions for US and UK. The projections are made based on the hypothetical infectious rate under those scenarios and the proposed vSEIdR model, while keeping
each country’s other epidemic parameters: the diagnose rate α, the recovery and death rates γr,t
and the γd,t the same. The hypothetical infectious rates are constructed by applying the daily
change of the estimated infectious rates of Korea and China from the 8th day since their starts
of steady community transmission (Korea and China’s scenarios), or those of the UK and the
US since their interventions to the target dates of scenario analysis. Figures S1, S2 in SM and
Figure 4 display the projected infection rates and the effective reproduction numbers Rt under
those scenarios.

Prediction
The prediction for the infection rates βtE and βtI is attained by fitting the reciprocal model

on their empirical estimates of the last 7 days before April 20, where a, b and η are unknown
parameters and et is an error term, and then projecting with the fitted parameters. The death
and recovery rates γd,t and γr,t are set as the averages of the immediate past 7 days, and the
diagnosis rate α is kept as the empirical estimates based on the whole data. See Table S6 for
their estimated values.
For long term prediction, due to the under-reporting of recovery numbers in many countries
as shown in Table S6, we set the long term removal rate for each country to be the maximum of
their empirical estimates and γr,min , where γr,min = 1/17.5 or 1/28 based on the clinical results
(29, 30) with a two week transitional period. We call the above settings as the Natural Designs
1 and 2 for each country, respectively. In all forecasting designs, each country’s projected
infectious rate is used. The future projection of the epidemic is made based on the epidemic
progression given in equations (1). Detailed procedures are provided in SM.
To assess the forecasting performance of the proposed model, we consider short term prediction with empirical removal rates for new infections in the next 7 days after April 13 and the
next 14 days after April 6. Table S7 and Figure S4 in SM report the 7-day and 14-day prediction
errors for the 24 countries. We see that the error percentages for the number of new infections of
the 7-day and 14-day predictions were generally small, around 11.8% and 17.1% respectively,
which justify the vSEIdR model and indicates its utility in epidemic prediction.

Discussion
Our study shows that both the sizes of infection and the deaths of COVID-19 are particularly
responsive to early containment measures as verified not only by the results from Korea and
China, but also by the potential outcomes generated under the counter-factual experiments for
the US and the UK. The roles of the removal rates are also important in particular to the final
death tolls, and less so for the infection sizes for countries having had their Rt fell below 1.
There are several critical lessons one can deduce from the 25 countries’ COVID-19 experiences,
especially for countries who are about to experience the first wave of the epidemic. The first
one is to take action as early as possible to reduce the contact rates so as to reduce the infection
rates and the Rt . Acting early can hugely impact the infection size and thus lessen demands
on medical resources down the track, and eventually improve the removal processes for those
infected. The second lesson is to maintain a certain level of the diagnostic rate to speed up
the epidemic progression as favorably shown in Korea, and the US and the UK diagnosis-rateexchange experiment. Finally, at any stage of the epidemic, improving the recovery rates is
always effective in reducing the deaths and the infection size as well.
