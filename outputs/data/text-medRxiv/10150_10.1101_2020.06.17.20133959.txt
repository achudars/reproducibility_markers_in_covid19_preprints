Abstract
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten various regions around the world, obtaining accurate and reliable COVID-19 data is crucial for governments and local communities aiming at rigorously assessing the extent and magnitude of the virus spread and
deploying eﬃcient interventions. Using data reported between January and February
2020 in China, we compared counts of COVID-19 from near-real time spatially disaggregated data (city-level) with ﬁne-spatial scale predictions from a Bayesian downscaling regression model applied to a reference province-level dataset. The results highlight
discrepancies in the counts of coronavirus-infected cases at district level and identify
districts that may require further investigation.

1. Introduction
By the end of December 2019, a pneumonia of unknown cause was identiﬁed in
Wuhan, Hubei province. The World Health Organization (WHO) temporarily named the
cause of the pneumonia severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV2).
The disease associated with the syndrome took the name coronavirus disease 2019

or COVID19 [1–3] . On the 30th of January 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of
COVID19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, the highest level of
international emergency response given to infectious diseases [4] . By June 9th 2020,
COVID-19, had spread worldwide, infected more than 7 million individuals, and had
led to about 400,000 deaths (conﬁrmed cases that died) worldwide [5] .
Eﬀorts have been made by various institutions to collect near-real time data at city
level (disaggregated data) on COVID-19 worldwide and to make it publicly available [6–9] .
While there is a race against time to contain the outbreak, reliability and accuracy of
COVID-19 data should remain a top priority for the research community. Policymakers require evidence-based analysis to design and implement eﬃcient interventions to
mitigate and prevent the spread of the virus. A key condition for eﬃcient evidencebased interventions is to ensure that policy recommendations are based on reliable data
measured with suﬃcient accuracy [10] .
COVID-19 is part of a large family of coronaviruses, which seems to have transferred
from animals to humans between November and December 2019, according to the phylogeny of genomic sequences obtained from early cases [11] . Recent work showed that
COVID-19 can transfer quickly and easily among individuals [12] . While the symptoms
are often mild, the virus seems to be more lethal for old people and individuals with
preexisting medical conditions [4] . A large number of countries are highly vulnerable to
a COVID-19 epidemic. Globally, only 50% of countries have a national infection prevention and control program and about 30% of countries have no COVID-19 national
preparedness and response plans [13] .
The establishment of containment areas, production and distribution of respiratory
masks, and the delivery of urgent medical care tend to be very costly [4,14] . To improve
the eﬃciency of interventions, and hence, reduce the number of infected individuals
and associated fatalities, epidemiological models based on geolocalized data can be employed to: (a) make inference on the true number of cases in spatial locations; (b) investigate the mechanisms behind the spread of the virus; (c) identify locations at risk; (d)
quantify and forecast the spread of the virus at ﬁne spatial scales to help decision makers
target interventions.
Epidemiological models using geolocalized data require suﬃcient accuracy with regard to both the number counts and the spatial locations of the reported cases. In order to assess data accuracy, we compare two major providers of spatially disaggregated
COVID-19 data with province-level data from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU) [15] . An exploratory analysis based on reported
data in China from January to February 2020 indicates that both the number of coronainfected cases from disaggregated datasets and the spatial locations of the reported cases
exhibit important divergences between the investigated datasets. We further investigate
diﬀerences in the counts at a ﬁne spatial scale (district-level) between reported values
from spatially disaggregated datasets and values estimated from a Bayesian downscaling modeling approach.

The downscaling approach presented in this paper estimates the counts of COVID-19
and its uncertainty at ﬁne-scale (5 km grid-cells) using spatially aggregated (provincelevel) data and covariates (5 km grid-cells) as input. Predictions from the downscaling model are compared at district-level with COVID-19 from spatially disaggregated
datasets. The results of this analysis suggest that COVID-19 counts reported by the
disaggregated datasets are often consistent with the range of plausible estimated counts
from the downscaling model, however data coverage and discrepancies in the counts
remain important in various districts. The resulting maps can be visualized in an ESRI
dashboard (https://arcg.is/0O8GDX).

As an initial exploratory analysis, we examine two fundamental metrics on COVID19: the number of conﬁrmed COVID-19 infected cases and the locations of the reported cases. We investigate two major providers of COVID-19 spatially disaggregated data which provide the location (longitude, latitude) of cities and the date of reported coronavirus-infected cases. We compare two disaggregated datasets: (1) Xu et al.
data [16] and (2) The Paper data. Xu et al. data has been published in Scientiﬁc Data [16]
and publicly available through GitHub repository [8,9] . The Paper data is provided by the
Pengpai news agency [6] , also refers to as The Paper. The disaggregated data from the
two providers are regularly updated online. In this case study, we compare them with
province-level data provided by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science
and Engineering (JHU) [15] .
First, we compared the count of conﬁrmed COVID-19 infected cases reported from
January to February 2020 in China at province level. For consistency, we used data
that has been updated by the investigated databases on the same day (April 9, 2020).
In Hubei province—the Chinese province most aﬀected by coronavirus—the reported
number of COVID-19 infected cases shows large diﬀerences among the databases: JHU
(65,914 cases), The Paper (58,292 cases), and Xu et al. (20,336 cases).
For the sake of readability, we split the results into two groups: high-impacted
provinces counting a maximum number of COVID-19 cases (all providers combined)
larger than the median (Fig 1, left panel) and low-impacted provinces counting a maximum number of COVID-19 cases (all providers combined) smaller or equal to the median (Fig 1, right panel). We observe important discrepancies in other provinces (Fig 1)
between the reported cases provided by The Paper and Xu et al. with JHU data. This may
suggest that the providers use diﬀerent collection methodologies and control processes
to gather and select the cases.
Second, we examine spatial variability of the data measured as the number of unique
spatial coordinates associated with the reported COVID-19 cases. JHU is excluded from
this comparison since it does not provide spatial coordinates along with the reported

cases provided by Xu et al. and The Paper only. We illustrate the results for cases
reported in Hubei province. In this province, The Paper (Fig 2, left panel) provides nine
locations with reported cases. Fig 2 (right panel) shows that the number of locations that
reported cases is systematically higher in Xu et al. compared to the Paper data (except
in Hebei province).

disaggregation which implements in R a Bayesian approach to carry out spatial disaggregation modeling, also called downscaling [17] . Similar approaches have been recently used to estimate ﬁne-scale (grid-cell) risk of disease based on spatially aggregated
(polygon-level) data [18–23] .
We apply a downscaling method to estimate cases of COVID-19 and their uncertainty within ﬁne grid-cells (about 5km spatial resolution) in China from JHU data aggregated at province-level [15] . The model is implemented in template model builder
(TMB) [24] ), an R package that provides a suitable framework based on C++ to build and
eﬃciently ﬁt hierarchical Bayesian models, including downscaling models. The model

predictions are compared with observed values from the two disaggregated data: Xu et
al. [16] and the Paper [6] .
Making predictions at a spatial scale ﬁner than the input data is subject to potential
validity threats that result from a mismatch between the scale from which the data and
the prediction are considered [25] . One issue, known as the “ecological fallacy” has been
well documented in geography and spatial epidemiology since the early 1950s [26] . A
classical example is the study of Durkheim (Le Suicide, 1897), whose analysis showed
that suicide rates in Prussia were highest in provinces that were heavily Protestants and
wrongly concluded that stronger social control among Catholics would result in lower
suicide rates. The author did not envision that it may have been non-Protestants (primarily Catholics) who were committing suicide in predominantly Protestant provinces [27] .
Analogously, an observed relationship between average population density and the risk
of COVID-19 at province-level may not hold at city-level.
A second issue is associated with the eﬀects of the choice of spatial units on the results. This potential validity threat refers to the “modiﬁable areal unit problem” (MAUP),
well known by geographers and epidemiologists [28] . Within a lattice framework which
uses polygons deﬁned as the spatial unit, one needs to choose the shape (regular or irregular polygons) and size of the polygons used to make predictions at a desired spatial
scale [29] . To avoid the risk of ecological fallacy and mitigate the eﬀect of the MAUP, the
downscaling approach used here takes beneﬁt of the spatial information gathered from
ﬁne-scale covariates to model the underlying processes behind the observed data that
explain the spatial variations of COVID-19 counts within provinces.
We model the count of coronavirus-infected cases yi, j for each 5 km grid-cell j that
lies within each Chinese province (polygon i), with N the total number of provinces. A
continuous-space data-generating process is discretized into 5 km grid-cells from which
data is aggregated and estimates are generated. In this framework, we consider the total
count of COVID-19 in a given province yi as the sum of each individual count yi, j in all
grid-cells that cover province i. We model the incidence rate, a relevant risk metric of
COVID-19 that is deﬁned as the number of new coronavirus-infected during our investigated period (January-February 2020), divided by the population at the beginning of the
period.
The incidence rate λi, j in pixel j of polygon i is associated via a log link function to a
linear predictor ηi, j composed of an intercept β0 , Nq covariates xqi, j with coeﬃcients βq ,
a spatial random ﬁeld ζ(i, j), and an i.i.d random eﬀect ui associated with each province
(i = 1, . . . , N):

in each polygon. The predicted sum of the counts from each grid-cell over a province
is weighted by the population size values in the corresponding grid-cell extracted from
a population raster (see Fig 3) [30] . The estimated incidence rate corresponds to the ex∑N j
pected cases divided by the weights, with λi = µi / j=1
ai, j . Moreover, λi, j is linked to
the linear predictor through a log function so that one can derive the incidence rate as
λi, j = exp(ηi, j ), where ηi, j is the linear predictor, observed in a bounded spatial window
D delimited by the Chinese national border.
The linear predictor includes Nq covariates xq (i, j), with coeﬃcients βq (q = 1, . . . , Nq ).
Covariates associated with COVID-19 infections are numerous and operate at various
spatial levels, from the host genetics to large-scale transnational factors that aﬀect travel
between countries for example. To make predictions at pixel-level (about 5 km resolution), we gather covariate data from various sources, mainly raster data (covariates
aggregated into regular grids) which cover China. Climate and meteorological factors
can aﬀect the life cycle of respiratory diseases and their propensity to spread [31] . However the extent of the role of climate drivers on the spread of COVID-19 compared to
those associated with human behaviour is not well understood [32] . COVID-19’s transmission can potentially occur in any ecological context by human contact. Therefore,
the main drivers of the transmission of COVID-19 are likely to be associated with human behaviour rather than environmental factors [33] . We consider mainly covariate data
that are associated with human activity and behaviour and include only a few relevant
environmental variables. We also note that we are not making predictions outside of the
area or time of study but restrict our analysis to the downscaling of cases in China which
avoids many of the main issues associated with using ﬁne-scale covariates.
COVID-19 appears to transfer rapidly and easily among humans, with a basic reproductive number R0 (also called transmission rate) seemingly between 2 and 3. R0 represents the expected number of direct infections from one case in a completely susceptible
population [34] . This means that, one person infected by COVID-19, in a completely
susceptible population, transfers on average the virus to 2 or 3 people [4] . The basic reproductive rate depends on various factors associated with the virus itself and the risk of
individuals transferring the virus, directly or indirectly, to other individuals as well.
We consider six covariates (1-6) with full coverage in China at 5 km resolution
(Fig 3). The selected set of covariates include proxies for human activity, population
density, and transportation: (1) travel time to the nearest city of with more than 50,000
inhabitants (access) [35] , (2) population size (pop) from WorldPop [30] , and (3) urbanity
(urban) from Global Urban Footprint data [36] . Along with population size and urbanity, travel time to the nearest large city is likely to be an important contributor of the
spread of coronavirus at pixel-level, since it measures proximity to large urban centers.
Locations close to city centers aﬀected by COVID-19 are more likely to be aﬀected by
a spread of the disease. Since COVID-19 was ﬁrst identiﬁed in Wuhan, we include (4)
travel time to Wuhan, China (W.access) (computed from [35] ) to account for a potential
diﬀusion from Wuhan.

We consider two environmental covariates that are likely to have a role in the spread
of COVID-19. We include (5): January land surface temperatures (LST_January) from
the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for meteorological (NOAA)
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) [37] ). Temperatures in January can aﬀect the life cycle of COVID-19 and their propensity to spread [31] , but can
also aﬀect human behaviour. The eﬀects of cold temperatures on human transmission of
COVID-19 are not clear. On the one hand, cold weather can increase the risk of transmission as people spend more time indoors, but could also reduce the risk of transmission
due to a decrease of contact resulting from a reduction human activity.
There is evidence that humidity aﬀects inﬂuenza-type virus transmission in both
experimental and observational studies [38,39] , and in population-level studies [40] . High
levels of humidity may provide a suitable framework for an outbreak of COVID-19 and
modulate the magnitude of the pandemic [32] . To account for the role of humidity, we
include: (6) potential evapotranspiration (pet), which provides a measure of the potential
amount of evaporation (if a water body is present), which is associated with the quantity
and lifetime of droplets in the air that can directly aﬀect the spread of the disease in the
air, or indirectly (e.g. reduce the protective ability of masks) [41] .
To mitigate a potential risk of multicolinearity, we applied a variance-inﬂation factor
function to identify and remove collinear covariates that show high levels of correlation
using a stepwise procedure from the R package usdm [42] . The procedure removes one
covariate from all pairs of covariates that exhibit Pearson’s ρ > 0.75). We found that
travel time to the nearest city of more than 50,000 inhabitants (access) [35] and travel
time to Wuhan (Hubei province) are highly correlated (ρ > 0.75). We kept travel time
to Wuhan since we believe that proximity with Wuhan is a major driver of the spread
of COVID-19, especially over the study period (January-February 2020), which corresponds to the early pandemic which has been ﬁrst identiﬁed in Wuhan.
In equation 1, the spatial structure ζ(i, j) is represented by a zero-mean Gaussian
Markov random ﬁeld (GMRF), while ui ∼ N(0, σ2u ) is a polygon i.i.d. random eﬀect,
which account for variation among polygons, with variance σ2u . The GMRF has a Matérn
covariance function deﬁned by two parameters: the range ρ, which represents the distance beyond which correlation becomes negligible (about 0.1), and σ is the marginal
standard deviation.
Due to the Bayesian setting of the downscaling model, priors need to be deﬁned
for all parameters (and hyperparameters) in the model. We used default priors (Normally distributed with mean and standard deviation) for the intercept β0 ∼ N(0, 2)
and covariate coeﬃcients βq ∼ N(0, 0.4). We used penalized complexity (PC) priors [43] for the polygon i.i.d eﬀects ui ∼ N(0, τu ), with standard deviation σu (precision
τu = 1/σ2u ). Here, we used the default conﬁguration that favors a base model without
polygon-speciﬁc eﬀect, with P(σu > σu,max ) = σu,prob , with σu,max and σu,prob that can

Figure 3: Potential covariates used in the downscaling model. The maps show the standardized values
of six potential covariates used in the downscaling model. The model includes travel time to Wuhan, China
(W.access), travel time to to the nearest city with more than 50,000 inhabitants (access), population size
(pop), urbanity (urban), January land surface temperatures (LST), potential evapotranspiration (pet).

For the parameters of the random ﬁeld (range and scale), we used penalized complexity (PC) priors [43] so that P(ρ < 3) = 0.01 and P(σ > 1) = 0.01. Throughout this
approach, we constrained the model to favor a random ﬁeld with a smaller magnitude
and a large range. We compare the predictive out-of-sample and in-sample performance
of diﬀerent model speciﬁcations, which include variations in the spatial parameters (see
details in SI).

We carried out an out-of-sample procedure to compare the predictive performance
(MAE, RMSE) of diﬀerent model speciﬁcities by varying several components (see details in SI). The investigated models include: (1) all covariates; (2) only anthropogenic
covariates; (3) only environmental covariates. In addition, we built four alternative models (4-7) that include all covariates but use alternative penalized complexity (PC) priors
on the spatial parameters. The results show that the model including only anthropogenic
covariates has in general the highest predictive performance. This is expected, since the
spread of COVID-19 is likely to be mainly driven by anthropogenic factors [33] .

As expected, travel time to Wuhan (95% CI: -0.63 ; -0.22) is negatively associated
with COVID-19 incidence rate: the expected COVID-19 incidence rate increases with
proximity to Wuhan, where the virus was ﬁrst identiﬁed. We also observed a positive
eﬀect of population size (pop) on COVID-19 incidence rate (95% CI: 0.08 ; 0.88), which
suggests that areas with larger population size tends to be more prone to COVID-19
infections.
There is evidence of an eﬀect from the i.i.d. province-speciﬁc random eﬀects (log(τ)
(95% CI: -0.82 ; -0.21), which is expected especially in the early stages of the epidemic,
where Hubei province had a much higher number of reported cases compared to the
other provinces, whose connection with Wuhan are highly variable can can therefore
lead to important risk variability among provinces. A large range of plausible values associated with urbanity are positive, however, the 95% credible intervals of the estimated
corresponding coeﬃcient also include a range of negative values (95% CI: -0.18 ; 0.57).
Therefore our results are inconclusive with regard to the role of urbanity on COVID-19

A sampling process (n=2,000) from the posterior distribution allows us to estimate
the expected incidence rate of COVID-19 for January-February 2020 at 5 km grid-cell
across China. In addition, we compute the higher and lower bound of the 95% credible
intervals estimates of the incidence rate, which provide a measure of uncertainty of the
predictions. To compare the results of the downscaling model with the spatially disaggregated datasets (Xu et al. and the Paper), we convert the predicted rates (mean) and
their uncertainty (lower bound, and higher bound estimations) into predicted cases by
multiplying them with population size for each grid-cell in China.
Fig 5 shows the (natural log) COVID-19 infected cases for January and February
2020 from the original JHU dataset at province-level in China (top-left). In addition,
it shows an estimation of the (natural log) infected cases based on the downscaling
approach with lower bound of the 95% CI (top-right), mean (bottom-left), and higher
bound of the 95% CI (bottom-right) predictions at 5 km grid-cell.

3.3. Comparing model predictions with disaggregated datasets at district-level
Since the reported cases from the disaggregated datasets are reported at city-level,
they are likely to include cases that occur in the neighbourhood of the reported locations.
To ease their comparison with the predicted cases from the downscaling approach, we
compare the data at district level, which include 340 districts corresponding to one administrative level below province in China (Taiwan districts are merged into one single
entity).
Fig 6 shows the number of (natural log) COVID-19 infected cases for January and
February 2020 at district-level (340 districts) in China from the Paper (left), Xu et al.
(center), along with an estimation of the (natural log) mean infected cases based on the
downscaling approach (right). Figs 7 and 8 show the number of (natural log) COVID-19
infected cases for January and February 2020 at district-level (340 districts) in China
from the Paper (blue triangles), Xu et al. (red points), along with an estimation of
the (natural log) mean (white squares), 95% credible intervals (grey segments) of the
infected cases based on the downscaling approach. For each district, the color of the
symbol is faded for the corresponding dataset (Xu et al. or The Paper) that exhibits the
most distant values (in absolute terms) to the predicted (natural log) mean cases from
the downscaling approach.
Figs 7 and 8 show that in most districts, the values of the (natural log) reported cases
from Xu et al. and the Paper lie within the 95% credible intervals of the predicted (natural log) cases based on the downscaling approach. This suggest that there is relative
consistency between the investigated spatially disaggregated datasets (when data is provided) and the predictions from the downscaling model at district-level. We observe that
the counts from Xu et al. tend to be closer to the predictive values from the downscaling approach. To further analyze potential discrepancies, we compute the absolute error
(MAE) and the root mean squared error (RMSE) between the observed counts and the
predictions based on several downscaling model speciﬁcations at district-level.

The Bayesian downscaling model suggested in this paper made possible an assessment of discrepancies in the COVID-19 counts between databases aggregated at diﬀerent
spatial scales. By investigating reported cases from January to February 2020, the suggested approach allowed us to quantify diﬀerences in COVID-19 counts between two
near real-time spatially disaggregated datasets and a reference province-level dataset at
district-level in China. This data comparison would not be feasible with traditional statistical models. Furthermore, our analysis beneﬁted from the Bayesian structure of the
model, which provided a coherent framework to estimate and visualize uncertainty in
the predictions across a ﬁne spatial grid that covers our study area.
The method proposed in this paper exhibits several shortcomings. Our initial exploratory analysis remains descriptive and do not capture the processes behind the generated data. As such, it has only allowed us to identify potential data mismatches. However, the exploratory phase led us to investigate the observed data discrepancies in further detail. The second step of our analysis consisted of a comparison between reported
coronavirus-infected cases and their locations gathered from two spatially disaggregated
datasets (Xu et al. and The Paper [16,45] ) and predictions from a downscaling approach
using JHU data as reference province-level database [15] . Without reference data at a
ﬁner scale (city-level), we were not able to rigorously validate the results of the grid-cell
predictions, and hence, identify data discrepancies with high conﬁdence. Furthermore,
our model did not distinguish age and gender classes of the population at risk. A potential reﬁnement of the model informed by population structure could be used to better
estimate the population at risk.

Assuming a well-speciﬁed model, the downscaling model is likely to have provided
an accurate representation of the uncertainty [23] , which has allowed us to quantify deviations of the counts from the disaggregated databases with regard to the estimated
mean and 95% credible intervals of the predicted counts from the downscaling model.
To prevent the risk of overﬁtting, we built a relatively parsimonious model by selecting
a few theoretically-relevant covariates and constraining them to be linearly associated
with COVID-19 counts to keep the model as simple as possible.
Since in-sample predictions may not provide accurate predictive metrics in the presence of overﬁtting [46] , we selected the model based on the results of an out-of-sample
iterative procedure that made predictions at grid-cell within each hold-out province from
diﬀerent model speciﬁcations. This procedure ensures that the resulting predictive metrics are based exclusively on data that has not been used in the ﬁtting procedure. The
model with the best predictive performance includes exclusively anthropegeic covariates, which brings evidence of the dominant role of human factors in the spread of
COVID-19 [33] .
A recent study that investigates the predictive performance of downscaling models
exploring diﬀerent contexts (various point data, aggregated areas sizes, and types of
model misspeciﬁcations) suggests that predictive performance is likely to improve with a
high number of data points and small polygon areas. If these conditions are not satisﬁed,
predictions should remain accurate enough if the model is well-speciﬁed [23] . With a
total of 33 polygons used to ﬁt a relatively parsimonious model, we are conﬁdent that
the predicted mean and uncertainty (95% credible intervals) should be accurate enough
to provide reliable estimates of COVID-19 counts at district-level.
Despite the measures implemented to mitigate the eﬀects of several major validity
threats, our results remain dependent on the accuracy and reliability of the JHU reference
data at province-level. Even at national and province-level, estimating the true number
of positive cases of COVID-19 remains challenging. The number of individuals with a
positive test result for the virus are inevitably smaller than the actual number of cases
since a large proportion of infected people will not experience symptoms and may not
get tested for the virus. Furthermore, the quality and eﬃciency of tests are subject to
errors, which may lead to important discrepancies between reported and true counts [34] .

The analysis of spatially disaggregated COVID-19 data in January and February
2020 in China highlights important discrepancies in the counts of COVID-19 cases at
a ﬁne spatial scale. The results of an initial exploratory analysis led us to compare
the observed diﬀerences in COVID-19 cases in China gathered from two spatially disaggregated datasets, Xu et al. [16] and The Paper [45] , with ﬁne-scale predictions using
a Bayesian downscaling approach applied to a province-level data provided by Johns
Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU) [15] . At district16

level, COVID-19 counts from the spatially disaggregated datasets tend to be consistent
with the range of plausible values of the predictions obtained by the downscaling model.
We showed that, in comparison with The Paper [45] , Xu et al. data [16] has a larger data
coverage and the number of reported COVID-19 cases tend to exhibit a higher degree of
consistency with the expected values of the predictions obtained from the downscaling
model
The discrepancies in the counts of COVID-19 observed at province and district levels in China could also occur in other spatial and temporal frameworks. We believe
that the data discrepancies highlighted in this case study are substantial enough to be
considered by the providers of disaggregated data and the research community. As the
COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten various regions around the world, accuracy
and reliability of the disaggregated COVID-19 data are crucial for governments and local communities to ensure rigorous assessment of the extent and magnitude of the threat
posed by the virus and draw relevant conclusions. We hope that our analysis can help
the data providers to identify at ﬁne spatial scales potential data collection issues and
remedy to them.
Governmental measures to mitigate the spread of the virus, such as quarantine, social
distancing, and community containment are costly [47] . The eﬃciency of measures can
be improved through evidence-based analysis grounded on reliable and accurate data.
Given the observed data discrepancies at various spatial scales, we recommend that the
providers of disaggregated COVID-19 data join eﬀorts with the World Health Organization, as well as national and regional governments to build and maintain a comprehensive
and reliable disaggregated database on COVID-19, which would help the research community and policy makers in their combat against the global threat posed by the virus.

Data on coronavirus-infected cases are provided by various sources, including individuallevel data from national, provincial, and municipal health reports, as well as additional
information from online reports. A reference source of province-level data is provided
by John Hopkins University CSSE (JHU) [15] through an interactive web platform, whose
data can be downloaded using github [7] . For cases in China, the sources used include
Twitter feeds, online news services. The reported cases are conﬁrmed with regional and
local health departments, including centers for disease control and prevention of China,
Taiwan, and Europe, the Hong Kong Department of Health, the Macau Government,
and the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as city-level and state-level health
authorities.
For the disaggregated datasets, we extracted city-level observations from the GitHub
platform of the news agency Pengpai, which we refer to as “The Paper” [6,45] (09 April
2020). We added city names in English, spatial coordinates of the cities (centroid),
and dates in English. Furthermore, we removed events without or with wrong spatial
coordinates. The cleaned dataset counts observations from 11 January 2020 to end of
February 2020.
In addition to The Paper dataset, we extracted data from healthmap.org’s GitHub (09
April 2020), which includes COVID-19 cases in China in Hubei province [8] and outside
Hubei province [9] ). We refer to this second dataset as Xu et al. data. The entire dataset
(events without dates are removed) contains observations from January 18 to end of
February 2020. The authors have provided the geolocalization of the data using google
map and a variable that indicates the level of spatial accuracy, which can be used to
subset the data. Xu et al. data has been aggregated through oﬃcial government sources,
peer-reviewed papers, and online reports. Various procedures have been applied by the
authors to increase accuracy and comprehensiveness of the data. Therefore, we did not
clean the original dataset since the provider used various robust procedures to ensure that
the data is accurate and comprehensible, which include checking records and potential
duplicates with peer-reviewed research articles.

2. Model validation
Out-of-sample predictions
Good in-sample performance may be the results of overﬁtting and are therefore not
necessarily informative about the true performance of models. In order to assess the
external validity of our model and to obtain more realistic estimations of performance
metrics, we performed an out-of-sample cross-validation procedure by taking into account the spatial nature of the data and the model speciﬁcations [49–51] . While methods to evaluate out-of-sample performance of downscaling approaches have been developed (e.g. [20,52] ), their relevance has been essentially drawn from the results of studies
based on simulated data, which may not necessarily apply to our case study. Also, since
province-level is the ﬁner spatial resolution of our reference data (JHU data [15] ), a crossvalidation approach based on spatial blocks [53] would not be feasible.
As a result, we ﬁt the downscaling models using data in all provinces except one
(hold-out province), predicted the expected cases in the hold-out province, and reported
performance metrics (RMSE, MAE) based on the expected cases from JHU. Through an
iterative process, the data from the hold-out province is not used during the ﬁtting process to ensure that the predictive performance of the models is assessed exclusively on
new data. We performed the out-of-sample procedure on various model speﬁcications,
similarly to the insample procedure (see Table 1) except that we did not consider models
with i.i.d random polygon-speciﬁc eﬀects since we opted for a procedure that remove
data from province in an iterative way. In this case, province-speciﬁc eﬀects cannot be
used to inform the model.
The model speciﬁcations (Model spec) are the following: (1) include all covariates,
(2) include only anthropogenic covariates (Socio. cov.), (3) include only environmental
covariates (Env. cov.), (4-7) using alternative penalized complexity (PC) priors on the
spatial parameters ρ min and σ max. In total, this cross-validation computes predictive
performance metrics for a total of 33 provinces multiplied by 7, which corresponds to a
total of 231 runs. The results are illustrated in Table 2.
In Table 2, we report the MAE and RMSE (MAE all, RMSE all) for each model
speciﬁcation, based on the out-of-sample predictions in all provinces. Since the out-ofsample predictions in some provinces appear far more challenging in some provinces
(see Xingiang and Hubei in Fig 9), we also present the MAE and RMSE results with
predictions excluded in Xingjiang (MAE no Xingjiang, RMSE no Xingjiang) and Hubei
(MAE no Hubei, RMSE no Hubei) to compare the model performance in diﬀerent areas.
The results in Table 2 show that the model using only anthropogenic covariates (mod
spec.: soc) has a better out-of-sample predictive ability in general, when we include
predictions in all provinces (lowest MAE all and RMSE all) and also when we exclude
predictions in Hubei province (lowest MAE no Xingjiang and RMSE no Xingjiang). If
we exclude predictions in Xingjiang province, model sigma2 with all covariates and
alternative penalized complexity (PC) prior on the spatial parameter sigmamax = 5 shows

We compare a total of seven model speciﬁcations (without i.i.d random eﬀects): (1) include all covariates (all), (2) include only anthropogenic covariates (soc), (3) include only environmental covariates (env),
and models that include all covariates but using alternative penalized complexity (PC) priors on the spatial

the highest predictive performance. From these results, we select model soc, which has
the best predictive performance across the diﬀerent predictive contexts.
Insample predictions
Note that the out-of-sample predictions approach that remove in an iterative way
each province (hold-out province) cannot be used to assess the predictive performance of
models with province-speciﬁc i.i.d random eﬀects. However, random eﬀects can account
for important diﬀerences we observe among provinces that cannot be informed by the
covariates. Therefore, our ﬁnal selected model is based on the selected speciﬁcation
(model using only anthropogenic covariates (mod spec.: soc)), by including an i.i.d
random eﬀects to account for province-speciﬁc characteristics.
To assess the insample predictive ability of the model, we compare the predicted
incidence rate at province-level with the observed incidence rate computed as the number
of reported COVID-19 cases from JHU [15] divided by the population size [30] of the
province. For each province, the average incidence rate predicted by the downscaling
is given by the sum of the mean predicted incidence rate multiplied by population size
for each grid-cell within the province. A brief look at the results in Table 3 indicates
that in most province, the predicted incidence rate (per 1,000) is equal to the observed
incidence rate (per 1,000) when rounded at 3 digits. We can conclude that the in-sample
predictions of the model are of suﬃcient accuracy.
