Plateaus and rebounds of various epidemiological indicators are
widely reported in Covid-19 pandemics studies but have not
been explained so far. Here, we address this problem and explain the appearance of these patterns. We start with an empirical study of an original dataset obtained from highly precise measurements of SARS-Cov-2 concentration in wastewater
over nine months in several treatment plants around the Thau
lagoon in France. Among various features, we observe that the
concentration displays plateaus at different dates in various locations but at the same level. In order to understand these facts,
we introduce a new mathematical model that takes into account
the heterogeneity and the natural variability of individual behaviours. Our model shows that the distribution of risky behaviours appears as the key ingredient for understanding the
observed temporal patterns of the epidemics.

Introduction

The onset of plateaus for various indicators1 of the current
outbreak of Covid-19 appears to be a rather general feature
of its dynamics, along with periods of exponential growth
or decay, rebounds etc. Nonetheless, there are few theoretical explanations offered to understand this phenomenon and
such plateaus hardly agree with the classical SIR paradigm
of epidemics.
We show here that plateaus emerge intrinsically in the unfolding of an epidemic. That is, plateaus arise naturally if we
take into account two elements: an underlying heterogeneity and a random variability of behaviours in the population.
These features are of course more realistic than assuming that
the population is perfectly homogeneous with an unwavering
behaviour.
To shed light on this mechanism, we propose in this paper a
new mathematical model. It takes the form of a system of
reaction-diffusion equations, where one variable represents
the behaviour of individuals (see Methods section). It is natural to consider that individuals may change their behaviour
from one day to the next one. We assume here that individuals’ behaviours move randomly according to Brownian
motion among these classes. We show here that such a system that includes heterogeneity and variability of behaviours

as incidence rate, hospitalisations...

Up to now, there are two main alternative explanations for the
onset of plateaus. The first one is political (1). By managing the epidemic and keeping the exponential growth at bay,
without destroying the economy, a plateau appears as some
kind of optimal compromise under constraint. Another approach appears in a very recent work of Weitz et al. (2). It argues that plateaus are caused by change of behaviours due to
awareness of fatalities and fatigue of the public facing regulatory mobility restrictions. In recent works, Arthur et al. (3)
and Radicchi et al. (4) proposed models in the same spirit.
We refer to Section 6 and SI Appendix for other references
and a more detailed discussion of related literature.
We introduce and discuss the model in Section 3. To discuss
the validity of our approach, we rely on observations stemming from a series of measurements, carried weekly over an
extended period in the Thau lagoon area in South of France.
These strikingly reveal the formation of plateaus, in some
cases after a "shoulder" pattern. We describe the outcomes
of these measurements in Section 2.
In Section 4, we report on the calibration of our model on
the data of the Thau lagoon. It yields a remarkable fit. We
further discuss our model in more detail in the light of the
measurements in Section 5 below. In the SI, we also show
that this model also generates rebounds.

The Thau lagoon data

The measurement campaign concerned four wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in the Thau lagoon area in France,
serving the cities of Sète, Pradel-Marseillan, Frontignan and
Mèze. The measurements were obtained by using digital
PCR (5) (dPCR) to estimate the concentration of SARS-Cov2 virus in samples taken weekly from 2020-05-12 to 202101-12. We provide further details about the measurement
method in the Methods section.

May 12th 2020 to January 12th , 2021. The four WWTP serve the cities of Sète

Observations of the covid-19 outbreak unfolding in the
Thau lagoon. Figure 1 shows the outcomes in a logarithmic

scale over a nine months period. We summarise now their
main features.
1. An exponential phase starts simultaneously in Mèze
and Frontignan WWTPs in early June.
2. The genome units concentration curves in these two
places reach, again simultaneously, a plateau. It has
stayed essentially stable or slightly decreasing since
then.
3. The evolution at Sète and Pradel-Marseillan remarkably followed the previous two zones in a parallel way,
with a two weeks lag. The measurements at Sète and
Pradel-Marseillan continued to grow linearly (recall
that this is in log scale, thus exponentially in linear
scale), while the Mèze and Frontignan figures have stabilised ; then, after two weeks, they too stabilised at a
plateau with roughly the same value as for the other
two towns.

the susceptible population. Thus, we represent the heterogeneity of individual behaviours with this variable. We take
a as an implicit parameter that we do not seek to calculate. The classical SIR model is macroscopic and the type
of model we discuss here can be viewed as intermediate between macroscopic and microscopic.
The initial distribution of susceptible individuals S0 (a) in the
framework of a SIR-type compartmental description of the
epidemic can be reasonably taken as a decreasing function of
a. We take the infection transmission rate a 7→ β(a) to be
an increasing function of a. In the SI Appendix, the reader
will find a more general version of this model involving a
probability kernel of transition from one state to another. The
model here can be derived as a limiting case of that more
general version.
Likewise, the behaviour of individuals usually changes from
one day to another (6). Many factors are at work in this variability: social imitation, public health campaigns, opportunities, outings, the normal variations of activity (e.g. work from
home certain days and use of public transportation and work
in office on others) etc. Therefore, the second key feature of
our model is variability of such behaviours: variations of the
population density for a given a do not only come from individuals becoming infected and leaving that compartment but
also results from individuals moving from one stratus a to another (6). In the simplest version of the model, variability is
introduced as a diffusion term in the dynamics of susceptible
individuals.
The model.. We denote by S(t, a) the density of individuals

at time t associated with risk parameter a, by I(t) the total
number of infected, and by R(t) the number of removed individuals. We are then led to the following system:

An epidemiology model with heterogeneity and natural variability of population
behaviour

The appearance of such plateaus and shoulders need not be
explained neither by psychological reactions nor by public
health policy effects. Indeed, the regulations were roughly
constant during the measurement campaign and awareness
or fatigue effects do not seem to have altered the dynamics
over this long period of time. Witness to this is the fact that
two groups of towns saw the same evolution, but two weeks
apart one from the other. To understand this phenomena we
propose a new model.
Given the complexity and multiplicity of behavioural factors
favouring the spread of the epidemic, we assume that the
transmission rate involves a normalised variable a ∈ (0, 1)
that defines an aggregated indicator of risky behaviour within

WWTPs, the effective proportionality coefficient λ minimising the least square distance between measured concentrations and λ multiplied by the rate of infected individuals is
computed in the calibration process over the time interval
from 9 June 2020 to 12 January 2021.
Calibration of model (1) also requires fitting the values of γ,
the profiles a 7→ β(a) and the initial distribution of susceptible individuals in terms of a. Satisfactory capture of the
exponential phase and the subsequent plateau leads to coefficient λ = 111, 230, 001 (in genome unit per litre).

genome units and black curve represents the total infected individuals as an output of the model discretized into ng = 20 groups in a. Initial distribution of susceptible individuals and β function are taken as described in supplementary information. Parameters d and γ are taken as follows: d = 2.5 · 10−4 day −1 , and
γ = 0.1 day −1 .

The underlying dynamics of the rate of susceptible individuals is given in Figure 3 below for ng = 20 groups. The lower

by the highest β transmission coefficient, are rapidly transferred to the infected compartment. Variability of behaviours
modelled by diffusion with respect to a parameter then refeeds the fringe of riskiest susceptible individuals. Parameter
regimes where those two phenomena have the same order of
magnitude generate patterns such as plateaus, shoulders and
rebounds. Figures S13, S14, S15 in the SI Appendix illustrate
these various dynamics.
In Figures S13 and S14 in the SI Appendix, we explore the
types of patterns arising when we vary the diffusion coefficient d. We note that plateaus occur for an intermediate range
of values of d > 0, which represents the amplitude of variability. Namely, large values of d lead to standard SIR-type dynamics, since diffusion quickly homogenises the behaviours.
When d decreases, plateaus starting with shoulder-like patterns appear. However, for even smaller values of d, oscillations arise, which can be interpreted as epidemic rebounds.
From numerical experiments, the amplitude of rebounds always seem to be of smaller amplitude than the first epidemic
peak. However, higher secondary peaks arise when we significantly modulate in time the transmission rate. This may
represent a progressive exit from lockdown or the effect of
new and more contagious variants (see Figure S15).
The dynamics of the Covid-19 outbreak in the cities of Thau
lagoon appears almost insensitive to public health regulations. In particular the second lockdown in France from 28
October to 14 December 2020 had hardly any effect. Likewise, the Christmas Holiday season also seemed to have had
little influence on the observed plateaus.
The number of hospitalised individuals in France over the
last quarter of 2020 is represented in Figure 4. There, the
dynamics shows a growing phase followed by a shoulder and
a plateau, very similar to the pattern observed in Thau lagoon.

Discussion

We claim that Model (1) explains the formation of plateaus
and rebounds in the dynamics of the outbreak through the
heterogeneity and variability of population behaviour with
respect to epidemiological risk. Figure 3 shows that susceptible individuals with the riskiest behaviour, characterised

Several noteworthy observations came out from the Thau lagoon data. First, we can see two distinct exponential growths
in two separate subsets of two towns. The two graphs are
parallel with a constant delay of two weeks. The first group
reaches a plateau at a certain level of infected and stays thereafter essentially flat, while the second group continues to
grow until it reaches about the same value of infected and
then becomes essentially flat too. These remarkable observa-

tions call for interpretations. Indeed, first, they cannot simply result from public policy measures as these would have
affected all these neighbouring towns in a similar fashion.
Second, there likely is a spatial diffusion effect that triggered
the growth in the second group coming from the first one.
However, this diffusion would not explain the fact that the
two groups reached the same level of plateaus.
It is worth noting that these observations are inconsistent with
the classical SIR model: in this model, once an epidemic
reaches a peak, it then decreases steadily by another exponential factor. In other words, a plateau requires an effective
Rt number (7, 8) of approximately one: Rt ∼ 1. However
this would be hard to sustain over such a long period of time
as observed because the susceptible population is depleted. It
also appears difficult to explain that this occurs exactly at the
same plateau level for two distinct populations.

Conclusions

In this paper we reported on precise concentration measurements of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater upstream of four
WWTPs around the Thau lagoon in South of France during the nine months period from May 2020 to January 2021.
These observations exhibit plateaus and shoulder patterns.
We provide here an explanation by considering that individuals differ by the level of risk in their behaviour, which
changes randomly from day to day. Indeed, we show here
that the combination of heterogeneity and variability leads
to a constant replenishment of the population of susceptible
individuals with higher risks, thus feeding as it were the epidemic. This mechanism explains the formation of plateaus in
the dynamics of the epidemic.
To substantiate this claim, we proposed a mathematical
model for epidemics that explicitly involves heterogeneity
and variability. The model takes the form of an SIR system
with diffusion of behaviours. To get a model as parsimonious
as possible (9), we only assumed the diffusion of risks among
susceptible and that a single continuous and one-dimensional
risk variable a represents the behaviour type. Numerical
simulations of this system indeed show exactly this type of
shape that we observed with shoulders, long plateaus, and rebounds. We were able to calibrate this model on the Thau
lagoon observations and obtain a curve that fits the data.
Perspectives and extensions of the model. Besides the

mathematical extensions we discuss in SI, there are many directions for extending this model. First, one might envision a
more precise approach to the parameter a beyond the notion
of unit of contact. One can take into account e.g., duration
and circumstances of contacts. It appears natural to use “risky
sociability” in computing the transmission rate. Understanding quantitatively the change of behaviour as a function of
this variable a appears to be an interdisciplinary avenue of
research.
Likewise, it is quite natural to assume that the variability of
behaviour also depends on a rather than being uniformly distributed. We discuss such an extension in the SI where we
4

show that it leads to an equation with drift terms. We leave
developments in this direction to further work.
Another important aspect that transpires in the Thau lagoon
data, is the spatial spreading that takes place in the epidemic.
In a recent paper, the first author of this study and collaborators (10) have proposed a model at the country level with
a quantitative approach to spatial diffusion in France. The
study of diffusion at a smaller scale that we might call mesoscopic and its inclusion in the framework we propose here are
promising perspectives.

Methods
An epidemiological model with heterogeneity and variability. The model we develop here extends the classical SIR

compartmental approach (compare with Equation (7) in SI
Appendix) by taking into account heterogeneity and variability of behaviours on the susceptible population. The total
population is assumed to be constant equal to N . That is, we
do not take into account incoming or outgoing populations,
nor demographic changes. This is a standard assumption in
the Covid-19 studies. Actually, one might want to dispense
with it if one is to consider a significant amount of travellers,
especially during vacation periods or because there is a lockdown that brings many people to leave large cities.
At time t, the population of susceptible is structured by a
and t and is described by its density S(t, a). We assume that
the total number of infected is given by I(t) and that of the
removed by R(t). We do not distinguish from which population strata the infected individuals come from (see SI for
extensions).
One can think of a as a trait parameter roughly describing the
level of risk a given susceptible individual is taking with respect to Covid-19. It is normalised so that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1, a = 0
being associated with very cautious people and a = 1 to people with very risky behaviour. This implicit variable represents for instance the number of social contacts per day of an
individual, taking into account their length, whether social
distancing is observed, if it takes place indoor or outdoor, in
a more or less crowded environment, or if individuals wear
a mask etc. Thus, it can be seen as a lumped variable that
represents a global risk score. In this context, the impact of
political restrictions can easily be represented by a modification of the distribution law of the behaviours.
We observe that in this model, we adopt the point of view that
the behaviour distribution affects the risk takers in the susceptible population rather than the behaviour of infected individuals. Indeed, it appears more natural to consider that the susceptible face an ambient distribution I(t). For instance, the
choice to go to a crowded bar where there might be a superspreader, is reflected in variable a. Nonetheless, we can also
write a similar model where the risky behaviour structures
the infected population (see SI).
Individuals often vary their behaviour, because for instance of
fatigue effects for people who have heeded too strongly social distancing calls or, on the contrary, for people who have
been reckless and see other people fall sick and consequently

become somewhat more cautious. Thus, the potential reservoir of individuals for a given stratus level a is not static and
it is more important than would appear at first glance.
Hence, we consider that the variations of S(t, a) do not only
come from individuals becoming infected and leaving that
compartment but also results from individuals moving from
one stratus to another. Here we assume that this shuffling
of behaviours follows Brownian motion. We are then led to
System (1) presented in Section 3 above. At the end-points of
the interval (0, 1) for a, we impose homogeneous Neumann
(zero flux assumption) boundary conditions:
∂S(t, 0) ∂S(t, 1)
=
= 0.

Note that in this system the total population N is conserved
by the dynamics:
Z
N (t) :=

1

S(t, a) da + I(t) + R(t) = N (0).
0

In the SI, we derive this model from more basic considerations. We also describe some mathematical properties of this
system. There, we further discuss more general systems. In
particular we consider the framework where the variability
itself depends on the trait a.
It is enlightening to keep track of the fraction of infected
coming from specific strata. To this end, we can introduce a
variable I(t, a) representing the number of infected that came
from stratus a. It is given by the solution of the equation:

 ∂I(t, a) = β(a)S(t, a) I(t) − γI(t, a),
(4)
∂t
N

I(0, a) = I0 (a),
It is straightforward that this is consistent with the definition
of the total population of infected, that is:
1

Z
I(t) =

I(t, a) da.
0

We may include then here the effect that individuals with
high a’s are more likely to infect other susceptible. This just
amounts to replace I(t) by
Z
J(t) :=

χ(a)I(t, a) da

in (1)-(4), with χ being an increasing (and possibly pointed)
function.
Nevertheless, we do not include this extension here in order
not to increase too much the number of parameters. The parsimonious character is indeed an important feature of a useful
model (9).
Related literature. Numerous papers (11–14) describe the

number of daily social contacts as a key variable in the spread
of infectious diseases like Covid-19 insofar as it is closely related to the transmission rate. Daily social contacts are usually described in terms of age, gender, income, type of job,

household size (15)... Parameters that are particularly relevant in the context of viral outbreaks are also studied (16)
such as cumulative duration of such contacts, social distance,
indoor/outdoor environment... The very fine grain microscopic models (17) aim at identifying such parameters in
the most precise way possible. A very recent study by Di
Domenico et al. (18) takes up the data of hospitalisations in
France for the past six months. Again, these exhibit striking
epidemic plateaus since the beginning of 2021. The authors
of this paper provide a microscopic insight of the propagation, emphasising the role of two different strains of the virus
and the role of public health measures such as the curfew,
school closing etc. These approaches are different from ours,
as the point of view we adopt here can be seen as “mesoscopic”.
Several earlier works have considered SIR type systems with
heterogeneity. In particular, Arino et al. (19), and, more recently, Dolbeault and Turinici (20, 21), Magal et al. (22) have
studied models with a finite number of different coefficients
β. These systems are characterised by a discrete set of classes
and do not involve variability. Almeida et al. (23) considered
the case of continuous classes associated with a multidimensional trait x to study the influence of variability of infectious
individuals on the final size of an epidemic.
Weitz et al. (2) recently developed an SEIR-type compartmental model with variable transmission rate coefficient, in
which two main competing psychological reactions to the
epidemic generate plateaus. Namely, it involves awareness
of fatalities and fatigue of the public facing mobility restrictions. In this interesting model, fatigue modulates the transmission rate β in the SEIR system by the number of cumulative deaths (and in another version the daily number of
deaths). Note that this value itself is an outcome of the model
and thus this model is a kind of fixed point formulation. The
authors show that their model yields plateaus, “shoulder” like
patterns and oscillations for the dynamics of infectious individuals.
This paper of Weitz et al. is quite different from our model in
that it assumes a homogeneous population: at a given time,
all individuals have the same transmission rate. The common
behaviour simply changes in time by reacting to the outcome
of the epidemic and this change reflects in the evolution of
the transmission rate. Moreover, we note that the model is
calibrated with reported death of various U.S. states and does
not involve wastewater concentration measurements. Thus,
even though in a different manner from ours, this work also
stresses the role of variability for the observed dynamics.
DiMarco et al. (24) have recently proposed a model close
in spirit to ours but more complex. Based on kinetic theory, it describes the heterogeneity of individuals in terms of
a variable x ≥ 0 corresponding to the number of daily social
contacts. Their model consists of a system of three SIR equations coupled with Boltzmann or Fokker-Planck type equations. The authors emphasise a collision type term in the resulting Boltzmann equations. This term represents changes
of behaviours (that is of the values of x) when two individuals meet. Consequently, it ends up as quite different from

the present work. As a closure of their model, DiMarco et
al. (24) formally derive a so called S-SIR model. There, the
variability of behaviours involves an explicit dependence of
the transmission rates upon the current number of infectious
individuals (25). Because of this feature, as a matter of fact,
when applied to real data, it is eventually very similar to the
approach in Weitz et al. (2)
SARS-Cov-2 concentration measurement from
wastewater with digital PCR. The teams of the local

authorities of the Thau lagoon, Syndicat Mixte du Bassin de
Thau (or SMBT) collected samples every Tuesday from each
of the four WWTPs. Each sample consisted of a compound
of 24 hourly samples.
I.A.G.E.2 developed a diagnostic method to detect very low
concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 in such wastewater samples.
This method combines an optimised extraction process with a
DNA quantification based on a digital PCR (dPCR) targeting
region of the RdRp (IP2/IP4) (5)3 . The measures produced
identical results within three significant digits between the
two targets.
In contrast to classical quantitative real-time PCR (qRTPCR), dPCR allows the absolute quantification of low
concentration levels of target sequences of nucleic acid
molecules from DNA or RNA samples. dPCR outperforms
qRT-PCR with respect to accuracy (26) and repeatability of
measurements; it is also has a much lower detection threshold
(about 20 times lower) (5).
Among recently achieved wastewater measurement campaigns in sewers (27–34), it seems that none of them exploit
these measurements in a dynamical model. This is probably
due to the uncertainties associated with qRT-PCR measurements and to the difficulty to translate genome unit concentrations into numbers of infected individuals. As outlined in
Ahmed et al. (27), the rate of infected individuals within the
population served by the instrumented WWTP may be related
to the measured genome unit concentration through

Still, the individual variability of each parameter of Equation (6) is very high, as pointed out in several works (27,
35, 36) (see also references therein). Moreover, transport of
wastewater from the emission point to the WWTP involves
additional significant phenomena identified in Hart et al. (37):
virus degradation over time, usually modelled by exponential
decay law where the half life depends on temperature.

The approach developed here is different from these earlier
works and attempts to take advantage of an original modelling approach of population heterogeneity in order to estimate the effective parameter λ relating the rate of infected
people to the measured concentration of SARS-Cov-2. A satisfactory capture of the dynamics of concentrations by the
model, including the exponential growth followed by the formation of shoulder-like and plateau pattern leads to such effective parameter estimation, as described in Section 4.
Such virus concentration time series, essentially proportional
to the fraction of people infected by Covid-19, provides an
accurate quantitative method to monitor the epidemic. Furthermore, as well known (29, 32, 34), the appearance of
the virus in wastewater precedes the observations of the disease and therefore yields a remarkable early warning system,
ahead of hospital counts. Moreover, it reflects all infectious
people regardless of whether they are symptomatic or asymptomatic.

The classical SIR model with time dependent transmission rate. The classical SIR compartmental model (38) uses a

dynamics governed by mass-action laws. It assumes that individuals are homogeneously mixed and that every individual is
equally likely to interact with every other individual. It reads:

Single location growth and behavioural changes.. Changes of behaviour driven by phenomena such as awareness of fatalities
or fatigue with respect to mobility restrictions can be modelled by a time modulation of the infection rate β.

To start with, we analyse this problem on synthetic data. Namely, we consider an exact dynamics given by the SIR model with
parameter changes on two given dates. We now take part of the resulting points as given observations. The goal is to carry an
optimisation procedure where we try to identify the dates and magnitudes of these changes i.e. the different values of β that
come into play. Later on we will consider the Thau lagoon data.
Figure 5 represents a piece-wise constant modulation in time with reduction of social interactions down to 70% starting Day
t = 25 followed by an increase to 50% on Day t = 50.

The effect on such modulation leads to the interruption of the growth phase followed by a lower decrease for later times:

Fig. 6. Rate of infected individuals as a function of days

We developed a toolbox based upon PYGMO (39) particle swarm optimisation algorithms in order to solve the type of inverse
problem we encounter here. We consider a time sampled version of infection rates in the total population. We allow a given
number of transition times associated with behaviour changes, in between which the coefficient β is constant. The problem
then is to determine in an optimal way the SIR model parameters, initial conditions, the transition times and the values of the
β’s in between. Using a least square objective function, we obtained a satisfactory convergence towards the dynamics of the
initial model and associated modulation function.

A model with change of behaviour at discrete times in Thau lagoon.. We applied the preceding algorithmic approach on real
data of the four WWTP measurement campaigns of the Thau lagoon. In order to keep the model parsimonious, we used the
same time modulation function of β for all the four cities together. The transition dates and levels have to be determined.

Fig. 11. Change of behaviour in logarithmic scale in the Thau lagoon (initial day t = 0 being associated with May 12th , 2020). The red
curve represents the model output (rate of infected population) and the blue dots correspond to measurements. Zones I1 , I2 , I3 and
I4 respectively correspond to Sète, Mèze, Frontignan and Pradel-Marseillan.

The above results show that the optimal capture of the transition from exponential growth to plateau type dynamics occurs on
August 10th , 2020. The resulting piecewise constant modulation function in time is represented in Figure 12 below.

Fig. 12. Time modulation of collective behaviour in Thau lagoon as a result of the inverse problem.

Even though the plateau dynamics seems to be correctly represented in Figure 11, the main shortcoming of this is that it does
not really explain the observations of the Thau lagoon data. Indeed, the model does not explain why the four zones reach the
same infection rate level associated with the plateau regime and why there is a two weeks delay. Furthermore, it does not yield
a shoulder effect, as seen in the data.
One may use spatial diffusion to describe the delay between the zones (Frontignan, Mèze) on the one hand and (Sète, PradelMarseillan) on the other hand. But it also fails to explain why there are two parallel curves. We plan to come back to spatial
diffusion in future work.
Derivation of the Model. This section is concerned with the formal derivation of the additional diffusion term in the dynamics
of susceptible individuals. As previously emphasised, this diffusion term stems from the combination of the heterogeneity of
behaviours and their variability in time. A natural case to consider here is to assume that the shuffling of behaviours happens
according to Brownian motion. Namely, individual risk traits move according to the process
√
dat = 2σ dWt ,

where σ > 0 is the possibly a-dependent diffusion, and Wt is a Brownian motion in (0, 1) with reflection conditions at the
end-points of the interval. By the Fokker-Planck equation, in the absence of epidemic, an initial distribution of population
S(0, a) gives rise to S(t, a) = E[S(0, at )] governed by
∂ 2 [σ 2 (a) S]
∂S
=
.
∂t
∂a2

(8)

To consider the dynamics of the epidemic, we are thus led to the following more general version:

∂S(t, a)
∂ 2 [σ 2 (a) S(t, a)]

(9)

The first equation involves drift and other additional terms. The numerical and theoretical analysis of the case where σ depends
on a, and the corresponding extensions of the Fokker-Planck equation with drift terms, which seems relevant from a modelling
viewpoint, will be addressed in a forthcoming work.

In the simple case where σ 2 (a) = d where d is a constant, one ends up with the first equation of our system (see System (10)
below).
One could also envision a multi-dimensional variable a = (a1 , . . . , ap ) to encompass various behavioural characteristics that
could possibly be related to sociological observations. In this case, one would be led to a higher dimensional partial differential

We list below some elementary mathematical properties of the model. First, we note that this model contains the traditional SIR
model when the initial profile of susceptible a 7→ S0 (a) is uniform in a. Indeed, it is straightforward to see that then, S(t, a)
also does not depend on a.
The dynamics of total infectious individuals is governed by

Unlike traditional SIR model, in which the evolution of infectious t 7→ I(t) begins by an exponentially growing phase, has a
unique maximum and tends to zero for large time, Model (10) may exhibit more sophisticated behaviours such as rebounds in
I with multiple local maxima as well as plateaus. This property can be intuitively understood by analysing the evolution of the
growth factor in (12):
Z

Z

In the absence of diffusion, d = 0, this growth factor is non increasing in time. For heterogeneous profiles and non zero diffusion,
the first term of the right hand side is always negative whereas the second term may be positive if for instance a 7→ β(a) is
increasing and a 7→ S(t, a) is a decreasing function. Below we show that it is always the case under some conditions. Thus,
depending on the amplitude of the above two terms, the growth factor may have increasing and decreasing phases. It naturally
leads one to consider initial conditions characterised by the property S00 (a)β 0 (a) < 0 such as
 2
a
β(a) = β0 exp 2
for some η > 0,
(15)

S0 (a) = S1 + (S0 − S1 ) exp − 2
for some κ > 0 and 0 < S1 < S0 .

It means that individuals are sorted by increasing infection rate, according to the variable a, and that the vast majority of
individuals have low infectiousness whereas few individual close to a = 1 have extremely risky behaviour. To some extent,

social contact surveys (6, 11, 12) justify an initial distribution of susceptible individuals like (16). However, we are not aware
of a rigorous justification of the expression (15) of the sharply increasing profile in β.
Let us now show that the evolution preserves the property of being decreasing in a for the profiles of the susceptible population.
Proposition 1. If S0 is a decreasing function of a, then S(t, ·) is also decreasing in a for all time t.
To prove this property, we simply note that the derivative v(t, a) := ∂S(t, a)/∂a of S with respect to a satisfies the following

Since the right hand side of the first equation of (17) is negative and the initial condition v(0, a) ≤ 0, the parabolic maximum
principle then shows that v(t, a) ≤ 0 for all further time.
Further mathematical properties of Model (10). Let us first notice that we can describe the dynamics of susceptible indi-

viduals in (10) in terms of its probability density f (t, a) = S(t, a)/S(t) where S(t) =

where we denote ψ̄(t) = 0 ψ(t, a)f (t, a) da. This equation shows the effect of infections on the distribution of susceptible
population as a function of a. Indeed, it shows that, for instance in the absence of diffusion (d = 0), the proportion of the
population of high a goes down as a result of infection affecting it more in relative terms than the remaining of the population.
The presence of diffusion (d > 0) mitigates this effect by fueling as it were the epidemic with individuals who had initial lower
risk trait.

In other words, in the absence of behavioural variability (d = 0), the average of the transmission rate decreases under the effect
of its variance, the latter being directly linked to behavioural heterogeneity. Thus a higher heterogeneity promotes a faster decay
of the average transmission rate. This is a remarkable property of the system in absence of diffusion or with small diffusion.
In the presence of diffusion d > 0, this effect is in competition with the second term of the right hand side of (19) which may
be positive if for instance the profile a 7→ β(a) is increasing while the distribution f decreases along variable a.
Our next result concerns the effect of heterogeneity on herd immunity. We analyze it in the absence of diffusion.
Theorem 1. Let (t, a) 7→ (S(t, a), I(t), R(t)) be the solution of (11) (that is when d = 0) with initial conditions S(0, a) =
S̃0 f0 (a), I(0) = I˜0 > 0 and R(0) = 0 (for some positive constants S̃0 and I˜0 ). Then, t 7→ S(t, ·) tends as t → +∞ to a limit
profile a 7→ S∞ (a) in such a way that

where S̃∞ > 0 is the limit value as t goes to +∞ of susceptible individuals S̃(t) associated to the homogeneous SIR model (7)

with initial conditions (S̃0 , I˜0 , 0) and transmission rate β̄0 = 0 β(a)f0 (a) da.
Thus, this theorem asserts that heterogeneity lowers the herd immunity rate needed to stop an epidemic. Note that Several
works study the asymptotic states of similar models without diffusion, in a discrete class framework. We mention in particular
Magal et al. (22), Dolbeault and Turinici (20) and Almeida et al. (23).
Sketch of proof: The existence of the limit profile a 7→ S∞ (a) follows from the monotonicity of t 7→ S(t, a) for fixed a ∈ (0, 1).
Since t 7→ I(t) can be easily proved to vanish for large time, the recovered compartment R(t) also tends to a limit R∞ . Using

The property V (t) = V (0) can be deduced from (11).
Next, we consider more specifically the role of diffusion d > 0. First, we note that in the presence of diffusion, the above
entropy V d based on solutions (S d (t, a), I d (t), Rd (t)) of (10) is non-decreasing in a similar manner as in the framework of

The following result emphasizes the differences between the case with diffusion (d > 0) and the case without (d = 0).
Proposition 2. Assume d > 0 and consider solutions (S d (t, a), I d (t), Rd (t)) of (10). The following properties hold:
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

t 7→ S d (t, a) is not necessarily decreasing in time for a ∈ (0, 1) given.
R1
If R0 = 0 S0d (a)β(a) da/(N γ) > 1, then there exists t0 > 0 such that t 7→ I d (t) is increasing for t ∈ (0, t0 ).
If R0 < 1, t 7→ I d (t) is decreasing in time over a finite time interval. Still, there are situations where I d can be
increasing over some later time intervals.

We will give the proof of this result in a forthcoming work.
We now compare the combined impact of heterogeneity and variability compared with the case of homogeneous populations.
Theorem 2. For given d > 0, let (S d (t, a), I d (t), Rd (t)) be solution of (10) with initial conditions (S0d (a) = S0 (a), I d (0) =
I0 , Rd (0) = 0). The following results holds

I0 , R̄(0) = 0) and transmission rate βm = 0 β(a) da. Then, denoting S̄∞ the large time limit of t 7→ S̄(t), one has
d > S̄ .

We already know from Theorem 1 above that heterogeneity is beneficial in terms of herd immunity. From this point of view, the
effect of variability is a priori not so clear because the constant shuffling of population keeps fuelling as it were the epidemic.
However, part (ii) in the previous result shows that heterogeneity and variability still have a positive effect on herd immunity
d > S̄ ).
(that is S∞
∞
The convergence of solutions to states that do no depend on a is natural because of the role of diffusion. Indeed, the diffusion
term takes over once the I(t) term becomes small and thus the first equation describes a diffusion. But this only happens in the
long term and the relevance here is rather at intermediate times.
Sketch of proof: Assuming that the initial profile S0 and β are regular enough in the a variable, integration by parts of the S
equation of (10) multiplied by ∂t S leads to:

Some simulations with rebounds and plateaus. Some simulations show that the model adequately captures dynamical
features such as epidemiological rebounds and plateaus. The initial conditions considered here are (16) where κ = 0.44,
S0 = 90 and S1 = 119, 000 (total initial susceptible individuals are around 46, 398), initial infected people I(0) = 1, and β is
given by (15) for β0 = 0.008 and η is taken such that β(1) = 26.

Fig. 13. Model behaviour depending on diffusion parameter values: infected rate dynamics in logarithmic scale. From left to right and
then top to bottom, graphs are associated with d = 10−5 , d = 5 · 10−5 , d = 10−3 and d = 5 · 10−3 (in day −1 unit)

Diffusion of susceptible individuals seem to be the most sensitive parameter in order to obtain either traditional SIR type
behaviour or rebounds and plateau-type dynamics. Figure 13 illustrates the changes of dynamics depending on diffusion
parameter d. The associated dynamics of susceptible individuals are represented in Figure 14 when variable a ∈ (0, 1) is
discretized through a finite difference scheme with ng = 50 groups. Colored curves represent each discretized group and the
black curve the average of the groups (total susceptible individuals).

Fig. 14. Model behaviour depending on diffusion parameter values: 50 groups of susceptible individuals, in logarithmic scale. The black curve
corresponds to total susceptible individuals and the bottom light blue curve is associated with the most risky behaviour (a close to 1) and may not
be monotonically decreasing in time. From left to right and then top to bottom, graphs are associated with d = 10−5 , d = 5 · 10−5 , d = 10−3 and
d = 5 · 10−3 (in day −1 unit)

One can observe the effect of diffusion: while individuals with the riskiest behaviour are rapidly consumed, their group is
renewed through diffusion from the majority of less infectious individuals. Depending on the parameter range of the diffusion
coefficient d in (10), it leads to multiple epidemic waves, plateaus, or classical single wave SIR-like dynamics.

Because of the dissipative nature of Model (10), secondary epidemic peaks are of lower amplitude than the first one, as shown in
the top left graph in Figure 13. Another simulation derived from the same parameters as the top left graph in Figure 13 consists
in modulating in time the β coefficient as a collective homothetic behaviour change (β(a) being replaced by β(a)ϕ(t)). Such
collective change may be interpreted as reflecting an effect of fatigue with respect to mobility restrictions or a progressive exit
from a lockdown period as from Day= 1000. In the simulation below (Figure 15), ϕ(t) = 1 + 3 max(0, t − 1000)/1000, leading
to second peak of infectious of higher amplitude than the second one, followed by a plateau.

Fig. 15. Multiple epidemic rebounds: 50 groups of susceptible individuals in the case where progressive exit from lockdown occurs as from Day = 1000.
The fraction of infected individuals in the population is represented in the top left graph in logarithmic scale and in linear scale in the top right graph.
The dynamics of the ng = 50 groups of susceptible individuals is represented in the bottom graph, exhibiting for the riskiest groups (light blue curve) the
competition between diffusion and infection.

Stability of plateaus: the key role of diffusion. Let us illustrate in a heuristic manner the impact of diffusion on the

existence and stability of plateaus in the dynamics of infectious individuals in Model (10). First, the second derivative of
x = log I satisfies

In the case d = 0, we deduce from (30) that d2 x/dt2 (t) < 0 for all t ∈ R+ , so that x = log I is a strictly concave function of
time. The consequence is that only slow decrease at the beginning of the decay phase can be obtained. Plateaus or shoulder-like
patterns cannot arise in the case d = 0, nor rebounds since x(t) has a single maximum after which it keeps decreasing.
In the case d 6= 0, Equation (30) can be reformulated as

Assuming that β and S0 are respectively increasing and decreasing functions of a, we deduce from Proposition 1 that η(t) and
Ip (t) are always positive. Introducing xp (t) = log Ip (t), Equation (31) can be rewritten as
d2 x
(t) + η(t) (exp[x(t) − xp (t)] − 1) = 0.

It means that d2 x/dt2 (t) may be positive (resp. negative) depending on whether x(t) is lower (resp. greater) than xp (t). In
particular, in the neighborhood of times t such that x(t) is close to xp (t),
exp[x(t) − xp (t)] − 1 ≈ x(t) − xp (t),

so that oscillations may arise, leading to patterns such as the ones seen on Figure 13. These oscillations also explain rebounds,
or shoulders-like patterns before plateaus. Of course, this is not a proof but an indication to this effect and it warrants further
mathematical investigation.
More general systems. First, it should be noted that the coefficient β(a) can be time dependent: β = β(t, a). We can thus

incorporate public health policies changes such as social distancing, lockdowns etc. For instance, we can consider a transition
between two profiles β1 (a) and β2 (a) at a given date.
Then, we observe that System (10) is a particular case of a more general class of models. Indeed, we may want to also consider
heterogeneity in the compartment of infected. This for instance reflects the division between symptomatic and asymptomatic
individuals, or other differences. In particular, in terms of behaviour one can then include effects such as “super-spreaders”. We
then get a model where the population of infected also depends on the same parameter a, that is I = I(t, a). We assume that
the probability of interaction between a susceptible of class a and an infected of class b is given by a coefficient of transmission
β(a, b). These considerations lead us to the following general system.

We observe that our model above (10) is derived from this more general class by assuming that β(a, b) is independent of b. In
fact, the same is true for a finite number of states. This type of modelling of heterogeneity can be found in Magal et al.(22) and
Arino et al. (19) in the discrete setting (a has a finite number of values) and without diffusion (d = 0). These works do not seem
to yield shoulder, plateau and rebound-type patterns.
For simplicity we assume that the decay rate γ is uniform. Note that the second equation states that new infected individuals of
class a result from an infection of a susceptible individual of the same class. Other choices are possible, but then, in order to
be consistent, one would need to introduce new compartments such as symptomatic/asymptomatic, hospitalised etc. Likewise,
we could consider other variants of the SIR model, such as the SEIR model. It would then be natural to assume that exposed
individuals also move around. We are then led to a system of the following kind.

With a somewhat different point of view, we can assume that there is a probability kernel K(a, b) that represents the probability
distribution that an individual with trait b jumps to behaviour a. Then, the variation of S involves an integral operator rather

It is classical that one can recover System (10) as a certain limit of the more general class of systems (36) (compare e.g. the
article by the first author et al. (40)). However, here it is interesting to look at more behavioural assumptions on the kernel K.
For instance, it is natural to assume that K(a, b) is singular when b is close to a, that K(a, b) is rather large when b is close to
1, whereas it is very small when b is small. We leave the study of such kernels for future study.

Digital PCR in the framework of wastewater based epidemiology. Wastewater-based surveillance has been used over the

past two decades to assess in real time the exposure of people to chemicals (in particular pollutants, licit and illicit or misused
therapeutic or other drugs) and pathogens (bacteria or viruses) at the community level (41). It provides a global picture of
population health at the scale of an urban area connected to wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). Fully complying with the
privacy of individuals, this approach rests on an explicit, objective observation. It also has the advantage to serve as an early
warning system. Nonetheless, there are also uncertainties in the quantitative interpretation of these measurements. In particular,
dilution due to storm-water, infiltration of parasite inflow water, varying population, bio-marker degradation, varying time spent
in the flow..., all generate a variety of biases.
In spite of these uncertainties, there is a renewed interest in wastewater based epidemiology (WBE), in the context of the
Covid-19 outbreak. There are numerous initiatives over the world, in Australia (27), Japan (28), Netherlands (29), Detroit (30),
Paris (31), Spain (32) and Canada (33). The recent periodic sampling campaigns in WWTPs rely on classical quantitative
real time PCR (qRT-PCR) to estimate the concentration of SARS-Cov-2. At this stage, these programs serve as early warning
platforms based on the observation that they detect SARS-Cov-2 in sewers at least seven days ahead of individual testings (30,
32, 34).
Only a few of them also used digital PCR on sub-samples to assess the measurement uncertainties of qRT-PCR measurements.
Even if the benefit of dPCR in particular for low viral loads is mentioned (33), it is not currently used routinely for systematic
measurements, mainly for economic reasons.
Plateau-type patterns at country level. In most European countries, Covid-19 data exhibit similar plateau-type features, as

illustrated in the so called effective R coefficient computed from the daily number of deaths (10). This effective R coefficient
exhibits phases where it stabilises around 1, which corresponds to an epidemic plateau.

Campo et al. (42) study more specifically the dynamics of Covid-19 in Italy and put emphasis on plateaus and multi-wave
patterns, for which they discuss meta-stability properties.
Press articles illustrate the political leaders’ observation that the Covid-19 outbreak has reached a plateau phase: Reuters,
January 21st , 2021 (43); French government information service, December 10th , 2020 (44); A. Merkel, Westdeutsche Zeitung,
January 21st , 2021 (45); E. Macron, February 2nd , 2021, interview on TF1 TV channel (46)).
