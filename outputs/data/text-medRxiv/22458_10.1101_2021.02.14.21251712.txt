Abstract

Background:

Rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals is crucial for

taking timely measures and minimizing the risk of further SARS-CoV-2 spread. We aimed to
assess the accuracy of exhaled breath analysis by electronic nose (eNose) for the
discrimination between individuals with and without a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Methods:

This was a prospective real-world study of individuals presenting to public test

facility for SARS-CoV-2 detection by molecular amplification tests (TMA or RT-PCR). After
sampling of a combined throat/nasopharyngeal swab, breath profiles were obtained using a
cloud-connected eNose. Data-analysis involved advanced signal processing and statistics
based on independent t-tests followed by linear discriminant and ROC analysis. Data from
the training set were tested in a validation, a replication and an asymptomatic set.
Findings:

For the analysis 4510 individuals were available. In the training set (35 individuals

with; 869 without SARS-CoV-2), the eNose sensors were combined into a composite
biomarker with a ROC-AUC of 0.947 (CI:0.928-0.967). These results were confirmed in the
validation set (0.957; CI:0.942-0.971, n=904) and externally validated in the replication set
(0.937; CI:0.926-0.947, n=1948) and the asymptomatic set (0.909; CI:0.879-0.938, n=754).

Selecting a cut-off value of 0.30 in the training set resulted in a sensitivity/specificity of
100/78, >99/84, 98/82% in the validation, replication and asymptomatic set, respectively.
Interpretation:

eNose represents a quick and non-invasive method to reliably rule out SARS-

CoV-2 infection in public health test facilities and can be used as a screening test to define
who needs an additional confirmation test.

Research in context

Evidence before this study
Electronic nose technology is an emerging diagnostic tool for diagnosis and phenotyping of
a wide variety of diseases, including inflammatory respiratory diseases, lung cancer, and
infections.
As of Feb 13, 2021, our search of PubMed using keywords “COVID-19” OR “SARS-CoV-2”
AND “eNose” OR “electronic nose” OR “exhaled breath analysis” yielded 4 articles (1-4) that
have assessed test characteristics of electronic nose to diagnose COVID-19. In these small
studies the obtained signals using sensor-based technologies, two-dimensional gas
chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry, or proton transfer reaction time-offlight mass spectrometry, provided adequate discrimination between patients with and
without COVID-19.
Added value of this study
We prospectively studied the accuracy of exhaled breath analysis by electronic nose (eNose)
to diagnose or rule out a SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with and without symptoms
presenting to a public test facility. In the training set with 904 individuals, the eNose sensors
were combined into a composite biomarker with a ROC-AUC of 0.948. In three independent
validation cohorts of 3606 individuals in total, eNose was able to reliably rule out SARS-CoV2 infection in 70-75% of individuals, with a sensitivity ranging between 98-100%, and a
specificity between 78-84%. No association was found between cycle thresholds values, as
semi-quantitative measure of viral load, and eNose variables.
Implications of all the available evidence

The available findings, including those from our study, support the use of eNose technology
to distinguish between individuals with and without a SARS-CoV-2 infection with high
accuracy. Exhaled breath analysis by eNose represents a quick and non-invasive method to
reliably rule out a SARS-CoV-2 infection in public health test facilities. The results can be
made available within seconds and can therefore be used as screening instrument. The eNose
can reliably rule out a SARS-CoV-2 infection, eliminating the need for additional timeconsuming, stressful, and expensive diagnostic tests in the majority of individuals.

Introduction

The ongoing spread caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) has underlined the importance of widespread, rapid and accurate testing to contain
the pandemic. Despite initiation of vaccination campaigns, instant testing of all people with
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms is recommended and propagated
worldwide (5). Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), other molecular
amplification tests such as the transcription mediated amplification (TMA), and antigen tests
are currently used for detecting SARS-CoV-2 (6-8). However, performing these tests on a
large-scale is time-consuming and faces other limitations, such as a shortage of personnel,
equipment, reagents and other consumables (9). Delay in test results impedes timely and
adequate measures and could further worsen the economic despair and the compliance to
and psychological consequences of mandatory quarantine (10).
Expanding the testing capacity, analytic performance, throughput and speed of returning
results using new innovative technology is urgently needed and, if successful, could
contribute significantly to current efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic (11). Exhaled
breath analysis using electronic nose (eNose) technology may be considered as a diagnostic
tool during this outbreak (12, 13). Exhaled breath contains thousands of volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) derived from physiological and pathophysiological processes of local and
systemic origin (13, 14), which might include VOCs related to a SARS-CoV-2 infection (15).
eNoses can be applied for probabilistic pattern recognition using cross-reactive sensors that
capture the complete mixture of VOCs in exhaled breath (14). This emerging technology has
shown potential as a point-of-care tool for diagnosis and phenotyping of a wide variety of
diseases, including inflammatory respiratory diseases, lung cancer, and infections (16-18).

Our hypothesis was that a SARS-CoV-2 infection is reflected by a distinct breath profile and
that this profile can be identified using eNose technology. Therefore, the aim of this study
was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of exhaled breath analysis by eNose for the
discrimination between participants with and without a SARS-CoV-2 infection in a real-world
population in the public health care domain.

Methods

Study design and oversight
This was a prospective, real-world study including a training, validation, replication and
asymptomatic set. The study added exhaled breath analysis by eNose to the standard
diagnostic procedure at the public test facility. The study protocol was approved by the
Medical Ethics Committee of Leiden The Hague Delft (P20.033) and all participants provided
written informed consent. The study was performed in accordance with the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki.
Four sets of individuals
Individuals (≥18 years of age) with early symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and/or who had
been in contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 presented to two different
Amsterdam public test facilities for a SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test. These test centres were
facilitated by the Municipal Public Health Service of the Netherlands (“GGD”). Combined
throat/nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained and transported to various different molecular
biological laboratories for TMA or RT-PCR. After diagnostic swab samples were obtained,
individuals were asked by the study team to participate in one of four study sets between
July 28 and December 27, 2020. The training set was specifically designed to develop the
eNose diagnostic model for a SARS-CoV-2 infection, which subsequently was tested in the
validation set. Thereafter, a replication set was collected in a second public test facility for
external validation. Due to a change in policy in the autumn of 2020 to test more
asymptomatic individuals and the lack of sufficient numbers of asymptomatics in the training,
validation and replication set, a fourth independent set was collected. This asymptomatic set
consists of individuals that visited the test facility after being in close contact with someone

infection.

Study procedures and measurements
When presenting to the test facility, all individuals underwent a combined
throat/nasopharyngeal swab followed by the assessment of exhaled air using eNose
technology. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants, e.g. age, sex, Body
Mass Index (BMI), symptoms, and co-morbidities, were collected using an online clinical
questionnaire. Patient-reported fever was recorded and was defined as having a body
temperature >37.8 °C. Information regarding the presence and severity of cough and
dyspnea was collected using Visual Analogue Scales (VAS).
In the training and validation set, the study participants were contacted by telephone by the
study team after 30 days to obtain information regarding additional SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic
tests and survival. If study participants were lost to follow up, information about survival was
obtained from the Dutch Central Bureau for Statistics (CBS) at which mortality is registered.
Due to the limited laboratory capacity, swab samples were distributed over various different
laboratories. Each of these laboratories was certified for routine SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic
testing using validated molecular diagnostic tests based on either TMA (only for training and
validation set) or RT-PCR. This primary test result was used for the diagnostic classification. If
TMA was performed initially, available stored samples from positive participants were
retested by RT-PCR to obtain cycle thresholds (Ct). Ct values were used as semi-quantitative
measure of viral load and were used for comparison with the eNose results.
Diagnostic classification
In this study we used the following criteria for a definite SARS-CoV-2 infection: a positive
TMA or RT-PCR at baseline and/or (only in training and validation set) a positive TMA or RTPCR ≤ 7 days after inclusion.

Exhaled breath analysis
Exhaled breath analysis was performed using 1) a cloud-connected eNose (SpiroNose® Breathomix, Leiden, The Netherlands) to detect the complete mixture of VOCs in exhaled
breath, 2) a gateway to securely send the eNose sensor signals to an online server and 3) an
online analysis platform for real-time and automated analysis (17, 19). The SpiroNose consists
of 7 different cross-reactive metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) sensors. These sensors are
present in duplicate on the inside (exhaled breath measurement) and the outside (ambient
air measurement) of the SpiroNose. The combination of sensor signals generates an
individual breath profile, reflecting the collective VOC composition in exhaled breath. An indepth description of the verification of the sensor stability was previously published (17, 19).
Details of the complete measurement set up are provided in Figure S1 (see online
supplement).
All participants were instructed to drink half a glass of water before starting the
measurement. Subsequently, they performed five tidal breaths followed by a single
inspiratory capacity maneuver to total lung capacity, a five seconds breath hold and slow but
maximal exhalation towards residual volume (17, 19, 20). Cross-contamination between
subjects was prevented by a validated safety and disinfection protocol (see online
supplement).

Data-processing
Processing of raw eNose sensor signals included filtering, detrending, environmental

correction and peak detection, which was performed automatically by the standard eNose
software as published elsewhere (17, 19). For each measurement, two variables were selected
for each sensor signal (sensor 1-7) that showed discriminative power in previous studies: (i)
the highest sensor peak normalized to the most stable sensor (sensor 2) to minimize
differences between sensor arrays and (ii) the ratio between the sensor peak and the breath
hold (BH) point (17, 19).

Statistical analysis
A priori sample size estimates indicated that approximately 30 patients per group is sufficient
for building a diagnostic model (the training set) which can be validated in a new group of 30
individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection (See online supplement) (13, 15, 16). SPSS (IBM,
version 23) was used for statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were summarized as either
means with standard deviation (SD) or medians with interquartile range (IQR). Betweengroup comparisons were performed using two-sample unpaired t-tests, Mann–Whitney U
tests or chi-squared tests.
Study participants in the training and validation set were included at the same test facility. By
the creation of a new variable that selected a random sample (50:50) of cases, training and
validation set were separated. In the training set, the normalized sensor peaks and peak/BH
ratios were compared between groups using independent sample t-tests. The significance of
the t-tests was determined using 1.000 iterations of the bootstrap. The variables that
discriminated (p<0·05) between individuals with and without SARS-CoV-2 were used as input
for linear discriminant analysis in the training set to calculate a discriminant function that best
distinguished between the groups. The accuracy of this diagnostic model was defined as the
percentage of correctly classified participants. Cross-validation of the linear discriminant
analysis including the leave-one-out method was used to calculate the cross-validated value
(CVV, %), keeping the selected predictor variables fixed. Subsequently, the cross-validated
discriminant scores were used as input to construct receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
curves with a 95% confidence interval (CI).
To test validity, the discriminant function obtained from the training set was examined in the
validation, the replication and in the asymptomatic set, and used as input to construct ROC
curves with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Discriminant scores were converted into a

predicted percentage score for SARS-CoV-2 to aid interpretation. Finally, in the training set,
we selected multiple cut-off points for the predicted SARS-CoV-2 percentage score to detect
an infection with a sensitivity of approximately 100%, 97.5%, and 95%. Subsequently, the
sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predicted Value (PPV) and Negative Predicted Value (NPV) for
these cut-off points were calculated in the validation set. The discriminative ability of the ROC
curves was summarized in area under the curves (AUC). See online supplement for more
details. Additionally, the discriminant function obtained from the training set was validated in
the external replication set including individuals recruited in a second test facility and in the
asymptomatic set. Again the ROC curve with a 95% CI was constructed. For the replication set
and in the asymptomatic set, one predefined cut-off point was used to calculate eNose test
characteristics e.g. the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV.

Results

A total number of 4593 individuals participated in the study. Of these, 4510 were available for
analysis (Figure 1). In the training and validation set, 1808 individuals were included in August
2020. Of these, 68 were SARS-CoV-2 positive (prevalence 3.8%). Of the SARS-CoV-2 positives,
65 had a positive molecular diagnostic test, either TMA or RT-PCR, at inclusion and three
individuals had a positive RT-PCR test within 7 days after inclusion. All study participants
survived at 30 days follow up.
In the second test facility, 1948 individuals, of which 230 were SARS-CoV-2 positive, were
included in the replication set in November 2020 (SARS-CoV-2 prevalence 11.8%). The
asymptomatic set included 754 participants in both first and second test facility in December
2020. Fifty of them were SARS-CoV-2 positive (prevalence 6.6%) (Figure 1.).
Baseline characteristics are listed in Table 1. In the training, validation and asymptomatic set
smoking status was significantly different (p<0.05) between the SARS-CoV-2 positive and
negative group. In the validation set the SARS-CoV-2 positive group consisted in majority of
males whereas the SARS-CoV-2 negative group consisted in majority of females.

Training set
The independent t-tests showed that the normalized sensor peaks of sensor 1 (p=0.001) and
sensor 6 (p=0.001) and the peak/BH ratios sensor 3_BH (p=0.019), sensor 5_BH (p=0.001) and
sensor 6_BH (p=0.001) were significantly different between individuals with and without a
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Subsequent linear discriminant analysis yielded a cross-validated value
of 84.3%. The AUC after internal cross-validation reached 0·948 (CI:0.929-0.967) (Figure 2A).
No associations were found between eNose variables and Ct values.

Validation set
The ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 from exhaled breath using this model was confirmed in the
validation set. Breath profiles of individuals with and without a SARS-CoV-2 infection were
distinguished with a ROC-AUC of 0.957 (CI:0.942-0.971) (Figure 2B). The sensitivity, specificity,
NPV and PPV of 3 cut-off values are listed in Table 2. To exclude false negatives, we selected
a cut-off value of 0.30 for the percentage score for a SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the
training set to obtain 100% sensitivity (Figure 3A). In the validation set, this cut-off value
resulted in a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 78%, a NPV of 100% and a PPV of 15%. Based
on the eNose results, 681 out of 904 individuals (75%) showed a percentage score of SARSCoV-2 < 0.30. These 681 individuals were all tested negative for SARS-Cov-2 based on
molecular amplification test results.

Replication set
External validation of the diagnostic model was performed in an independent replication set.
Breath profiles of individuals with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection were distinguished with
a ROC-AUC of 0.937 (CI:0.926-0.947) (Figure 2C). The selected cut-off value of 0.30 for the
percentage score for a SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in a sensitivity of 99.6%, a specificity of
79.8%, a NPV of 99.9% and a PPV of 39.9% (Table 3).

Asymptomatic set
Breath profiles of asymptomatic individuals with and without a SARS-CoV-2 infection were
distinguished with a ROC-AUC of 0.909 (CI: 0.879-0.938) (Figure 2D). The selected cut-off
value of 0.30 for the percentage score for a SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in a sensitivity of
98.0%, a specificity of 78.4%, a NPV of 99.9% and a PPV of 24.7% (Table 3).

Discussion

This was a prospective real-world study that evaluated the performance of a cloud-connected
eNose to detect or rule out a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results show that exhaled breath
analysis by eNose allows discrimination between individuals with and without SARS-CoV-2
and can reliably rule out an infection in 70-75% of those who visit the public health test
facilities. These findings were confirmed in an validation set and externally validated in an
independent replication and asymptomatic set.
To our knowledge this is the first population-based, large scale study examining the capacity
of an eNose system to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. The potential ability of exhaled breath
analysis by sensor-based technologies for COVID-19 diagnosis has been demonstrated by
three pilot studies including a pre-diagnosed population (1, 2, 4). The obtained signals during
these pilots provided adequate discrimination between patients with and without COVID-19
with ROC-AUCs ranging between 0.74 and 0.94. Our study extends this work to a large realworld setting by including a population of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, which
represent the population in public health care testing programs worldwide.
Presence of VOC signatures of viral infections have been demonstrated in both in-vitro and
in-vivo studies, already before the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (21-25). VOC formation
during an infection is the result of a multi-step and highly complex interaction between virus
and host response (15). Notably, exhaled VOC signatures seem to be virus-specific (21, 22,
26). This could be partly due to the fact that various types of viruses use different receptors
for cell entry; for example, SARS-CoV-2 binds the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
receptor (27), whereas seasonal influenza viruses mainly use sialic acids receptors (22). This
leads to distinct downstream pathways within the infected cells, potentially followed by
formation of virus-specific VOCs even at early stages of the disease (7, 12). Although initial

symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection may resemble other viral respiratory infections, COVID19 is complicated by extra-pulmonary manifestations such as gastro-intestinal symptoms,
acute kidney injury, and thrombotic complications (28), which are not common in other
respiratory viral infections. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the ability to evade innate
immunity and induce cytokine hyper production (29) uncommon for seasonal respiratory
viruses. All these interactions may result in different VOC patterns distinguishing SARS-CoV-2
from other viral respiratory pathogens. This underlines the potential of eNose technology as
a diagnostic tool in future outbreaks of infectious diseases.
Smoking is described to influence the composition of exhaled VOCs and therefore, is
considered as a potentially confounding factor in exhaled breath analysis (30). In both the
training, validation and asymptomatic set of this study smoking status was significantly
different between the SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative group. When predicting eNose
variables based on smoking status, no significant regression equations were found (see
online supplement). Therefore, it is unlikely that smoking had an influence on our results.
The present findings were obtained by integrative analysis of cross-reactive sensors that are
not selective with regard to individual VOCs (14). COVID-19 specific VOC signatures in
exhaled breath have been identified with approaches other than sensor-based technologies.
Interestingly, despite the broad differences between study designs, used technologies, and
exhaled breath measurements, all seven available studies including ours demonstrate
adequate accuracies for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection (1, 2, 4, 26, 31, 32). Three recent
studies using chemical analytical technologies have found several aldehydes (e.g.
butyraldehyde, ethanal, methylpent-2-enal, nonanal), esters (ethyl butanoate), ketones (e.g.
acetone), alcohols (e.g. isopropanol, methanol) and an alkadiene (2,4-octadiene) to
differentiate between those with and without COVID-19 (4, 31, 32). Furthermore, in a small

study using a multi-capillary column coupled ion mobility spectrometry (MCC-IMS), Steppert
et al. have recently demonstrated that breath profiles of those infected with SARS-Cov-2 are
significantly different from those with Influenza A infection (26).
Among different technologies, eNoses are specifically designed to capture a complete
mixture of VOCs, which takes advantage of information all along the VOC spectrum. This
allows for composite biomarker discovery rather than measuring individual molecules that is
needed when aiming to identify the underlying molecular networks. The eNose used in the
current study is coupled to a cloud-solution, which applies machine learning algorithms to
search for patterns in the obtained sensor signals. Pattern recognition allows for probabilistic
analyses, which result in the present ROC-curves that can be used for clinical diagnostics.
Notably, depending on the investigated disease, a different cut-off value and thereby,
different sensitivity and specificity can be selected for decision making. This is where the
advantage of a percentage score for SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to a binary (yes/no)
test outcome, becomes apparent. In this study in subjects tested at a public health care
facility, a cut-off value of 0.30 selected from the training set resulted in 100% sensitivity and
78% specificity in the validation set, 99.6% sensitivity and 83.9% specificity in the replication
set and 98.0% sensitivity and 82.2% specificity in the asymptomatic set. Both in the replication
set and in the asymptomatic set, one false negative eNose result was present. Both cases had
low viral loads (CT value 42.3 and 31.7 respectively), and therefore were most likely unable to
infect others. The high sensitivity is vital to minimize the risk of further spread of the virus.
This approach further qualifies the eNose as a screening test before more specific secondary
molecular amplification or antigen tests. The results of our study demonstrate that in a
scenario where eNose is used as a screening test, swab sampling for molecular amplification
tests could be avoided with a safe margin in 70-75% of those who visit the test facilities. This

could subsequently reduce workload and burden on the laboratories substantially and
increase residual testing capacity, thereby significantly changing the SARS-CoV-2 test
procedure in public health care setting.
An important strength of our study is the unselected population-based setting in which
individuals were included during day-to-day visits to the test facility without prior diagnosis
of COVID-19, which enhances the generalizability of our results. Second, the combination of
a validation set, an independent replication set and a set with asymptomatic individuals that
confirmed the results of the training set strengthen the observed accuracies. And finally, a
cloud-connected eNose was used that is both technically and clinically validated (17-20).
Connection of multiple eNoses to a cloud solution integrated with artificial intelligence and a
large database makes it suitable for implementation at the point-of-care as the results can be
made available within seconds.
One of the limitations of the study could be that a SARS-CoV-2 infection was merely based
on the results of molecular amplification tests. This could explain some of the false positives
found by the eNose as there is concern about false negative RT-PCR results for detecting
SARS-CoV-2 (33). In our validation set, including follow-up (≤ 7 days) TMA or RT-PCR results
to our reference standard, we were able to add some initial false negatives to the positive
group, only partially mitigating the suboptimal sensitivity of the initial SARS-CoV-2 RNA
detection test. During this study in the Netherlands, very few other commonly known viruses
were circulating, besides rhinovirus. Due to the real-life setting and timing of the study, we
cannot yet provide an answer about the accuracy of the eNose for distinguishing SARS-CoV2 from other respiratory viruses. Given that these viruses harbor unique viral proteins,
different receptor preferences, and distinct interactions with hosts on a cellular level, specific
VOC patterns could possibly be identified for various viral respiratory pathogens. Finally, the

present population mostly comprised young ambulant adults that visit public test facilities
but that may not be representative of older and in-hospital populations.
In conclusion, eNose technology can distinguish between individuals with and without a
SARS-CoV-2 infection with high accuracy. Exhaled breath analysis by eNose represents a
quick and non-invasive method to reliably rule out a SARS-CoV-2 infection in public health
test facilities. Using the eNose as a screening test can reduce the number of throat and
nasopharyngeal swabs and the required SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection tests, which in turn can
reduce the burden on individuals, economy and healthcare.
