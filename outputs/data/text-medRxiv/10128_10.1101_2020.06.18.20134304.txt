Abstract:
Background
Since the emergence of the COVID-19, health officials have struggled to devise
strategies to counteract the speed of the pandemic's spread across the globe. It
became imperative to implement accurate diagnostic tests for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA on respiratory samples. In many places, however, besides the
limited availability of test reagents, laboratory personnel face the challenge of
adapting their working routines to manipulate highly infective clinical samples. Here,
we proposed the use of a virus-inactivating solution as part of a sample collection kit
to decrease the infectious potential of the collected material without affecting the
integrity of RNA samples used in diagnostic tests based on RT-qPCR.
Methods
Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples were collected from SARS-CoV2-infected patients and from laboratory personnel using a commercially available
viral transport solution (VTM) and the denaturing solution (DS) described here. RNA
extracted from all samples was tested by RT-qPCR using probes for viral and human
genes. Exposure of laboratory personnel to infective viruses was also accessed
using ELISA tests.
Findings
The use of the DS did not interfere with the detection of viral genome or the
endogenous human mRNA, since similar results were obtained from samples
collected with VTM or DS. In addition, all tests of laboratory personnel for the
presence of viral RNA and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were negative.
Interpretation
The methodology described here provides a strategy that allow high diagnostic
accuracy as well as safe manipulation of clinical samples by those involved with
diagnostic procedures.

Introduction

In December 2019, Chinese health officials reported several cases of
respiratory syndrome followed by pneumonia of unknown origin, initially in the city of
Wuhan, capital of the Hubei province. The etiological agent behind the upsurge of
the new syndrome was quickly identified as a new coronavirus, latter on named
SARS-CoV-2.1 The virus spread rapidly throughout China and in less than a month
reached other countries in Asia, eventually reaching other continents. On March 11,
2020, a global pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO).2, 3
To date, more than 6 million cases and more than 440 thousand deaths due to the
disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, named COVID-19, have been recorded worldwide,
in 188 countries and territories around the planet with thousands of new cases and
deaths been reported every day.4

While health officials and governments around the world struggle to devise
strategies to counteract the pace of the infection’s spread, efforts to implement fast
and sensitive approaches for diagnostic have emerged as key steps to control the
epidemics. Real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) testing to detect SARSCoV-2 RNA on samples collected from the largest possible fraction of the
populations became an absolute consensus.5 Widespread PCR testing has been
pointed out as one of the most important elements in the successful COVID-19
containment strategy adopted by countries that have shown positive outcomes,
including Taiwan, South Korea and Germany.6,

7, 8

Nonetheless, having test kits

available is not the only bottleneck to implement universal testing in many countries.
The capability to adapt the routines of diagnostic laboratories to cope with the
manipulation of highly infective clinical samples coming by the thousands is equally
essential, especially considering that the RT-PCR diagnostic requires highly trained
laboratory personnel.

After peaking in Asiatic and European countries, the spread of the disease
veered towards the Americas and possibly the sub-Saharan African continent.
Developing countries in these continents may be hit hard by the pandemic for a
number of reasons; and one particular troublesome aspect is the limited availability
of diagnostic laboratories that will be able to cope with the huge incoming of clinical

samples – either in terms of the total number of available laboratories, or their
capability to deal safely with potentially infective clinical specimens. Therefore, the
development of strategies to reduce the infectivity of clinical samples being sent to
diagnostic laboratories could be essential to avoid contamination of the limited
number of trained personnel and to maintain the operational capability of these
laboratories.

The high risk associated with biological samples determines that any clinical
samples are to be considered as potentially infectious and, therefore, must be
treated under strict biosafety protocols.9 In this regard, national and international
guidelines on biosafety concerning clinical laboratories must be followed in all
circumstances. In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is still limited
information regarding nosocomial infection by SARS-CoV-2 affecting health workers
involved in diagnostics or similar activities. The WHO recommends that handling of
clinical samples suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 requires a BSL-2 or
equivalent facility, whereas attempts to replicate the virus require at least BSL-3
facilities.10

Several chemical and physical methods of viral inactivation have been
proposed and evaluated for different pathogens, as a way to provide greater safety
for professionals involved in the handling of potentially infectious samples and lower
costs with laboratory infrastructure.9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Amongst the chemical methods
evaluated, the most commonly used products contain a chaotropic salt (guanidine),
which acts as a denaturant agent for macromolecules culminating in virus
inactivation.12 At the same time, guanidine is able to decrease the degradation of
RNA molecules in samples, acting as a ribonuclease inhibitor, therefore increasing
the preservation of genetic material for application in molecular diagnostic
methodologies in which RNA integrity is essential.13

Here we describe the use of a simple, virus-inactivating and denaturing
solution as part of a swab collection kit, aiming to decrease the infectious potential of
the clinical sample and, at the same time, to preserve highly frail RNA molecules
during transportation and short-term storage before testing. This low-cost, accessible

approach has made it possible to achieve high diagnostic accuracy as well as
manipulation safety for those involved with diagnostic procedures.

Methodology
2.1.

Denaturing Solution (DS)

The guanidine isothiocyanate solution used in this study is based on protocols
established by Zolfaghari et al.,17 and Chomczynski and Sacchi18. The denaturing
solution was prepared using 4M guanidine isothiocyanate, 2.5M sodium citrate and
RNAse/DNAse free water and pH adjusted to 4.0. This solution has been used for
the conditioning and transportation of clinical specimens that include oropharyngeal
and nasopharyngeal swabs. The guanidine chaotropic salt was chosen as the
denaturing agent, assuming its ability to inactivate viruses.12 In addition, guanidine is
also a ribonuclease inhibitor, which allows the conservation of genetic material for
downstream applications using molecular biology methodologies.19

Molecular diagnostic
2.2.1.

Sampling

When the SARS-CoV2 was declared pandemic, in early march 2020,
research groups from major Universities and research institutes throughout Brazil
begin to prepare themselves to offer diagnostic support, correctly foreseeing the
collapse of public and private laboratories’ capabilities shortly after the epidemics
reached the Country. At the UFMG’s Vaccine Technology Center, we were
particularly concerned about the impacts of the intense flow of infective samples in a
research laboratory that was adapted to join the testing effort with limited resources
and personnel. In order to increase personnel safety, to avoid losing collaborators
due to infections by SARS-CoV-2, and at the same time to increase preservation of
the RNA contained in clinical samples, we introduced the use of the guanidinecontaining solution as collection and transport media instead of commonly used viral
transport media (VTM). VTM is usually composed of a balanced salt buffer; sterile,
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum; and antibiotics, as suggested by the CDC.20 As
recommended in the WHO interim guidance protocol10, combined oropharyngeal and
nasopharyngeal swabs were collected, using sterile flexible-rod swabs, and placed in

a single sterile 15 mL polypropylene tube, containing 1.0 mL of the described
denaturing solution. These collection kits were prepared in our laboratory and sent to
hospitals according to their daily demand. Upon sample collection, the swabs
remained immersed in the denaturing solution for at least 30 seconds, after which
they were removed while being gently pressed against the tube wall to remove the
excess absorbed solution. Swabs were, discarded in an appropriated biological
waste disposal and were not sent to the diagnostic laboratory in order to minimize
risks of personnel contamination. Clinical specimens from the laboratory personnel
were collected multiple times and processed the same way as specimens from
patients in hospitals (see below).

2.2.2.

RNA extraction and Real-Time Polymerase Chain
Reaction (qPCR)

Extraction of the total RNA from samples was performed using the QIAamp
Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA), according to protocols provided by the
manufacturer. The real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed using
primers and probes described in two different protocols: the United States Center for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) protocol20 and the Berlin (Charité/Berlin)
protocol.21 The viral gene coding for the N protein was targeted for the detection of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the CDC protocol, and the viral gene E was used in the
Charité/Berlin protocol. Probes and primers for the human RNAse P mRNA were
used in both protocols as an endogenous reaction control. Reactions were carried
out with the Promega GoTaq® Probe 1-Step RT-qPCR Kit (Promega, France)
according to the manufacturer's recommendations, using the QuantStudio™ 5 RealTime PCR System (Thermo Fisher, USA).

2.3.

RNA Viability Test

In order to verify the viability of the RNA stored in the denaturing solution (DS)
proposed in this work, in comparison to the commonly used VTM, oropharyngeal and
nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from four laboratory’s staff members
and stored in VTM, following the protocol established by the WHO. Similarly, swab

samples from the same staff were placed in the DS. After a two hours period, RNA
extraction was performed from all samples, as described above, and the qPCR
protocol was performed to detect the RNAse P gene. To evaluate for how long the
DS could maintain viral RNA viable to be detected through qPCR, different DS tubes
were spiked with 16400 copies of SRAS-CoV2 genomic RNA and maintained for up
to 8 days at either 4oC or room temperature. After that, the viral RNA was extracted
and evaluated by qPCR. Results obtained were analyzed in the QuantStudio™
Design and Analysis software (v.1.5.1) and graphs were generated using the
GraphPad Prism software (v.8.4.2).

2.4.

Detection of Viral RNA from samples stored in the Viral
Transport Medium and the Denaturing Solution

To evaluate the preservation of the viral RNA in VTM versus DS, clinical
samples were collected from hospitalized COVID-19 suspected patients using either
DS or VTM. Sample collection was carried out according to the WHO protocol and
the molecular diagnosis was processed as described above. Obtained results were
analyzed in the QuantStudio™ Design and Analysis software (v.1.5.1) and graphs
were generated using the GraphPad Prism software (v.8.4.2).

2.5.

Assessment of laboratory personnel safety

Having established that collection of clinical samples in DS preserves viral RNA in
levels comparable to VTM, we opted to routinely receive and process only DS
collected clinical samples, as described above. In order to assess the safety of our
laboratory staff using such routine, we tested all laboratory personnel every 15 days.
qPCR tests were conducted as described above. Additionally, serum samples from
all laboratory members were also collected approximately 45 days after the
beginning of the study, to assess the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
To that end, we employed an in-house anti-IgG COVID-19 enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay. Briefly, the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 was
expressed in transformed E. coli, purified, and used to coat 96 well ELISA plates.
Tested sera were diluted in PBS-Tween20 solution, added to wells and incubated for

1 hour at 37°C. After washing, each well were added with horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated anti-human IgG goat immunoglobulin (Fapon, China). After further
washing and incubation, reactions were revealed using tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)
and readings were obtained in a Microplate Reader at an optical density (O.D.) of
450 nm. The in-house indirect ELISA was validated using a panel of SARS-CoV-2positive sera previously tested by commercial anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG lateral flow
immunochromatography (various commercial brands).

Results

RNA Viability Tests

Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal samples from four different laboratory members
were collected in VTM or DS and processed. Viability of the extracted RNA was
analyzed by qPCR, looking for the detection of the RNAse P human mRNA. We
observed no differences in the cycle threshold (CT) obtained for the detection of the
targeted mRNA, regardless of the collection media (samples A to D), suggesting that
the potential preservation of RNA in the two solutions is similar (Figure 1).

VTM and DS. CT obtained for the RNAse P mRNA from samples A, B, C and D, stored and extracted
from VTM (virus transport media) or DS (denaturing solution).

Having established that DS can be reliably used to collect genetic material, we next
asked for how long DS would keep viral genomic RNA viable for detection, either at
4oC or at room temperature. When compared to day 0 after spiking SARS-Cov2 RNA
into DS tubes, there were no differences in viral RNA detection in days 1, 2, 4, 8 and
16 stored under refrigeration or at room temperature (Figure 2).

Detection of Viral RNA from samples stored in the Viral
Transport Medium and the Denaturing Solution

We next evaluated the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA from clinical
samples collected in VTM or DS. We observed no difference in the amplification
profile (determined by the cycle threshold) of the N1, N2, N3 viral genes or of the
RNAse P mRNA (endogenous control), regardless of the employed collection media
(Figure 3). Results depicted on figure 3 show the mean CT from six randomly
selected SARS-CoV-2-positive patients compared to six randomly selected SARSCoV-2-negative individuals. These results are representative of a much larger panel
of results obtained so far. All tests were also conducted using the Charité/Berlin
qPCR protocol and results were similar (not shown).

All 19 laboratory personnel working at the UFMG’s Vaccine Technology
Center were evaluated throughout the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil, since March
2020, when our laboratory started to offer diagnostic support to hospitals and other
public and private diagnostic laboratories. Laboratory members were tested at least
4 times (with one exception), in 15 days interval, and also by an in-house anti-IgG
COVID-19 ELISA. Notably, none of the laboratory members tested positive in any of
the tests (Table 1). PCR tests were also conducted using the Charité/Berlin protocol
and results were similar (not shown). These findings indicate that there was no
SARS-CoV-2 contamination of any of the professionals involved in the diagnostic
process.

Discussion

Inactivation of potentially infectious clinical samples is a critically important
process during all stages of sample manipulation, from the initial sample collection,
to processing and the final discard of the residual material.12 Previous studies with
other coronaviruses have established that treatment with heat, ultraviolet light,
inactivating chemicals and a variety of detergents are effective in inactivating betacoronavirus.11,

22, 23, 24, 25

Leclercq et al.,26 showed that heat treatment effectively

inactivates MERS-CoV, and Kumar et al.13, demonstrated that the use of solutions
containing guanidine isothiocyanate is capable of inactivating a strain of the MERSCoV, closely related to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. At the same time, the use of
denaturing agents such as guanidine isothiocyanate provides stability to the genetic
material and has been largely used in protocols designed to purify nucleic acids.

In the present study, we have replaced the virus transport media (VTM) which
is commonly used in diagnostic protocols

27

by a denaturing solution (DS) containing

guanidine isothiocyanate, to improve conditions of transportation and storage of
clinical samples suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2. Our data
demonstrated that the use of the denaturing solution in the pre-analytical process
does not interfere with the detection of the presence of viral genes or the
endogenous human mRNA (RNAse P), and results obtaining from samples collected
in VTM or DS were identical in terms of diagnostic accuracy. Of particular
importance is the fact that the DS is able to keep RNA samples viable to be detected
by qPCR for up to 16 days, either at 4oC or at room temperature. This is an essential
feature considering the logistics to take collected samples to diagnostic laboratories
in countries with limited numbers of qPCR-capacitated facilities. Also important, the
multiple evaluation of all laboratory personnel demonstrated that there was no
nosocomial infection or significant exposition to SARS-CoV-2 during more than two
months working with an average of 80 samples/day, since the beginning of the
diagnostic procedures conducted at the laboratory up to the present date. During this
period, more than 3,000 tests were conducted, including samples from more than
2,100 patients and a SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate of approximately 25%.

The use of VTM is particularly indicated when virus viability is important,
especially when SARS-CoV-2 isolation is to be attempted. However, only BSL-3
laboratories should be used to perform experiments involving replicative viruses,
whereas diagnostic procedures that does not involve virus replication can be
conducted in BSL-2 laboratories.10 Media containing live viruses undoubtedly brings
risks to laboratory personnel that manipulate clinical samples under lower biosafety
standards.28 Indeed, nosocomial exposition to SARS-CoV-2 in medical and
laboratory personnel has been reported.29,

30

Therefore, the use of collection and

transport media able to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 with no loss of the diagnostic
analytical power can be critical to avoid nosocomial infections in such laboratories.
This is particularly desirable, as the pandemic epicenter is moving from Asia, Europe
and North America to South America and Africa, where diagnostic laboratories with
adequate biosafety structures are much scarcer. In addition, the use of a denaturing
solution to collect and transport clinical samples, as the one described here, reduces
costs in the processing of samples.11, 12, 13

Our study have important limitations. First, this was not a case-control study,
as our results were not compared to those obtained in a diagnostic laboratory
routinely receiving clinical samples in VTM. Nonetheless, the differences in the
possible extent of live virus exposition when VTM or DS are used are obvious. In this
regard, the fact that none of our laboratory members was either infected or even
seroconverted is an important indication that DS has been helpful in avoiding
nosocomial exposition. Another limitation is that we are not able to quantify to which
extent the good laboratory practices adopted in the laboratory could also be
responsible for the verified results. Nonetheless, the use of the denaturing transport
media is a critical part of such practices. Finally, we attempted to quantify the extent
of SARS-CoV-2 inactivation using the described DS. To that end, isolated, laboratory
cultivated live viruses were loaded on VTM or DS and plated on VERO cells. Viruses
loaded on VTM remained replicative and able to generate plaques in the cellular
monolayers (not shown). On the other hand, even when highly diluted, the guanidine
salt present in DS was extremely toxic to cells, and the monolayers were destroyed
before any eventual plaque could form. Nevertheless, it seems obvious to assume
that, like cells, viruses were equally inactivated during exposition to DS. In spite of
the limitations of our study, the use of denaturing, virus-inactivation solution as a

collection and transportation media for diagnostic purposes is clearly an important
asset to maximize clinical sample viability and minimize nosocomial infections in
diagnostic laboratories, especially considering the SARS-CoV-2 spread to
developing countries in which biosafe-structured laboratories are not easily available.
