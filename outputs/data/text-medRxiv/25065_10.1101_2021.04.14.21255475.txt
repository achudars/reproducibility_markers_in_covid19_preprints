Abstract
BACKGROUND
Increasing age is a risk factor for COVID-19 severity and mortality; emerging science
implicates GM-CSF and dysregulated myeloid cell responses in the pathophysiology of
severe COVID-19.
METHODS
We conducted a large, global, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study
evaluating a single 90 mg infusion of otilimab (human anti-GM-CSF monoclonal) plus
standard of care in adults hospitalized with severe COVID-19 respiratory failure and
systemic inflammation, stratified by age and clinical status. Primary outcome was the
proportion of patients alive and free of respiratory failure at Day 28; secondary
endpoints included all-cause mortality at Day 60.
RESULTS
Overall, 806 patients were randomized (1:1); 71% of patients receiving otilimab were
alive and free of respiratory failure at Day 28 versus 67% receiving placebo, although
this did not reach statistical significance (model-adjusted difference 5.3% [95% CI -0.8,
11.4]; p=0.09). However, there was a benefit in the pre-defined ≥70-year age group
(model-adjusted difference 19.1% [95% CI 5.2, 33.1]; nominal p=0.009); these patients
also had a reduction of 14.4% (95% CI 0.9, 27.9%; nominal p=0.04) in model-adjusted
all-cause mortality at Day 60. Safety findings were comparable between otilimab and
placebo, and consistent with severe COVID-19.

CONCLUSIONS
Although not statistically significant in the overall population, otilimab demonstrated a
substantial benefit in patients aged ≥70, possibly reflecting a population that could
benefit from therapeutic blocking of GM-CSF in severe COVID-19 where myeloid cell
dysregulation is predominant. These findings are being confirmed in a further cohort of
patients aged ≥70 in Part 2 of this study. (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT04376684).

Introduction
Reports of severe pneumonia associated with a novel 2019 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
began to emerge from Wuhan, China in January 2020. Cases often required intensive
care and were associated with significant mortality, with some hospitalized patients
having elevated inflammatory cytokines, including granulocyte-monocyte colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), compared with healthy controls.1,2
The severity and spectrum of the disease (COVID-19) resulting from this infection and
associated immunopathology has been the subject of intense clinical research spanning
trials of a wide range of potential therapeutic agents.3-11 Severe disease is characterized
by systemic inflammation, dysregulated myeloid cell responses, and respiratory and/or
cardiovascular failure.12-16 Older age and chronic health conditions, such as obesity,
diabetes and cardiovascular disease, are risk factors for severe disease.17,18 In
particular, increasing age is strongly associated with worsened disease severity,
intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and increased mortality.19-21
GM-CSF has been implicated as a key cytokine in driving and perpetuating the
hyperinflammation observed in severe COVID-19.22-25 Otilimab is a well-tolerated and
effective, high-affinity, anti–GM-CSF monoclonal antibody that has been shown to
reduce inflammatory disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).26 We designed a
double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (OSCAR [Otilimab in Severe
COVID-19 Related Disease]; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04376684) to investigate
whether otilimab was able to improve clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with
respiratory failure and systemic inflammation secondary to severe COVID-19. During
the study design, we aimed to address the multiple challenges of conducting a high6

quality clinical trial within the context of a pandemic. We were conscious of the large
number of uncontrolled, cohort, open-label, and small therapeutic trials that had been
initiated, and the frequent changes in new treatments introduced into clinical practice,
often with minimal data to support their emergency use. We designed our protocol to
minimize the burden on researchers where possible, to reflect ethnic diversity, and
adapted it as necessary to evolving standards of care.
Methods
Study design and patient selection
Enrollment into Part 1 of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study began on 28 May
2020 and ended on 15 November 2020, with the last patient completing Day 60 on 13
January 2021. Patients were recruited from 108 study sites in 17 countries: Argentina
(6), Belgium (2), Brazil (4), Canada (4), Chile (1), France (12), India (10), Japan (8),
Mexico (4), the Netherlands (5), Peru (3), Poland (5), Russian Federation (8), South
Africa (5), Spain (7), the United Kingdom (4), and the United States (20) (appendix 1).
The study enrolled hospitalized adult patients (≥18 to ≤79 years of age), with confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, new onset hypoxemia requiring any of high-flow oxygen (≥15
L/min), non-invasive ventilation or mechanical ventilation (MV; duration ≤48 hours prior
to dose), and increased biological markers of systemic inflammation (C-reactive protein
or serum ferritin above local upper limit of normal). Key exclusion criteria were: death
considered likely within 48 hours, multiple organ failure according to the investigator’s
opinion or a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score >10 if in the ICU, or
use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, hemofiltration/dialysis, high-dose (>0.15

μg/kg/min) noradrenaline (or equivalent) or >1 vasopressor. Eligible patients were

planned to be in clinical status Category 5 or 6 according to the GSK-modified WHO
ordinal scale27 where: 1 = not hospitalized, no limitation of activity; 2 = not hospitalized,
limitation of activity; 3 = hospitalized, no oxygen therapy; 4 = hospitalized, low-flow
oxygen by mask or nasal prongs; 5 = hospitalized, high-flow oxygen (≥15 L/min),
continuous positive airway pressure, bilevel positive airway pressure non-invasive
ventilation; 6 = hospitalized, intubation and MV; 7 = hospitalized, MV plus additional
organ support; 8 = death. Additional details are provided in the protocol.
As a precaution, a safety cohort was planned, whereby initial dosing for the first four
Category 5 patients was staggered and safety data were independently reviewed prior
to enrollment of an initial safety cohort of 16 additional Category 5 patients, before the
study progressed to the main cohort of patients.
Study treatments
Patients were centrally randomized 1:1 by interactive response technology in a blinded
manner to either a single one-hour intravenous (IV) infusion of otilimab 90 mg (aiming to
achieve serum otilimab concentrations through to Day 7 similar to steady-state trough in
patients with RA) or placebo (saline). In the safety cohort a randomization block size of
two was used for the first and second sentinel pairs, and four for the remaining 16
patients. In the main cohort, patients were stratified by clinical status (Category 5 or 6)
and age group (<60, 60 to 69, and ≥70 years) with a block size of four.
An unblinded pharmacist dispensed the study intervention, ensuring no differences in
labelling or time taken to dispense between the two interventions. Investigators, who
enrolled the patients, and the patients remained blinded to assigned study intervention
throughout the study. In addition, all patients received standard care according to

institutional protocols. Medications not permitted prior to enrollment or during the study
included monoclonal antibodies (e.g. tocilizumab, sarilumab), immunosuppressants,
and chronic oral corticosteroid use >10 mg/day prednisone equivalent for a non-COVID19–related condition. Additional or prior medications for COVID-19–related disease
were permitted if part of local institutional policies and not part of a clinical trial.
Assessments and outcome measures
Patients were assessed daily until discharge from the investigational site or Day 28,
whichever was sooner, in addition to follow up at Days 42 and 60. Clinical status was
assessed according to the GSK-modified WHO ordinal scale as described above. In
addition to standard care, data were collected on ventilation status and the clinical
features of COVID-19, with blood samples collected for pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic biomarker analysis.
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients alive and free of respiratory failure
(clinical status Categories 1, 2, 3, or 4) at Day 28. Secondary efficacy outcomes were:
all-cause mortality at Day 60 (all-cause mortality at Day 28 was defined post hoc); time
to all-cause mortality up to Day 60; proportion of patients alive and free of respiratory
failure at Days 7, 14, 42, and 60; time to recovery from respiratory failure up to Day 28;
proportion of patients alive and independent of supplementary oxygen (clinical status
Categories 1, 2, or 3) at Days 7, 14, 28, 42, and 60; time to last dependence on
supplementary oxygen up to Day 28; admission to ICU up to Day 28; time to final ICU
discharge up to Day 28; and, revised prior to unblinding from “time to final hospital
discharge up to Day 28”, to time to first discharge from investigational site up to Day 60,
and time to first discharge to a non-hospital residence up to Day 60. Exploratory

endpoints are listed in the protocol. Occurrence of adverse events (AEs) and serious
adverse events (SAEs) was reported up to Day 60 and recorded according to the
system organ class and preferred terms in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities (MedDRA), v23.1.
Statistical analysis
The study used a group sequential design, using a Lan-DeMets alpha-spending function
to control the type I error with four interim analyses planned for futility using Pocock
analogue rules, and two interim analyses planned for efficacy using the O’Brien-Fleming
analogue rules.28 The final interim analysis was not performed as the study completed
recruitment prior to the data-cut being reached. Full details of the design parameters
and decision criteria are included in the statistical analysis plan.
A sample size of 800 patients provided approximately 90% power to detect a difference
of 12% in the proportion of patients alive and free of respiratory failure at a one-sided
2.5% significance level and an assumed placebo response rate of 45%.
The primary endpoint was analyzed using logistic regression adjusting for treatment,
age group and clinical status (Category 5 and Category 6) at baseline. Missing data in
the overall primary analysis were imputed using multiple imputation, assuming data are
missing at random, and adjusting for analysis covariates. The primary endpoint was
also analyzed by pre-defined subgroups of clinical status (Categories 5 and 6) and age
group (<60, 60 to 69, and ≥70 years), as detailed in the statistical analysis plan.

The primary population for analysis included all patients who were randomized and
received study drug (modified intent-to-treat [mITT]). Results are presented with twosided p-values. Additional details are provided in the statistical analysis plan.
Study oversight
The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Council for
International Organizations of Medical Sciences International Ethical Guidelines,
International Conference on Harmonization, Good Clinical Practice, and applicable
country-specific regulatory requirements. The protocol was approved by relevant
institutional review boards (IRB/IEC). Before patient enrollment, informed consent was
obtained written/orally from the patient or written/orally from the patient’s legally
authorized representative. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC)
monitored in-stream unblinded safety and efficacy data throughout the study and at predefined interim analyses.
Results
Patients
A total of 851 patients were screened, 806 were randomized, and 793 included in the
mITT population (395 in the otilimab group and 398 in the placebo group) (Figure 1).
Within the pre-defined stratification groups, 630 (78%) were in clinical status Category 5
and 176 (22%) in Category 6; with 363 (45%), 262 (33%), and 181 (22%) in the <60, 60
to 69, and ≥70-year age groups, respectively. The safety population included 397
treated with otilimab and 396 in the placebo group, because two patients randomized to
placebo were incorrectly dosed with otilimab. By Day 60, 379/403 (94%) patients in the

otilimab group and 388/403 (96%) on placebo either completed the study or had died.
None of the patients discontinued participation because of safety reasons.
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics were generally well balanced
between the two study groups and were reflective of severe COVID-19 with elevated
levels of markers of systemic inflammation and GM-CSF (Table 1) compared with
healthy controls (data not shown). The mean (± standard deviation) age was 59.8
(±11.7) years in the otilimab group and 59.4 (±11.9) years in the placebo group. Most
patients were pre-treated with COVID-19 medications; specifically, 83% received
corticosteroids (including dexamethasone), 34% received remdesivir, and 6% received
convalescent plasma prior to randomization. Two patients (<1%) in the otilimab group
and 7 (2%) in the placebo group received tocilizumab post-study treatment, and none
received sarilumab.
Primary outcome
Although 71% of patients in the otilimab group were alive and free of respiratory failure
at Day 28 compared with 67% on placebo (Figure 2), the model-adjusted difference of
5.3% did not reach statistical significance (95% CI -0.8, 11.4; p=0.09). Similar modeladjusted treatment differences of 5.9% (95% CI -0.8, 12.7) and 4.6% (95% CI -9.6,
18.8) were observed for patients in Categories 5 and 6 (Figure 2). However, although
the pre-defined subgroup analysis by age revealed little benefit in patients aged <60 or
60 to 69 years, there was a nominally significant model-adjusted difference of 19.1%
(95% CI 5.2, 33.1; p=0.009) in patients ≥70 years (Figure 2).

Although post-hoc analyses suggested a greater benefit with otilimab in females and
patients with comorbidities (particularly hypertension), there was little impact of
geographic region or pre-treatment (and mostly continued) use of dexamethasone
(Figure S1A; appendix 2). However, the response in patients aged ≥70 years was
consistent regardless of disease severity (Figure 2), dexamethasone use, or
comorbidities (Figure S1B; appendix 2).
All-cause mortality
In the mITT population, all-cause mortality at Day 60 was 23% in the otilimab group
compared with 24% on placebo (model-adjusted difference -2.4% [95% CI -8.0, 3.3];
p=0.41) (Figure 2). However, in the ≥70-year age group there was lower mortality at
Day 60 with otilimab (27%) versus placebo (41%) (model-adjusted difference -14.4%
[95% CI -27.9, -0.9]; nominal p=0.04). Additionally, there was a trend of reduced
mortality at Day 28 with otilimab in a post-hoc analysis showing a model-adjusted
difference of -11.3% (95% CI -24.0, 1.4; p=0.09) in this subgroup (Figure 2).
Additional post-hoc secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints
All other secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints were analyzed for the mITT
population and also post hoc by age groups. In the ≥70-year age group, there was a
greater proportion of responders (Figures 3A–L) with otilimab versus placebo for all
secondary endpoints. Treatment effects were generally apparent 7–10 days after dosing
(Figures 3A–L). For the exploratory endpoint of change from baseline in fraction of
inspired oxygen (FiO2) a greater reduction was observed in patients on otilimab
compared to those on placebo in both the mITT population and ≥70-year group (Figures
3M and N).

Pharmacokinetics
A single dose of otilimab resulted in mean Cmax of 20.2 μg/mL after dosing on Day 1 and
1.9 μg/mL on Day 7, with coefficient of variation of 43% and 69% respectively; similar
levels were achieved in the ≥70 age group (Supplementary Figure S2). In the otilimab
arm, GM-CSF levels at Day 2, proximal to Cmax, were reduced by 95% to a mean of
0.037 ng/L with 255/381 (67%) samples falling below the assay lower limit of
quantification (0.036 ng/L); levels in the placebo arm remained unchanged (data not
shown).
Safety
Overall, safety findings, including the scope of AEs and SAEs, were reflective of the
severe COVID-19 population. Of note, an overall pattern of increasing frequency of AEs
and SAEs was observed with advancing age irrespective of treatment assignment. The
most common AEs and SAEs in the safety population and each age subgroup (defined
post hoc) are listed in Table 2. No safety signals related to treatment with otilimab were
identified.
In patients ≥70 years who received otilimab, there were reduced frequencies of
investigator-reported hypoxemia and pulmonary embolism compared with placebo. This
observation may be linked to the greater recovery from respiratory failure with otilimab
seen in this ≥70-year subgroup of patients compared with the total safety population.
Discussion
This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial in hospitalized adults with
severe COVID-19 pneumonia (clinical status Categories 5 and 6) showed that otilimab
was associated with a model-adjusted increase of 5.3% in the proportion of patients

alive and free of respiratory failure (clinical status Categories 1, 2, 3, or 4) at Day 28.
Although this result did not reach statistical significance in the overall population, in the
pre-defined subgroup of patients aged ≥70 years, treatment with otilimab resulted in
significantly more patients alive and free of respiratory failure at Day 28 than those on
placebo (by a model-adjusted difference of 19.1%), and a corresponding decrease in
all-cause mortality at Day 60. The safety findings in all age groups were as expected for
a population with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, with the most common SAE being
respiratory failure. Fewer SAEs were observed in the subgroup of patients ≥70 years
treated with otilimab versus placebo, notably including pulmonary embolism and
hypoxemia.
The biological plausability of the observed clinical benefit in patients ≥70 years is
supported by the observation that older patients may be predisposed to inappropriate,
myeloid cell-driven hyperinflammation as a consequence of normal aging of the immune
system (immunosenescence and inflammaging).29,30 The marked systemic inflammation
associated with severe COVID-19 may, at least in part, be driven by dysregulated
myeloid cells,31-36 which may be enhanced by the early upregulation of GM-CSF in
patients >70 years.24 Therefore older patients, who are least likely to recover with
standard of care alone, may preferentially benefit from targeting the dysregulated
myeloid cell responses observed in severe COVID-19 by inhibiting GM-CSF compared
with younger patients.
The treatment benefits oberved in the ≥70 year group were apparent across the majority
of the secondary endpoints assessed over time, and were generally maintained to Day

60. The observed trends in improved oxygenation response to otilimab may be
reflective of an early mechanistic response.
Assumptions made about placebo group responses during the design of the study in
March 2020 proved to significantly underestimate the observed response (67% cf.
45%). This difference likely reflects the substantial improvements in the standard of care
of COVID-19 during our study timeframe, including ventilation practices and
corticosteroid use, amongst many other changes to patient management and healthcare
resourcing.
At the time of writing, severe COVID-19 is still prevalent in older adults (with additional
waves in many countries), and the high mortality in this age group supports the urgent
need for additional treatment options for these most at-risk patients. We have therefore
