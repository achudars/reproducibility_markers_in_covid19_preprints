ABSTRACT

40
41

BACKGROUND. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the infectious

42

agent responsible for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). While SARS-CoV-2 infections are often

43

benign, there are also severe COVID-19 cases, characterized by severe bilobar pneumonia that can

44

decompensate to an acute respiratory distress syndrome, notably characterized by increased

45

inflammation and a cytokine storm. While there is no cure against severe COVID-19 cases, some

46

treatments significantly decrease the severity of the disease, notably aspirin and dexamethasone, which

47

both directly or indirectly target the biosynthesis (and effects) of numerous bioactive lipids.

48
49

OBJECTIVE. Our working hypothesis was that severe COVID-19 cases necessitating mechanical

50

ventilation were characterized by increased bioactive lipid levels modulating lung inflammation. We thus

51

quantitated several lung bioactive lipids using liquid chromatography combined to tandem mass

52

spectrometry.

53
54

RESULTS. We performed an exhaustive assessment of the lipid content of bronchoalveolar lavages

55

from 25 healthy controls and 33 COVID-19 patients necessitating mechanical ventilation. Severe

56

COVID-19 patients were characterized by increased fatty acid levels as well as an accompanying

57

inflammatory lipid storm. As such, most quantified bioactive lipids were heavily increased. There was a

58

predominance of cyclooxygenase metabolites, notably TXB2 >> PGE2 ~ 12-HHTrE > PGD2.

59

Leukotrienes were also increased, notably LTB4, 20-COOH-LTB4, LTE4, and eoxin E4. 15-lipoxygenase

60

metabolites derived from linoleic, arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids were also

61

increased. Finally, yet importantly, specialized pro-resolving mediators, notably lipoxin A4 and the D-

62

series resolvins, were also found at important levels, underscoring that the lipid storm occurring in severe

63

SARS-CoV-2 infections involves pro- and anti-inflammatory lipids.

64
65

CONCLUSIONS. Our data unmask the important lipid storm occurring in the lungs of patients afflicted

66

with severe COVID-19. We discuss which clinically available drugs could be helpful at modulating the

67

lipidome we observed in the hope of minimizing the deleterious effects of pro-inflammatory lipids and

68

enhancing the effects of anti-inflammatory and/or pro-resolving lipids.

INTRODUCTION

81

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory

82

Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1). The clinical manifestations of the disease are often mild

83

but severe cases can lead to bilobar pneumonia with hyperactivation of the inflammatory cascade and

84

progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), necessitating mechanical ventilation (2, 3).

85

SARS-CoV-2 spreads predominantly from respiratory droplets of infected individuals to mucosal

86

epithelial cells in the upper airways and oral cavity (4). It infects cells via its homotrimeric spike protein

87

binding to host-cell expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor in a protease-

88

dependent manner (5).

89
90

Autopsies from severe COVID-19 patients unmasked a heterogeneous disease that can be characterized

91

by diffuse alveolar damage, endothelial damage, thrombosis of small and medium vessels, pulmonary

92

embolism, and inflammatory cell infiltration, sometimes more lymphocytic, sometimes more

93

granulocytic (3, 6-8). An uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response known as the cytokine storm also

94

occurs. This cytokine storm, which is the consequence of an important release of pro-inflammatory

95

cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-7 and granulocyte-colony

96

stimulating factor, is suggested as an important contributor of SARS-CoV-2 lethality (8, 9). However,

97

the heterogeneity of the disease indicates that, aside cytokines (and chemokines), other immunological

98

effectors contribute to the sustained inflammatory responses observed in the most severe forms of

99

COVID-19.

100
101

Among the numerous soluble effectors involved in the infectious/inflammatory response, bioactive lipids

102

such as eicosanoids likely promote their fair share of deleterious effects, notably by enhancing leukocyte

103

recruitment and activation, by participating in the exudate formation and by stimulating platelet

104

aggregation and thrombus formation. In contrast, specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), which

105

mainly consist of docosanoids, could dampen the inflammatory response and even promote its resolution

106

(10). While therapeutic approaches targeting the biosynthesis or effects of inflammatory lipids are readily

107

available, the levels of those lipids in the lungs during severe COVID-19 remain unknown.

108
109

Herein, we performed a detailed lipidomic analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids from healthy

110

volunteers and severe COVID-19 patients. We provide evidence that severe COVID-19 patients are

111

characterized by robust levels of lipids arising from the cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX)

pathways as well increased SPM levels. Our study further highlights that few associations exist between

113

clinical parameters and bioactive lipids present in the primary site of disease, the lungs.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

115
116

Materials

117

All lipids were obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA) unless indicated otherwise.

118

DMSO and C17:1-LPA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St-Louis, MO, USA). DMSO, ammonium

119

acetate, acetic acid, LC-MS-grade MeOH, MeCN and H2O were purchased from Fisher Scientific

120

(Ottawa, Canada). Cytokine/chemokine bead arrays were purchased from Becton Dickinson (BD).

121
122

Ethics

123

This study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee of Cheikh Zaid Hospital (Project:

124

CEFCZ/PR/2020- PR04), Rabat, Morocco and complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and all subjects

125

signed a consent form. The analysis of bioactive lipids in the BAL of healthy donors and severe COVID-

126

19 patients was approved by the Comité d’éthique de la recherche de l’Institut universitaire de cardiologie

127

et de pneumologie de Québec – Université Laval and the Comité d’éthique de la recherche du CHU de

128

Québec-Université Laval.

129
130

Clinical criteria for subject selection. Non-smoking healthy subjects taking no other medication than

131

anovulants, without any documented acute or chronic inflammatory disease and without recent (8 weeks)

132

airway infection were recruited for bronchoalveolar lavages at Institut universitaire de cardiologie et

133

pneumologie de Québec (Québec City, Canada). Only BALs in which the cell content in alveolar

134

macrophages was greater than 95%, with lymphocytes as the other main cell type, were kept for further

135

analyses. Severe COVID-19 patients were enrolled based on the inclusion criteria for intubation and the

136

need of mechanical ventilation support at Cheikh Zaid Hospital (Rabat, Morocco). Following intubation

137

and the initiation of mechanical ventilation, blood sampling was done to assess the clinical variables

138

shown in Table 1. Patients were ventilated in the prone decubitus position with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg

139

and a PEEP varying between 8 – 14 cm H2O. The FiO2 was adjusted between 0.6 – 1.0 to obtain a SpO2

140

≥ 92%.

141
142

Bronchoalveolar lavages. BAL fluids from healthy volunteers were obtained as follows: One 50 ml

143

bolus of sterile 0.9% saline was injected in a sub-segmental bronchi of the right middle lobe. The obtained

144

lavages were centrifuged (350 × g, 10 minutes) to pellet cells and the supernatants were immediately

145

frozen (-80º Celsius) until further processing. A 5 ml aliquot of the samples was thawed then reduced to

146

~500 µl using a stream of nitrogen. BAL fluids from severe COVID-19 patients were obtained less than

2 hrs following intubation and as follows: a total of 100 ml of sterile 0.9% saline (2 boli of 50 ml) was

148

injected in a sub-segmental bronchi of the right middle lobe. The obtained lavages were pooled and

149

centrifuged (320 × g, 15 minutes) to pellet cells. Supernatants were next concentrated as for the BALs of

150

healthy donors using a stream of nitrogen and immediately frozen (-80º Celsius) until further processing.

151

All of the evaporated samples were processed for LC-MS/MS analysis as described below.

152
153

LC-MS/MS analyses. Samples (500 µl) were denatured by adding 500 µl of LC-MS grade MeOH

154

containing the internal standards then warmed at 60º Celsius for 30 minutes to inactivate (or not) SARS-

155

CoV-2. Samples were then denatured overnight (-20º Celsius). The morning after, samples were warmed

156

to room temperature and centrifuged at 10,000 × g to remove the denaturated proteins. The obtained

157

supernatants were diluted with water containing 0.01% acetic acid to obtain a MeOH concentration of

158

10%, then acidified to pH 3 with acetic acid. Lipids were extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE) using

159

Strata-X cartridges (Polymeric Reversed Phase, 60 mg/1 ml, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) as

160

described before (11). In brief, columns were preconditioned with 2 ml MeOH containing 0.01% acetic

161

acid followed by 2 ml LC-MS grade H2O containing 0.01% acetic acid. After sample loading, the

162

columns were washed with 2 ml LC-MS grade H2O containing 0.01% acetic acid. Lipids were then eluted

163

from the cartridges with 1 ml MeOH containing 0.01% acetic acid. Eluates were dried under a stream of

164

nitrogen and reconstituted with 25 µl of solvent A (H2O + 1 mM NH4 + 0.05% acetic acid) and 25 µl of

165

solvent B (MeCN/H2O, 95/5, v/v + 1 mM NH4 + 0.05% acetic acid). A volume of 40 µl of the resulting

166

mixture was injected onto a RP‐HPLC column (Kinetex C8, 150 × 2.1 mm, 2.6 µm, Phenomenex).

167

Samples were eluted at a flow rate of 400 µl/min with a linear gradient of 10% solvent B that increased

168

to 35% in 2 min, up to 75% in 10 min, from 75% to 95% in 0.1 min, and held at 98% for 5 min before

169

re‐equilibration to 10% solvent B for 2 min. The HPLC system was directly interfaced into the

170

electrospray source of a Shimadzu 8050 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer and mass spectrometric

171

analyses were performed in the positive (+) or the negative (−) ion mode using multiple reaction

172

monitoring for the specific mass transitions of each lipid (Table 2). Quantification of each compound

173

was done using internal standards and calibration curves that were extracted by solid-phase extraction as

174

described above.

175
176

Statistical analysis

177

Statistical analyses were done using the GraphPad Prism 9 software. P values < 0.05 were considered

178

significant.

RESULTS

181

While the circulating (plasmatic) cytokines’ profile observed in severe COVID-19 patients is relatively

182

well-defined (8, 12-14), a much more limited number of studies characterizing the cytokine storm in the

183

lungs of severe COVID-19 patients were available (13, 15, 16). In fact, to the best of our knowledge, no

184

study simultaneously quantitated numerous soluble mediators in BAL fluids. We thus performed their

185

lipidomic analysis in order to define whether an inflammatory lipid storm was present in the lungs of

186

severe COVID-19 patients. Samples were compared to those obtained from healthy subjects. As a

187

starting point, we investigated eicosanoids derived from the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway. Our

188

working hypothesis was that some COX metabolites would be increased, considering that IL-1β levels

189

are elevated in the BALs of some COVID-19 patients (16) and that IL-1β is a potent inducer of

190

cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression (17-19). The only COX metabolites that were detected in the BALs

191

of healthy subjects were PGD2 (16 donors out of 25) and 12-HHTrE (2 donors out of 25). In contrast,

192

BALs from severe COVID-19 patients had a significant increase of all COX metabolites investigated

193

(figure 1). Most samples had detectable levels of PGD2 (27 of 33 donors) and the PGI2 metabolite 6-

194

keto-PGF1α (16 of 33 donors), while all samples contained PGF2α, important levels of PGE2, the inactive

195

TXA2 metabolite TXB2, and the thromboxane synthase metabolite 12-HHTrE (figure 1A). Although

196

there was a significant increase in all metabolites, the most increased COX-derived metabolites were

197

TXB2 >> PGE2 ~ 12-HHTrE > PGD2. We next addressed if the different COX metabolites correlated

198

with each other. The levels of TXB2 strongly correlated with those of 12-HHTrE, PGD2, PGE2 and PGF2α

199

(figure 1B-E). Of note, few correlations were found between COX metabolites and the clinical

200

parameters shown in Table1. To that end, PGF2α and 12-HHTrE weakly but significantly correlated

201

negatively with AST (figure 7),

202
203

Leukotrienes are also potent bioactive lipids previously documented to regulate the inflammatory

204

responses in the airway/lung in diseases, notably ARDS (20, 21). As such, their involvement in the

205

pathogenesis of COVID-19 has recently been postulated even though their levels were unknown (22).

206

We thus quantitated the levels of leukotrienes derived from the 5-lipoxygenase pathway as well as those

207

derived from the 15-lipoxygenase pathway, the 14,15-leukotrienes, which are now classified as eoxins

208

(23). Leukotrienes were not detected in the BAL fluids of healthy volunteers, with the exception of LTB4,

209

which was detected in 4 of 25 healthy subjects. In contrast, COVID-19 patients were characterized by

210

increased levels of LTB4 and its CYP4F3A metabolite 20-COOH-LTB4 (figure 2A) as well as other

211

minor metabolites (20-OH-LTB4 and 12-oxo-LTB4). Of note, the levels of LTB4 found in the BAL fluids

212

of severe COVID-19 patients are comparable to those found in BAL fluids of ARDS patients (16). As

213

expected, there was a strong correlation between the levels of LTB4 and those of 20-COOH-LTB4 (figure

214

2B). Importantly, the ratio between the sum of 20-OH- and 20-COOH-LTB4 to LTB4 ((20-OH- + 20-

215

COOH-LTB4)/LTB4) was 2.843 +/- 0.532 (mean +/- SEM), indicating an increased omega oxidation of

216

LTB4. The levels of LTB4 strongly correlated with those of TXB2 (figure 2C). The cysteinyl-leukotrienes

217

LTE4 and EXE4 were also found in most severe COVID-19 patients (figure 2D). Surprisingly, the levels

218

of EXE4 trended to be higher than those of LTE4. Furthermore, there was a trend toward a negative

219

correlation between LTE4 and EXE4 levels although it did not reach statistical significance (figure 2E).

220

This suggests that some COVID-19 patients are more prone to biosynthesize the 15-lipoxygnease-

221

derived EXC4 while others are more prone to biosynthesize the 5-lipoxygenase-derived LTC4. Of note,

222

LTB4 levels correlated with those of EXE4 but not with those of LTE4 (figure 2F,G). Again, a limited

223

number of correlations between the different leukotrienes and the clinical parameters from Table 1 were

224

found (figure 7), supporting the concept that the levels of leukotrienes in the lungs are not reflected in

225

the blood by the most recognized COVID-19-related biomarkers.

226
227

The prostaglandins and leukotrienes data (figures 1 and 2) support the idea that an increase in both

228

arachidonic acid (AA) release and metabolism occurs in severe COVID-19 patients. As such, we

229

investigated the levels of some fatty acids, which are the precursors of oxidized linoleic acid (LA)

230

mediators (OXLAMs), eicosanoids and docosanoids. To that end, the levels of LA, AA,

231

docosapentaenoic acid n-3 (DPAn-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were all significantly increased

232

in the BALs of severe COVID-19 patients. In contrast, the levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) did not

233

change (figure 3). Of note, all tested BAL fatty acids negatively correlated with AST and ALT but

234

positively correlated with the circulating platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (figure 7).

235
236

The increased fatty acid levels (figure 3) and the increased in the 15-lipoxygenase-derived eoxins (figure

237

2D) led us to investigate if other fatty acid-related biosynthetic pathways were also enhanced in SARS-

238

CoV-2-infected patients. To that end, we also quantitated additional AA-derived metabolites derived

239

from the 12- and 15-lipoxygenases. The levels of 12-HETE and 15-HETE were also significantly

240

increased in the BAL fluids of severe COVID-19 patients, although not to the same extent than the 5-

241

lipoxygenase metabolite 5-HETE (figure 4A), indicating that AA metabolism via the 15-lipoxygenase

242

(and possibly the 12-lipoxygenase) pathway is increased. In addition to AA, the 15-lipoxygenase

243

pathway can metabolize numerous polyunsaturated fatty acids having a 1Z,4Z-pentadiene motif near

244

their omega end, notably LA, EPA, DPAn-3 and DHA. We thus also assessed the levels of their most

245

documented 15-lipoxygenase metabolites and found significant increases in 13-HODE (derived from

246

LA), 15-HETrE (derived from dihomo-γ-linolenic acid, DGLA), 12-, 15-, and 18-HEPE, 17-HDPA(n-

247

3) as well as 14- and 17-HDHA (figure 4B,C). Dual lipoxygenases metabolites from AA were also

248

significantly increased (figure 4D). Of note, the levels of 15-HETE strongly correlated with those of 13-

249

HODE (figure 4E) supporting an increased 15-lipoxygenase activity in the lungs of severe COVID-19

250

patients. Furthermore, 15-HETE levels also correlated with those of TXB2 (figure 4F). Finally yet

251

importantly, we also detected significant increases in 9-HODE, 8-HETE, and 11-HETE, which arise from

252

the non-enzymatic oxidation of LA and AA, pointing to an increased oxidative bust in the lungs of severe

253

COVID-19 patients (figure 4A,B).

254
255

14- and 17-HDHA, which are increased in the BALs of severe COVID-19 patients (figure 4C), are often

256

regarded as good indicators of D-series resolvin and maresin levels, which are part of the ever-expanding

257

class of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs). SPMs are usually more complicated to quantitate

258

due to their very low concentrations (10). Given their documented pro-resolving actions and anti-

259

microbial activities, SPMs were recently postulated as being a potential approach for diminishing the

260

inflammatory burden of COVID-19 (24). We thus investigated the levels of some commercially available

261

SPMs. All SPMs were below detection limit in the BAL samples of healthy volunteers we analyzed. In

262

contrast, most investigated SPMs, aside from RvD3, were detected in the BAL fluids of severe COVID-

263

19 patients. LXA4 was the most prominent one, followed by RvD4, RvD5, RvD2, RVD1 and PDX

264

(figure 5A). RvD5 levels correlated with those of RvD4 (figure 5B) but not those of DHA (figure 5C)

265

indicating that the same patients are responsible for the increased D-series resolvins, which is mostly due

266

to increased 15-lipoxygenase activity rather than an increase in DHA availability. The levels of RvD5

267

also correlated with those of TXB2 (figure 5D). Again, there was no correlation between RvD5 with the

268

clinical parameters from table 1. Unsurprisingly, the levels of LXA4 correlated with those of 5-HETE

269

and 15-HETE (figure 5E,F), given that LXA4 biosynthesis requires both the 5- and the 15-lipoxygenase

270

pathways. As for RvD5, the levels of LXA4 also correlated with those of TXB2 and the other

271

prostaglandins (figure 6). Despite our good sensitivity (see table 2), we did not detect the presence or

272

RvE1, Maresin-1 and -2.

273
274

When assessing the lipidome for which we could quantitate a given lipid mediator in at least 50% of

275

severe COVID-19 patients, we can appreciate that most lipids consistently correlated with each other

276

with few exceptions (figure 6). Indeed, Fatty acids levels were not a key determinant for the levels of

277

their metabolites, indicating that downstream enzymes (cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases) are likely more

278

important in that respect. Furthermore, and in agreement with their almost significant negative

DISCUSSION

283
284

Bioactive lipids are recognized pharmaceutical targets for the treatment of numerous inflammatory

285

diseases and lipid modulators have been utilized as such, in the last fifty years, with great success. It was

286

thus imperative, at least to us, to define whether bioactive lipid levels were modulated in the context of

287

severe COVID-19.

288
289

Herein, we provide clear evidences that the BALs of severe COVID-19 patients contain large amounts

290

of bioactive lipids, which likely participate in the deleterious inflammatory response found in severe

291

cases. More specifically, our data indicate that the BALs of severe COVID-19 patients are characterized

292

by 1) an increase in COX metabolites, notably the TXA2 metabolite TXB2; 2) an increase in LTB4 and

293

its metabolites; 3) an increase in CysLT metabolites; 4) an increase of 15-lipoxygenases metabolites

294

derived from LA, AA, EPA, DPA and DHA; 5) an increase in SPMs derived from AA and DHA; and 6)

295

a limited number of correlations between BAL lipids vs. blood markers and/or clinical parameters.

296
297

Cyclooxygenase metabolites were heavily increased in the BALs of severe COVID-19 patients (figure

298

1). This was somewhat expected, notably because of the increased levels of IL-1β described before (16),

299

the latter being a good COX-2 inducer. In the lungs, COX metabolites play multiple roles. TXA2

300

promotes bronchoconstriction and activate inflammatory cells and platelets, which might be consistent

301

with the reported enhanced platelet activation and increased thrombosis in COVID-19 (14, 25, 26). On

302

the other hand, PGD2 acting via the DP2 receptor promotes the recruitment and activation of eosinophils,

303

basophils, mastocytes and innate lymphoid cells (27-30). In contrast, PGE2 is usually regarded as anti-

304

inflammatory in the lungs, notably by downregulating the pro-inflammatory functions of myeloid

305

leukocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages, notably by activating the EP2 and EP4 receptors,

306

ultimately leading to increased cyclic AMP levels (31). Therapies targeting the prostaglandin pathway

307

are numerous and usually effective at controlling inflammation. Dexamethasone, a steroid improving

308

COVID-19 symptoms and diminishing mortality (32-34), limits COX-2 expression (35-37) and might

309

thus improve COVID-19 severity, at least in part, by diminishing the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and

310

possibly TXA2. Furthermore, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and

311

ibuprofen are recognized inhibitor of cyclooxygenase activity. Early at the beginning of the pandemic, it

312

was postulated that NSAIDs could worsen the severity of COVID-19 (38). However, a Danish study

313

indicated that ibuprofen was not linked to severe adverse outcome (39). Furthermore, aspirin was recently

314

shown to significantly diminish ICU admissions and the need of mechanical ventilation in an

315

observational, retrospective study (40). Altogether, our data, combined with the recent studies on their

316

safety in a context of COVID-19, support the hypothesis that dexamethasone and NSAIDs might

317

diminish

318

prostaglandins/thromboxane storm in the lungs. While TXA2 and PGD2 might have deleterious effects

319

in the lungs, PGE2 and PGI2 might have the opposite effect, notably by inhibiting leukocyte functions

320

(PGE2) and/or promoting the vasodilation of the microvasculature (PGI2). To that end, testing whether

321

blocking the deleterious effects of PGD2 and TXA2 with the dual DP2/TP antagonist Ramotraban might

322

be beneficial in this particular context, as proposed recently (41).

COVID-19

patients

by

diminishing

the

323
324

Prostaglandins and TXA2, as assessed by quantitating TXB2 levels, were not the only eicosanoids that

325

were increased in the BALs of severe COVID-19 patients. Indeed, leukotrienes were also increased,

326

notably LTB4, LTE4, and EXE4 (figure 2). This indicates that in addition of the deleterious effects that

327

some COX metabolites might have, those linked to LTB4 and CysLTs might also impair lung functions

328

and participate in the inflammatory burden in the lungs of severe COVID-19 patients (22). While LTB4

329

has previously been shown to stimulate host defense (41), notably during viral infections, the

330

w-LTB4/LTB4 ratio of 2.84 we observed is more reminiscent of what is found in cystic fibrosis and

331

severely burned patients, two conditions in which infections are not well controlled (42-45).

332

Conceptually, this might diminish the effectiveness of LTB4 at promoting its host-defense related

333

functions, as we recently published (46). Interestingly, there was a trend toward an inverse correlation

334

between LTE4 and EXE4, indicating that these cysteinyl-LTs are likely coming from different cellular

335

sources. This was supported by the differential and significant correlations between the different lipids

336

we observed, LTE4 and EXE4 differentially correlating with distinct lipids (figure 6). To that end, EXE4

337

levels in the BALs positively and significantly correlated with blood eosinophils counts. While there was

338

a strong trend between EXE4 and BAL eosinophils counts the latter correlation had a p value of 0.0536.

339

Altogether, this suggests that the presence and/or biosynthesis of eoxins is, in part, linked to eosinophils.

340

A therapeutic approach to target LTs from the 5-lipoxygenase pathway could be the use of Zileuton,

341

which is commercially available for the management of asthma and has a good safety profile (47).

342
343

Another pharmaceutical approach that could simultaneously diminish the levels of COX and

344

5-lipoxygenase-derived eicosanoids could be the use of phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors such as

345

Roflumilast. While there is no evidence of phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors’ efficacy in the management

346

of SARS-CoV-2-infected people (48), they might diminish inflammation by preventing the degradation

347

of cyclic AMP, increasing intracellular cAMP concentrations and decreasing the release of AA, the

348

precursor of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Furthermore, cAMP-elevating agents such as adenosine

349

and PGE2 are recognized anti-inflammatory autacoids that inhibit numerous leukocyte functions such as

350

eicosanoid biosynthesis, oxidative burst, calcium mobilization and migration (49-53). While

351

phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors might diminish the levels of PGE2 by diminishing AA levels, they would

352

nonetheless amplify the inhibitory effects of the remaining PGE2, as recently demonstrated in cellulo

353

(54).

354
355

While it is largely accepted that the group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2 mediates most of AA release

356

in activated human leukocytes (e.g. in (55)), the increased levels of LA, EPA and DHA support the idea

357

that other phospholipases A2 are also heavily involved in the lipidome we have quantitated. Those

358

additional phospholipases likely belong to the superfamily of secreted phospholipases A2, which can

359

hydrolyze phospholipids containing fatty acids other than AA (56, 57) and are reported to contribute to

360

lung inflammation (58-61). However, and assuming that a large part of eicosanoids is the consequence

361

of the group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2, our findings do not allow us to pinpoint which other

362

phospholipases are involved in the release of LA, AA, EPA, DPA and DHA.

363
364

The metabolism of EPA, DPA and DHA, which are omega-3 fatty acids, often results in the biosynthesis

365

of SPMs, most of which are anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving lipids. Their presence in high levels

366

was somewhat surprising as they are generally thought to appear during the resolution of inflammation,

367

after the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes has occurred and following a class-switch from

368

pro-inflammatory to pro-resolving lipids (62). However, our data indicate that prostaglandins,

369

leukotrienes and SPMs can certainly co-exist and participate in the inflammatory cascade during the

370

acute phase of inflammation/infection in which resolution has not been fully engaged. Moreover, given

371

their strong documented anti-inflammatory effects and their host-defense boosting functions, they could

372

be viewed as potential mediators to enhance to limit the infection. To that end, it was recently proposed

373

that dexamethasone could participate in the upregulation of SPM biosynthesis and effects in moderate to

374

severe COVID-19 patients, although this needs to be confirmed (63). While omega-3 fatty acids, notably

375

purified preparation enriched in EPA and DHA are commercially available as dietary supplements, we

376

did not see a correlation between SPMs and the levels of EPA or DHA, indicating that SPMs levels are

377

likely more dependent on biosynthetic enzymes other than phospholipases such as lipoxygenases than

378

EPA or DHA availability. As of today, no resolution pharmacology treatment has been approved by

379

governmental health agencies yet. However, some putative E- and D-series resolvin precursors, notably

380

18-HEPE and 17-HDHA, are available as dietary supplements.

381
382

In addition to cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase derivatives, other bioactive lipids are recognized, at least

383

in mice, to downregulate the immune response. This is notably the case of the endocannabinoids N-

384

arachidonoyl-ethanolamine (AEA) and 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), which are AA-derived lipids

385

(64). The anti-inflammatory effects of AEA and 2-AG are mostly related to the activation of the CB2

386

receptor, which is heavily expressed by leukocytes (65). In addition to 2-AG and AEA, their congeners

387

from the monacyl-glycerols and N-acyl-ethanolamines and N-acyl-aminoacids families, now viewed as

388

the endocannabinoidome, could potentially regulate the inflammatory response during SARS-CoV-2

389

infections, notably by activating other anti-inflammatory receptors (66). It will thus be crucial to decipher

390

whether the endocannabinoidome is modulated during COVID-19 and if a potential target such as CB2

391

receptor agonists, or endocannabinoid hydrolase inhibitors could be helpful in the treatment of COVID-

392

19 or other coronavirus-mediated infections.

393
394

Nonetheless the expanded definition of a dysregulated lipidome we unravel in SARS-CoV-2 infections

395

requiring mechanical ventilation, our study has limitations. 1) BALs from healthy controls are from

396

younger individuals than those from severe COVID-19 patients. This could have an impact on some

397

mediators, notably PGD2 levels, which are increased in aged mice and worsen SARS-CoV infections

398

(67); 2) The procedure to obtain BAL fluids is slightly different between healthy controls and severe

399

COVID-19 patients. Indeed, while the volume of saline injected to healthy people was 50 ml, that of

400

severe COVID-19 patients was 100 ml. The possible outcome of this discrepancy could be and

401

underestimation of lipid levels in one group vs. the other. While some might argue that the first saline

402

bolus contains more lipids than the following one(s), other might argue that lipid levels are consistent in

403

each bolus. Given that, in our hands, the number of BAL cells is usually greater in the first bolus than in

404

the subsequent ones (when multiple boli are utilized), we are confident that the BAL fluid from the first

405

bolus likely contains more lipids than the second one. This would thus lead to a slight underestimation

406

of lipids in the COVID-19 group. 3) Unfortunately, the leukocyte counts in the BALs of severe COVID-

407

19 patients did not include the number of alveolar macrophages and it is thus impossible to determine a

408

clear differential count of leukocytes in those samples. Furthermore, the eosinophil counts were

409

somewhat limited by the apparatus as it could estimate the counts to +/- 105/ml cells, which likely has an

410

impact on the different correlations involving eosinophils, notably with EXE4; 4) We could not compare

411

the levels of lipids in the BALs of severe COVID-19 patients to those found in the blood. This appears

412

important given the limited number of correlations found between BAL lipids and other circulating

413

markers such as CRP and D-dimers. To that end, a recent study indicated differences in some of the

414

herein investigated bioactive lipids in the circulation (68). It will thus be important to pursue our

415

investigations and determine whether there is a transposition of the BAL lipidome to the circulation.

416
417

In conclusion, our data unmask that in addition to the recognized cytokine storm previously documented,

418

lung fluids of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients indicate that a lipid storm also occurs. As highlighted

419

above, the rich library of governmental health agencies-approved lipid modulators might provide

420

beneficial and usually low-cost add-ons to the current therapeutic arsenal utilized to diminish the severity

421

of COVID-19 and possibly additional coronavirus-mediated infections.

Figure 1. Levels of cyclooxygenase-derived metabolites in the BAL fluids of healthy and severe
COVID-19 patients. BALs were obtained and processed as described in Methods. A) Results are from
the BALs from 25 healthy subjects and 33 severe COVID-19 patients. P values were obtained by
performing a Mann-Whitney test: **** = p < 0.0001. B-E) Correlation tests were performed with
COVID-19 patients by using the non-parametric Spearman’s rank. P<0.05 was the threshold of
significance. The linear regression is represented with a solid line and the best-fit lines of 95% confidence
are represented with dotted lines.
