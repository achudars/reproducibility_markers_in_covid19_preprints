Abstract
The COVID-19 epidemic in China has been effectively controlled. It is of great significance
to study the law of cross-regional spread of the epidemic, for the prevention and control of the
COVID-19 in the future in China and other countries or regions. In this study, the
cross-regional connection intensity between cities was characterized based on the probability
and the effective distance of the shortest path tree, and the empirical analysis was carried out
based on the high-frequency data such as the cases of COVID 19 outbreaks. It is concluded
that the higher the intensity of inter-city connection, the larger scale the cross-regional spread
of the epidemic.
Keywords: COVID-19, Effective Distance, Transmission Mechanism

1 Introduction
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan and quickly
spread to other provinces. According to statistics, as of March 25, 2020, a total of 81,285
confirmed cases, 3,287 deaths, and 3,947 confirmed cases have been reported in mainland
China. Among them, a total of 67,801 confirmed cases in Hubei Province (50006 cases in
Wuhan), 3169 death cases (2531 cases in Wuhan), and 3431 confirmed cases (3407 cases in
Wuhan). The cumulative number of confirmed cases in Hubei Province accounted for 83.7%
of mainland China, and the number of deaths accounted for 96.4% of Mainland China, of
which Wuhan accounted for 61.7% and 76.9% of Mainland China respectively. The epidemic

has been contained in China, and there are basically no new cases in the country, or only cases
associated with imported cases abroad in some regions. The focus has been shifted to
preventing imported cases. However, the COVID-19 is still serious in countries outside China.
According to the data reported by the WHO, as of 10:00 Central European Time on the 25th,
there were 332,331 confirmed cases in countries outside China, an increase of 40,611 cases
were reported that day; a total of 15,153 death cases, an increase of 2,198 cases that day.
Among them, 69,176 cases were confirmed in Italy, 51,914 in the United States, 39,673 in
Spain, 31,554 in Germany, and 24,811 in Iran. Therefore, studying prevention and control
measures against the COVID-19 and the effects of it in China has certain reference and
inspiration value for countries outside China.

Looking back at the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic and its prevention and control,
Wuhan was the first to report 27 confirmed cases on December 31, 2019, and to China on
January 22, 554 confirmed cases, including 444 in Hubei Province. The week starting on
January 24 is the traditional Chinese spring festival holiday, which is the period with the
largest turnover of people. In 2019, more than 421 million people were transported by
commercial transportation agencies, including trains, cars, and aviation. This brings
difficulties to COVID-19 prevention and control. On January 23, Wuhan announced the
closure of the city, and the city's urban bus, subway, ferry, and long-distance passenger
transportation were suspended; for no special reason, citizens should not leave Wuhan, and
the leaving-Wuhan corridors in airport and railway station are temporarily closed. On January
23, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Hunan provinces initiated a level I response. On January 25,
all provinces except Qinghai and Tibet initiated a level I response. On January 30, Tibet
province launched a level I response as the last province. This is the highest level of

emergency response adopted in accordance with China's National Emergency Plan for Public
Health Emergencies, which classifies public health emergencies into particularly major (level
I), major (level II), large (level III) and general (level IV) level 4. According to the plan of
level I response, the provincial government is responsible for emergency response, adopts
preventive control measures in time, adopts emergency mobilization and collection of
relevant personnel, materials, vehicles, related facilities, and equipment, adopts isolated sites
and blocks epidemic areas to ensure various supplies needed in emergency response. But
before the "lockdown" of Wuhan, according to statistics, millions of citizens have left Wuhan,
and they may be the main source of the COVID-19 infection in other parts of China.
Therefore, it is of a certain value to analyze the impact of Wuhan's intercity connection with
other regions on the spread of the epidemic and the role of local prevention and control
measures.
Observe the distribution of the COVID-19 confirmed cases in various regions of Hubei
Province and other provinces (cities and districts) in China. The number of cases did not
increase with the proximity of Wuhan, even in Hubei province. Then, an important question is
that the cities have different degrees of economic and personnel links with Wuhan. Does the
link have an internal relationship with the spread of the epidemic? The public health policies
for COVID-19 prevention and control in different regions are not exactly the same, and the
degree of strictness also varies. It is also an important question of how such prevention and
control measures are matched with the degree of spread.

Figure 1 distribution of Cumulative confirmed cases in Hubei province
This study has several strengths. First, based on the theory of infectious diseases, the
theory of complex network system and the characteristics of COVID-19, considering that the
incubation period was still infectious, we propose an epidemic model which describes how
people move between cities and spread disease; Second, the concept of "effective distance",
which is not related to geographical distance, but related to transportation and population size,
is introduced to analyze the effect of effective distance on epidemics and the transmission
mechanism of the COVID-19; Third, big data and data mining technologies are used to
retrieve the database of population migration data, Baidu Index and so on. Fourth, by
applying the methods of descriptive statistics, multivariate analysis, econometrics, and the
mathematical modeling methodology, we verified the effect of prevention and control efforts
on reducing the transmission of COVID-19 among cities.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the literature review of
the mathematical model of the epidemic transmission and how travel can contribute to the
rapid spread of disease; Section 3 introduces a mathematical model of how COVID-9 flows
and spreads disease between different cities; Research and assumption on model constructing
and the meaning of each variable in the study and their sources are introduced in Section 4.
Section 5 shows the empirical analysis result and combs the transmission mechanism of
COVID-19; In the last section, we make a conclusion and discussion of the content and
proposes the direction of future research.

2 Literature Review and Hypothesis
2.1 Literature Review
The epidemic of infectious diseases is a complex spreading process that occurs in
population. There is a long history of modeling infectious disease epidemics (Anderson et al.,
1992), and various modeling paradigms have been developed. Kermark & Mckendrick (1927)
proposed the classic SIR model, which is a compartmental model. Assuming that every
individual is the same, the population is homogeneous mixing. The contact is instant and
independent of history, infection rate and recovery rate are constant. All people in the same
state form a compartment, and as the state changes, personnel move between the
compartments. With the growth of urban population and the development of transportation
networks, social mobility has increased, and the spatial expansion of infectious diseases has

shown a new pattern. Especially when people move between different regions, the spread of
infectious diseases is very common. Understanding the impact of human movement patterns
on the prevalence of infectious diseases has attracted considerable attention (Gonzalez et al.,
2008), and a meta-population model derived from ecology has been applied in the field of
infectious diseases. With the rise of complexity science, the micro-modeling specification has
been developed and combined with social networks, a network-based micro-individual
modeling method has been developed, which provides a new way to understand the spread of
infectious diseases. These models enable epidemiologists and health authorities to understand
the transmission process, predict its impact on healthy populations, and assess the
effectiveness of different mitigation and prevention strategies. Since 2002, the coronaviruses
(CoVs) have emerged as major global health threats, namely severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV; in 2002) that spread to 37 countries, and Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV; in 2012) that spread to 27 countries.
Part of the literature studied the treatment of emerging infectious diseases by medical
staff to reduce or avoid transmissions, such as Kisting et al. (2012), Chea et al. (2014),
Barbisch et al. (2015), Koening (2015) and others. Another part of the literature studied public
health policy issues for infectious diseases. Wilder-Smith (2020) and Huremović (2019)
analyzed and compared the clear definitions and scope of common public health policies,
including isolation, quarantine, social distancing and so on, and other literature such as
Rothstein & Talbott (2007), Wang et al. (2012), Sakaguchi et al. (2012).
After the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, most of the research focused on estimating
the source, transmission characteristics and the estimation of the scale (Mizumoto et al., 2020;
Zhou et al., 2020; Hébert-Dufresne et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2020; Yeo et al.,
2020). In particular, the basic reproduction ratio has been widely debated as a parameter that
reflects the speed of virus transmission. Some literatures analyzed the spread of COVID-19
using population migration data, which are calculated based on the migration outflow from
Wuhan (Zhan et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020), Little
attention has been paid to the spread of the nationwide and even global cities caused by
population migration. There is also a literature on how to intervene and control the spread of
the COVID-19 virus (Qian et al., 2020; Heymann & Shindo, 2020); Gao et al., 2020).
Although there are many articles on the transmission mechanism of infectious diseases,
the research on the law of transmission between regions is still insufficient. Especially with
the development of modern transportation and the increasing scale of inter-regional and even

transnational population movements, it is becoming increasingly difficult to grasp the spread
of infectious diseases across regions.

2.2 Research Hypothesis
The transmission factors of the disease are extremely complicated, and it is closely
related to the physical conditions of the virus carrier, the environment around, the weather,
and the conditions of the contacts. We focus on the influence of spatial connection between
cities on the COVID-19 epidemic. The population flow between cities is a key factor
affecting the scale of inter-city virus transmission. The population flow is related to urban
density and transportation.
Brockmann & Helbing (2013) proposed a new concept of distance, which believes that
the spread of disease is not related to the geographical distance between cities, but is closely
related to the "effective distance" between cities. What is the effective distance? The effective
distance between cities is the length selected by a passenger in various selectable routes from
city i to city j. A passenger can be regarded as a random walking particle, who randomly visits
the surrounding cities according to the traffic flow. After arriving at the next city, it is
converted into a probability to visit the neighboring cities of the next city according to the
traffic flow... Finally, the path which the particle most likely to choose from city i to city j is
namely the most likely path. The length of this most likely path is the effective distance. We
argue that this probabilistic effective distance is related to the flow of population and the
degree of transportation convenience, and can reflect the strength of the spatial connection
between cities. The effective distance varies with the strength of the spatial connection. This
concept is more accurate than traditional connection strength calculations based on the size
and distance of the two cities, such as economic connection, market potential, and market
access; it is also more accurate than simply using the population flow to characterize the
connection, because it cannot express the strength of the connection between the two cities,
not to mention the convenience of the connection between the two cities.
With probabilistic effective distances instead of conventional geographic distances,
complex spatiotemporal patterns can be simplified into uniform wave transmission patterns.
The effective distance is defined as the best path of transportation in the two cities, which
depends on the Probabilistic traffic flow.

pmn is the conditional probability from node n to destination m is

The shorter the effective distance, the greater the probability that the epidemic will
spread to the area, then the greater the possibility of increasing the number of imported cases,
and the earlier the large-scale epidemic will outbreak (Brockmann & Helbing, 2013). Because
healthy individuals are constantly exposed to possible sources of pollution, as long as the lack
of protective equipment and effective isolation, they face a serious risk of cross-infection. The
reproduction ratio(R0) refers to the average number of secondary infections induced by
typical infected individuals in a fully susceptible population. The size of R0 depends on
individual contact rate, disease transmission rate, and duration of infection. An increase in R0
can lead to the outbreak of COVID -19 (Read et al., 2020). Based on the classic transmission
model and the effective distance of Brockmann & Helbing (2013), the mechanism of
epidemic spread and control is shown in Figure 2.
Based on such understanding of the transmission mechanism, the hypothesis is put
forward as follows: the smaller the effective distance, the earlier the outbreak, and the more
infectious cases there are in the region.

3.1 Empirical Model and Variable Descriptions
According to the above mechanism, the empirical model is constructed as follows:

casesit = 1dit + 2 ln_ cgdpit + 3 ln_ searchit + 4 ln_ M i + 5 PCit +  it + it
where casesit is city i' s multi-source datasets including cumulative number of confirmed,
death, recovered and suspected cases at time t; City i' s effective distance dit at time t as an
main explanatory variable, 1 is the estimated coefficient of dit ; if 1  0 , effective distance

dit and casesit coefficient are significant negative correlation; ln_ cgdpit , ln_ searchit ,
ln_ M i and PCit are control variables at city level, is respectively per capita GDP, Search
Index, medical resources(including the number of health institutions, the number of beds per
thousand people and the number of health technicians), and prevention and control intensity;  it

is the time-city fixed effects.

3.2 Data Sources
There are five kinds of data sources:
(1) Human Migration Big Data1. Reflects scale of emigration and immigration population.
Under the background of obtaining big data of Human Migration based on geographic
location service, we can accurately analyze the destination, specific flow and impact on the
epidemic of large-scale Human Migration. Baidu migration data calculates and analyzes the
number of intelligent end-users whose positions have changed in 8 hours by comparing the
changes of users' positions, covering all kinds of transportation vehicles such as railway,
highway and aviation. The daily numbers of domestic passengers were obtained from the
location-based services database of Human Migration Data from Jan.1st, 2020 to Feb.18th,
2020, see http://qianxi.baidu.com/ (in Chinese).
(2) Baidu Search Index. Baidu Search Index will reflect a keyword search volume, and with
the keyword related to “pneumonia”, “syndromes”, “mask”, “COVID-19” and “travel
restriction” will also appear in our search index. The search index can be used to judge the
The urban administrative division is adopted for the urban migration boundary, including the districts, counties,
townships and villages under the jurisdiction of the city.

self-consciousness of citizens and explore their behavior trends.
Based on the official website of health commission of Hubei Province (wjw.hubei.gov.cn), we
obtained the trend of pneumonia epidemic with novel coronavirus infection over time in
Hubei Province.
(3) The history epidemic date and the trend of pneumonia epidemic with COVID-19 infection
are obtained from the official Health Commission. According to regional health policy and
measures of disease control and prevention, we evaluate the prevention and control
intensity of cities by scoring mechanism. The earlier the policy is issued, the more strict the
policy is, the more extensive the monitoring is, and the higher the score is.

national economic and social development of the city. GDP, population, per capita GDP1, the
number of health institutions, the number of beds per thousand people and the number of
health technicians are obtained from bureau of statistics2. If there is no data, the preliminary
accounting data released by the provincial (city) bureau of statistics will replace it3.

3.3 Calculation of Main Variables
3.3.1 Population Migration
Proportion of emigration from other cites: the ratio of emigration from one cites in the
overall emigration form all the other cities.
Proportion of immigration to other cites：the ratio of immigration to one cites in the
overall emigration to all the other cites.
According to the proportion of emigration from Wuhan since January 1, 2020, it is found
that most of the emigration population enters Hubei Province, Hunan Province, Jiangxi
Province, Henan Province and Anhui Province. After cutting off the transmission of the virus,
the proportion of moving out of Wuhan has decreased significantly. According to the
migration big data of Baidu map, the cities with the largest emigration population before New
Year's Eve in 2020 are the Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta and Chengdu-Chongqing
urban agglomerations. Shenzhen, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Chengdu are the top five
cities with the largest emigration population. In addition, Dongguan, Zhengzhou, Hangzhou,

Xi'an and other cities are also cities with a large outflow of people before the Spring Festival.
Recently, the work resumption was promoted orderly, and the number of people coming to the
other places has increased gradually. The top five cities were Shanghai (4.58%), Shenzhen
(3.73%), Chengdu (3.64%), Guangzhou (3.56%) and Beijing (3.06%). With the further
migration return, central cities such as Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Chengdu,
Chongqing and Beijing will face obvious pressure of prevention and control, and measures
must be taken in advance to response to the large-scale migration.

3.3.2 Effective Distance
Let Pmn is the fraction of travelers that leave node n and arrive at node m, the effective
distance d nm from a node n to a connected node m is 1− log Pmn , which is generally
asymmetric d mn  d nm .

On the basis of effective distance, we can define the directed length  () of an ordered
path  = {n1 ,, nL } as the sum of effective lengths along the path. Moreover, we define the
effective distance

Dmn from an arbitrary reference node n to another node m in the network

by the length of the shortest path from n to m:

Dmn = min  ()


and

Dmn  Dnm . From the

perspective of a chosen origin node n, the set of shortest paths to all other nodes constitutes a
shortest path tree (Brockmann & Helbing, 2013).
Figure 4 shows the effective distance calculated according to the proportion of the
population flow from Wuhan to other places. We can see that the cities with the shortest
effective distance are all in Hubei province.

We establish an evaluation system for the intensity of epidemic prevention and control,
including: launching level 1 response, stop of inter-city passenger transportation, stop of
ordinary public transportation in the city, stop of part of public places in the city, closed
management of residential areas, centralized isolation of returnees from the key epidemic
areas (Hubei) for 14 days, centralized isolation of returnees from non-key epidemic areas for
14 days, prohibition of local personnel to go out, centralized isolation of close contact of

We will explore the relationship between effective distance from Wuhan and the number
of COVID-19 cases confirmed in different cities. As shown in Figure 6(b), the correlation
between the proportion of the outflow of people from Wuhan and the number of cases
is not significant on the whole. We analyze that there are two reasons cause the result: First,
he incubation period of COVID-19 is long, the patients only have mild symptoms, such as
fever, fatigue and cough. The paper titled " Time-varying transmission dynamics of Novel
Coronavirus Pneumonia in China " published in the international medical authoritative
journal "the New England Journal of Medicine" revealed that the average incubation period of
new coronary pneumonia is 5.2 days (Li et al., 2020); Second is that the first cases reported in
most cities are after January 20. Although the number of cases was not previously reported,
the possibility of an earlier infection cannot be ruled out. It is estimated that the outbreak
started much earlier, and both within China and international infectious exports occurred
before January and in early January. Based on the analysis above, this paper considers the

incubation period, and replaces the actual time of infection with the time of cases confirmed,
and obtains the relationship between the flow of people out of the Wuhan and the number of
pneumonia cases in the other cities, as shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6. (a) shows the relationship between the effective distance and emigration; (b) shows
the relationship between the cases and emigration in a scatter plot without considering the
incubation period; (c) and (d) shows the fitting results considering the impact factor of the
incubation period.

From the data and figures above, we can see that if we take the incubation period into
consideration, the cumulative confirmed cases are significantly related to the outflow of
people from Wuhan, and the effect of effective distance on the new confirmed cases is
significantly negative.

Table 2 reports the benchmark regression results of the effect of effective distance on the
number of new cases, in which control variables, time and city fixed effect is added, and the
regression coefficient of effective distance is negative significantly, which shows that when
other conditions are constant, the shorter the effective distance, the more the cumulative
number of confirmed cases, the number of confirmed cases per thousand, cases of deaths, the
cases deaths per thousand, and the number of newly confirmed cases per thousand there are. It
is worth noting that the greater the intensity of urban epidemic prevention and control, the
fewer new confirmed cases, indicating the effectiveness and necessity of various prevention
and control measures. The more health institutions there are, the fewer cases there are. In the
model, some urban characteristic factors, including per capita GDP, beds and health
technicians per thousand have a negative impact on the number of new cases, indicating the
rationality of the model. In the model, per capita GDP has a negative impact on the number of
new cases, indicating that the higher the GDP in a region is, the more the population flow is,
and the higher the number of new cases is. The search index has a significant negative impact
on the number of outbreaks, indicating that the more severe the outbreak, the higher the
awareness of how to protect.

4.2 Robustness
In this paper, a variety of methods are used to test the robustness of the benchmark
regression conclusion, shown in Table 3.
(1) Using multi-source datasets including cumulative number of reported, death, quarantined
and suspected cases, cure rate for confirmed cases, mortality rate for confirmed cases as the
explanatory variable, the result is also robust.
(2) PPML method. Silva & tennero (2006) pointed out that if there is an option of
heteroscedasticity or zero value (due to the fact that the number of initial case in many cities
is zero), Poisson maximum likelihood model (PPML) should be used to test the robustness.
(3) The effective distance is replaced by the absolute number of people moving out of Wuhan.
the explained variable. After replacing explanatory variable, the regression result is also
robust.
（4）Different Sample time selection. The sample period of standard regression is from
January 1st, 2020 to February 18th, 2020. However, there are still many events that may have
a significant impact on the number of cases during the sample period, such as the Spring
Festival and lockdown of the city. In order to test whether the choice of time period has an
impact on the regression results, further regression is carried out according to the sub-samples
before and after Wuhan has been locked down. In each sub-sample , the effect of effective
distance on the number of new confirmed cases is always negative, which implies that results
are robust.

4.3 Endogeneity Test
The incubation period of the novel coronavirus is the main source of endogeneity. In this
paper, we use the lag of effective distance as an instrument variable to address the
endogeneity, which is shown in table 4.

5 Conclusions and implications
In this article, by introducing the effective distance to reflect the strength of the

connection between cities and constructing an empirical model. it is concluded that: (1) the
scale of local COVID-19 epidemic is closely related to the effective distance, that is, the
strength of the connection between the two cities. The shorter the effective distance, the more
newly confirmed cases and the more severe the local epidemic; (2) The greater the prevention
and control efforts of urban epidemic, the more health institutions, the fewer cases there are;
(3) The regions with higher per capita GDP have more population flow and more cases of
epidemic cases; The more severe the outbreak, the higher the awareness of how to protect.
According to the conclusions above, there are the following implications:
First, strengthen cross-regional epidemic prevention and control linkages to achieve joint
prevention and control between regions. The smaller the effective distance, the more
convenient the connection between the two cities, the larger the scale of population flow, so
the easier the epidemic will spread across regions, the more important it is for cross-regional
cooperation to prevent and control the epidemic. In the future epidemic prevention and
control, it’s necessary to establish cross-region epidemic information sharing, prevention and
control measures linkage, and medical resources collaboration.
Second, strengthen comprehensive measures for comprehensive prevention and control
of the epidemic.
The large investment in prevention and control which has a large impact on the economy
and society can control the epidemic in a short time and shorten the time of the impact of the
epidemic on the economy and society. This requires comprehensive measures. On the one
hand, the government, society, and residents should make concerted efforts to jointly control,
accelerating the speed of epidemic control; on the other hand, we must strengthen the
multi-faceted reserves of materials needed for epidemic prevention and control.
the government, society, and residents jointly control and control, and work together to
accelerate the speed of epidemic control; On the other hand, it is necessary to strengthen the
multi-faceted stock of materials needed for epidemic prevention and control, so that
comprehensive measures can be taken when the epidemic occurs
Third, investment in public health resources should be strengthened. The more
developed the city is, the easier it is for people to contact, and the larger the scale of
population flow, the easier it is for the epidemic to spread. Therefore, the more developed the
economy, the more it is necessary to increase investment in public health resources.
