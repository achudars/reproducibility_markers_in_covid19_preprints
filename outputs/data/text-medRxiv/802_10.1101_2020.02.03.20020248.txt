diagnosed outside China indicates that a substantial number of cases are underdiagnosed

26

(Nishiura et al., 2020a). Estimation of the asymptomatic ratio—the percentage of carriers

27

with no symptoms—will improve understanding of COVID-19 transmission and the

28

spectrum of disease it causes, providing insight into epidemic spread. Although the

29

asymptomatic ratio is conventionally estimated using seroepidemiological data (Carrat et

30

al., 2008; Hsieh et al., 2014), collection of these data requires significant logistical effort,

31

time, and cost. Instead, we propose to estimate the asymptomatic ratio by using

32

information on Japanese nationals that evacuated from Wuhan, China on chartered

33

flights.

34

Figure 1 illustrates the flow of the evacuation process. By 6 February 2020 a

35

total of N=565 citizens were evacuated. Among them, pN=63 (11.2%) were considered

36

symptomatic upon arrival based on (1) temperature screening before disembarkation,

37

and (2) face-to-face interviews eliciting information on symptoms including fever,

38

cough, and other non-specific symptoms consistent with COVID-19. All passengers

39

additionally undertook reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)

40

testing, and m=5 asymptomatic and n=7 symptomatic passengers tested positive for

41

2019-nCoV.

42

Employing a Bayes theorem, the asymptomatic ratio is defined as
Prasymptomatic | infection 

Prinfection | asymptomatic Pr asymptomatic
,
Pr infection

43

which can be calculated as m/(n+m), as seen in Figure 1. The asymptomatic ratio is thus

44

estimated at 41.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 16.7%, 66.7%) among evacuees.

45

Because fourteen days have elapsed since their departure from Wuhan—longer than the

46

95th percentile estimate of the COVID-19 incubation period (Li et al., 2020; Linton et

47

al., 2020)—there is very little probability that the five virus-positive asymptomatic

48

individuals will develop symptoms. Should one of the five becomes symptomatic in the

49

future, the overall asymptomatic ratio would decrease to 33.3% (95% CI: 8.3%, 58.3%).

50

In general, asymptomatic infections cannot be recognized if they are not

51

confirmed by RT-PCR or other laboratory testing, and symptomatic cases may not be

52

detected if they do not seek medical attention (Nishiura et al., 2020b). Estimates such as

53

this therefore provide important insight by using a targeted population to assess

54

prevalence of asymptomatic viral shedding (Kupferschmidt & Cohen, 2020). Despite a

55

small sample size, our estimation indicates that perhaps nearly a half of

56

COVID-19-infected individuals are asymptomatic. This ratio is slightly smaller than

57

that of influenza, which was estimated at 56–80% (Hsieh et al., 2014) using similar

58

definitions for symptomatic individuals. There is great need for further studies on the

59

prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections to guide epidemic control efforts.
