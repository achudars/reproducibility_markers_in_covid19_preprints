Abstract: Infectious disease surveillance is vitally important to maintaining health security, but
these efforts are challenged by the pace at which new pathogens emerge. Wastewater
surveillance can rapidly obtain population-level estimates of disease transmission, and we
leverage freedom from disease principles to make use of non-detection of SARS-CoV-2 in
wastewater to estimate the probability that a community is free from SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
From wastewater surveillance of 24 treatment plants across upstate New York beginning in May
2020, we observed a reliable limit of detection of 0.3--0.5 cases per 10,000 population. No
COVID-19 cases were reported 40% of the time following a non-detection of SARS-CoV-2 in
wastewater, and cases were less than 1 daily case per 10,000 population 97% of the time
following non-detection. Trends in the intensity of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater correlate with
trends in COVID-19 incidence and test positivity (⍴>0.5), with the greatest correlation observed
for active cases and a three-day lead time between wastewater sample date and clinical test date.
Wastewater surveillance can cost-effectively demonstrate the geographic extent of the
transmission of emerging pathogens, confirming that transmission is absent or under control and
alerting of an increase in transmission. If a statewide wastewater surveillance platform had been
in place prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, policymakers would have been able to
complement the representative nature of wastewater samples to individual testing, likely
resulting in more precise public health interventions and policies.
Main Text:
Infectious disease surveillance, or monitoring trends in the transmission of communicable
diseases, is an important pillar of public health and is fundamental to the health security of a
population.1–3 Infectious disease surveillance systems are typically event-based, designed to
measure abnormal increases in either identified cases of a laboratory-diagnosed pathogen or

identified cases where individuals display a set of signs and symptoms (syndromic surveillance).4
Although infectious disease surveillance is necessary to identify and control disease outbreaks,5
novel pathogens are incredibly difficult to incorporate into existing event-based surveillance
networks. For example, by the time that sudden acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
was first noticed via an increase of unexplainable cases of pneumonia,6 the pathogen had spread
widely through the community in Wuhan, China. Subsequently an event-based surveillance
approach was not a readily feasible strategy to confirm that connected communities were free
from SARS-CoV-2 transmission as the pathogen spread across the globe. Despite heroic efforts
to scale COVID-19 diagnostics as quickly as possible, the virus spread more rapidly, exceeding
testing capacity early in the pandemic. Without an operational event-based surveillance strategy
based upon virus diagnostics, officials in the US and elsewhere had to rely on syndromic
surveillance as SARS-CoV-2 spread--basing public health interventions on increases in
hospitalizations and deaths. Since timely, geographically granular information regarding
transmission was not available, public health officials were left with few management options,
other than to call for a halt to non-essential businesses and gatherings. This type of broad,
country-wide reaction highlights an inadequate infectious disease surveillance system that could
not provide reliable information on where SARS-CoV-2 transmission was, and more importantly,
where transmission was not occurring.7 Such information, especially regarding communities that
were actually free from transmission at the time, would have allowed for local decision making
and precise interventions in response to the arrival of SARS-CoV-2 into the community.8,9
Instead, the unknown spread of the virus forced statewide decisions, similar to many states
across the country, ending in-person schooling and shuttering non-essential businesses
statewide.10
Wastewater surveillance addresses challenges and limitations of event-based surveillance
systems by assessing infectious disease transmission potential within the entire population served
by a sewage system. A single sample conveys information independent of individuals’
symptoms, health-seeking behavior, or the health system’s availability of diagnostic testing.11
The genetic material from SARS-CoV-2 (as with many infectious pathogens) is shed in human
feces and urine.12–14 Finding that genetic material in wastewater can serve as an early indication
of a pathogen in a community, as demonstrated in the Netherlands, Paris, Connecticut, and
elsewhere.15–18 Perhaps more importantly, absence of genetic material in the wastewater can give
confidence that a community is free from transmission of that pathogen. Tracking infectious
disease transmission through wastewater is not a novel approach - it goes back more than 100
years19–21 and saw broadscale application in the later 1900’s to identify outbreaks of polio.22
Wastewater surveillance in some cases even allowed for vaccine campaigns to control
community polio outbreaks before any polio-caused paralysis occurred.23,24 Beginning in May of
2020, we analyzed wastewater from 76 sewer sheds and 24 wastewater treatment plants in 14
counties throughout upstate New York (Supplemental Fig. 1). Here we compare levels of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA found in the wastewater to measures of SARS-CoV-2 transmission as
reported by the New York State Department of Health. Using freedom from disease principles,25

we then assessed the ability of wastewater surveillance to confirm that SARS-CoV-2
transmission was either under control or absent. By comparing spikes in SARS-CoV-2 as
measured in wastewater to spikes in event-based surveillance measures of SARS-CoV-2
transmission we determined whether wastewater surveillance provided early warning of
localized outbreaks in three communities. Finally, we estimated the cost of a statewide
wastewater surveillance platform for NY State. Together, these analyses provide compelling
evidence that a wastewater surveillance network would be a cost-effective system to increase
health security.
Leveraging wastewater surveillance data to confirm freedom from disease. We can
leverage negative results from wastewater surveillance to establish the probability that
SARS-CoV-2 transmission is below a measurable and manageable threshold using principles of
freedom from disease surveillance developed by veterinary scientists.25 Each non-detection of
SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater carries one of two possibilities (Fig. 1). Either SARS-CoV-2 is
absent from the population or the wastewater test was unable to detect SARS-CoV-2. The ability
of wastewater to detect SARS-CoV-2, or the sensitivity of the wastewater surveillance approach
in this context, is a function of the method’s limits of detection, the population size of the
sewershed, dilution of human waste with precipitation and graywater, and the proportion of the
population in the sewershed with sewer connections. Using our novel ultracentrifugation
method,26 we observed detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from a 24-hour composite sample of
wastewater to be between 0.3--0.5 daily cases per 10,000 people or 0.5--1% test positivity (all
connected to sewers) one day following the wastewater sample (Fig. 2). At that time, 40% of the
472 sewershed time points with non-detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA had zero incident cases,
and 96% had fewer than one daily case per 10,000 population (Fig. 2). Sewersheds where there
were COVID-19 cases reported but no detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater were, on
average, five times more populous than sewersheds where SARS-CoV-2 RNA went undetected
and no COVID-19 case was reported. The number of diagnostic tests conducted in these more
populous sewersheds was slightly higher (a median of 12 compared to 9 per 1,000 population).
By combining negative results (SARS-CoV-2 RNA undetected) over time from
wastewater surveillance, we can estimate the probability that a community is free from
coronavirus transmission, or at least that transmission is extremely low (less than 1 incident case
per 10,000 population). Importantly, non-detections in larger sewersheds result in less confidence
than smaller sewersheds. Among the sewersheds in our study, the potential sensitivity of a single
non-detected sample ranged from 0.008 in the largest sewershed to 0.40 in smaller sewersheds
for absence of infection and 0.02 to 0.97 for extremely low transmission (< 1 daily case per
10,000 population). Repeated wastewater samples where SARS-CoV-2 RNA is repeatedly
undetected indicate an increased probability that the upstream community is either free from
SARS-CoV-2 transmission or has it under control. This occurred in Cayuga and Cortland
counties during the summer of 2020 (Supplemental Figure 2). While individuals in these
counties were still at risk of contracting COVID-19 at this time, risk was more dependent on
interaction with people outside the community (including recently returned travelers) than

interaction with people inside the community. These findings would thus have allowed for social
distancing interventions to be more precisely applied.

Figure 1: Each time wastewater is tested and SARS-CoV-2 is not detected (A), either the system
did not detect the SARS-CoV-2 that was in the community (B) or there was no SARS-CoV-2 in the
community (C). The probability of each non-detection representing no SARS-CoV-2 in the
community is dependent upon the sensitivity of wastewater surveillance (1), the population size
of the community (2), the dilution of human waste with gray water (3), the load shedding
dynamics of the pathogen (4), and the sewer system (5). Whereas each non-detection may only
give a low probability that SARS-CoV-2 is absent, repeatedly not detecting SARS-CoV-2
increases the confidence that SARS-CoV-2 is absent using the simple equation of
1-(1-sensitivity)n where n represents the number of consecutive non-detections. This process is
similar to repeatedly tossing a coin and repeatedly getting heads - each individual coin toss
maintains a specific probability but the probability of obtaining a string of repeated consecutive
results is increasingly lower with each toss.

Wastewater surveillance provides early indication of increasing transmission. In the
fall of 2020, three upstate New York communities monitoring coronavirus in their wastewater
reported COVID-19 outbreaks following the return of college students to campus: Cortland,
Oneonta, and Oswego. Prior to the beginning of the semester, in late August 2020, SARS-CoV-2
transmission was stable and low with an average daily incidence between July 1, 2020 and
August 15, 2020 of less than 0.2 reported COVID-19 cases per 10,000 population. Reported
COVID-19 cases increased sharply, beginning August 31 in Oneonta and September 10 in both
Cortland and Oswego (Supplemental Fig 4). Following a long period of non-detection,
SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Cortland wastewater samples was first detected on September 1 and
increased to quantifiable levels on September 8 with a continued increase in quantifiable levels
thereafter. Following a period of variable detection, but below the level of quantification,
SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Oswego wastewater samples was first quantifiable on September 2, with
increasing levels thereafter. In Oneonta, quantifiable levels were first observed September 1 and
increased thereafter. Together these signals provided about a week’s warning of the three
outbreaks observed (Supplemental Fig 4).
Discussion. The primary public health benefit of wastewater surveillance resides in
confirming that a community is safe from a pathogen, both through increased confidence in the
absence of transmission and the early warning of a pathogen’s presence in a community. As a
pathogen threatens a community, and particularly when human diagnostics are limited, this
benefit is invaluable. These primary benefits associated with wastewater surveillance are
dependent upon methodological limits of detection. In line with reports from Australia, 27 we
observed inaccuracy 60% of the time, that being when there is a mismatch between
non-detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and reported COVID-19 cases in a sewershed. Despite what
may appear to be a high rate of inaccuracy, 40% sensitivity in these types of surveillance systems
is quite good, as is 96% sensitivity in a surveillance system to confirm that transmission is below
1 daily case per 10,000 population. To put these sensitivity estimates in context, in March of
2020 the health system was only about 10% sensitive to COVID-19 cases since as many as 90%
of cases of COVID-19 in New York went undiagnosed. 28 Additionally, wastewater surveillance is
unaffected by health access disparities that lead to underreporting in vulnerable communities.29
We observed the highest correlation between levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater
and health system measures of transmission with a 3-day lead time, similar to Peccia et al.16
Further, we saw greater correlation between active cases and wastewater than we observed with
incident cases, suggesting that modelers should take post-infection shedding into account.
Wastewater surveillance will not capture all infections in a community, particularly in
very large communities (> 50,000 population) and communities with a high proportion of houses
that are not connected to the sewer. Fortunately for public health, single infections are less
concerning than population-level trends (i.e. spread). With COVID-19 and many other infectious
diseases, a majority of infections are dead-end transmission.30,31 Communities where houses are
not connected to sewers would be inherently excluded from a wastewater surveillance program,
but we would expect a pathogen to spread between both non-sewered and sewered households.

Furthermore, when caseloads are low (daily cases < 1 per 10,000 population) the test, trace,
isolate paradigm should be sufficient for population control.32,33 Rather than needing to find
every instance of a single COVID-19 case in a community, the public and policy makers need to
know when a pathogen first arrives in a community and when transmission is increasing beyond
chains of known transmission to a state of community spread.
New York State’s health security was breached in 2020 with the undetected arrival and
subsequent spread of SARS-CoV-2. The pandemic required broadscale closure of schools,
businesses, and general social movement to “flatten the curve” in order to mitigate the surge in
hospitalizations and death.34 The only reliable understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the
time of intervention came via hospitalizations that were threatening to overwhelm and in some
cases did overwhelm the health system. Interventions were implemented due to the potential of
what could happen statewide rather than what was actually happening locally. Having a
wastewater surveillance system in the face of such a public health emergency would have
provided a more complete understanding of the geographic extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission
and resulting public health interventions could have been more precise and perhaps shorter. From
our findings, wastewater surveillance as applied in upstate New York exceeds the need in this
regard and should be considered an important aspect of a community’s health security.

Wastewater testing. Participating wastewater treatment plants, or Arcadis during the
New York State pilot, sent a 24-hour composite of 250mL untreated wastewater to Quadrant
Biosciences either weekly, twice weekly, or three times weekly depending upon services
contracted. Quadrant Biosciences purified and quantified SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid levels
contained in wastewater samples by using the ultracentrifugation through sucrose cushion
(UltraSucrose) technique followed by qRT-PCR as detailed elsewhere.26 Briefly, wastewater was
added to a centrifuge tube before adding sucrose solution under the wastewater creating two
distinct layers. After ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was removed and the pellet containing
nucleic acids was resuspended. Total nucleic acids were extracted from eluted pellets and used
immediately as the template for quantification of SARS-CoV-2 and crAssphage DNA and
crAssphage RNA.The following equation was used to normalize SARS-CoV-2 quantities to the
level of fecal material in each sample as indicated by crAssphage DNA concentrations:
log10(SARS-CoV-2):log10(crAssphage DNA).
COVID-19 case data. COVID-19 case data was pulled from the Electronic clinical
Laboratory Reporting System (ECLRS). Every licensed professional authorized by the
Department of Health Physician Office Laboratory Evaluation Program to administer a test for
COVID-19 or influenza is required to report such results immediately (not more than 3 hours) to
the Department of Health through ECLRS when a result is received.10,35 COVID-19 cases and
tests were retrieved from the New York State ECLRS, addresses were matched with tax parcel
data to determine whether the household was connected to public sewer, and then geocoded to
sewershed geographies before aggregation into daily numbers. Test positivity was defined as the
number of COVID-19 cases divided by the number of COVID-19 tests conducted. The number
of active cases was estimated as each COVID-19 case lasting 10 days from diagnosis. We
utilized seven-day averages for test positivity and incidence, but not for active cases. We
estimated simple Pearson correlations between levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and
measures of incidence, active cases, and test positivity.
Sewershed population estimates. We calculated estimates for the 2020 population
within each sewershed using R statistical software version 4.0.0.36 We first estimated the 2010
population for each sewershed using an overlay of 2010 US census blocks on top of the
sewershed boundaries. We calculated the proportion of the area for partial block overlap and then
assigned a proportional 2010 decennial population of the block to the sewershed assuming equal
distribution of the population in the blocks. We then aggregated the apportioned values to get a
total population estimate for the sewershed. We repeated this procedure using 2010 decennial

population data for the block group and 2018 American Community Survey (ACS) data for the
block group to get 2010 and 2018 population by sewershed based on block groups. We used
these values to estimate the rate of population change per sewershed using equation 1. We then
applied this average annual change to the sewershed population based on the block data from
2010 and estimated the population after ten years of growth using equation 2 to calculate 2020
population estimates. The “tidycensus” R package provided population estimates37 and the
“tigris” package provided geometry data.38

Freedom from transmission estimates. In order to estimate the limits of detection of
wastewater surveillance we first categorized wastewater results into not detected, detected but
below the limits of quantification, and quantifiable. We then examined the reported cases and test
positivity in the sewershed as a function of each of these categories. We calculated sensitivity to
confirm absence of transmission as the proportion of sewersheds reporting < 1 daily incident
COVID-19 case per 10,000 population at the time of the wastewater sample. Following the
calculated limits of detection we estimated the sensitivity of the wastewater surveillance platform
to detect SARS-CoV-2 transmission as a function of the calculated limits of detection, a
correction factor for the population size of the sewershed, and the proportion of houses within
the sewershed who are connected to the sewer system using equations 3 and 4. The population
correction factor in these equations refers to how much larger the sewershed population is than
10,000 population, being one if smaller than 10,000 and otherwise the value of the sewershed
population divided by 10,000.
