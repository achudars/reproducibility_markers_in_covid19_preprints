Abstract

22

Memory T cells contribute to rapid viral clearance during re-infection, but the longevity and

23

differentiation of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells remain unclear. We conducted direct

24

ex vivo assays to evaluate SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in COVID-19

25

convalescents up to 254 days post-symptom onset (DPSO). Here, we report that memory T

26

cell responses were maintained during the study period. In particular, we observed

27

sustained polyfunctionality and proliferation capacity of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells. Among

28

SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells detected by activation-induced markers, the

29

proportion of stem cell-like memory T (TSCM) cells increased, peaking at approximately 120

30

DPSO. Development of TSCM cells was confirmed by SARS-CoV-2-specific MHC-I multimer

31

staining. Considering the self-renewal capacity and multipotency of TSCM cells, our data

32

suggest that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are long-lasting after recovery from COVID-19. The

33

current study provides insight for establishing an effective vaccination program and

34

epidemiological measurement.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causes

37

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an ongoing pandemic disease that threatens public

38

health1. As of January 17, 2021, more than 93.2 million confirmed cases had been reported,

39

and over 2 million deaths worldwide2. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, some patients,

40

particularly elderly patients, develop severe COVID-19 that is associated with hyper-

41

inflammatory responses3,4. Global efforts are underway to prevent the transmission of SARS-

42

CoV-2 and to develop novel vaccines and therapeutic strategies. A thorough understanding

43

of the immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to control the COVID-19

44

pandemic.

45

Increasing evidence has demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cell

46

responses are elicited after recovery from COVID-19. A number of studies have reported

47

SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cell responses in the early convalescent phase of COVID-195-9.

48

SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have been detected in 100% and ~70% of

49

convalescent individuals a short time after resolution5. Recently, memory T cells were shown

50

to contribute to protection against SARS-CoV-2 re-challenge in a rhesus macaque model10.

51

Considering that T cell responses to SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome

52

coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are long-lasting, up to >17 years6,11-13, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory

53

T cells are expected to be maintained long-term and to contribute to rapid viral clearance

54

during re-infection. A very recent study has examined SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses

55

up to 8 months after infection using activation-induced marker (AIM) assays14.

56

Following natural infection or vaccination, the generation of effective and persistent

57

T cell memory is essential for long-term protective immunity to the virus. Among diverse

58

memory T cell subsets, stem cell-like memory T (TSCM) cells were recently reported to have

59

the capacity for self-renewal and multipotency to repopulate the broad spectrum of

60

memory and effector T cell subsets15,16. Thus, the successful generation of TSCM cells is

61

required for long-term protective T cell immunity16. For example, long-lived memory T cells

62

following vaccination with live-attenuated yellow fever virus (YFV) exhibit stem cell-like

63

properties and mediate lifelong protection17,18. However, limited knowledge is available on

64

the differentiation of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells following recovery from COVID-19,

65

particularly the generation of TSCM cells.

66

In the present study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific

67

CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from

68

individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection over 8 months post-infection. Using diverse T cell

69

assays, we found that SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cell responses were maintained 8

70

months after the infection. In addition, we analyzed the differentiation of SARS-CoV-2-

71

specific memory T cells during the study period and revealed the successful generation of

72

TSCM cells. We also assessed the effector functions and proliferation capacity of long-term

73

memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

Results

75

Study cohort

76

We recruited 94 individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The peak disease severity

77

was evaluated according to the NIH severity of illness categories19: asymptomatic (n=6), mild

78

(n=44), moderate (n=23), severe (n=13), and critical (n=8). Whole blood samples were

79

obtained longitudinally (2-4 time points) from 38 patients or at a single time point from 56

80

patients. Whole blood was collected 1 to 254 days post-symptom onset (DPSO). Finally, a

81

total of 160 PBMC samples were analyzed. Among 160 PBMC samples, 33 samples were

82

obtained in the acute phase when viral RNA was still detected (1 - 33 DPSO), and 127

83

samples were obtained in the convalescent phase after the negative conversion of viral RNA

84

(31 - 254 DPSO). In the current study, we defined the acute phase as 1 - 30 DPSO, and the

85

convalescent phase as 31 - 254 DPSO. The demographic and clinical characteristics of

86

enrolled patients are presented in Supplementary Table 1.

87
88
89

SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses are sustained 8 months after the infection
First, we performed direct ex vivo interferon-γ (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot

90

(ELISpot) assays following stimulation of PBMCs with overlapping peptide (OLP) pools

91

spanning the spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2. S-, M-,

92

and N-specific IFN- spot numbers increased during the acute phase. Subsequently, there

93

was a decreasing tendency until 60 - 120 DPSO, and the IFN- responses were maintained

94

over 8 months (Fig. 1a). These kinetics were also observed when S-, M-, and N-specific IFN-

95

spot numbers were summed (Fig. 1a). In each PBMC sample, all three OLP pools evenly

96

contributed to the IFN- responses without antigen dominance (Fig. 1b). We divided

97

convalescent samples into three groups based on the DPSO at sample collection: T1 (31 - 99

98

DPSO), T2 (100 - 199 DPSO), and T3 (200 - 254 DPSO). We found no significant difference in

99

IFN- spot numbers among groups (Fig. 1c), and an even contribution of antigens for the IFN-

100

 response was maintained among groups (Extended Data Fig. 1). Next, we focused on

101

longitudinally tracked samples from 30 individuals in the convalescent phase. S-, M-, and N-

102

specific and summed IFN- spot numbers were stable during the convalescent phase (Fig.

103

1d). When we compared paired samples from the same patient at two time points (t1, 31 -

104

100 DPSO; t2, 200 - 254 DPSO), we found no significant difference in IFN-γ spot numbers

106

(Fig. 1e).
We also evaluated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses by AIM assays5,20,21 following

107

stimulation of PBMCs with OLP pools of S, M, and N. CD137+OX40+ cells were considered

108

SARS-CoV-2-specific cells among CD4+ T cells, and CD137+CD69+ cells were considered SARS-

109

CoV-2-specific cells among CD8+ T cells5 (Fig. 2a, b). We confirmed a strong positive

110

correlation between the frequency of CD137+OX40+ cells and the frequencies of alternative

111

AIM+ cells (OX40+CD154+ or CD137+CD154+ cells) among CD4+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 2).

112

The frequency of S-, M-, and N-specific CD137+OX40+ cells among CD4+ T cells increased

113

during the acute phase, decreased until 60 DPSO, and then was maintained over 8 months

114

(Fig. 2c). When the frequency of S-, M-, and N-specific CD137+OX40+ cells was summed,

115

similar kinetics were observed (Fig. 2c). The frequency of CD137+CD69+ cells among CD8+ T

116

cells was relatively low compared to the frequency of CD137+OX40+ cells among CD4+ T cells,

117

but exhibited similar kinetics (Fig. 2c). We also observed a positive correlation between the

118

frequency of CD137+OX40+ cells among CD4+ T cells and the frequency of CD137+CD69+ cells

119

among CD8+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 3).

120
121

Collectively, these results indicate that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses are longlasting over 8 months in COVID-19 convalescents.

124

SARS-CoV-2-specific TSCM cells develop after the infection
Next, we examined the differentiation status of SARS-CoV-2-specific AIM+ T cells

125

based on CCR7 and CD45RA expression in CD4+ (Fig. 3a) and CD8+ (Fig. 3b) T cell populations.

126

Among SARS-CoV-2-specific AIM+CD4+ T cells, the proportion of CCR7+CD45RA- (TCM) cells

127

was maintained at approximately 50% on average during the study period, and the

128

proportion of CCR7-CD45RA- (TEM) cells increased up to approximately 35% on average until

129

60 DPSO and then maintained thereafter (Fig. 3c). CCR7-CD45RA+ (TEMRA) cells were a minor

130

population (< 5%; Fig. 3c). Notably, the proportion of CCR7+CD45RA+ cells, which include

131

both naïve and TSCM cells, was approximately 30% on average in the acute phase, decreasing

132

to approximately 10% on average by 60 DPSO and then maintained thereafter (Fig. 3c).

133

Among SARS-CoV-2-specific AIM+CD8+ T cells, the proportion of CCR7+CD45RA- (TCM)

134

cells was approximately 20% on average in the acute phase and gradually decreased during

135

the study period (Fig. 3d). The proportion of CCR7-CD45RA- (TEM) cells increased up to 50%

136

on average until 60 DPSO and was maintained thereafter (Fig. 3d). The proportion of CCR7-

137

CD45RA+ (TEMRA) cells and CCR7+CD45RA+ cells was maintained (~25% and 25-35% on

138

average, respectively) during the study period (Fig. 3d).

139

We further investigated whether CCR7+CD45RA+ cells include TSCM cells, which have

140

a self-renewal capacity and multipotency for differentiation into diverse T cell subsets, by

141

examining CD95, a marker of TSCM cells15,16. In both AIM+CD4+ and AIM+CD8+ T cells, CD95+

142

cells were a dominant population among CCR7+CD45RA+ cells (Fig. 3e), indicating that the

143

CCR7+CD45RA+ cells among AIM+CD4+ or AIM+CD8+ T cells are mainly TSCM cells. The

144

frequency of TSCM cells among both AIM+CD4+ and AIM+CD8+ T cells gradually increased until

145

120 DPSO, when it reached a stable plateau (Fig. 3e). We found no significant difference in

146

the frequency of TSCM cells among AIM+CD4+ and AIM+CD8+ T cells between T1 (31 - 99

147

DPSO), T2 (100 - 199 DPSO), and T3 (200 - 254 DPSO; Extended Data Fig. 4a, b).

148
149

Successful development of SARS-CoV-2-specific TSCM cells is confirmed by direct ex vivo

150

MHC-I multimer staining

151

To validate the results from in vitro stimulation-based AIM assays, we detected

152

SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells by performing direct ex vivo MHC-I multimer staining and

153

examined the differentiation status of MHC-I multimer+ cells. We used an HLA-A*02

154

multimer loaded with SARS-CoV-2 S269 (YLQPRTFLL) peptide that has a low degree of

155

homology to the human common cold coronaviruses (ccCoVs)22,23. MHC-I multimer+ cells

156

were detected during the study period until 234 DPSO (Fig. 4a, b), and we determined the

157

proportions of TCM (CCR7+CD45RA-), TEM (CCR7-CD45RA-), TEMRA (CCR7-CD45RA+), and TSCM

158

(CCR7+CD45RA+CD95+) cells among MHC-I multimer+ cells (Fig. 4c). Influenza A virus (IAV)-

159

and cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific MHC-I multimers were also used to stain PBMCs from

160

healthy donors. Similar to the data from AIM+CD8+ T cells, TEM and TEMRA cells were the

161

dominant populations among SARS-CoV-2-specific MHC-I multimer+ cells, whereas TCM cells

162

were a minor population during the study period (Fig. 4d). Among IAV- and CMV-specific

163

MHC-I multimer+ cells from healthy donors, TEM and TEMRA cells were dominantly present,

164

whereas TCM cells were scarcely detected. TSCM cells were also detected among SARS-CoV-2-

165

specific MHC-I multimer+ cells during the study period, but not among IAV- and CMV-specific

166

cells (Fig. 4d). In particular, the frequency of TSCM cells among SARS-CoV-2-specific MHC-I

168

multimer+ cells was high 60 – 125 DPSO.
A recent study has revealed two distinct subsets of CCR7+ stem cell-like progenitors:

169

CCR7+PD-1-TIGIT- cells with stem cell-like features and CCR7+PD-1+TIGIT+ cells with exhausted

170

traits24. Therefore, we examined the expression of PD-1 and TIGIT in SARS-CoV-2-specific

171

MHC-I multimer+ TSCM cells. The frequency of PD-1+TIGIT+ cells was significantly lower among

172

SARS-CoV-2-specific TSCM cells than among total CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4e), confirming that SARS-

173

CoV-2-specific TSCM cells are bona fide stem-like memory cells.

174
175

Polyfunctionality and proliferation capacity are preserved in long-term SARS-CoV-2-

176

specific T cells

177

As we observed the generation of SARS-CoV-2-specific TSCM cells with self-renewal

178

capacity and multipotency, we aimed to examine the kinetics of the polyfunctionality of

179

SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells during the study period. To this end, we performed intracellular

180

cytokine staining of IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF, and CD107a following stimulation with OLP pools of S,

181

M, and N and analyzed the polyfunctionality of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5a). We defined

182

polyfunctional cells as cells exhibiting positivity for  2 effector functions. Among SARS-CoV-

183

2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, the average proportion of polyfunctional cells was 25 - 40%

184

and 30 - 50%, respectively, 60 DPSO, and was maintained until 254 DPSO (Fig. 5b). We found

185

no significant difference in the frequency of polyfunctional cells among SARS-CoV-2-specific

186

CD4+ and CD8+ T cells between T1 (31 - 99 DPSO), T2 (100 - 199 DPSO), and T3 (200 - 254

187

DPSO; Fig. 5c). Preserved polyfunctionality among SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells

188

was also observed when polyfunctionality was evaluated according to the number of

189

positive effector functions (Fig. 5d).

190

Finally, we examined the antigen-induced proliferation capacity of long-term SARS-

191

CoV-2-specific memory T cells. We performed CellTrace Violet (CTV) dilution assays and Ki-

192

67 staining using PBMCs obtained after 200 DPSO. CD4+ T cells exhibited a robust

193

proliferative response following in vitro stimulation with the S OLP pool (Fig. 5e), indicating

194

that SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells elicit rapid recall responses upon viral re-exposure.

195

Considering preserved polyfunctionality and proliferation capacity of SARS-CoV-2-

196

specific memory T cells, the current data indicate that memory T cells contribute to

197

protective immunity against re-infection even 8 months after the primary infection.

Discussion
Memory T cells play a crucial role in viral clearance during re-infection, but the

200

longevity and differentiation status of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells among COVID-19

201

convalescents remain unclear. In the present study, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2-

202

specific memory T cell responses were maintained in COVID-19 convalescents 8 months

203

post-infection. Notably, we found that SARS-CoV-2-specific TSCM cells were successfully

204

developed, indicating that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell memory may be long-lasting in COVID-

205

19 convalescents. These findings were supported by the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells from

206

PBMCs obtained after 200 DPSO exhibiting sustained polyfunctionality and proliferation

207

capacity. Our results may fill a gap in understanding T cell memory responses after recovery

208

from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

209

Recent studies suggest critical roles of T cells in the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and

210

protection from developing severe COVID-19. In particular, it has been shown that

211

coordination of adaptive immune responses, including CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, and antibody

212

responses, is essential for controlling COVID-1920. Notably, peak disease severity has been

213

shown to inversely correlate with the frequency of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells

214

instead of SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers20. In another study, T cell responses were detected

215

among COVID-19 convalescents without detectable SARS-CoV-2 IgG25. In a rhesus macaque

216

model, CD8-depleted convalescent animals exhibited limited viral clearance in the

217

respiratory tract upon SARS-CoV-2 re-challenge, suggesting that CD8+ T cells contribute to

218

viral clearance during SARS-CoV-2 re-infection10. Collectively, these studies strongly

219

demonstrate a protective role of T cells in COVID-19.

220

Currently, we do not have exact information on how long adaptive immune memory

221

lasts in COVID-19 convalescents. Whether antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 wane over

222

time in patients who have recovered from COVID-19 remains controversial26-28. Previous

223

studies on SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infection have shown that T cell responses were more

224

enduring compared to antibody responses12,13. A recent study detected SARS-CoV-1-specific

225

T cell responses 17 years after infection6. Similarly, slow decay of SARS-CoV-2-specific

226

memory T cells is expected. In the present study, we demonstrated the maintenance of

227

SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cell responses in COVID-19 convalescents over 8 months

228

post-infection using a battery of T cell assays. Given that vaccination programs for

229

prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection are being launched worldwide, another question is how

230

long memory T cells elicited by vaccination will last. Vaccine-induced memory T cells may

231

differ in phenotype and durability from infection-induced memory T cells, which should be

232

addressed in future studies.

233

A series of studies have reported the existence of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cell

234

responses among unexposed individuals, suggesting that memory T cells induced by

235

previous ccCoV infection are cross-reactive to SARS-CoV-2 proteins5,29-32. Therefore, in the

236

present study, we could not distinguish de novo primed T cells by SARS-CoV-2 infection from

237

pre-existing, cross-reactive ccCoV-specific T cells. However, we could selectively examine de

238

novo primed SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells by staining with an HLA-A*02 multimer loaded with

239

SARS-CoV-2 S269 (YLQPRTFLL) peptide. This epitope peptide has a low degree of homology

240

with ccCoVs, including OC43, HKU1, 229E, and NL6322,23. In future studies of SARS-CoV-2-

241

specific T cell responses, cross-reactive epitope peptides and SARS-CoV-2-specific epitope

242

peptides will need to be used separately30.

243

Among distinct subsets of memory T cells, TSCM cells possess a superior ability for

244

self-renewal, memory recall responses, and multipotency to reconstitute diverse memory

245

subsets15. Therefore, long-term T cell memory relies on the successful generation of TSCM

246

cells16. Previous studies showed that long-lasting YFV-specific CD8+ T cells resemble TSCM

247

cells17,18. We and others have also suggested the generation of SARS-CoV-2-specific TSCM cells

248

in the convalescent phase of COVID-19 on the basis of the expression of CCR7 and

249

CD45RA8,23. However, these studies on COVID-19 patients did not examine the definitive

250

marker of TSCM cells, CD95. In the present study, we delineated the kinetics of TSCM cells using

both AIM assays and MHC-I multimer staining, and observed the successful generation of

252

TSCM cells in COVID-19 convalescents. In line with these findings, we also found sustained

253

polyfunctionality and proliferation capacity, suggesting efficient memory recall responses. A

254

recent study has proposed that CCR7+ stem-like progenitor cells are composed of two

255

separate populations, which are distinguished by PD-1 and TIGIT expression24. We

256

demonstrated that PD-1 and TIGIT are rarely expressed in SARS-CoV-2-specific TSCM cells,

257

indicating that SARS-CoV-2-specific TSCM cells are not exhausted-like progenitors, but bona

258

fide stem-like memory cells.

260

critical role in host protection against viral infection33-35. For example, polyfunctional CD8+ T

261

cells are preserved in human immunodeficiency virus-infected long-term non-progressors34.

262

In addition, polyfunctional T cell responses are associated with effective control of hepatitis

263

C virus (HCV)35. It has also been reported that virus-specific polyfunctional T cells can be

264

successfully developed by immunization with vaccinia virus36 and an HCV vaccine37.

265

Collectively, polyfunctional memory T cells control viral infection more efficiently than

266

monofunctional T cells. Therefore, generation of polyfunctional memory T cells following

267

natural infection or vaccination is expected to confer protective immunity. In this regard, the

268

sustained polyfunctionality of long-term SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells observed in our study is

269

highly suggestive of long-lasting protective immunity in COVID-19 convalescents.

270

In summary, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific

271

memory T cell responses over 8 months post-infection. Our current analysis provides

272

valuable information regarding the longevity and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2-specific

273

memory T cells elicited by natural infection. These data add to our basic understanding of

274

memory T cell responses in COVID-19, which aids in establishing an effective vaccination

275

program and epidemiological measurement.

Methods

277

Patients and specimens
In this study, 94 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled

278
279

from Ansan Hospital and Chungbuk National University Hospital, Republic of Korea.

280

Peripheral blood was obtained from all patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also obtained

281

peripheral blood from seven healthy donors. In six asymptomatic patients, the date of the

282

first admission was regarded as 7 DPSO because the date of the first admission among

283

symptomatic patients was an average 7 DPSO. This study was reviewed and approved by the

284

institutional review board of all participating institutions and conducted according to the

285

principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all donors and

286

patients.

287

PBMCs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation using Lymphocyte

288

Separation Medium (Corning). After isolation, the cells were cryopreserved in fetal bovine

289

serum (FBS; Corning) with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich) until use.

290
291

Ex vivo IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assay
Plates with hydrophobic polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica,

292
293

MA) were coated with 2 μg/mL anti-human monoclonal IFN-γ coating antibody (clone 1-D1K,

294

Mabtech) overnight at 4°C. The plates were washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline

295

(PBS) and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (Bovogen) for 1 hour at room temperature

296

(RT). 700,000 PBMCs were seeded per well and stimulated with 1 μg/mL OLP pools spanning

297

SARS-CoV-2 spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins (Miltenyi Biotec) for 24 hours at

298

37°C. We used 10 μg/mL phytohemagglutinin as a positive control and an equimolar amount

299

of DMSO as a negative control. Plates were washed with 0.05% Tween-PBS (Junsei Chemical)

300

and incubated with 0.25 μg/mL biotinylated anti-human monoclonal IFN-γ antibody (clone

301

7-B6-1, Mabtech) for 2 hours at RT. After washing, streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase

302

(Invitrogen) was added sequentially. Precipitates were detected with AP color reagent (Bio-

303

Rad) and the reaction stopped by rinsing with distilled water. Spot-forming units were

304

quantified using an automated ELISpot reader (AID). To quantify SARS-CoV-2-specific

305

responses, spots in the negative control wells were subtracted from the OLP-stimulated

306

wells.

Multi-color flow cytometry

309

Cells were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies for specific surface

310

markers for 10 minutes at RT. Dead cells were excluded using LIVE/DEAD red fluorescent

311

reactive dye (Invitrogen). In intracellular staining experiments, cells were fixed and

312

permeabilized using the FoxP3 staining buffer kit (Invitrogen), and then stained for

313

intracellular markers for 30 minutes at 4°C. Multi-color flow cytometry was performed using

314

an LSR II instrument (BD Biosciences) and the data analyzed in FlowJo software (FlowJo LLC).

315

The fluorochrome-conjugated MHC-I multimers and monoclonal antibodies used in this

316

study are listed in Supplementary Table 2.

317
318
319

Activation-induced marker assay
PBMCs were blocked with 0.5 μg/mL anti-human CD40 mAb (clone HB14, Miltenyi

320

Biotec) in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin for 15

321

minutes at 37°C. The cells were then cultured in the presence of 1 μg/mL SARS-CoV-2 OLP

322

pools and 1 μg/mL anti-human CD28 and CD49d mAbs (clone L293 and L25, respectively, BD

323

Biosciences) for 24 hours. Stimulation with an equal concentration of DMSO in PBS was

324

performed as a negative control.

325
326

MHC-I multimer staining

327

PBMCs were stained with APC-conjugated MHC-I SARS-CoV-2 S269 pentamer

328

(Proimmune), IAV MP58 dextramer (Immudex), or CMV pp65495 dextramer (Immudex) for 15

329

minutes at RT and washed twice. Additional surface markers were stained using the

330

protocols described above.

331
332

Stimulation for intracellular cytokine staining

333

PBMCs were cultured in the presence of SARS-SoV-2 OLP pools and 1 μg/mL anti-

334

human CD28 and CD49d mAbs for 6 hours at 37°C. Brefeldin A (GolgiPlug, BD Biosciences)

335

and monensin (GolgiStop, BD Biosciences) were added 1 hour after the initial stimulation.

338

PBMCs were labeled using the CellTrace™ Violet Cell Proliferation Kit (Invitrogen) at

339

a concentration of 1.0 x 106 cells/mL for 20 minutes at 37°C. We then added 1% FBS-PBS to

340

the cells for 5 minutes at RT to quench unbound dyes. Cells were washed and cultured in

341

RPMI 1640 (Corning) containing 10% FBS (Corning) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin

342

(Welgene) at a concentration of 500,000 cells per well in the presence of 1 μg/mL SARS-CoV-

343

2 spike peptide pools and 1 μg/mL anti-human CD28 and CD49d mAbs (clone L293 and L25

344

respectively, BD Biosciences) for 120 hours. Stimulation with an equal concentration of

345

DMSO in PBS was performed as a negative control. After incubation, cells were harvested

346

and stained with antibodies for analysis by flow cytometry.

347
348
349

Data quantification and statistical analysis
Data were calculated as background-subtracted data. Background-subtracted data

350

were derived by subtracting the value after DMSO stimulation. When three stimuli were

351

combined, the value after each stimulation was combined and we subtracted triple the

352

value derived from DMSO stimulation.

353

Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 9 for Windows

354

(GraphPad Software). Significance was set at p<0.05. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was

355

used to compare data between two paired groups. In addition, the Kruskal-Wallis test with

356

Dunns’ multiple comparisons test was used to compare non-parametric data between

357

multiple unpaired groups. To assess the significance of correlation, the Spearman correlation

358

test was used. In cross-sectional analyses, a non-parametric local regression (LOESS) function

359

was employed with 95% confidence interval.
