Abstract
Objective: COVID-19 affects cardiorespiratory and muscular systems, causing
dysfunctions that may persist after recovery from the acute infection and
treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate cardiorespiratory fitness and
neuromuscular performance in these patients.
Methods: Patients recovered from mild (n=31) and severe (n=17) COVID-19
were evaluated and compared to healthy subjects (n=15). All volunteers
underwent a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test with simultaneous
acquisition of electromyography (EMG). Power output, oxygen uptake (VO 2),
pulse oxygen (O2Pulse), cardiovascular efficiency (ΔHR/ΔVO2), ventilation (VE),
breathing reserve (BR) and ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO2 slope) were
analyzed. From EMG, power output for type Ia and IIa activation as well as total
neuromuscular efficiency (Δwatts/Δ%RMS) were determined.
Results: Patients with severe COVID-19 presented lower VO2, O2Pulse and VE
than mild COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects (p < 0.05 for all comparisons).
No differences in ΔHR/ΔVO2, BR or VE/VCO2 slope were observed among the
groups (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). Type IIa and IIb fibers were activated at
lower power output in severe than in mild COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects

Introduction
In late December 2019, a previously unidentified coronavirus, currently
named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),
emerged from Wuhan, China, and resulted in a formidable outbreak in many
cities(1). Coronaviruses are found in a variety of birds and mammals throughout
the world and have a proclivity for emergence. In the past 20 years, three novel
human coronaviruses have emerged: SARS-CoV in 2002, Middle East
respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV in 2012, and the causative agent of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), SARS-CoV-2(2).
SARS-CoV-2 is a beta coronavirus that is genetically related to but distinct
from SARS-CoV. To gain entry into the host cell, the SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein
binds to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(2). The viral
response phase starts during the first days of infection, and flu-like symptoms are
common (mild phase). Some patients progress to an inflammatory response
phase. During this stage, patients develop viral pneumonia, and dyspnea/hypoxia
might appear. A minority of COVID-19 patients transit into the third and most
severe stage of the illness that manifests as systemic hyperinflammation
syndrome and multiorgan dysfunction(3).
In the respiratory system, the virus targets cells lining the respiratory
epithelium, causing from an asymptomatic infection to severe end-stage lung
disease requiring mechanical ventilation. Disease severity is likely to be a
combination of direct virus-induced pathology and the host inflammatory
response to the infection(2). In the cardiovascular system, there is evidence of
myocardial injury with some patients presenting abnormalities similar to

myocarditis(4). In the skeletal muscle, some patients showed malaise, muscle
soreness, and elevated levels of blood creatine kinase, which is considered an
indicator of muscle damage and inflammatory response (5).
As a result of this multisystemic effect, it is reasonable to suggest that
COVID-19 can decrease cardiorespiratory fitness and muscular performance,
affecting these functions in a direct association with the disease severity.
Additionally, these compromises may persist after the patients have recovered
from the COVID-19. However, to date, very few data exist about COVID-19
impact on these capacities after recovery and thus the performance sequels of
this illness are still poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to
evaluate cardiorespiratory fitness and neuromuscular performance in patients
recovered from mild to severe COVID-19. These data could provide physiological
guidance for rehabilitation training programs after COVID-19. We hypothesized
that recovery patients present impaired cardiorespiratory and neuromuscular
performances in accordance to the disease severity.

Methods
Study design
An observational study was carried out. In a single-day evaluation, the
patients underwent a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) with simultaneous
assessment of muscle electromyography (EMG). This study was approved by the
local research ethics committee (Instituto de Educação Superior da Paraíba IESP, opinion No. 4.132.248, CAAE No. 34234720.0.0000.5184) and was
registered in the Brazilian Clinical Trial Registration Platform (Number: RBR6xqcr4).
Casuistic
A group of COVID-19 patients who were referred for functional evaluation
by CPET at the Exercise Physiology Laboratory of the Federal University of
Paraíba from July 4th to 14th were considered eligible for this study. Additionally,
a group of healthy subjects paired by age, sex and anthropometric characteristics
with the COVID patients was enrolled in the study as a control group.

COVID-19 diagnosis was established by clinical symptoms (fever, fatigue,
muscle soreness, cough, dyspnea, etc.) associated with a positive laboratory test
(nasal swab or serology) and/or chest tomography (ground-glass opacity).
Patients were classified as mild (major clinical symptoms without dyspnea or
respiratory failure) or severe (major clinical symptoms with dyspnea or respiratory
failure), as postulated by Tian et al(6). Patients who met the following inclusion
criteria were enrolled: recovered (less than 30 days) from mild to severe COVID19. Exclusion criteria were based on comorbidity confounding factors. Thus,
patients with critical COVID-19 (i.e. who had required intubation and mechanical
ventilation) and those with previous cardiac, pulmonary, neurological,
hematological or muscular diseases were excluded.
Cardiopulmonary exercise test
The technical procedures for CPET followed the American Thoracic
Society/American College of Chest Physicians guidelines for cycle ergometer
testing(7). The CPET was performed on a CG-04 cycle ergometer (INBRAMED,
Porto Alegre, Brazil). Each subject performed a ramp-up protocol, starting with
warm-up unloaded pedaling for 2 minutes followed by a workload increment
individually selected to achieve maximum effort within 8 to 12 min. Subjects were
strongly encouraged by verbal stimuli to achieve maximum effort. The VO2000
(MedGraphics, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA) was used for gas analysis, and it was
calibrated according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data were filtered (mean
of 7 points) to avoid noise and analyzed by 10s-averages. Before CPET, a
resting spirometry was conducted, in which forced expiratory volume in one
second (FEV1) was measured (ASMA-1, Vitalograph, United Kingdom) to
calculate maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV = FEV1 x 35).
For analyses, the following variables were considered: power output, peak
oxygen uptake (VO2), percentage of predicted VO2(8), respiratory exchange ratio
at maximal effort (RER), oxygen pulse at maximal effort (O2Pulse),
cardiovascular efficiency (ΔHR/ΔVO2), peak ventilation (VE), breathing reserve
used during maxima effort (BR = VE/MVV) and ventilatory efficiency (VE/VCO 2
slope).

Electromyography activity

During CPET, neuromuscular activity was analyzed by EMG using a signal
acquisition module with a 12-bit resolution A/D converter (EMG800C, EMG
System, São José dos Campos, Brazil). Sampling frequency was adjusted to
1000 Hz, frequency band to 20-500 Hz and gain to 1000 times. Bipolar Ag/AgCl
self-adhesive surface electrodes were used and placed 20 mm apart (center to
center) at the right vastus lateralis (2/3 of the way from the anterior superior iliac
spine to the lateral side of the patella), according to Surface Electromyography
for the Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles recommendations(9).
Root mean square (RMS) values were used for analysis. EMG breakpoints
were analyzed during the ramp-up protocol, as previously described by Lucía et
al(10). The increased EMG amplitude reflects the recruitment of additional motor
units (11). Based on this, the first EMG breakpoint was assumed to be type IIa
fiber activation, and the second EMG breakpoint was assumed to be type IIb fiber
activation (Henneman’s principle)(12). The power outputs at the first and second
EMG breakpoints were analyzed (figure 1A). For neuromuscular efficiency
analysis, EMG data were normalized by the RMS obtained at the maximum effort
(%RMS). Neuromuscular efficiency was determined by the relationship between
the power output and EMG (watts/%RMS) at each exercise intensity (25%, 50%,
75% and 100% of maximum power output) (figure 1B), while total neuromuscular
efficiency (Δwatts/Δ%RMS) was determined by the relationship between the
variation in power output and EMG from unloaded pedaling to maximum exercise
intensity.

electromyography (EMG). RMS: root mean square.

Statistical analysis
Data normality was verified using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Ordinary one-way
ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test were used to evaluate intergroup
differences for data with a Gaussian distribution. The Kruskal-Wallis test with
Dunn’s multiple comparisons test were used to evaluate intergroup differences
for data without a Gaussian distribution. The categorical variables were analyzed
by Fisher’s exact test. The effect size was calculated by the F test family (ANOVA:
fixed effects, omnibus, one-way) and post hoc type of analysis. The input
parameters were as follows: the effect size, f; total sample size; number of groups
= 3 and error probability α = 0.05. The effect size, f, was directly calculated from
the partial η2. The effect size convention was f ≥ 0.1 (small), f ≥ 0.25 (medium) and
f ≥ 0.40 (large)(13). A statistical significance value of p ≤ 0.05 was set for all

analyses. GraphPad Prism 7.0 and GPower 3.1.9.7 software were used.
According to data normality distribution, data are presented as means ± standard
deviations or as medians and interquartile ranges and percentages.

Results
A total of 66 patients were enrolled in the study, but 18 were excluded due
to comorbidities (asthma = 9, heart failure = 3, critical COVID-19 = 3, COPD = 2
and fibromyalgia = 1). From the remained 48 patients, 31 had mild and 17 severe
disease. The healthy group was composed by 15 subjects. Characteristics of
each group are presented in table 1. Anthropometric characteristics are similar
among the groups, while COVID symptoms were more frequent in the severe
group that also used zinc more frequently as therapy.

Discussion
The main finding of this study was that 1) patients recovered from severe
COVID-19 had lower cardiorespiratory fitness, activate muscle fibers Ia and Ib at
lower power outputs and present lower neuromuscular efficiency than patients
with mild COVID-19 and healthy subjects; while 2) patients recovered from mild
COVID-19 had cardiorespiratory fitness and neuromuscular performance similar
to healthy subjects.
Peak oxygen uptake reflects functional capacity and has high prognostic
value in clinical populations (14)(15). The expected behavior of this variable in
patients recovered from COVID-19 is unknown. The present study showed that
COVID-19 can have a significant impact on this variable in those patients who
had the severe disease but have no effect on those who had only mild symptoms.
The hazardous impact observed on VO2 may derived from COVID-19’s effects as
this disease produces pulmonary function landings (16), myocardial injury (17),
and neuromuscular dysfunction (5), but it may also derived from functional
impairment imposed by inactivity and hospitalization (18). In a clinical
perspective, the reduced VO2 observed after severe COVID-19 suggest a worst
prognosis for these patients, which should be investigated.
Regarding pulmonary function, it is interesting to note that despite the
pulmonary compromise usually seen during COVID-19 evolution, patients with
severe symptoms had preserved breath reserve and ventilatory efficiency
although peak ventilation was reduced. Xiaoneng et al (19) evaluated resting
pulmonary function in 110 patients with COVID-19 discharged from hospital and

reported that spirometry values were not affected (forced vital capacity and VEF1
> 90% of predicted), while diffusion capacity (64.7% predicted) and total lung
capacity (79.2% predicted) were compromised in severe patients. This finding
suggests that pulmonary sequalae related to severe COVID may mainly related
to lung total volume and gas diffusion, and not to functional volumes that were
used during exercise.
Once spirometry values normalize in severe patients and present only a
slight reduction in total lung capacity(19), ventilatory performance may have been
impaired by respiratory muscle dysfunction. In addition to peripheral muscle,
respiratory muscle may present lower performance in severe COVID-19 patients.
As demonstrated in healthy(20)(21) and other disease models(22), there is a
relationship between peripheral muscle performance and respiratory muscle
performance.
Multiple mechanisms of deregulation in pulmonary perfusion exist in
COVID-19: the abolition of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, causing an
increase in venous admixture, and excessive pulmonary vasoconstriction and
microthrombosis or macrothrombosis, leading to increased deadspace(23).
Despite this, the VE/VCO2 slope was normal in our sample (even in severe
patients). A significant reduction in O2pulse was also observed in the group of
individuals with severe manifestations; however, the normal ascending behavior
of the O2pulse curve and preserved ventilatory efficiency reduced the probability
of central cardiovascular limitation. One possibility is that those deregulatory
mechanisms do not persist after a time of recovery. Another possibility is that only
critical patients present significant pulmonary perfusion deregulation.
Thus,

individuals

manifestations had lower functional capacity, without evidence of significant
central cardiorespiratory changes, than those recovered from mild COVID-19 or
healthy subjects. The reduction in neuromuscular efficiency demonstrated
through electromyography suggests that the effort limitation of these individuals
is related to a peripheral mechanism.
Severe COVID-19 patients presented lower neuromuscular efficiency,
probably due to myositis and a higher inflammatory pattern. Myositis is
characterized by the presence of prominent muscle membrane irritability. In
myositis, there is invasion and destruction of muscle fibers by cytotoxic T

cells(24). SARS-CoV-2 activates inflammatory cytokines, causing inflammatory
injury in muscle cells(25). The degree of abnormal muscle membrane irritability
is related to disease severity. Mao et al.(26) showed that 11% of the patients had
evidence of skeletal muscle injury (creatinine kinase>200 U/L and skeletal
muscle pain). Injury was significantly more common in patients with severe
disease (19%) than in those with non severe disease (5%). Pizon et al.(5)
demonstrated, in a meta-analysis of prevalence based on each neurological
manifestation, that muscle injury or myalgia was the most common (19.2%)
neurological symptom in individuals with COVID-19.
Type IIa and IIb fibers were activated at much lower power output in severe
COVID-19 patients, suggesting worse performance in type I and IIa fibers.
Currently, there is insufficient knowledge about muscle histology and fiber-type
composition in COVID-19. Independent of any specific pathological process,
muscle inactivity causes significant atrophy of all muscle fiber types. Bed rest
appears to most strongly induce type I fiber atrophy, accompanied by a fiber-type
shift from type I and IIa fibers to type IIb fibers. Taken together, the type of injury,
the muscle group affected and the time since injury or rest may all influence how
specific muscle fiber types are affected(27).
The pathological process in myopathies results in dysfunction and the
dropout of individual muscle fibers located randomly within the motor unit. In
myositis, motor neurons and motor axons are not affected. Motor unit action
potentials become polyphasic, short in duration and low in amplitude(28). Severe
COVID-19 patients presented high EMG activity with low power output because
each small motor unit was able to generate only a reduced amount of force,
requiring the recruitment of many motor units.
The current study shows a consistent external validity once CPET and
EMG are low cost and non-invasive methods, available in the majority of clinical
exercise laboratories. However, it is important to point out that we assessed a
small sample from a single city in Brazil.
Our study has some limitations. First, a priori sample size calculation was
not conducted, however posteriori calculation considering VO 2 variable resulted
in a power of 0.99 and an effect size of 0.54. Sex distribution was different
between severe and mild COVID-19 patients, however data presented the same
pattern in both sex. Unfortunately, other variables, such as respiratory muscle

performance (power and strength) and lactate concentrations that might help to
explain the lower capacity observed in severe COVID-19 patients were not
assessed in the present study and future studies should evaluate them.

Conclusions
Patients recovered from severe COVID-19 present low cardiorespiratory
fitness, activate glycolytic fibers at low power outputs, and show low
neuromuscular efficiency; while patients recovered from mild COVID-19 do not
present these sequels.
