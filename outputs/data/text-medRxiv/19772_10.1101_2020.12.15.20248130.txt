37

with the keywords ‘SARS-CoV-2’, ‘transmission’, ‘phylogeny’, ‘city’, and ‘model’ as of February

40

only a few studies reporting on European cities, including analyses of London and Geneva. We

42

analysis or a dynamic modelling approach and did not combine the two, despite the different

43

aspects described. Moreover, the majority of studies evaluate publicly available data for mod-

44

elling SARS-CoV-2 transmission and to estimate effective reproductive numbers. Such analyses

45

naturally lack a direct relation of cases and relevant socioeconomic, or geographical informa-

46

tion on a per case basis. To date, whole-genome-sequencing information has not been used

47

to clearly identify inherently related cases for modelling transmission behaviour in any of the

48

studies assessed. Finally, of the modelling studies reported, none provided a data-driven es-

49

timate of vaccine scenarios in a city, for which all model parameters were identified from the

50

same source.

51

Added value of this study: In this comprehensive study we examine SARS-CoV-2 transmission

52

patterns within a medium-sized European city. We benefit from a rich data set allowing us

53

to combine phylogenetic clustering with compartmental modelling based exclusively on se-

54

quenced and inherently related cases that are mapped to a residential address, and hence cou-

55

pled with socioeconomic and demographic information. This allows us to evaluate population

56

groups driving SARS-CoV-2 transmission and to quantify relevant effective reproductive num-

57

bers. Moreover, we identify both traceable and cryptic transmission chains allowing us to sug-

58

gest which measures (such as vaccination vs. effective contact tracing) would be most effective

59

for each group.

60

Implications of all the available evidence: Depending on the specific characteristics of the

61

vaccine, we estimate that vaccination of exclusively the senior population groups will reduce

62

intensive-care-unit occupancy, but overall case number would more effectively be contained

63

by prioritising highly mobile population groups from a socioeconomically weaker background

64

(i.e. transmission drivers), even in the context of comparably shallow socioeconomic gradients

65

within a wealthy European urban area. We identified predominantly clustered transmission

66

amongst more senior or more affluent and less mobile population groups, which implies that

67

extensive testing strategies could be used to more effectively prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission

68

among these groups. By contrast, mobile, low-income population groups were characterized

69

by cryptic transmission. These are very important findings which could be considered in future

70

vaccine prioritization designs for comparable urban areas.

71

72

Background. Transmission chains within small urban areas (accommodating∼30% of the

73

European population) greatly contribute to case burden and economic impact during the

74

ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and should be a focus for preventive measures to achieve con-

75

tainment. Here, at very high spatio-temporal resolution, we analysed determinants of SARS-

76

CoV-2 transmission in a European urban area, Basel-City (Switzerland).

77

Methods. We combined detailed epidemiological, intra-city mobility, and socioeconomic

78

data-sets with whole-genome-sequencing during the first SARS-CoV-2 wave. For this, we

79

succeeded in sequencing 44% of all reported cases from Basel-City and performed phyloge-

80

netic clustering and compartmental modelling based on the dominating viral variant (B.1-

81

C15324T; 60% of cases) to identify drivers and patterns of transmission. Based on these

82

results we simulated vaccination scenarios and corresponding healthcare-system burden

83

(intensive-care-unit occupancy).

84

Findings. Transmissions were driven by socioeconomically weaker and highly mobile popu-

85

lation groups with mostly cryptic transmissions, whereas amongst more senior population

86

transmission was clustered. Simulated vaccination scenarios assuming 60-90% transmis-

87

sion reduction, and 70-90% reduction of severe cases showed that prioritizing mobile, so-

88

cioeconomically weaker populations for vaccination would effectively reduce case numbers.

89

However, long-term intensive-care-unit occupation would also be effectively reduced if se-

90

nior population groups were prioritized, provided there were no changes in testing and pre-

91

vention strategies.

92

Interpretation. Reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission through vaccination strongly depends

93

on the efficacy of the deployed vaccine. A combined strategy of protecting risk groups by

94

extensive testing coupled with vaccination of the drivers of transmission (i.e. highly mobile

95

groups) would be most effective at reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within an urban area.

Introduction

98

Efforts to understand transmission of SARS-CoV-2 have been undertaken at different scales in-

99

cluding at a global level1–3 , across continents (Europe and North America4 ), within countries

100

(Austria5 , Brazil6 , France7 , Iceland8 , South Africa9 , Thailand10 ) and in large cities (Beijing11 ,

101

Boston12 , Houston13 , and New York City14–16 ). In Europe, ∼30% of the population live in small

102

urban areas (10k − 300k inhabitants)17 , which accordingly play a major role in SARS-CoV-2

103

transmission yet have not been studied. Moreover, to date city-based studies of SARS-CoV-

104

2 transmission have very limited resolution in terms of the proportion of sequenced positive

105

cases (incomplete transmission chains), have a paucity of socioeconomic or mobility data (in-

106

complete determinants), or fail to combine analysis of transmission clusters with quantita-

107

tive, descriptive models accounting for population mixing18 . Of those studies describing the

108

distribution of cases together with changes in mobility, none to date rigorously study socioe-

109

conomic differences between city quarters as determinants of transmission13, 15, 16, 19 . An inte-

110

grated model considering all of these factors (including epidemiological, geographic, mobil-

111

ity, socioeconomic, transmission dynamics information) is anticipated to provide profound

112

insights into the determinants underpinning transmission, that can be used to guide the de-

113

livery of vaccines. We here present such an integrated analysis for Basel-City which is part of

114

a metropolitan area, a functional urban area, and a European cross-border area as outlined in

115

the supplement. Basel-City is hence representative of other areas in the EU classified as such.

116

Local interventions are most effective in cutting transmission chains in families, and small

117

community networks20, 21 that represent well-defined (phylogenetic or epidemiological) clus-

118

ters. However, most infections are acquired from unknown sources and transmitted crypti-

119

cally making it essential to identify the key determinants and transmission routes at the city-

120

level to improve interventions and vaccination campaigns. To address this challenge, we have

121

combined phylogenetic cluster analysis22 and compartmental ordinary differential equation

122

(ODE) modelling based on high density (81% of reported cases assessed), and high resolution

123

(spatial:housing blocks, temporal: day-by-day) epidemiological, mobility, socioeconomic, and

124

serology (estimate unreported cases) data-sets from the first COVID-19 wave (February-April

2020). Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of all included cases (44% of all cases successful) al-

126

lowed the analysis be restricted to a single, dominant viral variant (B.1-C15324T, 60% of cases

127

23

). This ensured that our analyses focused on inherently related cases and enabled estimation

128

of effective reproductive numbers for different socioeconomic and demographic population

129

subgroups to provide the basis for vaccination scenario building.

130

Methods

131

Detailed methods are given in the supplements.

132

Included data. All analyses were based on PCR-positive (750/7073 tests) cases of residents of

133

Basel-City between February 25t h and April 22nd 2020, obtained from the University Hospital

134

Basel, covering 81% of all reported cases in the relevant interval and location. All samples were

135

subjected to WGS, 53% resulted in high quality genomes (i.e. 44% of all cases). Of these 247

136

(247/411, 60%) contained the monophyletic C15324T mutation in the B.1 lineage (B.1-C15324T)

137

and were used for further analysis. Each case was linked to the patient’s place of residence

138

anonymized to one of 1,078 statistical housing-blocks. For each of these housing-blocks, where

139

privacy legislation permitted, Basel-City’s Cantonal Statistical Office provided socioeconomic

140

indicators for the year of 2017 (most recent available). These included (i) living space (per capita

141

in m 2 ), (ii) share of 1-person private households, (iii) median income (CHF), and (iv) popula-

142

tion seniority (percentage of citizens aged over 64 years). According to these indicators, blocks

143

were allocated to one of three socioeconomic tertiles (T1:≤33rd percentile, T2: 33rd to 66th

144

percentile, T3:>66th percentile, N/A: no available data or censored) where possible (e.g. Figure

145

2A). Generally, sparsely populated blocks displayed a maximum of three positive cases and had

146

to be excluded from analysis. All following analyses with respect to socioeconomic factors were

147

based on these partitions.

148

We determined SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses in 2,019 serum samples collected between 25t h

149

of February and 22nd of May 2020 to account for delayed seroconversion (see supplement for

150

details). An estimated 1.9% (38/2,019) of the Basel-City population was infected with SARS-

151

CoV-2, corresponding to 88% unreported cases for the sequenced B.1-C15324T variant (see sup-

152

plement).

153

Finally, we included data on the number and age distribution of COVID-19 intensive-care unit

154

(ICU) patients during the relevant period from University Hospital Basel, a tertiary hospital with

155

a capacity of 44 ICU beds: 4.5% of reported SARS-CoV-2 positive cases were admitted to ICU

156

and median length of ICU stay was 5.9 days (IQR, 1.5-12.9). 40% of these patients were younger

157

than 64 years.

158

Phylogenetic inference and cluster analysis. SARS-CoV-2 genomes were phylogenetically anal-

159

ysed in a global context as described previously23 (see supplements). Phylogenetic clusters were

160

consolidated with epidemiological data (occupation in a health service job, resident of a care

161

home, contact to positive cases, onset of symptoms, place of infection) to confirm the suitabil-

162

ity of the divergence parameter chosen and then combined with ancillary geographic (quar-

163

ter), and socioeconomic information as described above. We inferred statistical significance for

164

clusters in respective tertiles.

165

Mobility data. We employed the official traffic model provided by the traffic department of

166

Basel-City

167

for foot, bike, public motorized and private motorized transport. We computed the spatial

168

variation of mobility within and between each of the socioeconomic partitions (see supple-

169

ment) resulting in a unity-normalized three-by-three mobility matrix M j k representing rela-

170

tive within-tertile/inter-tertile mobility on/off its diagonal. Additionally, weekly averages of

171

pass-by traffic for combined foot-bike traffic, as well as private motorized traffic were obtained

172

together with weekly public-transport passenger loads (from SBB Swiss Federal Railways and

173

Basel-Verkehrsbetriebe). These were combined in a weighted sum according to the relevant

174

transport mode contribution, normalized and smoothed with a uni-variate spline to obtain the

175

final temporal mobility variation, αmob (t )).

176

Dynamic changes in social interaction. SARS-CoV-2 transmission is contact-based. While

177

the number of contacts is largely influenced by human mobility, the risk of a contact becoming a

178

transmission event is further determined by the precautions taken by the individuals in contact

179

(washing hands, wearing masks, distance keeping) resulting in an effective, time-dependent

180

reproductive number R e f f (t ). We derive the relevant time-dependence of R e f f (t ) by applying a

181

Kalman filter 25, 26 to the piece-wise linearised time-series of daily confirmed B.1-C15324T cases.

182

Assuming a multiplicative model, the time-dependence of transmission risk stemming from

24

consisting of the 2016 average A-to-B traffic on a grid of ∼1400 counting zones

185

SEIR-model. We used a compartmental two-arm susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR)

186

model 19, 27, 28 including sequenced and unsequencend/unreported cases that is outlined in Fig-

187

ure S1. The initial number of susceptibles was fixed to the relevant population. All other com-

188

partments were initialized as zeros, apart from a seed in E corresponding to the first reported

189

cases. In summary, our model is based only on six free parameters: the reproductive number

190

per tertile R j (three parameters, range [0, 20]), the initial number of exposed in a single ter-

191

tile (range [0, 5]), and the infectious times Ti n f U and Ti n f P (range [1.5, 12] days). We assumed

192

a latency period Ti nc of two days29 . Model fitting and evaluation are described in the supple-

193

ment. Results are shown as mean values over 50 bootstraps with bootstrap uncertainty bands.

served reduction in mobility.

203

Vaccination scenarios were simulated for 70-90% effective vaccines to prevent COVID-1930–32 ,

204

as well as 60% and 90% efficacies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The effectively immu-

205

nized fraction of the population was moved to the recovered compartment Ur . We accounted

206

for a change in social interaction behaviour following vaccination by assigning a mean social

207

interaction score of the vaccinated and not-vaccinated population amongst the initial suscep-

208

tibles (αsoc,v acc (t ) = 0.75, αsoc,nov acc (t ) = 0.5). Full mobility was modelled (αmob (t ) = 1) after a

209

single exposed individual was introduced into each of the tertiles. All scenarios were compared

210

to the no-vaccine case (V0): vaccination of a fixed population fraction at random (V1); vacci-

211

nation of different population groups (V2: exclusively from T1 median income, V3: exclusively

212

from T3 seniority, V4: 50% from T1 median income, 50% from T3 seniority). In addition to

213

case numbers, the time to reach 50% of ICU capacity was determined as quantifiable endpoint

214

indicating healthcare system burden. In case of not-random vaccination, we adjusted the rele-

215

vant fraction of ICU cases based on the represented proportions of senior population fractions

216

within all susceptibles.

SARS-CoV-2 spread and clustering. We observed 29 viral lineages in Basel-City (Figure S10),

219

with 247 genomes (60.0%) belonging to the B.1-C15324T variant23 (Figure 1A, B). Applying a

genetic divergence threshold, a total of 128 phylogenetic clusters were determined across all

221

samples, of which 70 belonged to lineage B.1-C15324T (Figure 1C). Mapping phylogenetic clus-

222

ters onto tertiles of socioeconomic and demographic determinants, we found that for median

223

income, T1 contained the most and T3 the least clusters (Figure 1C). Most within- and among-

224

tertile transmission clusters were spread randomly, except for significant within-tertile trans-

225

missions among high median income households (T3) (Figure 1D). Further, we observed that

226

SARS-CoV-2 isolates were more likely to belong to the same phylogenetic cluster for blocks with

227

either the highest living space per person, lowest share of 1-person households, or highest se-

228

niority (Figure 1E). This is also true among people living in the more affluent quarters Riehen,

229

Bruderholz, Am Ring, and Iselin, who transmitted the virus in their social networks either in the

230

same quarter or in the same socioeconomic rank (Figure S9). By contrast, positive cases that

231

belong to lower socioeconomic/demographic tertiles (either lower income, less living space,

232

or younger age) are less likely to be members of the same tight phylogenetic cluster, indicat-

233

ing cryptic transmission predominates among lower socioeconomic and younger demographic

234

groups.

Spatio-temporal variation of mobility and social interaction patterns. Figure 2A and Figures

236

S2-S4 show Basel-City’s partition and the corresponding mobility graph. Importantly, the sta-

237

tistical blocks per tertile do not form a single, geographically connected, entity. We observe that

238

mobility varies by transport modality and tertile (Figure 2A inset). For example, for low-median

239

income (T1) the share of private motorized traffic and mobility is more pronounced than in the

240

tertiles of higher median income (T2 and T3).

241

Figure 2B shows for each partition the summed edge weights of the mobility graph accounting

242

for the mobility contribution to the final effective reproductive number. We observe that low

243

and median income populations are more mobile than their wealthier counterparts. Moreover,

244

there is little mobility within areas with a low share of 1-person households, a result of the pre-

245

dominantly peripheral location of the relevant statistical blocks (see Figure S6). For living space

246

per person or percentage of senior citizens, mobility was comparable between tertiles with a

247

trend towards higher mobility within the younger population groups.

248

Dynamic changes in mobility were assessed by agglomerating normalized traffic counts for

249

public and private transport modalities (Figure 2C). There was a clear drop in mobility for both

250

public and private transport modes around the onset of the national lockdown date (12th March

251

2020). The decrease was more pronounced for public transport, resulting in a weighted aver-

252

age mobility drop of approximately 50% (Figure 2D). Figure 2D also shows the dynamic change

253

in social interaction contribution to B.1-C15324T case numbers. Despite noticeable fluctua-

254

tion, social interaction contribution decreased on average over time. This data also reflects

255

variation in case reporting which affected the estimated effective reproductive number. Im-

256

portantly, since the B.1-C15324T variant was eventually eradicated despite non-zero mobility,

257

262

given in Figures 3D-F (Figures S5-S7D-F). Independent of the underlying partition, the model

263

provided adequate fits (RMSE < 4.5) and we observed a drop in R e f f following the dynamic

264

changes in mobility and social interaction. Importantly, there was a significant difference (2%

265

achieved significance) in R e f f between statistical blocks of the highest and lowest median in-

266

come. For all socioeconomic partitions these differences are summarized as histograms in Fig-

267

ures 3G-J. Here, we found that blocks with higher living space per person (1% achieved sig-

268

nificance), or higher median income (2% achieved significance), or or lower share of 1-person

269

households (2% achieved significance) had a significantly lower R e f f (< 1.7) compared to the

270

maximum R e f f observed in the relevant partition (Table S1). A partitioning based on the share

271

of senior residents did not result in significant differences in R e f f (45% achieved significance).

272

Differences in R e f f are due to two factors: the effective mobility contribution (Figure 2B), and

273

the modelled reproductive number (R, eq.(8)). In particular, the tertile with the lowest share of

274

1-person households (T1) showed less mobility compared to T2 and T3, leading to significant

275

differences in R e f f . By contrast, mobility in the T1 and T3 tertiles of living space per person

276

were similar (Figure 2B), yet differences in R e f f were significant, indicating that the transmis-

277

sion was not dominated by mobility alone.

Impact of mobility changes and modelling of vaccination scenarios. We simulated the de-

279

velopments of the first wave of the epidemic under the assumption of different mobility sce-

280

narios and modelled two future vaccination strategies. Figure 4A (Figures S5-S7G) displays the

281

results for mobility scenarios as observed with up to 50% mobility reduction (scenario MO),

282

100% mobility (scenario M1), and no mobility (scenario M2). Peak case numbers (April 12th )

283

would have been approximately three times higher in the case of no reduction in mobility (M1).

284

However, the decrease in peak case numbers assuming zero mobility (M2) as modelled, was not

285

as pronounced. Mobility reduction hence played a vital role for the containment of SARS-CoV-

286

2.

287

Figure 4B (Figures S5-S7H) shows the results for an outbreak scenario (denoted as V1) in which

288

a specific fraction of the population (33% or 66%) received a vaccine that provided either 60% or

289

90% vaccine transmission reduction, with 90% severe COVID-19 case prevention. As expected,

290

we observe that higher vaccine efficacy or higher population fraction vaccinated reduces the

291

slope and plateau of the epidemic curve. Scenarios for less effective vaccines are shown in

292

Figure S11. Effectiveness to prevent severe COVID-19 solely affects the rate of severe cases

293

and hence ICU occupancy and the time point of reaching 50% ICU occupancy (Figure 4B vs.

294

Figure S11E). It should be noted, that vaccination of the population at random is an artificial

295

scenario, applied here only to demonstrate the impact of vaccination efficacy relative to the

296

population fraction vaccinated. This scenario serves as a baseline comparison for two more

297

realistic vaccination strategies given in Figure 4C. Here, as a proof of concept, vaccines that

298

provide 90% transmission reduction, and 90% reduction of severe cases are delivered to 23%

299

of the population are presented. For scenario V2, vaccination is prioritized in what we deter-

300

mined as determinants of SARS-CoV-2 transmission – individuals with low income, who have

301

fewer options to socially distance (e.g. by working from home) and hence were more likely to be

302

exposed to and/or transmit the virus (reflected by a higher R e f f ). With this strategy, the slope

303

of the epidemic curve would be reduced compared to randomly vaccinating the same number

304

of subjects from the whole population. Figure 4D describes the corresponding development

305

of ICU occupancy for the scenarios modelled, revealing that scenario V2 leads to a delay of

306

approximately 11 days to reach the 50% ICU capacity mark as compared to scenario V1. In sce-

307

nario V3, resembling the approach by several countries, priority was given to the population

308

group with the highest share of senior residents, which had lower mobility than the rest of the

309

population (Figure 2B) but constitutes 60% of ICU cases. We observe that scenario V3 resulted

310

in a marginally steeper epidemic curve (Figure 4C) and would yield 50% ICU capacity at a sim-

311

ilar time as a random vaccination strategy (Figure 4D). However, the total number of cases at

312

this time would be approximately double in scenario V3 compared to V1 (Figure 4C), whereas

313

the overall peak ICU occupancy would be lowest in V3 (Figure 4D). These simulations suggest

314

that - in case of vaccines reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission - vaccination of population groups

315

driving transmission are most effective in reducing the slope of the epidemic curve, whereas

316

vaccination of high-risk groups reduces healthcare system burden in the long term. The pre-

317

sented effects strongly depend on the specific vaccine characteristics and population fraction

318

vaccinated. In Figure 4E, F we finally show the potential effects of a mixed vaccination scenario

319

giving equal priority to senior and highly mobile population groups as a representative exam-

320

ple. This mixed mode provides a possible compromise with lower case numbers compared to

321

V1, but also delayed and reduced ICU occupancy relative to V1.

Discussion

323

This analysis evaluates complementary aspects of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 within a medium-

324

sized European urban area, including local transmission analysed by phylogenetic tree infer-

325

ence and clustering, and the overall spread described by a compartmental SEIR-model enabling

326

simulation of vaccination strategies. The main strength of this study lies in the high degree of

327

diverse and detailed data included as well as the complementary models and analyses.

328

Patterns of SARS-CoV-2 transmission have previously been discussed from different angles ei-

329

ther via network and transmission modelling 33 , by statistical evaluation 34 , or by phylogenetic

330

clustering based on genomic sequencing data35 . Independent of model choice, the importance

331

of socioeconomic factors has been suggested previously18, 33 . However, analyses focused on

332

metropolitan areas only may be biased towards their underlying socioeconomic and demo-

333

graphic characteristics making it important to also quantify SARS-CoV-2 transmission in other

334

urban areas, such as in a city context, as well as in countries across all continents and stages

335

of economic potential. Modelling studies provide the foundation of scenario predictions and

336

estimation of effective reproductive numbers but require balancing the trade-off between de-

337

tail described and the number of data points available. Accordingly, many published models

338

rely on publicly available case numbers without being able to directly relate socioeconomic

339

parameters and specific geographic locations per case, and/or are only performed for large

340

metropolitan areas19 . This has led to biases in evaluations and the neglect of a considerable

341

population share living outside major cities (53%/41% in Europe/worldwide)36, 37 . In this study

342

we chose Basel-City as a case study of a European urban area. Despite the strong economic

17

343

status of Switzerland, implying potentially less extreme socioeconomic gradients than other

344

countries, we demonstrate that socioeconomic background impacts the probability to acquire

345

and transmit SARS-CoV-2. It would be expected that in cities containing more pronounced

346

socioeconomic gradients, these disparities would emphasize transmission patterns of SARS-

347

CoV-2 between and within socioeconomic groups.

348

The success of our analyses is based on the optimized choice of evaluation and model, high

349

data-density and -quality, rather than large absolute case numbers. It is difficult to distinguish

350

the spread of competing viral variants within the same population and to account for new intro-

351

ductions in a model since classical ODE or agent-based models are relying on the assumption

352

of uninterrupted transmission chains. Sequencing information is essential to reliably inform

353

on such transmission patterns. Yet given the cost of such analyses, WGS covering entire epi-

354

demic waves is often unfeasible. We included 81% of all reported cases in the study time frame

355

and geographic area, which allowed us to restrict our analysis to a subset of 247 phylogenet-

356

ically related cases consisting of a single SARS-CoV-2 variant. Given the ∼200k inhabitants of

357

Basel-City, this implies one of the largest per-capita sequencing densities of reported studies

358

to date. We deliberately choose a simple way to incorporate socioeconomic, demographic and

359

mobility information into our compartmental model since more complex network approaches

360

would be unfeasible for limited case numbers. The use of mobility and socioeconomic data in

361

our models is unique since we include regularly collected data analysed by the statistical office

362

of Basel-City, providing a high spatial and temporal resolution network of the inner city mo-

363

bility patterns. In contrast to mobile phone data16, 19, 33, 38 our data is not subjected to privacy

364

legislation and is hence expected to be more readily available for other medium-sized urban

365

areas around the world, making our analysis transferable. We do not hold information on the

366

duration and specific location of individuals, but a continuum estimate of population mixing

367

that aligns well with the concept of a compartmental ODE model. Mobility and the reduction

368

thereof have been suggested as a proxy to evaluate the reduction of the spread of SARS-CoV-2

369

6, 38, 39

; however, there has also been a change in hygiene practices and social interaction be-

370

haviour. In our SEIR-model we separate these two contributions allowing for an easier transla-

371

tion of our model for scenario building. We further addressed unreported cases which were the

372

driving force of infection outside the observed clusters. Our 77% estimate of unreported cases

373

overall (not limited to B.1-C15324T) falls within the range of previous reports within Europe8, 40 .

374

The SEIR-model evaluates general trends of transmission, such as effective reproductive num-

375

bers, and vaccine scenario building. To complement this, we employ phylogenetic analysis

376

to identify transmission clusters. This comprehensive evaluation showed that socioeconomic

377

brackets characterized by low median income and smaller living space per person, were asso-

378

ciated with significantly larger effective reproductive numbers. In line with previous results33 ,

379

we suggest that population groups from a weaker socioeconomic background are more mobile

380

and at higher risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection/transmission originating from multiple sources via

381

cryptic transmission. This aligns with the possibility that low socioeconomic status may relate

382

to jobs requiring higher personal contact, and unavoidable mobility41 , which has been shown to

383

increase the risk of infection by 76%42 . By contrast, phylogenetic clusters were predominantly

384

discovered within higher socioeconomic, or more senior groups, implying a spread within the

385

same social network. It is likely that those individuals are retired, or have had the ability to work

386

from home, a pattern that has been observed also in other cities43 . Effective contact tracing and

387

testing strategies could be most efficient for these groups, which were not driving SARS-CoV-2

388

transmission.

389

These results should be accounted for during vaccine prioritization depending on the relevant

390

vaccine characteristics and ICU capacity available. Our simulation framework provides flexi-

391

bility to model various scenarios and vaccine efficacies but did not account for fatalities due to

392

limited case numbers during the studied period in Basel-City. In case of a combined effect of

393

vaccines to both prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission and protect against COVID-1944–46 , vaccina-

394

tion of individuals driving transmission in addition to the protection of high-risk groups would

395

be ideal to arrive at a combined concept of protection from and containment of SARS-CoV-2.

396

Vaccinating high-risk groups reduces the number of hospitalized and ICU patients in the short

397

term, the spread of the pandemic would however, be more effectively contained by vaccinating

398

the transmission drivers. By restricting vaccination to only risk groups, a larger fraction of the

399

general population will be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 implying that contact and travel restrictions

400

would remain necessary to contain transmission. Such measures come at great economic cost.

401

Based on our results it would be recommended to follow a combined strategy to employ exten-

402

sive testing where transmission chains are traceable, e.g. among less mobile population groups,

403

and to combine this with a vaccination strategy aiming to prevent cryptic transmission.

404

In conclusion, high-resolution city-level epidemiological studies are essential for understand-

405

ing factors affecting pandemic transmission chains and thereby supporting tailored public health
