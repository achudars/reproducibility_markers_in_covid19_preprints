ABSTRACT

43

Numerous SARS-CoV-2 rapid serological tests have been developed, but their accuracy has

44

usually been assessed using very few samples, and rigorous comparisons between these tests

45

are scarce. In this study, we evaluated and compared 10 commercially-available SARS-CoV-

46

2 rapid serological tests using the STARD methodology (Standards for Reporting of

47

Diagnostic Accuracy Studies). 250 sera from 159 PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients

48

(collected from 0 to 32 days after onset of symptoms) were tested with rapid serological tests.

49

Control sera (N=254) were retrieved from pre-COVID periods from patients with other

50

coronavirus

51

hyperglobulinemia (N=9), malaria (n=5), or no documented viral infection (N=226). All

52

samples were tested using rapid lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA) from ten manufacturers.

53

Only four tests achieved ≥98% specificity, with other tests ranging from 75.7%-99.2%.

54

Sensitivities varied by the day of sample collection, from 31.7%-55.4% (Days 0-9), 65.9%-

55

92.9% (Days 10-14), and 81.0%-95.2% (>14 days) after the onset of symptoms, respectively.

56

Only three tests evaluated met French Health Authorities’ thresholds for SARS-CoV-2

57

serological tests (≥90% sensitivity + ≥98% specificity). Overall, the performances between

58

tests varied greatly, with only a third meeting acceptable specificity and sensitivity thresholds.

59

Knowing the analytical performance of these tests will allow clinicians to use them with more

60

confidence, could help determine the general population’s immunological status, and may

61

diagnose some patients with false-negative RT-PCR results.

INTRODUCTION

65

Asymptomatic carriage of SARS-CoV-2 has been estimated in some studies to be as high as

66

86 (1). Others posit that it may be responsible for up to two-thirds of viral propagation (1-4).

67

As the world increasingly acknowledges the challenges this poses to disease containment,

68

reliable testing has become central to monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic, informing health

69

policy, rapidly responding to events as they evolve, and mitigating disease transmission (5, 6).

70

Yet, RT-PCR tests (Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction), the gold

71

standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection, have substantial limitations. PCR requires specialized,

72

expensive laboratory equipment, is often only located in laboratories with biosafety level ≥2,

73

and may be affected by sample transport delays of 2-3 days, in which time COVID-19

74

suspects may further expose other patients and health workers (7-9). For SARS-CoV-2, RT-

75

PCR testing also uses naso-pharyngeal swab samples that can be complex to obtain, pose

76

considerable risk to health care workers with insufficient personal protective equipment

77

(PPE), and produce false-negative results in up to 30 of confirmed COVID-19 patients (10-

78

12). Chest radiography (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans are currently used to

79

overcome PCR tests’ lack of sensitivity but also require expensive equipment (11, 13). These

80

challenges limit current molecular and imaging approaches’ ability to be scaled up in

81

epidemic settings where rapid, reliable, and easy population screening is needed.

82

Thus, serological confirmation of COVID-19 antibodies could provide an important

83

complementary tool to PCR testing by identifying previously exposed individuals (8, 12).

84

SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion occurs 7-14 days after the onset of symptoms (8, 14-16). A few

85

classic ELISA tests (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) are currently available, but

86

considerable effort has been made by manufacturers to offer even earlier rapid diagnostic tests

87

(RDTs) (17). According to the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), 177

88

SARS-CoV-2 antibody RDTs were commercially-available on June 15th, 2020 (18). Most

89

informations were directly submitted by test suppliers or obtained from publicly available

90

sources and were not independently verified. Neither their analytical performance nor their

91

usefulness in a clinical setting has yet been rigorously evaluated with a sufficient panel of

92

samples (19, 20). In addition, validation criteria seem to be different from one country to

93

another (21-23).

94

We carried out a retrospective clinical evaluation of ten commercially available RDTs,

95

comparing their performance, according to the delay between the onset of symptoms and

96

sampling, severity of the disease and usability of the tests. Our study was designed using the

97

2015 Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) (24). We aim to

98

provide accurate clinical performance data to assess the RDTs’ utility and their ability to be

99

integrated into adapted diagnostic algorithms across health systems and epidemiological

100

contexts, especially in areas with limited resources (24).

101
102

METHODS

103

Study design

104

We conducted a retrospective study on 250 serum samples collected between March 11 till

105

April 3rd from 159 patients, 256 sera with documented RT-PCR positive results for SARS-

106

CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swabs (eSwabs™-Virocult, Copan, Italy). Real-time RT-PCR

107

targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and E genes were used to detect the presence of

108

SARS-CoV-2 as described by Corman et al. (7).. All patients were from 2 University hospitals

109

located in the south of Paris (Bicêtre and Paul Brousse Hospitals) and provided between one

110

and four serum samples. Sera from COVID-19 patients were randomly selected and grouped

111

according to the time between onset of symptoms and patient’s blood sampling (0-9 days, 10-

112

14 days, and > 14 days) (Fig. 1A).

113

To assess specificity, an additional 254 sera collected prior to December 2019 were selected,

114

and which had previously been tested positive for a separate agent or pathology that could

115

potentially interfere with SARS-CoV-2 testing results, either other coronavirus (n=11), other

116

viral infections (n= 129), a rheumatoid factor (n=3), hyperglobulinemia IgG (n=6) and IgM

117

(n=3), malaria (n=5), or a Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay (TPHA) (n=97) (Fig.

118

1B).

119

Each RDT was evaluated on the same collection of sera. The minimum sample size was

120

calculated assuming an expected sensitivity of 90 (with 5 accuracy) and a specificity of 98

121

(with 2 accuracy), amounting to 250 true positive samples and 254 true negative samples

122

(power 0.80, alpha 0.05).

123
124

Sample preparation

125

Selected sera were randomly placed in working boxes so as not to bias technicians’

126

interpretation of results. Two sets of these boxes were prepared and stored at 4°C prior to

127

being used.

128
129

Selected Tests

130

Diagnostic tests were selected based on supply, expected performance (based on published

131

literature), and on commercial brochures. Ten RDTs that could detect either all antibodies or

132

specifically identified IgG or IgM (in blood, serum, or plasma) were evaluated: (RDT 1) NG-

The cumulative positivity at different points of illness (from symptom appearance until day

158

159

subsequent positive results on Days N+1, N+2, N-n, etc and (ii) a negative result on Day N

160

was preceded by negative results on Days N-1, N-2, N-n, etc. Details of the calculation are

161

presented in Figure S2.

162

Cumulative curves were fitted to an asymmetrical (five-parameter) logistic equation using

163

Graph Prism v6 (25). For comparative purposes, the point at which 50 cumulative positivity

164

was reached was calculated for all RDTs and expressed as the number of days post-symptom

165

onset (Fig. S3, Table 1).

166

The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated as

167

follows: PPV = (sensitivity x prevalence) / [ (sensitivity x prevalence) + ((1 – specificity) x (1

168

– prevalence)) ], and NPV = (specificity x (1 – prevalence)) / [ (specificity x (1 – prevalence))

169

+ ((1 – sensitivity) x prevalence) ].

170
171

Usability Evaluation

172

A self-administered user experience questionnaire using the Osgood scale was used for all

173

tests and focused on the clarity of the instructions for the test user, the test’s technical

174

complexity, the ease of test result interpretation, and access to legal information (26).

175
176

Ethics

177

All samples were from a Bio-bank (BIOCOVID-19) after having received ethical clearance

178

from the Patient Protection Committee (PPC) of the Ile-de-France VII (No. 2009-965). Blood

179

samples from patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, who were subjected to routine

180

testing as part of clinical management but whose serum samples had not been entirely used

181

for clinical purposes, were approved for use in this study. The biobank is stored in CRB Paris

182

South (BRIF: BB-0033-00089). The planning, conduct, and reporting of studies was in line

183

with the Declaration of Helsinki.

186

Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients

187

Overall, 250 sera collected from 159 COVID-19 patients were selected from the BIOCOVID-

188

19 Bio-bank. The median age was 62.9 years (range 12.8 - 97.6) and the male/female ratio

189

was 1.69 (100/59). Among these individuals, 4.4 (7/159) were discharged after their initial

190

visit to the emergency room (ER) and 95.6 (152/159) were hospitalized. Over the study

191

period, 44.1 (67/152) of patients required ICU care while hospitalized. The overall death rate

192

among hospitalized patients was 19.1 (29/152); 10.5 (9/85) among non-ICU patients and 29.9

193

(20/67) among ICU patients. Most sera were sampled on Days 0-15 (85.5, 219/256) after

194

symptoms appeared, though sera from later dates (up to Day 31) were also available (Fig.

195

1A).

196
197

Test Performance

198

Cumulative positivity rate rose with time, reaching 100 at 20-days post-symptom onset for all

199

RDTs (Fig. 2). More than 50 of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients had detectable antibodies 7 to

200

10 days after symptoms appeared (Fig. 2). The time needed to reach >95 sensitivity varied

201

between 14 days (for half of the RDTs tested) and 18 days (for RDT 6) (Fig. 2).

202

Asymmetrical (five-parameter) logistic analysis demonstrated that 50 cumulative positivity

203

(or the median time for seroconversion) varied from 7.0 to 9.6 days (Table 1).

204

As expected, overall test sensitivity was highest 15 days after the appearance of symptoms

205

(Table 2), with all RDTs reaching >90 sensitivity at that point, except for RDT 6 and RDT 8

206

(81.0 and 88.5, respectively). For the 8 RDTs able to differentiate between IgM and IgG,

207

combined detection significantly increased overall test sensitivity with the exception of RDT

208

1, RDT 4 and RDT 5 (for which IgM detection seemed to be nearly as sensitive as IgM + IgG

209

detection) (Table 2).

210

Specificities, calculated with sera recovered from patients between 2017 and early 2019,

211

ranged from 75.7 to 99.2. Only four tests (RDT 1, RDT 4, RDT 5 and RDT 9), reached the

212

>98 threshold recommended by the French Health Authorities for serological diagnostic tests

213

(Table 2) (23). The presence of a rheumatoid factor did not induce false positive results

214

except in the case of the RDT 3, which systematically gave a positive IgM (3/3) and/or IgG

215

(1/3) signal. Among the 11 sera with a non-SARS-CoV-2 agent (other coronaviruses) four

216

tests produced one false positive result and one test produced two false positives. Notably, the

217

false positives occurring in non-SARS-CoV-2 agent samples corresponded to one serum

218

recovered from the same patient. No other patterns were detected for other false positive

219

results (Table S2). The concordance between all tests varied from 77.0 to 96.4 except in the

220

case of the RDT 8 test that had a lower concordance with other RDTs (<80). Other RDTs

221

gave concordant results (usually ~90 to 95) (Fig. 3).

222

The positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV respectively) describe the

223

performance of a diagnostic test. A high result can be interpreted as indicating the accuracy of

224

such a test. The PPV and NPV are not intrinsic to the test (as true positive rate and true

225

negative rate are) but they depend also on the prevalence. As the prevalence increases, the

226

PPV also increases but the NPV decreases. Similarly, as the prevalence decreases the PPV

227

decreases while the NPV increases. As a consequence, having both VPN and PPV above a

228

certain value can be quite challenging. Among the 10 RDTs evaluated only three presented

229

PPV and NPVs above 95 over a large window of population prevalence (RDT1, RDT 4, and

230

RDT9) (Fig. S4).

231
232

Band intensity

233

To compare the ease of reading the RDTs’ banded results, the intensity of the reaction line

234

was recorded according to 3 gradations: No signal (0), very weak but definitively positive (1),

235

and medium to high intensity (2). As shown in Figure 4, the overall ease of reading was

236

highest for sera recovered >14-days after the appearance of symptoms. Band intensity was

237

most prominent in tests with combined antibody detection (i.e. both IgM and IgG detection;

238

RDT 9 and RDT 10 tests) (Fig. 4A). Among the eight RDTs that differentiated between

239

antibody types, IgM band intensity was most pronounced with RDT 1 test (Fig. 4B), with

240

RDT 3, RDT 4 and RDT 5 tests closely following. Conversely, IgM bands obtained with the

241

RDT 6, RDT 7, RDT 8 and, to a lesser extent, the RDT 2 tests were significantly less

242

pronounced (Fig.e 4B). For IgG tests, the bands produced by the RDT 1, RDT 2, RDT 3,

243

RDT 7 and RDT 8 tests were more prominent than the RDT 4, RDT 5 and RDT 6 tests (Fig.

244

4C).

245
246

Ease-of-Use

247

All the tests were in cassette form and nearly all devices used standard colloidal gold antigen

248

conjugated particles (Table S1). One test (RDT 9) used fluorescent antigen conjugated

249

particles for visualisation using a specific reader. Ease-of-use could vary from one test to

250

another, and all contained ‘Instructions For User’ (IFU) manuals that were in all cases

251

considered easy to understand (Table S3). Only RDT 9’s IFU did not provide figures

252

explaining their methods or results interpretation. Most (6/10) IFUs contained figures

253

explaining their methods and results interpretation, and 3/10 IFUs contained figures

254

explaining results interpretation (Table S3). No users reported difficulty using the RDTs,

255

though the RDT 2 test provided a dropper with no clear instruction as to how many drops

256

should be used. Buffer for RDT 9 was included with every test tube. Less than half of the

257

RDTs (RDT 1, RDT 3, RDT 4, and RDT 5) included single-use plastic pipettes or similar

258

devices for transferring samples into the test wells. No users reported difficulties identifying

259

sample and buffer wells. All tests’ results interpretation, with the exception of RDT 6, were

260

considered easy. The recommended time-to-read results ranged from 10-20 minutes (Table

261

S1). From a packaging and legal point of view, all manufacturers except RDT 6 respected the

262

CE-IVD regulation to describe needed storage conditions in the IFU, on test packaging, and in

263

product references. RDT 6’s reference test was not found on the box nor within the IFU. All

264

tests were in a single, sealed package and included a desiccant pouch.

265
266

DISCUSSION

267

With no curative medications currently available for COVID-19 and vaccines in early stages

268

of development, social distancing and widespread testing have become the primary tools

269

available to control an unprecedented global health crisis. Serological assays and RDTs are

270

being increasingly used across the world to address other tests’ limitations, but most

271

commercially available RDTs have had their accuracy verified on only a small number of sera

272

without including negative samples to evaluate cross-reactivity. Moreover, their usefulness

273

for patient management in active hospital settings and among the general public has almost

274

never been rigorously evaluated (27, 28). By demonstrating the feasibility and accuracy of

275

rapid serological immunoassays with a substantially more robust sample size than has

276

previously been described, we add depth to the evolving conversation surrounding SARS-

277

CoV-2 testing strategies. We hope that knowing the analytical performance of nearly a dozen

278

commercially available tests, and by providing comparative detail, we will allow clinicians to

279

select and use these tests with more confidence and certainty.

280

This study is, to our knowledge, the first to compare diagnostic performance and time-to-

281

seropositivity in nearly a dozen SAR-CoV-2 RDTs using a large sample size (250 selected

282

samples each for specificity and sensitivity, more than double other peer-reviewed, published

283

RDT evaluations). Other studies evaluating antibody tests have also not included samples

284

from patients with non-SARS-CoV-2 infections to evaluate specificity.

285

Overall, after the appearance of symptoms, seroconversion occurred on Days 7-9 for 50 of

286

COVID positive patients (Table 1), with >95 seroconverting after 14 days using RDT 1,

287

RDT3, RDT 4, RDT 9 and RDT 10) and 18 days for RDT 6) (Fig. 2). The specificities ranged

288

from 94.5-99.2, except for RDT 8 test (75.7). Notably, the RDT 3 test produced systematic

289

false positive results with sera of patients who had a high level of rhumatoid factor (Table

290

S2).

291

Thresholds for sensitivity and specificity for RDTs have been set by many National

292

Health Authorities (21-23). For diagnosis in symptomatic patients, high sensitivity is required

293

(generally ≥90), while specificity is less critical as some false-positives may be tolerated as

294

other potential diagnoses are considered in parallel (RT-PCR and/or CT scans). However, if

295

LFIAs were deployed as an individual-level approach to inform release from quarantine or

296

immune-protection, then high specificity (>98) is essential, as false-positive results return

297

non-immune individuals to risk of exposure (23). Using the French health authority [21]

298

acceptable limits for SARS-CoV-2 serological tests (≥90 sensitivity; ≥98 specificity) our

299

evaluation validated only three RDTs for clinical use, namely NG-Test IgG-IgM COVID-19

300

(RDT 1, NG-Biotech), NADAL® COVID-19 IgG/IgM Test (RDT4, Nal Von Minden GmBH)

301

and Finecare SARS-CoV2 Antibody test (RDT 9, Guangzhou Wondfo biotech).

302

Appraisal of test performance should also consider the influence of population

303

prevalence, as it may change over time, geography and within different population groups.

304

The potential risk of a test providing false positive results is crucial for release from lock-

305

down of non-immune individuals. Among the 10 RDTs evaluated only three presented PPV

306

and NPVs above 95 over a large window of population prevalence (RDT1, RDT 4, and

307

RDT9).

308

These serological tests were able to independently diagnose COVID-19, especially in

309

those with ≥2 weeks of symptoms, and could be used to triangulate unclear or false negative

310

results from PCR and CT testing. They could also be used to monitor the status of medical

311

and non-medical frontline workers and, over the longer term, to establish population level

312

immunity as countries’ social restrictions ease. In the US (Santa Clara County, California)

313

rapid antibody tests were used to evaluate the population prevalence of antibodies (ranging

314

from 2.49-4.16) and helped authorities to understand that infection was far more widespread

315

(55-fold) than indicated by the number of confirmed cases. These data are crucial to calibrate

316

epidemic and mortality projections (29).

317

Among the three RDTs fulfilling the French health authorities’ criteria, only NG-Test

318

IgG-IgM COVID-19 (NG-Biotech) might be considered a self-test since it includes all

319

materials needed for self-puncture and capillary blood recovery. Nevertheless, we only

320

authenticated this using serum, since its use has been previously established in capillary

321

whole blood and our results in serum confirm those of the initial study (30). Namely, that this

322

bedside fingerprick test confirmed infection in <15 minutes and could be performed by a

323

medical practitioner without specialized training or a pathology laboratory (30).

324

Our study is limited in the following ways: (1) RT-PCR detection was based on upper

325

respiratory tract specimens from patients with severe symptoms. None were asymptomatic

326

patients (who did not access care). (2) Most study participants’ diagnoses were based on

327

positive findings from an RT-PCR test using respiratory samples. Patients with negative RT-

328

PCR results but with chest imaging compatible with COVID-19 were not included. (3)

329

Because the epidemic situation in France was very recent at the time of study, samples were

330

collected during the acute phase of illness. Accordingly, we do not yet have sera from later

331

stages to evaluate antibody persistence. (4) Only 10 out of more than 170 available RDTs

332

have been evaluated.

333

The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed gaps in our diagnostic arsenal and is highlighting the

334

essential role of serodiagnostics in public health response (31). With the use of carefully

335

verified assays, appropriately designed serologic studies will help characterize transmission

336

dynamics, refine disease burden estimates, diagnose suspected cases, and confirm clinically

337

diagnosed patients without access to RT-PCR testing.

338

Though this assessment demonstrates varied analytical performance across a sample of

339

current SARS-CoV-2 RDTs, they nevertheless hold real utility as tool for establishing

340

population level exposure: many people have been exposed more than 3 weeks prior to

341

antibody testing and would benefit from the nearly 100 sensitivity (in all tests evaluated) after

342

3 weeks’ time. However, highly sensitive (as early as 7 days) and specific tests are needed,

343

both to achieve sufficiently high positive predictive values since population prevalence is

344

often estimated to be low (≤5), and to be clinically useful as an initial diagnostic assay and a

345

complement to direct RNA testing. Only three of the evaluated assays met the thresholds

346

needed (sensitivity of >90 at 14 days after symptom appearance and >98 specificity).

347

Serological assays are simple, cheap, rapid, easy to interpret, and practical (can be stored at

348

room temperature). They detect IgM, IgG, or both and can be performed directly at a patient’s

349

bedside, at a general physician’s office, or when triaging in an emergency department, as

350

most have been validated using whole blood.
