Abstract
Aims: We investigate a range of studies related to COVID-19 with focus on scientific
evidence reporting the main diagnosis and treatments of the disease. Main Methods:
Scoping review conducted in the databases, MEDLINE, Cochrane, Embase, LILACS,
Scopus, and Web of Science, and the gray Google Scholar literature, until May 2020.
We follow PRISMA-SCR and the recommendations of the Joanna Briggs Institute. The
identified studies were independently selected by peers. The qualitative data extracted
were synthesized and organized into categories, and the quantitative data were
generated through descriptive and inferential statistics. Key-findings: 6060 articles
were identified, of which 30 were included in this review. The publications are
predominantly from China (n=22, 73.3%), and with a type of cross-sectional study
(n=12, 40.0%), followed by a cohort (n=7, 23.0%). Among them, 16 studies addressed
the

diagnosis,

and

computed

tomography was considered

as

non-invasive

complementary method for detecting and evaluating the progression of COVID-19.
Laboratory tests have been used to detect enzymatic or viral activities, and to monitor
the inflammation associated with COVID-19. 14 studies included different therapeutic
associations, such as Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r) and Arbidol, Hydroxychloroquine,
Azithromycin,

Tocilizumab and Remdesivir,

and

Corticosteroids/Plasminogen.

Significance: The evidence related to diagnostic methods are clear, and include
tomography and laboratory tests. Medicinal or associated medications for the treatment
of COVID-19, although showing a reduction in signs and COVID-19-related symptoms,
can cause adverse effects of mild or severe intensity depending on viral load and
inflammatory activity. Additional studies should be performed to identify the most
reliable treatment for COVID-19.
Keywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, infection, diagnosis, treatment.

Introduction
The current pandemic experienced globally, beginning in the city of Wuhan,

China, at the end of 2019, is caused by a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2, the
disease being named COVID-19. Coronavirus is a family of viruses that cause
respiratory diseases in humans, from the common cold to diseases such as Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which
resulted in high mortality rates in 2003y and 2012y, respectively [1]. To date, the
disease has affected more than 27 million individuals in 216 countries, areas, or
territories, culminating in more than 890 thousand confirmed deaths throughout the
world. According to the number of cases, the most affected regions are the regions of
the Americas, Southeast Asia, and Europe [1].
The main signs and symptoms of COVID-19 are multiple and include fever
(83% -99%), cough (59% -82%), fatigue (44% -70%), decreased appetite (40% -84%),
dyspnoea (31% -40%), myalgia (11% -35%), as well as other less specific symptoms
involving the sore throat, nasal congestion, headache, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting,
loss of olfactory sensitivity or taste [2]. In addition to the signs and symptoms, the
diagnosis of COVID-19 are often performed by two methods: the molecular test and the
serological test. The molecular test, known as RT-PCR, identifies the presence of the
virus during the acute phase of the disease, and the serological test, also known as the
rapid test, checks the antibody response of a given individual after days to weeks,
indicating that the person has already been infected with SARS-CoV2. However, there
are still uncertainties regarding the tests currently used with regard to sensitivity,
specificity, and the ability to assess cross-reactivity with other types of coronavirus,
such as SARS-CoV and MERS [1].
Regarding the available treatments, the agentes or compounds most often
mentioned as “possible healing agents” are chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and
azithromycin; however, the evidence is insufficient to indicate the use of a particular
drug, alone or combined, during the treatment of COVID-19, and its use may be
associated with more adverse effects than benefits. Following the incessant rush in
searching for an effective treatment, several studies have adopted dubious measures in
relation to the scientific robustness, in order to justify their clinical use [2].

Methods
We performed a scoping review to map the existing evidence in the literature on

a given topic, published from different designs and study methodologies, as
recommended by Aromataris [3]; in this review, we look at the diagnosis and treatment
of COVID-19. This review followed five of six stages described in the framework of
Aromataris [3], which was subsequently improved by Levac and collaborators [4], and
recommended by Strumillo [5], namely: identifying the research question; identifying
relevant studies; study selection; charting the data; collating, summarizing and reporting
the results, and consultation (optional). The sixth stage of consulting the framework was
not carried out.

2.1 Identifying the research question
The research questions were constructed from the elements of the PCC Population (adults and elderly), Concept (diagnosis and treatment), and Context
(COVID-19). The review questions explored in this study were: What types of
diagnostic tests and drug treatments are available for adults and the elderly with
COVID-19?

2.2 Identifying relevant studies
A systematic search was carried out between 14 and 15 May 2020, in seven
electronic databases: MEDLINE (access via PubMed), Cochrane, Embase, Cumulative
Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Latin American
Bibliographic Information (LILACS), Scopus and Web of Science (WoS), and in gray
literature: Google Scholar. The search strategies adopted the terms: “diagnostic”,
“treatment”, “laboratory techniques”, “COVID-19” and “SARS-CoV-2”, which were
combined by Boolean operators “AND” and “OR” and were adapted according to each
database. The filters used were: literature with human beings, in English, Spanish or
Portuguese, complete articles, and published between the period from December 1,
2019, to May 15, 2020. Table 1 illustrates the complete search strategy carried out at
PUBMED.

2.3 Study selection
This review followed the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyzes extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR),
according to the stages of identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion of studies
[6]. The stage of identification of the studies was carried out by three researchers
together (S-AR, C-AB, and BM-C), and resulted in 6,060 articles, of which 190 were
duplicated. The identified studies were organized in the Software State of the Art
through Systematic Review (StArt), which contributed to the selection, screening, and
extraction of data, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were widely discussed among the
researchers. Results of primary and secondary evidence, from the adult population over
18 years old, who presented methods of diagnosing COVID-19 and/or treating COVID19 were included. The studies involving partial results on COVID-19, technical notes,

preliminary reports, editorials, single case studies, approaches with a primary focus on
pathophysiology, microbiology, or biochemistry were excluded.
The articles were screened based on two stages. In the first stage, an independent
review was carried out by six pairs of researchers to reduce the potential bias (S-AR and
AL; C-AB and C-CFR; DC and BM-C; M-EC and S -FRF; C-LGA and S-HS; M-AT
and M-MF). A form for selection, sorting, and data extraction was developed in the
StArt software and pre-tested by the researchers. Each researcher individually evaluated
980 titles and articles abstracts, approximately, regarding the inclusion or exclusion
criteria, with subsequent issuance of the "accepted" or "rejected" opinion. Those articles
that had no abstract available, their full text was accessed for screening. In cases where
there was disagreement between the researchers of the pair, the article was referred to a
third reviewer.
A total of 711 articles were eligible to read the full text. Kappa reliability,
interobserver agreement was used. In the second stage of the screening, eleven
independent researchers (S-AR; AL; C-AB; C-CFR; DC; M-EC; S-FRF; C-LGA; S-HS;
M-AT; M-MF) performed the complete reading of the eligible articles. To reduce
possible biases, five researchers (S-AR; A-L; C-AB; M-AT; C-CFR), together,
evaluated the articles considered eligible. Everyone came together during this process to
resolve the uncertainties related to the selection of the study. A total of 30 articles were
finally included.

2.4 Charting the data
The form developed in the StArt software helped to extract data, such as country
and year of publication, study design (descriptive, cross-sectional, case-control, cohort,
ecological, randomized, quasi-experimental trial, systematic review, integrative review,
or scoping review), confirmation of COVID-19 by laboratory tests (PCR and/or rapid
test) and/or diagnostic imaging (X-ray, ultrasound, tomography and/or resonance), type
of treatment of COVID-19 (antimalarial, anti-inflammatory, convalescent plasma,
anticoagulant, antibiotic, corticoid, antiretroviral and/or others), drug name, dosage,
efficacy (cure, death, clinical improvement, treatment change or ineffectiveness), results
and outcomes, conclusions and/or recommendations.

2.5 Collating, summarizing and reporting the results

The extracted qualitative data were synthesized and organized into three
categories, characterization of the included studies, diagnoses used for the detection of
COVID-19, and associated treatments. Quantitative data regarding the geographic
location of the literature and the type of approach, whether COVID-19 diagnosis and
treatment or both, were georeferenced using ArcGIS Software version 10.6. The other
data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, with the support of SPSS software
version 20.0.

3.

Results
According to the PRISMA statement, we initially selected 6.060 published

articles. Among them, 190 articles were duplicated and finally excluded, resulting in
5.870 papers for the initial screening. After a careful screening and based on the scopus
of the research, a total of 711 papers were included for full reading. Following the
eligibility criteria, 30 papers were then adopted for the analysis (Figure 1). This study is
presented in three categories as follows: characterization of the included studies,
diagnoses used for the detection of COVID-19 and associated treatments.

3.1 Characterization of the included studies
After analyzing the spatial distribution of publications associated with COVID19 in the world, it was noted that, until the time of data collection, there were few
countries that had developed studies on the treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19. In
Figure 2 we can verify that, the stronger the color degradation, the greater the
publications and, in those countries in which they were not painted, there was no study
available in the databases. The Figure 3 shows the publications related to diagnosis (n=
16; 53.33%) and treatments (n = 14; 46.67%). Therefore, China was the country that
developed the most studies focusing in both diagnosis and treatment (n = 22; 73.33%)
followed by France (n = 2; 6.67%); the Japan, Switzerland, Italy, Qatar, and India had
one study published.

3.2 General characteristics of the included articles published in journals
All articles were peer-reviewed and published in 2020 (from january to late
may). Of note, four articles (13.3%) were published in the Journal of Medical Virology,
two articles (6.6%) in the Journal of infection and in Radiology, respectively; the other
articles were included in different journals. A number of important and specific types of
studies were included in this review, and the most prevalent was the Cross-sectional (n
= 12, 40.0%), followed by Cohort (n= 7, 23.0%), Systematic Review (n= 3, 10, 0%) and
Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial and Case-Control, both with totaling n = 3
(10.0%). The most used data base included Pubmed, Embase, and Web of Science
(Figure 4 A) and based on data extraction we only accepted 4% of the total articles
(Figure 4 B). The Figure 4 C depicts the arrangements of authors included in the
scoping review. Using the number of appearance, we showed main location of
publications (Figure 4 D); the amount of representative words were COVID-19,
patients, and disease (Figure 4 E), and main descriptors were human, adult, article and
female pandemic (Figure 4 F).

3.3 Diagnostics used to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection
From these 30 articles, the majority of articles addressed the main subject “The

or CT? [7]

To evaluate the
diagnostic value of
computed tomography
(CT) and real-time
reverse transcriptasepolymerase (rRT-PCR)
chain reaction for
COVID-19 pneumonia

RRT-PCR can produce
initial false-negative
results. It is suggested
that patients with typical
computed tomography
findings, but with
negative rRT-PCR
results should be
isolated, and rRT-PCR
should be repeated to
avoid diagnostic errors

CT was considered as the sensitivity factor for the detection of COVID-19,
resulting in percentages above 90.0% (ID: 1830, 26171 and 26115). Based on CT and
clinical manifestations, it is possible to distinguish patients with pneumonia presenting

COVID-19 or not (ID: 26301). There was a predictive capacity regarding the
tomography resources. After analyzing the 1st and 4th days after admission, it is easy to
predict early and non-invasively the progression to severe disease, providing a
promising prognostic indicator for the clinical management of COVID -19 (ID: 27120).
When analyzing the tomography images, most patients had peripheral lesion
distribution (ID: 2045, 16332, 16386, 26301, 26904), as well as ground glass density
foci (ID: 2045, 16332, 16386, 26301, 26904, 42956). There was also an association
with advanced age, resulting in higher case number and in greater complexity of the
pathology (ID: 16332, 26115 and 27120).

3.3.2 Diagnostics by laboratory tests
We observed that the serological samples showed sensitivities to the IgM and
IgG antibodies for the diagnosis of COVID-19 (ID: 16399 and 16526). In addition to an
important sensitivity rate of 71.1% (ID: 16526) and 100% and 90.9%, the detection rate
of positive IgG was higher than IgM (ID: 16399). Another study documented that a
combination of CT and immunochromatographic assay could be complementary, since
this combination presents a sensitivity rate of 82.4% in symptomatic cases; it should be
emphasized that due to the low sensitivity (ID: 24982), the collection of isolated
immunochromatography is not recommended for initial testing.
Three studies evaluated the RT-PCR (ID: 1980, 42996 and 26805). After
analyzing the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR of the viral nucleic acid in a
population of 4,880 patients, the positive rate was 38% (n = 1875) and the samples of
nasal and pharyngeal swabs (n = 4818) had a positivity rate of 38.25% and 49.12% in
sputum, thus showing an important role in the identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection
(ID: 1980).
When assessing the accuracy of laboratory parameters in predicting cases with
RT-PCR, a total of 200 cases (n = 70; 35%) were positive; they revealed significantly
higher number of neutrophil (NEU) (p = 0.0001) and changes in the serum levels of Creactive protein (PCR) (p = 0.04), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.0001), aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) (p = 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p = 0, 0001) and
urea (p = 0.001). They also had lower white blood cell (leukocyte) count (p = 0.0001)
and serum albumin level (p = 0.0001). Of note, LDH, CRP, ALT and NEU may be used

to predict the result of the COVID-19 test, thus providing us a more precise detection
method (ID: 42996).
An interesting study sought to compare two groups of patients with positive
rRT-PCR results (positive group) and 102 patients with negative rRT-PCR results
(negative group), and it was indicated a strong association between COVID-19-positive
patients with a low blood leukocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils),
lymphocytes and monocytes in the positive rRT-PCR group. Finally, elevation in
activities of pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes, AST and ALT were also
observed in the positive group (ID: 26805).

3.4 Treatments used to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection
We registered and included 14 articles regarding the COVID-19 treatment as
the main subject. The most common treatments included the Lopinavir/Ritonavir
(LPV/r),

Arbidol,

Hydroxychloroquine,

Azithromycin,

Corticosteroids,

and

Plasminogen as therapeutic forms (Table 3).

3.4.1 Lopinavir / Ritonavir (LPV/r) and Arbidol
The studies that reported the effect of using Lopinavir / Ritonavir (LPV/r)
pointed to several controversies and uncertainties about the effectiveness of the
combination added to the standard treatment in people with Covid-19 (ID: 2099, 16445,
1897 and 26401). Regarding the use of adjuvant drugs associated with pneumonia
alone, the treatment with LPV/r showed a more evident therapeutic effect in reducing
symptoms such as body temperature and in restoring normal physiological mechanisms.
These therapeutic regimens showed no evident toxic/side effects and presented
improvements in relation to laboratory results; they acted by reducing the abnormal
proportion of white blood cells, lymphocytes, and C-reactive protein in COVID-19infected patients (ID: 1897). Considering the mortality rate in 28 days, both standard
and combined treatment (LPV / r) were similar (19.2% vs. 25.0%; 95% CI). In addition,
some adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were more common in
patients treated with LPV / r (ID: 2099).
A systematic review identified that administration of LPV/r compared to
standard treatment did not show a significant difference in the time of clinical
improvement (ID: 26401 and 16445), although the treated group showed the shorter
time. Notably, the LPV/r-treated group displayed a lower mortality (ID: 16445) than
that of standard treatment. The review highlights two studies describing a possible
protective effect of LPV/r as profilaxis after viral exposure. In a cohort study, no
differences were found between LPV/r-treated group and the standard treatment for the
controlo of pneumonia and clinical results (ID: 26401).
Other articles described the effect of Arbidol and LPV/r (ID: 16533, 26717),
one of which evaluated the association of Arbidol and LPV/r compared to those treated
with LPV / r only (ID: 16533) while other evaluated the combination of LPV/r with
Arbidol monotherapy (ID: 26717). Both articles showed better results for the groups
that either used Arbidol, in combination with LPV/r or even used as monotherapy.
When comparing the use of Arbidol + LPV/r with isolated LPV/r, it was observed that
chest CT images improved in 69.0% of patients who used the combination Arbidol +
LPV. Furthermore, the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples after
seven days of treatment was reduced in the group using the triple combination.
By investigating these compounds affecting the viral loading, the authors
demonstrated a 100.0% reduction in the detection of viral load after 14 days of

admission in patients treated with Arbidol (n = 16); otherwise, in the group treated with
LPV/r (n = 34), the viral load was found in 44.1% of patients (ID: 26717). On the other
hand, a cohort that evaluated the use of monotherapy with Arbidol found no clinical
efficacy when compared with patients treated only for their symptoms (ID: 26401). This
same study observed no improvements in pulmonary images or in the average length of
hospital stay after combining with other antivirals (Arbidol + Ritonavir or Interferon +
LPV/r or Interferon + Darunavir).

3.4.2 Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin
Patients treated with Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (ID: 26402) demonstrated a
reduction in radiological progression of the disease compared to conventional treatment
(OR for radiological disease progression during treatment was 0.31; 95% CI, [0, 110.9]). In addition to these results, there were signs of benefits of HCQ over time for
normalizing body temperature while reducing the number of days of dry coughing.
Through comparison of patients treated with HCQ and the controls (treated with
conventional treatment), no expressive differences in virological cure (OR, 2.37, 95%
CI, 0.13-44.53), death or clinical worsening of the disease (OR, 1.37, 95% CI, 1, 3721.97) and safety (OR, 2.19, 95% CI, 0.59-8.18) was observed. Coversely, a clinical
trial (ID: 26112) demonstrated a significant reduction or elimination of viral load; after
six days of treatment inclusion, 70% of the patients were cured virologically compared
to the control group (12.5%, p = 0.001).
Regarding the adverse effects of HCQ, a total of seven events were identified
in the systematic review and included nausea, diarrhea, abnormal liver function, skin
rash and headache; however, when these results were combined and analyzed, no
significant difference was observed between the two arms (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, [0.598.18]) (ID: 26402). Other relevant studies investigated the combinatory effect of HCQ
with Azithromycin (ID: 26402 and 26112), and according to the systematic review, five
studies reported both the safety and the effectiveness of this combination (ID: 26402).
More importantly, the clinical trial showed that after five days of treatment with HCQ +
Azithromycin, 100.0% of the patients presented with virological cure compared with
50.0% in those treated with HQC alone and 18.8% in the control group (p = 0.002) (ID:
26112).

3.4.3 Tocilizumab e Remdesivir
Three articles reported the use of Tocilizumab in people with COVID-19 (ID:
25217; 25243 and 26251) and concluded that treatment with Tocilizumab significantly
reduced the proportion of patients on invasive mechanical ventilation (ID: 25217 and
25243) and the number of death outcome and admissions to the Intensive Care Unit (ID:
25217). In addition, there was a significant reduction in C-reactive protein levels and
benefits in decreasing inflammatory activity (ID: 26251). The adverse events associated
with Tocilizumab were anemia, increased alanine aminotransferase and prolonged QT
interval (ID: 25243).
Regarding the use of Remdesivir, no time difference was observed until
clinical improvement (risk ratio 1 23 [95% CI 0 87-1 75]). In addition, the adverse
events were reported in 66% of treated patients, being the most described as
constipation, hypoalbuminemia, hypokalemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and increased
total bilirubin. Although not significant, the time to clinical improvement was faster for
patients using Remdesivir (ID: 26988)

3.4.4 Corticosteroids and Plasminogen
By evaluating the efficacy of corticosteroids (Methylprednisolone) used in the
treatment of COVID-19, it was not possible to verify an association between the
treatment and the time of virus elimination, length of hospitalization or duration of
symptoms. In fact, patients treated with corticosteroids had more clinical symptoms, a
higher rate of inflammation and several abnormalities on chest tomography (ID: 26211).
The inhalation of freeze-dried plasminogen was also evaluated in patients with COVID19 and the main results for clinically moderate patients included improvements in lung
injury conditions and reduction in the heart frequency; patients with more severe
conditions tends to show better oxygen saturation (ID: 25876). This may be effective
and efficient in the treatment of lung injuries and hypoxemia during infections by
SARS-CoV-2.

Discussion
We conducted a scope review of COVID-19, thoroughly researching databases

and other sources based on the geographic distribution of publications until May 2020,
and, China was the country with the largest number of publications related to COVID-

19. Our scoping review consistently evaluated important studies that emerged during
the first semester in an attempt to explore what is expected in terms of diagnosis and
treatment. Facing this challenge, we incorporated several study types and research areas,
with special attention to the randomised controlled trials and cohort studies, which were
non-existent before early February.
To date, the main diagnostic methods described included CT imaging and
laboratory testing. It is assumed that imaging methods are effective to differentiate the
degree and the involvement of the respiratory organs by the virus following patients
stratification with various ages. In fact, the great majority of studies performed in
hospitals and specialized clinics were dedicated to explore CT findings. Likewise, the
laboratory tests using serum or nasopharyngeal samples of patients are widely used to
detect produced antibodies, enzymatic activities or the viral counterparts. It seems true
that the combination of CT images with RT-PCR provide a more realistic framework to
detect the SARS-CoV-2 infection with disease aggravation. Other important parameters
that should be taken into consideration after viral infection confirmation are the number
of inflammatory and immune cells in association with the levels of PCR, LDH, AST,
ALT, albumin, and urea.
The research topics found in the articles/studies had both similarities and
differences. Basic research was mostly settled on correlating the COVID-19 diagnosis
with altered parameters and molecular signatures in a number of tissues and systems;
for the current scoping, this was often filtered out so that we only adopt research on
healthy patients to avoid sampling bias.
It seems true that SARS-CoV-2 has also been detected in non-respiratory
specimens, including blood, ocular fluids, stool, and semen; however, if these sites
predispose to the transmission is still unclear [37–41]. Although the detection of SARSCoV-2 RNA in blood has also been recently reported not all studies have tested it
[42,43]. Our review did not retrieve studies on detection of short- and long-term risks of
reinfection. Despite the recent data on individuals tested for reinfection exists and
follows a distinct paradigm [44,45], it is important to employ a combination of
strategies, i.e., images and blood dosages, to map these immunological differences.
This review may provide to other researchers identification of contradictory
results and research gaps allowing future approaches to fill it. Notably, an integrative
review matching the diagnostic methods with personal parameters throughout disease

evolution would be of great value. The reviews and short reports generally provide
generic information of the virus, transmission, and treatments. A recent scoping review
(from 01 december to 06 February) described in detail the evidence for the development
of clinical practice guidelines and public health policies [46]; in that time, the authors
had few clinical research available. In this sense, our scoping review may add
significant contribution to this study since it was centered in clinical practice advances
and in medical management of hospitalized patients. On one hand, our scoping review
has weakness regarding few studies and variability of methods and reported data. On
the other hand, all studies have many strengths as they were well-conducted using large
sample size and with high potential for reproducibility.
The effectiveness of the treatments for COVID-19 are still controversial and
open for tireless debate. Based on our scoping review, different drugs were tested, ones
with better outcomes than others. During the period we evaluated the studies, there were
no therapeutic regimen with specific dosage or duration that can be applied to every
patient; so far, a vaccine is not available. We now summarize and discuss the main
results about the treatments we have surveyed.
Patients treated with the HIV combined therapy Lopinavir (PubChem CID:
92727) and Ritonavir (PubChem CID: 392622) had improved laboratory results, but the
mortality rate did not differ between LPV/r and the standard protocol (ID: 26401 and
16445). Besides, the certainty of the evidence of randomized and observational studies
were frequently low. Corroborating this issue, a randomized, controlled, open-label trial
with 199 adult patients found no additional benefits with LPV/r treatment compared to
standard supportive care alone, i.e., oxygen and vasopressor support, antibiotics, renalreplacement therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Also, after 28 days of
the combined treatment the viral RNA loads or duration of viral RNA detectability were
similar between patients in the LPV/r and in the standard care group [11]. On the other
hand, studies evaluating the combination of LPV/r with Arbidol (PubChem CID:
31411) or Arbidol monotherapy had distinct outcome (ID: 16533, 26717), making
Arbidol, also known as Umifenovir, a promising repurposed candidate to treat COVID19. In a small cohort with 67 patients admitted with abnormal chest CT findings,
Arbidol treatment tended to increase the discharging rate and reduced mortality [47]. To
confirm the efficacy of the treatment with Arbidol there is an ongoing randomized,
open, multicenter clinical trial scheduled to publish its outcomes in December of the

current year (NCT04260594). Anyway, the findings of our review lead us to believe
that the combination of Lopinavir, Ritonavir and Arabidol may help in delaying the
progression of lung injuries while decreasing the likelihood of respiratory and
gastrointestinal transmission, and avoiding long-standing hospitalization as well.
However, we do not rule out the need for new randomized, multicenter research with
larger samples.
Although chloroquine (PubChem CID:3652) and its safer derivative,
hydroxychloroquine (PubChem CID:3652) have already a well-documented history for
coping malaria and inflammatory autoimmune disease, these drugs are under the
spotlight of a heated debate about their safety, efficacy and cost benefit for the treatment
of COVID-19. For the sake of contextualize hydroxychloroquine has a more potent in
vitro activity, i.e., lower EC50, and is more effective than chloroquine for both
prophylaxis and treatment [48]. The study by Sarma and colleagues demonstrated that
HCQ improved the radiologic findings, shortened the periods of fever and dry
coughing, however, it was not observed significantly difference in the viral clearance
compared to the control group. A prospective randomized study of 30 patients in China
showed that after seven days receiving HCQ plus standard cares, virologic clearance
was similar to those who received the standard care alone [49]. On the other hand,
Gautret et al. [50] demonstrated the efficiency of HCQ in clearing viral nasopharyngeal
carriage and went farther showing that, within five days, the combination of HCQ with
the antibiotic Azithromycin (PubChem CID:447043) negativized 6 of 6 patients
infected with the SARS-CoV-2 versus 8 of 14 patients that received HCQ alone.
Weighing up the pros and cons of the possible therapeutic regimens with chloroquine or
HCQ, one may argue that these drugs are relatively well tolerated and no significant
adverse effects have been reported at the doses and durations proposed for COVID-19
treatment [51]; on the flip side, it should not be disregard the serious possible adverse
effects that, though rare, include QTc prolongation, hypoglycemia, neuropsychiatric
effects, and retinopathy [52]. Furthermore, there were few statistically robust results
confirming the regimen efficacy. Together, these evidence lead us to suggest that before
initiating the treatment for COVID-19, it is mandatory an individualized, detailed,
independent and, above all, consensual assessment to make the best possible choice.
When the therapy was conducted with Tocilizumab (PubChem SID: 135345962)
the number of patients that were admitted to Intensive Care Unit and needed invasive

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.30.20222950; this version posted November 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

mechanical ventilation was reduced (ID: 25217; 25243 and 26251). From those patients
who were already in ICU, 76% improved or remained stable after Tocilizumab
treatment. Overall, from 100 patients admitted in one study, 77 of them benefited from
the treatment. However, 23 patients had their respiratory condition worsened and 20 of
them died [53]. Contrasting this study, a cohort conducted by Campochiaro et al. [54]
verified no clinical improvement or reduced mortality between tocilizumab and standard
treatment patients. The use of Remdesivir (PubChem CID: 121304016) did not improve
clinical outcomes and was associated with some adverse effects. Therefore, we
reinforce the need for more literature about the definitive efficacy of the humanized
monoclonal antibody that targets the IL-6 receptor, and about the ATP analog. More
recently, the solidary big trial by WHO, which enrolled approximately 11,000
individuals in 400 hospitals around the world, revealed that hydroxychloroquine,
ritonavir/lopinavir, and remdesivir did not increase patients survival nor lowered
mortality or delayed the urgent need for artificial ventilation [55].
Although there is enough evidence that inflammatory status plays a determinant
role in the clinic evolution of patients with COVID-19, a study (ID: 26211) analyzing
the use of methylprednisolone (PubChem CID: 6741) showed no benefit, but only
adverse effects. Conversely, 26 patients treated with low-dose of corticosteroid for a
few days had faster recovery and improvement of lung symptoms [47]. According to
Saghazadeh et al. [56], the use of corticosteroids may cause suppression of antiviral
immune response, so the empiric use of this class of drug may be restricted until
controlled clinical trials prove that this treatment modality ameliorates the
inflammatory-related symptoms and reduces the COVID-19-related death. The
inhalation of manipulated plasminogen was useful in treating lung lesions and
hypoxemia, however this was demonstrated by only one study, and the heterogeneity of
the patients (clinically moderate, severe or critical) reinforces the need for further trials.

Conclusion
The main evidence related to diagnostic methods is clear, and includes

tomography and laboratory tests. However, we felt a lack of rigorous studies focused on
novel and more reliable diagnostics methods. The medications for the treatment of
COVID-19, although showing some reduction of the signs and symptoms related to this
disease, the viral load, inflammatory activity and mortality, may cause adverse effects
