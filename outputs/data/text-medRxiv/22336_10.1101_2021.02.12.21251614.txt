1 Abstract

34

Background: New SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased transmissibility, like B.1.1.7 from

35

England or B1.351 from South Africa, have caused considerable concern worldwide. In order

36

to contain the spread of these lineages, it is of utmost importance to have rapid, sensitive and

37

high-throughput detection methods at hand. Methods: Analytical sensitivity was assessed for

38

both wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.1.7 lineage by serial dilution. A total of 141 clinical samples

39

were subjected to the test and results compared to a commercial manual typing-PCR assay

40

and NGS. Results: The multiplex assay is highly sensitive for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in

41

clinical samples, with an LoD of 25.82 cp/ml (CI: 11.61 - 57.48). LoDs are slightly higher for the

42

HV68/70 deletion (111.36 cp/ml; CI: 78.16 - 158.67) and the N501Y SNP (2548.04 cp/ml, CI: 1592.58

43

- 4076.73). A total of 141 clinical samples were tested with the assay, including 16 samples containing

44

SARS-CoV-2 of the B.1.1.7 lineage. Three non-B.1.1.7 samples contained a HV69/70 deletion. All were

45

correctly identified by the multiplex assay. Conclusion: We describe here a highly sensitive, fully

46

automated multiplex PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of del-HV69/70 and N501Y

47

that can distinguish between lineages B.1.1.7 and B1.351. The assay allows for high-

48

throughput screening for relevant variants in clinical samples prior to sequencing.

2 Introduction:

51

A number of novel SARS-CoV-2 variants that emerged in fall 2020, some of which show

52

increased transmissibility and possible immune escape, are increasingly attracting worldwide

53

attention (1, 2).

54

The B.1.1.7 lineage (VOC202012/01, 501Y.V1) first emerged in southern England and is

55

notable for an unusually high number of mutations with no direct common ancestor

56

compared to previous sequences (3, 4). In particular, non-synonymous spike-gene mutations

57

such as the N501Y SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) may lead to changes in receptor

58

binding properties (5). Another variant, B.1.351 (501Y.V2) first described in south Africa, is

59

characterized by the same spike mutation, along with E484K and others (6). Both have largely

60

replaced previously circulating lineages in their respective areas of origin, indicating improved

61

host adaptation and immune evasion.

62
63

As a result of increased awareness in public health and science institutions, there has been a

64

rapidly growing demand for whole genome sequencing worldwide in order to recognize and

65

map the spread of these emerging variants. In this context, the speed and scalability of fully

66

automated RT-PCR can be highly beneficial to pre-screen samples for relevant mutations.

67

The aim of this study was to create and validate a high-throughput first-line screening assay

68

with the build-in ability to discriminate between relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants such as B.1.1.7

69

and B.1.351 on a fully automated sample-to-result PCR-platform (7). Inhouse assays have

70

previously been used successfully for SARS-CoV-2 detection and diagnostics with this system

71

via its open mode (Cobas Omni Utility Channel) (8).

72

3 Multiplex assay setup

74

The basic rationale of the multiplex assay was to combine two highly sensitive diagnostic SARS-CoV-2

75

PCR assays with additional assays to simultaneously detect relevant mutations. The SC2-assay by the

76

US CDC (N-gene, SC2-N) was modified to serve as Pan-SCoV2 target (9). A publicly available diagnostic

77

S-gene assay by Zhen et al. serves as second target (SC2-S) (10), while also featuring a drop-out

78

phenomenon in the presence of a HV69/70 deletion due to probe location, which is rescued by an

79

additional Taqman-probe (S-Del) that allows differentiation for wild-type and del-HV69/70. An

80

additional assay was designed (using Beacon designer and PrimerQuest software) and integrated into

81

the multiplex to detect the N501Y SNP. See Figure 1 for a schematic overview of the PCRs and their

82

target regions.

a) Schematic overview of the primers and probes used in the novel multiplex assay and their target

88

regions within the SARS-CoV-2 lineages (wildtype (WT) and B.1.1.7). SARS-CoV-2 Spike SC2 PCR targets

89

the spike gene (S1) of both lineages, with probe-1 detecting the wildtype sequence and probe 2 being

90

specific for the HV69/70 deletion of the B.1.1.7 lineage. The SARS-CoV-2 N501YPCR targeting the

91

receptor binding domain (RBD) is specifically designed for detecting the N501Y SNP. Both lineages are

92

detected by the third PCR targeting the N-gene (N).

99

The cobas 6800/8800 internal control (IC) is a spike-in (packaged) RNA target, which is

100

automatically added during extraction by the system. MMRX-R2-reagent already contains the

101

internal control assay by default; the respective sequences are not disclosed by the

102

manufacturer. The IC acts as a full process control in the same way as in commercial cobas

103

6800/8800 IVD tests manufactured by Roche.

137

To evaluate clinical performance and specificity of differentiation, a set of 101 samples RT-PCR positive

138

for SARS-CoV-2 were subjected to the SCOV2_VAR_UCT. Of these samples, 14 were predetermined as

139

B.1.1.7 lineage. Presence of the respective mutations was confirmed by a set of commercial assays by

140

TIB MOL (VirSNiP Spike N501Y and Del69/70, Berlin, Germany). Presence of del-HV69/70 and N501Y

141

mutations in the non-B117 set was precluded using the same commercial assays. A further 40 SARS-

142

CoV-2 negative samples (by cobas SARS-CoV-2 IVD test), and a cross-reactivity panel containing various

143

respiratory pathogens (supplementary table 1) were tested with the assay to assess overall specificity.

144
145

Overall analytic LoD (95% chance of detection) was determined as 25.82 cp/ml (CI: 57.48 – 11.61) (SC2-

146

S LoD: 73.89; CI: 151-03 – 36.16. SC2-N LoD: 11.13, CI 16.02 – 7.73), as seen in supplementary table 2.

147

There were no significant differences with B.1.1.7 lineage (Lod: 20.37, CI: 97.86 – 20.37) (S-DEL LoD:

148

111.36; CI: 158.67 – 78.16. SC2-N LoD: 20.37; CI: 97.86 – 20.37). Limit for successful detection of an

149

N501Y SNP was 2548.04 cp/ml (CI: 4076.73 – 1592.58), indicating that the N501Y SNP-assay is about

150

100-fold less sensitive than the two diagnostic-grade SARS-CoV-2 assays.

151

Of the 101 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples, all were correctly identified by the SCOV2_VAR_UCT. 16

152

B.1.1.7 lineage samples were classified as positive for N501Y and del-HV69/70. 3 of the 85 non-B.1.1.7

153

samples were positive for del-HV69/70, but not N501Y, which was confirmed by the TIB MOL reference

154

assays (table 3). This is in line with existing data showing sporadic occurrences of del-HV69/70

155

mutations within the endemic SARS-CoV-2 population (approx. 6%).

5 Discussion and Conclusion

172

Diagnostic labs in Europe are increasingly confronted with demands for rapid differentiation of SARS-

173

CoV-2 isolates due to concerns about potentially higher transmissibility and immune escape with

174

recently emerged lineages such as B.1.1.7 and B1.351 (1, 6). Previous reports have demonstrated how

175

inclusivity issues of commercial assays such as the “TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 kit” (Thermo Fischer

176

Scientific, USA) can coincidentally be used to pre-screen for B.1.1.7 lineage variants because of a drop-

177

out phenomenon in one of the targets associated with del-HV69/70 (12). However, this method runs

178

the risk of misinterpreting sporadic HV69/70 deletions, of which we found three within the B.1.1.7

179

negative set. Mutations like N501Y have independently occurred multiple times in areas with high

180

incidence rates, implying advantages in an environment of high background host-immunity. Their

181

relevance may further grow in the context of ongoing vaccination campaigns. Commercial solutions

182

for SARS-CoV-2 SNP detection such as the TIB MOL VirSNiP-kits are in the process of entering the

183

diagnostics market; however, they mostly consist of manual protocols, thus limiting their suitability for

184

large scale application. The SCOV2_VAR_UCT is able to detect both the del-HV69/70 and N501Y

185

mutations, relevant for B.1.1.7 and B1.351 and further adaptions can be implemented to also pick up

186

new emerging SNPs if necessary. It is self-evident that such methods cannot be a replacement for

187

whole genome sequencing; they do, however, represent a valuable asset to quickly detect clusters and

188

help better direct NGS capacities.

189

In conclusion, the SCOV2_VAR_UCT multiplex presented in this study combines highly sensitive SARS-

190

CoV-2 detection with relatively reliable identification of the B.1.1.7 lineage by detecting two hallmark

191

mutations. Furthermore, other lineages featuring the N501Y SNP, but lacking the deletion, would also

192

be recognized as abnormal for further investigation. It can thus be used either as a secondary assay for

193

pre-screening prior to sequencing, or as a first-line diagnostic assay. Using the cobas6800/8800

194

automated systems, this setup can be employed for high-throughput screening for B.1.1.7 and other

195

variants, requiring minimal hands-on time.
