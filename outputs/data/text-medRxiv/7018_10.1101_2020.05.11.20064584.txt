Abstract
Background& Aims:
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global epidemic and has caused a
lasting and huge loss of life security, economic development and social stability in more than 180
countries around the world. Unfortunately, there is still no specific treatment for COVID-19 till now,
therefore, at this point, all potential therapies need to be critically considered. LL-37 is one of the
best-studied human antimicrobial peptide (AMPs) that has a broad-spectrum activity against
bacteria and viruses. The use of living, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is an effective
approach for delivery of therapeutic proteins. The aim of this study was to determine the safety and
efficacy of the Lactococcus lactis which has been genetically modified to produce the therapeutic
human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 (herein after referred to cas001) in the patients of COVID-19.
Methods:
Firstly we constructed genetically modified food-grade probiotic, Lactococcus lactis, with sequence
of seven tandem repeats of mature human LL-37 under control of the nisin-inducible nisA promoter
to produce the cas001. A total of 20 healthy SD rats, half male and half female (There were five
male and five female in the control group, the same in treatment group) were used to observe the
acute toxic reaction and death after daily administration of cas001 for three weeks, which helps to
provide necessary reference basis for clinical dose selection, verificaition of toxic reaction and
possible target organs. According to the estimated clinical dosage of 1 x 108CFU /kg/day,
considering the conversion of body surface area, the dose for rats should be multiplied by 6.17 to 6
x 108 CFU/kg/day. We administrated 100 times higher dose at 6 x 10 10 CFU/ /kg/day to rats. In
order to investigate the pharmacokinetics of cas001, male SD rats (body weight 250-300g, 1 x 1010
/animal, n=3) were given oral administration of LL-37 bacteria powder. The concentration of LL-37
in the blood before and after gavage was detected by ELISA kit (Hycult biotechnology Cat#
HK321).
Human clinical study was approved by Ethics committee of Chinese PLA General Hospital
(S2020-074-04) and a total of 11 patients with mild symptoms were enrolled in Wuhan hankou
hospital and Huoshenshan hospital. They were enrolled voluntarily and all patients signed informed
consent. Among them, there were 5 males and 6 females, aged 55 ± 12 (36-70) years old, and the
duration from onset to medication enrollment was 35 ± 19 (5-68) days. 6 patients were nucleic acid
positive and 5 patients were nucleic acid negative when they were enrolled. All patients received
the oral drug cas001 treatment according to requirement(1 x 109 CFU/capsule, 3 capsules/time,
three times a day for 3weeks), with an average follow-up time of 33 ± 15 days (see table 1 for the
results).
Findings: Western blot analysis shows that reasonable amount of LL-37 were induced by different
concentrations of nisin, which means we have successfully constructed cas001. In the pre-clinical
safety evaluation test, after three weeks administration of cas001, no adverse effects were
observed on the rat's body weight, food and water intake, hematological or serum biochemical
parameters. The results showed that the LD50 of cas001 was higher than that of the 100 times of
the expected clinical dose of 6 x 1010 CFU/day. These results showed that cas001 could be safe in
animal experiments. In addition, rat pharmacokinetics results showed that the serum concentration
of LL-37 reached peak 2 hours after gavage of cas001 and returned to basal level 6 hours after
gavage. During study period, the volunteers did not feel any discomfort while taking the cas001
capsules, and two hours after oral administration, the concentration of LL-37 were increased in
healthy volunteers.
cas001 shows definite effect in the improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms and is possible to
have effects in improving the systemic symptoms and respiratory symptoms and may play a role in

the improvement of results of nucleic acid test and lung CT test. 11 patients enrolled showed good
compliance, tolerance, subjective feeling and actively interacted with the doctors. None of the
patients had any adverse reactions.
Conclusions
Based on above observations, we conclude here that as an oral anti-viral agent, cas001 displayed
good safety profiles. It is very hard to reach conclusion of clinical outcomes related to the cas001,
although changes of several symptoms indicate encouraging findings.

Introduction
On March 11, 2020, the director-general of World Health Organization (WHO) declared the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) situation as a pandemic1. By May 4, 2020,
the number of cases of COVID-19 had increased exponentially. There have been more than 3
million reported cases, 240 thousand death and the number of affected countries was more than
200. Recent report has demonstrated that there is less than 80% sequence similarity between
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV2 and recent studies also pointed to the important role of ACE2 in
mediating entry of SARS-CoV-22, 3.
Currently, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 and therapeutic options in response to the
COVID-19 outbreak are urgently needed4, 5. For above reasons, there are several options can be
considered for drug discovery: the first one is to screen anti-viral drugs that are approved by
government agency with good safety profiles. The second one is to keep a close watch on virus
entry and replication in the target cells. From this point of view, clinical trials are under way to test
the safety and efficacy of recombinant human ACE2 in the treatment of COVID-196. As early as
February 2020, a Chinese research team discovered that remdesivir and chloroquine could
effectively inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 in vitro by screening of the antiviral efficiency of five
FDA-approved drugs7. In line with this regard, currently, at least 80 trials related to the chloroquine,
hydroxychloroquine have been registered worldwide8. On the other hand, nearly twenty clinical
trials regarding the remdesivir were also registered worldwide. In addition, by compassionate-use
of remdesivir, clinical improvement was observed9. While we still need to accelerate and fine-tuning
drug development to control infection rate, improve cure rate and decrease mortality of COVID-19.
LL- 37 is against a variety of viruses10, including the human acquired immunodeficiency virus
(HIV-1)11, influenza a virus (IAV)12, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)13, rhinovirus14, herpes simplex
virus (HSV)15Zika virus10 and hepatitis c virus (HCV)16, etc., mainly through the interaction with cell
membrane and virus shell to play antiviral effects. When the antimicrobial form binds to the cell
membrane, the antimicrobial form disrupts the lipid layer, increasing the permeability of the cell
membrane and leading to the outflow of material from the cell, thus killing the microorganism 17.
Antibacterial peptide LL-37 can induce antigen-presenting cells to produce a strong immune
response, by producing and releasing type I interferon and promoting the maturation of dendritic
cells, enhancing the transmission of viral dsDNA to toll-like receptors located near the nucleus, thus
achieving an effective antiviral effect. There is a clinical study demonstrating that treatment with
LL-37 for chronic leg ulcers was safe and well tolerated with the marked effect on healing
predictors18.
Lactococcus lactis is non-pathogenic, non-colonizing bacterium and is one of the most commonly
used microorganisms in the dairy industry and has an excellent safety record. Genetically modified
probiotic Lactococcus lactis can serve as vectors for local delivery of biologically active molecules19.
Several clinical studies were conducted with Lactococcus lactis, either bacteria itself on chronic
rhino sinusitis (NCT04048174) and pre-hypertensive subjects (NCT02670811) or genetically
modified lactococcus lactis that has been engineered to secrete human Interleukin-10 (hIL-10)
which is now in a phase I trial to treat Crohn's disease20, a PhaseⅡstudy in Ulcerative Colitis
(NCT00729872) or used as malaria vaccine hybrid GMZ2 (NCT00424944);What’s more,
Lactococcus lactis secreting human TFF1 (Trefoil Factor 1) is in a phase Ⅱ, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, 2-arm, multi-center trial (NCT03234465). These studies all indicated that
lactococcus lactis displays an excellent safety profiles.

Ethics
Animals were housed under a 12/12 hr light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. Before
sacrifice, animals were given an anesthetic and cervical dislocation rapidly to relieve pain. All
animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Institute of
Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Materials and animals
The food grade bacterial strains Lactococcus lactis cremoris, NZ3900 (Cat# VS-ELS03900-01) and
plasmids pNZ8149 (Cat# VS-ELV00300-01) & pNZ8148(Cat# VS-ELV00200-01) were purchased
from MoBiTec GmbH, Germany. In addition, fermenting materials were supported by Beijing
Aoboxing Bio-Tech Co.，LTD. Human LL-37 peptides came from GenScript Biotech Corporation
(Cat# RP13323). Other biomedical reagents came from the Sigma-Aldrich company.
7-week-old male C57BL/6J mice and SD Rats were purchased from Vital River Laboratory Animal
Technology. Co. LTD. Each mouse (n=5) was treated by 1.0E9 frozen-dried powder of
chloromycetin resistant recombinant bacteria once and feces were collected for counting viable
bacteria by pour plate method at 3, 9, 15, 27, 39 and 51 hr after administration respectively. After a
week of adjustable feeding, male (n=10) and female (n=10) SD Rats were randomly separated into
equal-number-individual groups respectively according to body weight and treated with
6.0E10/kg·day frozen-dried powder by gavage in the animal safety assessment. In the following
two weeks, body weight, water drink, food intake, blood routine examination, serum biochemical
analysis and daily observation were recorded to assess the risk of drug. For pharmacokinetics
tracking, rats of same age were treated with same dose of recombinant bacteria (n=3), blood
samples were collected from tail tip at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6 hr after gavage. Serum LL-37 concentration were
detected by Hycult biotechnology human ELISA KIT (Cat# HK321).

The clinical human study was approved by the Ethics committee of Chinese PLA General Hospital
(S2020-074-04) and all participants signed an informed consent according to the requirement of
the Ethics committee. Based on safety concerns, the ethics committee requested a small
exploratory clinical trial in which participants are patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19, and the
study mainly focused on assessing the clinical safety prior to large-scale clinical study. At the same
time, this study was registered on the west China website. (http://www.chictr.org.cn,
ChiCTR2000030939).
Plasmid cloning and transformation
The construction of DNA element is shown in the Figure 1B, DNA sequence was submitted to
GenScript Biotech Corporation for gene synthesis and sub-cloning into pNZ8149. The
pNZ8149-7×LL-37 recombinant vector were transferred into home-made NZ3900 competent cell
through Gene PulserXcell™ electroporation system (BioRad, California, USA) to produce cas001.
Cell culture
The cas001 were cultured at 30℃ up to 9-10 hours in mixed M17 media (0.5% Soya peptone, 0.25%

Anti-virus infection experiment in vitro
GFP labeled-recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-SARS (rVSV-SARS) and vesicular stomatitis
virus-SARS-CoV2 (rVSV-SARS-CoV2) were gifts from Aihua-Zheng, Ph.D. The surface
G-attachment glycoprotein of rVSV was specifically replaced by the spike protein of SARS or
SARS-CoV2. The rVSV-SARS or rVSV-SARS-CoV2 were diluted into 2000 ffu/ml as working
solution, then different doses of LL-37 were added into working solution respectively and incubated
for 30 min at room temperature. Then vero cells copped in 96 well plate were changed the medium
with this working solution and continued to culture for 2 hr at 37 ℃, each group was performed with
three biological replicates. Afterwards vero cells were replaced with fresh medium including 20 mM
NH4Cl to terminate virus infection for 14 hr at 28 ℃. Finally the GFP positive colony numbers were
recorded by manual counting to calculate the inhibition rate.

Patients
The research ethics committee of Chinese PLA General Hospital (S2020-074-04) approved the
study and all participants signed an informed consent according to the requirement of Ethics
Commission. The studied subjects were from wuhan hankou hospital and huoshenshan hospital.
All the patients were mild inpatients who were positive for nucleic acid test when enrolled. They met
the inclusion requirements of the ethics committee. All subjects signed the informed consent. Since
the patients had received systemic treatment in the local hospital at enrollment, for the sake of
safety, on the premise that the original treatment plan was unchanged, the subjects were given
extra LL-37 treatment by oral administration for 3 pills, 1 time/8 hours, and for 3 weeks. Baseline
clinical information was collected, including demographic characteristic, clinical symptoms, blood
test results, nucleic acid test results, lung CT results, etc., and follow-up was conducted once a
week to evaluate the improvement of patients' clinical symptoms and adverse reactions.
Statistical Analysis
All data were shown by Mean ± SEM. Comparisons between groups were made with one-way
ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test or Student’s t-test. Repeated measurement analysis was made
by both factors RM two-way ANOVA. p value < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.

As a food grade bacterial strains, lactococcus lactis was usually regarded as a very convenient
living oral drug carrier which could transport protein drugs or vaccines. Here we designed a
recombinant lactococcus lactis carrying LL-37(cas001), a human endogenous antiviral peptide to
treat COVID-19 (Fig. 1A). In order to express the shorter target polypeptide, we combined signal
peptide, LEISS enhancing sequence with seven tandem repeated sequences encoding mature
human LL-37 under control of the nisin-inducible nisA promoter (Fig. 1B-C). The cas001 could
secrete target protein (~34KD) into supernatant followed by addition of inducer Nisin(Fig. 1D).
Therefore we successfully constructed LL-37 over-expressing lactococcus lactis.

LL-37 impaired rVSV-SARS and rVSV-SARS-CoV2 infection in vitro
We investigated the inhibitory effect of LL-37 on virus entry into the target cells with the simulated
viruses of SARS and SARS-CoV2 as follows. S protein is the main immunogen of coronavirus
mediating virus infection. The rVSV-SARS and rVSV-SARS-CoV2 recombinant viruses were
constructed by replacing the G protein of VSV with the S protein of SARS and SARS-CoV2, and the
S protein was displayed on the surface of the VSV virus, respectively. The recombinant virus can
simulate the infection process of SARS and SARS-CoV2.
To verify LL-37 effect in inhibiting SARS virus, packaged rVSV-SARS virus was diluted to 2000
ffu/ml as virus solution. LL-37 was then diluted to 0 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml, 1000 ng/ml, 10000
ng/ml, 100000 ng/ml using virus solution to get different concentrations of treatment solution. After
incubation for 30 minutes at the room temperature, different concentrations of treatment solution
were used to treat vero cells in 96-well plates, with 100ul per well and 3 multiple wells for each
concentration. The cells were placed in a 37℃ cell incubator. The fresh medium containing 20 mM
NH4Cl was added in place of treatment solution 2 hours after virus infection, and the cells were
placed in cell incubator at 28℃. The number of cells with positive fluorescence signal was counted
under fluorescence microscope 24 hours after infection. Finally, according to the comparison test
results, the antiviral ability of LL-37 was identified. The maximum inhibition rate of LL-37 was 85%
at the concentration of 10ug/ml (Fig. 2A). The ability of LL-37 to inhibit SARS-CoV2 infection was
measured in similar manner. At a concentration of 100ng/ml, LL-37 inhibited the ability of
SARS-CoV2 to invade Vero cells by 41.5% (Fig. 2B).
Results of the subchronic toxicity experiment showed that cas001 displayed good safety
profiles
The acute and subchronic toxicity test of LL-37 was performed in rats to evaluate its safety. We
produced special Lactococus Lactis with chloramphenicol resistance. Using culture plates with
chloramphenicol resistance, we detected specially-made probiotic bacteria number in feces to
determine its colonization in the gut. The chloramphenicol-resistant bacteria were administrated to
mice by gavage (1 x 109 CFU/mice), and the feces were collected at different time after the gavage
(Fig. 3A). In order to determine the blood pharmacokinetic profile of LL-37, male SD rats (body
weight 250-300g, 1 x 1010 CFU/animal, n=3) were given oral administration of cas001. The
concentration of LL-37 in the blood before and after gavage was detected using ELISA kit (Hycult
biotechnology Cat# HK321). Results showed that 2 hours after gavage, the concentration of LL-37
in the blood reached the peak (Fig. 3B).
In the animal safety evaluation experiment, 100 times of the expected clinical dose of drug was
given to rats by oral gavage at the dose of 6 x 10 10 CFU//kg/ day. The results showed that LD50 of
LL-37 was more than 6 x 1010 CFU/kg/ day. Observation during 14 days of administration showed
that all SD rats were generally in good condition both during and after administration and no
abnormal performance was observed in SD rats (data not shown). The body weights showed no

significant difference between the treatment group and the control group (Fig. 3C), indicating that
the oral cas001 did not affect the weight gain. During the observation period, the food intake, water
intake, organs weight and histological examination results of SD rats in treatment group were not
significantly different from those of the control group (Fig. 3D-G), indicating that under this
experimental condition, cas001 did not affect the appetite of experimental animals. The results of
blood biochemistry examination indicated that there was no significant difference in liver, kidney
function, myocardial enzyme concentration, blood lipid concentration and electrolyte concentration
between the two groups of SD rats (all p values were > 0.05) (Table. 1) .

Cas001 significantly improved symptoms of COVID-19 patients
With the approval of ethics committee of Chinese PLA General Hospital (Ethics no. : s2020-074-04),
the investigator-initiated clinical trial (ITT) was carried out, which mainly focused on safety
assessment and small-scale, single-arm, exploratory safety study was performed. A total of 11
eligible patients with mild symptoms were enrolled in Wuhan Hankou hospital and Huoshenshan
hospital. They were enrolled voluntarily and all patients signed informed consent. Among them,
there were 5 males and 6 females, aged 55 ± 12 (36-70) years old, and the duration from onset to
medication enrollment was 35±19 (5-68) days. 6 patients were nucleic acid positive and 5 patients
were nucleic acid negative when they were enrolled. All patients received the cas001 treatment
according to requirement (3 capsules/time, three times a day for 3weeks), with an average
follow-up time of 33±15 days (Table. 5).
At the time of enrollment, the patients' symptoms included three categories, among which the
positive systemic symptoms mainly included fever, fatigue and myalgia. After treatment, the
improvement rate of systemic symptoms was 100%, and the time from medication to the complete
remission ranged from 5 to 33 days; Respiratory symptoms included pharyngalgia, cough, chest
distress, shortness of breath, which were improved completely 7-14 days after treatment with
improvement rate up to 100%; Gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal discomfort, nausea,
poor appetite, and diarrhea were completely improved within 2-18 days after treatment. Among all
symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms were improved fastest with the shortest improvement time of
2 days (Table. 6).
Among the 11 patients enrolled, 5 were positive for nucleic acid test before medication, 6 were
negative. After treatment, 4 of the 5 positive patients were negative for nucleic acid test. The
duration from taking the medicine to recovery was 19, 17, 9 and 17 days respectively. All patients
received lung CT examination before the enrollment and nine of them showed abnormal lung CT
results. During the follow-up period, a total of 4 cases completed the reexamination of lung CT, 3
cases of them have been completely improved, the duration from medication to complete
improvement was 44, 48, 50 days, respectively; Another 1 case improved 75%, costing 17 days
from medication to improvement. The remaining 5 patients did not complete the pulmonary CT
reexamination due to home isolation/quarantine place isolation after discharge (Table. 7).
11 patients enrolled showed good compliance, tolerance, subjective feeling and actively interacted
with the doctors. None of the patients had any adverse reactions, and the observation of adverse

To assess pharmacokinetics in human individuals, four healthy adult volunteers were recruited to
the study (Table. 2). During dose escalation study periods, the volunteers did not feel any
discomfort while taking the cas001 capsules, such as fatigue, weakness, nausea, vomiting, etc.
Two hours after oral administration, the concentration of LL-37 level was increased in healthy
volunteers (#1volunteer who took highest dose of cas001, increased significantly, the others only
increased slightly) (Table. 3). Accordingly, there was no significant change in liver and kidney
function after oral cas001 medication (Table. 4). All these results taken together, cas001 displays
an excellent safety profile in both preclinical trials and healthy volunteers assay.

reactions was performed with reference to literatures21. Living bacteria drugs may cause four types
of adverse reactions theoretically, including gastrointestinal related adverse reactions, infection,
harmful metabolic effects, excessive immune stimulation of susceptible individuals and gene
transfer22. There was no clinical evidence for the occurrence of the latter two, and the main
manifestations of the other three types of adverse reactions including infection23-29, harmful
metabolic effect30, gastrointestinal related adverse reactions22 were as follows (Table. 8). During
the observation of this clinical study, none of the patients presented adverse reactions shown in
table 4 or any other ones.
Discussion
There is a report indicating that although gastrointestinal symptoms were uncommon, still a part of
patients showed gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea (3.8%) and vomiting (5.0%)31. In line
with this observation, there are numbers of studies demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 can be
detected in the gastrointestinal tract32, 33. Since the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binding to
ACE2 receptor is a critical step for virus entry, investigation of the expression pattern of ACE2 in
host specific target cells or organs is particular important. Accordingly, a report demonstrated that
ACE2 is rarely expressed in esophageal epithelium but is abundantly distributed in the cilia of the
glandular epithelia33. These results imply that we cannot exclude the possibility of fecal-oral
transmission.34
Lactococcus lactis could be used to treat GIT related diseases such as colitis and inflammatory
bowel disease (IBD) due to its survival ability in gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and its
immunomodulatory properties. In fact, engineered Lactococcus lactis secreting interleukin-10
(IL-10) was used to treat murine colitis19. Although clinical outcome was not as promising as hoped
in human crohn’s disease20, similar clinical trials addressed concerns related to release of
lactococcus lactis. It should be noted that we should consider the properties of lactococcus lactis in
the mucosal immunity, besides systemic target protein secretion by GMOs. Interestingly, a report
demonstrated that lactococcus lactis induced mucosal IgA which can form a barrier to pathogens
on the mucosal surface35. Whether cas001 could also induce IgA mucosal immunity needs further
investigation.
According to the scope of study and number of cases approved by the medical ethics committee,
the first phase of the single-arm, symptomatically oriented investigator initiated clinical trials (ITT)
which enrolled 11 patients have been successfully completed. From the results of research and
follow-up, patients were well tolerated, characterized by good compliance and feeling after taking
cas001. The adverse reactions reported in the symptomatology and probiotics related literatures
include: gastrointestinal related adverse reactions, infection, and harmful metabolic effects, while
all of the above were not observed in the study. Therefore, from this small scale exploratory
research, the good safety of cas001 was preliminarily verified.
All patients enrolled are mild in symptoms and in convalescence, the ratio of male : female is
appropriate, the duration from the onset to the enrollment is at the average of 34 days. After the
medication, systemic symptoms, respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms were improved
to varying degrees, among them gastrointestinal symptoms were improved significantly. The
improvement rate of respiratory symptoms was 100%, all patients showed improvement during the
follow-up period, and no recurrence of the above symptoms occurred during the follow-up period
after drug withdrawal. There were 5 patients with positive nucleic acid test results at the beginning
of medication, and 4 patients turned negative after an average of 15 days medication. Another

patient was in home isolation and did not receive reexamination. Whether the change of the nucleic
acid test results is related to cas001 is not easy to infer at present. In terms of the improvement of
lung CT results, 3 cases got completely improved and 1 case got 75% improved. It took 7days for
recovery from mild inflammation to complete absorption of inflammation. Whether the cas001
improves or accelerates healing process remains to be investigated. Overall, cas001 shows
definite effect in the improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms and is possible to have effects in
improving the systemic symptoms and respiratory symptoms and may play a role in the
improvement of results of nucleic acid test and lung CT test.
This study is limited to a small scope and mainly focuses on the safety exploration. The epidemic of
novel coronavirus in China is in the clearance phase, so the number of medical records included
from the above two centers is very limited. What’s more, there are few clinical cases related to
cas001, which is a major defect of current clinical study. In addition, all patients were discharged
from the hospital 3-5 days after enrollment, and were isolated at home or in a quarantine place,
resulting in incomplete blood and CT follow-up data. The follow-up time is relatively short, and
further evaluation is needed to see whether there are new safety problems in the middle phase (3-6
months) and the adverse reactions in middle and later phase. While, since Lactococcus lactis is not
colonized in the body and has a short metabolic cycle and did not cause any adverse effects in
short term observation, there is little possibility that cas001 would cause adverse reactions in
middle and later phase.
This small scale exploratory study suggested that the oral cas001 has good clinical tolerance and
significant safety. Cas001 has positive effect in the improvement of symptoms and nucleic acid
clearance in patients with mild symptoms, especially in the improvement of gastrointestinal
symptoms, suggesting that this drug could be used to treat patients with mild symptoms as an
auxiliary drug or as a single cure for clinical application. Its efficacy and safety still need to be
further confirmed by prospective, large sample, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, controlled
studies and long-term follow-up.
Limitations
Current study has several following limitations. Firstly, primary purpose of current clinical trial is
assessment of safety profiles. In this regard, we did not performed dose escalation study, therefore,
optimal clinical dose of cas001 is not yet fully determined. Secondly, this was a small scale single
arm clinical trial without control. It is hard to reach conclusion of clinical outcomes related to the
cas001, although changes of several symptoms indicating encouraging findings. Thirdly, before
taking cas001, these self-quarantined patients with mild symptoms had received other antiviral
drugs. It is unclear if these patients would be improved without cas001 treatment. Fourthly, it is hard
to measure circulating LL-37 in patients due to viral contamination. Finally, we also could not
directly quantify viral road because of limited number of patients available in the study and most of
them were with mild symptoms and nucleic acid positive and were self-quarantined.
Conclusions
In current preliminary uncontrolled study enrolling 11 patients with COVID-19, administration of
cas001 has promising clinical outcomes. The small sample size and uncontrolled study design
preclude a definitive statement about the potential effectiveness of cas001, and further evaluation
in large-scale clinical trials is required.
