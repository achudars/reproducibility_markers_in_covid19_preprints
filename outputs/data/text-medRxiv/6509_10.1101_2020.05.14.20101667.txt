Flatten the Curve! Modeling SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19
Growth in Germany at the County Level
Thomas Wieland (thomas.wieland@kit.edu)
2020-05-13
Abstract
Since the emerging of the ”novel coronavirus” SARS-CoV-2 and the corresponding
respiratory disease COVID-19, the virus has spread all over the world. Being one of
the most affected countries in Europe, in March 2020, Germany established several
nonpharmaceutical interventions to contain the virus spread, including the closure of
schools and child day care facilities (March 16-18, 2020) as well as a full ”lockdown”
with forced social distancing and closures of ”nonessential” services (March 23, 2020).
The present study attempts to analyze whether these governmental interventions had
an impact on the declared aim of ”flattening the curve”, referring to the epidemic
curve of new infections. This analysis is conducted from a regional perspective.
On the level of the 412 German counties, logistic growth models were estimated
based on daily infections (estimated from reported cases), aiming at determining
the regional growth rate of infections and the point of inflection where infection
rates begin to decrease and the curve flattens. All German counties exceeded the
peak of new infections between the beginning of March and the middle of April. In
a large majority of German counties, the epidemic curve has flattened before the
”lockdown” was established. In a minority of counties, the peak was already exceeded
before school closures. The growth rates of infections vary spatially depending on
the time the virus emerged. Counties belonging to states which established an
additional curfew show no significant improvement with respect to growth rates and
mortality. Furthermore, mortality varies strongly across German counties, which
can be attributed to infections of people belonging to the ”risk group”, especially
residents of retirement homes. The results raise the question whether social ban
measures and curfews really contribute to curve flattening within a pandemic.

Background

The ”novel coronavirus” SARS-CoV-2 (”Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
2”) and the corresponding respiratory disease COVID-19 (”Coronavirus Disease 2019”)
caused by the virus initially appeared in December 2019 in Wuhan, Province Hubei,
China. Since its emergence, the virus has spread over nearly all countries across the world.
On March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the SARS-CoV2/COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic (Lai et al. 2020, World Health Organization
2020b). As of May 10, 2020, 3,986,119 cases and 278,814 deaths had been reported
worldwide. In Europe, the most affected countries are Spain, Italy, United Kingdom and
Germany (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control 2020).
The virus is transmitted between humans via droplets or through direct contact (Lai
et al. 2020). In a very influential simulation study from March 2020, the Imperial College
COVID-19 Response Team (Ferguson et al. 2020) suggested a series of public health
measures aimed at slowing or stopping the transmission of the virus in absence of a
vaccine or a successful therapy. These so-called nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPI)
aim at reducing contact rates in the population, including social distancing and closures
of schools and universities as well as the quarantine of infected persons. The Chinese
government had imposed containment measures in the Provice Hubei already at the end

March 2020, nearly all European countries have introduced measures against the spread
of Coronavirus. These measures range from appeals to voluntary behaviour changes in
Sweden to strict curfews, e.g. in France and Spain (Deutsche Welle 2020a). The public
health strategy to contain the virus spread is commonly known as ”flatten the curve”,
which refers to the epidemic curve of the number of infections: ”Flattening the curve
involves reducing the number of new COVID-19 cases from one day to the next. This
helps prevent healthcare systems from becoming overwhelmed. When a country has fewer
new COVID-19 cases emerging today than it did on a previous day, that’s a sign that the
country is flattening the curve” (Johns Hopkins University 2020).
In Germany, due to the federal political system, measures to ”flatten the curve” were
introduced on the national as well as the state level. As the German ”lockdown” has
no single date, we distinguish here between four phases of NPIs, of which the main
interventions were the closures of schools, child day care centers and most retail shops
etc. in calendar week 12 (phase 2), and the nationwide establishment of a contact ban
(attributed to phase 3), including forced social distancing and a ban of gatherings of all
types, on March 23, 2020. The German states Bavaria, Saarland, and Saxony established
additional curfews (see table 1). Occasionally, these governmental interventions were
criticized because of the social, psychological and economic impacts of a ”lockdown”
and/or the lack of its necessity (Capital 2020, Süddeutsche Zeitung 2020a, Tagesspiegel
2020a, Welt online 2020a). Apart from the economic impacts emerging from a worldwide
recession (The Guardian 2020), the psychosocial consequences of movement restrictions
and social isolation (resulting from NPIs) have also become apparent now in terms of an
increase of several mental health illnesses (Carvalho Aguiar Melo, de Sousa Soares 2020,
Mucci et al. 2020, Williams et al. 2020). The effects of (forced) isolation as well as school
and child day care closures are also visible through a worldwide increase in domestic
abuse (New York Times 2020), reported in Germany as well (Stuttgarter Zeitung 2020,
Süddeutsche Zeitung 2020b).
It is therefore all the more important to know whether these restrictions really
contributed to the flattening of the epidemic curve of Coronavirus in Germany (RKI

2020a). This question should be addressed from a regional perspective for two reasons.
First, in May 2020, the competences for the measures in Germany have shifted from the
national to the state and regional (county) level. In the future, counties with more than
50 new infections per 100,000 in one week are expected to implement regional measures
(see table 1). Second, a spatial perspective allows the impact of the German measures
of March 2020 to be identified. In his statistical study, the mathematician Ben-Israel
(2020) compares the epidemic curves of Israel, the USA and several European countries.
These curves demonstrate a decline of new infections, regardless of the national measures
to contain the virus spread. Furthermore, the study reveals the trend that the peak of
infections is typically reached in the sixth week after the first case report, while a decline
of the curve starts in the eighth week. This occurs in all assessed countries on the national
level, no matter whether a ”lockdown” was established (e.g. Italy) or not (e.g. Sweden).
The focus in the present study is on the main nonpharmaceutical interventions
with respect to the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, which means the
concrete ”lockdown” measures affecting the social and economic life of the whole society
(distinguishing from measures taken in most cases of infectious dieseases, such as quarantine
of affected persons). In the terminology of the present study, these are the phase 2 and
3 measures, denoted in table 1. Building upon the discrepancy outlined by Ben-Israel
(2020), the present study addresses the following research questions:
 Pandemic or epidemic growth has a regional component due to regional infection
hotspots or other behavorial or spatial factors. Thus, growth rates of infections
may differ between regions in the same country (Chowell et al. 2014). In Germany,
the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 differs among the 16 German states and
412 counties, clearly showing ”hotspots” in South German counties belonging to
Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria (RKI 2020a). Thus, the first question to be
answered is: How does the growth rate of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vary across the
412 German counties?
 The German measures to contain the pandemic entered into force nearly at the
same time, especially in terms of closures of schools, childcare infrastructure and
retailing (starting March 16/17, 2020) as well as the nationwide contact ban (starting
March 23, 2020). Ben-Israel (2020) found a decline of new infection cases on the
national level regardless of the Corona measures. To examine the effect of the
German measures, we need to estimate the time of the peak and the declining of
the curves of infection cases, respectively: At which date(s) did the epidemic curves
of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in the 412 German counties flatten?
 Regional prevalence and growth, as well as the mortality of SARS-CoV-2/COVID19, are attributed within media discussions to several spatial factors, including
population density or demographic structure of the regions (Welt online 2020b).
Furthermore, the German measures differ on the state level, as three states - Bavaria,
Saarland and Saxony - established additional curfews supplementing the other
interventions (see table 1). Focusing on growth rate and mortality, and addressing
these regional differences, the third research question is: Which indicators explain
the regional differences of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 growth rate and mortality on
the level of the 412 German counties?

Methodology
Logistic growth model

According to Li (2018), in simple terms, an infectious disease spread (pandemic or epidemic)
can be summarized as follows: At the beginning, one or more infectious individuals are
introduced into a population of susceptibles (non-infected/healthy individuals). As the
pathogen (e.g., virus) is transmitted from one individual to another, the number of infected
individuals increases over time. Depending on the regarded pathogen/disease, infected
individuals recover due to medical interventions and/or reactions of the individuals’

immune system and, in many cases, gain partial or full immunity against the pathogen
(e.g., through the development of antibodies against a virus). In other cases, infected
people may also die from the disease. In all aforementioned cases and on condition of a
stationary population, the number of susceptibles decreases and, thus, the number of new
infections decreases as well. As a consequence, the pandemic/epidemic slows down and
ends. The disease spread may also be contained by vaccination and/or other control and
preventive measures. Note that, technically, one must distinguish between an infection
and the disease which is (or may be) caused by the pathogen: ”Disease is not the same as
infection. Infection is said to have occurred when an organism successfully avoids innate
defense mechanisms and stably colonizes a niche in the body. To establish an infection,
the invader must first penetrate the anatomic and physiological barriers that guard the
skin and mucosal surfaces of the host. Secondly, the organism must be able to survive
in the host cellular milieu long enough to reproduce. This replication may or may not
cause visible, clinical damage to the host tissues, symptoms that we call ’disease’” (Mak,
Saunders 2006).
Analyzing the transmission and spreading process of infectious diseases involves the
utilization of mathematical models. Pandemic growth can be modeled by deterministic
models such as the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model and its extensions, or
stochastic, phenomenological models such as the exponential or the logistic growth model.
The former type of model does not depend on large empirical data on disease cases but
requires additional information about the disease and the transmission process. The
latter type of model is based on linear or nonlinear regression and only empirical data of
infections and/or confirmed cases of disease (or death) is required for model estimation
(Batista 2020a,b, Chowell et al. 2014, 2015, Li 2018, Ma 2020, Pell et al. 2018). Recently,
there have already been several attempts to model the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the
country (or even world) level, by using either the original or extended SIR model (Batista
2020b), the logistic growth model (Batista 2020a, Vasconcelos et al. 2020, Wu et al. 2020),
or both (Zhou et al. 2020).
In the present case, we regard the spread of the Coronavirus primarily as an empirical
phenomenon over space and time rather than its epidemiological characteristics. We
therefore focus on 1) the regional growth speed of the pandemic and 2) the time when
exponential growth ends and the infection rate decreases again. Apart from that, only
infection cases and some further information are available, but not additional epidemiological information. Thus, the method of choice is a phenomenological regression model. In an
early phase of an epidemic, when the number of infected individuals growths exponentially,
an exponential function could be utilized for the phenomenological analysis (Ma 2020).
However, officially reported SARS-CoV-2 infections in Germany (measured by the time of
onset of symptoms) declined from mid-March and the corresponding reproduction number
was estimated at R = 0.71 based on the case reports as of May 6, 2020 (RKI 2020a),
which indicates that the phase of exponential growth was exceeded at this time. Thus,
a logistic growth model is used for the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 growth in the German
counties.
The following representations of the logistic growth model are adopted from Batista
(2020a), Chowell et al. (2014) and Tsoularis (2002). Unlike exponential growth, logistic growth includes two stages, while assuming a saturation effect. The first stage is
characterized by an exponential growth of infections due to an unregulated spreading of
the disease. However, as more infections accumulate, the number of at-risk susceptible
persons decreases because of immunization, death, or behavioral changes as well as public
health interventions. After the inflection point of the infection curve, when the infection
rate is at its maximum, the growth decreases and the cumulative number of infections
approximate its theoretical maximum, which is the saturation value (see figure 1).
In the logistic growth model, the cumulative number of infected or diseased persons
at time t, C(t) is a function of time:
C(t) =

C0 S
C0 + (S − C0 ) exp (−rSt)

(1)

where C0 is the initial value of C at time 0, r is the intrinsic growth rate, and S is the
saturation value.

When empirical data (here: time series of cumulative infections) is available, the three
model parameters r, S and C0 can be estimated empirically.
In the present case, fitting the models is done in a three-step estimation procedure
including both OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) and NLS (Nonlinear Least Squares) estimation. The former is used for creating start values for the iterative NLS estimation,
while making use of the linearization and stepwise parametrization of the logistic function.
Following the representations of the linearization of the logistic growth model described
in Engel (2010), the nonlinear logistic model (formula 1) can be transformed into a linear
model (on condition that the saturation value is known) by taking the reciprocal on both
sides, taking natural logarithms and rearranging the function:

ŷ ∗ = b̂ + m̂t

(8)

In step 1, an approximation of the saturation value is estimated, which is necessary for
the linear transformation of the model. Transforming the empirical values C(t) according
to formula 7, we have a linear regression model (formula 8). By utilizing bisection (Kaw
et al. 2011), the best value for S is searched minimizing the sum of squared residuals.
The bisection procedure consists of 10 iterations, while the start values are set around
the current maximal value of C(t) (max(C(t)) + 1; max(C(t)) ∗ 1.2).
The resulting preliminary start value for saturation, Ŝstart , is used in step 2. We
transform the observed C(t) using formula (7) with the preliminary value of Ŝ from step
1, Ŝstart . Another OLS model is estimated (formula 8). The estimated coefficients are
used for calculating the start values of r̂ and Ĉ0 for the nonlinear estimation (Engel 2010):
r̂start = −

m̂
Ŝstart

(9)

and
Ĉ0start =

Ŝstart
1 + Ŝstart exp (b̂)

(10)

In step 3, the final model fitting is done using Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS), while
inserting the values from steps 1 and 2, Ŝstart , Ĉ0start and r̂start , as start values for the
iterative process. The NLS fitting uses default Gauss-Newton algorithm (Ritz, Streibig
2008) with a maximum of 500 iterations.
Using the estimated parameters r̂, Ĉ0 and Ŝ, the inflection point of each curve is
calculated via formulae 3 to 5. The inflection point tip is of unit time (here: days) and
assigned to the respective date tipdate (YYYY-MM-DD). Based on this date, the following
day tipdate+1 is the first day after the inflection point at which time the infection rate has
decreased again. For graphical visualization, the infection rate is also computed using
formula 2.

2.2

Estimating the dates of infection

In the present study, the daily updated data on confirmed SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19
cases, provided by federal authorities, the German Robert Koch Institute (RKI), is used
(RKI 2020b). This dataset includes all persons which have been tested positive on the
SARS-CoV-2 virus using a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test and reported from local
health authorities to the RKI. However, one must consider that neither the volume of
tests nor the criteria for conducting a test are constant over time: Up to and including
May 2020, almost exclusively people with acute respiratory symptoms were tested for
SARS-CoV-2, as, with few exceptions, the presence of relevant symptoms is an exclusion
criterion for testing in the RKI guidelines for medical doctors (IBBS 2020). In other words,
this testing policy is targeted at the disease (COVID-19), not the virus (SARS-CoV-2).
Thus, most of the cases in the present data are COVID-19 sufferers, whilst asymptomatic
infected people and individuals with milder course are underrepresented. In the vast
majority of cases, the date of onset of symptoms is reported in the dataset as well (an der
Heiden, Hamouda 2020). The test volume was increased heavily from calendar week 11
(127,457 tests) to 12 (348,619 tests) but remains in the same order of magnitude until
calendar week 18 (300,000-400,000 tests per week) (RKI 2020c).
The dataset used here is from May 5, 2020 and includes 163,798 cases. This data
includes information about age group, sex, the related place of residence (county) and
the date of report (Variable Meldedatum). The reference date in the dataset (Variable
Refdatum) is either the day the disease started, which means the onset of symptoms, or
the date of report (an der Heiden, Hamouda 2020). The date of onset of symptons is
reported in the majority of cases (108,875 and 66.47 %, respectively).
The date of infection, which is of interest here, is either unknown or not included in
the official dataset. Thus, it is necessary to estimate the approximate date of infection
dependent on two time periods: the time between the infection and the onset of symptons
(incubation period) and the delay between onset of symptoms and official report (reporting

delay). Taking into account the 108,875 cases where the onset of symptoms is known,
the mean delay between onset of symptons and case report is equal to 6.84 days. In
the estimation, an incubation period equal to five days is assumed. This is a rather
conservative assumption (which means a relatively short time period) referring to the
current epidemiological estimates (see table 2). In their model-based scenario analysis
towards the total number of diseases and deaths, the RKI also assumes an average
incubation period of five days (an der Heiden, Buchholz 2020). Taking into account
incubation period and reporting delay, there is an average all-over delay between infection
and reporting of about 12 days (see figure 2).
But this is just one side of the coin, as an inspection of the case data reveals that this
delay differs between case characteristics (age group, sex) and counties. In their current
prognosis, the RKI estimates the dates of onset of symptoms by Bayesian nowcasting
based on the reporting date, but not taking into account the incubation time. The RKI
nowcasting model incorporates delays of reporting depending on age group and sex, but
not including spatial (county-specific) effects (an der Heiden, Hamouda 2020). Exploring
the dataset used here, we see obvious differences in the reporting delay with respect to
age groups and sex. There seems to be a tendency of lower reporting delays for young
children and older infected individuals (see table 3). Taking a look at the delays between
onset of symptoms and reporting date on the level of the 412 counties (not shown in
table), the values range between 2.39 days (Würzburg city) and 17.0 days (Würzburg
county).
For the estimation of the dates of infection, it is necessary to distinguish between
the cases in which the date of symptom onset is known or not. In the former case, no
assumption must be made towards the delay between onset of symptoms and date report.
The calculation is simply:
ˆ i = doi − incp
di
(11)
ˆ i is the estimated date of infection of case i, doi is the date of onset of symptoms
where di
reported in the RKI dataset and incp is the average incubation period equal to five (days).
For the 54,923 cases without information about onset of symptoms, we estimate this
delay based on the 108,875 cases with known delays. As the reporting delay differs

Models of regional growth rate and mortality

To test which variables predict the intrinsic growth rate and the regional mortality of
SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, respectively, two regression models were estimated. In the first
model with the intrinsic growth rate r as dependent variable, we include the following
predictors:
 In the media coverage about regional differences with respect to COVID-19 cases
in Germany, several experts argue that a lower population density and a higher
share of older population reduce the spread of the virus, with the latter effect being
due to a lower average mobility (Welt online 2020b). It is well known that human
mobility potentially increases the spread of an infectious disease. Also work-related

commuting and tourism are considered as drivers of virus transmission (Charaudeau
et al. 2014, Dalziel et al. 2014, Findlater, Bogoch 2018). To test these effects, four
variables are included into the model: 1) The population density (P OP DEN S),
2) the share of population of at least 65 years (P OP S65), 3) an indicator for the
intensity of commuting (CM I) formulated by Guth et al. (2010), and 4) the number
of annual tourist arrivals per capita (T OU R) for each county. All variables were
calculated based on official statistics for the most recent year (2018/2019) (Destatis
2020a,b,c).
 In the media coverage, the lower prevalence in East Germany is also explained by
1) a different vaccination policy in the former German Democratic Republic and 2)
a lower affinity towards carnival events as well as 3) less travelling to ski resorts
due to lower incomes (Welt online 2020b). Thus, a dummy variable (1/0) for East
Germany is included in the model (EAST ).
 We test for the influence of different governmental interventions by including dummy
variables for the states (”Länder”) Bavaria (BV ), Saarland (SL), Saxony (SX) and
North Rhine Westphalia (N RW ), as well as Baden-Wuerttemberg (BW ). Unlike
the other 13 German states, the first three states established a curfew additional
to the other measures at the time of phase 3, as is identified in the present study.
Like Bavaria, North Rhine Westphalia and Baden-Wuerttemberg belong to the
”hotspots” in Germany, with the latter state having a prevalence similar to Bavaria.
Saxony has a prevalence below the national average (RKI 2020a).
 Apart from any interventions, when a disease spreads over time, also the susceptible
population must decrease over time. As more and more individuals get infected
(maybe causing temporal or lifelong immunization or, in other cases, death), there
are continually fewer healthy people to get infected (Li 2018) (see also section
2.1). Consequently, regional growth speed must decrease with increasing regional
prevalence and over time (and vice versa). Considering the specific case of SARSCoV-2/COVID-19, as the outbreak differs within German counties (starting with
”hotspots” like Heinsberg or Tirschenreuth county), we have to assume that differences in growth are due to different periods of time the virus is present and
differences in the corresponding prevalence, respectively. Thus, two control variables
are included in the model, the county-specific prevalence (P RV ) and the number of
days since the first (estimated) infection (DAY S).

In the second model for the explanation of regional mortality (M RT ), five more
independent variables have to be incorporated:
 From the epidemiological point of view, the ”risk group” of COVID-19 for severe
courses (and even deaths) is defined as people of 60 years and older. The arithmetic
mean of deceased attributed to COVID-19 is equal to 81 years (median: 82 years).
Out of 6,831 reported deaths on May 5 2020, 6,524 were of age 60 or older (95.51
%). This is, inter alia, because of outbreaks in residential homes for the elderly
(RKI 2020a). Thus, the raw data from the RKI (RKI 2020b) was used to calculate
the share of confirmed infected individuals of age 60 or older in all infected persons
for each county (IN F S60), which is included into the regression model for regional
mortality.
 Several health-specific variables are found to influence the mortality risk (as well
as the risk of severe course) of COVID-19. These individual-specific risk factors
include, inter alia, diabetes, obesity, other respiratory diseases, or smoking (Engina
et al. 2020, Selvan 2020). There are several possible health indicators which are
unfortunately not available for German counties. Thus, the average health situation
is captured by incorporating the average regional life expectancy into the model
(LEXP ), which is made available by the German Federal Institute for Research on
Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development (BBSR) (BBSR 2020).
 On the regional level, air pollution was found to be a contributing factor to COVID-19
fatality (Ogen 2020, Wu et al. 2020). According to Wu et al. (2020), the regional air

pollution with respect to particulate matter (annual mean of daily P M10 values, unit:
µg/m3 ) is included into the model (P M 10). As Ogen (2020) shows a correlation
between nitrogen dioxide concentration and COVID-19 fatality, this type of air
pollution (annual mean of daily N O2 values, unit: µg/m3 ) is incorporated into the
model as well (N O2). Both air quality indicators are made available by the German
Environment Agency (UBA 2020a) on the level of single monitoring stations. These
stations are available geocoded (UBA 2020b) and have been assigned to the German
counties via a nearest neighbor join. Thus, the county-level values of both indicators
equal the values of the nearest monitoring station.
 The intrinsic growth rate of each county is incorporated into the model as well.
Considering the chronology of an infectious disease spread, there must be a reciprocal
relationship between growth speed and mortality: The more individuals die in the
context of the regarded disease, the less susceptibles are left to be infected, resulting
in a deceleration of the pandemic spread (Li 2018) (see also section 2.1). Thus,
there must be a negative correlation between mortality and growth rate, all other
things being equal. Consequently, the county-specific intrinsic growth rate (r) is
included as control variable.

See table 4 for all variables included into the models. All continuous variables,
including the dependent variables (r and M RT , respectively), were transformed via
natural logarithm in the regression analysis. This leads to an interpretation of the
regression coefficients in terms of elasticities and semi-elasticities (Greene 2012). Two
variants were estimated for the growth rate model (with and without dummy variables)
and three for the mortality model (with and without growth rate as well as a third model
including both growth rate and dummy variables). The minimum significance level was
set to p ≤ 0.1. In the first step, the regression models were estimated using an Ordinary
Least Squares (OLS) approach and tested with respect to multicollinearity using variance
inflation factors (V IF ) with a critical value equal to five (Greene 2012).
However, SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 cases are obviously not evenly distributed across
all German counties as the disease spread started in a few ”hotspots” in Bavaria, BadenWuerttemberg and North Rhine Westphalia (RKI 2020a, Tagesspiegel 2020b). Of course,
an infectious disease can be transmitted across county borders, in particular, by contact
between residents of one region and a nearby region. As a consequence, it is to be
expected that indicators of disease spread - such as the regarded variables growth rate
and mortality - are similar between nearby regions. Thus, further model-based analyses
require considering possible spatial autocorrelation in the dependent variables (Griffith
2009). Consequently, both dependent variables were tested for spatial autocorrelation
using Moran’s I-statistic and the model estimation was repeated using a spatial lag
model. In this type of regression model, spatial autocorrelation is modeled by a linear
relationship between the dependent variable and the associated spatially lagged variable,
which is a spatially weighted average value of the nearby objects. The influence of spatial
autocorrelation is captured by adding a further parameter, ρ (Rho), to the regression
equation, which is also tested for significance. Spatial linear regression models are not
fitted by OLS but by Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation. Both Moran’s I and the
spatial lag model require a weighting matrix to define the proximity of the regarded spatial
object to the other nearby objects (Chi, Zhu 2008, Rusche 2008). Here, the weighting
matrix for the spatial object (county i) was defined as all adjacent counties.

Software

The analyses in this study was executed in R (R Core Team 2019), version 3.6.2. The
parametrization of logistic growth models was done using own functions for the OLS
estimation based on the description in Engel (2010) and the nls() function for the final
NLS estimation. For the steps of the regression analyses and presentation of results, the
packages car (Fox, Weisberg 2019), REAT (Wieland 2019), spdep (Bivand et al. 2013),
and stargazer (Hlavac 2018) were used. For creating maps, QGIS (QGIS Development
Team 2019), version 3.8, was used, including the plugin NNJoin (Tveite 2019) for one
further analysis.

Results
Estimation of infection dates and national inflection point

Figure 3 shows the estimated dates of infection and dates of report of confirmed cases
and deaths for Germany. The curves are not shifted exactly by the average delay period
because of the different delay times with respect to case characteristics and county. The
average time interval between estimated infection and case reporting is x̄ = 11.92 [days]
(SD = 5.21). When applying the logistic growth model to the estimated dates of infection
in Germany, the inflection point for whole Germany is at March 20, 2020.
Before switching to the regional level, we take into account the statistical uncertainty
with respect to the estimation of the infection dates. About one third of the delay values
for the time between onset of symptoms and case reporting was estimated by a stochastic
model. Furthermore, the estimates of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 incubation period differ
from study to study. This is why in the present case a conservative - which means a
small - value of five days was assumed. Thus, we compare the results when including 1)
the 95% confidence intervals of the response from the model in formula 12, and 2) the
95% confidence intervals of the incubation period as estimated by Linton et al. (2020).
Figure 4 shows three different modeling scenarios, the mean estimation and the lower
and upper bound of incubation period and delay time, respectively. The lower bound
variant incorporates the lower bound of both incubation period and delay time, resulting
in smaller delay between infection and case reporting and, thus, a later inflection point.
The upper bound shows the counterpart. On the basis of the upper bound, the inflection
point is already on March 19. Using the higher values of incubation period estimated by
Backer et al. (2020), the upper bound results in an inflection point at March 17, while
the lower bound variant leads to the turn on March 20. Considering confidence intervals
of incubation period and delay time, the inflection point for the whole of Germany can
be determined as occurring between March 17 and March 20, 2020 (see table 5).

Estimation of growth rates and inflection points on the county
level

Figure 5 shows the estimated intrinsic growth rates (r) for the 412 counties. Figure 6
provides six examples of the logistic growth curves with respect to four counties identified
as ”hotspots” (Tirschenreuth, Heinsberg, Greiz and Rosenheim) and two counties with a
low prevalence (Flensburg and Uckermark). There are obviously differences in the growth

rates, following a spatial trend: The highest growth rates can be found in counties in
North Germany (especially Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein) and East Germany
(especially Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Thuringia and Saxony). To the contrary,
the growth rates in Baden-Wuerttemberg and North Rine Westphalia appear to be quite
low. Taking a look at the time the disease is present in the German counties, measured
by the first estimated infection date (see figure 7), the growth rates tend be much smaller
the longer the time since the disease appeared in the county.
The regional inflection points indicate the day with the local maximum of infection
rate. From this day forth, the exponential disease growth turns into degressive growth.
In figure 8, the dates of the first day after the regional inflection point are displayed,
while categorizing the dates according to the coming into force of relevant nonpharmaceutical interventions (see table 1). Table 6 summarizes the number of counties and the
corresponding population shares by these categories. Figure 9 shows the intrinsic growth
rate (y axis) and the day after the inflection point (colored points) against time (x axis).
Figure 10 shows the same information against regional prevalence (x axis).
In 255 of 412 counties (61.89 %) with 54.58 million inhabitants (65.66 % of the national
population), the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infections had already decreased before forced
social distancing etc. (phase 3 of measures) came into force (March 23, 2020). In a
minority of counties (51, 12.38 %), the curve already flattened before the closing of schools
and child day care centers (March 16-18, 2020), six of them exceeded the peak of new
infections even before March 13 (This category refers to the appeals of chancellor Merkel
and president Steinmeier on March 12). In 157 counties (38.11 %) with a population of
28.54 million people (34.34 % of the national population), the decrease of infections took
place within the time of strict regulations towards social distancing and ban of gatherings.
The average time interval between the first estimated infection and the respective
inflection point of the county is x̄ = 30.32 [days]. However, the time until inflection point
is characterized by a large variance (SD = 11.92), but this may be explained partially by
the (de facto unknown) variance in the incubation period and the variance in the delay
between onset of symptoms and reporting date.
In all counties, the inflection points lie within March 6 and April 18, 2020, which means
a time period of 43 days between the first and the last flattening of a county’s epidemic
curve. The first decrease can be determined in Heinsberg county (North Rhine Westphalia;
254,322 inhabitants), which was one of the first Corona ”hotspots” in Germany. The
estimated inflection point here took place at March 6, 2020, leading to a date of the first
day after the inflection point of March 7. The latest estimated inflection point (April 18,
2020) took place in Steinburg county (Schleswig-Holstein; 131,347 inhabitants).
As figure 9 shows, the intrinsic growth rates, which indicate an average growth level
over time, and inflection points of the logistic models are linked to each other. Growth
speed declines over time (see also the maps in figures 5 and 9), more precisely, it declines
in line with the time the disease is present in the regarded county (Pearson correlation
coefficient of -0.47, p < 0.001). The longer the time between inflection point and now, the
lower the growth speed, and vice versa. This process takes place over all German counties
with a time delay depending on the first occurrence of the disease. As shown in figure 10,
there is also a negative correlation between regional prevalence and growth rate (Pearson
correlation coefficient of -0.722, p < 0.001). These relationships, which are closely linked

Regression models for intrinsic growth rates and mortality

The variables of most interest used within the models are displayed in the maps in figures
11 (prevalence, P RV ), 12 (mortality, M RT ) and 13 (share of infected individuals of
age ≥ 60, P OP S65). Additionally, figure 14 shows the current case fatality rate on the
county level. Tables 7 and 8 show the estimation results for the OLS regression models
explaining the intrinsic growth rates and the mortality, respectively, both transformed via

without the state dummy variables (table 7). From the aspect of explained variance, the
second OLS model provides a better fit (R2 = 0.731 and Adj.R2 = 0.723, respectively)
compared to the first (R2 = 0.678 and Adj.R2 = 0.672, respectively), thus, the second
model is to be preferred for interpretation. Different than expected, population density
(P OP DEN S) does not affect growth rate positively. In contrary to the assumptions, a 1%
increase of population density decreases the growth rate by 0.1%. Also the demographic
indicator (P OP S65) is correlated with growth in a way which is opposite to the assumed:
An increase of 1% in the share of inhabitants of age ≥ 65 increases the growth rate by 1.2
%. As expected, the intensity of commuting (CM I) has a significant positive effect on the
intrinsic growth rate: An increase of commuting intensity by 1% increases the growth rate
by 0.4%. Tourist density (T OU R) is only significant in the first model. On average, the
intrinsic growth rate is significantly higher in Bavarian counties (dummy variable BV ),
while it is significantly lower in Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalian counties (SL and
SX, respectively). The coefficients for Baden-Wuerttemberg (BW ) and Saarland (SL)
are not significant, which means that no significant deviation from the average growth
rate is found for counties in these German states. The EAST dummy is not significant in
both models. Considering the necessary control variables, the current prevalence (P RV )
and time (DAY S) decelerate the growth of infections significantly. The former has a
nearly proportional impact: An increase of prevalence equal to 1% decreases the intrinsic
growth rate by 1.04%. For each day SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 is present in the county,
the growth speed declines on average by 1.4%. Here, one has to keep in mind that these
relationships are reciprocal and represent the mandatory decline of susceptible individuals
over time.
For the prediction of mortality (M RT ), the growth rate (r) and the state dummy
variables (BV , SL, SX and N RW ) are entered into the model analyis successively,
resulting in three models (table 8). When comparing models 1 and 2, adding the growth
rate as independent variable increases the explained variance substantially (Adj.R2 = 0.219
and 0.367, respectively). The third model provides the best fit, adjusted for the number
of explanatory variables (Adj.R2 = 0.383). No significant influence can be found for the
spatial (P OP DEN S), demographic (P OP S65) and mobility variables (P I and T OU R)
as well as the air pollution variables (P M 10 and N O2). Life expectancy (LEXP ) and
the dummy for East German counties (EAST ) are only significant in the first model.
However, the share of infected people of age ≥ 60 (IN F S60) significantly increases the
regional mortality: An increase in the share of people of the ”risk group” in all infected
by 1% increases the mortality by approx. 0.5%. The only significant state-specific effect
can be identified with respect to Bavaria: The mortality in Bavarian counties is higher
than in the counties belonging to other states. Furthermore, a two-sample t-test reveals
that Bavarian counties have a significantly higher share of infected belonging to the risk
group (x̄ = 31.11%) compared to the remaining states (x̄ = 29.28%), with a difference of
1.83 percentage points (p = 0.054). The reciprocal relationship between mortality and
growth rate is also significant.
However, as expected, spatial autocorrelation can be detected among the dependent
variables. The Moran’s I-statistic for both regional growth rate and mortality (0.49 and
0.16, respectively) is significant (see table 9). By consequence, the OLS estimations might
not be robust, which leads to a further exploration of the relationships to be detected in
terms of the spatial lag models which incorporate the spatial autocorrelation effect.
With respect to the spatial lag model for regional growth rates (table 10), the
Rho parameter in both model variants is significant (Rho = 0.158 and Rho = 0.095,
respectively), which indicates a significant spatial lag effect. However, when comparing
the second spatial lag model (with AIC = 674.96, which is superior to model 1 with
AIC = 733.37) to the second OLS model (see table 7), there are only negligible differences
in the parameter estimates and significance levels, respectively: The same independent
variables are found to be significantly correlated with growth rates. They also have the
same sign, which indicates the same direction of influence. Intrinsic growth rates on
the county level are predicted by population density (approx. -0.9), population share
of 65 and older (approx. 1.1), commuting intensity (approx. 0.4), and state-specific
dummy variables (Bavaria: approx. 0.5, Saxony: approx. -0.5, North Rhine Westphalia:

approx. -0.4) as well as the control variables (Prevalence: approx. -1.0 and time since
first infection: approx. -0.01).
The same conclusion must be made with respect to the spatial lag models for mortality
(table 11), when comparing them to the OLS models (table 8). The spatial lag effect
is only significant in the first model (Rho = 0.165) but not in model 2 (Rho = 0.042)
and 3 (Rho = −0.044). Regional mortality is significantly influenced by the share of
infected people of age ≥ 60 (approx. 0.5) and the dummy variable for Bavarian counties
(approx. 1.2) as well as correlated with regional growth rates (approx. -1.6). As spatial
autocorrelation was also detected for the regional growth rate, which is an independent
variable in the mortality models, a further robustness check of the estimations is necessary:
Table 12 shows the results for the second and third mortality model in a spatial Durbin
model, which incorporates a spatial lag effect for both the dependent variable (Rho) and
the regional growth rate (lag ln (r)). The lag effect of ln(r) is statistically significant,
but the other results remain qualitatively the same (share of infected people of age ≥ 60:
approx. 0.5; dummy variable for Bavarian counties: approx. 1).
With respect to the regression models for regional growth and mortality, the results
of the OLS estimations were confirmed by those from the models incorporating spatial
autocorrelation. Although there is obvious spatial autocorrelation (which can be explained
plausibly by interregional transmission of the infectious disease), both OLS and spatial
regression models show nearly the same results with respect to strength and direction
of correlations. From the spatial statistic point of view, this can be explained with
the incorporated independent variables as regional differences in both growth rate and
mortality are predicted entirely by the interregional variation in causal factors.

Discussion
Curve flattening in the context of nonpharmaceutical interventions

Taking a look at the national level, the flattening of the epidemic curve in Germany
occurred between three to six days before phase 3 of measures (as defined in this study)
came into force. Due to this temporal mismatch, the decline of infections can not be
causally linked to the nationwide formal ”lockdown” (including forced social distancing
and ban of gatherings) of March 23. Note that the results for whole Germany, estimating
the inflection point between March 17 and March 20, are rather conservative when
compared with the RKI estimations. In the RKI nowcasting study, the peak of onset of
symptoms (not infection time, which is not considered in the mentioned study) is found
at March 18 and a stabilization of the reproduction number equal to R = 1 at March 22
(an der Heiden, Hamouda 2020). Subtracting an average incubation period of five days
from these dates, the peak of infections occured around March 13 and the reproduction
number stabilizes approximately at March 17. The former RKI study (an der Heiden,
Buchholz 2020) estimated the peaks between June and July, depending on the parameters
of the scenarios.
The main focus of this analysis is the regional level, which reveals a more differentiated
picture. In all German counties the curves of infections clearly flattened within a time

period of about six weeks from the first to the last county. On average, it took one
month from the first infection to the inflection point of the epidemic curve. However, the
regional trend change in infections is not in line with the governmental nonpharmaceutical
interventions to contain the virus spread. In nearly two thirds of the German counties
which account for two thirds of the German population, the flattening of the infection
curve occured before the ”lockdown” (measures of phase 3) came into force (March 23).
One in eight counties experienced a decline of infections even before the closures of schools,
child day care facilities and retail facilities, which is attributed to phase 2 of interventions
in this study. Consequently, in a majority of counties, the regional decline of infections
can not be attributed to the formal ”lockdown”. In a minority of counties, also closures
of educational and retail facilities (measures of phase 2) cannot have caused the decline.
While keeping in mind that SARS-CoV-2 emerged at different times across the counties,
it is at least questionable whether these measures primarily caused the flattening of the
infection curve in the other counties. Furthermore, in a minority of counties, the regional
trend change occurred several weeks (up to about four weeks) after the nonpharmaceutical
interventions came into force. One might argue that there could be a time lag between
the date of official enforcement of the regulations and the time they became effective in
practice. However, this could only be conceivable for the contact ban but not for the
closures of schools and other services as these infrastructures are either closed or not and,
thus, can be potential places of virus transmission or not. Moreover, it seems unlikely
that an intervention like a contact ban becomes effective only after several weeks and
regionally differentiated.
Bringing together these aspects, regional curve flattening seems to have occurred
independently from the governmental measures of phase 2 and 3. Instead, regional
pandemic growth appears as a function of time, reaching the peak of infection rates with
a time lag depending on the date the virus emerged.
The results presented here tend to support the findings in the study by Ben-Israel
(2020) that curve flattening in the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic occurs with or
without a strict ”lockdown”. However, the mentioned study does not provide explicit
epidemiological, virological or other kinds of clarifications for this phenomenon, neither
the present study does. The further interpretation must be limited to a collection of
explanation attempts, which are non-mutually exclusive. Some reasons for the decline of
infections relate to other types of interventions both voluntary and mandatory:
 First of all, it must be pointed out that the focus of this study is on regional
pandemic growth in the context of the nonpharmaceutical interventions of phase
2 and 3 starting in mid March 2020, especially the ”lockdown” from March 23.
One has to keep in mind that some interventions against virus spread were already
established in the first half of March (phase 1), e.g. the cancellation of large
events or ”ghost games” in soccer (see table 1). These early measures could have
contributed substantially to curve flattening, as the cancellation of events might
have prevented people from being infected in the context of so-called super-spreading
events, which play an enormous role during infectious disease spreads (Al-Tawfiq,
Rodriguez-Morales 2020, Stein 2011). Many infections and death cases attributed
to COVID-19 in the early phase of the pandemic in Germany can be traced back
to super-spreading events in February and early March 2020, such as in Heinsberg
or Tirschenreuth county (Tagesspiegel 2020b). Also, the domestic quarantine of
infected persons (which is the default procedure in the case of infectious diseases)
might have reduced new infections. In Heinsberg county, about 1,000 people were
in domestic quarantine at the end of February 2020 (Tagesschau.de 2020c), which
could explain the early curve flattening in this Corona ”hotspot”.
 Also media reports from China or Italy as well as appeals and recommendations
from the government could have influenced people to change their behavior on a
voluntary basis already in the first half of March 2020 (or even earlier), e.g. with
respect to physical distancing, thorough and frequent hand washing, coughing and
sneezing in the arm fold, or reducing mobility in general. Unfortunately, there is
no explicit indicator of changes in the individual behavior. However, some other

findings give a hint towards voluntary behavorial changes: Several surveys show
a high degree of public awareness in Germany (and other countries) towards the
SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 threat already in February and the first half of March
2020 (Ipsos 2020, YouGov 2020). This increasing awareness might be reflected by
more caution in daily life: The RKI has documented an ”abrupt” decline of other
infectious respiratory diseases with shorter incubation periods (such as influenza)
in Germany since the 10th calendar week (March 2 to 8, 2020). This decline is
regarded as ”extremely unusual” (Buchholz et al. 2020). This reduction might be
attributed to voluntary cautious behavior in the context of the public discussion
towards SARS-CoV-2, as this decrease started before any public health intervention
came into force (except for the quarantines of SARS-CoV-2-infected persons, see
table 1). Furthermore, the analysis of mobility patterns shows a decline of mobility
in Germany, starting already in the first half of March 2020. Additionally, a strong
correlation between (aggregated) mobility and the acceptance of social restrictions
(obtained by surveys) was found: The higher the agreement with the statement
”I think the current measures are too strict”, the higher the increase in mobility
(Covid-19 Mobility Project 2020a,b). All these phenomenons suggest voluntary
behavior changes within the (German) population, which reduce the transmission of
infectious diseases and preceded the ”lockdown” by several weeks. Another indicator
for an increased awareness in the (German) population - although not intended
or desired - is the enormous tendency of hoarding groceries, which started in the
second half of February 2020 (Rheinische Post online 2020).
 Additionally, one has to keep in mind the seasonal cycle of respiratory viral diseases:
Influenza viruses and most cold viruses (including those from the family of Coronaviridae) mainly occur during the winter months due to changes in environmental
parameters (e.g., temperature and humidity) and human behavior (more or less
activities outside, whilst the risk of infection is, all other things being equal, less
outside) (Moriyama et al. 2020). Several virologists expressed cautious optimism
towards the sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to increasing temperature and
ultraviolet radiation (Focus 2020). Model-based analyses from biogeography show
that temperate warm and cold climates facilitate the virus spread, while arid and
tropical climates are less favorable (Araujo, Naimi 2020). By consequence, there
might have also been a decline of SARS-CoV-2 infections due to weather changes in
early spring (mid-March).

Furthermore, there is another possible reason for curve flattening with or without a
”lockdown”, which is of epidemiological nature and related to the transmission process of
SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 in the context of immunization. Note that ”immunity” may have
different causes (e.g., antibodies due to previous infections, vaccination, immunological
memory) and does not necessarily prevent individuals from being infected (in terms of
an invasion of an individual’s body) but leads to an effective response of the immune
system and prevents the emergence of (severe) symptoms (Mak, Saunders 2006). At the
beginning of the pandemic, two assumptions towards the role of immunization were stated:
1) Nobody is immune, which means that all individuals of the population belong to the
group of susceptibles, 2) Without any interventions (e.g., vaccine, nonpharmaceutical
interventions), herd immunity - a share of a population is immune, which provides
protection to those who are not immune, causing the pandemic to slow down and stop
- is achieved when about 70% of the population was infected and recovered (D’Souza,
Dowdy 2020). This percentage share is commonly known as herd immunity threshold
(HIT ) and is, in its basic form, calculated based on the infection’s basic reproduction
number, R0 : HIT = 1 − 1/R0 (Fine et al. 2011). Also early modeling studies focusing
the effect of nonpharmaceutical interventions are based on these (or similar) assumptions
(an der Heiden, Buchholz 2020, Ferguson et al. 2020). However, there are some issues
regarding the HIT for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 which need to be considered:
 In epidemiology, it is well known that disease transmission is mostly concentrated
on a minor part of individuals causing a large majority of secondary infections: ”In
what became known as the 20/80 rule, a concept documented by observational and

32

modeling studies and having profound implications for infection control, 20% of the
individuals within any given population are thought to contribute at least 80% to
the transmission potential of a pathogen, and many host-pathogen interactions were
found to follow this empirical rule” (Stein 2011). Gomes et al. (2020) incorporate
inter-individual variation in susceptibility and exposure to a SARS-CoV-2 infection into an epidemiological model (SEIR [susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered]
model). Depending on the assumptions on this overdispersion, the HIT of SARSCoV-2 reduces to 10-20%. Thus, the achievement of herd immunity would require a
considerably lower number of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
 Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly infective, the ”Heinsberg study” by Streeck
et al. (2020) found a relatively low secondary infection risk (secondary attack rate,
SAR). Infected persons did not even infect other household members in the majority
of cases. The authors conjecture that this could be due to a present immunity (T
helper cell immunity) not detected as positive in the test procedure. This kind of
immunity is not to be confused with (temporal or everlasting) immunity due to
antibodies against a specific virus but may be regarded as a functional immune
memory. In a current virological study by Braun et al. (2020), 34% of test persons
who have never been infected with SARS-CoV-2 had relevant T helper cells because
of earlier infections with other harmless Coronaviruses causing common colds. In
a study by Grifoni et al. (2020), SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells were detected in
even 40%–60% of unexposed individuals. If this explanation proves correct, the
absolute number of susceptible individuals would have been substantially lower
already at the beginning of the pandemy. Other Coronaviruses are responsible for
about 10-15% of seasonal ”common colds” (Padberg, Bauer 2006). Cross protection
due to related virus strains has also been determined e.g. with respect to influenza
viruses (Broberg et al. 2011).
 Considering the aforementioned aspects, we have to keep in mind that all data
related to infections used here underestimate the real amount of infected individuals
in Germany as well as in nearly all countries in which the Coronavirus emerged.
Typically, at the beginning of the pandemic, only suspected cases with COVID19 symptoms were tested, leading to a heavy underestimation of infected people
without symptoms (see section 2.2). Several recent studies have tried to estimate
the real prevalence of the virus and/or the infection fatality rate (IFR), including
all infected cases rather than the confirmed (see table 13). Estimated rates of
unreported cases (estimate PRV/reported PRV) lie between 5 (Gangelt, Germany)
and 50-85 (Santa Clara County, USA). Obviously, when estimated CFR values
exceed the estimated IFR values by ten times or more, there must be a large
amount of unreported cases and the total number of infected individuals must be
considerably higher than reported, respectively. The logical consequence is that
there is a hidden decrease of the absolute number of susceptible individuals because
of many infected persons without symptoms not knowing that they have been
infected (and probably immunized) in the past. These individuals were not tested
for the pathogen (SARS-CoV-2 virus) because they did not suffer from the disease
(COVID-19). Quantifying the ”dark figure” of SARS-CoV-2 infections by using
representative sample-based tests on current infection as well as seroprevalence will
be a challenge in the near future.

Of course, the present empirical results cannot prove or disprove the presence or absence
of (herd) immunity. However, the number of infected individuals is obviously quite
higher than reported (see table 13), whilst the number of susceptibles could have been
considerably smaller than expected already at the beginning of the pandemic. If a SARSCoV-2 infection leads to (lifelong or temporal) immunity (which is not yet clarified), the
current level of immunity must be higher as well. Similar results were found in the UK:
Stedman et al. (2020) also find decreasing infection rates (RADIR ) related to (reported
and unreported) prevalence on the regional level (Upper Tier Local Authority areas) and
conclude that ”the only factor that could be related to the RADIR in this analysis was the
historic number of confirmed number infection/,000 population suggesting that some of

the reduction in reported cases is due to the build-up of immunity due to larger numbers
of historic cases in the population”.
However, we have to keep in mind that even if herd immunity was achieved, this does
not mean that no new infections occur. Furthermore, herd immunity implies a closed
population, where there are too many immunized individuals to infect the remaining
susceptibles. In reality, there are migratory and mobility flows between regions and
nations (e.g., work-related commuting, tourism) and, thus, new infections may occur due
to transmissions driven by spatial interactions. More precisely, a susceptible individual
living in a given region with herd immunity might get infected when traveling to another
region. Finally, there is a difference between infection and disease, whilst the infectiousness
of asymptomatically infected individuals is not yet clarified, although they are regarded
as much less likely to transmit the virus than infected with symptoms (World Health
Organization 2020a).

4.2

Determinants of regional growth and mortality

Two regression models were estimated, including intrinsic growth rates (indicating the
speed of pandemic growth) and mortality (indicating the severity of the disease) as
dependent variables. For both variables, spatial autocorrelation was detected, which can
be explained comprehensively by virus transmission across borders of nearby counties.
However, both the OLS and the spatial regression models give qualitatively the same
results with respect to the correlations.
With respect to the determinants of growth speed, two explanatory variables have a
significant effect which is opposite to the expected: A slower disease spread is not due to
lower population density. In contrast, intrinsic growth rates decrease with higher density
values on the level of German counties. This could be explained with the validity of
this indicator as it is questionable whether population density is a sufficient proxy for
the amount and intensity of physical contacts between individuals. Although living in
larger and densely populated municipalities (such as large cities), there is no empirical
evidence that inhabitants automatically have more social interactions than in rural areas
(Mitterer 2013, Petermann 2001). There is also no dampening effect of virus spread by
an older population on the county level. Instead, growth rates increase with the share of
inhabitants of 65 years and older, although this age category covers the retired population.
This result might be due to a bias in testing for SARS-CoV-2 infections: Most tests in the
past were conducted on people with COVID-19 symptoms. As older people are more likely
to have a severe course of the disease, these age groups are obviously overrepresented in
the confirmed cases (RKI 2020a). Differing from the expectations, no isolated effect of
East German counties was found.
However, regional growth rates of infections are increased by inter-regional mobility,
especially with respect to work-related commuting. This result is quite plausible and
supports previous findings in the literature on empirical and model-based approaches
towards infectious disease spreads in the past (Charaudeau et al. 2014, Dalziel et al. 2014,
Findlater, Bogoch 2018).
Taking a look at state-specific effects, the results show a significant higher average
growth rate in Bavarian counties and lower growth rates in Saxony and North Rhine
Westphalia, while Saarland and Baden-Wuerttemberg counties did not deviate from the
all-over average. Thus, no dampening effect on pandemic growth can be confirmed for
German states with additional curfews for the containment of the virus spread (Bavaria,
Saarland, Saxony). The growth rate in Bavaria is even considerably above the average,
although the time since the virus emerged and the current prevalence were included into
the models as control variables.
With respect to the determinants of mortality, few clear statements can be made.
SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 mortality on the county level is not significantly influenced by
demographic, spatial or mobility factors. However, these variables explain the regional
growth rate, which was added to the mortality model as control variable (and is significant,
as expected). There is no specific ”East Germany effect” as well.
Considering previous studies on the influence of air pollution on COVID-19 severity
(Ogen 2020, Wu et al. 2020), it was expected that particulate matter and N O2 concentration would have an influence on mortality. Although it is plausible to assume that air
pollution increases fatality rates of respiratory diseases, this hypothesis was not confirmed
in the present study, which may result from an obvious data problem: The annual mean
values of daily pollution was obtained on the level of monitoring stations, which are not
evenly distributed across the counties and measure the air pollutant level at a specific
point (e.g. traffic crossroad). It is unlikely that these obtained values are representative
for the whole county. Thus, the validity of this indicator is questionable. Unfortunately,
county-based data towards air pollution is not available nationwide.
Obviously, the variance of regional mortality reflects the regional variance of infected
individuals belonging to the ”risk group”, defined as people of 60 years and above.
Although no regional data is available for cases and deaths in retirement homes, a large
share should be attributed to these facilities. Nationwide, people accommodated in
facilities for the care of elderly make up at least 2,473 of 6,831 deaths (36.20 %) as of May
5, 2020 (RKI 2020a). The share of residents of retirement homes in all COVID-19-related

deaths is equal to 51% in France and 33% in Denmark, ranging internationally from 11%
in Singapore to 62% in Canada (Comas-Herrera et al. 2020). The relevance of retirement
homes in Germany can be underlined with examples based on information available in
local media which depicts the regional situation:
 In the city of Wolfsburg (Lower Saxony), the current mortality (MRT) is equal to
41.08 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, while the current case fatality rate (CFR) is
the highest in all German counties (17.89 %). Both values are calculated from the
data used here (of date May 5, 2020). As of May 11, there have been 51 deaths
attributed to COVID-19 in Wolfsburg, with 44 of these deaths (86.27 %) stemming
from residents of one retirement home (Wolfsburger Nachrichten 2020).
 In the Hessian Odenwaldkreis with MRT = 54.75 and CFR = 14.60 %, 29 people
who tested positive to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 died until April 14, 2020, 21 of
them (72.41 %) were living in retirements homes in this county (Echo online 2020).
 In the city of Würzburg (Bavaria) with MRT = 38.32 and CFR = 10.75 %, there
have been 44 COVID-19 positive deceased in two retirement homes until April 24,
2020, leading to investigations by the public prosecution authorities (BR24 2020).
Up to April 23, 2020, in the whole administrative district Unterfranken, 64 % of all
people who died from or with Corona were residents of retirement homes for elderly
people (Mainpost 2020).

With respect to state-specific effects, there is a clear significant impact regarding
Bavaria: Although the measures in Bavaria, based on the Austrian model, were probably
the strictest of all German states, both regional growth rates and mortality are significantly
higher than in the other states. This effect is isolated, as other effects (time, population
density etc.) were controlled. In addition, the share of individuals belonging to the ”risk
group” is slightly higher in Bavaria. In the other states with curfews, Saarland and
Saxony, no significant impact of this additional intervention was found, especially with
respect to mortality which does not differ significantly from other states.

Conclusions and limitations

In the present study, regional SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 growth was analyzed as an
empirical phenomenon from a spatiotemporal perspective. Using infection dates estimated
from reported cases, logistic growth models were estimated for the disease spread at the
level of German counties as well as at the national level. The resulting intrinsic growth
rates vary across the 412 German counties. The inflection points of the epidemic curves
were contrasted to the dates where nonpharmaceutical interventions against the disease
spread came into force. As a result, whole Germany as well as the majority of German
counties have experienced a decline of the infection rate - which means a flattening of the
infection curve - before the main social-related measures (contact ban, ban of gatherings
and closure of ”nonessential” services) were established. In a minority of counties, curve
flattening even occured before schools and child day care facilities were closed. In contrast,
some regional trend changes took place several weeks after the measures came into force.
Due to this temporal mismatch, we have to conclude that the decline of infections can not
be causally linked to the ”lockdown” of March 23. Moreover, also the impact of school
and child care infrastructure closures on the pandemic spread remains questionable.
However, this does not mean that the disease spread slows down automatically. Four
possible reasons have been identified for curve flattening independent from school closures
and the ”lockdown”, with the first two relating to other types of (state-run and voluntary)
measures which could reduce the transmission of an infectious disease: 1) Positive effects
of previous governmental nonpharmaceutical interventions (especially the cancellation of
large-scale events), 2) voluntary behavior changes (e.g., with respect to physical distancing
and hygiene), 3) seasonality of the virus, and 4) a rising but undiscovered level of immunity
within the population. However, whether these determinants may have contributed to
the decline of infections, is outside the scope of the model-based analysis.

The determinants of regional intrinsic growth rates (as an indicator for the speed of
pandemic spread) and mortality (as an indicator of the disease’s severity) were explored
using regression models. Among other things, regional pandemic growth is found to
be driven by inter-regional mobility. Mortality on the county level obviously depends
on the level of infected individuals belonging to the ”risk group” (people of age 60 or
older). This share is considerably influenced by SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 outbreaks
in retirement homes for the eldery, which have occurred in many German counties.
Obviously, neither strict measures in Germany nor other countries were able to prevent
these location-specific outbreaks. By consequence, it must be concluded that the severity of
SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 depends on the local/regional ability to protect the ”risk group”,
especially older people in care facilities. This is the more important as virus transmission
in care homes is nearly independent from the nonpharmaceutical interventions concerning
e.g. schools, commercial services, and private residences. Three German states (Bavaria,
Saarland, Saxony) established curfews additional to the nationwide interventions. We
must conclude that these state-specific curfews did not contribute to a more positive
outcome with respect to growth speed and mortality.
On the one hand, these findings pose the question as to whether contact bans and
curfews are appropriate measures for containing the virus spread, especially when weighing
the effects against the social and economic consequences as well as the curtailment of
civil rights. One the other hand, when looking at regional mortality and case fatality rate,
the protection of ”risk groups”, especially older people in retirement homes, is obviously
of moderate success.
From the methodological point of view, two further conclusions must be stated:
Nonpharmaceutical interventions aim at the reduction of new infections, thus, their
impact must be assessed regarding temporal coincidences with new infections. Regardless
of the modeling approach used for the analysis of pandemic spread, any analysis concerning
the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions must be based on realistic infection
dates rather than reporting dates of infected persons. An over- or underestimation of
the time between infection and report - in particular, the reporting delay - might lead
to senseless conclusions towards the influence of specific measures. Estimating the true
infection dates from reported cases in official statistics is the biggest methodological
challenge in this context. Moreover, the present study reveals the importance of a spatial
perspective on pandemic spread: Spatially varying growth rates and severity measures show
that the spread of an infectious disease is to be regarded as a spatiotemporal phenomenon.
Thus, further studies should address regional differences of epidemiological variables with
respect to transmission.
However, despite these conclusions, the study is faced with two important limitations:
 One has to keep in mind that previous model-based simulation studies which
prove the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical interventions already make a priori
assumptions on the impact of these measures: In particular, the input parameters
of the epidemiological models (such as the intensity of physical contacts between
individuals) are set in a way that interventions (such as school closures or social
distancing) reduce the transmission of the virus in any case and, thus, the simulation
output shows a decline of infections subsequent to these interventions (an der
Heiden, Buchholz 2020, Ferguson et al. 2020). This type of modeling approach
(and the corresponding results) might be regarded either as a ”causal model” or
a tautology. In contrast, the modeling approach used here is of purely empirical
nature, only incorporating time series of infections. By consequence, the results
are not causal but correlative with respect to the presence or absence of temporal
coincidences. It can be shown that curve flattening does not coincide with the
focused interventions but occurred after previous interventions and might be due to
several other causes. However, the actual reasons why the infections declined cannot
be deduced from modeling results but must be explored based on interpretations
of several empirical hints. Furthermore, as the focus is on inflection points and
trend changes, respectively, the present empirical analysis cannot rule out additional
impacts of the German ”lockdown”, e.g., in terms of a stabilization effect.

Figure 15: Estimated infections, reported cases and conducted tests by calendar week
Source: own illustration. Data source: own calculations based on RKI (2020b,c)

 Finally, it is necessary to take a look at the informative value of the data on reported
cases of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 used here. While several statistical uncertainties
have been addressed by estimating the dates of infection in the present study, the
method of data collection has not been made a subject of discussion. The confirmed
cases of infections reported from regional health departments to the RKI result from
SARS-CoV-2 tests conducted in the case of specific symptoms. When aggregating
the reported cases to time series and analyzing their temporal evolvement, it is
implictly assumed that the amount of tests remains the same over time. However,
the number of tests was increased enormously during the pandemic - which is to
be welcomed from the point of view of public health. From a statistic perspective,
it might cause a bias because an increase in testing must result in an increase
of reported infections, as a larger share of infections is revealed, all other things
being equal. In his statistical study, Kuhbandner (2020) argues that the detected
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic growth is mainly due to increased testing, leading to the
conclusion that ”the scenario of a pandemic spread of the Coronavirus in based on a
statistical fallacy”. To confirm or deny this conclusion is not subject of the present
study. However, taking a look at the conducted tests per calendar week (see figure
15) reveals weekly differences in the amount of tests. From calendar week 11 to
12, there has been an increase of conducted tests from 127,457 (5.9 % positive) to
348,619 (6.8 % positive), which means a raise by factor 2.7. The maximum of tests
was conducted in CW 14 (408,348 with 9.0 % positive results), decreasing beyond
that time, rising again in CW 17. The absolute number of positive tests is reflected
plausibly in the number of reported cases (green line), as the confirmed cases result
from the tests. The most estimated infections occurred in CW 11 and 12, showing
again the delay between infection and case confirmation. Apart from the fact that
excessive testing is probably the best strategy to control the spread of a virus,
the resulting statistical data may suffer from underestimation and overestimation,
dependent on which time period is regarded.
