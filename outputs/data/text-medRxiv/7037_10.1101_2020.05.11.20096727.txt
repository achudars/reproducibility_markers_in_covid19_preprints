actions. We designed a longitudinal study in a hot outbreak zone to analyze the serial

51

findings between infected patients for detecting temporal changes from February 2020. In a

52

hospital-based open-cohort study, patients are followed from admission until one year from

53

their discharge (the 1st, 4th, 12th weeks, and the first year). The patient recruitment phase

54

finished at the end of August 2020, and the follow-up continues by the end of August 2021.

55

The measurements included demographic, socio-economics, symptoms, health service

56

diagnosis and treatment, contact history, and psychological variables. The signs

57

improvement, death, length of stay in hospital were considered primary, and impaired

58

pulmonary function and psychotic disorders were considered main secondary outcomes.

59

Moreover, clinical symptoms and respiratory functions are being determined in such

60

follow-ups. Among the first 600 COVID-19 cases, 490 patients with complete information

61

(39% female; the average age of 57±15 years) were analyzed. Seven percent of these

62

patients died. The three main leading causes of admission were: fever (77%), dry cough

63

(73%), and fatigue (69%). The most prevalent comorbidities between COVID-19 patients

64

were hypertension (35%), diabetes (28%), and ischemic heart disease (14%). The

65

percentage of primary composite endpoints (PCEP), defined as death, the use of mechanical

66

ventilation, or admission to an intensive care unit was 18%. The Cox proportional-hazards

67

model for PCEP indicated the following significant risk factors: Oxygen saturation < 80%

68

(HR= 6.3; [CI 95%: 2.5,15.5]), lymphopenia (HR= 3.5; [CI 95%: 2.2,5.5]), Oxygen

69

saturation 80%-90% (HR= 2.5; [CI 95%: 1.1,5.8]), and thrombocytopenia (HR= 1.6; [CI

70

95%: 1.1,2.5]). This long-term prospective Cohort may support healthcare professionals in

71

the management of resources following this pandemic.

Introduction

74
75

The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic was officially

76

announced by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an international public health

77

emergency. Aggressive growth in the number of those affected with COVID-19 makes this

78

virus such a threat. Patients were assessed for viral pneumonia through the ascertainment

79

and testing of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid utilizing whole-genome sequencing, cell

80

cultures, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition to high mortality rate, the

81

disease has caused severe psychological problems among patients [1]. The clinical

82

characteristics of COVID-19 patients were frequently reported [2]. Over 200 countries have

83

a substantial incidence to date, including countries from the Middle East, North America,

84

Asia, Australia, and Europe [3]. Currently, when COVID-19 is rapidly scattering

85

worldwide, and the number of cases in the Middle East is rising with increasing pace in

86

several affected areas, there is a need for immediate targeted action.

87
88

These high-risk procedures have implications for organization and medical practice

89

of hospital care during this outbreak. Health policymakers everywhere plan for pandemics

90

because their decisions can cause sharp shocks to societies and require a substantial and

91

massive change in health system capacity [4]. These problems, caused by the COVID-19,

92

emphasizes the importance of analyzing the epidemiological data worthwhile. The COVID-

93

19 studies have typically been focused on the initial clinical characteristics and the

94

epidemiological description [5]. A majority of infected patients had mild to severe lung

95

abnormalities on their chest CT scans when they were discharged from the hospital. Experts

96

believe such groups may need closer follow-ups [6].

98

According to our understanding, most of the studies related to this outbreak identify

99

the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of infected patients [7], the genomic

100

classification of the virus [8], and trials for global health governance [9]. COVID-19

101

Cohorts in the literature are either retrospective or in a short duration (less than three

102

months) [10–12]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study examining the

103

changing status of this virus and its psychological impact on the infected patients in the

104

Middle East. Although the epidemic is still ongoing, initial lessons from its spread can help

105

inform public health officials and medical practitioners to combat its progression.

106

Accordingly, long-term prospective Cohorts are valuable studies in this pandemic.

107
108

Iran is one of the countries with a high prevalence of COVID-19. It has been

109

revealed that half of the Iranians have limited health literacy, which is more common in

110

exposed groups, such as unemployed people, homemakers, and older people [13]. Isfahan,

111

the largest city in central Iran, with about 23000 positive corona cases, is among the three

112

top Iranian cities with a high outbreak. For the improvement of future preparedness plans

113

and provide a critical assessment of the resources and actionable items for stopping

114

COVID-19 spread, utilizing lessons learned from the coronavirus outbreaks in hot zones

115

could be helpful.

116
117

In this article, we present an effort to introduce an open-cohort from Isfahan,

118

Khorshid COVID Cohort (KCC) study, to compile and analyze epidemiological outbreak

119

information of COVID-19 infected patients. The objectives of our study are to provide a

120

longitudinal overview of the patients' condition and identify different related risk factors.

121

This longitudinal study aimed to analyze the following signs and symptoms findings in

122

patients with COVID-19 pneumonia for temporal changes and establish the incidence of

123

psychological disorders and related prevalent symptoms after discharge from the hospital.

124
125

It is the first study where the temporal progression between infected patients in the

126

Middle East is explored, to the best of our knowledge. Our research data are looked-for

127

developing evidence-driven policies to reduce the adverse effects of the increased outbreak

128

and psychological impacts. It may help government agencies and policy health makers

129

protect the psychological well-being of society in the face of the COVID-19 outbreak in

130

Iran and different parts of the world.

Study population

134
135

In this prospective hospital-based surveillance study, patients admitted for COVID-19

136

from February 2020 until September 2020 in the Khorshid Hospital in Isfahan were

137

recruited (Fig 1). Khorshid is the referral hospital for COVID-19 adults in Isfahan. About

138

fifty percent of the entire COVID-19 population from Isfahan refers to this hospital.

139
140

In this study, we diagnosed the COVID-19 patients based on the Chinese COVID-19

141

diagnosis and treatment guidelines, and the WHO provisional advice [14]. Then, in case of

142

a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or compatible Chest computed High-resolution

143

committee of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (IUMS) and the other national

145

authorities approved the study (IR.MUI.MED.REC.1399.029). The experimental protocol

146

was also conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki. Also, the entire subjects gave written

147

informed consent to the experimental procedure. The written informed consent was given

148

by the first relative family of patients with severe conditions. No minors participated in our

149

study. This Cohort has two phases. The first phase is on the admission information on

150

hospitalized patients until discharge or death. In contrast, the second phase is related to

151

patients discharged from the hospital for future symptoms or social factors. Six-hundred

152

patients were enrolled in the first phase, while four-hundred ninety patients with complete

153

information were analyzed in this paper.

Imaging protocol

187

We acquired the entire chest CT images using a 64-slice Philips scanner, with low-

188

dose protocol, between patients in the supine position, without the injection of contrast, and

189

at full inspiration. The images were evaluated by two radiologists with experience in thorax

190

imaging. A senior investigator with at least ten years of experience at interpreting chest CT

191

images resolved any disagreement. The following characteristics were recorded for each

192

CT scan: distribution (craniocaudal, and transverse), the pattern, and disease severity

193

according to a semi-quantitative scoring system [16]. Each CT scan was sub-classified

194

according to published RSNA guidelines to the following four groups: typical,

195

indeterminate, atypical, and negative [17].

196

Discharge criteria

197

Patients presenting the following criteria were discharged: per evaluation of the

198

treating physician, the clinical symptoms significantly improved (respiratory rate <20, pulse

Follow-up

205
206

The total follow-up time lasts for one year in our study (The 1st, 4th, 12th weeks,

207

and the first year). The following information of the discharged patients are being recorded:

208

clinical signs and symptoms at home, possible COVID-19 recurrence, underlying diseases

209

in their family, psychological symptoms, sleep quality, and related problems (Table 2).

210

Discharged patients are being followed up by telephone in the first and fourth weeks to

211

obtain whether they had any symptoms presented in Table 2. In the 12th week and the first

212

year, each patient attends the hospital to complete the Patient Health Questionnaire-9

213

(PHQ-9) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) [19]. Moreover, clinical

214

symptoms and the respiratory function (e.g., maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximal

215

expiratory pressure (MEP), and forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory

216

volumeone second (FEV1)) are being determined in the last two follow-ups.

We used the self-report PHQ-9 questionnaire to measure the depression severity,

221

with the total scores labeled as the following: severe depression (15–21), moderate

222

depression (10–14), mild depression (5–9), and no depression (0–4) [20]. Depression,

223

Anxiety, and Stress (DASS-21), a.k.a. Mental health status was measured based on

224

previous research [21]. The stress subscale was assessed using question numbers one, six,

225

eight, eleven, twelve, fourteen, and eighteen. The total stress subscale score was separated

226

into five groups: extremely severe stress (35–42), severe stress (27–34), moderate stress

227

(19–26), mild stress (11–18), and normal (0–10). The anxiety subscale was estimated using

228

question numbers two, four, seven, nine, fifteen, nineteen, and twenty. The anxiety subscale

229

score was also divided into five groups: extremely severe anxiety (20–42), severe anxiety

230

(15–19), moderate anxiety (10–14), mild anxiety (7–9), and normal (0–6). The depression

231

subscale was formed using questions three, five, ten, thirteen, sixteen, seventeen, and

232

twenty-one. The total depression subscale score was classified as extremely severe

233

depression (28–42), severe depression (21–27), moderate depression (13–20), mild

234

depression (10–12), and normal (0–9). It was shown that the DASS is a reliable and valid

235

method in measuring mental health between the Iranian population [22]. Note that the

236

DASS was previously used in the literature for the other coronavirus version like SARS

237

[23,24].

Outcomes

239
240

The initial results for the admitted patients were the following: Vital signs

241

improvement, including SpO2, pulse and respiratory rate, blood pressure, temperature,

242

intubation rate, death, and length of stay at the hospital. The secondary outcomes are

243

impaired pulmonary function, later signs and symptoms, psychotic disorders, sleep

244

disorders, and sustained end-organ failure. Moreover, The primary composite endpoint

245

(PCEP), defined as death, the use of mechanical ventilation, or admission to an intensive

246

care unit (ICU) [25], is reported in this paper.

247
248

The research team of professionals from Khorshid Hospital and clinical faculty

249

members of Isfahan University of medical sciences cross-checked the data. A trained team

250

of researchers independently entered the data into a computer-based database. In a case of

251

missing in the raw data, the coordinators were requested for clarification to contact the

252

corresponding clinicians. We obtained data from their pre-admission information based on

253

medical histories and through contact with their close relatives considering medical records

254

from previous hospital visits for patients who had consciousness problems on admission.

(StataCorp, College Station, TX). The patient characteristics were reported as a percentage

263

for categorical and mean (SD) for continuous data. The endpoint in this study was death or

264

cure from the entire COVID-19-related causes. We confirmed the endpoint by reviewing

265

hospital medical registration or by calling using the registered phone number. When the

study period finishes, individuals alive after a follow-up time are censored. Accordingly,

267

the subject outcome variable is death or censored after the follow-ups. In this manuscript,

268

Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for PECP associated with different baseline

269

factors were estimated using Cox proportional-hazards regression models.

270
271

We use survival analysis to identify the connection between the patient's attributes

272

with time from initial admission to death or the end of the follow-up after discharge are

273

considered as covariates. The life table is used to estimate survival after the first admission,

274

and a log-rank test is used for survival curves comparison according to different events.

275

Time-dependent Cox regression is used to calculate the adjusted hazard rate to determine

276

independent predictors of time to death [26]. Statistical tests were two-sided, and P-values

277

less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.

additional health information variables (Table 3). A total of 490 first COVID-19 cases with

283

complete information were analyzed in this manuscript, with the average age of

284

56.58±15.09 years (39%, female) admitted to the Khorshid hospital from February 2020.

(48% male). Thirty-four patients (7%) died. The top three leading causes of admission

287

were: fever (77%), dry cough (73%), and fatigue (69%). Sneeze (10%), runny nose (14%),

288

and abdominal pain (17%) were the least frequent symptoms among COVID-19 patients.

289

The top three prevalent comorbidities with COVID-19 were hypertension (35%), diabetes

290

(28%), and ischemic heart disease (14%). The characteristics of 76 patients with pneumonia

291

with a negative PCR test and CT-scan were provided in Table 3 as the control group. The

292

clinical symptoms of the control and COVID-19 groups were similar, except for fatigue and

293

dry cough. The control group was hospitalized due to the similar characteristics to COVID-

294

19 patients during the pandemic. The information of this group was provided instead of that

295

of healthy subjects, as the discrimination between pneumonia and COVID-19 could be

296

valuable.

The Cox Proportional-Hazards Model was used for PCEP (Table 4). Age was

306

categorized based on the Petrilli et al. study [27], and the reference category was set to 0-44

307

years old. The normal range of oxygen saturation (95%-100%) was set as the reference

308

category in SpO2. The developed survival model showed very good diagnostic accuracy

(AUC= 0.85) for discriminating COVID-19 patients with/without PECP.

Among 490 COVID-19 patients, 90 patients had positive PCEP. The following

332

characteristics were not significantly different in PCEP positive and negative groups: BMI,

333

occupation, marital status, number of infected family members, smoking status, and travel

334

history to the high-risk regions. However, the distribution of age (p<0.001), sex (p=0.010),

335

symptom duration (p=0.010), and quarantine before admission (p=0.0140) were

336

significantly different in PCEP positive and negative groups. Having analyzed the

337

comorbidities in PCEP positive and negative groups, although hypertension, Ischemic heart

disease, Immunological problems, COPD, and cancer were not significant, diabetes

339

(p=0.026), and acute kidney disease (p=0.008) were significant.

PCEP group, but it was not significant (p=0.051). Moreover, the lymphocyte counts

349

significantly decreased in the PCEP positive class (p<0.001).

350
351

The median time from admission to discharge was 5.0 days (interquartile range 3.0-

352

8.0). The transmission route was by a history of exposure to the epidemic area (16%) or

353

close contact with family members (25%), among which 10% of patients had both

354

exposures. The average symptom duration was 7.5 days. A significant reduction of this

355

time was observed in PCEP positive group respect to the negative group (p=0.010).

The significant factors for PCEP survival analysis were Oxygen saturation < 80%

361

(HR=6.275), lymphopenia (HR=3.457), Oxygen saturation (80%-90%) (HR=2.495), and

362

thrombocytopenia (HR=1.598). It was found that hypoxemia is associated with in-hospital

363

mortality and the oxygen saturation levels below 90% have high risks [28], which is in

364

agreement with our results (Table 4). Lymphopenia is also associated with the disease

365

severity of COVID-19 [29,30]. Moreover, thrombocytopenia was shown to be associated

366

with the severity and mortality of COVID-19 [31,32]. Although not significant, older age is

367

associated with mortality [33], similar to our findings. In our study, the PCEP risk was

368

higher in men than women (HR=1.505; Tables 3 and 4), which is similar to Pérez-López et

369

al. [34].

The clinical symptoms of the COVID-19 subjects discharged from the hospital were

372

shown in Table 5 for the first- and fourth-week follow-ups. Such symptoms were similar in

373

severe and non-severe cases, and the top three symptoms in the entire follow-ups and server

374

or non-sever groups were dry cough, dyspnea, and fatigue, among which fatigue and cough

375

were also observed in the three-month follow-ups of the study performed by Zhao et al.

376

[35]. Moreover, the prevalence of sleep disorder, hyposmia, and weight loss increased from

377

the first- to the fourth-week follow-ups (Table 5), emphasizing the long-term effect of

378

COVID-19.

379
380

This Cohort aims to identify the problems presented in COVID-19 patients from

381

first-time admission until death or one year after discharge. It is the first study in which

382

COVID-19 patients are followed up to identify trends in signs and symptoms in an outbreak

383

hot zone in the Middle East, to the best of our knowledge. It is required to perform

384

thorough research on the novel, appearing in human infectious coronaviruses. It is then

385

possible to explain their pathogenic mechanisms route and to recognize potential medicine.

386

When considering the social effects of the outbreak, it might be possible to develop useful

387

preventive and therapeutic medicaments. Moreover, the long-term analysis of psychological

388

distress and mental illness symptoms of such patients after hospital discharge was taken

389

into account in our Cohort. Such issues are fundamental, in general, in this pandemic [36].

390
391

According to our laboratory-confirmed cases, the common clinical manifestations

392

were fever (77%), dry cough (73%), fatigue (69%), and shortness of breath (67%). The

393

three most common clinical manifestations were consistent with the studies in China

394

[7,25,37,38]. In laboratory examination results, less than 20% of the patients had decreased

395

white blood cell counts. Also, the percentage of lymphocytopenia was 4%. It was in

396

contrast with other studies that reported that most of their patients had this problem [25,39].

Previous studies demonstrated that the elderly and those with underlying disorders

399

(i.e., cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary

400

disease) developed rapidly into ARDS, even leading to ICU admission or death [7].

401

Although our findings presented that the death and ICU admission rate was 7% and 14%, a

402

similar condition was observed. Cardiac complications, including heart failure, arrhythmia,

403

or myocardial infarction, are common in patients with pneumonia.

404
405

It might be possible to reduce the probability of COVID-19 incidence and distress,

406

reporting high-risk pathogens and social effects of this disease, which can help health

407

policymakers lead reasonable policies when using our cohort results. Most people show

408

mild symptoms. However, it may progress to ARDS, pneumonia, and multi-organ

409

dysfunction in older people and those with comorbidities [40]. Many patients who survive

410

acute viral pneumonia have impaired functions and health status in the first few months of

411

recovery. However, longterm sequelae are still mostly unknown [41]. Patients who

412

survived an episode of ARDS may have marked dyspnea and severe respiratory

413

physiological abnormalities. Although a one-year post-ICU follow-up study showed that

414

survivors of A(H1N1)-associated ARDS had minor lung disabilities [42], both obstructive

415

and restrictive deficits have been reported in patients with ARDS. The ARDS survivors

416

often suffer prolonged myopathy limiting daily living activities, post-traumatic stress

417

disorder (PTSD), and an increased number of deaths after apparent recovery. Such

418

problems usually exist for more than three months. Moreover, many patients show

419

continuous neurocognitive dysfunction for one to two years.

420

problems supportively, the knowledge of the PTSD persistency in such patients is required

421

[43].

423
424

The medical and public health infrastructure and the economy were affected by this

425

new virus outbreak worldwide [44]. Several studies have reported adverse psychological

426

complications, including confusion, symptoms of traumatic stress, and anger in cases who

427

encountered stressful situations. The long quarantine period, fear of disease, boredom,

428

despair, inadequate food shortages, insufficient information, stigma, and financial loss are

429

known as stressors in the COVID-19 epidemic [45,46]. Along with this, the primary

430

purpose of this study is to identify psychological problems among discharged patients for

431

one year.

432
433

It takes time to see how the virus affects our lives here in Iran and other parts of the

434

world. It is also possible to have similar future outbreaks. Besides limiting this outbreak,

435

preventive programs must be planned for such problems. It is of great importance when

436

considering the warning by the WHO chief as "the virus will be with us for a long time."

437
438

It must be mentioned that self-reporting used for the first two follow-ups has some

439

limitations compared to face-to-face interviews for the second and third follow-ups. Also,

440

psychological studies do not necessarily probe psychological services efficacy. Thus,

441

dynamic observations and more follow-ups are necessary. The larger sample size is also

442

required for result verification, which is available during the Cohort. Apart from such

443

limitations, it is possible to perform a risk assessment and to use medical data mining for

444

diagnosis and prognosis to identify complex interactions. Multistate models are the focus of

445

our future work to provide the stacked probability plots and to predict the length of the

446

hospital (or ICU) stay of COVID-19 patients.

Conclusions

449

The COVID-19 outbreak has become a clinical danger to the general population and

450

healthcare workers worldwide. However, knowledge about the trend of this novel virus,

451

which leads to different symptoms and outcomes, remains limited. The practical option of

452

different treatment, underlying disease, clinical findings, and different symptoms or signs

453

on the disease prognosis is under evaluation and development. What we can do now is to

454

design a cohort to follow patients to identify the underlying trend based on different

455

outcomes and their risk assessment. It may assist healthcare policymakers and government

456

agencies, and in the managing of health and resources following this pandemic.
