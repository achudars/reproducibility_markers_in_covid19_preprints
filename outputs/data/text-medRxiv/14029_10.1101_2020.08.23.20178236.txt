Abstract:
SARS-CoV-2 has caused a severe, ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Massachusetts with
111,070 confirmed cases and 8,433 deaths as of August 1, 2020. To investigate the
introduction, spread, and epidemiology of COVID-19 in the Boston area, we sequenced and
analyzed 772 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the region, including nearly all confirmed
cases within the first week of the epidemic and hundreds of cases from major outbreaks at a
conference, a nursing facility, and among homeless shelter guests and staff. The data reveal
over 80 introductions into the Boston area, predominantly from elsewhere in the United States
and Europe. We studied two superspreading events covered by the data, events that led to very
different outcomes because of the timing and populations involved. One produced rapid spread
in a vulnerable population but little onward transmission, while the other was a major contributor
to sustained community transmission, including outbreaks in homeless populations, and was
exported to several other domestic and international sites. The same two events differed
significantly in the number of new mutations seen, raising the possibility that SARS-CoV-2
superspreading might encompass disparate transmission dynamics. Our results highlight the
failure of measures to prevent importation into MA early in the outbreak, underscore the role of
superspreading in amplifying an outbreak in a major urban area, and lay a foundation for
contact tracing informed by genetic data.

Main Text
SARS-CoV-2 has now caused over 22 million infections and over 775,000 deaths worldwide ​(​1​)
in one of the worst public health crises of the past century. ​The early impact of the COVID-19
pandemic has been particularly severe in the state of Massachusetts (MA) in the northeastern
United States (US). The first case in the state was ​confirmed on February 1, 2020 ​(​2​)​; case
counts rapidly accelerated beginning in March and peaked in the third week in April​. The Boston
area, home to 70% of the population of MA, accounted for 79% of COVID-19 cases and 76% of
COVID-19 deaths in the state to this point ​(​3​)​. ​COVID-19 has disproportionately affected
vulnerable populations, particularly residents and staff in congregate living environments ​(​4​) and
racial and ethnic minorities ​(5
​ ​, ​6​)​. In MA, residents and healthcare workers in long-term care
facilities accounted for 22% of all confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 64% of all reported deaths
through August 1, 2020 ​(​7)​ .​

COVID-19, like previous coronavirus outbreaks ​(​8,​ ​9​)​, has been marked by the prominence of
superspreading events ​(​10​, ​11​),​ in which one individual infects an unusually large number of
secondary cases. (For this study, we define a superspreading event as the transmission of at
least 8 secondary infections from a single source, corresponding to the 99th percentile ​(​12​) for
an R​eff of 2.5.) More broadly, a great deal of SARS-CoV-2 transmission has occurred in clusters
of cases linked to events and gatherings, including on cruise ships ​(​13)​ ​, in churches ​(​14​)​, and
especially in congregate settings such as care homes ​(​15​)​, homeless shelters ​(​16​)​, and prisons
(​17​)​. However, the evidence indicating that these events drive transmission has been based
largely on time-series data showing an increase in cases following them ​(​18)​ ​. Case counts
alone have little ability to determine the contribution of any event to overall transmission or to

distinguish superspreading from other forms of locally intense transmission. Yet understanding
how the virus is actually spreading is critical for prioritizing public health interventions:
cluster-based spread may be controlled with more limited restrictions than the population
measures required to curb community-based transmission. Genomic data can reveal
connections between cases that cannot be detected through conventional epidemiology alone,
including direct evidence of superspreading based on shared viral sequences. To gain insight
into the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2, and to examine the role of putative
transmission linked to events and gatherings, we conducted a detailed genomic epidemiology
study of the Boston area epidemic.

Genomic Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 from the Boston Area
We performed viral genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2-positive
nasopharyngeal (NP) samples collected by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health
(MADPH) between January 29, 2020, and April 18, 2020, and by the Massachusetts General
Hospital (MGH) between March 4, 2020, and May 9, 2020. Our dataset includes nearly all
confirmed early cases of the epidemic in MA through March 8, 2020 (Fig. 1A-B); samples from
many of the highest-prevalence communities in and around Boston across the first wave (Fig.
1C), including Chelsea, Revere, and Everett (Fig. 1D-F, Fig. S1); and samples from putative

the Wuhan-Hu-1 sequence (NC_045512.2) as the reference (Materials and Methods). We
generated 778 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 assemblies (>98% complete) from 772 individuals, and
an additional 72 high-quality partial genomes (>80% complete) (Fig. 1A). Genome recovery and
coverage were strongly correlated with viral abundance and clinical diagnostic test results (Fig.
S2 and S3). Genomes were separated from one another by a median of 6 single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) (interquartile range 4-9 SNPs; range 0-85 SNPs) (Fig. S4A-B). As
expected during rapid population expansion, most alleles were rare, as assessed by a strongly
negative Tajima’s D statistic throughout the genome (Fig. S4C).

We constructed a phylogenetic tree from this dataset in the context of a global set of 4,011
high-quality genomes (Fig. 2A) drawn from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data
(GISAID) (Materials and Methods). Root-to-tip regression showed a clear, albeit noisy, temporal
signal in our dataset, with the fitted regression model accounting for 17% of the variance in the
root-to-tip distance (Fig. S5). The presence of a temporal signal means that a molecular clock
can be fitted to infer the timing of ancestral branching based on SARS-CoV-2 genomes. These
trees form the basis of our analysis of the Boston area epidemic.

Introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into Massachusetts
We identified putative introductions into MA through phylogenetic analysis using an ancestral
inference model (Materials and Methods). Most introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into MA occurred
early in the pandemic, in March and early April, primarily from elsewhere in North America and
from Europe (Table 1, Fig. 2D, and Fig. S6). We observed close connectivity between genome
sequences from MA and genome sequences from elsewhere in the Northeastern USA, in
particular New York (Fig. 2A). Close interstate connectivity is consistent with frequent domestic

travel, which continued even after international routes were closed. The fraction of cases that
were imported decreased over time (Fig. 2D), with the steepest decline during March (Fig. S6).
By April 2020, the vast majority of cases resulted from local transmission rather than importation
(Table 1, Fig. 2D, and Fig. S6). In total, we identified more than 80 likely introductions into MA
through May 9, representing sources on four continents (Table 1).

Early diagnosed cases in MA cluster in a way consistent with their known travel and exposure
history. This includes the first known COVID-19 case in MA, a traveler returning from Wuhan,
China (2)​. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from this case (named MA-1 by the
CDC), based on a sample collected January 29, 2020, revealed that it clustered with others
from China (Fig. S7), confirming its likely origin. Similarly, the viral sequence of the second
known MA case (MA_DPH_00002), collected on March 3 from a patient who had recently
traveled to Italy and Switzerland (21) clustered with European sequences (Fig. S8) and is
descended from the SARS-CoV-2 genome seen in a third MA case (MA_DPH_00003), a patient
who had been on the same trip. No other viral genomes in our dataset appeared to descend
from these 3 cases. Thus, quarantine and contact tracing efforts appear to have prevented
spread from the first known introductions into MA.

We also investigated the first cases of community transmission in MA, which occurred in
Berkshire County and included several patients who had attended the same public event.
Analysis of 5 viral genomes (1 complete and 4 partial) from these cases indicated that the
cluster involved at least 2 introductions (Fig. S9). Four of the genomes had the same consensus
sequence, indicating a common source, most likely within the United States (Fig. S10); based
on the presence of the C17747T variant (i.e. a T instead of a C at position 17747), it was

probably from the West Coast. We are unable to assess subsequent community transmission in
Western MA since our data does not include any later Western MA samples.

Investigation of Superspreading Events
Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in an International Business Conference
The first large cluster of cases in MA was recognized in the context of an international business
conference held in Boston from February 26 - 27 (​18)​ ​. Ultimately, more than 90 cases were
diagnosed in people associated with this conference or their contacts (​22)​ ​, raising suspicion that
a superspreading event had occurred there. Our dataset contains SARS-CoV-2 genomes from
28 of these cases, allowing us to look for genetic evidence of superspreading. Genetic evidence
of superspreading would take the form of phylogenetic clustering of identical or highly similar
viruses occurring in a narrow time window.

The signature of superspreading can indeed be seen in the conference-associated cases. All 28
genomes form a well-supported monophyletic cluster (Fig. 3A, Fig. S11) marked by the
presence of the SNP C2416T (Fig. 2B-C). The parent lineage of C2416T is defined by
G25563T, a lineage that was widely distributed in Europe in January and February 2020. ​The
estimated time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) for C2416T-containing genomes
is February 14 (95% highest posterior density (HPD) February 4 - February 20). The C2416T
variant first appears in the GISAID database in 2 French patients, ages 87 and 88, on February
29, 2020, and is absent from the 1,312 genomes in the database sampled prior to February 29
(Fig. 2C). In our dataset, all 27 C2416T-containing viruses collected prior to March 10​th were
sampled from individuals with conference exposure, consistent with publicly available CDC

genome data from MA cases from January 29 through March 7 (​24)​ ​. The rarity of C2416T in
February (Fig. 2C) makes additional introductions of this allele unlikely. Taken together, this
strongly suggests there was low-level community transmission of C2416T in Europe in February
2020 before the allele was introduced to Boston via a single introduction and amplified by
superspreading at the conference.

SARS-CoV-2 containing the C2416T allele subsequently spread extensively in the Boston area,
representing 261/744 or 35.1% of our dataset (exclusive of known-conference associated
genomes) (Fig 2B, see ​Sustained Local Transmission below). Beginning in early March,
C2416T also appeared in multiple other US states and other countries (Fig. 2A) and increased
steeply in frequency, comprising 319/11,938 (2.7%) of domestic and 937/56,118 (1.7%) of
global SARS-CoV-2 genomes in GISAID collected through June 28 (Fig. 2C). The
superspreading event appears to have contributed to this rise in frequency, as observed in two
ways. Firstly, we identified a second variant (G26233T) that shows strong evidence of emerging
during or immediately after the conference as it was first seen in 7 of 28 individuals with known
exposure to the conference, including in one sample from a conference attendee at intermediate
frequency (26%). C2416T/G26233T was subsequently exported from Boston to several US
states, including Virginia, North Carolina, and Texas, and to other countries, including Australia,
Sweden, and Slovakia (Fig. 2A, Fig. S12A-B), with evidence of community spread in Virginia,
Australia, and Michigan. Secondly, we assessed the extent to which US spread of C2416T
could be due to additional importations from Europe. Two European sub-lineages
(C2416T/G8371T and C2416T/G20578T) are extremely rare in the United States: 0/73
genomes and 1/228 genomes, respectively, compared with 24/197 genomes containing the
C2416T/G26233T mutations (Fig. S12C-D). This, along with epidemiological data connecting

multiple conference-linked cases to other US states (​25–
​ ​28​)​, suggests that most C2416T
viruses in the US likely derive from this initial introduction. However, we cannot estimate the
absolute number of individuals involved as sequenced genomes are not a random sample of
cases and US state-level data is highly incomplete at this time.

Spread of SARS-CoV-2 In Homeless Shelter Guests and Staff
To support public health investigations of transmission in high priority populations, we analyzed
the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in homeless shelter guests and staff served by the
Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program (BHCHP). Samples were collected in March and
April 2020 and included those collected during universal screening at Boston’s largest homeless
shelter​(​16)​ ​. From these samples, we assembled and inferred a phylogeny from 193
SARS-CoV-2 genomes (Fig. 2A, Fig. 3A and Fig. 3B). We identified at least 7 introductions into
the BHCHP population, including 4 that resulted in clusters containing 20 or more highly similar
viral genomes (Fig. 4A and Fig. 4C); a phylogenetic signature consistent with superspreading.
Two of the clusters were of genomes descended from the C2416T lineage: ​of the 193 genomes,
105 (54.4%) contained C2416T, and 54 of these 105 (51.4%) additionally contained G26233T,
demonstrating that BHCHP guests and staff were affected by community transmission resulting
from conference-associated amplification and spread of SARS-CoV-2.

Spread of SARS-CoV-2 In a Skilled Nursing Facility
We also investigated cases in another vulnerable population, cases that were involved in a
superspreading event at a skilled nursing facility (SNF) in the Boston area. Prior to a planned
relocation of residents in early April, universal screening detected SARS-CoV-2 in 82/97 (85%)
of the residents and 36/97 (37%) of the staff by RT-qPCR ​(​29​)​. We assembled 83 SARS-CoV-2

genomes from these individuals, 75 of which comprised a single cluster of closely related
genomes (59 identical), all containing a G3892T mutation (posterior support of 1 in maximum
clade credibility tree, Fig. 3A and Fig. 3B). The paucity of genetic variation within the cluster
implies that introduction into the facility had been recent and from a single predominant source
(Fig. 4A). Consistent with this, the median tMRCA for sequences in the cluster was March 20
(Fig. 3C, 95 % HPD: March 13 - March 24, 2020). The estimated tMRCA along with the high
proportion (30/45) of residents who tested negative on April 1, 2020, but were found to be
positive 5 days later ​(​29)​ suggests rapid spread within the facility in late March and early April
2020.

The genetic diversity in the SNF cluster is strikingly low even under the assumption of recent
transmission from a single source. The 18 mutations seen in the cluster is significantly lower
than what we would expect based on the conference cluster (p = 0.019), which occurred over a
similarly short time window, and much lower than the 30 mutations expected under a simple
model of SARS-CoV-2 substitution (p = 0.011, Materials and Methods). The low genetic
diversity in this cluster might simply result from low diversity in the index patient, but could also
reflect differences in the transmission process at work. For example, if more virions than usual
were transmitted to each SNF case, then the resulting infections would more often have the
same consensus genome as the index case.

In addition to the major SNF cluster, two other introductions, each containing three genomes,
can also be seen among the patients and staff in the SNF (Fig. 3A and Fig. 4B). There is strong
phylogenetic support for each of these two separate introductions (Fig 3A). The observation that
one introduction led to massive spread, while the other two did not, is consistent with reported

overdispersion of secondary infections in several coronaviruses ​(​8,​ ​12,​ ​30,​ ​31​)​; that is, there is
more variance in the number of secondary infections caused by each case than expected from
a random Poisson process. Although one clade predominated within this SNF, the occurrence
of at least three independent introductions underscores the high risk of introduction into a single
facility ​(​32​)​. These introductions occurred despite strict infection control policies—including a
restriction on visitors ​(​33​),​ universal masking for all staff, masking for all residents when leaving
their rooms, and vigilance with hand hygiene—in place for at least two weeks before the first
detected infection ​(2
​ 9)​ ​.

Investigation of potential nosocomial outbreaks
We investigated two case clusters at MGH for which the Infection Control Unit raised suspicions
of a nosocomial outbreak. In the first cluster, two patients in the same hospital ward tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 during their hospital stay after testing negative at the time of
admission. In the second cluster, five patients who received care in a speciality ward were
diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infections over a period of several days. For each cluster,
complete genomes (2 of 2 from the first cluster and 4 of 5 from the second cluster) were
inconsistent with a common ancestor during the period of hospitalization (Fig. S13). We
therefore rejected the hypothesis that the individuals in each cluster were part of the same
transmission chain, although we cannot exclude the possibility of nosocomial transmission ​per
se because independent introductions from multiple asymptomatic staff could theoretically have
occurred.

Sustained Local Transmission
Our dataset covers March 3 through May 9, an interval that spans the beginning, peak, and
initial decline of the first wave of the epidemic in MA (Fig. 1C). Several clades established early
in the Boston-area outbreak showed continued community transmission throughout that period
(Table 2, Fig. 3A-B), with the lineage containing C2416T, associated with the conference, being
the largest. The C2416T lineage was likely the first of these clades imported into Boston
(median estimated tMRCA, February 14, 2020; 95% HPD February 4 - 20, 2020) (Fig. 3C). The
other four major lineages (G3892T, G105T, G28899T, and C20099T) appeared to enter the
region between March and early April 2020. Consistent with a larger global trend ​(​34​, ​35)​ ​, we
observed a rise in frequency of viruses harboring the D614G amino acid polymorphism,
conferred by a SNP at nucleotide 23,403 in the Wuhan reference strain, which rose to
near-fixation in MA by the end of the study period (Fig. 2B) and is present in all of the dominant
lineages.

Based on tMRCA estimates for major Boston-area clades, we do not find evidence of
undetected, or “cryptic,” transmission before mid-February, although small outbreaks may have
gone undetected. In addition to the lineages reported here, none of the importation events we
inferred (Table 1) occurred prior to known cases, although testing for SARS-CoV-2 in MA was
restricted to a narrow definition prior to established community spread ​(​36)​ ​. In particular,
additional isolated events similar to the MA-1 importation may have occurred and escaped
detection with the current resolution of sampling.

Phylogenetic data, when labeled by patient zip code (Fig. S14), reveal that all major lineages,
including conference-associated viruses, were circulating in the Boston-area communities of
Chelsea, Revere, and Everett, which were among the most heavily affected communities in the
state (Fig. 1D). Thus, while viral lineages entered and were amplified by distinct mechanisms,
cases rapidly spread between communities (Fig. S15). C2416T was the most common lineage
in the Boston area throughout the study period and across sampling sites (Fig. S16). By the end
of that period, the cumulative allele frequency of C2416T in our dataset, exclusive of
conference- and SNF-associated samples, was 46.4% (194/418) in Suffolk, 30.1% (31/103) in
Middlesex, 30.0% in Essex (12/40), and 40.9% (9/22) in Norfolk counties. The conference
superspreading event likely had an outsized effect because it occurred early in the pandemic
(Fig. S17). Extensive spread within the Boston area likely then contributed to the rise in
frequency of C2416T and C26233T in the United States and worldwide (Fig. 2B-C).

Respiratory Viral Coinfections
The metagenomic approach we used for sequencing SARS-CoV-2 enabled us to screen for
respiratory viral co-infections in patients with COVID-19. We found other respiratory viruses in
20/1431 (1.4%) of COVID-19 cases (Fig. 4D) and confirmed these results using the BioFire
FilmArray Respiratory Panel (Fig. S18). The most common co-infecting viruses were
Rhinovirus/Enterovirus. The rarity of co-infections (lower than reported in an early dataset from
California ​(​37​)​) likely reflects the timing of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in MA, which began near
the end of the influenza season; weekly data from MADPH show rapidly declining influenza
activity in March and April 2020 ​(​38​)​. We observed a higher rate of co-infection with other
respiratory pathogens among BHCHP clients and staff (12/314) than in the other samples in our

dataset (8/1117) (p = 0.0002, Fisher’s exact test), consistent with an increased epidemiological
risk in this population.

Conclusions
We present here an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomic epidemiology primarily in the Boston
area, which was severely affected early in the US COVID-19 epidemic. Through dense
sampling of the early phase of the epidemic we show the frequency of importation events—over
80 independent introductions—and the impact of early superspreading events in driving
amplification and community transmission, likely accelerating the transition from containment to
mitigation strategies.

Besides better understanding of outbreak dynamics, viral sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
can also provide immediately actionable insights. In the current study, we were able to rule out
linked nosocomial spread in two episodes, reassuring hospital management that a failure of
infection control practice in these wards had not led to a nosocomial cluster, and showed that
despite multiple introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into a SNF, one introduction was responsible for
90% of cases. Real-time genomic epidemiology may be increasingly valuable as schools and
workplaces navigate the challenges of reopening, as it can help distinguish between local
outbreaks within institutions and introductions from outside.

The relatively narrow surveillance definition for SARS-CoV-2 in MA until March 4 may have
limited identification of other early introductions or delayed detection of some individuals who
did not meet testing criteria. Similarly, the dataset is not a random sample over time, comprised
instead largely of cases that fell in the MGH catchment area or that were sampled from
particular subpopulations to gain insight into local epidemiology.

Our findings repeatedly highlight the close relationships between seemingly disconnected
groups and populations: viruses from international business travel seeded major outbreaks
among individuals experiencing homelessness, spread throughout the Boston area, and were
exported to other domestic and international sites. It also illustrates the role of chance in the
trajectory of an epidemic: a single introduction had an outsize effect on subsequent
transmission because it was unfortunately amplified by superspreading in a highly mobile
population very early in the outbreak, before many precautions were put in place and when its
effects would be further amplified by exponential growth. By contrast, other early introductions
led to very little onward transmission, and another superspreading event in a SNF, while
devastating to the residents, had little large-scale effect because it occurred later and in a more
isolated population. This study provides direct evidence that superspreading events may
profoundly alter the course of an epidemic and implies that prevention, detection, and mitigation
of such events should be a priority for public health efforts.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample collections
This study was approved by the Partners Institutional Review Board under protocol
2019P003305 and MDPH IRB 00000701. ​We obtained samples and selected metadata from
the MGH Microbiology Laboratory and MADPH under a waiver of consent for viral genomic
sequencing. Samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. Samples that tested positive
were eligible to be included.

Archived samples obtained from the MGH Microbiology Laboratory included nasopharyngeal
(NP) swabs from five sources 1) all available cases prior to March 8, 2020, 2) all available
samples from a skilled nursing facility in the Boston area ​(​29)​ ​, 3) samples from April 1 through
April 14 from the MGH Respiratory Illness Clinic (RIC), established in Chelsea, MA, 4) samples
from MGH Infection Control Unit investigations, and 5) samples drawn from the general pool of
available samples tested by the MGH Microbiology Laboratory during the period from March 4
through May 9, 2020. Archived samples obtained from MADPH included NP swabs from 1) all
available samples representing the first two known travel-associated introductions and the
Berkshire County cluster and 2) all available samples submitted to MADPH from Boston
Healthcare for the Homeless Program (BHCHP) from Mar 19 through April 18, a period that
included universal screening ​(​16)​ ​.

Annotation of Cases
Epidemiological data on exposure and geography were obtained from medical record review
(MGH) or collected by the DPH laboratory in the process of clinical testing. Zip code and

county-level data were available for most samples from MGH. County-level data was available
from DPH samples. Individuals who participated in the conference or who had known direct
contact with attendees of the conference were deemed conference-associated (n = 28). One
additional patient reported staying at the conference hotel but was diagnosed with COVID-19
over 1 month later;their exposure was considered unlikely to be due to the conference.

Viral sequencing
Samples were received at the Broad Institute as viral transport medium, universal transport
medium, or molecular transport medium from NP swabs. In accordance with institutional
biosafety committee approvals, samples were inactivated with Buffer AVL (Qiagen) or other
chaotropic salt solution prior to extraction. RNA was extracted from 200uL of transport medium
using either the QiAmp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen), or the MagMAX mirVana Total RNA
Isolation kit on a KingFisher Flex automated extraction instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Residual DNA was removed from the extracted material using TURBO DNase (Thermo Fisher
Scientific).

Human ribosomal RNA was depleted using a ssDNA probe-based RNase H depletion method
as previously described ​(​39​, ​40​)​, or with the Ribo-Zero Plus rRNA Depletion Kit (Illumina).
Unique ERCC RNA spike-ins were added to each sample as a quality control measure to track
and mitigate potential cross contamination or downstream sample preparation issues. First and
second strand cDNA was synthesized using either SuperScript III or IV Reverse Transcriptase
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), and sequencing libraries were prepared with the Nextera XT or
TruSeq RNA Library Prep kits as previously described ​(​39,​ ​40)​ ​. Libraries were sequenced using
Illumina MiSeq, HiSeq, NextSeq, or NovaSeq machines with 100-nucleotide paired-end reads.

Genomic data analysis
We conducted all analyses using viral-ngs 2.0.21 on the Terra platform (​app.terra.bio​). All of the
workflows named below are publicly available via the Dockstore Tool Repository Service
(​dockstore.org/organizations/BroadInstitute/collections/pgs​). We demultiplexed individual
libraries using the ​demux_only​ workflow for each lane of each flowcell, removed reads mapping
to the human genome and to other known technical contaminants (e.g. sequencing adapters)
using ​deplete_only​ (with bwaDbs=[“gs://pathogen-public-dbs/v0/hg19.bwa_idx.tar.zst”] and
blastDbs=[“gs://pathogen-public-dbs/v0/GRCh37.68_ncRNA.fasta.zst",
“gs://pathogen-public-dbs/v0/hybsel_probe_adapters.fasta”]), and performed reference-based
assembly using ​assemble_refbased​ (once per sample, with all sequencing replicates merged in
the read_unmapped_bams input and with a reference_fasta taken from
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512.2?report=fasta​). We ran ​assemble_refbased
on 1970 read set inputs spanning 1535 distinct samples (inclusive of controls).

We used the following stringent criteria to excluded any sample where i) fewer than 50,000
cleaned reads were obtained; ii) the proportion of reads mapping to the internal control (IC)
sequence (ERCC spike-in) was >3 standard deviations from the mean observed for that IC

sequence across all sequencing batches; iii) replicate genomes—where available—had 2 or
more discordant SNPs or 1 or more discordant indels; iv) the number of normalized reads
mapping to the SARS-CoV-2 genome was less than that observed in the highest negative
control from the same sequencing batch. From the 1196 patient samples after filtering we
obtained 850 assemblies with unambiguous consensus calls over at least 80% of the
SARS-CoV-2 genome, and 778 with over unambiguous consensus calls over at least 98% of
the SARS-CoV-2 genome, of which 772 were from unique individuals. We submitted 633 read
sets to NCBI SRA and 837 genomes with at least 80% completeness to NCBI Genbank (using
the ​genbank​ workflow). We used the 772 high-quality assemblies from unique individuals for the
phylogenetic analyses described.

Failure to produce a SARS-CoV-2 genome from a PCR-positive sample may have been due to
low viral titer, RNA degradation due to lack of sufficient cold chain, or technical sample handling
issues (e.g. improper swab technique). Samples which failed to produce a genome at the first
attempt were not further investigated at this time. To confirm the quality of our assemblies and
mitigate any potential contamination we performed replicate library preparation and sequencing
from RNA for 10% of samples. Among those samples that assembled a complete genome in
both replicates, consensus-level genomes were identical.

Allele frequency was estimated as the proportion of derived / (derived + ancestral) versions of
the allele. A 95% confidence interval was estimated for the proportion using the binomial
distribution. The frequency of the iSNV for MA_MGH_00427 was calculated from 2 libraries; 50
reads contained the derived T allele and 146 reads contained the ancestral G allele based on
the aligned reads from the viral-ngs pipeline (as described above).

Phylogenetic tree reconstruction
We constructed phylogenetic maximum likelihood (ML) and time trees with associated
visualizations using the Augur pipeline (​augur_with_assemblies)​ . We used
SARS-CoV-2-specific procedures taken from ​github.com/nextstrain/ncov​, specifically setting the
clock rate to 0.0008 +/- 0.0004, rooting the tree using the reference genome, and using the
nextstrain site-masking and clade-definition files. In addition to our 772 genomes from unique
individuals from Massachusetts, we included a global comparison set of 4,011 genomes
subsampled from a download from the GISAID database on 15 June, 2020. These 4,011
genomes contain at most 50 representatives from each state or province in North America plus
at most 50 representatives from each country outside of North America. Random subsampling
was biased towards genomes genetically close to our focal set of genomes, using the distance
matrix calculator at ​github.com/nextstrain/ncov/blob/master/scripts/priorities.py​. The resulting
augur output is visualizable on ​auspice.us​ or can be incorporated in custom deployments using
Google Cloud Run using our template (​github.com/dpark01/auspice-private-template​); this
template is used to showcase our data at ​auspice.broadinstitute.org​.

We also conducted additional analysis of the genomes sequenced in this study. We aligned the
set of 772 genomes using MAFFT v7.471​(​41)​ ​ and trimmed 5’ and 3’ (first 265 and last 228
bases) UTRs from the alignment in R ​(4
​ 2​)​. To estimate the root-to-tip distance, we constructed
ML phylogenetic trees using PhyML​(​43)​ ​ v3.3.20190909 with default parameters using the
MAFFT alignment of 772 genomes. We used TempEst ​(​44)​ ​ v.1.5.3 and selected the best-fitting
root as identified using a heuristic residual mean squared function. To estimate branch support

in maximum-likelihood phylogenies, we used IQ-Tree ​(​45)​ ​ with the ultrafast bootstrap and
10,000 bootstrap samples.

To construct Bayesian time-trees, we used BEAST 2.6.2 with a general time reversible
substitution model with 4 rate categories drawn from a gamma distribution (GTR4G), a strict
clock, coalescent exponential tree prior, a uniform [-inf, inf] prior for the clock rate, a 1/x [-inf, inf]
prior for the coalescent effective population size; and a laplace [-inf, inf] prior for the growth rate.
We ran the MCMC chain in BEAST2 for 100 million steps and thinned the chain by recording
samples every 1000 steps. The first 30% of samples were discarded prior to calculating
summary statistics from the posterior. We used TreeAnnotator v2.6.2 to construct maximum
clade credibility trees with a burn-in percentage of 30%. We also compared a
Hasegawa-Yoshino-Gawa substitution model with kappa = 2 and with 4 rate categories drawn
from the gamma distribution (HKY4G) and ran this chain for 100 million steps using the same
thinning and burn-in described for the GTR4G model.

Detection of respiratory virus co-infection
We used Kraken2 ​(​46)​ ​ to identify other viral taxa present in NP swab samples from COVID
positive patients, excluding those removed by filters i and ii described above. To do so, we ran
the ​classify_single​ workflow on all reads from all samples (with
kraken2_db_tgz=”gs://pathogen-public-dbs/v1/kraken2-broad-20200505.tar.zst”,

constructed on 5 May, 2020, with the ​kraken2_build​ workflow (with
standard_libraries=[“archaea”, “bacteria”, “plasmid”, “viral”, “human”, “fungi”, “protozoa”,
“UniVec_Core”] and
custom_libraries=[“gs://pathogen-public-dbs/v1/Hybsel_Viruses-20170523.2.fa.zst”,
“gs://pathogen-public-dbs/v1/ercc_spike-ins-20170523.fa”]). The resulting per-sample outputs
were run through the ​merge_metagenomics​ workflow and the resulting hits were filtered down
to 20 common respiratory viruses of interest (adenovirus, HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1,
HCoV-NL63, betacoronavirus 1, parainfluenza 1, parainfluenza 2, parainfluenza 3,
Parainfluenza 4, enterovirus A, enterovirus B, enterovirus C, enterovirus D, influenza A,
influenza B, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV,
human rhinovirus) using a threshold of 10 reads to identify a putative co-infection. We
independently confirmed the presence of viral co-infections identified in the metagenomic
sequencing data using the BioFire FilmAssay Respiratory Panel, performed at the MADPH or
MGH Microbiology Laboratory. Three samples from early in the pandemic, for which no
additional sample remained, were not tested.

Identifying viral importation events
For ancestral state inference, we inferred a state of “MA” vs “non-MA” using the augur
pipeline​(​47)​ ​. Cases whose ancestral state was inferred as non-MA with high confidence (>0.95)
were considered imported cases. Conference-associated and nursing facility samples were
excluded from the importation analysis.

Haplotype Network Reconstruction
Haplotype networks were visualized using the software tool PopART v1.7 ​(​48​)​. The assembled
sequences were aligned against NC_045512.2 and the first 268bp at the 5' end and 230bp at
the 3' end (UTR regions) were removed from the alignment. A nexus-format input file for
PopART was created using a Python script to consolidate sequence information with metadata
classifications. This script is available at http://www.github.com/broadinstitute/[repository]. A
TCS network of the sequences ​(​49)​ ​ was constructed in PopART. Regions where any sequence
had ambiguous bases were masked. For the construction of haplotype networks in Figure 4,
one sample, MA_MGH_00090, was removed to prevent masking of the G3892T variant. For the
displayed haplotype networks, the area of the circle corresponds to how many
verbatim-identical sequences (after masking) bin together as the same haplotype. The hash
marks on the edges indicate the SNP distance between sequence haplotypes (1 mark=1 SNP
apart). Gene graphs were constructed using pairwise distance matrices computed on aligned
SARS-CoV-2 genomes and clustered using the R package adegenet ​(​50​)​.

SNF genetic diversity analysis
For this analysis, the main SNF cluster was restricted to samples collected before April 15,
2020, and the conference cluster to samples collected before March 8, 2020. We assumed that
the number of transmissions was the minimum possible (one fewer than the number of samples
in the cluster). The p-value for the comparison between the clusters assessed the probability
that the observed numbers of mutations were produced by Poisson processes with the same
value of λ, using the R function poisson.test (in the ​stats​ package v3.6.2). For the expected
number of mutations, we assumed that substitutions occur predominantly during the
transmission bottleneck and calculated the expected rate based on a generation time of 5.0

days ​(​51​)​ and a mutation rate of 1.0 x 10​-3​/bp/year (Fig. S5C), which together yield an
expectation of 0.41 substitutions/transmission.

Epidemiological and demographic data analysis
We downloaded publicly available daily and weekly data on cases of SARS-CoV-2 in MA for the
period January 1 - August 1 from the website of the MADPH
(​https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-response-reporting​). This data included cases by
day, cases by county over time, and cases involving congregate living facilities and staff. We
compiled detailed case statistics by exposure category using the press releases reporting early
case totals and exposure available on the MADPH website. During the study period, an
additional case from February 6, 2020, was added to MADPH tallies. This case was missing
detailed case information such as exposure category and was not included in early press
releases from MADPH; it was therefore excluded from the tallies of cases by exposure category
and estimates of the sampling proportion, but included in total case counts over time as
reported in the main text to incorporate the most recent tallies. To calculate the cumulative
proportion of alleles by county, conference-associated and SNF-associated individuals were
removed and the cumulative allele frequency through the end of the study period was calculated
for each of the four counties with the largest numbers of genomes (Suffolk, Middlesex, Essex,
and Norfolk). To calculate the proportion of domestic and global sequences from the GISAID
database, a multiple sequence alignment of 58,043 complete GISAID genomes was
downloaded on July 14 2020 and the percentage of ancestral and derived alleles was extracted
from the alignment and plotted by geographic category.
