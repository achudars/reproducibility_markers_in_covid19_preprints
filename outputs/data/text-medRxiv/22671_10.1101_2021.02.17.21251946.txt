Abstract
Objectives: To identify COVID-19 outbreaks and border control failures associated with
quarantine systems in Australia and New Zealand and to estimate the failure risks.
Design, setting, participants: Observational epidemiological study of travellers transiting
quarantine in Australia and New Zealand up to 31 March 2021.
Main outcome measures: The incidence of COVID-19 related failures arising from
quarantine, and the failure risk for those transiting quarantine, estimated both per 100,000
travellers and per 1000 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases.
Results: Australia and New Zealand had 24 COVID-19 related failures arising from
quarantine systems up to 31 March 2021 (14 and 10, respectively). One resultant outbreak
involved an estimated 800 deaths and quarantine failures instigated nine lockdowns. The
failure risk for those transiting quarantine was estimated at 6.3 failures per 100,000 travellers
and 5.8 failures (95%CI: 3.5 to 8.1) per 1000 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases. The latter risk was
three-fold higher in New Zealand compared with Australia. Approximately 55% of
quarantine system failures could likely have been prevented with the full vaccination of
frontline border workers, for 70% effectiveness at preventing transmission.
Conclusions: Quarantine system failures can be costly in terms of lives and economic
impacts such as lockdowns. Ongoing improvements or alternatives to hotel-based quarantine
are required.

Introduction
New Zealand and Australian states have successfully eliminated community transmission of
the pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2,1 albeit with occasional outbreaks from imported cases that
have typically been quickly brought under control. These two countries have primarily used
hotel-based quarantine for citizens returning to their countries during the pandemic period,
with 14 days of quarantine combined with PCR testing and mask use in any shared spaces
(eg, common exercise areas used in New Zealand, but not in most Australian states).
Converting hotels for quarantine purposes has the advantage of making use of a resource that
would otherwise be underused during a pandemic, given declines in international tourism.
However, the major disadvantage of hotel-based quarantine is that it is likely to be less
effective than purpose-built quarantine facilities owing to shared spaces and lack of safe
ventilation (as per WHO advice on air flow2). Moreover, the consequences of leakage of the
virus out of quarantine (eg, through facility workers) may be more severe given higher
population density in urban settings where the hotels are located. Given these issues, we
aimed to estimate the failure risk of quarantine systems in New Zealand and Australia in
terms of the spread of COVID-19 infection into the community.
As of 31 March 2021, the rolling 7-day average number of COVID-19 vaccine doses
administrated per 100 people was 0.18 in Australia and 0.08 in New Zealand3 However, this
was counted as single vaccine doses and does not equal the total number of people vaccinated
(eg, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine which is currently used in New Zealand requires two
doses).3 The majority of border workers in Australia and New Zealand have been vaccinated
(eg, over 56,000 doses had been administered to border workers as of 28 March,4 and all
hotel quarantine workers in Victoria who have face-to-face contact with returned travellers
received their first dose of the vaccine by the first week in April5).
Methods
We defined a quarantine system failure as where a border/health worker or person in the
community with a link to the quarantine/isolation system, became infected with SARS-CoV2. This definition included people infected in hospital from cases who had been transferred
from a quarantine facility (as such cases were still in the 14-day quarantine process). But this
definition did not include pandemic virus transmission between returnees within the
quarantine facilities (as some other commentators have included in lists of failures in the
Australian context6).
We searched official websites in both countries, and for the eight states and territories in
Australia, to identify outbreaks and border control failures associated with quarantine systems
(searches conducted between 6 January and 29 April 2021). Where an outbreak source was
uncertain (eg, the Auckland, New Zealand, August 2020 outbreak) we used the best available
evidence to classify it as a quarantine failure or not. We used two denominators: a) the
estimated number of travellers who went through quarantine facilities during the 2020 year
up to 31 March 2021; and b) the number of SARS-CoV-2 positive people who went through
these facilities in this same time period. The unit of analyses were New Zealand, the eight
Australian states and territories, and both countries combined.

For New Zealand, we used official data on both travellers going through the quarantine
system,7 along with official (Ministry of Health) data on SARS-CoV-2 positive cases,8
although there are some discrepancies in the information about when regular testing began in
Managed Isolation and Quarantine (MIQ) facilities. For Australia we used overseas arrival
data9 and health data.10 11
Results
The collated data for quarantine system failures is shown in Table 1, with specific details of
each event in the Appendix (Table A1). In Australia, 14 failures were identified, one causing
over 800 deaths (Victoria’s second wave) and eight out of the 14 resulting in lockdowns. In
New Zealand, there were ten failures, with one causing an outbreak with three deaths, and
also a lockdown.

Given our estimates of the number of travellers processed via quarantine systems (Table 1),
the overall risks for both countries combined were one failure per 15,972 travellers, and one
failure per 173 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in quarantine. The combined data can also be
interpreted as one outbreak leading to a lockdown response per 42,592 travellers; and
approximately one death from COVID-19 per 477 travellers (using the 800 deaths estimate
from Australia and the three deaths from New Zealand – although this figure is largely driven
by the second wave in Victoria and is unlikely generalizable forward in time).
At the country level, there were 13.2 failures per 1000 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases transiting
quarantine in New Zealand (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.0 to 21.4), compared to 4.1 per
1000 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases in Australia (95%CI: 2.0 to 6.3) – a three-fold difference in
risk (relative risk: 3.2, 95%CI: 1.4 to 7.2). Approximately 55.4% of quarantine system
failures could have been preventable with the full vaccination of frontline border workers
(Table A1) due to the combined effects of vaccination lowering the risk of getting infected by
70% or more (as in the case of the Moderna vaccine13), and the lesser duration of infectivity
and lower peak infectivity for those infected.14
Discussion
This analysis identified 24 failures of quarantine systems in Australia and New Zealand
combined (up to 31 March 2021). The significantly higher failure risk per 1000 SARS-CoV-2
positive cases transiting quarantine in New Zealand versus Australia could reflect a lower
quality approach in the former, with perhaps some of the difference due to greater detection
in New Zealand from more border worker testing over a longer period.
These estimates are subject to chance variations due to the low numbers of failures. These
estimates will also probably be an underestimate of all quarantine breaches, as not all of those
infected will transmit the virus and start a detectable chain of transmission. Genomes of the
first 649 viral isolates collected in New Zealand show that only 19% of virus introductions
resulted in ongoing transmission of more than one additional case.15 Therefore, counts of
border failures are sensitive to how they are identified and defined. Indeed, with increased
testing (eg, testing of people after leaving quarantine on day 16 as is now common in
Australia), we may be detecting breaches that previously would have been undetected.
Looking forward, the failure risks per month in New Zealand and Australia may increase,
given that the proportion of travellers returning to these countries who are infected is
increasing due to global intensification of the pandemic and the increasing infectivity of new
SARS-CoV-2 variants.16 Indeed, there have been several clearly documented cases of spread
within quarantine hotels (eg, two instances in Melbourne in February 2021, two instances in
Sydney in April 2021), highlighting the increased risk and evolving situation with more
highly infectious variants arriving from overseas.
However, offsetting this trend will be measures such as the vaccination of quarantine
workers. In New Zealand, the vaccination of border workers began in February 2021 with the
Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. However, vaccination does not fully protect against SARS-CoV-2
transmission, although a moderate degree of protection is likely. For example, infection rates
were halved for the AstraZeneca vaccine,17 18 and perhaps reduced by 70% for the Moderna
mRNA vaccine, as indicated by using swab results for asymptomatic infection plus
symptomatic cases.13 For vaccinated people who are infected, primate study evidence

suggests (consistent with expectation) that the infectivity is decreased in peak and duration,14
further protecting the border.
Furthermore, the level of testing of quarantine workers has been increasing (eg,19; which will
find some failures before they have a chance to establish as an outbreak in the community).
There have been other improvements in the quarantine systems over time (eg, improved
security, introduction of mask wearing within quarantine settings, reduction in shared spaces,
improved PPE used by workers, and other procedures as detailed in both countries20 21).
Another risk reduction practice would be using better or purpose-built facilities in rural
locations as these have less risk from close contacts in central business district hotels and
within-building spread from poor ventilation systems. Limitations of our analysis include
residual uncertainty around the cause of some outbreaks (eg, the Auckland August 2020), and
imprecision with denominator data on traveller numbers for Australia (eg, some travellers
were moved between states on domestic flights which is not captured in the official data we
used). Additionally, case numbers are constantly changing, due to the number of
reclassifications caused by false positives and duplications.
To substantially reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 incursion out of quarantine (until such time
as enough of the population is vaccinated), the most obvious action is to reduce arrivals, or
even suspend arrivals, from high infection locations (as New Zealand temporarily did for
travel from India and other high risk countries in April 202122). Beyond this, there are a range
of other potential improvements in ongoing arrangements and processes as detailed in Table
2. Furthermore, the start of quarantine-free travel between Australia and New Zealand (also
known as a "green zone") in April 2021 provides an opportunity to benchmark COVID-19
border control policies and practices, identify potential improvements in both countries, and
harmonise best practices across the region. The green zone further intertwines the biosecurity
status of both nations and it is therefore even more important to lower the risk of border
failures that could disrupt such travel. This shift from a one-size-fits-all strategy to a riskbased approach to border management can be summarised as a 'traffic light' approach.23

Description
Reduce the in-flow of travellers by reducing or suspending flights
to Australia and New Zealand (NZ) from very high incidence
countries where the pandemic is out of control. These governments
have the legal powers to put conditions on the existing rights of
their citizens to enter their country of citizenship (ie, on public
health grounds).
Expand existing requirements for pre-departure testing to additional
traveller source countries. Pre-departure testing could be expanded
from not only a PCR test within 72 hours of departure to also add a
rapid test at the airport immediately before departure (given many
infected may have started shedding the virus in the previous 72
hours and most, but not all, of such cases will be detected by a rapid
test even though it has lower sensitivity). Of note is that such
arrangements are considered legally acceptable (see the above row).

assurance, but this would probably need to be in a transport hub (eg,
at an airport hotel at Singapore or Hawaii) where NZ and Australian
officials were permitted access to ensure quality processes. Even if
establishing a formal facility is shown to be impractical, all
incoming travellers could be asked to self-quarantine as strictly as
possible in the week before travel, eg, by a request through the
passenger booking system (see Policy Option 4).
Make travel contingent on completing a course of approved
vaccination. This measure assumes the vaccine is at least partially
effective at preventing transmission. This requirement needs further
investigation and development.
Require passengers to declare pre-departure COVID-19 precautions
via the system that they use to book spaces in quarantine facilities
prior to travel. Such a system is operating in NZ and could be
adopted more widely in Australia.
Explore means to reduce the risk of in-flight infection as
documented on a flight to NZ.24 This could be via more stringent
enforcement of mask wearing in airports and on flights, use of
higher-efficacy masks (and/or double masking), and minimizing
talking when masks are displaced during eating and drinking on
flights. Improved ventilation and spacing requirements on flights
might also be worthwhile.
Ensure measures are in place at departure airports and transit hubs
to minimize the risk of cross infection (eg, through physical
distancing and mask use).

arrangements

Ensure sufficient physical distancing of travellers on arrival and in
transit to quarantine (eg, lowering density on buses). For such
arrangements, N95 masks could be required.

quarantine units

Shift some or all quarantine facilities to rural military bases or
camps where discrete units (eg, mobile homes or caravans) could be
appropriately spatially separated. The success (to date – see Table
A1 in the Appendix) of the Howard Springs facility (a converted
workers’ camp12) should be considered. This approach allows for
natural ventilation and eliminates shared indoor spaces. If spaces
were limited, then these settings could be used for travellers from
the highest risk countries.
Reserve hotel quarantine in large cities to the lowest risk category
of travellers, with hotels in more minor cities being used for the
highest risk category of travellers. However, the risk/benefit
analysis of such changes would need to consider airport access and
if the additional travelling to minor cities poses excessive additional
risk.
Expand the regular (daily) use of PCR testing of saliva of facility
workers to all facilities in both countries. This approach could also
be considered for all travellers, albeit potentially still combined
with existing testing regimens. In view of increased transmissibility
of new variants, consideration should be given to testing of all
workers in border-associated occupations (eg, providing airline
meals and laundry services) at least twice per week. Documented
negative tests at appropriate frequency should be an occupational
requirement for all border workers instead of the self-report systems

Vaccinate all quarantine workers against COVID-19 and redeploy

when vaccines are known to prevent transmission in addition to
protecting recipients from illness.

12. Cohorting
complete flights of
travellers

Cohorting of flights means that all returnees arriving into a country
go to the same quarantine facility until that facility is full and then
the intake switches to another facility and so on. This approach is
designed to reduce cross-infection in such facilities. This system
was introduced in NZ on 16 May 2021.
Upgrade processes at quarantine facilities in terms of eliminating
shared spaces (eg, no shared exercise areas and shared smoking
areas), in particular ensuring that day cohorts do not mix under any
circumstances. Ventilation improvements could also be considered
with limiting the use of rooms to those with external windows.
Enforce quarantine facility rules more rigorously. Rule breaking,
which is relatively common in NZ facilities,25 could start to be
prosecuted (given no prosecutions during 2020).
Improve working conditions for the staff in quarantine facilities to
minimize the risk of overwork (which may increase the risk of PPE
failures) or of workers taking on other part-time jobs in other
settings. For example, in February 2021 there were still concerns by
NZ health workers about staffing inadequacies in these facilities.
Introduce specific measures for travellers who are nicotine
dependent to reduce their need to smoke in designated areas during
their travel and while in managed quarantine (eg, nicotine
replacement treatment as a requirement for travel).
Introduce a post-quarantine period of home-quarantine to reduce the
risk of local transmission arising from undetected infections in
people leaving hotel quarantine facilities (which may arise from
either exceptionally long incubation periods or cross infection
during quarantine stays). Post-quarantine testing could also be used
to detect such infections.
Mandate quarantine workers to use digital technologies (eg, the
Bluetooth function on the NZ COVID Tracer smartphone app) to
facilitate contact tracing in the event of a border failure. Travellers
could be required to use such technologies for two weeks after
completing their time in quarantine. There is also a case for
travellers using these tools within quarantine as (at least in NZ)
quarantine facilities are sometimes evacuated for fire alarms and
burst water pipes.

Specifically, around 90% of cases can be traced
back to a single family of four that returned to
Australia in mid-May and were quarantined at the

Rydges Hotel. The virus then spread from the
infected workers to the community, with high rates of
local transmission.29 The outbreak led to a stringent
lockdown for 112 days in the state, with particularly
strict measures in the major city of Melbourne.31 At
least nine people employed in Melbourne's hotel
quarantine program tested positive between late July
and early October 2020, although the cases may
have been a reflection of substantial community
transmission in Melbourne at the time rather than
additional hotel quarantine failures.32 Two of those
cases worked while infectious.32

A hotel quarantine worker in Brisbane tested positive

lockdown in the greater Brisbane area, while contact
tracers worked to ensure there was no community
transmission of the strain.41 It was later revealed that
there were six genomically linked cases within the
quarantine facility, including the hotel quarantine

believed he was exposed to the virus on the 26
January when he worked at Four Points by
Sheraton, on the same floor where a quarantined
returned traveller with a confirmed case of the UK
variant was staying. After feeling sick on 28 January,
the case visited a GP, and tested positive on 30
January. The exact cause is unknown, but it’s
43
believed poor ventilation could be a factor. This
comes a week after Western Australia committed to
daily testing of the hotel quarantine staff, instead of
weekly.44 Quarantine hotel staff, including cleaners,

The cause of this outbreak remains unknown, but
genomic work probably provides the best evidence
to this being a border facility (isolation or quarantine
facility) failure: “There are a large number of similar
genomes which are from the UK, which would seem
to suggest the UK is the most likely source of any
52
unknown importation”. This was at a time when
40% of cases in NZ quarantine/isolation facilities did
not have genomic work on the virus infecting them
(ie, there was not enough complete virus in the
samples). It was also estimated52 that there was only
a very tiny risk of this outbreak being a continuation
of the March/April spread of the pandemic in NZ:
“Our Bayesian phylogenetic analysis … estimates
that there is a 0.4% probability that case 20VR2563
is in the “sister clade”' of the Auckland cluster.”
Finally, the chance of the outbreak being from
contaminated imported food was also considered
very unlikely: “Our Bayesian phylogenetic analysis
… shows that the estimated mutation rate on the
branch leading to the cluster is not a lot smaller than
elsewhere in the tree, lending little weight to the
possibility that the virus lay dormant on packing
material for a long period of time.”

sequencing linked to infection in a group of
international mariners in the same hotel facility but
53
with different virus subtypes in each case. “The
finding supports the current theory that there were
two separate events infecting both workers at the
facility.” These cases of infected health workers
appear to have contributed to border control nurses
threatening strike action if they were not supplied
27
with improved PPE. One estimate was that 12 of
the mariners were infected on arrival in NZ, but with
subsequent spread within the facility a total of 31
mariners were ultimately infected.58

worker had recently been vaccinated (with the
Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine) on 23 February, with a
second dose on 16 March,66 although they tested
positive before full protection from the vaccine could
be expected. Their family had not yet been
vaccinated.66 Genome sequencing revealed that
Case A was infected with the highly transmissible
variant first identified in the UK (B.1.1.7) and was
linked to a traveller in the facility who had arrived on
13 March.68 In early April, two unvaccinated security

Approaches to managing quarantine in Australia and New Zealand
Table A2 details the various approaches to quarantine used in both countries. Key features of
which are summarised below:
• The length of quarantine in all jurisdictions is 14 days.
• Almost all jurisdictions require at least two separate PCR tests for travellers: one
shortly after arrival and another closer to the end of the quarantine period.
• Many jurisdictions have introduced or are considering additional tests for travellers,
either earlier in (eg, Day 0/1 in New Zealand) or after (eg, Day 16 in New South
Wales) the quarantine period. This is in response to concerns about new highly
infectious variants in early 2021.
• Australia does not currently have a national strategy for quarantine.
• Detailed information on quarantine programs for each Australian state/territory is
limited and in many cases we had to rely on news articles for additional details in
compiling Table A2. Descriptions of PPE required for quarantine staff in different
jurisdictions were particularly difficult to identify and information often was not
available by staff role (eg, security guards vs cleaners).

the infection control processes in

Some facilities run daily bus trips to
take travellers to outdoor exercise
areas, a practice which has raised
concerns from epidemiologists.
