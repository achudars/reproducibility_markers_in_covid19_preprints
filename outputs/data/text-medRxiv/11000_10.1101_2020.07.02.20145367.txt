ABSTRACT
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has elicited an abrupt pause in the
United States in multiple sectors of commerce and social activity. As the US faces this health
crisis, the magnitude, and rigor of their initial public health response was unprecedented. As a
response, the entire nation shutdown at the state-level for the duration of approximately one to
three months. These public health interventions, however, were not arbitrarily decided, but rather,
implemented as a result of evidence-based practices. These practices were a result of lessons
learned during the 1918 influenza pandemic and the city-level non-pharmaceutical interventions
(NPIs) taken across the US. During the 1918 pandemic, two model cities, St. Louis, MO, and
Philadelphia, PA, carried out two different approaches to address the spreading disease, which
resulted in two distinctly different outcomes. Our group has evaluated the state-level public health
response adopted by states across the US, with a focus on New York, California, Florida, and
Texas, and compared the effectiveness of reducing the spread of COVID-19. Our assessments
show that while the states mentioned above benefited from the implementations of early
preventative measures, they inadequately replicated the desired outcomes observed in St. Louis
during the 1918 crisis. Our study indicates that there are other factors, including health disparities
that may influence the effectiveness of public health interventions applied. Identifying more
specific health determinants may help implement targeted interventions aimed at preventing the
spread of COVID-19 and improving health equity.

INTRODUCTION
As the first wave of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic began to sweep
through the United States (US) in March 2020, multiple public health measures were enforced
across the nation in an unprecedented manner. However, by the end of June 2020, the US remained
one of the largest COVID-19 epicenters, globally, with more than 2.5 million confirmed cases and
the number of new daily cases reaching highs in certain states and the US (CDC, 2020b). Now,
faced with the renewed threat of experiencing prolonged second wave, many states are
reintroducing partial shutdown measures, which are examples of non-pharmaceutical interventions
(NPIs). During the first wave of this pandemic, the US strictly implemented multiple NPIs to help
mitigate the spread of the disease, and reduce the number of COVID-19-related deaths. Herein we
discuss the successes and failures of the implemented evidence-based public health practices amid
a nationwide public health crisis that abruptly brought the nation and its economy to a screeching
halt.
As of February 2020, while China, Italy, and Spain experienced the turmoil of being the
epicenters for the COVID-19 pandemic, the US had only about 50 confirmed cases, and the
national populace was nearly unaffected. No one could have anticipated how life was about to
change in the ensuing months. In March 2020, different states started to sound the alarms, and
place their respective constituencies under states of emergency. After that, increasingly rigorous
preventative measures that affected the function and dynamics of societal interaction were
implemented. These interventions, aimed at facilitating social distancing and preventing the spread
of COVID-19, can be categorized into four broad measures (Galbadage et al., 2020b; WilderSmith and Freedman, 2020). These are (1) screening and testing, (2) prevention of mass gatherings,
(3) stay at home orders, and (4) the use of face masks. In the US, 44 states of the 50 states

implemented statewide stay at home orders at the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic,
paralleling other measures listed above (Figure 1, Supplemental Table 1). The mean duration of
stay at home orders for all US states was 49.5 days (SD Â± 16.5) (median 50 days, range 25 to 81
days).
While seemingly sudden and societally intrusive, historical precedent and evidence-based
practices have guided these measures. For example, a century ago, the world experienced a
devastating toll on lives caused by the 1918 influenza pandemic. In response to this pandemic,
health officials implemented a broad range of NPIs according to the then available understanding
of disease transmission (Mills et al., 2004; Ferguson et al., 2005; Markel et al., 2006). Furthermore,
studies comparing public health measures implemented by several cities across the United States
and other nations such as England further illustrated how these measures helped reduce the spread
of the 1918 influenza pandemic and decrease mortality rates (Ferguson et al., 2006; Bootsma and
Ferguson, 2007; Handel et al., 2007; Hatchett et al., 2007).
Studies on the 1918 influenza pandemic have focused on contrasting NPIs implemented by
two US cities, St. Louis, MO, and Philadelphia, PA. St. Louis imposed strict preventative
interventions early on, while Philadelphia minimally applied restrictions at a much later date.
Accordingly, St. Louis had a milder outbreak, whereas Philadelphia experienced significantly
higher mortality rates (Hatchett et al., 2007). These outcomes observed in the 1918 influenza
pandemic helped guide the widely-adopted rigorous public health measures against COVID-19.
Hatchett et al. (2007) also identified four critical factors that helped determine the success of the
control of the pandemic dissemination. These factors were (1) implementation of early and rapid
interventions, (2) duration of the responses, (3) multiple concurrent interventions, and (4) the
intensity of the interventions implemented.

Other studies supported these conclusions while emphasizing the effectiveness of early
interventions, but also noted that stringent preventative measures could leave many more
susceptible individuals once these NPIs are relaxed (Kalnins, 2006; Bootsma and Ferguson, 2007).
During the 1918 pandemic, most of the US cities maintained preventative measures for about two
to eight weeks (Hatchett et al., 2007). However, cities that relaxed NPIs earlier experienced
increased case numbers resulting in second wave resurgences. An inverse relationship between the
intensity of the first and second waves of the pandemic was also observed. These observations
were partly due to the smaller proportion of susceptible populations present in cities after a strong
first wave of the disease (Bootsma and Ferguson, 2007; Hatchett et al., 2007).
Here we compare and contrast public health interventions implemented in the US during
the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on four states: New York, Florida, Texas, and
California. These states included most of the populous US counties and were affected sharply by
the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we studied the case rates of COVID-19
before, during, and after these measures were implemented, and then compared it to the outcomes
of St. Louis, and Philadelphia, during the 1918 influenza pandemic (Figure 2). While variation in
the timing and the intensity of the public health measures applied was observed, all four states
implemented very similar interventions. Our comparisons show that the early evidence-based
interventions implemented by the US were not adequately able to replicate the desired outcomes
of St. Louis vs. Philadelphia and curtail the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS
Evaluating the State and County Level Public Health Response
We documented public health responses and actions taken between January 1st and June
30th at the state- and county-level were found using the state and county public health department
and government websites. More specifically, we examined press releases and executive orders
issued by the state, and the counties were used to determine the public health response. This
information collected was organized in an Excel worksheet by date and type of response. We used
four broad categories to distinguish between the types of responses. They were (1) screening and
testing, (2) prevention of mass gatherings, (3) stay at home orders, and (4) the use of face masks.
To have only the most relevant and quantifiable data, we distilled public health responses to critical
interventions. Besides, the first positive cases of COVID-19 in each county were also noted. Office
Timeline Online was used to create timelines to illustrate this information visually.
Determining the Case Rates and Mortality Rates
COVID-19 Cases and deaths are presented as seven-day averages from data provided by
Johns Hopkins University and the City of New York (Dong et al., 2020). Case rates were calculated
as new confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population in the respective counties. Death rates
were calculated as new COVID-19 related deaths per 1,000,000 people in the individual counties.
We calculated the case rates and mortality rates in the six most populous counties in the states of
New York (Kings, Queens, New York, Suffolk, Bronx, and Nassau), California (Los Angeles, San
Diego, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Santa Clara), Florida (Miami-Dade, Broward,
Palm Beach, Hillsborough, Orange, and Pinellas, and Texas (Harris, Dallas, Tarrant, Bexar, Travis,
and Collin). We then overlapped the duration statewide stay-at-home orders that were
implemented by each state (Grey boxes) to evaluate the ensuing case and mortality rates.

Public Health Response to COVID-19
As mentioned earlier, responses to earlier pandemics in the US included school closures,
restaurant restrictions, emergency declarations, gathering restrictions, stay at home orders, and
non-essential business closures (Gupta et al., 2020). The COVID-19-related responses have been
mainly relegated to state-level decision making and based on necessity and intensity within each
state. To characterize the state-level COVID-19 interventions, we compared and contrasted the
broad measured implemented by the states of California, Florida, New York, and Texas.
Screening and Testing
Targeted screening for COVID-19 began in California and New York with Los Angeles
(LAX), San Francisco (SFO), and New York (JFK) airports for travelers coming from Wuhan,
China, starting on January 17th (CDC, 2020e). The first reported case in the US occurred on
January 26th in California. New York, Florida, and Texas all had initial cases within the first week
of March (Figure 1c). Early in the pandemic, testing was limited, and priority was given to highrisk individuals, including symptomatic patients, healthcare workers, first responders, essential
workers, and individuals in contact with other high-risk individuals. As more tests were readily
available, fewer restrictions were placed on who was able to get tested (Florida Department of
Health, 2020; State of California, 2020b; State of New York, 2020a; Texas Department of State
Health Services, 2020). In addition to walk-up and drive-through sites, mobile testing sites were
also deployed in Florida and New York to increase the number of tests administered (City of New
York, 2020; Florida Division of Emergency Management, 2020). Each state also implemented
contact tracing to identify potentially exposed individuals (CDC, 2020c).
Mass Gatherings
The next primary public health intervention implemented across all four states was the
cancellation of mass gatherings of 250 individuals, followed by 50 individuals per location

(Supplemental Tables 2-5). These orders followed shortly after initial cases were identified in each
state. Events that brought in large amounts of attendance, such as concerts, sporting events, and
festivals were canceled first. Next, the states incrementally decreased the number of people
allowed to gather in one location until, eventually, the state recommended that people should only
interact with those who were within the same household.
Stay at Home Orders
One of the most rigorous measures utilized during COVID-19 was the stay at home orders.
California was under stay at home order for 50 days (March 19th to May 7th) (State of California,
2020a). The stay at home order in California was implemented more rigorously at the county level
because the state-level order acted more as a recommendation (Supplemental Table 3). The NY
âState on PAUSEâ plan stay at home order was enforced for 68 days (March 22nd to May 28th)
before the state started its Phase one reopening plan (Cuomo, 2020; State of New York, 2020b; c).
Florida state stay at home order was in effect for 27 days (April 3rd to April 29th) (State of Florida,
2020). Texas implemented stay at home orders for 29 days before relaxing these measures
statewide (April 2nd to April 30th) (Abbott, 2020).
Many US states enacted stay at home orders very early on in the COVID-19 transmission.
States with early COVID-19 cases placed these measures before April 29th (cluster 1) and did so
with a statewide case count of fewer than 2000 cases, while states that put stay at home orders
after April 29th did so before reaching 5000 cases (cluster 2) (Figure 1a, Supplemental Table 1).
When adjusted to the county population, these measures were implemented with case rates of
below 50 cases per 10,000 (Figure 1b). The only exception was New York, which implemented
these measures after 11,700 cases were confirmed. (Figure 1a).

Cloth Face Masks
On April 3rd, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released its
recommendation for all individuals to use cloth face masks when in public (CDC, 2020a). The
goal of this recommendation was to reduce the viral transmission from asymptomatic carriers that
may unknowingly spread to disease to susceptible individuals (Esposito et al., 2020; Galbadage et
al., 2020b). While the extent to which the effectiveness of this measure is debatable, it helps bring
more awareness to the public and help curtail the person-to-person transmission of the virus
(Eikenberry et al., 2020). California was the first to implement this statewide on April 1st, which
was two days before the CDCâs recommendation (Figure 1c). New York also implemented this
measure as a state-level order, but it happened two weeks after the CDCâs recommendation.
Florida and Texas only recommended face coverings at the state-level but was mandated in most
counties (supplemental Tables 4 and 5).
Differences in Statewide Responses to COVID-19
The public health interventions implemented across the four states, New York, California,
Florida, and Texas, were very similar. Any differences stem from the relative time of
implementation and the intensity of measures taken. Unfortunately, New York was one of the first
states severely affected by COVID-19 and was likely too late to implement these preventative
measures (Figure 1a and b, Figure 2 and b). The initial wave of COVID-19 in New York, therefore,
resembled that of Philadelphia during the 1918 pandemic. California, on the other hand, initiated
precautionary measures early and seemed to follow the outcomes of St. Louis, at least in the initial
stages (Figure 2, c, and d). Regulations in both of these states were more stringent, and often had
consequences such as fines and jail time tied to not adhering to them.

In Texas and Florida, the implementation of specific public health interventions was less
rigorous as compared to California and New York. In Texas, for example, the regulations were not
implemented as quickly or as firmly at the state-level. Some public health interventions, such as
the ban on gathering, stay at home orders and wearing cloth face masks, may have been perceived
as violations of individual liberties and disrupting businesses. In many ways, the small-government
philosophy of these states left essential decisions and actions to be made at the county-level.
Around the time many states went into shut down mode, spring break activities remained open in
Florida. The decision to not shut down before spring break was made in support of the stateâs
economy. It was only after large tourist attractions, including Universal Studios and Disney World,
decided to close were more rigorous measures put in place in Florida.
The Spread of COVID-19 Across States and Counties
During the first months of COVID-19, the disease spread rapidly across the United States.
In New York, the number of positive cases grew exponentially over the first month of the
pandemic, especially in the New York City area and surrounding boroughs. However, unlike other
states, the number of daily cases in New York has decreased consistently since the end of April.
In California, Florida, and Texas, the number of daily cases has continued to increase over time at
a slower rate compared to New York. To better understand the dynamics of COVID-19 spread in
each of these states, we reviewed the number of cases and deaths in the six most populous counties
in each of these states (Figure 2).
In New York, the most populous counties all experienced a similar first wave of COVID19, with a peak of about 100 cases per 10,000 people in early April (Figure a). Most counties in
the state of California continued to have a relatively slow, but steady rise in the number of cases,
making it difficult to distinguish between a first and a second wave (Figure 2c). We observed a

similar pattern in the counties in Florida and Texas, except Miami-Dade County in Florida, which
showed a peak case rate of about 15 cases per 10,000 people in early April (Figure 2c, e, g). Among
these states, it is clear that New York experienced a robust first wave and a negligible second wave
of the COVID-19 pandemic. While California, Florida, and Texas were spared from a significant
first wave with cases rate peaking at less than 20 cases per 10,000, they are now facing a much
higher risk for a prolonged second wave of the disease.
US COVID-19 Interventions Failed to Replicate 1918 Pandemic Outcomes
In the COVID-19 pandemic, the goal of effective public health preventative measures
implemented was to mitigate and contain the spread of the disease. In the US, for the most part,
public health interventions followed the principles of effective NPIs. They were implemented early
on in the pandemic, using multiple preventative measures, with high intensity and for average
durations longer than 45 days (Figure 1, Supplement Table 1). The exception to this was New
York, which delayed the initiation of these measures (Figure 1a and b). This caused New York to
experience a peak first wave, with hospitals reaching their capacity and a peak number of deaths
occurring during mid-April (Figure 1b). However, New York enforced its preventative measures
for close to three months, which in turn helped them bring their daily case rates to less than 5 cases
per 10,000 by the end of June.
In contrast to New York, most other states followed the evidence-based recommendations,
as stated above (Figure 1). This helped states âflatten the curveâ to various degrees and control the
initial spread of COVID-19 within their states. However, these public health interventions seemed
to have only prolonged the transmission potential of the COVID-19 as states, including California,
Florida, and Texas were experiencing new daily highs in confirmed cases by the end of June 2020
(CDC, 2020b). While the general expectation was that US states would follow the outcome of St.

Louis during the 1918 pandemic, they have fallen short of replicating this desired outcome. On the
contrary, by the end of June 2020, many such states were reimplementing statewide partial
shutdown measures to prevent a potential second wave of COVID-19.

DISCUSSION
While the United States failed to prevent the early spread of COVID-19 effectively, some
countries had better success containing the Coronavirus with their public health interventions. In
Iceland, for example, when cases were identified, public health officials implemented the
following strategies: quarantine requirements for international travelers, rigorous tracing of
infection, ban on gatherings larger than 20 persons, school closures with limited openings of
elementary and preschools, defining areas of higher risk, and regular communication with the
general public (Iceland Directorate of Health, 2020). New Zealand, another island nation with
great success, was more rigorous in the process by modifying and intensifying pre-existing plans
for the management of influenza pandemics from previous outbreaks (Baker et al., 2020). These
methods included the declaration of a national emergency, a nationwide lockdown, closure of nonessential work locations, banning social gatherings, extreme restrictions on travel, and closure of
all schools. Furthermore, as part of this intensified strategy, border security was also tightly
regulated. However, there are distinct differences between Iceland, New Zealand, and the United
States. Iceland and New Zealand are small island nations with much smaller populations, making
it much easier to implement rigorous preventative measures, including better travel restrictions
and contact tracing. They were also able to coordinate their public health response more
consistently nationwide, unlike the US, which enforced COVID-19 interventions mainly at the
state level.

Several factors can help explain why the US was unable to effectively replicate the
outcomes of St. Louis vs. Philadelphia during the 1918 flu pandemic. These include (1) the level
of adherence to these implemented preventative measures and social behaviors, (2) disparities in
social determinants of health, and (3) extensive global and domestic travel with little restrictions.
Regardless of the public health intervention intensity, they can be ineffective if people do not
consistently adhere to them. Besides, numerous risk factors have been identified for COVID-19
and its clinical outcomes. These include advanced age, sex, immune-compromised status, and
comorbidities, including chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, and hypertension (Galbadage et
al., 2020a; Li et al., 2020; Richardson et al., 2020). American Indians, African Americans, and
Hispanic individuals have been reported to be four to five times more likely to be hospitalized for
COVID-19 when compared to non-Hispanic whites (CDC, 2020d). Disparities in social
determinants of health, such as access to healthcare, uninsured population, employment, poverty,
education, and population density, can also contribute to the differences observed in COVID-19
transmission. Potential clusters of these risk factors and health determinates present in different
geographic regions can lead to the disproportionate spread of the Coronavirus. In conclusion, it is
crucial to consider factors such as adherence to preventative measures, and health disparities, in
evaluating the effectiveness of COVID-19 interventions implemented. These factors likely caused
the US early COVID-19 public health measures to be less effective in containing the Coronavirus
pandemic and is an important further direction of research.

(FL) and Texas (TX). These interventions included screening and testing, a ban on mass
gatherings, stay at home orders, requirements for face masks in public locations, and other statespecific measures. In NY contained a one-mile containment effort around hotspot New Rochelle
in Westchester County. In FL airport and roadway, screening was implemented for travelers
coming to FL from the tri-state region as well as other regions with a high prevalence of
COVID-19. In TX Airport and roadway, screening was implemented mainly for travelers coming
into TX from the tri-state area and Louisiana, where the prevalence of COVID-19 was high. TX
did not enforce mandatory use of cloth facemasks at the state level. Travis (4/13), Harris (4/13),
Bexar (4/16), Dallas County (4/18) ordered mandatory facemasks.
