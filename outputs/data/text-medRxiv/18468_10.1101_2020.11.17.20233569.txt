Abstract
Multiplex electronic antigen sensors for detection of SARS-Cov-2 spike glycoproteins or hemagglutinin
from Influenza A in liquid samples with characteristics resembling extracted saliva were fabricated using
scalable processes with potential for economical mass-production. The sensors utilize the sensitivity and
surface chemistry of a two-dimensional MoS2 transducer for attachment of antibody fragments in a
conformation favorable for antigen binding. Ultra-thin layers (3 nm) of amorphous MoS2 were directly
sputtered over the entire sensor chip at room temperature and laser annealed to create an array of
semiconducting 2H-MoS2 active sensor regions between metal contacts. The semiconducting region was
functionalized with monoclonal antibody Fab (fragment antigen binding) fragments derived from whole
antibodies complementary to either SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein or Influenza A hemagglutinin using a
papain digestion to cleave the antibodies at the disulfide hinges. The high affinity for the MoS2 transducer
surface with some density of sulfur vacancies for the antibody fragment base promoted chemisorption
with antigen binding regions oriented for interaction with the sample. The angiostatin converting enzyme
2 (ACE2) receptor protein for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, was tethered to a hexa-histidine (his6)
tag at its c-terminus both for purification purposes, as well as a motif for binding to MoS2. This modified
protein was also investigated as a bio-recognition element. Electrical resistance measurements of
sensors functionalized with antibody fragments and exposed to antigen concentrations ranging from 220,000 picograms per milliliter revealed selective responses in the presence of complementary antigens
with sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 or influenza A on the order of pg/mL and comparable to gold-standard
diagnostics such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis. Lack of antigen sensitivity for the larger
ACE2 BRE further demonstrates the utility of the engineered antibody fragment/transducer interface in
bringing the target antigen closer to the transducer surface for sensitivity required for early detection viral
diagnostics.
Inexpensive, daily-use tests for early and rapid detection of pathogens contained within easily accessible
secretions such as saliva will be critical for the safe return of individuals to work, school, and
recreational/cultural activities in the midst of a pandemic. The most reliable approaches for viral analysis
such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) provide

detection of low antigen concentrations (<10-12 g/mL), but currently require extensive sample handling,
costly laboratory infrastructure, and test-to-result times ranging between hours to days due to the backlog
of samples. Advances are leading to broader point-of-care capability involving these testing methods, but
even this effort is insufficient for curbing the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic and potential
future global health emergencies. A survey of sensor modalities for virus diagnostics points to electronic
sensors, specifically those exhibiting responses in electrical conductivity upon viral adsorption, as the
most likely path toward realization of this objective of frequent, home-based testing due to their
superlative sensitivity (i.e., single virus detection)1, ease of use, instantaneous results, and potentially low
cost2-6. While electronic biosensor devices were first developed five decades ago7, only recent
developments in nanomaterials have given rise to electronic sensors with sensitivity comparable that of
conventional institutional diagnostics such as PCR and ELISA1, 8-14.
While sensitivity is well-documented for nanomaterial-based electronic sensors, selectivity remains a
challenge. Reports of antibody and antibody Fab (Fragment antigen binding) fragment functionalization of
electronic sensor transducers indicate their utility in terms of providing specific binding sites for analytes in
solution. An early demonstration of real-time detection of single Influenza A antigen proteins was
achieved through single crystal silicon nanowire transistors yielding immediate, binding-induced
conductance changes1. These sensors were functionalized for specific detection with monoclonal
antibodies immobilized by linkers to the nanowires’ native surface oxide. Erlanger et al. found that IgG
antibodies adhering to fullerenes also had the flexibility to adhere to the hydrophobic, electron-rich
surface of single walled carbon nanotubes despite their sharp radius of curvature15. These onedimensional materials performed well as biosensors, but were difficult to integrate into devices. The
understanding developed for nanotube functionalization was applicable in some cases to two-dimensional
graphene. This atomically thick material was easier to integrate into devices and demonstrated low levels
of thermal and measurement noise16, although the small band gap resulted in responses of lower
magnitude for adsorption events. Recently, antibody functionalized graphene was integrated into
electronic field effect transistor-based sensors demonstrating fg/mL sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 and
excellent selectivity, however many complex and energy-intensive steps were necessary for device
fabrication17, thereby reducing the utility of such a device for inexpensive mass production. Twodimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a recent addition to the family of lowdimensional materials possessing advantages of optical transparency and mechanical flexibility shared
with graphene, but with a much larger room temperature bandgap (for monolayer MoS 2 about 1.8 eV18
compared to ~ 0.1 eV 19 for graphene.). The large bandgap of 2D MoS2 yields a lower value of
subthreshold swing for FET devices20, where changes in charge carrier density are more sensitive to
single binding events. Sarkar et al. show how the difference in band gap results in a nearly 102 fold
increase in sensitivity for MoS2 over graphene20.
The composition and structure of 2D TMDs enable interactions with both metal layers and chalcogen
layers comprising TMD compounds. The chalcogen species are especially intriguing for antibody and
antibody fragment functionalization. Figures 1A-C show how papain antibody digestion breaks the
antibody at the disulfide hinge. It is expected that the now-available cysteine will possess a high affinity
for a sulfur surface (with some sulfur vacancies) of the MoS2 transducer, promoting binding of the
fragment base to the transducer and leaving the active region of the antibody available for binding. Not
only does antibody digestion have the potential to promote the desired BRE conformation, but also
reduces transducer-antigen distance, thereby circumventing potential issues with binding and
electrostatic changes occurring outside of the Debye length. Lee et al. showed antibody functionalization
of MoS2 with whole antibodies for prostate specific antigen21. More recently, reports of prostate specific
antigen sensing via ‘chemically reduced’ PSA antibodies bound to thick (1 m) MoS2 transducers through
disulfide linkages between the MoS2 nanosheets and the chemically reduced antibodies with exposed
sulfydryl (−SH) groups22.
Utilization of the dual specific binding attributes of antibody fragments to transducer and antigen is an
attractive means to achieve sensor selectivity. Antibodies are modular, soluble, Y-shaped molecules with
three equally sized portions (Fig. 1A). There is a constant region that binds to interfaces with effector
cells (various types of cells that bring about changes in the body, i.e., immune responses) and two

variable regions that bind to either a specific sequence (linear epitope) or to a specific structure (nonlinear epitope) comprising the antigen. Every antibody consists of heavy chains and light chains linked in
a hinge region by disulfide bonds2. This structure allows for functional fragmentation by proteases.
Examples include pepsin digestion resulting in two fragments (Fig. 1B) or papain digestion resulting in
three fragments (Fig. 1C), two of which are designated as Fab fragments interacting with proteins
comprising the virus. In the case of influenza A (Fig. 1D), hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase are
glycoproteins known to interact with receptor binding domains of antibodies 23 as shown in Fig. 1E. The
other fragment, the part that interacts with the effector cells or molecules is called the Fc fragment
(fragment crystallizable). In this work, laser-crystallized hexagonal MoS2 transducers were functionalized
with monoclonal Fab fragments (Fig. 1E) for selective binding to SARS-CoV-2 or Influenza A
glycoproteins. Additional pathogens may be detected with the same devices by attaching any
complementary antibody fragment (such as the CR3022 Fab in Fig 2A) to the photonically-crystallized
semiconducting MoS2 surface which intrinsically exhibits sulfur defects for bonding of the fragment in a
conformation orienting its antigen binding sites towards the sample for analysis. Another biomacromolecule known to have an affinity for the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein is the
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein domain24-25 (Fig. 2B), which was also examined as a
bio-recognition element (BRE) in the current work. The protein was terminated with histidine, reported to
bind to MoS2 26-27 such that its binding domain was expected to possess an orientation toward the
sample.

Figure 1: Antibodies demonstrate specific binding to a particular antigen with unique compositions and
structures in their binding domains, however the general structure shown in (A) for all antibodies is the
same. Antibody cleavage in the desired location (B-C) can be attained using different protease
treatments. Virus particles have unique structures as well. A schematic of influenza A (D) is shown with
potential target antigens for sensing highlighted in green. Binding of hemagglutinin or HA glycoprotein on
the surface of the virus in (D) in the antigen binding region of the antibody is shown in (A, upper right).
Fragments of the antibody generated via papain digestion are expected to bind to sulfur surfaces
defective with sulfur vacancies (E) in a favorable orientation for interactions with the sample and also
bring the antigen closer to the sensor transducer surfaces, which enhances sensitivity if that distance (x)
is on the order of a Debye length (D). Figures A-D used with permission from American Institute of

compact, disposable electronic chip device with nine individual sensor transducers. Fabrication involved
existing industrial processes (e-beam evaporation, sputtering, and laser-writing) with a low estimated
manufacturing cost per chip. Each of the nine transducers on the chip may be functionalized with the
BRE(s) for pathogen(s) of interest in the adjacent saliva sample. Saliva was selected as a target test fluid
for the sensors not only because it is more easily accessible than a sample from the nasopharynx
(currently used for most institutional COVID-19 tests), but is also reported to contain a higher SARS-CoV2 viral load28. While the sensors presented in the current work are for selective detection of SARS-CoV-2
and Influenza A, the devices are modular, meaning that the general structure of all human antibodies can
be utilized to functionalize sensor transducers for selective detection of diverse pathogens. This feature
is attractive for meeting sudden worldwide needs as chips with the underlying sensor device structure can
be stockpiled and later functionalized on demand with antibodies, antibody fragments, or other BREs for
pathogens of interest. Ultimately, proteins from the receptor binding domain of the antibody rather than
the entire antibody fragment may be used to reduce cost and increase sensitivity29 as well as the ease
with which the sensor could be fabricated, stored, and used as complex biomolecular assemblies such as
antibodies and even fragments are susceptible to denaturation or other undesirable changes in
conformation under ambient conditions.
Influenza A H5 Monoclonal Antibody fragments prepared via papain digestion were obtained (Virusys
IA247) with a reported concentration of 470 g/mL. The complementary hemagglutinin (HA) antigen was
obtained from Abcam (217659). Whole SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies known to bind to the S1
spike protein antigen30 (CR 3022, Abcam 273073) were digested using a Pierce Fab Preparation Kit
(ThermoFisher 44985). SDS PAGE was performed on a mini-PROTEAN system (Biorad) to analyze
protein digestion. The digested proteins were loaded into a precast 20% gradient polyacrylamide gel
(Biorad) using 2x Laemmli sample buffer alongside a Precision Plus Protein Kaleidoscope ladder (Biorad
1610375) and run with a 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS, 8.3 pH running buffer. An EZBlue Gel
stain (Sigma-Aldrich G1041) was used to visualize protein separation in the gel and analyze results of the
digestion (see Fig. S1). A nanophotometer (Implen, Denville Scientific) was used to determine the
CR3022 Fab fragment concentration estimated at 158 g/mL buffered in 7.4 pH phosphate buffer
solution. The complementary antigen was the SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein (Abcam 272105). The
histidine-terminated human ACE2 RBD protein fragment (Abcam 151852) at 700 ng/mL in PBS buffer at
7.4 pH was applied and tested with the complementary SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein peptide (Abcam
273063) and also the same S1 spike protein (Abcam 272105) used for testing antibody fragment
functionalized sensors. For all tests, antibody fragments or proteins were applied to the sensor surface at
their maximum concentration. Influenza A and all SARS-CoV-2 antigens were buffered with PBS at a pH
of 7.4 to match the typical higher pH of extracted saliva31.

A schematic of the devices and their fabrication method is shown in Fig. 3. Metal contacts (15 nm Cr/35
nm Au) with a gap of 85 m were applied via electron beam evaporation to shadow-masked glass
substrates (Corning Eagle XG of 500 m thickness). The substrates and contacts were coated with
continuous a thin layer (3 nm) of amorphous MoS 2 via room-temperature magnetron sputtering as
described in detail elsewhere34 (AFM results shown in Fig. S2). The amorphous material is then
converted into 2H-MoS2 by focusing the output of a continuous-wave, argon-ion laser (Coherent Innova
90C) with a central wavelength of 514 nm was focused through a 100x objective lens onto the amorphous
MoS2 surface with a 1/e2 diameter of approximately 20 m at a power of 125 mW 34-36. The beam was
then rastered over a 190 x 85 m area of the surface at a speed of 100 m/s, while the sample was
contained in ultra high purity argon at 11 Torr to selectively convert the amorphous MoS2 to
nanocrystalline hexagonal MoS2 (2H-MoS2) as verified by Raman spectroscopy. The spacing between
individual laser lines rastered over the surface was 6 μm, resulting in a uniform region of 2H-MoS2. Laser
writing was also used to isolate each device by ablating a line of material between the devices with
different geometries to tune the resistance across the device from 120-1200 k 

of a complete single sensor on a chip (middle) and of the laser-annealed area comprising the sensor
transducer (bottom left). A schematic of one of the nine devices on the chip is shown bottom right.
To measure the sensor response, the two-point resistance of the as-fabricated sensors was measured
with a Signatone 1160 probe station driven by an Agilent 4156C Semiconductor Analyzer. Two-point
resistance measurements were made by sweeping the current from 1 pA to 100 nA and measuring the
voltage between contacts. The measured voltage never exceeded 500 mV to avoid measurementinduced electrochemical reactions at the sensor surface (e.g. water hydrolysis, tyrosine oxidation
(0.7/1.4V depending on protonation state). The initial resistance between contacts was measured with a

fixed probe spacing of 15 mm (example measurements shown in S3). Immediately after the resistance
measurement, a 1 L drop of BRE in solution was pipetted in situ onto the sensor area between the
contacts using the probe station microscope. An initial resistance measurement was recorded 5 seconds
after BRE application, and additional measurements were made over a period of three minutes. A 1L
drop of buffered antigen was then applied to the sensor region and resistance measurements were made
in 5-60 second intervals thereafter. The electrical resistance of the buffered antibody and antigen
solutions is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than the resistance of the active sensor material (depending
on the initial resistance of the sensor, Ro); therefore it is presumed that electrical current was primarily
conducted through the MoS2 sensor material.
After functionalization with 470 g/mL (with expected surface coverage of approximately 109 cm-2),
devices with Ro = 120 k were exposed to HA antigen concentrations from 2-2000 pg/mL. The response
with time for application of 10-12 g/mL antigen was immediate as shown in Fig. 4b with the first
measurement with applied antigen accumulated 5 seconds after introducing the antigen to the sensor.
The decrease in resistance upon addition of both antibody and antigen is consistent with binding of
negatively charged species to the p-type 2H-MoS2 semiconducting material37. Based on the 7.4 pH used
for the measurements here and the reported isoelectric point for HA of 6.5-71 it was anticipated that the
antibody fragments and the antigen would both possess a net negative charge. Sensors functionalized
for detection of influenza A were also exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein. While a change in
resistance was observed (Fig. 4a, red data points), its magnitude was significantly less than that
measured for identical concentrations of the proteins complementary to the antibody, and the response
did not vary with antigen concentration thereby indicating selective HA antigen binding.

Figure 4: Sensor measurement results for (a) influenza A antibody Fab fragment functionalized sensor
subjected to HA and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. Inset shows a photograph of the sensor during the
measurement. The change in resistance with time (b) for antibody functionalization and after exposure to
1 pg/mL HA. The PCR limit is indicated as pg/mL (~100,000 antigen proteins/mL) assuming one copy
detection with ~100 spike proteins per copy for PCR.
For the SARS-CoV-2 measurements, sensor devices with a range of initial resistances Ro = 120-1200 k
were investigated. The initial device resistance was related to the total area of the transducer, which was
isolated by laser writing MoO3 around the device (as shown in Fig.3). The amorphous MoS2 precursor
material will also respond to functionalization and application of antigen, but with less sensitivity than the
crystallized hexagonal MoS2 (h-MoS2), therefore the larger resistance is indicative of a larger effective
sensor as the 1 L drops of applied BRE possessed an area larger than the 150 m x 150 m transducer
area. Devices with enlarged sensor areas (i.e., devices with higher values of R o) resulted in higher
sensitivity as shown in Fig. 5A. The sensors with the largest resistance (Ro = 1200 kW) show a response
to pg/mL antigen concentrations.

The resistance changes for the sensor functionalized with human ACE2 receptor protein are shown in
Fig. 5B. The resistance decreased slightly upon functionalization with the protein and decreased further
upon introduction of antigen, however the decrease did not vary with antigen concentration and was
smaller than that observed for antibody fragment functionalization. The lack of responsivity is likely due
to the increased separation of antigen from antibody for the larger BRE. Computational explorations
including shorter sequences that maintain the key binding epitope of other proteins and peptides binding
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are underway38 and will likely motivate subsequent studies of alternative
BREs.

Figure 5: The sensors tested in (A) show responses to SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein vary with initial
resistances (Ro), with pg/mL antigen detection for sensors with higher Ro. The response of a sensor
exposed to PBS buffer with sodium azide at the concentration matching that of the antigen sample at
10-10 pg/mL was applied to a sensor with Ro = 540 kW. In (B), a small response to two different SARSCoV-2 spike protein antigens with no dependence on concentration is shown for Ro = 1200 k sensors
functionalized with the ACE2 protein.
Characterization of a laser-written MoS2 transducer via Raman spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy before BRE/antigen exposure and after sensor testing and rinsing with PBS suggests
strong binding of the antibody/antigen pairs to the surface. Comparison of Raman spectra (Fig. 6A)
reveals a strong response in the MoS2 A1g peak (408 cm-1), consistent with reports that this peak is more
sensitive than the E2g (383 cm-1) peak to changes in phonon-hole coupling induced by doping39, and may
explain both the broadening of the A1g peak in addition to its reduction in intensity measured after testing.
Sensors in the as-fabricated and post-test states were also investigated via x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS). A nitrogen peak (Fig. 6B) appears adjacent to the Mo 3p3/2 peak for the sensor after
testing in comparison to the lone Mo peak for the as-fabricated transducer analyzed before sensor
testing. The sulfur spectrum, also measured via XPS, is shown in Fig. 6C. There appears to be a subtle
difference in the shape of the S 2p spectra for the sensors before and after testing, however applying the
fitted peaks for the sulfur doublet for the as-fabricated device results in a fit that matches the peak shape
of the as-measured spectrum for the sample after testing. While the presence of sulfur vacancies in the
laser-written MoS2 receptor was confirmed via resonant Raman spectroscopy (S4), detection of sulfur
termination of the as-fabricated MoS2 receptor surface with the antibody fragments may be suggested by
the XPS data40-41, but the signal to noise-ratio was too low for a conclusive measurement. Additional highresolution XPS spectra appear in SI5, in addition to more details regarding fitting of the spectra shown in
Fig. 6.

Figure 6: Materials characterization shows effects of biomolecular binding on influenza A sensors before
(bottom) and after (top) testing with (A) Raman spectra showing preferential suppression of out-of-plane
(A1g) vibrational modes for MoS2 transducer materials after testing indicative of electronic doping. Highresolution XPS spectra of (B) nitrogen peaks appearing adjacent to the molybdenum 3p peak after
functionalization and indicating antibody/antigen binding, and (C) sulfur XPS peaks before and after
sensor testing.
In conclusion, electronic antigen sensors demonstrating selective pg/mL virus detection for Influenza A
and SARS-CoV-2, showing sensitivity competitive with institutional state-of-the-art tests, were fabricated
via a scalable, economical, high-throughput fabrication approach integrating inexpensive, naturally
abundant materials such as recyclable glass and small volumes of the mineral molybdenite (MoS2) to
reduce impact of the used sensor waste stream. The sensor yield from this fabrication approach was
100 percent, that is, all devices tested were functional. Differentiation between viruses at the pg/mL
sensitivity level was demonstrated via bio-functionalizing the surface with antibody fragments generated
by papain digestion of whole antibodies for influenza A and SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Results suggest
antibody fragments were chemisorbed to the MoS2 surface and retained the ability to bind antigens.
Biofunctionalization of the sensor surface with human ACE2 receptor protein did not enable recognition of
SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein binding events, likely due to its larger displacement of the antigen from
the transducer surface. It is anticipated that binding of antibody fragments to a MoS2 surface for a device
with an analogous sensor geometry will yield similar sensitivity for any pathogen with a known
complementary antibody, defining the sensors as truly modular in that the devices can be adapted on
demand to meet a timely diagnostic need. Investigations of alternative BREs may result in even more
affordable and robust devices.
