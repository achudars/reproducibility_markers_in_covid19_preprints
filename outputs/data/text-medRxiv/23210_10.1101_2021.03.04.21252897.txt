Abstract
COVID-19 infections can spread silently, due to the simultaneous presence of significant numbers of both critical and asymptomatic to mild
cases. While for the former reliable data are available (in the form of
number of hospitalization and/or beds in intensive care units), this is not
the case of the latter. Hence, analytical tools designed to generate reliable forecast and future scenarios, should be implemented to help decision
makers planning ahead (e.g. medical structures and equipment). Previous
work of one of the authors shows that an alternative formulation of the
Test Positivity Rate (TPR), i.e. the proportion of the number of persons
tested positive in a given day, exhibits a strong correlation with the number of patients admitted in hospital and intensive care units. In this paper,
we investigate the lagged correlation structure between the newly defined
TPR and the hospitalized people time series, exploiting a rigorous statistical model, the Seasonal Auto Regressive Moving Average (SARIM A).
The rigorous analytical framework chosen, i.e. the stochastic processes
theory, allowed for a reliable forecasting about 12 days ahead, of those
quantities. The proposed approach would also allow decision makers to
forecast the number of beds in hospitals and intensive care units needed
12 days ahead. The obtained results show that a standardized TPR index
is a valuable metric to monitor the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic.
The index can be computed on daily basis and it is probably one of the
best forecasting tools available today for predicting hospital and intensive
care units overload, being an optimal compromise between simplicity of
calculation and accuracy.

Introduction

One of the aspects that makes the COVID-19 pandemic difficult to control, is the
simultaneous presence of significant numbers of both critical and asymptomatic
to mild cases. While for the former reliable data are available (in the form of
number of hospitalizations and/or beds in ICUs), this is not the case of the
latter [35, 13, 18]. In many instances, in fact, those who contracted the virus
are unaware of such a condition and thus enter the status of spreaders or, in
the worse case, super-spreader. Such a phenomenon, commonly referred to as
under-ascertainment, is the primary reason for a disease to spread uncontrolled.
Should it be not carefully checked nor effectively counteracted, it can potentially
grow indefinitely, posing severe health problems at a global level and severely
impacting whole health systems. Action-wise, such a situation calls for at least
two measures: on the one hand policy and decision makers should plan ahead
the needs in terms of medical structures and equipment whereas, on the other
hand, analytical tools designed to generate reliable forecast and future scenarios
should be implemented. While a number of effective approaches have been
studied and proposed for different epidemics over the years, this is not the case
of the CoVID-19 pandemic. In fact, all the efforts so far done to model and
predict such a disease might hardly support the idea that a uniformly “better”
model is available to describe and predict the evolution of such a catastrophic
pandemic. Therefore, even though many valid contributions have been proposed
so far [24], it is not unreasonable to look at those efforts as the building block
of one or more best practices. In particular, the forecasting problem has been
addressed for two of the the most populated countries in the world, i.e. China
[26] and India [37]. A survey including other approaches is presented here [38].
The complexity of such a task is discussed in [4], where the authors analyzed
three different regional-scale models for forecasting and assessing the course
of the pandemic. Along those lines, is worth mentioning the excellent article
[23], where the main reasons leading to the failure of a forecasting models are
presented. Finally, two different predictive approaches has been proposed for
Italy, i.e. one exploiting the bootstrapped prediction generated by a model of
the type ARMA [14] and one based on the simulated annealing algorithm [15].
The Test Positivity Rate (TPR) is one of the indexes often used worldwide
for monitoring the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic, see for example the
coronavirus testing dataset [20], which contains an updated picture of the international situation concerning testing strategies and the associated data for
many countries. Until now, the TPR was mainly studied considering its relationship with confirmed cases [12], for example it was used to estimate COVID-19
prevalence in the different states of US [30]. However, a more intensive use of
diagnosis tests associated with a standardization of the TPR, crucial in light of
differences in the available tests, can solve their limited investigation abilities
(see, e.g., [32]).
In more details, a recent work of one of the authors [19] shows that a standardized COVID-19 Test Positivity Rate (TPR) can be used to predict hospital
overload. In particular, by observing its trend, it is possible to forecast the

course of patients admitted in hospital and in intensive care units. For example, when the TPR reaches a peak, a growth in COVID-19 hospitalisations
lasting 12-15 days can be inferred.
There is an intuitive motivation behind such a behavior: COVID-19 epidemiological data show that symptoms, on average, occur 11 days after the
contraction of the infection and that critical patients are admitted in hospital about 4 days later. If we assume that the TPR is a measurement of the
infections occurring in a given day, in an ideal situation, the infected people
with a critical evolution will be presumably admitted in hospital 15 days later.
More precisely, if the TPR increases in a given day, an increasing number of
active cases (including the unknown ones) can be inferred for the same day, and
presumably the number of infections is increasing too. Thus, after a while the
number of hospitalized people will also increase. In other words, the insight
is that the TPR index models the trend of the COVID-19 infections, and it is
designed to embody the unknown cases. Clearly, for this measure to be valid, all
the administered diagnostic tests should be considered in the TPR calculation,
as pointed out in [19]. However, there are known biases involving diagnostic
tests data that are difficult to deal with, e.g., those related to reporting delays
[20]. As a result, the ideal predictive capacity cannot be assumed in practice,
especially if different kind of tests are used, as in the case of the current Italian
situation.
Despite these limitations, the TPR can be effectively used to deduct important information on the course of the disease, as illustrated in Figure 1, where
the epidemic course in Toscana region in autumn 2020 is depicted. This Figure
also plots the time series of patients admitted in hospitals and in intensive care
units. An interesting correlation between the curves can be observed: the TPR
peak anticipates the peak of patients admitted in hospital and intensive care
units.

The aim of this research is to analyse in details this scenario to get to the
heart of some hard-hitting questions, especially when the TPR is growing considerably. How many days will be needed to reach the peak of hospitalized
people? How many beds in hospitals will be necessary to add? And, in general,
which is the “theoretical” predictive capacity of the proposed TPR index?
Starting from this motivation, we analysed the TPR index time series, as
well as the hospitalized, and ICU patients time series, to investigate the predictive capacity of the TPR index, e.g, to individuate the time lags that can
be effectively inferred from the available data. We first introduce the statistical methodology used and then we present a detailed analysis for four Italian
region, for which data on antigen tests were available as reported in [19].
The lagged correlation between the TPR and hospitalized people time series
will be modeled using a rigorous statistical model, i.e. of the type SARIM A
(short for Seasonal Auto Regressive Moving Average). A detailed description
of the underlying mathematics is presented in the Methods section.
A generalization of the ARIM A (Auto Regressive Moving Average) class
[7], SARIM A models have been introduced to model complex dynamics of the
type stochastic seasonal in many fields of research, such as economics [16] and
[11], engineering [28] or hydrology [29]. In epidemiology, SARIMA models have
been applied in a variety of studies: in [31] the authors applied this model for estimating case occurrence of two diseases: malaria and hepatitis A from January
1980 to June 1995 for the United States whereas in [10] the epidemiological and
aetiological characteristics of influenza have been identified by establishing suitable SARIMA models. In particular, such an approach proved to be accurate in
the forecasting of the percentage of visits for influenza-like illness in urban and
rural areas of Shenyang (China). More recently, [27] used the SARIMA method
– in conjunction with models belonging to the class exponential smoothing –
to predict the trend of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis disease and used the
obtained outcomes to provide evidence for the government to formulate policies
regarding its prevention in mainland China.
The proposed mathematical model allowed us to estimate a predictive lag of
about 12 days of the TPR for the prediction of hospitalized people time series
in some Italian regions. Moreover, we defined a methodology to forecast the
number of beds in hospitals and intensive care units needed 12 days ahead. The
obtained results show that a standardized TPR index is a valuable metrics to
monitor the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic. The index can be computed
daily and it is probably one of the best forecasting tools available today for monitoring hospital and intensive care units overload, being an optimal compromise
between simplicity of calculation and accuracy.

daily frequency – are those necessary to compute the TPR (the number of new
persons tested positive for COVID-19; the number of tests done considering both
molecular (PCR) tests and antigen tests, and the number of healed persons), and
those related to the number of hospitalizations and beds in intensive care units
occupied by patients tested positive for COVID-19. The considered time frame
ranges from Sept. 2 2020 to Feb. 10 2021 for a total of 353 data points. We have
analysed 4 Italian regions for which the collection of the data on the antigenbased tests administered from Oct. 2020 to the 15th of Jan. 2021, has been
possible, i.e. Toscana, Veneto, Piemonte and Alto Adige. The interested reader
may refer to [19] for the details of the data collection procedure. Unfortunately,
certain data concerning the use of diagnosis tests in the considered time frame
are still not available for the other Italian regions. Figure 2 presents the TPR
and hospitalised time series for Toscana, Veneto, Piemonte and Alto Adige.
The presented empirical experiment considers two different scenarios, according to the way the available information is used. Their aim is to answer the
hard-hitting questions that we have set in Figure 1. The first one – which can
be defined of the type real-life – exploits the whole data set and it is designed
to analyse the predictive capacity of TPR, to deliver a “theoretical” time lag
between the two series, and prediction which, by design, cannot be verified being projected into the unknown future. On the contrary, the second experiment
concerns forecasting the number of beds needed in hospitals and intensive care
units after the determined time lag in specific situations in the past, that can
be verified using the available data.

2.1

Analysis of the TPR predictive capacity

In essence, this part of the experiment, being based on the whole data set, can
support only qualitative considerations on the proposed method. In accordance
with the intuition that TPR represents the evolution of infections, the TPR
should impact the hospitalization time series 15 days in advance. Studying the
lagged correlations between the TPR time series and those of patients admitted
in hospitals and ICUs, using the SARIMA model, we have individuated a predictive time lag of about 12 days for all the analysed regions, which confirm our
intuitive hypothesis. Indeed, a 12 days predictive capacity for the TPR, with respect to hospitalized patients instead of the hypothesised 15, can be reasonably
expected considering the above mentioned retrospective revisions effect [20]. In
Table 1, we will report the time lag estimated for each region, along with an
approximated multiplier accounting for the positive (negative) variation in the
number of beds needed for a unit increase (decrease) of the TPR index.
As estimates of future values yet to realize, these predictions can be mainly
exploited to make qualitative inferences. For example, in the Veneto region, if
the TPR increases of one unit, the model estimates that 82 additional beds may
be needed in the near future (after 12 days). As for the ICUs we can expect 12
additional beds. Vice versa, if the TPR decreases in Veneto a similar amount
of beds should be subtracted. In the considered regions, the average variation
of beds in hospital and ICUs are 63 and 16 respectively.

2.2

Forecasting hospital overload

The second scenario envisioned, has been designed to carry out a precise evaluation of the performances delivered by the proposed method. To do so, we
employed a test set with the same length but different starting point, as illustrated in Table 2. In practice, both structure and parameters of each SARIMA
models has been estimated on the training set (this time with different sample sizes but same starting point) and, as already mentioned, evaluated on a
“unknown” portion of data. Such a quantitative evaluation has been conducted
considering different scenarios on all the studied regions: two in which the TPR
was growing considerably in Toscana and Alto Adige; one associated to the
beginning of the “red zone”1 Piemonte; one characterized by a slow growth of
the TPR index in Veneto; and one associated to a fast lowering of the TPR
indicator in Veneto.
As for the REG-SARIMA model, as described in the Methods section, the
model order has been defined using the MAICE procedure and constraining the
Box-Cox λ parameter to 0 (i.e. log – transforming the data). However, being an
exhaustive search of the “best” REG-SARIMA model either unfeasible or or impractical for computational reasons, the competition set has been built following
the Box-Jenkins procedure, as illustrated, e.g., in [7]. Almost all the parameters
of the final models are statistically significant and generate a sequence of residuals which can be deemed acceptable in terms of whiteness. Most of the times,
the Maximum Likelihood algorithm converged quickly, with the only exception

of the Piemonte region. In this case, a “sparse” data generating process in the
autoregressive part involved a lengthy estimation approach – of the type trial
and error – for the definition of the “best” (in AIC sense) model’s non-seasonal
structure.
As already pointed out, the adopted MAICE procedure 13 is constrained to
a specific value of the Box-Cox constant, which therefore has been set to λ0 = 0.
As for the maximum order Γ0 , it has been arbitrarily chosen on a case by case
basis (see the Methods section for details).
The results of the forecasting experiments are summarized in Figure 3. The
reader will certainly notice that the best forecasting results are obtained in
the last experiment concerning the fast TPR lowering scenario in the Veneto
region, where more data are available. However, all the other example provide

present in the preceding of the cut, significant increases in hospitalizations are
estimated. The determined increments are in general comparable to the generic
estimations presented in Table 1.

Discussion

The proposed approach is general and can be exploited in any region/state
under the condition that a set of requirements, below reported, are satisfied:
1. The data on the antigen tests administrated are provided;
2. The time series of new positive cases should include the daily number of
new positives tested using only antigen tests;
3. The TPR should reach a peak before the hospitalized and ICU patients
reach theirs.
The third criterion captures the same effect dealt with in [35, 18]. In particular in [35] it is stated that “the peak of the cases curves shifts when they are
adjusted for under-ascertainment”. The rationale behind this idea is that the
peak of unknown infections necessarily precedes the one related to the hospital
admissions.
In general, when the first two requirements hold, then the 3rd one should
hold as well. Vice-versa, if this is not the case, probably other anomalies or
errors occur in the data. Moreover, issues concerning tests reliability cannot be
excluded a priori – expecially when the ratio between hospitalized and positive
cases growth considerably (e.g. due to tests specificity issues which might be
related to new variants [3]). Should one or more of the above mentioned requirements be unfulfilled, the predictive properties of TPR might be affected.
If this the case, an integration effort should be made to collect the missing data,
and/or correct possible errors. For example, even though requirement 2 was not
met for the Alto Adige region, we were able to analyse the TPR by manually
adding the missing information to the time series of the new positives [19].
At this point, it is worth to compare the TPR index with other COVID19 key indicators, commonly used for monitoring purposes [17], to the end of
assessing their predictive properties. In particular, we have chosen the following
indicators, designed to measure the dynamical behavior of the infections, i.e:
• Growth rate: positives daily variation;
• Incidence: fraction of COVID-19 positives per 100.000 individuals;
• The reproduction number Rt : number of secondary infections generated
from a case at time t.
Table 3 shows the pure predictive capacity with respect to hospitalizations of
these COVID-19 indicators, for comparison with the TPR. While the TPR can

be considered as a measure of the number of infections that occur on a certain
day, also accounting for unknown cases, indicators based on officially reported
positive cases (e.g. incidence and growth rate), measure the variation of official
cases in a given area. Assuming that critical cases are admitted into hospitals
within 4 days after tested positive, such a delay can be taken as a approximate
“upper bound” for their pure predictive capacity.
As for the reproduction number it has to be said that, being based only on
the known (detected) cases, is not designed to capture the hidden variations
generated by the (unknown) asymptomatic. For example, Italy and UK experienced during the summer a strong reduction of the Rt values, which exhibited
values below one. However, the data released at the beginning of the month
of September, showed that, unfortunately, the virus did not stop spreading in
summertime, and the Rt failed to properly react to the ongoing spreading situation. Thus, it is not unreasonable to assume the Rt predictive capacity to be
approximately less or equal 4 days, consistently with other available indicators
based on officially reported cases. Moreover, it might not be unlikely the reduction of such prediction horizon, considering the computation time actually
needed for this indicator to be released.
The impact of under-ascertainment (the ratio of confirmed cases to the true
number of cases) on the reproduction number is also discussed in [35], where the
correlation between testing and the amount of unknown cases is investigated. In
essence, the Rt – Being based on the number of cases officially reported – should
be expected to embody biasing components, to an extent directly proportional
to the quota of unknown cases.
On the contrary, the TPR, as we have demonstrated, adds an approximate
extra time of 11 days (the average number of days between the infection and
symptoms onset) leading to a pure predictive time lag of about 15 days, and a
“theoretical” one of about 12 days.
Last but not least, TPR precision clearly depends also on the data collection
process adopted, which should be designed and implemented to guarantee the
lowest possible error rates in the transmission of the test results. This also to
minimize the negative impact arising from the above mentioned retrospective
revisions. Indeed, it would be possible to define more precise TPR measures
provided that the data were organized in a more structured form, as discussed
in [19]. It is a fact that, by collecting and making available additional infor-

mation – often readily available to the health care provider – the TPR would
significantly improve its reliability. For example, it might be possible to gain
precious insight by simply studying the effectiveness of different test typologies
(diagnosis, screening, surveillance for health care operators and so forth) and
associating specific accuracy information to the different types of tests administered. Clearly, the more (quality) information enter the TPR the more valuable
its contribution in the description and prediction of the covid’s dynamics. For
example, data collection could be improved developing point-of-care instant
screening tests [39], incorporating TPR data transmission and calculation, as
depicted in Figure 4. In this scenario, an improved TPR could be fruitfully
exploited for monitoring, surveillance, and forecasting purposes, as well as to
integrate electronic health records with information retrieved by sensors[39].
Nevertheless, results obtained in this study emphasize the effectiveness of the
proposed approach.
In this paper, we have presented a forecasting method for the short term
prediction of the impact of CoViD-19 disease on the public health system. To
this end, we have provided enough evidence about the goodness of the TPR
as a leading indicator for both the number of people hospitalized and, out of
this group, for those who required a bed in intensive care units. The theoretical
framework chosen – that is the time series analysis – has been particularly useful
for the dynamic comparison and the exploitation of the information contained
in the TPR time series. In our simulations, the model chosen, of the type
REG-SARIMA, was able to generate reliable predictions from a minimum of 8
to 12 lags. However, especially in light of new developments of the disease –
which take the form of many variants – the prediction performances of the REG11

SARIMA model might might be affected, if not impaired altogether. Therefore,
future directions include the study of a more appropriate model, e.g. of the type
regime-switching. Furthermore, additional external information (e.g. the time
varying percentage of critical cases) could be fruitfully exploited in a Bayesian
theoretical framework (e.g. of the type Bayesian Hidden Markov Models [41]) or
using heuristic based approaches (e.g. like the DempsterShafer techniques [5]).
Finally, we will consider the remaining Italian regions as soon as time series of
“enough” lenght become available.

Methods
The standardized TPR index

The TPR is one of the metrics commonly used to infer the level of transmission
of a disease in a population [8], and, as a such, has been also used in the case of
the COVID-19 for different purposes, see for example [20, 30, 33]. However when
different types of tests are used, as it happened during the second phase of the
pandemic in Italy, where antigen tests have been extensively used, the definition
of the TPR becomes more critical. In this study, we will use a standardized
version of the TPR index defined by one of the authors [19], which allows to
integrate antigen tests in the index calculation.
Following the style of [19], where the Greek letters Θ, Φ and µ have been replaced respectively with the letters τ , ρ and ω, for consistency with the statistic
notation later employed, the mean TPR index τ on ω days is defined as follows:
τωA =

dayP ω ∗ 100
dayT ω + dayAω − dayRω − P r

(1)

where dayP ω , dayT ω and dayAω are respectively the average values of new
positive cases, molecular (PCR) tests and antigen tests done in the last ω days.
To compute the TPR index, the average number of healed patients in the last
ω days, dayRω and an estimation for the number of repeated tests P r are
subtracted from the total number of tests. We assume that at least one test
is done for each healed patient. The number of repeated tests P r is computed
using the formula 2, following the approach presented in [19]:
Pr =

dayAω ∗ dayP ω
dayTω + dayAω

(2)

This formula is obtained assumning that the positivity rates for antigen tests and
molecular tests are the same, and thus dayA/P r = dayT /(dayP − P r). Using
this approach the computed P r can be considered an upper bound, because
the molecular tests positivity rate is generally greater then the one related to
antineg tests which are mainly used for screening purposes, see for example [40].
Finally, following the style of [19], a factor ρ is added to τ in order to model
the impact of the number of tests on the remaining susceptible individuals,

which are computed removing the total infected cases I from the population N
of a given region. The number of tests are subtracted removing the repeated
ones and those used for healed patients, obtaining the following formula:
N − I − dayT ω − dayAω + dayRω + P r
N −I
and the TPR index τω is defined as follows:
ρ=

τω = τωA ∗ ρ

The statistical method applied

Throughout the paper, the time series of interest, say xt , is always intended
to be a real–valued, uniformly sampled, sequence of data points of length T ,
formally expressed as
 

T
xt
xt :=
.
(5)
t∈Z+

Furthermore, xt is supposed to be a realization of an underlying stochastic process of the type SARIM A (short for Seasonal Auto Regressive Moving
Average).
Mathematically, SARIMA models take the form of a t-indexed difference
equation – being t as defined in (5) – i.e.:
d
S
φp (B)ΦP (B S ) 5D
S 5 (xt − µ) = θq (B)ΘQ (B )αt .

(6)

Denoting with B, d and D the backward shift operator and the non-seasonal
and seasonal difference operator respectively, defining 5d = 1 − B d and 5D =
1 − B D , we have φp (B) = 1 − φ1 B − φ2 B 2 − .... − φp B p , θq (B) = 1 − θ1 B −
θ2 B 2 − .... − θq B p , ΦP (B S ) = 1 − Φ1 B S − Φ2 B 2S − .... − ΦP B P S and ΘQ (B S ) =
1 − Θ1 B S − Θ2 B 2S − .... − Θq B QS . Here, φ, θ, Φ, Θ, respectively denote the
non-seasonal autoregressive and moving average parameters and the seasonal
autoregressive and moving average parameters. Finally αt is a 0–mean white
noise with finite variance σ 2 . In the present paper, external information is
exploited and embodied in (6) in the form of a matrix of regressors Dj,t−k , with
k ∈ Z+ , weighted by a vector of coefficients βj , i.e.
d
φp (B)ΦP (B S ) 5D
S 5 (xt − µ −

s
X

βj Dj,t−k + ut ) = θ0 + θq (B)ΘQ (B S )αt . (7)

j=1

This particular extension is usually referred to as REG-SARIMA, to stress the
role played by the possibly lagged (of an amount equals to k temporal lags)
regressors, stored in the matrix Dj,t . This types of models are designed to capture the stochastic dynamics generated by the residuals obtained by regressing
the matrix D (the independent variable(s)) on the time series of interest (the
dependent variable). A better insight of the stochastic mechanism governing

the REG-SARIMA equation can be gained by re-expressing equation 6 so as to
emphasize the role played by the term ut in (7), i.e.
xt − µ −

s
X

β̂j Dj,t−k ∼ SARIM A(p, d, q, P, D, Q).

(8)

j=1

This formulation makes clear the flexibility of this approach which allows the
extraction of the significant lags at which the different regressors impact the
time series of interest as well as their magnitudes.
If the integration constants d and D (introduced in Equation 8) are certainly useful to mitigate – if not solve altogether – many stationarity problems,
on the other hand they might not be effective against non-normality and/or
eteroschedasticity issues. Unfortunately, the data considered in this paper are
affected by both these phenomena and therefore, as a coping mechanism, the
well-known one–parameter Box–Cox data transformation has been adopted.
Presented in the mid-sixties in [6], this method has been discussed and applied in a wide range of problems (see, among others, [36], [22] and [25]), given
the widespread acceptance gained over the years. Its mathematical formulation
is quite straightforward and takes the form of a power transformation, i.e.
( λ
xt −1
if λ 6= 0
λ ,
xt (λ) =
ln(xt ), if λ = 0.
By embodying the λ parameter in Equation 7, the model employed in this paper
is finally defined, i.e.
d
φp (B)ΦP (B S ) 5D
S 5 (xt (λ) −

s
X

βj Dj,t−k + ut ) = θ0 + θq (B)ΘQ (B S )αt . (9)

j=1

The inference procedures carried out for the estimation of Equation 9 are of
two types: maximum likelihood for the SARIMA parameters {φ, θ, Φ, Θ, d, D}
and ordinary least squares for the vector β. Finally, the hyper-parameters
{(p, d, q, P, D, Q)} as well as the Box-Cox constant λ are estimated within the
framework of the Information Theory as explained in the following section.

4.3

Estimation of the model order and the λ parameter

Akaike’s Information Criterion AIC ([1], [9], [21]) – one of the most popular
model selector – will be employed to choose the SARIMA model order as well
as the Box-Cox λ parameter. The selection of those constants is not a trivial
task as it entails the solution of a conditional multi-objective problem induced
by the 6–dimensional vector of unknown constants Γ ≡ {(p, d, q, P, D, Q)} conditional to the Box-Cox paramter λ. The estimation method employed to find
the “best” conditioned vector of hyper-parameters – that is the one governing
the selected order structure M ∗ ≡ (Γ̂∗ |λ∗ ) – relies on the information theory

and, in particular, on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). At its core, AIC
is based on an estimate of the expected relative entropy (the Kullback–Leibler
divergence) contained in an estimated model, that is the degree of divergence
from the “true” theoretical model. Assuming Xt to be randomly drawn from
an unknown distribution H(x), with density h(x), estimation of h is done by
means of a parametric family of distributions with densities [f (x|θ; θ ∈ Θ)],
θ the unknown parameters’ vector. Denoting by f (z|θ̂) the predictive density
function, by f the true model and by h the approximating one, Kullback-Leiber
divergence takes the form
Z
Z
I(h(z); f (z|θ̂)) = h(z) log h(z)dz − h(z) log f (z|θ̂)dz,
(10)
which, after some algebra, can be written as follows:
Z
Z
L(Xn ; H) = h(z) log f (z|θ̂)dz = log f (z|θ̂)dH(z).
This quantity can be estimated
PT by replacing H with its empirical distribution
Ĥ, so that L(XT ; Ĥ) = T1 α=1 log f (Xα |θ̂). This is an overestimated quantity
of the expected log likelihood, given that Ĥ is closer to θ̂ than H. The related
bias can be written as follows:
n
o
b(H) = EH L(Xn ; Ĥ) − L(Xn ; H) .
Denoting, by the Greek letter ξ the number of estimated parameters, Akaike
proved that b(H) = Tξ , so that the information based criterion takes the form
L(XT ; Ĥ) + Tξ . By multiplying this quantity by −2, finally AIC is defined as
−2 log L(XT ; Ĥ) + 2ξ.

Elaborating on [34], the correct formulation of AIC for the model expressed
in Equation 9 takes the form

parameter (which in Equation 12 has been denoted with λ0 ) a sequence of AIC
values is obtained. This is the first of the two-step selection strategy adopted in
the present paper, which is usually referred to as M AICE (short for Minimum
AIC Expectation) [2] procedure. In the second step, the order (Γ∗ ) satisfying:
Γ∗ |λ0 = arg

AIC(Γ|λ0 ),

(13)

(Γ̂|λ0 )≤Γ̂0

i.e. the minimizer of the AICs generated by the candidate models, will be
the winner model structure. However, Equations 12 and 13 are not designed
to estimate the Box-Cox λ parameter. To this end, a grid search approach –
over a set Λ of B competing parameters {λj ; j = 1, 2, . . . , B} – has been applied. Each λ has been evaluated in terms of the contributions given in terms
of both data normalization and statistical significance of the external regressor.
Finally, M AICE procedure requires the definition of an upper bound for all
the Γ parameters, as a maximum order a given process can reach. This choice,
unfortunately, is a priori and arbitrary.
