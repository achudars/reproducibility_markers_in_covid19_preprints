Abstract

38

Background

39

Rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan prompted heightened

40

surveillance in Guangzhou and elsewhere in China. Modes of contact and

41

risk of transmission among close contacts have not been well estimated.

42

Methods

43

We included 4950 closes contacts from Guangzhou, and extracted data

44

including modes of contact, laboratory testing, clinical characteristics of

45

confirmed cases and source cases. We used logistic regression analysis to

46

explore the risk factors associated with infection of close contacts.

47

Results

48

Among 4950 closes contacts, the median age was 38.0 years, and males

49

accounted for 50.2% (2484). During quarantine period, 129 cases (2.6%)

50

were diagnosed, with 8 asymptomatic (6.2%), 49 mild (38.0%), and 5

51

(3.9%) severe to critical cases. The sensitivity of throat swab was 71.32%

52

and 92.19% at first to second PCR test. Among different modes of contact,

53

household contacts were the most dangerous in catching with infection of

54

COVID-19, with an incidence of 10.2%. As the increase of age for close

55

contacts and severity of source cases, the incidence of COVID-19

56

presented an increasing trend from 1.8% (0-17 years) to 4.2% (60 or over

57

years), and from 0.33% for asymptomatic, 3.3% for mild, to 6.2% for

58

severe and critical source cases, respectively. Manifestation of

59

expectoration in source cases was also highly associated with an

60

increased risk of infection in their close contacts (13.6%). Secondary

61

cases were in general clinically milder and were less likely to have

62

common symptoms than those of source cases.

63

Conclusions

64

In conclusion, the proportion of asymptomatic and mild infections

65

account for almost half of the confirmed cases among close contacts. The

66

household contacts were the main transmission mode, and clinically more

67

severe cases were more likely to pass the infection to their close contacts.

68

Generally, the secondary cases were clinically milder than those of source

69

cases.

Introduction

71

In December 2019, the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019

72

(COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus

73

2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and has

74

now developed into a global pandemic1. As of 15 March, worldwide a

75

total of 153,517 people have been infected including 5,735 deaths, with

76

81,048 cases and 3,204 deaths in China2.

77

The viral, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics of the disease have

78

been documented3-11. However, some questions important for control of

79

the epidemic remain outstanding10. For example, what is the

80

transmissibility of the virus? What patients are more likely to spread the

81

virus? What mode of contacts is most likely to cause transmission? What

82

is the incidence of complete asymptomatic infection?

83

These questions are addressed in this follow-up study of 4,950 persons

84

with close contact with confirmed COVID-2019 patients in Guangzhou,

85

China.

86

Methods

87

Study Oversight

88

This is a prospective cohort study of all 4,950 persons who had a close

89

contact (or close contacts in short) with confirmed COVID-2019 patients

90

(or source cases in short) identified between January 13 and March 6,

91

2020, in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China. A total of 129 cases

92

were diagnosed with 42 before quarantine and 87 during the quarantine.

93

Data Sources

94

Close contacts include such unprotected contacts as living in the same

95

household, face-to-face working together, sharing the same classroom,

96

visit or stay in the same hospital ward, taking the same car or aeroplane,

97

sharing neighbouring seats in the same train or ship as a diagnosed

98

COVID-19 patient. It also includes giving direct care to a diagnosed

99

patient. The full definition and whole list of forms of close contacts were

100

showed in Appendix 1. When a COVID-19 patient was diagnosed then

101

his or her close contacts were traced, and his or her close contacts may be

102

locals or non-locals, if he or she had a history of travel or business. Thus,

103

the source cases of close contacts included both local and non-local

104

patients.

105

Between January 13, and March 6, 2020, 347 cases12 were diagnosed in

106

Guangzhou and their 4,950 close contacts were identified and enrolled in

107

the study. Standard questionnaires were used to collect data at the time of

108

enrollment, which was also the start of quarantine13. The registration form

109

(Appendix 2-Table a) was completed for each close contact. All close

110

contacts were put under quarantine for 14 days from the last contact or

111

longer for some cases if collection of samples for PCR testing was

112

delayed. We recorded the last date of contact, the date of the start of

113

quarantine, the date symptoms appeared, the date of each sampling, and

114

the date of first positive PCR result. Temperature and symptoms

115

monitoring were conducted every day and recorded in a standard form

116

(Appendix 2-Table b).

117

Throat swab samples were collected and a real time RT-PCR testing

118

performed once every two days. In one patient, the PCR testing was

119

performed ten times as previous tests were consistently negative and has

120

not released from quarantine. A close contact was released from

121

quarantine if he had no symptoms and PCR testing was e negative for two

122

consecutive samples. For those who were diagnosed with COVID-19,

123

treatments followed and quarantine continued till recovery.

124

Data on demographic factors, risk factors, exposure history, mode of

125

contact, symptoms, radiological and laboratory findings, severity of

126

disease, treatments, and prognoses were collected on all close contacts

127

(data form in Appendix 2). The information of source cases was also

128

obtained through monitoring data from Guangzhou CDC. Close contacts

129

confirmed COVID-19 (or secondary cases in short) and their source cases

130

are individually linked (details in Appendix 2) and their relations and

131

contact modes were determined accordingly. For the 161 source cases

132

who did not live in Guangzhou, so we could not know their severity of

133

COVID-19, and could not linked their information with secondary cases.

134

Definitions

135

A source case is a person diagnosed with COVID-2019 a close contact

136

person has made close contact with. Close contacts may have made

137

contact with one or more patients.

138

The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was made, according to the 6th

139

National Criteria for Diagnosis of COVID-2019 in China14. As the study

140

participants were all close contacts, a COVID-2019 case was referred to a

141

person who had both a positive result for the virus’ nucleic acid and

142

symptoms and/or abnormal radiological/laboratory findings before,

143

during or even after the 14 days of quarantine. Asymptomatic infection

144

must have not clinical symptoms, must be positive for the virus’ nucleic

145

acid, and have or be free of radiological and/or laboratory alterations that

146

indicate viral infection.

147

Fever was defined as an axillary temperature of 37.5°C or above. Severity

148

of the disease includes 5 categories: asymptomatic, mild, moderate,

149

severe and critical. Mild cases were those who had mild symptoms but no

150

radiological alterations. Moderate cases are those who had both

151

symptoms and radiological alterations. Severe cases were those who had

any of the following: breathing rate ≥30/min, or oxygen saturation level

153

≤

154

(1mmHg=0.133kPa), or lung infiltrates >50% within 24 to 48 hours.

155

Critical cases are those who had respiratory failure requiring mechanical

156

ventilation, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction/failure.

157

The mode of contact was classified into 5 categories: public transport

158

vehicles, healthcare settings, households, multiple, and others. Tourists in

159

the ship cruise were put in a special exposure group called “Dream

160

Cruise”. The multiple contact includes those who were exposed to more

161

than one mode of contact (e.g. household and public transport vehicles).

162

Diagnosis of RT-PCR test, radiological and blood examination

163

Throat swab samples were collected by trained CDC staff and transported

164

and stored in -70  refrigerators in biological safety level 2 laboratories.

165

Samples of cluster cases were also sent to China CDC for re-examination.

166

RT-PCR testing was performed by qualified staff and results were

167

identified through open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid

168

protein (N) in accordance with the protocol established by China CDC13.

169

Details on laboratory processes are provided in Appendix 3. Radiological

170

and blood examinations were conducted in tertiary hospitals designated

171

for treating COVID-19 patients according to national standards14.

172

Statistical analysis

173

The infection rate was estimated by dividing the number of diagnosed

174

cases with the number of close contact persons and compared among

175

different contact groups. Categorical variables were described in number

176

and percentage (%), and continuous variables in median and interquartile

177

range (IQR). Differences in proportions were tested by using the χ2 test.

178

Univariate and multivariable logistic regressions were performed to

179

adjust for potential factors that may affect the risk of developing

180

COVID-19, and odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI)

181

were estimated.

182

Analyses were all performed with the SAS software (version 9.4 for

183

Windows, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Statistical tests were

184

two-sided, and P values of less than 0.05 were considered to indicate

185

statistical significance.

186

Ethics Approval

187

Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Southern

188

Medical University. Data collection and analysis of close contacts and

189

source cases were also required by the National Health Commission of

190

the People s Republic of China to be part of a continuing public health

191

outbreak investigation. Written informed consent was waived in light of

the urgent need to collect data.

193

Results

194

Baseline characteristics of close contacts

195

By the end of the Mar 6, 2020, all the 4950 close contacts were enrolled.

196

Males accounted for 2484 (50.2%). The median (IQR) age was 38.0 years

197

and 783 (15.8%) were under 18 years (Table 1). Exposure in public

198

transports was the commonest type of close contact. On average, 2.4 PCR

199

tests were performed for each person. 129 (2.6%) cases were identified

200

with 8 (6.2%) being asymptomatic throughout and 5 (3.9%) being

201

clinically severe or critical.

202

The 4950 close contacts were quarantined for an average of 4.0 days,

203

with 2.0 days for cases and 4.0 days for non-cases (Table 1 and Figure 1).

204

In 20 persons, quarantine was unnecessary as they last contacted a patient

205

14 days ago and were free of symptoms and PCR test negative at the time

206

they were identified. In 340 persons, quarantine was longer than 14.0

207

days because the PCR tests were delayed (Figure 1). There was on

208

average 1.0 day from the start of quarantine to the first PCR testing,

209

suggesting a slight delay in collecting samples for laboratory diagnosis

210

(Table 1). PCR diagnosis was made within 14 days of quarantine for all

211

129 cases but two for whom it was on the 16th day; all the 8

212

asymptomatic cases were diagnosed within 10 days of quarantine (Figure

213

1).

214

There were on average 11.0 days from the last contact to the start of

215

quarantine (Table 1), suggesting quarantine could in theory start 11.0 days

216

earlier than it actually did. The delay from the last contact to quarantine

217

was on average 1.0 day with over 3 days for 11 cases (Table 1 and Figure

218

2). In symptomatic cases, there was on average 1.0 day from the last

219

contact to symptoms onset, with 31 cases having already developed

220

symptoms before the last contact and 22 cases over 3 days after the last

221

contact (Table 1 and Figure 2). In 33 cases for whom the date of

222

symptoms onset was clear and the first PCR test was negative, we

223

estimated that there were on average a delay of 2.0 days from symptoms

224

to first PCR positivity and in 22 (66.7%) cases symptoms appeared 7.0

225

days prior to PCR positivity (Figure 2).

226

Mode of contact and risk of transmission

227

The age of close contacts was linearly associated with an increasing risk

228

of getting infected after close contact with source patients (Table 2). The

229

incidence was 1.8%, 2.2%, 2.9%, and 4.2% respectively for 0-17, 18-44,

230

45-59, and 60 or above age-groups (P=0.0016 for trend). Females seemed

231

as likely as males to catch the infection after close contacts with patients

232

(P=0.1202).

233

Among different modes of contact, household contacts and multiple

234

contacts (with 70% including household contacts) were most dangerous

235

in catching the infection and associated with an incidence of COVID-19

236

10.2% and 13.0%, respectively (Table 2). Healthcare settings contacts

237

and public transport vehicles, the other two common forms of contacts,

238

were associated with a risk of 1.0% and 0.1%, which were only about 10%

239

and 1%, respectively, of the risk of household contacts (P<0.0001).

240

Furthermore, clinically more severe patients were more likely to pass the

241

infection to their close contacts than less severe ones (P<0.0001 for

242

trend). Asymptomatic infection is least likely to pass on the infection,

243

with a chance of 33 per 100,000 contacts. Mild and moderate infections

244

could increase the risk to 3.3% to 5.6%, and severe and critical infections

245

to 6.2%. Manifestation of some symptoms in source patients was also

246

associated with an increased risk of infection in their close contacts. For

247

example, fever could increase the risk by over 100% (P=0.0103) and

248

expectoration by 400% (P<0.0001), whereas cough, fatigue and myalgia

249

did not statistically significantly increase the risk (P>0.3700). In addition,

250

a higher frequency of contact and greater number of patients contacted

251

were highly associated with household contacts and thus were not

252

separately assessed (Table 1S).

253

The above conclusions remained unchanged and statistically significant

254

in multiple regression analyses which included age, sex, mode of contact,

255

severity of source patients and expectoration included in the models

256

(Table 2).

257

Comparison of source cases and secondary cases

258

We compared the characteristics between secondary cases and source

259

cases they contacted with to see whether they may differ in the severity of

260

the infection. Among 129 secondary cases, source cases were identifiable

261

only for 121 cases. As compared with their 69 source cases, the 121

262

secondary cases were in general clinically milder and were less likely to

263

have such common symptoms as fever, cough, expectoration, fatigue,

264

myalgia and diarrhea (P<0.05). Secondary cases are also less likely than

265

source cases to demonstrate radiological and laboratory alterations related

266

to the infection (P<0.001). Most of the differences between them were

267

both clinically important and statistically significant.

268

The clinical differences between source and secondary patients might be

269

due to the fact that secondary cases were diagnosed earlier and the

270

disease is milder at the early stage than source cases. To exclude this

271

possibility, we also compared source cases with secondary cases who

272

were diagnosed before the time of quarantine and not supposed not be

273

early-stage patients. The conclusion remained unchanged (Table 2S).

274

Validity of PCR for Diagnosis

275

Among 4950 close contacts, 4653 completed at least one RT-PCR testing.

276

If a person has no symptoms and the PCR test was negative, further

277

testing continued to be arranged within 48 hours till he was diagnosed

278

with the infection or released free of the infection from quarantine. The

279

series of testing in the same persons allowed us to estimate the sensitivity

280

and specificity of the PCT testing. The results were shown in (Table 3S).

281

In brief, the sensitivity was only 71.9% for the first testing and increased

282

to 92.2% by the second testing, to 96.9% by the third testing, and to 100.0%

283

by the sixth testing. In contrast, the first testing achieved a specificity

284

99.96%, which was reduced by less than 0.1% by further testing.

285

Discussion

286

Between January 13, and March 6, 2020, 4950 close contacts of

287

confirmed cases were enrolled in Guangzhou, which is a city with large

288

confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside Hubei province in China. Here we

289

evaluated the modes of contact and risk of transmission among close

290

contacts, provides insights into transmission and control of COVID-19.

291

To our knowledge, this study is the largest prospective cohort data of

292

close contacts with COVID-19.

293

Our study provided further evidence that the older aged contacts and

household contacts were more likely to be infected3,4,7,15. The incidence of

295

asymptomatic and mild infections was high (57/129), and the risk of

296

transmission increased as the symptoms of source cases worsen, with

297

range from 0.33% (asymptomatic) to 6.2% (severe and critical). The

evaluating control measures, and guiding the global response.

301

Household contacts characteristics have been discussed in previous

302

studies3,7, which were the source of person-to-person transmission

303

evidence. And our study further confirmed that due to contact frequently

304

of household, it was considered as a high-risk factor for COVID-19

305

transmission. The incidence of household contacts estimated 10.2% in

306

our study, and in other study out of Hubei Province was 14.9 %16, which

307

is consistent with current understanding of COVID-19 transmission.

308

However, other modes of contact have been less reported for guiding

309

persons self-protection and government for strengthened control

310

measures. In our study, 1540 close contacts were Dream Cruise

311

passengers, and the infected incidence was 0.1% (2/1540), which was

312

estimated low. This result was consistent with previous research, and

313

Nishiura H17 estimated the incidence of infection with COVID-19 on a

314

cruise ship, called Diamond Princess, and the risk of infection among

315

passengers contact occasionally was considered to be very limited.

316

However, the food service workers had a high infected incidence in the

317

cruise ship18 largely due to their frequent contact to others and had high

318

chance to inhale droplet spread.

319

The risk transmission of other public transport vehicles and healthcare

320

settings was estimated low, which were only about 1% and 10% of the

321

risk of household contacts (P<0.0001). It suggests that control personnel

322

density on public places and distance oneself from others are very

323

effective prevention and control measures19. Giving that public transport

324

vehicles was at low risk to infected COVID-19, and it is considered

325

feasible to take public transportation when returning to work or school on

326

the premise of low personnel density.

327

The proportion of close contacts confirmed with asymptomatic and mild

328

were high with 44.2 % (57/129). Chowell20 estimated asymptomatic

329

proportion was at 17.9% among 700 infected individuals on Diamond

330

Princess, and Miyama T21 estimated at 30.8% among 13 Japanese

331

evacuees from Wuhan City. Taking the results from several studies into

332

account, Chowell20 thinks that asymptomatic or mild cases combined

333

represent about 40% to 50% of all infections. It was consistent with the

334

results of this study.

335

Given the large proportion of asymptomatic and mild infections, we are

336

concerned about the rate at which they infect others. Wendtner22 showed

337

that patients with COVID-19 had high levels of the virus in throat swabs

338

early in their illness, when their symptoms were mild. But no study had

339

reported the infection risk of asymptomatic and mild cases to others, and

340

asymptomatic infections might be seeding new outbreaks23. In our study

341

showed that as severity increases, the risk of transmission increases in

342

COVID-19 patients. Only 1 (1/305, 0.33%) and 19 (19/576, 3.3%) close

343

contact was infected by asymptomatic and mild source case, and it

344

suggested the limited transmission capacity in asymptomatic and mild

345

cases. The symptomatic cases with expectoration symptom had a higher

346

transmission capacity. These might be associated with more viral load of

347

SARS-CoV-2 in patients with severe symptoms24.

348

Given the current evidence, due to asymptomatic cases have limited

349

transmission capacity, then the primary surveillance and control measures

350

should focus on symptomatic contacts. On the other hand, though a

351

person with asymptomatic or mild symptoms may not easy to spread

352

SARS-COV-2, and had a low probability to infect other. While, we

353

should also be alert for incubation transmission25. Asymptomatic and

354

mild patients might not aware of their infection and therefore not isolate

355

themselves or seek treatment, or they might be overlooked by health-care

356

professionals and thus unknowingly transmit the virus to others. Due to

357

the imperfect sensitivity of the PCR test (Table 3S), some asymptomatic

358

contacts may be missed26,27. Thus, based our evidence, two times or more

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042606; this version posted March 26, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

359

PCR tests were recommended to ensure that almost all patients could to

360

be diagnosed.

361

Previous studies suggested that compared with patients initially infected

362

with SARS-Cov-2 in Wuhan City, the symptoms of patients in out of

363

Wuhan are relatively mild28,29. And a research reported that the symptoms

364

of imported cases (n=15) were severe than those of secondary cases

365

(n=17)30, but due to the small sample size, it may be necessary to verify

366

the phenomenon. Thus, our study compared the severity of symptom

367

between sources cases and their secondary cases. And the severity of

368

clinical symptoms onset was more severe to source cases compared to

369

secondary cases (P<0.001). It may be related to the higher Hubei

370

exposure history of source cases (20/33 vs. 21/37) than secondary cases.

371

This phenomenon was also apparent during the transmission of

372

MERS-CoV31.

373

Our study has some notable limitations. Firstly, we have not the data to

374

show the prognosis of disease. Because many patients remained in the

375

hospital and the outcomes were unknown at the time of data cutoff, we

376

censored the data regarding their clinical outcomes and thus entire course

377

of the disease cannot be fully demonstrated. Secondly, we used logistic

378

regression analysis instead of cox proportional hazards model, because of

379

the low incidence (2.6%) of COVID-19 among close contacts. In addition,

380

by the end of the cohort, there were 245 close contacts remaining

381

quarantines, but they were not likely to become COVID-19 cases, thus

382

there was no censored data. Thirdly, there may be a recall bias of the

383

symptoms at onset among source cases and secondary cases.

384

In conclusion, our cohort study showed that the proportion of

385

asymptomatic and mild infections account for almost half of the

386

confirmed cases among close contacts. The household contacts were the

387

main transmission mode, and clinically more severe cases were more

388

likely to pass the infection to their close contacts. In general, the

389

secondary cases were clinically milder than those of source cases. The

390

results provide the evidentiary foundation for evaluating control measures,

391

and guiding the global response.
