Abstract

Background

28
29
30

Bacterial superinfections associated with COVID-19 are common in ventilated ICU patients and impact
morbidity and lethality. However, the contribution of antimicrobial resistance to the manifestation of
bacterial infections in these patients has yet to be elucidated.

31

Methods

32
33
34
35
36

We collected 70 Gram-negative bacterial strains, isolated from the lower respiratory tract of
ventilated COVID-19 patients in Zurich, Switzerland between March and May 2020. Species
identification was performed using MALDI-TOF; antibiotic susceptibility profiles were determined by
EUCAST disk diffusion and CLSI broth microdilution assays. Selected Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates
were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing.

45

P. aeruginosa (46%) and Enterobacterales (36%) comprised the two largest etiologic groups. Drug
resistance in P. aeruginosa isolates was high for piperacillin/tazobactam (65.6%), cefepime (56.3%),
ceftazidime (46.9%) and meropenem (50.0%). Enterobacterales isolates showed slightly lower levels
of resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam (32%), ceftriaxone (32%), and ceftazidime (36%). All
P. aeruginosa isolates and 92% of Enterobacterales isolates were susceptible to aminoglycosides, with
apramycin found to provide best-in-class coverage. Genotypic analysis of consecutive P. aeruginosa
isolates in one patient revealed a frameshift mutation in the transcriptional regulator nalC that
coincided with a phenotypic shift in susceptibility to β-lactams and quinolones.

Conclusions

47
48
49
50
51

Considerable levels of antimicrobial resistance may have contributed to the manifestation of bacterial
superinfections in ventilated COVID-19 patients, and may in some cases mandate consecutive
adaptation of antibiotic therapy. High susceptibility to amikacin and apramycin suggests that
aminoglycosides may remain an effective second-line treatment of ventilator-associated bacterial
pneumonia, provided efficacious drug exposure in lungs can be achieved.

1. Introduction

The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in high rates of intensive care
unit (ICU) admissions of critically ill patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS). Respiratory viral infections predispose patients to secondary bacterial infections which are
associated with increased morbidity and case fatality rates [1,2]. Particularly, secondary bacterial
infections acquired in the setting of ICU-treatment are also independently associated with higher risk
of mortality when compared with community-acquired infections [3].

Secondary bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients, hereafter referred to as superinfections, have not
been intensively investigated thus far. Yet, mainly small cohort studies have reported high
superinfection rates in critically ill and/or deceased COVID-19 patients. For instance, a retrospective
cohort study by Zhou et al. documented secondary infections in 50% of deceased COVID-19 patients
and ventilator-associated pneumonia in a third of mechanically ventilated patients, despite the fact
that 95% of patients received antibiotic treatment [4]. A study by Du et al. described secondary
bacterial infections at a late stage of disease in 10 of 21 deceased patients with the etiological
spectrum including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus spp., Acinetobacter baumannii and
Escherichia coli [5]. However, a comprehensive antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance of
bacterial superinfection in critically ill COVID-19 patients treated in the ICU has yet to be reported.

In recent years, the incidence of infections caused by gram-negative bacilli (GNB), especially
multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms, in highly susceptible ICU patients has increased [6,7].
Particularly infections caused by MDR GNB are associated with a substantial risk of morbidity and inhospital mortality for the critically ill [3]. The increased exposure of patients to antimicrobials and the
global surge in hospital and especially ICU admissions due to the COVID-19 pandemic are rising
concerns on the long-term impact on AMR in the acute care setting [8–10]. During the beginning of
the COVID-19 pandemic, uncertainty regarding the novel disease has resulted in high antibiotic use
since empirical antibiotic treatment was commonly prescribed before or at the time of hospital
admission. A meta-analysis by Rawson et al. revealed that 72% of hospitalized patients received
antimicrobial therapy despite low initial evidence of community-acquired co-infections at that time
[11]. Similarly, the ISARIC WHO Clinical Characterization Protocol reported preceding anti-infective
treatment in 76.6% of hospitalized patients [12].

A detailed understanding of the epidemiology and AMR pattern of bacterial superinfections in
critically ill COVID-19 patients is urgently needed for adequate treatment. Here we report the bacterial
spectrum and the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of respiratory GNB isolated from ventilated ICU
patients during the first COVID-19 wave in Switzerland. In addition, we investigate changes in the
antimicrobial resistance over time for a single P. aeruginosa infection under antibiotic therapy using
whole-genome sequencing (WGS).

100
101
102
103

This study was conducted within the MicrobiotaCOVID cohort, a single-center, prospective
observational study conducted at the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland. The study was approved
by the Local Ethics Committee of the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland (Kantonale Ethikkommission Zurich
BASEC ID 2020 – 00646). All patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the ICU
requiring mechanical ventilation between March and May 2020 were included (n = 40). Informed
consent of all patients was obtained. The study cohort during this time period has been described
recently [13].

104

2.2 Sample collection

107

109
110
111

Longitudinal collection and analysis of respiratory samples, such as tracheobronchial secretions (TBS)
and bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL), was performed at frequent intervals from each ventilated patient.
Samples were initially processed at the diagnostic laboratory of the Institute of Medical Microbiology
(IMM) in the course of routine diagnostics. Species identification was performed with MALDI-TOF MS
(Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) using the direct formic acid transfer method [14]. Repetitive
detected isolates of the same species in the same patients were included to monitor changes in
antimicrobial susceptibility over time.

Bacterial isolates were inoculated onto Columbia sheep blood (COS) agar and were incubated for 24
hours prior to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The European Committee on Antimicrobial
Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) disk diffusion method (version 8.0, January 2020) [15] was applied to
determine the isolate’s antimicrobial susceptibility to piperacillin/tazobactam (TPZ36),
amoxicillin/clavulanate (AMC30), ceftriaxone (CRO30), cefepime (FEP30), meropenem (MEM10),
amikacin (AK30), tobramycin (TOB10), gentamicin (CN10), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT25)
ceftazidime (CAZ10) and ciprofloxacin (CIP5). The antibiotic SirScan Disks were obtained from i2a
Diagnostics, Montpellier, France. Interpretative criteria in the EUCAST guidelines 2020 [16] were
applied to set clinical resistance breakpoints and translate inhibition zone diameters into either
resistant (R) or non-resistant (susceptible, S and “susceptible, increased exposure” (intermediate), I)
phenotypes. Interpretative criteria for P. aeruginosa resistance to GEN were derived from the EUCAST
guidelines 2019 [17] instead, since they have been removed from the 2020 version. Interpretative
criteria for Burkholderia cenocepacia resistance to MEM and SXT (Table S3) were derived from the
Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines 2020 [18].

Antimicrobial susceptibilities were further assessed by broth microdilution assays following the CLSI
guidelines [18,19]. Interpretative criteria in the EUCAST guidelines 2020 were followed to set clinical
breakpoints and translate MICs into drug susceptibility. Interpretative criteria for P. aeruginosa
resistance to GEN were derived from the EUCAST guidelines 2019 instead, since they have been
removed from the 2020 version. For the aminoglycoside plazomicin, the FDA-identified interpretative
criteria of 2, 4, and 8 mg/L were used for susceptible, intermediate, and resistant, respectively
( https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-resources/plazomicin-injection as of 06/14/2019, date
last accessed 12/16/2020).

The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) performance standard for the aminoglycoside apramycin
was set to a modal value of 4 mg/L for E. coli ATCC 25922 and an acceptable range of 2-8 mg/L.
Epidemiological cut-off values (ECOFFs) of 8 mg/L for Enterobacterales and 16 mg/L for P. aeruginosa
were used as interpretative criteria [20].

2.4 Whole-Genome Sequencing of selected P. aeruginosa isolates

140
141

Whole-genome sequencing was applied to detect resistance determinants of eight selected
consecutive P. aeruginosa isolates from a single patient.

DNA was extracted from cultures of the clinical isolates grown on Columbia sheep blood (COS) agar
plates using the DNeasy® UltraClean® Microbial kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Library preparation was performed using the Qiagen® QIAseq FX
DNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing library
quality and size distribution were analyzed on a fragment analyzer automated CE system (Advanced
Analytical Technologies Inc., Heidelberg, Germany), using the fragment analyzer 474 HS next
generation sequencing (NGS) kit. Sequencing libraries were pooled in equimolar concentrations and
paired-end sequenced (2 × 150 bp) on an Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina®, San Diego, CA, USA).

150
151
152
153

Raw sequencing reads (FASTQ) were filtered and trimmed using Trimmomatic [21]. CONTIGS were
assembled from processed FASTQ files using SPAdes (v3.13.0). To identify antibiotic resistance
determinants CONTIGS were analyzed using the command line version of Resistance Gene Identifier
(RGI; v4.2.2) and CARD (Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database, v3.1.0) [22,23].

159

A total of 168 GNB were identified in 19 of the 40 patients (48%) of the MicrobiotaCOVID cohort. A
representative subset of 70 GNB, including repetitive isolates from 17 patients, were further analyzed
in this study.

The two largest groups of pathogens in our panel of COVID-19 GNB isolates were Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (46%) and Enterobacterales (36%). Burkholderia cenocepacia (17%) was found in smaller
numbers, as well as a single Acinetobacter bereziniae isolate (Figure 1A). Within the order of
Enterobacterales, Enterobacter cloacae (32%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (28%) were the two
predominant species, followed by Klebsiella aerogenes (20%), Citrobacter spp. (16%), and
Escherichia coli (4%) (Figure 1B). The species distribution of the analyzed subset (n = 70) was shown
to be representative for all the identified Gram-negative isolates of the MicrobiotaCOVID cohort
(n = 168, Figure S1).

3.2 Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns

172
173

The antimicrobial susceptibility profile of all Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa isolates (n = 57) was
determined by the EUCAST disk diffusion method (Figure 2, Table S1).

174
175
176
177
178

A high proportion of P. aeruginosa isolates was found to be resistant to the standard-of-care
antibiotics cefepime (FEP, 56.3%), ceftazidime (CAZ, 46.9%), and meropenem (MEM, 50.0%).
P. aeruginosa resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP, 65.6%) was the highest for any of the
relevant drugs tested in this study. Resistance to ciprofloxacin (CIP) was comparatively low in
P. aeruginosa isolates (15.6%).

179
180
181
182
183

Enterobacterales isolates showed likewise resistance to TZP (32.0%), ceftriaxone (CRO, 32.0%), and
CAZ (36.0%). The high resistance of Enterobacterales to amoxicillin/clavulanate (AMC, 72.0%) was not
surprising considering intrinsic (chromosomal) AmpC resistance of E. cloacae, K. aerogenes, and
C. freundii [24]. The Enterobacterales resistance was lower for FEP (8.0%) and
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SXT, 4.0%).

184
185
186
187
188

Disk diffusion further revealed all the P. aeruginosa isolates to be susceptible to gentamicin (GEN),
tobramycin (TOB), and amikacin (AMI). Aminoglycoside susceptibility was also high for the
Enterobacterales isolates with only a single E. coli isolate lacking susceptibility to gentamicin and
tobramycin. This rendered aminoglycosides the most effective drug class in-vitro for the respiratory
clinical isolates studied here, and the only drug class with full coverage of all P. aeruginosa isolates.

189
190
191
192
193

To study the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles in more detail and to test additional antibiotics not
routinely included in the disk diffusion panel, the clinical isolates were also analyzed by broth
microdilution assays to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) (Figure 3, Table S2). For
those drugs tested by both disk diffusion and broth microdilution, the results correlated well between
the two methodologies (Figure S2 and S3).

194
195
196
197
198

Broth microdilution assays confirmed the results of the disk diffusion assay with regards to high
aminoglycoside susceptibility of both P. aeruginosa and Enterobacterales and extended the
aminoglycoside panel by including plazomicin (PLZ) and apramycin (APR). Both PLZ and APR showed
full coverage of Enterobacterales. Apramycin additionally showed full coverage of P. aeruginosa
(Figure 3, Table S2).

3.3 Antibiotic resistance development in P. aeruginosa under antimicrobial selection pressure

205

Next, we analyzed bacterial isolates that were repetitively derived from individual patients to study
changes to antimicrobial susceptibility in response to antibiotic therapy. A decrease in antimicrobial
susceptibility over the course of treatment was particularly pronounced for P. aeruginosa (Figure S4).
This prompted us to select a single P. aeruginosa infection for the analysis of phenotypic and genotypic
changes in response to antibiotic therapy across eight consecutive isolates collected on day 9, 10, 16,
17, 18, 22, 29 and 37 (Figure 4).

consecutive isolates (labeled from 1-8), collected after 9, 10, 16, 17, 18, 22, 29 and 37 days of ICU admission.

Initial isolation of P. aeruginosa from TBS of the patient studied here, occurred on day 4 after ICU
admission (Figure S4, ID 05). After seven days of antibiotic therapy with piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP)
resistance was not only detected against this broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotic/β-lactamase
inhibitor combination, but also against third and fourth generation cephalosporins (CAZ and FEP)
(Figure 4). Consecutively, antibiotic therapy was switched to meropenem (MEM) and subsequent
isolates (isolates 2 and 3) yet again showed susceptibility to TZP and cephalosporins (CAZ and FEP).
After eight days of antibiotic therapy with MEM, repetitive isolates showed resistance to MEM
(isolates 4 to 8) and eventually to TZP as well as extended-spectrum cephalosporins (CAZ and FEP),
indicating a multidrug-resistant gram-negative (MDRGN) infection. After an antibiotic-free period,
therapy with ciprofloxacin (CIP) was initiated and continued for 9 days. Gentamicin was added after
resistance to fluoroquinolones including CIP occurred (Figure 4 and Figure S4, ID 05). Antibiotic
therapy was switched to ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA) for a total of 11 days with P. aeruginosa still
detectable throughout antibiotic treatment. Finally, therapy with inhaled tobramycin (TOB) was
started but stopped again after a total of 6 days, as P. aeruginosa was still detectable and the patient
showed no signs of acute infection, thus indicating colonization of the patient with MDR P. aeruginosa.

227
228
229
230
231
232
233

Finally, we performed whole-genome sequencing of the eight consecutive isolates in an attempt to
detect possible resistance determinants that may explain the phenotypic progression. Whole-genome
analysis indicated that all eight isolates originated from the same clone indeed. The clone was
characterized by two β-lactamases that commonly occur in P. aeruginosa: an OXA-50 like type and
PDC-91. A 1-bp deletion causing a frameshift in the gene encoding the transcriptional regulator NalC
of the mexAB-oprM multidrug efflux pump operon was found in isolates 4 till 8, but was absent in the
first three isolates, providing a rationale for the drop in susceptibility from day 17 onwards (Figure 4).

4. Discussion

236
237
238
239
240

The present study is one of the first microbiological studies to report a detailed antimicrobial
susceptibility profiling of Gram-negative bacterial superinfections in ventilated COVID-19 patients. The
sample size is limited and has a strong geographic bias, but some important conclusions can
nevertheless be drawn and will add to a growing number of similar studies that we expect from other
geographic locations.

241
242
243
244
245
246
247

The etiology found here for late-onset VABP in COVID-19 patients resembles the diversity of Gramnegative pathogens typically found in nosocomial pneumonia [25]. Previous cohort studies have
reported diverse etiology in COVID-19 confirmed cohorts, with A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae, E. coli
and P. aeruginosa as predominant infecting agents [26–28]. The species distribution and resistance
pattern within individual studies may vary depending on the geographic and local ICU etiology of
resistant isolates, study-specific patient recruitment and sample selection, and the treatment history
of prior antibiotic exposure in regular VABP patients and COVID-19 patients.

248
249
250
251
252
253

Besides P. aeruginosa and Enterobacterales, Burkholderia cenocepacia were the third most common
isolates encountered in this study. The latter is regarded a natural colonizer and an opportunistic
pathogen in immune-compromised patients, with a naturally high intrinsic resistance to various
antibiotics [29]. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) is used as a first-line option for the
suppression/control of the infection. Since we only had a small number of B. cenocepacia isolates in
our study, all of which were susceptible to SXT (Table S3), we decided to focus further analysis on only
P. aeruginosa and Enterobacterales.

For the Enterobacterales isolates we found a relatively high level of resistance to TZP, CRO, CAZ, and
AMC. This may be explained by prior selection related to early antibiotic treatment in the course of
COVID-19 infection, since AMC, CRO, and TZP are commonly used in Switzerland as first-line drugs for
nosocomial bacterial pneumonia. Some of the species within the order of Enterobacterales are further
characterized by a chromosomally encoded AmpC β-lactamase, which also contributes to decreased
susceptibility to selected β-lactam antibiotics and in particular AMC [24]. Enterobacterales resistance
to FEP, SXT, MEM and aminoglycosides was low or absent in comparison to the aforementioned
antibiotics. Only a single E. coli isolate (Figure 2 and 3 and Figure S2), showed resistance to gentamicin
and tobramycin, without prior exposure to aminoglycosides in the patient’s treatment regimen.

P. aeruginosa represents a notorious pathogen of nosocomial infections often characterized by MDR,
especially in VABP and cystic fibrosis patients [30,31]. Treatment success is greatly hampered due to
its intrinsic and adaptive resistance to nearly all available antipseudomonal agents. Important
determinants driving resistance in P. aeruginosa are multidrug efflux pumps, alterations to its outer
membrane porins, and the expression of β-lactamases [32]. For the P. aeruginosa isolates analyzed
here, we found very high levels of drug resistance to TZP, FEP, CAZ and MEM.

Importantly, antibiotic resistance levels seemed to increase over the course of antibiotic treatment in
the P. aeruginosa isolates (Figure 4 and Figure S4). Resistance to TZP but also to third- and fourthgeneration cephalosporins (CAZ and FEP, respectively) occurred on day 7 of TZP therapy as reflected
in isolate 1 (Figure 4). This may be attributable to the two β-lactamases (OXA-50 like type and PDC91) which were identified by WGS in all eight isolates from that single infection. The OXA-50 like type
enzyme is a class D β-lactamase, which has a reported narrow hydrolyzing spectrum including

piperacillin but not meropenem [33]. PDC-91 is an inducible AmpC-like β-lactamase conferring
resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins [34]. Surprisingly, we observed a completely susceptible
phenotype in isolates 2 and 3. We hypothesize that these two isolates were colonizing a different
niche in the airway tract, potentially with the formation of a biofilm, which could have limited
antibiotic exposure and resulted in a sensitive phenotype in the disc diffusion assay.

The MexAB-OprM efflux pump is a clinically relevant efflux system in P. aeruginosa [24,35].
Transcription of the corresponding genes is under regulation of MexR, NalC and NalD. Overexpression
of this efflux pump can be induced by mutations in nalC, leading to resistance against β-lactams
(except imipenem) and quinolones but not aminoglycosides [36].

WGS analysis identified a 1-bp deletion in the suppressor gene nalC of isolates 4 – 8, which likely
renders the corresponding protein non-functional and eventually results in over-expression of MexABOprM. Notably, at the same time we observed a gradual to massive decrease in TZP, CAZ, FEP, CIP and
MEM susceptibility in the consecutive isolates (Figure 4), indicating the importance of the nalC
mutation in developing the MDR phenotype of isolate 8. However, imipenem has been described as
unaffected by the MexAB-OprM efflux pump [36]. Hence, the observed resistance to imipenem
(Figure S4, ID 05) may be caused by a different resistance mechanism. In addition, expression levels
of mexAB-oprM or of oxa-485 and pdc-91 have not been tested, therefore the precise correlation of
each drug susceptibility to its resistance mechanism remains to be investigated. Nevertheless, the
detected resistance determinants in combination with the antibiotic treatment history provide a
rational explanation for the emergence of this MDR P. aeruginosa strain.

In the case of pneumonia, a main determinant of antibiotic efficacy is the drug concentration in the
lung parenchyma tissue. Although intravenous aminoglycosides penetrate in lung parenchyma and
bronchial secretions, measured lung tissue concentrations have been found to be relatively low for
some aminoglycosides, because plasma concentrations are kept low in clinical care to avoid systemic
toxicity [37]. While therapy with inhaled aminoglycosides are well described and tolerated in the
treatment of cystic fibrosis, administration of nebulized aminoglycosides in acute pulmonary
infections has largely remained an off-label domain and requires further evaluation [38]. Our results
warrant further exploration of intravenous or inhaled aminoglycosides as a critical component in the
treatment of HAP/VAP with MDR GNB in COVID-19 patients. The drug candidate apramycin, currently
in clinical development, has previously been suggested to have best-in-class coverage of drug-resistant
GNB [20,39–41], which was confirmed for VAP bacterial isolates from COVID-19 superinfections here.

In conclusion, resistance to first-line antibiotics was prevalent in bacterial isolates from ventilated
COVID-19 patients in Switzerland during the first wave of COVID-19. It is conceivable that AMR plays
a key role in those ventilated patients that contract a VABP despite empiric treatment, and contributes
to morbidity and case fatality rates of patients that in addition to COVID-19 treatment are likely to
receive multi-drug regimens of second-line or last-resort antibiotics to control the bacterial infection.
Aminoglycosides have regained interest as potent broad-spectrum antibiotics in the face of β-lactam
and specifically carbapenem resistance, and represent a treatment option less toxic than polymyxins.
In the present study, the aminoglycosides drug class was the only one that was virtually not affected
by resistance.
