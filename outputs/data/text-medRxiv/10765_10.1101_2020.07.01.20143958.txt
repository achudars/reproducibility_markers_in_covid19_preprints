Abstract

41

Background:

42

After the first case of COVID-19 in Japan on 15 January 2020, multiple nationwide

43

COVID-19 clusters were identified by the end of February. The Japanese government

44

focused on mitigating emerging COVID-19 clusters by conducting active nationwide

45

epidemiological surveillance. However, an increasing number of cases appeared until

46

early April, many with unclear infection routes exhibiting no recent history of travel

47

outside Japan. We aimed to evaluate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus

48

2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome sequences from COVID-19 cases until early April and

49

characterise the genealogical networks to demonstrate possible routes of spread in

50

Japan.

51

Methods:

52

Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from patients and a quantitative reverse

53

transcription polymerase chain reaction testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed. Positive

54

RNA samples were subjected whole genome sequencing and a haplotype network

55

analysis was performed.

56

Findings:

57

Some of the primary clusters identified during January and February in Japan directly

58

descended from Wuhan-Hu-1-related isolates in China and other distinct clusters.

59

Clusters were almost contained until mid-March; the haplotype network analysis

60

demonstrated that COVID-19 cases from late March through early April may have caused

61

an additional large cluster related to the outbreak in Europe, leading to additional spread

62

within Japan. National self-restraint during February was effective in mitigating the

63

COVID-19 spread, but late action on stopping immigration and declaring national

64

emergency in Japan might be involved in the later increase in cases.

Introduction

72

The initial coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak occurred in Wuhan, China

73

in late December 2019. It was caused by a new strain of beta coronavirus, known as the

74

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 1-3. After the

75

identification of the first patient with COVID-19 in Japan on 15 January 2020, multiple

76

local COVID-19 clusters were identified nationwide by the end of February. The

77

Japanese government focused on identifying and mitigating emerging COVID-19

78

clusters before they could spread further. In an effort to contain these clusters and limit

79

the number of new cases, active, nationwide epidemiological surveillance of each

80

cluster was conducted in order to identify the close contacts of existing patients with

81

COVID-19. Japan has sustained a moderate spread by focusing on COVID-19 outbreak

82

clusters; however, an ever-increasing number of COVID-19 cases appeared until early

83

April, which made it difficult to identify all infection routes.

84

Although some of the COVID-19 clusters were successfully contained, the number of

85

cases continued to increase. As of 16 April, the Japanese government declared a

86

nationwide state of emergency in view of the worsening spread. To support the ongoing

87

epidemiological surveillance, we collaborated with the local public health institutes in

88

Japan (Supplementary Table S1) and conducted a whole genome sequencing of SARS-

89

CoV-2. Our goal was to apply genomic epidemiology to predict potential routes of

90

infection within or between clusters 4. Thus far, multiple studies have been conducted to

91

demonstrate the COVID-19 spread under nationwide and global comparative genome

92

surveillance; as of 2 June, there were already 33,483 complete genomes publicly

93

available in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) platform 5.

94

Some detailed reports have been conducted to highlight regional specific clusters and its

95

intra- and international spreads in the US 6, UK 7, Hungary 8, Australia 9, Denmark 10,

96

Iceland 11, and California 12

97

In this study, we aimed to evaluate viral genome sequences from COVID-19 cases until

98

early April and characterise the genealogical networks to demonstrate possible routes of

99

spread in Japan.

Ethical approval and consent to participate

102

The study protocol was approved by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Japan

103

(Approval No. 1091). It was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of

104

Helsinki, in compliance with the Law Concerning the Prevention of Infections and

105

Medical Care for Patients of Infections of Japan. The ethical committee waived the need

106

for written consent since the study involved the viral genome sequencing. The personal

107

data related to the clinical information were anonymised, and our procedure is to not

108

request written consent for all patients with COVID-19.

Whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2

118

Whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were obtained by means of the PrimalSeq

119

protocol for enriching the cDNA of the SARS-CoV-2 genome using multiplex RT-PCR,

120

as proposed by the Wellcome Trust ARTIC Network

121

regularly showed low to zero coverage due to primer dimerization as described by

122

Itokawa et al. 16. Therefore, we have modified the ARTIC Network’s protocol for SARS-

123

CoV-2 genome sequencing by replacing some primers for the multiplex PCR 17. The PCR

124

products in pool 1 and 2 from the same clinical sample were pooled, purified, and

125

subjected to Illumina library construction using a QIAseq FX DNA Library Kit (QIAGEN,

126

Hilden Germany). NextSeq 500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA) was used for

127

sequencing the indexed libraries. The next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads were

128

mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome sequence (29.9 kb ss-RNA;

129

GenBank ID: MN908947), resulting in the specimen-specific SARS-CoV-2 genome

15

. We found two amplicons that

131

sequences were assembled using A5-miseq v.20140604 18 to determine the full genome

132

sequence (Supplementary Table S2). The single nucleotide variations (SNV) sites and

133

marked heterogeneity were extracted by the read-mapping at ≥10× depth and from 99 -

134

29796 nt region of Wuhan-Hu-1 genome sequence.

135
136

Comparative genome sequence and SNV analyses

137

The nearly full-length genome sequence (≥ 29 kb) of SARS-CoV-2 was retrieved from

138

the GISAID EpiCoV database in 28 April 2020, followed by multiple alignment using

139

MAFFT v7.222

140

determined that the core regions were from 99 to 29796 nt position against Wuhan-Hu-1

141

genome sequences (GISAID ID, EPI_ISL_402125; GenBank ID, MN908947.3). Gap-

142

containing sequences in the core region were excluded; sequences of 2,887 isolates in

143

GISAID database were eventually used in subsequent analyses (isolate collection by 16

144

April 2020; submitted to GISAID by 27 April 2020; Supplementary Table S3). The

145

genome sequences were aligned using MAFFT software together with sequences

146

retrieved from databases, followed by extraction of SNV sites. The network analysis was

147

performed using TCS 1.21 20.

154

Haplotype Explorer software to visualise the spatiotemporal pattern of SARS-CoV-2

infections based on network graphs (https://github.com/TKSjp/HaplotypeExplorer).

156

Haplotype Explorer allows for the analysis of network graphs spatiotemporally by

157

searching and filtering nodes interactively according to meta-data (e.g., collection date,

158

location, and accession number). Over 100 network graph images were captured daily

Results and Discussion

181

The nearly full-length genome sequences (≥ 29 kb, 2,887 entries) of SARS-CoV-2 were

182

retrieved from the GISAID EpiCoV database (collection by April 16, 2020; submitted by

183

April 27, 2020) 5. We determined the full genome sequences using 435 clinical specimens

184

in Japan collected until April 6, followed by performing a maximum-likelihood (ML)

185

phylogenetic analysis using genome-wide SNVs to trace potential infection routes (Fig.

186

1). After the identification of the first COVID-19 case in Japan on 15 January 2020,

187

multiple local COVID-19 clusters were observed. The genome sequences of Japanese

188

isolates were assigned based on phylogeny to China isolates from late February, but

189

nationwide dissemination seemed to already be present based on the ML phylogeny (Fig.

190

1). At least 4 or 5 main clusters are observed on the ML phylogeny, but this was not

always adequately explained by the field epidemiological studies performed by local

192

public health centres about the patient’s information such as nationality, being a Wuhan

193

returnee, and travel history.

194
195

Although phylogenetic trees are widely used for summarizing genealogies, one should

196

avoid a naïve interpretation of those results since the slow rate of SARS-CoV-2 evolution

197

and sampling bias of genomes could often lead to spurious conclusions

198

199

202
203

Some of the primary clusters identified through January and February in Japan (2 red

204

closed circles and magenta frames in Fig. 2) directly descended from the haplotype which

205

was mostly seen in Wuhan-Hu-1-related isolates from China. Three other distinct clusters

206

(additional 2 red closed circles and yellow frames in Fig. 2) were observed after the first

207

introduction of Chinese isolates. Those four clusters of COVID-19 infections were

208

assumed to be directly originated from the primary wave which occurred in China. Those

209

clusters seemed to have been almost contained through the implementation of active

210

surveillance in Japan until mid-March.

211
212

In contrast, the number of COVID-19 cases increased rapidly across Europe and North

213

America during early March (right half of Fig. 2), indicating a pandemic was occurring.

214

Concurrently, many sporadic COVID-19 cases were detected in Japan from the end of

215

March through early April. The haplotype network analysis demonstrated that an

216

additional large cluster (red closed circles and cyan frames in Fig 2) closely related to the

217

outbreak in Europe (originating in China or other countries) was predominantly observed

218

in Japan during early April, suggesting that they could have caused the increased spread

219

within Japan.

involved in the introduction of specific SARS-CoV-2 lineages, we characterised daily

225

COVID-19 case reports and a mobility index of people inferred from iPhone tracking

226

(Fig. 3B) in Japan, USA, and UK before and after the self-restraint campaign.

227
228

During the primary wave from China, international airports investigated potential patients

229

with COVID-19 using the keywords “Wuhan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and China” in early

230

February (Fig. 3A), and local public health centres were able to identify patients likely to

231

be infected with COVID-19 and their close contacts within location-specific clusters by

232

conducting active epidemiological surveillance. After the end of February, a national self-

233

restraint was requested in Japan, leading to significant reductions in activity observed

234

after the self-restraint was implemented. Although the situation in Japan had begun to

235

improve around mid-March, a large number of new patients with COVID-19 were

236

diagnosed, many of whom with unclear infection routes. Tracing the infection routes was

237

difficult because some Japanese cases had no recent history of travel to China or any other

238

country outside Japan.

239
240

During the national holidays from 20-22 March, a part of the population left their homes

241

to visit the cherry blossoms, which possibly increased mobility (Fig. 3B). It was

242

speculated that such a partial increase in activity at that time might have allowed for a

243

resurgence of the remaining lineage from the first introduction which had previously

244

circulated. The SARS-CoV-2 haplotype network analysis, however, suggested that the

245

second wave of COVID-19 cases in late March had a distinct origin from the first wave

246

lineage. The lineage of the second wave could have been imported by the returnees or

247

travellers from Europe, North America, or other countries

248

frame in Fig. 2), but not by the remaining Wuhan lineage. Considering the increasing

249

COVID-19 cases in Europe and the detection of imported cases in Japan, the Japanese

250

government decided to stop immigration from Europe in 27 March (Fig. 3A).

251
252

On the other hand, increased mobility in the USA and UK continued through early March,

253

possibly leading to a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases from mid-March (Fig. 3B).

254

Intriguingly, activity in the San Francisco Bay area slowed down earlier than in New

255

York; the additional 3 days taken by New York to implement stay-at-home/shelter-in-

256

place orders compared to San Francisco may explain the mitigated COVID-19 spread in

Conclusions

260

This genome surveillance study suggested that at least two distinct SARS-CoV-2

261

introductions from China and other subsequent countries, including some in Europe, were

262

detected. To mitigate the next wave of COVID-19 in Japan, it is necessary to formulate a

263

more efficient containment strategy using real-time genome surveillance supporting

264

epidemiological field investigations and highlight potential infection linkages.

sequences

323

In total, 2,212 SNVs were detected in 3,322 isolates, including Japanese isolates (n = 435).

324

The maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using iqtree version 2.0.5

325

and Wuhan-Hu-1 (GISAID ID: EPI_ISL_402125) as an outgroup reference that is located

326

on the centre point of the radial tree for tree rooting. The geographic and sample

327

information are described in the colour schemes on the outer slot of the phylogenetic tree.

328

The cluster of remarkable outbreaks in Japan are highlighted in bright red.

of worldwide SARS-CoV-2 isolates.

334

A) Whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Japan (n = 435) were compared

335

to all GISAID-available SARS-CoV-2 genomes (n = 2,887, updated on 16 April 2020)

336

using TCS network analysis. SARS-CoV-2 disseminating from Wuhan City, China, at the

337

end of December 2019 (one of the potential origins of Wuhan-Hu-1) is plotted at the

338

centre of the haplotype network. B) Three plots of time-series cumulative COVID-19

339

cases were highlighted in each enclosed square to visualise the increasing incident

340

COVID-19 cases.

347

Solid lines indicate mobility index of people inferred from map application usages given

348

by Apple. Bar plot indicates daily COVID-19 cases. Notably, the data suggests that people

349

in Japan and San Francisco Bay Area collaborated with “stay-at-home” measures from

350

the end of February, which might have significantly reduced the expansion of SARS-

351

CoV-2 infections after late March 2020.
