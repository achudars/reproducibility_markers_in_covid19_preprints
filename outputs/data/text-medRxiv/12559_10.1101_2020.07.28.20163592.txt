Abstract—word count 71
Surrogate neutralization assays for SARS-CoV-2 that can be done without biosafety-

27

level-3 containment and across multiple species are desirable. We evaluate a recently developed

28

surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) in comparison to 90% plaque reduction neutralization

29

tests (PRNT90) in human, canine, cat and hamster sera and found excellent concordance

30

between the two assays. Using a panel of immune sera to other coronaviruses, we confirm the

31

lack of cross reactivity in sVNT and PRNT90 assays.

Introduction—word count (1184)

34

SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in 2019 to cause a pandemic. It is important to detect antibody

35

responses in humans and animals to ascertain evidence of past infection with SARS-CoV-2.

36

Antibody assays that are transferable across species are desirable because SARS-CoV-2 infects

37

pets and other farmed animals (e.g. mink) [1,2,3] and for monitoring antibody responses in

38

experimental animal models [4]. ELISA assays to the virus spike receptor binding domain

39

(RBD) which has least cross-reactive epitopes with other coronaviruses, the whole spike protein

40

or nucleoprotein are widely used for detection of antibody in humans [5,6,7]. Virus

41

neutralization assays are used for confirming positive results but require handling live virus in

42

biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) containment or a pseudotyped virus.

43

ELISA testing for antibody in other animal species requires assays to be re-optimized with the

44

relevant species-specific anti-Ig-conjugate for detecting immunoglobulins of each species. For

45

some species relevant anti-Ig reagents may not be available. The currently available generic

46

alternative has been to use virus neutralization tests which usually involves handling live virus in

47

BSL-3 containment. A “surrogate” virus neutralization test (sVNT ) that can be done in BSL-2

48

containment has recently been reported [8]. It is an assay that relies on competitive inhibition of

49

the interaction of ACE-2 receptor coated on an ELISA plate with horse radish peroxidase

50

labelled virus spike receptor binding domain. We used a panel of sera from patients or animals

51

with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and corresponding controls to evaluate this

52

sVNT assay in comparison to the “gold-standard” PRNT90 test.

Materials and Methods:

54

Sera: Sera (n=43) from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed patients and negative controls (n-42)

55

collected from blood donors in 2017 were used [6]. Dogs (n=4) and a cat with RT-PCR

56

confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included in the study (4). Control dog sera were obtained from a

57

study of canine influenza in 2017 [9] and sera from cats submitted for routine veterinary

58

diagnostic testing in 2020 were used as controls. Hamster sera from experimentally infected

59

hamsters and controls were from a previous study [4].

60

Coronavirus immune sera: Immune sera specific for alphacoronaviruses (porcine respiratory

61

coronavirus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, canine coronavirus and porcine transmissible

62

gastroenteritis virus), betacoronaviruses (SARS-coronavirus) and gamma-coronavirus

63

(infectious bronchitis virus) were obtained from BEI Resources (animal CoV reagents supplied

64

to BEI by Dr Linda Saif (http://www.beiresources.org/About/BEIResources.aspx) or generated

65

by Dr Linda Saif (Table 2). Dr Stanley Perlman provided mouse serum to mouse hepatitis virus

66

(strains A59 and JHM) (Table 1). The homologous antibody titres to the immunising virus were

67

also provided by Dr Linda Saif or Dr Stanley Perlman (Table 2).

68

Serological tests: The SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization test kits were obtained from

69

GeneScript USA, Inc, New Jersey, and the test carried out according to the manufacturer’s

70

instructions. The test sera (60uL), positive or negative controls were diluted at 1:10 and mixed

71

with an equal volume of horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated to SARS-CoV-2 spike

72

receptor binding domain (RBD) and incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C. Then, 100 μL each mix

73

was added to the wells on the microtiter plate coated with ACE-2 receptor, the plate was sealed

74

and incubated at 37°C for 15 minutes. The plates were then washed with wash-solution, tapped

75

dry and 100 μL of 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution was added to each well and

76

incubated in the dark at room temperature for 15 minutes. The reaction was stopped by addition

77

of 50μL of Stop Solution to each well and the absorbance read at 450 nm in an ELISA reader.

78

Assuming the positive and negative controls gave the recommended OD450 values, the %

79

inhibition of each serum was calculated as (1- OD value of the sample / OD value of the negative

80

control) x100. An inhibition of ≥20% is regarded as a positive result while that <20% is negative

81

[8].

SARS-CoV-2 90% plaque reduction neutralization titer was determined as previously described

Ethical statement: Ethical statement: Collection of serum from patients with COVID-19 and

85

healthy blood donor sera in 2017 was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the

86

Kowloon West Cluster reference No. KW/EX-20-039 (144-27) of the Hospital Authority of

87

Hong Kong and the Institutional Review Board of The Hong Kong University and the Hong

88

Kong Island West Cluster of Hospitals (IRB reference number UW16-254), respectively. Canine

89

sera were residual sera from sera collected as part of routine clinical care and the Committee on

90

the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research (CULATR) has waived animal ethics

91

approval. Cat sera were residual sera collected routine diagnosis. The experimental study on

92

hamsters was approved by the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research,

93

The University of Hong Kong (CULATR # 5323-20).

95

Results and Discussion:

96

Human (n=85), dog (n=44), cat (n=20) and hamster (n=5) sera from SARS-CoV-2 infected or

97

controls, with known plaque reduction neutralization titres results, were tested in the sVNT

98

assay. The concordance between the sVNT test and PRNT90 test was 100%, with all 47

99

PRNT90 positive sera also being positive in the sVNT assay while all 107 PRNT90 negative sera

100

were negative in the sVNT (Table 1). Three of 4 sera collected from two RT-PCR positive dogs

101

were positive in both sVNT and PRNT90 assays, the negative serum being an early serum

102

collected from a dog which subsequently seroconverted by both assays. All 37 human sera from

103

RT-PCR confirmed human patients obtained 10 or more days after onset of illness were positive

104

in both assays whereas 3 of 6 sera collected prior to day 10 after illness onset were sero-negative

105

in both assays. The sVNT assay is not meant to be quantitative. However, there was a semi-

106

quantitative relationship between the % inhibition in the sVNT assay and PRNT90 titres

107

(Figure).

108

We investigated cross reactivity of immune sera to a range of alpha, beta and gamma

109

coronaviruses in the sVNT and PRNT90 assays including antisera to feline infectious peritonitis

110

virus, canine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus and SARS-CoV (Table 2). Two human SARS-

111

CoV convalescent plasma samples were also included in this assessment. Cross reactivity in the

112

sVNT assay was only detected with SARS convalescent human plasma (homologous PRNT90

113

titers of 1:160 and 1:320) and with a Guinea pig immune sera to SARS-CoV with a homologous

114

neutralization titer of 1:2,560. Cross reactivity in the SARS-CoV-2 PRNT90 test was only

115

observed with the high titre hyperimmune rabbit sera to SARS-CoV (homologous antibody titer

116

1:640).

117

We found excellent concordance between the sVNT and the “gold-standard” PRNT90 assays for

118

SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection in humans, dogs, cat and hamster sera. It is likely that the

119

sVNT assay can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibody in any species in a highly specific and

120

convenient manner. This assay would be of great utility as a species independent assay for

121

primary testing for SARS-CoV antibodies in humans of animals or for independent confirmation

122

of sera giving positive ELISA antibody results. While there was an overall correlation between

123

PRNT90 titers and % inhibition in the sVNT assay, antibody quantitation of sVNT remains a

124

challenge. We did not compare its performance with pseudo-particle neutralization assays for

125

antibody. The sVNT test has the advantage of technical simplicity, speed, and not requiring cell

126

culture facilities and BSL-3 containment.
