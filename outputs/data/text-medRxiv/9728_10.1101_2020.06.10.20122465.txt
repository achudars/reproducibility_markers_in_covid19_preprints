ABSTRACT

Brain magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) was performed in three consecutive COVID-19
patients, as part of a pilot investigation of the pathophysiological processes underlying the brain involvement
by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. These included one with necrotizing leukoencephalopathy, one after recent
PEA cardiac arrest without leukoencephalopathy, and one without frank encephalopathy or recent severe
hypoxic episode. The MRSI findings were compared to those of two patients with white matter pathology
not SARS-CoV2 infection related, and a control patient without clinical encephalopathy. The N-acetylaspartate reduction, choline elevation, and glutamate/glutamine elevation found in the COVID necrotizing
leukoencephalopathy patient and, to a lesser degree, the COVID post-cardiac arrest patient, follow a similar
pattern as seen with the delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy patient. Lactate elevation was most
pronounced in the patient with COVID necrotizing leukoencephalopathy.

Introduction

Infection with severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) results in COVID-19
(Coronavirus Disease 2019), and declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11,
2020(1). As of early June 2020, millions of people worldwide have been sickened, and hundreds of
thousands have died from this disease. COVID-19 primarily affects the lower respiratory tract, but many
organs can be involved, including the central nervous system(2, 3). Neurological manifestations of SARSCoV-2 infection are increasingly reported and include cerebrovascular complications, leukoencephalopathy,
and other CNS disorders(4). Although COVID-19 associated white matter abnormalities resemble other
forms of diffuse white matter injury (such as post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy or sepsis-associated
leukoencephalopathy), there are also notable differences, such as the neuroanatomical distribution of white
matter lesions. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 white matter abnormalities remains unknown, although
“silent hypoxia” has been hypothesized to have a role in its development(5).

While histopathology remains the reference standard for tissue characterization, MR spectroscopy represents
a non-invasive in-vivo diagnostic tool for evaluating white matter injury and can provide valuable
information regarding the underlying pathogenesis of white matter pathologies. In the setting of diffuse white
matter injury, MRS offers a complementary evaluation to structural MR brain imaging by providing
sensitive measurement of various in-vivo metabolites. Importantly, MRS can identify neurochemical
abnormalities even in the absence of corresponding findings from MR brain imaging(6). Indeed, relatively
specific patterns of metabolic derangements have already been established for several white matter
pathologies(7).

The metabolic profile of COVID-19 associated leukoencephalopathy using MRSI has not been well
established in the literature to date. We present examples of MR spectra in COVID-19 patients and compare
them with both other leukoencephalopathy cases and a control case.

Case series

Six MRSI datasets from three cases with COVID-19 (Figure 1), two control leukoencephalopathy cases
(post-hypoxic and sepsis-related leukoencephalopathy), and one control without encephalopathy were
analyzed with LCModel, and their spectra were compared (Table 1).

Of the COVID-19 cases who had MRSI, one patient had MRI findings compatible with a necrotizing
leukoencephalopathy with abnormal reduced diffusivity and cavitation within the white matter lesions (case

COVID-A) (Figure 1A). The second patient had pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest while in the ICU
and subsequently developed altered mental status. His MRI showed cerebellar cortical and hippocampal signal
abnormalities suggestive of prior hypoxic-ischemic injury and subtle bilateral cerebellar and supratentorial
white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensities (COVID-B) (Figure 1B). The third patient without encephalopathic
syndrome had a history of parkinsonism and developed catatonia of unclear etiology (COVID-C) (Figure

1C). This patient’s MRI showed mild nonspecific periventricular and deep white matter changes suggestive
of small vessel disease (considering their neuroanatomical distribution).

These three cases were contrasted to MRSI data obtained prior to the COVID-19 pandemic from two patients
with other leukoencephalopathies. One patient had delayed post-hypoxic/toxic leukoencephalopathy (DPL)
and developed severe encephalopathy, rigidity, and mutism, likely related to a prior toxic exposure (opiates)
or hypoxic episode (Figure 2A). The other non-COVID-19 patient had sepsis-associated encephalopathy
(SAE) displaying mild diffuse white matter abnormalities on the brain MRI studies (Figure 2B).

Lastly, all five leukoencephalopathy patients were compared to the control case, a 55-year-old male
presenting with paranoid delusions after acetaminophen overdose with a normal neurological exam and
normal liver function tests at the time of the MRI. The control case had mild nonspecific white matter
changes (Figure 2C).

MRSI datasets with short echo time (TE=30ms) were analyzed to quantify ratios of NAA, Cho, mI, and Glx
relative to creatine. Lac/Cr levels were quantified using MRSI datasets with long echo times
(TE=288ms). Table 2 summarizes the means, standard deviations, and percent differences of metabolite
levels to the control case.

Comparative analysis showed decreased NAA/Cr levels within the white matter of all 3 COVID-19 positive
patients compared to the control case. Of note, the patient with necrotizing leukoencephalopathy (COVID-A)
displayed the most diminished NAA levels, which were completely absent in several MRS voxels; followed
by the patient with recent cardiac arrest and mild diffuse white matter changes without necrosis (COVID-B);
followed by the COVID-C case without cardiac arrest or overt leukoencephalopathy (Figure 1). The
metabolic profiles of the 3 COVID-19 patients were contrasted to those of two non-COVID-19 patients with
leukoencephalopathy (described above) (Figure 2). Their NAA/Cr levels were also markedly decreased but
still higher than the COVID-A case (Table 2).

Compared to the control case, two of the three COVID-19 patients had significantly elevated Cho/Cr levels
(Table 2). The third COVID patient without leukoencephalopathy (COVID-C) showed Cho/Cr levels
indistinguishable from those of the control case. The non-COVID-19 patient with DPL and significant white
matter abnormalities showed increased Cho/Cr ratios, while the SAE patient displayed a relatively normal
range of Cho/Cr.

All three COVID-19 patients and the non-COVID-19 patient with DPL showed slightly elevated myoinositol/Cr (mI/Cr) levels (Table 2). Interestingly, our patient with sepsis-associated encephalopathy had
decreased levels of mI/Cr. Glutamate + glutamine/Cr was markedly increased in the two COVID-19 patients
with leukoencephalopathy and after cardiac arrest as well as in the non-COVID-19 patient with DPL. Lac/Cr
ratios were increased in the COVID-19 patient with necrotizing leukoencephalopathy on long TE spectra. No
significant elevation of Lac/Cr ratios was seen in the SAE case. The DPL and control cases did not have long
TE spectra, however, the short TE spectrum suggest the presence of lactate in the DPL case (Figure 2A).

Discussion

Multiple recent reports in the medical literature have confirmed the development of leukoencephalopathy as
a potential CNS complication in SARS-CoV-2 infection(8, 9), although no study to date has reported the MR
spectroscopic findings in these patients. We evaluated the metabolic differences between patients with
COVID-19 leukoencephalopathy, COVID-19 patients with relatively mild white matter involvement without
a clear leukoencephalopathy, and other control groups to better understand the underlying pathophysiology
of this disease. Markedly increased Cho/Cr, decreased NAA/Cr, and increased Lac/Cr ratios were observed
in one COVID-19 patient with multifocal necrotizing leukoencephalopathy. Less pronounced changes in
Cho/Cr and NAA/Cr ratios were noted in another COVID-19 case with prior PEA arrest and subtle
nonspecific white matter signal abnormalities. Notably, the magnitude of the choline and NAA abnormalities
in the patient with necrotizing leukoencephalopathy was more pronounced when compared to non-COVID19 patients with delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy and sepsis-associated encephalopathy. In the
setting of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the NAA/Cr ratios showed an inverse relationship, and the Cho/Cr ratios
showed a positive relationship to the extent of observed white matter abnormalities.

In our series, similar patterns of metabolic changes were observed in the setting of COVID-19 associated
leukoencephalopathy and delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy, namely elevated choline, elevated
lactate, decreased N-acetyl-aspartate, increased myo-Inositol, and increased Glx ratios in relation to creatine.
This spectral pattern has been previously reported in the setting of DPL following carbon monoxide
poisoning or medication overdose(10-12). Prolonged impaired oxygenation to the subcortical white matter is
thought to promote anaerobic metabolism and leads to elevated tissue lactate(11, 12).

Choline is a membrane marker in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes(13). The observed increase of Cho/Cr
ratio in leukoencephalopathy cases, particularly in the case of COVID-19 associated necrotizing
leukoencephalopathy, likely reflects demyelination within these white matter lesions as recently described in
the first neuropathological study of a patient with COVID-19(14). Some choline elevation could be related to
immune cellular infiltration within areas of demyelination(15). Axonal damage was also reported on

pathology(14) and likely contributes to the decreased NAA/Cr ratios we observed, as NAA is considered a
marker of neuronal and axonal integrity(16, 17).

Increased levels of myo-Inositol may reflect neuroinflammation, which when coupled with choline
elevations in demyelinating pathologies may reflect glial proliferation(16). The presence of elevated Glx
levels has been reported in cases of acute excitotoxic leukoencephalopathy(18) and viral-associated acute
leukoencephalopathy with restricted diffusion (AESD)(19). Both conditions are thought to be mediated by
excitotoxic injury to the cerebral white matter and exhibit prominent reduced diffusivity within white matter
lesions.

Notably, the metabolic derangements seen in the setting of COVID-19 associated multifocal necrotizing
leukoencephalopathy were more pronounced in our study than those observed with DPL. This finding raises
the possibility of an additional or alternative underlying mechanism, other than the above-described hypoxiadriven process, contributing to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 associated leukoencephalopathy. Also, while
based on a small sample size, our findings suggest that the metabolic changes in patients with SARS-CoV-2
infection increase with worsening white matter changes on conventional anatomic imaging. However, more
evidence is required to validate this conclusion.

Our study's small patient cohort limits our ability to generalize our observations. MRSI was only obtained in
patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection when requested by referring providers for specific clinical indications.

In conclusion, the reported spectroscopic abnormalities within the white matter lesions of COVID-19
associated leukoencephalopathy may reflect several pathophysiological processes, including but not limited
to: 1) an anaerobic metabolic environment produced by the well-described "silent hypoxia" seen in these
patients resulting in elevation of lactate levels; 2) neuronal dysfunction and axonal injury with decreased
NAA/Cr ratios; and, 3) increased membrane destruction or turnover with elevated Cho/Cr ratios. Other
factors, in addition to hypoxia, might also be involved considering the magnitude of metabolite ratio changes
we observed in these patients. Continued data collection in a larger cohort is required to validate these
observations and better elucidate their significance in the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
