ABSTRACT
Objective: As a consequence of the health crisis arising from the SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus pandemic, ozone treatments are being applied as disinfectant in
emergency vehicles, without objective evidence on its efficacy. Here we evaluate the
efficacy of ozone treatment over bacterial strains and virus-like particles.
Method: A preparation of a lentiviral vector (lentivector) and dried cultures of two
bacterial strains (gram + Staphylococcus aureus and gram - Salmonella enterica ser.
Enteritidis) were placed inside an ambulance at two different locations. The interior of
the vehicle was subjected to 10 min and 20 min treatments (3 and 6 times the
recommended time by the manufacturer). Following the treatments, lentivector
preparations were titrated, and viable bacteria (colony forming units, CFUs) counted
and compared to pre-treatment titers and infectious CFUs of the same lysates and
cultures.

Results: None of the treatments significantly reduced either lentivector titer or the
number of viable bacteria.

Conclusions: At least in the analyzed conditions and for the microorganisms used in
this study, it can be concluded that ozone treatment is not advisable for the disinfection
of emergency vehicles.

INTRODUCCIÓN
As a consequence of the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 the disinfection of
emergency vehicles has become a priority, as this is the main transport means of
infected patients. Therefore, these vehicles can be a potential source for new
infections of patients not related to SARS-CoV-2 infections.
The different governmental organizations, emergency services and private transport
companies of biomedical materials are putting in place several measures for
disinfecting vehicles. Ozone cannons are currently the most used method for
disinfecting the surfaces of vehicles, due to their rapid and straightforward application.
Ozone is an oxidizing gas with a demonstrated disinfecting capacity in aqueous
solutions, and it is widely used for disinfecting food and water (1-4). However, its
efficacy to disinfect surfaces by nebulization has not been properly tested. Therefore,
the Spanish Ministery of Health does not include ozone in the list of authorized
virucides

for

disinfecting

surfaces

(https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCovChina/documentos/Listado_virucidas.pdf).
Here we have tested the efficacy of ozone disinfection using ozone cannons as
currently applied in ambulances. To this end, we have studied its efficacy in reducing
the viability of three model microorganisms: a lentivector and two bacterial pathogens
(Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella entérica). Lentivectors are virus-like particles
(VLPs) that can be used as a biosafe model to evaluate disinfectant over viral
infectious agents. Coronaviruses contain a single-stranded RNA genome packaged
by the nucleoprotein, which is in turn enclosed in a membrane envelope containing
the S, M and E proteins (5). HIV-1-derived lentivectors show a similar structure to
SARS-CoV-2, containing a transfer single-stranded RNA packaged by the
nucleocapsid, capsid and matrix proteins, enclosed in a membrane envelope
containing the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) (6). Lentivectors can be
used as transfer vehicles of reporter genes such as GFP into susceptible cells, which
allows the quantification of infectious viral particles by evaluating GFP expression.
Lentivectors cannot propagate in cell cultures, so they represent a biosafe model
agent for RNA viruses such as SARS.
In addition, these treatments have also been proposed to as broad spectrum
disinfectants. Hence, our study has also tested the capacities of ozone treatments

over two model bacterial pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus y Salmonella enterica.
These gram-positive and gram-negative strains are recomended by American (EPA)
and European (EN) norms (7) (8) for the evaluation of the efficacy of disinfecting
treatments over surfaces.

METHODS
The pSIN-GFP lentivector was prepared by the three-plasmid co-transfection method
as previously described. This lentivector encodes the GFP gene under the control of
the SFFV promoter (9). Lentivector preparations were titrated in 293T cell cultures as
described by Selden et al. (10). Staphylococcus aureus strain MW2 (S. aureus MW2)
(11) and Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis strain 3934 (S. Enteritidis 3934) (12) were
grown overnight in TSB and LB medium at 37ºC in shakers (200 rpm), respectively.
Then, 1 ml of cultures were retrieved by centrifugation, washed in PBS thrice and
resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. 25 µl droplets of bacteria suspensions were air-dried in
Petri dishes under sterile conditions.
A medicalized ambulance of 10,79 m3 was used for testing ozone treatments. Ozone
was produced with an ozone cannon (Industrial Global Supply S.L.) with a production
capacity of 16000 mg/h. The ozone cannon was placed on the floor, and the
production cannon oriented towards the stretcher (Figure 1). Open petri dishes
containing 1 ml of the pSIN-GFP lentivector stock in DMEM and containing dried
bacterial cultures were placed on the stretcher at two different locations. A “proximal”
location next to the ozone cannon, and a “distal” location from the ozone cannot
(Figure 1). Ozone levels inside the ambulance were monitored using a Dräger Pac
8000. The ambient humidity was also measured with a hygrometer (ThermoPro)
(Figure 1). Two different treatments were carried out, differing in duration (10 and 20
min), following the specifications provided by the manufacturer of the ozone cannon,
by calculating the exposure time as a function of the target volume (0,3 min/m3 in
emergency vehicles). 3,23 min would suffice for the complete disinfection of the
ambulance used for this study according to these specifications.

Position of the ozone cannon within the ambulance. The ozometer was placed in the
upper shelves as shown in the picture. The picture shows the moment in which the
ozometer shows ozone levels superior than 10 parts per million (ppm), indicating the
saturation of the ozometer and the warning lights. The hygrometer was introduced in
the ambulance before and after the tests to register the humidity range during the
experiments.
Accordingly, 10 and 20-min treatments correspond to a 3 and 6-fold increase in the
recomended treatment time, respectively.
The lentivector stocks were immediately titrated following the treatments by
transducing cultures of 293T cells (5x105 cells). Three days later, the number of
lentivector infectious units were calculated by examining the proportion of GFP
positive cells by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, following published
procedures (10); (9). Mean and standard deviations were calculated from four
independent quantifications for each experiment at the two different locations. Data
was compared to the same untreated lentivector stocks.
Bacterial cultures were rehydrated after the treatments in 100 µl PBS and the number
of viable cells was calculated and compared to untreated bacterial samples.
Quantifications were carried out by 10-fold serial dilutions of each simple, and
performing cell counts in triplicates. Means and standard deviations were calculated
from three independent bacterial cultures.

As a control, UV-C light was used as a disinfectant agent, which is demonstrated to
be efficacious for disinfecting surfaces (13-16). Hence, open Petri dishes containing 1
ml of pSIN-GFP lentivector stock in DMEM as well as Petri dishes with desiccated
bacterial cultures were located in the interior of a laminar flow cell culture cabinet and
subjected to UV-C irradiation for 20 min (TUV 30W, 100W/cm2 at 1 m). Lentivector
titres and bacterial counts were performed as described above.

RESULTS
During the test, ozone levels higher than 10 ppm were reached within the ambulance
for both 10 and 20-min treatments (Figure 1). The humidity during the experiments
ranged from 37 to 48% (Figure 1). Ozone treatments barely affected the lentivector
titres (Figure 2 and 3). Independently of the time and location from the ozone cannon,
the differences were always inferior to a logarithm (10-1) (Figure 3). In contrast, the UV
light treatment reduced the lentiector titre below the detection limit of the titration
technique (< 5000 partículas/ml), reaching at least 4 logs reduction in lentivector titre
(Figures 2 y 3).

Importantly, no significant effects over the viability of bacterial samples were observed.
The decrease in viable cells did not reach have a log for S. aureus MW2 and 1,4 logs

These assays were repeated independently twice at different days, with equivalent
results.

DISCUSSION
Here we have used a lentivector preparation as a biosafe substitutive model for
infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions to evaluate the disinfecting capacities of nebulized
ozone. Lentivector particles share structural features that make them good candidates
for infectious single-stranded RNA viruses such as coronaviruses. Lentivector
preparations contain VLPs with packaged single-stranded RNA, protected with the
nucleocapsid, capsid and matrix proteins, enveloped in a lipid membrane containing
the VSV-G glycoprotein. In analogy, coronavirus particles are similar in size (100 nm

diameter), with a single-stranded RNA genome packaged by the nucleoprotein. In turn,
the viral nucleocapsid in enclosed within a lipid membrane in which the S, M and E
proteins are incorporated. Due to the same chemical composition of their genomes
(single-stranded RNA), we could hypothesize that both organisms as similarly
susceptible to UV light and other oxidazing agents.
Guidelines of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, United States of America)
(7) and the European Guidelines (EN-14885) reccomend a decrease superior than 3
logs and 5-6 logs for viruses and bacteria, respectively, for a disinfecting treatment to
be considered efficacious by nebulization in hospitals. None of the two ozone
treatments significantly reduced the lentivector titer (Figures 2 and 3), or S. aureus
MW2 and S. Enteritidis 3934 bacterial counts (Figure 4). Therefore, these treatments
cannot be considered effective for disinfecting contaminated surfaces in ambulances,
in the tested conditions. Interestingly, the location of the samples from the ozone
cannon did not influence the results, without significant reduction in lentivector
treatments or bacterial counts (Figures 3 y 4).
The evidence from our study shows that gaseous ozone treatments currently applied
in emergency vehicles do not significantly affect virus or bacteria viability. It has been
previously shown virucide activities of gaseous ozone in surfaces at concentrations
higher than 20-25 ppm in the presence of relative humidity higher than 90% (17). In
our present study, we have quantified ozone concentrations higher than10 ppm,
although we cannot discard that superior concentrations may have been reached as
the upper detection limit of the ozometer is 10 ppm. Relative humidity at the time of
the experiments ranged from 37% to 48%, which may have influenced the efficacy of
the treatment. Nevertheless, it has to be remarked that these humidity levels
correspond to those normally found within the vehicle, without using humidifyiers. The
ozone is rapidly decomposed into highly oxidative OH radicals in the presence of
water, while it is more stable in air. This difference in stability could explain the
differences in efficacy found in water compared to nebulization.
Although we cannot discard that prolonged treatments with higher ozone
concentrations may show some disinfecting capacities, our data indicates that the
current treatments in emergency vehicles are insufficient. Therefore, we cannot
recommend their use for this end.
