ABSTRACT
Background​: COVID-19 is a respiratory disease transmitted through respiratory droplets with a high
transmission rate. There’s still no effective and approved antiretroviral treatment or vaccine, thus,
preventive measures are the main key to contain this pandemic. Portugal is now in phase 3.2 of the
mitigation of COVID-19, being imperative to understand the health literacy of our country and how to
prevent the lack of information, through community empowerment.
Material and methods​: A cross-sectional study with a cohort from a primary care facility was conducted.
We collected demographic and epidemiological data and carried out a questionnaire by phone call.
Descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests were used to assess associations between the independent
variables and the level of health literacy. The level of significance was set at p<0.05.
Results​: Our cohort includes 222 subjects (median age: 62 years old), mostly females (131),
undergraduate (193) and with at least one risk factor for COVID-19 (144). Globally, younger individuals,
females, graduates and the Non-Risk Group appear to have higher levels of health literacy, with some
exceptions to this pattern.
Conclusions​: We observe a well-informed population. However, being a pandemic situation, we intend to
identify and correct outliers/misconceptions. This work allows a perspective of the current state/pattern of
health literacy as well as its possible predictors. Furthermore, this study makes aware of how relevant the
specific communication approaches are. Further studies to understand the predictors of health literacy are
necessary.
Key-Words​: COVID-19, pandemic, SARS-CoV2, Portugal, Health literacy.

1. INTRODUCTION
In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia with unknown etiology began to arise in the city of Wuhan,
China and the diagnosis of influenza and other Coronaviruses (such as MERS and SARS) were
considered but later excluded by laboratory tests​1,2​. On 7​th of January, 2020, China announced that the
cause of that epidemic was a new Coronavirus strain, later designated SARS-CoV-2 and proven to be
present in wild bats​2,3,4​.
The transmission mode of SARS-nCoV-2 is through respiratory droplets, and they are either a source of
direct or indirect contamination​5,6​. This strain presented a basic reproduction number (R0) within a range
from 1.4 to 6.5: the highest infection rates in the elderly or in people with underlying pathologies​2,7​.
Therefore, this means that this strain of virus has a high rate of human-to-human transmission and a
person is much more contagious as more symptomatic​6,8​.
The median age of the symptomatic patients seems to be between 47-59 years even though it can affect
individuals of all ages​2​.
The clinical presentation of COVID-19 has a wide spectrum that ranges from assymptomatic or slightly
upper respiratory infection to septic shock​6,9,10​.
The cardinal symptoms described by the World Health Organization and later integrated in the flowcharts
issued by the Direção Geral de Saúde (DGS) are “cough”, “fever” and “dyspnea”. However, other studies
report myalgia, fatigue, headache and gastrointestinal symptoms as other symptoms to be taken into
account​11,12,14​. In a study involving 1099 laboratory confirmed cases, Zhong ​et al described that the most
common clinical manifestations were fever (88.7%), cough (67.8%) and fatigue (38.1%), with sputum,
dyspnea, sore throat and headache also being highly reported by the patients​13​. This study also mentions
that there was a minor percentage of patients who showed gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting
and diarrhea.
Despite the broad spectrum of the disease, Huang ​et al d
​ escribed that the elderly or those with underlying
pathologies such as hypertension, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Diabetes Mellitus and
cardiovascular diseases had a faster progression of the disease, with a higher rate of Acute Respiratory
Distress Syndrome, consequent multiorgan failure and higher rate of death​2,10​. These pathologies,
considered as risk factors for COVID-19, were later included in the “Norma de Orientação Clínica
004/2020” of DGS, as patients with a particular risk of infection and with higher care needs.
At the moment, there is no effective and approved antiretroviral treatment or vaccine targeting
SARS-CoV-2, with the treatment being mainly symptomatic and organ support​6,10​.
Therefore, in the absence of effective specific treatment, there is a range of preventive measures to be
taken, such as a correct handwashing, respiratory etiquette, disinfection of surfaces and social isolation
and/or social distancing (> 2 meters)​2,3,6,14​. These measures are assumed as vital in the control of the
mitigation of the pandemic​3,14​.
To raise public awareness of these measures and health promotion, community empowerment is
necessary and the main key for this public health problem. This empowerment through health literacy
programs and official campaigns using television, radio and other media has a positive impact, especially
in this actual context - outbreaks and/or pandemics​15-17​.
On the 18​th of March, 2020, the State of Emergency was decreed in Portugal, with a Law Decree
regulating preventive measures to contain the pandemic mitigation in Portugal. On the 26​th of March,
2020, phase 3.2 of the mitigation of COVID-19’s pandemic in Portugal was declared, e.g., chains of
community transmission of the virus in the national territory. Thereupon, it arose the need for tighter
control and application of preventive measures.
Regarding the positive impact of official campaigns and community empowerment with a strong health
literacy, we considered it extremely important to study the health literacy of the population in this
mitigation phase, in order to understand the flaws that may still exist as well as identifying possible
predictors of health literacy concerning this matter. Thus, and since as far as we’re concerned this is the
first study focusing on this subject, it will be possible to rectify possible wrong ideas through specific

intervention strategies aimed at different populations. Also, we hope that this study helps to identify
possible errors/flaws of health literacy in a pandemic situation and to avoid them at the early beginning of
a possible future pandemic.

2. MATERIAL AND METHODS
Subjects and Data Collection
We conducted this cross-sectional study with a cohort of 222 subjects, with an age greater or equal to 15
years old - to avoid a misunderstanding bias of our questionnaire - COVID-19’s Questionnaire
(Supplementary Information).
We excluded subjects codified with the ICP-2 codes for “dementia”, “mental retardation” or “presbycusis”,
- to exclude the inherent misunderstanding bias.
We selected a cohort: individuals with a scheduled medical appointment in a primary care facility of
Unidade Local de Saúde de Nordeste between 1st and 8th of April.
We collected the demographic and epidemiological data (age, gender, education level and risk factor(s)
for COVID-19 codified by ICP-2) and carried out COVID-19’s Questionnaire by phone call with
simultaneous registration of the data, between March 30 and April 3.
Statistical Analysis
For statistical analysis, we regarded “Age” as a continuous variable. Concerning the other variables, we
categorized subjects according to their “Gender” (“Female” and “Male”); Education (“Undergraduate
Group” - <4 years of schooling; 4, 6, 9 or 12 years of schooling; “Graduate Group” - Graduate, Master’s
Degree and/or Doctorate); “Risk factor(s) for COVID-19 codified by ICP-2” (“Risk Group” - presence - and
“Non-risk Group” - absence - as described in “Norma de Orientação Clínica 004/2020” by Direção Geral
de Saúde (DGS) such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Asthma, Cardiac Insufficiency,
Diabetes Mellitus, Chronic Liver Disease, Chronic Renal Disease, Ative Malignant Neoplasm or
Immunosuppression State).
We performed the statistical analysis of the collected data using Microsoft Office Excel 2019​® (Microsoft,
Redmond, Washington, USA) and the SPSS​® statistical package (standard version 22.0; SPSS, Chicago,
IL, USA). Exploratory analysis was conducted to demographically characterize our cohort as well as for
the answers given for each question of our questionnaire.
We used non-parametric tests (Kruskal Wallis H and Fisher’s Exact Test) to test whether significant
associations between the variables and the answers given were observed or not, except for the last
question.
The level of significance for all statistical tests was set at p<0.05, with a 95% confidence interval.
This study was submitted for approval and approved by the Direction of Department of Primary Health
Care of Unidade Local de Saúde do Nordeste, according to the Declaration of Helsinki of the World
Medical Association. The confidentiality of the data was guaranteed, only accessible by the main
investigator and the respective authors.

This study comprises a cohort of 222 subjects, with an age range 15-94 years old and a median age of 62
years old. The majority registered an undergraduate level of education and had at least one risk factor for
COVID-19 codified by ICP-2 (Table 1).

Globally, younger individuals, females, graduates and the Non-Risk Group presented higher relative
frequencies of the correct answer along COVID-19’s Questionnaire. However, three exceptions were
observed: the Undergraduate Group and the Risk-Group had a high relative frequency stating that
COVID-19 has a cure and in mentioning “Social Isolation” as an important preventive measure to adopt
when compared to the Graduate Group and the Non-Risk Group, respectively. Males have higher relative
frequency in answering the correct number of SNS24 and in stating that children can get sick and transmit
the infection by SARS-CoV-2 when compared to females (Table 2 - Supplementary information).
The use of Non-parametric tests (Kruskal Wallis H and Fisher’s Exact Test) demonstrated several
statistically significant associations between our variables and the answers given along COVID-19’s
Questionnaire (Table 3).

3.2.1. QUESTIONS REGARDING THE COURSE OF COVID-19
When questioned about the symptomatology of COVID-19, 96.85% of individuals stated that they know
the symptoms of COVID-19. Indeed​, ​analysing only the 215 individuals who answered “Yes” in the first

question, we observe that most of the individuals stated the cardinal symptoms of COVID-19 described in
several “Normas de Orientação Clínica” from DGS (e.g. “Fever”, “Cough” and “Dyspnea”) in relative
frequencies >70.00% and that 36.28% stated “Other” symptoms such as “myalgia”, “headache” and “loss
of smell and taste”. Nonparametric tests denote statistically significant associations: “Other” reveal a
significant association with “Education”, with individuals of Graduate Group stating more often other
symptoms of the disease; “Cough” reveal a significant association with “Risk Factor”, with individuals from
Non-Risk Group stating more often this symptom.
When questioned whether COVID-19 only affects old people or not, 90.99% of individuals answered the
correct answer. Nonparametric tests reveal a statistically significant association regarding variable
“Gender”, with females answering more often the correct answer.
Regarding the two questions about children, there’s a good level of health literacy among our cohort.
When questioned if children can get sick, there’s a major dominance of the answer “Yes” (88.74%).
Nonparametric tests reveal a statistically significant association regarding variable “Risk Factor”, with
individuals from “Non-Risk Group” stating more often the correct answer.
When we questioned about the possibility of children transmitting the disease, 83.78% of individuals
answered “Yes”. No statistically significant associations were observed.
Regarding the question about the cure of COVID-19, we found a great dispersion of the answers: 41.44%
of the subjects refer that COVID-19 has a cure, 33.33% deny it and 25.23% refer that they don’t know
whereas this disease has a cure or not. Nonparametric tests reveal a statistically significant association
regarding variable “Education” and “Risk Factor”, with individuals from “Undergraduate Group” and “Risk
Group” stating more often the correct answer.
3.2.2. PROCEDURE IN CASE OF SUSPECT OF COVID-19 AND PREVENTIVE MEASURES
When questioned about the correct procedure in case they have symptoms compatible with COVID-19,
77.48% stated they should “Stay home and call SNS 24”. Nonparametric tests reveal a statistically
significant association regarding variable “Age”, “Gender” and “Risk Factor”, with younger individuals,
females and individuals from Risk-Group stating more often the correct answer.
Regarding the number of SNS 24, only 24.77% of subjects knew the correct number. Nonparametric tests
reveal a statistically significant association regarding variable “Gender” and “Risk Factor”, with males and
individuals from Non-Risk Group answering the correct number.
When questioned about the preventive measures to adopt, 77.93% of individuals stated “Social Isolation”,
50.90% stated “Other” preventive measures (e.g., the use of gloves, the use of mask, distance >2 meters
from other people, leaving shoes at front door,...), 45.50% of individuals refer “Washing hands” and lastly,
only 8 subjects (3.60%) of all subjects mention “Respiratory Etiquette” as an important measure to adopt.
Nonparametric tests demonstrate several statistically significant associations: “Other” has a statistically
significant association with variable “Risk Factor” - individuals from “Non-Risk Group” state this symptom
more often - and “Social Isolation” has a statistically significant association with “Education” and “Risk
Factor” - individuals from “Graduate Group” and “Risk Group” state this preventive measure more often.
Regarding the use of gloves, a great dispersion of answers was observed, with 56.31% of individuals
referring that the use of gloves does not always prevent the infection by the new Coronavirus, 13.51%
affirming “I don’t know” and 30.18% answering “Yes”. Nonparametric tests demonstrate that variables
“Gender” and “Risk Factor” have a statistically significant association with the answers given, with
females and individuals from “Non-Risk Group” answering correctly more often.
Regarding the use of masks, a great dispersion of answers was observed, with 59.91% of individuals
referring that the use of gloves does not always prevent the infection by the new Coronavirus, 15.32%
affirming “I don’t know” and 24.77% answering “Yes”. Nonparametric tests show a statistically significant

association between variables “Risk Factor” for this question, with individuals from “Non-Risk Group”
answering correctly more often.
When we questioned our subjects about the possibility of visits of friends and/or family during social
isolation, 83.33% stated “No”, 12.16% stated “Yes” and 4.5% affirmed “I don’t know”. ​Nonparametric tests
show no statistically significant associations.
3.2.3. SOURCE OF INFORMATION
Regarding the final question, and even though we have a slight dispersion of frequencies of answers, it is
obvious that the major source of information about COVID-19 is the television, with 74.77% of individuals
reporting that fact. After television, the social networks (10.36%) and other (4.50%) - such as official
websites (WHO, DGS and CDC), employers, Town Hall and Guarda Nacional Republicana - have an
important role in informing the population about the actual public health problem (Fig. 1).

Figure 1 - Absolute and relative frequencies of answers for the fourteenth question.

4. DISCUSSION
According to Portugal's censuses, the population of our cohort comprises 23850 citizens, with a
proportion >1 female per male and as well as an undergraduate and older population​18,19​. The
characterization of our cohort is compatible with these data.
Globally, our results demonstrate a relatively well informed population. Furthermore, females, younger
individuals, the “Graduate” and the Non-Risk Groups presented higher relative frequencies of the correct
answer throughout our questionnaire. There are some exceptions to this pattern, which we are going to
discuss later on this section.

In the literature, several studies support our results, reporting age, gender and education as predictors of
health literacy. Indeed, Sørensen ​et al in their comparative study of the results of European Health
Literacy survey (HLS-EU) ​reported education, age and gender as predictors of low health literacy, along
with social status and financial privation. According to their findings, males and older individuals tend to
have slightly lower health literacy, while a higher level of education is a strong positive predictor of health
literacy​20​. Besides, regarding health literacy, several other studies state these gender, age and education
significant differences, reporting that an increase in age, being male and lower levels of education usually
implies a decrease in health literacy​,21- 27​.
Regarding the presence/absence of risk factors for COVID-19 as far as we’re concerned, there’s no
literature available to support the results found in our study. However, we do know that the median age of
the Risk Group is higher than the median age of the Non-Risk Group and these differences stated in
non-parametric tests along this study may be a consequence of an age bias.
Concerning the symptomatology, most of the population knows the cardinal symptoms of COVID-19
related by DGS (high relative frequencies >70.00%). Curiously, even though not being reported by DGS,
there’s a significant percentage of subjects relating. “Other” symptoms such as “myalgia”, “headache” and
“loss of taste and smell”, described in several articles​10,12,13,14,28​. This fact may suggest that people do not
obtain their information by a single source of information and that they try to search for relevant
information.
The third question was thus constructed to capture the discord underlying the definition of “cure”.
According to Portuguese lexicon, “cure” is defined as “act or effect of self-healing or healing somebody” or
“health recovery” and “healing” being described as “restore health”. However, the answers given along
the phone calls highlighted the uncertainty in this definition, emphasizing the insecurity in answering this
question. Indeed, throughout this study, most of the people who answered “No”, justified using sentences
such as “there’s no vaccine” or “there’s not a medication targeting the virus”. These findings underline
some incongruences and misconceptions. A vaccine is a tertiary preventive measure administered in an
individual to confer immunity to a certain infectious disease, which enables an asymptomatic/mild clinical
manifestation of it, useful in controlling epidemics​29-31​. Therefore, it is necessary to demystify the idea that
a vaccine is a cure for an infectious disease. Even though there’s not a specific antiretroviral targeting
SARS-CoV-2 efficiently approved, there are several reported cases of healed patients, matching with the
Portuguese definition of “cure”​6,10,28,32​. Interestingly, the Undergraduate Group presents a higher relative
frequency of the answer “Yes”, yet, it wasn’t possible to find any information in literature supporting this
finding.
Regarding the preventive measures to adopt face to COVID-19, overall, the subjects in our study were
able to mention them, with the exception of Respiratory Etiquette. In the literature there are several
studies that report the importance of handwashing, respiratory etiquette and social isolation in containing
epidemics and in controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission​28,33​. Indeed, even though Chao Yang reports that
there’s no proven efficacy of handwashing in controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission​34​, there are several
findings that report the opposite. Qing-Xia et al​, in a study involving 7 countries, alert to the fact that
handwashing significantly slows the exponential spread of SARS-CoV-2​35 and several other studies
showed that a correct handwashing is useful in controlling epidemics as well as SARS transmission​21,35,36​.
Even though handwashing is an important preventive measure to adopt face to COVID-19, unfortunately,
there are findings that show that the correct procedure - as recommended by WHO - isn’t always applied
and that some mistakes are observed, as such low frequency in washing hands and not washing hands
the enough time​37,38​. Also, Zhang ​et al conducted a study in Beijing’s population as a post-pandemic
assessment and verified that even though people knew the importance of handwashing, they did not
apply it​14​. In their study, Fung ​et al a
​ lso observed a decline of practice of this preventive measure​14​.
Therefore, in order to avoid this decline and errors, we must implement methods to successfully achieve a
correct preventive handwashing​39​.

As well as for other respiratory viruses, respiratory etiquette has a preponderant role in controlling the
transmission of an infectious respiratory disease​40-42​. Looking at the numbers in our study, the absolute
and relative frequencies of subjects who mentioned it as a necessary preventive measure was
disappointingly low. Thus, this must be a point to improve in health literacy.
Concerning “Social Isolation”, being SARS-CoV-2 an extremely high contagious virus, an effective and
important preventive measure to adopt and to contain the pandemic is social isolation​6, 43​. Interestingly
and contrary to the other questions, in this question the Risk Group has a higher relative frequency of the
preventive measure “Social Isolation'' than the Non-Risk Group. This fact may be explained by the fact
that Non-Risk Group is a younger group. Thus, younger people belong to the proletariat more than older
people, having the necessity to leave home for work, which can be a justification to this finding. Regarding
the answers obtained in question 7, there are still cases of people who believe it is possible to receive or
visit family and/or friends at home. Since this idea may promote the creation of new transmission chains,
it is necessary to demystify it, across every single outlier.
Regarding the right procedure in case of having symptoms, most of the subjects stated that they must
stay at home and call SNS 24, as recommended by DGS. Concerning the number of SNS 24,
interestingly, males report higher relative frequency of the right answer. This may be explained by the fact
that in our population, males have higher rates of education with more educational opportunities​19​.
Recalling that the Graduate Group has a higher relative frequency of correct answers, this difference
between females and males may be explained by this bias. Also, along the phone calls, individuals that
belong to the Risk Group - overall, older individuals - referred that they didn’t know the number by heart
because their caregivers knew or they had it pointed on a paper. Besides suggesting the lower capacity of
older people to memorize numbers, this draws our attention for the important role that caregivers may
have in transmitting the proper information to older people.
Regarding the questions about the epidemiology of COVID-19, there’s a major consensus that this
disease affects the elderly and that children either transmit and can get sick. Indeed, concerning all the
information already mentioned, the literature states that SARS-CoV-2 may infect individuals of all age
ranges, with a more severe clinical manifestation in the elderly and/or people with underlying pathologies​6,
10, 44​
. Also, concerning the clinical manifestation and transmission in children, throughout this study, some
people reported that “children can transmit the virus, that’s why grandchildren and grandparents cannot
be together”. Indeed, children can get sick and are an important vector of transmission of
SARS-CoV-2​6,10​. This fact is especially because if infected they are mainly asymptomatic and have more
difficulties in applying the correct procedures of the hygiene measures correctly​45,​. Interestingly, males
reported higher relative frequencies than females in stating that children can get sick and transmit
SARS-CoV-2. However, there’s no literature supporting this finding.
Regarding the use of gloves and/or masks, it is visible a certain hesitation and some myths associated
with them, which may be explained by the quantity of contradictory information transmitted concerning
these equipment​46​. The use of gloves is recommended during procedures associated with aerosol
production, in a clinical context​46​. Regarding the global use of gloves, its general use is not recommended
by WHO, CDC and DGS and may even constitute a false security if people don’t discard them regarding
the proper procedure​47​. The use of masks has been under constant study since the beginning of this
pandemic, in order to understand whether it prevents the infection by SARS-CoV-2 or not and the
literature regarding this matter is very controversial. However, in a recent study, Greenhalgh et al
advocate the general use of the mask, regardless of their material, even stating that a simple cotton mask
will reduce the amount of transmitted virus by 36 times​48​. Indeed, masks are gaining a major role as a
community preventive measure and not as an individual preventive measure​35,44,48,49,50.
Concluding, even though we observe a relatively well informed population, this is a pandemic of a virus
with an elevated Transmission Rate. Thus, biological characteristics as well as individual and
communitary behaviours have an impact in its course​10,14,20 and even a single error/mistake may have a

negative impact, creating new transmission chains that could have been prevented​32,33,43,44,62​. Following
this thought, we are looking for the outliers of wrong answers/unfamiliarity of a concept and in order to
promote a fruitful health literacy, towards an informed population and avoid an overwhelming unjustified
panic, which may lead to more mistakes​51,52,53​.
To pursue this objective, we must take in account the major sources of information and adapt our
communication, creating programs/methods in order to reach each specific population​54​. This adjustment
to different realities has a positive impact on the population and their behaviour, by promoting community
empowerment​55​.
On a final note, we safeguard that a correct health literacy does not always mean a correct behaviour and
that some mistakes can still prevail​53,54​.

5. CONCLUSION
Health literacy is nowadays a critical issue and has an impact in controlling epidemics and
pandemics​56,57,58​.
In Portugal we are now in phase 3.2 of mitigation of COVID-19’s pandemic and, even though we have a
relatively well informed population, there seems to be some misconceptions of the guidelines​57​. As the
actual public health situation is a pandemic by a highly infectious virus, every single deviant compliance
matters and must be prevented. Thus, our goals were to characterize the population regarding their
COVID-19’s health literacy, in order to help create specific intervention strategies aimed at populations
with different levels of health literacy.
Although our cohort has a small dimension, it highlights some aspects that can bridge gaps that still
remain. We believe it also provides support for future studies and alerts to the necessity of new
approaches of communication in order to control not only this pandemic but also possible future
pandemics with human-to-human transmission.
The main limitation of this work was the size of the database. Also, besides comparison between groups,
other tests or applying metrics could have been used, e.g., correlation coefficients such as Spearman’s
rank and Pearson’s. Also, a multinomial regression could have been carried out in order to predict the
health literacy for an individual. Likewise, a new index variable representing health literacy could have
been created, in order to state the level of health literacy of an individual. In further studies, this new
variable can be created based on WHO and DGS information, enabling a comparative study of various
coefficients, considering criteria and quality adjustment metrics.
