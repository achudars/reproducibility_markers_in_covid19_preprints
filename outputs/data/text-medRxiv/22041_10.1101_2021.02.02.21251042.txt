Abstract
Objectives
To estimate the prevalence of unpaid caregiving during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic, and to identify factors associated with adverse mental health symptoms, substance
use, and suicidal ideation in this population, which provides critical support in health care
systems by providing care to older adults and those with chronic conditions.
Methods
In June 2020, Internet-based surveys with questions about demographics, caregiving
responsibilities, and mental health were administered to US adults aged ≥18 years. Demographic
quota sampling and survey weighting to improve cross-sectional sample representativeness of
age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Prevalence ratios for adverse mental health symptoms were
estimated using multivariable Poisson regressions.
Results
Of 9,896 eligible invited adults, 5,412 (54.7%) completed surveys; 5,011 (92.6%) respondents
met screening criteria and were analysed, including 1,362 (27.2%) caregivers. Caregivers had
higher prevalences of adverse mental health symptoms than non-caregivers, including anxiety or
depressive disorder symptoms (57.6% vs 21.5%, respectively, p<0.0001) having recently
seriously considered suicide (33.4% vs 3.7%, p<0.0001). Symptoms were more common among
caregivers who were young vs older adults (e.g., aged 18–24 vs ≥65 years, aPR 2.75, 95% CI
1.95–3.88, p<0.0001), Hispanic or Latino vs non-Hispanic White (1.14, 1.04–1.25, p=0.0044),
living with vs without disabilities (1.18, 1.10–1.26, p<0.0001), and with moderate and high vs
low Caregiver Intensity Index scores (2.31, 1.65–3.23; 2.81, 2.00–3.94; both p<0.0001). Suicidal

ideation was more prevalent among non-Hispanic Black vs non-Hispanic White caregivers (1.48,
1.15–1.90, p=0.0022).
Conclusions
Caregivers, who accounted for one in four US adult respondents in this nationally representative
sample, more commonly reported adverse mental health symptoms than non-caregivers.
Increased visibility of and access to mental health care resources are urgently needed to address
mental health challenges of caregiving.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been associated with mental health challenges
related to the morbidity and mortality caused by the disease and its mitigation. Early studies have
documented elevated levels of adverse mental health symptoms in the United States1,2 and
around the globe3,4 compared with previous years. Young adults and unpaid caregivers for adults
(caregivers) are among highly affected populations.
A pre-pandemic meta-analysis found that caregivers, who perform activities such as assisting
others with activities of daily living and medical tasks, experienced higher levels of depression
and perceived stress and lower levels of general well-being than non-caregivers.5 Subsequent
studies have characterized an association between subjective caregiver burden and depressive
symptoms,6 which in some cases limited provision of care.7
During June 2020, caregivers reported significantly higher prevalence of adverse mental and
behavioural health symptoms than non-caregivers, including symptoms of an anxiety disorder,
depressive disorder, or COVID-19-related trauma- and stressor-related disorder (TSRD), having
started or increased substance use to cope with the pandemic, and suicidal ideation.1 A study of
1,459 paediatric and adult brain tumour patients and 530 caregivers in 33 countries found that
caregivers were significantly more anxious than patients, and 42.8% of caregivers felt that their
caregiver burden has significantly increased during the pandemic.8
Caregivers represent a significant demographic in the United States. In 2020, the prepandemic estimated prevalence of caregivers was 19.2% of adults aged ≥18 years, or 47.9
million Americans.9 This estimate represents an increase in caregivers of more than eight million

compared to 2015.10 Some people may have taken up unplanned caregiving roles during the
pandemic due to mobility restrictions related to community mitigation activities designed to
reduce potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 for older adults. Moreover, others who were
providing care before the pandemic may have faced barriers and disruptions to their routines and
livelihood. Both scenarios require caregivers to make sacrifices to care for others during a time
when their own lives may have been disrupted.
Addressing the needs of the disproportionately affected population of caregivers is critically
important for the health and well-being of caregivers and the persons for whom they provide
care. To effectively address these needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and afterwards, studies
are needed to determine the prevalence and characteristics of caregivers, and to identify stressors
that may be targets for support systems and prevention and intervention efforts. This study aims
to estimate the prevalence and characteristics of US caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic,
and to evaluate factors associated with differences in mental and behavioural health symptoms.
Methods
Study design and participants
To assess mental and behavioural health among adults aged ≥18 years with residence in the
United States who had provided unpaid care for adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, we
conducted a cross-sectional analysis of an Internet-based survey study conducted during June
24–30, 2020 for The COVID-19 Outbreak Public Evaluation (COPE) Initiative. Surveys were
administered by Qualtrics, LLC (Provo, Utah, and Seattle, Washington, US), a commercial
survey company with a network of participant pools consisting of hundreds of suppliers. Further
details on Qualtrics recruitment and methodology are provided in the appendix (p 1).

Participants included both first-time respondents and respondents who had completed a
related survey during April 2–8, May 5–12, 2020, or both intervals. Demographic quota
sampling was used to recruit respondents based on population estimates for age, gender, race,
and ethnicity based on the 2010 US Census. Potential respondents likely to qualify based on
demographic characteristics listed in their Qualtrics panellist profile were targeted during
recruitment; demographic questions were then included in the survey to determine their
eligibility. Potential respondents received invitations and could opt to participate by activating a
survey link directing them to the participant information and consent page preceding the survey.
Ineligible respondents who did not meet inclusion criteria (e.g., age <18 years, not a US resident)
or exceeded set quotas (i.e., maximum demographic characteristic quota already met) were not
empanelled in the survey.
Survey instrument
The survey instruments included individual questions, validated questionnaires, and COVID19-specific questionnaires used to assess respondent attitudes, behaviours, and beliefs related to
COVID-19 and its mitigation, along with mental and behavioural health consequences of the
COVID-19 pandemic.
Demographic variables included gender, categorized age, combined race/ethnicity, disability
status, marital status, household occupancy, 2019 household income, US Census region,
urban/rural classification using self-reported ZIP codes, employment status, and, among
employed respondents, self-identified essential worker status and weekly paid work hours.
Caregiving variables included the method by which caregivers provided care (in-person in-home
only; in-person out-of-home only; virtually only; and both in-person and virtually), the person
for whom they were providing care, weekly unpaid caregiving hours, caregiver experience in

months, and caregiving intensity assessed using the 12- or 14-item ARCHANGELS Caregiver
Intensity Index (CII; see appendix (p 1) for additional details), which is composed of three
subscales: Caregiver Load based on four items (situation stability, impact on expenses, family
strife, and preparedness), Caregiver Impacts based on four items (emotional state, work, personal
time, and stress), and Caregiver Buffers based on six items (support, insurance knowledge, selfefficacy, financial knowledge, sense of purpose, and employer support). Caregivers who were
also employed completed all 14 items, while those who were not employed completed all items
except for the work and employer support items. The sum of items in each subscale is
normalized from 0–100, and the normalized sum of the three subscales is used to categorize total
CII scores as Low (0–25), Moderate (26–55), or High (≥56).
Symptoms of anxiety or depression were assessed via the four-item Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ-4), a clinically validated screening instrument.11 Symptoms of COVID-19related trauma- and stressor-related disorder (COVID-19 TSRD) were assessed via the six-item
Impact of Event Scale (IES-6) to screen for overlapping symptoms of posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder (ASD), and adjustment disorders (ADs).12 Respondents
also reported whether they had started or increased substance use, (e.g., alcohol, drugs) to cope
with stress or emotions related to COVID-19, or if they had seriously considered trying to kill
themselves in the prior 30 days. See appendix (pp 1–2) for additional details.
Quality screening
All surveys underwent Qualtrics, LLC standard data quality screening procedures, and a
secondary cleaning conducted by the investigators; see appendix (p 2). Respondents who failed
an attention or speed check, along with any responses that failed data quality screening
procedures, were excluded from the analysis.

Statistical analysis
Iterative proportional fitting and weight trimming (0.3≤weight≤3.0) were employed to
improve the cross-sectional sample representativeness of the 2010 US population by age, gender,
and combined race/ethnicity (appendix p 2). The statistical analyses were completed in four
phases. The first phase included bivariate analyses and described demographic characteristics of
caregivers and non-caregivers, as well as mental and behavioural health, overall and by
demographic variables, among caregivers and non-caregivers. The second phase described
mental and behavioural health symptoms among caregivers, overall and by both demographic
variables and caregiving characteristics. For comparisons between (demographics, group
prevalences of adverse mental and behavioural health symptoms) and among (prevalences of
adverse mental or behavioural health symptoms by demographics) caregivers and noncaregivers, Rao-Scott adjusted Pearson chi-squared tests were used to test for differences in
observed and expected frequencies among groups by characteristic with a Bonferroni adjustment
and evaluated at a significance level of α = 0.05. The third phase included adjusted prevalence
ratios (aPRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for adverse mental and behavioural health
symptoms among caregivers estimated using Poisson regressions with robust standard errors
evaluated at a significance level of α = 0.05. Finally, in the fourth phase, non-parametric
Spearman correlations were calculated between individual CII items and mental and behavioural
health measures to assess the relative association of each item with adverse mental and
behavioural health. All statistical analyses were conducted using Python (version 3.7.8; Python
Software Foundation) and using R software (version 4.0.2; The R Foundation) with the R survey
package (version 3.29).

The Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee reviewed and approved the study
protocol (ID #24036). This activity was also reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent
with applicable federal law and CDC policy (45 CFR part 46, 21 CFR part 56; 42 USC Sect
241(d); 5 USC Sect 552a; 44 USC Sect 3501 et seq). All participants provided informed
electronic consent prior to study commencement. Investigators received anonymised responses.
Results
Of 9,896 eligible invited adults, 5,412 (54.7%) completed Internet-based surveys during June
24–30, 2020, including 3,638 (68.1%) first-time respondents and 1,729 (31.9%) respondents who
first completed a survey for The COPE Initiative during April 2–8, 2020. Among the 5,412
respondents, 5,011 (92.6%) met secondary screening criteria and were included in this analysis
(Figure 1). These 5,011 respondents included 1,362 (27.2%) caregivers and 3,649 (72.8%) noncaregivers (Table 1). There was not a significant difference in caregiver status by gender or 2019
household income, though compared to non-caregivers, caregivers were significantly more
commonly of young age (e.g., 18–24 years=26.6% vs 8.0%, respectively, group p<0.0001) and
either Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity (Black=18.8% vs 9.7%; Hispanic=29.0% vs 11.6%, group
p<0.0001). White respondents accounted for 44.5% of caregivers and 70.8% of non-caregivers.
Caregivers also more commonly reported living with a disability than not (37.9% vs 17.0%,
p<0.0001), and, among employed caregivers, essential than nonessential worker status (73.7% vs
47.8%, p<0.0001) (Table 1).
Adverse mental and behavioural health symptoms were more prevalent among caregivers
than non-caregivers (symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorder=57.6% vs 21.5%, respectively;
symptoms of a COVID-19-related TSRD=49.0% vs 17.9%; having started or increased substance

these symptoms=69.6% vs 31.0%; all p<0.0001) (Tables 2,3).
Among caregivers, adverse mental and behavioural health symptoms were most prevalent
among those aged 18–24 years (e.g., at least one symptom, vs those aged ≥65 years; 88.5% vs
18.8%, group p<0.0001), and were more prevalent among Black and Hispanic caregivers than
White caregivers (80.2% and 89.4%, respectively, vs 53.4%, group p<0.0001) and among those
with than those without disabilities (85.8% vs 59.8%, p<0.0001) (Table 2). There were also
differences by employment status, as caregivers who were employed (76.1%) or students
(79.0%) had higher prevalences of adverse mental and behavioural health symptoms than those
who were retired (29.9%) or unemployed (59.3%) (group p<0.0001). Among employed
caregivers, adverse mental and behavioural health symptoms were more common among
essential than nonessential workers (81.6% vs 60.6%, p<0.0001), and were most prevalent
among those who worked >60 hours in the previous week and decreased with weekly work hours
(e.g., vs those who worked ≤20 hours; 96.9% vs 59.3%, group p<0.0001). There were also
differences by caregiving characteristics; 93.0% of 126 caregivers providing care to multiple
types of relationships reported adverse mental or behavioural health symptoms, compared with
55.6% of 261 caregivers providing care for a parent or parent-in-law (group p<0.0001).
Similarly, 89.0% of 370 who had been providing care for 4–6 months, compared with 44.7% of
199 caregivers who had been providing care for more than 12 months (group p<0.0001) (Table
4). There were also difference by CII score; 91.1% of 335 caregivers with high CII scores
reported at least one adverse mental or behavioural health symptom, compared with 20.7% of 31
caregivers with low CII scores (group p<0.0001).

Adjusted prevalence ratios for select demographic and caregiving variables associated with
significantly different prevalences of symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorder, suicidal
ideation, and at least one adverse mental or behavioural health symptom, are shown in Figure 2.
Among demographic variables, adjusted prevalence of adverse mental health symptoms was
higher among young caregivers aged 18–24 years vs caregivers aged 45–64 years (e.g., anxiety
or depressive disorder symptoms, aPR 1.47, 95% CI 1.21–1.79, p=0.0001; suicidal ideation,
1.88, 1.26–2.82, p=0.0023; at least one of these symptoms, 1.48, 1.28–1.71, p<0.0001) and those
with vs without disabilities (1.22, 1.10–1.35, p=0.0002; 2.01, 1.65–2.46, p<0.0001; 1.18, 1.10–
1.26, p<0.0001, respectively). Suicidal ideation was more prevalent among Black vs White
caregivers (1.48, 1.15–1.90, p=0.0022), as was at least one of these symptoms among Hispanic
vs White caregivers (1.14, 1.04–1.25, p=0.0044). Conversely, adjusted prevalence of adverse
mental health symptoms was significantly lower among older adults aged ≥65 years vs
caregivers aged 45–64 years (e.g., at least one adverse mental health symptom, 0.54, 0.39–0.74,
p=0.0002).
Among caregiving variables, adjusted prevalence of adverse mental health symptoms was
higher among caregivers with ≤12 vs those with >12 months of experience (anxiety or depressive
disorder symptoms, 1.24, 1.06–1.44, p=0.0059; suicidal ideation, 1.75, 1.27–2.41, p=0.0006; at
least one of these symptoms, 1.25, 1.12–1.40, p=0.0001), those with >6- vs ≤6-hour weekly
caregiving commitment (1.34, 1.16–1.56, p=0.0001; 1.58, 1.19–2.11, p=0.0018; 1.19, 1.07–1.31,
p=0.0009, respectively), and, compared with those in the low-intensity CII group, those in the
moderate-intensity (2.52, 1.61–3.94, p<0.0001; 1.92, 0.95–3.88, p=0.070; 2.30, 1.64–3.23,
p<0.0001, respectively) and high-intensity (3.34, 2.12–5.26, p<0.0001; 2.91, 1.43–5.93,

In the exploratory analysis of the correlation of individual CII items with adverse mental and
behavioural health symptoms, the strongest average positive correlations among all adverse
symptoms were observed for employment absenteeism (ρs between 0.36 and 0.46, all p<0.0001),
preparedness (ρs between 0.25 and 0.45, all p <0.0001), resentment (ρs between 0.30 and 0.40,
all p<0.0001), impact on expenses (ρs between 0.26 and 0.45, all p <0.0001), and family strife
(ρs between 0.24 and 0.42, all p<0.0001) (Table 5). The strongest average negative correlation
was observed for sense of purpose (ρs between -0.11 and -0.22, all p ≤0.0002). All correlations
were in the expected direction based on their subscale categorization, except for employer
support, which had a positive correlation with all adverse mental or behavioural health symptoms
(ρs between 0.16 and 0.26, all p <0.0001) despite being in the Buffer subscale.

Discussion
More than one quarter (1,362 [27.2%]) of 5,011 US adult respondents identified as unpaid
caregivers for adults in the three months preceding the survey in June 2020. This estimated
prevalence of caregivers in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic represents an
increase over the 19.2% estimate based on data collected in 2019,9 which may reflect an impact
of the pandemic on caregivers and recipients of care. Overall, 7 in 10 (948 of 1,362 [69.6%])
caregivers reported having experienced at least one adverse mental or behavioural health
symptom. More than half of caregivers screened positive for symptoms of an anxiety or
depressive disorder (785 [57.2%]), and more than one-third reported having started or increased
substance use to cope with the stress or emotions related to COVID-19 (477 [35.0%]) and
seriously considered suicide in the prior month (454 [33.4%]). Caregivers reported having
experienced elevated levels of adverse mental and behavioural health symptoms compared to
non-caregivers in this study, including three-fold increased prevalences of symptoms of anxiety

or depressive disorder or a COVID-19-related TSRD, six-fold increased prevalence of having
started or increased substance use to cope with the pandemic, and nine-fold increased prevalence
of caregivers having seriously considered suicide compared to non-caregivers.
Both caregivers and non-caregivers who were young, Black, Hispanic, living with disabilities,
essential workers, and working long hours had disproportionately high levels of adverse mental
health, consistent with findings during the pandemic.13-16 However, caregivers more commonly
identified as members of these at-risk populations than non-caregivers, with more than twothirds (928 [68.1%]) of caregivers aged below 45 years, more than half (756 [55.5%]) nonWhite, more than one-third living with disabilities (516 [37.9%]), and nearly three-quarters of
caregivers employed as essential workers (751 of 1,018 [73.7%]), adding additional potential
stressors to their caregiving responsibilities. Long work hours, which were also common among
employed caregivers, are associated with increased odds of adverse health outcomes, including
depression, anxiety, and impaired sleep,17 an effect that may be exacerbated by caregiving
responsibilities outside of work. Committing long hours to paid work and unpaid care limits
opportunities for core elements of health, including sleeping, exercising, eating, socializing, and
medical care. Among caregivers, those who provide care for more hours and those who had been
caregiving for fewer than 12 months had higher prevalences of adverse mental health symptoms,
which may reflect stressors from being forced into a caregiving role, starting as a caregiver
during the pandemic, or survival bias, whereby those who are still providing care after 12 months
are more resilient to stressors associated with the role.
The findings in this report reveal that unpaid caregiving for adults is common, has likely
increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, and is represented broadly across demographics.
Further, the report underscores the significant impact associated with caregiving on mental and

behavioural health and highlights the compounding impact of intersectionality with those who
identify in multiple groups having elevated experiences of adverse mental and behavioural
health. Addressing mental health among caregivers represents an urgent unmet medical need,
and targeted interventions and communication strategies are needed to increase awareness of,
comfort with, and access to resources for diagnosis and treatment of mental and behavioural
health symptoms, especially given the time constraints faced by caregivers, many of whom are
also employed. Effective communication strategies may include promoting recognition of
caregivers so that they feel seen,18 addressing stigma associated with mental healthcare,19-21
along with continuing to expand telehealth,22 which has delivered promising results in treatment
for mental health conditions, including depression, substance use disorder, and suicidal
ideation.23 However, telehealth may not address all needs, with barriers to access (i.e., lack of
Internet access) and limitations to provision of some care. Campaigns to increase help-seeking
behaviour may also be beneficial, as caregivers more commonly avoided medical care due to
concerns about COVID-19,24 which may be related to their own perceived risk of SARS-CoV-2
infection, to their perceived risk and grief about potentially infecting the person for whom they
are caring, or both.
The COVID-19 pandemic both introduced new challenges (e.g., barriers to in-person care
provision, COVID-19 concerns) and exacerbated the challenges (e.g., financial strains)
associated with caregiving that existed before the pandemic. Therefore, prevention efforts and
cultural changes may be required both during and beyond the pandemic to properly address the
factors associated with caregiving that contribute to elevated experiences of adverse mental
health. This is of increasing importance to the economy, as even before the expected impact of
COVID-19, a 2015 study estimated the value of unpaid caregiver labour to be USD$470

billion.25 It is also important to note that the impact of caregiving does not end with the death of
the loved ones. Pre-pandemic research highlighted that approximately 20% of bereaved
caregivers experience psychiatric symptoms, including depression and/or complicated grief
following the passing of their loved ones.26 Given the high prevalence of employed caregivers
and its compounding mental health impact, reducing the stigma that can be associated with
caregiver status and establishing visible and easily accessible workplace programs should be
prioritized. Employee Assistance Programs, Workplace Health Promotion Programs,
personalized flexible work arrangements, and expanded options for leave that may reduce
caregiving intensity if effectively utilized.27 Assistive technologies may also decrease workloads
required from caregivers, though may inadvertently increase the load if mismanaged or
improperly designed.28 Beyond these institutional changes, given the protective benefit of a
caregiver’s sense of purpose and evidence that self-esteem and positive aspects of caregiving are
associated with improved mental health,29 creating a culture that more openly celebrates
caregivers and their efforts may lead to communities of caregivers that reduce the mental health
risks associated with social disconnectedness and isolation.30-32
Strengths of this study include recruitment of a large sample of unpaid caregivers from a
nationally representative sample of U.S. adults and utilization of validated screening instruments
for mental health. This paper is subject limitations, which may include the following. First,
unpaid caregivers for adults were self-identified, and caregiver status for children or adolescents
were not assessed; future research should assess mental health among multigenerational
caregivers. Second, a diagnostic evaluation for anxiety disorder or depressive disorder was not
conducted; however, clinically validated screening instruments were used to assess symptoms.
Third, substance use was self-reported; therefore, responses might be subject to recall, response,

and social desirability biases. Fourth, the novel nature of the ARCHANGELS Caregiver
Intensity Index and the specific use within this research precludes exact comparisons with
normative data on caregiving intensity before the pandemic. Finally, the Internet-based survey
may not be fully representative of the 2020 U.S. population and may therefore have limited
generalizability. However, standardized and supplementary quality and data inclusion screening
procedures were applied, and the prevalence of symptoms of anxiety disorder and depressive
disorder were largely consistent with findings from the Household Pulse Survey during June.14
Further characterization of caregivers and assessment of mental health, substance use, and
suicidal ideation will be required to determine the extent to which increased prevalence of
caregiving and elevated adverse mental and behavioural health symptoms progress over the
course of the pandemic and beyond. Investment in support systems that reflect the diverse
caregiving population and improves their ability to provide care will improve societal health and
well-being during this critical health crisis and beyond.
