Abstract
Objective: This research aimed to systematically review and summarize the influence of ReninAngiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) inhibitors on the outcome of COVID_19 patients with
hypertension.
Methods: Electronic databases; PubMed/Medline, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials, clinical trial.gov, and Google Scholar were searched from 2019 to June 1,
2020. Additionally, the references of identified articles were also searched.
Results: A total of 9 articles comprising 3,823 patients were incorporated; 1416 patients on
RAAS inhibitors and 3469 on non-RAAS inhibitors. The study demonstrated that the taking of
RAAS inhibitors in COVID_19 patients with hypertension significantly reduced mortality where
patients on RAAS inhibitors had a 27% decrease of mortality (RR= 0.73 [95% CI: 0.63- 0.85,
p<0.0001, I2=0%, random-effects model]) compared to those not taking ACEI/ARB. No
significant association were observed in disease severity (RR= 0.92 (95% CI: 0.74- 1.14) and
hospitalization (WMD= -2.33[95% CI: -5.60, 0.75]), random-effects model.
Conclusion: This study supports RAAS inhibitors’ safe use among COVID_19 patients with
hypertension.

Background
Corona viral diseases 2019 (COVID_19) is a pandemic disease originated from Wuhan city of,
China from December 2019 1. The pandemic has continued to debilitate global health and the
economy. As of June 7, 2020; 7,005,822 cases of COVID_19 were reported, including 402,678
deaths worldwide 2. Severe COVID_19 illnesses have consistently been observed in patients
with Comorbid illnesses such as cardiovascular and diabetes mellitus 3. According to the report
of the Chinese CDC as of February 11, 2020, 10.5% of deaths occurred in COVID_19 patients
with cardiovascular diseases and, 6% of them were patients with hypertension 3.
Most patients with cardiovascular disease use RAAS inhibitors; commonly angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) 4. They are a drug of
choice for heart failure, hypertension, chronic kidney disease and, myocardial infraction5, 6.
Besides inhibition of the formation of angiotensin II; RAAS inhibitors increase the expression of
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); a membrane-bound aminopeptidase that is expressed
abundantly in the lungs and the heart 7. ACE2 plays an important role in the breakdown of
angiotensin II (a potent vasoconstrictor) to angiotensin (1-7) (a vasodilator)8 which helpful in
cardiovascular patients.
Researches

reported that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)

attacks the humans cells through ACE29, 10, and reduces ACE2 expression, resulting imbalance
of ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis and ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor

11, 12

. Therefore; there are

concerns about the use of RAAS inhibitors as a result of an increase in expression of ACE2; a
target molecule for SARS CoV-213-15. This led to the hypothesis that the use of RAAS inhibitors
might be harmful in patient with COVID_19 especially in patients with comorbidity like

hypertension. There are retrospective studies conducted to test this hypothesis and one metaanalysis (preprint)summarized the studies in all patients taking RAAS inhibitors

16

. The meta-

analysis included 1842 COVID_19 patients and exhibited a significant 43 % decrease in
mortality on the side of patients taking ACEI/ARB

16

. After the meta-analysis several studies

were conducted which requires updating the evidence and also there is a need for evidence on
hypertensive patients. This study aimed to systematically synthesis the evidence on the effect of
RAAS inhibitors on the outcome of COVID_19 patients with hypertension.
Methods
Study design
This is a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted using electronic database searches. The
review conducted according to the preferred reporting items for Systematic Review and MetaAnalysis Protocol (PRISMA)

17

. The protocol was registered in the (Prospero) International

Prospective Register of a systematic review with registration number CDR42020186477.
Search strategy
The databases such as PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of controlled trials, clinical
trial.gov, CINAHIL, and Google scholar were searched from 2019 to June 1, 2020. Additionally,
the references of identified articles were also searched. No language limitation was employed.
Flow diagram was used to summarize the number of studies identified, screened, excluded, and
finally included in the study. Search terms for PubMed were attached under the supplementary
document (Appendix 1).

Study selection
Two reviewers (TB and TS) independently carried out searching for literature and identified
relevant studies and sequentially screened their titles and abstracts for eligibility. The full texts of
eligible studies were retrieved. Differences in the inclusion of articles were fixed on discussion
with the third author (SD). A screening guide was used to ensure that all review authors applied
the selection criteria.
Inclusion criteria
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including cluster RCTs, observational studies, and
prospective, retrospective comparative cohort studies and case-control studies were considered to
be included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The review considered all patients who
were taking ACEI or ARBs alone or in combination for hypertension with COVID-19 patients.
Exclusion criteria
In vitro studies, studies not related to ARB or ACEI for COVID-19 patients with hypertension,
studies without extractable data, outcome (death), or severity or hospitalization not clearly
reported were excluded from the review.
Methodological quality assessment
Selected papers were evaluated by two reviewers (TB & TS) for methodological validity before
inclusion in the review with the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment score (NOS) method. Any
differences that arose from the reviewers were fixed through discussion, with a third reviewer
(SD).

Data extraction
Two reviewers (TB and TS) extracted data from the studies using a pre-designed format. Data
extracted include first author, the region of study, included population, study design, number of
study participants, comparator group, patient status, severity, age (mean, median), gender,
interventions, and patients outcomes (number of cases).
Data analysis and statistical methods
Data analysis was performed by RevMan 5.4 (Copenhagen: the Cochrane Collaboration, 2020)
and Stata version 13 (StataCorp, 2013). Risk ratios were used for comparison and reported as
95% confidence interval. P-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The Q-statistic
test was used to assess the heterogeneity of the included study and I2 statistic was used to indicate
the percentage of variation in the studies as a result of heterogeneity instead of chance.
Results
A total of 608 articles were identified through searching of electronic databases, out of this 554
remained after removing duplications. After screening in title and abstract 112 articles remained;
of which 105 articles (review articles and letters to editors) were excluded. Finally, 9 articles
were included for meta-analysis

18-26

(Fig 1). A total number of 3,823 patients were included;

1416 patients on RAAS inhibitors and 3469 on non-RAAS inhibitors (Fig 2). Newcastle-Ottawa
Scale methodological quality assessment gave the quality of the included studies in good
arrangement (Appendix 2).

Effect of RAASI on disease severity
Nine studies reported the severity data of the hypertensive COVID-19 patients. No significant
association was observed with RAAS inhibitors on severity; RR=0.92 (95% CI: 0.74-1.14),
random effect model. Significant heterogeneity was observed among the studies (I2 = =64%,
P=0.005) Fig.2.

Effect of RAAS inhibitors on mortality of patients with COVID_19 and hypertension
Seven studies reported the mortality data of the hypertensive COVID_19 patients. No
heterogeneity was observed among the 7 studies (I2 = 0%, P=0.59). The pooled mortality was
RR= 0.73 (95% CI: 0.63- 0.85), fixed effect model Fig. 3.

Figure 3: Forest plot for mortality of patients taking RAAS inhibitors compared to not taking
RAAS inhibitors
The use of RAAS inhibitor did not have association with long term hospitalization as compared
with non RAAS inhibitor users (weighed mean difference -2.33[95% CI: -5.60, 0.75], fixed
effect model. No heterogeneity was observed (I2=0%, P=0.65), Fig 4.

Assessment of bias
The funnel plot was used to assess the publication bias. Funnel plot indicates the existence of
small study effects. We performed the regression–based on Egger’s test. The funnel plot was
symmetrical in shape for severity and mortality (Fig 5 and 6), indicating no publication bias.

Regression-based Egger’s test indicates that there were no small-study effects on mortality
(P=0.122) and severe events (p = 0.686).

Discussion
Concern over the safety of RAAS inhibitors use in patients contracted COVID_19 originated
since SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 receptor to enter the target human cell. Animal studies also
showed an increase in RAAS inhibitor expression of ACE2 which could speed up the spread of
the virus in human cells, predispose for hospitalization, increase and, mortality. This was further
strengthened by the report that patients with hypertension taking ACEI/ARB have increased risk
of developing severe pneumonia (P = 0.064) 22. Dooley et al. also reported that RAAS inhibitors
increased the risk of symptomatic infection with COVID_19 approximately by two-fold in
community populations

27

. However, other studies reported that the use of ACEI/ARB did not

show association with the outcome of COVID-19 patients28-31.
This study, however, was in contrast to the original hypothesis demonstrating the safe usage of
RAAS inhibitors in hypertensive COVID_19 patients; in this, it was associated with a significant
reduction in mortality. The hypertensive patients with COVID_19 who were on ACE/ARB had a
27% reduction in risk of mortality compared to that not on ACEI/ARB. This finding is helpful
and should be considered in clinical decision making. Two large sample size studies,18 and

21

,

reported a reduction in mortality with patients on ARBs/ACEIs compared to those on nonARBs/ACEIs medications. A study compared the use of other antihypertensive drugs with
ACEI/ARB revealed that ACEI/ARB significantly reduced mortality in COVID_19 patients with
hypertension23. RAAS inhibitors thought to up-regulate the level of ACE2 which may protect
against organ damage by inhibiting the production of angiotensin II32. Moreover, the study
showed that patients with COVID_19 appeared to exhibit RAAS activation, increased viral load
levels, and lung injury33. However, all five small sample studies did not show any association
with mortality20-24. Emerging data suggested that patients with hypertension and diagnosed with
