Abstract
Background: COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred in homeless shelters across the US,
highlighting an urgent need to identify the most effective infection control strategy to prevent
future outbreaks.

Methods: We developed a microsimulation model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a homeless
shelter and calibrated it to data from cross-sectional polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) surveys
conducted during COVID-19 outbreaks in five shelters in three US cities from March 28 to April
10, 2020. We estimated the probability of averting a COVID-19 outbreak when an exposed
individual is introduced into a representative homeless shelter of 250 residents and 50 staff over
30 days under different infection control strategies, including daily symptom-based screening,
twice-weekly PCR testing and universal mask wearing.

Results: The proportion of PCR-positive residents and staff at the shelters with observed
outbreaks ranged from 2.6% to 51.6%, which translated to basic reproduction number (!! )
estimates of 2.9–6.2. The probability of averting an outbreak diminished with higher
transmissibility (!! ) within the simulated shelter and increasing incidence in the local
community. With moderate community incidence (~30 confirmed cases/1,000,000 people/day),
the estimated probabilities of averting an outbreak in a low-risk (!! =1.5), moderate-risk
(!! =2.9), and high-risk (!! =6.2) shelter were, respectively: 0.35, 0.13 and 0.04 for daily
symptom-based screening; 0.53, 0.20, and 0.09 for twice-weekly PCR testing; 0.62, 0.27 and
0.08 for universal masking; and 0.74, 0.42 and 0.19 for these strategies combined.

Conclusions: In high-risk homeless shelter environments and locations with high community
incidence of COVID-19, even intensive infection control strategies (incorporating daily
symptom-screening, frequent PCR testing and universal mask wearing) are unlikely to prevent
outbreaks, suggesting a need for non-congregate housing arrangements for people experiencing
homelessness. In lower-risk environments, combined interventions should be employed to reduce
outbreak risk.

Introduction
The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by infection with severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses great risk to people experiencing
homelessness. Across the United States (US), the estimated 568,000 people who experience
homelessness nightly [1] are likely to suffer a disproportionate disease burden and need for
hospitalization [2,3]. People experiencing homelessness are on average older and have a high
prevalence of comorbidities that are risk factors for severe COVID-19 [2]. Multiple outbreaks in
homeless shelters have occurred in several cities including San Francisco, Boston, Seattle and
Atlanta with attack rates of up to 67% [4–7]. Homeless shelters have remained open in many
cities despite high incidence of infection in the community, concern about the risk of further
outbreaks, and uncertainty over the effectiveness of different infection control strategies. There is
an immediate need to identify the best infection control strategy to reduce the risk of outbreaks
and assess the safety of continuing to operate congregate shelters where transmission in the
community is high.

The role of shelters and associated infection control practices in transmission of COVID-19
among people experiencing homelessness is still poorly understood. Given current understanding
that SARS-CoV-2 virus is transmitted predominantly through respiratory droplets, with some
airborne and fomite transmission [8], there is a need to consider policies to limit transmission
within high-density congregate living environments. Different infection control strategies are
currently recommended based on the level of transmission in the external community [9]. These
include routine symptom screening, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, universal mask
wearing, and relocation of individuals at high risk of severe disease to non-congregate settings

[10]. There is limited evidence on the effectiveness of strategies to reduce transmission in
congregate settings, and thus further research is urgently needed to guide city-level policy across
the US.

The goal of this study is to identify the most effective infection control strategy to slow the
spread of COVID-19 among people experiencing homelessness who reside in shelters. We
address this pressing question by estimating comparative health outcomes of key infection
control strategies using a simulation model calibrated to data on homeless shelter outbreaks.

Methods
Microsimulation model
We developed an individual-level stochastic susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR)
model [11] to simulate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in a congregate shelter population
(Additional file 1: Figure S1). The model defines individuals as susceptible, exposed, infectious,
or immune to SARS-CoV-2 (Additional file 1: Table S1). We constructed the model to include
important aspects of the natural history of COVID-19, including sub-clinical infection, presymptomatic transmission, and age-specific differences in risk of severe symptoms (see
Additional file 1 for full details). In the model, susceptible individuals become infected with
SARS-CoV-2 at a rate proportional to the prevalence of infectious individuals inside the shelter
and their infectiousness (assuming homogeneous mixing), plus a static force of infection based
on the background infection incidence in the community outside the shelter. Upon infection,
individuals enter a latent infection stage in which they incubate the virus but are not infectious.
They then progress to become infectious and contribute to ongoing transmission. An age-

dependent fraction of infected individuals develop clinical symptoms with associated risk of
hospitalization and death (Additional file 1: Table S2), while the remainder have sub-clinical
infection. Individuals who recover from infection are assumed to remain immune.

Data
The model was calibrated using aggregate data from PCR testing conducted during COVID-19
outbreaks in five shelters in three US cities – San Francisco (n=1), Boston (n=1) and Seattle
(n=3) [4,6,7] – from March 28–April 10, 2020. We obtained de-identified individual-level data
from the outbreak in the San Francisco shelter (see Additional file 1 and Additional file 1: Table
S3 for details), which is fully described elsewhere [5]. As of April 10, 2020, a total of 89
individuals (84 residents, 5 staff) of 175 tested (130 residents, 45 staff) in the shelter were PCRpositive. We obtained aggregate data from the outbreaks in the Boston and Seattle shelters,
where identified COVID-19 cases triggered mass testing events [4,6,7]. In the Boston shelter,
147 of 408 residents and 15 of 50 staff were PCR-positive during testing conducted April 2–3,
2020. The numbers of residents and staff tested and positive in the three Seattle shelters (shelters
A, B and C) at two testing events conducted March 30–April 1 and April 7–8, 2020 are given in
Additional file 1: Table S4. For the San Francisco shelter, we used daily census data to inform
the shelter population size, which decayed over time, and risk stratification for disease severity
by age and comorbidity status (Additional file 1: Figure S2). For the other shelters, we assumed a
constant population size over time.

We calibrated the model to the aggregate numbers of individuals PCR-positive out of those
tested in each shelter (daily data for the San Francisco shelter, cross-sectional for the Seattle and
Boston shelters) using approximate Bayesian computation techniques (see Additional file 1). We
fitted the following parameters: (i) the basic reproduction number !! (the average number of
secondary infections generated by the average infectious individual in an entirely susceptible
shelter population), (ii) the number of latently infected individuals who initially entered the
shelter "! , and (iii) the number of days before the first case was identified that these individuals
entered the shelter # (Table 1). The remaining parameters were sourced from literature on
natural history and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1 and Additional file 1: Table S5).

Infection control strategies
We simulated six infection control strategies (Additional file 1: Table S6), selected via informal
consultation with public health experts. 1) Daily symptom-based screening: daily screening of all
individuals in the shelter involving a temperature and symptom survey. Individuals who screened
positive were PCR tested, with 80% compliance, and isolated for 1 day pending the test result; if
negative, they returned to the population. We assumed that isolated individuals were unable to
transmit or become infected. We used published data on the sensitivity of symptom-based
screening with time since infection [12], which suggests that close to 100% of symptomatic
cases (a subset of all true cases) would eventually be detected under repeated daily screening
based on the definition of being symptomatic, even with low sensitivity of symptom screening
on any one occasion (here assumed to be 40% to give a 98% probability of detection after 8 days
of daily symptom screening). Despite reports of low specificity of symptom screening [13,14], a
high specificity of 90% was assumed to prevent unrealistic levels of PCR testing and isolation of

symptom-positive individuals awaiting test results. We assumed a minimum of 3 days between
repeat PCR tests for the same individual based on typical clinical practice and test turnaround
times. 2) Routine PCR testing: twice-weekly PCR testing of residents and staff based on prior
literature analyzing reduction in transmission and cost-effectiveness under different testing
frequencies [15–17]. We assumed 75% sensitivity and 100% specificity of PCR testing based on
published literature [18–21], a mean duration of detectable viral load (starting prior to
development of symptoms) of 20 days (Additional file 1: Figure S3) [22–27], and 80%
compliance with testing. We assumed test results were returned in 1 day, after which time
individuals who tested PCR-positive were removed from the shelter population. 3) Universal
mask wearing: wearing of masks by all persons within the shelter. We assumed that mask
wearing reduced the amount of infectious SARS-CoV-2 material breathed into the air by infected
individuals by 30% and that inhaled by susceptible individuals by 40% based on a review of the
literature on filtration efficiencies of masks and the impact of mask wearing on infection risk
(see Additional file 1), and that 60% of individuals adhered to mask wearing [28–31]. 4)
Relocation of “high-risk” individuals: moving high-risk individuals (defined as those ≥60 years
and/or with co-morbidities) to single hotel rooms, modelled by replacing such individuals with
lower-risk individuals. 5) Routine PCR testing of staff only: twice-weekly testing of staff only,
assuming 80% compliance. 6) Combination strategy: strategies 1–4 combined. Daily symptom
screening (strategy 1) was included in all strategies as it is considered a minimum requirement
under CDC guidelines for control practices in homeless shelters [32].

For each intervention strategy we simulated transmission within a shelter of 250 residents and 50
staff (based on an average shelter size) over 30 days starting with one latently infected individual
1000 times (to account for stochastic uncertainty). The time period was chosen to capture the
trajectory of an outbreak and differential benefits of strategies. The primary outcome was the
probability of averting an outbreak (defined as 3 or more infections originating within the shelter
in any 14-day period [33,34]) under each strategy, with secondary outcomes of the proportional
reductions in the total numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infections and clinical cases, and total numbers
of hospitalizations, deaths and PCR tests used. Only individuals who tested positive were
removed from the shelter population. The initial population was chosen to have the same
composition in terms of proportions in different risk groups (by age and co-morbidity status) as
the San Francisco shelter. We estimated the probability of averting an outbreak under each
intervention strategy (compared with no interventions) for each calibrated !! value for a range of
different background infection rates estimated from incidence of confirmed cases in Seattle,
Boston and San Francisco (see Additional file 1 for details). To account for potential upward bias
in the estimated !! range due to fitting to data from shelters with high attack rates, we performed
the same simulations for a shelter environment with a low !! of 1.5. The analyses were
conducted in R version 4.0.0 [35] and the data and model code are available at
https://github.com/LloydChapman/COVID_homeless_modelling.

Sensitivity analysis
We conducted a multi-way sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of uncertainty in key natural
history and intervention parameters – relative infectiousness of subclinical infection and the early
infectious stage, sensitivities and specificities of symptom screening and PCR tests, testing and

masking compliances, and mask effectiveness – on the results, by simulating each intervention
strategy across all combinations of the minimum and maximum values of these parameters over
their uncertainty ranges (Table 1). We explored the impact of PCR testing frequency on the
probability of averting an outbreak by varying the testing frequency in strategy 2 from daily to
monthly.

Results
Model calibration
The model reproduced the numbers of PCR-positive individuals in the cross-sectional surveys in
the Seattle and Boston shelters (Additional file 1: Figure S4) and the observed numbers of PCRpositive individuals and symptomatic cases over time for the outbreak in the San Francisco
shelter (Additional file 1: Figures S4–S5). The estimated !! values ranged from 2.9 (95% CI
1.1–6.7) for Seattle shelter B to 6.2 (95% CI 4.0–7.9) for the San Francisco shelter (Additional
file 1: Table S7), with corresponding estimated cumulative infection incidences at the end of the
testing period of 14% (95% CI 1–41%) and 83% (95% CI 72–92%) (Additional file 1: Table S8).
The median estimated number of infections initially introduced was 3 for all shelters (95% CI 1–
5), but with a relatively flat posterior distribution extending to the bounds of the uniform prior
distribution, reflecting considerable uncertainty in this parameter (Additional File 1: Figure S10).
The estimated date of introduction of infection ranged from 10 days (95% CI 7–14 days) before
the first case was identified for Seattle shelter B to 21 days (95% CI 17–26 days) before for San
Francisco.

Table 2 shows the projected impact of the six infection control strategies considered, for
different transmission environments. Daily symptom screening performed poorly for all levels of
transmission (probability of averting an outbreak = 0.04 for San Francisco !! = 6.2, and
probability = 0.35 for !! = 1.5). Relocating individuals at high-risk of clinical symptoms
combined with symptom screening performed similarly to symptom screening alone (probability
of averting an outbreak = 0.04–0.33 for !! = 6.2–1.5). Twice-weekly PCR testing of staff
provided some additional benefit over daily symptom screening at lower levels of transmission
(probability of averting an outbreak = 0.04–0.41 for !! = 6.2–1.5). Twice-weekly PCR testing
of all individuals and universal masking yielded higher probabilities of averting an outbreak of
0.09–0.53 and 0.08–0.62 for !! = 6.2–1.5. The combination strategy involving daily symptom
screening, twice-weekly PCR testing of all individuals, universal masking, and removal of highrisk individuals gave the highest probability of averting an outbreak (0.19–0.74 for !! = 6.2–
1.5), but still prevented a minority of outbreaks in all but the lowest-risk setting.

The probability of averting an outbreak under each intervention strategy decreased with
increasing transmission potential (!! ) inside the shelter and with increasing infection incidence
in the community outside the shelter (Figure 1). Even under the combination strategy, the
probability of averting an outbreak in an average-transmission-potential shelter (!! = 2.9)
decreased from 0.77 to 0.12 as the background infection rate increased from 0 to 439 cases per 1
million person-days (the estimated background infection rate in San Francisco between June 27
and July 10, 2020).

The relative reduction in infection incidence under the different infection control strategies
followed the same pattern as the probability of averting an outbreak (Additional file 1: Table S10
and Figure 2).

PCR test requirements were approximately three times higher (at an average of 6.6 tests per
person per month) under twice-weekly PCR testing of all individuals than when only testing
individuals identified as symptomatic in daily symptom screening (2.0 tests/person/month), and
approximately two times higher than when only testing staff twice-a-week (2.8
tests/person/month) (Additional file 1: Table S11).

Sensitivity analysis
The probability of averting an outbreak was most sensitive to uncertainty in masking compliance
and effectiveness and relative infectiousness of the early infectious stage, with the mean
probability of averting an outbreak under combined interventions across all combinations of the
minimum and maximum values of the other parameters varying from 0.40–0.71 for 30–100%
masking compliance, 0.49–0.62 and 0.48–0.63 for 10–50% and 20–60% mask exhalation and
inhalation effectiveness, and 0.63–0.48 for early-stage relative infectiousness of 1–3 for !! =
2.9 (Additional file 1: Figure S9). After this, the probability of averting an outbreak was most
sensitive to PCR sensitivity and testing compliance, with the mean probability of averting an
outbreak under combined interventions varying from 0.50–0.61 and 0.51–0.60 over the
uncertainty ranges of these parameters. Decreasing the frequency of PCR testing from daily to
monthly decreased the probability of averting an outbreak for !! = 1.5, 2.9 and 3.9 from 0.71 to

0.33, 0.28 to 0.12, and 0.21 to 0.08 respectively, but had little impact on the already low
probability of averting an outbreak for !! = 6.2 (Figure 3).

Discussion
Several outbreaks of COVID-19 with high attack rates have occurred in homeless shelters across
the US, and there remains uncertainty over the best infection control strategies to reduce
outbreak risk in shelters. In this study, we applied a simulation analysis to identify infection
control strategies to prevent future outbreaks. We found that in high-risk shelters that are unable
to maximize basic infection control practices that sufficiently reduce the transmissibility of
SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. social distancing, reduced living density), no additional infection control
strategy is likely to prevent outbreaks. Similarly, in cities with high community incidence, no
infection control practices are likely to prevent an outbreak. In contrast, in lower-risk shelters
with low background community incidence, the implementation of strategies such as symptom
screening, routine PCR testing, and masking would help reduce outbreak risk.

We found a wide range of transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 based on observed outbreaks in
homeless shelters, which greatly affects intervention impact. We estimated basic reproduction
numbers (!! ) of 2.9–6.2 from aggregate PCR test data from outbreaks in five shelters in Seattle,
Boston and San Francisco between March and April 2020. This range of !! values is at the high
end of estimates reported in the literature [36–39], and likely reflects a high degree of
heterogeneity in infectiousness between individuals [38,40–43] and a highly conducive
environment for transmission within these shelters due to lack of existing infection control
practices and high living density at the time of the outbreaks. For these !! values and

representative background infection rates, we found that the infection control strategies
considered are unlikely to prevent outbreaks (probability < 50%), even when combined.
Nevertheless, they do reduce incidence of infection and clinical disease and slow the growth of
the outbreak (Figure 2). Our !! estimates are likely not entirely representative of general
transmission potential in shelters now given that the outbreaks occurred early during the
pandemic when control measures were limited, and that non-outbreaks and smaller outbreaks
may go undetected or unreported. Control measures such as rehousing of individuals to single
hotel rooms appear to have been successful and incidence has in general been lower in the
homeless population than anticipated [44]. However, there have been subsequent large outbreaks
in homeless shelters despite reduced shelter density and stringent control efforts [45–47]. This
supports our finding that outbreaks in congregate shelters remain likely even with fairly intensive
infection control practices.

In lower transmissibility settings, e.g. with !! = 1.5, which may be more representative of
typical shelters now due to improved social distancing and basic infection control practices, the
intervention strategies we have considered are more likely to prevent outbreaks (probability up to
nearly 75% under combined interventions, for a moderate background infection rate of
approximately 120/1,000,000/day).

A key remaining issue given limited availability of alternative housing for people experiencing
homelessness is identifying the characteristics that distinguish low-risk shelters (those similar to
the !! = 1.5 scenario considered here) that can be operated with low outbreak risk with
implementation of infection control strategies. Data are limited, but available evidence suggests

that social distancing and reductions in super-spreading are likely to be key factors [38,40,48–
50]. Strategies that may achieve these goals include reducing living density, spacing bedding,
reducing communal activities, and adopting staffing models that limit social contacts.

The fact that intervention impact and the probability of averting an outbreak decrease
significantly with increasing background infection rate in the community (Figure 1) suggests a
need for alternative housing arrangements for people experiencing homelessness in locations in
which community incidence is moderate to high – 100–500 infections/1,000,000/day, equivalent
to 25–125 confirmed cases/1,000,000/day assuming four-fold underreporting (see Additional file
1). In lower background incidence settings, combined daily symptom-based screening, twiceweekly PCR testing, universal masking and relocation of high-risk individuals to non-congregate
settings would reduce outbreak risk, and limit incidence of infection and severe disease if
outbreaks do occur.

Our findings broadly agree with those of two other modelling studies of interventions against
COVID-19 in homeless shelters: one in the US [51], the other in England [52]. The former found
that a combination of daily symptom screening with PCR testing of symptom-positive
individuals, universal PCR testing every 2 weeks, and alternative care sites for those with
mild/moderate COVID-19 would significantly reduce infections, while remaining cost effective,
but unlike our analysis did not consider variation in the effectiveness of interventions with
community incidence. The latter study supports our results on the high risk of outbreaks in
congregate homeless shelters, as it found that outbreaks in homeless shelters were likely even

when incidence in the general population is low, and estimated that closure of congregate
shelters during the first pandemic wave in England averted over 90% of infections.

Each infection control strategy is limited in some aspect [22,53–57]. Symptom-based screening
has very low sensitivity to detect infections early in the clinical course (when people are most
infectious), and poor specificity [12–14,58]. The impact of routine PCR testing is limited by
imperfect PCR sensitivity (~75%), especially early in the infection course [19], as well as need
for frequent testing and missing onset of infectiousness between testing periods. Other analyses
support our finding that testing less than once or twice weekly leaves a high risk of outbreaks
(e.g. testing once every two weeks gives a 30% lower probability of averting an outbreak than
twice-weekly testing, Figure 3) [15,16,59]. However, once- or twice-weekly testing may be
financially and logistically infeasible. Similarly, relocation of high-risk persons to independent
housing is resource intensive. Frequent testing and universal masking also suffer issues with
adherence, and may not be possible for all individuals at all times in homeless shelters.

This study has a number of limitations. Due to limited data availability, we only calibrated the
model to a small number of shelter outbreaks, the !! estimates for which are likely to be higher
than for the average shelter since they occurred early in the pandemic and larger outbreaks are
more likely to be reported. The cross-sectional aggregate nature of the majority of the data also
led to wide uncertainty intervals around the fitted parameters, without independent identifiability
between them (Additional file 1: Figure S10). Our results suggest that universal masking would
significantly reduce the risk of outbreaks in homeless shelters, even with 60% compliance.
However, the impact of masking is highly sensitive to the assumed masking effectiveness and

compliance, estimates for which still vary considerably despite accumulating evidence that
masks reduce infection risk [60–64]. Many uncertainties in the biology of SARS-CoV-2
transmission remain, particularly regarding differential infectiousness over time and by severity
of illness, and the relationship of PCR positivity and infectiousness [22,65,66]. Our assumption
of equal infectiousness for different individuals means that our model is unlikely to fully
reproduce super-spreading events [38,40]. We made several simplifying assumptions in
modelling transmission within the shelter and from the surrounding community, namely:
homogenous mixing within the shelter population, no entry of new people, a stable background
infection rate over time and full immunity upon recovery from infection given the short duration
of the simulation. Our assumption that individuals who are isolated within homeless shelters
while awaiting test results are unable to transmit or become infected may have led to slight
overestimation of the impact of testing, since in reality isolation is not perfect. We assumed
homogeneous mixing due to a lack of contact data for the shelter outbreaks, which meant that we
were not able to consider cohorting and contact tracing as interventions.

This study defines conditions for operating homeless shelters with lower risk of COVID-19
outbreaks and estimates the impact of various interventions on outbreak risk. Our findings
demonstrate the need for combined interventions (symptom-based screening, PCR testing, and
masking) and regular testing to protect persons experiencing homelessness from COVID-19,
while highlighting the limitations of these interventions in preventing outbreaks.
