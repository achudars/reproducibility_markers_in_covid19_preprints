Abstract

21

Capsid-integrity quantitative PCR (qPCR), a molecular detection method for infectious viruses

22

combining azo-dye pretreatment with qPCR, has been widely used in recent years; however,

23

variations in pretreatment conditions for various virus types can limit the efficacy of specific

24

protocols. By identifying and critically synthesizing forty-two recent peer-reviewed studies

25

employing capsid-integrity qPCR for viruses in the last decade (2009 to 2019) in the fields of food

26

safety and environmental virology, we aimed to establish recommendations for the detection of

27

infectious viruses. Intercalating dyes are effective measures of viability in PCR assays provided

28

the viral capsid is damaged; viruses that have been inactivated by other causes, such as loss of

29

attachment or genomic damage, are less well detected using this approach. Although optimizing

30

specific protocols for each virus is recommended, we identify a framework for general assay

31

conditions. These include concentrations of ethidium monoazide, propidium monoazide or its

32

derivates between 10 and 200 µM; incubation on ice or at room temperature (20 - 25ºC) for 5 to

33

120 min; and dye activation using LED or high light (500 – 800 Watts) exposure for periods

34

ranging from 5 to 20 min. These simple steps can benefit the investigation of infectious virus

35

transmission in routine (water) monitoring settings and during viral outbreaks such as the current

36

COVID-19 pandemic or endemic diseases like dengue fever.

1. Introduction

43

Global population expansion and climate change are poised to increase both freshwater demand

44

and wastewater production. Exposure to waterborne and foodborne pathogens through recreational

45

activities, irrigation water, and food consumption, as well as associated occupations, poses a risk

46

to public health in high and low resource environments (Efstratiou et al., 2017; Gibson, 2014). To

47

date, more than 150 enteric viruses have been described to cause waterborne-associated human

48

illnesses, including gastrointestinal and chronic infections (Sinclair et al., 2009). In addition,

49

enteric viruses have shown a significantly higher persistence in the aquatic environment compared

50

to conventional fecal indicator bacteria (Rames et al., 2016). Several enteric viruses relevant to

51

human health could pass conventional sewage treatment in high numbers, thus posing a health risk

52

when partially treated reclaimed sewage is utilized to irrigate fruits and vegetables (Brouwer et al.,

53

2018) or released into the aquatic environment of rivers and lakes (Hellmér et al., 2014).

54

Consequently, viral infectivity measurements are included in guidelines of water reuse for potable

55

and non-potable purposes to demonstrate water reuse safety and evaluate water treatment

56

efficiencies through log-reduction value achievements (Farkas et al., 2020; Gerba and Betancourt,

57

2019). Due to their high infectivity and transmission rate as well as usually relatively low

58

infectious dose, virus analysis in water and on fomites is frequently used when investigating

59

likelihood of water-/surface borne transmission. This is especially the case in viral outbreaks

60

causing acute and chronic illnesses like the Ebola virus disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome

61

(SARS), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers), seasonal dengue outbreaks in (sub-)tropical

62

regions and the current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-Coronavirus-2 (Corman et al.,

63

2020; Grubaugh et al., 2019)).

64

While still the gold standard, culture-based methods for propagation of infectious human

65

pathogenic viruses in a laboratory environment require specialized facilities and experienced

66

personnel and test results may only become available after five to ten days (Rodriguez et al., 2009).

67

Molecular techniques using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) are faster and have

68

been successfully used in the past two decades to determine virus loads in the aquatic environment

69

and to comply with food safety regulations (Bosch et al., 2018; Gerba and Betancourt, 2019).

70

While robust, cost-efficient and uniquely sensitive and specific, qPCR has the severe limitation of

71

not being able to differentiate between infectious and non-infectious virus particles, thus

72

overestimating the number of viruses present in a sample (Chhipi-Shrestha et al., 2017). Novel

73

approaches like modifying the targeted gene sequence or the length of the PCR product, or

74

amplifying less stable messenger RNA after reverse transcription to DNA (e.g. (Ho et al., 2016;

75

Ko et al., 2003; Polston et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2019)) generally lack robustness and sensitivity.

76

One of the most established qPCR modifications to measure infectivity is capsid integrity qPCR,

77

an approach where samples are pre-treated with the intercalating azo dyes propidium monoazide

78

(PMA), ethidium monoazide (EMA) or their derivates PMAxx and PEMAX. First described

79

almost two decades ago by Nogva et al. (2003) to allow the identification of viable but non-

80

cultivable bacteria, this technique has been successfully adapted to remove putatively false-

81

positive qPCR signals deriving from virions with broken capsids in complex matrices like sewage

82

and surface water (Leifels et al., 2016; Randazzo et al., 2018a). Based on the principle that an azo

83

dye can only enter virions with a damaged capsid to covalently and irreversibly bind with viral

84

DNA or RNA, this pretreatment can block amplification of nucleic acids due to the detachment of

85

the polymerase when it encounters the dye-genome complex. Subsequently, only genomic targets

86

are amplified that originate from intact virions while those nucleic acids that are free (outside the

87

virion) or belong to non-infectious viruses are removed from the quantitative PCR. This indirect

88

viable measurement method has been especially useful for those viruses for which cell cultivation-

89

based detection has been difficult, but has yet to be fully validated (Estes et al., 2019). One known

90

limitation of the azo intercalating dyes is their inability to differentiate viruses that have lost their

91

infectivity due to damaged nucleic acids but whose capsid remains intact, a condition often found

92

after UV-C treatment (Leifels et al., 2015). Moreover, there are numerous factors that affect the

93

efficacy of a method, including virus type, inactivation method, type of dye and its concentration.

94

Incubation conditions and light source are also crucial in the applicability of capsid integrity qPCR

95

as reflected by the great range of capsid integrity pretreatment conditions in the literature.

96

Consequently, the objectives of this review were to evaluate the efficiency of azo dye pretreatment

97

conditions as stated in current literature and to establish protocols and considerations of the capsid

98

integrity qPCR methods for virus infectivity monitoring.

2. Literature Search and Analysis Strategy

100

The guidelines for systematic article search and selection as recommended in the PRISMA

101

Statement have been adopted in this work (Moher et al., 2009; Moher et al., 2015). To ensure

102

reproducibility, a search string was constructed in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook

103

(Cochrane, 2019), and a search was conducted in March 2020 (Figure 1) in relevant databases like

104

Pubmed, Scopus, Ovid, Medline and Web of Knowledge to cover relevant articles in English since

105

the first introduction of the azo dye pretreatment in 2003 (Supplementary Table S1). Articles were

106

screened according to specific criteria.

For quality control and to follow the recommendations of Cochrane (2019), two of the authors

112

(M.L. and K.S.) conducted the title and abstract evaluation in parallel, with a third author (E.S.)

Figure 2: Schematic overview of a typical case study structure. One or more virus samples (taken from the
environment or a culture collection) are split in two and one portion is inactivated, the other not, before
filtration and concentration steps. Azo-dye pretreatment is then conducted under various incubation
conditions and concentrations of PMA, PMAxx, PEMAX or EMA, either in the presence or absence of
additives like surfactants and enzymes, before the tubes are exposed to light for photo activation. While
early studies used high-energy light sources (500 – 800 Watt) to initiate the formation of the light induced
dye-genome complex, more recent articles have focused on low energy LED in the blue light spectrum.
Virus quantification is done with qPCR or ddPCR for quantitative, or endpoint PCR for qualitative,
detection after genome extraction.

129

Disinfection methods utilized in water treatment or food safety have also used capsid integrity

130

qPCR to determine the efficiency in virus inactivation (Lee et al., 2018; Leifels et al., 2015;

131

Randazzo et al., 2018b).

141
142

The majority of studies investigated two or more viruses (69%) with an emphasis on the detection

143

of norovirus GI and GII (NoV GI/NoV GII) together with hepatitis A virus (HAV). The increase

144

in the number of studies on capsid integrity of NoV’s and HAV between 2016 and 2020 is most

145

likely associated with the release of ISO/TS 15216-2:2013 (ISO, 2013) that regulates the

146

quantification of NoV and HAV using qPCR, and subsequently has been replaced with an updated

147

version (ISO, 2019). The risk associated with norovirus outbreaks due to a low infectious dose and

148

high rate of particle shedding by infected individuals, together with the absence of commercially

149

available animal tissue cell lines, also explains the interest in developing azo dye pretreatments for

150

the detection of NoV (Blanco et al., 2017; Lowther et al., 2019). Murine norovirus (MNV) and

151

mengovirus, two viruses without relevance to human health, have been chosen as both are widely

152

used as process control surrogates because they lack human pathogenicity and are easy to

153

propagate on certain cell lines. Of the articles included, only three cover bacteriophages infecting

154

coliform bacteria as their host (phages MS2, PhiX174 and T4). As the laboratory safety

155

requirements, as well as workload for culture-based detection, of those phages are significantly

156

lower than for enteric viruses, the necessity to establish alternative methods to determine phage

157

infectivity is not as urgent as for enteric viruses (Toribio-Avedillo et al., 2020). Their increasing

158

relevance in the context of microbial source tracking will likely lead to more studies in the future

159

(Ogilvie et al., 2018).

160

The intercalating dye infectivity assay was successfully applied to most viruses tested, with few

161

exceptions. Bacteriophage T4 infecting Escherichia coli required higher temperatures for

162

inactivation than other viruses, with extremely high heat (110ºC) for significant capsid damage;

163

lower temperatures (85ºC) and proteolysis were not effective (Fittipaldi et al., 2012). Moreover,

164

capsid disruption of MNV was more challenging than for other viruses in the same studies, i.e.,

165

HAdV, poliovirus, rotavirus, and bacteriophages phiX174 and MS2, using heat treatment (Kim

166

and Ko, 2012; Leifels et al., 2015). Lack of efficacy of an azo dye method with avian influenza

167

virus was suspected to be due to natural characteristics of an enveloped virus that make it difficult

168

for EMA to penetrate the compromised capsid (Graiver et al., 2010). However, the PMA dye assay

169

was successfully

170

(Huang et al., 2016), lending further support to the conclusion that PMA is more effective than

171

EMA in removing false positive signals in qPCR (Fittipaldi et al., 2012; Gedalanga and Olson,

172

2009; Leifels et al., 2019).

174

4. Origin of studied viruses

175

The viruses analyzed were split evenly between strains obtained from culture-collections and wild

176

types, those obtained from clinical, environmental and food samples (Table 1). While progress has

177

been made in introducing protocols for their propagation in the laboratory, an established cell line

178

to propagate NoV GI/GII has yet to arrive (Estes et al., 2019; Veronica et al., 2018). Subsequently,

179

the studies included in this review analyzed NoV in stool samples obtained from hospitals, in

180

sewage or in surface water. One study evaluated the presence of NoV GI/GII in struvite, a

181

phosphate source used for fertilization, that was reclaimed from wastewater sludge (Yee et al.,

182

2019). A limitation of all studies on clinical, environmental and food samples is the absence of

183

information regarding absolute quantification of infectious and non-infectious viruses to evaluate

184

the assay performance. Other complicating factors include process recovery loss and inhibition

185

effects in qPCR assays that appeared to affect RNA viruses more than DNA viruses regardless of

5. Azo dye type and concentration range

192

Both EMA and PMA can permeate the bacterial cell membrane and virus capsid to intercalate with

193

nucleic acids when activated with light emitted by high-energy lamps or blue light emitting diodes

194

(LEDs). These azo dyes became available for research purposes in the early 2000s, but a number

195

of studies reported that the more charged EMA tended to enter bacterial cells with intact

196

membranes, thus potentially resulting in false-negative qPCR results (Fittipaldi et al., 2012;

197

Gedalanga and Olson, 2009). Seventy percent of the articles we researched used PMA or the

198

derived PMAxx, and a third of the studies compared them to EMA and/or the derivate PEMAX

199

(Table 1). In general, PMA and PMAxx were found to be more suitable for capsid integrity qPCR,

200

most likely due to their higher ability to enter thermally and chemically inactivated cells (Jeong

201

et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2017; Moreno et al., 2015), when compared to infectious virus titers

202

determined by cell culture (Leifels et al., 2019).

203

Azo dye concentrations are quite evenly distributed, ranging from less than 10 µM to greater than

204

200 µM. More than half of the articles under investigation reported either 50 µM or 100 µM (Table

205

1), which is in accordance with the recommendations by the manufacturer for bacterial cultures

206

(Biotium Inc., 2019). However, some works indicated optimal reduction rates with dye

207

concentrations between 4 µM and 10 µM (Karim et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2016; Leifels et al., 2016;

208

Leifels et al., 2019; Prevost et al., 2016). The effect of high azo dye concentration appeared to vary

209

with virus type; for example, adverse effects have been reported with > 125 µM PMA and phage

210

MS2 (Kim and Ko, 2012), while 250 µM PMA worked well for MNV and NoV GII.4 (Jeong et

211

al., 2017; Lee et al., 2015).

212
213

6. Incubation conditions

214

Approximately two thirds of the studies included in this review applied an incubation time with

215

the azo dye of 5 or 10 min (Table 1). A quarter incubated for 30 min and less than one in ten of

216

the studies reported periods lasting longer than one hour. A similarly clear trend is observed for

217

incubation temperature; most studies incubated at temperatures between 20°C and 25°C or

218

indicated that room temperature was used (Table 1). The remainder of the articles described the

219

samples being stored on ice or at 4 to 6°C; none of them used higher temperatures as sometimes

220

discussed for bacterial assays (Codony et al., 2019). Studies that applied a long incubation time

221

tended to use low temperatures (Coudray-Mounier et al., 2013; Sangsanont et al, 2014; Prevost et

222

al., 2016; Leifels et al., 2016; Canh et al., 2018; Oristo et al., 2017; Fraisse et al., 2018; Canh et

223

al., 2019; Leifels et al., 2019).

224
225

7. Dye activation conditions

226

Early publications utilizing azo dyes for the removal of non-infectious virus particles exclusively

227

applied 500- to 800-Watt halogen light sources used in stage lighting (Bellehumeur et al., 2015;

228

Canh et al., 2018; Escudero-Abarca et al., 2014; Graiver et al., 2010; Leifels et al., 2015;

229

Parshionikar et al., 2010; Sangsanont et al., 2014). Besides their operational hazards such as light

230

bulbs exploding due to long running times (a maximum of 5 min is recommended by the

231

manufacturer), both the heat and light emission in the ultraviolet and infrared spectra could

232

potentially harm the sample, thus subverting the purpose of the pretreatment altogether. Wider

availability of consumer-grade LED light technology in general and the introduction of dedicated

234

azo dye activation light sources by companies like GenIUL, Spain, allowed for a much more

235

precise and reproducible activation of PMA, EMA, PEMAX and PMAxx. Not surprisingly, 72%

236

of the records included in this review utilized either the commercial LED Active Blue light system

237

(GenIUL, Spain) or LEDs emitting blue (around 460 nm) light (Lee et al. (2015); Fongaro et al.

238

(2016)) as depicted in Table 1. A similar trend towards uniformity in the protocol design is

239

apparent in the length of time a sample is exposed to the light source. While the operational

240

requirements of the 500- to 800-W halogen lamps severely limited the exposure time to very short

241

periods (2-5 minutes according to manufacturer’s recommendations to avoid excessive heat

242

development that could lead to the light bulb exploding), the standard configuration of the

243

commercial light systems allows for 15 min of intense blue light. Two thirds of the studies

244

therefore employed 15 min as the light exposure time.

245
246

8. Additional reagents for azo dye pretreatment

247

Addition of non-ionic surfactants like Triton X-100 (Coudray-Meunier et al., 2013; Moreno et al.,

248

2015) and sodium lauroyl sarcosinate (Lee et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2018) have been described as

249

beneficial for the determination of virus infectivity and were most frequently used in the studies

250

evaluated (Table 1). Inclusion of non-ionic surfactant enable the azo dye molecules to enter

251

partially or completely ruptured capsids, thus improving their binding properties in the virus

252

genome. Palladium and platinum compounds such as Platinum(IV) chloride (PtCl4) and Cis-

253

dichlorodiammineplatinum (CPPD) are long known to chelate in mammalian cells by nucleic acid

254

ligands (Rosenberg et al., 1965), and have recently been adopted for the qPCR based

255

discrimination between live and dead bacteria such as E. coli and Cronobacter skazakii (Soejima

et al. (2016). Attempts to use them to determine virus infectivity have been successful but their

257

associated health risk limits potential applications in routine environmental microbiology (Fraisse

258

et al., 2018; Randazzo et al., 2018b).

259
260

9. Virus inactivation

261

Various methods to inactivate viruses were used in the studies included in this review. The

262

intention was either to evaluate disinfection efficiency as it is currently used in food safety and

263

water treatment (Jeong et al., 2017; Langlet et al., 2018; Leifels et al., 2016; Randazzo et al.,

264

2018a) or to act as controls to evaluate the efficacy of the capsid integrity protocol (Canh et al.,

265

2018; Canh et al., 2019; Farkas et al., 2020; Leifels et al., 2015). Addition of chlorine, exposure to

266

heat, and proteolysis are known to damage the viral capsid, thus rendering the genome accessible

267

to azo dyes. Temperatures from moderate to high (45°C to 95°C) for ten to thirty minutes could

268

reproducibly demonstrate the ability of all dyes to remove virus signals (to varying degrees) from

269

molecular quantification (Fraisse et al., 2018; Jeong et al., 2017; Leifels et al., 2015; Leifels et al.,

270

2019; Oristo et al., 2018). Similar effects could be shown for the addition of hypochlorite of up to

271

two milligram per milliliter (Fuster et al., 2016; McLellan et al., 2016; Prevost et al., 2016). Light

272

in the ultraviolet spectrum, on the other hand, affects the hydrogen bonds between nucleic acids,

273

resulting in the inability to reproduce inside the host cell. Capsid integrity qPCR failed to capture

274

the loss of virus infectivity in most UV studies (Karim et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2017; Leifels et al.,

275

2016; Leifels et al., 2019); it could detect capsid damage caused by medium-pressure UV lamps,

276

especially at 230-245 nm wavelength (Sangsanont et al., 2014), but not nucleic acid damage caused

277

by other wavelengths in the UV range (Beck et al., 2018; Beck et al., 2014; Sirikanchana et al.,

278

2008a, b). The varying efficiencies of PMA, PMAxx, PEMAX and EMA in preventing the

amplification of DNA/RNA of viruses that have lost their ability to infect their host cells due to

280

exposure to heat and reactive substances like chlorine resemble what has been described for

281

bacteria, starting with the first publication on the subject (Nogva et al., 2003).

282
283

10. Recommendations and potential applications

284

The utilization of azo dye pretreatment can be recommended for applications where culture assays

285

take too long to inform necessary remedial actions, and under low resource conditions either in

286

developing countries or in laboratories with only basic analytical capabilities. The recent outbreak

287

of SARS-CoV-2 associated COVID-19 represents an example where knowing the ratio of

288

infectious to non-infectious virions would help in determining whether symptomatic or

289

asymptomatic carriers need to be isolated (Beeching et al., 2020; Kaul, 2020). A step-by-step

290

protocol introducing azo-dye pretreatment to determine capsid integrity (and thus virus infectivity)

291

into an established qPCR workflow can be developed (Figure 4) according to the guidelines

292

suggested in this review. The key steps are virus- and matrix-specific optimization of the

293

incubation conditions, dye-concentration and photo activation.

conditions and photo activation can be modified and need to be optimized during assay
development.

301
302

Starting with these initial experimental conditions, optimized protocols need to be generated based

303

on the virus under investigation and the sample origin.

11 Conclusions

306

An evaluation of methods on the application of azo dye pretreatment to determine virus infectivity

307

by qPCR revealed a great diversity of viruses that have been tested under a range of treatment

308

conditions. The systematic literature comparison led to the following conclusions:

309



from qPCR for both DNA and RNA viruses than EMA and PEMAX.

310
311





“One size fits all” pretreatment approaches are possible but might lead to reduced signal
reduction rates of individual viruses.

314
315

Incubation duration and temperature, reagent concentration as well as light source and
exposure time need to be optimized and validated for the virus under investigation.

312
313

PMA and the derivate PMAxx show a higher efficiency in removing false negative signals



Capsid integrity qPCR can be a valuable tool to adapt existent workflows and qPCR

316

protocols to reflect the ability of viruses to infect humans, thus improving risk assessment

317

and consumer safety derived from these measurements.

318



Capsid integrity is a strong indicator of virus infectivity, which allows for the establishment

319

of robust assays to assess the infectivity of novel viruses in the event of outbreaks like the

320

2014 Ebola virus epidemic and the current COVID-19 pandemic.
