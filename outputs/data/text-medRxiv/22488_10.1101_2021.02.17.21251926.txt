Background: SARS-CoV-2 shedding dynamics in the upper (URT) and lower respiratory tract

17

(LRT) remain unclear.

18
19

Objective: To analyze SARS-CoV-2 shedding dynamics across COVID-19 severity, the

20

respiratory tract, sex and age cohorts (aged 0 to 17 years, 18 to 59 years, and 60 years or older).

21
22

Design: Systematic review and pooled analyses.

23
24

Setting: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Web of Science Core Collection, medRxiv and

25

bioRxiv were searched up to 20 November 2020.

26
27

Participants: The systematic dataset included 1,266 adults and 136 children with COVID-19.

28
29

Measurements: Case characteristics (COVID-19 severity, age and sex) and quantitative

30

respiratory viral loads (rVLs).

31
32

Results: In the URT, adults with severe COVID-19 had higher rVLs at 1 DFSO than adults (P =

33

0.005) or children (P = 0.017) with nonsevere illness. Between 1-10 DFSO, severe adults had

34

comparable rates of SARS-CoV-2 clearance from the URT as nonsevere adults (P = 0.479) and

35

nonsevere children (P = 0.863). In the LRT, severe adults showed higher post-symptom-onset

36

rVLs than nonsevere adults (P = 0.006). In the analyzed period (4-10 DFSO), severely affected

37

adults had no significant trend in SARS-CoV-2 clearance from LRT (P = 0.105), whereas

38

nonsevere adults showed a clear trend (P < 0.001). After stratifying for disease severity, sex and

39

age (including child vs. adult) were not predictive of the duration of respiratory shedding.

40
41

Limitation: Limited data on case comorbidities and few samples in some cohorts.

42
43

Conclusion: High, persistent LRT shedding of SARS-CoV-2 characterized severe COVID-19 in

44

adults. After symptom onset, severe cases tended to have higher URT shedding than their

45

nonsevere counterparts. Disease severity, rather than age or sex, predicted SARS-CoV-2

46

kinetics. LRT specimens should more accurately prognosticate COVID-19 severity than URT

47

specimens.

INTRODUCTION

51

As of 17 February 2021, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused more

52

than 109 million infections and 2.4 million deaths globally (1). The clinical spectrum of COVID-

53

19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is wide, ranging

54

from asymptomatic infection to fatal disease. Risk factors for severe illness and death include

55

age, sex, smoking and comorbidities, such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular

56

disease (2-4). Emerging evidence indicates that age and sex differences in innate, cross-reactive

57

and adaptive immunity facilitate the higher risks in older and male cases (5-8). Robust immune

58

responses putatively mediate nonsevere illness, in part, by controlling the replication of SARS-

59

CoV-2 (9).

60

As SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, its shedding dynamics in the upper (URT) and lower

61

respiratory tract (LRT) provide insight into clinical and epidemiological factors. URT viral load

62

has been associated with transmission risk, duration of infectiousness, disease severity and

63

mortality (10-16). Key questions, however, remain. While chest computed tomography (CT)

64

evidence of viral pneumonitis suggests pulmonary replication in most symptomatic cases (17),

65

the LRT kinetics of SARS-CoV-2, especially as related to disease severity, remain unknown.

66

The relationships between sex, age and disease severity on respiratory shedding are unclear.

67

Moreover, whether children clear SARS-CoV-2 at similar rates as adults, and if this correlates

68

the age-based differences in disease severity, is unknown.

69

For insight into these questions, we conducted a systematic review on SARS-CoV-2

70

quantitation from respiratory specimens and developed a large, diverse dataset of respiratory

71

viral loads (rVLs) and individual case characteristics. Stratified pooled analyses then assessed

72

SARS-CoV-2 shedding dynamics across the respiratory tract, age, sex and COVID-19 severity.

METHODS
Our systematic review identified studies reporting SARS-CoV-2 quantitation in respiratory

76

specimens taken during the estimated infectious period (-3 to 10 days from symptom onset

77

[DFSO]) (15, 18). The systematic review protocol was based on our previous study (19) and was

78

prospectively registered on PROSPERO (registration number, CRD42020204637). The

79

systematic review was conducted according to Cochrane methods guidance (20). Other than the

80

title of this study, we have followed PRISMA reporting guidelines (21).

81
82
83

Data Sources and Searches
Up to 20 November 2020, we searched, without the use of filters or language restrictions,

84

the following sources: MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of

85

Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Ovid), Web of Science Core Collection, and medRxiv and

86

bioRxiv (both searched through Google Scholar via the Publish or Perish program). We also

87

gathered studies by searching through the reference lists of review articles identified by the

88

database search, by searching through the reference lists of included articles, through expert

89

recommendation (by Epic J. Topol and Akiko Iwasaki on Twitter) and by hand-searching

90

through journals. A comprehensive search was developed by a librarian (Z.P.). Additional details

91

on the search are included in the Supplement.

96

saliva [POS]) or LRT (endotracheal aspirate [ETA] or sputum [Spu]) specimens taken during the

97

estimated infectious period (-3 to 10 DFSO) in humans were included (additional details in the

98

Supplement). As semiquantitative metrics (cycle threshold [Ct] values) cannot be compared on

99

an absolute scale between studies based on instrument and batch variation (22), studies reporting

100

specimen measurements as Ct values, without quantitative calibration, were excluded. Two

101

authors (P.Z.C. and N.B.) independently screened titles and abstracts and reviewed full texts. At

102

the full-text stage, reference lists were reviewed for study inclusion. Inconsistencies were

103

resolved by discussion and consensus.

104
105
106

Data Extraction and Risk-of-Bias Assessment
Two authors (P.Z.C. and N.B.) independently collected data (specimen measurements taken

107

between -3 and 10 DFSO, specimen type, volume of transport media and case characteristics,

108

including age, sex and disease severity) from contributing studies and assessed risk of bias using

109

a modified Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist (described in the

110

Supplement and shown in Supplement Table 6). Data were collected for individually reported

111

specimens of known type, with known DFSO, and for COVID-19 cases with known age, sex or

112

severity. Case characteristics were collected directly from contributing studies when reported

113

individually or obtained via data request from the authors. Data from serially sampled

114

asymptomatic cases were included, and the day of laboratory diagnosis was referenced as 0

115

DFSO (15, 23). Based on the modified JBI checklist, studies were considered to have low risk of

116

bias if they met the majority of items and included item 1 (representative sample). Discrepancies

117

were resolved by discussion and consensus.

119
120

Respiratory Viral Load
For analyses based on rVL (viral RNA concentration in the respiratory tract) and to account

121

for interstudy variation in the volumes of viral transport media (VTM) used, the rVL for each

122

collected sample was estimated based on the specimen concentration (viral RNA concentration

123

in the specimen) and dilution factor in VTM. Typically, swabbed specimens (NPS and OPS)

124

report the viral RNA concentration in VTM. Based on the VTM volume reported in the study

125

along with the expected uptake volume for swabs (0.128 ± 0.031 ml, mean ± SD) (24), we

126

calculated the dilution factor for each respiratory specimen and then estimated the rVL.

127

Similarly, liquid specimens (ETA, POS and Spu) are often diluted in VTM, and the rVL was

128

estimated based on the reported collection and VTM volumes. If the diluent volume was not

129

reported, then VTM volumes of 1 ml (NPS and OPS) or 2 ml (POS and ETA) were assumed (23,

130

25). Unless dilution was reported, Spu specimens were taken as undiluted (15). The non-

131

reporting of VTM volume was noted as an element increasing risk of bias in the modified JBI

132

critical appraisal checklist. For laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, negative specimen

133

measurements were taken at the reported assay detection limit in the respective study.

134
135
136

Case Definitions
As severity in the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and case-fatality rates tend to

137

increase among children (aged 0-17 y), younger adults (aged 18-59 y) and older adults (aged 60

138

y or older) (4, 26), the data were delineated based on these three age cohorts. Cases were also

139

categorized by sex.

140
141

U.S. National Institutes of Health guidance was used to categorize disease severity as
nonsevere or severe (27). The nonsevere cohort included those with asymptomatic infection

142

(individuals who test positive via a molecular test for SARS-CoV-2 and report no symptoms

143

consistent with COVID-19); mild illness (individuals who report any signs or symptoms of

144

COVID-19, including fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, headache, muscle pain, nausea,

145

vomiting, diarrhea, loss of taste and smell, but who do not have dyspnea or abnormal chest

146

imaging); and moderate illness (individuals with clinical or radiographic evidence of LRT

147

disease, fever >39.4°C or SpO2 >94% on room air) disease. The severe cohort included those

148

with severe illness (individuals who have SpO2 <94% on room air, [PaO2/FiO2] <300 mmHg,

149

respiratory rate >30 breaths/min or lung infiltrates >50%) and critical illness (respiratory failure,

150

septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction).

151
152
153

Statistical Analysis
We used regression analysis to assess the respiratory shedding of SARS-CoV-2 and compare

154

age, sex or severity cohorts. In COVID-19 cases, rVL tends to diminish exponentially after 1

155

DFSO in the URT, whereas it tends to do so after 4 DFSO in the LRT (15, 17, 19). Hence, rVLs

156

(in units of log10 copies/ml) between 1-10 DFSO for the URT, or 4-10 DFSO for the LRT, were

157

fitted using general linear regression with interaction:

158

𝑉 = 𝛼 + 𝛽! 𝑋! + 𝛽" 𝑋" + 𝛽# 𝑋! 𝑋" ,

(1)

159

where 𝑉 represents the rVL, 𝛼 represents the estimated mean rVL (at 1 DFSO for URT or 4

160

DFSO for LRT) for the reference cohort, 𝑋! represents DFSO for the reference cohort, 𝑋"

161

represents the comparison cohort, 𝛽! represents the effect of DFSO on rVL for the reference

162

cohort, 𝛽" represents the effect of the comparison cohort on the intercept and 𝛽# represents the

163

interaction between DFSO and cohorts. Regression analyses were offset by DFSO such that

164

mean rVLs at 1 DFSO for URT, or 4 DFSO for LRT, were compared between cohorts by the

165

effect on the intercept (regression t-test for 𝛽" ). Shedding dynamics were compared between

166

cohorts by interaction (regression t-test for 𝛽# ). The statistical significance of viral clearance for

167

each cohort was analyzed using simple linear regression (regression t-test on the slope).

168

Regression models were extrapolated (to 0 log10 copies/ml, rather than an assay detection limit)

169

to estimate the duration of shedding.

170

To assess heterogeneity in shedding, rVL data were fitted to Weibull distributions (19), and

171

the rVL at a case percentile was estimated using the Weibull quantile function. Each cohort in

172

statistical analyses included all rVLs for which the relevant characteristic (LRT or URT, age

173

cohort, sex or disease severity) was ascertained at the individual level. Cohorts with small

174

sample sizes were not compared, as these analyses are more sensitive to potential sampling error.

175

Statistical analyses were performed using OriginPro 2019b (OriginLab) and the General Linear

176

regression app or Matlab R2019b (MathWorks) and the Distribution Fitter app. P values below

177

0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Overview of Contributing Studies

187

After screening and full-text review, 26 studies met the inclusion criteria and contributed to
the systematic dataset (Figure 1) (15, 16, 23, 25, 26, 28-48). We collected 1,915 quantitative

188

specimen measurements of SARS-CoV-2 from 1,402 COVID-19 cases (Table 1, rVL data

189

summarized in Appendix Figure). For pediatric cases, the search found only nonsevere

190

infections and URT specimen measurements. Appendix Table 1 summarizes the characteristics

191

of contributing studies, of which 18 had low risk of bias according to the modified JBI critical

192

appraisal checklist. Studies at high or unclear risk of bias typically included samples that were

193

not representative of the target population; did not report the VTM volume used; had non-

194

consecutive inclusion for case series and cohort studies or did not use probability-based sampling

195

for cross-sectional studies; and did not report the response rate (Appendix Table 2).

196
197

URT Shedding of SARS-CoV-2 for Adult COVID-19

198

In the adult URT, regression analysis showed that, at 1 DFSO, the mean rVL for severe

199

COVID-19 (8.28 [95% CI, 7.71-8.84] log10 copies/ml) was significantly greater (P for intercept

200

= 0.005) than that of nonsevere COVID-19 (7.45 [95% CI, 7.26-7.65] log10 copies/ml) (Figure

201

2A). Meanwhile, these cohorts showed comparable rates of SARS-CoV-2 clearance from the

202

URT (P for interaction = 0.479). For severe cases, the estimated mean duration of URT shedding

203

(down to 0 log10 copies/ml) was 27.5 (95% CI, 21.2-33.8) DFSO; it was 27.9 (95% CI, 24.4-

204

31.3) DFSO for nonsevere cases.

205

While regression analysis compared mean shedding levels and dynamics, we fitted rVLs to

206

Weibull distributions to assess heterogeneity in shedding. Both severe and nonsevere adult

207

COVID-19 showed comparably broad heterogeneity in URT shedding throughout disease course

208

(Figure 2B). For severe disease, the standard deviation (SD) of rVL was 1.86, 2.34, 1.89 and

209

1.90 log10 copies/ml at 2, 4, 7 and 10 DFSO, respectively. For nonsevere illness, these SDs were

210

2.08, 1.90, 1.89 and 1.96 log10 copies/ml, respectively.

211

Based on our data, the distinction in rVL between severity cohorts was greater near

212

symptom onset. Based on distribution fitting (Figure 2B), at 2 DFSO, the estimated rVL at the

213

80th case percentile (cp) for severe disease was 9.54 (95% CI, 8.78-10.4) log10 copies/ml, while it

214

was 8.84 (95% CI, 8.49-9.20) log10 copies/ml for nonsevere illness. By 10 DFSO, this difference

215

reduced: the 80th-cp estimates were 6.86 (95% CI, 6.20-7.59) and 6.45 (95% CI, 5.91-7.04) log10

216

copies/ml for severe and nonsevere disease, respectively.

217

After stratifying adults for disease severity, our analyses showed nonsignificant differences

218

in URT shedding based on sex and age. For nonsevere illness, male and female cases had no

219

significant difference in mean rVL at 1 DFSO (P for intercept = 0.085) or rate of viral clearance

220

(P for interaction = 0.644) (Figure 2C). Similarly, for severe disease, male and female cases had

221

comparable mean rVLs at 1 DFSO (P for intercept = 0.326) and URT dynamics (P for

222

interaction = 0.280) (Figure 2D). For nonsevere illness, younger and older adults had no

223

significant difference in URT shedding levels at 1 DFSO (P for intercept = 0.294) or post-

224

symptom-onset dynamics (P for interaction = 0.100) (Figure 2E). For severe disease, the adult

225

age cohorts showed similar mean rVLs at 1 DFSO (P for intercept = 0.915) and rates of viral

226

clearance (P for interaction = 0.359) (Figure 2F).

227
228

LRT Shedding of SARS-CoV-2 for Adult COVID-19

229

Our analyses showed that high, persistent LRT shedding of SARS-CoV-2 was associated

230

with severe COVID-19, but not nonsevere illness, in adults (Figure 3A). At the initial day in our

231

analyzed period (4 DFSO), the mean rVL in the LRT of severe cases (8.42 [95% CI, 7.67-9.17]

232

log10 copies/ml) was significantly greater (P for intercept = 0.006) than that of nonsevere cases

233

(6.82 [95% CI, 5.95-7.69] log10 copies/ml). Between severities, the difference in LRT clearance

234

rates was marginally above the threshold for statistical significance (P for interaction = 0.053).

235

However, severe cases had persistent LRT shedding, with no significant trend in SARS-CoV-2

236

clearance in the analyzed period (-0.14 [95% CI, -0.32 to 0.030] log10 copies/ml day-1, P =

237

0.105), whereas nonsevere cases rapidly cleared the virus from the LRT (-0.41 [95% CI, -0.64 to

238

-0.19] log10 copies/ml day-1, P < 0.001). For nonsevere cases, the estimated mean duration of

239

LRT shedding (down to 0 log10 copies/ml) was 20.4 (95% CI, 13.2-27.7) DFSO.

240

Accordingly, the distributions of severe and nonsevere LRT shedding bifurcated along

241

disease course (Figure 3B). At 6 DFSO, the 80th cp estimate of LRT rVL was 9.40 (95% CI,

242

8.67-10.20) log10 copies/ml for severe COVID-19, while it was 7.66 (95% CI, 6.65-8.83) log10

243

copies/ml for nonsevere illness. At 10 DFSO, the difference between 80th-cp estimates expanded,

244

as they were 8.63 (95% CI, 8.04-9.26) and 6.01 (95% CI, 4.65-7.78) log10 copies/ml for severe

245

and nonsevere disease, respectively.

246

Our data indicated that nonsevere illness yielded greater skewing in LRT shedding than

247

severe disease in the analyzed period (Figure 3B). For nonsevere COVID-19, the SD of rVL was

248

1.92, 2.01 and 2.09 log10 copies/ml at 6, 8 and 10 DFSO, respectively. For severe disease, it was

249

lesser 1.25, 1.37 and 1.61 log10 copies/ml at 6, 8 and 10 DFSO, respectively.

250

For severe COVID-19, regression analysis showed, in the LRT, comparable mean rVLs at 4

251

DFSO between younger and older adults (P for intercept = 0.745) (Figure 3C). Both severe age

252

cohorts also showed persistent LRT shedding in the analyzed period: younger adults (-0.20 [95%

253

CI, -0.16 to 0.19] log10 copies/ml day-1, P = 0.988). The female cohort included few samples, and

257

statistically analyses were not conducted (Appendix Table 3).

258

Interestingly, nonsevere cases showed similar SARS-CoV-2 shedding between the URT and

259

LRT, whereas severe cases shed greater and longer in the LRT than the URT (Figure 3, D and

260

E). At 4 DFSO, the URT rVL of nonsevere adults was 6.62 (95% CI, 6.50-6.74) log10 copies/ml,

261

which was not different from the LRT rVL of nonsevere adults (P for intercept = 0.651). In

262

contrast, at 4 DFSO, the URT rVL of severe adults (7.34 [95% CI, 7.01-7.68] log10 copies/ml)

263

was significantly lower than the LRT rVL of severe adults (P for intercept = 0.031).

Comparison of URT Shedding between Adult and Pediatric COVID-19

266

For the pediatric cohort, regression estimated, in the URT, the mean rVL at 1 DFSO to be

267

7.32 (95% CI, 6.78-7.86) log10 copies/ml and SARS-CoV-2 clearance rate as -0.32 (95% CI, -

268

0.42 to -0.22) log10 copies/ml day-1 (Figure 4A). Both estimates were comparable between the

269

sexes for children (Figure 4D). The estimated mean duration of URT shedding (down to 0 log10

270

copies/ml) was 22.6 (95% CI, 17.0-28.1) DFSO for children with COVID-19.

271

Between pediatric cases, who had nonsevere illness in our dataset, and adults with nonsevere

272

illness, both URT shedding at 1 DFSO (P for intercept = 0.653) and URT dynamics (P for

273

interaction = 0.400) were similar (Figure 4A). Distributions of rVL were also comparable

274

between these cohorts (Figure 4B). Conversely, URT shedding at 1 DFSO was greater for

275

severely affected adults when compared to nonsevere pediatric cases (P for intercept = 0.017),

276

but URT dynamics remained similar (P for interaction = 0.863) (Figure 4C).

DISCUSSION

279

Our study systematically developed a dataset of COVID-19 case characteristics and rVLs

280

and conducted stratified analyses on SARS-CoV-2 shedding post-symptom onset. In the URT,

281

we found that adults with severe COVID-19 showed higher rVLs shortly after symptom onset,

282

but similar SARS-CoV-2 clearance rates, when compared with their nonsevere counterparts. In

283

the LRT, we found that high, persistent shedding was associated with severe COVID-19, but not

284

nonsevere illness, in adults. Interestingly, in the analyzed periods, adults with severe disease

285

tended to have higher rVLs in the LRT than the URT.

286

After stratifying for disease severity, we found that sex and age had nonsignificant effects on

287

post-symptom-onset SARS-CoV-2 shedding levels and dynamics for each included analysis

288

(summarized in Table 2). Thus, while sex and age influence the tendency to develop severe

289

COVID-19 (2-4), we find no such sex dimorphism or age distinction in URT shedding among

290

cases of similar severity. This includes children, who had nonsevere illness in our study and

291

show similar URT shedding post-symptom onset as adults with nonsevere illness.

292

Notably, our analyses indicate that high, persistent LRT shedding of SARS-CoV-2

293

characterizes severe COVID-19 in adults. This suggests that the effective immune responses

294

associated with milder COVID-19, including innate, cross-reactive and coordinated adaptive

295

immunity (5-9), do not significantly inhibit early, or prolonged, SARS-CoV-2 replication in the

296

LRT of severely affected adults. Hence, uncontrolled LRT replication tends to continue, at least,

297

to 10 DFSO, coinciding with the timing of clinical deterioration (median, 10 DFSO) (2, 49).

298

Furthermore, the bifurcated profiles of LRT shedding concur with the observed severity-

299

associated differences in lung pathology, in which severe cases show hyperinflammation and

300

progressive loss of epithelial-endothelial integrity (50-52).

301

Our results suggest that rVL may be a key prognostic indicator in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

302

They reinforce that severe COVID-19 is associated with greater rVLs than nonsevere illness (12-

303

14), and suggest that sex and age may not significantly influence prognostic thresholds. In the

304

URT, both nonsevere and severe cases tend to clear SARS-CoV-2 at comparable rates. Thus,

305

time course of disease (e.g., DFSO) should be considered alongside rVL, rather than simply

306

employing rVL at admission. LRT shedding, however, bifurcates considerably between

307

nonsevere and severe COVID-19, meaning that SARS-CoV-2 quantitation from the LRT may

308

more accurately predict severity. While URT specimens are typically used to diagnose COVID-

309

19, LRT specimens (our study predominantly analyzed sputum) may be collected from high-risk

310

patients for severity prognostication.

311

While our analyses did not account for virus infectivity, higher SARS-CoV-2 rVL is

312

associated with a higher likelihood of culture positivity, from adults (15, 16) as well as children

313

(36), and higher transmission risk (10). Hence, our results suggest that infectiousness increases

314

with COVID-19 severity, concurring with epidemiological analyses (53, 54). They also suggest

315

that adult and pediatric infections of similar severity have comparable infectiousness, reflecting

316

epidemiological findings on age-based infectiousness (54-56). Moreover, since respiratory

317

aerosols are typically produced from the LRT (57), severe SARS-CoV-2 infections may have

318

increased, and extended, risk for aerosol transmission. As severe cases tend to be hospitalized,

319

this provides one possible explanation for the elevated risk of COVID-19 among healthcare

320

workers in inpatient settings (58); airborne precautions, such as the use of N95 or air-purifying

321

respirators, should be implemented around patients with COVID-19.

322

Our study has limitations. First, while our study design systematically developed a large,

323

diverse dataset, there were few severe female cases with LRT specimens and no severe pediatric

15

324

cases included. Statistical comparisons involving these cohorts were not conducted based on

325

increased sensitivity to sampling bias, as COVID-19 presents broad heterogeneity in rVL.

326

Additional studies should permit these remaining comparisons. Second, our analyses did not

327

assess the influence of therapies or additional case characteristics, including comorbidities.

328

While the relationships between some comorbidities and SARS-CoV-2 kinetics remain unclear,

329

recent studies indicate many potential therapies (e.g., remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir,

330

ritonavir, low-dose monoclonal antibodies and ivermectin) have no significant anti-SARS-CoV-2

331

effects in patients (59-64). Third, the systematic dataset consisted largely of hospitalized

332

patients, and our results may not generalize to asymptomatic infections.

333

In summary, our findings provide insight into SARS-CoV-2 kinetics and describe

334

virological factors that distinguish severe COVID-19 from nonsevere illness. They show that

335

high, persistent LRT shedding characterizes severe disease in adults, highlighting the potential

336

prognostic utility of SARS-CoV-2 quantitation from LRT specimens. Lastly, each study

337

identified by our systematic review collected specimens before October 2020. As widespread

338

transmission of the emerging variants of concern likely occurred after this date (65, 66), our

339

study presents a quantitative resource to assess the effects of their mutations on respiratory

340

shedding levels and dynamics.
