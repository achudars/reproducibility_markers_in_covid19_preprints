Abstract:

23

Quantifying the effectiveness of large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)

24

against COVID-19 is critical to adapting responses against future waves of the

25

pandemic. Most studies of NPIs thus far have relied on epidemiological data. Here, we

26

report the impact of NPIs on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, taking the perspective of the

27

virus. We examined how variations through time and space of SARS-CoV-2 genomic

28

divergence rates, which reflect variations of the epidemic reproduction number Rt, can

29

be explained by NPIs and combinations thereof. Based on the analysis of 5,198 SARS-

30

CoV-2 genomes from 57 countries along with a detailed chronology of 9 non-

31

pharmaceutical interventions during the early epidemic phase up to May 2020, we find

32

that home containment (35% Rt reduction) and education lockdown (26%) had the

33

strongest predicted effectiveness. To estimate the cumulative effect of NPIs, we

34

modelled the probability of reducing Rt below 1, which is required to stop the epidemic,

35

for various intervention combinations and initial Rt values. In these models, no

36

intervention implemented alone was sufficient to stop the epidemic for Rt‚Äôs above 2 and

37

all interventions combined were required for Rt‚Äôs above 3. Our approach can help

38

inform decisions on the minimal set of NPIs required to control the epidemic depending

39

on the current Rt value.

40

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory

41

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in China in late 2019 1‚Äì3. Facing or

42

anticipating the pandemic, the governments of most countries implemented a wide

43

range of large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as lockdown measures, in

44

order to reduce COVID-19 transmission 4‚Äì6. Concerns have been raised regarding the

45

impact of such interventions on the economy, education, and, indirectly, the healthcare

46

system7.

47

Understanding the effectiveness of each non-pharmaceutical intervention against

48

COVID-19 is critical to implementing appropriate responses against current or future

49

waves of the pandemic. Comparative studies of interventions typically rely on

50

epidemiological data to estimate variations of the epidemic reproduction number, which

51

are then correlated with the implementation or relaxation of interventions 5,6,8. These

52

studies yielded conflicting conclusions. Depending on data sources and epidemiological

53

model design assumptions, some studies identified lockdown (stay at home order) as

54

the most effective intervention5,9 while others found little additional impact, if any,

55

compared to other interventions4,6,10. Epidemiological studies of interventions against an

56

epidemic face several challenges. Models informed by counts of confirmed cases or

57

deaths ignore the relationships and transmission patterns between cases. Counts

58

themselves can vary in accuracy and timeliness depending on countries‚Äô health

59

facilities, surveillance systems, and the changing definitions of cases. Even when an

60

intervention immediately reduces the transmission rate, a detectable reduction of

61

disease incidence can be much delayed6, especially when testing and diagnoses are

62

restricted to specific patient populations. This delay from intervention to incidence

63

reduction, combined with the variety and simultaneous implementation of

64

interventions4,5, complicates the identification of their individual effects.

65

Unlike epidemiological case counts, viral genomes bear phylogenetic information

66

relevant to disease transmission. Extracting this information is the goal of

67

phylodynamics, which relies on evolutionary theory and bioinformatics to model the

68

dynamics of an epidemic11. The dates of viral transmission events can also be inferred

69

from genome sequences to alleviate, at least in part, the problems of delayed detection

Fig. 1. Conceptual overview of phylodynamic survival analysis. Under the
assumption that each viral lineage in a phylogeny belongs to an infected patient, the
dates of viral transmission and sampling events in a transmission tree (a) coincide with
the dates of divergence events (nodes) and tips, respectively, of the dated phylogeny
reconstructed from the viral genomes (b). Treating viral transmission as the event of
interest for survival modelling, internal branches connecting two divergence events are
interpreted as time-to-event intervals while terminal branches, that do not end with a
transmission event, are interpreted as censored intervals (c). Translating the dated
phylogeny in terms of survival events enables visualizing the probability of transmission
through time as a Kaplan-Meier curve (d) and modelling the transmission rate using
Cox proportional hazards regression.

Survival modelling of viral transmission

101

The dissemination and detection of a virus in a population can be described as a

102

transmission tree (Fig. 1a) whose shape reflects that of the dated phylogeny of the

103

sampled pathogens (Fig. 1b). In a phylodynamic context, it is assumed that each

104

lineage, represented by a branch in the phylogenetic tree, belongs to a single patient

105

and that lineage divergence events, represented by tree nodes, coincide with

106

transmission events11. Thus, branches in a dated phylogeny represent intervals of time

107

between divergence events interpreted as transmission events. This situation can be

108

translated in terms of survival analysis, which models rates of event occurrence, by

109

considering divergence as the event of interest and by treating branch lengths as time-

110

to-event intervals (Fig. 1c, d). Phylogenetic survival analysis was devised by E. Paradis

111

and applied to detecting temporal variations in the divergence rate of tanagers 12 or

112

fishes15, but it has not been applied to pathogens so far13,16,17.

113

To quantify the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the transmission

114

rate of COVID-19, we adapted the original model in the Paradis study 12 to account for

115

the specific setting of viral phylodynamics (see Methods). Hereafter, we refer to the

116

modified model as phylodynamic survival analysis. In survival analysis terms, we

117

interpret internal branches of the phylogeny (those that end with a transmission event)

118

as time-to-event intervals and terminal branches (those that end with a sampling event)

119

as censored intervals (Fig. 1c; see Methods).

120

The predictors of interest in our setting, namely, the non-pharmaceutical

121

interventions, vary both through time and across lineages depending on their

122

geographic location. To model this, we assigned each divergence event (and

123

subsequent branch) to a country using maximum-likelihood ancestral state

124

reconstruction. Each assigned branch was then associated with the set of non-

125

pharmaceutical interventions that were active or not in the country during the interval

126

spanned by the branch. Intervals containing a change of intervention were split into

127

subintervals18. These (sub)intervals were the final observations (statistical units) used in

128

the survival models. Models were adjusted for the hierarchical dependency structure

129

introduced by interval splits and country assignations (see Methods).

130

Phylodynamic survival models estimate variations of the reproduction number

131

The evolution of lineages in a dated viral phylogeny can be described as a birth-death

132

process with a divergence (or birth) rate ùúÜ and an extinction (or death) rate ùúá 19. In a

133

phylodynamic context, the effective reproduction number ùëÖ equals the ratio of the

134

divergence and extinction rates19. Coefficients of phylodynamic survival models (the so-

135

called hazard ratios of divergence; see Methods) act as multiplicative factors of the

136

divergence rate ùúÜ, independent of the true value of ùúÜ which needs not be specified nor

137

evaluated. As ùëÖ = ùúÜ‚ÅÑùúá , multiplying ùúÜ by a coefficient also multiplies ùëÖ , independent of

138

the true value of ùúá. Thus, coefficients of phylodynamic survival models estimate

139

variations of ùëÖ in response to predictor variables without requiring external knowledge

140

or assumptions about ùúÜ and ùúá.

Variations in COVID-19 transmission rates across countries

161

We assembled a composite dataset by combining a dated phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2

162

(Fig. 2a), publicly available from Nextstrain20 and built from the GISAID initiative data21,

163

with a detailed timeline of non-pharmaceutical interventions available from the Oxford

164

COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)22. Extended Data Fig. 1 shows a

165

flowchart outlining the data sources, sample sizes and selection steps of the study.

166

Phylogenetic and intervention data covered the early phase of the epidemic up to May

167

4, 2020.

168

The 5,198 SARS-CoV-2 genomes used to reconstruct the dated phylogeny were

169

collected from 74 countries. Detailed per-country data including sample sizes are shown

170

in Extended Data Table 1. Among the 10,394 branches in the phylogeny, 2,162

171

branches (20.8%) could not be assigned to a country with >95% confidence and were

172

excluded, also reducing the number of represented countries from 74 to 59 (Extended

173

Data Fig. 1; a comparison of included and excluded branches is shown in Extended

174

Data Fig. 2). The remaining 4,025 internal branches had a mean time-to-event (delay

175

between transmission events) of 4.4 days (Fig. 2b). These data were congruent with

176

previous estimates of the mean serial interval of COVID-19 ranging from 3.1 days to 7.5

177

days23. The 4,207 terminal branches had a mean time-to-censoring (delay from infection

178

to detection) of 10.6 days (Fig. 2a, b). This pattern of longer terminal vs. internal

179

branches is typical of a viral population in fast expansion 11.

180

We compared the timing and dynamics of COVID-19 spread in countries

181

represented in our dataset (Fig. 2c, d), pooling countries with <10 assigned

182

transmission events into an ‚Äòothers‚Äô category. The estimated date of the first local

183

transmission event in each country showed good concordance with the reported dates

184

of the epidemic onset (Pearson correlation = 0.84; Extended Data Fig. 3). The relative

185

effective reproduction number ùëÖ per country, taking China as reference, ranged from -

186

55.6% (95%CI, -71.4% to -29.9%) in Luxembourg to +11.7% (95% CI, -6.7% to +33.8%)

187

in Spain (Fig. 2c). Notice that these estimates are averages over variations of ùëÖ

188

through time in each country, up to May 4, 2020. Exemplary survival curves of

transmission events are shown in Fig. 2e, f. Relative ùëÖ ‚Äôs are not expected to

190

necessarily correlate with the reported counts of COVID-19 cases across all countries

191

due to the confounding effects of population sizes, case detection policies and the

substantially correlated with the reported cumulative counts up to May 12 (Fig. 2g, h),

218

Disentangling the individual effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions

219

The implementation and release dates of large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions

220

against COVID-19 were available for 57 countries out of the 59 represented in the dated

221

phylogeny. Definitions of the selected interventions are shown in Table 1. Branches

222

assigned to countries with missing intervention data, namely, Latvia and Senegal, were

223

excluded from further analysis (n=22/8,262 (0.3%); see Extended Data Fig. 1). Up to

224

May 4, 2020, the interventions most universally implemented were information

225

campaigns, restrictions on international travel and education lockdown (>95% of

226

countries) (Extended Data Fig. 4). The least frequent were the closure of public

227

transportation (35%) and home containment (72%). Public information campaigns came

228

first and home containment came last (median delay across countries, 5 days before

229

and 24 days after the first local transmission event, respectively; Fig. 3a). Survival

230

curves for each intervention are shown in Extended Data Fig. 5. Most interventions

231

were implemented in combination and accumulated over time rather than replacing

232

each other (Extended Data Fig. 4; median delays between interventions are shown in

233

Extended Data Fig. 6; correlations in Extended Data Fig. 7; and a detailed timeline of

234

interventions in Extended Data Table 2). However, we observed a substantial

235

heterogeneity of intervention timing across the 57 countries (Fig. 3a), suggesting that

236

individual intervention effects can be discriminated by multivariable analysis given the

237

large sample size (n=8,210 subintervals).

238

A multivariable phylogenetic survival model, including the 9 interventions and

239

controlling for between-country ùëÖ variations (see Methods), showed a strong fit to the

240

data (likelihood-ratio test compared to the null model, P < 10 -196). In this model, the

241

interventions most strongly and independently associated with a reduction of the

242

effective reproduction number ùëÖ of SARS-CoV-2 were home containment (ùëÖ percent

243

change, -34.6%, 95%CI, -43.2 to -24.7%), education lockdown (-25.6%, 95%CI, -33.4 to

244

-16.9%), restricting gatherings (-22.3%, 95%CI, -33.4 to -9.4%) and international travel

245

(-16.9%, 95%CI, -27.5 to -4.8%). We failed to detect a substantial impact of other

246

interventions, namely information campaigns, cancelling public events, closing

workplaces, restricting internal movement, and closing public transportation (Fig. 3b).

248

Based on coefficient estimates, all interventions were independently predicted to reduce

249

ùëÖ (even by a negligible amount), in line with the intuition that no intervention should

250

accelerate the epidemic. Contrasting with previous approaches that constrained

251

coefficients5, this intuition was not enforced a priori in our multivariable model, in which

252

positive coefficients (increasing ùëÖ ) might have arisen due to noise or collinearity

253

between interventions. The absence of unexpectedly positive coefficients suggests that

254

our model correctly captured the epidemic slowdown that accompanied the

255

accumulation of interventions.

256

Estimated intervention effects are robust to time-dependent confounders and

257

collinearity

258

A reduction of ùëÖ through time, independent of the implementation of interventions,

259

might lead to overestimate their effect in our model. Several potential confounders might

260

reduce ùëÖ through time but cannot be precisely estimated and included as control

261

covariates. These included the progressive acquisition of herd immunity, the so-called

262

artificial diversification slowdown possibly caused by incomplete sampling, and time-

263

dependent variations of the sampling effort (see Methods). To quantify this potential

264

time-dependent bias, we constructed an additional model including the age of each

265

branch as a covariate (Extended Data Table 1). The coefficients in this time-adjusted

266

model only differed by small amounts compared to the base model. Moreover, the

267

ranking by effectiveness of the major interventions remained unchanged, indicating that

268

our estimates were robust to time-dependent confounders.

269

We also quantified the sensitivity of the estimated intervention effects to the

270

inclusion of other interventions (collinearity) by excluding interventions one by one in 9

271

additional models (Fig. 3c). This pairwise interaction analysis confirmed that most of the

272

estimated effects were strongly independent. Residual interferences were found for

273

gathering restrictions, whose full-model effect of -22.3% was reinforced to -33.5% when

274

ignoring home containment; and for cancelling public events, whose full-model effect of

275

-0.97% was reinforced to -15.1% when ignoring gathering restrictions. These residual

interferences make epidemiological sense because home containment prevents

Simulating intervention effectiveness in an idealized population

284

To facilitate the interpretation of our estimates of the effectiveness of interventions

285

against COVID-19, we simulated each intervention‚Äôs impact on the peak number of

286

cases, whose reduction is critical to prevent overwhelming the healthcare system (Fig.

287

3d and Extended Data Fig. 8). We used compartmental Susceptible-Infected-Recovered

288

(SIR) models with a basic reproduction number ùëÖ = 3 and a mean infectious period of

289

2 weeks based on previous estimates24,25, in an idealized population of 1 million

290

susceptible individuals (see Methods). In each model, we simulated the implementation

291

of a single intervention at a date chosen to reflect the median delay across countries

292

(Fig. 3a) relative to the epidemic onset (see Methods). On implementation date, the

293

effective reproduction number was immediately reduced according to the estimated

294

intervention‚Äôs effect shown in Fig. 3b.

295

In this idealized setting, home containment, independent of all other restrictions,

296

only halved the peak number of cases from 3.0x10 5 to 1.5x105 (95% CI, 1.0x105 to

297

2.0x105) (Fig. 3d). However, a realistic implementation of home containment also

298

implies other restrictions including, at least, restrictions on movements, gatherings, and

299

public events. This combination resulted in a relative ùëÖ of -50.8% (95% CI, -59.4% to -

300

40.2%) and a 5-fold reduction of the peak number of cases to 6.0x10 4 (95% CI, 1.9x104

301

to 1.2x105). Nevertheless, if ùëÖ = 3 then a 50% reduction is still insufficient to reduce ùëÖ

302

below 1 and stop the epidemic. This suggests that even when considering the most

303

stringent interventions, combinations may be required. To further examine this issue, we

304

estimated the effect of accumulating interventions by their average chronological order

305

shown in Fig. 3a, from information campaigns alone to all interventions combined

306

including home containment (Fig. 3e). Strikingly, only the combination of all

307

interventions completely stopped the epidemic under our assumed value of ùëÖ . To

308

estimate the effectiveness of combined interventions in other epidemic settings, we

309

computed the probabilities of reducing ùëÖ below 1 for values of ùëÖ ranging from 1.5 to

310

3.5 (Table 2; see Methods). The same probabilities for individual interventions are

311

presented in Table S2, showing that no single intervention would stop the epidemic if

312

ùëÖ ‚â• 2. These results may help inform decisions on the appropriate stringency of the

313

restrictions required to control the epidemic under varying transmission regimes.

Discussion

316

We present a phylodynamic analysis of how the divergence rate and reproduction

317

number of SARS-CoV-2 varies in response to large-scale non-pharmaceutical

318

interventions in 57 countries. Our results suggest that no single intervention, including

319

home containment, is sufficient on its own to stop the epidemic (ùëÖ < 1). Increasingly

320

stringent combinations of interventions may be required depending on the effective

321

reproduction number.

322

Home containment was repeatedly estimated to be the most effective response

323

in epidemiological studies from China26, France27, the UK28, and Europe5. Other studies

324

modelled the additional (or residual) reduction of ùëÖ by an intervention after taking into

325

account those previously implemented4,6,10. Possibly because home containment was

326

the last implemented intervention in many countries (Fig. 2a), these studies reported a

327

weaker or even negligible additional effect compared to earlier interventions. In our

328

study, home containment, even when implemented last, had the strongest independent

329

impact on epidemic spread (ùëÖ percent change, -34.6%), which was further amplified (-

330

50.8%) when taking into account implicit restrictions on movements, gatherings and

331

public events.

332

We found that education lockdown substantially decreased COVID-19 spread (ùëÖ

333

percent change, -25.6%). Contrasting with home containment, the effectiveness of

334

education lockdown has been more hotly debated. This intervention ranked among the

335

most effective ones in two international studies 4,6 but had virtually no effect on

336

transmission in other reports from Europe 5,10. Young children have been estimated to be

337

poor spreaders of COVID-19 and less susceptible than adults to develop disease after

338

an infectious contact, counteracting the effect of their higher contact rate 29,30. However,

339

the relative susceptibility to infection was shown to increase sharply between 15 and 25

340

years, suggesting that older students might be more involved in epidemic spread 30.

341

Importantly, we could not differentiate the effect of closing schools and universities

342

because both closures coincided in all countries. Thus, our finding that education

343

lockdowns reduce COVID-19 transmission might be driven by contact rate reductions in
17

344

older students rather than in children, as hypothesized elsewhere 4. This raises the

345

question of whether education lockdown should be adapted to age groups, considering

346

that: (1), education lockdown had a sizeable impact on COVID-19 transmission in our

347

study and others4,6; (2), this impact might be preferentially driven by older students 29,30;

348

and (3) autonomous distance learning might be more effective in university students 31

349

compared to younger children who require parental presence and supervision following

350

school closure, possibly widening the gap for children from under-resourced

351

backgrounds32. Based on these elements, we speculate that closing universities, but not

352

elementary schools, might strike the right balance between efficacy and social impact.

353

Restrictions on gatherings of >100 persons appeared more effective than

354

cancelling public events (ùëÖ percent changes, -22.3% vs. -1.0%, respectively) in our

355

phylodynamic model, in line with previous results from epidemiological models 4.

356

Notwithstanding that gathering restrictions prohibit public events, possibly causing

357

interferences between estimates (Fig. 3c), this finding is intriguing. Indeed, several

358

public events resulted in large case clusters, the so-called superspreading events, that

359

triggered epidemic bursts in France33, South Korea34 or the U.S.35. A plausible

360

explanation for not detecting the effectiveness of cancelling public events is that data-

361

driven models, including ours, better capture the cumulative effect of more frequent

362

events such as gatherings than the massive effect of much rarer events such as

363

superspreading public events. This bias towards ignoring the so-called ‚ÄòBlack Swan‚Äô

364

exceptional events36 suggests that our findings (and others‚Äô4) regarding restrictions on

365

public events should not be interpreted as an encouragement to relax these restrictions

366

but as a potential limit of modelling approaches (but see 37).

367

There are other limitations to our study, including its retrospective design. Similar

368

to previous work6, we did not consider targeted non-pharmaceutical interventions that

369

are difficult to date and quantify, such as contact tracing or case isolation policies. Data

370

were analyzed at the national level, although much virus transmission was often

371

concentrated in specific areas and some non-pharmaceutical interventions were

372

implemented at the sub-national level38. Our phylogeographic inferences did not

373

consider the travel history of patients, whose inclusion in Bayesian models was recently

374

shown to alleviate sampling bias39. From a statistical standpoint, the interval lengths in

375

the dated phylogeny were treated as fixed quantities in the survival models. Ignoring the

376

uncertainty of the estimated lengths might underestimate the width of confidence

377

intervals, although this is unlikely to have biased the pointwise estimates and the

378

ranking of interventions‚Äô effects. The number of genomes included by country did not

379

necessarily reflect the true number of cases, which might have influenced country

380

comparison results in Fig. 2, but not intervention effectiveness models in Fig. 3 which

381

were adjusted for between-country variations of ùëÖ . Finally, our estimates represent

382

averages over many countries with different epidemiological contexts, healthcare

383

systems, cultural behaviors and nuances in intervention implementation details and

384

population compliance. This global approach, similar to previous work 4,6, facilitates

385

unifying the interpretation of intervention effectiveness, but this interpretation still needs

386

to be adjusted to local contexts by policy makers.

387

Beyond the insights gained into the impact of interventions against COVID-19,

388

our findings highlight how phylodynamic survival analysis can help leverage pathogen

389

sequence data to estimate epidemiological parameters. Contrasting with the Bayesian

390

approaches adopted by most, if not all, previous assessments of intervention

391

effectiveness4,5,8, phylodynamic survival analysis does not require any quantitative prior

392

assumption or constraint on model parameters. The method should also be simple to

393

implement and extend by leveraging the extensive software arsenal of survival

394

modelling. Phylodynamic survival analysis may complement epidemiological models as

395

pathogen sequences accumulate, allowing to address increasingly complex questions

396

relevant to public health strategies.

METHODS

399

Definitions and chronology of non-pharmaceutical interventions

400

The nature, stringency and timing of non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-

401

19 have been collected and aggregated daily since January 1, 2020 by the Oxford

402

COVID-19 Government Response Tracker initiative of the Blavatnik School of

403

Government, UK4,22. As of May 12, 2020, the interventions are grouped into three

404

categories, namely: closures and containment (8 indicators), economic measures (4

405

indicators) and health measures (5 indicators). Indicators use 2- to 4-level ordinal scales

406

to represent each intervention‚Äôs stringency, and an additional flag indicating whether the

407

intervention is localized or general. Details of the coding methods for indicators can be

408

found in40. We focused on large-scale interventions against transmission that did not

409

target specific patients (for instance, we did not consider contact tracing) and we

410

excluded economic and health interventions except for information campaigns. This

411

rationale led to the selection of the 9 indicators shown in Table 1. To facilitate

412

interpretation while constraining model complexity, the ordinal-scale indicators in

413

OxCGRT data were recoded as binary variables in which we only considered

414

government requirements (as opposed to recommendations) where applicable. We did

415

not distinguish between localized and nation-wide interventions because localized

416

interventions, especially in larger countries, targeted the identified epidemic hotspots.

417

As the data did not allow to differentiate closures of schools and universities, we use the

418

term ‚Äòeducation lockdown‚Äô (as opposed to ‚Äòschool closure‚Äô in 22) to avoid

419

misinterpretation regarding the education levels concerned.

420

Phylodynamic survival analysis in measurably evolving populations

421

The original phylogenetic survival model in12 and its later extensions41 considered

422

intervals backward in time, from the tips to the root of the tree, and were restricted to

423

trees with all tips sampled at the same date relative to the root (ultrametric trees).

424

Censored intervals (intervals that do not end with an event) in 12 were used to represent

425

lineages with known sampling date but unknown age. In contrast, viral samples in
20

426

ongoing epidemics such as COVID-19 are typically collected through time. A significant

427

evolution of the viruses during the sampling period violates the ultrametric assumption.

428

To handle phylogenies of these so-called measurably evolving populations 42, we

429

propose a different interpretation of censoring compared to 12. Going forward in time, the

430

internal branches of a tree connect two divergence events while terminal branches,

431

those that end with a tip, connect a divergence event and a sampling event (Fig. 1b).

432

Thus, we considered internal branches as time-to-event intervals and terminal branches

433

as censored intervals representing the minimal duration during which no divergence

434

occurred (Fig. 1c).

435

SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic data

436

SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been continuously submitted to the Global

437

Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) by laboratories worldwide 21. To

438

circumvent the computational limits of phylogeny reconstruction and time calibration

439

techniques, the sequences of the GISAID database are subsampled before analysis by

440

the Nextstrain initiative, using a balanced subsampling scheme through time and

441

space20,43. Phylogenetic reconstruction uses maximum-likelihood phylogenetic inference

442

based on IQ-TREE44 and time-calibration uses TreeTime45. See46 for further details on

443

the Nextstrain bioinformatics pipeline. A dated phylogeny of 5,211 SARS-CoV-2

444

genomes, along with sampling dates and locations, was retrieved from

445

nextstrain.org/ncov on May 12, 2020. Genomes of non-human origin (n = 13) were

446

discarded from analysis. Polytomies (unresolved divergences represented as a node

447

with >2 descendants) were resolved as branches with an arbitrarily small length of 1

448

hour, as recommended for adjustment of zero-length risk intervals in Cox regression 47.

449

Of note, excluding these zero-length branches would bias the analysis by

450

underestimating the number of divergence events in specific regions of the phylogeny.

451

Maximum-likelihood ancestral state reconstruction was used to assign internal nodes of

452

the phylogeny to countries in a probabilistic fashion, taking the tree shape and sampling

453

locations as input data48. To prepare data for survival analysis, we decomposed the

454

branches of the dated phylogeny into a set of time-to-event and time-to-censoring

455

intervals (Fig. 1c). Intervals were assigned to the most likely country at the origin of the

456

branch when this country‚Äôs likelihood was >0.95. Intervals in which no country reached

457

a likelihood of 0.95 were excluded from further analysis (Extended Data Figs. 1, 2).

458

Finally, intervals during which a change of intervention occurred were split into sub-

459

intervals, such that all covariates, including the country and interventions, were held

460

constant within each sub-interval and only the last subinterval of an internal branch was

461

treated as a time-to-event interval. This interval-splitting approach is consistent with an

462

interpretation of interventions as external time-dependent covariates 18, which are not

463

dependent on the event under study, namely, the viral divergence event.

464

Mixed-effect Cox proportional hazard models

465

Variations of the divergence rate ùúÜ in response to non-pharmaceutical interventions

466

were modelled using mixed-effect Cox proportional hazard regression (reviewed in 49).

467

Models treated the country and phylogenetic branch as random effects to account for

468

non-independence between sub-intervals of the same branch and between branches

469

assigned to the same country. The predictors of interest were not heritable traits of

470

SARS-CoV-2, thus, phylogenetic autocorrelation between intervals was not corrected

471

for. Time-to-event data were visualized using Kaplan-Meier curves with 95% confidence

472

intervals. The regression models had the form

473

ùúÜ (ùë°) = ùúÜ (ùë°) ‚ãÖ exp(ùëã ‚ãÖ ùõΩ + ùõº + ùõæ )

474

where ùúÜ (ùë°) is the hazard function (here, the divergence rate) at time ùë° for the ùëñth

475

observation, ùúÜ (ùë°) is the baseline hazard function, which is neither specified or explicitly

476

evaluated, ùëã is the set of predictors of the ùëñth observation (the binary vector of active

477

non-pharmaceutical interventions), ùõΩ is the vector of fixed-effect coefficients, ùõº is the

478

random intercept associated with the ùëóth phylogenetic branch and ùõæ is the random

479

intercept associated with the ùëòth country. Country comparison models (Fig. 2d), in

480

which the country was the only predictor and branches were not divided into

481

subintervals, did not include random intercepts. Raw model coefficients (the log-hazard

482

ratios) additively shift the logarithm of the divergence rate ùúÜ. Exponentiated coefficients

483

exp ùõΩ (the hazard ratios) are multiplicative factors (fold-changes) of the divergence rate.

484

To ease interpretation, hazard ratios were reported as percentage changes of the

485

divergence rate or, equivalently, of the effective reproduction number ùëÖ , equal to

486

(exp ùõΩ ‚àí 1) √ó 100. Analyses were conducted using R 3.6.1 (the R Foundation for

487

Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) with additional packages ape, survival and

488

coxme.

489

Estimating the effect of combined interventions

490

Pointwise estimates and confidence intervals of combined interventions were estimated

491

by adding individual coefficients and their variance-covariances. Cox regression

492

coefficients have approximately normal distribution with mean vector ùëö and variance-

493

covariance matrix ùëâ, estimated from the inverse Hessian matrix of the likelihood

494

function evaluated at ùëö. From well-known properties of the normal distribution, the

495

distribution of a sum of normal deviates is normal with mean equal to the sum of the

496

means and variance equal to the sum of the variance-covariance matrix of the deviates.

497

Thus, the coefficient corresponding to a sum of coefficients with mean ùëö and variance ùëâ

498

has mean ‚àëùëö and variance ‚àëùëâ, from which we derive the point estimates and

499

confidence intervals of a combination of predictors. Importantly, summing over the

500

covariances captures the correlation between coefficients when estimating the

501

uncertainty of the combined coefficient.

502

Probability of stopping an epidemic

503

A central question regarding the effectiveness of interventions or combinations thereof

504

is whether their implementation can stop an epidemic by reducing ùëÖ below 1 (Table 2).

505

Suppose that some intervention has an estimated log-hazard ratio ùõΩ . ùõΩ has

506

approximately normal distribution with mean ùõΩ and variance ùúé , written ùõΩ ‚àº ùëÅ(ùõΩ, ùúé ).

507

For some fixed value of ùëÖ , the estimated post-intervention reproduction number ùëÖ =

508

ùëÖ ‚ãÖ exp ùõΩ . The probability ùëù that ùëÖ < 1 is ‚à´

509

density function. To solve the integral, remark that log ùëÖ = log ùëÖ + ùõΩ ‚àº ùëÅ log ùëÖ +

ùëë ùëÖ

d log ùëÖ = Œ¶ 0 log ùëÖ + ùõΩ , ùúé ,

513

where Œ¶ is the cumulative density function of the normal distribution with mean log ùëÖ +

514

ùõΩ and variance ùúé . By integrating over the coefficient distribution, this method explicitly

515

considers the estimation uncertainty of ùõΩ when estimating ùëù.

516

Potential time-dependent confounders

517

Time-dependent phylodynamic survival analysis assumes that variations of branch

518

lengths though time directly reflect variations of the divergence rate, which implies that

519

branch lengths are conditionally independent of time given the divergence rate. When

520

the phylogeny is reconstructed from a fraction of the individuals, as is the case in

521

virtually all phylodynamic studies including ours, this conditional independence

522

assumption can be violated. This is because incomplete sampling increases the length

523

of more recent branches relative to older branches 50, an effect called the diversification

524

slowdown51,52. Noteworthy, this effect can be counteracted by a high extinction rate 17,50,

525

which is expected in our setting and mimicks an acceleration of diversification.

526

Moreover, whether the diversification slowdown should be interpreted as a pure artifact

527

has been controversial52,53. Notwithstanding, we considered incomplete sampling as a

528

potential source of bias in our analyses because a diversification slowdown might lead

529

to an overestimation of the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Additionally, the

530

selection procedure used by Nextstrain to collect genomes included in the dated

531

phylogeny possibly amplified the diversification slowdown by using a higher sampling

532

fraction in earlier phases of the epidemic43. To verify whether the conclusions of our

533

models were robust to this potential bias, we built an additional multivariable model

534

including the estimated date of each divergence event (the origin of the branch) as a

535

covariate. The possible relation between time and the divergence rate is expectedly

536

non-linear50 and coefficient variations resulting from controlling for time were moderate

537

(Extended Data Table 1), thus, we refrained from including a time covariate in the

538

reported regression models as this might lead to overcontrol. Further research is

539

warranted to identify an optimal function of time that might be included as a covariate in

540

phylodynamic survival models to control for sources of diversification slowdown.

541

Compartmental epidemiological models

542

Epidemic dynamics can be described by partitioning a population of size ùëÅ into three

543

compartments, the susceptible hosts ùëÜ, the infected hosts ùêº, and the recovered hosts ùëÖ.

544

The infection rate ùëè governs the transitions from ùëÜ to ùêº and the recovery rate ùëî governs

545

the transitions from ùêº to ùëÖ (we avoid the standard notation ùõΩ and ùõæ for infection and

546

recovery rates to prevent confusion with Cox model parameters). The SIR model

547

describes the transition rates between compartments as a set of differential equations

548

with respect to time ùë°,

549
550

dùëÜ
= ‚àíùëèùëÜùêº,
dùë°

dùêº
= ùëèùëÜùêº ‚àí ùëîùêº,
dùë°

dùëÖ
= ùëîùêº.
dùë°

The transition rates of the SIR model define the basic reproduction number of the

551

epidemic, ùëÖ = ùëè/ùëî. From a phylodynamic standpoint, if the population dynamics of a

552

pathogen is described as a birth-death model with divergence rate ùúÜ and extinction rate

553

ùúá, then ùëÖ = ùúÜ‚ÅÑùúá or, alternatively, ùëÖ =

554

impact of each individual intervention in SIR models with ùëÖ = 3 and ùëî

555

based on previous estimates24,25, yielding a baseline infection rate ùëè = ùëîùëÖ = 6. In each

556

model, the effective infection rate changed from ùëè to ùëè ‚ãÖ exp ùõΩ on the implementation

557

date of an intervention with log-hazard ratio ùõΩ. To determine realistic implementation

558

delays, the starting time of the simulation was set at the date of the first local divergence

559

event in each country and the implementation date was set to the observed median

560

delay across countries (see Fig. 3a). All models started with 100 infected individuals at

561

ùë° = 0, a value assumed to reflect the number of unobserved cases at the date of the

562

first divergence event, based on the temporality between the divergence events and the

563

reported cases (Extended Data Fig. 3) and on a previous estimate from the U.S.

+ 154. We simulated the epidemiological

Extended Data Figure 5. Non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 correlate
with reduced effective reproduction numbers. Data derive from a dated phylogeny of SARSCoV-2 genomes from 57 countries, with 4,191 internal branches interpreted as time-to-event
intervals, and 4,019 terminal branches interpreted as censored intervals, after exclusion of
branches with uncertain country assignation. Shown are Kaplan-Meier survival curves of the
waiting time without a viral transmission event, stratified on the presence of nine nonpharmaceutical interventions active or not in each country. Sample sizes denote, for each
stratum, the no. of time-to-event subintervals (possibly resulting from splitting intervals
containing a change of intervention) and, in brackets, the no. of censored subintervals. Percent
changes of the effective reproduction number ùëÖ were derived from separate time-dependent
mixed-effect Cox regression models treating the country and the branch as random effects.

Extended Data Figure 7. Pearson correlation between non-pharmaceutical interventions.
Data derive from 14,829 sub-intervals, including 4,019 time-to-event sub-intervals and 10,810
censored sub-intervals. Sub-intervals result from splitting phylogenetic branches (n = 8,210) in
which a change of intervention (activation or release) occurs. Smaller absolute correlations
(white) favor the identifiability of intervention effects in multivariable analysis while larger
absolute correlations (orange/red) can result into dependencies between model coefficients
(see Fig. 3c).

Extended Data Figure 8. Predicted individual impact of 9 non-pharmaceutical
interventions (NPIs) on the number of simultaneous COVID-19 cases in an idealized
population of 1 million susceptible individuals. Gray lines represent the case count
predicted by an epidemiological SIR model with a basic reproduction number ùëÖ = 3, as
estimated in the absence of NPIs, and a mean infectious period of 2 weeks. For each NPI, the
simultaneous case count (red line) and 95% confidence band are derived from an SIR model in
which the basic reproduction number is altered as predicted by the mutivariate model
coefficients shown in Fig. 3b. The delay between the 100th case and NPI implementation in SIR
models coincides with the median delay between the 1st transmission event and the NPI
implementation shown in Fig. 3a.
