Abstract
The increasingly evident role of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission means testing is central to COVID-19 control, but test sensitivity
estimates are low (around 65%). We extend an existing branching process contact tracing model, adding diagnostic testing and refining parameter
estimates. Poor test sensitivity potentially reduces the efficacy of contact
tracing, due to false-negative results impacting quarantine. We show that,
counter-intuitively, faster testing could also reduce operational test sensitivity, exacerbating this effect. If sensitivity-based risks are mitigated, we find
that contact tracing can facilitate control, but small changes in the population reproduction number (1·3 to 1·5) could impact contact tracing feasibility.

Main
In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus strain, was detected
in Hubei Province, China [1]. By 31st January 2020 the first UK cases of
COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, were confirmed [2]. Initial modelling studies indicated that fast and effective contact tracing could
contain the UK outbreak in most settings [3, 4]. However, by 20th March
there were almost 4,000 confirmed cases nationwide [5], at which point the
UK Government halted national contact tracing and scaled up physical distancing measures, including the closure of schools and social venues, extending to heightened restrictions on non-essential travel, outdoor activities
and between-household social mixing [6]. Similar patterns occurred in other
countries [7, 8].
By early May 2020 these measures were estimated to have reduced the
effective reproduction number, R, from 2·6 to 0·62 [9, 10] and so from 12th–
13th May in England some limitations on outdoor exercise were lifted and
workers encouraged to return to work if they could maintain physical distancing [11].
Capacity for diagnostic testing in the UK, as in other countries, has been
escalated over recent months, with capacity reaching over 300,000 tests a day
by the end of June (https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/testing). Currently, testing of asymptomatic individuals is limited to staff and patients
in NHS and social care facilities [12], but on the 28th of May the UK Government rolled out the initial stages of their ‘Test & Trace’ contact tracing
programme to the general population, which aims to follow chains of transmission and use isolation to prevent onward spread. Since the beginning of
‘Test & Trace’ over 3 million people were tested by the end of July, just under
50,000 of which were positive [13].
Crucially, the current strategy only tests symptomatic contacts and notifies individuals that they no longer need to isolate following a negative test,
which comes back in 24 or 48 hours depending on type of test [13]. However,
there are critical limitations to the diagnostic test, with poor sensitivity (current estimates imply close to 65% [14, 15]), especially in community-based
settings, leading to high false negative rates which are exacerbated by high
variability in symptom severity [15]. Infectious individuals who test falsely
negative may prematurely resume their normal activities, contributing to
ongoing chains of transmission: reliance on testing of contacts will always
reduce the effectiveness of contact tracing, potentially substantially [16].

Imperfect adherence and the innate difficulties in identifying contacts will
pose challenges for ‘Test & Trace’, particularly in crowded urban settings [17].
Therefore, evaluating both the limitations of contact tracing and how to
maximise its effectiveness could be crucial in preventing an exponential rise in
cases, which might see contact tracing capacity rapidly exceeded and stricter
physical distancing measures required [18].
As our knowledge of the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 grows,
extending Hellewell et al.’s [3] UK-focused contact tracing study with new
insights could inform this ‘Test & Trace’ strategy. The key conclusion of the
initial study was that highly effective contact tracing would be sufficient to
control an initial outbreak of COVID-19 in the UK, however substantial new
evidence supports much higher pre- and asymptomatic transmission rates
than had initially been considered [19, 20, 21]. The focus on rapid testing
in the UK contact tracing programme also requires a detailed assessment of
the associated trade-offs through mechanistic modelling of the testing process. Up-to-date modelling studies are therefore needed to investigate the
feasibility of contact tracing and the conditions under which it is effective.
We use improved incubation period and serial interval estimates [22, 23,
24], consider imperfect self-reporting and tracing rates and simulate the use
of diagnostic tests for both detection and tracing of asymptomatic infection
chains. We also simulate decision-making regarding quarantine procedures
for traced individuals and explore the trade-offs introduced by poor test sensitivity, particularly when negative test results are used to advise individuals
to cease self-isolation.

By comparing the time individuals are tested after exposure in the model
to temporal estimates of PCR test sensitivity [15] we see that an average of
65% sensitivity is a relatively realistic expectation if testing is conducted 2 or
more days post-isolation (Figure 1a). Test sensitivity is expected to peak at
just over 75% 8 days post-exposure, but the majority of testing in the model
occurs between 4 and 7 days post-exposure, where sensitivity estimates have
more variance.
In the case of a 2 day testing delay, 29·3% of cases are tested before 5 days
post-exposure, at which point sensitivity estimates are around 62%, and only

10·2% of cases are tested before 4 days post-exposure. The time-weighted
average of expected test sensitivity for all cases tested in the model with a 2
day delay is 68·0%. For a 4 day test delay, less than 1% of cases are tested
before day 5 post-exposure, but just under 10% are tested after day 14, when
test sensitivity drops to 61%.
However, in the case of immediate testing, 65% sensitivity could be a
substantial over-estimate, with 64·5% of cases being tested before 5 days
post-exposure and 48·9% before 4 days, meaning the test could be less than
33% sensitive for around half of all cases tested.
Even if test sensitivity was constant, the timing of testing and quarantine
duration has an impact on the risk of a large outbreak (at least 2,000 cases)
and can undermine the positive impact of testing within a contact tracing
programme. The probability of a large outbreak occurring is greater with
an assumed test sensitivity of 65% compared to scenarios where no testing
was carried out at all if testing is rapid and results in an immediate return
to normal behaviour (Figure 1b, upper left panel). This result was observed
across all contact tracing coverage rates. The deleterious effect of releasing
false negative cases is mitigated by using a precautionary seven-day quarantine period, which reduced the risk of a large outbreak 11·7% to 3·9% for
RS = 1·3 with 60% contact tracing (Figure 1b).
A two day delay in carrying out the tests also led to a decrease in the
probability of a large outbreak, from 11·7% to 6·3% for RS of 1·3. Combining
the two-day delay in testing and the seven-day precautionary quarantine
reduced the risk of a large outbreak further, from 11·7% to 3·4% for RS =
1·3 and 60% contact tracing.
In the case of instant testing and an immediate end to quarantine if the
test is negative, there was a comparatively small benefit from scaling up
of contact tracing coverage from 0% to 100%, implying that much of the
potential positive impact of contact tracing could be lost if such an approach
were taken.
Whilst a test with 65% sensitivity and no minimum quarantine period
can reduce the benefits of contact tracing, if a test were to be 95% sensitive,
this would improve the outcome compared to no testing in all scenarios.
However, with a two-day test delay and seven-day precautionary quarantine
a 65% sensitive test is almost as effective in reducing transmission as a 95%
sensitive test due to this strategy ensuring quarantine of all cases during peak
transmission periods irrespective of test result.

Case detection

130

Even with perfect contact tracing and employing good diagnostic practices
(100% of contacts traced in 24 hours and a minimum quarantine period of
7 days), a large proportion of cases are likely to go unobserved (Figure 2).
High levels of symptomatic self-reporting to the tracing programme and improved test sensitivity can increase case detection: 95% sensitivity and 100%
self-reporting gives an increase from 30·5% to 73·9% compared to 65% sensitivity and 50% self-reporting (both for RS = 1.3). However, this still results
in 26·1% of cases being missed, hence detecting every case is essentially infeasible.

Every missed case is a potential new chain of transmission and, given the high
heterogeneity in the secondary case distribution, characterised by dispersion
parameter k, there is a substantial risk of super-spreading events. Considering a scenario with poor adherence to self-reporting guidelines and where
one missed case leads to a cluster of either 5 or 100 new cases, we assume
observation of the outbreak only occurs when the first case is hospitalised,
after which contact tracing may be initiated (Figure 3a and b).
For a cluster of 5 new cases the median total unobserved outbreak size
before the first case is hospitalised is 13 cases for RS = 1·3 and 16 cases for
RS = 1·5, which translates to 8·0% and 36·9% probability of a large outbreak
respectively if 60% contact tracing can be implemented (Figure 3c). For a
cluster of 100 new cases the median is 219 for RS = 1·3 and 238 for RS = 1·5,
translating to 36·3% and 84·9% probability of a large outbreak with 60%
contact tracing. This emphasises the importance of maintaining physical
distancing measures that restrict the attendance of indoor social gatherings
to avoid super-spreading events which could rapidly escalate.

More generally, the probability of a large outbreak given the current outbreak
size (Figure 3c) could be used to assess at what point during an epidemic
contact tracing would be unable to control transmission, as well as to inform
targets for coverage and speed. In our model both the time taken to trace
contacts and the proportion of contacts traced had effects on the risk of a
large outbreak, although increasing tracing speed may have the counter-effect

of reducing average test sensitivity due to impact on test timing with respect
to exposure.
We also found that higher contact tracing coverage results in a lower
overall number of individuals which are traced, tested and quarantined, due
to the lower outbreak size. This means that achieving greater efficacy in
tracing will ultimately require fewer resources. However, these resources are
likely to be needed in a more condensed period of time.

Our results show that with a test sensitivity of 65%, fast testing which recommends infected but false-negative individuals to cease quarantine could be
counter-productive, undermining contact tracing efforts, and may be worse
than not testing. However the impact of low test sensitivity could be mitigated by applying a minimum quarantine period to all traced contacts and
using positive tests to prompt further contact tracing. This would allow
negative individuals to leave quarantine comparatively early, but not immediately upon receipt of test result. Simply slowing down the decision-making
process, so any false negative tests occur later in the infectious period, will
also reduce the amount of transmission caused by premature cessation of
quarantine and potentially increase likelihood of a more accurate test result [15]. Control policies in some countries are being designed to account
for the high proportion of false negative individuals: for instance Greece
requires negative-testing international arrivals to self-quarantine for seven
days [25]; in Singapore two negative tests 24 hours apart are required to
release from quarantine [26].
We show that even a test with low (65%) sensitivity can improve contact
tracing outcomes if the impact of false negative cases can be limited by
employing appropriate precautionary measures. This effect is seen because
testing can bridge asymptomatic links in transmission chains that would
otherwise have been missed, although there is some uncertainty surrounding
the infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals [23]. Nonetheless, this benefit
is only possible, provided testing is applied to all contacts, not just those
displaying symptoms as was the initial UK policy.
Testing asymptomatic contacts would require more testing and resources,
as well as potentially testing individuals earlier in their infectious period,
before symptom onset. Earlier testing increases the impact of immediate
quarantine cessation for false negative cases, so this would require a minimum

quarantine period. Despite these considerations, if very good contact tracing
can be implemented from the beginning of the outbreak then fewer total
resources will be required because of a smaller final outbreak size, meaning
the key factor for feasibility will be time-limited resource access.
We demonstrated that small increases in the reproduction number under physical distancing measures, RS , has a large impact on the feasibility
of contact tracing. We only consider values of RS up to 1·5, which is still
substantially lower than estimates of R0 in the absence of any interventions
(R0 ≈ 2·7 [27]), but may be achievable with partial interventions. Our estimates of RS reflect a decrease in social contacts of almost 50% but even 60%
coverage and a one day trace time is insufficient to negate the risk of a large
outbreak. This reiterates that physical distancing is still critical, even with
highly effective contact tracing, and that contact tracing will likely be insufficient to allow a complete return to normal life without additional measures,
such as an effective vaccine.
In addition to general physical distancing, the risk posed by a single large
super-spreading event means that relaxing restrictions on large gatherings,
particularly indoors, could lead to a rise in case numbers, especially in communities where self-reporting rates are expected to be poor. Even with very
low RS = 1·1, a local cluster of 100 unobserved cases could approximately
double in size before being detected.
However, we found that the risk of a large outbreak (≥2,000 cases) was
relatively low for RS = 1·1 no matter what the contact tracing and testing
strategy. What is of note to national governments who are exiting extreme
social distancing is that a dramatic change in the dynamics occurs in the
small absolute increase of RS to 1·3. At RS = 1·1 with a poorly resourced
or ineffective contact tracing system the probability of a large outbreak is
roughly 1%. However when RS ≥ 1.3 then an ineffective contact tracing
system becomes noticeable, at which stage it is too late to act.
A number of our assumptions may cause our results to appear unduly
optimistic. For example, we model a scenario with very low initial case numbers and assume that tracing can be initiated before test results are received,
and that contacts of up to 3 days pre-onset are traced. This means there
is potentially an increased requirement for maintaining physical distancing
measures, even if contact tracing is deployed at high coverage nationwide.
We also consider the test to have a fixed sensitivity over the course of
infection, whereas previous studies show that testing too early or late after
exposure can dramatically increase false negative rates [15]. However, these

temporal estimates ignore variation in the incubation period, assuming a
fixed onset time of 5 days. Additionally, high between-person variance has
been observed in the natural history of infection [23]. It is therefore unclear
what is driving these temporal changes in sensitivity or whether this temporal
profile makes sense on an individual basis.
Furthermore there were worrying trends in adherence to movement restrictions towards the end of “lockdown”, suggesting that recommended quarantine through the ‘Test & Trace’ programme may also be affected; an unpublished study of 90,000 adults across the UK in the two weeks up to 25th
May found that lockdown adherence may have dropped to 50% [28]. Our assumption of 90% untraced symptomatic individuals self-isolating is therefore
at the upper end of realistic, although symptomatic individuals will perhaps
be more cautious or less mobile due to the burden of symptoms. However,
this could also have repercussions on assuming that contact-traced individuals will self-isolate when asked to do so, particularly if asymptomatic.
Modelling studies in other countries have proposed combinations of contact tracing and population-level mitigation strategies [29] and a recent UK
study puts RS in the range of 1–1·6 for a combination of school closures,
50% reduction in social contacts and elderly shielding [10]. This covers the
range of values considered in this study and demonstrates the potential level
of physical distancing together with high-coverage contact tracing to keep
the effective reproduction number below one.
We also assume the Negative Binomial dispersion, k, of secondary cases,
does not vary with RS due to different social distancing measures. This
relationship is poorly characterised, but it is believed that social distancing
may increase k, leading to decreased heterogeneity in number of contacts,
potentially making outbreak control harder, although this effect is expected
to be at least cancelled out by the reduction in the mean [30]. Furthermore
it is also possible that less heterogeneity in contacts may make tracing of
individual contacts more feasible, allowing for a higher coverage.
Contact tracing improvements include secondary contact tracing as seen
in Vietnam, i.e. tracing the contacts of contacts of known cases, to get ahead
of the chain of transmission [31]. The use of a digital tracing app across
the UK if combined with manual tracing could boost tracing coverage [32]
and interactive dashboards are being rolled out across a number of countries
to inform modelling efforts and raise public awareness [33]. Backwards contact tracing, whilst highly labour intensive, could also fill vital gaps where
transmission links have been missed [34]. As experience in contact tracing

develops, it will also likely be possible to give contacts a prior probability of
infection (based on the duration and contact setting for example) and combine this with the test results to give a more accurate measure by which to
determine isolation requirements.
Overall, we conclude that contact tracing could bring substantial benefits
to controlling and preventing outbreaks, with tracing coverage and speed
playing an important role, as well as testing. However, any ‘test & trace’
strategy must carefully consider the limitation of poor test sensitivity, as well
as the additional tracing information obtained from testing asymptomatic
individuals. Poorly sensitive tests are inappropriate for ruling out a diagnosis,
and infectious individuals immediately halting quarantine following a false
negative result could have dangerous implications. In line with previous
studies [8], we have demonstrated that contact tracing alone is highly unlikely
to prevent large outbreaks unless used in combination with evidence-based
physical distancing measures, including restrictions on large gatherings.

In this extension of a previous COVID-19 branching process model [3], the
number of potential secondary cases generated by an index case is drawn
from a Negative Binomial. The exposure time for each case, relative to infector onset, is drawn from a shifted Gamma distribution that allows for
pre-symptomatic transmission and is left-truncated to ensure secondary case
exposure time is after the primary case exposure time. Secondary cases are
averted if the primary case is classified as ‘quarantined’ at the time of infection, assuming within household segregation is possible. The probability of
quarantine depends on whether the primary case was traced, any test result,
and adherence to self-isolation recommendations (Figure 4). Each simulation
was seeded with five infected individuals that are initially undetected by the
contact tracing system.

original analysis [30, 3]. The estimates of k for SARS-COV-2 are wideranging, from k = 0·1(range : 0·05 − 0·2) for pre-lockdown UK [34] to
k = 0·25(range : 0·13 − 0·88) for Tianjin, China during lockdown measures [35]. Due to the variation in the literature we have not updated this
parameter as 0·16 lies within these ranges and it is not yet possible to derive
accurate national estimates of k for post-lockdown scenarios. Here a smaller
k represents greater heterogeneity in transmission and results in the majority
of index cases leading to no secondary infections, while a small proportion of
individuals infect a large number of secondary cases. All parameter estimates
and references can be found in Table 1.

The incubation period (time from exposure to symptoms) is assumed to follow a Lognormal distribution with mean 1·43 and standard deviation 0·66
on the log scale [22]. Each new case is then infected at an exposure time
drawn from a Gamma-distributed infectivity profile (shape = 17·77, rate =
1·39 day−1 , shift = 12·98 days) relative to their infector’s symptom onset.
If this time is before the infector’s exposure then this value is rejected and
re-sampled to prevent negative generation intervals. This Gamma distribution has been fitted under these sampling assumptions to serial interval data
published by He et al. [23] using the fitdistr package in R and our resulting
distributions qualitatively match those presented in the original paper (Figure 5). The exposure time is then compared to the isolation times of the
infector and cases are averted if the infector is in isolation when the infection
event would have happened. For non-averted cases, symptom onset times are
then drawn from the Lognormal incubation period distribution and the probability of a case remaining asymptomatic throughout their infected period is
fixed at 40% [19, 20].

New cases are identified either through tracing contacts of known cases or
symptomatic individuals self-reporting to the system, which we model as a
two-stage process. Firstly, if an individual is symptomatic (i.e. has a fever
and/or dry persistent cough) but untraced we assume that a combination of
reduced social activity due to illness, and awareness of COVID-19 prevention measures, results in a 90% chance of self-isolation one day after symptom

onset. Secondly, individuals who self-isolate in this way then have a probability of contacting the tracing programme and reporting their symptoms as
a potential case, which can be varied in the model.
The assumption of 90% self-isolation relies on high levels of public awareness and draws on evidence from COVID-19 studies in the United States
and Israel that suggest 87·3% to 94% of individuals may isolate if they had
COVID-19 symptoms [36, 37]. These figures are supported by a US-based
2013 study that reports 72% of respondents would stay at home if they had
flu-like symptoms, provisional on access to sick pay [38], without the additional factor of social responsibility introduced by pandemic awareness.
However, it is important to note that this figure may still be optimistic, with
one study reporting 62·2% of Japanese citizens surveyed went to work within
seven days of onset of symptoms [39] and another that 75·1% of individuals
living in a UK households with COVID-19 symptoms admit to leaving the
house in the last 24 hours [40].
Contact tracing is initiated where an existing case has been identified
and isolated. The contacts of that individual are then traced with 40%–
100% coverage. If a contact is successfully traced they will always isolate.
The time taken to trace and isolate a contact is either one day or drawn from
a Uniform distribution of 1–4 days. In the absence of testing, traced contacts
are assumed to isolate until non-infectious—approximately 14 days [23]. Any
contacts that show symptoms or test positive will have their contacts traced;
this continues until no further cases result in transmission chain extinction.

In simulations that include testing, we assume test sensitivities of 65% or
95% with the lower value representing true sensitivity observed in healthcare
settings [14, 15] and the higher value being closer to measurements in controlled conditions [41] and also to demonstrate utility of an alternative testing
protocol with higher sensitivity. Due to the nature of the branching process
model, only infected individuals are modelled so the impact of test specificity
cannot be assessed under these methods, although the implications would be
related to programme feasibility rather than efficacy. Current specificity estimates are believed to be reasonably high in comparison [42, 16, 43], with
some estimates of close to 100%, but false positive tests could lead to unnecessary negative socioeconomic impact under any scheme requiring quarantine
of healthy individuals.

When testing is included in the model, all individuals that either selfreport to the contact tracing system (individual A in Figure 4), or are traced
contacts (B & D in Figure 4), are tested. From the moment a contact selfreports or is traced, either a zero- or two-day delay is simulated before the
test result is returned, chosen to be representative of UK programme targets. If a positive test is returned, the individual’s contacts are traced. If a
negative test is returned, two different scenarios are explored; either a) immediate departure from quarantine, or b) the individual is asked to complete
a precautionary quarantine period (e.g. 7 days from beginning of isolation).
Any contacts of a negative-testing case that were successfully identified prior
to receiving the test result are still isolated and tested.

A scenario in which there is no active case detection in the community is
considered whereby the only detected cases are those who are hospitalised.
This is simulated by reducing the case reporting proportion to 6%, reflecting the hospitalisation rate in the UK [44]. Time from symptom onset to
hospitalisation is drawn from an Exponential distribution with mean 5·954
days (fitted to data published alongside a modelling study [44]). We then
defined the undetected outbreak size as the number of cases that were exposed prior to the first hospitalisation, given an initial seeding of 5 index
cases at t = 0. We also consider a scenario of 100 index cases to represent a
mass super-spreading event, such as the large outbreaks seen in meat-packing
plants across Europe [45] or an instance in the SARS outbreak where a flight
attendant is thought to have infected more than 100 individuals [46].

Results presented are the combined output of 5,000 simulations for each
parameter combination, or scenario, considered. These results are used to
derive the probability of a large outbreak given a range of conditions. A
large outbreak is considered to be 2,000 cases and each simulation is run
for a maximum of 300 days. The threshold of 2,000 cases was chosen by
running simulations with a maximum of 5,000 cases and noting which of the
simulated epidemics that went extinct; 99% of extinction events occurred
before reaching 2,000 cases. The model was written in R and the code is
publicly available in an online GitHub repository (https://github.com/

Figure 4: Contact tracing schematic. Overview of the contact tracing
process implemented in our model. Person A isolates and self-reports to
the contact tracing programme with some delay after symptom onset, by
which time they have infected Persons B and C. When Person A self-reports
contact tracing is initiated. They are then tested with positive result and
remain isolated for their infectious period. Person B was infected by A
prior to their symptom onset and is detected by tracing after some delay,
after infecting Person D. After isolating they are tested, with a false negative
result. This leads to B either a) stopping isolation immediately or b) finishing
a minimum 7 day isolation period. Both may allow new onward transmission.
Person C was infected by A but not traced as a contact. Person C does not
develop symptoms but is infectious, leading to missed transmission. Person
D was traced and tested before the false negative test was returned for Person
B. The test for D returns positive, meaning that D remains isolated, halting
this chain of transmission.

Figure 5: Parameters’ distributions. Distributions for a) incubation period (exposure time to symptom onset) from Li et al. [22]; b) transmission
profile relative to symptom onset, fitted to data and compared to He et
al. [23]; c) serial interval, fitted and compared to He et al. [23]; and d) generation interval, combined distribution from a) and b) with re-sampling to
prevent negative serial intervals, as described in the main text.
