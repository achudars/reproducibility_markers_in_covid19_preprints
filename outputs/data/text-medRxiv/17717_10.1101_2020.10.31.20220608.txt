Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been detected in

42

domestic and wild cats. However, little is known about natural viral infections of domestic cats,

43

although their importance for modeling disease spread, informing strategies for managing

44

positive human-animal relationships and disease prevention. Here, we describe the SARS-CoV-2

45

infection in a household of two human adults and sibling cats (one male and two females) using

46

real-time RT-PCR, an ELISA test, viral sequencing, and virus isolation. On May 2020, the cat-

47

owners tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Two days later, the male cat showed mild respiratory

48

symptoms and tested positive. Four days after the male cat, the two female cats became positive,

49

asymptomatically. Also, one human and one cat showed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. All

50

cats excreted detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA for a shorter duration than humans and viral

51

sequences analysis confirmed human-to-cat transmission. We could not determine if cat-to-cat

52

transmission also occurred.

53

Introduction

54

In December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-

55

CoV-2) emerged as a new human pathogen in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, likely due to a

56

cross-species transmission event between humans and an unknown animal reservoir(1). Since

57

then, SARS-CoV-2 has been efficiently transmitted between humans, causing a pandemic with

58

devastating consequences for human health, societies and economies globally(2).

59

There is also now a growing body of data indicating that the virus is able to infect

60

companion animals and other animal species(1,3). To date, naturally occurring cases officially

61

reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and to the United States

62

Department of Agriculture include 14 cases in dogs in the US, Hong Kong, and Japan, and 25

63

cases in cats in the US, Hong Kong, France, Belgium, Germany, Russia, Spain and the UK(4).

64

Additionally, cases in farmed mink from the Netherlands, Spain, US, and Denmark, as well as

65

tigers and lions from a New York zoo in the US, have also been reported(4–6). Dogs that have

66

been experimentally infected show low viral loads and do not observably transmit SARS-CoV-2

67

between dogs(1). Among domestic animals, natural infection and experimental data suggest that

68

felids and mustelids are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection than canines(4,7,8).

69

Companion animals are considered as protective factors against loneliness and as a source of

70

social and emotional support for people during difficult situations or disease(9–11).

71

Understanding how and when SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted in domestic animals is critical

72

for informing decisions for control and prevention of infections. Previous studies of SARS-CoV-

73

2 transmission in cats have been in laboratory settings. Cats experimentally infected with SARS-

74

CoV-2 can efficiently replicate and transmit the virus to other cats housed in adjacent cages,

75

suggesting respiratory transmission. In these species, the virus replicates mostly in the upper

76

airways. Juvenile compared to sub-adult cats have more severe outcomes(7,12). However,

77

nothing is known about patterns of viral transmission under natural conditions in households in

78

which humans inhabits with companion cats. Key questions involve determining the dynamics of

79

virus infection including the duration of viral excretion.

80

Beginning in May 2020, we conducted active surveillance in Santiago City, Chile, to

81

determine the potential infection of companion animals in households in which the humans had

82

tested positive to SARS-CoV-2. At that time, Santiago was experiencing daily reports of >3000

83

SARS-CoV-2 human cases. From a survey of 12 households, we found two containing

84

companion animals that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. One household had two cats, one of

85

which presented antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The other household was home to three 10-year-old

86

sibling cats: all three were identified as having a SARS-CoV-2-positive infection. Herein, we

87

describe a case-study of naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the three-cat

88

household that also included two human adults aged in their 30s and 60s years old who were

89

both positive to SARS-CoV-2. The data generated provide a better understanding of infection

90

dynamics in cats, one of the most important SARS-CoV-2 animal natural hosts documented to

91

date.

92

Methods

93

Case description and specimen collection

94

Between May and September 2020, we collected animal companion samples from 12

95

households with confirmed human SARS-CoV-2 cases in Santiago City, Chile. These samples

96

were from 17 cats and 10 dogs (Supplementary information). Of the 12 households sampled, two

97

presented animals positive for SARS-CoV-2. In one household, one of two cats had SARS-CoV-

98

2 antibodies measured by ELISA. In the other household, three out of three cats were positive for

99

SARS-CoV-2 by rtRT-PCR. We followed the second-mentioned household for 40 days to

100
101

examine SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics. This case is described below.
On May 2020 a COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 rtRT-PCR for the

102

humans in the studied household – a male of around 30 years old and a female of around 60

103

years old. The residents owned three 10-years-old sibling cats, 1 male (cat 1) and 2 females (cat

104

2 & 3). Of the three cats, cat 1 had the closest contact with the humans, sharing human 1’s bed.

105

Humans and cats were recruited to this case study. From humans, nasal swabs, sputum, and fresh

106

fecal samples were collected at intervals of 4 to 7 days. From cats, nasal swabs and fresh fecal

107

samples were collected at intervals of 1 to 3 days until rtRT-PCR was negative for SARS-CoV-2.

108

At day 0 (first sampling date) a nasal swab was collected from cat 1 and fresh feces were

109

collected from all 3 cats. Cat 1 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rtRT-PCR in both nasal

110

(Ct=31) and fecal sample (Ct=33), and cat 2 and 3 tested negative. In cats, at the last sampling,

111

serum samples were also collected. Nasal samples were collected using flocked swabs; fresh

112

feces were stored in ziplock bags(13–15) and deposited in viral transport media.

113

The owners provided written consents at the time of the sample collection. For all the

114

study, human sampling was performed by nurses and animal sampling was performed by

115

veterinarians. Humans samples were tested at the Molecular Virology Laboratory, Pontificia

116

Universidad Católica de Chile and animal samples were tested at the Animal Virology

117

Laboratory, Universidad de Chile, La Pintana, Chile. The animal study was reviewed and

118

approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Universidad de Chile, under

119

protocol number 20370–VET–UCH, Biosafety Committee of Facultad de Ciencias Veterinarias

120

y Pecuarias, Universidad de Chile under protocol number 161 and the human study was

121

reviewed and approved under protocol 16-066 Scientific Ethical Committee on Health Sciences

122

of Pontifical Universidad Católica de Chile.

123

Real time RT-PCR

124

RNA from the samples was extracted using TRIzol™ Reagent (Invitrogen™, Carlsbad,

125

CA, USA) following the instructions recommended by the manufacturer and eluted into 50 µL.

126

The extracted RNA was subjected to rtRT-PCR to amplify a portion of ORF1b SARS-CoV-

127

2(16). This PCR was previously validated at both laboratories independently, and is one of the

128

RT-PCRs recommended by the WHO(17) to diagnose COVID-19. Positive and negative controls

129

for PCR and extraction were included in each run.

130

Serological testing

131

Serum samples were tested via a commercial ELISA test for SARS-CoV-2 antibody

132

detection, the ID SCREEN® SARS-COV-2 Double Antigen Multi Species(18) (IDVET,

133

Grabels, FRANCE).

134

Viral isolation

135

Viral isolation was attempted in Vero E6 cells at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount

136

Sinai, New York. Cells were cultured in minimum essential medium eagle 10% fetal bovine

137

serum, 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. Cells were seeded in 12-well culture

138

plates and cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 24-48h. Cells were rinsed and inoculated with 300

139

µl of the direct sample and 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions. Mock-inoculated cells were used as

140

negative controls. Cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 and monitored daily for cytopathic

141

effect (CPE) for five days. Cell cultures with no CPE were frozen, thawed, and subjected to three

142

blind passages with inoculation of fresh Vero E6 cell cultures with the lysates as described

143

above.

144

Viral sequencing

145

A selection of 25 rtRT-PCR positive specimens from humans and cats was submitted to

146

the Icahn Institute for Data Science and Genomic Technology, Icahn School of Medicine at

147

Mount Sinai, New York, NY for whole genome sequencing. Selection criteria were based on the

148

cycle threshold values and inclusion of all cats and humans. The whole genome was amplified

149

with a modified version of the Artic Consortium protocol(19) with custom tiling primers as

150

previously described(20). After amplification, viral sequencing was attempted on 12 positive

151

samples, four human and eight from cat. Purified amplicons were used for library preparation

152

with Nextera XT DNA Sample preparation Kit (Illumina, FC-131-1096) and sequenced on an

153

Illumina MiSeq instrument (2x150 nt). SARS-CoV-2 genomes were assembled and annotated

154

using a reference-based analysis pipeline as previously described(20).

155

Sequence data analysis

156

Six SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were analyzed. These sequences were obtained

157

from the clinical nasopharyngeal specimens of two humans that reside in the household: Human

158

1 (hCoV-19/Chile/Santiago/op31d5/2020; Human 1) and Human 2 (hCoV-

159

19/Chile/Santiago/op32d10/2020; (Human 2), and four sequences from their cats - two of these

160

were collected from nasal swabs of cat 2, and a nasal sample from cat 3. Completeness of

161

sequencing coverage and mutations were estimated by comparing the alignment with the

162

reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank accession NC_045512.2). Sequences were aligned to

163

a set of reference SARS-CoV-2 sequences including all Chilean sequences submitted to

164

GISAID(20) (n=167), sequences with highest similarity deposited on GenBank identified using

165

BLAST(21) (n=337), and a total of 1000 sequences randomly selected from the GISAID

166

repository using FastaUtils package in R(22). The sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7.402

167

using CIPRESS computational resources(23). The aligned sequences were visualized in AliView

168

v1.26(24). Duplicate sequences were removed and non-coding regions, 5’ and 3’ UTR were

169

trimmed. A phylogeny was estimated using the maximum likelihood method available in IQ-

170

TREE v1.6.7 employing the GTR+F+I+Γ4 model of nucleotide substitution with 1000 bootstrap

replications. The phylogenetic tree was visualized using Figtree. SARS-CoV-2 lineages were

172

identified using the Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner web application(25).

173

Results

174

Naturally infected cats excreted SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a different pattern to that of humans

175

To determine the duration and dynamics of SARS-Cov-2 RNA detection in cat excretions

176

under natural conditions, we assessed, by real time RT-PCR (rtRT-PCR), the presence of SARS-

177

CoV-2 RNA in nasal and fecal samples from three companion cats over a 40-day time period.

178

The cats acquired the SARS-CoV-2 infection naturally (rather than experimentally) and were

179

residing in their usual household during the sampling period. Cat 2 had a pre-existing chronic

180

rhinosinusitis as comorbidity. The household included two humans, and both were confirmed

181

positive for SARS-CoV-2 before sampling of the cats commenced. Nasal, sputum, and fecal

182

samples were taken from the humans and also assessed by rtRT-PCR for the presence of SARS-

183

CoV-2 RNA over the time period in which the cats were sampled. All three cats had detectable

184

viral RNA in both nasal swabs and fecal samples, with cycle threshold (Ct) values over 21.9

185

(Figure 1). In both humans, nasal and sputum samples showed Ct values ranging from 26 to 40.

186

However, all human fecal samples showed negative rtRT-PCR results. The duration for which

187

SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected in cat samples varied between the three cats sampled (5

188

days for cat 1, 8 days for cat 3, 17 for cat 2). Even at the extreme end of the range, the duration

189

of detection was considerably shorter than the human samples. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected

190

in the human samples up to 25 days after the first RNA detection. The dynamics of detectable

191

viral RNA in the cat samples were more erratic compared to that for detectable viral RNA in

192

humans from the same household. For example, a female cat (cat 2) presented an intermittent

193

RNA detection for at least 17 days (Supplementary information).

194

To assess the infection of the cats and humans, we made clinical observations for

195

symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and performed serological testing. Cat 1 presented with

196

mild clinical signs including dullness, lethargy, and coughing without fever. Cats 2 and 3 were

197

asymptomatic. On the last sampling on day 33 after first detection on cats, cat 2 tested positive

198

for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by ELISA. Both humans displayed COVID-19 symptoms including

199

fever, lethargy, and coughing. However, the female human was more clinically affected and was

200

the only human that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by ELISA starting at day 4 after

201

detection on cats.

202

Multiple attempts to isolate the virus from low Ct (high levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA;

203

21.9 -24.1) samples were made without success.

204

Human and cat origin SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences are identical

205

Of the specimens sent for genome sequencing one had coverage of 69·3% (human 2, day

206

10, nasopharyngeal) and five had a genome coverage >98% (three nasal swabs from cat 2, one

207

nasal swab from cat 3, and one nasopharyngeal from human 1) (Appendix Figure). The

208

remaining sequenced samples had a coverage <50% and were not included in the analyses.

209

Sequences were deposited in GenBank (Accession numbers MW064259- MW064264). Using

210

the Pangolin tool(25) all sequences were assigned to lineage B.1.1, a major European lineage

211

that was exported to the rest of the world from Europe. Of the 178 Chilean sequences included in

212

this analysis (from GISAID and GenBank), 34 belong to this lineage.

213

We conducted a phylogenetic analysis to investigate any relationship between the SARS-

214

CoV-2 RNA excreted by different cats and humans within the household. All six sequences

215

obtained fell into a monophyletic group defined by a C25344T (S1261F/Spike) nucleotide

216

substitution (Figure 2). Notably, there were no nucleotide differences between the viral

217

sequences obtained from cats and one of the household humans (hCoV-

218

19/Chile/Santiago/op31d5/2020; Human). The viral sequence from the female human (hCoV-

219

19/Chile/Santiago/op32d10/2020; (Human 2) contained two polymorphisms compared to the rest

220

of the sequences (C11511T/T3749I/nsp6) and (C13740T/syn/RdRp) but fell in the same group.

221

An epidemiologically unrelated Chilean SARS-CoV-2 sequence (GISAID accession number

222

EPI_ISL_468748) collected in the same city on April was also grouped within this cluster of 6

223

sequences.

224

Discussion

225

Several reports have confirmed the susceptibility of cats to SARS-CoV-2 infection in

226

natural conditions and viral transmissibility between cats under experimental

227

conditions(12,26,27). However, these do not provide insight into the infection dynamics of cats

228

in natural settings. This is the first report to describe the RNA excretion profiles of SARS-CoV-2

229

in naturally infected cats. The viral RNA in samples may indirectly denote SARS-CoV-2 viral

230

excretion and can serve, with limitations, as a proxy for active viral replication. Indeed, SARS-

231

CoV-2 antibodies detected by ELISA confirmed the infection in cat 2. Our household study thus

232

provides preliminary guidance for managing the care and quarantine of cats in households in

233

which SARS-CoV-2 is present.

234

The results, particularly the similarity of genome sequences depicted in the phylogenetic

235

analysis, strongly support the idea that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted between humans and

236

cats living in the same household. It is suspected that the humans were infected following

237

exposure to SARS-CoV-2-positive neighbors days before. We think it likely that cat 1 was the

238

first infected of the three cats because this animal had closer contact than the other two cats with

239

human 1 (male), sharing his bed. This is supported by our observation that viral RNA from

240

human 1 and the cats had identical sequences whereas the female human’s viral RNA differed by

241

two polymorphisms. Transmission between humans and cats in the same household accords with

242

the literature on viral infections in animals. Several animal species are permissive for virus

243

infection and replication in the upper respiratory tract(1) and it has been suggested that the

244

species barrier of SARS-CoV-2 might be weak since the ACE2 host receptor may allow virus

245

attachment even after some amino acid changes(28). SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to animals

246

by direct or indirect contact with contaminated surfaces or excretions(29). For cats(1) and

247

ferrets(30) respiratory transmission can be mediated by droplets or aerosols. Our findings of

248

positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in nasal samples (ranging from 5-17 days) and in fecal

249

samples (ranging from 4-10 days) in all three cats, further support recommendations for avoiding

250

close contact with companion animals when an infection is suspected in owners or family

251

members.

252

Whether all cats in the study household were infected from humans, or whether some

253

transmission occurred between animals, cannot be determined. Nevertheless, the possibility of

254

some transmission between cats in the household is suggested by the 4-day delay in cats 2 and 3

255

testing positive to SARS-CoV-2 by rtRT-PCR compared to cat 1. All three cats had direct

256

contact with each other. Transmission between cats in the household would be consistent with

setting7. In that study, inoculated and infected sub-adult cats were placed next to susceptible cats

259

in an adjacent cage (non-direct contact). Of the three replicates, one exposed cat gave rise to a

260

positive rtRT-PCR on the 5th day post-exposure(7). To date, however, we have only identified

261

three rtRT-PCR-positive cats, with one of these also positive by ELISA, and one cat of another

262

household similarly positive by ELISA. Consequently, it is likely that cat-to-cat transmission

263

events are not as common as human-to-human transmission.

264

In summary, at present, there is insufficient data to identify and prioritize the drivers for

265

the infection of companion animals(31). Reported cases in animals correspond to independent

266

and sporadic events. The findings presented here show that cats seemingly have different and

267

shorter patterns of excretion for SARS-CoV-2 RNA compared to humans. These results

268

highlight a need for large-scale epidemiological analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics to

269

support the establishment of preventive measures in real-life human-animal relationships.
