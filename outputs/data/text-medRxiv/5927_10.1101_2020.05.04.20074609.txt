Abstract

2

Background: There is no proven antiviral or immunomodulatory therapy for COVID-19. The

3

disease progression associated with the pro-inflammatory host response prompted us to examine

4

the role of early corticosteroid therapy in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19.

5

Methods: We conducted a single pre-test, single post-test quasi-experiment in a multi-center

6

health system in Michigan from March 12 to March 27, 2020. Adult patients with confirmed

7

moderate to severe COVID were included. A protocol was implemented on March 20, 2020

8

using early, short-course, methylprednisolone 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day divided in 2 intravenous doses

9

for 3 days. Outcomes of pre and post-corticosteroid groups were evaluated. A composite

10

endpoint of escalation of care from ward to ICU, new requirement for mechanical ventilation,

11

and mortality was the primary outcome measure. All patients had at least 14 days of follow-up.

12

Results: We analyzed 213 eligible subjects, 81 (38%) and 132 (62%) in pre-and post-

13

corticosteroid groups, respectively. The composite endpoint occurred at a significantly lower rate

14

in post-corticosteroid group compared to pre-corticosteroid group (34.9% vs. 54.3%, p=0.005).

15

This treatment effect was observed within each individual component of the composite endpoint.

16

Significant reduction in median hospital length of stay was observed in the post-corticosteroid

17

group (8 vs. 5 days, p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated an independent

18

reduction in the composite endpoint at 14-days controlling for other factors (aOR: 0.45; 95% CI

19

[0.25 – 0.81]).

20

Conclusion: An early short course of methylprednisolone in patients with moderate to severe

21

COVID-19 reduced escalation of care and improved clinical outcomes.

Background
As of April 9th, 2020, the United States has over 400,000 cases of confirmed coronavirus

3

disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

4

(SARS-CoV-2) [1]. Most patients will have mild illness, but older persons and those with

5

comorbidities may develop severe disease necessitating hospitalization and intensive unit (ICU)

6

care [2, 3]. The disease pathophysiology presents in two distinct overlapping phases, the initial

7

pathogenic viral response followed by host inflammatory response with grades of severity

8

associated with distinct clinical findings [4,5]. The pathological progression in severe COVID-19

9

includes an excessive and unregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine storm resulting in

10

immunopathological lung injury, diffuse alveolar damage with the development of acute

11

respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and death [6-9].

12

In the absence of any proven anti-viral therapy the current clinical management is

13

primarily supportive care, supplemental oxygen, and mechanical ventilatory support [1,10].

14

Adjunctive therapy with immunomodulatory agents targeting the inflammatory cytokine storm

15

are being evaluated [5,10]. Studies of corticosteroid therapy for phylogenetically similar

16

coronavirus infections showed no benefit and potential harm [11]. Despite the frequent use in

17

treating patients with COVID-19 in China, the role of corticosteroids is undefined [3,5,10-13]. A

18

more recent observational study reported improved outcomes in patients with COVID-associated

19

ARDS that received corticosteroids [14].

20
21

We postulated early treatment with a short course of corticosteroids in patients with
COVID-19 may attenuate the excessive host respiratory and systemic inflammatory responses.

Methods

Study Population

5

Consecutive patients hospitalized between March 12, 2020 through March 27, 2020 were

6

eligible for inclusion if they were 18 years of age or older, had confirmed COVID-19 infection,

7

with radiographic evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and required oxygen by nasal

8

cannula, high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), or mechanical ventilation. Patients were excluded if

9

they were transferred from an out-of-system hospital, died within 24 hours of presentation to the

10

ED, or were admitted for less than 24 hours. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as a

11

patient that had a positive reverse-transcriptase–polymerase- chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay for

12

SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal sample tested by the Michigan Department of Health and

13

Human Services (MDHHS) or the Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) centralized clinical

14

microbiology laboratory. Beginning March 16, 2020, testing for hospitalized patients was

15

performed by the centralized clinical microbiology laboratory.

16

Patients were risk stratified by severity of symptoms on presentation to the hospital as

17

mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19. Patients without hypoxia or exertional dyspnea were

18

considered to have mild COVID-19. Patients with mild COVID-19 were treated with symptom

19

relief only and not admitted to the hospital. Patients who presented with infiltrates on chest

20

radiography and required supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula or HFNC were classified as

21

having moderate COVID-19. Patients who had respiratory failure requiring mechanical

22

ventilation were classified as having severe COVID-19.

Study Design
This was a multi-center quasi-experimental study at HFHS, comprised of five hospitals in

3

southeast and south-central Michigan. The study was approved by the institution’s

4

Investigational Review Board (#13739) with waiver of consent. Patients in the pre-corticosteroid

5

protocol group from March 12, 2020 through March 19, 2020 were compared to a corticosteroid

6

protocol group that included patients from March 20, 2020 through March 27, 2020.

7

Patients in both study groups received standard care, comprised of supplemental oxygen,

8

HFNC, invasive ventilation, antibiotic agents, antiviral agents, vasopressor support, and renal-

9

replacement therapy, as determined by the primary team. Patients who progressed to ARDS were

10

managed with standard of care [15].

11

Intervention

12

Pre-Corticosteroid Protocol

13

Patients with moderate or severe disease who presented to HFHS within the first week of

14

the COVID epidemic in Detroit were initially treated with supportive care with or without a

15

combination of lopinavir-ritonavir and ribavirin or hydroxychloroquine according an institutional

16

guideline developed by Infectious Diseases Physicians and Pharmacists. The institutional

17

guidelines were developed by consensus, and based on the available literature, experience from

18

Wuhan, China and other centers around the world affected by COVID-19 before Michigan.

19

Intravenous (IV) remdesivir compassionate use was requested for eligible mechanically

20

ventilated patients. On March 17, 2020 lopinavir-ritonavir with ribavirin was removed from the

21

COVID-19 institutional protocol.[16]

1

As a result of observed poor outcomes, clinical rationale based upon immunology,

2

clinical course of COVID-19, and more recently best available evidence, the HFHS

3

corticosteroid protocol was developed (Supplementary Materials) [14,15,17]. We hypothesized

4

that early corticosteroids would combat the inflammatory cascade leading to respiratory failure,

5

ICU escalation of care, and mechanical ventilation. The corticosteroid protocol became the

6

institutional standard on March 20, 2020. Patients with confirmed influenza infection were not

7

recommended to receive corticosteroids.

8

Moderate COVID-19 was treated with hydroxychloroquine 400 mg twice daily for 2

9

doses on day 1, followed by 200 mg twice daily on days 2-5. Patients with moderate COVID-19

10

who required 4 liters or more of oxygen per minute on admission, or who had escalating oxygen

11

requirements from baseline, were recommended to receive IV methylprednisolone 0.5 to 1

12

mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses for 3 days. Patients who required ICU admission were

13

recommended to receive the above regimen of hydroxychloroquine and IV methylprednisolone

14

0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses for 3 to 7 days. ICU patients were also evaluated for

15

tocilizumab on a case-by-case basis. Oral switch was performed to prednisone at a ratio of 1 to 1

16

when determined clinically appropriate by the primary medical team.

17

Data Collection

18

Data was ascertained from each institution’s electronic medical record and recorded in a

19

standardized electronic case report form. Demographic data, information on clinical symptoms

20

or signs at presentation, and laboratory and radiologic results during admission. All laboratory

21

tests and radiologic assessments, including plain chest radiography and computed tomography of

22

the chest, were performed at the discretion of the treating physician.

Study Definitions
We ascertained coexisting conditions from electronic medical record and physician

3

documentation. The National Early Warning Score (NEWS) was collected to evaluate baseline

4

illness severity based on vital signs obtained in the Emergency Department [18]. Additionally,

5

the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) was used to evaluate severity of illness

6

of included patients based on ED vitals and examination [19]. All patients were followed for at

7

least 14 days after initial presentation. Patient data was censored on April 9, 2020.

8

Outcome Measures

9

Primary Endpoint

10

The primary composite endpoint was escalation to intensive care unit (ICU) from a

11

general medical unit (GMU), progression to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation

12

after hospital admission, or in-hospital all-cause mortality. Patients directly admitted to the ICU

13

from the emergency room were evaluated for the latter two outcomes and those requiring

14

mechanical ventilation in the emergency room were evaluated for mortality.

15

Secondary Endpoints

16

Secondary endpoints included development and severity of ARDS, days to ventilator

17

liberation, shock, acute kidney injury (AKI), and length of hospital stay (LOS). ARDS was

18

diagnosed and classified according to the Berlin Definition [20]. AKI was diagnosed according

19

to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes definition [21].

1

number and percentage (no., %) and compared using the chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test,

2

as appropriate. No imputation was made for missing data points. The sample size was derived

3

from all eligible consecutive hospitalized patients during the study period. A two-sided α < 0.05

4

was considered statistically significant. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis

5

was planned a-priori to test the association between the composite endpoint and exposure to the

6

corticosteroid protocol. Covariates in the bivariate analysis with a p-value <0.2 and clinical

7

rationale were included in a multivariable regression model that was restricted to a subject-to-

8

variable ratio of 10:1. To evaluate the implementation timing of the in-house RT-PCR SARS-

9

CoV-2 testing a post-hoc sensitivity analysis were conducted on the composite outcome. A non-

10

equivalent dependent variable, receipt of, and time to empiric antibiotic therapy for pneumonia,

11

was utilized to account for potential maturation in the management of COVID-19. Statistical

12

analysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 25 (Chicago, IL) and SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC).

13

Results

14

Two-hundred and fifty consecutive patients were evaluated for inclusion. Ten were

15

hospitalized for 24 hours or less, 23 did not require oxygen by nasal cannula, HFNC or

16

mechanical ventilation, and four expired within 24 hours of admission. Two-hundred and

17

thirteen patients were included, 81 (38%) in the pre-corticosteroid protocol group and 132 (62%)

18

in the corticosteroid protocol group. The median age of the pre-corticosteroid protocol group and

19

corticosteroid protocol group was 64 (IQR: 51.5, 73.5) and 61 (IQR: 51, 72) years, respectively.

20

Black patients comprised 61.7% of the pre-corticosteroid protocol group and 79.5% of the

21

corticosteroid protocol group (p=0.005). Of the comorbid conditions evaluated, chronic

22

obstructive pulmonary disease was more frequent in the pre-corticosteroid protocol group

compared to the corticosteroid protocol group (18.5% vs 9.1%; p=0.045). The presenting

2

COVID-19 symptoms, baseline severity of illness, and other demographics were similar between

3

groups (Table I).

4

Overall, corticosteroids use was 56.8% and 68.2% in the pre-corticosteroid protocol

5

group and corticosteroid protocol group, respectively (p=0.094). The corticosteroid protocol

6

group had a greater proportion of corticosteroids initiated within 48 hours of presentation (12.4%

7

vs. 41.7%, p < 0.001). The median time to corticosteroid initiation was 5 days (IQR 3-7, range 1-

8

9) in the pre-corticosteroid protocol group and 2 days (IQR 1-3, range 0-8) in the corticosteroid

9

protocol group. The median time to hydroxychloroquine initiation was earlier in the pre-

10

corticosteroid protocol group compared to the corticosteroid protocol group (3 [IQR: 1, 4] vs. 1

11

[IQR: 0, 2] days, p < 0.001). Additional treatment characteristics are described in Table II.

12

The primary composite endpoint occurred at a significantly lower rate in corticosteroid

13

protocol group compared to the pre-corticosteroid protocol group (34.9% vs. 54.3%, p=0.005). A

14

significant reduction in each of primary composite endpoints was also noted. In the sensitivity

15

analysis sub-group, after the implementation of the in-house RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing,

16

34.9% (46 of 132 patients) and 55% (33 of 60 patients) experienced the primary composite

17

endpoint in the corticosteroid protocol group and pre-corticosteroid protocol group, respectively

18

(p=0.009).

19

The median LOS was significantly reduced from 8 to 5 days in pre-corticosteroid

20

protocol group compared to the corticosteroid protocol group (p < 0.001). ARDS occurred in

21

38.3% and 26.6% in the pre-corticosteroid protocol group and corticosteroid protocol group,

respectively (P=0.04). After adjustment for male sex and age over 60, the corticosteroid protocol

2

was independently associated with a reduction in the composite endpoint at 14 days (aOR: 0.45;

3

95% CI [0.25 – 0.81]) (Table 2, Supplemental Materials). Outcomes at 14 days also included 9

4

(11.1%) of pre-steroid patients remaining admitted as compared to 26 (19.7%) of post-steroid

5

patients. Table III describes additional outcomes before and after implementation of the

corticosteroid protocol.

Discussion

8
9

In this quasi-experimental study, hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID19 that received an early short course of methylprednisolone had a reduced rate of the primary

10

composite endpoint of death, ICU transfer, and mechanical ventilation, with a number needed to

11

treat of 8 to prevent one patient transfer for mechanical ventilation. The reduction in ICU transfer

12

and requirement for mechanical ventilation represents a potential intervention to reduce critical

13

care utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic [22,23]. The median reduction of hospital LOS

14

by three days observed with the use of corticosteroids, could positively impact hospital capacity

15

during the COVID-19 surge.

16

Corticosteroids are not routinely recommended in patients with COVID-19 without an

17

alternate indication or presence of ARDS [11,15,24]. Data are conflicting; corticosteroid use in

18

previous viral respiratory illnesses have demonstrated delayed viral clearance and increased

19

mortality [11,25]. On the contrary, short course corticosteroids in some reports are beneficial and

20

safe in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 and were not found to be an independent risk

21

factor of prolonged viral RNA shedding [17,26,27]. These discordant findings may be explained

1

by the observational nature of the studies, heterogeneity in patient acuity, inconsistent dosing

2

regimens and duration, and timing of initiation of therapy [10,17]. Corticosteroids were used in

3

11-35% of non-severe and 45-72% of severe COVID-19 cases in China, however the benefits

4

and risks remain undefined [2,6,12-14]. A mortality benefit (HR, 0.38: 95% CI, 0.20-0.72) with

5

the use methylprednisolone was reported in one retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients

6

with ARDS [14].

7

COVID-19 can progress from mild to severe illness characterized by an initial viral

8

infection phase followed by pulmonary inflammation, and then a hyper-inflammation phase

9

[4,6,9]. The pulmonary phase is associated with progressive dyspnea and radiographic findings

10

of pneumonia.[4] Symptom onset to dyspnea and ARDS development occurs between a median

11

of 5 to 7 days and 8 to 12 days, respectively [6,12,28]. The present study findings support that a

12

short course of methylprednisolone may attenuate progression to the hyper-inflammation phase

13

that requires escalation of care in patients with COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine with or without

14

azithromycin, remdesivir, and lopinavir/ritonavir with ribavirin were prescribed at similar

15

frequency between groups. These agents have demonstrated mixed efficacy results for COVID-

16

19 in placebo controlled-trials, with hydroxychloroquine being the most promising at this time

17

[10]. Immunomodulatory agents, such as tocilizumab, were infrequently used in this study.

18

This study has several limitations. Given the pandemic nature of the disease a pragmatic

19

quasi-experimental design was used. The potential for regression to the mean and maturation is

20

an inherent limitation to all quasi-experiments. On March 16, 2020 rapid on-site RT-PCR testing

21

for SARS-CoV-2 testing was implemented, and some of the pre-steroid group experienced

22

delayed diagnosis and treatment. However, the observed association was unchanged in the

sensitivity analysis. A non-equivalent dependent variable, empiric antibiotic therapy for

2

pneumonia, suggested no difference in management of COVID-19. Some of the pre-

3

corticosteroid protocol group received corticosteroids after initiation of the updated COVID-19

4

institutional treatment protocol. Steroids initiated in this group were started significantly later.

5

Additionally, guideline adherence in the corticosteroid protocol group was not universal. Finally,

6

the study has a limited follow up period of 14 days, similar to other recent reports. As of April 9,

7

2020, 51 (62.9%) of patients in the pre-steroid cohort and 88 (66.7%) of patients in the post-

8

steroid cohort were discharged from the hospital. As a result, outcomes for those patients are not

9

known. Anecdotally, we observed hyperglycemia, but no severe corticosteroid related adverse

10
11

effects (i.e. gastrointestinal hemorrhage), and data collection is ongoing.
In conclusion, early use of a short course of methylprednisolone, an inexpensive and

12

readily available agent, in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 may prevent progression

13

of disease and improve outcomes. These findings are crucial given the ongoing COVID-19

14

pandemic and ICU bed and mechanical ventilator shortages. Research is urgently needed to

15

further define the role of corticosteroids in patients with COVID-19 at a high-risk of clinical

16

deterioration, identified early in the disease course using prognostic markers or clinical

17

prediction tools.

All confirmed COVID-19 inpatients

require Infectious Diseases consultation for management.
SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Testing Criteria from

For testing recommendations, please refer to
HFHS infection prevention and control.

Currently, there are no FDA approved therapies to treat COVID-19. Some medications have
demonstrated in vitro, animal, or very limited clinical safety and efficacy data in other
coronaviruses (e.g. SARS and MERS). The Division of Infectious Diseases is coordinating
research/compassionate use remdesivir. The below treatments should be started immediately

Preemptively
starting COVID medications prior to return of test results is not recommended due to limited
medication supply unless there is high suspicion based upon clinical judgement and patient
characteristics. These guidelines are interim recommendations and may change according to
once COVID test is positive (when indicated), pending remdesivir availability.

drug availability and new data published. Supportive care and infection control measures are
indicated for all hospitalized patients.

Initial labs for all inpatients (see below for ongoing treatment monitoring):
• Suspected or confirmed patients: CBC with differential, BMP, magnesium, ferritin, liver profile,
•

bilirubin, total, procalcitonin, CPK, D-dimer, CRP, LDH, high sensitivity troponin
Draw upon admission to ICU: Triglyceride, IL-6, DIC panel (in addition to labs listed above if not
previously ordered)
