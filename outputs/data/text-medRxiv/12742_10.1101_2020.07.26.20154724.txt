ABSTRACT
In May 2020 the Russian Ministry of Health granted fast-track marketing authorization to RNA
polymerase inhibitor AVIFAVIR (favipiravir) for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. In the
pilot stage of Phase II/III clinical trial, AVIFAVIR enabled SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance in
62.5% of patients within 4 days, and was safe and well-tolerated.

INTRODUCTION
The pandemic of the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) represents an unprecedented
disaster for healthcare providers and economy worldwide. The urgent requirement for the
effective treatments has sparked an intense effort on the part of the pharmaceutical industry and
shifted drug development to a new scale of commitment and collaboration.
Repositioning of antiviral drugs that could be effective against SARS-CoV-2 is one of the
common strategies in the fight against COVID-19. In May 2020, remdesivir received conditional
approval from U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hospitalized patients with
severe COVID-19. However, there are still limited data on its efficacy and safety and limitations
of the intravenous route of administration [1]. Thus, the development of the effective oral
antiviral agents for use at earlier stages of the disease is still warranted.
Favipiravir is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor marketed in Japan (Avigan)
and China (Favilavir) as a second-line treatment of novel or re-emerging influenza outbreaks [2].
Earlier this year it was reported to demonstrate antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero
E6 cells (EC50, 61.88 μM , CC50 > 400 μM, SI > 6.46) and to provide shorter viral clearance time
in patients with COVID-19 [3]. A non-randomized study conducted in China demonstrated a
median viral clearance time of 4 days, versus a period of 11 days for lopinavir/ritonavir
(p < 0.001) [4]. The World Health Organization (WHO) also listed Favipiravir as a candidate
experimental treatment (broad spectrum antiviral) [5].
Favipiravir under brand name AVIFAVIR was resynthesized and developed in Russia by
the joint venture of Russian Direct Investment Fund and ChemRar Group. Following preclinical
tests, a Phase II/III clinical trial of AVIFAVIR in patients with COVID-19 was initiated. This
brief report provides the interim results of the study from 60 patients enrolled in the pilot stage
(Phase II).

METHODS
This was an adaptive, multicenter, open label, randomized, Phase II/III clinical trial of
AVIFAVIR versus standard of care (SOC) in hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19
pneumonia. The study design was based on WHO R&D Blueprint recommendations [6]. The
pilot stage of the study was conducted in April and May 2020 at six Russian clinical sites in
Moscow, Smolensk, and Nizhniy Novgorod (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04434248). The
Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) was introduced to review the results of the
interim analysis.
The eligible patients included hospitalized men and non-pregnant women of 18 years or
older who signed the informed consent form, had moderate PCR-confirmed COVID-19 (positive

test at screening), were able to administrate the drug orally and willing to use adequate
contraception during the study and 3 months after its completion.
The patients were randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either AVIFAVIR 1600 mg BID
on Day 1 followed by 600 mg BID on Days 2-14 (1600/600 mg), or AVIFAVIR 1800 mg BID
on Day 1 followed by 800 mg BID on Days 2-14 (1800/800 mg), or SOC according to the
Russian guidelines for treatment of COVID-19 [7]. During the study, patients in all groups were
allowed to use pathogenetic and symptomatic treatment; patients in the AVIFAVIR groups were
not allowed to use other antivirals or antimalarial drugs.
The objective of the pilot stage of the study was to preliminary assess the efficacy and
safety of AVIFAVIR, and to select the optimal dosing regimen for further evaluation at the
pivotal stage (Phase III). The primary efficacy endpoint at the pilot stage was the elimination of
SARS-CoV-2 by Day 10 (defined as two negative PCR tests with at least a 24-hour interval).
Qualitative Real-Time RT-PCR tests were performed at local laboratories of the clinical sites or
in the central laboratory of Rospotrebnadzor.
The study assessments included daily vital signs, SpO2 and WHO Ordinal Scale for
Clinical Improvement (WHO-OSCI); PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection in nasopharyngeal and/or
oropharyngeal swabs at baseline and on Days 5, 10, and 15; chest computed tomography (CT)
scan at baseline and on Day 15; physical examination, complete blood count, biochemistry,
C-reactive protein (CRP), urinalysis, and electrocardiogram at baseline and on Days 5 and 15. If
not discharged from the hospital earlier, the patients attended follow-up visits on Day 22 and
Day 29. All patients were followed until Day 29.
The “go-no-go” decision to start the pivotal stage of the study was based on the exact
single-stage Phase II assessment at one-sided α=0.05 and 80% power [8]. 13/18 (72.2%) or more
patients would have been sufficient to demonstrate that the viral clearance in 80% of patients by
Day 10 was plausible, and that the response was greater than the presumably non-effective level
of 50%. The secondary endpoints that were assessed during the interim analysis were the rate of
viral clearance by Day 5, time to normalization of clinical symptoms (i.e. body temperature),
changes on CT scan by Day 15, and incidence and severity of adverse events related to the study
drug.
RESULTS
Upon signing the informed consent form and confirmed eligibility criteria, 60 patients
hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia were randomized into three treatment groups:
AVIFAVIR 1600/600 mg, AVIFAVIR 1800/800 mg, or SOC. Each group comprised 20 patients
and all randomized patients constituted safety and intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis sets.

The AVIFAVIR and control groups were generally comparable in demographic and
baseline characteristics. 28/60 (46.7%) had risk factors for severe disease (i.e. age 60 and older
and/or concurrent chronic conditions); 45/60 (75.0%) were on ambient air (Score 3 on WHOOSCI) and 15/60 (25.0%) required supplemental oxygen via mask or nasal cannula (Score 4 on
WHO-OSCI); 15/60 (25.0%) had body temperature > 38oC, and 42/60 (70.0%) had CRP
> 10 mg/L. Mean disease duration at baseline was 6.7 days from the start of the symptoms.
In the AVIFAVIR groups, the study drug was administered for a mean period of 10.9 ±
2.8 days. In the SOC group, hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine was administered to 15/20
(75.0%) patients, lopinavir/ritonavir was used in 1/20 (5%) patient, and 4/20 (20%) patients did
not receive etiotropic treatment. The concomitant therapy of COVID-19 in all groups included
antibiotics, anticoagulants and/or immunosuppressants, as well as symptomatic treatment.
Both dosing regimens of AVIFAVIR demonstrated similar virologic response. On Day 5,
the viral clearance was achieved in 25/40 (62.5%) patients on AVIFAVIR and in 6/20 (30.0%)
patients on SOC (p=0.018). By Day 10 the viral clearance was achieved in 37/40 (92.5%)
patients on AVIFAVIR and in 16/20 (80.0%) patients on SOC (p=0.155). Thus, the required
number of responders to demonstrate proof of concept was attained.
The median time to body temperature normalization (< 37oC) was 2 days (IQR 1-3) in the
AVIFAVIR groups and 4 days (IQR 1-8) in the SOC group (p=0.007). By Day 15, chest CT
scans improved in 36/40 (90.0%) patients on AVIFAVIR and 16/20 (80.0%) patients on SOC
(p=0.283).
Adverse drug reactions to AVIFAVIR were reported in 7/40 (17.5%) patients, including
diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, chest pain and an increase in liver transaminase levels. The adverse
drug reactions were mild to moderate and caused early discontinuation of the study drug in 2/40
(5.0%) patients.
Two patients on AVIFAVIR 1600/600 mg were moved to intensive care unit, received
mechanical ventilation and later died. Both patients had the increased risk of severe disease,
including diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, obesity, CRP > 50 mg/L, and supplemental
oxygen at baseline.
13/20 (65.0%) patients on AVIFAVIR 1600/600 mg, 17/20 (85.0%) patients on
AVIFAVIR 1800/800 mg and 17/20 (85.0%) patients on SOC were discharged from the hospital
and/or achieved Score 2 on WHO-OSCI by Day 15.

DISCUSSION
AVIFAVIR demonstrated rapid antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of
patients who achieved negative PCR on Day 5 on both dosing regimens of AVIFAVIR was
twice as high as in the control group (p<0.05). The median loading dose of AVIFAVIR given to
responders was 43.9 mg/kg (IQR 40.0-47.1), and to those with positive PCR on Day 5, it was
39.1 mg/kg (IQR 35.6-43.9). There were no new safety concerns related to AVIFAVIR as all
adverse reactions were mild to moderate in severity and were consistent with those reported
previously for AVIGAN [2, 9]. No increasing toxicity was observed in patients who received
higher doses of AVIFAVIR. Based on this observation, it was decided to introduce a weightbased dosing regimen of AVIFAVIR in the pivotal stage of the study with the target loading
dose of ≥ 44 mg/kg and the treatment duration of up to 10 days.
While clinical effects of AVIFAVIR will be further studied in the pivotal stage of the
study, the pilot data demonstrates proof of concept and high treatment potential of the drug in
moderately ill patients. It also suggests that the administration of AVIFAVIR to patients with
signs of respiratory distress and cytokine storm should be considered only as part of the
combination therapy that includes anti-inflammatory agents with proven efficacy against
COVID-19.
Based on the interim results of the Phase II/III clinical trial, the Russian Ministry of
Health granted a conditional marketing authorization to AVIFAVIR, which makes it the only
approved oral drug for treatment of moderate COVID-19 to date.
