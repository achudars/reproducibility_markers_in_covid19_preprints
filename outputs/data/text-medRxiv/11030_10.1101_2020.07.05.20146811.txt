Abstract
The world is experiencing one of the greatest public health emergencies in history with the
global spread of COVID-19. Health systems, including Primary Health Care (PHC) services,
are pillars of pandemic coping strategies, and there are important gaps in the literature on the
best ways to organize PHC in health crisis scenarios such as the one currently experienced.
Given the urgency of responses, we performed a rapid systematic literature review on
MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE and LILACS (via VHL), in order to analyze empirical
studies on the effectiveness of PHC organization strategies in the context of epidemics to
improve access and reduce morbidity and mortality. We selected seven articles, which studied
the responses to different epidemics in different parts of the world. In terms of access, the
studies suggest positive results with the adoption of adjustments of work processes of the teams
and the structure of the services, combined with diversification of actions (including call center),
adequate provision of inputs and personal protective equipment, adequate action plans and
communication strategies, and effective integration with public health services and other levels
of care. No study analyzed population morbidity and mortality. The included studies suggest
also that community-oriented PHC is more effective in crisis scenarios, indicating the necessity
of strengthening of the Family Health Strategy in the Brazilian context.

Introduction
Major epidemics have marked history, causing significant social, cultural, political, economic,
and health impacts 1. The past few decades have seen the emergence of new pathological agents
that have spread fear in most parts of the world. These are the cases of SARS (Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome), beginning in 2002 in China, which affected approximately 8 thousand
people in less than 1 year, and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), which reached less
than a thousand people in the two years after its emergence in Saudi Arabia, in 2012 2. These
figures illustrate the unprecedented dimension that a new pandemic (also caused by a
coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2), gained in approximately 5 months of global dissemination, from
its epicenter in Hubei province, China, reaching approximately 3.5 million infected and 250,000
deaths at the beginning of May 2020 3.
The magnitude of COVID-19 makes it one of the greatest humanitarian crises of the last few
centuries and a public health emergency, understood here as an extraordinary occurrence, which
puts other States at risk and requires coordinated and robust international strategies for disease
prevention and control 4,5. The enormous speed of contagion and spread between countries and
regions, combined with the severity of the disease, pressures for decisions that affect the lives
of the entire population to be taken quickly and with high degrees of uncertainty as to their
effectiveness 6. The sciences are used to point out the best strategies for social distancing and
individual protection, developing tests to identify cases, assessing the effects of antiviral drugs
and potential vaccines, aligning clinical protocols, and organizing health systems. But in each
aspect of these, the novelty of the pandemic and the current political configurations challenge
the current methodologies of production, dissemination of knowledge, and decision making at
different levels of social organization.
The organization of health systems and services in the face of a pandemic is a pillar of any
emergency plan, whether local, national, or international. In general, systems that have robust
Primary Health Care (PHC) are more effective, efficient, safe, equitable and sustainable, since
this level of care is considered central in all types of response to acute or chronic health
problems 7,8. In this sense, it is possible to state that PHC should be considered one of the main
strategies for coping with a public health emergency, including COVID-19. Ease of access to a
population already known by health teams trained to provide comprehensive care in a socially
oriented manner and in coordination with the other levels of care make PHC an essential tool
in both the short and the medium and long term coping with the various waves of a public health
emergency 9,10.

However, there is little scientific evidence on the most effective strategies for organizing PHC
services; most available evidence refers to the hospital environment 11. The demand for timely
responses to an epidemic leads us to think pragmatically about the format of local healthcare
flows to serve an increasing number of sick people. However, incorporating knowledge
produced in the context of an epidemic can contribute to a more rational decision making,
resulting in an adequate use of supplies and equipment (which are difficult to obtain in times of
high demand at sustainable costs) and less population morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, this study aimed to carry out a rapid systematic review of the literature that analyzes
the effectiveness of PHC organization strategies in the context of epidemics.

Methods
In this rapid systematic review

12

, we included original observational or experimental

quantitative as well as qualitative empirical articles that have been peer-reviewed and published
in indexed scientific journals, with no date limit, in English, Portuguese or Spanish. Studies
should focus on analyzing the organization and structuring of PHC services to face a critical
public health situation, characterized as an epidemic or pandemic. The articles also needed to
define as an outcome the facilitation of the population's access to health care or population
morbidity and mortality. We excluded studies that did not address PHC, did not bring original
empirical data, that did not define a desired outcome of the intervention, or had not been carried
out in the context of an acute event with a significant impact on public health. Opinion articles,
comments, essays, letters, editorials, experience reports, and reviews were also excluded.
Systematic searches for articles were made on April 1, 2020 by one of the authors (APSC) on
MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, and LILACS (via VHL). No procedures were established
for searching the gray literature. The search strategy used was (“primary health care” OR
“primary care” OR “community health service”) AND (“Patient Care Management” OR “health
care management” OR “Organizational Innovation” OR “Personnel Management” OR “health
care personnel management” OR “Professional Practice” OR “Program Development” OR
“Quality of Health Care” OR “Total Quality Management”) AND (“Disease Outbreaks” OR
epidemic OR “Disaster Medicine”). This search strategy was built from MeSH (Medical
Subject Headings) and Emtree (Embase subject headings) descriptors, adapting the searches to
the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, respectively; the MEDLINE search strategy was
reused in LILACS.

The search results were condensed and transferred to EndNote X7®. Duplicate articles were
excluded. Two researchers (TDS and APSC) independently screened titles, abstracts, and full
articles for analysis of the work's eligibility. Disagreement was resolved by consensus and, if
necessary, by a third researcher (LFF).
Data extraction was performed by two authors (TDS and WSL) with an instrument designed
for the purposes of this research. The articles were characterized based on the following
information: authors, year of publication, title, place and year of realization, and the journal
publishing the study; objective, methodological design, study scenario, sampling, and data
analysis techniques; type of acute event faced (eg H1N1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV); outcome
or improvement aspect of the analyzed service; main results of the study.
The objective and exploratory character of this review and the methodological diversity of the
studies led us to analyze the results in a narrative manner, identifying aspects of the organization
and structuring of PHC services that result in handling the crisis situation, considering that this
review was planned in order to serve as a basis for reflections and decision-making by managers
and health professionals in their workplaces. In this sense, we chose not to carry out an in-depth
analysis of the quality and potential of study biases individually. The potential impact of articles
on the reality of health systems and global limitations of the scope and methodology of the
studies were analyzed.
The research was reported following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyzes) recommendations 13, adapted as needed to the rapid systematic
review format. The research was also registered in the PROSPERO (the international
prospective register of systematic reviews) database with the code CRD42020178310, after
ensuring there were no ongoing reviews with the same scope.

Results
The search strategy resulted in 2473 articles, highlighting the absence of research identified in
LILACS, which may denote problems of indexing Latin American journals or some invisibility
of the topic in this region. The screening of titles, abstracts, and full texts resulted in the
selection of seven articles 14-20 for the narrative synthesis presented here (Figure 1).
Throughout the screening of the articles, we identified many studies that addressed chronic
conditions of illness, problematic use of opioids, infectious diseases, mass vaccination
campaigns, description of epidemiological surveillance systems, and studies focused on the
hospital environment. It is interesting to observe how part of the academic literature links the

problem of illness due to chronic conditions to the concepts of epidemic and even pandemic,
denoting the significant impact that these diseases present in the world today, especially in more
developed countries, and potentially a publication bias. In addition, there were numerous
experience reports, opinion texts, theoretical models and protocols for action, government
positions, and descriptions of the role of different professional categories and managers in a
situation of public health crisis secondary to a major epidemic.
All seven articles were based on qualitative research methods, with two 17,20 triangulating such
methods with administrative data or a survey with probabilistic sampling (Table 1). They aimed
to analyze the effects of different epidemics on the population, health professionals and the
organization of health services, and sought to understand the perspectives of different actors
directly or indirectly involved with the health system, varying from managers and stakeholders
linked to corporate organizations and non-governmental organizations to health professionals
and community members.
Based on these characteristics of the seven selected studies, which are quite heterogeneous with
each other, we proceed to a narrative synthesis of the main findings that can bring relevant
contributions to the structuring of responses from health systems worldwide (Table 2). We
chose to group these results in some thematic groups, which we present below.

Reality and context in which the service is inserted
As shown by Masotti et al. 16, reflecting from the context of an H1N1 epidemic in Canada, there
are no universal and linear responses to such a crisis. Many factors must be taken into account
in preparing an effective response, including the characteristics of the epidemic itself, the
territory, the system, and the health services.
Another fundamental point concerns cultural aspects. Both Miller et al.

17

and Siekmans et al.

20

, studying the same Ebola epidemic that began in 2014 in countries on the African continent,

noted that the search for facility-based primary care services by rural communities is influenced
not only by the distance and social vulnerability but also by the fear of contracting the disease
in the service and by a deep distrust in the official structures as a result of previous armed
conflicts. In both cases, the formulation of community-based services with volunteer workers
responded not only to the country's precariousness and scarcity of resources but also contributed
to increasing people's bond with PHC and thus establishing access and the possibility of
treatment.

However, the formatting of the health system seemed to be the main factor to be considered
when formulating responses to an epidemic. The selected studies are from a few countries, but
illustrate some ways of organizing PHC in the world. We found studies carried out in systems
that have community-based primary care services relying on multiprofessional work and
offering a good diversity of services to the population, including home care and health
surveillance 14,16,19. We identified studies carried out in systems whose PHC is mostly provided
privately by small clinics or offices owned by doctors themselves or belonging to local
corporate networks, featuring a fragmented system focused on individual care, with fee-forservice paid trough health insurance or out-of-pocket

15,18

. In the African context

17,20

, the

studies present a scenario of profound health deficiencies, with PHC services difficult to access
to a significant part of the population, subject to frequent interruptions of care due to armed
conflicts and discontinuity of financial resources.
No study has compared these different models of organization of the health system in the face
of an epidemic, being impossible to conclude definitively for the greater or lesser effectiveness
of any of these. However, the data suggests community-based PHC services allow health
systems to develop effective and comprehensive responses for populations in situations of
epidemic, enabling the interplay of individual clinical care with collective actions of
epidemiological surveillance, as well as the possibility of further adjustment of work processes
and structure for specific healthcare to suspected cases. Small PHC clinics focused on the
physician had less potential for such adjustments, despite the possibility of increasing the
service capacity for non-commercial hours. But in these cases, the risk of contagion of
professionals is greater and issues related to the provision of protective equipment and
medications are more problematic.
These contexts also have profound differences in the articulation of PHC with the other levels
of care, with public health services and agencies, and with the other social sectors. Where such
integration was more problematic [eg. in Turkey

19

, PHC was not obliged to notify cases of

H5N1], there was a greater likelihood of disorganization of workflows, difficulties in referring
users to other services, problems with the adoption of protocols and clinical guidelines and
provision of essential supplies. Most of the selected studies emphasize the importance of this
intra- and intersectoral articulation, especially between PHC and public health agencies, and
PHC with urgent and emergency services. This integration reduces the level of stress to which
PHC is subjected in similar situations and allows for more effective and direct action with the
affected people and those who need the primary care service for their regular monitoring.

Planning of communication actions and strategies
The effectiveness of the response to the epidemic also depended on the type of action plan and
communication strategies constructed. At the beginning of the epidemic, it was common for
health professionals and the population to face deficiency or an excess of information about the
problem, coming from the most varied institutions and through the most diverse channels. In
general, these studies show that such plans must be as operational as possible, focusing on what
is especially necessary to be done in the health service that directly impacts the quality of care
offered, with the greatest possible safety for users and professionals 14-16,19.
Some studies, especially those from fragmented systems in developed countries 14-16, show that
healthcare workers can receive contradictory or redundant messages from different sources:
their own institutions, local and national health authorities, media and scientific literature.
Action plans, protocols, and clinical guidelines must be designed in order to facilitate access to
the necessary information that will impact the health care outcome.
Another aspect is that such plans should ideally involve the maximum number of stakeholders
directly or indirectly involved in coping with the epidemic: managers, healthcare workers,
community leaders, and essential professional and non-governmental organizations can present
different perspectives on what needs to be addressed in structuring responses to the crisis.

Provision of essential equipment
The studies shows that the results of the actions of the primary care services depend on the
adequate and permanent provision of essential supplies not only to the user but also for the
protection of the healthcare worker. Services that managed to maintain an adequate supply of
their stocks showed more favorable results in terms of offering access to essential care.
The high potential for contagion is a central concern for healthcare workers when they are at
the forefront, providing care for suspected cases. One of the main aspects of maintaining
people's easy access to care is the workforce having sufficient numbers and satisfactory physical
and mental health. These people are under deep stress and experience fear of their own illness
and potential death, but mainly they fear for the lives of their family members. In some articles,
the healthcare workers were removed from the forefront not only because of their won illness
but also for the protection of their closest people. The lack of protective equipment increases
the risk to which workers are subject and means serious losses in the service's potential for
healthcare delivery.

Problems with the provision of essential supplies and equipment were greatest in services in
Turkey

19

and some countries on the African continent

17,20

, although shortages of medicines

and personal protective equipment have occurred in more developed countries as well. Planning
for maintaining service stocks at safe levels should be done as soon as possible before the
number of cases explodes.

Bond with the community
The bond of healthcare workers with the community appeared in particular in studies carried
out in the most vulnerable countries. Sarikaya and Erbaydar

19

show how the relationship

previously established by family doctors with their community allowed the identification of the
first H5N1 cases in the territory, representing the first step in the articulation of epidemiological
surveillance and public health actions. The same authors also show that the PHC workers'
detailed knowledge of people's social reality was poorly utilized by the health system, wasting
a potentially opportunity for reducing some conflicts observed with the community.
Miller et al.

17

and Siekmans et al.

20

, analyzing the contexts of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra

Leone, point out that the selection of community health workers resident in the communities
was a decisive factor for the good results observed. The history of armed conflicts and social
neglect means that a significant part of people living in rural communities have problematic
relationships with state or non-government services, increasing the chance that people will
choose traditional health practices available in the community, which can result in diagnostic
delay and complications. The bond established by the local health agent increases the
effectiveness of the educational practices offered by him and increases access to PHC services.

Work processes, healthcare flows, and specific services
In general, the authors describe a set of reformulations made by the services: separation of
rooms, collective spaces, and entrances for the exclusive care of suspicious people; managing
cases in an external environment, such as service parking or even community equipment;
reallocation of healthcare workers to exclusively attend symptomatic people and/or to carry out
administrative and epidemiological surveillance activities; definition of specific protocols and
guidelines for healthcare workers in contact with symptomatic people. Such measures have the
potential to streamline the service, increase the workers’ safety, rationalize the use of protective
equipment, and reduce the team's stress level. However, it was not possible to draw large
conclusions about the effectiveness of these actions, and healthcare reorganizations might need
to be tailored to the local, cultural, and social reality.

In the context of a respiratory disease epidemic, building reference services for affected people
is of special interest. Two studies

15,16

addressed this issue but did not present enough data to

about the effectiveness of these reference services. The authors comment that such services
were relevant for reducing the burden of care both at the hospital and the PHC level and that
being backed by these services is important for small PHC clinics with reduced equipment and
supplies, but they do not provide more information on the rational use of protective equipment
and medicines, agility in the referral process, or even the level of quality and adoption of clinical
guidelines for these services in comparison with the other levels.

Discussion
The results of the studies reviewed here suggest that a combination of strategies for organizing
healthcare flows, greater integration of healthcare workers and services, effective
communication, clear definition of roles and actions of the different actors and enhancing the
previously established links between PHC and the territory, may generate the most effective
responses of the health system to a major epidemic, like in the several examples of what has
been experienced in the world in recent decades and the current pandemic by COVID-19.
The seven articles analyzed also point to the need to not only organize the actions of
containment, mitigation, suppression and recovery in the face of a pandemic but to learn about
the best alternatives for intervention, both individually and collectively

9,21

. These studies

demonstrate that it is necessary to adopt a more systematic approach to the production of
scientific knowledge in the face of these crises, in order to understand what needs to be done in
order to establish a more effective and efficient organization of the health system.
Evidently, these crises demand rapid responses in contexts of great uncertainty and urgency 22.
Therefore, it is essential that good scientific evidence is produced timely for great learning

23

and, in our view, this movement should constitute one of the central aspects of action plans in
the face of pandemics.
Specifically addressing the Brazilian context, the most appropriate PHC model to provide
effective, comprehensive health care during the pandemic might be the Family Health Strategy
(FHS), because of its community orientation, multiprofessional teamwork, deep territorial
connection and intersectoral integration

24

. PHC models restricted to small doctor-focused

services, which in Brazil are more common in supplementary health 25, may be more fragile in
these situations due to the high risk of contagion of their professionals and less integration with
the structure public health.

Some aspects addressed in the articles could be better studied and implemented in the context
of the FHS, in order to enhance their results. We cite the strengthening of Community Health
Workers (CHW), not only in numerical terms [coverage by CHW has been reduced recently 26]
but also in qualitative terms, with adequate training for early identification of cases, guidance
of the population regarding healthcare flows, and health education; and with the
computerization and incorporation in the daily lives of the teams of communication
technologies allowing easy integration and communication with the whole healthcare network,
diversification of service options for people, and real-time monitoring of the local
epidemiological situation. It is also worth reflecting on the extent to which the National Primary
Care Policy (PNAB) adopted in recent years leads to a more powerful PHC in a context of
profound social inequalities, underfunding of the health system and high epidemiological
complexity 24,26.
Another aspect present in two reviewed studies 15,16 dialogues with a strategy that appears as an
intervention option in the COVID-19 pandemic in several Brazilian municipalities 27, which it
is the creation of specific services for the care of suspected cases. No study among those
analyzed had the central objective of evaluating the effectiveness of these services in the context
of major epidemics, which allows us only to hypothesize that there are positive effects of their
creation in terms of reducing the burden of care both in PHC and in the urgency and emergency
network, and that such a level of centralization can result in a more rational administration of
inputs, personal protective equipment, and medications, as well as more effective coordination
of the reference of suspected cases between the levels of care.
Some limitations of this work must be considered. Rapid reviews are good options for
producing and systematizing knowledge in a timely manner for evidence-based decision
making 12,28,29 at the cost of some flexibility in essential steps of systematic reviews. We chose
to qualify some steps recommended for quick reviews, which increases its internal validity: we
searched three databases of impact; we kept two independent researchers in the screening stages,
selecting the corpus of articles for narrative review, and extracting the data; time limits and
geography were not adopted in the selection of studies; and we incorporated articles in more
than one language. The main limitations in this study are the lack of individualized analysis of
the quality of the selected articles and the failure to carry out manual searches and gray literature,
which may have excluded from the review relevant papers available in institutional technical
reports or papers not published in indexed journals.

In summary, this review points to the need to build action plans with broad participation by the
actors involved in coping with the epidemic, whose determinations consider the context in
which the service is inserted, condensing work process adjustments and structuring healthcare
flows, diversification of care practices and integration with the whole of the care network,
especially with the public health apparatus. Emphasis is placed on the importance of
empowering the service link with its registered population.
Unfortunately, such measures do not fit into proposals to reduce the participation of public
authorities in guaranteeing the constitutional right to health.

(SARS).

Setting
•

Diverse healthcare
services in Ontario,
including public health,
home care, Community
Care Access Centres and
clinics, among others.

•

Canada was the country
outside Asia most
severely affected by
SARS, and healthcare
workers constituted two
thirds of the probable
cases.

Findings
•

Pillars of effective confrontation of the
epidemic: leadership; communication;
resource allocation; recognition and
support for the professional;
participation of professionals in
organizational decision-making;
Health education.

•

Effective communication between
managers and healthcare workers and
between them and users and the
community must be a priority, with
priority actions clearly defined.

•

Organizational support is essential,
meaning that managers are concerned
with the safety of healthcare workers,
respond to their concerns, and resolve
conflicts.

•

Guidelines and protocols for
emergencies are fundamental.

•

Main challenges: work overload;
emotional impact (fear, stress,
isolation, and frustration); lack of
personal protective equipment.

(H1N1).

•

Physician-centered solo,
group, and corporate
PHC practices.

•

Many clinics with a high
proportion of users per
doctor, offering access to
vulnerable populations.

•

Funding of clinics:
public (bulk billing),
private (fee-for-service),
or mixed.

•

Public health authorities
support PHC, including
the provision of PPE and
standardization of
clinical guidelines.

•

The most effective clinics had stocks
of PPE, strict professional hygiene and
protection protocols, rapid action plans
for epidemics, communication
strategies, and underwent training in a
timely manner.

•

The structure of the clinic was decisive
for the expansion of care for
symptomatic patients and maintenance
of care for non-affected users:
alternative entrances to the service that
could be destined for the affected,
extra rooms designated for the
exclusive care of the affected, and
large waiting rooms.

•

Some clinics have designated
professionals (nurse or doctor) for the
exclusive attention of symptomatic
users, including administrative and
epidemiological surveillance activities,
but it was not possible to identify the
results of this initiative.

•

Communication between health
authorities and clinics must be
synchronized with the concrete
demands of professionals, oriented
towards clinical practice, specific to
PHC, and easily accessible and
understood.

•

Specific clinics for the care of
symptomatic patients were created
near the hospital structure. They were
considered important in the rear of
both the PHC and the hospital, mainly
during non-business hours.

•

Smaller PHC clinics with problems
with PPE stock or removal of
professionals referred all suspected
cases to these specific clinics, using
telephone screening or in specific
areas of the clinic.

•

Larger PHC clinics with sufficient
supplies (PPE, alcohol, diagnostic test)
absorbed the demand of users with
influenza but presented a greater risk
of leaving affected professionals and
difficulties in referring users to the
tertiary level.

•

Set of community-based
PHC services, including
a gateway to clinical
services, home care, and
health prevention and
promotion programs (eg,
smoking).

•

Restricted role of the
federal government in
the provision of PHC
and public health
services, with emphasis
on Canadian provinces
and territories.

•

Existence of PHC and
public health services
with defined functions
and different degrees of
integration.

•

Organization of coping actions must
be adapted to different realities:
severity of the epidemic; size,
location, service capacity and
inventory of service supplies;
provision of human resources;
characteristics of the territory (urban,
rural, mixed, presence of traditional
populations and vulnerable
minorities); and the degree of
integration of PHC with public health
services; etc.

•

Operational action plans are essential,
detailing the “how to do it” in each
situation, and these must be developed
with the participation of the largest
possible number of actors involved in
facing the epidemic.

•

Planning for situations of reduction in
the number of available professionals
and unexpected events must be done.

•

The greater the integration of different
actors and services, the greater the
effectiveness of the response.

•

Centralized care services for users
with suspected influenza were
important to reduce hospital and PHC
burden, but the article does not
provide detailed results of this
experience.

•

Communication is central, and
guidelines and protocols must bring
objective and operational messages,
preferably from a single source, and
appropriate to the different realities.

•

The safety of professionals and their
families was a concern that hampered
the integration of several public health
actions in PHC and should always be
an aspect of attention.

•

Communities with a
high rate of viral
transmission, up to 2.5
hours away from the
nearest PHC service.

•

Health systems
organized differently
across the three
countries.

•

Selective community
health practices (mostly
health care for prevalent
maternal and child
conditions).

•

Volunteer CHWs living
in the community and
working under the
supervision of external
healthcare workers.

•

CHWs refer users to
PHC services which are
of reference for the
community.

•

Poor work structure
(insufficient funding,
equipment, and
medicines with irregular
and insufficient
provision).

•

Stakeholders commented on the
provision of community health
services before, during, and after the
epidemic.

•

The most effective CHWs in caring for
their communities were those
receiving timely training, effective and
objective information, ongoing support
from services and official
organizations outside the community,
and equipment (including
medications).

•

In places with better structures in the
period before the epidemic, responses
were more effective during and after
the emergency.

•

In places with greater involvement of
local leaders, social mobilization, and
time spent by CHWs before the
epidemic, the population used and
trusted more the services, empowering
CHWs as the first contact for people,
and improving the reference to PHC
services.

Physician-centered solo,
group, and corporate
PHC practices.

•

These clinics are weakly
articulated with
governmental
governance bodies.

•

Fragile integration of
PHC with public health
structures.

•

Study carried out at a
later stage – 6 – of the
epidemic.

•

Three workflow models were
identified for PHC clinics in the
epidemic: A. Standard, in which health
care continues as usual, including
suspected cases; B. “Streamed
Model”, in which the clinic makes its
own plan to serve only users with
influenza, to serve only users with
various problems, or to focus on
specific services (prenatal, childcare,
surgical procedures); C. Mixed, in
which each doctor at the clinic draws
the list of services that he or she will
offer to users, without joint planning,
whether or not he or she can assist
people with suspected influenza.

•

Model “b” was considered safer and
more effective in this epidemic,
although it needs more structural
support.

•

Model “a” was considered more
accessible and flexible and may be
better accepted by users, but it
increases the risk of contagion among
healthcare workers and may not offer
appropriate care to people in isolation
at home.

•

Public health practices, such as
surveillance or home monitoring of
confirmed and suspected cases, are
particularly difficult to integrate with
PHC in Australia but can be more
easily adopted in model “b” and, if any
healthcare workers plans to do so, in
“c”.

•

All models must be planned according
to their installed capacity and profile
and number of available professionals,
it being important to carry out an
adequate planning of the rear of
healthcare and administrative workers.

They analyze the
performance of
voluntary CHWs, living
in the community, in the
provision of selective
health services for the
most frequent maternal

•

Search for PHC increased significantly
when the Ministry of Health declared
officially the epidemic.

•

The more effective services had
adequate human resources and supply
of PPE and other equipment, outlined
action plans, greater integration with
epidemiological surveillance and good
communication strategies with the
community.

•

PHC was not responsible for
compulsory notification of diseases
until the epidemic.

•

There was a gradual integration of
PHC with epidemiological
surveillance throughout the epidemic,
including better organization of
notification and identification and
monitoring of cases by health teams,
which played an important role in
facing the problem.

•

The study mentions the importance of
telephone counseling services, but
there is no more detailed information
to allow further consideration.

•

Part of the qualitative results suggest
that the PHC bond and community
orientation contribute to the process of
identifying cases and guiding people.

•

Most CHWs were able to maintain
care for the population during the
epidemic, sometimes with an increase
in consultations.

•

The scope of action of CHWs varied,
including home visits, meetings for
health education, treatment of acute
diseases such as pneumonia, early
identification of Ebola cases, and
referral of suspected cases to PHC
services.

•

The determining factors for the
positive results were: choice of people
from the community itself; timely
training and supervision with the
development of action protocols;
availability of equipment and
medicines; external functional PHC
services; non-monetary incentives for
