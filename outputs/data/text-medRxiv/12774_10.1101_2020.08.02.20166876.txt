Abstract
Of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody testing performed, those who contemporaneously
experienced a cluster of Covid-19 relevant symptoms in the 1-2 months preceding the antibody
assay were more likely to test positive whereas those who experienced the symptom clustering
in the prior 3-6 months were more likely to test negative. These findings suggest that antibodies
likely wane over a period of months, particularly in relation to the timing of symptoms.

Introduction
Serological studies that involve assaying circulating antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the viral agent
of COVID-19, represent a tractable approach to understanding patterns of exposure and
potential immunity across populations at risk. Amidst legitimate concerns regarding the technical
sensitivity and specificity of certain antibody testing kits, the application of validated assays has
proved useful for estimating the probable prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in a given
community at a particular point in time.1-4 Emerging evidence indicates that an antibody test
result for a given individual also depends on when the test was performed in relation to onset of
symptoms.5

Methods
To clarify the relationship of antibody test results with the timing of symptoms, we analyzed data
collected from a large cohort with SARS-CoV-2 serologic screening.6 Briefly, from May 11, 2020
to June 28, 2020 we enrolled N=6318 active employees working within the Cedars-Sinai Health
System located in Los Angeles County, California. All participants were invited to receive SARSCoV-2 IgG antibody testing (Abbott Architect7) in addition to completing an electronic survey of
questions regarding Covid-19 related symptoms. Based on emerging data, the following 4
symptoms were considered most relevant to Covid-19: anosmia, fever, dry cough, and
myalgias.8,9 All study protocols were approved by the Cedars Sinai institutional review board
and all participants provided written informed consent. We used Pearson’s chi-square tests,
one-way ANOVA, and multivariable regression analyses to examine potential differences in the
timing of symptoms in relation to seroprevalence. All analyses were conducted using R v3.4.1
(R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Results
A total of N=6062 individuals (age 41±12 years, 68% women, 19% Hispanic, 6% black) had
complete data from both the serology testing and symptoms survey. Of those individuals who
reported experiencing any symptoms potentially related to Covid-19 illness in the preceding 6
months (N=3688), a total of 176 (4.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Participants
with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, most frequently reported experiencing at least 1 of the 4 most
relevant Covid-19 related symptoms during the 2 months preceding testing. By contrast, report
of these same symptoms was most frequent during the 3 to 6 months preceding testing, among
those without SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Figure 1A).

Of the N=510 individuals who contemporaneously experienced at least 3 of the 4 most relevant
symptoms, N=95 (19%) had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Figure 1B). Notably, among these
participants, presence of this symptom cluster during the preceding 1 or 2 months was
significantly associated with being seropositive (OR 14.6, 95% CI 8.4-26.6; P<0.001) in ageand sex-adjusted analyses. Conversely, having experienced this symptom cluster during the
preceding 3 or 6 months was significantly associated with being seronegative (OR 19.4, 95% CI
10.7-37.7; P<0.001). Finally, N=158 participants reported receiving a medical diagnosis of
Covid-19 prior to serology testing, of whom 95 (60.1%) did not have measurable SARS-CoV-2
antibodies: the seronegative group was more likely to experience their symptom cluster during
the prior 3 to 6 months rather than within the prior 1 to 2 months leading up to antibody testing
(OR 6.07, 95% CI 2.64-15.86; P<0.001).

Discussion
Across a large diverse cohort of individuals employed in a major metropolitan health system, a
substantial

proportion

with

detectable

SARS-CoV-2

IgG

antibodies

experienced

a

contemporaneous cluster of COVID-19 relevant symptoms (including anosmia, fever, dry cough,
and myalgias) at different timepoints leading up to the serology testing. Importantly, we found
that symptoms were temporally associated with serologic status. Specifically, those who
experienced Covid-19 symptoms within 2 months prior to testing were more likely to have
SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, while those with symptoms in the 3-6 months prior to testing were
more likely to be seronegative. Our findings are consistent with the known limited half-life of
circulating IgG antibodies to other viral agents,10 in addition to emerging results from prior
smaller studies that have directly observed SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies waning over a period of
months.11,12 Our study of potential Covid-19 symptoms is limited by the similarity between
symptoms relevant to Covid-19 and other viral pathogens, such as influenza, which was also
present in the community 3-6 months prior to our study. We attempted to control for this
limitation by focusing on symptom clustering that is more specific to Covid-19, including
anosmia. Further investigations are needed to validate our results and also examine the extent
to which antibody persistence or lack thereof may or may not represent time-dependent
variation in relative immunity to Covid-19. Overall, our study findings offer important context for
clinicians, scientists, and public health officials as part of ongoing efforts to deploy and
interpreting results of antibody testing in populations at large.
