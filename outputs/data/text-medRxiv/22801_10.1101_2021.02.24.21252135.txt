Abstract
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is causing significant morbidity and mortality across the US.
In this ecological study, we identified county-level variables associated with the COVID-19
case-fatality rate (CFR) using publicly available datasets and a negative binomial generalized
linear model. Variables associated with decreased CFR included a greater number of hospitals
per 10,000 people, banning religious gatherings, a higher percentage of people living in mobile
homes, and a higher percentage of uninsured people. Variables associated with increased CFR
included a higher percentage of the population over age 65, a higher percentage of Black or
African Americans, a higher asthma prevalence, and a greater number of hospitals in a county.
By identifying factors that are associated with COVID-19 CFR in US counties, we hope to help
officials target public health interventions and healthcare resources to locations that are at
increased risk of COVID-19 fatalities.

Introduction

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originated in Wuhan,
China in November 2019 and has since spread to 210 countries worldwide.1 By June 12th, 2020,
SARS-CoV-2 had caused over 2 million Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and
114,753 deaths in the United States (US).2,3 The distribution of infected cases and fatalities in the
US has been heterogeneous across counties,4 and identification of sub-populations at risk of
increased morbidity and mortality remains crucial to effective response efforts by federal, state,
and local governments.5 Counties where governing officials are aware that their populations are
at a higher risk of COVID-19 mortality, meaning the population experiences a higher casefatality rate, may opt to tailor state policies or take earlier action to curtail the spread of SARSCoV-2. Additionally, the federal government may opt to target vaccine resources to counties
experiencing higher COVID-19 mortality rates.
The case-fatality rate (CFR) is defined as the number of deaths divided by the total number of
confirmed cases from a given disease.6 When a disease is non-endemic, the CFR fluctuates over
time. During the beginning of an epidemic, there is often a lag when counting the number of
deaths compared to cases and hospitalizations, leading to an underestimation of the CFR.
Furthermore, CFR will fluctuate rapidly early in an epidemic when each additional case or death
has an excessive impact on calculating CFR. It is important to not only account for the lag
between cases and deaths (i.e., lag-adjusted CFR), but also to ensure that the CFR is no longer
fluctuating.
In this study, we use a lag-adjusted CFR to conduct a county-level mortality risk factor analysis
of demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related variables in the US during the first wave of
the COVID-19 pandemic (March 28, 2020 to June 12, 2020). We expand upon prior work by
considering possible risk factors of an increased CFR from multiple categories (e.g., nonpharmaceutical interventions such as shelter-in-place orders,7 prevalence of pre-existing
conditions such as cardiovascular disease,8 and socio-economic circumstances such as hospital
accessibility9) in a single model.

Study Population
We conducted a cross-sectional ecological study to assess risk factors associated with an
increased COVID-19 lag-adjusted CFR in US counties. Our study population included 3,004
counties or county-equivalents with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS), a unique
code for US federal identification. Only publicly available aggregate data were used; therefore,
no IRB approval was required.
County-Level Variables
We identified potential risk factors across several different categories: demographic,
socioeconomic, healthcare accessibility, comorbidity prevalence, and non-pharmaceutical
interventions. Each category targeted variables relevant to the risk of COVID-19 mortality by
conducting a comprehensive literature search on March 28, 2020 supplemented with variables
relevant to other respiratory epidemics (Appendices A1-2).11–14 Only variables with publicly
available data sources at the county- or state-level were included. Appendix A314 lists data
sources, variable descriptions, and manipulations (if applicable). We directly imported and
cleaned the datasets using R (v3.6.3).
Case-Fatality Rate (CFR) Data and Calculation
To calculate CFR during the first COVID-19 wave in the US, we obtained open access countylevel COVID-19 data from the New York Times through June 12, 2020, the date the CDC
released guidance for easing restrictions as states began to reopen.2,15 Only data that contained
FIPS county codes to identify case and death locations were included. County-level data for New
York City, NY was accessed from the New York City Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene.16 To calculate lag-adjusted CFR (laCFR), we used Nishiura et al.’s method, expanded
upon by Russell et al., to account for the delay between COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths.17,18 We
updated this approach by using time-from-hospitalization-to-death from the US population.18,19
Details can be found in Appendix A4.17,18 The final dataset included 1,779 counties with
1,968,739 cases and 106,279 deaths, comprising 96.8% of national cases and 96.8% of national
deaths as of June 12, 2020.

Statistical Analysis
To reduce multicollinearity, we eliminated linear combinations and variables with correlations
>0.5 using the R package caret (v6.0.86). Remaining variables were screened for missingness
and missing values were imputed using five imputations in the R package mice (v3.8.0). Data
were randomly split into training (1,186 counties) and testing sets (593 counties) to assess
generalizability (a table of the characteristics can be seen in Appendix A5). A negative binomial
linear model with an offset for the number of COVID19 cases per county was chosen based on
Kolmogorov-Smirnov and dispersion tests found in the R package DHARMa (v0.3.1). Variable
selection was conducted using purposeful selection, an iterative process in which covariates are
removed from the model if they are neither significant nor confounders.20 With clinical risk
factors, purposeful selection outperforms other variable selection procedures and tests for the
presence of confounders.20 Removing highly correlated variables beforehand reduces the chance
of multicollinearity between non-significant variables that may have been retained in purposeful
selection due to confounding effects. Per Bursac et al., we used the 0.1 α-level for initial
selection using bivariate models and a change of >20% in any remaining model coefficients
compared with the full multivariate model for confounding evaluation.20 All variables in the final
model were significant at the 0.05 α-level, and no statistical confounders were included in the
final model.

Results

Of the 64 variables collected, 22 were retained for analysis after minimizing correlation
(Appendix A3-714). Multiple imputation was used to correct for missingness (less than 2%) in
two of the retained variables, neither of which appeared in the final model.21 Fifteen variables
were significant in bivariate models in the first step of purposeful selection, and were included in
the initial multivariate model. Eight variables were significant in the initial multivariate model
and were retained in the final model. Including variables that were non-significant in the
bivariate models with these eight variables did not significantly change the performance of the
model, as determined by the Likelihood Ratio Test. No potential confounders were identified
among the correlation minimized variables that were previously discarded due to nonsignificance in the models.

The final model is shown in Exhibit 1. The negative binomial model appears to be a good fit,
capturing the mean-variance relationship observed in the data and displaying expected residuals
(Exhibit 2A and 2B). The model was well-calibrated, with the training and testing model having
comparable coverage and relative Gini score (Exhibit 2C and 2D; Appendix A7). Since we used
a negative binomial model with an offset, the exponentiated coefficients represent the change in
laCFR observed for a one-unit increase in each continuous variable, assuming all other variables
in the model are held constant (Exhibit 3). Four variables were inversely associated with laCFR:
number of hospitals per 10,000 people (-39% laCFR per additional hospital per 10,000), banning
religious gatherings during the initial state or county shutdown (-13% laCFR if religious
gatherings were banned), percentage of housing units that were mobile homes (-0.79% laCFR
per 1% increase in the proportion of mobile homes), and percentage of population without health
insurance (-1.5% laCFR per 1% increase in percentage uninsured). Four variables were directly
associated with laCFR: percentage over age 65 (+4.4% laCFR per 1% increase in population
over age 65), percentage Black or African American (BAA) (+0.97% laCFR per 1% increase in
BAA population), percentage with asthma (+9.1% laCFR per 1% increase in asthma prevalence),
and number of hospitals (+3.1% laCFR per one additional hospital). Exhibit 4 demonstrates the
relationship between each variable and the laCFR over a range of values.

Discussion

In this ecological study of mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first wave of
COVID-19 in the US, we found that county-level laCFR was significantly associated with eight
variables. Four variables – banning religious gathering, proportion of mobile homes, hospitals
per 10,000 persons, and proportion of uninsured individuals in a county – were associated with
decreased laCFR. Four variables – percentage of population over age 65, total number of
hospitals per county, prevalence of asthma, and percentage of population BAA – were associated
with increased laCFR. Each variable provided unique insights into factors that may be worth
considering for county-level COVID-19 response efforts.
Inverse Association with Case-Fatality Rate
Our model indicated a 13% reduction in the average laCFR for counties that banned religious
gatherings compared to counties that did not. Gatherings often involve dense mixing of people in

a confined space, sometimes over long periods of time,22 which drives COVID-19
transmission.23 Interventions targeting increased physical distancing and limiting contact were
introduced in some countries, including the closure of schools, places of worship, malls, and
offices.22 Our model suggests that specifically exempting religious gatherings from bans may
increase the laCFR, consistent with the combination of findings that (1) religious gatherings
across the globe were linked to COVID-19 superspreader events24 and (2) older Americans (who
are more likely to attend religious services than younger Americans25) are at increased risk of
death due to COVID-19.
The percentage of the population living in mobile homes was also associated with a decrease in
laCFR. A 1% increase in mobile home living was associated with a 0.79% decrease in laCFR.
While a small difference at first glance, it becomes more meaningful when considering the large
variation in mobile home living across counties. Between counties at the 25th percentile of
percentage living in mobile homes (4%) and 75th percentile (18%), the difference in the
percentage of mobile home living correlated with an 11% decrease in laCFR. This might
represent a built-environment effect, given that mobile homes have separate plumbing and
ventilation unlike apartments and other multi-family residences. Recent work suggests that fecal
aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV2 can occur.26 Ventilation patterns in apartment complexes
represent additional opportunities for transmission.27 The benefit of separate units such as mobile
homes may be especially important to low-income workers who are both more at risk of death
from COVID19 due to increased chance of having a co-morbid condition and more likely to live
in multi-family housing with maintenance issues.28
The number of hospitals per 10,000 was also inversely associated with laCFR. We found that for
each additional hospital per 10,000 inhabitants, the laCFR decreased by 39%, despite the
exclusion of other healthcare-related variables due to non-significance (e.g., ICU bed
availability). Prior work demonstrated that the percentage of ICU and non-ICU beds occupied by
COVID-19 patients directly correlated with COVID-19 deaths,29 and a county with more
hospitals per 10,000 inhabitants may be able to cope with more COVID-19 cases before reaching
the same percentage of hospitals beds occupied as a county with fewer hospitals per 10,000
inhabitants. Furthermore, because adding beds requires fewer resources than adding hospitals,
the number of hospitals per 10,000 persons in a county might represent a greater ability to

expand capacity. As a result, using hospitals per 10,000 may be a better indicator of healthcare
capacity than the number of ICU beds early on in the pandemic. Because healthcare resources in
the US correlate with community wealth,30 the rate of hospitals per 10,000 may also reflect
increased community wealth and the protective effect of higher socio-economic status on health.
More hospitals per 10,000 persons may also represent increased competition for patients, which
is associated with decreased mortality from community-acquired pneumonia.31
Unexpectedly, the percentage uninsured was inversely associated with laCFR. We found a 1.5%
reduction in laCFR for every 1% increase in uninsured inhabitants. Prior studies found longer
travel times to COVID-19 testing facilities were directly associated with percentage
uninsured.32,33 Because uninsured persons may be unable to readily access testing, this finding
may relate to incomplete reporting, such that only individuals who survive long enough are
tested for COVID-19, leading to a potential undercount of deaths attributable to SARS-CoV-2
infection.
Direct Association with Case-Fatality Rate
In our model, a 1% increase in the population over 65 years old was associated with a 4.4%
increase in average laCFR. This is consistent with recent epidemiological studies demonstrating
an association between the severity of COVID-19 infection and age. According to provisional
death data from the National Center of Health Statistics, people aged 65 and older have a 90- to
630-fold higher risk of mortality due to COVID-19 than 18-29-year olds.34
Also directly associated with laCFR was the total number of hospitals per county, with an
observed increase of 3.1% in average laCFR per additional hospital. This variable was strongly
correlated with total population (r=0.92). Given that the number of hospitals per 10,000 was
associated with decreased laCFR, this correlation suggests that total hospitals might be a proxy
indicator for total population. Previous work assessed population density as a risk factor for
increased laCFR, but not total population.23 Since our analysis focused on the first wave of
COVID-19, this variable could reflect overwhelmed healthcare systems in highly populated
counties where most of the COVID-19 cases initially occurred.35

Asthma prevalence was also directly associated with laCFR. A 1% increase in asthma prevalence
was associated with a 9.1% increase in laCFR. Evidence regarding asthma as a risk factor in
COVID-19 is mixed. Although the US CDC has determined that patients with moderate to
severe asthma belong to a high-risk group,36 the Chinese CDC indicated that asthma was not a
risk factor for severe COVID-19.37 One study showed that COVID-19 patients with asthma were
of older age and had an increased prevalence of multiple comorbidities compared to those
without asthma,38 but that the presence of asthma alone was not a risk factor for increased
mortality.38 Thus, despite our findings, it is unclear whether asthma has a direct impact on
COVID-19 disease or if other factors may be associated with both asthma and COVID-19. One
such potential confounder is exposure to air pollution, as air pollution is associated with both
asthma and risk of death from COVID-19.39
Finally, laCFR was directly associated with the percentage of the population identifying as BAA
in a county. Our model showed that a 1% increase in BAA was associated with a 0.97% increase
in the laCFR. This likely reflects the effects of structural racism in the US, where BAAs have
fewer economic and educational opportunities than White Americans and as a result are exposed
to increased risk of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19.40 Dalsania et al. also found that the
social determinants of health contributed to a unequal impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for
BAA at the county level.41 A study by Golestaneh showed that US counties with BAA as the
majority had three times the rate of infection and almost six times the rate of death as majority
White counties.42 Factors underlying this trend include years of structural racism resulting in a
lack of financial resources, increased reliance on public transportation, housing instability, and
dependence on low-paying retail jobs.43 Our approach considered several other variables that
might explain the effect but were either non-significant (e.g., household crowding, percentage of
households without a vehicle, and county land area) or were correlated with percentage BAA
(e.g. percentage single parent households and percentage living in poverty), further emphasizing
the role of systemic racism in COVID-19 laCFR.
Excluded Predictor Variables
In reducing multicollinearity and using purposeful selection, several variables were surprisingly
excluded. One of these excluded variables was population density, although higher population

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.24.21252135; this version posted February 26, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

density had been hypothesized to increase contact rate and non-adherence with physical
distancing.23 Diabetes and cardiovascular disease were excluded, despite multiple studies
reporting these conditions as risk factors for COVID-19 mortality.44,45 While these factors are
important at an individual level to assess the mortality risk, our model suggests that other
variables may be more informative at the county-level, underscoring the value of ecological
studies.
Study Strengths and Limitations
This study had several strengths besides the benefits of an ecological design when considering
population interventions. First, the data were nationally representative, including over 50% of all
US counties. Our model captured the variability in the data and accounted for the observed data
distribution. The model also captured almost all outcomes within the prediction interval for both
training and testing data sets, with similar accuracy between them, which indicates that our
model is generalizable within the US (Appendix A7). Additionally, our model based laCFR
calculations on the distribution of times from hospitalization to death from US data,19 which
differed from earlier Chinese data.37 Using US-based distribution of times likely improved our
laCFR estimation for this study. The final model included several variables previously attributed
to higher laCFR (such as older age)34 and included a variable unique to the pandemic shutdown,
i.e., banning religious gatherings, giving more nuanced insights into heterogeneous COVID-19
mortality rates across counties.
Despite these strengths, our study had several limitations. First, under-reporting of cases might
affect the accuracy of CFR calculation.46 The reported cases and deaths we used likely
underestimated the true COVID-19 parameters. This underestimation was more among the
asymptomatic and mild cases due to limited testing capacity and changes in testing practice;
hence, the laCFR might have appeared inflated. Second, the type and timing of the tests used
may have impacted the measured laCFR. Samples collected early during the infection can yield
higher false negatives with RT-PCR tests.47 False negatives in critically-ill patients who later die
could decrease the measured laCFR unless probable COVID-19 deaths are reported, while false
negatives in mild cases who are not retested later could increase the measured laCFR as
survivable cases go undetected. These are challenges for any CFR study and highlight the

ongoing need for improved COVID-19 testing. Third, COVID-19 reporting practices vary
widely by state. For example, Florida was found to report fewer COVID-19 deaths in the official
tally than the Medical Examiners Commission.48 In addition to deliberate underreporting of
deaths, states also vary in reporting of probable cases and deaths.49 Without national standards in
the COVID-19 response, comparing case counts and deaths across state line–let alone county–is
deterred by lack of clarity about how these data differ.49
Beyond these, our study was also limited by the fact that relevant data were frequently
unavailable, including data on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) and comorbidities. To
limit missingness in the NPI data, we used state-level data when available given that counties
also enforce state-level orders. However, there may be heterogeneity between county- and statelevel information making this a less effective approach. Other variables of interest were not
available at the state- or county-level, including information on contact tracing efforts and
community compliance with public health mandates. Funding to collect public health
information on more variables at a granular level would improve the information available to
guide decision-making during emergencies. Another limitation was the highly correlated nature
of the 64 variables considered for inclusion. Multicollinearity greatly affects the interpretability
of coefficients and is rarely accounted for in epidemiologic studies.50 Highly correlated variables
in a model are unstable and can bias standard errors, leading to unreliable p-values and
unrealistic interpretations.50 Because we ensured our model interpretability by excluding highly
correlated variables, not all of our collected 64 variables were screened for inclusion in the final
model.
Finally, our study period ended in mid-June. This date was chosen because (1) enough cases had
occurred in the US to obtain reliable estimates of laCFR by county and (2) it preceded CDC
reopening guidance and a shift in reporting to the HHS Protect system, which is less readily
available to the public than the prior CDC reporting system.51 The decision by the government
to switch to the HHS Protect system hinders the ability of academic scientists to aid in the
response to the on-going pandemic.51 Making these data more readily available to the public
would permit inclusion of additional data for future research.

This study highlights several variables that were associated with county-level laCFR during the
first wave of COVID-19 in the US. Though further research is needed to examine the effects of
additional NPIs, our work provides insights that may aid in targeting response and vaccination
efforts for improved outcomes in subsequent waves.
