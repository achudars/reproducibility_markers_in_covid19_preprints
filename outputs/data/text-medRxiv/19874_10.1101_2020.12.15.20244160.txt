Abstract
Background: In contrast to developed countries, in Mexico more than half of COVID-19 deaths have
occurred in adults <65-years-old, with at least a million years of life lost to premature mortality (YLL)
in eight months. Mexico has a young population but a high prevalence of metabolic diseases like
obesity and diabetes that contribute to COVID-19 adverse outcomes. COVID-19 could be particularly
risky in population with specific comorbidity combinations that haven’t been analyzed.
Methods: To explore what contributes to the high COVID-19 mortality in Mexican middle-aged
adults, we calculated age-stratified COVID-19 case fatality rates, YLL and relative risk (RR) of 9
comorbidities and 23 comorbidity combinations in a retrospective Mexican cohort with 905,579 PCRconfirmed COVID-19 cases/89,167 deaths, until Nov/2/2020.
Findings: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) had the highest RR for COVID-19 fatality, followed by
diabetes and immunosuppression, that in turn had higher RR than obesity or hypertension as single
comorbidities. The combination diabetes/hypertension with or without obesity had RR as high as
CKD as a single comorbidity (>3 in <60-year-olds). Notably, the RR of comorbidities decreased with
age, tending to values near 1 after age 60; suggesting that in Mexico, comorbidities increase COVID19 fatality mostly in young and middle-aged adults. Our analysis suggests that advanced metabolic
disease, marked by multimorbidity (more than one chronic disease per individual) or diabetes before
age 60, contribute particularly to the younger age of COVID-19 fatalities in Mexico. Around 38% of
YLL to COVID-19, were attributable to the synergy between COVID-19 and pre-existing diseases,
mainly combinations between obesity, diabetes and hypertension. Yet, ¼ of deaths and 1/3 of YLL
have occurred in individuals without known comorbidities.
Conclusions: The Mexican COVID-19 outbreak illustrates that middle-aged adults 45-64-yo can
have high COVID-19 mortality during large outbreaks, especially if they present chronic metabolic
comorbidities, but also in their absence, making them an important group of concern after elders.
COVID-19 mortality in middle-aged adults is likely proportional to the gradual decline in health that

Introduction
Since the initial SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, advanced age, male gender and chronic disease have
been associated with adverse outcomes [1-6], but less is known about COVID-19 fatalities in young
populations [7]. Mexico, with a population younger than world-average (median age 29.3 years-old,
yo), is undergoing a large COVID-19 outbreak with high mortality, similar to that of the USA, Italy
and the UK, despite having only around 1/3 of the proportion of >65-yo of these countries [9-10].
SARS-CoV-2 infections were first detected in Mexico in February 2020 and the first COVID19 death on March/18, 2020 [11]. Eight months later, despite mitigation strategies, Mexico is the
fourth country in cumulative COVID-19 deaths nearing 100,000; it is eight in mortality with almost
80 deaths/100,000 inhabitants [10] and COVID-19 ranks among the three leading causes of death in
the country, along with cardiovascular disease and diabetes [12]. Additionally, Mexico has the second
highest COVID-19 case-fatality in the world (after Yemen) [11], and more than half of the fatalities
have been in adults younger than 65-yo [7].
To explore what contributes to the high COVID-19 fatality in middle-aged adults in Mexico, we
analyzed the first eight months of the outbreak and its relation to preexisting chronic disease. In
Mexico, 36% of adults are obese, 39% overweight, 10-14% diabetic, while 22% have diagnosed
hypertension [13-14]. Thus, the Mexican COVID-19 outbreak includes a large share of young and
middle-aged adults, with a variety of comorbidity combinations. Our analysis is illustrative of the role
of chronic comorbidities in COVID-19 fatality at different ages and of the impact of COVID-19 in
young populations.

Methods
We analyzed COVID-19 datasets updated by Mexican health authorities, available at [15], that
include all symptomatic patients evaluated as probable COVID-19, since outbreak start, along with
their comorbidities and outcomes (retrospective cohort). Datasets arise from a national
epidemiological surveillance system with standardized reporting, described in [16], under World
Health Organization (WHO) case definitions. Patient identity was absent from datasets and
information was managed adhering to the ethical principles of the Helsinki declaration. We analyzed
datasets at regular intervals, from the first available through Nov/2/2020 (end of study), when 905,579
cases had been confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR; of which 89,167 (9.8%) had died (Study
diagram in Figure 1). Cases determined as COVID-19 through epidemiological/clinical evidence,
without RT-PCR were not included.
Measured Case fatality rates (mCFR) were calculated as the percent of cumulative COVID-19
cases that died, by date reported; and mortality as the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths in
100,000 inhabitants. Relative Risk of death (RRd) and 95% CI (confidence interval) were calculated
in GraphPad Prism version 7.0a, with Koopman asymptotic score, excluding cases and deaths with
unknown comorbidity status, at cutoff dates Aug/6 and Sept/12, 2020, that marked >50,000 and
>70,000 COVID-19 deaths in Mexico and comprise the first COVID-19 peak in the country (Fig 2A).
Demographic and medical characteristics of COVID-19 cases and deaths at cutoff dates and at the
end of study (Nov/2/2020), are in Tables S1-S3. Few differences in mCFR and RR were found
between cutoff dates. RR of comorbidities in figures and tables are for the second cutoff
(Sept/12/2020), except when indicated. Student’s T and Fisher’s exact tests were used for numerical
and categorical variables, respectively. Years of life lost to premature mortality (YLL) were
determined for each individual under the age of 70 that died of COVID-19, with the formula:
YLL = (70)- (age of deceased individual)
Multivariate correspondence analyses (CA) of categorical variables and Hierarchical Clustering
of Principal Components (HCPC) with the k-means method, were performed in R through Rstudio,
with libraries factoextra and FactoMineR [17], as in [18].

Results
Eight-month evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak in Mexico (Feb/27 to Nov/2, 2020)
COVID-19 incidence first grew in Mexico from March to July/2020, descended in Aug-Sept and
a potential second peak is evolving since Oct/2020 (Figure 2A). In parallel, the measured case fatality
rate (mCFR), increased sharply during March-April and more slowly during May-June, peaking at
12.4% in late-June (Figure 2B-C), with a slight descent since (9.9% by Nov/2/2020). PCR-positivity
has fluctuated above 40% since April (not shown), suggesting a high rate of undetected cases that
contributes to the large mCFR.
In Mexico, the vast majority (>97%) of COVID-19 cases have been treated in public health
services (not shown). Hospitalized patients have a high mCFR (>35% since July, Figure 2B) and a
high Relative Risk of death (RRd >21 vs the non-hospitalized), that increases with worsening clinical
conditions (Figure 2B; Tables S1-S3). The majority of deaths (55.3%) have been in individuals
hospitalized in non-critical areas, while 11% occurred out-of-hospital (Table S3). Of hospitalized
cases, 20% received critical care (assisted mechanical ventilation, and/or treatment in an intensive
care unit) and account for 33.3% of total deaths (Table S3). The fatality rate in critical areas has been
>50% in ICU (Intensive Care Unit) and 70-80% for patients under AMV (assisted mechanical
ventilation) since July (Figure 2B). Mexico’s mCFR has not decreased after peak incidence as much
as in other countries (Figure 2C), likely driven by low case detection, high hospital fatality [19] and
differences in reporting; for example, only symptomatic COVID-19 cases are included in the Mexican
datasets.

COVID-19 demography during the first wave, in Mexico.
More COVID-19 deaths have happened in males (64%, Tables S1-S3), who have higher mCFR
(Figure 3B) and a RRd around 1.65 vs females, that peaks at ages 20-59 (Figure 4A-B). COVID-19
mortality, mCFR and RRd increase with age (Figure 3 and 4A) and deceased individuals were older
in average than cases (Figure 3A, Tables S1-S4). Yet, in contrast to high income countries, in Mexico
more than half of COVID-19 deaths have been in adults 20-64 yo (52.7%), while adults >65-yo and

children 0-19 yo account for 46.9% and 0.4% of deaths, respectively (until Nov/2/2020) (Figure 3A).
Additionally, in Mexico mCFR and mortality increase at earlier ages than in high income countries,
even in individuals without comorbidity (Figure 3B-E). CFR comparisons are complicated by
differences in testing levels and case reporting [5,20], whereas mortality is a less ambiguous endpoint adjusted by population size. Mexico’s age-stratified COVID-19 mortality was several-fold
higher in 45-75-yo than in high income countries with similar large outbreaks like Italy, the USA and
the UK (all four countries had similar mortality 62-80 deaths/100,000 inhabitants by Nov/2/2020 [2123]).
In Mexico, only a small proportion of the detected cases correspond to children (3.8% cases in
<20-yo, Figure 3A), perhaps in relation to the suspension of in-person education since March, 2020
and to the mildness of cases in that age group, many of which may be undetected. At the other end of
the spectrum, COVID-19 mortality doesn’t increase further after 85-yo (Figure 3C-D), similar to
reported for India [24]. To analyze if this could be due to undercounting of COVID-19 deaths among
elders (for example by incorrect assignment of death causes), we looked at excess mortality: 51,826
and 59,410 excess deaths were reported until epidemiological week 31 in 45-64 and >65-yo in Mexico
[25], corresponding to 203.7 and 604.9 deaths/100,000 inhabitants in each age group, which describes
a similar trend to that of confirmed COVID-19 mortality. Thus, excess mortality doesn’t suggest that
COVID-19 deaths in elders are more undercounted that at other ages. However, further agestratification of excess mortality after 65-yo would be necessary to confirm this.
The higher mCFR and mortality in middle aged-adults in Mexico vs high income countries could
be related to behavioral, environmental, biological/health factors or to access to specialized medical
attention. Since Mexico has a high prevalence of chronic metabolic disease in adults, in the next
section, we explored the relation of COVID-19 fatalities to pre-existing chronic diseases
(comorbidities).

Risk of COVID-19 death contributed by pre-existing medical conditions (comorbidity) in Mexico.

About 74% of individuals that died of COVID-19 had at least one preexisting chronic disease
(Figure 4D; Tables S1-S3), the most common being hypertension, diabetes and obesity, in 43%, 38%
and 25% deaths (and 20%, 16%, 19% cases) (Figure 5). Hypertension and diabetes were found at a
similar prevalence in COVID-19 cases as in the general population [13-14]; while obesity was found
at about half the prevalence in COVID-19 (Figure 5).
COVID-19 patients with comorbidity were older than patients without (Table S4) and there have
been more COVID-19 deaths with comorbidity at older ages (Figure 4C-D), paralleling the increase
in chronic diseases with age in the general population (Figure 5) [13-14]. The relative risk of COVID19 death (RRd) contributed by having any comorbidity in Mexicans, at different ages is in Figure 4EF. The most relevant finding was that the RRd of pre-existing disease decreased sharply with age,
tending to values near 1 in adults >60-yo, as comorbidities were present at similar proportions in
COVID-19 cases and deaths in older age groups (Figure 4C-D).
Next we analyzed the age-stratified mCFR and RRd of 9 specific comorbidities: obesity; diabetes
(DM) without type distinction (>90% diabetes in Mexican adults is type II); hypertension (HT); other
cardiovascular diseases (CVD); chronic kidney disease (CKD); smoking; asthma; chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD); immunosuppression (ImmunoS); and unspecified “other” conditions;
across genders (Table S5) and in age groups (Table 1), as single or multiple comorbidity to COVID19. Little variation was found between cutoff dates (Table 1 vs Table S6) suggesting sufficient
sampling since the first cutoff, except at pediatric ages where dispersion persists.
Comorbidity in COVID-19 deaths was more frequent in females (79% vs 70% in males; age
distribution in Figure 4C) and females had on average more comorbidities per individual than males
(2.03+0.53 in females and 1.88+1.0 in males, p<0.0001, in patients that died from COVID-19).
Females had a slightly higher frequency of all comorbidities, except for smoking, which was 2-3
times more frequent in males (Table S5). The RRd of comorbidity was larger in females (Figure 4EF; Table S5). In both genders the risk was higher with more comorbidities per individual but tended
to 1 in older groups (Figure 4F).
At early ages, “other” diseases, obesity, immunosuppression and asthma predominated. Smoking
and obesity rose in young adults, particularly as single comorbidity; whereas diabetes, hypertension,

COPD and CVD increased at later ages (Figure 6A). The proportion of COVID-19 deaths with one
comorbidity remained stable across ages at ∼30%, but comorbidity combinations increased with age
(Figure 4D). In particular, patients with >3 comorbidities were infrequent at pediatric ages but
represented 16-20% of COVID-19 cases and deaths in >40-yo (Figure 4D). The frequency of specific
combinations of 2 or >3 chronic comorbidities in COVID-19 deaths per age group is displayed in
Figure 6B, Figures S1-S2 and Table S7. The small group of pediatric patients that died from COVID19 and had more than one comorbidity, presented combinations mostly between immune disease,
“other” diseases and/or CKD (Figures S1-S2). In contrast, in adults the most common comorbidity
combinations were between obesity, diabetes and/or hypertension, sometimes with smoking, CKD,
CVD or COPD, in accord to their prevalence in the general population.
Age-stratified RRd from specific comorbidities and their combinations is illustrated in Figure
6C-E, and detailed in Tables 1-2, always using as reference individuals in the same age group without
comorbidity. The RRd increased with multi-morbidity and decreased steeply with age, tending to
values near 1 in older adults, even with multiple diseases. CKD, as single or multiple comorbidity,
had the largest mCFRs and RRds for COVID-19 death at all ages, most prominent in young- and
middle-aged adults (Tables 1-2, Figure 6C-E). Next came immunosuppression and diabetes, that as
single comorbidities, at least doubled the risk of death from COVID-19 in <60-yo, (95% CI >5 in 2039 yo and >2 in 40-59 yo). Obesity and hypertension as single comorbidities had lower RRd than
diabetes, still substantial in young adults (95% CI, 2.7-3.9 in 20-39 yo and 1.5-1.8 in 40-59 yo) (Table
1). In children 5-19 yo, 5.7% of COVID-19 cases and 15.7% of deaths had obesity, peaking at ages
12-19 mostly as a single comorbidity (80% cases and 61% deaths with obesity in children had only
that comorbidity). The RRd from obesity as a single comorbidity in children was 2.7 (95% CI, 1.74.4), despite a low mCFR of 1.8%, and increased with more comorbidities (Table 1).
In adults, comorbidity combinations that included diabetes tended to have larger RRd than
combinations with hypertension or obesity (Tables 1-2, Figure 6C-E, Figure S1). The most common
comorbidity combination in COVID-19 cases and deaths in Mexico was diabetes/hypertension
(DM/HT), that increased with age (peak at 60-79 yo in 13.4% of deaths and 12% of cases, Figure
6B). In turn, up to 6.5% of COVID-19 cases and 8% of deaths had diabetes/hypertension/obesity,

sometimes with smoking and/or CKD (Figure 4b; Figure S2). The prevalence of this triad in COVID19 cases and deaths, peaked at ages 50-79 (Figure 6C; Figure S2). The RRd of combinations of
diabetes/hypertension with or without obesity was as high as that of CKD as a single comorbidity
(RRd>3 in <60-yo; Figure 6C-E; Table 2). Next in frequency came the combination
Obesity/Hypertension (Ob/HT) that had lower RRd than diabetes as a single or multiple comorbidity
(Figure 6B-D, Tables 1-2). Obesity’s prevalence in the general population peaks in 40-49 yo and then
decreases. Accordingly, COVID-19 comorbidity combinations that included obesity, also peaked at
younger ages than other combinations.
Similar to other populations [26-31], smoking and asthma as single comorbidities, had RRd near
1 in Mexicans (Figure 6C-E, Table 1). For smoking, the RRd was lower in females, but below 1 in
each gender (Table S5); and when breaking down by age groups it was below 1 only in 20-39 yo
(Table 1). This is compatible with smoking’s health hazards being more notorious after chronic
consumption and often observed at older ages. In the Mexican population, the estimated prevalence
of current smoking is at least double than found in COVID-19 cases (Figure 5B), which could be due
to underreporting in the COVID-19 dataset or be related to the low risk found. Smokers in COVID19 cases were similar to the estimated prevalence of daily smokers in the Mexican population (Figure
5B). Details about smoking habits, were unavailable for analysis in the COVID-19 datasets. The RRd
of smoking increased substantially when combined with other pre-existing diseases, even in young
adults (Tables 1-2).
In summary, in Mexico the RR of pre-existing chronic diseases for COVID-19 death, depends
on patient’s age and on the type and number of comorbidities. Our analysis suggests that the risk
contributed by most comorbidities is large in children, young and middle-aged adults and decreases
substantially with age, tending towards 1 in adults >60-yo. The frequent combinations of diabetes and
other disease(s), that suggest advanced metabolic disease, increases risk of COVID-19 death more
than 7-fold in adults 20-39 yo and more than 2.5-fold in 40-59 yo.

Multivariate Correspondence Analysis and Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components.
Multivariate correspondence analysis, a statistical technique to reduce dimensions in data while
preserving variation; with subsequent clustering of principal components, detected three clusters that
separated COVID-19 outcomes in Mexicans (Figure S3). Favorable outcomes like no-hospitalization,
no-pneumonia, and being alive at cutoff date, correlated with ages 0-39, and with having no
comorbidity or presenting only asthma or smoking. At the opposite end, ages >60-yo, correlated with
adverse outcomes like hospitalization, pneumonia, intubation and death, along with having >3
comorbidities and/or pre-existing conditions like CKD, diabetes, hypertension, CVD or COPD. A
middle cluster included ages 40-59 and comorbidities like obesity and immunosuppression. These
associations parallel those described in the previous section, and support the age-group partitions used
for RR analyses.

Years of life lost to premature COVID-19 mortality (YLL) during the first eight months of the outbreak
in Mexico.
YLL to COVID-19 were calculated using age 70 as the threshold for premature mortality, to
observe distribution across genders, age-groups, and specific comorbidities. At end of study
(Nov/2/2020,), of the 89,000 COVID-19 deaths with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in Mexico,
66.5% corresponded to individuals <70-yo and amounted to almost 880,000 YLL, with an important
contribution from middle-aged males (Figure 7A, Table S8). Most YLL (69%) derived from
individuals with at least one comorbidity (31.4% and 37.6% from individuals with one and more than
one comorbidities, respectively); while 31% of YLL came from individuals without known
comorbidity. Individuals that died from COVID-19 without know comorbity lost on average more
years or life that those with comorbitiy (16.4 vs 14.2 years/individual that died under the age of 70).
The comparison between YLL in population with and without comorbidity, suggests that in
Mexico ~38% of YLL, have been lost due to the co-occurence of COVID-19 and chronic disease
(Table S8). Related to their high prevalence in the general population, obesity, diabetes and

hypertension participate in the most YLL from COVID-19 in Mexico, in particular when in
combination with another chronic disease (multimorbidity). These common comorbidities surpass the
YLL from conditions with higher RRd, like CKD (Figure 7B). YLL calculated here are largely
underestimated because not all COVID-19 deaths have been detected in Mexico, as suggested by
excess mortality analyses [25], plus we excluded the >3,000 deaths determined as COVID-19 in the
absence of RT-PCR. Eight months into the Mexican outbreak likely over a million years of life have
been lost to COVID-19.
Discussion
Despite its young population, Mexico is among the ten top countries in COVID-19 mortality,
with ~7.5% of world deaths. We described four components of this high mortality that deserve
attention. First, Mexico has high COVID-19 case fatality, not in decline as in other countries, driven
by low testing and high hospital-fatality. Quality and timing of medical attention await more analysis
to tackle this trend [19]. Second, the risk contributed by comorbidities decreases with age in
Mexicans, because adults >60-yo have high fatality rates even in the absence of pre-existing disease.
Third, more than half of COVID-19 fatalities have occurred in adults younger than 65-yo, in contrast
to high-income nations. This is related to a rise in COVID-19 mortality and case fatality starting at
ages 45-50, due in part to chronic comorbidities in middle-aged adults in Mexico. In particular
individuals that accumulate more than one chronic metabolic disease lead to a large toll of years of
life lost to premature mortality from COVID-19. Fourth, ¼ of deaths and ~1/3 of YLL have occurred
in individuals without known comorbidity, specially males 40-60 yo.
We propose that all these observations fall on the spectrum of gradual health decline that
accompanies aging. Given that a large proportion of Mexican adults are obese (36%) or overweight
(39%) [13-14], environmental and genetic factors that favor metabolic disease could be contributing
to early-aging in Mexicans, first driving metabolic-inflammation then leading to-, or merging with-,
age-related inflammation. Both ultimately contribute to immune senescence and undermine the
chances of clearing infection. Undiagnosed/subclinical metabolic disease, or being overweight,
glucose-intolerant, malnourished, sarcopenic or exposed to pollutants, may contribute to adverse

COVID-19 outcomes along this spectrum, by favoring lung, metabolic and immune-senescence [45,32-35]. Our analysis agrees with aging as a main independent risk factor for COVID-19 fatality,
and with chronic diseases as important markers of aging. A shift towards middle-age distribution of
COVID-19 fatalities is likely not unique to Mexico and awaits systematic exploration in other lowand middle-income populations [7].
Our analysis provides information to distinguish vulnerable subpopulations for special attention
during outbreaks and for SARS-CoV-2 immunization, when available; and is compatible with the
emerging knowledge about risks of comorbidity for COVID-19 [6,26-48]. Additionally, we provide
new information on the age-stratified relative risk of 23 specific comorbidity-combinations that can
be extrapolated to other populations. CKD has emerged as the comorbidity with the highest risk for
COVID-19 death [6,26,38-41]. Common comorbidity combinations, like diabetes/hypertension with
or without obesity, have RRd as high as that of CKD, related to their pathogenesis with chronic
inflammation that alters the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 [42-43]. Hypertension, diabetes,
COPD and CVD are markers of the aged population and contribute a low organ reserve to resist
severe infection [6,26,32-35,42]. We estimate that in Mexico, up to ~38% of YLL, have been lost due
to the synergy between COVID-19 and chronic disease (Table S8), specially obesity, diabetes and
hypertension (Figure 6B). Plus, our analysis suggests that advanced metabolic disease, as marked by
diabetes or by multimorbidity, substantially increases the RR of COVID-19 death in adults <60-yo
and could account for some of the differences in mortality between countries. In Mexico and other
world regions, obesity and metabolic disease have been shifting towards disadvantaged
socioeconomic groups [49] that are also more exposed to SARS-CoV-2 [50].
Importantly, our analysis highlights that during large COVID-19 outbreaks, fatalities in middleage adults rise, making them a group of concern after elders. Mexico and USA have similar agestratified prevalence of obesity and diabetes (Table S9) [13-14,51-53], yet Mexico has much larger
COVID-19 mortality in 45-74 yo (Figure 3D). These differences can be related to the bigger toll of
chronic diseases in poorer populations [52,54], and to less access to quality medical attention in
Mexico, both for the control of chronic diseases and for COVID-19. In Mexico more than half of
COVID-19 deaths have happened while hospitalized in non-critical areas, suggesting that the

healthcare system remains stressed. Thus, our analysis is important evidence that mortality in middle
aged adults can increase during large outbreaks when hospitals become saturated.
Strengths of our study include a large sample that allowed multiple age and comorbiditycombination analyses. Limitations, include lack of detail about the severity and treatment of the
studied comorbidities and uncertainty about underreporting of underlying diseases. Diabetes and
hypertension were found in COVID-19 cases at a similar age-stratified prevalence to the generalpopulation’s, which doesn’t suggest underreporting; but underreporting of obesity cannot be ruled
out. Overweight adults were undistinguishable in the COVID-19 dataset, which lacks body-massindex details. Being overweight may contribute to adverse COVID-19 outcomes in a subset of the
adults classified as “without comorbidity”, and should be studied.
Conclusions
The high COVID-19 mortality in middle-aged adults in Mexico is partially explained by the
synergy with chronic metabolic diseases, in particular combinations between diabetes, hypertension
and obesity. Differences in age of COVID-19 mortality between the rich and the poor around the
world, likely reflect health and nutrition disparities that accelerate metabolic and inflammatory aging,
and economic insecurity that difficult sheltering from the virus and access to quality medical attention.
Middle-aged adults, can be vulnerable during large COVID-19 outbreaks, second to the elderly, in
particular where large economic and health disparities exist.
Acknowledgments: We dedicate this manuscript to the Mexican health workers who have lost their
lives to COVID-19 during 2020, and to the persisting efforts of those alive, who throughout the
country, have compiled the data analyzed here. Through their national effort, the Mexican COVID19 datasets currently constitute among the largest COVID-19 cohorts for open analysis in the world.

Mexico at different time-points in the outbreak, from bottom to top: July/4 at 30,000 deaths; Aug/6 at 50,000
deaths; Sept/12 at 70,000 deaths; and Oct/4 at 79,000 deaths, to show outbreak progression. Different age groups
were used in (C) and (D-E) to adapt to the age-partitions reported by other countries. In (E) COVID-19 deaths
in Mexico with- (solid line) and without- comorbidity (discontinuous line), were separated and mortality was
calculated over the total inhabitants in each age group, at end of study: 89,000 deaths (black lines) and at 50,000
deaths (gray lines). Overall mortality at end of study is shown in circles for Mexico and in a red line for Italy,
and correspond to the same curves as in (C), as reference.

Figure 4. RR of COVID-19 fatality, contributed by age (A), gender (B), or chronic comorbidity
(E-F) in Mexico. (C) Percent of COVID-19 cases (gray) and deaths (black) with at least one
comorbidity. (D) Age-group distribution of cases and deaths, with 0, 1, 2, or >3 comorbidities. In (F),
gray are females and black, males. 95% CI (confidence intervals) are displayed in (A,B,D) as
whiskers. Dotted horizontal line marks RRd=1 and in (B), discontinuous horizontal line marks the
overall RRd=1.62 calculated for males vs females (all ages). Data correspond to the cutoff date,
Aug/6/2020, with >50,000 deaths; except in (A) where data for the second cutoff (Sept/12/2020) and
for end of study (Nov/2/2020) are also shown. In (C-F) only individuals with known comorbidity
status were included.

Figure 5. Frequency of comorbidities in COVID-19 in Mexico, (A) comorbidities in COVID-19
cases (gray) and deaths (black), along the 2020 Mexican outbreak. Abbreviations as in text. (B-C)
Frequency of comorbidities in COVID-19 cases (white bars) compared with their estimated
prevalence in the Mexican general population (black bars), as reported by health authorities for 2018
[13-14]. In (B), different bars show current smoker and daily smokers for the general population as
reported in [14].

Figure 6. Frequency (A-B) and RRd (C-E) of specific comorbidities for COVID-19 in Mexico
across age groups. In (A-B), COVID-19 cases (solid line) and deaths (dotted line), with each
comorbidity, either as single or as multimorbidity, are displayed preserving the color code for each
disease. (B) shows the most frequent disease combinations found as COVID-19 comorbidity. (C-E)
are different visualizations of the RRd found: (C-D) display the 95% CI, and (E) the trend across
ages. Single comorbidities are compared to the common comorbidity combinations:
obesity/diabetes/hypertension (Ob-DM-HT); diabetes/hypertension (DM-HT); diabetes/obesity
(DM-Ob) and obesity/hypertension (Ob-HT). The first two combinations overlap with the RRd of
CKD as a single comorbidity (orange). (D) Amplifies a fraction of (C) for improved visualization of
RRd in age groups >40-yo. Horizontal dotted line marks RRd=1. Data correspond to the second cutoff
date Sept/12/2020 (>70,000 deaths), excluding individuals with unknown comorbidity status. Disease
abbreviations as in text.
