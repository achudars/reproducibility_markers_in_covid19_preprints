Abstract:
Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been the primary tool used by governments and
organizations to mitigate the spread of the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19. Natural
experiments are currently being conducted on the impact of these interventions, but most of
these occur at the subnational level - data not available in early global datasets. We describe
the rapid development of the first comprehensive, labelled dataset of 1640 NPIs implemented at
federal, provincial/territorial and municipal levels in Canada to guide COVID-19 research. For
each intervention, we provide: a) information on timing to aid in longitudinal evaluation, b)
location to allow for robust spatial analyses, and c) classification based on intervention type and
target population, including classification aligned with a previously developed measure of
government response stringency. This initial dataset release (v1.0) spans January 1st, and
March 31st, 2020; bi-weekly data updates to continue for the duration of the pandemic. This
novel dataset enables robust, inter-jurisdictional comparisons of pandemic response, can serve
as a model for other jurisdictions and can be linked with other information about case counts,
transmission dynamics, health care utilization, mobility data and economic indicators to derive
important insights regarding NPI impact.

Background and Significance:
Since the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Canada in January 2020, there have been a
total of 30,968 reported cases and 1,271 reported deaths as of April 16, 2020 1. In the absence
of population immunity or an effective medical treatment, traditional public health interventions
(e.g. physical distancing, testing, contact-tracing, and hand hygiene) are critical to protect
population health2,3. These non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been the primary tool
employed by governments and organizations to reduce the spread of the virus, and avoid the
possibility that peak case numbers overwhelm healthcare capacity2,4,5. In Canada, NPIs have
included the closure of borders and bans on non-essential travel, as well as the imposition of
voluntary or mandatory physical distancing measures.
While some NPI policies have been implemented at a national scale, much of the authority and
responsibility to oversee rollout of these policies falls on provincial, territorial, and municipal
governments6. As such, there has been substantial variability in what, when, and how NPIs
have been implemented across Canada — highlighting the importance of a subnational lens of
data gathering and analysis.
We present the first comprehensive, open dataset containing detailed information about all
publicly available NPIs that have been implemented by governments and major private
organizations in Canada in response to COVID-19. To ensure a comprehensive review that
captures jurisdictional differences, we collect NPIs at the Canadian federal level, in all ten
provinces and three territories, as well as in the twenty largest Census Metropolitan Areas
(CMAs). Each intervention is labelled based on timing, location, intervention type, target
population, and a previously developed measure of government response stringency.
The ultimate value of this dataset is to help researchers and policy-makers make sense of the
first phase of NPIs, which are essentially a set of natural experiments occurring across the
globe. The first of its kind in Canada, this dataset enables research characterizing the nature of
Canada’s COVID-19 response at a regional level. Regional NPI data can now be linked with
other information about case counts, transmission dynamics, health care utilization, mobility
data and economic indicators to derive important insights regarding NPI impact. Moreover, each
Canadian region can be compared to other Candian or international jurisdiction to facilitate
comparative analyses. We hope this dataset can also serve as a model for subnational NPI data
collection from other jurisdictions.
Dataset Generation Methods:
In this dataset, we define a non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) as any publicly-announced
program, statement, enforceable order, initiative, or operational change originating from any
public or private organization in response to COVID-19—whether to curtail its transmission or
mitigate its social and economic ramifications. This includes distancing measures (including
closures), infection control measures (excluding vaccination or medical treatment), testing
strategies, public announcements, media campaigns, and social and fiscal measures, among

others. Broadly, these are all parameters that influence the behaviour of individuals in an effort
to limit the spread and economic impact of COVID-193.
Review Team Composition
Primary review was performed by the COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group: NonPharmaceutical Interventions, a 34-member team primarily composed of medical students and
graduate students from the University of Toronto. This team was recruited one of the authors via
a standardized onboarding process.
Selection of sources:
We identified NPIs implemented at all different levels of government, including the Canadian
federal level, provincial and territorial level, and the municipal level for the 20 largest CMAs in
Canada (see Supplementary Material, Table S1). We also included NPIs implemented by
private organizations at these regional levels. For the first version of the dataset, we conducted
a comprehensive scan of all COVID-19-related NPIs and changes to testing requirements or
case definitions between January 1st and March 31st, 2020. Future versions will be updated
every 2 weeks until the pandemic ends. Interventions were recorded only for the administrative
level responsible for them, such that an intervention recorded at the provincial level was not
repeated at the municipal level.
Articles were selected through a comprehensive online environmental scan, which is
appropriate for the rapidly evolving nature of the ongoing pandemic and the variety of avenues
through which information is announced8 (Figure 1). A hierarchy of preferred sources was used
to identify and code interventions (Supplementary Material Table S4). First, official government
sources were reviewed in full and any COVID-19-related announcements were identified as the
gold standard for data inclusion. Government sources include press releases on the official
websites of provincial and territorial governments, Ministries of Health, or Provincial Public
Health Commissions. Second, additional information was identified using purposive search
methods for COVID-19-related articles and online reports from accredited news agencies.
Finally, we include updates provided by the official social media accounts of governmental or
public health institutions — such as provincial Chief Medical Officers of Health.
Data extraction and NPI classification schema
For each source, after an initial verification check for redundancy with a previous announcement
of the same NPI was completed, information was systematically extracted using a consistent
format (Supplementary Material Table S2).
Each NPI was labelled with a free-text summary and categorical classifiers describing the
nature of the intervention and its target population. Given the shifting nature of the pandemic
response, our list of categories was iteratively expanded and adjusted as novel classes of NPIs
were identified. If a reviewer was uncertain regarding the appropriate classifier to select, the
item was flagged and discussed collectively until consensus was obtained by at least 3 authors.

Our consensus labelling schema contained 63 classes. Additional to these, the interventions
could be assigned one of 13 labels aligned with the methodology of the Oxford COVID-19
Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT)7. The Oxford group defines 13 interventions in 3
broad categories: decisions related to public gatherings (distancing), financial indicators, and
testing and tracing categories. (The OxCGRT group also defines an Oxford Stringency Index
using simple scoring of the 7 distancing measures, details of which are provided in
Supplementary Material Table S3.)
Data validation
To ensure data was recorded in a consistent format by each reviewer, we established a
streamlined onboarding protocol and a step-wise data-entry process. Standardized data entry
forms and skip patterns were also used to minimize data input errors. The data was audited for
consistency by evaluating the relative proportions of specific intervention categories between
regions. A focused second review of the dataset was also performed by a subset of authors to
identify discrepancies and further standardize for consistency and accuracy across reviewers
and jurisdictions.
Dataset Characteristics
We identified information on 1,640 interventions from 899 unique source URLs and 199 unique
source organizations across the federal government, all 10 provinces and 3 territories, and the
20 largest CMAs in Canada. This version of the dataset covers interventions starting between
January 1st (24 days before the first case was reported in Canada 9) and March 31st 2020
inclusive, with time being recorded on a daily basis and the median intervention date falling
between March 15 and March 24 at a provincial level. The distribution of interventions by daily
count over time is shown in Figure 2A.
There are 63 categories of intervention in this schema in addition to the 13 OxCGRT
interventions. Interventions are also classified based on 13 categories of target populations. The
top 15 intervention categories are enumerated in Table 1 with a single example provided for
each category. The classes are imbalanced, and most (55%) are classified under the Oxford
classification in addition to our categories. The top intervention categories without a
corresponding Oxford response category are public announcements, general case
announcements, and healthcare facility restrictions. Not all intervention categories are recorded
in each jurisdiction. Figure 2B shows the variation in the number of unique intervention
categories recorded in each region covered by the dataset. Two of the 63 categories were not
assigned to an intervention in the first dataset release.
Example Dataset Use
We provide a few examples highlighting the utility of this dataset which uniquely contains
longitudinal, geographic, and stringency data on NPIs from across Canada:

Provincial and territorial Stringency Index over time
Combining the longitudinal, geographic and strincency features of the dataset, we illustrate the
evolution of Oxford Stringency Index for each province over time, which highlights differences in
subnational decision-making (Figure 3). For this figure, intervention records that fall into one of
the seven categories that qualify for computing the Oxford Stringency Index were used (675 out
of 1,640 interventions records). The index was established and tracked daily at the provincial
and territorial level. The WHO announcement declaring a global pandemic on March 11th 10 was
selected as a reference date.
Time-to-intervention variation across provinces and territories
The jurisdictional and temporal granularity of this dataset allows comparison across provinces
and territories of each region’s latency of response to COVID-19. As an example, we show the
time-to-intervention for two major NPIs that were instituted in all 13 provinces and territories:
declaration of state of emergency (including public health emergency) and school closure. We
plot these NPIs on a timeline relative to the first case of and first death due to COVID-19 in
each province or territory to visually estimate a time-to-intervention (Figure 4).
Discussion
We have created the first comprehensive dataset of NPIs in response to COVID-19 across
Canada that is being made openly available to researchers. Our dataset allows for the
comparison of different regions in space and time with regard to their use of NPIs, through both
descriptive characterization of the NPIs themselves as well as through time-series based
linkage with other data sources (e.g. case and mortality counts, testing, mobility) to enable
further analyses of the epidemic’s trajectory in Canada.
The bulk of existing work done on NPIs has been limited to groups simulating the effect of NPIs
in mathematical models2 or creating region-based collections of NPIs to answer a specific
question5,11,12. To our knowledge, little work has been done to systematically compile and
update NPIs subnationally. While there have been efforts to capture NPIs in the United States at
the county level, the data needs to be requested from the user which presents a barrier to
access as compared to an open-access download link13.
The use of NPIs to combat COVID-19 spread is fundamentally a local issue, in which decisionmakers are best guided by data specific to their own locale. While the scope and scale of
initiatives such as OxCGRT7 or the Assessment Capacities Project (ACAPS) ‘government
measures’ dataset14 is commendable, these datasets lack uniform granularity in subnational
coverage (neither dataset includes subnational entries for Canada at the time of writing). Thus,
the emphasis of our work is predominantly its applicability to the Canadian context, while also
ensuring compatibility with existing work at the international level.
This dataset has the capacity to enable a wide range of research — both urgently as decisionmakers are tasked with understanding and managing Canada’s immediate pandemic response,
and in the long-term as retrospective work seeks to understand the nature of this response and

how it may be improved for the next pandemic. Given that these public health measures are
fundamentally based on the non-occurrence of outcomes (in this case, COVID-19 infections and
deaths), such analyses are critical in evaluating the value and appropriateness of various
components of the public health response and answering questions about what “should” have
been done and when.
Linkages with external sources of high-resolution epidemiologic data 1, healthcare capacity data,
economic impact data, and other subnational NPI datasets (as they become available) will be
critical in enabling further research. Our future work involves making these linkages, and
providing researchers with streamlined and comprehensive access to high-quality, multi-modal
data on the COVID-19 pandemic. We are also seeking to align our data into the global work
being done by groups such as OxCRT to allow for robust global analyses. We will continue to
update this dataset and others, as well as to offer these analyses, for the duration of the
pandemic.
Limitations
Due to our reliance on public information and releases in creating this dataset, it is possible that
interventions that were not publicly announced may have been omitted from the dataset. For
example, Nunavut is offering up to $5000 in support for businesses in the territory, but they give
no indication of the number of eligible businesses15, and thus we could not compute and report
a total fiscal value. Similarly, testing policy changes that were not communicated directly to the
public through online announcements, such as substantial shifts in practice occurring within
public health units and hospitals (e.g. whether or not a testing referral is accepted), may not
have been captured in this dataset.
There is inherent variability in how different jurisdictions choose to report and describe their
NPIs, as well as the range of information that they choose to include or not include. This may
have introduced a degree of variability in our labelling. We have sought to minimize
inconsistencies across jurisdictions and reviewers through the aforementioned standardized
onboarding process, step-wise data-entry, and a secondary, focused review by a smaller group
of reviewers prior to data release. Moreover, as residual variation is likely due to subjective
differences rather than error, the open nature of our data allows for end users to suggest future
improvements to our dataset or download it to make modifications to suit their specific research
needs.
Conclusion:
In just over a month since the declaration of the COVID-19 global pandemic, we have
assembled a comprehensive dataset of non-pharmaceutical interventions at the national and
subnational level in Canada (which we will continue to update at two-week intervals throughout
the pandemic). By capturing data about NPIs at a fine spatio-temporal resolution and presenting
it publicly, we have provided researchers, analysts, and the public a means of evaluating policy
responses while the course of the pandemic can still be altered. Researchers can now link NPI
data to outcome datasets such as case and mortality counts, healthcare resource use, and

testing to help determine the most effective and efficient distancing and re-opening strategies.
This will be critical if further pandemic waves are to come. Perhaps most importantly, this
dataset enables analysis at the provincial, territorial, and municipal levels, where the most
impactful decisions will likely be made in Canada. We hope this dataset can act to inform rapid
evidence-based policymaking to help flatten the curve, as well as to support retrospective
analyses in understanding the spread of COVID-19 in Canada.

Calculation of the Oxford Stringency Index
The Oxford Stringency Index (OSI) is a simple score calculated using a sum of the first 7 of 13
classes (S1 to S7).5 For S5, a score of 0 or 1 is given, and for the other six types, a score
between 0 and 3 is given depending on the strictness of the government measure. Each score
is then scaled to take a value between 0 and 100 and the seven scores are averaged to get the
composite stringency index. For instance, a generalized, recommended school closing
announcement would correspond to a score of 2 out of 3, resulting in the final score of 67. This
index is indicative of the number and the strictness of different government interventions, but
should not be interpreted as effectiveness. Our dataset allows us to compute this index for each
province and territory to better understand the evolution of government response across
Canada over time.
