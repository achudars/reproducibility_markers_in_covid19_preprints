Background. Recent in vitro studies have shown fluoxetine inhibits the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) pathogen and one clinical study reported fluoxetine
exposure at a median dose of 20mg in patients with the SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) had a significantly lower risk of intubation and death. The aim of this study is to
conduct in silico population dosing simulations to quantify the percentage of patients achieving a
trough level for the effective concentration resulting in 90% inhibition (EC90) of SARS-Cov-2
as reported in Calu-3 human lung cells.
Methods. Population pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for a structural one-compartment
model with first-order absorption was used to simulate fluoxetine concentration-time data. A
population of 1,000 individuals were simulated at standard fluoxetine doses (20mg/day,
40mg/day, and 60mg/day) to estimate the percentage of the patients achieving a trough level for
the EC90 SARS-Cov-2 inhibitory concentration at each day throughout a 10-day treatment
period. All analyses were conducted via statistical programming in R.
Results. Standard fluoxetine antidepressant doses resulted in a range of 79% to 97% of the
patient population achieving a trough target plasma concentration of 25.1 ng/ml which translates
to lung-tissue distribution coefficient of 60-times higher (EC90 of 4.02 μM). At a dose of 40mg
per day, at least 85% of patients will reach the trough target EC90 concentration within 3-days.
The findings of this pharmacokinetic dosing study corroborate both in vitro and observational
clinical study findings showing fluoxetine inhibits the SARS-Cov-2 pathogen at commonly
treated doses in the practice of psychiatry.

The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine is a racemic mixture of two
stereoisomers, (R)-fluoxetine and (S)-fluoxetine, and maintains regulatory approvals for a widearray of clinical indications in the practice of psychiatry. Two recent, in vitro, studies showed
fluoxetine inhibits replication of the Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus-2 (SARS-Cov-2)
pathogen (Schloer et al., 2020; Zimniak et al., 2020). Specifically, Zimniak et al. reported that
following a 3-day incubation period of fluoxetine in Vero cells, inoculated at a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 0.5, resulted in the median maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 387
ng/ml (1.1 μM) and further found a concentration of 800 ng/ml (2.3 μM) significantly inhibited
SARS-Cov-2 replication (Zimniak et al., 2020). Similarly, Schloer et al. found that fluoxetine
significantly decreases SARS-Cov-2 titers, after a 48-hour incubation period, in both African
green monkey kidney epithelial Vero E6 cells (EC50 = 0.69 μM and 90% maximal effective
concentration [EC90] = 1.81 μM, MOI=0.01) and human-lung Calu-3 cells (EC50 = 0.82 μM
and EC90 = 4.02 μM, MOI=0.1) (Schloer et al., 2020). Taken together, these in vitro studies
prove in a dose-dependent manner, the SSRI fluoxetine inhibits the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen
known to cause the worldwide pandemic, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Short Title: Fluoxetine PK dosing in SARS-Cov-2

Considering the well-established clinical symptoms of COVID-19 affecting the lungs, fluoxetine
lung concentrations would be an important factor to consider when interpreting any study results.
Johnson et al. reported human-tissue concentrations, in airline pilots, of fluoxetine in wholeblood ranged from 0.021-1.4 μg/ml and lung concentrations ranged from 1.56 μg/ml to 51.9
μg/ml, leading to a fluoxetine distribution coefficient of 60 (Johnson, Lewis & Angier, 2007).
Clinically, the fluoxetine SARS-Cov-2 in vitro findings were corroborated by Hoertel et al. who
showed in a multicenter observational retrospective cohort study of patients who were treated
with fluoxetine and diagnosed with COVID-19, experienced a lower risk of intubation and death
(hazard ratio=0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.73, p=0.007) at a median fluoxetine dose of
20mg (standard deviation [SD]=4.82) (Hoertel et al., 2020). In this context, the aim of this study
is to conduct in silico population pharmacokinetic dosing simulations to quantify the percentage
of patients expected to achieve the trough effective concentration resulting in 90% inhibition of
SARS-Cov-2.

Pharmacokinetic Model
Pharmacometric model estimates for differential equation parameters and respective variances
for a structural one-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first-order absorption were used to
simulate fluoxetine concentration-time data. Model estimates were derived from drug plasma
concentrations in 25 females taking a mean dose of 29.4 mg (7.5-80 mg/day) when fluoxetine
plasma levels were at steady-state due to being collected for analysis at a minimum median time
of fluoxetine treatment of greater than 40-days (Tanoshima et al., 2014). The following
parameters were used: volume of distribution (Vd) value of 20.5 liters (variance [ω], 1.24),
clearance rate (CL) value of 13.3 liters/hour (ω=0.052), and absorption rate (Ka) of 0.016
(1/hour) (ω=0.231) (Tanoshima et al., 2014).

Target fluoxetine plasma concentration to achieve EC90 lung concentration
The molecular weight of fluoxetine hydrochloride is 345.8 g/mol and the reported EC50 (0.82
μM) and EC90 (4.02 μM) values from the Schloer et al. study is equivalent to: EC50 = 283.6
ng/ml and EC90 = 1390.1 ng/ml, respectively. With the whole-blood to plasma fluoxetine
concentration – that is the fraction unbound in plasma – being 0.94 and having whole-blood to
lung distribution coefficient of 60, the EC50 and EC90 values would need to be 6% higher than
the aforementioned EC50 and EC90 results to then scale the final expected plasma concentration
to 1/60 that of the final lung concentration (Sommi, Crismon & Bowden, 1987; Johnson, Lewis
& Angier, 2007). For all calculations, the trough target plasma concentration is referenced from
the Schloer et al. study who reported after a 48-hour incubation period in Calu-3 lung cells the
90% maximal effective concentration is 4.02 μM (Schloer et al., 2020) which is significantly
higher than the EC90 in Vero E6 cells (1.81 μM) and EC50 results from Zimniak et al. and the
Schloer et al. studies (Schloer et al., 2020; Zimniak et al., 2020).
Dosing Simulations
To estimate the percentage of patients from a population of one thousand simulated patients who
would achieve the trough target EC90 concentration, pharmacokinetic dosing of fluoxetine will
consist of three dosing trials of fluoxetine: 20mg/day, 40mg/day, and lastly 60mg per day.
Software and Statistics
All pharmacokinetic dosing simulations are conducted with a population of 1,000 patients using
mrgsolve and pharmacokinetic parameter estimates using PKNCA in R (R Core Team, 2015).
Statistical results providing percentage estimates are calculated from trough concentrations of
patients achieving the effective concentrations and is referenced from the Schloer et al. study
reporting the EC90 value in human-lung Calu-3 cells. The whole-blood to plasma ratio of
fluoxetine is 0.94 due to being 94% bound to plasma proteins (Sommi, Crismon & Bowden,
1987).

The fraction of fluoxetine unbound in human plasma is 94%, which requires a 6% increase in
plasma levels to achieve whole-blood concentrations to subsequently approximate the blood:lung
tissue distribution ratio of 1:60 (Johnson, Lewis & Angier, 2007). Therefore, the new target
fluoxetine lung concentration decreasing the SARS-Cov-2 titers by 90% is 1473.5 ng/ml (1390.1
[original, 4.02 μM] + 83.4 ng/ml [6% of original]) and 1/60 of this concentration is the new
EC90-plasma concentration of 25.1 ng/ml. The percentage of the 1,000 simulated patients
achieving the trough EC90-plasma level of 25.1 ng/ml are illustrated in Figure 1 (20mg/day),
Figure 2 (40mg/day), and Figure 3 (60mg/day) with a horizontal dashed line throughout the
pharmacokinetic dosing profile figures throughout the text and tables.

Figure 1 shows the concentration-time data for a fluoxetine dose of 20mg per day results in the
maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), geometric mean (geometric coefficient of variation,
CV%), is 65.8 ng/mL (CV=70.2%), median time at maximum concentration (Tmax) of 220hours (range, 49-220), area-under-the-concentration-time curve (AUC0 Last ), geometric mean
(geometric coefficient of variation, CV%), from baseline to 10-days is 10,200 ng•hour/ml, and a
half-life (t ½) – expressed as arithmetic mean (standard deviation, SD) – of 84.7 hours
(SD=181). These aforementioned pharmacokinetic results translate to 20% of the population
reaching the target concentration at the end of day-1 and 79% of the population achieving the
target trough EC90 concentration by end of day-10. Figure 2 shows at a dose of 40mg per day,
the Cmax is 132 ng/mL (CV=68%), Tmax of 220-hours (range, 49-220), AUC0 Last is 20,500
ng•hour/ml, and population t ½ is 81.4 (SD=113), which is interpreted as 55% of the population
achieving the EC90 trough target at day-1 and 95% by day-10. Moreover, Figure 3 shows in a
patient population treated with fluoxetine at 60mg daily, results in a Cmax of 191 ng/mL
(CV=71%), 220-hours (range, 49-232), AUC0 Last 29,700 ng•hour/ml, and t ½ of 85.4 (SD=209)
allowing 72% of the population reaching the target trough concentration threshold on day-1 and
97% by day-10 of fluoxetine treatment. Table 1 provides an overview of the pharmacokinetics
and pharmacodynamics with blood levels (ng/ml and μM) in plasma as well as calculated organ
concentrations (whole-blood, lung, brain, heart, liver, spleen, and kidney) as well as, the percent
of the population achieving trough EC90 target during a treatment period of 10-days.

According to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Events Reporting
System (FAERS) during the window period of 1982 to June 30, 2020, fluoxetine was reported to
have a total of 79,929 cases, 62,948 serious cases, and 10,043 end of life cases (United States
Food and Drug Administration, 2018). Females represented 58% of the adverse drug reactions
(ADRs), males represent 27% of the ADRs, and 15% of the ADRs did not specify a gender. The
most common adverse drug event reported for fluoxetine is Drug Interaction and amounts to
3,798 cases (4.75% of total). Given this information, drug interactions associated with fluoxetine
are due to inhibition of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, specifically CYP2C19 and CYP2D6
which may have interactions such as in patients taking tamoxifen in oncology – by inhibiting
conversion to the active endoxifen metabolite via CYP2D6 – or in cases of clopidogrel –
inhibiting the conversion to the active 2-oxo-clopidogrel metabolite – in cardiology. (Spina,
Trifirò & Caraci, 2012; Eugene, 2019; United States Food and Drug Administration, 2020).

Extrapolating from in vitro to in vivo concentrations are dependent on intracellular versus
extracellular concentrations, as well as methodology of quantifying either whole-blood versus
plasma concentrations in human pharmacokinetic studies. The EC50 and EC90 target
concentrations represent the extracellular fluoxetine concentrations in the SARS-Cov-2 cell
culture media. As COVID-19 is known to affect the brain during active infection and in postCOVID-19 states, adequate brain concentrations would be clinical importance in patients who
may experience depression. Bolo et al. reported fluoxetine brain concentrations, at steady-state,
using fluorine magnetic spectroscopy showed fluoxetine concentrations were 10-times higher in
the brain than in human plasma (Bolo et al., 2000). Specifically, Bolo et al. found in study
participants taking oral doses (10mg, n=1; 20 mg, n=1; 40 mg, n=2) with a treatment period
ranging from 3-months to 12-months, had fluoxetine human brain concentrations of 13 μM
(SD=7) versus 1.73 μM (SD=1.00) in human plasma fluoxetine (Bolo et al., 2000). In
comparison, Johnson et al. found the coefficients for tissue distribution of fluoxetine relative to
whole-blood was: 60 for lung, 20 for spleen, 15 for brain, 10 for heart, and 9 for kidneys
(Johnson, Lewis & Angier, 2007).
As patients recover the from the acute COVID-19 symptoms, long-term sequelae are being
documented as a term coined as: post-COVID-19 syndrome. In one of the post-SARS-Cov-2
infection studies in young patients, 92% were found to have ongoing cardiorespiratory symptoms
with organ dysfunction representing comprised of: 32% impairment of the heart, 33%
impairment of lungs, and 12% impairment of the kidneys (Dennis et al., 2020). In another postCOVID-19 syndrome study, 96% of the patients were female and experienced statistically
significant exercise intolerance, dyspnea, and chest pain when compared to those not diagnosed
with COVID-19 (Walsh-Messinger et al., 2020). Moreover, Walsh-Messinger et al. study found
patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome had higher ratings of depression subscale markers of

altered sleep and thinking, but depression severity was not significantly different with patients
not diagnosed with COVID-19 (Walsh-Messinger et al., 2020).
Direct clinical translation of this current pharmacokinetic study is corroborates with a
retrospective multicenter observational study, by Hoertel et al., who found a median fluoxetine
dose of 20mg resulted in a significantly lower risk of intubation and death in a population
composed of 63% women and 37% men (Hoertel et al., 2020). Moreover, Hoertel et al. found
17% of fluoxetine-treated patients had events of intubation and death appears consistent with the
current study due to as simulations are extended to 4-weeks at 20mg 82.9% of patients would
achieve the EC90 target and 17% would not achieve the EC90 concentration. Comparing the
Hoertel et al. and Zimniak et al. publications, Hoertel et al. found that in addition to fluoxetine,
venlafaxine (median dose of 75mg) and escitalopram (median dose of 10mg) were also
associated with a lower risk of intubation and death, however, Zimniak et al. showed neither
SSRIs escitalopram nor paroxetine inhibited SARS-Cov-2 in vitro (Hoertel et al., 2020; Zimniak
et al., 2020). Of note, as shown in Table 1, a 40mg or 60mg daily fluoxetine dose results in 90%
inhibition of the SARS-Cov-2 infection due to surpassing the EC90 value of 4.02 μM as found in
Calu-3 cells and the EC90 value of 1.81 μM in Vero E6 cells (Schloer et al., 2020).
Antiviral properties of fluoxetine are well reported in the literature. A study by Carpinteiro et al.
reported fluoxetine inhibits acid sphingomyelinase preventing infection of both cultured cells
and human nasal epithelial cells in SARS-Cov-2 as well as in vesicular stomatitis virus
pseudoviral particles presenting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Carpinteiro et al., 2020). A
study by Zuo et al. showed fluoxetine resulted in potent inhibition of the coxsackievirus by
reducing both synthesis of viral RNA and protein with an EC50 of 2.3 μM and peak antiviral
properties at 6.25 μM (Zuo et al., 2012). A study by Bauer et al. showed, in a broad-spectrum
manner, fluoxetine inhibited enterovirus – the picornaviridae family – replication with the (S)fluoxetine enantiomer exhibiting a 5-fold lower EC50 than the racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)fluoxetine (Bauer et al., 2019). Further, Bauer et al. found the following EC50 values:
coxsackievirus B3 (racemate-EC50=2.02 μM, (S)-fluoxetine-EC50=0.42 μM), enterovirus EVD68 (racemate-EC50=1.85 μM, (S)-fluoxetine-EC50=0.67 μM), and (S)-fluoxetine values alone
for rhinovirus HRV-A2 (EC50=7.95 μM) and HRV-B14 (EC50=6.34 μM) (Bauer et al., 2019).
Notably, Zimniak et al. found that individual stereoisomers, (R)-fluoxetine and (S)-fluoxetine,
inhibited the SARS-Cov-2 viral load; however, in contrast, fluoxetine could not inhibit gene
expression of the herpes simplex-1 virus, human herpes virus-8, rabies virus, nor the respiratory
syncytial virus (Zimniak et al., 2020). Lastly, of these aforementioned antiviral median effective
concentrations, standard fluoxetine doses achieve the concentrations in the lungs, brain, and
heart, except for the rhinovirus EC50 for the heart tissue but which will be reached in the brain
and lungs, as shown in Table 1.

A limitation of this study is associated with the previously validated fluoxetine pharmacometric
model being in women and did not include men (Tanoshima et al., 2014). However, as shown
from the aforementioned FDA Adverse Events Reporting System data, women represented 58%
of all ADR cases overall from the reporting period of 1982 to 2020. Overall, from a drug-safety
perspective, prior to administering fluoxetine, a careful review of all patient medications and
clinical status by clinical pharmacologist-physicians would be recommended to avoid drug
interactions due to fluoxetine’s ability to strongly inhibit CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 (Hefner,
2018). Compounds that are sensitive and moderate CYP2C19 (e.g. omeprazole
diazepam, lansoprazole, rabeprazole, voriconazole) and CYP2D6 substrates (e.g.
dextromethorphan, eliglustat, nebivolol, tolterodine, encainide, metoprolol, propranolol,
tramadol) will have an increase total area-under-the-concentration-time curve of ≥ 5-fold drug
exposure when treated with fluoxetine (United States Food and Drug Administration, 2020).
Lastly, patients who have a pharmacogenomic profile of being a CYP2D6 Poor Metabolizer or
Intermediate Metabolizers should be closely monitored for potential fluoxetine side-effects, but
may also have a higher rate of achieving the target trough EC90 concentration at a 20mg daily
fluoxetine dose relative to CYP2D6 Normal (Extensive) Metabolizers.

Investigating fluoxetine pharmacokinetics, this study confirmed that previously published
median effective concentrations and specifically the EC90 fluoxetine value inhibiting SARSCov-2 in Calu-3 human lung cells is achievable using standard fluoxetine doses (20mg/day,
40mg/day, and 60mg/day) and also corroborates findings from a retrospective clinical study
showing fluoxetine exposure associated with reduced risk of intubation and death. Due to the
high fluoxetine brain (15-times higher) and lung (60-times higher) tissue distributions, relative to
whole-blood and plasma concentrations (6% lower than whole blood), treatment with fluoxetine
may serve as pragmatic therapeutic option in patients with lingering post-COVID-19 syndrome
neurocognitive effects or in primary management of COVID-19. Overall, assuming patients are
not treated with medications that result in drug interactions with fluoxetine – that is are sensitive
or moderate CYP2D6 metabolic substrates – a dose of 40mg per day of fluoxetine will likely be
most effective with inhibiting SARS-Cov-2 titers. That 40mg daily fluoxetine dose will lead to
55% of the population achieving the trough EC90 target at day-1, 93% by day-7, and 95% of
patients achieving the trough target EC90 concentration within 10-days of fluoxetine.

EC90: effective concentration inhibiting 90% of SARS-Cov-2 from Calu-3 lung cells reported as 4.02 uM
(Schloer et al., 2020). Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) are expressed as geometric mean (geometric
coefficient of variation, CV%). Fluoxetine tissue distribution coefficients (60 for lung, 20 for spleen, 15 for brain,
10 for heart, and 9 for kidneys) were scaled from whole-blood, then plasma, and then to organs as reported
(Johnson, Lewis & Angier, 2007).
