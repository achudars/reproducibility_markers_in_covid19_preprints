SARS-CoV-2 RNA in COVID-19 PBMC

Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third virus
that caused coronavirus-related outbreaks over the past 20 years. The outbreak was first
reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, but rapidly progressed into a pandemic of an
unprecedented scale since the 1918 flu pandemic. Besides respiratory complications in
COVID-19 patients, clinical characterizations of severe infection cases showed several other
comorbidities, including multiple organ failure (liver, kidney, and heart) and septic shock. To
better understand COVID-19 pathogenesis in different human organs, we interrogated the
presence of the virus in the blood, or any of its components, which might provide a form of
trafficking or hiding to the virus. By computationally analyzing high-throughput sequence data
from patients with active COVID-19 infection, we found evidence of only traces of SARS-CoV-2
RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), while the virus RNA was abundant in
bronchoalveolar lavage specimens from the same patients. We also devised a ‘viral
spike-to-actin’ RNA normalization, as a metric to compare across various samples and minimize
errors caused by intersample variability in human RNA. To the best of our knowledge, the
presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the PBMC of COVID-19 patients has not been reported
before, and this observation could suggest immune presentation, but discounts the possibility of
extensive viral infection of lymphocytes or monocytes.

Introduction
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the third virus
that caused coronavirus-related outbreaks over the past 20 years. The first outbreak occurred in
Asia in 2002-2003 causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), hence, the name,
SARS-CoV, which back then was not related to any of the known viruses ​(Marra et al. 2003;
Rota et al. 2003)​. Between 2002 and 2003, 8,098 people became sick with SARS, and of those
774 died (i.e., a mortality rate of 9.5%). Since 2004, there have been no more reports of SARS
cases (via ​NHS​, ​WHO​, and ​CDC​).
The second coronavirus-related outbreak started in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 ​(Zaki
et al. 2012)​ causing a more fatal disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), with a

SARS-CoV-2 RNA in COVID-19 PBMC
significantly higher mortality rate of 40% of the cases infected by MERS-CoV virus ​(Zumla, Hui,
and Perlman 2015)​.
More recently, in December 2019, the third coronavirus-related outbreak was first
reported in Wuhan, China, by the emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), initially dubbed “​the 2019 novel coronavirus” (2019-nCoV).
The spread of the virus led to a pandemic of an unprecedented scale since the 1918 flu
pandemic.
As of May 30, nearly 6 million confirmed COVID-19 cases globally and > 350,000 deaths
have been reported by WHO (​WHO Dashboard​, continuously updated). Besides the respiratory
complications in COVID-19 patients, clinical characterizations of severe infection cases
indicated further comorbidities, including multiple organ failure (liver, kidney, and heart) and
septic shock ​(Poston, Patel, and Davis 2020; Cascella et al. 2020; Hui Li et al. 2020)​.
The genome sequence of SARS-COV-2 has been determined and made public ​(Lu et al.
2020)​, and since then thousands (over 35,000) of genomes have been sequenced from all
around the world ​(Shu and McCauley 2017)​https://www.gisaid.org​(Shu and McCauley 2017)​.
The availability of those genomic sequences allows the rapid screening of viral RNA in human
tissues as well as environmental samples (e.g., sewage ​(Bibby and Peccia 2013)​) using
multi-omic wet lab technologies, and ​in silico​ screening tools, for publicly available
metatranscriptomic samples.
To better understand COVID-19 pathogenesis in different human organs, we conducted
this study to interrogate the presence of the virus in the blood, or any of its components, as it
might provide a form of trafficking or hiding to the virus, notably that some precarious studies
reported the ability of the virus to infect lymphocytes ​(X. Wang et al. 2020)​ whereas others
suggested the virus exerts its pathogenesis through “attacking hemoglobin,” although this
hypothesis has been heavily criticized ​(Read 2020)​. The virus was reported to be found in the
plasma of COVID-19 patients ​(Huang et al. 2020)​. Finally, peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC) were shown to harbor other infectious viruses, such as HIV, HCV, and HBV ​(W.-K.
Wang et al. 2002; Z. Li, Hou, and Cao 2015)​.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA in COVID-19 PBMC
For the aforementioned reasons, we computationally analyzed high-throughput
sequence data from patients with active COVID-19 infection, and found evidence of traces of
SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their PMBCs, while their bronchoalveolar lavage samples had large
amounts of the viral RNA.

Methods
Dataset
Publicly accessible raw RNA-Seq FASTQ sequences published by Xiong et al. ​(Xiong et
al. 2020)​ were obtained from the Genome Sequence Archive ​(Y. Wang et al. 2017)​ (GSA
accession ​CRA002390​). Raw sequences were processed for quality control using fastp ​(Chen
et al. 2018)​.

Comparison of RNA Abundance and Gene Expression Profiles
Filtered FASTQ sequences were searched with blastx ​(Altschul et al. 1990)​ against the
RefSeq protein database ​(O’Leary et al. 2016)​ (release 99) using DIAMOND ​(Buchfink, Xie, and
Huson 2015)​ with an ​e​-value cutoff < 1e-10. The counts of the matching RefSeq accessions
were normalized to the total number of reads per library. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
was performed on the normalized abundance of the RefSeq proteins. For functional annotation,
the matching RefSeq proteins were annotated by Pfam ​(Finn et al. 2014)​ using HMMER ​(Eddy
2011)​.

Detection of Viral RNA
Filtered FASTQ sequences were aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome
(GenBank accession ​NC_045512​) using the Burrows-Wheeler aligner (BWA, ​(Heng Li and
Durbin 2009)​). Generated binary alignment map (BAM) files were filtered for mapped
sequences with a quality score > 40 and alignment score > 90 using Sambamba ​(Tarasov et al.
2015)​. Identified SARS-CoV-2 matching sequences were manually inspected and searched
against NCBI “nt” by BLAST (blastn) for verification ​(Altschul et al. 1990)​.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA in COVID-19 PBMC

Data normalization
To estimate viral RNA abundance in a given sample, we normalized any positive hits to
SARS-CoV-2 to the total number of reads within that sample. Additionally, we used the spike
gene, being a highly specific SARS-CoV-2 gene to estimate the extent of viral RNA load in a
given sample, and we normalized the abundance of spike genes to human actin RNA, being a
transcript of a housekeeping gene. This normalization generated a ‘spike-to-actin’ ratio that
could be used as an accurate metric for viral RNA abundance relative to human RNA.

Results
We analyzed the RNA-Seq dataset published by Xiong et al. ​(Xiong et al. 2020)​. ​Table
S1​ describes the processed samples, and the sequence reads statistics of each sample:
Based on the global gene expression in PBMC, PCA showed a strong, expected
separation between BALF and PBMC samples, and further slight separation in the PBMC from
healthy controls and COVID-19 patients (​Figure 1​). However, one healthy control was placed
within the COVID-19 cluster.
We found viral sequences in all the BALF samples with a median of abundance 2.15%
of the total reads (​Table S1​). We also identified 2 paired-ended viral reads in a PBMC sample of
a COVID-19 patient, matching the SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein (pp1ab) (accession ​NP_828849​)
and SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein (accession ​YP_009724390​) (​Figures 2, 3​).
When we calculated a spike-to-actin RNA ratio for each sample, values for all four BALF
samples, as well as the one PBMC sample with SARS-CoV-2 transcripts, followed the same
pattern of viral RNA abundance values, and strongly correlated (Spearman correlation ​p = ​0.96,
p-​ value = 0.00047, ​Figure 4C​)

SARS-CoV-2 RNA in COVID-19 PBMC

Discussion
Coronavirus-related infections have been reported to be associated with hematological
changes including lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia through infecting blood
cells, bone marrow stromal cells, or inducing autoantibodies ​(Yang et al. 2003)​.
In a former study characterizing the clinical features of COVID-19 patients, Huang and
coworkers showed that using RT-PCR allowed them to detect coronavirus in plasma isolated
samples from the patients ​(Huang et al. 2020)​. In their report, they preferred to use the term
“RNAaemia,” rather than “viraemia,” which they defined as the presence of a virus in the blood
because they did not perform tests to confirm the presence of an infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus
in the blood of the patients.
There have been no reports of detecting viral RNA in blood cells, notably PBMC. In their
preliminary analysis of RNA isolated from PBMC, ​Corley et al​ confirmed that they did not detect
viral sequences (a preprint ​10.1101/2020.04.13.039263v1​).
Using high-throughput sequencing has been repeatedly demonstrated to be an effective
approach for the identification and quantification of viruses in the blood ​(Moustafa et al. 2017)
following similar methods as those used in viral metagenomics ​(Breitbart et al. 2003)​;​(Aziz et al.
2015)​) and uncultivated viral genomics (​(Roux et al. 2019)​.
Therefore, we planned to exhaustively look for SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences in publicly
available RNA-Seq PBMC datasets. As of the writing of this report, there has been only one
publicly available RNA-Seq PBMC dataset published by ​(Xiong et al. 2020)​, in which the group
profiled global gene expression in BALF and PBMC specimens of COVID-19. Predictably, we
detected viral RNA in all BALF samples (2 patients, 2 replicates each) with an average
abundance of 2.15% of the total RNA in those samples, which included human RNA (​Table S1
and Figure 4)​.
Of note, to estimate the viral RNA load in a given sample and to compare between
different samples, we normalized viral read counts to the total number of reads in each data set.
Since the total number of human-related reads may be strongly affected by potential microbial
RNA (from pulmonary microbiota, for example) or by extensive viral counts, we also sought to

SARS-CoV-2 RNA in COVID-19 PBMC
estimate the ratio of viral genomic RNA to human cellular RNA. For that purpose, we used actin
RNA, being a transcript for a human housekeeping gene—not expected to be seen in bacterial
cells or viral genomes, and we estimated the ratio of hits to RNA encoding the spike protein (S)
copies to actin transcripts in the sample. Quite interestingly, the spike-to-actin ratio strongly
correlated with viral RNA abundance values (computed as SARS-CoV-2 RNA reads normalized
to the total number of reads), ​Figure 4C​.
As for blood samples, we identified two paired-end reads in RNA isolated from PBMC
from only one (accession ​CRR119891​) out of three patients, which aligned to the SARS-CoV-2
genome. Expectedly, no SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the PBMC from healthy controls
(three donors).
These RNA traces are certainly quite rare; however, they confidently and specifically
belong to SARS-COV-2 (​Figure 3​). One viral RNA read translates into polyprotein (pp1ab,
accession ​NP_828849​), which is the largest protein of coronaviruses and involved in the
replication and transcription of the viral genome. The other viral RNA translates into surface
(spike) glycoprotein (accession ​YP_009724390​), which mediates the entry of the viral into the
human cells expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) ​(Ou et al. 2020;
Walls et al. 2020)​. Although we are not rejecting the possibility of cross-contamination or
barcode bleeding ​(Mitra et al. 2015; Kircher, Sawyer, and Meyer 2012)​ for detecting the viral
RNA in one PBMC RNA-Seq sample, such possibility is unlikely, given that control samples had
zero hits to SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We are also considering the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 being
sampled by antigen-presenting cells (most likely dendritic cells) or presented to T lymphocytes,
which are in the PBMC population.
One more possibility, which we believe needs many more samples to consider, is that
SARS-CoV-2 may be specifically or coincidentally internalized by one of the mononuclear cell
types, which may suggest a mechanism for the chronicity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. This
hypothesis requires further testing. However, in the light of our data, it is hard to support the
early reports that SARS-COV-2 targets T-lymphocytes ​in vivo,​ as suggested earlier, in a
correspondence, based on cell culture experiment with pseudotyped viruses ​(X. Wang et al.
2020)​.

With more data becoming publicly available, it will be possible to revisit this hypothesis
and others to improve our understanding of the progression and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in
infected individuals.
