Abstract
Background: Men and older women have been shown to be at higher risk of adverse
COVID-19 outcomes. Animal model studies of SARS-CoV and MERS suggest that the age
and sex difference in COVID-19 symptom severity may be due to a protective effect of the
female sex hormone estrogen. Females have shown an ability to mount a stronger immune
response to a variety of viral infections because of more robust humoral and cellular immune
responses.
Objectives: We sought to determine whether COVID-19 positivity increases in women
entering menopause. We also aimed to identify whether premenopausal women taking
exogenous hormones in the form of the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) and postmenopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have lower predicted rates
of COVID-19, using our published symptom-based model.
Design: The COVID Symptom Study developed by King’s College London and Zoe Global
Limited was launched in the UK on 24th March 2020. It captured self-reported information
related to COVID-19 symptoms. Data used for this study included records collected between
7th May - 15th June 2020.
Main outcome measures: We investigated links between COVID-19 rates and 1)
menopausal status, 2) COCP use and 3) HRT use, using symptom-based predicted COVID19, tested COVID-19, and disease severity based on requirement for hospital attendance or
respiratory support.
Participants: Female users of the COVID Symptom Tracker Application in the UK, including
152,637 women for menopause status, 295,689 for COCP use, and 151,193 for HRT use.
Analyses were adjusted for age, smoking and BMI.
Results: Post-menopausal women aged 40-60 years had a higher rate of predicted COVID
(P=0.003) and a corresponding range of symptoms, with consistent, but not significant
trends observed for tested COVID-19 and disease severity. Women aged 18-45 years taking
COCP had a significantly lower predicted COVID-19 (P=8.03E-05), with a reduction in
hospital attendance (P=0.023). Post-menopausal women using HRT or hormonal therapies
did not exhibit consistent associations, including increased rates of predicted COVID-19
(P=2.22E-05) for HRT users alone.
Conclusions: Our findings support a protective effect of estrogen on COVID-19, based on
positive association between predicted COVID-19 and menopausal status, and a negative
association with COCP use. HRT use was positively associated with COVID-19 symptoms;
however, the results should be considered with caution due to lack of data on HRT type,
route of administration, duration of treatment, and potential comorbidities.
Trial registration: The App Ethics has been approved by KCL ethics Committee REMAS ID

Introduction
As the COVID-19 pandemic progresses, it has been widely observed that adult men of all
ages are at higher risk of developing serious complications. A recent review of biological sex
and COVID-19 has described the male bias in COVID-19 mortality in 37 of the 38 countries
that have provided sex-disaggregated data (1). Of women who develop COVID-19, being
post-menopausal has been independently associated with more severe COVID-19 (2).
Epidemiological data from previous coronavirus outbreaks, including SARS-CoV (Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus)
and MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus) showed the same
pattern: among men, morbidity and fatality rates were markedly higher compared to women
(3, 4). When patients aged 70 years or older were examined, the effect of lower morbidity
and mortality disappeared among SARS-CoV-2 infected women (5). It has also been noted
that pregnant women experience milder COVID-19 than initially expected (6).

Animal model studies of SARS-CoV and MERS suggest that the age and sex difference in
COVID-19 symptom severity may be due to protective and acute actions of the female sex
hormone estrogen (7). Females have been shown to be able to mount a stronger immune
response to a variety of viral infections because of more robust humoral and cellular immune
responses (8-10). Anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) and estradiol are markers of high ovarian
reserve and have been shown to negatively correlate with severity of COVID-19,
independent of age, suggesting that pre-menopausal women are somewhat protected
against more severe COVID-19 (11). A phase II study testing whether short-course estradiol
delivered via transdermal patch will be safe and reduce symptom severity in COVID-19
affected adult men and older women is underway in New York (NCT04359329), with another
study investigating oral progesterone in men hospitalised with COVID-19 in California
(NCT04365127).

The potential protective effect of estrogen against COVID-19 requires continued and careful
evaluation. Here, we investigate whether higher levels of estrogen are linked to a reduction
in the rate and severity of COVID-19 among women, based on large-scale self-reported data
from the UK. The primary analysis explores if women who have recently gone through
menopause are at higher risk of symptomatic COVID-19, compared to women who still
report periods over age 40. Follow-up analyses consider exogenous estrogen, exploring if
women taking the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) have a reduced risk of being
COVID-19-positive, with associated symptoms. We also assess if use of HRT is associated
with a reduced rate of COVID-19 positivity and severity in post-menopausal women alone.
Materials and Methods
The COVID Symptom Study Smartphone Application (“app”) was developed by Zoe Global
Limited with scientific input from researchers and clinicians at King’s College London and
Massachusetts General Hospital. It was launched in the UK on 24th March 2020. It captures
self-reported information related to COVID-19 symptoms. On first use, the app records selfreported location, age, and core health risk factors. At this point height and weight are selfreported, allowing calculation of body mass index (BMI). With continued use, participants
provide daily updates on symptoms, information on health care visits, COVID-19 testing
results, and whether they are self-quarantining or seeking healthcare, including the level of
intervention and related outcomes. Individuals without apparent symptoms are also
encouraged to use the app.

On 7 May 2020 we asked all female app-users if they are presently taking any forms of
hormonal therapies including hormone replacement therapy (HRT), hormonal contraceptives
and testosterone (S1 Fig). We also posed questions relating to menstruation and current
pregnancy. Patients who indicated they were still having periods were asked about
frequency of menstruation. Those who indicated not having periods were asked their age at
menopause. The COVID Symptom Study dataset used for this study was obtained from the
period of 7 May - 15 June 2020, yielding 40 days of data collection from a total of 1.9M
women in the UK. From these, 1.6M women had BMI between 20-35kg/m2 and were
included in downstream analyses.
Ascertainment of exposures, disease outcomes and study covariates
Exposures, outcomes and covariates were ascertained from self-reported app data following
quality control with purpose-built scripts (https://github.com/KCL-BMEIS/zoe-data-prep).
Exposures used in our analyses included women’s menopausal status, and COCP and HRT
use. Primary disease outcomes included COVID-19-related symptoms (S1 Table) and
predicted COVID-19 positivity based on symptoms, as described in our recent publication
(12). Hospitalisation and respiratory support, defined as supplementary oxygen (+/ventilation) were used as surrogate markers for disease severity. Self-reported results from
nose/throat swab tests were also used as outcome for a subset of the sample who were
tested for COVID-19. Reported age, BMI and smoking status were used as covariates in the
associations, and the analyses only included female app users.
Analyses of menopausal status included post- and pre-menopausal women aged 40-60
years, with BMI 20–35 kg/m2, excluding women taking any form of hormonal therapy. We
compared post-menopausal women currently reporting no periods and with last period
reported after the age of 40 and within 5 years, to pre-menopausal women with regular
periods occurring every 3–6 weeks. Analyses of COCP use included post- and premenopausal women aged 20-45 years, with BMI 20–35kg/m2. We compared women taking
COCP as their only form of hormonal therapy, to women of the same age taking no form of
hormone therapy. Analyses of HRT use were carried out in post-menopausal women aged
50-65 years, with BMI 20–35kg/m2 and last periods reported at age 45–60. We compared
women on HRT alone to women receiving no form of hormonal therapy. Extended hormone
therapy analyses also considered women who were on HRT or related hormone therapies,
including COCP, progestogen therapy, progestogen containing intrauterine systems, or
testosterone (S1 Table). Use of estrogen for gender transitioning was excluded from the
analyses.
Association analyses
Binomial generalized mixed models with a log-odds/logit link function were used to carry out
association analyses. The models included COVID-19 symptom or outcome as a function of
exposure variables and covariates including age, BMI, and smoking status. Exposures
included menopausal status, COCP use, and HRT use. Exposure data and symptoms of the
disease were coded as ‘1’ for positive (TRUE/yes/severe/significant) responses and ‘0’ for
negative (FALSE/no/mild) responses or blank (NA) statements from app users. In predicted
COVID-19 analyses subjects with a predicted COVID-19 probability ≥ 50% were considered
COVID-19-positive (coded ‘1’, while a predicted COVID-19-negative outcome was coded as
‘0’). App users in hospital or home from hospital were coded as ‘1’ for hospitalisation. App
users who reported going to the hospital and requiring supplementary oxygen (+/ventilation) were coded as ‘1’ for respiratory support, while all others were coded as ‘0’ for
this outcome. App users with at least one positive swab test for COVID-19 were considered
COVID-19-positive in the tested COVID-19-positive analyses (coded as ‘1’, while a tested
COVID-19-negative outcome was coded as ‘0’). Only a small subset of women was tested
for COVID-19, and missing data, failed tests, or tests awaiting outcome were excluded from
analyses. Age and BMI were coded as continuous fixed effects. Only women with BMI 20–
35kg/m2 were considered in our study. Smoking was coded as a categorical fixed effect

variable with levels ‘1’, ‘2’ and ‘3’ respectively representing never-smokers, ex-smokers and
current smokers. Odds ratios of the associations are reported.
Sensitivity analyses
Age is a key risk factor for COVID-19. Age sensitivity analyses were performed to match the
mean and median ages of cases and controls for each of the three exposure variables.
Analyses were carried out in subsets of app users within 5-year bins for menopausal status
and use of COCP and HRT. In menopause, sensitivity analysis was also performed for years
passed since time of last period.
TwinsUK cohort data analysis
At the time of data freeze, a subset of app users included research volunteers from the
TwinsUK cohort (13). Here, we considered 270 TwinsUK female twins (mean age 66), who
also had existing whole blood DNA methylation data profiled using the Illumina Infinium
HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. From the 270 female twins, a subset of 84 participants
had previously collected TwinsUK questionnaire data on menopausal status, and a further
subset of 75 had information on age at last period.
Whole blood DNA extraction and DNA methylation profiling in these samples have been
previously described (14). Briefly, DNA methylation levels were determined using Illumina
methylation beta-values (15), which range between 0 at unmethylated CpG-sites, and 1 at
fully methylated CpG sites. ENmix (16) was used for quality control and minfi (17) was used
to exclude samples with median methylated and unmethylated signals below 10.5. Three
different epigenetic age calculators were applied to estimate DNA methylation age for each
individual, DNAm GrimAge (18), DNAm PhenoAge (19) and the original Horvath methylation
age (20). Epigenetic age acceleration measures included estimates obtained from
regressing epigenetic age on chronological age. We also considered intrinsic epigenetic age
acceleration (IEAA) and extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (EEAA) (21). IEAA is
calculated by regressing the Horvath DNA methylation age and cell blood counts to create
an estimate of cell intrinsic methylation ageing, independent of differences in blood cell
counts. EEAA is calculated based on epigenetic ageing measures developed by Hannum et
al. (22), up-weighted by the relative proportion of three age-related blood immune cells,
specifically naïve (CD45RA+CCR7+) cytotoxic T cells, exhausted (CD28-CD45RA-)
cytotoxic T cells, and plasmablasts, as previously described (21). EEAA has been proposed
to capture aspects of age-related immuno-senescence (21). A one-sided t-test was applied
to compare each of the five age acceleration measures to symptoms and predicted COVID19 status, and results are presented at nominal significance.

Results
The COVID Symptom Study dataset used for this study was collected between 7 May - 15
June 2020 and included 1.6M women in the UK (BMI range 20–35kg/m2), with all analyses
adjusted for age, BMI and smoking status.

Menopause
We examined the impact of entering menopause on COVID-19-positivity and related
symptoms among 152,637 women aged 40–60 years with BMI 20-35 kg/m2. Cases were
defined as post-menopausal women currently reporting no periods and with last period
reported after the age of 40 and within the last 5 years, resulting in altogether 44,268 women
(S1 Table). Controls were defined as pre-menopausal women with regular periods occurring
every 3–6 weeks, resulting in altogether 108,369 controls. Women taking any form of
hormonal therapy were excluded from this analysis.

Post-menopausal women had a higher rate of predicted COVID-19 (OR = 1.22, 95% CI
1.07–1.39, p = 0.003) and a corresponding range of significant differences in symptoms
including hoarse voice, skipped meals, muscle pains, and fever (Table 1). Requirement for
hospitalisation and respiratory support were not significant, but also showed a positive
direction of association in post-menopausal women. Although there was no significant
association between menopausal status and testing COVID-19-positive, the direction of
association is consistent with predicted COVID-19 results (Table 1).

SE: standard error; OR: odds ratio; 95% CI (LL; UL): upper and lower limits for the 95%
confidence interval of the odds ratio.
The mean age of post-menopausal and pre-menopausal women included in the analysis
above was 53.8 and 45.2 years, respectively. Because of this difference, sensitivity analyses
were performed for age within 5-year age bins (40–45, 45–50, 50–55 and 55–60 years old).
Upon subgroup analysis by age, we observed that predicted COVID-19 results were most
driven by the 45–50 age group (OR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.05–1.72, p = 0.017), wherein anosmia,
as well as fever and persistent cough, and the need for oxygen treatment in hospital were
also significant (S2 Table). A sensitivity analysis was also carried for last period within 3
years at time of reporting. Sensitivity analysis for last menstrual period within 3 years from
questionnaire showed similar significant results for higher rate of predicted COVID-19 in
post-menopausal women (OR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.01–1.36, p = 0.036).

Use of Combined Oral Contraceptive Pill
We examined the link between COCP use and COVID-19-positivity and related outcomes in
295,689 women aged 18–45 years (BMI 20-35). Both pre- and post-menopausal women
were considered for this analysis, where most participants (85%) were pre-menopausal.
Cases were defined as females on the COCP as their only form of hormonal therapy,
resulting in 64,253 COCP-users (S1 Table). Controls were women of the same age and BMI
group taking no form of hormone therapy, resulting in 231,436 controls (S1 Table).
Women using COCP had a lower rate of predicted COVID-19 (OR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.81–
0.93, p = 8.03E-05) and a corresponding reduced frequency of symptoms, including
persistent cough, delirium, anosmia, skipped meals, severe fatigue and pain (p < 0.001)
(Table 2). Rate of hospitalisation was also significantly lower in COCP users (OR = 0.79,
95% CI 0.64–0.97, p = 0.023). The association between COCP use and tested COVID-19 as
outcome was not significant but showed a consistent negative direction of association in the
25–30 and 35–40 age groups (S2 Table). Analyses in the subset of 251,786 premenopausal women alone, including 52,453 COCP-users and 199,333 controls, showed
consistent strong negative associations with predicted COVID-19 (OR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.80–
0.95, p = 8.38E-04) and a corresponding reduced frequency of a wide range of symptoms
(S2 Table).

^: in a subset of Covid-19-tested individuals (n = 26,871).
SE: standard error; OR: odds ratio; 95% CI (LL; UL): upper and lower limits for the 95%
confidence interval of the odds ratio.
The mean ages of COCP users and controls were 29.5 and 34.2 years, respectively.
Sensitivity analyses were performed for age, in 5-year bins (18–25, 25–30, 30–35, 35–40
and 40–45-year-olds). Sensitivity analyses showed strongest results for the 25–30 year age
group, with COCP-users having lower predicted COVID-19-positivity (OR = 0.77, 95% CI
0.67–0.90, p = 0.0008) and avoiding hospitalisation (OR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.31–0.80, p = 0.004)
(S2 Table). Negative association with predicted COVID-19 was also significant in the 40–45year-olds (OR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.63–0.94, p = 0.01). Associations in the 18–25-year-olds
yielded only two statistically significant symptom associations, suggesting that this age
group contributed the least to the results observed in the main analysis.

Use of Hormone Replacement Therapy
The association between HRT use and COVID-19 was assessed in 151,193 postmenopausal women aged 50-65 years, with BMI 20–35 and last periods reported at age 45–
60. Controls were post-menopausal women matching these criteria who received no form of
hormonal therapy, resulting in 133,395 controls (S1 Table). Cases were defined as 17,798
women on HRT only. Extended analyses also considered women on HRT or additional
related hormone therapies, excluding use of estrogen in gender transitioning (S1 Table).
HRT use was associated with an increased rate of predicted COVID-19 (OR = 1.32, 95% CI
= 1.16 – 1.49, p = 2.22E-05) and frequency of a wide range of symptoms (S3 Table).
However, while predicted COVID-19 and reporting of symptoms showed positive
associations in HRT users, there was no significantly increased rate of hospitalisation in
HRT-users. Notably, both the need for respiratory support and testing positive for COVID-19

showed a negative trend of association with HRT use, although the results were not
nominally significant. The results remained consistent in extended analyses considering use
of HRT or other related hormone therapies (S3 Table).
The mean ages of HRT users ranged between 56.6 – 56.8 years, while the mean age of
controls was 58.2 years. Sensitivity analyses were performed for age, selecting for
subgroups of women aged 50–55, 55–60 and 60–65 years. Sensitivity analyses of age were
consistent with the overall predicted COVID-19 and symptoms results and showed negative
directions of association for testing COVID-19-positive, most consistent in 55–60-year-olds
(S2 Table), which yielded more COVID-19 tests than the 50–55 and 60–65-year-old
subgroups (S1 Table).

App data validation in TwinsUK questionnaires
A subset of app users included 270 female research volunteers from the TwinsUK cohort
(13). Of these, 84 had previously reported questionnaire data on menopausal status. For all
84 women menopausal status in the app response matched the TwinsUK questionnaire
data, where women reported that periods had either stopped or that they did not currently
have periods. Furthermore, a subset of 75 female twins had reported information on age of
last period in TwinsUK questionnaires. Of these, 64% of twins (48 twins) matched age of last
period reported from TwinsUK data within 1 year to age at last period reported in the app,
and 87% (65) matched within a 3-year range.

Menopause, biological aging, and COVID-19 symptoms
Menopause is a marker of ageing and has previously been linked to accelerated epigenetic
ageing (23). To this end, we compared the frequency of COVID-19 symptoms in 270
TwinsUK female twins (S4 Table) with available app data to 5 estimates of epigenetic
ageing in whole blood, including the original epigenetic age acceleration, GrimAge
acceleration, PhenoAge acceleration, blood cell intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (IEAA),
and blood extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (EEAA).
Overall, fatigue and unusual muscle pains showed the most (3 or more) nominally significant
associations with epigenetic age acceleration measures; followed by hoarse voice, skipped
meals and anosmia where significant differences were observed for two age acceleration
measures; and fever where a significant difference was observed with GrimAge Acceleration
alone (p = 0.01) (S5 Table). However, the results should be interpreted with caution as
sample sizes for subgroup analyses are modest, and in some cases extremely small.
Similarly, the number of individuals with predicted COVID-19 was extremely small (3
predicted cases), but these individuals as a group had on average accelerated epigenetic
age acceleration across all five epigenetic ageing measures (S5 Table).

Discussion
Sex is a biological variable that affects immune responses to both self and foreign antigens.
The sex of an individual is a multidimensional biological characteristic that shapes infectious
disease pathogenesis and is defined by the differential organisation of chromosomes,
reproductive organs, and sex steroid levels. Sex is distinct from gender, which includes
behaviours and activities that are determined by society or culture in humans. Human
biological sex plays a fundamental role in heterogeneous COVID-19 outcomes, with a strong
male predominance in mortality. Although gender-related social factors, including smoking,
health care-seeking behaviours and some medical comorbidities may impact the outcomes
of COVID-19 (24, 25) and contribute to sex-based differences in severity, the cross-cultural

emergence of significantly increased risk of mortality for males points to biological risk
determinants.
Teasing out the precise drivers of mortality in COVID-19, regardless of sex, is a difficult task.
The innate recognition and response to viruses as well as downstream adaptive immune
responses during viral infections are known to differ between females and males (26). It has
been well-illustrated that females generally mount greater inflammatory, antiviral, and
humoral immune responses than males during viral infections (27), which contributes to
better clearance of viruses, including SARS-CoV (7). This heightened inflammatory
response is advantageous in response to infection and sepsis, but is unfavourable in
immune responses against self, leading to an overall increased rate of autoimmune
diseases in women compared to men (28, 29). Additionally, enhanced immunity in females
can also result in greater immuno-pathology and tissue damage at later stages of viral
disease, such as during influenza A virus infection (30). Conversely, maternal physiological
adaptations to pregnancy usually predispose pregnant women to a more severe course of
many infections, including viral pneumonia, with subsequent higher maternal and fetal
morbidity and mortality (31), but observational cohort studies in COVID-19 have reported the
risk of severe disease in the pregnant population was approximately half that in the general
population of patients presenting with this disease (6). Estrogen levels increase more than
100-fold in pregnancy (32) providing a potential mechanism for the unique resistance to
COVID-19 compared with previous pandemic such as H1N1.
With ageing, a general decline in immune function is observed – immune-senescence.
Several of these changes are gender specific and affect postmenopausal women.
Menopause is a normal part of a woman’s lifecycle and consists of a series of body changes
that can last from one to ten years. Levels of estrogen, for example, 17β-estradiol (E2), are
variable during the menstrual cycle, high during pregnancy and low after menopause in
females. E2 affects many components of innate immunity, including the functional activity of
innate immune cells that influence downstream adaptive immune responses (26). Loss of
sex hormones due to ageing results in a reduction of immune function. For example, in
postmenopausal women, a second peak in Human papilloma virus (HPV) prevalence has
been reported (33, 34). New HPV infections in older women with no sexual activity are
thought to be due to reduced immune responses (35). HIV-1 infection is also increasing in
postmenopausal women (36), where a European study found that women over 45 have a 4fold increased risk of acquiring HIV compared to women under 45 years of age (37).
As we hypothesised, our results show that being pre-menopausal appears to have a
protective effect against COVID-19 in a large community survey of female UK app-users.
This was supported by a protective effect seen amongst pre-menopausal women taking the
COCP but was not seen for post-menopausal women taking HRT. However, HRT results
should be considered with caution due to lack of data on HRT type, route of administration
and duration of treatment. Historically, HRT provision and prescribing has been poor in the
UK and elsewhere, representing a significant area-of-need in women’s health. There are
different effects on various preparations of HRT, and we did not determine the type of HRT
that each woman was taking. The bulk of scientific evidence from preclinical, clinical, and
epidemiologic studies, and randomised clinical trials clearly indicates that judiciously
selected HRT is usually beneficial and rarely dangerous. The majority of women in the UK
are currently given oral estrogen, which has more risks compared to transdermal estrogen,
and may also affect immunity differently (38). Transdermal estrogen contains E2, which has
more beneficial effects on immunity as well as future health (39). Women taking HRT have
been shown to have lower future risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes,
which are all known to be associated with more severe symptoms and higher mortality from
COVID-19 (40).

Menopause is a marker of biological ageing in women that has previously been associated
with accelerated epigenetic ageing (21). The associations between menopausal status and
COVID-19 positivity and symptom severity may in part be related to biological ageing, rather
than reduction in estrogen specifically, although the COCP use results suggest that this is
unlikely. To explore the possibility that our results may be attributed to ageing, rather than a
reduction in estrogen, we also tested the association between COVID-19 symptoms and
epigenetic ageing rates in a subset of participants from the TwinsUK cohorts. Our results are
consistent with increased frequency of COVID-19 symptoms among subjects with
accelerated biological ageing. However, the sample sizes in the epigenetic subgroup
analyses is too modest to draw robust conclusions. Interestingly, despite the extremely small
sample size, the group of 3 predicted COVID-19 individuals showed significantly greater
epigenetic age acceleration, including with epigenetic measures that capture aspects of
immune-senescence (EEAA), warranting further investigation into the link between biological
ageing and COVID-19 positivity and symptom severity.
This study collected data on hundreds of thousands of women resulting in good power to
detect effects. However, our study also has several limitations. Data are self-reported, and
questions on medication use were non-standard, to ease large-scale app-based reporting.
Data on type, route, duration, and dose of hormone therapies, and importantly HRT, were
not collected due to difficulties faced collecting very detailed data using an app-based
interface. As such, untangling the effect of differing types of HRT was not possible. Most
COCPs contain between 20-35 micrograms of ethinylestradiol along with a progestogen,
while HRT estradiol doses are generally lower and more physiological. As such, lower
estrogen doses and lack of detailed data may have resulted in the lack of effect seen
amongst HRT-users. Another limitation relates to reporting bias within both symptoms and
test results. Additionally, sampling using an app will under-represent individuals without
smartphones, including older participants, and is likely to under-represent those severely
affected by COVID-19. Other limitations include the effects of unmeasured confounding and
systematic differences between individuals prescribed different types of hormone therapy.
There is also potential for selection bias where, for example, experiencing gynaecological
problems and menopause may influence likelihood of hormonal therapy use. To ascertain
the consistency of our results, we performed multiple cumulative data extracts over the
period 7 May 2020 - 15 June 2020, and observed that association results were consistent
throughout, including specifically for predicted COVID-19 associations. Nonetheless,
because prediction of COVID-19 was based on symptoms reported over a two and halfmonth period since the app launched, predictions could in some cases be influenced by the
reporting of symptoms at far-apart dates. Additionally, the individuals on which the prediction
model was trained were highly selected as COVID-19 testing was not performed at random
when the app was initially launched, although testing criteria have since been extended and
more individuals have been able to access COVID-19 testing.

Conclusion
Our findings indicate a protective effect of estrogen from symptomatic COVID-19, based on
positive association of menopausal status with predicted COVID-19, and negative
association of COCP use with predicted COVID-19. HRT use was positively associated with
COVID-19 symptoms. However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to lack of
data on HRT type, route of administration, duration of treatment, and potential comorbidities.
Further work focussed on gender with hormone profiling in both pre-clinical and clinical
settings, as well as on biological ageing, is needed to uncover novel features of the host
immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and ultimately result in more equitable health outcomes.
