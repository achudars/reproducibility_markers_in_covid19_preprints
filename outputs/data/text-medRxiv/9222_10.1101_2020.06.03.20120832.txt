Abstract
When South Florida became a hotspot for COVID-19 disease in March 2020, we faced
an urgent need to develop test capability to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. We
assembled a transdisciplinary team of knowledgeable and dedicated physicians,
scientists, technologists and administrators, who rapidly built a multi-platform, PCR- and
serology- based detection program, established drive-thru facilities and drafted and
implemented guidelines that enabled efficient testing of our patients and employees.
This process was extremely complex, due to the limited availability of needed reagents,
but outreach to our research scientists and to multiple diagnostic laboratory companies
and government officials enabled us to implement both FDA authorized and laboratory
developed testing (LDT)-based testing protocols. We analyzed our workforce needs and
created teams of appropriately skilled and certified workers, to safely process patient
samples and conduct SARS-CoV-2 testing and contact tracing. We initiated smart test
ordering, interfaced all testing platforms with our electronic medical record, and went
from zero testing capacity, to testing hundreds of healthcare workers and patients daily,
within three weeks. We believe our experience can inform the efforts of others, when
faced with a crisis situation.

Introduction
The optimal response of an academic health system to a global health crisis requires
sustained coordination between academic faculty across many departments, and
hospital and health system leadership, to develop the policies and procedures,
communication strategies and teamwork needed for timely and effective decisionmaking. Novel crises place previously unidentifiable stressors across all aspects of an
organization, and all weaknesses in the initial phases of a response must be rapidly
identified and mitigated, through clear policies and procedures that are easy to
disseminate to all involved.

The first cases of COVID-19 disease occurred in Wuhan, China, and were reported
globally by Chinese health authorities on December 31, 2019. While the first confirmed
COVID-19 case in the US was reported on January 21, 2020, the first case of COVID19 disease in Florida was reported on March 1. At the time of this writing, Florida had
46,117 cases of COVID-19 disease, with 2096 deaths (as of May 20th, 2020)1.

The University of Miami Health system (UHealth), serves a four County catchment
region with over 6 million inhabitants. We are the only University-based health system in
the region, with three in-patient facilities and seven satellite locations. The University of
Miami’s Miller School of Medicine (MSOM) employs 1100 physicians, with a
departmental structure as well as institutes and centers, including the Hussman Institute
for Human Genomics and Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Our in-house COVID-19 testing efforts began March 30, 2020, when the Chief Clinical
Officer and Interim Chief Operating Officer formed four leadership committees to
address workforce management, clinical therapeutics, equipment and resources, and
the Testing Committee, which was tasked with developing and implementing in house
testing and algorithms for testing patients and employees.
Although our healthcare system has a longstanding and resilient emergency response
infrastructure in place, based on extensive, annual preparations for the six month long
hurricane season, preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic required the involvement of
many additional personnel, with different skill sets, to address limited critical COVID-19
resources, develop and evolve testing capabilities and algorithms, while maintaining our
standard of care for non-COVID-19 patients. Like other health systems, the widespread
nature of the pandemic and the lethality of COVID-19 disease, led us to postpone or
cancel non-essential patient visits and surgeries, and expand telemedicine capabilities.
Social distancing, self-quarantine and other preventative measures were instituted,
which helped “flatten the curve”.

Public health surveillance and testing strategies are the cornerstone for effective
COVID-19 evaluation and management, so we assembled a team of pathologists,
infectious disease experts, scientists, hospital administrators, laboratory technicians,
public health practitioners, and others, who worked together to build a robust, multiplatform, PCR- and serology- based SARS-CoV-2 virus or antibody detection system.
This system is being utilized to evaluate and monitor symptomatic patients, identify
patients at risk, screen front line employees, and assess those with a history of close

contact with infected individuals. This system is enabling us to identify contagious
individuals and those likely to be immune. We have established contact tracing policies
and procedures, implemented a COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) program, and
conducted IRB-approved clinical and translational research, including a program of
community testing to define SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in our region.

Developing in-house testing capability

Our COVID-19 testing was initially outsourced to commercial reference laboratories, but
to meet our needs, we needed to rapidly develop in-house COVID-19 testing. We
created three working groups that focused on implementing manual RT-PCR testing,
automated/commercial PCR testing and serologic testing. Each group was charged with
developing diversified testing platforms, in order to achieve the flexibility needed to deal
with supply chain issues, including shortages or delays in the availability of reagents or
instrumentation, and the changing regulatory environment, based on FDA or other
agency regulations and state policies 2. The group was able to build a new molecular
laboratory designed for manual RT-PCR-based testing within two weeks, getting
reagents and instruments from the basic scientists on the medical and marine school
campuses. We then utilized four separate CLIA certified clinical laboratories for
insourcing SARS-CoV-2 testing, as shown in Figure 1. These test procedures were
chosen based on the in vitro diagnostic Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs)
published on the FDA website 3 as well as available reagents and instrumentation. The
testing platforms provide rapid turn-around time (TAT) and varying but extensive test

capacity (Figure 1), which has been crucial to optimally manage specific groups of
patients and increase capacity over time (Figure 2).

Despite its limitations, serologic testing serves as an important adjunct to PCR testing,
given the possible false negative rate of PCR-based testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA4 and
the need to detect evidence of prior infection, and possible viral immunity. Several types
of immunoassays were evaluated, including lateral flow devices (LFD), enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA).
Different tests detect different antibody isotypes (IgM, IgG, IgA, or total antibody levels),
directed against different targets (e.g. the nucleocapsid, receptor binding domain and
spike proteins) and with differing sensitivity 5-9. Current analyses provide only a
qualitative, positive or negative, result.

We validated the COVID-19 IgM/IgG Rapid Test kit, an LFD test from BioMedomics
(Beckman-Dickinson) and the Epitope ELISA-based COVID-19 assay for IgM and IgG
at our CLIA-certified high complexity laboratory. Using a venipuncture, serum or whole
blood from in-patients was evaluated using the BioMedomics LFD test, which
demonstrated 98%-100% specificity, and 71-73% sensitivity, respectively (Figure 3).
This data is superior to the previous study from a larger validation cohort, which
reported 89% sensitivity and 91% specificity. The ELISA Epitope validation
demonstrated specificity of 95% for IgM and 90% for IgG, with an 85% specificity from
the same patient samples. The BioMedomics test was initially evaluated as a EUA
assay, pending FDA approval, so we implemented it as a high complexity Laboratory

Developed Test (LDT). This required qualified laboratory personnel and a disclaimer in
the result report stating that the test is not FDA approved. On May 7th, 2020, the FDA
removed this test from the EUA pending list and hence we immediately ceased using it
for clinical testing. Subsequently, we acquired the FDA EUA-approved SARS-COV-2
IgG/IgM Rapid Test by Cellex; we are in the process of validating this device in
conjunction with the COVID-19 IgM/IgG test by Auto-bio Diagnostics (Hardy
Diagnostics) to ensure that we have sufficient testing platforms and reagents on hand,
for the ramp-up phase. As of May 20th, 2020, the Epitope IgG/IgM kit is still pending
FDA-EUA approval.

We continue to encounter problems with reagent availability, especially those that have
received FDA EUA approval, despite having assembled a team of project managers,
industrial engineers, administrators, physicians and scientists, who along with the
institution’s supply chain leaders and COVID-19 command center institutional team
assure all requests for instruments and supplies are coordinated with industry and
government agencies. We have also created interactive Gantt Charts that allow us to
track availability of supplies on a daily basis and assess staffing needs.

We created a data mining and reporting team, to ensure that institutional, state and
federal reporting data requirements are met. Key information reported included the
number of tests performed each day, the percentage of positive results, up to date turnaround-times for all laboratories, volume of orders by site and department, number of
pending results, and number of rejected, not performed or canceled tests, among

others. We leveraged the electronic medical record and laboratory information system
to capture information on the performing laboratory,

the methodology and

instrumentation used, the reference range, CPT codes for billing, results and
interpretation, and the required disclaimers stating the FDA status of EUAs or LDTs and
the limitations of the tests 10-12.

Community-based surveillance and testing initiatives
During the initial days of the pandemic, we worked with State, County and City officials
and agencies to support the establishment of community testing initiatives, helping
establish best practices for the first drive thru testing site. Committee members toured
the sites under development and provided nursing and other personnel to support the
appointment scheduling lines. Working with Miami-Dade County (MDC) officials, we
also established a surveillance program (see below) built upon random testing of cross
sections of the county’s 2.8 million population, using Biomedomics anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibody detection kits. We also provided surveillance and testing support to our first
responders.

Employee Testing- establishing a robust program
Call center: A multi-disciplinary group involving employee health, infection control,
public health experts and human resources devised a comprehensive algorithm for
assessing returning travelers, as well as potential exposures within the community or
the health care system. Our standard employee health processes and infrastructure
were insufficient to manage the myriad of issues that the COVID-19 pandemic raised,

requiring the development of a robust Employee Health call center capable of rapidly
triaging the hundreds of calls received daily. We created a dedicated, centralized phone
line, that handled calls from employees to report positive test results, exposure to or
potential symptoms of COVID-19, and was staffed by APRNs, RNs and call center
personnel. We established training procedures and algorithms that addressed employee
testing, quarantine and return to work policies to maintain a safe, essential healthcare
workforce. Then, we began to order, schedule and coordinate appointments for testing,
providing testing instructions, communicate test results and provide directions on
employee return to work dispositions, including the need for quarantine. An
Epidemiology team was formed to conduct contact tracing on individuals with positive
results and those who were presumptively positive but did not meet testing criteria (e.g.
employees who were able to complete work from home). These practices were
approved by our HIPPA, Privacy and Risk Management offices to ensure that employee
data was appropriately managed. Later, we used the expertise of this staff to support
other rapidly evolving needs, such as the testing and processing of potential donors for
our COVID-19 convalescent plasma infusion research program. As of May 15, 2020, the
call center had received 4925 calls, and ordered 881 tests.

Drive Thru Testing Initiatives: To support the critical need for testing employees for
COVID 19, we established a University-operated drive through test site within 72
operational hours, capable of performing 84 nasopharyngeal swab tests per day, that
uses a paperless check-in process that includes a 4-6 question questionnaire. The site

was created to comply with all Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) standards and use
best practices to maintain staff and patient safety.

Employee contact tracing: We also established a formal contact tracing program
called UM Tracking, Resources, and Assessment of COVID-19 Epidemiology Program
(U-TRACE), which engaged faculty with expertise in epidemiology, occupational health
and safety, nursing, informatics, environmental exposure assessment, and public health
education (Figure 4). To implement U-TRACE, we conducted a needs assessment of
key stakeholder groups, designed the contact tracing workflow and data collection
instruments, implemented a relational database to monitor and track COVID-19 cases,
and adapted the program to federal, state and local University/UHealth policy. This
supported the coordination, tracking and education of COVID-19 contact, presumptive
and confirmed cases among faculty, staff and trainees. We used REDCap, a secure,
HIPAA compliant web-based application, to establish a relational database for our
contact tracing, that allowed us to enter, review or track COVID-19 persons under
investigation (PUIs), as well as COVID-19 cases among university and hospital
employees. We established an employee hotline (XXX-XXX-TEST) to assist in contact
tracing, which provided an initial clinical assessment of symptoms and triaged
employees based on a risk assessment and separate return-to-work flow diagram.
Employees flagged for contact tracing were referred to the U-TRACE team by a
telephone encounter note available in the Electronic Health Record, by telephone or
email. For each co-worker identified by the employee (“patient zero”), the U-TRACE
made three attempts to contact the co-worker for referral and screening to the main

employee hotline. To date, the U-TRACE program has completed 1,681 employee
encounters of which 357 resulted in contact tracing due to COVID-19 presumed or
confirmed positivity, or positive COVID-19 symptoms. Approximately 81% of the
employees that required contact tracing provided permission to let their co-workers
know they were being evaluated as being potentially SARS-CoV-2 infected.

Employee serologic testing initiative: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk for
SARS-CoV-2 infection and, especially if asymptomatic, could unknowingly transmit the
virus to colleagues and/or patients. As part of our back-to-work strategic planning, to
identify asymptomatic but possibly infected HCWs, we examined the utility of serologic
testing, to be reflexed to PCR testing where appropriate (Figure 5, right panel), using an
IRB-approved research protocol and the BioMedomics Rapid IgM/IgG test that we
internally validated. We enrolled 500 asymptomatic HCWs (out of over 1600 HCW
volunteers) who were either working in clinic areas or in the hospital, and thus had
potential exposure to COVID patient/samples, over a two-three week period. Results of
this study are currently being analyzed.

Patient-testing algorithms
Our initial patient testing algorithms were based on the three-tiered CDC priority system
for testing patients with suspected SARS-COV-2 infection13. Limited access to required
personal protective equipment (PPE) 14, nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and varying
turnaround times were the greatest constraints, thus, besides patient acuity, we
incorporated the impact of utilization of scarce resources into our algorithm. Because

our testing capabilities were rapidly expanding, our triage system needed to be flexible,
so we also defined three phases of our SARS-CoV-2 testing program, with the first
phase being the roll out phase. We did not define the second and third phases
immediately, nor provide a date or criteria that we would use to announce movement
from one phase to another. The rollout phase focused on top priority cases including
those being admitted to the hospital, and those patients who required emergency
interventions or a high-risk procedure (Figure 5, left panel). Our intent was to later
include high-risk populations in the testing program, such as long-term facility residents
and symptomatic patients older than 65 or with underlying health conditions. A team of
clinicians and epidemiologists were involved in drafting these guidelines and in
reviewing individual cases to approve prompt testing when a high likelihood of infection
was suspected. Soon after we rolled out our patient testing algorithms, we began testing
all admissions through the emergency department, and all elective admissions for
cancer care 48-72 hours prior to admission.

Established and Evolving COVID-19 Research efforts
Community-based testing program: Working with key administrators from the MDC
Mayor’s Office, and call center leadership from Florida Power and Light (FPL), we
developed a community testing program called The Surveillance Project Assessing Risk
and Knowledge of Coronavirus (SPARK-C), to approximate the seroprevalence of
SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in MDC residents, determining the proportion of individuals
infected, as well as their age, gender, and racial/ethnic distribution, their most common
symptoms and the fraction of asymptomatic infections. The FPL team randomly

selected phone numbers to cover the geographic breadth of MDC, played an
automated/commercial voice recording of the County Mayor, encouraging people
answering the phone to participate, and then antibody screening was conducted at a
testing site nearest their home, typically a local park or library, after they signed an
informed consent form. Serologic testing was conducted using the Biomedomics
serologic test. However, once the FDA removed this test from the EUA list, the SPARKC program was temporarily paused to reconsider the best strategy for implementation.

Support for a convalescent plasma infusion program: We have established a
COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) infusion program, as case series from China
have shown promising results using convalescent plasma to treat patients with severe
COVID-19 15-17 With our efforts in ramping up COVID-19 testing capability both for
molecular testing and for serological testing, we established the following process to
support CCP collection: 1. Created pathway to perform COVID-19 testing for potential
CCP donors ; 2. Make COVID-19 testing results available for potential CCP donors; 3.
Consent patients who require COVID-19 testing for future contact for potential CCP
donation. To date, we have collected convalescent plasma, with assistance from
OneBlood, from dozens of individuals.

Biospecimen acquisition and analyses: To promote multidisciplinary COVID-19
research, we have developed a COVID-19 clinically annotated biobank which contains
consented and de-identified samples, including blood (serum, plasma, buffy coat
samples), and cytology fluids, saliva, urine, fine needle aspirates, and surgical or

autopsy tissue samples. Access to these materials will foster laboratory research,
support novel clinical trials and ideally generate data for NIH and other grant proposals.

Conclusions
We activated a health system crisis response team in early March to tackle the unique
challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including supply limitations (e.g.
nasopharyngeal swabs, collection kits, transport media and regent kits), that were
severely limiting our response, including our ability to perform PCR testing to detect
SARS-CoV-2 virus. Necessary, but otherwise non-descript, products such as
nasopharyngeal swabs, collection kits, transport media and reagent kits were in acute
shortage. Commercial laboratories and state health departments faced similar
shortages and challenges and soon testing turnaround times ballooned to more than 57 days. We quickly realized the pitfalls of relying heavily on any single testing platform
or vendor and created a testing committee charged with overseeing every aspect of
testing. We pulled together resources, processes, expertise, reagents, machines,
decision-making tools from across the entire campus, including the academic leaders,
the laboratory researchers, the operational leaders, and the procurement teams.
Together, we assembled numerous testing platforms, managed reagent inventory,
communicated with external vendors and developed testing algorithms for our patients
and our employees. The strength of the university’s research enterprise enabled us to
rapidly build up in-house testing capabilities, including serologic testing, which we
ordered in bulk during the early phase of our testing efforts, with goal of subsequently
validating the assays in house.

What is most evident from the current COVID-19 environment is the importance of
planning, effective resourcing, nimble regulatory bodies and clinical scientific rigor. To
achieve these goals, we developed a leadership structure, assigned tasks to key
individuals, evolved effective twice-daily communications via teleconferencing and
aligned accountability with responsibility. This was done in a rapidly changing
environment, with different authorizations and approvals (mostly EUAs) coming from the
FDA several times each week. Given the lead-time to develop new testing platforms, we
had to commit to certain workflows, even though improvements came along that
necessitated changes in the reagents used, the instruments utilized, or the body fluids
subjected to analysis.

The role of accessible diagnostics is ‘front and center’ in this crisis – not only for
knowing whether someone has the virus but also whether they may be immune to
subsequent infection but also be a potential donor for our CCP donation program.

We hope our experience in bringing together health care personnel from the health
system, the university’s research community, and its administrative leadership, can
instruct other health care systems rapidly ramp up their ability to test for pathogens and
implement health care policies that enable them to effectively respond to a health crisis.

Figure legends:

1. PCR and serologic testing platforms put in place, listing the instruments and
workflow needed to perform any given test. Turnaround times (TAT) and test
capacity per five-day workweek, based on reagents, machine capacity and
personnel in place, are shown.
2. Ramp up for weekly in-house COVID-19 testing shown, based on ordering
additional reagents, hiring additional personnel, and the increased testing
expected for patients and employees. Algorithm for determining how we can
remap up PCR testing
3. Validation results of the BioMedomics lateral flow device (LFD) serologic test.
Testing of whole blood and serum was conducted and compared to PCR results.
Overall 272 samples were tested; the sensitivity was 72-73% while the specificity
was 97-100%. The validation cohort included specimens collected at a variable
time from the onset of symptoms or the PCR test was positive.
4. Contact tracing navigation is shown for faculty, staff, students, health care
workers and trainees.
5. Testing algorithms for (left) asymptomatic patients undergoing high-risk
procedures, involving a combination of PCR and serologic testing, and (right)
asymptomatic health care workers, based on an IRB approved study of 500
employees, using serologic testing as the primary testing strategy, with reflex RT-
