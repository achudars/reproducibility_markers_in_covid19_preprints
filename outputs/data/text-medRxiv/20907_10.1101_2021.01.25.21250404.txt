ABSTRACT
Background: The prognosis of patients with COVID-19, with older age and comorbidities, is
associated with a more severe course and higher fatality rates but no analysis has yet included
factors related to the geographical area/municipality in which the affected patients live.

So

the objective of this study is to analyse the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 in terms of
sex, age, comorbidities, and geographic variables.

Methods: A retrospective cohort of 6286 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 was analysed,
considering demographic data, previous comorbidities and geographic variables.

and

geographic variables (size of the area of residence, distance to the hospital and the driving

Results: The multivariate Cox model showed that women had a better prognosis in any type of
analysed prognosis. Most of the comorbidities studied were related to a poorer prognosis
except for dementia, which is related to lower admissions and higher mortality. Suburban
areas were associated with greater mortality and with less hospital or ICU admission. Distance
to the hospital was also associated with hospital admission.

Conclusions: Factors such as type of municipality and distance to hospital act as social health
determinants.

As of the 5

(COVID-19) have been detected worldwide, and more than 1.8 million people have died from

the countries with the highest COVID-19 testing rates

The response of National Health Service (NHS), especially that of Primary Health Care (PHC),
has been crucial for containing COVID-19

In countries like Spain with large rural areas and low population densities, the effects of spatial
disparities on disease outcomes are still unknown. The objective of this study was therefore to
analyse the prognosis (hospital admission, Intensive Care Unit [ICU] admission and death) of
patients with COVID-19 in terms of sex, age, comorbidities, and geographics variables.

METHOD
We

conducted

a

retrospective

cohort

study

that

considered

demographic

data,

previous

comorbidities and geographics variables of 6286 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Aragon
(Spain) from the beginning of the current pandemic to the 30

th

of June 2020.

The inclusion criteria were an age older than 18 years and a diagnostic code of “coronavirus
infection”. There were no exclusion criteria.

Due to the universal nature of the NHS, the data obtained are considered representative of
practically 100% of the population who met the criteria for inclusion.

2

Aragón has an area of 47,719 km

2

and a population density of 28.20 inhabitants per km , with

a higher proportion of older adults than younger ones. The older adults are more concentrated
in rural areas, while the cities have younger populations. Zaragoza, the capital, contains half of
the community’s population, with only 13 municipalities exceeding 10,000 inhabitants. Rural
nuclei (with fewer than 2000 inhabitants) represent 86% of the municipalities, where only
16.8% of the population lives.

The population pyramid graph for Aragon

14

shows a contracting structure. The main age group

is 30–49 years (active population), which has been augmented by a significant increase in the
immigrant

population

since

2000.

However,

population

older

than

65

years

has

grown

significantly since the beginning of the century, a common feature in all developed regions.
The origins of this situation include a substantial reduction in fertility rates, and an increase in
life expectancy at birth. This region’s geographical and demographic characteristics make it
comparable to many other regions of inland Spain and other European and American countries
with high levels of ageing, geographical dispersion and depopulation.

The pyramid shows low crude birth rates due to the small number of initial cohorts (aged 0–4
years) and the low crude death rates.

The primary study variables were: Hospital admission, ICU admission and Death due to COVID19.

RESULTS
Of the 6286 patients studied, 2738 (43.56%) were men, 4440 (71.72%) lived in urban areas,
and the median age was 61 years (IQR 61-82). Table 1 lists the demographic characteristics and

With a considerably lower ICU admission rate, than among men (28.7% vs 62.2%) and a lower
final mortality rate (48.5% vs 57.9%) and hospital admission rate (47.6% vs 62.2%) than the
men.

There was a striking correlation with the size of the patients’ area of residence. Patients living
in urban areas had poorer prognoses in terms of hospital and ICU admissions. However, this
tendency did not occur with respect to mortality, given that 65.46% of the patients who died
lived in urban areas compared with 72.87% of those who survived (p < .001). The prevalence
rate of patients with COVID-19 in each of the 3 analysed areas shows a high prevalence in the
suburban zone, with 48 cases per 10,000 inhabitants in the urban zones, 55 cases per 10,000
inhabitants in the suburban zones, and 35 cases per 10,000 inhabitants in the rural zones. The

analysed distance to the hospitals through the median distance and time of arrival to the
hospital (Table 1) also proved to be significant.

In terms of previous comorbidity (Table 2), the poorer prognoses were associated with a
higher prevalence of any of the diseases studied, except for HIV and other immunodeficiency
diseases.

Figures 1-3 show the patients’ characteristics according to prognosis, with the survival curves
according to the size of the residents’ area and the p-value based on the log-rank test. In the
Kaplan–Meier curves, we observed that the poorest prognosis was related to suburban areas
where fewer people were admitted to hospital than in the other municipalities; nevertheless,
the COVID-19-related mortality in these areas was higher than in the other areas studied.

Table 3 shows the multivariate Cox model for each prognosis. As previously noted, women had
a better prognosis than men in any type of analysed prognosis. We can also observe similar
behaviour in terms of prognosis in the urban and rural areas. Nevertheless, suburban areas
were associated with greater mortality and with less hospital or ICU hospitalisation. Distance
from the hospital was also associated with hospital admission such that the closer the patients’
residence was to the hospital, the greater the likelihood that they would be admitted.

In terms of the prognostic model of hospital admission, most of the comorbidities studied
were related to a poorer prognosis except for dementia (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.75-0.98), which
acts as a protective factor for admissions but is still related to higher mortality.

In the ICU admission model, there were comorbidities such as CVD, neurological disease and
previous respiratory disease that disappeared from the final model. Only hypertension (HR
1.43; 95% CI 1.09-1.89), dyslipidaemia (HR 2.18; 95% CI 1.66-2.86), chronic haematological
disease (HR 1.33; 95% CI 1.02-1.74) and obesity (HR 2.04; 95% CI 1.49-2.78) were associated
with a poorer prognosis in terms of ICU admission.

Lastly, the comorbidities associated with mortality were CVD (HR 1.18; 95% CI 1.03-1.35),
previous haematological disease (HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.05-1.37), diabetes (HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.031.39) and dementia (HR 1.38; 95% CI 1.20-1.59) (Table 2).

DISCUSSION
The results of this study show how factors such as type of municipality and distance to hospital
can act as social health determinants and establish the outcomes of patients with COVID-19.
This study concurs with relevant studies in the literature on the prognosis of patients with
COVID-19 while showing that geographical factors are relevant to the prognosis.

One of our relevant results, is that suburban areas were associated with increased mortality
and with lower hospital and ICU admission. The reduced accessibility of suburban areas to

nevertheless, this is not the case in more rural areas, which have shown the same associations

. It is probably that small towns, which are

typically further away from urban cities, are inhabited by an older population with greater
social isolation and less need to travel for work reasons. So, it is highly likely that the older
population has been particularly cautious in the face of the pandemic.

The main strengths of this study are its complex model, which includes geographic variables
dealing with the comorbidities and prognosis of patients with COVID-19. Our findings can be
extrapolated to other countries with similar population pyramid and geographic dispersion.

The current pandemic, like other previous pandemics, is occurring in the context of social and
health inequalities that need to be resolved

37

. This study has sought to contribute knowledge

to the current pandemic by analysing the comorbidities associated with a large sample of
patients with COVID-19, relating them to health determinants such as age, sex, geographical
accessibility to health services and place of residence.

In future studies, data should be compared with those of other countries, especially to provide
greater knowledge on the behaviour of health systems and methods for adjusting the use of
these systems to this new disease, reducing as much as possible the clinical and epidemiologic
variability and exploring the place of residence as a social determinant.
