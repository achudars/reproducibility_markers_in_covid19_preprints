ABSTRACT: As Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread, a detailed
understanding on the transmission mechanisms is of paramount importance. The disease transmits
mainly through respiratory droplets and aerosol. Although models for the evaporation and
trajectory of respiratory droplets have been developed, how the environment impacts the
transmission of COVID-19 is still unclear. In this study, we investigate the propagation of
respiratory droplets and aerosol particles generated by speech under a wide range of temperature
(0 °C to 40 °C) and relative humidity (0% to 92%) conditions. We show that droplets can travel
three times farther in low temperature and high humidity environment, while the amount of aerosol
increases in high temperature and low humidity environment. The results also underscore the
importance of proper ventilation, as droplets and aerosol spread significantly farther in airstreams.
This study contributes to the understanding of the environmental impact on COVID-19
transmission.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing global pandemic with more than 18
million confirmed cases and over 0.7 million deaths as of August 6th1. The disease is caused by
the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).2–5 Among known
transmitting pathways of SARS-CoV-2,6,7 transmission via respiratory droplets and aerosol is
believed to be a primary mode8,9. As influenza usually vanishes in the summer10,11 and the SARS
epidemic was effectively contained in the summer of 2003,12 there have been earlier speculations
that the current pandemic of COVID-19 may well ebb as the weather warms.13 However, the
number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 continues to rise rapidly as of August1. Therefore, a
detailed understanding on the transmission mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 under different
environmental conditions is of paramount importance.
In general, environmental factors can impact the transmission of respiratory diseases
through affecting the infectivity of the pathogens14,15 and the propagation of respiratory droplets.1618

A hypothesis for the sustained high transmissibility of COVID-19 even in the summer is that

SARS-CoV-2 is more persistent at high temperatures compared to influenza and SARS. A number
of studies have investigated the resistance of incubated and aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 to heat and
humidity.19-21 Although more studies are needed to confirm the activity of SARS-CoV-2 in
different environments, the virus can generally remain infectious from several minutes to longer
than a day in various environments, much longer than the traveling time of respiratory droplets to
reach another person through speech or sneeze.22,23 Therefore, understanding how environmental
conditions impact the propagation of respiratory droplets becomes increasingly important.
The propagation of respiratory droplets plays a critical role in delivering pathogencarrying agents to susceptible hosts. Respiratory droplets are generated by talking, coughing and
sneezing, with initial speeds ranging from ~1 m/s to >100 m/s.23–25 Extensive studies have been
conducted to investigate the formation,17,18 traveling,16–18,25,26 and infectivity

27,28

of respiratory

droplets. The airborne spread of small respiratory droplets and droplet nuclei under different
indoor configurations and ventilation designs have been studied to evaluate the indoor
infections.29-31 Predictions of the infection probability under certain circumstances have been
reported as well.32-34 These past studies suggest that, during the spread of respiratory droplets, both
aerodynamics and evaporation determine the effectiveness of virus propagation. Although models
for the evaporation and trajectory of respiratory droplets have been developed,26,35,36 how the
environmental temperature, humidity and air velocity impact the transmission of COVID-19 is

still unclear. Under certain environmental conditions, how far can the virus carriers travel on
average? What fraction of droplets will turn into aerosol particles? What role do the HVAC and
air conditioning systems play in virus propagation? Quantitative answers to these practical
questions can provide urgently needed guidance to both policy makers and the general public, e.g.
on environment-specific social distancing rules.
In this study, we investigate the influence of environmental conditions including
temperature, humidity and airflow velocity, on the propagation of speech respiratory droplets. We
solve the kinematic equations to analyze the transport, accumulation and deposition of respiratory
aerosol particles, and calculate the spreading distance of speech droplets based on previous
modeling frameworks26,35,36 for the evaporation and trajectory of a single droplet. We evaluate the
results under a wide range of temperature (0 °C to 40 °C) and relative humidity (0% to 92%)
conditions, including weather conditions based on US geographical locations. The results suggest
that droplets travel farther in low temperature and high humidity environments, while the amount
of aerosol particles increase in high temperature and low humidity environments. In particular, the
6 feet of physical distance recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
is insufficient to eliminate all possible droplet contacts in certain cold and humid environments.
The risk of aerosol transmission may be increased in summer, as hot and dry environments
facilitate the accumulation of PM2.5. This study highlights the need for adaptive public health
precautions based on seasonal weather variations and the local environment, and contributes to the
understanding of the environmental impact of COVID-19 transmission.

Figure 1. Transmission of COVID-19 through droplets and aerosol particles. After being
exhaled by a patient, respiratory droplets with various sizes will travel and simultaneously
evaporate in the ambient environment. Small-sized droplets dry immediately to form a cloud of
aerosol particles. These particles will suspend in the air for a significant amount of time. Largesized droplets can reach a limited distance and fall to the ground due to gravity. We define Lmax as
the maximum horizontal distance that droplets can travel before they either become dry aerosol
particles or descend below the level of another person’s hands, i.e., H/2 from the ground, where H
is the height of another person. SARS-CoV-2 image by Alissa Eckert, MS; Dan Higgins, MAMS
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA.

Figure 1 presents the fate of respiratory droplets. Once released, the droplets begin to
evaporate while moving under various forces (gravity, buoyancy and air drag).26,35,36 As a result,
large droplets can directly land on another person, and small droplets dehydrate and become solid
aerosol particles containing pathogens, salts, enzymes, cells, and surfactants (Figure 1). The
aerosol particles defined here are different from the airborne aerosol defined by the World Health
Organization (WHO),37 which employed a straight 5 μm cut-off. Aerosol particles are capable of
causing long-range infection because of their long suspension time in air.21,38,39 On the other hand,
the infection range of large droplets is limited to a relatively short distance, because the droplets
can directly land on the upper body of another person before drying. Therefore, we define a critical
distance Lmax as the maximum horizontal distance that all respiratory droplets can travel before
they either shrink to aerosol particles or descend to the level of another person’s hands (H/2 from
the ground, where H is the person’s height, Figure S5).
Understanding how the environment affects transmission of COVID-19 requires predicting
Lmax as well as the amount of aerosol particles generated. Before a respiratory droplet evolve into
aerosol particle, the evaporation dynamics and the trajectory of the droplet have been modeled by
previous works26,35,36, based on aerodynamics, kinematics and heat and mass transfer. These
modeling frameworks are used in this study to predict Lmax and aerosolization rate φa (defined as
the percentage of droplets that become aerosol particles) for a cluster of speech droplets in different
environments. After respiratory droplets completely dehydrate, we solve the kinematic equations
to analyze the transport, accumulation and deposition of residual aerosol particles. The detailed

model formulations, including the dynamic analysis on droplets, Brownian motion, and kinematic
analysis on aerosol particles, are provided in the Supporting Information.
Key parameters considered in this study include the initial droplet velocity v0, the
distribution of initial droplet size d0, environmental temperature T∞, relative humidity RH, and
background air velocity Vair. The initial velocity v0 of droplets was taken as 4.1 m/s for speaking.40
We focus on modeling speech droplets to mimic a social distancing situation where people keep a
reasonable physical distance and only sneeze/cough into a tissue or their elbows. The probability
distribution of initial droplet diameter d0 is derived from a previous work.418

The initial

temperature T0 of exhaled droplets was set to be 33 ℃.429 For the environment, we used Vair = 0.3
m/s in horizontal direction as the wind speed for a typical indoor environment,43 and varied Vair
from 0-3 m/s when analyzing the effect of wind. Respiratory droplets are assumed as a
physiological saline solution (0.9% weight fraction)26 for simplicity. Even though most buildings
in the US are maintained at 21-24 ℃ all year round,44 many regions in the world do not have
proper air-conditioning systems. In addition, the temperature and humidity of some industrial
settings such as meat processing plants are maintained outside typical setpoints of residential
buildings and superspreading events have been reported therein. Therefore, we vary environmental
temperature T∞ and relative humidity RH from 0-42 ℃ and 0-0.92, respectively, to include diverse
situations.
The results are presented in Figure 2. For transmission via droplet contact, we plotted Lmax
as defined previously, under different temperature and humidity conditions. Figure 2a shows that
droplets can travel a longer distance in humid and cool environments. Therefore, such
environments require a longer physical distance. In extremely cold and humid scenarios, droplets
can reach as far as 6 m. On the other hand, respiratory droplets evaporate faster in hot and dry
environments (Figure S4). As those droplets sharply decrease in size, the horizontal traveling
distance is reduced due to the growing damping effect of air. In most regions of Figure 2(a), Lmax
exceeds 1.8 m, i.e., the 6 feet of physical distance recommended by CDC. Therefore, current social
distancing guidelines may be insufficient in preventing transmission via droplet contact, especially
for cold and humid environments.

A quick remark regarding droplet-based transmission is that, if we consider a relaxed

by aerosol particles), this distance occurs at 1.4 m based on our results (Figure S7). Here we
assumed a constant concentration of the virus in the droplets and the number of viruses is
consequently proportional to the initial mass of respiratory droplets.45 Interestingly, we find that
this relaxed social distancing standard does not show an apparent dependence on the environment
(see Supporting Information). Therefore, 1.4 m may serve as a relaxed weather-independent
criterion that can prevent the majority of viruses from directly landing on another person. Caution
is still required as this relaxed rule does not block transmission via aerosol particles and is
evaluated for speaking mode with an air velocity of 0.3 m/s. As discussed in a later section, this
distance increases for an increased air velocity.
We also predict the aerosolization rate φa in different environments to evaluate the potential
risk of transmission via aerosol particles. This transmission mode can be highly effective,46 as
evidenced by the increasing number of superspreading events that occurred at indoor environments.
On the contrary to the trend observed for Lmax, Figure 2(b) predicts an increasing aerosolization
rate φa for hot and dry environments. The terminal sizes of these aerosol particles are in the range
of 1 μm to 15 μm based on our results (Figure 2(c) and Figure S8). Such small particles can
potentially suspend in air for hours 34,38 before settling (Figure S8) and tend to accumulate in public
areas such as schools, offices, hotels, and hospitals. Therefore, the long-range infection induced
by aerosol particles deserves more attention in summer, especially in dry weather.
The effectiveness of aerosol transmission also relies on the ability of aerosol particles to
infiltrate respiratory tracts. Generally, small particles are able to infiltrate deeper in the respiratory
tract to establish infections, as they can travel with inhaled air current and avoid impaction within
the nasal region.27 In particular, the filtration efficiency of facial masks is also dependent on the
particulate diameter and the proportion between aerosol particles and droplets.47 Therefore,
understanding the transport and size distribution of aerosol particles can provide key information
to the design and fabrication of proper facial covering under different circumstances to ensure
optimal protection. We calculate the average diameter of aerosol particles floating in air under
different weather conditions. The terminal size of an aerosol particle after dehydration is calculated
by approximating to the volume of sodium chloride originally dissolved in the aqueous solution.
The volume of viruses, estimated based on reported viral load in clinical samples48 and the
diameter of the virus49, is negligible compared to that of the salt contained in respiratory liquids.

Therefore, we only considered the salt when modeling the size of aerosol particles (see Supporting
Information). Figure 2(c) demonstrates that aerosol particles have average diameters between 2-5
μm, and the maximum diameters are generally smaller than 10 μm, indicative of their strong ability
to penetrate into the human respiratory system. The average particle diameter is increased for hot
and dry weather, because more large droplets can completely evaporate due to enhanced
evaporation (Figure 2b).
Since PM2.5 has been associated with a higher possibility of reaching the lung,50 we then
discuss the transport and deposition of aerosol particles classified within PM2.5 in different
environment. We first computed the size-dependent suspension time ts from the following equation:
𝑡

𝑣𝑒 𝑡𝑠 + (𝑣𝑡 − 𝑣𝑒 )𝜏 (1 − exp (− 𝜏𝑠 )) =

𝐿𝑚
2

− 𝐿𝑧

(1)

where ve is the falling velocity of the aerosol particle by assuming gravity is entirely balanced by
buoyancy and air drag, vt is the downward velocity of the aerosol particle at the time of drying out.
If we neglect the Brownian motion, the time constant 𝜏 of the micro-sized droplet/particle can be
written as (see Supporting Information for details on Brownian motion and 𝜏):
𝜏=

2𝜌𝑑 𝑟 2

(2)

9𝜇𝑎

where ⍴d is the density of the droplet, r is the droplet radius and μa is the dynamic viscosity of air.
For respiratory droplets with diameters smaller than 100 μm, the time constant 𝜏 is less than 0.05 s,
indicative of a strong damping effect of air. While large aerosol particles can suspend in air for at
least 25 minutes, small aerosol suspends substantially longer (Figure S8(b)), which agrees with
previous literature.18
We further calculate the steady-state total mass md of PM2.5 produced by one patient that
speaks continuously in an enclosed and unventilated space with a volume of Ve. The generation
rate of speech droplets is from a previous study.51 The steady state is reached when the number of
aerosol particles produced from speaking is equal to the number of particles depositing onto the
ground. Given the value of Ve and the average number of patients, md can be used to estimate the
number density of pathogen-carrying PM2.5 in air. Figure 2(d) presents md in different
environmental conditions. There is slightly more PM2.5 suspending in air in a hot and dry
environment than in a cold and humid environment. This is mainly due to the increased suspension

time in hot and dry environments as a result of the corresponding thermophysical properties of the
air. By combining Figures 2(b) and 2(d), the hot and dry environment not only increases the
percentage of respiratory droplets turning into aerosols, but also facilitates the accumulation of
PM2.5 in an enclosed space. These observations raise concerns over aerosol transmission of
COVID-19 in summertime, especially when the humidity is low.

Lmax as a function of a horizontal, constant air speed.
Background air velocity is another environmental factor that impact the transmission of
contagious diseases. 52-54 Here, we investigate the effect of the velocity of a horizontal airflow on
the droplet spreading distance and aerosolization rate under a typical environment (T∞ = 23 ℃,
RH = 0.50). In practice, air velocity distribution can be quite complex, and detailed CFD models
are required for a more accurate prediction.55,56 For indoor conditions, air velocity is generally
maintained below 0.3 m/s for thermal comfort purposes.57 We change the air speed from
completely stagnant (Vair = 0 m/s), to Vair = 3 m/s to include diverse environmental settings. For a
worst-case estimation, we consider a scenario where the airflow is always directed from a patient
to another susceptible host. As shown in Figure 3, the spreading distance of droplets increases

dramatically as the airflow velocity increases, which can reach 23 m at Vair = 3 m/s. In addition,
the spreading distance of aerosol particles is greatly increased as well, since they are smaller in
size and travel with the wind. In summary, improper airflow configurations may expand the
traveling distance of pathogen-carrying droplets and aerosol particles, although introducing fresh
outdoor air can effectively dilute the accumulation of infectious aerosol particles.52 This poses
stringent requirements on the meticulous design of ventilation configurations in non-hospital
facilities, so as to curb the transmission of COVID-19.

To help evaluate the risk of infections in different regions across the United States, we
compute Lmax and φa based on the average weather conditions of each state in August,58 and the
results are shown Figure 4 (a) and (b). The weather data we collected are a monthly average over
day and night as well as rural and urban regions. Figure 4 shows that, the inland regions are more
vulnerable to aerosolization of viruses and the coastal regions should be cautious of droplet-based
infections. California, on average, exhibits a higher risk of droplet spreading but a lower risk of
infection induced by aerosol particles (Figure 4(a) and 4(b)). However, within the state of
California, strong variations exist as shown in Figure 4(c) and 4(d). Note that Figure 4(c) and (d)
were plotted using the average temperature and relative humidity in the afternoon of August.58 We
also analyzed Lmax and φa in major US cities in both summer (August) and winter (December)
climates, as shown in Figure 4(e) and (f). Compared to summer, there is a higher chance of dropletbased infections in winter, while the aerosolization rate merely changes. Considering the extreme
stability of SARS-CoV-2 in low temperature,19 a recurrent wintertime outbreak of COVID-19 is
entirely probable.
To summarize, we investigate the effect of environmental temperature, relative humidity
and airflow velocity on the propagation of respiratory droplets and accumulation of aerosol
particles, in order to elucidate environmental impacts on the transmission of COVID-19. We show
that droplets travel farther in low temperature and high humidity environments, while the amount
of aerosol particles increase in high temperature and low humidity environments. The current
social distancing standard is insufficient in many situations, as droplets may reach as far as 6 m in
extreme cold and humid environment. Alternatively, a relaxed standard of 1.4 m is able to block
95% of the viruses carried by respiratory droplets (excluding that carried by aerosol particles) and
shows negligible variation over different environmental conditions. Improper airflow can
dramatically increase the traveling distance of both droplets and aerosol particles, and
consequently increases the risk of COVID-19 transmission. While particulate diameter differs over
different environmental settings, proper and adaptive face-covering based on the aerosolization of
respiratory droplets is recommended.59-61 These findings suggest that adaptive public health
measures should be taken in accordance with seasonal weather variations and local environments.
The insights gained from this study may shed light on the course of development of the current
pandemic, when combined with systematic epidemiological studies.
