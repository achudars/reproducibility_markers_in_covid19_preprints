Research in context

25

Evidence before this study

26

Before this study, we searched PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar on Oct 12, 2020, for articles

27

investigated the number of HIV test and HIV cases during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, using the

28

search terms “novel coronavirus” or “SARS-CoV-2”, and “HIV“ or “AIDS”, and “Japan”, with no time

29

restrictions. We found no published work relevant to our study.

30

Added value of this study

31

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, the public health centers and municipalities temporarily

32

suspended facility-based HIV testing to concentrate their limited resources to COVID-19 testing. We

33

investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of HIV tests in public health centers and

34

municipalities, and on the number of HIV cases with and without AIDS diagnosis. We confirmed that the

35

number of the test declined in the second quarter (April to June) of 2020, and the proportion of HIV with

36

AIDS diagnosis among all HIV cases increased during the same period.

37

Implications of all the available evidence

38

Providing sufficient HIV testing opportunities even during the pandemic, when facility-based testing is

39

challenging, is necessary for better clinical and public health outcomes. Self-testing and home specimen

40

collection (e.g. dried blood spot or oral fluid test) could be a key to fill the gap between the need for HIV

41

testing and the constraints related to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Abstract

44

Background:

45

During the COVID-19 outbreak, medical resources were primarily allocated to COVID-19, which might

46

have reduced facility capacity for HIV testing. Further, people may have opted against HIV testing during

47

this period to avoid COVID-19 exposure. We investigate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV

48

testing and its consequences in Japan.

49

Methods:

50

We analysed quarterly HIV/AIDS-related data from 2015 to the second quarter of 2020 using an anomaly

51

detection approach. The data included the number of consultations that public health centers received, the

52

number of HIV tests performed by public health centers or municipalities, and the number of newly reported

53

HIV cases with and without AIDS diagnosis. As sensitivity analyses, we performed the same analysis for

54

two subgroups: men who have sex with men (MSM) and non-Japanese.

55

Findings:

56

The number of HIV tests (9,584 vs. 35,908 in the year-before period) and consultations (11,689 vs. 32,565)

57

performed by public health centers significantly declined in the second quarter of 2020, while the proportion

58

of HIV cases with AIDS diagnosis among all HIV cases (36·2% vs. 26·4%) significantly increased after

59

removing the trend and seasonality effects. The number of HIV cases without AIDS diagnosis numerically

60

decreased (166 vs. 217), although the reduction was not significant. We confirmed similar trend for the

61

MSM and non-Japanese groups.

62

Interpretation:

63

The current HIV testing system including public health centers misses more HIV cases at the early phase of

64

the infection during the pandemic. Given that the clear epidemiological picture of HIV incidence during the

65

pandemic is still uncertain, continuously monitoring the situation as well as securing sufficient test resources

66

using self-test is essential.

Introduction

73

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had broad influences on lifestyle and health issues beyond COVID-

74

19. There have been positive impacts, such as a curtailed 2019/2020 influenza season in Japan (1), which

75

could be partially explained by measures taken to constrain the COVID-19 outbreak. Due to reduced

76

economic activity and human mobility during lockdown, air pollution, which is a risk factor of pulmonary

77

diseases, was temporally improved in China (2). However, there are many problems caused by risk

78

mitigating interventions for COVID-19, many of which are under investigation. Fear and anxiety about this

79

new disease and changed lifestyle have been stressful for many people, which has worsened mental health

80

(3-5).

81

Further, during this pandemic period, non-COVID-19 diseases have been at a lower priority for treatment

82

because medical resources have been disproportionately allocated to treat COVID-19 patients in many

83

health care facilities and the capacity to care for non-COVID-19 disease has been limited. Moreover, health

84

care facilities need to balance the benefits of providing care for non-critical conditions with minimizing the

85

risk of COVID-19 infections for both health care professionals and patients (6).

86

People living with HIV infections have better outcomes with early diagnosis and connection to antiretroviral

87

treatment. Early diagnosis is also key to preventing onward transmission because early infection is

88

characterized by high viral load and receiving an HIV diagnosis facilitates behavioural change. However,

89

Lagat et al. reported a decline in HIV test volume in Kenya due to many barriers related to COVID-19, such

90

as lack of funds to visit clinics and fear of COVID-19 infection at clinics (7).

91

To increase HIV testing opportunities, in the United States the CDC is recommending self-testing of HIV or

92

home specimen collection (e.g. dried blood spot or oral fluid test) to avoid COVID-19 infection risk

93

associated with face-to-face testing service (8). In Japan, the number of self-collection-based HIV tests has

94

increased, though the majority of tests are still conducted at public health centers and clinics (i.e., facility-

95

based testing). However, during the pandemic, public health centers and clinics have been overwhelmed by

96

COVID-19 PCR testing and administrative work and many have temporally suspended or limited HIV

97

testing.

98

AIDS is usually diagnosed by the specific symptoms and the average incubation period is 10 years (9, 10).

99

Therefore, the impact of the pandemic on the number of reported HIV cases with AIDS diagnosis will not be

100

substantial in a short-term period (< 1 year). In contrast, the median time interval between HIV infection to

101

the diagnosis without AIDS symptoms is 1 ·0 years in Tokyo, Japan (11), thus the impact of shortage of the

102

HIV test on the number of HIV cases without AIDS diagnosis will be observed even if the pandemic does

103

not continue over a year.

104

We assessed temporal patterns in HIV testing during the first two quarters of 2020: 1) number of HIV

105

consultations received by public health centers, 2) number of tests performed at public health centers and

106

municipalities, 3) number of newly reported HIV cases without AIDS diagnosis, and 4) number of newly

107

reported HIV cases with AIDS diagnosis. Further, we assessed whether the proportion of HIV cases with

108

AIDS diagnosis among new HIV cases increased.

109
110

Methods

111

Data

112

HIV/AIDS-related data were extracted from the quarterly report from the National AIDS Surveillance

113

Committee from the first quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2020 (12). The data included: (1) the

114

number of HIV/AIDS-related consultations at public health centers, (2) the number of HIV antibody tests

115

performed at public health centers or by municipalities, (3) the number of reported HIV cases with and

116

without AIDS diagnosis in Japan. We further extracted the data of HIV cases with and without AIDS

117

diagnosis for the following two subgroups: men who have sex with men (MSM) and non-Japanese, because

118

MSM accounts for about 70% of the newly reported HIV cases (12), and foreigners are considered

119

vulnerable during disasters due to language barriers (13). The data on the number of tests and consultations

120

for these subgroups were not available.

121

Note that HIV cases with AIDS diagnosis here represent new cases of HIV identified at late-stages,

122

compatible with an AIDS diagnosis. Thus, this number does not include HIV cases with AIDS diagnosis that

123

were previously diagnosed and progressed to AIDS. To rephrase, the new HIV cases here are divided into

124

two categories: early diagnosis (HIV cases without AIDS diagnoses) and late diagnosis (HIV cases with

125

AIDS diagnoses). HIV tests at clinics/hospitals and self-testing are also available in Japan. Thus, the number

126

of HIV testing performed by public health centers or municipalities was used to examine the trend of

127

facility-based tests, rather than capturing the total number of HIV tests or examining the proportion of HIV

128

positive cases among all the HIV tests.

129

Anomaly detection

130

We applied an anomaly detection approach to those longitudinal data to identify the period when the number

131

of HIV related consultations, HIV antibody tests, and new HIV cases with and without AIDS diagnosis were

132

disrupted. Further, we tested when the proportion of HIV cases with AIDS diagnosis among all new HIV

133

cases were disrupted. First, each longitudinal data was decomposed into seasonal, trend, and remainder

134

components by seasonal-trend decomposition using LOESS (STL)(14). In STL, LOESS smoothing was

135

iteratively used to determine the trend component. After removing the trend component, LOESS smoothing

136

was again used to extract the seasonal component (one-year cycle). The trend component was tested whether

137

it had an increasing or decreasing trend using a non-parametric Spearman test (15). The remainder was

138

analyzed with an anomaly detection method, the Generalized Extreme Studentized Deviate Test (GESD),

139

which identified outliers progressively using the deviation from mean as a test statistic (16). A statistical

140

significance level was set at 0 ·05. All analyses were performed on the statistical computing software R 4.0.1

141

(R Development Core Team) with the library ‘anomalize’.

142
143

Results

144

Figure 1 shows the observed data points and the computed normal range (the shaded area). We observed a

145

significant downward trend in HIV cases with or without AIDS diagnosis (Figure 1AB), all the HIV cases

146

(Figure 1C), and the number of consultations (Figure 1E) over the period examined (from the first quarter

147

of 2015 to the second quarter of 2020). The trend in number of tests was not significant during the period

148

(Figure 1D). The proportion of HIV cases with AIDS diagnosis among all the HIV cases showed a

149

significant downward trend during the period (Figure 1F), suggesting that more HIV cases have been

150

diagnosed in the early phase of infection recently. Regarding anomaly by the last quarter of 2019 (i.e.,

151

before the COVID-19 pandemic), there are a couple of data points that significantly deviated from the

152

normal range. However, the magnitude of the deviation of those numbers was modest.

153

We did not observe deviation in any numbers in the first quarter of 2020. However, in the second quarter,

154

the numbers of HIV tests and HIV consultations significantly declined (Figure 1DE), which is compatible

155

with a public health infrastructure overwhelmed by COVID-19 related work. In contrast, the proportion of

156

HIV cases with AIDS diagnosis among all HIV cases significantly increased (Figure 1F). Intriguingly, the

157

number of HIV cases with AIDS diagnosis in the second quarter of 2020 showed the same trend as before

158

(Figure 1B). The number of HIV cases without AIDS diagnosis numerically decreased in the second quarter

159

of 2020 (Figure 1A), however it was not significant. It is worth noting that the number of HIV cases without

160

AIDS diagnosis did not decline as much as the number of tests (the former dropped 23.5%, whereas the

161

latter dropped 73.3% compared with the year-before period). This might be because more HIV cases with

162

acute symptoms (i.e., fever) visited clinics for viral test for SARS-CoV-2 and HIV infection was

163

subsequently diagnosed.

164

As a sensitivity analysis, we examined the longitudinal data of HIV cases with and without AIDS diagnosis

165

of two subgroups: men who have sex with men (MSM) and non-Japanese. We confirmed the same

166

downward trend for the MSM population as for the total population (Figure 2A-C) in terms of newly

167

reported HIV cases with and without AIDS diagnosis. On contrary, the HIV cases without AIDS diagnosis

168

and all HIV cases among non-Japanese were in upward trend (Figure 3AC). The number of HIV cases

169

without AIDS diagnosis numerically decreased, whereas HIV cases with AIDS diagnosis numerically

170

increased or were in the same trend as before in these two populations in the second quarter of 2020 (Figure

171

2AB and 3AB). As a result, the proportion of HIV cases with AIDS diagnosis among all positive cases also

172

numerically increased in the second quarter of 2020 in these two subgroups (Figure 2D and 3D); however,

173

they were not significant, which might be due to the small sample size. The proportion of HIV cases among

174

MSM and non-Japanese populations relative to total HIV cases was consistent over time including the

175

second quarter of 2020 (Figure 2E and 3E).

178

A significant anomaly was identified in the number of tests and consultations performed by public health

179

centers and municipalities, the proportion of HIV cases with AIDS diagnosis among new HIV cases in the

180

second quarter of 2020 after removing seasonality and trend, which corresponds to the period of COVID-19

181

pandemic in Japan. Further, the number of HIV cases without AIDS diagnosis numerically decreased in the

182

second quarter of 2020, although it was not significant. Under the COVID-19 pandemic situation, public

183

health centers temporally suspended HIV tests. Further, people might have skipped the testing at public

184

health centers because of the fear of COVID-19 infection or the state of emergency. The temporal change in

185

the number of HIV tests, the number of HIV cases without symptoms, and the proportion of HIV cases with

186

AIDS diagnosis may reflect such temporal change in HIV testing system in public health centers and

187

municipalities.

188

We need to interpret the results carefully. First, we have analyzed the number of tests performed by public

189

health centers and municipalities. However, this type of test accounts for less than half of the tests

190

performed in Japan. For example, self-collection-based tests (mostly using dried blood spot) are increasing,

191

and tests are available in clinics and hospitals; however, the count of those tests was not available. It is

192

probable that the number of different types of HIV test has increased during the same period as

193

compensation for the reduction in the number of tests performed by public health centers and municipalities.

194

Second, we do not know the full picture of the impact of the pandemic on HIV epidemiology. We have used

195

the number of reported HIV cases; however, there is likely a substantial proportion of undiagnosed cases,

196

and it is uncertain whether the number and the proportion of undiagnosed cases changed during the

197

pandemic. It is possible that the incidence increased (or decreased) during the pandemic. Therefore, even

198

though the number of new HIV cases did not change dramatically, it does not indicate that the number of

199

tests is sufficient to identify all HIV patients. Indeed, the number of reported HIV positive cases without

200

progressed to AIDS in the second quarter of 2020 was the lowest in the last five years and the proportion of

201

HIV cases with AIDS diagnosis significantly increased. It raises a concern that the testing opportunities

202

might not be sufficient to fully capture the epidemiological situation of HIV/AIDS during the pandemic in

203

Japan. Because most of the HIV cases with AIDS diagnosis are identified in clinics or hospitals due to

204

specific symptoms, HIV cases with AIDS diagnosis are less prone to being affected by healthcare avoidance

205

even under the pandemic. Indeed, the number of HIV cases with AIDS diagnosis was in the same trend as

206

before the pandemic. We need to keep monitoring the situation as well as adapting testing strategies to work

207

in these unusual circumstances.

208

As the pandemic continues, we do not know how long the HIV testing opportunities provided by public

209

health centers could be disrupted and how it could affect HIV spread. Given that early detection and

210

treatment initiation for HIV is lifesaving, providing sufficient HIV testing opportunities is important.

211

UNAIDS has a proposed treatment target, “90-90-90” to control the HIV epidemic (17). A part of the target

212

is that “By 2020, 90% of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status.” If the COVID-19

213

pandemic continuously disrupts testing opportunities, diagnosing 90% of people living with HIV might be

214

difficult to achieve. Self-testing and home specimen collection could be a key to fill the gap between the

215

need for HIV testing and the constraints related to the COVID-19 outbreak.

216

The strength of this study is that we used the quarterly HIV/AIDS reports in Japan, which include all the

217

diagnosed cases as physicians are required to report all diagnosed cases under the Infectious Diseases

218

Control Law(18). Further, the cases reported as HIV cases with AIDS diagnosis include only the cases of

219

newly diagnosed HIV infection co-occurring with AIDS. Therefore, we could quantify the proportion of

220

patients presenting with AIDS at the time of diagnosis, which captures late-presentation for diagnosis and is

221

more likely if testing resources are not accessible.

222

A limitation of this study is that we were not able to account for the heterogeneous epidemiology of HIV

223

between different regions. Higher HIV incidence has been observed in urban areas such as Tokyo and Osaka

224

compared with rural areas. Thus, public health centers in urban areas have allocated budgetary resources

225

towards HIV testing, whereas this has not been prioritized in rural areas. During the pandemic, the testing

226

opportunities in rural areas may have declined even further than urban areas. Our study mainly focused on

227

HIV cases with and without AIDS diagnosis and testing regardless of the patients’ characteristics. One of

228

the concerns in this pandemic is that more vulnerable populations, such as sex workers, low-income

229

populations, younger population, in addition to foreigners, may have experienced disproportionate harms.

230

Further studies should focus on these populations and identify barriers to testing. We used only the number

231

of tests performed by public health centers and municipalities, thus self-tests and home specimen collection,

232

which are increasingly popular, and tests performed in clinics and hospitals were not counted. Further

233

investigation is necessary to focus on these types of tests to fully understand the response of the HIV testing

234

system to COVID-19 in Japan. We demonstrated that the uptake of HIV testing provided by public health

235

centers and municipalities declined; further, HIV cases without AIDS diagnosis during the COVID-19

236

pandemic numerically decreased and the proportion of HIV cases with AIDS diagnosis increased. Thus, it

237

will be critical to provide sufficient HIV testing opportunities and keep sustained attention on the

238

unpredictable and previously unobserved public health consequences of the interactions between the dual

239

COVID-19 and HIV epidemics.
