Key points

Question
What is the evidence on the susceptibility and transmission of children and young people to SARS-

CoV-2 in comparison with adults?

Findings
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, children and young people under 18-20 years had an

435 lower odds of secondary infection of with SARS-CoV-2 compared to adults 20 years plus, a

significant difference. This finding was most marked in children under 12-14 years. Data were

insufficient to conclude whether transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children is lower than by adults.

Meaning
We found preliminary evidence that children have a lower susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection

compared with adults, although data for adolescents is less clear. The role that children and young

people play in transmission of this pandemic remains unclear.

Abstract

Importance

The degree to which children and young people are infected by and transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus is

unclear. The role of children and young people in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on

susceptibility, symptoms, viral load, social contact patterns and behaviour.

Objective

We undertook a rapid systematic review to address the question “What is the susceptibility to and

transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children and adolescents compared with adults?”

Data sources

We searched PubMed and medRxiv up to 28 July 2020 and identified 13,926 studies, with additional

studies identified through handsearching of cited references and professional contacts.

Study Selection

We included studies which provided data on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children and young

people ( <20 years) compared with adults derived from contact-tracing or population-screening. We

excluded single household studies.

Data extraction and Synthesis

We followed PRISMA guidelines for abstracting data, independently by 2 reviewers. Quality was

assessed using a critical appraisal checklist for prevalence studies. Random effects meta-analysis was

undertaken.

Secondary infection rate (contact-tracing studies) or prevalence or seroprevalence (population-

screening studies) amongst children and young people compared with adults.

Results

32 studies met inclusion criteria; 18 contact-tracing and 14 population-screening. The pooled odds

ratio of being an infected contact in children compared with adults was 0.56 (0.37, 0.85) with

substantial heterogeneity (95%). Three school contact tracing studies found minimal transmission by

child or teacher index cases. Findings from population-screening studies were heterogenous and

were not suitable for meta-analysis. The majority of studies were consistent with lower

seroprevalence in children compared with adults, although seroprevalence in adolescents appeared

similar to adults.

Conclusions

There is preliminary evidence that children and young people have lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-

2, with a 43% lower odds of being an infected contact. There is weak evidence that children and

young people play a lesser role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at a population level. Our study

provides no information on the infectivity of children.

Background

The degree to which children and young people under 20 years are infected by and transmit the

SARS-CoV-2 virus is an unanswered question.

These data are vital to inform national plans for

relaxing social distancing measures including reopening schools.

Children and young people account for 1-3% of reported cases across countries

and an even

Children appear more likely to have asymptomatic

infection than adults and analyses based upon symptom-based series underestimate infections in

children.

The role that children and young people play in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by is dependent upon

their risk of exposure, their probability of being infected upon exposure (susceptibility), the extent to

which they develop symptoms upon infection, the extent to which they develop a viral load

sufficiently high to transmit and their propensity for making potentially infectious contact with

others, dependent upon numbers of social contacts across age-groups and behaviour during those

contacts.

Different study types may provide useful information on susceptibility and transmission in children

compared with adults, yet each is open to bias. Contact-tracing studies with systematic follow-up of

all contacts to estimate secondary attack rates (SAR) in children and adults can provide strong

evidence on differential susceptibility. Findings from some contact tracing studies suggest that

children have lower SARS-CoV-2 SAR than adults,

Population-screening studies may identify infection through viral RNA detection or antibodies

indicating prior infection. However the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in children in a population is not a

direct indicator of susceptibility or transmission as the expected prevalence depends on exposure,

susceptibility, proportions of children in the population, mixing rates among children and between

adults and children and timing of social distancing interventions that disrupt mixing.

A number of authors have concluded that children and young people may be less susceptible to

SARS-CoV-2,

2,14

although there are multiple sources of bias in each study type which can complicate

straightforward analysis. In contact-tracing studies, testing of only symptomatic contacts will

introduce significant bias, as will seroprevalence studies drawn from clinical contact studies (e.g.

primary care) or residual laboratory sera. Many studies undertaken quickly during the pandemic are

under-powered to identify age-differences.

We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of published and unpublished literature to

assess the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in children and adolescents compared with adults. We

limited this review to contact-tracing studies and population-based studies as these are likely to be

most informative and least open to bias.

Methods

Our review question was “What is the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 by children and adolescents

compared with adults?”

We undertook a rapid systematic review and included contact tracing studies or prevalence studies

in published or preprint form and including data from a national public health website reporting

government statistics and studies. Studies were required to provide data on proven SARS-CoV-2

infection (PCR or serology) and report either rate of secondary infections in children and young

people compared with adult or infection prevalence or seroprevalence in children and adolescents

separately to adults.

We excluded reports of single household/institution outbreaks; studies of hospitalised patients,

clinical studies and cohorts defined by symptoms; studies of unconfirmed cases i.e. cases based on

self-report or symptoms, including contact-tracing studies where only symptomatic contacts were

traced; modelling studies or reviews unless these reported new data ; and prevalence studies with

ascertainment based upon clinical contact and seroprevalence studies of residual sera, as these are

likely to under-represent children

Where studies were drawn from populations that overlapped, we excluded studies where the time

periods overlapped but included studies where time-periods did not overlap. We did not include in

this review seroprevalence studies only in children as these did not allow comparison with adults.

We searched two electronic databases, PubMed and the medical preprint server medRxiv on 16 May

2020 and updated this on 28 July 2020. We used the following search terms in PubMed: ("COVID-

19"[tw] OR "2019-nCoV"[tw] OR "SARS-CoV-2"[tw]) AND ((child* OR infant*) OR (“transmission”[tw]

OR "transmission" [mh]) OR ("Disease Susceptibility"[tw] OR “susceptibility”(mh)) OR

(“epidemiology”[tw] OR "epidemiology" [mh]) OR (“contact tracing”[tw] or “communicable disease

contact tracing”[mh])). In medRxiv we undertook separate searches for ‘child and covid-19’, ‘covid-

19 and epidemiology’, ‘covid-19 and susceptibility’ and ‘covid-19 transmission’ as more complex

Boolean searches are not available.

Figure 1 shows the PRISMA flow diagram .

One researcher (RV) screened studies on title and abstract to identify potentially eligible studies for

full-text review. Full text studies were then reviewed by two researchers for eligibility and data were

extracted independently by two researchers (RV and OM or CW).

We hand-searched cited

references in all potentially eligible studies for additional studies and identified additional studies

through authors’ professional networks.

Data were extracted on country, study type, study context with regards social distancing measures

and school closures at the time of the study, case definition, testing method, sampling method, and

infection rates in adults and children.

Methodological quality of included studies was assessed independently by 3 authors (OM, CW, RV)

based on a critical appraisal checklist for prevalence studies.

15

We assessed risk of bias using two

additional criteria: whether symptomatic contacts (in contact-tracing studies) or individuals

(population-screening studies) were more likely to participate than asymptomatic ones; and

whether the obtained sample was >75% of the intended sample. Studies were categorised as high

quality if they met all quality criteria and had low risk of bias on both criteria; medium if they had

low risk of bias on 1 or more criteria and met ≥5 of 7 quality criteria; low if they had met <5 quality

criteria; or Uncertain if multiple domains could not be scored.

Analysis

Contact tracing and population prevalence studies were considered separately. Random effects

meta-analysis with restricted maximum likelihood estimation was undertaken using the

meta

commands in Stata 16 (StataCorp; College Station, TX). Odds ratios were used as the primary metric

for contact tracing studies. Prevalence ratios were used as the primary metric in population-based

studies. We planned subgroup analyses using restricted maximum likelihood based upon quality of

study and age of children / adolescents.

We followed the PRISMA guidelines in reporting findings.

No funding was obtained.

Findings
The PubMed search resulted in 3465 and the medRxiv search in 10,461 studies, of which 113 and 90

respectively were examined in full text and 16 studies included (Figure 1). We identified a further 6

studies through reference-checking and 10 studies through professional networks. In total 32 studies

were included (Table 1) with quality/bias assessments shown in Appendix Table 1. Eighteen were

contact-tracing studies (CTS) (3 were school CTS), and 14 were population-screening studies. Two

were high quality, 22 medium, 7 low and one uncertain.

Contact tracing studies
Six were from mainland China, two from the USA and one each from Taiwan, Japan, South Korea,

Israel, the Netherlands, Brunei and India, with school CTS from Australia, the Ireland and Singapore.

In three of these, SAR in younger children were

12,27,28

We undertook a random effects meta-analysis of SAR in children and young people compared with

adult, with data able to be included from 14 studies. We combined data on children and young

people <20 years and adult age-groups >20 years, thus odds ratios (OR) and prevalence rates for

adults may differ from those reported in studies. The pooled OR estimate for all contact-tracing

studies of being a child with secondary infection compared with adults was 0.56 (0.37, 0.85) with

high heterogeneity (95%) (Figure 2).

In meta-analysis of 8 CTS grouped by age of child (Figure 3), the pooled OR for children <12-14 years

was 0.52 (0.33, 0.82), significantly lower than adults, whereas for adolescents this was non-

significant (OR=1.23 (0.64, 2.36). Chi-square test suggested this group difference was significant (chi-

2 =4.54, p=0.033).

When only the 8 medium/high-quality (low risk of bias) studies were examined, this finding was no

longer significant (OR 0.68 (0.41, 1.11), however the difference in estimates between low and

medium/high quality studies was not significant

(p=0.202). (see Appendix Figure 1).

We hypothesised that CTS including only household contacts might provide a clearer indication of

the relative susceptibility to infection of children versus adults because all contacts within

households might be assumed to receive a similar exposure to infection from index cases. A post-

hoc analysis by type of contacts (Appendix Figure 2) showed studies of household contacts gave a

lower pooled odds ratio (0.41 (0.22, 0.76)) than did studies of all contacts (0.91 (0.69, 1.21))

(between group variance; df=1, chi2= 5.31, p=0.021).

Three studies undertook contact-tracing in schools. A state-wide population-based CTS in

29

educational settings in Australia before and during school closures

found that 27 primary cases

(56% staff) across 25 schools or early-years nurseries resulted in 18 secondary cases in 4 settings,

including an outbreak of 13 in one early-years setting initiated by a staff member with no evidence

of child to adult transmission. The SAR was 1.2% (18/1448) overall, 5/1411=0.4% excluding the early-

years outbreak and 2.8% (18/633) in those tested. Other national CTS undertaken in schools in the

and Singapore

31

before schools closed identified very few secondary cases in

schools.

Population screening studies

differences in the populations, epidemic time-points and methodologies involved.

Examination of seroprevalence findings in children separately to adolescents (Appendix Figure 3)

adolescents, although this was not formally tested.

Discussion
We identified 37 studies from 23 countries that met our eligibility criteria and provided information

on susceptibility to and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in children and young people compared with

adults. We excluded studies and study types open to very significant bias, yet studies were

predominantly of medium and low quality, with only two high quality studies. The majority of

studies were from middle and high-income countries in East Asia and Europe.

We found preliminary evidence from 15 contact-tracing studies that children and young people have

lower susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection than adults, with a pooled odds ratio of 0.57 (0.39,

0.83). This estimate was little changed when only medium or high quality studies were examined,

although power was reduced and the confidence interval included one. Only one study

13

found a

higher odds of infection in 0-19 year olds than adults, although this finding was confined to 10-19

year olds. When studies were categorised by age of the children, lower susceptibility appeared to be

confined to younger children (less than 14 years), who had a 48% lower odds of infection compared

with adults aged ≥20 years. The age bands of the studies were not aligned making direct

comparisons challenging.

Data from population-screening studies were heterogenous and were not suitable for meta-analysis.

Findings consistent with lower seroprevalence in 0-19 year olds compared with adults were reported

by two national studies, one regional study and all of the municipal post-outbreak studies, although

confidence intervals were wide in some cases. Two virus prevalence studies similarly reported lower

infection rates in ≤20 year-olds. In contrast, other studies reported no age-related differences. No

studies reported higher prevalence in children and adolescents. Examination of seroprevalence

findings in children separately to adolescents showed that the majority of studies were consistent

with lower seroprevalence in children compared with adults, although seroprevalence in

adolescents appeared similar to adults in all studies.

The findings from the CTS and prevalence studies are largely consistent in suggesting that children

below approximately 12-14 years are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in lower

prevalence and seroprevalence than adults. Data specifically on adolescents are sparse although

consistent with susceptibility and prevalence more similar to adults. Our findings on susceptibility

are similar to a modelling analysis by Davies et al.,

46

who estimated that those under 20 years were

approximately half as susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 as adults.

We found few data that were informative on the onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from children

to others. Data from the large Australian school contact-tracing study suggest that, at a population

level, children and young people might play only a limited role in transmission of this pandemic. This

is consistent with the data on susceptibility noted above, i.e. suggesting that lower rates of

secondary infection mean that children and young people have less opportunity for onward

transmission. There is evidence of transmission from children to others in households and in schools,

and there have been reported outbreaks in schools.

31

Singapore

47,48

30

Other very small studies in Ireland

and

have found low numbers of secondary cases resulting from infected children attending

school. This is consistent with a national South Korean study, which found the SAR from children to

household members was extremely low.

13

The available studies suggest children and young people

play a lesser role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2, in marked contrast to pandemic influenza.

49

Limitations
Our study is subject to a number of limitations. We remain early in the pandemic and data continue

to evolve. It is possible that unknown factors related to age, e.g. transience of infection or waning of

immunity, bias findings in ways we don’t yet understand. Some studies were low quality and nearly

all included studies were open to bias. The secondary infection rate in some CTS was low and this

may represent an underestimate of the unmitigated household attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 as

transmission chains were cut short because of strict control measures.

50

Most of the CTS were

undertaken when strict social distancing measures had been introduced, e.g. closures of schools and

workplaces, restriction of travel. This would have reduced contacts outside the home, especially

contacts between children, but it may have increased contacts between children and adults by

increasing the household contact rate. The number of contacts nominated and traced for 0-19 year

olds was low compared with adults in some studies,

al., however findings were unchanged if these studies were included. We included two recent large

28

CTS from India

and South Korea

12

however numbers of children and data quality appeared low,

making firm conclusions difficult.

For population screening studies, the numbers of children tested was small in most of the studies,

and was frequently less than the 15-25% of the population that are < 18 years in most countries.

This likely reflects lower recruitment of children and may be a source of bias, although the direction

of this bias is unclear. Age-differentials in sensitivity of swab or antibody tests may also confound

findings. Interpreting the observed prevalence and seroprevalence studies requires thorough

quantification of social mixing and transmission between age groups and how that changed during

lockdowns and social distancing interventions.

Summary and implications
There is preliminary evidence that children under 12-14 years have lower susceptibility to SARS-CoV-

2 infection than adults, with adolescents appearing to have similar susceptibility to adults. There is

some weak evidence that children and young people play a limited role in transmission of SARS-CoV-

2 however this is not directly addressed by our study.

We remain early in our knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and further data are urgently needed, particularly

from low-income settings. These include further large, high quality contact-tracing studies with

repeated swabbing and high-quality virus-detection and seroprevalence studies. Studies which

investigate secondary infections from child or adolescent index cases in comparison to secondary

infections from adult index cases are particularly needed in order to assess transmission. Monitoring

of infection rates and contact-tracing studies within child-care and school settings will also be

important. A range of serological studies are planned in many countries and these need to be

defined as a person who did not wear
appropriate personal protection
equipment (PPE) while having face-toface contact with a confirmed case for
more than 15 minutes during the
investigation period (defined by
epidemiological investigation and
typically up to four days prior to
symptom onset or test date for
asymptomatic cases). All close contacts
were quarantined at home for 14 days
