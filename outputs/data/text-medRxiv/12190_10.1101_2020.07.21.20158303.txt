Abstract

26

We simulated epidemic projections of a potential COVID-19 outbreak in a university population

27

of 38,000 persons, under varying combinations of mass test rate (0% to 10%), contact trace and

28

test rate (0% to 50%), transmission rate (probability of transmission per contact per day), and

29

contact rate (number of contacts per person per day). We simulated four levels of transmission

30

rate, 14% (average baseline), 8% (average for face mask use), 5.4% (average for 3ft distancing),

31

and 2.5% (average for 6ft distancing and face mask use), interpolating results to the full range to

32

understand the impact of uncertainty in effectiveness, feasibility, and adherence of face mask use

33

and physical distancing. We evaluated contact rates between 1 and 25, to identify the threshold

34

that, if exceeded, could lead to several deaths.

35

When transmission rate was 8%, for trace and test at 50%, the contact rate threshold was 8.

36

However, any time delays in trace, test, and isolation quickly raised the number of deaths.

37

Keeping contact rate to 3 or below was more robust to testing delays, keeping deaths below 1 up

38

to a delay of 5 days from the time of infection to diagnosis and isolation. For a contact rate of 3,

39

the number of trace and tests peaked to about 70 per day and relaxed to 25 with the addition of

40

10% mass test. When transmission rate was 5.4%, for trace and test at 50%, the contact rate

41

threshold was 10. However, keeping contact rate to 4 or below was more robust to delays in

42

testing, keeping deaths below 1 up to a delay of 6 days from the time of infection to diagnosis

43

and isolation. For contact rate of 4, the number of trace and tests peaked at 50 per day and

44

relaxed to 10 per day with the addition of 10% mass test.

45

Threshold estimates can help develop on-campus scheduling and indoor-spacing plans in

46

conjunction with plans for asymptomatic testing for COVID-19. Combination thresholds should

47

be selected specific to the setting based on an assessment of the feasibility and resource

48

availability for testing and quarantine.

Introduction

50

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused significant disease and

51

economic burdens since its first outbreak in December 2019. In the absence of an effective

52

vaccine, the main intervention for the prevention of COVID-19 transmissions has been social

53

distancing. The most effective social distancing being lockdowns of non-essential organizations

54

and services, as adopted by several states since March, 2020, in efforts to immediately slow

55

down the pandemic [1]. However, lockdowns are a huge threat to the economic stability of a

56

nation as seen by the unprecedented rise in unemployment rates [2] [3]. Therefore, while

57

lockdowns are a good short-term strategy, for a long-term strategy or until a vaccine becomes

58

widely available, it has become necessary to identify alternate strategies and lifestyles that

59

control the disease burden while minimizing the economic burden. Interventions that are

60

effective include the use of face masks, physical distancing between persons at a recommended

61

6ft, and contact tracing and testing or mass testing to enable early diagnosis in the asymptomatic

62

stage of infection [4]. However, removal of lockdowns should be strictly accompanied by a

63

reopening plan that rapidly and efficiently enables the adoption of the above interventions, to

64

avoid an epidemic rebound. In addition to public health agencies, all members of a community,

65

in both public and private sectors, play a key role in the development and implementation of a

66

reopening plan that is most suited for their organization [5]. Among these sectors, universities

67

and colleges bear a special burden to develop a reopening plan that include changes to a range of

68

activities related to teaching, research, dining, housing, and extra-curricular activities [6].

69
70

We developed a compartmental differential equations model to simulate epidemic projections of

71

a potential COVID-19 outbreak in a population of 38,000 individuals representative of

72

undergraduate and graduate students, faculty and staff in a residential university in the United

73

States. We simulated epidemic projections, of potential outbreaks, under varying combinations

74

of contact tracing and testing and mass testing, to identify combinations that would reduce the

75

effective reproduction number 𝑅𝑅𝑒𝑒 to a value below the epidemic threshold of 1. 𝑅𝑅𝑒𝑒 is directly

76

proportional to the duration of infectiousness, transmission rate (the probability of transmission

77

per contact per day, representing the infectiousness of the virus), and contact rate (the number of

78

contacts per person per day) [7]. Trace and test and universal mass test lead to early diagnosis in

79

the asymptomatic phase of the infection and, if persons diagnosed with infection are successfully

80

quarantined, they reduce the duration of exposed infectiousness [8] [9] [10] and thus reduce 𝑅𝑅𝑒𝑒 .

81

Physical distancing by the recommended 6ft and use of face masks can reduce transmission rate,

83

and thus reduce 𝑅𝑅𝑒𝑒 [11] [12]. Reducing contact rate directly reduces 𝑅𝑅𝑒𝑒 , however, the expected

84

dining, research labs, and offices.

82

contact rates are dependent on the planned facility layout and scheduling of classrooms, housing,

85
86

While COVID-19 simulation models have typically used a product of transmission rate and

87

contact rate as one metric, we evaluate these separately, as it could help inform scheduling and

88

facility layout decisions. While physical distancing by the recommended 6ft and use of face

89

masks can reduce transmission rate, there is considerable uncertainty in the expected reduction,

90

with studies showing that it is likely to be less than 100% even if used properly [11] [12] [13]

91

[14] . That is, a person who is at a six feet distance is also a contact for potential transmission,

92

although the transmission rate (per contact) would be low. Therefore, if not properly planned, the

93

movement of students between multiple indoor locations, such as shared student housing or

94

dorms, classrooms, dining halls, and shared research lab and office spaces, could create a high

95

contact rate, even in the absence of large social gatherings. This can be further exacerbated by

96

the ease of transmission of the virus. While it is known that indoor gatherings such as events,

97

bars, and restaurants have contributed to a significant portion of the cases [9] [15] [16] [17], its

98

attribution to confined spaces and transmission through droplets alone has been shifting.

99

Specifically, there is growing consensus among researchers that the mode of virus transmissions

100

not only include air droplets (typically created during heavy breathing such as singing or

101

exercising) and to some degree environmental (surfaces of items), but also aerosols, i.e., even

102

normal nasal breathing and talking can transmit the virus, and thus a physical distancing of 6ft

103

alone maybe insufficient [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22]. While controlling ventilation through

104

proper air flow and use of filters, mandating both face masks and 6ft distancing, and regular

105

cleaning and hygiene can reduce transmissions, its feasibility and compliance at all times are less

106

certain. Under this context of less than 100% effectiveness, feasibility, and compliance of

107

physical distancing and face masks, while it is clear that high contact rates should be avoided, the

108

impact of combinations of contact rates and transmission rate (the latter defining the level of

109

physical distancing and face mask use) on epidemic growth under the varying levels of testing,

110

have not been evaluated.

111
112

For the reopening of United States, many organizations follow the guidance from the

113

government to understand when to lift intervention policies. On April 16, 2020, the White House

114

released the plan for a phased reopening of the United States [23] [24]. In this plan, educational

115

institutions in the U.S. such as schools and universities can reopen in Phase Two. Phase Two

116

reopening for any state is met if there is no evidence of a rebound and the statesatisfies certain

117

gating criteria (such as downward trajectory of influenza like illness (ILI), documented cases,

118

treatment of all patients under crisis care, among others) a second time. The first time, the gating

119

criteria need to be satisfied before the reopening of Phase One. In the literature, there are several

120

studies that have examined the impact of school closures and stay at home policies. In the past,

121

some of these studies examined the impact of policies during the H1N1 pandemic [25] [26].

122

However, these studies targeted closure of schools or several classes in a school for certain

123

periods of time and do not explore partial re-opening or closure [25] [26] [27]. In more recent

124

times, a Johns Hopkins study provided an ethical framework for the COVID-19 reopening

125

process [28]. This framework is intended for policy makers on the state level to develop plans for

126

reopening of their state. In the framework, they highlight the long-term closure of schools can

127

have a detrimental effect on children but warns policy makers to not shy away from re-imposing

128

social distancing measures if hospitalizations or cases cross over a benchmark. A literature

129

review on school closure policies states that policy makers need to strongly consider

130

combinations of social distancing policies when planning to reopen [29]. One study examined

131

the impact of social distancing, contact tracing and household quarantine in a Boston

132

metropolitan area [30]. They tested the effectiveness of these policies to avoid a second wave of

133

the pandemic using a granular agent-based model. In our search, we found only one study that

134

researched the impact of school closure policies during the COVID-19 pandemic for K-12

135

schools [31]. In this study, the authors study the impact of partial, complete and progressive

136

reopening of schools. They also study social distancing interventions, testing, and isolation, and

137

estimate hospital bed capacity needs if schools were to be reopened.

138
139

While it is generally known that increasing contact tracing and testing is necessary, studies

140

directly observing the number of tests needed at an organizational level, such as university, are

141

only recently emerging. One study analyzing combination interventions, in generalized

142

populations, that include contact tracing estimated that reducing 𝑅𝑅0 of 1.5 to an 𝑅𝑅𝑒𝑒 of 1 requires

144

more than 20% of contact tracing [32]. For an 𝑅𝑅0 of 2.5, at least 80% of contact tracing and for

145

an 𝑅𝑅0 of 3.5, more than 100% of contact tracing. A modeling study applied to the Boston area
[30] estimated that the best way out scenario is a Lift and Enhanced Testing (LET) with 50%

146

detection and 40% tracing. According to this, the number of individuals that need to be traced

147

per 1000 persons is below 0.1 under partial reopening and below 0.15 under total reopening.

148

Models for a university are only recently emerging, [33] [34] [35] [36] but none have, thus far,

149

explicitly evaluated the combinations of contact rate and transmission rate.

143

150
151

In this work, we evaluate different combinations of trace and test rate, mass test rate, and

152

transmission rate, for a range of contact rates, to identify the threshold contact rate that if

153

exceeded can lead to several deaths. We also identify the number of trace and tests, quarantines,

154

hospitalizations, and deaths under each intervention combination. These metrics could

155

collectively help inform development of a preparedness plan for reopening of a University.

156

Contact rates can help plan indoor spacing and personnel scheduling of classrooms, labs and

157

office spaces, housing, and dining. Though off-campus contact rates cannot be controlled, an

158

understanding of the threshold contact rates can help eliminate indoor planning scenarios that

159

most certainly lead to an epidemic. The threshold contact rates can only help in elimination and

160

should not be used as a metric for selection of a strategy. Selection of a scenario should be done

161

after a feasibility assessment. The estimates for number of tests and quarantines, along with the

162

uncertainty in the transmission rates, under each scenario, could help in the feasibility

163

assessment, based on the resource needs such as personnel, equipment, and infrastructure, and

Input data assumptions and sources for simulation model

281

We used natural disease progression estimates from other studies in the literature. The

282

description of the data, sources, and values (with ranges and medians where applicable) for all

283

parameters are available in the Supplemental Appendix. Briefly, we assumed an incubation

284

period duration of 5.4 days [37], the first 2.5 days in stage L (not infectious and asymptomatic)

285

[38], and the remaining in stage E (infectious and asymptomatic). We assumed about 65% of

286

cases develop medium to severe symptoms [37] [39] [40] and, in the absence of test and trace or

287

mass test, can be diagnosed through symptom-based testing. We assumed the remaining 35% of

288

cases show mild to no symptoms and can be diagnosed only through trace and test, or universal

290

hospitalization [41], with the proportion hospitalized varying as a function of age. For mild

291

cases, we assumed an average duration of 7 days from the time of onset of symptoms to recovery

292

[41]. We assumed case fatality rates vary as a function of age and gender.

294

Interventions

295

We evaluated mass testing at 5% and 10% of the population. We assumed a maximum contact

296

tracing rate of 50%, modeling the rate as the inverse of the time to find, test, and isolate infected

297

contacts from the time of their infection. To test the sensitivity of delays associated with trace

298

and/or test, we evaluated trace and test rates of 10%, 17%, 20%, 25%, 33%, and 50%, equivalent

299

of 10, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2 days, respectively, from time of infection to effective isolation. We

300

assumed trace and test would initiate within the first 5 cases of diagnosis. To test the sensitivity

301

of delays in initiation of trace and test, we also evaluated scenarios by delaying the initiating of

302

trace and test to after diagnoses of 20 cases. We evaluated transmission rates (𝑝𝑝) of 14%

303
304

(baseline), 8% (mid), 5.4% (lower-mid), and 2.5% (lowest). The baseline value of 𝑝𝑝 corresponds

305

rate of 8% relative to baseline corresponds to expected relative risk under use of face masks in

306

non-health care settings [12]. Transmission rates of 5.4% and 2.5% correspond to expected rates

307

under 3ft and 6ft physical distancing, respectively [12]. We evaluated contact rates between 1

308

and 25 (𝑐𝑐), we did not separate between on-campus and off-campus contact rates. In all

309

scenarios, we applied baseline symptom-based testing and 14-day quarantine for diagnosed

310

persons. For diagnosis in asymptomatic stages, we assumed a test sensitivity of 0.9 for trace and

test and universal (mass) testing [43].

Application to a university setting

313

Demographic data: We used the Fall 2018 student enrollment data from the University of

314

Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, MA, to determine the population size of undergraduate and

315

graduate students and their age and gender distributions [44]. For faculty and staff, we used the

316

age distribution of persons 25 years and older from the Town of Amherst, MA, where the

317

university is located [45]. To initiate an outbreak, we assumed 4 to 5 infected cases on day 1

318

based on the following. We assumed that the proportion of incoming students who are infected

319

would be equal to the prevalence of Massachusetts. We also assumed that all incoming students

320

would be tested, and about 10% of infected cases would be false negatives. Prevalence is

321

unknown, as not all cases are diagnosed and diagnosed cases are not specifically tracked.

322

Therefore, to estimate prevalence of COVID-19 in MA, we used the simulation model to

323

determine the ratio of new diagnosis to persons with infection and applied that ratio to the

324

number of new diagnoses on June 26th in MA. This resulted in about 5 infected cases on day 1

325

remaining undetected, thus initiating an outbreak. We also assumed that at the beginning of

326

every week, there would be about 3 to 4 infections from outside, calculated by assuming that

327

about 10% of the population are likely to mix with the population outside the university or travel

328

out of Amherst during weekends and are not tested upon return. Based on the above, we

329

initialized the model on Day 1 with 4 to 5 infected persons in the Latent stage and added 3 to 4

330

outside cases to the Latent state at the beginning of every week. We simulated the model for a

331

90-day period to represent the duration of the expected Fall semester.

Results

333

The contact rate thresholds, which represent the values that, if exceeded, lead to greater than 1

334

death, under varying combinations of transmission rate, trace and test, and universal test are

335

presented in Figure 2. Figure 2 also shows interpolated values of contact rate thresholds (dotted

336

line) for the full range of transmission rates.

337
338

When transmission rate was 14%, with only 10% mass test, the contact rate threshold was 1

339

(Figure 2A). With 50% trace and test, equivalent to finding and isolating contacts within 2 days

340

of infection, the contact rate threshold was 4 (Figure 2A). With 10% (and 33%) trace and test,

341

equivalent to 10 (and 3) days to find and isolate infected contacts from the time of their infection,

342

the contact rate threshold was 1 (and 3) (Figure 2B). Delays in initiating trace and test to after

343

diagnoses of 20 cases also reduced the contact rate threshold to 2 (Figures 2C). Delays in

344

initiating trace and test to after diagnoses of 20 cases, and trace and test rates of 33% and lower

345

(equivalent to more than 2 days to find and isolate infected contacts from the time of their

346

infection) reduced the contact rate threshold to 1 (Figure 2D). With maximum testing of 10%

347

mass test, 50% trace and test, and initiating trace and test within 5 cases of diagnoses, the

348

threshold contact rate was 7 (Figure 2A).

349
350

When transmission rate was 8%, with only symptom-based test, only 10% mass test, or only

351

50% trace and test, the contact rate thresholds were 1, 3, and 8, respectively (Figure 2A). With

352

both 10% mass test and 50% trace and test, the contact rate threshold was 12 (Figure 2A). With

353

10% (and 33%) trace and test, equivalent to 10 (and 3) days to find and isolate infected contacts

354

from the time of their infection, the contact rate threshold was 2 (and 6) (Figure 2B). Delays in

355

initiating trace and test to after diagnoses of 20 cases, and trace and test rates of 33% and lower

356

(equivalent to more than 2 days to find and isolate contacts from the time of their infection),

357

reduced the contact rate threshold to between 2 and 3 (Figure 2D).

358
359

When transmission rate was 5.4%, with only symptom-based testing, only 10% mass test, or only

360

50% trace and test, the contact rate threshold were 2, 4, and 12, respectively (Figure 2A). With

361

both 10% mass test and 50% trace and test, the contact rate threshold was 18 (Figure 2A). With

362

10% (and 33%) trace and test, equivalent to 10 (and 3) days to find and isolate infected contacts

363

from the time of their infection, the contact rate threshold was 4 (and 9) (Figure 2B). Delays in

364

initiating trace and test to after diagnoses of 20 cases, and trace and test rates of 33% and lower

365

(equivalent to more than 2 days to find and isolate contacts from the time of their infection),

366

reduced the contact rate thresholds to between 3 and 5 (Figure 2D).

367
368

When transmission rate was 2.5%, with only symptom-based test, or only 10% mass test, the

369

threshold contact rates were 5, and 9, respectively (Figure 2A). With 50% trace and test the

370

epidemic was under control up until a contact rate of 25. Delays in initiating trace and test to

371

after diagnoses of 20 cases, and trace and test rates of 33% and lower (equivalent to more than 2

372

days to find and isolate contacts from the time of their infection), reduced the contact rate

373

threshold to between 5 and 12 (Figure 2D).

374
375

The number of deaths under varying combinations of universal mass test, trace and test,

376

transmission rate, and contact rate are presented in Figures S1 and S2 of the Appendix. All

377

scenarios with less than 1 death are also presented in the Appendix Figures S1 and S2.

378

For all scenarios with 50% trace and test that resulted in less than 1 death, Figure 3 presents the

379

total number of trace and tests over the duration of the semester, the peak number of trace and

380

tests per day, and the peak number quarantined (excluding false positives), interpolated over the

381

transmission rate range. Both metrics increased as contact rate increased, and decreased with the

382

addition of universal testing, as expected. When contact rate was 5 and transmission rate was

383

below 5.4%, total trace and tests varied from about 200 (trace and test + 10% mass test) to 300

384

(trace and test only), and the peak trace and tests per day varied from about 15 (50% trace and

385

test + 10% mass test) to 30 (50% trace and test only). For combinations of contact rate above 5

386

and transmission rate above 5.4%, the peak number of trace and tests per day rise quickly, e.g.,

387

reaching 60 and 80 when contact rate was 6 and 7, respectively, and transmission rate was 8%.

388
389

Delay in initiating trace and test to after diagnosis of 20 cases, would increase the peak number

390

of trace and tests or increase deaths (Figure 4). When contact rate was 5 and the transmission rate

391

was below 5.4%, total trace and tests varied from about 180 (50% trace and test + 10% mass test)

392

to 400 (50% trace and test), and the peak trace and tests per day varied from about 20 (50% trace

393

and test + 10% mass test) to 85 (50% trace and test). For combinations of transmission rate

394

above 5.4% and contact rate above 5, the number of trace and tests per day peak above 50 and

395

rise rapidly, e.g., reaching 200 and 230 (50% trace and test) when contact rate was 6 and 7,

396

respectively, and transmission rate was 8% (not shown in Figure). These two scenarios also

397

generated 2 deaths. Adding 10% mass test reduces deaths to below 1, while also relaxing the

398

peak trace and tests to 45 and 60 when contact rate was 6 and 7, respectively.

400

For scenarios with 50% trace and test, transmission rate below 5.4%, and contact rate at 5 or

401

below, the peak quarantines per day (excluding false positives), went up to 25 if trace and test

402

initiated within diagnosis of 5 cases (Figure 3), and up to 60 if delay in initiating trace and test to

403

after diagnosis of 20 cases (Figure 4). As test specificity ranges from 96.5% and 99% [43], we

404

can expect the number of quarantines peaking at a higher value because of false positives,

405

especially with mass testing. Though we did not explicitly model false positives in the

406

simulation, we can estimate a lower bound, as the product of the number of mass tests per day

407

and false positivity rate, plus the additional false positives generated through tracing of the false

408

positives using the contact rate in each scenario. And multiplying the result by 14 to estimate the

409

expected number of quarantines per day. Among scenarios with 10% mass test (about 3800 tests

410

per day), for a test specificity of 99%, the number of quarantines per day range from 530 to 700.

411

Among scenarios with 5% mass test (about 2000 tests per day), for a test specificity of 99%, the

412

number of quarantines ranged from 280 to 370 per day.

413
414

Figure 5 presents the proportion of testing scenarios (across varying levels of mass test, trace and

415

test, and delays in trace and test initiation) that meet the contact rate thresholds. When

416

transmission rate was 8%, about 60% of scenarios had contact rate threshold of 3 or higher, and

417

when transmission rate was 5.4%, about 73% of scenarios had contact rate threshold of 4 or

418

higher. Specifically, when transmission rate was 8%, a contact rate of 3 kept deaths below 1 if

419

trace and test rates were 20% or above (equivalent to finding and isolating infected contacts

420

within 5 days from the time of their infection), even with a delay in initiating trace and test to

421

after diagnosis of 20 cases (Appendix Figures S3 and S4). When transmission rate was 5.4%, a

422

contact rate of 4 kept deaths below 1 if trace and test rates were 17% or above (equivalent to

these scenarios, the number of trace and tests peaked to between 20 and 70 when contact rate

434

rate (physical distancing and face mask use), the contact rate thresholds, which if exceeded, lead

435

to rapid growth of the epidemic causing multiple deaths. It also estimates, under varying

436

combinations of mass test, trace and test, transmission rate, and contact rate, the number of trace

437

and tests, quarantines, hospitalizations, and deaths.

438
439

It is difficult to determine how the threshold contact rate estimates compare to those expected at

440

a university, as the data on contact rates prior to the COVID-19 outbreak are unavailable. One

441

study, conducted prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, estimated an average rate of 21 among

442

middle-aged adults in Portland, Oregon [46], however, contact rates in a university are likely to

443

be different. After the COVID-19 outbreak, more studies to estimate contact rates are emerging,

444

however, they are under the context of state-issued stay-at-home orders, and thus are

445

representative of the lower bounds. In one such poll [47] of U.S. adults, those who self-asses

446

their status as ‘completely isolated’ (about 27%) reported a median (and mean) non-household

447

contact rate of 0 (and 1.5), those who self-asses their status as ‘mostly isolated’ (about 47%),

448

reported a median (and mean) non-household contact rate of 2 (and 5.4), and those who self-

449

asses their status as ‘partially isolated’ (about 17%), reported a median and mean non-household

450

contact rate of 2 (and 5.4). Among those listing their work sector as ‘education’ (which included

451

library and training services), reported a median (and mean) work contact rate of 1 (and 2.6).

452

Another study [48] reported a median (and mean) contact rate of 2 (and 2.7) among a nationally

453

representative survey of the US population, with 85% of surveyors reporting four or fewer

454

contacts. The above studies were under maximum lockdowns, and thus, how these would change

455

upon reopening, and specifically at a university, are unknown, but can be expected to be higher

456

thus requiring careful control.

457
458

Another challenge in relating these threshold contact rates to that expected at a university arises

459

from the uncertainty in what defines a ‘contact’. In the above studies, the term contact rate has

460

varied definitions, such as the number of people who are < 6ft away from a person, the number

461

of people touched by another person, or the number of people with who a person has face to face

462

conversations. For epidemic spread, a contact is defined as any contact that exposes one to the

463

infection. Under the context of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the above definitions are insufficient as

464

aerosol and environmental (surfaces) modes of transmission do not require one to be in direct

465

contact [49] [50] [51] [52]. On the other hand, use of face masks, physical distancing, and

466

sanitizing and cleaning, due to mandated policies or increased awareness, could reduce the

467

exposure from those in the vicinity [17] [19] [20] [21] [22]. Current definitions for contact

468

combine the two.

469

Given the above challenges, in this study we attempted to separate out contact rates from

470

transmission rates. Considering the uncertainty in the baseline transmission rate, and in the

471

expected reductions from face mask use and physical distancing [12], uncertainties rising from

472

inherent features, feasibility, and compliance, we interpolated results for the full range of

473

transmission rate. The transmission rates simulated here cover the range of estimates from the

474

literature for baseline 14% (11.6%-17%), and expected reductions from use of surgical or cloth

475

face masks in non-health care settings 7.8% (5.6%-11.1%), 3ft physical distancing 6.9% (3.6%-

476

13%), and 6ft physical distancing 2.8%(1.4%-5.7%), calculated using relative risks from a meta-

477

analysis study that, in addition to SARS-CoV-2, evaluated viruses of similarly high virulence

478

[12] (see Supplemental Appendix Table S2).

479
480

The contact rate thresholds in this study can help inform decisions related to planning of indoor

481

spacing and personnel scheduling, by eliminating scenarios that generate contact rates that cross

482

the threshold. However, the selection of contact rates should be considered in conjunction with

483

testing rates and transmission rates. The contact rate thresholds were low when trace and test

484

rates were low or transmission rates were higher than 5.4%. Though the contact rate thresholds

485

under low transmission rates and 50% trace and test were higher, going above 5, the feasibility of

486

finding, testing, and isolating infected contacts within 2 days of infection (50% trace and test)

487

should be evaluated specific to the setting of implementation. When transmission rate was 5.4%

488

or below and contact rate was higher than 5, any delays in trace and test generated rapid

489

accumulation of the number of persons to trace and test with the peak numbers per day going

490

above 50, and eventually leading to several deaths if testing delays continued. When

491

transmission rate was 5.4%, a contact rate threshold of 4 was more robust to testing delays, and

492

when transmission rate was 8%, a contact rate threshold of 3 was more robust to these testing

493

delays.

494
495

In addition to contact rate thresholds, the resource availabilities for testing and quarantining,

496

should be considered in selection of a strategy. Addition of mass test to trace and test generally

497

had a significant reduction in the peak number of trace and tests. In comparing between choice of

498

mass tests or trace and tests, the trade-offs are between high false positives requiring more

499

resources for quarantining in mass test versus low quarantine resource needs but high tracing

500

resource needs for trace and test. Availability of resources for trace and test versus quarantine

501

should be evaluated specific to the setting.

502
503

Our work is subject to limitations. Our model is deterministic. We did not specifically model

504

false positives hence, the estimates here only provide a lower bound. We used an average contact

505

rate for all persons, in order to help decisions related to designing a controlled environment, such

506

as controlling workplace scheduling and layouts and issuing uniform guidelines. We did not

507

model contact rates to be representative of actual expected behaviors of individuals or to be

508

representative of actual expected networks between individuals. We did not explicitly model

509

other interventions that could reduce transmission rate such as controlled ventilation, filtering air

510

and controlling air flow, which are likely to impact transmissions [53]. The transmission rates

511

evaluated should be used with caution. The baseline estimate of 14% is an average estimate, and

512

the estimates for face masks and physical distancing are relative to these estimates. For a

513

different baseline transmission rate, the interpolated values of transmission rates should be used

514

to determine expected reduction. We did not model other flu like illnesses and thus we did not

515

assess the additional healthcare resource needs such as testing and quarantining because of

516

similarity in symptoms with COVID-19.

517
518

Despite these limitations, the results from this work could collectively help inform development

519

of a preparedness plan for reopening of a University. Contact rates can help plan indoor spacing

520

and personnel scheduling of classrooms, labs and office spaces, housing, and dining. The

521

estimates for the number of tests and quarantines, presented here under each scenario, can help

522

determine the resource needs such as personnel, equipment, and infrastructure. Though off-

523

campus contact rates cannot be controlled, estimates of threshold contact rates can help eliminate

524

indoor spacing and personnel scheduling scenarios that exceed these contact rate thresholds that

525

have a high chance of an epidemic. The threshold contact rates can only help in elimination of

526

strategies and should not be used as a metric for selection of a strategy. The uncertainty ranges in

527

results suggest that selection of a strategy should collectively consider indoor spacing, personnel

528

scheduling, testing, and quarantining. Selection of a scenario should be done after a feasibility

529

assessment that compares resource needs under each scenario to excepted resource availability

530

for testing and quarantining, and risk assessment to determine the ability to control transmission

531

rate through use of face masks and physical distancing, including its feasibility and compliance.
