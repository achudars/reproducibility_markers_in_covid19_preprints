Significance:
In this retrospective observational evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine response defined
by detectable levels of immunoglobulin-G against the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit
of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen of ≥2 in serum of patients receiving maintenance dialysis,
165/186 (88.7%) were found to be seropositive (with 70% at maximum titer) at least 14 days
after completing the second dose. No significant differences were observed by race or other
subgroup or by vaccine manufacturer. Therefore, an equitable and aggressive vaccination
strategy for all eligible maintenance dialysis patients, regardless of age, sex, race, ethnicity, or
disability, is warranted to prevent the extremely high morbidity and mortality associated with
COVID-19 in this high risk population.

Abstract
Background: Patients receiving maintenance dialysis represent a high risk, immunecompromised population with 15-25% COVID mortality rate who were unrepresented in clinical
trials evaluated for mRNA vaccines’ emergency use authorization.
Method: All patients receiving maintenance dialysis that received two doses of SARS-CoV-2
mRNA vaccines with antibody test results drawn ≥14 days after the second dose, as documented
in the electronic health record through March 18, 2021 were included. We report seroresponse
based on levels of immunoglobulin-G against the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of
SARS-CoV-2

spike

antigen

(seropositive

≥2)

using

FDA-approved

semi-quantitative

chemiluminescent assay (ADVIA Centaur® XP/XPT COV2G).
Results: Among 186 dialysis patients from 32 clinics in 8 states tested 23±8 days after receiving
2 vaccine doses, mean age was 68±12 years, with 47% women, 21% Black, 26% residents in
long-term care facilities and 97% undergoing in-center hemodialysis. Overall seropositive rate
was 165/186 (88.7%) with 70% at maximum titer and with no significant difference in seropositivity
between BNT162b2/Pfizer (N=148) and mRNA-1273/Moderna (N=18) vaccines (88.1% vs.
94.4%, p=0.42). Among patients with COVID-19 history, seropositive rate was 38/38 (100%) with
97% at maximum titer.
Conclusion: Most patients receiving maintenance dialysis were seropositive after two doses of
BNT162b2/Pfizer or mRNA-1273/Moderna vaccine. Early evidence suggests that vaccinated
dialysis patients with prior COVID-19 develop robust antibody response. These results support
an equitable and aggressive vaccination strategy for eligible dialysis patients, regardless of age,
sex, race, ethnicity, or disability, to prevent the extremely high morbidity and mortality associated
with COVID-19 in this high risk population.

Nearly 550,000 people in the United States (US) receive maintenance dialysis and prevalence
estimates approach 3 million worldwide.1,2 Patients receiving maintenance dialysis (henceforth
“dialysis patients”), particularly those receiving hemodialysis, comprise a population of vulnerable
individuals who cannot self-isolate, have a high incidence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and have Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)associated mortality of 15 to 25%,3-5 making effective vaccination a priority. Despite this
heightened risk and prior reports of diminished response to vaccines versus other viruses such
as hepatitis-B and influenza,6-8 the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among dialysis
patients is unknown due to insufficient trial data. Accordingly, we performed a quality improvement
evaluation of multiple Dialysis Clinic, Inc. (DCI) dialysis clinics in the US assessing antibody
response following administration of SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines.

Methods
Study Setting
DCI implemented a standard clinical protocol for systematic measurement of SARS-CoV-2 spikeantibody immunoglobulin-G (SAb-IgG) that physicians could activate for vaccination in the
outpatient dialysis clinic, similar to that for hepatitis-B post-vaccination testing. 6 As access to the
SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines for dialysis patients varied among and within states, they were
obtained from nursing homes, hospitals, locally designated centers and pharmacies, and only in
few dialysis clinics. Individual physicians ordered post-vaccination SAb-IgG titers based on patient
accessibility and clinical interest. All vaccinations were verified and recorded in the DCI electronic
health record (EHR). This interim report includes a retrospective evaluation of all patients
receiving 2 doses of either BNT162b2/Pfizer or mRNA-1273/Moderna vaccine per manufacturer’s
recommendation across 32 DCI clinics in 8 states with SAb-IgG measured ≥14 days after the
second dose, documented as of March 18, 2021.

SARS-CoV-2 Spike Antibody Assay
DCI Lab measured SAb-IgG against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of
SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen using US-FDA-approved chemiluminescent assay (ADVIA Centaur®
XP/XPT COV2G).9, 10 This semi-quantitative assay has a range between 0 and ≥20, with a positive
threshold of ≥2. S1-RBD-antibodies are relevant to vaccines incorporating this immune-dominant
region to elicit neutralizing (and therefore likely protective) antibodies in vaccinated individuals. 11

Electronic Health Record
Vaccination dates, SAb-IgG results, demographic and clinical data including age, sex,
race/ethnicity, body mass index, dialysis parameters (i.e. vintage, modality, access, adequacy),
albumin, number and types of comorbidities, use of immunomodulatory agents, history of
transplantation or COVID-19 diagnosis, and other vaccines administered or hospitalization within
14 days of vaccination were obtained from the DCI-EHR. This retrospective evaluation is a DCI
quality improvement evaluation under Western Institutional Review Board (WIRB) exemption.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS v9.4.

Results
Among 186 dialysis patients receiving 2 doses of vaccine, mean age was 68±12 years, with 47%
women, 21% Black, 26% residents in long-term care facilities and 97% undergoing in-center
hemodialysis (Table 1). SAb-IgG was positive (≥2) in 165/186 (88.7%) with no significant
difference between BNT162b2/Pfizer (N=148) and mRNA-1273/Moderna (N=18) vaccines
(88.1% vs. 94.4%, p=0.42). The distribution of titer levels drawn over 23±8 days after the 2nd dose
is shown in Figure 1. Non-responders had mean SAb-IgG titer of 0.4±0.2 vs. 18.2±4.3 among
responders (p<0.0001).

Among 148 patients without known COVID-19, 127 (85.8%) were seropositive following
vaccination. All 38 patients with COVID-19 diagnosis were seropositive, irrespective of vaccine
type, with 37/38 at maximum limit of the assay. In 36 patients, COVID-19 diagnosis occurred
181±118 days prior to completing vaccination. The remaining two patients were long-term care
facility residents each exposed to a roommate, and were tested while asymptomatic at 1 and 5
days after their second vaccine dose, respectively (with SAb-IgG titers obtained 20 days and 23
days after vaccination, respectively). Upon review, the latter patient had recent gastrointestinal
upset and constipation but neither was hospitalized.

Seroresponse occurred in 73 of 88 women versus 92 of 98 men (83% vs. 94%, p=0.02). Results
of univariate analysis are indicated in Table 1. Non-responders were newer to dialysis and more
likely to have other vaccines administered or be hospitalized within 14 days of SARS-CoV-2
vaccination, have potential immunosuppressed state related to immune-modulating drugs, prior
transplant, and/or immune-deficiency disorders, and congestive heart failure (CHF). A summary
of the clinical characteristics of non-responders is provided in Table 2.

Discussion
Among maintenance dialysis patients in the US, 88.7% achieved SAb-IgG >2, measured ≥14
days after two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. Near universal seroconversion rates
occurred in clinical trials utilized for these vaccines’ emergency use authorization, but notably did
not include patients on dialysis. Lower seroconversion rate was not unexpected, given the
widespread immune dysfunction observed in dialysis-dependent patients. These immune
alterations included skewed Th1/Th2 responses, impaired function of the professional antigen
presenting cells (APC), and susceptibility of B-cells to apoptosis.12 The combined deficits in Tcell, APC and B-cell functions render dialysis patients less likely to both seroconvert and maintain

protective titers over time compared to individuals without kidney disease,13 previously observed
with pneumococcal, hepatitis-B and H1N1 influenza vaccines.7,8,14

Factors associated with poor seroconversion in our cohort include female sex, younger vintage,
potential immunosuppression from diseases, transplant or medications, CHF and co-vaccination
and hospitalization during the peri-vaccination period. A recent meta-analysis suggests women
receiving dialysis respond to vaccines equally to men, although differences in seroconversion
rates by sex were noted in some hepatitis-B series.7 However, we caution that some of these
associations, including that for women, may not be sustained as we accumulate more data. Of
note, potential immunosuppressed states and acute hospitalization during the vaccine series have
face validity to impact immune response, particularly in the setting of uremic inflammation. 7,12,15

Considering the devastating impact of COVID-19 on dialysis patients compared to the potentially
dramatic benefit of vaccination on severity of illness,3-5 it is imperative to explore strategies to
monitor and maximize seroconversion. Such knowledge may be useful for patient education and
dialogue to reinforce preventive measures. Strategies to improve seroconversion may include
additional or higher vaccine doses. Monitoring longitudinal SAb-IgG could inform potential use of
booster doses, similar to algorithms used for hepatitis-B vaccination. Such tracking is a
component of the quality program at DCI and will be critical in informing the development of
alternative vaccination regimens.

A strength of the current report is coverage of multiple areas of the country with a diverse dialysis
population. Although limited by small sample size, the data appear sufficient to emphasize that
seroconversion should be expected for the majority of maintenance dialysis patients. Additional
limitations include an observational design that may have led to residual confounding and
selection biases, heavily influenced by accessibility and availability of vaccines. Future studies

could also evaluate T-cell responses given that specific clinical implications of serology tests
including the SAb-IgG we utilized, need further elucidation.

In conclusion, the vast majority of maintenance dialysis patients responded with IgG spike
antibody titers to a complete series of both SARS-CoV-2 mRNA BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273
vaccines. Further study is needed to determine duration of the seroprotection as well as the ideal
approach to non-responders, including whether they should receive a booster dose. Early
evidence suggests that vaccinated dialysis patients with prior COVID-19 develop robust antibody
response. Our findings support an equitable and aggressive vaccination strategy for all eligible
maintenance dialysis patients regardless of age, sex, race, ethnicity, or disability, to prevent the
extremely high morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 in this high risk population.
