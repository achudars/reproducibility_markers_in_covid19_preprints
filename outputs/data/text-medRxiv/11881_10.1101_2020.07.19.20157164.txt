Key Points​:​ ​Mental Health, Covid-19, Bayesian Network, Machine Learning
Question​: ​What factors could affect mental health, and how could this level be predicted using
the same factors during the of COVID-19?
Finding: ​In this survey-data based study, multiple factors such as ​Social isolation, digital
communication, working, and schooling from home, were identified as crucial factors of mental
illness during Covid-19. Interestingly, behavioral changes such as wearing a mask and avoiding
restaurants and public places were not found to be associated with mental health.
Meaning: ​Regular non-virtual communication with friends and family, healthy social life and
social security are key factors and especially taking care of people with mental disease history is
even more important.

Abstract:
Importance​: COVID-19 pandemic has deeply affected the health, economic, and social fabric of
nations. Identification of individual-level susceptibility factors may help people in identifying
and managing their emotional, psychological, and social well-being.
Objective: This work is focused on learning a ranked list of factors that could indicate a
predisposition to a mental disorder during the COVID pandemic.
Data Sources and Study design: In this study, We have used a survey of 17764 adults in the
USA at different age groups, genders, and socioeconomic statuses.
Methods: ​Through initial statistical analysis followed by Bayesian Network inference, we have
identified key factors affecting Mental health during the COVID pandemic. Integrating
Bayesian networks with classical machine learning approaches lead to effective modeling of the
level of mental health.
Results: ​Overall, females are more stressed than males, and people of age-group 18-29 are more
vulnerable to anxiety than other age groups. Using the Bayesian Network Model, we found that
people with chronic medical condition of mental illness are more prone to mental disorders
during the COVID age. The new realities of working from home, home-schooling, and lack of
communication with family/friends/neighbors induces mental pressure. Financial assistance from
social security helps in reducing mental stress during COVID generated economic crises. Finally,
using supervised ML models, we predicted the most mentally vulnerable people with ~80%
accuracy.

Introduction​:
After 7 months of initial reporting, the coronavirus pandemic continues to rage across the world.
The mental health consequences of COVID-19 pandemic are profound. More than half a million
lives and more than 400 million jobs have been lost​1 causing a considerable degree of fear,
worry, and concern. These effects are seen in the population at large and may be pronounced
among certain groups in particular, such as youth, frontline workers, caregivers, and people with
chronic medical conditions. The new world order has introduced unprecedented interventions of
country-wide lockdowns that are necessary to control the spread but have led to increased social
isolation. Loneliness, depression, harmful alcohol, drug use, and self-harm or suicidal behavior
are also expected to rise.
The Lancet Psychiatry​2 recently highlighted the needs of vulnerable groups during this time,
including those with severe mental illness, learning difficulties, and neurodevelopmental
disorders, as well as socially excluded groups such as prisoners, the homeless, and refugees.
Calls to action highlighting the need for engaging more early-career psychiatrists 3​​ ,​4 , technology
such as Telepsychiatry, and highlighting the high susceptibility of frontline medical workers
themselves​5 highlights the magnitude of the problem. Further, interventions are expected to have
a gender-specific impact with women more likely to be exposed to additional stressors related to
informal care, already existing economic disparity, and school closures. Similarly, age and
comorbidity status may have a direct impact on susceptibility to mental health challenges due to
their relationship with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Indeed, it has been established that
emotional distress is ubiquitous in affected populations — a finding certain to be echoed in
populations affected by the Covid-19 pandemic​6​. Finally, the role of social media is complex
with some research indicating the association of social media exposure with a higher prevalence
of mental health problems​7​.
However, most of these effects have been studied in isolation with a lack of modeling the
collective impact of such factors. This study addresses this gap through the use of Bayesian
networks, an explainable artificial intelligence approach that captures the joint multivariate
distribution underlying a large survey data collected across the United States. We also address
the gap of prediction of vulnerability to mental health events such as anxiety attacks using
supervised machine learning models.

Methods:
Datasets
We extracted data of 17764 adults (​https://www.covid-impact.org/​)8​ from weekly surveys of the
U.S. adult household population nationwide for 18 regional areas including 10 states (CA, CO,
FL, LA, MN, MO, MT1, NY, OR, TX) and 8 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (Atlanta, Baltimore,
Birmingham, Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, Phoenix, Pittsburgh). To summarize, the dataset
comprised variables on physical health, mental health, Insurance related Policy, economic
security, and social dynamics​. ​Table-1 shows the socio-demographic characteristics of
respondents participating in the survey. Further details are available in the original source​8​.

Analysis
Figure 1(a) shows the flow diagram for the analyses conducted. The survey questions were
classified into several types of indicators such as mental-health, work-from-home,
communication,
COVID-symptoms,
chronic-medical-conditions,
behavioral-aspects,
insurance-assistance, and many others (see ​. Table-2 ). We constructed a model for mental-health
indicators, s​ oc5a (Felt nervous, anxious​, ​or on edge), ​soc5b ​(Felt depressed), ​soc5c ​(Felt lonely), soc5d
(Felt hopeless about the future), and soc5e​(sweating, trouble breathing, pounding heart, etc, in the last
seven days​) as outcome variables. Hence we first evaluated the consistency in answers to

mental-health questions using Item Reliability Analysis​. ​A scale for reliability measure of
internal consistency, ​Cronbach's alpha​, was calculated using the ​Psych ​package in R​9​.
Thereafter, a pairwise chi-square test of independence was performed to examine associations of
mental health indicators and other variables and a p-value of less than 0.05 was taken as the
cut-off for significance.
Since mental health variables may have complex dependencies with potential confounding
factors, mediation, and inter-causal dependency, we extended our association analysis with
data-driven Bayesian network (BN) structure learning. The structure of the learned Bayesian
network was made robust through bootstrapping and ensemble averaging of edge directions. Hill
climbing optimizer ​10 with Akaike Information Criterion(AIC)​11 based score was used to select
the best PGM that explained the data. Bootstrapped learning and majority voting over 101 BNs
were done. Exact Inference using the belief propagation algorithm​12 ​was learned in order to
quantify the strength of learned associations. The Analysis was performed in the R using the
package ​wiseR13
​ Next, the ​Markov-blanket14
​ ​of ​mental-health-indicators was extracted to select
features that may predict responses to the ​mental-health-indicators​. ​Data were partitioned into
training (80%) and testing (20%) sets and the class imbalance was corrected using the Synthetic

Minority Oversampling Technique(SMOTE)​15​. Different supervised machine learning models Random-Forest(RF), Support vector machine (SVM), logistic, naive-Bayes, were learned for
predicting the response to mental health indicators using the Scikit-learn​ ​library ​16​in Python.

Results​:

Gender and age-related variation in mental-health indicators​. ​soc5a (Felt nervous, anxious​, ​or
on edge), ​soc5b (​ Felt depressed), ​soc5c (​ Felt lonely), soc5d ​(Felt hopeless about the future) a​ chieved a
Cronbach's alpha approximating 0.8 [Figure 1(b)], thus confirming their internal consistency and
suitability for modeling. Gender and age-specific difference was observed in ​soc5a,​ ​with females
having a higher incidence than males (two proportion z-test, p-value < 2.2e-16) (Figure 2a), and
young adults in the 18-29 age group (p-value < 2.2e-16) (Figure 2b). Age group 18 - 29 in both
genders was most vulnerable to mental stress > 5 days in a week, thus indicating that COVID-19
may have disproportionately affected the mental health of youth due to a variety of factors.
Associations of anxiety in the United States. ​A ​Chi-square test revealed many significant
associations of the mental health variables(Supplementary Figure 1). However, this analysis does
not account for potential confounding or "explaining away" effects. Hence a data-driven
Bayesian network structure-learning exercise was carried out and revealed interesting findings.
From the learned structure, ​soc5a ​(Felt nervous, anxious, or on edge in the last seven days) was
found to be the parent variable for other mental health indicators in almost 100% of the
bootstrapped networks, represented as the strength of the edges [Figure 3(b)]. B
​ eing a driver
variable in the structure, ​soc5a was taken as the primary dependent variable for downstream
modeling analysis.
Impact of social life and work-related stressors. Our analysis using network inference via the
Exact Inference algorithm showed a clear impact of in-person social communication on the
reduction of anxiety level. A strong (>5% with CI ~1% at both sides) and (>6.5% with CI ~1.5%
at both sides) monotonic increase between control of anxiety and frequency of speaking with
neighbors ​(soc2a, soc2b) were observed. This effect was weaker (~1.5% with a wide confidence
interval) with digital communication with friends and family conducted over phone, text, email,
or other internet media (​soc3a, soc3b​). This finding underscores the importance of social
communication while maintaining the appropriate measures such as masks and social distancing
in order to maintain mental health during such isolating times. We also observed that the
presence of kids in the house reduces the probability of depression by >11% with CI ~2% on
both sides. Further, Exact Inference upon the network revealed an increase in the conditional

probability of anxiety ​(​soc5a)​ arising from canceled or postponed work (>4% with CI ~1.4%),
canceled, or postponed school(7% with CI ~1.5%), worked from home(>5% with CI ~1.3) and
studied from home(>7% with CI ~1.8). Interestingly, although 83% of all volunteers chose to
wear the mask, 77% avoided restaurants, 83% avoided public and crowded places these
measures were not found to be associated with a significant change in anxiety levels as inferred
from our model. These inferences are summarized in figure-4.

Impact of symptoms and comorbidities. We also investigated the relationship between mental
stress and COVID symptoms indicators. WHO recommends contacting health service providers
if any COVID symptoms (​phys1a t​ o phys1q​) are experienced within the last seven days. Our
network did not indicate any significant impact of these responses on mental health (​soc5a)​ , the
conditional probability of which remained unchanged (62.2%) across the responses.
Surprisingly, although medical conditions ​(phys3a ​to phys3m) are known to increase the risk of
serious illness from COVID-19, our model showed that suffering from cancer (​phys3k)​ and
hypertension (​phys3b​) had a reverse impact on anxiety levels. Those suffering from cancer had
approximately 8.3% (with ~2% CI) higher conditional probability of having less than one
anxiety-ridden day in a week (>7% effect for hypertension with CI ~1.5%). Additionally,
Cystic-fibrosis (phys3i) and Liver-disease (phys3j) have wide confidence intervals with
non-significant differences in mean values. (Figure-4).

Impact of economic factors. ​Receiving income assistance through Social Security improved the
conditional probability of less than one day of anxiety in a week by 10.4% (with CI ~1.5%) as
compared with the segment of people who did not apply or receive it. Just applying for income
assistance led to a 4% improvement ( Figure-4). Similarly, Supplemental Social Security (~5.5
with CI ~4%) and Health insurance (~5% with CI ~2%) also led to similar results.
In addition to this, Old age people found health insurance more relaxing than young age people.
COVID has also severely affected the financial condition of individuals. That may also lead to
mental stress.

Predictive modeling for susceptibility to anxiety attacks. ​Our supervised modeling approach
used the Markov blanket of the ​soc5a ​variable, i.e. age (​age4), p​ hysical symptoms in the last
seven days (​phys7_4)​ ​, s​ tay at home (​phys2_18​), and ​prior clinical diagnosis of any mental health
condition (​phys3h)​ as predictors.
The following three prediction scenarios were considered-

1. Mental issues ​less than one day in a week (class 1) vs. Mental issues ​more than o​ ne day
in a week (class 0)
2. Mental issues less than one day in a week (class 1) vs. Mental issues ​more than t​ hree
days​ in a week (class 0)
3. Mental issues ​less than one day in a week (class 1) vs. Mental issues ​more than f​ ive days
in a week (class 0)

We observed a decay (Accuracy 0.80 to 0.64, also confidence intervals mentioned in the table-2)
in model predictability as we moved from high risk of depression (case-3) to low risk of
depression (case-1) [figure4]. Such a trend was visible with all 4 machine learning techniques
we used. Our ML properties (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUROC) are summarized in
table-2.

Discussion:
Mental Health is a serious public health concern. Mood disorders and suicide-related outcomes
have increased significantly over the last decade among all age groups and genders​17 18​
​ . The
rapid spread of coronavirus infection forced governments across the world to close public
gathering places, schools, colleges, restaurants, and industries. Social isolation, digital
communication, working, and schooling from home have become the new normal and many jobs
have been lost. Collectively, this has triggered a high level of anxiety, stress, and depression,
globally. We did not find studies that have used models to not just predict but also to explain the
subtle effects of life-situations on mental health. An explainable probabilistic graphical modeling
approach with bootstraps and exact inference allowed us to capture many of these effects in a
robust manner. Our study revealed that individuals having a prior diagnosis of any mental illness
are the most vulnerable for mental illness during the COVID-19 phase, which recommends
building national-level policies to regularly track their mental status and treat them accordingly.
Most importantly, our results re-iterate the economic underpinnings of collective mental health
response. Income assistance via Social Security or Supplemental Social Security had a
demonstrable effect on the alleviation of anxiety as inferred from our model, which provides the
first scientific evidence, to the best of our knowledge, proving the utility of such efforts. The
effect of the extent of such measures may be captured in such modeling studies conducted in
various parts of the globe, with widely varying assistance structures during this time.
Our findings from the United States can also stimulate further cultural and social research in
other geographies with similar or different social structures. For example, the effects of in-person
communication, as opposed to digital connectedness, may be different in countries where

community living and joint families are still commonplace, e.g. India. Digital connectedness
was not as effective as talking to a neighbor, at least in the United States highlighting that these
are fundamentally different influences on mental health and need to be further explored in
systematic studies. We conjecture that such differences may arise from the evolutionary
mechanisms that have shaped human societies to live and share in close physical connectedness.
Such an effect has been previously shown in primates kept in isolation who display depressive
symptoms 19
​ 20​
​ . Similarly, parenting and its association with neuropeptide hormones may
partially explain 21
​ our results that the presence of kids reduces anxiety levels. Interestingly, the
COVID-19 pandemic has created a unique natural experiment on the collective mental health
response of individuals to a health emergency.
The life-cycle of such a response may need to be further studied as the world goes through
various phases of the pandemic to its resolution. However, our study indicates that the mental
health impact is observable within a span of a few months, especially on young individuals.
Further research will be needed, ideally in a longitudinal setting, where the same individuals can
be surveyed again to understand the dynamics of the collective mental health response.
Our results also highlight that modern technological development in virtual communication is
not able to replace natural socializing. Hence it becomes imperative to design better and
empathetic technological tools that may shape a society that prevents isolation and alienation
even while maintaining physical distancing and preventive measures for limiting spread.
Personalization and contextualization of such measures will also be important as our results
indicate that persons with previous mental health conditions may be disproportionately affected.
Finally, our results indicate that it may be possible to identify people at the highest risk of
developing mental health disturbances. Our model achieved its best performance for those who
were most vulnerable (having mental stress more than five days in a week) vs. least vulnerable
people (having no stress or less than one-day stress in a week). This can help in the segmentation
of vulnerable populations such as front-line healthcare workers and who are facing
disproportionately higher levels of stress during this time.
We could not explain why anxiety levels may be lower in persons with pre-existing cancer or
hypertension. This may be a result of reduced work-environment related stress or more contact
with family members at home. However, the current dataset is not suited to address this at a finer
level of explainability. Our study has a few limitations. The dataset used for training the model is
cross-sectional and we could not comment upon the temporality and persistence of the
discovered effects. Secondly, our results were currently limited to only one geography, i.e. the
United States. However, the relatively large sample size and multi-ethnic involvement in the
survey allowed us to construct a robust network with ensemble averaging and majority voting
from 101 bootstrapped networks. Therefore, the discovered influences are likely to hold true in
the United States. Further, we believe that this is the first attempt to quantify the impact of social
factors on mental health through an explainable AI model and many of our findings are intuitive.
The ranking of features and quantification of this impact couldn't have been intuitively achieved

without modeling and this study will provide a basis for many further studies and design of
effective social interventions to mitigate the mental health impact of natural health disasters.

Figure 3: (a) Consensus structure learned through 101 bootstrapped samples. Hill-climbing
search along with Bayesian Information Criterion were used to learn the structures and
connections having edge strength and direction strength more than 90% are shown; (b) soc5a
was found to be the parent Node of all other Mental Health Variables, therefore, leading to our
choice of this variable as the Primary dependent variable.

Figure-4: Inferences from the Bayesian network: The difference in inferred probability was
calculated after conditioning on the independent variables. A positive association implies a
mental-stress-inducer whereas a negative association implies mental-stress-reducer. The red
circle shows the mean value with green and blue showing confidence intervals.
