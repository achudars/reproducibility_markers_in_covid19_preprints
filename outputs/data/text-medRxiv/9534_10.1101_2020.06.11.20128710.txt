Abstract
Background
High prevalence of thrombotic events in severely ill COVID-19 patients have been
reported. Pulmonary embolism as well as microembolization of vital organs may in
these individuals be direct causes of death.​ The identification of patients at high risk
of developing thrombosis may lead to targeted, more effective prophylactic
treatment.
Objectives
To test whether R
​ otational Thromboelastometry ​(ROTEM) indicates
hypercoagulopathy in COVID-19 patients, and whether patients with severe disease
have a more pronounced hypercoagulopathy compared with less severely ill
patients.
Methods
The study was designed as a prospective observational study where ​COVID-19
patients over 18 years admitted to hospital ​were eligible for inclusion. Patients were
divided into two groups depending on care level: 1) regular wards or 2) wards with
specialized ventilation support. ROTEM was taken after admission and the data
were compared with ROTEM in healthy controls.
Results
The ROTEM variables Maximum Clot Firmness (EXTEM-/FIBTEM-MCF) were
higher in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls (p<0.001) and higher in
severely ill patients compared with patients at regular wards (p<0.05). Coagulation
Time (EXTEM-CT) was longer and Clot Formation Time (EXTEM-CFT) shorter in
COVID-19 patients compared with healthy controls. Our results suggest that
hypercoagulopathy is present in hospitalized patients with mild to severe COVID-19
pneumonia.
Conclusion
ROTEM variables were significantly different in COVID-19 patients early after
admission compared with healthy controls. This​ pattern was more pronounced in
patients with increased disease severity, ​suggesting that ​ROTEM-analysis may be
useful to predict thromboembolic complications in these patients.

Background
Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel corona virus
SARS-CoV-2, has the last few months taken hold of the world and spread as a
global pandemic with presently more than 8.0 million cases 1​​ . ​The lungs are the main
target organ for COVID-19, and p​atients who become critically ill generally suffer
from respiratory distress leading to difficulties in ventilation and oxygenation.
However, the respiratory symptoms in COVID-19 display atypical features, which
have challenged the conventional mechanical ventilation strategies 2​​ .
A recent Dutch study of 184 COVID-19 positive patients treated at intensive care
units (ICUs) showed a cumulative incidence of thrombotic events of 49%, mainly
pulmonary embolism 2​​ . Autopsy reports have confirmed and even exceeded this high
rate of thrombosis 3,4​
​ , and have also shown a high prevalence of microthrombosis in
the small veins of the lungs 5​​ . Thromboembolic complications may be a direct cause
of death in COVID-19 3,4​
​ and in addition, the loss of perfusion caused by thrombi in
the lungs will impair pulmonary gas exchange independently of the direct tissue
damage caused by the viral pneumonia. This will contribute to the respiratory failure
that is the main cause of critical disease in patients with COVID-19.
Elevated levels of fibrin degradation products (e.g. D-dimer) have consistently been
reported as a strong prognostic factor associated with poor outcome in patients with
COVID-19 6,7​
​ . ​This suggests a general coagulation activation and secondary
hyperfibrinolysis. However, the D-dimer increase is not evident in early stages of the
disease 7​​ , limiting its usefulness as a prognostic marker.
Maximum clot firmness (MCF) may be calculated using Rotational
Thromboelastometry (ROTEM)​ ​and is considered a good marker for
hypercoagulopathy 8​​ . Theoretically, ROTEM variables may be affected earlier during
the disease course compared with D-dimer and may be of greater value as a
predictor of disease severity. Studies assessing ROTEM in COVID-19 patients
treated at ICUs have shown elevated MCF values 9,10​
​ . However, no ROTEM data at
earlier stages of the disease have, to our knowledge, yet been reported.
The aim of this study was to assess the presence of coagulopathy, measured by
ROTEM, in COVID-19 patients at hospital admission.

Materials and methods
Study design
The study was designed as a prospective observational study and was approved by
the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (D-nr 2020-01875). Patients over 18 years of
age, who tested positive for COVID-19 and were considered in need of hospital care
were eligible for inclusion in the study. Recruitment of patients commenced May 8th,
2020, and is planned to continue for three months in total. Here we report on
subjects included up to May 31st, 2020.
All patients were included at Capio St Göran’s Hospital (StG) in Stockholm, Sweden.
Patients presenting at StG Emergency Room with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections
and in need of hospitalization are admitted either to regular wards with possibility of
low-flow oxygen therapy (henceforth “Regular ward”) or to wards with possibilities of
specialized ventilation support; either non-invasive ventilation in intermediate wards
(Biphasic Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) or High-Flow Oxygen Therapy (HFOT))
or to the Intensive Care Unit where, in addition to BiPAP and HFOT, mechanical
ventilation support is provided (henceforth “Specialized wards”).
Conventional coagulation tests (CCTs): D-dimer, P-fibrinogen, Activated Partial
Thromboplastin Time (APTT), International Normalized Ratio (INR), Antithrombin
and Platelet count as well as ROTEM were drawn from all included patients as soon
after admission to hospital as possible (median within one day after admission).
ROTEM test results were blinded for clinicians, but CCTs were not. Aside from these
blood tests, nothing was changed in the routine care of included patients.
Anticoagulant treatment after admission were categorized according to 1) low
prophylactic dose LMWH = 75 IE/kg/24h; 2) high prophylactic dose LMWH = 150
IE/kg/24h; 3) treatment dose LMWH ≥ 200 IE/kg/24h; or 4) pre-existing anticoagulant
medication, e.g. new oral anticoagulants.
A ROTEM sigma (Tem Innovations GmbH, Germany) was used for the
thromboelastometric analyses. ROTEM sigma is a fully automated system with
proven ROTEM technology, where pipetting and test preparation are not required.
Analyzing time is 45-60 min for each test. All blood samples were analyzed at StG
laboratory within four hours after they were drawn.
ROTEM data collected from healthy individuals 2011-2012 for a previously published
study were used as controls. The original publication contains further details 11​

ROTEM-tests
Two of four ROTEM-variables are presented here: i) extrinsically activated assays
with tissue factor (EXTEM); ii) with tissue factor and platelet inhibitor cytochalasin D

platelet contribution to clot formation, leaving only the impact of fibrin formation and
polymerization. Coagulation Time (CT) is the time (in seconds) from test start until an
amplitude of 2 mm is reached, giving information about coagulation activation /
initiation. Clot Formation Time (CFT) is the time (in seconds) between 2 mm
amplitude and 20 mm amplitude, giving information about clot propagation.
Maximum Clot Firmness (MCF) is the maximum amplitude (in millimeters) reached
during the test, giving information about clot stability. A short EXTEM-CFT and an
increased EXTEM-MCF and/or FIBTEM-MCF suggest a hypercoagulable state.

Statistical analysis
All continuous variables are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR).
Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to test whether ROTEM data for COVID-19 patients
differed depending on care level (Regular ward; Specialized wards), or from healthy
controls. If the tests were significant, pairwise two-sided Wilcoxon tests were
performed. Spearman’s correlation coefficients were calculated to assess
associations between variables. P-values below 0.05 were considered statistically
significant. R version 4.0.0 was used to perform statistical analysis and
visualizations.

Results
Sixty COVID-19 positive patients and 89 healthy controls were included in the
analysis. ​Table 1​ presents patient characteristics. Comorbidities were common
within the COVID-19 patient group, where 42% of patients had a prior diagnosis of
hypertension and 28% of diabetes. 48 patients (80%) received prophylactic
anticoagulant treatment (ACTr) after admission, and in 36 (60%) patients this
treatment was administered before ROTEM was analyzed. Of patients with ACTr
before ROTEM, 19 received low dose prophylaxis with Low Molecular Weight
Heparin (LMWH), 7 had high dose prophylaxis with LMWH, 5 had treatment dose
LMWH and 5 continued their regular anticoagulant medication.

Table 2​ presents laboratory test results in healthy controls and COVID-19 patients.
D-dimer​ was increased in patients in specialized wards compared with patients in
regular wards. ​P-fibrinogen​ was increased in patients in both regular and specialized
wards compared with controls, but there were no differences observed between care
levels. The data are also visualized in ​Supplemental Figure S1​ and ​S2.​
For EXTEM-CT, the Kruskal-Wallis test showed a significant difference between the
groups (H(2) = 97.1, p < 0.001). Post-hoc pairwise Wilcoxon tests showed that
COVID-19 patients (both care levels) had significantly longer CT compared with
healthy controls (p<0.001) and that subjects treated at specialized wards had longer
CT compared with subjects treated at regular wards (p<0.001) (​Figure 1A, Table 2)​ .

To assess the association between D-dimer and EXTEM-MCF, and P-Fibrinogen
and FIBTEM-MCF at an early stage of the disease, Spearman's correlation
coefficient was calculated for the subset of data where ROTEM data were available
from the first day after hospital admission (N=34). There was no significant
correlation observed between D-dimer and EXTEM-MCF (correlation = 0.02, p =
0.9). The correlation between P-Fibrinogen and FIBTEM-MCF was significant
(correlation = 0.84, p < 0.001) (​Figure 2​).

with healthy controls; longer EXTEM-CT, shorter EXTEM-CFT and increased
EXTEM-MCF and FIBTEM-MCF. This suggests a patient with prolonged
haemostatic initiation, shortened clot propagation and, notably, with a pronounced
clot firmness, indicating hypercoagulation.

Discussion
In this prospective observational study we assessed the level of coagulopathy in
COVID-19 patients using ROTEM analysis. Previous studies have shown deranged
values in critically ill patients 9,10​
​ . To our knowledge, this is the first time data on less
severely ill patients early after admission to hospital are published. In our sample, we
observed significantly higher EXTEM-MCF and FIBTEM-MCF in patients treated at
regular wards compared with healthy controls. This indicates that coagulopathy is
present early in the disease course and suggests that ROTEM-analysis may
potentially be a useful predictor of thromboembolic complications and mortality.
During the months since COVID-19 was classified as a pandemic, evidence has
emerged indicating coagulopathy and thrombosis as crucial explanations to why
some patients develop severe illness 2,3​
​ . The pattern of higher EXTEM-MCF and
FIBTEM-MCF in more severely ill patients in our data strengthens the hypothesis
that the atypical respiratory symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients may partly be
caused by thromboembolism impairing lung perfusion.
Increased D-dimer and P-fibrinogen have been reported to predict poor clinical
outcome in COVID-19 patients 6,7​
​ . However, both these tests have caveats: the
D-dimer blood test is nonspecific and may be increased in a variety of conditions
including malignancy, inflammation and infection 13​
​ ; fibrinogen is an acute phase
reactant, and high levels of P-fibrinogen may reflect a patient with a high
inflammatory profile, which itself may amplify the effects of other cardiovascular risk
factors ​14​. Furthermore, conventional coagulation tests (CCTs) are limited by their
inability to assess clot strength, fibrinogen functionality and fibrinolysis 15​
​ .
Conversely, ROTEM provides a more rapid and comprehensive assessment of
whole blood clot formation allowing for a complete view of the entire coagulation
cascade, and has been shown a better tool for monitoring coagulation profiles than
CCTs 16,17​
​
.
As can be seen in ​Figure 2​, FIBTEM-MCF and P-fibrinogen are highly correlated in
COVID-19 patients, whereas EXTEM-MCF supplies information that differs from
D-dimer at an early disease stage. If individuals at risk of developing COVID-19
related thromboses are identified at an early stage, enhanced prophylaxis with
LMWH may decrease mortality in this group of patients 6​​ ​18​. It is feasible that ROTEM

could be applied for this purpose. Whether the ROTEM data will have better
predictive characteristics compared with CCTs do, however, remain to be shown.
Sepsis is known to exert a complex effect on the coagulation system, generally
affecting all aspects of clot formation, kinetic activity and clot development 19​
​ . Already
in the early stages of sepsis the coagulation system and the platelets are strongly
activated 20​
​ . However, it has been recently shown that the coagulopathy related to
the COVID-19 pathogenesis differs from the disseminated intravascular coagulation
(DIC) associated with sepsis, with relatively normal levels of INR, APTT and platelets
despite markedly elevated d-dimer levels 21
​ 22​. Our results confirm these findings.
Nevertheless, whether this hypercoagulability is due to the characteristics of the
invading microorganism, the individual viral load, or the massive host inflammatory
response remains unknown. The coagulopathy related to COVID-19 respiratory
distress may in some way be specific for the SARS-CoV-2 species, representing
new features that need to be further explored.

Limitations
Our study has limitations. First, 60% of patients had received anticoagulant
treatment before ROTEM analysis, usually low dose, which may have to some
degree counteracted hypercoagulation. However, despite this limitation, ROTEM
results were highly significantly increased in COVID-19 patients compared with
healthy controls. Second, not all patients admitted for COVID-19 at St Göran’s
Hospital (StG) during this period were tested using ROTEM, and not all patients that
were included were tested during the first day after admission. The main reasons for
this were: (i) Due to clinical duties the physicians responsible for the study were not
always able to scan the wards for new patients on a daily basis (ii) and more
importantly, limitation of the testing equipment, with possibility to run a maximum of 6
tests every 4 hours. Still, we believe that the included patients are a representative
cross-section of the COVID-19 patients treated at StG during the study period.

Conclusion
In hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients, elevated values of EXTEM-MCF and
FIBTEM-MCF were seen at admission to hospital, suggesting a hypercoagulable
state. This pattern was more pronounced in patients with more severe disease.
Whether ROTEM-analysis at admission to hospital has value as a predictor of
clinical outcome (e.g., mortality, thrombosis) in COVID-19 positive patients will be
analyzed at a later stage of this research project.
