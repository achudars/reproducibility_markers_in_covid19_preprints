ABSTRACT

Background & Aims:
New York is the current epicenter of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The
underrepresented minorities, where the prevalence of obesity is higher, appear to be affected
disproportionally. Our objectives were to assess the characteristics and early outcomes of patients
hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Bronx and investigate whether obesity is associated with worse
outcomes.
Methods:
This retrospective study included the first 200 patients admitted to a tertiary medical center with
COVID-19. The electronic medical records were reviewed at least three weeks after admission. The
primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality.
Results:
200 patients were included (female sex: 102, African American: 102). The median BMI was 30 kg/m2. The
median age was 64 years. Hypertension (76%), hyperlipemia (46.2%), and diabetes (39.5%) were the
three most common comorbidities. Fever (86%), cough (76.5%), and dyspnea (68%) were the three most
common symptoms. 24% died during hospitalization (BMI <25 kg/m2: 31.6%, BMI 25-34 kg/m2: 17.2%,
BMI≥35 kg/m2: 34.8%, p= 0.03). The multivariate analysis for mortality, demonstrates that BMI≥35 kg/m2
(OR: 3.78; 95% CI: 1.45 - 9.83; p=0.006), male sex (OR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.25 - 5.98; p=0.011) and
increasing age (OR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.13 - 2.63; p=0.011) were independently associated with higher in-

hospital mortality. Similar results were obtained for the outcomes of increasing oxygen requirement and
intubation.
Conclusions:
In this cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in a minority-predominant population, severe
obesity, increasing age, and male sex were associated with higher in-hospital mortality and in general
worse in-hospital outcomes.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has evolved to a global pandemic with more than two million confirmed
cases and about 200 thousand deaths so far [1]. The first cases in the United States (U.S.) were reported
on January 19th, 2020 in the Washington state [2]. Since then, about one million confirmed cases and
sixty thousand deaths have been reported [3]. New York City (NYC) is the current epicenter of the
pandemic with about 160 thousand confirmed cases and more than twelve thousand deaths to date [4].
Early reports from Asia and Europe have identified older age, male sex, and chronic medical conditions,
such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, coronary artery disease, and heart failure, as risk factors
associated with worse outcomes [5-7]. However, little is known about the risk factors and the
characteristics of the disease in the United States population and particularly in underrepresented

minorities, who appear to be affected disproportionally by COVID-19 [4,7]. The age-adjusted death rate
per 100,000 people in NYC is more than double for African Americans compared to Whites (127.1 vs.
63.5) [4]. The higher prevalence of medical conditions that are considered risk factors for severe
COVID-19 among African Americans and the higher risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 due to living and
working conditions seem to be plausible explanations for the observed disproportionate differences in
outcomes [7]. The Bronx, which is the most diverse area in the United States as per the 2010 U.S.
Census, ranks last among all 62 counties of New York state in health outcomes, quality of life and
important health and socioeconomic factors according to County Health Rankings and Roadmaps [8]. In
addition, the Bronx has the highest obesity rates among all NYC boroughs and stands remarkably higher
than the national average [9,10].
Our primary objective with this analysis was to investigate whether obesity is associated with worse inhospital outcomes. Our secondary objective was to assess and present the clinical characteristics and
early outcomes of the first 200 patients, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted to a large
tertiary academic center and to define whether Diabetes, hypertension or other obesity comorbidities
are independently associated with adverse outcomes.

Materials and Methods
Study design and patient population
This retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Montefiore Medical Center, a tertiary academic
institution in the Bronx, New York. The first 200 patients who presented to the emergency room (ER)
and were admitted to the inpatient medicine service or the intensive care unit (ICU) with laboratory-

confirmed COVID-19 were included. We excluded patients who met one of the following exclusion
criteria: i) discharge home directly from the ER, ii) transfer to our center after having received care in
other institutions and iii) admission for non-COVID-19 related reasons or non-medical reasons (e.g.
patients admitted because of a fracture, clinically stable patients residing in group homes unable to selfisolate). The 200 included patients were followed for three weeks after their admission to the hospital
(admission of 1st patient: March 9, 2020; admission of the 200th patient: March 22, 2020; completion of
3-week follow-up: April 12, 2020).
The study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of the Albert Einstein College of
Medicine with a waiver of the inform consent (IRB number 2020-11296).

Data Extraction
Two researchers (LP, WL) reviewed the electronic medical records (EMR) independently in a predefined data extraction sheet which was created for the purpose of this study. The documentation of
the index admission from emergency medicine providers, inpatient providers, consultants, nurses,
therapists, and social workers, the laboratory, and imaging data were reviewed. Post-discharge notes
(e.g., tele-medicine follow-up visits, nursing outreach) were also reviewed when available.
Documentation from past visits and the search engine of the EMR were also utilized.
The extracted data included baseline demographic information [(age, gender, race/ethnicity, residence
status (community or skilled nursing facility/SNF), and zip code], clinical characteristics [body mass index
(BMI), history of smoking, alcohol, intravenous drug use, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia,
coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary

nausea/vomiting, diarrhea), vital signs on presentation (oxygen saturation on room air, heart rate,
presence of fever), level of oxygen requirement in the ER, laboratory data on the first hospital day [white
cell count, lymphocyte count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, aspartate transaminase (AST),

The data were processed and analyzed without any personal identifiers to maintain patient confidentiality
as per Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

Outcomes and Statistical Analysis
Patients were classified in three groups based on the BMI: BMI<25 kg/m2, BMI 25-34 kg/m2, and BMI≥35
kg/m2 as per the most recent BMI assessment prior to or during the index admission. Severe obesity was
defined as BMI≥35 kg/m2. Patients were also classified in four quartiles based on age: ≤50, 51-64, 65-73,

and ≥74 years old. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality. Secondary endpoints included:
increasing oxygen requirement during hospital stay and intubation. Deceased patients were excluded
from the length of stay analysis. Continuous data are presented as median with interquartile range (IQR)
and categorical data as absolute and relative frequencies. The ANOVA test was used to compare the
continuous variables, while chi-square was used for discrete variables. Interaction analyses were
performed as needed. A logistic regression model was used to identify baseline variables associated with
in-hospital mortality, intubation and increasing oxygen requirements. BMI 25-34 kg/m2 was used as a
reference in order to perform dichotomous comparisons with patients with severe obesity (BMI≥ 35
kg/m2). In order to build a multivariate model, we used a forward stepwise approach with the following
method for each one of the studied outcomes; model 1: BMI and age, model 2: all the variables with
significant univariate associations (p value ≤ 0.05), and model 3: the variables of model 2 in addition to
clinically significant variables which did not show a significant univariate association. Results of logistic
regression are given as the odds ratio (OR) with the 95% confidence interval (CI). The threshold of
statistical significance was p≤0.05. All analyses were performed using STATA software (version 14·1;
STATA Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
In total, 200 patients admitted with COVID-19 were included in this analysis (female sex= 102, BMI<25
kg/m2=38, BMI 25-34 kg/m2=116, and BMI≥35 kg/m2=46). The median BMI was 30 (IQR 26-35) kg/m2.
Most of our patients were either of African American race (51%) or of Hispanic ethnicity (34.5%). 23.5%
were SNF residents. The median age of the whole cohort was 64 (50-73.5) years, with significant
differences among the three groups [BMI<25 kg/m2: 73 (64-80) vs. BMI 25-34 kg/m2 63 [48.5-71] vs.
BMI≥35 kg/m2: 57.5 (45-67), p<0.001). 32.5% of our cohort was active or past smokers. Hypertension,

hyperlipemia and coronary artery disease were prevalent in 76%, 46.2% and 16.5% of our patients,
respectively. 17% had a history of heart failure while 27.5% had a history of asthma or COPD. 29%
percent had a history of chronic kidney disease or ESRD. Diabetes was prevalent in 39.5% of our
patients. The detailed baseline demographic and clinical characteristics are presented in Table 1.
Fever (86%), cough (76.5%), dyspnea (68%) and malaise (58%) were the four most common symptoms.
The median SO2 on the first hospital day was 95% (IQR 89-97) without significant differences among
groups. Symptoms and signs are presented in Table 2. All 200 patients received chest x-ray on
presentation, with 55.5% of them having bilateral infiltrates and 27% having only unilateral findings. The
laboratory and radiologic findings are presented in Table 3.
In total, 24% of our cohort died during hospitalization, with higher rates among individuals with severe
obesity (BMI<25 kg/m2: 31.6%, BMI 25-34 kg/m2: 17.2%, BMI≥35 kg/m2: 34.8%, p= 0.030). Similarly,
patients with severe obesity were more likely to undergo intubation (BMI<25 kg/m2: 18.4%, BMI 2534 kg/m2: 16.4%, BMI≥35 kg/m2: 34.8%, p= 0.032). In total, 45% of our patients had increasing oxygen
requirements during hospital stay without significant differences among BMI groups. Twenty-two percent
developed ARDS and 16% spent at least one night in the ICU. In-hospital outcomes are presented
in Table 4.
Logistic Regression Analyses
In-hospital Mortality
The univariate associations with in-hospital mortality were examined for all the baseline demographic
and clinical characteristics. Increasing age (analyzed in quartiles), male sex, BMI≥35 kg/m2 (reference: BMI
25-34 kg/m2), heart failure, CAD, and CKD or ESRD were found to have a significant univariate

association (Table 5). The following variables were not shown to be statistically significant in the
univariate associations: hypertension, hyperlipidemia,

smoking (Table 5). In the multivariable analysis (model 3), male sex (OR: 2.74; 95% CI: 1.25-5.98;
p=0.011), increasing age (OR: 1.73; 95% CI: 1.13 - 2.63; p=0.011), and BMI≥35 kg/m2 (OR: 3.78; 95% CI:
1.45 - 9.83; p=0.006) were found to have significant associations.
Increasing Oxygen Requirements
Male sex, current or former smoking and BMI≥35 kg/m2 (reference: BMI 25-34 kg/m2) were found to
have a significant univariate association with increasing oxygen requirements (Table 6). In the
multivariate analysis (model 3), male sex (OR: 2.77; 95% CI: 1.48 - 5.19; p=0.001), increasing age analyzed
in quartiles (OR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.01 - 1.89; p=0.042), BMI > 35 kg/m2 (OR: 3.09; 95% CI: 1.43 6.69; p=0.004), and current or former smoking (OR: 2.10; 95% CI: 1.07 - 4.10; p=0.031) were significant
predictors (Table 6).
Intubation
Male sex, and BMI≥35 kg/m2 (reference: BMI 25-34.9 kg/m2) were found to have a significant univariate
association with intubation (Table 7). In the multivariate analysis (model 3), male sex (OR: 3.35; 95% CI:
1.51 - 7.46, p=0.003), increasing age analyzed in quartiles (OR: 1.50; 95% CI:1.05 - 2.12; p=0.025), and
BMI≥35 kg/m2 (OR: 3.87; 95% CI: 1.47 - 10.18; p=0.006) were significant predictors (Table 7).

Given the significant associations that we noticed for male sex, age and BMI≥35 kg/m2 with the outcomes
that we examined, we performed an interaction analysis for this set of variables. Two different
interactions were tested; sex with BMI and age with BMI. Both of them were not significant.

Discussion
Our study described the baseline characteristics, clinical features, and early outcomes of the first 200
patients who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 in our institution that mainly serves African American
and Hispanic population. This is the first study that has performed joint evaluation of age, gender, obesity
and multiple comorbidities that have previously been linked with adverse outcomes. The main findings
can be summarized as following: 1) the in-hospital mortality was 24% with only 3% patients still
hospitalized on the 21-day follow-up 2) severe obesity (BMI≥35 kg/m2), increasing age, and male sex have
an independent association with mortality and need for intubation 3) severe obesity (BMI≥35 kg/m2),
increasing age, male sex, and smoking have an independent association with increasing oxygen
requirements during hospitalization.
Older age and male sex have already been described as risks factor for severe disease and death in
patients with COVID-19 [5,11-16], although large outcome studies are needed to assess the latter. The
most interesting finding of our analysis is that severe obesity is a significant factor for severe respiratory
disease and death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. It should be pointed out that this association
remained significant after adjusting for several clinical entities, such as diabetes, coronary artery disease,
heart failure, COPD, CKD or ESRD, and smoking, which indicates that obesity may predispose to
negative outcomes independently. To the best of our knowledge, no other studies to date have shown

an independent and direct association of severe obesity to mortality in patients with COVID-19;
however, some preliminary published data have linked obesity to severe COVID-19. A large cohort from
New York City depicted that obesity is strongly associated with progression to critical illness with
substantially higher odds ratio than any cardiovascular or pulmonary disease (BMI 30-40 kg/m2 OR: 1.38;
95% CI: 1.03-1.85; BMI>40 kg/m2 OR: 1.73; 95% CI 1.03-2.90) [17]. A cohort from China revealed that
obesity significantly increases the risk for developing severe pneumonia in the setting of COVID-19 (OR:
3.42; 95% CI: 1.42-8.27) [18]. Another report from China indicated that the presence of obesity in
patients with metabolic-associated fatty liver disease is associated with an almost 6-fold increased risk of
severe COVID-19 [19]. Obesity could partially explain why the mortality rate for COVID-19 is higher in
countries with higher prevalence of obesity, such as Italy, as compared to China and Japan [20]. Variables
such as diabetes and other cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidities were found to have a significant
association in prior reports from China and Italy [11-14]. However, most of these were obtained from
univariate estimates only. In our multivariate analyses it was shown that these comorbidities are likely
epiphenomena since they are not independent from male gender, older age or obesity which may be the
underlying link.
Our findings on the association of severe obesity to mortality in COVID-19 are not unanticipated given
our prior experience from the 2009 pandemic influenza (H1N1) disease. Morgan et al. reported
significant association of obesity to death in adult patients without recognized pre-existing medical
conditions hospitalized with H1N1 influenza disease (obesity OR: 3.1; 95% CI: 1.5 - 6.6); morbid obesity
OR: 7.6; 95% CI: 2.1 - 27.9) [21]. Obesity leads to increased work of breathing by augmenting the
airway resistance and is associated with decreased expiratory reserve volume, functional capacity, and
pulmonary compliance [22,23]. Central obesity results in decreased diaphragmatic excursion in supine
patients compromising ventilation [23]. Moreover, obesity is a chronic inflammatory state with increased

circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6, and is known to impair the
immune system [24, 25]. The observed association between severe obesity and mortality may also
underlie the observed association between low vitamin D levels, which are low in the obese, and
mortality and needs to be explored further [25].
The in-hospital mortality rate on 21-day follow-up in our cohort is 24%. Three inpatient cohorts from
China reported in-hospital mortality rates of 28.2%, 11.7%, and 17%, respectively [5,11,12]. A large
cross-sectional study from New York City, which did not include hospitals located in the Bronx,
reported a 14.6% mortality rate in the inpatient sample to the time of the analysis, however 35.9% of the
patients were still hospitalized, which indicates that the final inpatient mortality rate may be actually
higher [16]. Large retrospective cohorts that will probably be published in the following months will
accurately estimate the in-hospital mortality in the Bronx and elsewhere.
In total, 33.6% of adults in the Bronx are obese, a number which is much higher than all other NYC
boroughs, while the prevalence of obesity nationally is 20% [9,10]. Additionally, the prevalence of obesity
is higher among individuals of lower socioeconomic status (>35%) and substantially higher in nonHispanic blacks (36%) and Hispanic (35.4%) as compared to non-Hispanic whites (19.1%) [9]. The patient
population that our institution serves mainly includes patients of lower socioeconomic status and people
that identify themselves as African American or Hispanic. The combination of these two made up 85.5%
of our current study population. The median income, as estimated by the zip codes based on publicly
available data provided by the internal revenue service, was not found to be a risk factor for worse
outcomes in our study, which is explained by the fact that the Bronx is a homogenous area of low
income.

We report that active or prior smoking was associated with increasing oxygen requirements during
hospitalization. This is in contrast to the results of a recent meta-analysis of five studies from China
which concluded that active smoking did not seem to be significantly associated with higher risk of
progressing to severe COVID-19 [26]. Large observational studies and future meta-analyses will
elucidate the association of smoking with COVID-19 severity and other outcomes.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to date showing the independent association of
severe obesity to in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. One of the strengths of the current
study is that our included patients represent underserved and economically disadvantaged minorities;
thus, revealing the early outcomes of COVID-19 in this vulnerable population and usually underreported
and underrepresented in clinical research. Additionally, two researchers independently and blindly
collected data which reduces errors and bias. On the other hand, our study has several limitations. First,
our sample was relatively small, but given the nature of the evolving pandemic, it was of paramount
importance to make our early data and findings widely available as soon as possible, especially given the
lack of data up to date in COVID-19 in minorities and underserved population. Second, this was a realworld study with a retrospective design utilizing the electronic medical records, which is suboptimal
compared to a prospective study that could have more accurate follow-up assessment. Third, the rapidly
changing management of COVID-19 might have affected our results but it highly unlikely that could have
differentials affected associations between obesity and mortality. Fourth, we handled BMI as a categorical
variable in the regression analysis. This can lead to suboptimal conclusions, but we think that specific cutoffs, following established clinical guidelines on obesity, may be of more interest and ease for the
clinicians compared to interpretation of continuous variables in a regression model.

In conclusion in this early cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in an underserved, minoritypredominant population in the Bronx, we found that severe obesity was associated with higher inhospital mortality even after adjusting for other pertinent potential confounding factors. Particular
attention should be paid in protection of this population given the higher chance for negative outcomes
once they are diagnosed with the disease. In addition, obese patients diagnosed with COVID-19 should
be treated with extra caution given the possible higher risk for adverse outcomes. While we recognize
the limitations, we hope that our study will stimulate additional researchers to further study the effect of
obesity in COVID-19 and outcomes of minorities diagnosed with COVID-19. Larger cohort studies are
needed to confirm our data and pilot clinical trials are needed to assess whether pharmacotherapy for
obesity and its comorbidities may improve outcomes in the short or the long term.
