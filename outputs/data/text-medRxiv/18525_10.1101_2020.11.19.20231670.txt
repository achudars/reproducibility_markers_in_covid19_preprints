Abstract
COVID-19 restrictive measures severely impacted maternity services worldwide, but little is known
about the differences in women's concerns, perception of the modifications of maternity services
and childbirth programs at different times during the pandemic. Here we report data from the first
COVID-19 wave in Italy, during the 2020 national lockdown (March-April) and soon after lockdown
release (May).
1307 pregnant women answered the survey during national lockdown (phase 1) or after restrictive

Introduction
Since January 30

th

2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the pandemic status due

to COVID-19. In order to contain the spread of the infection, restrictive measures have been
adopted in many countries and in particular in Italy, the first COVID-19 pandemic epicenter among
European countries. Italian government established a period of full ‘lockdown’, consisting of travel
bans,

impacted maternity services worldwide [2], so

The

that at the

beginning of March, WHO highlighted the need of maintaining respectful care during pregnancy,
labour and childbirth despite the pandemic for all women, including those who were affected by
COVID-19 or tested positive to SARSCoV2 infection; this position was enforced internationally both
by professionals and by human rights advocates [3, 4]. Studies conducted during the first months
of the pandemic highlighted that pregnant women suffered for health-related restrictions, were
worried

about

the

lack

information

from

and

expressed concern about their labour and birth [5]. After a few months of strict restrictions, virus
spread decreased almost everywhere and many activities and services resumed. In Italy, lockdown
was released at the beginning of May and, despite the maintenance of an “emergency status”,
maternity services were allowed to reorganise their activities without the restrictions they had
adopted during the pandemic. We have already shown that during the very first weeks of COVID19 pandemic childbirth scenario was very frightening for Italian women [5], and this condition was
also shown to negatively influence their mental health [6]. Nevertheless, little is known on what
actually changed after lockdown measures were released.
In order to address the differences in women’s perception of maternity services organization and
childbirth programs that were adopted at different times during the pandemic, here we report
data collected in the first COVID-19 wave in Italy during the 2020 national lockdown (March-April)
and soon after lockdown release (after May 3

).

Methods
Detailed methods of the study have already been described [7]. Briefly, the nation-wide crosssectional web-based survey COVID-ASSESS was conducted between March and May 2020 in a
sample of Italian pregnant women, recruited with a snowball technique.

conduct the survey was received from Florence University ethics committee (prot. n. 006897).

Results
A total of 1307 pregnant women answered the survey during national lockdown (phase 1) or after
restrictive measures were released (phase 2). Throughout Italy, women reported a significantly
higher concern for COVID-19 during phase 1 than during phase 2 (overall mean concern 2.34, SD
0.5 vs 2.12, SD 0.5 on a Likert scale 0-3; p<0.001; Fig. 1A).
In keeping with a preliminary analysis [5] conducted on 200 subjects recruited during phase 1,
pregnant women were significantly less concerned with their own health than with the one of

their relatives; concerns with the future (in particular for their baby, their job or society in general)
were also high (Fig 1B). In addition, while health concerns significantly decreased during phase 2,
concerns for the future did not change (Fig 1B). As expected, several domains of perinatal care
were affected during COVID-19 lockdown: while antenatal visits, the use of technology to keep in
touch with healthcare professionals, and closeness of caregivers were generally more appreciated
(especially during phase 2), women reported the greatest difficulties in receiving clear information
on hospitalization, birth plan and partner’s presence at birth (Fig 1C). These difficulties were high

decreased from March 2020 to May 2020. On the one hand, this could be due to a reorganisation

In particular, women’s perception of proper information on their partner presence during labour

remains controversial in many countries. Activists for human rights in childbirth started a call for
action to put respect in pregnancy and childbirth at the centre of care, notwithstanding COVID-19;
for example, with the #butnotmaternity campaign women are trying to highlight disparities on
pandemic-related restrictions and asking that everybody is allowed a support figure with them for
maternal services. Also the Royal College of Midwives and the Royal College of Obstetricians and
Gynaecologists

the National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità) published a statement to remind all
Italian maternity services the need of combining respectful care with the strategies for containing
pandemic [10].
In conclusion, despite many global and local efforts, respectful care in maternity service during
COVID-19 pandemic

seems still to be fragmentary: partners are perceived as visitors and not as

caregivers, and not all maternal services have been reorganised. Indeed, this was the situation in
Italy

during
