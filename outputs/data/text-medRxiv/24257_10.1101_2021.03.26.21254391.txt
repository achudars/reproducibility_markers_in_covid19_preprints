Abstract
Background
The effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in frail older adults living in Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs) is
uncertain. We estimated protective effects of the first dose of ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2 vaccines against infection in
this population.

Methods
Cohort study comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated LTCF residents in England, undergoing routine asymptomatic
testing (8 December 2020 - 15 March 2021). We estimated the relative hazard of PCR-positive infection using Cox
proportional hazards regression, adjusting for age, sex, prior infection, local SARS-CoV-2 incidence, LTCF bed
capacity, and clustering by LTCF.

Results
Of 10,412 residents (median age 86 years) from 310 LTCFs, 9,160 were vaccinated with either ChAdOx1 (6,138; 67%)
or BNT162b2 (3,022; 33%) vaccines. A total of 670,628 person days and 1,335 PCR-positive infections were included.
Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for PCR-positive infection relative to unvaccinated residents declined from 28 days
following the first vaccine dose to 0·44 (0·24, 0·81) at 28-34 days and 0·38 (0·19, 0·77) at 35-48 days. Similar effect
sizes were seen for ChAdOx1 (aHR 0·32 [0·15-0·66] and BNT162b2 (aHR 0·35 [0·17, 0·71]) vaccines at 35-48 days.
Mean PCR cycle threshold values were higher, implying lower infectivity, for infections ≥28 days post-vaccination
compared with those prior to vaccination (31·3 vs 26·6, p<0·001).

Interpretation
The first dose of BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines was associated with substantially reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection
risk in LTCF residents from 4 weeks to at least 7 weeks.

Research in Context
Evidence before this study

We conducted a systematic search for studies which evaluated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine effectiveness in residents of longterm care facilities (LTCFs) published between 01/01/2020 and 11/03/2021. We used variations of search terms for
“COVID-19” AND “vaccine effectiveness” OR “vaccine efficacy” AND “care homes” OR “long term care facilities”
OR “older people” on Ovid MEDLINE and MedRxiv. We identified one pre-print article regarding LTCFs in Denmark,
which reported that a single dose of BNT162b was ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 infection in residents, however,
participants received the second vaccine dose 24 days following the first dose on average, which is likely to be too soon
to capture the protective effects of a single vaccine dose. Additionally, we identified two pre-print reports of studies
evaluating vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection and hospitalisation amongst older adults in the
community. The first of these found 81% vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19-related hospitalisation at 28-34 days
following a single dose of BNT162b or ChAdOx1 in ≥80-year-olds. The second of these found vaccine effectiveness
against symptomatic infection of 60% at 28-34 days and 73% at 35+ days following a single dose of ChAdOx1 in ≥70year-olds. No studies were identified that focused on the effectiveness of a single vaccine dose against infection
amongst LTCF residents at more than 4 weeks post-vaccination, a particularly important question in the context of the
UK policy decision to extend the dose interval beyond 3 weeks.

Added value of this study
We conducted a prospective cohort study of 10,412 residents aged ≥65 years, from 310 LTCFs across England, to
investigate the protective effect of the first dose of the ChAdOx1 and BNT162b vaccines against SARS-CoV-2
infection in frail older adults. We retrieved results from routine monthly PCR testing, as well as outbreak and clinical
testing for SARS-CoV-2, thereby capturing data on asymptomatic as well as symptomatic infections, which we linked
to vaccination records. We estimated vaccine effectiveness to be 56% (19-76%) at 28-34 days, and 62% (23-81%) at
35-48 days following a single dose of ChAdOx1 or BNT162. Our findings suggest that the risk of SARS-CoV-2
infection is substantially reduced from 28 days following the first dose of either vaccine and that this effect is
maintained for at least 7 weeks, with similar protection offered by both vaccine types. We also found that PCR cycle
threshold (Ct) values, which are negatively associated with the ability to isolate virus, were significantly higher in
infections occurring at ≥ 28days post vaccination compared to those occurring in the unvaccinated period, suggesting
that vaccination may reduce onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in breakthrough infections. To the best of our
knowledge, our findings constitute the first real-world evidence on vaccine effectiveness against infection for
ChAdOx1, in any age group. We can also infer that both vaccines are effective against the B.1.1.7 variant, because our
analysis period coincided with the rapid emergence of B.1.1.7 in England during the second wave of the pandemic.

Implications of all the available evidence

Our findings add to the growing body of evidence on the protective effect of the BNT162b vaccines in residents of
LTCFs and demonstrate the effectiveness of ChAdOx1 in this vulnerable population. Evaluating single-dose vaccine
efficacy has become increasingly important in light of extended dosing intervals that have been implemented in order to
maximise vaccine coverage across high-risk groups. Further work is required to evaluate the effectiveness of the first
vaccine dose after 8-12 weeks, as well as following the second dose, and to evaluate the long-term impact of
vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 infection, transmission and mortality in LTCFs. This will inform policy decisions
regarding the ongoing need for disease control measures in LTCF such as visitor restrictions, which continue to have a
detrimental impact on the wellbeing of residents, their relatives, and staff.

Introduction
The greatest impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been seen in residents of
Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs), who represent less than 1% of the population, 1 but account for a large proportion
of SARS-CoV-2 related deaths in European and North American countries.2–4 The UK has prioritised vaccination of
residents and staff in LTCFs5 to reduce the risk of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related morbidity and
mortality in this population, with the expectation that this will facilitate the relaxation of social restrictions.
Two vaccines have been deployed in LTCFs in England: Oxford/AstraZeneca’s non-replicating viral-vectored vaccine
(ChAdOx1 nCoV-19), licensed on 30 December 2020,6 and Pfizer/BioNTech’s messenger RNA-based vaccine
(BNT162b2), licensed on 2 December 2020.7 Both are Spike-protein based vaccines showing high efficacy (62·195·0%) in Phase 3 clinical trials when following a two-dose schedule.8,9 However, trials for both vaccines have enrolled
mostly younger, healthy adults. Vaccine efficacy data from frail older adults requiring long-term care are limited
because these individuals are routinely excluded from clinical studies and vaccine trials. 10,11 Consequently, trial
estimates of vaccine efficacy may not be generalisable to LTCF residents due to age-related differences in vaccineinduced immune responses.12–14 Observational data from post-licensure studies in older adults are emerging,15,16 but few
studies report specifically on LTCF populations.

Manufacturer-recommended intervals between first and second doses of BNT162b and ChAdOx1 vaccines are three
and four weeks, respectively, though trial data indicates higher efficacy with an extended dosing interval for
ChAdOx1.17 On 31 December 2020 the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation advised that the
intervals could be extended up to 12 weeks,18 in order to optimise first dose coverage. This decision was taken in the
context of rapidly increasing SARS-CoV-2 incidence, associated with the emergence of the highly transmissible B.1.1.7
variant and its subsequent spread within LTCFs from November 2020.19,20 This policy has made it increasingly
important to understand the extent and duration of protection against infection afforded by the first dose of each

vaccine, and whether single dose vaccination impacts on transmission. This knowledge will inform re-vaccination
schedules as well as policy decisions regarding the ongoing need for LTCF specific control measures which aim to
prevent transmission, such as visitor restrictions and asymptomatic testing.
As all LTCF residents aged ≥ 65 years have now been offered one dose of the vaccine, we analysed data from our
prospective observational cohort study to investigate the protective effect of the first dose of ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2
vaccines in this population. We compared the relative hazards of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and mean
PCR Cycle Threshold (Ct) values in vaccinated and unvaccinated residents by time since vaccination.

Methods
The VIVALDI study is a prospective cohort study, which was set up in May 2020 to investigate SARS-CoV-2
transmission, infection outcomes, and immunity in residents and staff in LTCFs in England that provide residential
and/or nursing care for adults aged 65 years and over.21 ‘For-profit’ and ‘not-for-profit’ chain Providers, and
independent Providers of differing sizes from all regions across England are participating in the study. Eligible LTCFs
were identified by the Care Provider’s Senior Management Team, or by the National Institute for Health Research
(NIHR) Clinical Research Network. Pseudonymised clinical and demographic data were retrieved for staff and
residents from participating LTCFs through national surveillance systems.
Since June 2020 all residents in LTCFs in England are offered regular SARS-CoV-2 testing using polymerase chain
reaction (PCR)-based assays of nasopharyngeal swab specimens.22 LTCF residents undergo monthly routine PCR
testing, and if an LTCF outbreak is suspected, local public health teams organise PCR testing for all residents upon
notification and 7 days later. Individuals who test positive are not re-tested for the following 90 days unless they
develop new COVID-19 symptoms.23 Symptom information is collected at the point of testing but its reliability is
uncertain in this frail population. Routine PCR testing data, including both positive and negative results, as well as any
positive PCR results from hospital-based clinical testing, were retrieved from the COVID-19 Datastore
[https://data.england.nhs.uk/covid-19/], which was established as part of the UK’s pandemic response. Void tests were
excluded from the analysis.
Age, sex, and LTCF location were obtained for all participants from national surveillance datasets. Vaccination records
(date, vaccine type, dose number) were retrieved from the National Immunisation Management Service (NIMS).
Estimates of the total number of beds and weekly bed occupancy in each LTCF were retrieved from Capacity Tracker
[https://www.necsu.nhs.uk/capacity-tracker], a national reporting tool collating weekly operational data from LTCF
managers. England is divided into 343 local authorities which are responsible for the delivery of community services
such as social care and education. Weekly SARS-CoV-2 incidence estimates at local authority level, produced by the
Department of Health and Social Care [https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/coronavirus-cases-by-localauthority-epidemiological-data], were used to derive the average monthly incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in the area

surrounding each LTCF. Subject to informed consent, blood sampling to detect IgG antibodies to Nucleocapsid protein
was offered to a subset of residents prior to vaccination. Where available, Cycle threshold (Ct) values were retrieved
for positive PCR tests within the study period.

Data linkage
PCR results from the national testing programme can be linked to specific residents using a pseudo-identifier which is
based on the individuals’ unique National Health Service (NHS) number. The Care Quality Commission regulates all
providers of health and social care in England. PCR results from the national testing programme are linked to specific
care homes using the Care Quality Commission’s unique location ID (CQC-ID), making it possible to link residents to
specific LTCFs.
We retrieved PCR test results, and associated data on age, sex, and CQC-ID, from 1 March 2020 onwards. Residents
with PCR tests linked to multiple CQC-IDs were assigned to the LTCF corresponding to their most recent PCR test.
The NHS number-based pseudo-identifier was used to retrieve vaccination records from the NIMS database, and to link
to antibody test results, which are both held in the COVID-19 Datastore (Supplement 1). Vaccination data from NIMS
were validated against coverage estimates from LTCFs where available. LTCFs with no record of resident vaccination
within NIMS were excluded from the analysis. The linked dataset was analysed in the UCL Data Safe Haven.
Population
We conducted an individual level analysis of the risk of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by vaccination status
amongst residents aged 65 years and over, from LTCFs enrolled in the VIVALDI study. The analysis period started
from the date of first vaccination in the cohort (8 December 2020) and ended at the date of last data extraction (15
March 2021). Residents were eligible for inclusion if they had at least two PCR test results in total, and ≥ 1 PCR result
during the analysis period. Residents entered the risk period on 8 December 2020 if they had ≥ 1 valid PCR result on or
prior to that date; or, if they had no PCR results before 8 December 2020, on the date of their first negative PCR test.
Residents with a positive PCR result ≤ 90 days before 8 December entered the risk period 90 days after their positive
test. Residents exited the risk period at the earliest of the following events: positive PCR test; date of second
vaccination, last available PCR test.
We conducted a sensitivity analysis removing individuals who were never vaccinated despite having a PCR test more
than 30 days following the date of first vaccination in their LTCF to account for potential bias from systematic
differences in clinical or other features of this group.
Outcome
The primary outcome was time to first positive PCR test, indicating SARS-CoV-2 infection, within the analysis period.
Exposures
Vaccination status was included as a time-varying covariate using the following exposure categories: unvaccinated, and

0-6 days, 7-13 days, 14-20 days, 21-27 days, 28-34 days, 35-48 days, and 49 or more days following the first dose of
either vaccine.
Covariates
Positive PCR results from before the analysis period, and positive anti-Nucleocapsid antibody results prior to
vaccination, were combined into a binary variable for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. The average monthly incidence of
SARS-CoV-2 infection in the surrounding area to each LTCF was estimated by averaging weekly incidence rates in the
corresponding local authority. Bed capacity was defined as the total number of beds in each LTCF, as reported in
Capacity Tracker or directly by LTCFs. The mean cycle threshold (Ct) value for each PCR-positive test was calculated
by taking the mean of the available Ct values from up to 3 gene targets (Nucleocapsid, ORF1ab, Spike) for each sample
(Table S1).
Statistical Analysis
We used Cox proportional hazards models to derive hazard ratios for the risk of first PCR-positive test in the study
period, comparing post-vaccination exposure categories to the unvaccinated group, with 95% confidence intervals (CI)
calculated using robust standard errors to account for the non-independence of infection events within LTCFs. The
baseline hazard was defined over calendar time. We adjusted for sex (as a binary variable), age (as a cubic spline term),
evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (as a binary variable), LTCF bed capacity (as a linear term), and average
monthly SARS-CoV-2 incidence rate for the local authority in which the LTCF was located (as a linear term). In
secondary analyses we explored vaccine effects stratified by type of vaccine (ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2) and by
evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our stratified analyses were conducted by including an interaction term
between the time varying exposure status and the stratifying factor. We calculated vaccine effectiveness as 1 – the
adjusted hazard ratio for infection. We used two-tailed t-tests to estimate the difference in mean Ct values between
unvaccinated and vaccinated groups.
All analyses were pre-specified in a statistical analysis plan and were conducted in Stata version 16·0 (StataCorp, 2019,
TX, USA).
Sample Size and Power Considerations
Sample size for the VIVALDI study was based on the precision of estimates for antibody prevalence, 21 therefore a
priori sample size calculations were not performed for this analysis.
Ethical Approval
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the South Central - Hampshire B Research Ethics Committee, Ref:
20/SC/0238.
Role of the Funding Source
The funder had no role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation or writing of the report.

Results
A total of 10,412 care home residents aged ≥65 years from 310 LTCFs were included in this analysis (Table 1). The
median age was 86 years (IQR 80-91), 7,247 (69·6%) were female, and 1,155 residents (11·1%) had evidence of prior
SARS-CoV-2 infection (194 seropositive, 1,013 PCR-positive). Overall, 9,160 (88·0%) residents had received at least
one vaccine dose, of whom 6,138 (67·0%) received ChAdOx1 and 3,022 (33·0%) received BNT162b2. 897 participants
had also received a second vaccine dose and the median dose interval was 63 days (IQR 55-65).
Data were available from 228 for-profit and 72 not-for-profit chain Providers, and 10 independent Facilities (Table 2),
with a median LTCF capacity of 48 beds (IQR 40-63). Most (>75%) included LTCFs had commenced resident
vaccinations by 16 January 2021 and completed most of these within two days. LTCFs which mainly used ChAdOx1
(>75% vaccinations) tended to be slightly smaller than Facilities that mainly used BNT162b (median bed capacity 47,
IQR: 38-61 versus 51, IQR: 42-64); they also started vaccinations slightly later (19 versus 7 January 2021).
Between 8 December 2020 and 9 March 2021, there were a total of 36,352 PCR results in 670,628 person days (54·2
PCR tests per 1,000 person days) (Table 3). The vast majority of PCR results (36,144, 99·4%) were completed as part
of routine testing and the median number of PCR tests per resident per month was 1·6 (IQR 1·2-2·2). Of 1,335 positive
PCR tests, 1,128 were from routine testing (84·5%) (Table 1). The crude infection rate per 10,000 person days at risk
was 19·9 overall and 21·4 within the unvaccinated group (Table 3). In vaccinated residents the infection rate reduced to
9·7 and 9·4 per 10,000 person days at 28-34 and at 35-48 days post-vaccination, respectively.
In Cox regression comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated groups and adjusting for age, sex, prior infection, LTCF bed
capacity, and local incidence of infection, there was no significant reduction in the adjusted hazard ratios for PCRpositive infection until 28-34 days post-vaccination (aHR 0·44; 95% CI 0·24, 0·81) (Table 3). At 35-48 days, the
adjusted hazard ratio was similar at 0·38 (95% CI 0·19, 0·77). At 49 or more days, the estimates were much less precise
and no longer significantly different to the unvaccinated group (aHR 0·49, 95% CI 0·20, 1·17). In this adjusted model,
prior infection was strongly associated with a reduced hazard of subsequent infection (aHR 0·19, 95%CI 0·12, 0·30).
Ct values were available for 1,070 (80·1%) of PCR-positive tests, from 13 laboratories using 6 different validated
assays (Table S1). The mean Ct value of 552 PCR-positive tests from the unvaccinated group was 26·6. While no
difference was seen when compared with the 411 PCR-positives from between 0-27 days post-vaccination (mean Ct
26·9, p=0·158), the mean Ct value of the 107 PCR-positives occurring 28+ days post-vaccination was significantly
higher (mean Ct 31·3, p<0·001) (Figure 2; Table S2). A sensitivity analysis limited to a single assay with the most
available results gave the same finding (Table S3).
Secondary analyses
The adjusted hazard ratios for infection after ChAdOx1 vaccination were 0·33 (95%CI 0·16, 0·68) at 28-34 days, and
0·32 (95%CI 0·15, 0·66) at 35-48 days post-vaccination; while after BNT162b2 vaccination they were 0·47 (95%CI
0·20, 1·06) at 28-34 days, and 0·35 (95%CI 0·17, 0·71) at 35-48 days post-vaccination (Table 4; Figure 2). A reduced

risk of PCR-positive infection was seen in the early post-vaccination period (0-13 days) in residents who received
ChAdOx1 (0-6 days: aHR 0·51, 95% CI 0·26-0·99; 7-13 days: aHR 0·58, 95%CI 0·35, 0·96) but not BNT162b.
The risk of PCR-positive infection was substantially lower in unvaccinated residents with prior infection compared to
unvaccinated residents who had not been previously infected (aHR 0·12, 95% CI 0·04-0·35) (Table S4). When
compared against unvaccinated residents with no prior infection, unvaccinated residents with prior infection had a
significantly lower hazard of infection (aHR 0·12, 95%CI 0·04, 0·35). Amongst those with prior infection, there was no
evidence to suggest that a single dose vaccination further reduced the risk of PCR-positive infections at any time point
(Table S5).
Sensitivity analysis
Our sensitivity analysis excluded residents who were never vaccinated despite vaccination occurring in their LTCF, to
remove any potential bias due to differences in likelihood of vaccination and risk of exposure, and to explore the effect
of herd immunity. 439 (12·0%) of 1,252 never-vaccinated residents had at least one PCR result available >30 days
following the date of first vaccination in their LTCF (Table S6), indicating that they remained unvaccinated while other
residents were being vaccinated. Removing this group from the analysis reduced the adjusted hazard ratios for infection
to 0·29 (95%CI 0·13, 0·63) at 28-34 days following the first dose of vaccination, compared to the unvaccinated group
(Table S7).

Discussion
In this large cohort study of more than 10,400 LTCF residents from across England, single dose vaccination with
ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 was associated with a substantially reduced risk of PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection from
28 days, and this effect was maintained for at least 7 weeks. We estimated vaccine effectiveness to be 56% (19-76%) at
28-34 days, and 62% (23-81%) at 35-48 days. We have only evaluated the effect of the first dose of each vaccine, but
our findings constitute the first evidence on the real-world effectiveness of the ChAdOx1 vaccine. Additionally,
whereas most trials and observational studies have addressed vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, we
show that vaccination reduces the total number of infections (asymptomatic and symptomatic) in frail older adults, and
thus transmissibility. An effect of vaccination on transmissibility is further supported by the finding of higher Ct values,
implying lower potential for transmission from residents with post-vaccination breakthrough infections compared to
unvaccinated residents.

Older adults with comorbidities and frailty have largely been excluded from SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials, despite the
potential for attenuated vaccine responses due to age-related changes in adaptive immune function. While the evidence
on immunogenicity of BNT162b2 in older adults is mixed,24–26 pooled data from four ChAdOx1 trials, including over
950 participants aged ≥70 years, indicated VE of 63·9% (46-75·9%) against all infection at 22-90 days following a
single dose,17 which is in line with our findings. The only available data in LTCF residents, from a Danish observational

study, suggests that a single dose of BNT162b2 is ineffective in preventing infection,27 however participants received
the second vaccine dose 24 days following the first dose on average, which, based on our findings, is likely too short to
capture the protective effects of a single vaccine dose. Two other observational studies report VE from adults aged over
70-80 years, and report similar or slightly higher estimates from 28-34 days,15,16 although results are not directly
comparable to our findings as these studies examine VE against symptomatic infection and hospitalisation only, due to
the lack of routine testing outside health and care settings.

We observed reduced hazards of infection in the immediate post-vaccination period (0-13 days) for ChAdOx1, which
cannot be attributed to protective effects of the vaccine but may be because recently vaccinated LTCFs were less likely
to have ongoing outbreaks of infection. Guidance on risk assessment-based deferral of vaccination in LTCFs with
active outbreaks was introduced at the end of December 2020,28 and this is likely to have disproportionately affected
LTCFs predominantly using ChAdOx1, which was deployed later. A similar effect has been observed following single
dose vaccination in healthcare workers,29 which was attributed to vaccine deferral due to COVID-19 illness. The impact
of vaccination deferral on our estimates of VE could not be ascertained because deferral decisions were not routinely
recorded and are likely to have varied between settings.

We identified 439 individuals in our cohort who remained unvaccinated despite vaccine roll-out within their LTCF. It
is likely that at least a subset of these individuals were receiving end-of-life care, but this cannot be confirmed without
accessing primary care records, which were not available for this study. These residents had substantially lower rates of
PCR-positive infection than the wider never vaccinated group; consequently, sensitivity analysis excluding this group
increased the estimates of vaccine effectiveness to 76% (aHR 0·24, 95%CI 0·09, 0·63) at 35-48 days post-vaccination.
This may be attributable to lower risk of exposure in this group, or it may be the result of a broader herd immunity
effect following vaccination in the LTCF.

Strengths and Limitations
A major strength of our analysis is that we were able to access high-quality routine data for a large, well-defined cohort
of LTCF residents who were tested regularly for SARS-CoV-2 throughout follow-up. This allowed us to estimate the
impact of vaccination on all infections, in contrast to trials and most observational studies which have focused on
symptomatic infections. The analysis period coincided with the second wave of the pandemic, making it possible to
estimate vaccine effectiveness against infections in the context of rapid emergence of the highly transmissible B.1.1.7
variant. Our cohort included a range of LTCF types therefore we expect these findings to be generalisable across LTCF
resident populations. Regarding limitations, as vaccines were rolled out rapidly in LTCFs in England and most resident
vaccinations were completed over 1-2 days, we did not attempt to quantify indirect vaccine effects attributable to herd
immunity. We were also unable to assess the proportion of LTCFs that deferred vaccination due to outbreaks. Though it
is likely that we have underestimated prior infection due to low rates of PCR testing in the first wave of the pandemic,
given that prior infection appears highly protective against reinfection we would expect this to attenuate our overall
vaccine effectiveness estimates. In addition, we considered Ct values, which correlate with the ability to isolate virus, 30

to be indicative of infectivity. Although it is challenging to compare Ct values across different assays, all results
targeted the same genes (N, ORF1ab, S), and similar findings were obtained in sensitivity analysis based on a single
assay. Future analyses should also consider outcomes such as hospital admission and mortality, although treatment
escalation decisions in the context of end-of-life care are likely to influence vaccination and COVID-19 outcomes.

Conclusions
Single dose vaccination with either ChAdOx1 or BNT162b reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 in frail older residents of
LTCFs. Our findings suggest that vaccination also impacts on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility by reducing the total
number of infections in residents, as well as their infectivity. The protective effect of a single dose of vaccination is
evident from 4 weeks to at least 7 weeks post-vaccination, which provides some evidence to support extension of the
dose interval beyond 3 weeks, in line with UK policy. Further work is required to evaluate the effectiveness of the
second dose of the vaccine, and the direct and indirect effects of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection and
transmission. This knowledge will be critical to informing policy decisions regarding re-vaccination schedules in this
vulnerable population, and the short, medium and long-term disease control measures needed to protect LTCFs from
future waves of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

*Adjusted hazard ratios were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards regression model with an interaction term between vaccination status and prior infection status; the
comparator is the unvaccinated group with evidence of prior infection. Hazard ratios are adjusted for age, sex, local monthly infection incidence, LTCF bed capacity, and for estimates
from the group with evidence of prior infection. 95% confidence intervals were calculated using robust standard errors for LTCF-level effects.

*Adjusted hazard ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression according to days since the first vaccine dose for each vaccine type (ChAdOx1 and BNT162b2);
the comparator was the unvaccinated group. Hazard ratios are adjusted for age, sex, local monthly infection incidence, and LTCF bed capacity; 95% confidence intervals were
calculated using robust standard errors for LTCF-level effects.
