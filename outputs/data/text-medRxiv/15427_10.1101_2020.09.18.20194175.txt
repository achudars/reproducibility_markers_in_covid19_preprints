Summary
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is driven by dysregulated immune responses yet the role of
immunometabolism in COVID-19 pathogenesis remains unclear. By investigating 47 patients with
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and 16 uninfected controls, we found an immunometabolic
dysregulation specific for patients with progressed disease that was reversible in the recovery phase.
Specifically, T cells and monocytes exhibited increased mitochondrial mass, accumulated intracellular
ROS and these changes were accompanied by disrupted mitochondrial architecture. Basigin (CD147),
but not established markers of T cell activation, was up-regulated on T cells from progressed COVID19 patients and correlated with ROS accumulation, reflected in the transcriptome. During recovery,
basigin and ROS decreased to match the uninfected controls. In vitro analyses confirmed the
correlation and showed a down-regulation of ROS by dexamethasone treatment. Our findings provide
evidence of a basigin-related and reversible immunometabolic dysregulation in COVID-19.

Introduction
In February 2020 Zhu and colleagues described a novel coronavirus named 2019-nCoV detected in
patients with pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China (Zhu et al., 2020, Huang et al., 2020).
Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes COVID-19, an
illness of varying degrees. The vast majority of COVID-19 cases presents with a mild or a moderately
symptomatic infection. However, a subset of individuals progress to develop a severe disease and
there is increasing evidence that critical cases are driven by dysregulated host immune responses to
SARS-CoV-2 infection allowing virus persistence, causing lung damage and systemic inflammation (De
Biasi et al., 2020, Hadjadj et al., 2020, Lee et al., 2020). Infectious diseases change metabolic processes,
e.g. in infected cells to support viral replication or in immune cells fighting the infection. Recently Codo
and colleagues reported that Sars-CoV-2-infected monocytes up-regulate glycolysis and elevated
glucose levels support viral replication and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (Codo et al., 2020).
These data suggest a link between cellular metabolism and systemic host metabolism for disease
progression. In line, patients with type 2 diabetes have a greater risk of developing severe disease
(Ayres, 2020). Obesity, together with age, is the major risk factor for diabetes, hyperglycemia and
dyslipidemia that can result in an imbalance in T cell sub-populations (de Candia et al., 2019).
Accordingly, high-fat diet strongly affects T cell metabolism and function, supporting a proinflammatory T cell phenotype (Mauro et al., 2017). Interestingly, systemic metabolic changes were
observed in COVID-19 patients (Song et al., 2020) and metabolic treatment with cholesterol lowering
drugs such as statins can reduce COVID-19 mortality (Zhang et al., 2020).
T cells are central players in adaptive immunity and are essential for controlling viral infections
including SARS-CoV-2 (Le Bert et al., 2020). To initiate an immune response, pathogen-specific T cells
need to activate and to expand. This is accompanied by an extensive metabolic reprogramming and
activated T cells increase expression of nutrient transporters such as glucose transporter GLUT1 and
enzymes involved in glycolysis (Geltink et al., 2018). Furthermore, effector T cells contain higher
numbers of mitochondria than naive cells (Ron-Harel et al., 2016). Mitochondria produce ATP via
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and are important for cellular processes such as apoptosis (RonHarel et al., 2016) and antiviral defenses (Seth et al., 2005). Besides nutrients, OXPHOS requires
oxygen, which is often limiting in patients with COVID-19 (Couzin-Frankel, 2020). Extraordinarily low
blood-oxygen levels are often found in infected patients and thus immune cells experience hypoxia
and may induce hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) such as HIF-1a, a transcriptional effector of the hypoxic
response. Some studies showed HIF-1a functions as a negative regulator of T cell responses and that
O2 is required for T cell effector functions (McNamee et al., 2013). To preserve energy production and
effector functions, T cells experiencing low O2 and glucose levels can enhance fatty acid catabolism as
an metabolic escape mechanism (Zhang et al., 2017).
Reduced oxygen saturation and hypoxia lead to generation and accumulation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) by mitochondria (Jezek et al., 2018). Oxidative stress plays an important role in the
pathogenesis of viral infections and sepsis, and it has been suggested that COVID-19 pathogenesis is
also related to hypoxia and oxidative stress (Laforge et al., 2020). As mitochondrial superoxide leads
to an aberrant T cell development, Case et al suggested that manipulations of mitochondrial
superoxide levels may significantly alter clinical outcomes of patients with viral infections (Case et al.,
2011). Based on this hypothesis, ongoing studies include COVID-19 patients treated with antioxidant
drugs such as vitamin C to prevent ROS-induced damage and suppression of antiviral T cells (Cavezzi
et al., 2020).
Hypoxia, mitochondrial impairment and the associated generation of ROS have been shown to stabilize
CD147 expression (De Saedeleer et al., 2014). CD147, also called basigin or extracellular matrix
metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), is a transmembrane glycoprotein interacting with several
extracellular and intracellular partners and can mediate the entry of various viruses (Pushkarsky et al.,

2001, Vanarsdall et al., 2018, Watanabe et al., 2010), possibly also for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Chen
et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2020). In contrast to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the established
SARS-CoV receptor (Radzikowska et al., 2020), basigin is broadly expressed in different cell types and
tissues (Chen et al., 2005, Muramatsu, 2016). Intriguingly, SARS–CoV proteins do not directly interact
with basigin. Instead, the N protein of SARS–CoV binds to cyclophilins (Cyp), which are basigin ligands
(Chen et al., 2005). In addition, cyclophilin A (CypA) plays a critical role in the viral replication and Cyp
inhibitors such as cyclosporine A (CsA) can block virus replication (Tanaka et al., 2013). Interestingly,
CypA is a leukocyte chemoattractant and increased levels of extracellular CypA have been documented
in inflammatory diseases (Bukrinsky, 2015). Given the roles of basigin and Cyp in viral diseases, a
clinical trial investigated the impact of basigin blocking by Meplazumab, a humanized anti-CD147
antibody and reported improved outcome of patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia (Bian et
al., 2020). Basigin is weakly expressed on naïve T cells but up-regulated on activated cells. Based on
this finding, ABX-CBL, an immunoglobulin M murine monoclonal anti-CD147 antibody was successfully
used in a trial with patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (Deeg et al., 2001).
Apart from its role for virus entry, basigin tightly associates with GLUT1, the amino acid transporter
CD98, the lactate transporters (monocarboxylate transporter/MCT 1, 3 and 4) and CD44 and is
recognized by lectins, such as galectin-3 and E-selectin (Muramatsu, 2016). These molecular
interactions explain the central role of basigin in energy metabolism, cell motility and activation.
However, basigin deficient mice are more active in mixed lymphocyte reactions, indicating the
suppressive role of basigin on T cell activation which might be related to the inhibition of nuclear factor
of activated (NFATs) in T cells (Hahn et al., 2015). In addition, basigin suppresses NOD2, an important
innate immunity component (Muramatsu, 2016).
Metabolic features of immune cells strongly determine the outcomes of an immune response and a
variety of publications reported dysregulated innate and adaptive immune pathways in COVID-19
patients.
Therefore, we studied immune cell metabolism of COVID-19 patient subgroups with different degrees
of disease severity with or without pre-existing metabolic comorbidities. Our data show T cell
metabolic changes in mitochondrial mass, architecture and ROS production as well as in fatty acid
uptake in the course of disease that are (1) not related to classical activation markers, (2) stage specific,
(3) basigin-related and (4) reversed in recovering patients to reach levels of healthy controls. Our data
suggest that immunometabolic dysregulation contributes to the dysfunctional T cell response in
COVID-19 patients.

Results
Altered T cell and NK cell distribution in COVID-19 patients
COVID-19 has previously been associated with changes in the peripheral blood immune compartment
(Lucas et al., 2020, Zhou et al., 2020, Qin et al., 2020). Here we analyzed peripheral blood immune cell
populations from age-matched non-infected controls (“control“ group), asymptomatic and mildly
symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects (“no symptoms/mild” group), moderately ill (“moderate”),
severely to critically ill patients (“severe/critical” group) and patients recovering from a severe/critical
COVID-19 (“recovering” group). Classification details and patient characteristics can be found in the
methods section and in Table 1. Blood counts revealed no significant changes in immune cell
frequencies in COVID-19 patients with progressed disease even though lymphocytes were decreased
by trend (Table 1).
Fresh samples were not subject to any manipulation such as mononuclear cell enrichment or
cryopreservation. Multi-parameter flow cytometry was performed to discriminate cells based on
expression of CD14/CD11b (monocytes) and CD16+/- (monocyte subsets), CD66b/CD11b
(granulocytes), CD56 (NK cells), CD3 (T cells), T cell subsets expressing CD4, CD8 and FOXP3, CD19 (B
cells) and CD19/CD38/IgA/IgM/IgG (plasmablasts) (Figure 1A). The frequencies of monocytes,
including CD16+ and CD16- monocyte subpopulations (Figures 1B and S1A), granulocytes (Figure 1C)
and FOXP3+ CD4+ T cells (Figure 1D) were not significantly altered in COVID-19 patients. However,
patients in the severe/critical group showed low NK cell and T cell frequencies and these changes
persisted in recovering patients (Figure 1E,F). While a decrease in T cells has been described for
patients with progressed SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections (Lucas et al., 2020, Li et al., 2004), we
observed lower frequencies of T cells already in the group of COVID-19 patients with moderate
symptoms (Figure 1F). Notably, patients with fatal disease showed the lowest number of T cells and
NK cells. Further analyzing T cell subsets, similar CD8+ and CD4+ T cell frequencies were observed in
the severe/critical group, as compared to control subjects. However, patients from the moderate
group presented a shift towards CD8+ T cells (Figure 1G). To study the dynamics of T cell changes in
the severe/critical group, we clustered paired samples according to the time after the onset of
symptoms. While CD8+ T cells increased and CD4+ T cells decreased during the first phase of infection
in most patients, an opposite trend was observed during the second phase (Figure S1B). Lastly,
studying the peripheral blood B cell compartment, we observed a prominent increase both in bulk
(Figure 1H) as well as in IgA+ and IgG+, but not IgM+ plasmablasts in SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects
(Figure 1I). In addition, plasmablast formation, marked by decreased frequency of CD20+ B cells, was
observed in critically ill COVID-19 patients during the hospital stay (Figure S1C).
Collectively, altered NK and T cell frequencies, skewed T cell subset distribution and plasmablast
induction were observed in COVID-19 patients.
T cells from progressed COVID-19 patients show high expression of basigin, but are not infected with
SARS-CoV-2
In addition to immune cell sub-population frequencies, the activation state might determine the
clinical outcome of viral diseases. Therefore, the activation and differentiation state of T cells and
monocytes was assessed in COVID-19 patients and control subjects. While CD8+ T cells but not CD4+
T cells from patients in the severe/critical group showed a trend towards increased CD25 expression
(Figure 2A), no differences were observed for PD-1 expression. Nevertheless, patients with fatal
disease showed a trend to cluster in PD-1-high T cell subpopulations (Figure 2B). No differences were
detected in CCR7 expression in both T cell subsets (Figure 2C). Studying HLA-DR expression on
monocytes, we observed a trend towards a decrease in the severe/critical group and all deceased
patients clustered in a severe/critical subgroup with low monocyte HLA-DR expression (Figure S2A).

No differences were observed when studying HLA-DR expression of CD16+ and CD16- monocyte
subpopulations (Figure S2B).
CD147 (basigin, also known as EMMPRIN) has been previously suggested as a marker of T cell activation
but also as a negative regulator of T cell proliferation (Kasinrerk et al., 1992, Supper et al., 2016, Hahn
et al., 2015, Hu et al., 2010). As opposed to PD-1, CD25 and CCR7, both bulk T cells (Figure 2D) and
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subtypes (Figure 2E,F) showed an increased expression of basigin in patients with
progressed COVID-19. Interestingly, while altered T cell frequency persisted in recovering patients
(Figure 1F and S2C), T cell basigin expression decreased in patients during recovery from COVID-19 to
levels comparable with uninfected control subjects (Figures 2D-F and S2D,E). Monocytes showed high
basal basigin expression but in contrast to T cells, the levels were similar among the studied groups
(Figure 2G). Similarly, no differences in basigin expression were observed in granulocytes (Figure 2H).
In concert with cyclophilin (Pawlotsky, 2020), basigin can mediate the entry of human coronaviruses
(Chen et al., 2005). Accordingly, cyclophilin targeting drugs can inhibit coronavirus replication (CarbajoLozoya et al., 2014, Tanaka et al., 2013) and an anti-basigin antibody is being evaluated for COVID-19
therapy (Bian et al., 2020). Therefore, we measured plasma cyclophilin A and observed elevated levels
in the severe/critical group as compared to control samples, while recovering patients showed a
decrease in cyclophilin concentrations (Figure 2I). We next assessed, whether immune cells might have
been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Published data from A549 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (BlancoMelo et al., 2020) indicated a high amount of detectable viral RNA, which further increased if cells
were transfected to express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Cell sorting and subsequent RNA
sequencing however revealed no evidence for SARS-CoV-2 infection of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells or CD14+
monocytes of critically ill COVID-19 patients or healthy donors (Figure 2J).
Collectively, basigin, but not the established markers of T cell activation and differentiation, was
strongly up-regulated on T cells from progressed COVID-19 patients and decreased during recovery.
Despite increased basigin expression and high cyclophilin A plasma levels, immune cells from COVID19 patients were likely not infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Glucose and fatty acid uptake by immune cells distinguishes COVID-19 patient subgroups
Increasing evidence points to basigin as a regulator of cellular metabolism as it tightly associates with
monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), transporters for glucose (GLUT) and amino acids (CD98), likely
coordinating glucose and amino acids metabolism (Muramatsu, 2016). In addition, basigin signaling
can inhibit fatty acid metabolism via modulation of PPARα (Li et al., 2015). Therefore, the capacity of
T cells and myeloid cells from COVID-19 patients to take up glucose, fatty acids and the expression of
the amino acid transporter CD98 was assessed next in fresh patient samples.
The glucose uptake capacity of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as of CD11b+ myeloid cells did not differ
among the studied patient groups (Figure 3A). Similarly, T cell expression of CD98 was similar among
the patient groups (Figure S3A). T cell glucose uptake capacity was highly variable between COVID-19
patients and we asked whether patient pre-existing comorbidities contribute. Diabetes and obesity are
associated with unfavorable COVID-19 prognosis (Ayres, 2020) and we observed decreased CD3+ T
cell, but not myeloid cell counts in patients with pre-existing diabetes and/or obesity (Figure 3B).
Interestingly, these patients also showed a decreased glucose uptake capacity of T cells and myeloid
cells compared to controls (Figure 3C), while a separation of patients according to cardiovascular
disease or age did not show significant differences in immune cell glucose uptake (Figures 3D and S3B).
Immune cells of diabetic COVID-19 patients might compensate low glucose uptake with increased fatty
acid metabolism. However, no differences in fatty acid uptake were detected in patients with diabetes
(Figure S3C). Interestingly, regardless of comorbidities, we observed an increased fatty acid uptake in
T cells from patients with no or mild symptoms (Figure 3E). Although T cell fatty acid uptake in the
severe/critical group was low, a clustering of paired samples according to the time after the onset of
symptoms revealed an increase of T cell fatty acid uptake between day 0 and 40 (Figure S3D). While

myeloid cells did not show an increase in the none/mild group, patients from the severe/critical group
presented a strong decrease in fatty acid uptake, with deceased patients being the lowest (Figure 3F).
Patients from the none/mild group showed increased T cell fatty acid uptake and we next assessed the
dynamics of this metabolic phenotype after complete disease resolution. Fatty acid uptake of CD4+
and CD8+ T cells as well as of their respective subsets was analyzed in three COVID-19 patients from
one family with mild symptoms over the course of 7 weeks after the onset of symptoms (Figure 3G).
Interestingly, the capacity of T cells to take up fatty acids decreased over time. Notably, this
phenomenon occurred 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms, and was observed in bulk CD8+ and CD4+
T cells as well as in major T cell subpopulations (Figures 3H and S3E).
Taken together, immune cells from COVID-19 patient subgroups were characterized by different
capacities to take up nutrients. While metabolic comorbidities affected immune cell glucose uptake
capacity, increased T cell fatty acid uptake was a hallmark of COVID-19 patients with no or mild
symptoms and decreased during convalescence.
ROS accumulation in T cells from progressed COVID-19 patients is reversible and correlates with
disrupted mitochondrial architecture and expression of ROS-inducible and basigin-related genes
T cells from patients with viral or malignant diseases can enter a state of metabolic exhaustion with
decreased nutrient uptake, accompanied by accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Siska et
al., 2017, Bengsch et al., 2016). We observed low nutrient uptake in freshly analyzed immune cells
from critically ill COVID-19 patients, suggesting a similar immunometabolic state. While basigin has
been associated with increased cellular metabolic activity (Muramatsu, 2016), metabolic stress and
reactive oxygen species (ROS) can also induce and stabilize basigin expression (De Saedeleer et al.,
2014). In line, we observed a correlation of T cell basigin expression with levels of intracellular ROS in
COVID-19 patients (Figure 4A). Moreover, patients in the severe/critical group showed high T cell ROS
levels that significantly decreased in convalescence, suggesting an immunometabolic recovery (Figure
4B). While high basal levels of ROS and basigin were observed in CD14+ myeloid cells, these parameters
did not correlate (Figure 4C) and myeloid cell ROS levels were not significantly elevated in patients in
the severe/critical group (Figure 4D). Similarly, ROS levels in neutrophils were comparable between all
patient groups analyzed (Figure 4E). Dysregulation of cellular redox homeostasis is a hallmark of
mitochondrial dysfunction (Jezek et al., 2018). Analyses of the mitochondrial content of T cells and
myeloid cells from COVID-19 patients revealed a mitochondrial mass increase in the severe/critical
group in T cells and monocytes (Figure 4F,G). In contrast to glucose uptake, neither ROS nor the
mitochondrial content of T cells were related to a pre-existing comorbidity (Figure S4A,B). To correlate
the observed metabolic phenomena with mitochondrial morphology, electron microscopy of
peripheral blood mononuclear cells from critically ill COVID-19 patients was performed. In line with
the observed increase in mitochondrial mass and ROS accumulation, mitochondria of lymphoid cells
from COVID-19 patients were enlarged and showed a disrupted cristae architecture as compared to
control lymphocytes (Figure 4H).
To validate the observations from the single cell studies, RNA sequencing of T cells and monocytes
from COVID-19 patients (three severe/critical patients; two recovering patients) and healthy controls
(four individuals) was performed. Samples were enriched for mononuclear cells and cryopreserved
prior to flow cytometry sorting. CD4+ T cells from COVID-19 patients from the severe/critical group
showed significantly increased expression of 49 genes, while 9 genes were down-regulated (Figure
5A). Besides genes associated with immune signaling and function such as GAB2, BCL3 and SOCS3, the
expression of SLC16A1 (MCT1), which closely associates with basigin, was increased in CD4+ T cells
from COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, CD4+ T cells from COVID-19 patients showed increased
expression of furin, that was recently reported to activate SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020) (Figure
5B). Utilizing the gene set enrichment approach (Liberzon et al., 2015), CD4+ T cells from COVID-19
patients showed a significant enrichment of genes associated with ROS, genes coding for basigin

interaction partners and genes related to TNF signaling (Figures 5C and S5). CD14+ monocytes showed
a COVID-19 specific up-regulation of 174 genes (Figure 5D), yet the expression of SLC16A1, furin and
several other CD4+ T cell specific genes was not increased. However, genes involved in metabolism
such as PPARG or GLUL were increased as well as HIF1A, suggestive for a response to hypoxia (Figure
5E). Indeed, transcripts of hypoxia related genes were strongly enriched in monocytes from COVID-19
patients in addition to genes related to TNF signaling (Figure 5F).
Collectively, in addition to low nutrient uptake, T cells from progressed COVID-19 patients showed a
metabolic dysregulation with increased mitochondrial mass, altered mitochondrial morphology and
accumulation of ROS. Transcriptome analyses showed an increased T cell expression of ROS-related
genes and basigin interaction partners and suggested a response to hypoxia by monocytes.
T cell receptor stimulation induced ROS accumulation in COVID-19 basigin-high T cells is reversible
through dexamethasone treatment
We observed an association of basigin expression and accumulation of intracellular ROS in T cells from
COVID-19 patients in the severe/critical group. To assess, whether external factors contribute, we
cultured mononuclear cells from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls in vitro in medium containing
the antioxidant 2-mercaptoethanol. In addition, cultured cells were treated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28
coated beads to mimic an in vivo T cell receptor activation. While uncultured COVID-19 T cells showed
elevated ROS and basigin levels, a six-day in vitro culture without stimulation lead to a normalization
as compared to control cells. Furthermore, activation strongly induced ROS and basigin in T cells and
both parameters correlated at the single cell level (Figures 6A and S6A).
Therapeutic approaches for COVID-19 are still limited. Nevertheless, recent data suggest that
dexamethasone treatment improves the survival of critically ill COVID-19 patients (Group et al., 2020).
Dexamethasone is a potent modulator of immune cell responses and lymphocyte metabolism
(Eberhart et al., 2011, Serrano et al., 1993) and we tested, whether in vitro dexamethasone treatment
can revert the T cell metabolic phenotype hallmarked by high basigin expression. Ex vivo T cell basigin
expression varied strongly (Figure 2D) and we next tested, how COVID-19 T cells with high or low basal
basigin levels (Figure S6B) respond to dexamethasone. While dexamethasone did not affect T cell
activation in terms of CD25 expression (Figures 6B and S6C) or interferon-γ production (Figure 6C), it
prevented intracellular ROS accumulation in T cells from COVID-19 patients with high basal basigin
expression, but not from control subjects or patients with normal T cell basigin levels (Figures 6D-F
and S6D).
Thus, T cell receptor stimulation induced ROS accumulation, accompanied by basigin up-regulation in
T cells from COVID-19 patients and controls. Treatment with dexamethasone decreased T cell ROS
accumulation specifically in T cells from patients with high basal basigin levels. Collectively, progressed
COVID-19 is associated with increased T cell basigin expression, and a metabolic dysregulation
hallmarked by ROS accumulation that is reversed during recovery or through pharmacologic
modulation in vitro (Figure 6G).

Discussion
It is now clear, that the role of cellular metabolic pathways goes beyond energy production.
Intriguingly, immune cell metabolism can steer immune cell function and thereby affect the outcome
of inflammation (O'Neill et al., 2016). Here we studied the composition, phenotype and metabolism of
immune cells in COVID-19 patients and describe a T cell metabolic phenotype with high accumulation
of reactive oxygen species (ROS), elevated mitochondrial content, but dysregulated mitochondrial
morphology. These changes were accompanied by increased expression of basigin. In the context of
COVID-19, CD147/basigin has mainly been discussed to interact with SARS‐CoV-2 and to serve as an
additional infection route but not as marker for metabolically impaired immune cells (Xia and
Dubrovska, 2020). This is surprising as basigin is a metabolic hub and is central for the regulation of
cell metabolism. It is highly expressed on a variety of cells, tightly associates with the lactate
transporters monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) and is essential for their cell surface translocation
and activities. Basigin also associates with other metabolic proteins including GLUT1 and CD98 (Hahn
et al., 2015, Muramatsu, 2016). Here we describe for the first time a correlation between high ROS
and basigin levels which suggests basigin as marker for a metabolically dysregulated T cell phenotype
in COVID-19 patients. The analysis of established activation markers on T cells and myeloid cells did
not reveal any significant changes in COVID-19 patients and we observed only a trend towards
increased expression of the T cell activation and exhaustion markers CD25 and PD-1.
The role of basigin in SARS-Cov-2 entry is possibly based on its function as receptor for cyclophilins
(CypA), which bind to SARS-CoV proteins thereby allowing virus entry (Chen et al., 2005, Pawlotsky,
2020). In line, CypA inhibitors such as cyclosporine A (CsA) can block virus replication (Tanaka et al.,
2013). Even though we detected high CypA levels, especially in critically ill patients, we found no
significant traces of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in monocytes or T cells from COVID-19 patients. These data
however do not exclude SARS-Cov-2 entry in immune cells in vitro as it has been shown by Codo et al
(Codo et al., 2020) or in other cell types such as endothelial cells.
The same authors showed elevated mitochondrial ROS and HIF-1a expression in monocytes from
COVID-19 patients. Monocyte HIF-1a expression was also increased in our study and we found a
hypoxia-related gene set enrichment in monocytes but not T cells. Nevertheless, we detected highly
increased cytosolic ROS levels and a ROS-related gene set enrichment in T cells of critically ill patients.
But what is the cause of oxidative stress in T cells? COVID-19 patients can suffer from extensive hypoxia
(Huang et al., 2020) and COVID-19 pathogenesis is most likely related to hypoxia which can lead to
superoxide radical and peroxide generation by mitochondria. In line, COVID-19 T cells showed an
increased mitochondrial content but a disturbed morphology with elongated mitochondria and
disrupted cristae indicating impaired mitochondrial function, probably leading to ROS production.
Mitochondrial impairment and the associated generation of ROS have been shown to stabilize CD147
expression (De Saedeleer et al., 2014), which might explain the strong correlation between ROS levels
and basigin expression in T cells. Notably, the upregulation of basigin membrane levels in T cells was
not reflected by our RNAseq analyses which is in line with data from by DeSaedeleer et al showing that
ROS stabilizes basigin posttranslationally (De Saedeleer et al., 2014).
High basigin levels may lead to suppressed T cell function and proliferation as basigin deficient mice
are more active in mixed lymphocyte reaction (Hahn et al., 2015). Furthermore, the related high ROS
levels could induce cell death (Hildeman et al., 2003) possibly explaining the reduced T cell numbers in
COVID-19 patients which were described here and by others (Lucas et al., 2020, Qin et al., 2020).
Severely and critically ill patients were also characterized by low NK cell numbers and increased
numbers of B cell blasts. However, our data indicate that immune cell reactivity and metabolism rather
than frequency might dictate the outcome of inflammation in COVID-19 patients. In contrast to T cell
lymphopenia, the immuno-metabolic dysregulation with high ROS and basigin levels was reversed in

the early recovery phase, where severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients improve and are no longer
ventilated, indicating that hypoxia may be one important underlying factor for disease outcome.
Interestingly, T cell frequencies were significantly lower in diabetic and/or obese patients and T cells
and myeloid cells of these patients exhibited decreased glucose uptake. In contrast, cardiovascular
disease or age had no impact on T cell numbers and glucose uptake, suggesting an interplay between
systemic and T cell metabolism in patients with metabolic disorders. Given the high levels of systemic
inflammation the findings of low glucose and fatty acid uptake by T cells and myeloid cells were
unexpected, especially as hypoxia can promote fatty acid uptake (Zhang et al., 2017). Increased fatty
acid uptake was only found in T cells from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with none or mild symptoms
compared to critically ill patients. Interestingly, T cell fatty uptake capacity did not decrease until four
weeks after the onset of symptoms, thus reaching beyond the time point of infection resolution. We
speculate that disturbed mitochondrial function in severely ill patients may prevent fatty acid
degradation, thereby reducing fatty acid uptake.
Our data support the hypothesis that COVID-19 pathogenesis is related to hypoxia and oxidative stress.
Besides ROS in lymphocytes, neutrophils of critically ill patients with COVID-19 may produce ROS to
drive pathological host responses as it has been recently proposed by Laforge and colleagues (Laforge
et al., 2020). They suggested that ROS-induced tissue damage, thrombosis and red blood cell
dysfunction could be targeted with free radical scavengers. Such an approach could also ameliorate T
cell function and is currently tested in an ongoing study treating COVID-19 patients with antioxidant
drugs such as vitamin C (Cavezzi et al., 2020).
Importantly, the clinical use of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone is beneficial for COVID-19 patients
(Group et al., 2020) but its mechanisms of action are not yet fully understood and its effects on immune
cells are broad. Besides its widely established role as immunosuppressant, dexamethasone can
support T cell viability (Franchimont et al., 2002). Surprisingly, in our experiments, treatment with
dexamethasone was effective in preventing intracellular ROS accumulation without affecting
activation and cytokine production in expanded T cells of COVID-19 patients. We therefore propose
that the effects of dexamethasone in COVID-19 patients are at least partially due to an
immunometabolic modulation. Future studies should address if other agents specifically targeting T
cell metabolism could improve the outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients.
Another treatment option might be a direct targeting of basigin. Meplazumab, a humanized anti‐
CD147 antibody, inhibited SARC‐CoV-2 replication (Wang et al., 2020). According to the preliminary
report on the clinical trial study NCT04275245, meplazumab improved the outcome of patients with
COVID‐19‐associated pneumonia with a favorable safety profile (Bian et al., 2020). Importantly, basigin
blockade does not only target the virus replication but also attenuates T cell chemotaxis induced by
CyPA (Lv et al., 2018) and can therefore inhibit COVID‐19‐associated inflammation. CyPA itself could
also be a promising target structure as increased CyPA levels were detected in the severe/critical
COVID-19 patients that decreased in the convalescence. Thus, CyPA might also be involved in
dysregulated inflammation in COVID-19 patients. Replication of coronaviruses and several other
viruses requires cyclophilins which can be targeted by the established immunosuppressant cyclosporin
A (CsA), which, in addition to targeting calcineurin, blocks cyclophilin (Tanaka et al., 2013).
Furthermore, Alisporivir, a non-immunosuppressive derivative of CsA also limits the replication of
human coronavirus HCoV-NL63 (Carbajo-Lozoya et al., 2014).
We propose here that hypoxia and ROS induce immune cell basigin expression, contributing to
metabolic dysfunction and a dysregulation of inflammation in COVID-19 patients. Even though future
mechanistic studies will test this hypothesis, cellular basigin expression and cyclophilin blood levels
might serve as both prognostic parameters and therapeutic targets in COVID-19. Furthermore, our
study strengthens the rationale for the use of agents that reduce oxidative stress in COVID-19 therapy.

Methods
Study participants
This study involved 61 subjects consisting of 45 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection,
detected in a nasopharyngeal swab or a respiratory sample using routinely established RT-PCR (Table
1) and 16 uninfected controls. The study was approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board
(University Hospital Regensburg, No. 20-1785-101) and conformed to the principles outlined in the
Declaration of Helsinki. Included were all patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 testing, excluded was one
patient with first-diagnosis of leukemia. Controls were asymptomatic healthy individuals with age
median of 46.7 (IQR 37.25-46.7) and male sex in 47%. Disease severity was assessed as described
previously (Song et al., 2020, Hadjadj et al., 2020). Briefly, none/mild cases presented with no or mild
symptoms and no pulmonary infiltrate; moderate cases presented with respiratory symptoms such as
cough and/or shortness of breath and a pulmonary infiltrate; severe/critical cases included patients
with persistent tachypnea >30/min, blood oxygen saturation <93%, rapid progress of pulmonary
infiltrates within 24 hours, respiratory failure or requirement for mechanical ventilation. Clinical,
laboratory, treatment and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records using
standard procedures and confidentiality measures. Routine testing included a differential blood count
and biochemical tests. Antibody response was defined by presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG
antibodies in serum.
Sample collection and processing
All whole-blood samples analyzed for immune cell frequencies and single cell metabolic assays were
analyzed freshly without cryopreservation. Blood was collected using Lithium-Heparin-Tubes (Sarstedt,
Nümbrecht, Germany). For ACK lysis, samples were divided in 1 ml portions and incubated for 5 min in
20 ml ACK buffer 1X (6X: 0.155M NH4Cl, 0.01M KHCO3 and 0.1 mM EDTA), afterwards 30 ml of PBS
were added, centrifuged (5 min, 523G) and supernatant was discarded. Lysis was repeated using 10 ml
ACK and 20 ml PBS per sample. If erythrocytes were still visible in the pellet, a third lysis step (5 ml ACK
and 20 ml PBS) was performed and finally cells were washed in 20 ml PBS. Finally, cells were counted
in 5 ml PBS + 2 % FCS using the CASY Cell Counter system (Cursor Setting: CL 6.50 µM, NL 4.50 µM, CR
30 µM, NR 30 µM). For in vitro culture assays, blood samples were processed using the Ficoll gradient
centrifugation and mononuclear cells were cryopreserved until analysis. After thawing, cells were
cultured in complete RPMI medium (Gibco), supplemented 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), with or
without the addition of anti-CD3/anti-CD28 coated beads (Gibco), with or without 100 nM or 500nM
Dexamethasone (Jenapharm) which was dissolved in medium.
Determination of immune cell populations
For analysis of surface marker expression, 0,2-1x106 cells/tube were stained with respective surface
markers (see list of antibodies below). For determination of regulatory T cells intracellular FOXP3
expression was measured using the Intracellular Fixation and Permeabilization Buffer Set according to
manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher). In brief, after surface marker staining (anti-CD3, antiCD4), intracellular unspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with 2 % rat serum for 15
minutes and subsequently, intracellular staining (anti-FOXP3) was performed.
Single cell metabolic assays
Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined after surface marker staining (anti-CD3,
anti-CD11b, anti-CD14, anti-CD66b), using 10 µM 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (Sigma, D6883) in
a cell culture incubator 37° for 20 minutes in closed tubes. Cells were washed once with 3 ml cold PBS
and measured immediately. Mitochondrial content was assessed by staining with Mitotracker Green
FM. Cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mM L-Glutamine and treated with 15
nM Mitotracker and Cyclosporine A for 1 hour under cell culture conditions. Afterwards, surface

staining was performed. Glucose and fatty acid uptake was measured using the fluorescent glucose
analog 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]-2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-NBDG) and BODIPY
500/510 C1, C12 dye (both Thermo Fisher). Cells were stained with surface antibodies as described
above and incubated in with 2-NBDG (45 min) or BODIPY 500/510 C1, C12 (20 min). Fluorescence of
selected immune cell subpopulations was measured by flow cytometry.
Electron microscopical analyses
For transmission electron microscopic analyses, cell pellets were fixed in Karnovsky-fixative and
enclosed with 4% low-melting-agarose (Invitrogen, Germany). For the embedding process including
post-fixation with osmium tetroxide, dehydration, infiltration with EPON (all reagents from EMS,
Science Services, Germany) the LYNX microscopy tissue processor (Reichert-Jung, Wetzlar, Germany)
was used. Semi-thin-sections (75µm), for the selection of relevant areas, and ultra-thin sections (80nm)
for the ultrastructural analyses were cut by use of the Reichert Ultracut S Microtome (Leica-Reichert,
Wetzlar, Germany). Ultra-thin-sections were contrasted with aqueous 2%-uranyl-acetate- and 2%lead-citrate solution for 10 minutes each. The Electron-microscopic analysis was performed using the
LEO 912AB electron-microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).
Cell sorting and RNA-seq library preparation
For RNASeq experiments, cryopreserved PBMC were thawed and stained with anti-CD3, anti-CD4, antiCD8 and anti-CD14. Live, single cells with leukocyte FSC/SSc characteristics were sorted into
CD14+CD3- monocytes, CD14-CD3+CD4+CD8- CD4 T cells and CD14-CD3+CD4-CD8+ CD8 T cells by fourway sorting on a BD FACSAria IIu (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). Sorted cells were
centrifuged and further processed for RNASeq immediately. Total cellular RNA was isolated from
sorted blood cells using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) according with manufacturer’s instructions. RNA
was quantified using the NanoDrop (peqLab) and the quality was assessed using the RNA ScreenTape
Kit (Agilent). Generation of dsDNA libraries for Illumina sequencing was carried out using the SMARTSeq Stranded Kit (Takara Bio) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The quality of dsDNA libraries
was checked with the High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape Kit (Agilent) and concentrations were
determined with the Qubit dsDNA HS Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sequencing was performed using
the Illumina NextSeq550 sequencer.
RNA-seq analysis
Sequencing reads were mapped to human (GRCh38) or viral (SARS-CoV-2, NC_045512.2) genome using
STAR v2.5.3a (Dobin et al., 2013). SARS-CoV-2 infection of A549 cells was performed and published by
Blanco-Melo et al (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020). The human GRCh38 genome index incorporated gene
annotation from GENCODE 44 (release 27) to aid in spliced alignment. Tables of raw uniquely mapped
read counts per human gene were generated during mapping using the built-in --quantMode
GeneCounts option in STAR. Differential expression analysis was carried out on raw gene counts using
edgeR 3.20.8 (Robinson et al., 2009) in R (3.4.3). Pairwise comparisons of indicated data sets were
done using the quasi-likelihood test. Heatmaps of differentially expressed genes shown in Figure 5
used batch-corrected, normalized and scaled CPM (counts per million) data and were generated using
the heatmap.2 function of the gplots package in R. Volcano plots were generated using the ggplot2
(v3.1.0) package in R. The rank-based gene set enrichment tests in Figure 5 were done using the fry
function of the limma package (Ritchie et al., 2015) and plotted using the barcodeplot function in R.
Gene-sets were defined in the hallmark gene set collection (Liberzon et al., 2015) and basigin
interaction partners were defined by STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2019).

Cyclophilin A plasma levels
Cyclophilin A levels were determined in plasma samples by a commercially available enzyme‐linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA, Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Statistics
GraphPad Prism was used for statistical analyses, using ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni test and
Mann-Whitney U test. For paired ANOVA analyses with missing values, mixed-effects model with the
Geisser-Greenhouse correction was used. Significance levels were *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.
Correlations were computed using the Spearman correlation test. Statistical tests used for clinical
parameters: Kruskal-Wallis (age), chi-squared test nach Pearson (all categorical variables), students ttest (ferritin), one-way ANOVA (leukocytes and all other laboratory values).

Figure S1. Maintained monocyte but
altered T cell subpopulation
distribution in COVID-19 patients.
Blood of donors was drawn and
processed on the same day.
Erythrocytes were removed by ACK
lysis and immune cell populations
were determined by specific surface
marker staining and subsequent
analysis by flow cytometry. (A)
Percentage of CD16- and CD16+ cells
among CD14+CD11b+ monocytes
was determined. Shown is the
median, each symbol represents one
donor. Frequencies of CD8+ and
CD4+ T cell subpopulations (B) and
CD20+ B cells (C) are shown in paired
patient samples over time and
clustered to groups determined by
the number of days after the onset of
symptoms.

Figure S2. Preserved HLA-DR expression on monocytes but increased basigin expression,
reduced during recovery, on T cells of progressed COVID-19 patients.
Blood of donors was drawn and processed on the same day. Erythrocytes were removed by
ACK lysis and immune cell populations were stained for population-specific surface markers.
HLA-DR expression as an indicator for MHC-II surface expression was analyzed on CD14+
monocytes (A) and the respective CD16- and CD16+ (B) subpopulations. Shown is the median,
each symbol represents one donor. Frequencies of CD3+ T cells (C) and basigin expression on
CD3+ T cells (D) and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subpopulations (E) were analyzed in paired patient
samples taken at the intensive care unit (ICU) and after returning to normal care unit. Shown
are paired patient samples (paired Student’s t-test).

Figure S3. CD98 expression, glucose
and fatty acid uptake by immune
cells of COVID-19 patients.
Blood of donors was drawn and
processed on the same day.
Erythrocytes were removed by ACK
lysis and expression of surface
molecules or nutrient uptake of
immune cell populations was
determined by flow cytometry. (A)
CD98 surface expression was
analyzed in all groups. Shown is the
median, each symbol represents one
donor. (B) Comparison of 2NBDG
uptake in CD11b+ myeloid cells of
patients in relation to cardiovascular
disease or age. Shown is the median,
each symbol represents one donor.
(C) BODIPY 500/510 C1, C12 uptake
as a measure of fatty acid (FA) uptake
in CD4+, CD8+ T cells and CD11b+
myeloid cells of diabetic and/or
obese patients versus non-diabetic
and/or obese patients. Shown is the
median, each symbol represents one
donor. (D) FA uptake in CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells of paired patient
samples over time, with clustering of
samples into groups according the
number of days after the onset of
symptoms. (E) Analysis of FA uptake
in CD4+ T cells from 3 patients of one
family with mild COVID-19 over time.
Shown is the mean and SEM of values
normalized to the first blood sample
drawn (Mixed-effects model with the
Geisser-Greenhouse correction, with
Bonferroni's multiple comparisons
test, *p<0.05).

Figure S4. Increased ROS levels and mitochondrial
content are not related to diabetes and/or obesity,
cardiovascular disease or age.
Blood of donors was drawn and processed on the same
day. Erythrocytes were removed by ACK lysis and
immune cell populations were stained for populationspecific surface markers. (A) Cytosolic ROS level in
CD3+ T cells, determined by DCFDA staining and
analyzed by flow cytometry, was correlated to preexisting diabetes and/or obesity, cardiovascular
disease or age. (B) Mitochondrial content in CD3+ T
cells, determined by mitotracker staining and analyzed
by flow cytometry, in relation to diabetes and/or
obesity, cardiovascular disease or age.

Figure S6. Activation induced ROS accumulation in COVID-19 T cells is
reversible through dexamethasone treatment.
Mononuclear cells were isolated from controls or COVID-19 patients
from the severe/critical group and cryopreserved until analysis. (A)
ROS and basigin levels were determined in CD8+ T cells of controls and
severe/critically ill patients before and after a 6 days culture in medium
containing 2-mercaptoethanol with or without anti-CD3/anti-CD28
stimulation. Shown are median levels and a single symbol for each
donor (paired Student’s t-test, *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001). (B)
Basal basigin expression on CD3+ T cells, also depicted as Figure 2D.
(C,D) Mononuclear cells of controls and COVID-19 patients with high
and low basal basigin expression, as pre-defined in (B) were antiCD3/anti-CD28 stimulated for six days in the presence or absence of
increasing concentrations of dexamethasone (100 nM, 500 nM) and
percentage of CD25+CD8+ T cells (C) and cytosolic ROS levels,
determined by DCFDA staining (D), were assessed. Shown are paired
samples from each donor, represented by a symbol (one-way ANOVA,
Bonferroni multiple comparisons test, *p<0.05, **p<0.01).
