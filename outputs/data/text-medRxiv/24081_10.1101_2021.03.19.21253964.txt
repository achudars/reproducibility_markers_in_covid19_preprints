SUMMARY:
What is already known about this topic?
Diagnostic tests and sample types for SARS-CoV-2 vary in sensitivity across the infection
period.
What is added by this report?
We show that both RTqPCR (from nasal swab and saliva) and the Quidel SARS Sofia FIA rapid
antigen tests peak in sensitivity during the period in which live virus can be detected in nasal
swabs, but that the sensitivity of RTqPCR tests rises more rapidly in the pre-infectious period.
We also use empirical data to estimate the sensitivities of RTqPCR and antigen tests as a
function of testing frequency.
What are the implications for public health practice?
RTqPCR tests will be more effective than rapid antigen tests at identifying infected individuals
prior to or early during the infectious period and thus for minimizing forward transmission
(provided results reporting is timely). All modalities, including rapid antigen tests, showed >94%
sensitivity to detect infection if used at least twice per week. Regular surveillance/screening
using rapid antigen tests 2-3 times per week can be an effective strategy to achieve high
sensitivity (>95%) for identifying infected individuals.
INTRODUCTION:
Frequent rapid diagnostic testing is critical for restricting community spread of SARS-CoV-2 by
allowing the timely identification and isolation of infected individuals to interrupt the chain of
transmission. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR)-based
detection of viral RNA within nasal swab or saliva samples represents the gold standard for
sensitivity in detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2, yet supply shortages, cost, and
infrastructure limitations have made it difficult to achieve high testing frequency and volume with
the rapid reporting of results needed to mitigate transmission effectively.
Recently, there has been considerable interest in the potential of rapid antigen tests to expand
diagnostic testing capacity due to the ease of use, availability, cost, and rapid time-to-results1.
However, data for their use in screening asymptomatic individuals is sparse. Enthusiasm for
their widespread deployment has been further tempered by well-publicized examples of false
positive results in people with low pre-test probability of infection, and by reports suggesting
they lack sensitivity compared with RTqPCR, potentially making them less effective at mitigating
community spread2,3.
Here, we compare the sensitivities of nasal and saliva RTqPCR tests with the Quidel Sofia
SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay (FIA) over the course of mild or asymptomatic acute
SARS-CoV-2 infection through daily sampling of individuals enrolled early during infection.
METHODS:
This study was approved by the Western Institutional Review Board, and all participants
consented freely.
Participants
All on-campus students and employees of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are
required to submit saliva for RTqPCR testing every 2-4 days as part of the SHIELD campus
surveillance testing program. Those testing positive are instructed to isolate, and were eligible to
enroll in this study for a period of 24 hours following receipt of their positive test result. Close

contacts of individuals who test positive (particularly those co-housed with them) are instructed
to quarantine and were eligible to enroll for up to 5 days after their last known exposure to an
infected individual. All participants were also required to have received a negative saliva
RTqPCR result 7 days prior to enrollment.
Individuals were recruited via either a link shared in an automated text message providing
isolation information sent within 30 minutes of a positive test result, a call from a study recruiter,
or a link shared by an enrolled study participant or included in information provided to all
quarantining close contacts. In addition, signs were used at each testing location and a website
was available to inform the community about the study.
Participants were required to be at least 18 years of age, have a valid university ID, speak
English, have internet access, and live within 8 miles of the university campus. After enrollment
and consent, participants completed an initial survey to collect information on demographics and
health history, including suspected date of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. They were then provided
with sample collection supplies.
Participants who tested positive prior to enrollment or during quarantine were followed for up to
14 days. Quarantining participants who continued to test negative by saliva RTqPCR were
followed for up to 7 days after their last exposure. All participants’ data and survey responses
were collected in the Eureka digital study platform.
Sample collection
Each day, participants were remotely observed by study staff collecting:
1. 2 mL of saliva into a 50mL conical tube.
2. 1 nasal swab from a single nostril using a foam-tipped swab that was placed within a dry
collection tube.
3. 1 nasal swab from the other nostril using a flocked swab that was subsequently placed
in a collection vial containing viral transport media (VTM).
The order of nostrils (left vs. right) used for the two different swabs was randomized. For nasal
swabs, participants were instructed to insert the soft tip of the swab at least 1 cm into the
indicated nostril until they encountered mild resistance, rotate the swab around the nostril 5
times, leaving it in place for 10-15 seconds. After daily sample collection, participants completed
a symptom survey. A courier collected all participant samples within 1 hour of collection using a
no-contact pickup protocol designed to minimize courier exposure to infected participants.
Saliva RTqPCR
After collection, saliva samples were stored at room temperature and RTqPCR was run within
12 hours of initial collection. The protocol for direct saliva-to-RTqPCR assay used has been
detailed previously4. In brief, saliva samples were heated at 95°C for 30 minutes, followed by
the addition of 2X TBS at a 1:1 ratio (final concentration 1X TBE) and Tween-20 to a final
concentration of 0.5%. Samples were assayed using the Thermo Taqpath COVID-19 assay.
Quidel assay
Foam-tipped nasal swabs were placed in collection tubes and stored at 4°C overnight based on
guidance from the manufacturer. The morning after collection, swabs were run through the Sofia
SARS antigen FIA on Sofia 2 devices according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Collection tubes containing VTM and flocked nasal swabs were stored at -80°C after collection
and were subsequently shipped to Johns Hopkins University for RTqPCR and virus culture
testing. After thawing, VTM was aliquoted for RTqPCR and infectivity assays. One ml of VTM
from the nasal swab was assayed on the Abbott Alinity per manufacturer’s instructions in a
College of American Pathologist and CLIA-certified laboratory.
Nasal virus culture
VeroTMPRSS2 cells were grown in complete medium (CM) consisting of DMEM with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Gibco), 1 mM glutamine (Invitrogen), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 100
U/ml of penicillin (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin (Invitrogen)5. Viral infectivity was
assessed on VeroTMPRSS2 cells as previously described using infection media (IM; identical to
CM except the FBS is reduced to 2.5%)6. When a cytopathic effect was visible in >50% of cells
in a given well, the supernatant was harvested. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed
through RTqPCR as described previously by extracting RNA from the cell culture supernatant
using the Qiagen viral RNA isolation kit and performing RTqPCR using the N1 and N2 SARSCoV-2-specific primers and probes in addition to primers and probes for human RNaseP gene
using synthetic RNA target sequences to establish a standard curve7.
Data Analysis
At the time of analysis, nasal samples from 30 participants had been analyzed by virus culture
and RTqPCR. Therefore, analyses that consider either nasal RTqPCR or viral culture results
were conducted based on a limited participant set. All confidence intervals around sensitivity
were calculated using binconf from the Hmisc package in R version 3.6.2.
The sensitivity of each of the tests was analyzed in three different ways:
First, the ability of each test (antigen, saliva RTqPCR, or nasal RTqPCR) to detect an infected
person on a particular day relative to the day of first positive viral culture (“daily sensitivity”) was
calculated. Daily sensitivity was not calculated for timepoints with fewer than 5 observed
person-days.
Second, the ability of each test to detect an infected person according to their viral culture status
(“status sensitivity”) was calculated. Viral culture status was defined as “pre-positive” on days
prior to the first positive viral culture result, “positive” on days for which viral culture results were
positive, and “post-positive” on days with negative viral culture results that occur after the first
positive culture result. Status sensitivity was defined as the proportion of person-days with a
positive result.
Finally, we calculated the ability of repeated testing over a 14-day period to detect an infected
person (“protocol sensitivity”) using a value-of-information approach. Seven different testing
frequencies were considered: daily, every other day, every third day, and so on, up to weekly
sampling. For each individual, the result of testing on a given schedule was calculated for each
potential starting date, with test results interpreted in parallel (all tests must be negative to be
considered negative). For instance, each person contributed two observations to the “every
other day” schedule, one starting on the first day of the study and the other starting on the
second day of the study. The proportion of “observations” with a positive result (at least one
positive test in the sampling timeframe) was considered to be the sensitivity of that testing
protocol (test and frequency combination).

We first estimated the daily sensitivities of nasal and saliva RTqPCR and antigen tests relative
to the day of first nasal swab viral culture positivity, which was used as a surrogate marker of
infectious virus shedding (Table 2, Figure 1). We also used the viral culture data to measure
the status sensitivities of each test before, during, and after viral shedding (Figure 2).
Prior to the first day of detectable shedding of infectious virus, both RTqPCR tests had higher
daily sensitivity (0.706 for both saliva and nasal) than the antigen test (0.412). For all three
tests, daily and status sensitivity peaked during days in which infectious virus shedding was
detectable, as would be expected. Antigen test daily sensitivity declined precipitously after
infectious virus could no longer be detected in nasal swabs, dropping below 0.5 within a week
after the onset of culture positivity, while both nasal and saliva RTqPCR platforms only showed
minor decreases in sensitivity, remaining at 0.792 and 0.667 after a week, respectively.

We next estimated the protocol sensitivities, or how the ability of each of test platform to detect
infected individuals was affected by differences in testing frequencies (Table 3, Figure 3).
Protocol sensitivity was defined at the schedule level, where the numerator is the number of
testing schedules resulting in at least one positive test and the denominator is the number of
testing schedules examined, where a testing schedule is defined as a set of samples from one
participant taken at a given frequency. In Figure 3, we calculated the effects of varying testing
frequency on sensitivity to detect infected individuals on days where nasal swabs were viral
culture positive in the top panel. In the bottom panel of Figure 3, we examined sensitivity to
detect infected individuals at any stage of infection.

Discussion
Our data demonstrate that the sensitivities of RTqPCR and antigen tests vary significantly over
the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Prior to the presumed infectious period (here defined as
the period during which infectious virus could be detected in nasal swab samples), the daily
sensitivities of nasal and saliva RTqPCR tests were higher than that of the Quidel Sofia SARS
Antigen FIA, suggesting that RTqPCR tests will be more effective at identifying infected
individuals before they transmit to others.
Both RTqPCR and antigen tests peak in daily and status sensitivities when infectious virus is
detectable in nasal swab samples, suggesting that all three modalities can be effective at

identifying individuals during the presumed infectious period. After this period, the daily
sensitivity of RTqPCR tests decreased gradually, with saliva RTqPCR dropping faster than
nasal RTqPCR. These dynamics are consistent with those described previously for RTqPCR8,9.
In contrast, the daily sensitivity of the antigen test declined very quickly, suggesting that this test
will be less effective at identifying individuals during later stages of infection. This may limit
diagnosis and contact-tracing efforts in test-limited environments.
Previous studies have suggested that frequent testing would maximize the ability of a given test
modality to detect infected individuals10,11. We found that all testing modalities showed almost
95% protocol sensitivity to detect infection if used at least twice per week. When applied weekly,
protocol sensitivity remained very high for nasal RTqPCR, declined slightly to 90% for saliva
RTqPCR, and dropped to only 76% for the antigen test.
When we compared the abilities of different testing frequencies to identify individuals while
infectious virus was detectable in nasal samples, we observed a clear reduction in protocol
sensitivity for all testing modalities when testing frequencies decreased below daily. The
reduction in protocol sensitivity was most pronounced for the antigen test, which dropped to
0.72 with testing every fourth day, however, both RTqPCR tests were only slightly better at 0.74
(saliva) and 0.77 (nasal). Altogether, these data demonstrate the importance of frequent testing
regardless of test modality for identifying individuals while they are contagious.
This is the first study to compare the longitudinal performance of rapid antigen and RTqPCR
tests with infectious virus shedding in a well-defined population early in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
We found that all three diagnostic tests demonstrated a high degree of daily sensitivity during
the presumed infectious period, but that the RTqPCR tests exhibited superior daily sensitivities
prior to this period. Our data suggest that RTqPCR tests can be more effective than antigen
tests at mitigating community spread of SARS-CoV-2, but only if the turnaround time for
RTqPCR results is short. Finally, these data also quantitatively demonstrate the importance of
frequent (at least twice per week) screening to maximize likelihood of detecting infected
individuals regardless of testing modality.
