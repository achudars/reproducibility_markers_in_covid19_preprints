Abstract
The paper provides new evidence from a survey of 2000 individuals in the US and UK
related to predictors of Covid-19 transmission. Specifically, it investigates work and personal
predictors of transmission experience reported by respondents using regression models to
better understand possible transmission pathways and mechanisms in the community. Three
themes emerge from the analysis. Firstly, transport roles and travelling practices are
significant predictors of infection. Secondly, evidence from the US especially shows union
membership, consultation over safety measures and the need to use public transport to get to
work are also significant predictors. This is interpreted as evidence of the role of deprivation
and of reactive workplace consultations. Thirdly and finally, there is some, often weaker,
evidence that income, car-owership, use of a shared kitchen, university degree type, riskaversion, extraversion and height are predictors of transmission. The comparative nature of
the evidence indicates that the less uniformly stringent nature of the US lockdown provides
more information about both structural and individual factors that predict transmission. The
evidence about height is discussed in the context of the aerosol transmission debate. The
paper concludes that both structural and individual factors must be taken into account when
predicting transmission or designing effective public health measures and messages to
prevent or contain transmission.

Work-related and Personal Predictors of COVID-19 Transmission
1.Introduction

Potentially, preventing the transmission of COVID-19 related to work and amongst the poor,
saves lives while contributing to other economic and social priorities. A large amount of
scientific research has focussed on patterns of spread and underlying mechanisms of
transmission but as economies and societies reopen, it is important to know more about the
role of workplace and personal factors as predictors of transmission.[1-2] Heightened risks
implied by spatial patterns [3] and attached to certain work-roles have emerged as important
but there are many aspects of employment and consumption activities that are likely to
contribute to transmission that have barely been researched. In addition, and closely
connected, there is a growing body of knowledge about personal factors that contributes to
mortality but (with the exception perhaps of ethnicity) only a smaller amount of literature of
personal traits and circumstances relating to transmission risk within community settings.[45].
To limit the spread of the virus, it is therefore important to study work-related and personal
factors that contribute to or could limit the spread of the virus. This paper therefore reports on
the development of data relating to a new set of diverse workplace and personal factors. More
specifically, using a survey of 2000 working age adults in the US and UK, the paper
estimates regression models in which work, personal factors and a range of demographic
controls are used to predict experience of Covid-19. Both countries are examples of highincome market economies are distinct from others in two ways. Unlike some Asian countries,
they do not have recent similar infection-spread experiences on which to draw and unlike
many European countries, they do not have civil law traditions based on a ‘strong’
conception of the state. Yet the US and UK differ in the extent and manner in they provide
access to health care and welfare support. Furthermore, the US has experienced a lockdown
that has varied significantly between states.
For these two countries, the paper draws on a new database related to estimate regression
models of transmission experience. The dataset contains several variables related to
transmission experience while the analysis focuses on the possession of a medical diagnosis
or positive test self-reported by the respondent. Analysis for the US provides evidence of
infection risk related to transport related employment, working with reduced earnings,
belonging to a union, workplace consultation about safety measures, being on a zero hours
contract and having to use public transport to go to work are significant predictors. At the
personal level, controlling for race and age, being in the lower income groups, having a
shared kitchen, a quantitative university degree, using cash to pay and car ownership are also
significant predictors of infection diagnosis and positive tests. (There is also some evidence
in pooled univariate analysis that the probability of infection is related to other variables
including risk preference and extraversion.) Results for the UK are less statistically
significant but generally similar qualitatively probably due to the more uniform nature of its
lockdown.
Three emerging themes for public health, individual behaviour and research are discussed. (i)
Transport as an employment setting or mechanism for getting to work is a predictor of
transmission and so safety in such contexts should be prioritised. (ii) Features of the
workplace and employment are also significant predictors of transmission within the
community and there is therefore a need for a much fuller understanding of work and
commuting measures so that public health and economic perspectives and priorities can be

more fully integrated. (iii) A diverse range of personal attributes and circumstances predict
infection and relate both to behavioural and distributive issues. In some cases, the predictors
speak to issues of deprivation and poverty. In one case, the impact of height, even after
controlling for income and sex, may also be relevant for the recent debate about droplet and
aerosol transmission. In any case, these personal differences should be taken into account
when designing public health measures, giving medical advice and designing labour market
policies.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 summarises the key variables and
statistical techniques used. Section 3 carries the main results while section 4 discusses these
results in community and policy contexts, some limitations and possibilities for follow-up
work.
2. Methods and Materials
Data
The database described below (and in the online materials) from which the variables are
drawn was developed during a period when general scientific pathways of transmission were
becoming more widely accepted but there was little evidence on some of the possible
predictors and mechanisms in US and UK communities. It provides a mix of standard and
novel data on a range of personal, work, home and community factors.
Personal Factors
This paper draws on personal variables related to risk-aversion, personality, university
degree, car ownership, sex, household income and the use of cash to make payments.
Ethnicity and age are also used as controls. See Table 1.
Insert Table 1 Here
To assess risk aversion, the survey contains a single question that has been used previously
and validated against other measures in economics.[6] Risk preference plays a central role in
the theorising of economic behaviour and it is reasonable to hypothesise that it also plays an
important role in transmission related behaviours. In addition, the database (see online
materials) includes information on personality, already connected to information and attitudes
about risk-taking,[7] and it was hypothesised that extraversion could also predict of
transmission. Extraverts are more likely than others to engage in social activity and the trait
was measured using two questions reverse coded from a widely used short form personality
battery.[8] Height has been associated both with health [9] and income and so the database
assesses also tallness which could potentially be a protective or a risk factor depending inter
alia on transmission patterns. If large downward falling droplets were more significant then
taller people might be expected to be less at risk. However, it has recently been argued that
aerosol (fine particle) transmission, important for influenza [10], may also be important for
the transmission of Covid-19 [11-12]. If overhead airflows did play a role early then, then
taller people might be at greater risk of infection. The use of cash to pay was noted as a risk
factor early on [10] as paper notes and coins are subject to sequential physical contact and a
variable on this is also included in the analysis.
Several other personal predictors are also available and included in the analysis. Sex and
ethnicity have been found to be risk factors for mortality [13-14] and may also be connected
to transmission. Working patterns or even feeling safe outside of a house alone may, for
example, cause some men to undertake activities outside the home and therefore be more at

risk of infection. On the other hand, the concentration of women in caring professions may
place some groups of women at greater risk. Ethnicity could work in similar ways if some
groups are disproportionately found in riskier jobs or more crowded residential areas. For the
purposes of this study sex age and ethnicity are used along side other demographic controls
discussed below.
Although involvement in lorry driving has also been implicated in the spread of Covid19,[15] car ownership might also be a significant protective factor if the use of private
transport enables individuals and family members to social distance for more of the time. To
the extent that safety is a good, household income is likely to be an indicator of a range of
omitted factors that impact risk such as living in a tower block or having access to a private
garden. Finally, a variable is included that indicates the frequency with which the individual
went outside the house prior to March (see online supplement). This is likely to be more
relevant for onsets that take place prior to the lockdown period.
Work Related Factors
A second set of predictors relate to work and commuting. The main workplace setting is
recorded in a variable with fifteen response categories. Some of these are already known to
contribute to transmission,[16] particularly those related to transport, though less is known
about others. In addition, there are two variables that record whether a person is forced to use
public transport to commute to work and whether they are able to work mainly from
home.[17] Both are risk factors although the sign on the ability to work from home is difficult
to assess a priori. On the face of it, the ability to work from home enables a person to avoid
social interactions at work and when commuting but it could for some be offset by additional
risks from household or local community contacts. For example, if working from home is
associated with greater use of small local shops where distancing is difficult as might be the
case in places like New York or London, then working from home could also be a risk factor
for some. At the time of variable development, unions in the UK were being reported in the
media for their advocacy of health and safety issues at work and few if any investigations to
date have studied the contribution of trades unions. Again there are several ways in which
union membership might come to predict transmission. Workplaces with effective union
advocates could have fewer cases of Covid-19 though alternatively, unionisation could be an
indicator of a workplace where larger group meetings are relatively easy or where high
workplace risks incentivise union membership.
Demographic and Houshold Controls
A third and final set subset of independent variables concerns factors that are home or
community related and used here as controls. One set of questions relate to whether a person
lives with children, parents or others. Those living alone might be expected to be less at risk
particularly during periods when mobility and activity outside the home are limited by
government rules. Alternatively, it could be that those who spend a large amount of time with
others at home could be at greater risk or that those living with parents take greater care and
so experience less infection on average. The data contains a variable on whether a person
spends more 90 mins or more of their time with others at home and has been used in analysis.
In addition, a variable that indicates whether a person lives alone or not is also constructed.
These predictors are used to estimate models of self-reported infection (whether a person had
a medical diagnosis or positive test). In addition, results for knowing others with Covid-19
and the ability to social distance are also reported.1

The dataset on which these variables draw was developed by a survey that took place over
the first week of June 2020. Samples of 1000 adults in the US and UK were obtained from a
professional survey company using quota sampling to obtain a national sample broadly
representative for those of working age with some oversampling to reflect contrasts of
interest. All survey recruitment and completion was done by electronic means (so via phones
or personal computers but not face-to-face meetings). Towards the end of the sampling
period some of the quotas were relaxed and the final distribution of socio-economic
characteristics of the US and UK samples can be found in Figure 1 and the online materials.
The company provides, ex post, a set of weights that can be used to construct nationally
representative results and these weights are used at various points. Respondents were paid a
small amount for completing the survey which took about 5 minutes on average to complete.
It is important to reiterate that survey responses are self reports and that said, overall reported
infection rates are comparable to those reported elsewhere for the UK [18] and US [19]
bearing in mind the predominance of early transmission experience. Those who became ill at
points closer in time to the survey were, plausibly, less likely to respond probably because
they were still ill. Selected descriptive statistics for each country are presented in Figure 1.
Insert Figure 1 Here
Methods
The outcome of primary interest was: a) a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (“Have you had
a medical diagnosis or positive test for COVID”). In addition, models were estimated for b)
knowing someone who was diagnosed with COVID-19 (“How many people do you know
who have had a medical COVID diagnosis, a positive test, or been to hospital with it”); and
c) having being able to socially distance (“Currently are you able to social distance when at
work/ commuting/ shopping/ neighbourhood/ transporting children: Yes-always, Mostly,
Sometimes, Never, not applicable”). Separate regression models for the USA and UK
samples were estimated, with area of residence modelled as fixed-effects for responders
within fourteen states in the US and four constituent countries (England, Scotland, Wales,
Northern Ireland or unknown) in the UK.
The exact model applied depends on the type of the outcome variable. For the first outcome,
confirmed diagnosis, a logistic model was estimated for a binary dependent variable equal to
one for those responders who self-declared to have a positive diagnosis of Covid-19. An
additional analysis used sample weights to allow generalisation of the survey result to the
population level. The second dependent variable was dichotomized to “none” against “one or
more”, and a logistic model was applied to the resulting binary categories, allowing us to
estimate the influence of demographic, household and workplace factors on the probability of
knowing someone with a positive Covid-19 diagnosis. Without dichotomization, the second
dependent variable is a multi-class nominal outcome; hence a multinomial logit was also
estimated for the second outcome, using none as the base category for comparison. A Poisson
regression model was used as a sensitivity but led to less satisfactory results. Finally, the third
outcome variable, which indicates ability to social distance, was calculated with an
aggregation over sub-domains: for each question, answers of “Yes-always” were coded as 1,
and all other answers were coded to zero; the individual answers were aggregated into a 5category scale for each respondent. Since the resulting third categorical outcome has an
implicit order (ranging from no social distancing at all to complete social distancing or no
exposure), an ordered logit model was estimated to evaluate the effects of demographic,

household and workplace factors on the cumulative probability of the individuals to keep
social distance.
4. Empirical Results
In Table 2, results are presented for several models of transmission experience. Variables
were selected and categories used based both on clinical or theoretical considerations and
univariate analysis (see online materials). Results for the pooled data are similar to those for
the US and so these are focussed on in the table. These results suggest that with demographic
controls, the probability of transmission depends on a diverse range of work and personal
predictors.
Insert Table 2 Here
Focussing on reported diagnosis and testing, it is evident that several of the work-related
variables, with the exception of being able to work from home, are statistically significant.
The same is true for some of the personal factors although risk-aversion and extraversion are
not as significant as in the univariate analysis. Being in either of the lowest household income
groups (ie less than $49,999 pa) is significant whereas none of the controls are. Other aspects
of transmission experience exhibit different patterns. For example, knowing others with
Covid-19 is significantly related to using a shared kitchen but also to the frequency of having
met others at work. The same is true for the ability to social distance – having to go to work
on public transport is a risk factor as with transmission but so too is being in the 35-54 age
group and in an intermediate risk work-setting.
One of the reasons why results in the UK might differ concerns the more uniform and
stringent nature of measures taken. As the purpose of lockdown is to disrupt patterns of
transmission that would exist otherwise, it would not be surprising to see weaker
associations. To consider the possibility, Table 3 presents similar models for the UK
estimated using data excluding those who first experienced symptoms in April and May and
therefore were likely to have contracted Covid-19 through social interactions prior to
lockdown. These results are presented in Table 3.
Insert Table 3 Here
It is interesting to note that being male and some types of transport employment are all
significant predictors of infection. Most work-related factors are not significant in the UK for
diagnosis but some are significant for knowing someone with Covid-19. Owning a car
predicts being able to social distance in the UK whereas it does not in the US.
4. Discussion
The models of transmission experience add to what is known about transmission in the
community[20-21] and confirm some qualitative similarities between transmission predictors
in two high income countries. However, the variations in policy response, particularly the
greater regional variation in the US lockdown, implies that US experience provides more
information about potential pathways for community transmission. A variety of work-related
factors are predictive of transmission though sometimes in ways that might not be obvious.
Having to go to work on public transport is positively related to transmission in both
countries but the effect is considerably stronger in the US. Moreover, union membership is a
significant predictor of risk. There are various reasons why this might be the case, as noted
above, but the data cannot distinguish between them. In both countries, consultation about

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.13.20152819; this version posted July 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

transmission reduction measures is positively related to infection and one interpretation is
that consultation during the period was more reactive than preventative. The fact that about
half of all respondents claim not to have been consulted about such measures is consistent
with the interpretation and suggests that safety promotion within the workplace could be
monitored and guided by public health and health and safety officials more closely.
Turning to personal factors, it is worth noting that some theoretically supported empirical
findings concerning risk aversion and extraversion in the univariate analysis are not
significant in the multivariate regression models. Conceptual overlaps as well as correlation
in observations may be giving rise to multi-collinearity (though in the main formal VIF tests
do not suggest this is a major problem). While not especially worrying from a prediction
perspective it is important for public health messaging to take these traits into account as they
suggest a need for tailored messaging and interventions. The fact that height is a significant
predictor for men suggests that downward droplet transmission may be less important than
aerosol transmission (particularly prior to lockdown) in which case the use of specifically
designed air purifiers should be further explored. Using a shared kitchen is also a significant
factor. While steps have been made in both countries to reduce the use of cash payments, for
example, less is known about any guidance or support for those, such as those on low
incomes, users of Airbnb, and students who often share kitchens, or other facilities. The
practice may be more prevalent than is supposed. It is also worth noting that having a
quantitative degree is also not an enabler of social distancing but rather a risk factor for
having a diagnosis or positive test. If most respondents held natural science degrees, then it is
possible that the natural science background caused respondents to be more willing to seek a
medical diagnosis or test. Aversions to testing might derive, therefore, from background
interests as well as costs and that too is something that might be factored into the design of
test and trace interventions.
While this study adds some novel variables and evidence to the understanding of community
transmission within the US and UK, several limitations should be mentioned. In the first
place, it would be useful to have larger sample sizes particularly for observations referring
substantially to behaviour in a lockdown period. In addition, it would be helpful to have
repeated observations so that more could be said about changes over time as well as
causality: indeed, it would be useful to have patient or lay input into the development of a
fuller set of predictors based on possible causal mechanisms. Furthermore, it was not possible
to audit responses. Finally, this study was not designed to engage strongly with the issues of
race as they have emerged. The database contains mainly those who report first onset of
symptoms early on, possible because those still ill were less inclined to participate in surveys.
The higher levels of infections of Whites in the survey is consistent with a pattern of
infection in which more affluent population members are exposed first to spread via
international sources from Europe and elsewhere, while internal transmission then proceeded
more rapidly amongst the poor often at greater risk and less able to take avoidance measures.
These limits aside, the study implicates transport related employment and travel in various
ways with transmission risk, identifies novel employment related predictors of infection risk,
and provides evidence of ways in which personal traits, circumstances and behaviours impact
on transmission experience. This is as far as we know one of it not the first study to
investigate a range of work and personal predictors of Covid-19 transmission risk
comparatively in the US and UK. If similar work and related activity data were collected
routinely along with other medical data, it should be possible to identify types of settings

where transmission is most likely to take place. This in turn could help refine the preventative
measures taken or advised.

***p-value < 0.01, **p-value < 0.05, *p-value < 0.10. Standard errors in brackets below each estimated coefficient. Number of observations (n) = 904
Diagnosis: logit estimated for the question “Have you had a medical diagnosis or positive test for COVID?” (Yes = 1). Estimated coefficients are presented as odds ratios.
Know someone: binomial and multinomial logit model estimated for the question “How many people do you know who have had a medical Covid diagnosis, a positive test, or been to
hospital with it?”. Binomial model estimated for the dependent variable knows "none vs. one or more". The estimates of the binomial model are odds ratios. Multinomial model
estimated for knows 1 person and knows 2 persons or more.
Able to social distance: ordered logit for the accumulated times an individual answered yes to the question able to social distance at work, when travelling between work and home,
when shopping, when outside home and when transporting children outside home

Diagnosis: logit estimated for the question “Have you had a medical diagnosis or positive test for COVID?” (Yes = 1). Estimated coefficients are presented as odds ratios.
Know someone: binomial and multinomial logit model estimated for the question “How many people do you know who have had a medical Covid diagnosis, a positive test, or been to
hospital with it?”. Binomial model estimated for the dependent variable knows "none vs. one or more". The estimates of the binomial model are odds ratios. Multinomial model
estimated for knows 1 person and knows 2 persons or more.
Able to social distance: ordered logit for the accumulated times an individual answered yes to the question able to social distance at work, when travelling between work and home,
when shopping, when outside home and when transporting children outside home
