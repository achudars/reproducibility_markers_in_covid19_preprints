Abstract

14

Chronic diseases, worse socioeconomic conditions and old age can increase infection and

15

hospitalization rate due to Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We assessed the association between

16

the burden of NCDs and the occurrence of infections and hospitalizations of COVID-19 in Brazil

17

in a large COVID-19 national survey data. We analyzed only data collected between July and

18

November 2020 (n = 1,071,782). The frequencies of positive COVID-19 diagnosis and NCD

19

burden were estimated according to age, sex, socioeconomic strata and skin color categories. We

20

estimated hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals using Cox regression models. There is a non-

21

linear dose-response inverse association between per capita income and the rates of infection and

Worldwide, over 93 million cases and over 2 million deaths have been reported since the

29

start of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic by the World Health Organization

30

(WHO). Brazil has reported the highest number of new cases, as of 16 March 2021 (1).

31

According to the WHO, 15% of COVID-19 cases are likely to develop into

32

hospitalizations and 5% require treatment in intensive care units (ICU) (2). Factors such as

33

comorbidities, the presence of chronic diseases, worse socioeconomic conditions and old age can

34

increase the risk of hospitalization (3). According to data from the Pesquisa Nacional de Saúde

35

(National Health Survey) (PNS 2019), approximately 52% of Brazilian adults have at least one

36

chronic non-communicable disease (NCD). Respiratory and cardiac diseases, diabetes and

37

hypertension are the comorbidities leading towards the worst prognosis for COVID-19 (4,5).

38

In Brazil, considering the prevalence of NCDs, nationwide estimates for adults at risk of

39

severe COVID-19 range from 34.0% (53 million) to 54.5% (86 million) (6). To date we have no

40

evidence that the presence of comorbidities increases the risk of infection or if there is a gradient

41

between the number of comorbidities and the risk of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 (7).

42

Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the association between the burden of NCDs and

43

the occurrence of infections and hospitalizations of COVID-19.

METHODS

46

Data

47

We used data from PNAD COVID-19 (Portuguese acronym for National Household

48

Sample Survey COVID-19), conducted by the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística

49

(IBGE) and the Brazilian Ministry of Health. PNAD COVID-19 survey followed,

50

through monthly telephone calls, approximately 193,000 households between May and

51

November 2020. The sample was selected from an elaborated registry of probabilistic matching

52

between addresses of households contained in the Brazilian National Household Sample Survey

53

(PNAD 2019) and addresses of six databases with telephone information. The procedures,

54

databases used, questionnaires and sample plan of the research are described in technical

55

documents from IBGE (8). For the present study, we analyzed only data from individuals

56

between 20 and 59 years of age, collected between July and November 2020 (n=2.650.459).

57

PNAD COVID-19 collected information about exams, results of COVID-19, income and

58

sociodemographic characteristics of residents. It was also asked about previous diagnosis of

59

diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, chronic respiratory diseases (asthma, bronchitis,

60

emphysema and others), heart diseases (infarction, angina, heart failure, arrhythmia), depression

61

and cancer. Three questions related to the tested specimen were also used to diagnose COVID-19

62

infection, without discriminating the test performed (molecular biology, antigen or antibody).

63

The oronasal swab test uses the RT-PCR technique to identify viral RNA, usually up to the 8th

64

day of infection (9,10). In the venous blood test it is possible to detect antigen (current infection)

65

or antibody (current or past infection), and it is usually applied from the 8th day after the

66

beginning of the symptoms . The capillary blood test, also available for diagnosis, allows

67

verification of results after 15 minutes of the exam (11). We used three diagnostic outcomes:

68

positive diagnosis in oronasal swab, positive diagnosis in venous blood, and positive diagnosis in

69

capillary blood.

70

Sociodemographic information was also analyzed, such as sex (male and female), age (in

71

years), skin color (“white”/“yellow” and “black”/“brown”/“indigenous”), information on per

72

capita household income (PCI), which was calculated by the monthly average of individual

73

incomes divided by the total number of individuals in the household and then divided into fifths

74

of the distribution; schooling, complete or not, which was grouped into the following levels: no

75

schooling, elementary school, high school, higher education and post graduation; geographic

76

region and area of residence (urban or rural). Predicted values adjusted for NCD, age, sex,

77

education, income and skin color were created for two probabilistic outcomes, diagnosis and

78

hospitalization by COVID-19.

79

Statistical Analysis

80

For the present analysis, we carried out the following preparation: a) selection of

81

individuals between 20 and 59 years old; b) we consider any positive result reported in any of the

82

3 diagnostic tests asked; c) noncommunicable Diseases (NCD) diagnoses were grouped into 0, 1,

83

2 or more diseases to represent the NCD burden; d) we selected all cases with complete response

84

for variables under analysis (n = 1,071,782).

85

The frequencies of positive COVID-19 diagnosis and NCD burden were estimated according to

86

age, geographic and socioeconomic strata and skin color categories. We calculated hazard ratios

87

(HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between NCD and the risk of

88

infection and hospitalization for COVID-19 using Cox regression models via maximum

89

likelihood to account for repeated measures, as each person could contribute with one or more

90

interviews to the study. Findings at p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Initially,

91

we assessed the number of chronic noncommunicable diseases in separate models without

92

including any covariates.. Secondly, we included a priori selected demographic variables to

93

assess potential confounding: sex, age, race/skin color, education, household income and

94

rural/urban residency. The adjusted prevalence of COVID-19 was predicted according to NCD

95

burden and stratified by per capita household income. We estimated p-trends for the dose-

96

response relationship between NCD and COVID infection and hospitalization.

97

Finally, predicted values from the model were used to estimate COVID-19 latent frequency

98

according to the burden of NCD as grading risk to the infection or ICU use. All analyses were

99

performed using sampling weights in Stata® 15.1.

100

RESULTS

101

The prevalence of COVID-19 was higher among individuals aged 30 to 50 years (58%),

102

while the prevalence of hospitalizations was higher among individuals aged 40 or over more

103

(59%). Around 60% of the people in the age group of 40 years or over had NCDs. The

104

prevalence of 2 or more NCDs among the richest was 1.3 times the prevalence among the

105

poorest, however, the prevalence of hospitalizations was 1.2 times more frequent in the poorest

106

group.

107

The COVID-19 infection rate as a function of the NCD burden was not statistically

108

associated with sex. Table 2 shows the association between NCD burden and outcomes of

109

COVID-19. The presence of NCDs was associated with a higher incidence of COVID-19

110

infection for 1 NCD (HR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.26; 1.43) and for 2 or more (HR = 1.54 95% CI:

111

1.39; 1.71). Also, the presence of NCDs was associated with higher incidence of hospitalization

112

for 1 NCD (HR = 3.08 95% CI: 2.26; 4.19) and for two or more NCDs (HR = 6.81 95% CI: 4.88;

113

9.49).

114

The stratification of the association between NCD and COVID-19 according to family

115

income per capita is shown in Figure 1. The risk of infection by COVID-19 according to NCD

116

tends to decrease as per capita income increases. This trend was not linear, since in the richest

117

the risk of infection fluctuates slightly in a positive way. The risk of hospitalization for COVID-

118

19 among NCD patients shows an inverse trend with per capita income, although this association

119

is tenuous.

120

In Figure 1, we observed that the risk of hospitalization among patients without NCD did

121

not vary according to income strata, even after adjusting for sex, age, education, income and skin

122

color. Among patients with NCDs infected with COVID-19, the chance of hospitalization was

123

higher among the richest than the poorest.

124

DISCUSSION

125

Our results suggest that: a) patients with NCDs are at high risk for infection and

126

hospitalization with the Sars-CoV-2 virus. The risk of hospitalization is approximately twice the

127

risk of infection; b) there is a non-linear dose-response type association between the risks of

128

infection and hospitalization due to COVID-19 and per capita income; c) the difference between

129

the risks of infection or hospitalization of COVID-19 due to the burden of NCDs is non-linearly

130

associated with the per capita income.

131

Worldwide, approximately one in three adults suffers from multiple chronic diseases

132

(12). In Brazil, approximately 52% of the adult population has at least one chronic disease,

133

which is responsible for 72% of the causes of death in the country (6,13).

134

The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the role of NCDs as risk factors for infection,

135

hospitalization and death. Global data show that 1.7 billion people, 22% of the world population,

136

have at least one underlying condition that puts them at increased risk for COVID-19 infection

137

(14). In Brazil, from one third (53 million) to half (86 million) of adults have at least one risk

138

factor for COVID-19 (7).

139

The association between NCDs, diagnosis and hospitalization for COVID-19, observed in

140

our study, is in line with results from other countries (15–19). A meta-analysis carried out with

141

Chinese data showed that the most prevalent comorbidities among patients with COVID-19 were

142

hypertension (21%), diabetes (10%), cardiovascular disease (8%) and respiratory system disease

143

(2%). The combined OR for presenting a severe case among those with hypertension,

144

respiratory system disease and cardiovascular disease was 2.36 (95% CI: 1.46; 3.83), 2.46 (95%

145

CI: 1.76; 3.44) and 3.42 (95% CI: 1.88; 6.22) respectively (15). Analyzes based on American

146

clinical data indicate that the majority of outpatients with COVID-19 studied were African

147

American (72%), and had at least one comorbidity (94%), including hypertension (64%), chronic

148

kidney disease (39 %) and diabetes (38%). Severe obesity (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.4; 3.6) and

149

having chronic kidney disease (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.3; 3.3) were the strongest predictors for

150

admission to the intensive care unit (16).

151

Increasing evidence suggests that NCDs are determinants of the prognosis for infectious

152

diseases (20). The gradient between the number of NCDs and the evolution to a bad prognosis of

153

COVID-19, as found in the present study, brings up new challenges. The policy makers need to

154

take into account the management of actions that strengthen equity attention to the social and

155

biologically vulnerable population when elaborating strategies for health care (19).

156

Our results indicate that poorer individuals are more vulnerable to contagion and

157

hospitalization due to COVID-19 in Brazil. Previous population epidemiological data (H1N1 and

158

SARS) demonstrates the impact of social inequality as determinants for higher contagion and

159

severity of these diseases (21–23). Factors such as lower wages, quality of public transport,

160

unsanitary housing conditions, inefficient health care and difficulty in maintaining social

161

isolation without significant loss of income corroborate the increased vulnerability of this

162

population. (24,25). With regard to inequality in access to health and the needs to cope with the

163

pandemic of COVID-19, there is an increase in the demand for health care and intensive care

164

beds (ICU) with a range of attention to the population with dependence on public health care

165

(3,26).

166

In Brazil, 71.5% of the population exclusively uses public health services, showing a

167

direct relationship with income ranges per capita (27). The recommendation of WHO about the

168

adequate ratio of Intensive Care (ICU) beds is 1 to 3 beds for every 10,000 inhabitants. In Brazil,

169

the SUS (portuguese acronym for National Public Health System) has an average of 1.4 beds for

170

every 10,000 inhabitants against 4.9 in private health service (28).

171

Our findings revealed that among NCDs patients infected with COVID-19, the chance of

172

hospitalization was higher for the richest relative to the poorest. Income determinants seem to be

173

associated with less access to health and intensive treatment of the disease. In our interpretation,

174

poorer individuals, even though they are more vulnerable to the contagion of the disease, are less

175

likely to obtain access to treatment and hospitalization for COVID-19.

176

As a limitation of the study, the classic limitations of observational studies can be cited,

177

such as: self-report of information and lack of specificity and limited amount of information on

178

clinical diagnoses. Thus, our analyzes were conditioned to the volume and type of information

179

available in the database. As strengths of the study, longitudinal monitoring and the national

180

representativeness of the home-based sample can be pointed out, with a high response rate. In

181

addition, the sample size allows for consistent stratifications throughout the analysis (29).

182

These findings and methods of estimating the impact of vulnerable groups on the

183

progression of the pandemic may be useful for planning and managing prevention and treatment

184

strategies in Brazil. A better management and direction of policies that aim to obey the principle

185

of universality of rights in health care, covering the population in a state of biological and social

186

vulnerability is necessary. It is imperative to protect groups at greatest risk, such as people with

187

chronic diseases and comorbidities in scenarios of broad measures of social isolation,

188

particularly while the capacity for immunization is limited.

189

CONCLUSION

190

The burden of NCDs increases the risk of infection and hospitalization by COVID-19.

191

This is troublesome in a context of increasing social and health inequalities as inBrazil.

192

This situation, associated with the prospects caused by COVID-19, projects a scenario of

193

increased demand for clinical care in the coming years.
