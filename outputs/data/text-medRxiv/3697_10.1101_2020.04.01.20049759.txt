ABSTRACT
Background
As of March 26, 2020, the United States had the highest number of confirmed cases of Novel
Coronavirus (COVID-19) of any country in the world. Hospital critical care is perhaps the most
important medical system choke point in terms of preventing deaths in a disaster scenario such
as the current COVID-19 pandemic. We therefore brought together previously established
disease modeling estimates of the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic in the US under various
social distancing contact reduction assumptions, with local estimates of the potential critical care
surge response across all US counties.
Methods
Estimates of spatio-temporal COVID-19 demand and medical system critical care supply were
calculated for all continental US counties. These estimates were statistically summarized and
mapped for US counties, regions and urban versus non-urban areas. Estimates of COVID-19
infections and patients needing critical care were calculated from March 24, 2020 to April 24,
2020 for three different estimated population levels – 0%, 25%, and 50% – of contact reduction
(through actions such as social distancing). Multiple national public and private datasets were
linked and harmonized in order to calculate county-level critical care bed counts that included
currently available beds and those that could be made available under four surge response
scenarios – very low, low, medium, and high – as well as excess deaths stemming from
inaccessible critical care.
Results
Surge response scenarios ranged from a very low total supply 77,588 critical care beds to a
high total of 278,850 critical care beds. Over the four week study period, excess deaths from
inaccessible critical care ranged from 24,688 in the very low response scenario to 13,268 in the
high response scenario. Northeastern and urban counties were projected to be most affected
by excess deaths due to critical care shortages, and counties in New York, Colorado, and
Virginia were projected to exceed their critical care bed limits despite high levels of COVID-19
contact reduction. Over the four week study period, an estimated 12,203-19,594 excess deaths
stemming from inaccessible critical care could be averted through greater preventive actions
such as travel restrictions, publicly imposed contact precautions, greater availability of rapid
testing for COVID-19, social distancing, self-isolation when sick, and similar interventions. An
estimated 4,029-11,420 excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care could be
averted through aggressive critical care surge response and preparations, including high
clearance of ICU and non-ICU critical care beds and extraordinary measures like using a single
ventilator for multiple patients.
Conclusions
Unless the epidemic curve of COVID-19 cases is flattened over an extended period of time, the
US COVID-19 epidemic will cause a shortage of critical care beds and drive up otherwise
preventable deaths. The findings here support value of preventive actions to flatten the
epidemic curve, as well as the value of exercising extraordinary surge capacity measures to
increase access to hospital critical care for severely ill COVID-19 patients.

INTRODUCTION
The World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 a public health
emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020 and a pandemic on March 12, 2020.1
Nations around the world are increasingly experiencing case clusters or community
transmission. As of March 26, 2020, the United States had the highest number of confirmed
cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV2, of any country in the world.2
Multiple areas in the US are seeing dramatic increases in cases of COVID-19 and concerns are
mounting that local medical system response capacities will be quickly exceeded. Hospital
critical care is perhaps the most important medical system choke point in terms of preventing
deaths in a disaster scenario such as with the current COVID-19 pandemic.3,4 A spectrum of
critical care, from intensive care units to other serviceable hospital critical care structures, can
be drafted in the event of mass disasters, potentially doubling hospital capacity in a crisis care
surge situation.5,6,7,8
However, whether the nation’s potential hospital surge capacity is exactly double, or perhaps
more or less than that, in the context of rapidly growing cases of COVID-19 in the US, remains
unclear. We therefore brought together previously established disease modeling estimates9 of
the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic in the US under various social distancing contact
reduction assumptions, with local estimates of the potential critical care surge response10 across
all US counties. Our objectives in doing this was to highlight US counties that are at risk of
exceeding their critical care surge capacity limits within one month, indicate the typical time it
would take these counties to exceed their critical care surge capacity limits, and estimate the
excess mortality that would potentially result from exceeding critical care surge capacity limits in
these counties. These objectives speak to the capabilities of the US medical system under
disaster conditions and the usefulness of social distancing and other prevention strategies for
slowing the presentation rate of severe COVID-19 cases to a point where the US critical care
system can adapt in minimizing preventable mortality. 11,12
METHODS
Study setting and units of analysis
A full cohort of 3,108 US counties were included as our primary units of analysis. Aside from
states, counties (equivalently known as parishes, boroughs, and independent cities in some
states) are the major legally defined political and administrative units of the United States. As
primary governmental divisions, county boundaries and names rarely change.13 Our county list
included the District of Columbia as a county equivalent and we also tracked and accounted for
any county names or Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) county codes that had
changed over time across our various datasets. Alaska and Hawaii were not included in this
analysis as these states were disconnected in the commuting dataset that was used to project
the transmission and spatio-temporal spread of COVID-19 cases (these two states will be
added in later models and as part of ongoing calculations).
All US counties were further aggregated into US regions and urban/non-urban classifications.
US regions were defined using Census Bureau standards as Northeast, Midwest, South, and
West.14 Counties were defined as urban or non-urban using the 2013 US Department of
Agriculture rural-urban continuum classification (RUCC) scheme. Urban counties had RUCC
codes 1-3 in this scheme and listed as metropolitan; non-urban counties had RUCC codes 4-9
and listed as non-metropolitan. This ordinal RUCC variable distinguishes counties by

considering both their population size and proximity to metropolitan areas. In doing this it
provides useful added information over and above simple categorizing of counties on the basis
of population size, land area, proximity to metropolitan areas, or population density, as singular
variables.15,16
Various estimated parameters of spatio-temporal COVID-19 demand and medical system
critical care supply were then calculated for all continental US counties. These estimates were
then statistically summarized and mapped for US counties, regions and urban versus non-urban
areas. Geographic Information Systems software, ArcGIS Pro 2.5 (ESRI Inc., 2020, Redlands,
CA), was used to manage analytic polygons and create maps.
Estimates of spatio-temporal COVID-19 demand
A mathematical model was developed that simulates the spatiotemporal dynamics of infections.
The details of this model are reported elsewhere.17 The model divides infections into two
classes with separate rates of transmission: documented infected individuals and
undocumented infected individuals. The spatial spread of COVID-19 is captured using Census
Bureau commuting data to estimate the daily number of people traveling between counties and
an estimated multiplicative factor.
Transmission dynamics were simulated for all US study counties over the period from February
21, 2020 to March 24, 2020 using an iterated filter-ensemble adjustment Kalman filter
framework.18,19,20 This combined model-inference system estimated the trajectories of
susceptible, exposed, documented infected, and undocumented infected populations in each
county while simultaneously inferring model parameters for the average latent period, the
average duration of infection, the transmission reduction factor for undocumented infections, the
transmission rate for documented infections, the fraction of documented infections, and the
previously mentioned travel multiplicative factor. To account for delays in infection confirmation,
a time-to-event observation model using a Gamma distribution with a range of reporting delays
and different maximum seeding was employed. Log-likelihood was used to identify the best
fitting model-inference posterior.8,16
As in prior work21, the transmission of SARS-CoV2 under increasing reductions in population
physical contact via control measures and behavior change was projected forward in time from
March 24,2020 to April 24, 2020, using the optimized model parameter estimates. Control
measures included travel restrictions between areas, self-quarantine and contact precautions
that were publicly advocated or imposed, and greater availability of rapid testing for infection.
Behavior changes in medical care-seeking due to increased awareness of COVID-19 and
increased personal protective behavior (e.g., use of facemasks, social distancing, self-isolation
when sick) were also considered. Three different contact reduction scenarios were projected,
0% (no contact reduction via controls and behavior change), 25% contact reduction, and 50%
contact reduction.
Estimates of spatio-temporal medical system critical care supply
Data on the counts and availability of various hospital beds that could be used for critical care
were derived from the linkage and harmonization of different datasets for all US counties in the
study. Several datasets, including four primary sources of data were used: (1) the 2020
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), Health Care Information System (HCRIS)
Data File, Sub-System Hospital Cost Report (CMS-2552-96 and CMS-2552-10), Section S-3,
Part 1, Column 2; (2) the 2018 American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey; (3) the

2020 US DHHS Health Resources and Services Administration, Area Health Resources Files
(AHRF); and (4) the 2017-2019 CMS Medicare Provider of Services file, Medicare Cost Report,
Hospital Compare Files.
The various types of hospital beds that could be used for critical care included intensive care
unit (ICU) beds, as well as redirected operating room (OR) beds, post-anesthesia care unit
(PACU) beds, and step-down beds. Critical care beds from all civilian US general medicalsurgical, pediatric medical-surgical, and long-term acute care (LTAC) hospitals were included.
No Veterans Affairs or military medical hospital facilities were included. Counts of ICU bed per
hospital were summed as any reported: (a) general medical-surgical ICU beds, (b) surgical ICU
beds, (c) coronary ICU beds, (d) burn care ICU beds, (e) pediatric ICU beds, and (f) other ICU
beds. Neonatal ICU beds were excluded. Counts of ICU beds were the highest number of ICU
beds reported by each US hospital across the four primary sources of data listed above.
A baseline critical care bed availability, in the absence of surge clearances, was established as
30% of existing ICU beds in each county being unoccupied and available. From this baseline,
additional critical care bed counts were created for each county in our dataset that included
beds that could be made available under four critical care surge response scenarios – very low,
low, medium, and high (Table 1). Broadly, these four scenarios assumed the baseline that 30%
of a hospital’s critical beds are unoccupied and available, that some currently occupied critical
care beds can be cleared, that other specialized non-ICU beds can be redeployed as critical
care beds, and, in the high scenario, that two critical care patients can be serviced using a
single ventilator. In this way, existing critical care bed availability rates and occupied critical care
bed clearance rates for purposes of meeting high-volume patient surges in disasters were
incorporated into our estimates. Step-down bed counts were used where reported by hospitals
in the four primary data sources; if hospitals did not report step-down beds, a 1:4 step-down-toICU bed ratio was assumed and ICU bed counts were multiplied by 1.25. One bed per OR was
assumed. For hospitals that did not report PACU beds, a 1.5:1 PACU beds-to-OR ratio was
assumed and ORs were multiplied by 1.5. One ventilator was assumed per critical care bed.
The ability to put multiple patients on a single ventilator in order to meet demands in a highvolume disaster was also incorporated into our estimates.22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31
Counties with zero beds were not included in calculating the mean numbers of days prior to
exceeding critical care surge limits for each county. A typical ICU length of stay for COVID-19
patients was used to calculate the daily discharge rate from hospital critical care beds to
recalculate critical care bed need for each day of the study period.32 Once a hospital’s critical
care bed capacity was reached, patients who could not be admitted – i.e., new critical care bed
need minus critical care bed discharges – were aggregated to calculate excess deaths due to
lack of critical care access. Prior reports of the hospital course of care for COVID-19 patients
showed that the vast majority of those admitted to the ICU were critical and only one-in-five of
those who were critical survived, mostly because of ICU care. Thus, the percentage of critically
ill patients that should have gone to the ICU but did not and survived should be much lower,
likely only 5%; we therefore assumed a 95% mortality for patients that would have been placed
in a critical care bed but did not because their local critical care bed capacity had been
exceeded.33
RESULTS
Of the US counties included in our analysis, 217 (7.0%) were in the Northeast, 1,055 (34.0%)
were in the Midwest, 448 (14.4%) were in the South, and 1,388 (44.7%) were in the West.

Additionally, 1,160 (37.3%) of the counties in our analysis were urban and 1,948 (62.7%) were
non-urban.
The very low critical care surge response scenario had a total of 77,588 available critical beds, a
mean +/- standard deviation (SD) of 24.0 +/- 88.8 available critical beds per county, and a total
of 24,688 excess deaths that would occur when critical care surge bed limits are exceeded over
the projected 4 week study period. The low critical care surge response scenario had a total of
131,542 available critical beds, a mean +/- SD of 40.7 +/- 143.1 available critical beds per
county, and a total of 20,572 excess deaths that would occur when critical care surge bed limits
are exceeded. The medium critical care surge response scenario had a total of 174,891
available critical beds, a mean +/- SD of 54.1 +/- 190.9 available critical beds per county, and a
total of 17,742 excess deaths that would occur when critical care surge bed limits are exceeded.
The high critical care surge response scenario had a total of 278,850 available critical beds, a
mean +/- SD of 86.2 +/- 307.7 available critical beds per county, and a total of 13,268 excess
deaths that would occur when critical care surge bed limits are exceeded.
When considering US regions, the number of counties with critical care beds exceeding their
capacity within a month ranged from a high of 38 counties (17.5%) in the Northeast under the
very low critical care surge response scenario with no contact reduction, to zero counties in
multiple US regions under various scenario combinations. Urban counties were estimated to
have greater numbers exceeding their critical care bed capacities within a month, from a
maximum of 55 (4.7%) urban counties under the very low critical care surge response scenario
with no contact reduction, to 6 (0.5%) urban counties under the high critical care surge response
scenario with 50% contact reduction. (Table 2)
The 64 counties in the very low critical care surge response scenario with no contact reduction
that were at risk of exceeding their bed limits were clustered in various locations across the US
– a New York-New Jersey-Connecticut-northeastern Pennsylvania cluster, an eastern
Massachusetts cluster, a southeastern Michigan cluster, a southeastern Louisiana cluster, a
Colorado cluster, a Washington cluster, a Virginia cluster, and other dispersed counties in five
other states. At the other extreme, the 7 counties in the high critical care surge response
scenario with 50% contact reduction that were at risk of exceeding their bed limits were
clustered in New York, Colorado, and Virginia. (Figure 1)
The highest proportion of excess COVID-19 deaths that could have been averted with access to
critical care were shown to occur in the Northeast US and urban counties over the month
studied. As a measure of actions to flatten the epidemic curve, the difference in excess deaths
between a 0% and a 50% contact reduction ranged from an estimated 12,203 to 19,594 excess
deaths averted over a month. As a measure of the impact of aggressive critical care surge
actions, the difference in excess deaths between the high and the very low critical care surge
response scenarios ranged from an estimated 4,029 to 11,420 excess deaths averted over a
month. As a measure of the impact of redeploying non-ICU beds for critical care surge
response, the difference in excess deaths between the medium and the very low critical care
surge response scenarios ranged from an estimated 3,050 to 6,946 excess deaths averted over
a month. As a measure of the impact of putting two patients on a single ventilator, the difference
in excess deaths between the high and the medium critical care surge response scenarios
ranged from an estimated 979 to 4,474 excess deaths averted over a month. (Table 3)
The increase in critical care beds that could be achieved under the various surge response
scenarios was highly correlated with the number of beds estimated under the baseline critical
care bed availability model. Focusing on the medium critical care surge capacity scenario, the

gain in critical care beds under this scenario was highly correlated with the estimated beds
available under baseline critical care bed availability (r=0.97). Regression analyses found that
for each baseline critical care bed, 4.61 (95% CI 4.57, 4.65) additional critical care beds could
be gained under the medium critical care surge capacity scenario. The counties that could
generate the largest gains in beds under these surge capacity scenarios were counties that
already had substantial hospital infrastructure and these counties were typically large urban
areas.
DISCUSSION
An inversely proportional relationship is evident between available critical care beds and excess
deaths that would occur when critical care surge bed limits are exceeded. The value of
“flattening the curve” – that is, the difference between having none and achieving a 50% contact
reduction – is potentially sizeable in terms of affording the US medical system, especially the
choke point of hospital critical care, the necessary time to prepare and be able to handle a
manageable throughput volume of severely ill COVID-19 cases.
Roughly 10,000 to 20,000 excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care could be
averted within the 4 week study period through greater preventive actions such as travel
restrictions, publicly imposed contact precautions, greater availability of rapid testing for COVID19, social distancing, self-isolation when sick, and similar interventions. Moreover, roughly
4,000 to 11,000 excess deaths stemming from inaccessible critical care could be averted within
the 4 week study period through aggressive critical care surge response and preparations,
including high clearance of ICU and non-ICU critical care beds and extraordinary measures like
using a single ventilator for multiple patients. Adding in the capability of putting two patients on
a single ventilator in order to meet demands in a high-volume disaster such as the current
pandemic could save the lives of an additional 979 to 4,474 critically ill COVID-19 patients over
a month.34
The highest proportion of excess COVID-19 deaths that could have been averted with access to
critical care are shown to occur in the Northeast US and urban counties over the projected
month studied, a reflection of the COVID-19 caseload in the New York City region. However,
seven other major clusters of potentially preventable deaths due inadequate critical care access
were estimated across the US. Assuming a high level of contact reduction and a high level of
critical care surge response, these clusters most prominently include counties in New York,
Colorado, and Virginia, although relaxations of these high assumptions were shown to add
clusters in states such as Louisiana, Michigan, and Virginia.
While large urban areas generally had the largest capacity to generate additional critical care
beds under our surge capacity models, these same urban counties currently, or in the near
future, are predicted to have the largest numbers of COVID-19 cases. A major concern that
then arises is whether the critical care surge capacity in these counties is sufficient to care for
the projected numbers of COVID-19 cases that will continue to mount. As a matching concern,
the relocation or travel of urban residents with undetected COVID-19 infection to non-urban
areas that appear to be relatively unaffected may overwhelm the relatively limited critical care
capacity in otherwise isolated non-urban regions. A potential example of this in the current
dataset is the Colorado cluster that includes major winter vacation resorts that may have had
visitors in from major cities in the US and internationally soon before public notification of the
current COVID-19 crisis.

The estimates presented here are based on long-established federal and professional agency
inventories and estimations of hospitals and hospital beds across the US. However, a major
limitation is that the models presented here use data on physical infrastructure but do not
account for staffing or ventilator supplies. Healthcare workers, especially those involved in
critical care, are at high risk for COVID-19 infection and thus there may be staffing shortages
that reduce the utility of the critical care beds that could be gained under surge responses.
There have already been reports of hospitals being unable to accept patients, not because of
lack of beds but due to lack of staff to cover those beds. Some states, like New York, are
currently recruiting retired healthcare workers to assist with staffing shortfalls, an approach that
might be generally applicable in alleviating shortfalls during the current epidemic. These
retirees are, however, generally older and can be particularly vulnerable to poor outcomes from
COVID-19. Our models also cannot account for the innovation, ingenuity and perseverance of
medical staff, many of whom are trained to work in crisis situations. It is likely that medical staff
will find solutions that are unanticipated by our models, that can subsequently be included as
they become known and more widely applied across healthcare systems. Future analyses
should also incorporate counts of ventilators in addition to critical care beds. Our models also
did not account for heterogeneities arising from specific high-risk communities in different
localities. For instance, places with large elderly populations or high levels of pre-existing
respiratory, cardiovascular, or immunocompromised conditions would have even higher
mortality rates. Future analyses could also account for underlying population risk factors such
as these.
As has been often discussed, unless the epidemic curve of COVID-19 cases is flattened over an
extended period of time, the global pandemic, and the US COVID-19 epidemic which is now the
world’s largest, will cause a shortage of critical care beds and drive up otherwise preventable
deaths.35 Despite this ominous forecast, the current paper has demonstrated the potential value
of preventive actions to flatten the epidemic curve, as well as the value of exercising
extraordinary surge capacity measures to increase access to hospital critical care for severely ill
COVID-19 patients.
