ABSTRACT

25

Background: Corticosteroid has been used to manage inflammation caused by many diseases

26

including respiratory viral infections. Many articles are available to support the good and bad

27

side of this steroid use but remain inconclusive. To find some evidence about the safety of the

28

drug, we investigated the effect of corticosteroids on the mortality of patients with respiratory

29

viral infections including SARS-CoV-2, SARS, MERS, and Influenza.

30

Method: We searched articles in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Medline, Google Scholar, and

31

Web of Science records using keywords “corticosteroid” or “viral infection” or “patients” or

32

“control study”. Mortality was the primary outcome.

33

Result: Our selected 24 studies involving 16633 patients were pooled in our meta-analysis.

34

Corticosteroid use and overall mortality were not significantly associated (P=0.176), but in

35

subgroup analysis, corticosteroid use was significantly associated with lower mortality in the

36

case of SARS (P=0.003) but was not significantly associated with mortality for Influenza

37

(H1N1) (P=0.260) and SARS-CoV-2 (P=0.554). Further analysis using study types of SARS-

38

CoV-2, we found that corticosteroid use was not significantly associated with mortality in the

39

case of retrospective cohort studies (P=0.256) but was significantly associated with lower

40

mortality in the case of randomized control trials (P=0.005). Our findings uncover how the

41

outcome of particular drug treatment for different diseases with comparable pathogenesis may

42

not be similar and, RCTs are sometimes required for robust outcome data.

43

Conclusion: At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, data of corticosteroid use from other

44

viral infections along with COVID-19 observational and retrospective cohort studies created

45

confusion of its effect, but randomized control trials showed that corticosteroid can be used to

46

treat COVID-19 patients.

1. Introduction

50

1.1 Respiratory Virus

51

Respiratory infections represent the leading cause of disease and economic burden [1]. They are

52

linked with a number of clinical symptoms from upper respiratory tract self-limited infections to

53

more severe conditions in the lower respiratory tract, for example, pneumonia. Respiratory

54

viruses (RVs) includes but are not limited to influenza virus, adenovirus, human coronavirus,

55

human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus (RV), parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),

56

may cause severe diseases such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis and/or exacerbate chronic

57

obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Moreover, the Avian influenza virus

58

(H5N1), SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and MARS coronavirus (MARS-CoV) have emerged

59

in recent years as potential threats to the public health attracting global attention. The

60

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome

61

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) originating in Wuhan, China, is swiftly and continuously

62

spreading globally and responsible for significant respiratory morbidity and mortality [2].

63

1.2 Corticosteroid

64

Corticosteroids, often known as steroids, are classes of hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex,

65

including glucocorticoids (GCs) and mineralocorticoids [3]. Nevertheless, the term

66

“corticosteroids'' is commonly used to denote glucocorticoids. Corticosteroids control various

67

cellular functions such as metabolism, development, cognition, inflammation, and homeostasis

68

[4]. Corticosteroids are being used regularly in clinics to treat autoimmune and inflammatory

69

pathologies such as allergy, septic shock, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and

70

inflammatory bowel disease. The adverse effects of prolonged glucocorticoid therapy are well

71

established and exceedingly common which limits the therapeutic benefits. Some side effects of

72

certain medical conditions after taking corticosteroid are glucose intolerance and diabetes,

73

osteoporosis and fracture, muscle wasting, central obesity, growth retardation, depression,

74

hypertension cataracts, and increased risk of viral and bacterial infections [5].

75

To the current day, nevertheless, corticosteroids continue to be the backbone in the treatment of

76

autoimmune disorders and inflammatory diseases, and they are prescribed as an

77

immunosuppressant after organ transplantation and as lymphocytic in chemotherapeutic

78

treatments [6].

79

1.3 Corticosteroid and immunosuppression

80

Corticosteroids, especially glucocorticosteroids, have inhibitory properties on a wide range of

81

immune responses [7]. They are steroid hormones with extensive effects. They often exert anti-

82

inflammatory and potent immune-suppressive effects when pharmacologically driven. These are

83

typically used to prevent the harmful effects of the inflammatory cascades in severe infections

84

[8] and that's why they are used to treat inflammatory diseases due to the inhibition of B cells

85

and T cells mediated immune responses [7]. To date, the immunomodulatory function of

86

glucocorticoid analogs has been difficult to discern from their untoward effects, which reflects

87

the fact that most of the activities of cortisol are regulated by a particular molecule of the nuclear

88

receptors. For the future production of more active immunosuppressive agents, a better

89

comprehension of the molecular base of steroids on the immune response is thus necessary [9].

90

While glucocorticoids play a role in stimulating lymphocyte apoptosis and in altering leukocyte

91

movement and redistribution, the key component of their action is the suppression of cytokine

92

gene expression, resulting in a reduced release of interferons (IFN-α), interleukins (IL-2, IL-6),

93

and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) [9].

94

1.4 Use of corticosteroid in respiratory viral infection

95

Even after controversy, it is a very common trend to administer corticosteroids to influenza

96

patients, especially pandemic influenza virus. The use of corticosteroids increases the chance of

97

infection by various microorganisms and it is significantly associated with mortality (OR 1.98,

98

95% CI 1.62-2.43, p < 0.00001) and nosocomial infection (OR 3.16, 95% CI 2.09-4.78, p <

99

0.00001) [10]. Patients with pandemic H1N1 viral infection whose rapidly deteriorating

100

pneumonia leads to acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) along

101

with several organ dysfunctions were found associated with an increased rate of mortality (14–

102

41%) [11]. In clinical practice, the application of adjuvant corticosteroid treatment of those

103

patients is very common. Other studies have shown that systemic corticosteroid therapy may

104

inhibit the inflammatory cascade reaction in patients with community-acquired pneumonia [12].

105

It has also been reported that corticosteroid use was not significantly associated with 90-day

106

mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-1.07; P=0.12) but found to be

107

associated with the delay in RNA clearance of MERS coronavirus (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.35;

108

95% CI, 0.17-0.72; P=0.005) [13].

109

1.5 Covid-19 and corticosteroid

110

To date, 115 million people are infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus worldwide and caused 2.5

111

million death [14]. Although vaccination has been started, only 269 million out of 7.79 billion

112

have been given a single shot and 56 million people have been fully vaccinated (0.72% of the

113

total population) [15].

114

The complex condition of severely ailing patients with COVID-19 leads to an array of protocols

115

employing complementary treatments including the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of

116

phase IIb-III COVID-19 patients in hospital[16–18]. The vital point is that corticosteroids might

117

be useful in checking cytokine and chemokine storm-mediated alveolar/pulmonary damage. In

118

this condition, corticosteroids are used as immunosuppressants (inhibition of cytokine

119

production) resulting in impaired lymphocyte proliferation and delay in the clearance of the virus

120

[17,19]. Nevertheless, there are several studies reported the use of corticosteroids for the

121

management of ARDS caused by several severe coronavirus infections such as severe acute

122

respiratory syndrome (SARS) [20] and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [13]

123

where diffused alveolar damage and histological pulmonary inflammation are common [21].

124

Patients with COVID19 are frequently treated with corticosteroids regardless of the deficiency

125

of effectiveness evidence from clinical studies [22]. Moreover, the present temporary direction

126

from WHO on clinical management of COVID-19 patients recommends against corticosteroid

127

use if not prescribed for another reason. A study conducted at Wuhan Union Hospital

128

retrospectively reviewed forty-six severe COVID-19 pneumonia hospitalized patients for the use

129

of intravenous methylprednisolone (dose 1-2mg/kg/d for 5-7 days in 26 patients) in 26 of them

130

and the other 20 as control. Data of this study indicate that early, low-dose, and short-term use of

131

corticosteroids in patients with severe COVID-19 was correlated with the quick improvement of

132

various symptoms and absorption of lung focus [23]. In another study, COVID-19 patients

133

treated with a corticosteroid had adverse clinical symptoms, further aberrations on chest CT, and

134

an elevated inflammation index. Their data indicates that corticosteroid use could not stimulate

135

virus clearance time, length of hospital stay, or overall duration of symptoms persistence in mild

136

COVID19 patients [24]. Studies have also revealed that corticosteroid treatment in patients

137

with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, infections had delayed virus clearance and did

138

not significantly improve survival rate, decrease hospitalization time or rate of ICU admission

139

and/or requirement of mechanical ventilation [25].

140

To make evidence-based recommendations for clinicians about the use of corticosteroids in

141

COVID-19 patients require systematic summaries and meta-analysis of the available evidence.

142

Therefore, the contentious results of corticosteroid use in SARS, MERS, influenza pneumonia

143

patients lead us to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of all observational,

144

retrospective cohort, and randomized control studies that have compared mortality, secondary

145

infection, ICU stays, and hospital stay of patients who received corticosteroid treatment with the

146

patients who did not. We aimed to recognize the safety and efficacy of corticosteroids as well as

147

their role in clinical outcomes in SARS, MARS, influenza, and COVID-19 patients and also

148

aimed to find out differences in the outcome of different types of studies such as retrospective

149

cohort studies (RCS) and randomized control trials (RCT).

150

2. Methods

151

2.1 Articles search strategies

152

A literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled

153

Trials (CENTRAL), Medline, Google Scholar, and Web of Science records using keywords such

154

as: “corticosteroid” or “viral infection” or “patients” or “control study”. No limitation on

155

language, publication type, and location of the word in the article (title, abstract and main text)

156

was used. Our search consisted of articles from 1980 to September 2020. References from

157

similar review articles and selected articles were also checked for matching articles with our

158

selection criteria. We have used PRISMA 2009 checklist for systematic reviews and meta-

159

analysis (www.prisma-statement.org) [26] and available in supplementary data (Suppl. Table

160

ST1).

161

2.2 Criteria for inclusion and exclusion of articles

162

Articles were selected for this meta-analysis based on the following inclusion criteria i) patients

163

with respiratory viral infections in each study were treated with corticosteroid ii) study had

164

corticosteroid treatment group and control group (placebo-treated or untreated/matched) iii)

165

study had primary outcome data on mortality, and any of the secondary outcomes such as

166

secondary infection rate, length of ICU stay, length of hospital stay, duration of mechanical

167

ventilation, and number patients in mechanical ventilation. Studies on non-respiratory viral

168

infections, non-English articles, reviews, case study and articles that didn’t have full texts were

169

excluded from this analysis.

170

2.3 Article selection

171

Every search was grouped and assigned to all the authors to primarily select articles. Next, those

172

selected articles were reassigned to different authors to make a final selection based on our

173

inclusion and exclusion criteria. Titles of selected articles from all of the authors were then copy-

174

pasted into a shared google sheet that was conditionally formatted for matching to avoid

175

duplications. The corresponding author then checked all the selected articles again to confirm

176

inclusion and exclusion criteria match.

177

2.4 Data extraction

178

Selected articles were grouped and assigned to all the authors to extract data and put into a

179

google sheet that only the corresponding author had access to. Next, those groups of articles

180

were reassigned to a different author to extract data and record in a separate google sheet. Two

181

sheets were then matched, and any discrepancies were resolved by group meetings via Zoom.

182

Authors were asked to extract information on authors, title, year of publication, number of

183

patient in the treatment arm, number of patient in the control arm, a corticosteroid used, placebo-

184

control or not, type of study, the mortality rate (control/corticosteroid), secondary infection rate

185

(bacterial), secondary infection rate (viral), male/female (% of the total patient), male/female (%

186

of control/corticosteroid group), the mean age of the total patient, mean age of the dead patient,

187

length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, dead patients underlying health conditions,

188

comorbidities of patients, name of viral infection, length of mechanical ventilation, Viral/RNA

189

clearance time/viral shedding duration, and the median daily dosage of corticosteroid. For any

190

unavailable data in the article during extraction, authors from that article were contacted by

191

emails to see if those data were available.

192

2.5 Quality assessment

193

The risk of bias quality of each of the selected studies was individually evaluated by two authors

194

according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for comparative observational studies and

195

nonrandomized trials and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs [27,28]. Disputes related to

196

quality at any point were settled through zoom meetings with the other authors until the

197

agreement was achieved.

198

2.6 Statistical Analysis

199

All statistical analysis was performed by using statistical software STATA 13 [29].

200

hypothesis was tested using the Mann-Whitney U test. Z statistic and P-value <0.05 were used to

201

test the significance. All the results of the meta-analysis are displayed in the forest plot.

202

Frequencies and proportions are used to report binary variables. On the other hand, mean and

203

standard deviation are used to report continuous variables. Chi-square statistics are used to test

204

statistical heterogeneity. A random-effects model meta-analysis is performed under the

205

appearance of statistical heterogeneity. The derSimonian-Laird estimator is used to estimating

206

between-study variance (τ2) in a random-effects model. For binary data, we have calculated risk

207

ratio (RR) as a relative effect along with a 95% confidence interval (CI). On the other hand, the

208

standard mean difference (SMD) is calculated as a relative effect for continuous data along with

209

95% CI. We have conducted subgroup analysis based on different types of viruses. A funnel plot

210

is used to check the publication bias and Egger’s test of the intercept is used to quantify the

211

asymmetry of the funnel plot and to perform a statistical test.

212

3. Results

213

Our search initially identified 2365 records, of which 1344 records were from PubMed, 450 from

214

Cochrane, 101 from Medline, 241 from Scopus, 130 from Web of science, and 100 (first ten

215

pages) from Google scholar. After screening and reading through the title, abstract, and main

216

text, we discarded 1835 studies due to not fulfilling our selection criteria. Twenty-four studies

217

finally satisfied our exclusion and inclusion criteria and were used in this analysis. Further

218

details of the exclusion and inclusion of articles are shown in figure 1.

219

3.1 Description of the selected studies

220

All 24 of our selected articles compared outcomes of corticosteroid with the control group and

221

our primary outcome mortality was recorded in all 24 studies [13,30,39–48,31,49–52,32–38].

222

Length of hospital stay (days) was analyzed in 3 studies [13,48,50], secondary infection rate was

223

recorded in 12 studies [32,37,50,51,42–49], length of mechanical ventilation was recorded in 5

224

studies [39,42,49–51], number of patients in mechanical ventilation (MV) was presented in 14

225

studies [13,31,48,50,51,33,34,38,41,42,45–47], length of ICU stay (days) was reported in 6

226

studies [13,43,48–51]. Twenty-three articles included patients with the respiratory viral infection

227

and one article included patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Of the 23 respiratory

228

viral infection articles, eight were H1N1, one H7N9, one influenza, one SARS, one MERS, and

229

eleven SARS-CoV-2. Detailed characteristics of studies can be found in supplementary table

230

ST1. We have included studies published between 2007 and September 2020. The outcome

231

between corticosteroid and non-corticosteroid of all 24 studies were compared based on

232

mortality. We have included 16633 patients into our final meta-analysis and systematic review

233

from all 24 studies. Among all the patients, about 7634 patients were treated with corticosteroid

234

and the remaining 8999 patients were in the control group. Baseline characteristics of patients in

235

this analysis are shown in supplementary table ST1.

236

3.2 Statistical heterogeneity

237

We have found significant heterogeneity in our meta-analysis of effect of corticosteroid on

238

mortality (I2=95.7%, P<0.0001), secondary infection (I2=90.6%, P<0.0001), MV days

239

(I2=70.7%, P=0.009), MV patients (I2=96.4%, P<0.0001), ICU days (I2=91.2%, P<0.0001),

240

hospital days (I2=80.3%, P=0.006).

241

3.3 Overall Mortality

242

First, we combined all the studies and analyzed them as a whole although it is obvious that these

243

viral diseases are different in their pathology and may not react the same but just to understand

244

from an overall point of view. We found that the mortality rate for the patients who received

245

corticosteroids was not significantly higher than that of patients who did not receive

246

corticosteroids (RR: 1.23 (CI: 0.91, 1.65), Z = 1.35, P = 0.176)) (Figure 2). Next, we analyzed

247

them based on viral types and we found that subgroup analysis based on viral types shows

248

differential results (Figure 3). Patients with MERS–CoV, H7N9 viral types favored control over

249

corticosteroid (Z=3.03, P=0.002 and Z= 3.05, P=0.002 respectively) and SARS study favored

250

corticosteroid but had just one study, so the results were not very robust. Similar to the overall

251

mortality, H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 studies showed that the mortality of patients who received

252

corticosteroids was not significantly higher than that of patients who did not receive

253

corticosteroids (Figure 3). On the flip side, different types of SARS–CoV-2 studies showed

254

different outcomes. Retrospective cohort studies leaned towards control over corticosteroids but

255

did not show statistically significant differences in mortality (Z=1.14, P=0.256), whereas RCT

256

(Z=2.84, P=0.005) and retrospective controlled cohort (Z=2.16, P=0.031) studies showed

257

significantly lower mortality when corticosteroids were used (Figure 4).

258

3.4 Secondary infection

259

Next, we analyzed if immunosuppressive corticosteroid treatment increases secondary infection

260

rates. Secondary infection, length of hospital stays, and mortality are closely related. On the one

261

hand, secondary infection can increase mortality and length of hospital and ICU stay; on the

262

other hand, the length of hospital stay can increase secondary infection chances. We found that

263

the secondary infection rate for the patients who received corticosteroid is significantly higher

264

than the patients who did not receive corticosteroid (RR: 1.55 (CI: 1.05, 2.28), Z=2.20,

265

P=0.028)) as shown in Figure 5. Similar results were also obtained from a subgroup analysis of

266

patients with H1N1 viral type (RR: 1.58 (CI: 1.01, 2.46), Z=2.0, P=0.045)). Patients with SARS

267

and H7N9 viral types found no significant corticosteroid effect on the secondary infection

268

(Figure 5). Two SARS-CoV-2 studies included data on secondary infection, one of them is RCT

269

[32] and the other is RCS [37]. Interestingly, similar to the mortality data RCT favored

270

corticosteroid but RCS favored control (Figure 5).

272

We were intrigued to find out how many patients were in mechanical ventilation (MV) in the

273

corticosteroid treatment group. We found that the number of patients in mechanical ventilation

274

was significantly higher in the corticosteroid group (RR: 1.59 (CI: 1.27, 1.99), Z=4.10, P <

275

0.0001)) as shown in figure 6. Subgroup analysis of patients with H1N1 (Z=2.39, p=0.017),

276

SARS-CoV-2 (Z=2.43. p=0.015), and MERS-CoV (Z=4.04, p<0.0001) also showed us a similar

277

effect of corticosteroid (Figure 6), but patients with H7N9 infection showed no significance

278

(p=0.058).

279

3.6 Length of mechanical ventilation, hospital stay, and ICU stay

280

If corticosteroid use is associated with prolonged stay in a hospital and a higher number of

281

patients in mechanical ventilation, it might affect the length of mechanical ventilation

282

requirement also. As shown in Suppl. figure S1, our analysis has revealed that the length of

283

mechanical ventilation (days) was significantly higher in patients who received corticosteroid

284

(SMD: 0.18 (CI: 0.02, 0.33), Z=2.26, P=0.024)). All patients were affected by the H1N1 virus.

285

We then analyzed three studies that had data for hospital stays to see if corticosteroid use

286

increases patients' hospital stay. As shown in Suppl. figure S2, length of hospital stay (days) was

287

significantly higher for the corticosteroid group (SMD: 0.58 (CI: 0.22, 0.94), Z=3.16, P=0.002)).

288

Subgroup analysis of patients with MERS-CoV and H1N1 showed similar results (Suppl. figure

289

S3).

290

Next, we analyzed the length of ICU stay of patients receiving corticosteroids. We found that the

291

length of ICU stay in days was significantly higher for patients who received corticosteroids

292

(SMD: 0.48 (CI: 0.17, 0.79), Z=3.07, P=0.002). (Suppl. figure S4). Similar results were observed

from a subgroup analysis of patients with H1N1 and MERS-CoV viral infections (Suppl. figure

294

295

3.7 Risk of bias assessment

296

We have used funnel plot analysis of selected articles to check publication bias and found that

297

the P-value of Egger’s test is not significant (P > 0.09), which suggests that there is no evidence

298

of publication bias (Suppl. figure S6). In our selected studies risk of selection bias was

299

unavoidable for the studies that were not randomized control trials. The risk of bias identified in

300

the 24 included studies is shown in (Suppl. Table ST2 and Suppl. Table ST3). NOS scores of our

301

selected retrospective cohort and observational studies varied from 6 to 9, suggesting that the

302

quality of our selected studies was high [28]. Nevertheless, most selected studies had

303

considerable comparability bias because we could not adjust for disease severity, and patients

304

with higher disease severity have a tendency to receive corticosteroid treatment.

305

4. Discussion

306

This meta-analysis and systematic review included 19 cohort studies and 5 RCTs, with low to

307

high risk of bias, which addressed the association between corticosteroid use and mortality as

308

primary outcome and length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, length of mechanical

309

ventilation, number of patients required mechanical ventilation, and rate of secondary infection,

310

as a secondary outcome with SRAS-CoV-2, SARS, MERS, and Influenza. The available data

311

suggested that corticosteroid therapy was not significantly associated with lower mortality rate

312

when compared using different virus types and study types but was associated with lower

313

mortality rate when low bias, gold-standard RCTs were analyzed.

314

The use of corticosteroids suppresses systemic inflammation [8]. Following infection with

315

Influenza virus, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERSCoV acute respiratory distress and

316

acute lung injury are characterized by uncontrolled local and systemic inflammation [19,53–55].

317

The systemic injury is caused by an extreme host innate response with inflated migration of

318

neutrophils, macrophages, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, promoting typical exudative edema

319

and fibrosis which lead to diffuse alveolar damage, acute necrotizing bronchiolitis with mostly

320

neutrophilic inflammation, and severe alveolar hemorrhage [56,57]. During these diseases, the

321

clinical administration of corticosteroids inhibits immune reactions by suppressing inflammatory

322

responses, inhibiting the migration of inflammatory cells from the systemic circulation to tissues

323

by the suppression of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, reducing

324

leukocyte trafficking, and preventing immune reactions mediated by T-lymphocytes and B-

325

lymphocytes [48,49,56,58–60]. Immune suppression occurs by the administration of

326

corticosteroid before the inflammatory reaction reaches to deleterious position might even delay

327

viral clearance, lead to extended viremia, and delayed viral RNA clearance, ultimately leading to

328

an increased rate of mortality [61,62]. By applying marginal structural Cox proportional hazards

329

modeling, one of our included studies showed that corticosteroid treatment was correlated with a

330

substantial delay in MERS-CoV RNA clearance (aHR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17–0.72; P=0.005) [13]

331

while another study has shown corticosteroids use in patients were associated with lower levels

332

of procalcitonin (0.5 vs 0.7 ng/mL, P=0.02) [51]. On the other hand, the inflammatory response

333

against some respiratory viral infection reaches to point where inflammation-mediated collateral

334

damage becomes more detrimental to the host than the harm caused by the virus itself.

335

Observational and cohort studies prior to the COVID-19 pandemic found a negative effect of

336

corticosteroid use as we have also shown in this meta-analysis. After the pandemic, clinicians

16

337

stated to use corticosteroid as an immunosuppressive drug to mitigate the cytokine storm but

338

again most of the cohort studies showed higher mortality in the corticosteroid use. Then,

339

randomized control trials were implemented and showed a beneficial effect of corticosteroid use.

340

Because results from RCTs are robust that the cohort studies, it is now evident that cohorts’

341

studies had patient selection and other biases. In this analysis we clearly show how outcome of a

342

drug treatment may vary depending on different diseases/pathogeneses and even on the study

343

types within same disease/pathogenesis.

344

In this meta-analysis, we have found that most of the studies including one RCT [37] (except one

345

RCT [32]) that had data on secondary infection showed that the corticosteroids group was prone

346

to develop secondary infection probably due to the immunosuppressive effect of the drug. One of

347

our included studies revealed that the subjects, who received corticosteroids, had an elevated rate

348

of immunosuppression (46% vs. 32%%, P=0.03) led to higher secondary bacterial pneumonia

349

cases (57% vs. 22%, P=<0.001) [50]. Besides, the increased rate of secondary infection due to

350

prolonged ICU stay has also been revealed by another study [63]. Then Again, corticosteroids

351

immune suppression might lead to developing critical illness [64]. One of our included studies

352

has shown that the rate of shock was 43% vs 30% in the corticosteroid group vs the control

353

group [50]. Moreover, corticosteroids treatment increased the need for invasive mechanical

354

ventilation rate to 85% from 51% in the control group [50]. Analysis from the studies before the

355

COVID-19 pandemic showed significant higher secondary infection for the corticosteroid group

356

(Z=2.2, p=0.028) but two RCT of COVID-19 studies had differential data and could not generate

357

any significance between treatment and control group suggests that more and more RCT studies

358

are needed to reach a conclusion.

359

Moreover, studies before the COVID-19 pandemic (data from SARS, MERS, H1N1) showed

360

that patients treated with corticosteroids had a significantly higher hospital stay, ICU stay, and

361

length of mechanical ventilation. In addition, these patients were more vulnerable to

362

superinfection, such as secondary bacterial pneumonia (57% vs. 22%, P=<0.001) or invasive

363

pulmonary fungal infection, and aggravation of underlying conditions, which led them to stay in

364

ICU for longer periods than the control (no-corticosteroid) group [50]. Furthermore, another

365

study exhibited that the clinical administration of corticosteroids deferred the initiation of

366

blocking the viral neuraminidases by neuraminidase inhibitors, with longer ICU stay in patients

367

who did not receive neuraminidase inhibitors within 5 days of illness [65]. None of the RCTs of

368

SARS-CoV-2 had data on hospital stay, ICU stay, and length of mechanical ventilation and due

369

to the selection bias of cohort studies it is now apparent that RCTs are required to get a robust

370

conclusion on these parameters.

371

Regardless of these outcomes, our study has some limitations. First, the strength of the

372

conclusion made by the studies before the COVID-19 pandemic is not so strong because there

373

was only one RCT study in our analysis, all studies that we include in this review are

374

observational studies having many lurking variables. Now that RCTs showed a beneficial effect

375

of corticosteroid, the deleterious effect of it from the cohort studies becomes questionable.

376

Second, we could not separate patients who obtained corticosteroids for underlying disease (e.g.,

377

COPD). We also could not perform subgroup analysis based on doses of steroid received, early

378

or late steroid use, or other factors. Data on dose, duration, timing, types, and rationales of

379

corticosteroid administration and the timing and duration of antiviral therapy were very

380

insufficient. Before starting this review one of the goals was to see what happens if corticosteroid

381

is applied after cytokine storm vs before cytokine storm but due to data limitation, it was not

382

possible to analyze and opens a new avenue to investigate in the future. Third, the baseline

383

criteria of the patients can control outcomes and differences among the studies included in our

384

analysis. For example, an association had been observed between fewer secondary infections and

385

younger age and fewer underlying diseases.

386

Conclusion

387

Current meta-analysis supports the use of corticosteroids to treat critically ill patients with

388

COVID-19, because of the strength of the RCTs that shows that the administration of systemic

389

corticosteroids was associated with lower all-cause mortality compared with usual care or

390

placebo.

391

Our analysis also points out that outcome of particular drug treatments for different diseases with

392

comparable pathogenesis may not be similar and for robust outcome data, RCTs are sometimes

393

required.
