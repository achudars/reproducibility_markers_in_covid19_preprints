Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has hit di↵erent parts of the world di↵erently: some
regions are still in the rise of the first wave, other regions are now facing a decline
after a first wave, and yet other regions have started to see a second wave. The
current immunity level î in a region is closely related to the cumulative fraction
infected, which primarily depends on two factors: a) the initial potential for COVID19 in the region (often quantified by the basic reproduction number R0 ), and b) the
timing, amount and e↵ectiveness of preventive measures put in place. By means
of a mathematical model including heterogeneities owing to age, social activity and
susceptibility, and allowing for time-varying preventive measures, the risk for a new
epidemic wave and its doubling time, and how they depend on R0 , î and the overall
e↵ect of the current preventive measures, are investigated. Focus lies on quantifying
the minimal overall e↵ect of preventive measures pM in needed to prevent a future
outbreak. The first result shows that the current immunity level î plays a more
influential roll than when immunity is obtained from vaccination. Secondly, by
comparing regions with di↵erent R0 and î it is shown that regions with lower R0
and low î may now need higher preventive measures (pM in ) compared with other
regions having higher R0 but also higher î, even when such immunity levels are far
from herd immunity.

Introduction
COVID-19 is currently spreading in many parts of the world. In several regions the
spreading has now dropped substantially, and in other regions the first wave has been

very small, most often owing to the implementation of e↵ective preventive measures.
Regions where spreading now is low face two competing interests: lifting restrictions to
normalize society, and to keep or strengthen restrictions in order to avoid a new major
COVID-19 outbreak. The minimal overall e↵ect of preventive measures needed to avoid
a large future outbreak, denoted pM in , and how it depends on the basic reproduction
number R0 and the current immunity level î, is hence a highly important question which
is investigated here. In addition we consider the doubling time of a new outbreak should
it take place, which gives an indication of its impact before additional preventive measures
would be implemented.
The basic reproduction number R0 quantifies the initial potential of an epidemic outbreak
for a particular disease in a particular region, and is defined as the average number of
new infections caused by a typical infected individual in the beginning of the epidemic
outbreak (before preventive measures are put in place and before population immunity
starts to build up), [3]. For COVID-19 estimates of R0 vary substantially between di↵erent
regions, e.g. between 2 and 5 among 11 European countries [6].
Preventive measures aim to reduce the average number of infections caused by an infective,
by either reducing the risk of transmission given a contact (e.g. hand washing, wearing
face mask), reducing the number of daily contacts (e.g. social distancing, school closure)
and/or reducing the e↵ective infectious period (e.g. testing and isolating, treatment). Let
p(t) denote the overall e↵ect of such preventive measures at time t, where 0  p(t)  1,
and with p(t) = 0 corresponding to no preventive measures and p(t) ⇡ 1 meaning more
or less complete isolation of all individuals.
Let î(t) denote the community fraction that cannot get infected at time t, a few of these
being currently infectious, but the majority having recovered from the disease and now
being immune (waning of immunity is here neglected since our time frame is less than a
year). At time t, it is the current (or e↵ective) reproduction number Rt of a region that
determines if a new main outbreak can take place or not. In particular, a region with
low current transmission avoids the risk for a large new outbreak as long as Rt < 1, and
regions with ongoing transmission will see a decline in transmission whenever Rt < 1.
For simple epidemic models, which assume a homogeneous community that mixes homogeneously, it is well-known that Rt = R0 (1 p(t))(1 î(t)), since R0 is reduced both
due to the preventive measures and from the fact that some contacts will be with already
infected people. This implies that Rt  1 is equivalent to p(t) 1 1/(R0 (1 î(t))), thus
quantifying, in terms of R0 and the current immunity level î(t), the minimal amount of
preventive measures needed to avoid a new large outbreak.
For more realistic epidemic models this simple relation between Rt and R0 , p(t) and î(t)
does not hold. In fact, for epidemic models acknowledging population heterogeneities
it holds that Rt < R0 (1 p(t))(1 î(t)). The main reason is that individuals having
high social activity and/or high susceptibility are more likely to be infected early in the
epidemic, implying that individuals at risk later in the epidemic will on average be less
susceptible and socially active, thus also infecting fewer if they become infected [1]. Here
we study an epidemic model in which social mixing depends on age-structure, that also
allows for variable social activity as well as variable susceptibility within age-groups. For
this model the aim is to quantify Rt as a function of R0 , p(t) and î(t), and in particular
to quantify the minimal amount of restrictions pM in for a region having initial basic

reproduction number R0 and current immunity level î (the index t is now dropped and
implicitly considered as current time).
We illustrate our findings by expressing pM in and the doubling time for di↵erent regions in
Europe and US, but these illustrations are by no means exact. First, the model is clearly
a simplification of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but even more so the estimates of
R0 and the current immunity level î for di↵erent regions contain appreciable uncertainty.
Nevertheless our results allow, for the first time to our knowledge, a risk comparison
between regions having di↵erent R0 and di↵erent immunity level î.

An epidemic model with age-cohorts, variable social
activity and variable susceptibility
The epidemic model is based on the model in Britton et al. [1]. Individuals are divided into
6 di↵erent age groups, and mixing patters are taken from the empirical study of Wallinga
et al. [11]. Within each age group individuals are divided into three categories: 50% have
normal social activity, 25% have low social activity (half as many contacts as those with
normal activity) and 25% have high social activity (double activity). It is important to
stress that social activity a↵ects both the risk of getting infected and infecting others in
that socially active individuals have more contacts both when susceptible and when being
infectious.
To this model with age-cohorts and variable social activity, studied in [1], we now also
add variable susceptibility [7], which is done similarly to variable social activity. We
assume that 50% have normal susceptibility, 25% have half the susceptibility and 25%
are twice as susceptible, and the variable susceptibility is assumed to be independent
of both social activity level and age-group. The choice to divide social activity as well
as susceptibility into three groups as above is of course quite arbitrary. This choice of
heterogeneity structure is quite moderate in that there is no tail (with individuals having
very high social activity or susceptibility) and the coefficient of variation equals 0.48 which
is moderate (see the Supplementary Materials, SM, for further comments).
It seems natural to also add variable infectivity for individuals who become infected. However, such variable infectivity will have no e↵ect on our results if it is assumed independent
of susceptibility and social activity, and is hence omitted.
We use a deterministic SEIR epidemic model (see SM) with a total of 6*3*3=54 di↵erent
types of individuals, but very similar results would be obtained from simulations of a
corresponding stochastic model assuming a large population (which can be proved using
methods in [4]). The latent state ”E” (for exposed) is assumed to have mean 3 days
followed by an infectious period (”I”) having mean 4 days, thus being quite close to other
models for the spread of COVID-19 [6]. Details of the model are given in the SM, where
it is explained that our results hold also for the corresponding model in which the latent
and infectious periods need not follow exponential distributions, and more generally for
the model in which infectives have independent and identically distributed shapes of the
infectivity profiles.
It is straightforward to numerically derive properties of the model, such as the basic
reproduction number R0 , the time dynamics and its final fraction infected when the

epidemic stops (see SM for further details).

Prevention
During the outbreak, preventive measures of varying magnitude may be put in place. We
assume that these preventive measures do not a↵ect the latent and infectious periods,
but only that they reduces the rate of infectious contacts. More precisely we make the
strong and somewhat restrictive assumption that, at time t, all contacts (between the 54
types of individuals) are reduced by the same factor p(t). This assumption can easily be
relaxed, but to explore all possibilities of contact reduction is infeasible, and among all
specific preventions the uniform one, where all contacts are reduced by the same factor,
is the most natural choice. Even when assuming such uniform reduction of contact rates,
its reduction may vary in time in di↵erent ways. However, in the SM it is shown that the
exact time allocation of the preventive measures has negligible e↵ect in our model: any
time-varying preventive measures {p(t); 0  t  t0 } from the start of the epidemic up
until some fixed time t0 , leading to the same overall fraction infected, will have nearly the
same fractions infected among the di↵erent types of individuals (see SM for details). Thus
early mild preventive measures will result in the same composition of infected individuals
as doing nothing and then suddenly going to a full lockdown, assuming the two preventive
measures lead to the same overall fraction infected.

The minimal amount of preventive measures pM in
Consider a large community in which COVID-19 spreads according to our model with
some fixed value of R0 , and for which preventive measures {p(t); 0  t  t0 } were put
in place (the same preventive e↵ect on all type of contacts). We further assume that
by t0 the transmission has more or less stopped, resulting in a fraction î having been
infected (and are immune) and the remaining fraction 1 î still susceptible. Our main
scientific question lies in quantifying what the e↵ective reproduction number Rt0 equals
if all restrictions are lifted at time t0 . If Rt0 > 1 it follows that a new large epidemic
outbreak may occur if all restrictions are lifted, as opposed to the case Rt0  1 when
herd-immunity has been reached (though smaller local outbreaks are still possible).
In the more common COVID-19 scenario that Rt0 > 1, the minimal amount of preventive
measures necessary to avoid a new large outbreak is given by pM in = 1 1/Rt0 . This
amount pM in is thus a measure for the risk of a new large outbreak. In the plots below pM in
has been computed as a function of R0 and the current immunity level î, and is quantified
by a heatmap. The left in Figure 1 is for the main model allowing for heterogeneities
with respect to age, social activity and susceptibility, and with disease-induced immunity.
The right plot in Figure 1 shows the corresponding plot when immunity comes from
vaccinating uniformly in the community (which is equivalent to disease-induced immunity
for a model assuming a completely homogeneous community). In Figure S1 of the SM
we show a similar plot for the model allowing for heterogeneities with respect to age and
social activity but not with respect to susceptibility (treated in [1]). The pM in -values for

When comparing the e↵ect of disease-induced immunity with the e↵ects of vaccine-induced
immunity a di↵erence is clearly observed in each of the two figures. More specifically,
for a given R0 and some positive immunity level î, the necessary amount of preventive
measures is substantially higher if immunity comes from vaccination as compared to
disease-induced immunity (most easily seen in Figure 2). As a numerical illustration, in a
region with R0 = 2.5 that has experienced an outbreak in a mitigated situation resulting in
an immunity level of î = 25%, the required amount of preventive measures is pM in = 29%,
whereas if instead the immunity level î = 25% came from (uniform) vaccination, then the
necessary amount of preventive measures is pM in = 1 1/(R0 ⇤ 0.75) = 47%.

An alternative way to compare the e↵ect of disease-induced immunity with vaccineinduced immunity is to compare the doubling time between disease-induced and vaccineinduced immunity if all preventive measures are dropped at a time-point when transmission is very low. To illustrate this some further assumptions about the generation time
distribution have to be made. These follow from the determinstic SEIR epidemic model
and are provided in the SM. If, as above, we consider a region having R0 = 2.5 and immunity level î = 25%, then the doubling time for disease induced immunity equals 12.7 days
whereas it equals 6.6 days if instead the immunity is vaccine-induced. (Figure S2 in the
SM gives heatmaps for the doubling times as functions of R0 and î both when immunity
comes from disease exposure and when vaccine-induced.) Consequently, if all restrictions
were to be lifted the epidemic would start growing quite quickly, but much quicker if
immunity came from vaccination. The same qualitative result applies if restrictions are
lifted only partially but still below pM in .

Fitting to data
We now use estimates of R0 and current immunity levels î for a few di↵erent groups
of related regions in order to compare the minimal preventive measures pM in of regions
within each group. The regions that are compared are: Madrid vs Cataluna (containing Barcelona) in Spain, Lombardy (containing Milan) vs Lazio (containing Rome) in
Italy, New York State vs Washington D.C., and the three Scandinavian capital regions
Stockholm, Copenhagen and Oslo.
As mentioned earlier, the model is a simplification of the real disease spreading situation
for COVID-19 by neglecting several heterogeneities (households, spatial aspects, social
networks, ...) and by assuming that earlier preventive measures acted proportionally in
the same way between all types of individuals. However, uncertainty in the estimated
R0 and î is believed to be much greater, so the obtained minimal preventive measures
pM in for di↵erent regions are to be interpreted as illustrations rather than exact numbers.
Nevertheless it allows for a comparison between regions with similar R0 but di↵erent
immunity levels, as well as comparing regions with higher R0 and immunity levels with
regions having both lower.
For the sake of illustration we make the slightly unrealistic assumption that all regions
have the same the same mixing between age groups, the same age-structure and the same
variation in social activity and variation in susceptibility. The only di↵erences between
compared regions are the overall rate of contacts (measured by R0 ) and the amount of
preventive measures thus leading to di↵erent immunity levels î.

As described above it is assumed that there currently is no or low transmission. However,
the results apply also to the situation where there is substantial ongoing transmission, the
only di↵erence is that then the issue is not to avoid a new wave, but to make transmission
start declining.
We focus on comparing regions close to each other (making our assumption of similar
mixing, age structure and variable activity and susceptibility more reasonable) and use
estimates of R0 and immunity levels î taken from the same literaure source. In the SM
we explain in detail how the estimates are obtained, but in brief it is as follows. The
European country-specific R0 estimates are taken from [6] (except for Sweden for which
the estimate is taken from its preprint [5], see SM for motivation). To obtain separate
estimates of the two Spanish regions we use [2] estimating that Madrid has about 5%
higher R0 than Cataluna (a conservative estimate of the di↵erence). For Italy, Riccardo
et al. [8] estimates more or less identical (initial) basic reproduction numbers for Lombardy
and Lazio, so here we have not distinguished between the two regions. The R0 estimates
for New York and Washington D.C. are taken from [9].
The immunity levels are harder to find estimates of in the literature. For this reason
we have used the official number of case fatalities per 100 000 individuals in the separate
regions as of October 5, 2020, and assumed that the infection fatality risk (ifr ) equals 0.5%
(slightly smaller than the estimated ifr for China in [10]). By assuming that all infected
individuals become immune, and assuming no prior immunity, this gives an estimated
immunity level. Of course, the ifr most likely di↵ers substantially between regions owing
to di↵erences in age-distribution and health care. Further, the choice to set if r = 0.5% is
a rough approximation, as is the assumption that all infected become immune and that
there is no prior immunity. The region-specific immunity levels î should hence be seen
as illustrations, but their order relations are most likely correct and when this holds true
the qualitative comparison statements remain true.

the heatmap (Figure 1). As a comparison the initial minimal preventive level required
(start)
to avoid a large outbreak at the start (when î = 0), pM in = 1 1/R0 , is listed, as is
the minimal preventive level required to avoid an outbreak if the current immunity level
(V ac)
î was obtained instead from uniform vaccination, pM in = 1 1/(R0 (1 î)). (Table S1 in
the SM give the corresponding doubling times if restrictions were lifted.)
It is seen that no studied region has reached herd immunity, meaning that none of the
regions can lift all restrictions without risking a new large outbreak. By comparing pM in
(start)
with pM in it is further seen that the high levels of required preventive measures at the
start of the epidemic have been reduced substantially in regions having su↵ered from
high transmission during the first epidemic wave. More specifically, pM in in Lazio (includes Rome) now clearly exceeds that of Lombardy (includes Milan). Cataluna (includes
Barcelona) also seems to require slightly more preventive measures than the Madrid region, but the di↵erence is small. New York still needs more preventive measures than
Washington D.C., but the di↵erence has dropped compared to the initial required minimal levels. Among the Nordic capital regions, Stockholm had the highest initial minimal
preventive measures to avoid an outbreak, whereas now Copenhagen has highest minimal
preventive measures followed by Oslo, but the di↵erences are small.
(V ac)

If instead pM in values are compared with pM in , it is seen that disease-induced immunity plays a more significant roll as compared with immunity achieved by vaccination.
In particular, the regions having highest immunity levels (New York, Madrid and Lombardy) would clearly have larger minimal preventive requirements had immunity come
from vaccination.

Discussion
The main aim of the paper has been to compare the levels of restrictions needed to
avoid new major outbreaks of COVID-19 for di↵erent regions having di↵erent initial
potential (R0 ) and di↵erent current immunity levels î. Clearly, regions with high R0
that have not yet experienced much spreading need to be most careful, but perhaps
more interesting is a comparison between a region with high R0 having experienced much
transmission, with another region having smaller R0 but also having lower immunity.
The main conclusion from our study is that disease-induced immunity reduces the risk
for a large future outbreak substantially more than when immunity is achieved from
vaccination. Smaller local outbreaks are possible irrespective of region and are not the
focus of the present paper.
In the comparison of di↵erent regions it is seen that the region now requiring the highest amount of preventive measures may have switched from a region with high R0 that
has experienced high transmission, to another region having smaller R0 but which has
experienced less transmission.
The epidemic model studied allows for individual variation owing to age, social activity
and variable susceptibility. The age e↵ect is taken from an empirical study. However, the
variation owing to social activity and variable susceptibility is chosen arbitrary but the
choice is believed to be less variable (with lighter tails) than reality. Many other heterogeneities are ignored (e.g. households, schools and work places, spatial aspects, travel and

commuting, ...) but it is believed that the e↵ect of adding such other heterogeneities is
that pM in is shifted close to proportionally.
A greater uncertainty lies in the estimation of R0 and the immunity levels î, but this can
be reduced once better data become available. The estimates of pM in in Table 1 are hence
only to be interpreted as illustrations.
A di↵erent extension could be to consider preventive measures acting di↵erently between
di↵erent types of individual. The present framework can easily be extended to this situation, the missing information is estimates of how prevention have reduced contacts
di↵erently between di↵erent pair of subgroups of individuals.
We conjecture that our two main qualitative results hold true. These are that the e↵ect
of disease-induced immunity is greater than vaccine-induced immunity, and that regions
having su↵ered from many infections up until now, may be in a better situation with
regards to future outbreaks as compared to other regions with lower R0 but with no or
low immunity levels.

Materials and Methods
A deterministic SEIR model and the fraction of the population
infected
In this supplementary information we describe the deterministic SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Removed) epidemic model in a population partitioned by age, activity
level and (relative) susceptibility. The model is an extension of the one in [2], and the
presentation below hence follows closely (and partly copies) the model presentation in the
SI of [2]. For reasons of notational convenience we label the types (the combination of age,
activity level and susceptibility level) from 1 to m, where m is the product of the number
of age cohorts, the number of activity levels and the number of susceptibility levels. In
our model m = 6 ⇥ 3 ⇥ 3 = 54. A more detailed exposition than the one presented here
can be found in [1, Sections 5.5 and 6.2].
We assume that
P for all j 2 {1, · · · , m} the population consists of nj people of type
j. We set n = m
j=1 nj and ⇡j = nj /n. We assume that the population is large and
closed, in the sense that we do not consider births, deaths (other than possibly the deaths
caused by the infectious disease) and migration. Throughout the epidemic, ni is fixed, so
people who die from the infectious disease are still considered part of the population. For
j, k 2 {1, · · · , m}, every given person of type j makes “infectious contacts” with every
given person of type k independently at rate ↵ajk /n. If at the time of such a contact the
type-j person is infectious and the type-k person is susceptible then the latter becomes
latently infected (Exposed). People of the same type may infect each other, so ajj may be
strictly positive (and often is!). Because the definition of an infectious contact includes
that the contact leads to transmission of the disease, it is not necessarily the case that ajk
is equal to akj . For the same reason it is possible that the relative susceptibility exceeds 1.
The parameter ↵ is a scaling parameter, used to quantify the impact of control measures
in the main paper, without measures ↵ is set so that R0 has the desired value. Exposed
individuals become Infectious at constant rate and infectious individuals recover or die
(are Removed) at constant rate µ. The rates of becoming infectious and removal are
assumed to be independent of type. It is straightforward to extend the model to make
those rates age and/or activity level and/or susceptibility level dependent. However,
dependence on these factors would have impact on the relationship between pM in and the
doubling time after the first wave.
In the described multi-type SEIR model, the expected number of people of type k
that are infected by an infected person of type j during the early stages of the epidemic
is nk ⇥ (↵ajk /n) ⇥ (1/µ) = ⇡k ↵ajk /µ, where 1/µ is the expected duration of an infectious
period. The next-generation matrix M has (for j, k 2 {1, · · · , m}) as element in the j-th
row and k-th column the quantity ⇡k ↵ajk /µ. Suppose that the next-generation M is
irreducible, i.e. that for any j, k 2 {1, · · · , m} it is possible for the infection of a type-j
individual to lead to the infection of a type-k individual, either directly or through a chain

of infectives involving other types. It is easily seen that this condition is satisfied in our
model. The basic reproduction number R0 is then defined as the largest eigenvalue of M ;
it is necessarily real and positive. If R0 > 1, then a large outbreak is possible with strictly
positive probability, while if R0  1 an outbreak stays small with probability 1.
In the model under consideration, where the rates and µ are independent of the type
of a person, there exists a Malthusian parameter ⇢ such that the number of infectious
individuals grows initially as e⇢t , where ⇢ < 0 if R0 < 1 and ⇢ > 0 if R0 > 1. In [14] it
is shown that the relationship between ⇢ and R0 is (under the assumed conditions) the
same for a multitype population as it is for a homogeneous population, where ⇢ satisfies
Z 1
e ⇢t (t)dt,

with (t) being the expected rate of new infections caused by a person t time units after
he or she was infected (e.g. p 12 in [3]). (Note that R0 1 (t) gives the probability density
function of generation-time of the epidemic.) In our model

The doubling time is given by [ln 2]/⇢.
We set Sj (t) to be the number of people of type j that are susceptible to the disease
at time t, Ej (t) the number of people of type j that are latently infected, Ij (t) the
number of infectious people of type j and Rj (t) the number of removed people of type
j (j 2 {1, · · · , m}). Note that Sj (t) + Ej (t) + Ij (t) + Rj (t) = nj = ⇡j n for all t

because the population is closed. Again for j 2 {1, · · · , m}, we define sj (t) = Sj (t)/nj ,
ej (t) = Ej (t)/nj , ij (t) = Ij (t)/nj and rj (t) = Rj (t)/nj .
Theory on Markov processes [6, Chapter 11] (see also [1, Section 5.5] for the single
type counterpart) gives that for large n the above model can be described well by the

To be complete, in the main text, we use when analysing the time-dependent behaviour
of an epidemic that for all j 2 {1, · · · , m}, sj (0) = 1 ✏, ej (0) = ✏ and ij (0) = rj (0) = 0.
In the analysis below we do not impose specific assumptions on the initial conditions.
The epidemic will ultimately go extinct, because the population is closed, so for all
j 2 {1, · · · , m} we have that ej (t) ! 0 and ij (t) ! 0 as t ! 1. Thus sj (t) + rj (t) ! 1
as t ! 1. Furthermore sj (t) is non-increasing, so sj (1) = limt!1 sj (t) exists.
It can be shown in the spirit of [1, Equation (6.2)] that for j 2 {1, · · · , m},

↵

To understand this identity we observe first that sjj (0) is the fraction of initially susceptible
people of type j who escape the epidemic, while the sum in the right-hand side can be
written as

In words the summands read as the number of people of type k that were infectious at some
moment during the epidemic, times the rate at which a type-k person makes infectious
contacts with someone of type j, times the expected time an infected person is infectious.
In other words, the right-hand side is the cumulative force of infection during the entire
epidemic acting on a person of type j. Standard theory on epidemics gives that minus
the natural logarithm of the probability that a given initially susceptible person of type j
avoids infection is the cumulative force of infection acting on that person. Thus (1) gives
that the fraction of initially susceptible people that are ultimately still susceptible is equal
to the probability that a given initially susceptible person avoids infection. This argument
is independent of the Markov SEIR structure of our model, and it is straightforward to
generalize the results of the paper to epidemic models in which infected people have a
general random infectivity profile as long as the expected shape of the infectivity profile
(i.e. they have the same density for the generation time) does not depend on the type
of the infectious person. In particular, note that the calculation of pM in described below
holds for this more general model.
If R0 > 1 and the epidemic is initiated by few infectives in a large population then,
conditional upon a large outbreak occurring, the final fractions of initially susceptible
people of the di↵erent types are given by the unique solution of (1), with sj (0) = 1 and
rj (0) = 0 for all j 2 {1, · · · , m}, that satisfies sj (1) < 1 for all j 2 {1, · · · , m}.

The population matrix
For the age structured population and contact intensities between di↵erent age groups
we used [17] (just as was done in [2]). The age groups are 0-5, 6-12, 13-19, 20-39, 40-59

and 60+. The contact matrix A† , i.e. the matrix with elements {a†jk ; j, k 2 {1, · · · , 6}}
is deduced from Table 1 of [17]. Note that the numbers reported in Table 1 of [17]
are the expected number of contacts from a person of type j with people of type k:
cjk = nk a†jk /n = ⇡k† a†jk . (We use a†jk and ⇡ † instead of ajk and ⇡ because we already
use a and ⇡ to denote the fractions in the population of the di↵erent types which are
characterised by age cohort, activity level and susceptibility level, while a† and ⇡ † denote
contact rates and fractions in the population of the di↵erent age cohorts only). We
then divide the elements of Table 1 by the corresponding ⇡k† to obtain the matrix A† .
(The values of ⇡j† , j 2 {1, · · · , 6}, are obtained using Appendix Table 1 of [17] reflecting
the Dutch population in 2006; ⇡1† = 0.0725, ⇡2† = 0.0866, ⇡3† = 0.1124, ⇡4† = 0.3323,
⇡5† = 0.2267, ⇡6† = 0.1695.) We further multiply this matrix by a constant ↵ to give us
freedom to set a desired value for R0 . The contact matrix is then

As explained in the main text we can use this matrix to generate the 54 by 54 contact
matrix for the model in which we take age, activity level and susceptibility level into
account in the following way. For reasons of clarity we denote the type of a person now
by a three-dimensional vector (c, a, s), where the first entry stands for the age cohort,
which takes a value in {1, · · · , 6}, the second entry stands for social activity level, which
can take values {1/2, 1, 2} depending on whether the level is low, medium or high and the
third entry stands for the level of susceptibility which in our example also takes values
{1/2, 1, 2} depending on whether the relative susceptibility is low, medium or high.
The expected number of type-(c0 , a0 , s0 ) people infected by a given infected person of
type (c, a, s) is then Cc,c0 ⇥ a ⇥ a0 ⇥ s0 , where Cc,c0 = ↵A†c,c0 ⇡c0 ,a0 ,s0 , where ⇡c0 ,a0 ,s0 is the
fraction of the population with type (c0 , a0 , s0 ).

Calculation of pM in
Let R̄0 be the desired value of R0 in the absence of preventive measures and ↵0 be
the corresponding value of ↵. Then ↵0 is such that largest eigenvalue of the matrix
[↵0 µ 1 ajk ⇡k ] (i.e. the matrix having element ↵0 µ 1 ajk ⇡k in its j-th row and k-th column)
is R̄0 . For ↵ 2 (R̄0 1 ↵0 , ↵0 ], let ⌧ (↵) = (⌧1 (↵), · · · , ⌧m (↵)), where ⌧j (↵) = 1 sj (1, ↵)
and sj (1, ↵) (j 2 {1, · · · , m}) is the solution of (1), when sj (0) = 1 and rj (0) = 0 for all

for an epidemic among the remaining susceptible population when the epidemic with
↵ = ↵⇤ has finished and all preventive measures are lifted (so ↵ is then set to ↵0 ), whence
hD is the disease-induced herd immunity level for the epidemic with R0 = R̄0 . (The
notation ↵⇤ and hD are as in [2].)
For fixed R̄0 > 1 and immunity level î 2 (0, hD ), we obtain pMP
in as follows. Let ↵1 =
↵0 /R̄0 , so the epidemic with ↵ = ↵1 has R0 = 1. Note that ⌧ (↵) = 1
j=1 ⇡j ⌧j (↵) is strictly
increasing on [↵1 , ↵0 ], ⌧ (↵1 ) = 0 and ⌧ (↵⇤ ) = hD . Thus there exists a unique ↵
ˆ 2 (↵1 , ↵⇤ )
1
such that ⌧ (ˆ
↵) = î. Let R̂0 be the largest eigenvalue of the matrix [↵0 µ ajk ⇡k (1 ⌧k (ˆ
↵))].
Then R̂0 is the basic reproduction number for an epidemic with no preventive measures
(i.e. with ↵ = ↵0 ) among the susceptible population remaining when the epidemic with
↵=↵
ˆ has finished. It follows that pM in , the minimum amount of preventive measures
to necessarily prevent a large outbreak among this remaining susceptible population, is
given by 1 R̂0 1 .

The timing of preventive measures a↵ect the overall fraction infected but not its composition
The special case where the deterministic SEIR epidemic model described above has a nextgeneration matrix which splits up into a product with one factor depending on the type of
the infector and the other factor on the type of the susceptible type is known as separable
mixing [5]. In the separable mixing situation, two preventive measure {p1 (t); 0  t  t1 }
and {p2 (t); 0  t  t2 } leading to the same overall fraction infected at times t1 and t2 ,
respectively, also have the same fraction infected among all di↵erent types of individuals
(i.e. the same composition of infected) at those times, as we now show.
Suppose that ajk = fj gk (j, k 2 {1, · · · , m}), where fj > 0 and gj > 0 for all j 2
{1, · · · , m}, and that ↵ is time-dependent and denoted by ↵(t) = ↵0 p(t), where ↵0 is the
value of ↵ in the absence of any preventive measures. Then the di↵erential equation for
sj (t) becomes

and then sj (t0 ) (j 2 {2, · · · , m}) are uniquely determined by (3). Note that if the
immunity level î is fixed then the solution of (4) is independent of the preventive measure
of {p(t); t
0} and hence so are the fractions infected among the di↵erent types when
the immunity level î is reached.
The model considered in the present paper is not of the separable mixing form. More
precisely, the variable social activity and the variable susceptibility enter the expression
in the form of separable mixing, but the age-structure does not. However, the e↵ect
of this rather small deviation from separable mixing is negligible as Figure S3 shows. In
Figure S3 we have plotted pM in as a function of the disease-induced immunity î (assuming
R0 = 2.5) for two very distinct types of preventive measures. The blue curve corresponds
to a constant preventive measure p(t) = p until the epidemic stops, where the value p
is induced by the final overall fraction infected î. The red curve is instead obtained by
having no restrictions until the level î is reached and at this time the epidemic is stopped
(we can think of a complete lockdown). We hence have two very di↵erent preventive
measures, one having constant restrictions from the start and the other strategy having
no preventive measures until a sudden stop. Nevertheless we see that the two curves in
Figure S3 are indistinguishable.
The consequence is that the minimal preventive measures required to prevent future
outbreaks, pM in under a mitigated epidemic outbreak leading to an overall immunity level
î is for all intents and purposes independent of how the preventive measures have varied
over time.

Adding variable infectivity has no e↵ect
We now argue why adding variable infectivity to the other heterogeneities has no e↵ect
on the presented results as long as this variable infectivity is independent of age, social
activity and susceptibility. In fact, the rate of infection from individuals of type (c, a, s)
acting on susceptibles of type (c0 , a0 , s0 ) depends only on the mean infectivity of infectives
of type (c, a, s). Further, when considering a deterministic model, corresponding to an
infinite population, this mean is deterministic, implying that only the mean infectivity
enters the equations. The same conclusion holds in a corresponding stochastic model in
the limit as the total population size n ! 1, which can be shown either by appealing to
the law of large numbers for density dependent population processes (see e.g. [6, Chapter
11, Theorem 11.2.2] or [3, Theorem 2.2.7] for a version with time-dependent transition
rates) or in a more general setting by using the Sellke construction of the epidemic (see
e.g. [1, Section 6.1]). Note that the model with separable mixing considered above includes
the case of variable infectivity, which enters via fj (j 2 {1, · · · , m}). However, for given

immunity level î, the fractions of the di↵erent types infected sj (t0 ) (j 2 {1, · · · , m}) when
an overall fraction î of the population is infected do not depend on fj (j 2 {1, · · · , m})
and hence are independent of any variability in infectivity.

The individual variation of social activity and susceptibility
The individual heterogeneity of social activity and susceptibility was modelled identically
and assumed to be independent, independent also of the age-cohort. It was assumed that
50% have medium or normal value, 25% has half the value and 25% had double the value.
This choice is of course very arbitrary and made mainly in order not to have too many
di↵erent types of individuals (even so there are 54 types!).
Beside the specific form, a relevant question is if the model exaggerates individual
heterogeneity. We think this is not the case. For one thing, the distributions of social
activity and susceptibility in the model have no heavy right tails, nor do they have values
close to 0, and such tails typically have major implications (cf. epidemics on networks
where heavy tail degree distributions alter R0 dramatically [11]).
The amount of variation is sometimes quantified
p by the coefficient of variation c.v.,
defined for a positive random variable by c.v. = V ar(X)/E(X). Our model, having
values 0.5, 1 and 2 with respective probabilities 0.25, 0.5 and 0.25, hence has c.v. = 0.48
(note that c.v. is independent of the actual values 0.5, 1 and 2 – multiplying these values
by any positive constant k results in the same c.v.). A c.v. of the order 0.5 by no means
reflects an unusually high individual variation. In fact, Gomes et al. [9], and references
therein, report c.v. values between 2 and 4 (for a combination of variable susceptibility
and social activity) for di↵erent diseases including COVID-19.

Description of R0 and î values in Tables 1 and S1
As explained in the main text, except for Sweden, the country specific R0 estimates of the
European countries given in Table 1 are taken from [8]. The R0 estimate for Sweden (3.9)
is taken instead from the corresponding preprint [7]. The reason for making this change is
that in the preprint Sweden clearly had the highest R0 among the Scandinavian countries,
whereas in the published version ([8]) Sweden’s R0 estimate had dropped dramatically
from 3.9 to 2.7 while Norway’s and Denmark’s estimates were almost unchanged (in fact
both increased by 0.2). The reason for this change comes from problems with fitting the
e↵ects of Sweden’s unusual preventive measures later in the epidemic and is an artefact of
jointly estimating Rt later in the epidemic (personal communication with Neil Ferguson).
The estimates of R0 for New York (the state) and Washington D.C. were taken from
[15]. As for the Spanish and Italian subregions, we have rescaled the country estimates
from [8] by the relation between region-specific estimates of Madrid and Cataluna, and
between Lombardia and Lazio. For Spain, Madrid was estimated to have about a 5%
higher R0 than Cataluna [4], so Madrid was scaled up by 2.5% and Cataluna scaled down

by 2.5%. For Italy the two region-specific estimates di↵ered by only 1%, so these estimates
were left unchanged.
The number of case fatalities per 100 000 individual reported in Table 1 were all
downloaded from official websites. The regions in Spain, Italy, US and Sweden were
downloaded from Wikipedia October 5, 2020. The number of case fatalities per 100k
for Denmark is from Danish Infectious Disease Institut [13] per September 14, 2020,
and finally from Oslo it comes from [10] with fatalities up to September 23 2020. By
assuming an infection fatality rate (if r) of 0.5% in all regions considered (slightly smaller
than estimated for COVID-19 in China [16]), and assuming that all infected individuals
become immune but assuming no prior immunity, this gives the region-specific immunity
estimates î of Table 1. We again stress that these are just illustrations since several
assumptions are not met. For example, the if r is most likely higher in New York (and
possible also in Lombardy) as compared to the other regions. Moreover, the true if r
may very well be as large as 1% which would reduce all î by 50%, though this would not
change their relative sizes.

Figure S2: Heatmap for the doubling time of the epidemic growth as a function of R0 and
immunity î if all restrictions are lifted (assumptions about generation time is explained on
p3 of the SM). The left plot is when immunity is disease-induced and the right when immunity is vaccine-induced. The white region is where herd-immunity is achieved meaning
that an epidemic will not grow implying that there is no doubling time.

Figure S3: Plot of the pM in as a function of î assuming R0 = 2.5. The blue curve is for
the situation that preventive measures are kept constant at a level such that the outbreak
ceases when a fraction exactly î of the population has been infected, and the red curve
is obtained when there are no preventive measures until the level î is reached – then the
epidemic is stopped. The two curves are indistinguishable.
