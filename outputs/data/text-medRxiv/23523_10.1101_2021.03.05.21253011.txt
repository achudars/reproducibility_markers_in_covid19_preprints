Abstract

24

Background: The vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections are uncomplicated and do not require

25

hospitalization, but contribute to ongoing transmission. Our understanding of the clinical course

26

of uncomplicated COVID-19 remains limited.

27

Methods: We detailed the natural history of uncomplicated COVID-19 among 120 outpatients

28

enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of Peginterferon Lambda. We characterized symptom

29

trajectory and clusters using exploratory factor analysis, assessed predictors of symptom

30

resolution and cessation of oropharyngeal viral shedding using Cox proportional hazard models,

31

and evaluated associations between symptoms and viral shedding using mixed effects linear

32

models.

33

Results: Headache, myalgias and chills peaked at day 4 after symptom onset; cough peaked on

34

day 9. Two distinct symptom cluster trajectories were identified; one with mild, upper

35

respiratory symptoms, and the other with more severe and prolonged inflammatory symptoms.

36

The median time to symptom resolution from earliest symptom onset was 17 days (95% CI 14-

37

18). Neither enrollment SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels (Hazard ratio [HR] 1.88, 95% CI 0.84-4.20)

38

nor oropharyngeal viral load at enrollment (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98-1.05) were significantly

39

associated with the time to symptom resolution. The median time to cessation of viral shedding

40

was 10 days (95% CI 8-12), with higher SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels at enrollment associated with

41

hastened resolution of viral shedding (HR 3.12, 95% CI 1.4-6.9, p=0.005). Myalgia, joint pains,

42

and chills were associated with a significantly greater odds of oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA

43

detection.

44

Conclusions: In this outpatient cohort, inflammatory symptoms peaked early and were

45

associated with ongoing SARS-CoV-2 replication.

SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were associated

Introduction

52

As of February 2021, 109 million individuals have been confirmed infected with SARS-CoV-2,

53

and over 2.4 million have died.(1) Despite high mortality in the elderly and among those with

54

medical comorbidities, the vast majority of individuals have uncomplicated disease, with only

55

mild to moderate symptoms, and do not require hospitalization. However, these individuals

56

contribute to ongoing transmission, and some develop prolonged symptoms and sustained

57

disability.(2) A better understanding of the natural history of uncomplicated COVID-19 would

58

help guide the development of therapeutics needed to shorten the duration of viral shedding,

59

relieve symptoms, and prevent hospitalizations.

60
61

Most published reports of COVID-19 symptomatology are derived from hospitalized patients, in

62

whom fever and shortness of breath are common (3-5). In contrast, outpatients with more mild

63

disease report less fever, but hyposmia is more common(6, 7). Data on symptom trajectories and

64

clusters is limited, as studies in outpatients have largely been limited to cross-sectional surveys.

65

Furthermore, the relationship of these syndromes to viral shedding and SARS-CoV-2 antibody

66

responses have not been described in detail.

67
68

In this study, we leveraged a cohort of participants with uncomplicated COVID-19 enrolled in a

69

randomized, placebo-controlled trial of Peginterferon Lambda to perform a detailed examination

70

of the symptomatology and natural history of uncomplicated SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aimed

71

to 1) characterize symptom trajectories and clusters; 2) assess predictors of symptom resolution

73

and viral shedding.

75

Methods

76

Study setting and participants

77

SARS-CoV-2-infected outpatients were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2

78

trial of Peginterferon Lambda-1a (Lambda, NCT04331899). Inclusion/exclusion criteria and the

79

study protocol for the trial have been published.(8) Briefly, adults aged 18-75 years with an FDA

80

emergency use authorized reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive for

81

SARS-CoV-2 within 72 hours prior to enrollment were eligible for study participation. Exclusion

82

criteria included hospitalization, respiratory rate >20 breaths per minute, room air oxygen

83

saturation <94%, pregnancy or breastfeeding, decompensated liver disease, recent use of

84

investigational and/or immunomodulatory agents for treatment of COVID-19, and prespecified

85

lab abnormalities.

86
87

Study procedures

88

On the day of enrollment, participants completed a standardized history, including the duration

89

of symptoms prior to enrollment, physical exam and bloodwork. Participants were randomized

90

1:1 to receive a single subcutaneous injection of Lambda or saline placebo and followed for 28

91

days. Participants completed a daily symptom questionnaire and recorded daily in-home

92

measurements of temperature and oxygen saturation using study-provided devices (REDCap

93

Cloud). In-person visits were conducted on Days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 post-enrollment

94

with assessment of symptoms and vitals, and collection of oropharyngeal swabs (FLOQ Swabs;

95

Copan Diagnostics). Peripheral blood was collected for assessment of complete blood count,

96

metabolic panel, and SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor

97

binding domain (RBD, Supplementary Methods).

98
99

Statistical analysis

100

Analyses were conducted in R version 4.0.2(9) or Stata SE (version 14). Cohort demographics,

101

baseline characteristics and distribution of symptom prevalence were summarized descriptively.

102

Symptom duration prior to enrollment determined symptom start day. Symptoms reported pre-

103

enrollment were assumed to have been continuously experienced from the first reported day until

104

enrollment. Symptoms occurring more than 21 days prior to enrollment were deemed non-

105

COVID related and excluded. Outcomes measured included symptom prevalence and duration,

106

time to resolution of symptoms and cessation of viral shedding.

107
108

Symptom prevalence and duration

109

Differences in symptom prevalence and the proportion of participants reporting symptoms over

110

time by treatment arm were tested using the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test and Fisher’s exact test,

111

respectively. Since duration of symptoms and duration of viral shedding were similar between

112

treatment arms,(8) these tests confirmed adjustment for treatment arm was not needed in our

113

symptom-specific adjusted models. We therefore included participants from both the Lambda

114

and placebo arms in this analysis. Repeated measures of at-home temperature and oxygen

115

saturation were modeled using linear regression models with robust standard errors and

116

generalized estimating equations to account for repeated measures within participants.

Symptom clusters

119

Spearman’s correlation coefficient and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) were used to assess

120

pairwise correlations between symptom severity and whether symptoms clustered at various days

121

from symptom onset, respectively. EFA was carried out on symptoms reported at symptom onset

122

and on days 4, 7, 10, 14, and 21 after symptom onset. Only symptoms with more than 5% overall

123

study prevalence were chosen for examination (Supplementary Methods). Changes in factors

124

derived and symptoms contributing to each factor were compared descriptively across time

125

points of interest. The joint trajectory of symptoms was assessed to determine whether

126

participant clusters persist over time (Supplementary Methods). Fisher’s exact test and the

127

Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test were used to test for differences in baseline characteristics and

128

demographics by cluster assignment.

129
130

Time to event analyses

131

Time to first symptom resolution among those reporting symptoms was defined in two ways: 1)

132

as time from symptom onset, and 2) as time from enrollment, until the first day when no

133

symptoms were reported, given that vital signs and laboratories were not measured prior to

134

enrollment. Participants who did not experience resolution were censored on the day of their last

135

reported symptom. Cox proportional hazards models were fit as a function of covariates of

136

interest. Both models included age at randomization, sex, body mass index (BMI), and

137

race/ethnicity. The time from enrollment model additionally included pre-enrollment symptom

138

duration, oxygen saturation, heart rate, alanine transaminase (ALT), white blood count,

139

lymphocyte count, oropharyngeal PCR result, and antibody levels at enrollment. The

140

proportional hazards assumption was assessed by evaluating scaled Schoenfeld residuals.(10)

142

Time to cessation of viral shedding was defined as time from first recorded positive test (pre-

143

enrollment) until first of two consecutive negative oropharyngeal tests. Participants who did not

144

experience shedding cessation were censored at the time of their last positive test or Day 1 if no

145

positive test was observed. Cox proportional hazards model were fit as a function of all

146

demographic and vital/lab measurements at enrollment described above, excluding pre-

147

enrollment symptom duration.

148
149

For all models, crude and adjusted hazard ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and Kaplan-Meier

150

estimates were reported.

151
152

Associations between viral detection and symptomology

153

Mixed effect logistic regression models were fit to PCR result (positive vs negative) as a

154

function of symptom reported (yes vs no), days from randomization, continuous age at

155

randomization, sex, treatment arm, and a random effect for participant to account for repeated

156

measures over time within a participant. This model was fit to each of the 16 symptoms. Days

157

from enrollment was used in order to align the longitudinal PCR and symptom data. Only days

158

when both the symptom questionnaire and PCR results were available were included. Odds

159

ratios, 95% CIs, and p-values for symptom were reported from each model.

160
161

Additional analyses

162

Fisher’s exact test and the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test were used to test for differences in

163

baseline characteristics and demographics by development of antibodies at Day 28 among those

164

negative at baseline.

Results

169

Study participants

170

We enrolled 120 participants between April 25 and July 17, 2020 (Figure S1). The median age

171

was 36 years, 50 participants (41.7%) were female, and 75 (62.5%) were LatinX ethnicity (Table

172

1). At enrollment, 3 (2.5%) of participants had a temperature >100.4° F, and 49 (40.8%) were

173

SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositive. Antibody level at enrollment was positively associated with day

174

since symptom onset (Figure S2). Overall, 110 participants (91.7%) completed 28 days of follow

175

up, and the proportion of missing follow-up visits was 44/960 (4.6%).

176
177

Symptom prevalence and trajectories

178

The most prevalent symptoms over the course of 28 days of follow up were fatigue (n=95,

179

79.2%), decreased smell/taste (n=89, 74.2%), and cough (n=85, 70.8%, Figure 1a). Headache,

180

myalgias and chills were the first symptoms to peak at day 4, while cough did not peak until day

181

9 (Figure 1b). In 18/120 (15%) of participants, symptoms persisted through day 28 follow-up,

182

with fatigue (7/18), cough and decreased taste/smell (5/18), and shortness of breath (4/18)

183

reported in participants. There were significant differences in prevalence of any symptom over

184

the entire study between participants randomized to Lambda vs placebo(8)(Figure S4A-D ).

185

Of 2730 at-home daily oral temperature measurements among 118 participants (average 23.1

186

measurements/participant), only 7 (0.3%) measurements in 6 participants were >100.4° F.

187

However, oral temperatures decreased significantly after enrollment, with mean temperatures

declining from 97.9°F (95% CI 97.8-98.0) between days 1-6 to 97.6°F (95% CI 97.5-97.7)

189

between days 7-28 (coef 0.75, 95% CI 0.66-0.84, P<0.001, Figure 2a). In parallel, at home

190

oxygen saturation measurements increased from 96.9% (95% CI 96.6-97.2) from days 1-<7 to

191

97.4% (95% CI 97.2-97.6) from days 7-28 (coef 0.46, 95% CI 0.21-0.72, P<0.001, Figure 2b).

192
193

Symptom Clusters

194

On the day of symptom onset (day 0), three symptom clusters were identified (Figure 3, Table

195

S1, Figures S5A-F) – inflammatory (myalgias, joint pain, fatigue, headache), respiratory

196

(shortness of breath, runny nose), and other (decreased smell/taste, chest pain/pressure), although

197

poor within-cluster reliability was found, in which symptoms did not consistently load on the

198

same factor (Figure 3A). The inflammatory symptom cluster persisted and increased in reliability

199

from Day 4 to Day 10 before decreasing (Figure 3A,B). After day 0, two distinct respiratory

200

clusters were identified, including upper (sore throat, runny nose, nausea) and lower (shortness

201

of breath, cough, chest pain/pressure) respiratory tract symptoms. Interestingly, a larger cluster

202

encompassing lower respiratory and inflammatory clusters emerged between days 7 and 10 of

203

symptom onset.

204
205

We next assessed the joint trajectory of symptoms over time among 81 participants with

206

symptom data, and two participant groups emerged (Figure 4). Cluster B (n=7) generally had

207

greater symptom severity and/or later peak severity than cluster A, especially chest

208

pain/pressure, fatigue, and myalgias. However, cluster A (n=74) had slightly higher prevalence

209

of runny nose and sore throat compared to cluster B. There were no differences between

210

Clusters A and B in terms of demographics, BMI, initial lab values, or baseline seropositivity

211

(Table S2). While participants in cluster B had slightly shorter time to viral shedding cessation,

212

these differences were not statistically significant.

213
214

Predictors of symptom resolution

215

Median time to symptom resolution from earliest symptom onset was 17 days (95% CI 14-18).

216

Participants with higher BMI were less likely to experience symptom resolution (hazard ratio

217

[95% CI]: 0.92 [0.85-1.0, Figure 5a). Participants identifying as LatinX had more rapid symptom

218

resolution compared to those identifying as non-LatinX, White participants (hazard ratio [95%

219

CI]: 2.10 [1.23-3.60]). When considering predictors of symptom resolution from the time of

220

enrollment, for every 10 unit increase in ALT at enrollment, likelihood of symptom resolution

221

increased by 10% (Figure 5b). Neither enrollment antibody levels nor oropharyngeal swab viral

222

loads were significantly associated with symptom resolution (Figure 5b). Results were similar

223

when stratifying by treatment arm (data not shown).

224
225

Virologic trajectories and predictors of viral shedding cessation

226

The median time to cessation of oropharyngeal viral shedding was 10 days from first reported

227

positive test (95% CI: 8-12), with 108 participants experiencing cessation of viral shedding

228

during the study. Higher SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels (HR [95% CI]: 3.3 [1.5, 7.2]) at enrollment

229

were associated with more rapid viral shedding cessation (Figure 6). Higher cycle threshold (Ct)

230

values at enrollment were also associated with more rapid viral shedding cessation in an

231

independent model (HR [95% CI]: 1.2 [1.1, 1.2], p<0.001). No other baseline demographics or

232

measured laboratory values were significantly associated with viral shedding cessation (Figure

233

6). Results were similar when stratifying by treatment arm (data not shown).

234
235

Associations between clinical symptoms and oropharyngeal viral shedding

236

We visually assessed antibody levels over time (Figure 7A) and whether time from enrollment

237

until viral shedding cessation and symptom resolution were similar in our cohort (Figure 7B). At

238

enrollment, 40.8% (49/120) study participants were SARS-CoV-2 seropositive; this increased to

239

87.7% (100/114) by day 5, and 95.5% (106/111) by day 14 (Figure 7A). Half of participants

240

included stopped shedding virus by 7 days after enrollment, while half of participants

241

experienced symptom resolution 2 days later on study day 9. While most participants

242

experienced shedding cessation before their symptoms resolved, the survival probability was

243

similar over time for both outcomes.

244
245

Finally, we assessed whether specific symptoms were associated with detection of oropharyngeal

246

SARS-CoV-2 RNA. On each day, the majority of participants reporting symptoms had

247

detectable oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Figure 8A). In multivariable analysis, joint pain

248

(OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.39-5.99), myalgias (OR 2.71, 95% CI 1.51-4.84), chills (OR 2.4, 1.16-4.99),

249

and fatigue (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.01-2.81) were associated with significantly greater odds of

250

oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection (Figure 8B). In contrast, there was no statistically

251

significant association between presence or absence of upper respiratory symptoms (e.g., runny

252

nose, shortness of breath, sore throat, anosmia) and odds of oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA

253

detection.

254

Discussion

255

In this study, we leveraged a comprehensive and detailed dataset among outpatients with

256

uncomplicated COVID-19 enrolled in a Phase 2 clinical trial to carefully define symptom

259

Inflammatory symptoms (myalgias, chills, fatigue) were most prevalent and peaked early; these

260

symptoms were also associated with ongoing viral replication. In contrast, objective fever and

261

respiratory symptoms were less common, and not associated with viral replication. Though

267

Importantly, though the most prevalent symptoms observed were consistent with previous

268

reports,(3, 4, 6, 11, 12) we observed different prevalence peaks per symptom. The most common

269

initial symptoms were headache, myalgias and chills; these symptoms peaked at 4 days post

270

symptom onset. Shortness of breath and cough peaked at 6 and 9 days, respectively. These data

271

differ from a prediction model which suggested that cough would precede headache and

272

myalgias.(13) Anosmia was common and is likely specific for COVID-19(14), but was most

273

prominent one week post symptom onset. Thus, patients may be shedding infectious virus for up

274

to one week prior to the onset of “typical” COVID-19 symptoms such as cough, shortness of

275

breath, and anosmia.

276
277

Only 3 participants had fever >100.4° F at enrollment, and 6 had fever at any timepoint during

278

follow-up, consistent with other studies which show relative lack of fever in mild/moderate cases

week after enrollment, after which temperatures remained stable at a mean temperature of

281

97.6°F. These observations are consistent with recent reports suggesting that “normal” body

282

temperatures are well below the established “normal” of 98.6°F,(15, 16) and suggest that

283

temperatures above 97.6°F may represent clinically significant physiologic changes within the

284

context of uncomplicated COVID-19.

285
286

LatinX participants were significantly more likely to have symptoms resolve at any point during

287

the study compared to non-LatinX, White participants. This was after controlling for key

288

demographic/clinical characteristics, including age, gender, and BMI. Although it is possible that

289

biologic differences may underlie these differences in symptom resolution, prior reports have

290

suggested that race or ethnic-based differences are not significant predictors of clinically

291

relevant hospitalization outcomes such as mortality, ICU admission, or mechanical

292

ventilation.(17, 18) These differences may be driven by residual confounding, including the

293

possibility of differential symptom recall bias and/or delays in testing/diagnosis prior to

294

enrollment.

295
296

The median time to viral shedding cessation from enrollment was 10 days, consistent with other

297

reports.(19, 20) Though other studies have identified disease severity as a risk factor for longer

298

duration of shedding(20), in this cohort, only SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and oropharyngeal

299

viral loads at enrollment were associated with more rapid viral shedding cessation. The majority

300

of participants reporting symptoms on each day had detectable oropharyngeal virus by PCR,

301

suggesting that ongoing presence of symptoms is an indicator of ongoing viral shedding. This

302

supports CDC guidelines(21) to continue isolating until symptoms are improved, though PCR

303

positivity does not infer infectivity.(22) Myalgia and joint pain were the only symptoms

304

significantly associated with oropharyngeal PCR positivity. These are also some of the earliest

305

symptoms to appear, when viral loads are higher early in disease course and patients are most

306

likely to be infectious. Therefore, screening for respiratory symptoms may miss the most

307

infectious patients, who may attribute their symptoms to other causes.

308
309

There were limitations to this study. This cohort was part of a randomized, placebo-controlled

310

trial, where half the cohort received Lambda and the other half received placebo. The duration of

311

symptoms and viral shedding was nearly identical between the two arms in the primary

312

analysis(8), so we included the entire cohort in order to improve statistical power to perform our

313

analyses. Only 4 (3%) participants in this cohort needed hospitalization and 10 (8.3%) went to

314

the ED for evaluation, compared with an incidence of hospitalization of 2.9-11% in other

315

outpatient trials.(7, 23) This is likely related to study selection criteria, and that recruitment

316

occurred during non-surge conditions when even moderately ill patients were being hospitalized.

317

Median participant age was 36 years, and the cohort was predominantly LatinX, reflecting our

318

local population of COVID-19 cases(24); however, our findings may not be generalizable to

319

other settings. Though there was high retention in the study, 34 participants missed two

320

consecutive daily symptom surveys and were excluded from the symptom cluster analysis.

321

Though we collected symptom data daily for 28 days after enrollment, time of symptom onset

322

was reported retrospectively by participants at enrollment and thus subject to recall bias. Finally,

323

this is a secondary analysis of data from a clinical trial that was not designed for these analyses,

324

so this study should be considered hypothesis-generating.

In this cohort of participants with uncomplicated COVID-19, distinct symptom clusters and

327

trajectories were identified and inflammatory symptoms were associated with ongoing viral

328

replication. In contrast,

329

used for screening programs, are not always earliest to present and not associated with viral

330

replication, and may therefore not be ideal for screening approaches. Data from this and other

longitudinal studies will be critical in shaping our understanding of disease pathogenesis in

patients, and for planning large, Phase 3 outpatient studies based on clinical and virologic
