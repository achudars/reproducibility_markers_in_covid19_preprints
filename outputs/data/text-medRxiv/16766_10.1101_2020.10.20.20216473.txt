Abstract: In this article, we formulated a mathematical model for the spread of the
COVID-19 disease and we introduced quarantined and isolated compartments.
The next generation matrix method was adopted to compute the basic reproduction
number   in order to assess the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 deadly
disease. Stability analysis of the disease free equilibrium is investigated based on
the basic reproduction number and the result shows that it is locally and
asymptotically stable for  less than 1. Numerical calculation of the basic
reproduction number revealed that   1 which means that the disease can be
eradicated from Nigeria. The study shows that isolation, quarantine and other
government policies like social distancing and lockdown are the best approaches to
control the pernicious nature of COVID-19 pandemic.
Key words: mathematical model, basic reproduction number, isolation,
quarantine, COVID-19, computer simulation

1. Introduction
Mathematical model and its computer simulations are great tools that can be used
to control and predict infectious diseases globally. The Covid-19 pandemic which
is popularly known as coronavirus pandemic, a recent pandemic caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SAR-Covid-2). The new virus was named
by International committee on Taxonomy of viruses (ICTV) as ‚ÄúSARS-Covid-2‚Äù

because it

is generally related to the coronavirus responsible for the SARS

outbreak of 2003 [4,5]. The recent pandemic was first identified in December 2019
in Wuhan China and it was declared to be a Public Health Emergency of
International concern.
On 30 January, 2020 and as pandemic on 11 March 2020 [4]. As of 19 September
2020, the disease was confirmed in more than 30.3 million cases reported globally
in 188 countries and territories with over 949,000 deaths and over 206 million have
fully recovered globally [10].
The pandemic was first confirmed and announced in Nigeria on 27 February, 2020,
when an Italian citizen in Lagos tested positive for the virus and the second case
was reported on 9 March, 2020 in Ewekoro, Ogun State when a Nigerian citizen
had contact with the Italian citizen [1,3,6].
Recently, the spread of covid-19 in Nigeria increases continually as the latest
record provided by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control declares Nigeria to
reveal a total of 56,956 confirmed cases [2]. On 18 September 2020, Nigeria
recorded 221 new confirmed cases and 1 death out of a total of daily test of 2,609
samples carried out across the country, the 221 new cases reported from 18 state ‚Äì

The Covid-19 outbreak is seen as the greatest global threat worldwide because it
spreads globally and millions of confirmed cases, accompanied by thousands
deaths globally. As of 14 September 2020, WHO reports 28,637,952 confirmed
cumulative cases with 917,417 deaths in the world and 18 September 2020, total of
56,956 confirmed cases, total of 48,305 discharged and total deaths of 1,094
occurred in Nigeria [9].
Covid-19 is spread primarily from human to human through direct or indirect close
proximity with contaminated surface, objects or with secretion droplets, saliva or
respiratory secretions expelled from mouth or nose of an infected individual
coughs, sings, sneezes or speaks.
The sign and symptoms of Covid-19 usually start two to 14 days after contact with
infected person or contaminated surface, this period of time after exposure and
before having symptoms is known as incubation period. Common sign and

symptoms of Covid-19 include, cough, fever, tiredness, shortness of breath, sore
throat etc. Older people with underlying medical challenges like serious heart
diseases (heart failure, coronary arterial disease or cardionryopatty), cancer, type 2
diabetes, sickle cell disease, high blood pressure[14].
Mathematical modelling and its computer simulation has attracted the attention of
many researchers because of its striking applications in the area of prediction and
control of infectious diseases. Many researchers have proposed mathematical
models for prediction of infectious disease. [15], Proposed Mathematical
Assessment of the transmission dynamics of HIV/AIDs with treatment effects.
Their model comprises of four compartments considering treatment class as the
control measure. [12], proposed a mathematical model for simulating the phasebased transmissibility of a novel Covid-19.
In their study, they developed a Bats-Hosts Reservoir-people transmission network
model for simulating the potential transmission from source of infection to the
human infection. The basic reproduction number from

reserviour to person

analyzed was estimated to be 2.30 and 3.58 from person to person.
Their model revealed that the transmissibility of SARS-COV-2 was higher than
the middle east respiratory syndrome within the Middle East countries. Our main
contribution in this article is addition of new compartments such as quarantine,
isolation andtdeath which are not considered in most existing models, the addition

of these compartments give rise to a number of analysis that can be used to study
COVID-19 transmissibility intensively.
2.0 Mathematical Formulation Of The Model
In this section, we developed a mathematical model on COVID-19 based on some
realistic mathematical assumptions about Covid-19. The total population is
subdivided into seven compartments, namely susceptible  , exposed E(t),
quarantine Q(t), infected  , isolate  , Death



and recovered   let

be the constant recruitment rate to the susceptible population, the rate at which
people become susceptible to the disease and
individuals become exposed to the disease,

the rate which the susceptible

is the rate of infection.

and  are

the rate at which the quarantine individuals because susceptible and susceptible
individuals are removed from the population respectively. The exposed individuals
move to the quarantine class through the rate  and get recovered through the rate
.

The isolated individuals get recovered at the rate  and  is disease induced death
rate. Quarantined individuals get infected at the rate  and infected individual
recovered through the rate  , the natural death is  in every compartment. Figure 1
gives the schematic diagram of the model.
The model is developed under the following mathematical assumptions
The recovered individuals do not become susceptible to the disease again.

Potion of the infected individuals and isolated individuals can die due to
disease.
Every susceptible individual has equal chance of being infected.
New recruit enters the population through birth and migration.
The quarantined individuals can be infected when they come in contact with
contaminated surface or infected person.

Since all the eigen values are negative, we conclude that the system is locally and
asymptotically stable around its disease free equilibrium.

4.6 Numerical Simulation
We perform numerical simulation of the model in order to compare the results of
our model with the real data obtained from published articles by WHO and other
researchers, considering a total of 56,956 confirmed cases in Nigeria. Figures
1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and 8 are very useful to this work and their significance have been
depicted under each of the figures. The numerical simulation of our model is
performed using MATLAB and set of parameter values below:

Fig (2), is the graph of susceptible population against time. We observed that the
susceptible individuals decrease rapidly as time increases showing that few
numbers will be susceptible to the disease and the infection would be eradicated
from Nigeria as time progresses.

Fig(3), is the graph of exposed population against time, from the graph, the
exposed population decreases as time increases, the exposed population
decreases to zero indicating that with time the COVID-19 pandemic can be
controlled in Nigeria since the exposed population tends to zero.

Fig(5), is the graph of quarantined population against time, initially quarantined
population increases rapidly, the initial exponential growth could be as a result of
government intervention measures such as media cover-age on social distancing
and period of lockdown, it later decreases due to decrease in susceptible and
infected population.

Fig (8), is graph of death population against time in Nigeria, the population is at
high rate when the outbreak occurs initially but later decreases with time showing
that disease induced death tends to zero as time progresses.
5. 0 Conclusion
COVID-19 pandemic is the second world disaster after the World War II,
government of Nigeria has taken some policies to control the catastrophic nature of
the deadly disease in their own capacity. In this article, we have developed and
analyzed a mathematical model which incorporates isolation and quarantine
strategies as control measures. Analysis of the model shows that diseases free
equilibrium is locally and asymptotic stable. The numerical simulation and analysis
of the model revealed that COVID-19 pandemic can be eradicated from the
population.
