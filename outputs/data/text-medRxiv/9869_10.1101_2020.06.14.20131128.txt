Abstract:
Post-infectious anosmias typically follow death of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs)
with a months-long recovery phase associated with parosmias. While profound anosmia
is the leading symptom associated with COVID-19 infection, many patients regain
olfactory function within days to weeks without distortions. Here, we demonstrate that
sterile induction of anti-viral type I interferon signaling in the mouse olfactory epithelium
is associated with diminished odor discrimination and reduced odor-evoked local field
potentials. RNA levels of all class I, class II, and TAAR odorant receptors are markedly
reduced in OSNs in a non-cell autonomous manner. We find that people infected with
COVID-19 rate odors with lower intensities and have odor discrimination deficits relative
to people that tested negative for COVID-19. Taken together, we propose that
inflammatory-mediated loss of odorant receptor expression with preserved circuit
integrity accounts for the profound anosmia and rapid recovery of olfactory function
without parosmias caused by COVID-19.

Introduction
Subjective reduction of smell (hyposmia) commonly occurs during upper respiratory
viral infections (URIs) (1, 2), and resolves concomitantly with improvement in rhinorrhea
and nasal congestion symptoms. About 5% of patients experience a post-infectious,
prolonged olfactory disorder that often recovers over 6 – 12 months with odor training
(3). By contrast, a much larger proportion of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2
virus (34 - 65%) self-report anosmia, usually without accompanying rhinorrhea or nasal
congestion (2, 4). Self-report of smell loss is often unreliable (5). Objective smell testing
using the 40-item UPSIT smell identification test revealed 98% with olfactory deficits in
COVID-19 positive hospitalized inpatients in Iran, in spite of only 34% complaining of
loss of smell (6). Similarly, 84% of 60 hospitalized inpatients for COVID-19 infection
were hyposmic or anosmic using the 12-item Sniffin-Sticks odor identification test
whereas only 45% reported subjective loss of smells (7). In contrast, in mostly
ambulatory patients,the 16-item Sniffin-Sticks odor identification revealed 38%
normosmia in COVID positive patients reporting total smell loss (8). In many cases,
olfactory deficits occur before the onset of other symptoms of a COVID-19 disease or
are the only manifestation of the disease (2, 9).
Viral induced rhinorrhea, or ‘runny nose’ is one mechanism that may contribute to
olfactory dysfunction by preventing odorants from reaching odorant receptors (OR).
Infection with SARS-CoV-2, however, is not commonly associated with rhinorrhea or
congestion (2). Viral killing of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), is another mechanism
of olfactory dysfunction, and regeneration of the OSNs from stem cells and reintegration
of newly differentiated neurons into existing circuits is thought to be responsible for the
months-long recovery process. The rate of recovery of olfactory function is another
distinguishing feature of COVID-19 associated anosmia relative to other post-infectious
olfactory deficits. In a recent longitudinal survey, 80% of patients reported subjective
partial or full recovery after 1 week, rather than months as typically described by postviral smell loss patients (10). Together, these distinguishing clinical features (lack of
rhinorrhea or congestion, the broad penetrance of hyposmia, and the rapid recovery of
olfactory function) suggest that COVID-19 infection induces olfactory loss via a
mechanism that is distinct from a neurotoxic effect mediated by other viruses.

Furthermore, the expression of the receptors for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 and TMPRSS2,
on cell-types that are components of the complex cellular composition of the olfactory
epithelium, but not directly on OSNs, also suggests a non-cell autonomous model of
OSN dysfunction (11, 12).
Here, we report that sterile activation of an antiviral signaling cascade in the
murine olfactory epithelium interferes with olfactory function by markedly reducing the
expression of odorant receptors in OSNs non-cell-autonomously. We previously
reported lines of transgenic mice (Nd1 and Nd2) that express genomically encoded
cytoplasmic dsRNA in 1% of the cells in the olfactory epithelium. The cdsRNA triggers a
sterile type I interferon (IFN-I) innate immune response that spreads to neighboring and
connected cells (13). The antiviral innate immune response induces hyposmia and a
dramatic decrease in odorant receptor RNA levels in both the Nd1 and Nd2 that far
exceeds the degree of neuronal loss. Moreover, reversing the IFN-I response by
silencing the expression of genomically encoded dsRNA in adult mice affords recovery
of OR expression. Our data suggest a model where a robust antiviral innate immune
response acts non-cell autonomously to block the expression of functional odorant
receptors, which synergizes with OSN cell death to cause olfactory deficits. Based on
this model we hypothesize that reduced OR expression would lead to reduced
perceived intensity and diminished discriminatory perception in patients infected with
SARS-CoV-2. In an initial test of this hypothesis, we characterized olfactory function in
non-hospitalized patients that tested positive or negative for the COVID infection by
nasopharyngeal RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. We find that non-hospitalized patients with
COVID-19 infection score intensities of odors significantly lower and discriminate
between odors with less acuity relative to patients with negative COVID-19 testing
phenotypes that are consistent with a peripheral mechanism of olfactory dysfunction
(14), and consistent with loss of OR expression. Profound reduction of OR expression
in the setting of robust anti-viral innate immune signaling in the olfactory epithelium may
resolve the paradox of why SARS-CoV-2 robustly impacts smell function even though
OSNs do not express the primary entry receptors for the virus (11, 12); this mechanism
of OSN dysfunction may also explain why the recovery of profound olfactory function

occurs on a short time scale relative to other post-infectious anosmias – days to weeks
as opposed to months.
Results
We generated and characterized the Nd1 and Nd2 mouse models, which express
genomically encoded, cytoplasmic dsRNA (cdsRNA). The source of the genomically
encoded cdsRNA is their respective transgenes, which integrated into the genome with
both intact and inverted copies. The cdsRNA is detected in < 1% of cells in the olfactory
epithelium (Fig. 1A). However, this cdsRNA triggers sterile induction of Type I interferon
(IFN-I) stimulated genes across the entire olfactory epithelium in a non-cell autonomous
fashion. This IFN-I induction mimics a viral infection with an infectivity density of < 1% in
the olfactory epithelium (13); it also affords the opportunity to investigate the effect of
innate immune response separated from any direct toxic effects of the virus. Following
purification by FACS sorting to 97% purity (Fig. 1A), mature OSNs profoundly
expressed interferon response genes relative to sex-matched littermate controls that did
not express the genomically encoded cdsRNA (Fig 1B), (13).
Reduced Olfactory Acuity in Nd1 Mice
To determine whether evoking a robust innate immune response in the olfactory
epithelium leads to olfactory deficits (15), we examined the olfactory acuity of Nd1 mice
using two experimental approaches. First, we employed the Slotnick operant
conditioning paradigm to assess odorant discrimination (16). The task is to distinguish a
1.0% solution of the (+)-citronellol in mineral oil from a racemic mixture of the (+)- and (–
)- citronellol enantiomers in mineral oil whose aggregate concentration was 1.0%. Both
Nd1 (n = 12) and littermate control (n = 11) mice distinguished a 1:1 ratio of the (+)- and
(–)-citronellol enantiomers from 1.0% of the (+)-citronellol enantiomer (Fig. 1C). The
performance for Nd1 mice was, however, significantly worse than the control littermates
(p < 0.05) when the ratio of the (+): (–)-citronellol enantiomers was increased from 3:1
(Fig. 1D) to 19:1 (Fig. 1E) in the racemic mixture.
In a second experimental approach, the mice were exposed to an odorant
isolated from fox feces, 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT), a chemical that

induces innate aversive responses, including freezing. Mice with a disturbance in the
dorsal olfactory bulb do not exhibit a response to TMT (17). Nd1 male mice (n = 4; p <
10-6) exhibited reduced freezing behavior compared to control male littermates (N=4)
when exposed to TMT (Fig. 1F). Together, these data indicate that non-cell
autonomous activation of IFN-I response genes in OSNs results in reduced olfactory
acuity.
Reduced Activity of Olfactory Sensory Neurons in Nd1 Mice
Lower odor-evoked activity in the setting of an active innate immune response may
account for the reduced olfactory acuity in Nd1 mice (18). We assessed of odor-evoked
OSN activity by recording local dendritic field potentials generated by odorant
stimulation from the surface of the olfactory epithelia of Nd1 and control littermates (19).
We stimulated three-month-old Nd1 and control littermates with a 1:200 dilution of a
saturated vapor of amyl acetate, or a 1:200 dilution of a saturated vapor of pentanal.
The local field potentials evoked by either odor were significantly different from the
responses to mineral oil control in both Nd1 and control mice (representative traces
shown in Fig. 2A and 2B). Similarly, the electroolfactogram responses were markedly
different between Nd1 mice (n = 6) and littermate controls (n = 7) for both amyl acetate
and pentanal (mean response = 10.43 mv vs. 4.57 mv; p < 10-100 and mean response =
11.64 mv vs. 5.22 mv; p < 10-105, respectively (Fig. 2C)). Cumulative histogram plots of
the distribution of responses for pentanal (Fig. 2D) and amyl acetate (Fig. 2E) revealed
a left shift for the Nd1 mice, indicating an effect over the entire population of OSNs.
While these results provide evidence of diminished odor-evoked activation in Nd1 mice,
the magnitude of the reduced mean responses for both odors (55 and 56%) was greater
than the reduction of the steady state levels of OSNs (35%) in Nd1 mice (13),
suggesting that an additional mechanism beyond OSN death accounts for the reduced
mean odor evoked responses.
Marked Reduction of Expression of Multiple Classes of Odorant Receptors in
Response to Anti-Viral Signaling

We tested the hypothesis that reduced odorant receptor expression, coincident with the
partial loss of OSNs, could account for the loss of olfactory acuity in Nd1 mice. Although
murine OSNs carry greater than 1000 genes for distinct odorant receptors (OR), each
OSN expresses only a single odorant receptor. We examined members of three
different classes of ORs; class I, class II, and TAAR receptor families (20, 21). We used
RNA in situ hybridization on coronal sections of olfactory epithelia to detect
representative OR members from each class. We found a significant reduction (70-92%,
p >0.0001 for all ORs examined) in the number of OSNs expressing representatives
from all three classes of ORs (Fig. 4A-4D).
We next examined the same three class representative ORs in Nd2, a second
transgenic mouse line with a similarly genomically encoded trigger of robust innate
immune activation (13). We also found a robust reduction in odorant receptors in Nd2
(Fig. S1; 75-98%, p >0.0001 for all ORs examined). Using qPCR we independently
confirm the reduced expression of 32 different ORs from all three classes (Fig. 3E).
Next we performed a metanalysis of RNA-seq data from purified mature OSNs to
determine if OR loss is widespread across OSNs we analyzed the expression of
odorant receptors (13). We detected a significant reduction in the expression of 933
odorant receptors, TAAR receptors, and OR pseudogenes (Fig. 4A). Together these
data show that odorant receptor expression is reduced across most OSNs throughout
the olfactory epithelium in response to sterile innate immune activation.
We explored the consequences of repression of IFN-I signaling by silencing
transgene expression by feeding Nd1 mice doxycline to induce the tetracycline
repressor engineered into this mouse line. Extinguishing the viral-mimetic expression in
OSNs for 2 months in young adult mice reduced the number of cleaved caspase 3
positive cells in the olfactory epithelium to levels similar to those observed in control
animals (13). Using immunohistochemistry, we found that OSNs expressing the Olfr151
recovered to levels that were not statistically different than control littermates in Nd1
(Fig. 4C) but were significantly different to Nd1 mice that were not fed doxycycline (Fig.
4B and 4C; p < 0.0001). These observations indicate that resolution of anti-viral
inflammatory response in the olfactory epithelium results in resumption of OR

expression, and that the lower gene expression levels of ORs was not due to aberrant
development.
Reduced subjective odor intensity and odor discrimination in COVID-19 infected
patients relative to individuals testing negative for COVID-19.
Based on our mouse studies, we hypothesized that COVID-19 infection of respiratory
epithelial and sustentacular cells leads to local innate immune activation (11, 12), even
in the absence of constitutional symptoms to reduce OR expression in OSNs. To test
this hypothesis in humans, we repurposed our olfactory battery developed for early
diagnosis of cognitive impairment (22) into a smell test for probing olfactory function in
people with a possible or definite exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus. Reviewing our data
collected on control participants from ages 20 - 89, we selected the three complex odor
mixtures with the highest percentage of accurate responses on the odor percept
identification test (80%, 85%, and 90%, respectively). The COVID smell test battery
consists of three sequential tests: 1) rate the intensity of each odor, where participants
describe the potency of a particular smell; 2) odor percept identification, where
participants select from four choices the name that best describes the odor they
remember smelling; and 3) discrimination, where the participant smells three odors
consecutively and then selects which one of the three odors is different. We presented
odors as peel and sniff labels arrayed on a card and recorded responses on web-based
app (Fig. 5A).
Patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR tests
(n = 40) and patients with one or more negative SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR test results (n
=25) were recruited to take the COVID Smell Test. Consistent with previous reports of
symptoms, subjective complaints of smell loss were greater in the COVID-19 patients,
but the distribution of age, sex, time between the RT-PCR assay and smell test were
not statistically different between the two cohorts (Table S1). COVID-19 patients
demonstrated reduced subjective intensity ratings for all three odors (Fig. 5B),
discriminated two of three odor combinations significantly worse – with a trend in the
third combination - compared to patients with negative SARS-CoV-2 test results (Fig.
5C). By contrast, only one of the three items of the odor percept identification test was

significantly different between these two groups with a trend in another odor (Fig. 5D).
Together, the reduced intensities and difficulty with discriminating 3 different presented
odors is consistent with a peripheral mechanism of olfactory dysfunction (23).
Another distinguishing feature of anosmia in the setting of COVID-19 is the
recovery of smell function within days to weeks (10) – as opposed to months (3)- in
many patients without distortions (parosmias). These differences are illustrated in a
case of a 60 year old female with no significant previous health history who developed
an upper respiratory illness with nasal congestion for 2 weeks and was left with a
persistent anosmia for 8 months (from 4/2019 until late 12/2019). Her initial recovery of
smell function was notable for identical odor-evoked percepts - independent of the
nature of the odor - that was distorted and unpleasant. Over the next 3 months, her
smell function improved about 75% of her subjective baseline – distinguishing between
different red wines – when she suddenly lost her sense of smell in mid-March 2020
without nasal congestion. Her other two family members became ill with an upper
respiratory illness, and her daughter also lost her sense of smell transiently. This
second bout of anosmia was preceded by hosting a visitor from Spain. However, her
sense of smell began to recover in 3 days and was not associated with distortions –
described as faint, accurate perceptions and within 4 weeks she had regained more
subjective smell function than she had experienced before the second bout of anosmia.
This case vividly illustrates differences between post-infectious anosmia that is thought
to be caused by a neurotoxicity of OSNs – her 2019 bout of anosmia – where recovery
of smell function requires the regeneration of OSNs from stem cells, and reintegration of
nascent OSNs into existing neural circuits. Transient parosmias may represent the
transition from the initial synaptic connections to refined integration mediated by
synaptic plasticity. In her 2020 bout of anosmia, which was equally profound, the
olfactory neural circuit appears to be rendered transiently dormant.
Discussion
In this study we show that non-cell autonomous induction of a sterile innate immune
response across the murine olfactory epithelium reduced olfactory acuity, reduced odorevoked potentials, and dramatically reduced levels of odorant receptor RNA and protein

in olfactory sensory neurons (Fig. 6). We previously demonstrated a 35% loss of OSNs
in these mouse lines (13). Both surgical and genetic studies demonstrated that 5% of
the baseline OSN population is sufficient for nearly normal smell function (24, 25).
Therefore, we posit that a combination of death of a subset of the OSN population and
the repression of odorant receptor transcription and protein expression cause the
olfactory deficits in the Nd1 mouse line.
We postulate that the profound and common olfactory deficits in the setting of
COVID-19 infection may operate via a similar non-cell autonomous innate immune
mediated mechanism of OSN dysfunction. As a positive strand RNA virus, the
replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2 will include cytoplasmic dsRNA intermediates (26),
which are pathogen associated molecular patterns that can elicit a robust innate
immune response. Two percent or more sustentacular cells in the olfactory epithelium,
but not OSNs, express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 entry receptors necessary for robust
infection by SARS-CoV-2 (11, 12) (Fig. 6). Based on observations in our Nd1 and Nd2
mouse models, viral infection of less than 1% of cells in the epithelium is sufficient to
activate innate immune signaling in nearly all OSNs across the olfactory epithelium. We
hypothesize that IFNs, or other cytokines that are secreted by infected sustentacular
cells can activate an antiviral response within OSNs and suppress OR expression. This
model is consistent with previous work that demonstrated selective expression of
interferon-gamma exclusively in sustentacular cells can induce anosmia without
damage to the neuroepithelia (27). In addition, cultured OSNs from mice intranasally
inoculated with Sendai virus, a respiratory virus, which triggers a robust type I interferon
response (28), are less responsive to odorant mixtures (18), but the expression patterns
of ORs in OSNs were not formally evaluated.
While our data and the data from these previous studies demonstrate that
interferon signaling correlates with OSN dysfunction, the precise nature of the innate
immune response elicited by COVID-19 in the olfactory epithelium remains to be
determined. A hyperactive innate immune response triggered by SARS-CoV-2 is
hypothesized to mediate the respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19 (29, 30).
However, recent studies indicated that respiratory cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 might
elicit a weaker Type I interferon response relative to the chemokine response (31, 32).

Two recent studies indicate that the presence of smell loss is associated with reduced
risk of developing moderate to severe clinical stages of COVID-19 infection (33). The
magnitude of the interferon response in each individual might account for inverse
correlation between the smell loss and severe respiratory illness. Additionally, we also
cannot rule out release of dsRNA into the extracellular milieu, which could trigger TLR3
signaling leading to olfactory dysfunction (34).
The mechanism by which increased interferon signaling disrupts OR expression
remains to be fully defined. The choice OR allelic selection begins in immature OSNs
(which do not express the cdsRNA in Nd1 and Nd2 mice), and immature neurons
robustly express interferon response genes (13). The finding that OSNs in Nd1 and Nd2
express cdsRNA in mature OSNs does not preclude IFN-I signaling originating in other
cells types from silencing OR expression in a non-cell-autonomous way (Fig. 6). The
translation of a functional OR triggers the phosphorylation of EIF2A (Eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 2A) by PERK (protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic
reticulum kinase) (35). Activation of the dsRNA sensor PKR (protein kinase RNA
activated) phosphorylates the same serine 51 residue on EIF2A as PERK (36).
Activation of PKR requires dimerization, which occurs by increasing its local
concentration of PKR on dsRNA templates or by increased expression via IFN-I
signaling (37), and we have previously observed increased PKR levels in OSNs in Nd1
mice (13). We speculate that increased IFN-I activity could trigger the premature
phosphorylation of EIF2A leading to silencing of all OR transcription prior to the
production of a functional OR. Second, lysine methyltransferases are interferon
response genes, which place three methyl groups on Lysine-9 of Histone 3 to produce
H3K9me3, a marker for transcriptionally silent olfactory receptors (38, 39) (40).
Therefore, an alternate, but not mutually exclusive hypothesis, is that IFN-I induction
might lead to premature formation of H3K9me3 at OR loci prior to the selection of a
functional OR.
Lastly, the nuclear organization of OR loci into specific domains within OSNs is
an important feature for the selection of a single OR gene, while silencing all other ORs
(41). The IFN-I antiviral response requires a dramatic change in the expression of
genes across the entire genome (cite PMID 18614013; PDF 1198). For example, 10%

(>1000 transcripts) of detectable transcripts are differentially expressed in Nd1 relative
to controls (3). Therefore, the nuclear architecture required for the induction of IFN-I
induced genes (42) may not be compatible with OR expression. Future studies will
investigate these mechanisms in our mouse model and characterize the expression of
human OR genes in human olfactory epithelium from patients with documented COVID19 infection and objective smell dysfunction. If this model is confirmed in human
olfactory epithelia of patients with COVID-19 infection, then Nd1 and Nd2 transgenic
mice provide a model to characterize the efficacy of therapies to reduce innate immuneinduced toxicity in the olfactory epithelium that is separate from direct toxicity mediated
by pathogenic viruses.
In COVID-19 infected patients, the olfactory phenotypes of diminished perceived
intensity and diminished discrimination in the participants with documented COVID-19
infection are consistent with peripheral olfactory deficit (23), such as downregulation of
ORs, as seen in the Nd1 mouse, or disturbed extracellular milieu due to sustentacular
cell dysfunction (11). The weaker association of odor percept identification responses to
COVID-19 status relative to the discrimination deficit is distinct from patients with
Alzheimer’s disease (22, 43) and or Parkinson’s disease (44), where olfactory
dysfunction is likely a central (brain) disorder. Recent reports using highly validated
smell identification batteries (6, 7) demonstrated deficits in hospitalized COVID+
patients, but they did not access subjective intensity or discrimination. Some differences
in our study that may account for the weaker association between smell identification
and COVID status include a smaller sample size (6, 7) and 3 items in our battery
relative to 16 and 40 items in the Sniffin’ Sticks and UPSIT batteries, respectively,
different intensities of the odors, the composition of the odors presented, nonhospitalized patients in our study . Another key differences between our identification
battery and the other batteries include that participants see the choices of name before
smelling the odor vs. after smelling the odor in our odor percept identification test. .
Anosmia in COVID-19 has been reported to recover within two weeks after other
symptoms dissipate, which is too rapid for regeneration and differentiation of OSNs
followed by axon extension and reintegration into the olfactory bulb circuits in humans
(45, 46). In addition, the absence of parosmias in the course of recovery suggests that

peripheral olfactory neural circuit remains intact and is rendered dormant in many cases
of COVID-19 infection. We postulate that resolution of the innate immune signaling
evoked by the SARS-CoV-2 could restore expression of olfactory receptors in dormant
OSNs and restore the physiologic milieu around OSNs to a physiologic state to afford
recovery of smell function that is weaker but not distorted. If the olfactory neural circuit
remains intact, then the input into the olfactory bulb can be processed equivalently by
central neural circuits in the pre-infectious state. Future work will characterize the utility
of objective smell testing combined with symptom tracking and contact tracing to detect
COVID-19 infection in asymptomatic individuals and to characterize the temporal
correlation of return of olfactory function documented by longitudinal testing with the
emergence of markers of immunity to COVID-19.
In summary, we propose a model where inflammatory-mediated loss of odorant
receptor expression with preserved circuit integrity contributes to the profound anosmia
and rapid recovery of olfactory function without parosmias caused by COVID-19. If this
model withstands further investigation, self-administered, objective smell testing may
serve as a biomarker for the inflammatory status in the olfactory epithelium evoked by
viral infections, including COVID-19 and other coronaviridae.

Materials and Methods
Animals. All mouse work was in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Massachusetts General Hospital. All
transgenic mouse lines have been previously described (5, 24). Doxycycline was
administered at 40 mg/g in food (Bioserve).

Humans. All human research was in accordance with the Institution Review Board (IRB)
at Mass General Brigham. Patients presenting to the Respiratory Illness Clinics for
evaluation at MGH and BWH, patients in an isolation hotel in Revere, MA who were
recently hospitalized for COVID-19 but could not return home, and healthcare workers
at MGH and BWH were recruited with flyers in English and Spanish.

Mouse Behavior. The enantiomeric discrimination assays were based on the Slotnick
paradigm (16). All odorant enantiomers were the highest grade available (SigmaAldrich) and diluted in light mineral oil. Nd1 (3 – 9 month old (n = 12) and littermate
controls (n = 13) were water restricted (approximately 1 – 1.5 mL per day) for 7 days
prior to training as well as during the training and testing. Body weights were followed to
ensure that they did not fall below 85% of their baseline weight. Training and testing
were performed on an 8-channel liquid dilution olfactometer (Knosys, Lutz, FL). Mice
were first trained to lick from the sampling tube, with increasing durations between odor
presentation and water reward. The program was repeated until each mouse could
complete 200 trials; learning was assessed by a decrease in number of “incorrect” licks
and a constant number of “correct” licks. A successful training or testing session
consisted of a performance index (the ratio of “correct” licks minus “incorrect” licks over
the total licks) to be greater than 0.25. After successful completion of the initial training

program, mice were trained to discriminate 2% ethyl acetate in light mineral oil and air.
Then the last training session required mice to discriminate 2% ethyl acetate in light
mineral oil and 0.1% ß-citronellol in light mineral oil. For testing, the following odor pairs
were presented sequentially: 1:1 ratio (0.1% (+)-ß-citronellol vs. a mixture of
enantiomers (0.05%(–)- / 0.05%(+)- ß-citronellol in light mineral oil for ORCA and (1.0 %
(+)-ß-citronellol vs. a mixture of enantiomers (0.5%(–)- / 0.5%(+)- ß-citronellol in light
mineral oil for ND1); 1:3 ratio (0.1%(+) ß-citronellol vs. 0.075%(+)/0.025%(–) ßcitronellol for ORCA and 1%(+) ß-citronellol vs. 0.75%(+)/0.25%(–) ß-citronellol for ND1;
and 1:19 ratio (0.1%(+) ß-citronellol vs. 0.095%(+)/0.005%(–) ß-citronellol for ORCA
and 1%(+) ß-citronellol vs. 0.95%(+)/0.05%(–) ß-citronellol for ND1. The performance
index was calculated from the raw data, and each block was analyzed using an
unpaired t-test.

The TMT assay was derived from the curtain assay (2). Briefly, approximately 2 month
old male ND1 (n = 4) and littermate control (n= 4) mice were habituated individually to a
clean mouse cage separated by a parafilm curtain partition that divides the arena into
two compartments – one twice as large as the other – for 10 min. This habituation was
repeated immediately in a distinct clean cage with the same partition. Then the mice
were placed into a new clean cage with the same partition in a chemical hood, and the
subsequent 10-minute interval was recorded. After 7 minutes, two pieces of filter paper
were taped to opposing walls of the cage. The paper in small compartment had
absorbed 20 µL TMT (Contech), and the filter paper in the large compartment had
adsorbed 20 µL water. The video was analyzed for freezing, and the observer was
blinded to the genotype. These data are analyzed using a single factor ANOVA (% of
time freezing as a function of genotype).

Electroolfactogram. Local field potentials (EOGs) were recorded from the surface of
intact olfactory sensory epithelia as described previously (19). Amyl acetate and
pentanal were applied at 1:200 of saturated vapor (1:100 dilution in mineral oil and 1:2
dilution in the air stream).

Immunohistochemistry and in situ Hybridization. Immunohistochemistry was performed
as previously described (5). guinea pig anti-Olfr151 (1:1000). RNA in situ hybridization
was performed on 20µm thin sections of frozen olfactory epithelia as previously
described (1). PCR was used to amplify OR sequences from oligo-dT primed cDNA
libraries made from whole olfactory epithelia, cloned into vectors, and transcribed into
Digoxigenin labeled probes as previously described (47).

qPCR. We used the iQ Sybr Green Supermix (catalog # 170-8880, Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA) to perform qPCR in technical triplicates on an iCycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with
a tm =60 degrees. At least 2-4 biological replicates were performed. Q-PCR primers
were designed using PrimerBank (8), TAARS as in used in (48), and were only used for
analysis if they had an efficiency of at least 90%.

Human olfactory testing: Participants were given a uniquely numbered smell card (Fig.
5A) and instructed to visit the website (www.covidsmelltest.com), which described the
study in English or Spanish with the option of watching an introductory video in English
and in Spanish. It then linked participants to the e-consent framework on REDcap,
available in both English or Spanish, where they entered their name, their birthdate and
their unique smell card number into REDcap. Participants self-administered the COVID
Smell Test using their own phone, tablet, or computer by following instructions to peel
labels on the smell card and sample the odors (Fig. 5). Participants were asked to rate
the intensity of each odor and to undergo tests for odor identification (Test 1) from four
choices and odor discrimination (Test 2) where participants selected the present odor
that differed from the other two odors.
Identifiable information was only accessed by research staff through the REDCap
project and was utilized to access participant medical record number and their
electronic health record to collect relevant medical variables and the timing and results
from the COVID testing and the type of test used. These results were combined with the
ID# on the smell card for analysis by the statistician as deidentified data.

Statistical Analysis. One-way analysis of variance and unpaired t-tests were used, as
appropriate, for the mouse studies. Kruskal-Wallis test, Fisher’s exact T-test, paired and
unpaired t-tests were used to analyze the human olfactory responses. Each statistical
test was performed as described in the methods and figures legends using SAS,
Microsoft Excel, or Apple Numbers.

Fig. 1. Olfactory deficits in Nd1 mice relative to wild type controls. (A) Overview of
experimental design; Cell sorting was used to isolate mature OSNs from progeny of a
cross between mice expressing genomically encoded cdsRNA in ~1% of mature OSNs
and mice expressing the green fluorescent protein reporter in all mature OSNs.
Messenger RNA was isolated and cDNA was prepared and sequenced from these
purified OSNs. (B) Heat map of RNA expression of representative IFN-I induced genes
expressed in mature OSNs (5). (C) A cohort of Nd1 (n = 12) mice and littermate controls
(n = 13) were trained to discriminate 1% (+)-citronellol from a mixture of (+)- and (–)citronellol enantiomers at 1:1, (D) 3:1 and (E) 19:1ratios. The performance index
((correct responses – incorrect responses)/total responses) ±S.E.M. is plotted for each

Fig. 6. Model for non-cell-autonomous innate immune inhibition of odorant
receptor expression. All cells in the olfactory epithelium, including mature OSNs
express pattern-recognition receptors (PRR) that can detect cytoplasmic or endosomal
nucleic acids. For example, the positive RNA single stranded genome of Coronaviruses,
or its double-stranded RNA intermediates, can be detected by PRRs. PRRs then
activate the transcription of interferon (IFNs) cytokines, and other cytokines and
chemokines, which are secreted from infected cells. IFNs then trigger the activation of a
host of genes that define the type I interferon antiviral innate immune response. In Nd1
and Nd2 transgenic mouse lines, ~1% of OSNs activate PRRs, and the other 99%,
including non-neuronal cells respond to secreted IFN. IFN-I then leads to repression of
OR expression. During COVID-19, even though OSNs do not express the main entry
receptors for SARS-CoV-2, they can still detect IFNs, other cytokines and chemokines,
from sustentacular or other neighboring cells, which activate a robust IFN-I response in
OSNs, leading to repression of OR transcription.
