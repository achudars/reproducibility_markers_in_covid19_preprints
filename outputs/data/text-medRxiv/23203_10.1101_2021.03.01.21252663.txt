Abstract
Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread disruptions including to health services. In the early
response to the pandemic many countries restricted population movements and some health services
were suspended or limited. In late 2020 and early 2021 some countries re-imposed restrictions. Health
authorities need to balance the potential harms of additional SARS-CoV-2 transmission due to contacts
associated with health services against the benefits of those services, including fewer new HIV infections
and deaths. This paper examines these trade-offs for select HIV services.
Methods
We used four HIV simulation models (Goals, HIV Synthesis, Optima HIV and EMOD) to estimate the
benefits of continuing HIV services in terms of fewer new HIV infections and deaths. We used three
COVID-19 transmission models (Covasim, Cooper/Smith and a simple contact model) to estimate the
additional deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 transmission among health workers and clients. We examined four
HIV services: voluntary medical male circumcision, HIV diagnostic testing, viral load testing and
programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission. We compared COVID-19 deaths in 2020 and 2021
with HIV deaths occurring now and over the next 50 years discounted to present value. The models
were applied to countries with a range of HIV and COVID-19 epidemics.
Results
Maintaining these HIV services could lead to additional COVID-19 deaths of 0.002 to 0.15 per 10,000
clients. HIV-related deaths averted are estimated to be much larger, 19 - 146 discounted deaths per
10,000 clients.

Discussion
While there is some additional short-term risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission associated with providing HIV
services, the risk of additional COVID-19 deaths is at least 100 times less than the HIV deaths averted by
those services. Ministries of Health need to take into account many factors in deciding when and how to
offer essential health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. This work shows that the benefits of
continuing key HIV services are far larger than the risks of additional SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Introduction
Many health services, including those providing HIV prevention, testing and care, have been restricted
during the COVID-19 pandemic because services have been closed for some periods of time, capacity
has been limited, or people were reluctant to access health services because of the risk of becoming
infected. WHO released guidelines for essential health services that prioritized maintaining services for
antiretroviral therapy (ART) [1]. Data reported to UNAIDS on monthly HIV service provision illustrates
the extent of the problem [2]. These data show severe reductions in diagnostic testing, numbers of
people newly initiating ART, viral load testing, programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV
(PMTCT), services for key populations, voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC), public sector
condom distribution, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The severity of disruption varies by country
and time but was as high as 75% in some cases. Service levels rebounded quickly to pre-COVID-19 levels
for some services (PMTCT, key population services, VMMC, PrEP) in some countries but remained low
through September 2020 for others. As of early 2021 increases in COVID-19 cases have led some
countries to re-impose lock down measures.
For example, consider the situation in Zimbabwe. At the end of March 2020, Zimbabwe released
guidance for several HIV services [3]. For VMMC, all road shows, sports galas and other events were
suspended, traditional/religious circumcision camps were shuttered and VMMC services limited to walkins only. Guidance for HIV testing prioritized self-testing and limited facility-based testing to priority
populations. For PrEP and ART multi-month dispensing was encouraged as well as efforts to limit
crowding by revising visit schedules. Level 5 lockdown measures were re-imposed for 30 days in January
2021. These restrictions include restricted opening hours for essential services, closure for non-essential
services, restrictions on attendance at funerals and weddings, limited public transportation services and
staying at home except for buying food and medicines or transporting sick relatives. Similar restrictions
were imposed in Malawi leading to only 33% of the expected VMMCs and large reductions in PrEP
initiation and use.
Restricting some services makes sense if the benefits of those services are small compared to the
potential harm of additional COVID-19 transmission. If the benefits are large, then there will be
advantages to continuing those services even if it means some additional COVID-19 transmission and
deaths. The purpose of this paper is to examine the benefits and disadvantages of providing HIV services
during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods
We used four HIV simulation models to estimate the HIV-related deaths that would be averted through
delivery of HIV services had they been available and three COVID-19 simulation models to estimate the
additional COVID-related deaths that could happen as a result of keeping the HIV services open. The
COVID models looked at the possibilities of additional transmission from infected patients to health care
workers and vice versa as well as potential transmission during patient travel to and from health clinics
and thereafter within the household and beyond to the general population. COVID-19 and HIV were
compared on the basis of additional COVID-19 deaths caused by continuing HIV services and HIV-related
deaths averted. Since COVID-19 deaths would occur immediately and HIV-related deaths would occur
later, possibly 30 years or more later if patients with new infections receive antiretroviral therapy (ART),
we discounted all HIV-related deaths to the present year using a 3% annual discount rate as
recommended for comparisons of this type [4]. Different models were applied to different countries
with different levels of HIV and COVID-19 epidemics as described below. To ease comparisons across
countries, all results are reported per 10,000 people receiving each HIV service.
The HIV services we examined included: the provision of voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC)
which reduces susceptibility to HIV transmission, HIV diagnostic testing which provides an entryway into
treatment, viral load testing which determines whether ART is successfully controlling HIV, and
programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) which provides HIV testing and
antiretroviral therapy to prevent transmission of HIV from mother to newborn. We did not include
antiretroviral treatment in this analysis since previous work [5] has already shown the enormous
benefits to continuing treatment services and most programs have followed guidelines and prioritized
continuing these services. PrEP was not included because of the slow rollout of PrEP programs to date.
HIV Models
The four HIV simulation models are described below. In each case, the team responsible for developing
the model applied it to one or more countries using the best available data on HIV prevalence, behaviors
and treatment over time.
Goals Model
Goals is a compartmental HIV simulation model developed by Avenir Health [6]. It divides the adult
population by sex and risk behaviors (not sexually active, one sexual partner in the last year, more than
one sexual partner in the last year, female sex workers, male clients of sex workers, men who have sex
with men and injecting drug users). HIV transmission occurs due to contact between an HIV-infected and
HIV-uninfected individual. The probability of transmission is determined by the basic transmissibility of
the virus and the characteristics of the contact, including the direction of transmission (male-to-female
or female-to-male), the type of contact (heterosexual sex, male-male sex, needle sharing), stage of
infection, presence of another sexually transmitted infection in either partner, condom use, male
circumcision, viral suppression through ART, and use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), the number of
contacts per partner and the number of partners per year. Behavior change interventions affect
transmission by changing risk behaviors, such as condom use, number of partners or age at first sex.
People living with HIV are tracked over time by age, CD4 category and ART status. Mortality depends on
age, CD4 count, and ART status. The model was applied to countries with different levels of HIV

prevalence (India 0.22%, Kenya 4.5%, Malawi 8.9%, Nigeria 1.3%, South Africa 19% and Zimbabwe 12.8%
in 2019) and COVID-19 cumulative cases reported per 10,000 population (India 75, Kenya 20, Malawi 4,
Nigeria 4, South Africa 183 and Zimbabwe 10, as of December 2020). The model was used to estimate
the impact of services for VMMC, condom distribution, HIV testing and PMTCT services.

HIV Synthesis
The HIV Synthesis model is an individual-based model of sexual behaviour, transmission and progression
of HIV and the effect of ART in an adult population updating in 3 month time steps. For each model run
we sample from distributions of parameters and generate a range of “setting scenarios” which we
consider reflect the diversity of epidemic and programmatic situations in sub-settings within countries
sub-Saharan Africa, as well as reflecting uncertainty over some parameter values. The effect of opening
three services is modelled: HIV testing, viral load monitoring and ART switching, and VMMC. We assume
that each of these stopped on 1st April 2020. We then consider 5 service resumption policies: (i) all
three services remain unavailable until 1 July 2021; (ii) viral load monitoring and ART switching are
resumed on 1 July 2020, HIV testing and VMMC remain unavailable until 1 July 2021; (iii) HIV testing is
resumed on 1 July 2020; Viral load monitoring and ART switching and VMMC remain unavailable until 1
July 2021; (iv) HIV testing and Viral load monitoring and ART switching are resumed on 1 July 2020,
VMMC remain unavailable until 1 July 2021; (v) all three services are resumed on 1 July 2020. We
assume that people on ART are able to continue taking ART throughout this period (i.e., that this service
is not disrupted), but the suspension of HIV testing impacts on ART initiations. The effect of resuming
HIV testing on numbers of deaths per 10,000 people receiving the service is derived from the difference
between policies (i) and (iii), the effect of resuming viral load monitoring from the difference between
policies (i) and (ii), and the effect of resuming VMMC services from the difference between policies (iv)
and (v).
Optima HIV
The Optima HIV model is a compartmental model with populations disaggregated by sex, age, and risk.
Models for 38 countries (Argentina, Armenia, Belarus, Brazil, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Colombia, Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia
(Former Yugoslav Republic), Malawi, Mexico, Moldova, Mozambique, Nepal, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea,
Peru, Russian Federation, Senegal, South Africa, Sudan, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Uganda,
Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, and Zimbabwe) were used in this analysis. The effect of opening each HIV
service was modelled in countries based on where HIV services were implemented in a comparable
format. This included nine countries in sub-Saharan Africa with coverage disaggregated by VMMC and
traditional circumcision, 19 countries with viral load monitoring coverage disaggregated from ART, and all
38 countries for HIV testing. ART and PMTCT coverage were held constant over the study period to reflect
2020 values for the proportion of people diagnosed with HIV, while coverage of other programs was held
constant based on the latest reported spending.
The same analysis approach described above for the HIV Synthesis model was used. The number of client
visits averted by not re-opening services was based on the assumption that each HIV test, each viral load
test, and each voluntary medical male circumcision consisted of one client visit, giving the deaths averted

independently over 50 years with reopening of each service on 1 July 2020 compared with 1 July 2021. A

(weighted by the number covered by each service for each country) with uncertainty given as the 25th and
75th percentile for individual countries to capture the variation across countries representing local
conditions.
EMOD
EMOD-HIV is a network transmission model of HIV [7] built into the open-source individual-based
modeling framework EMOD [8]. HIV transmission is simulated at the level of each coital act between
sexual partners, who form an age/sex-structured network of relationships of variable duration [9]. The
model was fit to epidemic patterns in South Africa including programmatic data on HIV treatment and
survey estimates of age/sex-specific HIV incidence and prevalence by adjusting parameters related to
sexual risk behavior and engagement in care, as described elsewhere [10-12]. Age/sex-specific risk of
non-HIV deaths were applied to the population based on demographic projections from the United
Nations Population Division, and a competing risk of HIV-associated death was applied to PLHIV on ART
and not on ART. For PLHIV not on ART, risk of HIV-associated death depends on age at time of infection,
with older adults progressing more rapidly toward AIDS and death. For PLHIV on ART, risk of HIVassociated death depends on age, sex, and CD4 count at time of ART initiation and level of ART
adherence, with declining risk of death on ART for adherent patients who remain stable on ART [13]. For
individuals who interrupt and resume ART, risk of death calculated based on CD4 count at time of
interruption and re-engagement in ART [14]. We compared the number of HIV-associated deaths in
model projections with different durations of service disruption, as described above for the HIV
Synthesis model, applied to the services of HIV testing, VMMC, and PMTCT. The number of interventions
delivered was calculated in order to obtain the ratio of the difference in the number of deaths to the
difference in the number of clients served, and the ratio was multiplied by 10,000 in order to obtain the
reported results. Because EMOD-HIV is a stochastic model, simulations were run 250 times and 95%
uncertainty intervals were reported, with the constraint that delivery of the services could not increase
the number of HIV-associated deaths due to stochastic effects.
COVID-19 Models
Three COVID-19 simulation models were applied to estimate the potential COVID-related deaths that
could occur due to transmission related to HIV services.
Contact Model
We developed a simple contact model of COVID-19 transmission based on an approach developed by
Abbas et al. to examine the risks related to childhood immunization. [15] We estimate potential new
infections among health care workers, clients and the general public. New infections among health care
workers IHW are estimated as:

IHW= (1-(1-p x (1-e))w) x R0
Where p is the prevalence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in the population, e is the effectiveness of personal
protective equipment used by health care workers (set at 90%), w is the number of health care workers
that have contact with each client and R0 is the average number of people who will contract an infection
from one infected person (which accounts for onwards transmission from the health care worker).
Client infections at health care settings are estimated as:
Ic = (1-(1-p’ x (1-e))w) x R0
where p’ is the prevalence of infections SARS-CoV-2 in health care workers. This is assumed to be lower
than the general population due to the use of personal protective equipment.
For client contact with the general public during travel to and from, and while awaiting, services the
probability of infections is estimated as:
It = (1-(1-p x r)n) x R0
where r is the probability of infection given contact with an infectious person during travel or in the
waiting area and n is the number of contacts during travel to and from the clinic or in the clinic waiting
area.
The population prevalence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 is estimated as the average reported number of
daily new cases of COVID-19 multiplied by the average duration of the infectious period (in days) divided
by the adult population size. While new daily cases are likely to be under-reported [16] leading to an
under-estimate of new COVID-19 cases, we also calculate the COVID-19 mortality rate from the reported
COVID-19 cases and deaths so that the two measures will be consistent.
The number of deaths due to COVID-19 is estimated as the number of new infections multiplied by the
mortality rate and adjusted for the age. The majority of COVID-19 deaths occur to people over the age
of 65. Health care workers and clients are likely to be much younger. We adjust the population mortality
rate downward to account for these age effects. In the United States the age group 35-44 accounts for
1.8% of all COVID-19 [17] deaths and 16.4% of COVID-19 cases [18], so the population mortality is
multiplied by 0.11 to account for the age effects.
Cooper/Smith COVID Model
We developed a deterministic, compartmental, age-structured transmission model for COVID-19 down
to the sub-district level in Malawi beginning on April 1st for one year. The model has a SEIR structure and
estimates infections, hospitalization need, intensive care need, and deaths and includes daily estimates
of cloth mask utilization and physical distancing. We adjust the risk of severe disease resulting in
hospitalization, intensive care, and death according to age using age-specific rates from the literature.
Finally, community spread of COVID-19 did not begin on the same date in each sub-district. In lieu of
sufficiently granular testing data, we estimate each sub-district’s epidemic start date by leveraging
estimates of connectedness between sub-districts from mobile phone data. These daily estimates of

connectedness act as a likelihood of transmission based on the pool of susceptibles and infectious
individuals in source and sink sub-districts, respectively.
Surveillance of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths are highly limited in Malawi, with one of the
lowest testing rates in the world and very limited death registration. We triangulate limited
seroprevalence estimates in Malawi, with seroprevalence estimates from other settings including South
Africa in combination with their respective test rates. We estimate that actual infections of COVID-19 in
Malawi may be undercounted by 500-times, while COVID deaths are undercounted by approximately
12-times. We adjusted model parameters (within sensible range of literature review estimates) including
R0, generation time, and hospitalization risk to align the projection with the calibrated trajectory of
infections and deaths.
Over one year, we estimate approximately 3,500,000 COVID-19 infections and 6,600 deaths among
adults. We then estimate what proportion of infections and deaths are attributable to HIV service
delivery as those services are a proportion of total close contacts with similar transmission probability.
We estimate under a range of HIV service delivery scenarios that those services contribute
approximately 1.2%-2.5% of total contacts – and therefore that same proportion of infections and
deaths. We express these COVID-19 infections and deaths as a rate per 10,000 HIV clients, and break
results down by service type.

Covasim
Covasim is an agent-based, age-and sex-structured SEIR model for COVID-19 transmission. A model for
KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa was informed using estimates for household size distribution and contact
network matrices (for home, school, workplace, and the community by 5-year age bands) and was
calibrated to daily numbers of COVID-19 cases, deaths and tests using changes in viral transmission to
reflect implementation of different COVID-19 policies over time. The model was also informed by global
COVID-19 disease parameter estimates as described by Kerr et [19]. To simulate conditions used in the
Contact model described above, contact with two (HIV, viral load testing) or three (VMMC, PMTCT)
healthcare workers were specified and the probability of transmission per contact with an infectious
member in the community was set to 6%. Transmission was simulated for 1-year from 1 March 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths as a result of VMMC, HIV testing, viral load testing, or
PMTCT service-related exposure were estimated and expressed per 10,000 HIV clients. A ratio of COVID19 mortality for those aged 35-44 years to the total population of 0.11 was assumed following the
Contact model approach.
Results
Our simulations estimate that the additional COVID-19 deaths per 10,000 in-person HIV service clients
ranges from 0.002 to 0.155 while the additional HIV-related deaths averted by keeping those services
open range from 19 to 146. The average ratio of discounted HIV-related deaths to COVID-19 deaths
ranges from 140 for HIV testing to 740 for VMMC services. Table 1 shows the detailed results by model
and service.

Discussion
Our results clearly show that the potential increase in HIV transmission and subsequent death that
would be associated with curtailing HIV services during the COVID-19 pandemic are many times larger
than the expected COVID-19 deaths due to transmission during visits to access HIV services. COVID-19
deaths would have to be at least 1000 times higher than we estimated to result in an equivalent number
of deaths.
As indicated by the ranges for the HIV outcomes in Table 1 these results are robust to uncertainties in
model estimates. However, the results are sensitive to assumptions regarding the annual discount rate
and the time from HIV-infection until HIV-related death. Without ART the median survival with HIV is
about 11 years. With a 3% discounting rate, an additional death that occurs in 2031 (consistent with the
11-year median HIV survival time in the absence of treatment) would be discounted by a factor of 1.4
while an additional death that is postponed to 2050 due to treatment would be discounted by a factor
of 2.5. A somewhat higher discount rate may be appropriate for many developing countries.[20]
However, the discount rate would need to be as high as 18% to bring the discounted HIV down to the
level of the COVID-19 deaths.
This result derives mostly from the differential mortality rates of the two diseases. HIV generally leads to
death although a person with drug sensitive virus who takes their regimen every day is unlikely to die
from HIV, even after 30 or 40 years [21]. If HIV is controlled long enough, a person living with HIV may
die from some other cause before dying of HIV. In comparison, COVID-19 is rarely fatal. By the end of
2020 85 million cases and 1.8 million deaths had been reported globally, implying a mortality rate of
about 2%. Although deaths are certainly under reported, the number of cases have an even larger under
count. Most COVID-19 deaths are in older populations and in those with comorbidities. The mortality of
people in their 30s and 40s may be about 0.2%. Of course, both COVID-19 and HIV also produce

disabilities, besides. Only HIV-associated disabilities were considered in this study. Long-term disabilities
among survivors of COVID-19 are not yet well-characterized due to the novelty of the virus [22]
The results presented here come from seven different models applied to different sets of countries and
settings. The variation in the results largely reflect those differences. There are also differences in model
structure relating to how age and risk behaviors are handled that affect the results. The modeling teams
often made different assumptions about how to interpret available data and which dynamics were
important to model explicitly. The models agree surprisingly well on some results and vary by an order
of magnitude on others, which we hope to explore further in future collaborations. But the variation in
estimates across models is quite small compared to the differences in estimated COVID-19-related and
HIV-related mortality.
The contact model does not account for potential immunity to SARS-CoV-2 that may have accrued
among health care workers and patients prior to potential exposures related to HIV service delivery.
Thus, this model is expected to produce much higher COVID-19 risk than one that accounts for accrual
of immunity, and therefore should be interpreted as an upper bound to COVID-19 risk. However, this
upper bound is worth considering given uncertainties about the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2
infections in these settings, the duration and effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 immunity in these settings,
and the potential for new variants of SARS-CoV-2 to evade immune responses.
There are limitations to this analysis. COVID-19 is a new disease, so models are also new and relatively
untested in projecting into the future. We have modelled HIV services in isolation but they are
imbedded within a larger health system and effects of shortages of health personnel to deal with COVID19 hospitalizations, testing and vaccination campaigns may also affect HIV services. Decision to continue
a specific HIV service, such as testing, may be determined more by decisions about how to provide all
types of health services rather than just those related to HIV. Disruptions to supply chains may also
affect the delivery of health services.
Most programs have taken steps to ensure that essential HIV services such as ART re-supply can
continue. Often this involves multi-month scripting to reduce the number of visits required for patients
doing well on ART. Countries have learned from past epidemics, such as Ebola, how to maintain
essential services under extraordinary circumstances. [23]
Many health systems are under great strain trying to cope with the surge of hospitalizations due to
COVID-19 and meanwhile maintain other essential health services, but many are finding ways to
continue these important services in spite of the obstacles. These efforts are important not only for
averting new HIV infections but also for averting other infectious diseases through continued childhood
immunization, avoiding unintended pregnancies by continuing family planning services, avoiding
increased TB transmission by continuing diagnoses and treatment programs, and for many other health
challenges as well. Our efforts should focus on how to maintain these services so that we do not lose the
benefits of the progress in HIV that has been made in recent years.
