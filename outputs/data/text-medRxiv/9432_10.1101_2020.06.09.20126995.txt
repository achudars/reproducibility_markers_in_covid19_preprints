Abstract

18

Objective: Current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a heavy

19

burden on the mental and physical health of patients, regional healthcare resources, and global

20

economic activity. Many patients with lung cancer are thought to be affected by this situation.

21

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on lung cancer treatment

22

scheduling.

23
24

Study design: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of lung cancer patients who were

25

undergoing anti-cancer treatment at the National Hospital Organization Kyoto Medical Center (600

26

beds) in Kyoto, Japan, between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020.

27
28

Methods: After the medical records were reviewed, the patients were assigned to one of two groups,

29

depending on whether their lung cancer treatment schedule was delayed. We assessed the

30

characteristics, types of histopathology and treatment, and the reason for the delay.

31
32

Results: A total 15 (9.1%) patients experienced the delay of lung cancer treatment during COVID-19

33

pandemic. Patients with treatment delay received significantly more ICIs monotherapy than patients

34

without treatment delay (p=0.0057). On the contrary, no patients receiving molecular target agents

35

experienced treatment delay during COVID-19 pandemic period (p=0.0027). The treatments of most

of the patients were delayed per their request.

Conclusion: We revealed 9.1% lung cancer patients suffered anxiety and requested treatment delay

39

during COVID-19 pandemic. Oncologists should keep in mind that patient with cancer have more

40

anxiety than we expected under special occasions such as COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction

43
44

By the end of May 2020, coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute

45

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was reported to have affected more than

46

6,000,000 people globally (1, 2). COVID-19 is known to place a heavy burden on the mental and

47

physical health of patients, regional healthcare resources, and global economic activity. In Japan, the

48

government officially declared a state of emergency on April 7, 2020 (3). Daily coverage of the

49

COVID-19 pandemic has been negatively affecting the mental health of patients. Considering that

50

patients with cancer may suffer worse respiratory outcomes than those without (4, 5), this pandemic

51

is presumed to affect the daily routines of cancer patients and oncologists. Therefore, in this study,

52

we aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on lung cancer treatment scheduling.

53
54

Patients and methods

55
56

The period of the COVID-19 pandemic has been defined as the time between March 1, 2020 and

57

May 31, 2020. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of lung cancer patients who were

58

undergoing anti-cancer treatment at the National Hospital Organization Kyoto Medical Center (600

59

beds) in Kyoto, Japan, between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020. The reviewing criteria were as

60

follows: (A) pathologically confirmed lung cancer patients; (B) patients who received treatment with

61

cytotoxic chemotherapy ± immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), ICI monotherapy, or molecular

62

target agents; and (C) patients who received treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic period. After

63

the medical records were reviewed, the patients were assigned to one of two groups, depending on

64

whether their lung cancer treatment schedule was delayed. We assessed the characteristics, types of

65

histopathology and treatment, and the reason for the delay.

66

The medical records of 165 patients who met the inclusion criteria were reviewed. The

67

characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 1. The patients were predominantly male

68

(mean age: 70.2 ± 9.2 years). Regarding lung cancer type, the highest proportion of patients had

69

adenocarcinoma, followed by squamous cell carcinoma, small-cell lung cancer, and a type that was

70

not otherwise specified. Of the 165 patients, 133 (80.6%) received their treatment at the outpatient

71

clinic; 33 (20.0%), 76 (46.1%), and 56 (33.9%) patients had received cytotoxic chemotherapy ± ICIs,

72

ICI monotherapy, and molecular target agents, respectively. This retrospective study was approved

73

by the relevant institutional review board (approval number: 20-022).

74
75

Statistical analyses

76
77

A chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test was applied to compare the categorical variables. Alternatively,

78

the Mann-Whitney U-test was applied for the continuous variables. The condition for statistical

79

significance was defined as a p value below 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS

Results

83
84

We reviewed the medical records of 165 patients who had undergone lung cancer treatment during

85

the study period. The lung cancer treatments of a total of 15 patients (9.1%) were delayed during the

86

COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with delayed treatment received significantly more ICI monotherapy

87

than patients without delayed treatment (p = 0.0057). By contrast, no patients who received

88

molecular target agents experienced a treatment delay during the COVID-19 pandemic period (p =

89

0.0027). Figure 1 shows the proportion of patients whose treatment was delayed according to the

90

type of treatment. Of the 76 patients who received ICI monotherapy, 12 patients (15.8%) experienced

91

treatment delay. However, the treatments of most of the patients were delayed per their request.

92

Alternatively, the doctors of two patients recommended delayed treatment, and one patient was

93

advised by their family to delay treatment.

Discussion

96
97

Here, we revealed that the lung cancer treatment schedules of 9.1% of lung cancer patients were

98

altered during the COVID-19 pandemic. In most cases, treatment delay was requested by the patient,

suggesting that lung cancer patients had more COVID-19-related anxiety than expected. Several

100

studies have indicated that, compared to individuals with no history of cancer, cancer patients have a

101

higher risk of death if they are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and develop COVID-19 (4, 5). In addition

102

to host traits, hospital admission and recurrent hospital visits are also potential risk factors for SARS-

103

CoV-2 infection (6). Because the media has widely disseminated this information, many cancer

104

patients are believed to experience anxiety regarding COVID-19. Although several countries have

105

advocated suggestions for cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic advocated from several

106

countries (7, 8), a consensus has not been reached; thus, there is no generalized standard for cancer

107

treatment during this pandemic.

108

In our study, among the patients receiving one of three types of treatment agents, a higher proportion

109

of patients who received ICI monotherapy delayed their treatment.

110

Recently, an expert advocated weight-based dosing of pembrolizumab (9). According to their

111

recommendation, patients should receive a 400-mg dose every 6 weeks instead of a 200-mg dose

112

every 3 weeks. This can reduce the number hospital visits and lower the risk of infection. Various

113

science-based plans and ideas such as this will be required during a pandemic period.

114

This study had several limitations. First, this study was retrospectively conducted in a single center,

115

which caused selection bias. Specifically, the proportion of delayed treatment cases is dependent on

116

the severity of the epidemic in an area. Kyoto has been deemed to be a mild epidemic area. Thus, it is

117

expected that areas where the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic is higher will be associated with

118

more patient requests for treatment delay. Second, because the COVID-19 pandemic is

119

unprecedented and ongoing, the study period may have been underestimated. Lastly, the effects of

120

treatment delay on the prognosis of lung cancer are unknown. Nevertheless, our study provides

121

insight into the COVID-19 pandemic impact on cancer treatment.

122

In conclusion, we revealed that 9.1% of lung cancer patients suffered anxiety and requested

123

treatment delay during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, oncologists should keep in mind that

124

cancer patients tend to have more anxiety than is expected under special circumstances such as the

125

COVID-19 pandemic.
