Abstract
Background
Due to no reliable risk stratification tool for severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
patients at admission, we aimed to construct an effective model for early identifying cases at high
risk of progression to severe COVID-19.
Methods

In this retrospective three-centers study, 372 non-severe COVID-19 patients during hospitalization
were followed for more than 15 days after admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or
critical COVID-19 and patients who kept non-severe state were assigned to the severe and
non-severe group, respectively. Based on baseline data of the two groups, we constructed a risk
prediction nomogram for severe COVID-19 and evaluate its performance.
Results
The train cohort consisted of 189 patients, while the two independent validation cohorts consisted
of 165 and 18 patients. Among all cases, 72 (19.35%) patients developed severe COVID-19. We
found that old age, and higher serum lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, the coefficient of
variation of red blood cell distribution width, blood urea nitrogen, direct bilirubin, lower albumin,
are associated with severe COVID-19. We generated the nomogram for early identifying severe
COVID-19 in the train cohort (AUC 0.912 [95% CI 0.846-0.978], sensitivity 85.71%, specificity
87.58%); in validation cohort (0.853 [0.790-0.916], 77.5%, 78.4%). The calibration curve for
probability of severe COVID-19 showed optimal agreement between prediction by nomogram and
actual observation. Decision curve and clinical impact curve analysis indicated that nomogram

conferred high clinical net benefit.

Introduction

Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) in December 2019, the number
of reported cases has surpassed 260,000 with over 11180 deaths worldwide, as of March 22 2020.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a member of coronaviruses
known to cause common colds and severe illnesses such as , is the cause of COVID-19[1] .
Compared with much higher overall case-fatality rates (CFR) for the severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 is being responsible
for more total deaths because of the increased transmission speed and the growing numbers of
cases [2]. Up to now, the World Health Organization (WHO) has raised global Coronavirus
Disease (COVID-19) outbreak risk to “Very High”, and SARS-CoV-2 infection has become a
serious threat to public health.

According to a report recently released by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) that included approximately 44,500 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections,
up to 15.8% were severe or critical. Most COVID-19 patients have a mild disease course, while
some patients experience rapid deterioration (particularly within 7-14 days) from onset of
symptoms into severe COVID-19 with or without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)[3].
Current epidemiological data suggests that the mortality rate of severe COVID-19 patients is
about 20 times higher than that of non-severe COVID-19 patients [4]. This situation highlights the
need to identify COVID-19 patients at risk of approaching to severe COVID-19. These severe
illness patients often require utilization of intensive medical resources. Therefore, early
identification of patients at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19 will facilitate
appropriate supportive care and reduce the mortality rate, unnecessary or inappropriate healthcare

utilization via patient prioritization.

At present, an early warning model for predicting COVID-19 patients at-risk of developing a
costly condition is scarce [3, 5]. So far, prognosis factors of COVID-19 mainly focus on the
immune cells. In our study, we found that older age, higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and
C-reactive protein (CRP), RDW (the coefficient of variation of red blood cell distribution width),
DBIL (direct bilirubin), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and lower albumin (ALB) on admission
correlated with higher odds of severe COVID-19. Based on these indexes, we developed and
validated an effective prognostic nomogram with high sensitivity and specificity for accurate
individualized assessment of the incidence of severe COVID-19. Among these indexes, the
prognostic role of RDW in COVID-19 is underestimated, which is associated with the increased
turnover of erythrocytes. Our results hinted that the turnover of RBC might involve in severe
illness.

Material and method
Data collection
Data on COVID-19 inpatients between January 20 th 2020 and March 2nd 2020 was retrospectively
collected from three clincial centers: Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital of
Wuhan University and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. A total of 381
patients with COVID-19 were enrolled, 9 patients younger than 15 years of age were excluded
from the study. Clinical laboratory test results, including SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection results,
biochemical indices, blood routine results, were collected from routine clinical practice. Written
informed consent was waived by the Ethics Commission of each hospital for emerging infectious

diseases. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Eighth People's Hospital of
Guangzhou, the Ethics Commission of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and
the Ethics Commission of Zhongnan Hospital.
The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was based on the Guidelines for Diagnosis and
Treatment of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (5th version), released by National Health
Commission of China. Suspected cases of COVID-19 requires meeting any of the following
epidemiology history criteria or any two of the following clinical manifestations: (A)
Epidemiological history: a history of travel to or residence in Wuhan in the last 14 days prior to
symptom onset; contact with a confirmed or suspected case of 2019-nCOV infection in the last 14
days prior to symptom onset; aggressive disease onset. (B) Clinical manifestation: Fever and/or
respiratory infection, or with normal/decreased white blood cells counts and normal/decreased
lymphocyte counts. In the absence of the above mentioned criteria for epidemiological history, the
suspected case should meet with all of the above mentioned criteria for clinical manifestation. A
confirmed case was defined as an individual with laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 which
required positive results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. For
diagnosis of Severe COVID-19 group, at least one of the following conditions should be met: (1)
Shortness of breath, Respiratory rate (RR) ≥30times/min, (2) Arterial oxygen saturation (Resting
status) ≤93%, or (3) the ratio of Partial pressure of oxygen to Fraction of inspiration O-2（PaO-2/
FiO-2 ）≤300mmHg.
Laboratory Methods
Clinical laboratory test results, including SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection results, biochemical
indices, blood routine results, were collected from routine clinical practice. Clinical laboratory test

results included albumin (ALB), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT),
blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), creatinine (Crea),
C-reactive protein (CRP), total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), globulin (GLB), lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH), procalcitonin (PCT), total bile acid (TBA), hemoglobin (HB), lymphocyte
count, monocyte count, neutrophil count, platelet distribution width (PDW), platelet (PLT), red
blood cell (RBC), RDW (red blood cell distribution width-coefficient variation). SARS-CoV-2
RNA were detected using real time quantitive PCR (RT-qPCR) on nucleic acid extracted from
upper respiratory swab samples. Upper respiratory swab samples were collected on all suspected
cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on admission and immediately placed into sterile tubes with viral
transport medium. All biochemical and hematology parameters were obtained via standard
automated laboratory methods and using commercially available kits following to the
manufacturers protocols.
Statistical Analysis
Categorical variables were expressed as frequency and percentages, and Fisher’s exact test was
performed to analyze the significance. Continuous variables were expressed as mean (standard
deviation [SD]), or median (interquartile range [IQR]), as appropriate. Parametric test (T test) and
non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney U) were used for continuous variables with or without normal
distribution, respectively. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Except for
filling missing values, all the statistical analyses were analyzed using R (version 3.6.2) with
default parameters.
Of all potential predictors in the dataset, 0.09 % of the fields had missing values. Predictor
exclusion was limited to those with more than 7% missing rate to minimize the bias of the

regression coefficient. [16]. Little's MCAR test (R package BaylorEdPsych) was used to assess the
suitability of the remaining missing values for imputation. This test is used to test whether missing
values are “missing completely at random” (MCAR) or biased. The missing values were imputed
by expectation-maximization (EM) method using SPSS statistical software, version 25 (SPSS, Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA).
To identify the relative importance of each feature, feature selection was performed using the
least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method, and prediction
models were built using logistic regression, decision tree, random forest (RF) and support vector
machine (SVM) using R package mlr, using 3-fold cross-validation for diverse parameter
conditions, respectively. As described previously, Nomograms were established with the rms
package and the performance of nomogram was evaluated by area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration (calibration plots and Hosmer-Lemeshow calibration
test) in R. During the external validation of the nomogram, the total points for each patient in the
validation cohort were calculated based on the established nomogram.

Results
Clinicopathologic characteristics of COVID-19 patients
The selection of the study population is illustrated in Figure 1. A total of 372 COVID-19 patients
were enrolled after admission from three centers in Guangzhou and Wuhan (Figure 1). All patients
with non-severe COVID-19 during hospitalization were followed for more than 15 days after
admission. Patients who deteriorated to severe or critical COVID-19 and patients who kept
non-severe state were assigned to the severe and non-severe group, respectively. There were no

significant differences in age, sex, disease types between the train cohort and validation cohorts
(Table 1). COVID-19 group consisted of 161 (85.2%) patients, with a median age of 45 years
(range, 33–62 years); 28 patients (14.8%) with a median age of 63.5 years (range, 54.5–72 years)
progressed to severe COVID-19. By the end of Feb 25, one patient with severe COVID-19 in the
train group died. None of the 189 patients from the train group had a history of exposure to
Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, 58 of them (30.7%) had not left Guangzhou recently, but had a
close exposure history with COVID-19 patients, and the rest (69.3%) were Wuhan citizens or
visited Wuhan recently. Other baseline characteristics in train cohort were shown in Table 2.

Prognostic factors of severe COVID-19
A total of 49 features were collected from each patient in the train cohort. After excluding
irrelevant and redundant features, 39 features were remained for LASSO regression analysis. The
results of the 189 patients showed that age, DBIL, RDW, BUN, CRP, LDH and ALB were
predictive factors for severe COVID-19 with maximal AUC (Figure 2A and 2B). Then we built
prediction models using logistic regression, decision tree, random forest (RF) and support vector
machine (SVM), and evaluated their performance by the receiver operating characteristic curve
(ROC) and the precision-recall curve (supplementary Figure 1). There were no big difference in
performance of these models except for decision tree. Therefore, logistic regression model was
used for further analysis owing to its high predictive power and interpretability.

Nomogram construction
The predictive nomogram that integrated 7 selected features for the incidence of severe

COVID-19 in the train cohort is shown (Figure 2C). To evaluate clinical applicability of our risk
prediction nomogram, decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve analysis (CICA)
were performed. The DCA and CICA visually showed that the nomogram had a superior overall
net benefit within the wide and practical ranges of threshold probabilities and impacted patient
outcomes (Figure 2D and 2E). In Figure 3A and 3B, the calibration plot for severe illness
probability showed a good agreement between the prediction by nomogram and actual observation
in the train cohort and validation cohort 1, respectively.

Validation of the predictive accuracy of nomogram
In the train cohort, the nomogram had a significantly high AUC 0.912 (95% CI 0.846-0.978) to
discriminate individuals with severe COVID-19 from non-severe COVID-19, with a sensitivity of
85.71 % and specificity of 87.58% (Figure 3C, Table 2). Cutpoint R package was used to calculate
optimal cutpoints by bootstraping the variability of the optimal cutpoints, which was 188.6358 for
our nomogram (corresponding to a threshold probability of 0.190). Then patients in the validation
cohorts were divided into the low group (score ≤188.6358) and the high group (score>188.6358)
for further analysis. In consistent with the train cohort, in validation cohort 1, AUC was 0.853 for
patients with severe COVID-19 versus non-severe COVID-19 with a sensitivity of 77.5 % and
specificity of 78.4% (Figure 3D, Table 3). In validation cohort 2, the sensitivity and the specificity
of the nomogram were observed to be 75% and 100%, respectively.

Discussion
Early identification of patients approaching to severe COVID-19 patients will lead to better

management and optimal use of medical resources. In this research, we identified older age,
higher LDH and CRP, DBIL, RDW, BUN, and lower ALB on admission correlated with higher
odds of severe COVID-19. Furthermore, we developed an effective prognostic nomogram
composed of 7 features, had significantly high sensitivity and specificity to distinguish individuals
with severe COVID-19 from non-severe COVID-19. DCA and CICA further indicated that our
nomogram conferred significantly high clinical net benefit, which is of great value for accurate
individualized assessment of the incidence of severe COVID-19.
So far, several researches reported some risk factors for severe COVID-19. However, the
nomogram could present a quantitive and practical predictor tool for risk stratification of
non-severe COVID-19 patients at admission. Though Liu et al developed a nomogram from a
single center with a small sample size and no external validation[5], our nomogram has a
significantly higher AUC in the train and validation cohorts than Liu’s nomogram (0.912/0.853 vs
0.849). Our nomogram predicted a total of 188.6358 points at a 19.0 % probability threshold,
which was close to the prevalence of severe COVID-19 (14.8%) in the training cohort and hence
consistent with the reality. This cut-off value may lead to a slight increase of false positive rates
but in the setting of this COVID-19 outbreak, a few high false positive rates are acceptable in
order to minimize risks of missed diagnosis. Meanwhile, application of the nomogram in the
training cohort and validation cohort showed good differentiation with AUC values of 0.912 and
0.853 respectively, as well as high sensitivity and specificity.
Furthermore, only seven easy-access features were included in our nomogram, including older
age, higher LDH and CRP, DBIL, RDW, BUN, and lower ALB. Age, NLR and LDH has been
reported to be risk factors for severe patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection [3, 5-7]. NLR, a widely

used marker for the assessment of system inflammation, was not identified by LASSO as an
important feature instead of LDH and CRP, which are associated with the systemic inflammatory
response [8]. However, LDH could predict severity of tissue damage in early stage of diseases as
an auxiliary marker [9]. These might be reasons why the lasso model did not identified NLR as a
more important feature. Consistent with other reports, our results indicate that patients with higher
levels of inflammation at admission might be at higher risk for severe COVID-19 as well.
Interestingly, we found RDW was also an important prognostic predictor for severe
COVID-19. RDW, one of the numbers or blood cell indices, reflects the variation in the size of
RBC (red blood cells), which has been tightly correlated with critical disease [10-12] but negligent
in COVID-19. It is a robust predictor of the risk of all cause patient mortality and bloodstream
infection in the critically ill [11-14], including acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia, ARDS
[10, 15]. RDW also can predict prognosis of sepsis, which was tied to poor COVID-19
outcomes-death[16].
The increased RDW in COVID-19 patients may be due to the increased turnover of
erythrocytes: 1) Pro-inflammatory states may be responsible for insufficient erythropoiesis with
structural and functional alteration of RBC, such as decreased deformability leading to more rapid
clearing of RBC. 2) Plasma cytokines such as interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α) could not only attenuate the renal erythropoietin (EPO) production, but also blunt the
erythroid progenitor response to EPO. In addition, INF-γ contributes to apoptosis of the erythroid
progenitors and decrease the EPO receptor expression[17]. 3) RBC are dynamic reservoirs of
cytokines [18]. Decreased deformability of RBC in severe illness leads to RBC lysis and release of
intracellular contents into the circulation[19], including some inflammatory cytokines. This

positive feedback could greatly promote the apparent shortened RBC survival and ultimately more
morphological variations in cell sizes (i.e., elevated RDW), increased inflammatory response, and
lead to severe illness. RDW can be regarded as an index of enhanced patient fragility and higher
vulnerability to adverse outcomes [20]. The elevated RDW may explain fatigue experienced by
severe COVID-19 patients.
Our study has several strengths: first, we provide a practical quantitive prediction tool based
on only 7 features which were relatively inexpensive and easy to be obtained directly from the
routine blood tests. Second, to guarantee the robustness of the conclusion, we included the data
from three centers with a large sample size and validation in independent cohorts. The
performance of our nomogram was efficient for clinical practice.
There were some limitations in the study. First, this is a retrospective study, including 372
patients with non-severe COVID-19 on admission. ACE2, the receptor for SARS-COV-2, has
been reported to be differentially expressed in different populations[21]. The differences in patient
profiles and healthcare might have effect on the performance of nomogram in other populations
outside of China. Further studies on different populations with larger patient cohorts are required
to verify our findings. Second, some patients are still in hospital and their condition may change
with follow-up. The final survival outcome is lacking. Third, the study has not included IgM and
IgG antibodies detection. More comprehensive investigations need to be conducted to explain the
characteric of the 7 features.
In summary, our data suggest that our nomogram could early identify the severe COVID-19
patients, and RDW was vaulable for prediction of severe diseases. Our nomogram is especially
valuable for risk stratification management, which will be helpful for alleviating insufficient

Figure 1. Flow chart of study participants in train and validation groups.

Figure 2. Construction of prediction nomogram in patients with COVID-19. The nomogram
composed of age, DBIL, RDW_CV, BUN, CRP, LDH and ALB was developed. (A) LASSO
coefficient profiles (y-axis) of the 39 features. The lower x-axis indicated the log (λ). The top
x-axis has the average numbers of predictors. (B) Identification of the optimal penalization
coefficient (λ) in the LASSO model was peformed via 3-fold cross-validation based on minimum
criteria. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) was plotted verse log (λ). The
y-axis indicated AUC. Red dots represent average AUC for each model with a given λ, and
vertical bars through the red dots showed the upper and lower values of the AUC. The dotted
vertical lines represents the optimal values of λ. When the optimal λ value of 0.042 with log (λ) =
- 3.17 was selected, the AUC reached the peak. The upper and lower x-axis indicated the same
meaning as in Figure 2A. LASSO, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. (C) Nomogram
predicting the severe COVID-19 probability in patients with COVID-19 infection was plotted. To
use this nomogram in clinical management, an individual patient’s value is located on each
variable axis, and a line is plotted upward to calculate the number of points received for each
variable value. The sum of these scores is located on the Total points axis and draw a line straight
down to get the probability of severe COVID-19. (D) Decision curve compares the net clinical
benefits of three scenarios in predicting the severe COVID-19 probability: a perfect prediction
model (grey line), screen none (horizontal solid black line), and screen based on the nomogram
(blue line). (E) Clinical impact curve of the nomogram plot the number of COVID-19 patients
classified as high risk, and the number of cases classified high risk with severe NCAP at each high
