Abstract

2

Background

3

Given that an individual’s age and gender are strongly predictive of COVID-19 outcomes, do

4

such factors imply anything about preferable therapeutic options?

5

Methods

6

An analysis of electronic health records for a large (68,466-case), international COVID-19

7

cohort, in five-year age strata, revealed age-dependent sex differences. In particular, we

8

surveyed the effects of systemic hormone administration in women. The primary outcome for

9

estradiol therapy was death. Odds Ratios (ORs) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were

10

analyzed for 37,086 COVID-19 women in two age groups: pre- (15-49 years) and post-

11

menopausal (>50 years).

12

Results

13

The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher in women than men (about +15%) and, in

14

contrast, the fatality rate is higher in men (about +50%). Interestingly, the relationships

15

between these quantities are also linked to age. Pre-adolescent girls had the same risk of

16

infection and fatality rate as boys. Adult premenopausal women had a significantly higher risk

17

of infection than men in the same five-year age stratum (about 16,000 vs. 12,000 cases). This

18

ratio changed again in postmenopausal women, with infection susceptibility converging with

19

men. While fatality rates increased continuously with age for both sexes, at 50 years there

20

was a steeper increase for men. Thus far, these types of intricacies have been largely

21

neglected. Because the hormone 17ß-estradiol has a positive effect on expression of the

22

human ACE2 protein—which plays an essential role for SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry—

23

propensity score matching was performed for the women´s sub-cohort, comparing users

24

versus non-users of estradiol. This retrospective study of hormone therapy in female COVID-

25

19 patients shows that the fatality risk for women >50 yrs receiving estradiol therapy (user

26

group) is reduced by more than 50%; the OR was 0.33, 95 % CI [0.18, 0.62] and the Hazard

27

Ratio was 0.29, 95% CI [0.11,0.76]. For younger, pre-menopausal women (15-49 yrs), the risk

of COVID-19 fatality is the same irrespective of estradiol treatment, probably because of higher

2

endogenous estradiol levels.

3

Conclusions

4

As of this writing, still no effective drug treatment is available for COVID-19; since estradiol

5

shows such a strong improvement regarding fatality in COVID-19, we suggest prospective

6

studies on the potentially more broadly protective roles of this naturally occurring hormone.

Background

Epidemiological Data

12

Early epidemiological observations indicated that SARS-CoV-2 infects all age groups, but with

13

a higher rate among men (58.1%) than women (41.9%) (Guan et al., 2020). The fraction of

14

males among critically ill patients testing positive for COVID-19 is higher, and the outcome is

15

far worse than for women (among casualties, 66% are male and 34% are female) (Yang et al.,

16

2020). From a medical perspective of sex and gender, considering the epidemiological data in

17

a more differentiated manner—based, for instance, on age, sex and lifestyle/behavior

18

patterns—may enable the identification of sub-populations with increased susceptibility (or

19

resistance) to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

20

As an example of such nuances, consider that spread of the viral infection exhibits a

21

sex-dependence, and also a higher fatality rate amongst older patients, >60 yrs in age (Verity

22

et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). In addition, smoking behavior has been one of the most

23

appreciated gender differences thus far, and it may underlie the far worse outcomes in men

24

than in women (Cai, 2020); however, this trend has not been confirmed beyond a handful of

25

countries, and the causal aspects of these trends are likely to be rather complex.

Pathophysiological Context

2

SARS-CoV-2 virions use the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a host-cell receptor

3

(Hoffmann et al., 2020) for viral uptake. Human ACE2 is an essential part of the renin-

4

angiotensin system (RAS), and is encoded on the X chromosome (Crackower et al., 2002).

5

ACE2 is widely distributed in tissues, including lung alveolar (type II) epithelial cells, the

6

vascular endothelium, heart, kidney, and testis (Gheblawi et al., 2020). It has extensive

7

vascular and organ-protective functions mediated via angiotensin (Ang 1-7) by the angiotensin

8

II receptor type 2 (AT2) and the Mas receptor (MasR). Seeland et al. have reviewed the sexual

9

dimorphism, by virtue of the X chromosomal gene location of ACE2 and the AT2 receptor, as

10

well as the effects of 17ß-estradiol on different components of the renin-angiotensin-

11

aldosterone system (RAAS) (Seeland & Regitz-Zagrosek, 2012). Estrogens downregulate the

12

angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) signaling pathway by inhibiting angiotensin-converting

13

enzyme (ACE) activity (which, in turn, diminishes the production of angiotensin II peptide). This

14

classical ACE/AngII/AT1R regulatory axis counter-regulates the ACE2/Ang 1-7/MasR axis.

15
16

Based on gender-specific differences in genetics and sex hormone levels, the worse outcomes

17

of SARS-CoV-2 infection in men could be triggered by (i) conditions that are associated with a

18

decrease in ACE2 expression, such as older age (Xie, Chen, Wang, Zhang, & Liu, 2006) or

19

(ii) by the more direct loss/depletion of active ACE2 (e.g., because of binding by SARS-CoV-

20

2). Moreover, the regulation of immune cells and cytokine activity are also linked to sex

21

hormone levels. In terms of disease etiology, this could represent another set of factors that

22

underlies the sex differences in pulmonary and vascular symptoms, severity, and outcomes of

23

COVID-19.

Objectives of this Study

As is known from the literature, endogenous estradiol has beneficial cardiovascular and

immune system-stabilizing effects in premenopausal women, as well as within pregnancy

(Dubey & Jackson, 2001; Straub, 2007). We hypothesize that exogenous estradiol intake is a

protective strategy in pre- and post-menopausal women suffering from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This study assesses the effects of exogenous sex hormone intake from oral contraceptives by

5

premenopausal women, and estradiol hormone therapy by postmenopausal women with

6

SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 disease on the outcome death.

Database and Inclusion Criteria

9

COVID-19 patients were identified via ICD-10 code U07.1 or the presence of SARS-CoV-2-

10

related RNA diagnosis within the last six months. (We did not include diagnoses coded as

11

U07.2 ["COVID-19, virus not identified"] because “laboratory confirmation is inconclusive or

12

not available” in such cases.) The data were collected from electronic health records (EHRs)

13

in a TriNetX Real-World database provided by a global health research network; with

14

healthcare organizations spanning 17 countries, this system deploys a linked and continually

15

updated global health research network representing over 300 million patients.

16

In the present work, we conducted a retrospective analysis of a large international

17

COVID-19 cohort comprising 68,466 cases. Sub-cohorts were disaggregated by age (15+

18

years) and sex before statistical analyses were performed. The incidence data are presented

19

in age steps of five years, from 5 to 86+ years for both sexes. Because of the expected estradiol

20

hormone status, two subgroups of the female cohort were analyzed: we defined 15-49 years

21

as the younger (pre-menopausal) group and 50+ for the older (post-menopausal) group. The

22

group comparison was calculated for COVID-19–positive patients with supplemental estradiol

23

versus subjects without estradiol in the respective age strata.

Real-World Evidence Data

26

Using real-world evidence (RWE) data affords several advantages over more traditional

27

approaches. Prospective, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blinded multicenter clinical

28

trials are the gold standard of evidence generation in medicine; however, such efforts are often

slow and expensive. Furthermore, classical trials generally represent artificial situations with

2

well-selected—and thus non-representative—pools of patients (e.g., often young men with few

3

to no co-morbidities). Some of these issues can be alleviated by turning to RWE gleaned from

4

EHR–derived data. Despite all this, one disadvantage of retrospective, implicit recruitments is

5

the missing randomized placebo arm of the statistical study. Thus, generating suitable control

6

cohorts is one of the most important aspects of an RWE-based study.

7

advantage of RWE is the large number of patients who can be recruited—this, in turn, yields

8

relatively tighter confidence intervals and allows for cohort balancing or patient matching. In

9

non-RWE studies, a confounder analysis can be performed, but doing so is made more difficult

10

One significant

because of the relatively small number of patients enrolled.

Regarding gender medicine aspects and analyzing the data in terms of 5-year age strata, the

20

incidence rates of women and men with known SARS-CoV-2 infection can be seen to differ by

21

sex and age (Figure 2). The highest SARS-CoV-2 infection numbers among women, compared

22

to age-matched men, is observed in women with what would be expected to be high levels of

23

serum estradiol—i.e., between 15 and 49 years of age. The incidence of COVID-19 in women

women vs. n=15,918 men). Starting with 60 and up to 85 years of age, the data show a relative

3

decrease in frequency among women (n=7,334 women vs. n=7,171 men). In older women and

4

andropause men (age strata 65 to 80), the statistical susceptibility to viral infection converges

5

(see the closely-matched red and blue pairs of bars in Figure 2, in the range of 65-85-yrs old).

6

Near the end of life, defined as 85+ years old, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher

in women (n=5,865) than in men (n=5,406). At the opposite end of the age spectrum, note that

all pre-adolescents (girls and boys) have similar risks of infection.

Correspondingly, a higher risk of death was associated with men; the hazard ratio (HR) was

4

2.7 [1.42, 5.08] with a lower survival probability for men than women. At a timepoint 200 days

after diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, men were associated with a lower chance of survival

than women (p<0.0001).

Results for the Female Sub-cohort: A Link between Exogenous Estradiol and Outcomes?

7

In order to assess the potential effects of exogenous female sex hormones in enhancing the

8

survival likelihood for women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we analyzed a sub-cohort of only

9

women. A logistic regression analysis was performed for the combined outcome variable

10

“death”. The outcome was calculated for n=18,892 women, aged 15-49 years, who used oral

11

contraceptives such as estradiol and ethinylestradiol (defined as a ‘user’ group), or without

12

regular use of oral contraceptives (defined as ‘non-user’); we also included n=16,891 peri- and

13

post-menopausal women (50+), either with estradiol hormone usage (‘user’) or without regular

14

usage of estradiol hormone (‘non-user’).

15
16

After matching the data of propensity scores for women aged 50+ with COVID-19, there was

an outcome of fatality. The OR calculated via logistic regression analysis for the combined

Discussion

11

This study focuses on the incidence and outcome of COVID-19 infections by considering an

12

age- and sex-disaggregated data analysis. We identified a sex-specific distribution of COVID-

13

19 incidence rates, with the highest frequencies being among premenopausal women in the

14

20–55-year age range. We also found a higher fatality rate of men compared to age-matched

15

women, beginning at 50 years of age.

16
17

The patterns of incidence rates of women and men with SARS-CoV-2 infection, measured

18

using 5-year age strata, differs from the trends in the number of deaths following the same age

strata (Figure 3). This gender-based discrepancy might hint at different factors as contributing

to the differential risks of infection and COVID-19 fatality among women versus men; note that

Morgan, & Klein, 2020). Similarly, Klein et al. reported in the United States a significant male-

10

female difference in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths (Klein et al., 2020).

11

The occurrence of most cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection within the reproductive ages—i.e.,

12

before age ~50 (see Fig 2 and the dip towards the right-hand side)—hints at an association

13

with relatively higher estrogen levels. General features of the datasets used in our large

14

international COVID-19 cohort, comprising n=68,466 cases, are consistent with the public data

15

for the incidence of coronavirus infection and the fatality rate for COVID-19 disease in

16

Germany, as presented by the Robert-Koch Institute (RKI) website (Robert-Koch-Institut,

17

2020). In our study the incidence of coronavirus infection in young women is about +15%

18

higher than age-matched men; however, the fatality rate is about +50% higher in men than

19

women.

20

The data in our present study indicate that pre-menopausal women are disproportionately

21

more infected with coronavirus than men in the same age brackets, but they do not become

22

as seriously ill, as evidenced by lower fatality rates; we believe this to be an interesting

23

observation for sex and gender medicine experts.

24

Gender-specific epidemiological differences, with pathophysiological bases, have been

25

published in the recent past, pointing to potential mechanistic roles for the sex hormones.

However, X-chromosomal location of the ACE2- and the AT2-receptor genes and the

regulation by androgens, should also be considered other biochemical/physiological factors

2

to which gender-correlated discrepancies might be attributed (Dorak & Karpuzoglu, 2012).

Figure 6 schematizes the potential downstream influence of 17β-estradiol on the renin-

5

angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), including protective effects for target organs and

6

tissues such as those of the lung, kidney, heart, cardiovascular system, adipose tissue, gut,

7

testes, and the central nervous system. We emphasize that this diagram offers a tentative

8

hypothesis for the mechanistic pathways that could be most salient in SARS-CoV-2 infections

9

of pre-menopausal women with high estradiol levels. A central molecular component here is

10

human ACE2, which is known to interact strongly with the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein

11

(Turner, Hiscox, & Hooper, 2004) and, together with the "transmembrane protease, serine 2"

12

(TMPRSS2) enzyme, play an essential role in viral entry into host cells (Hoffmann et al., 2020).

13
14

In terms of molecular mechanisms, note that 17β-estradiol acts to block the IL-6 cytokine

15

pathway and downregulate the angiotensin II (Ang II)–angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R)

16

signaling pathway. One route by which it does so is by inhibiting the activity of angiotensin-

17

converting enzyme (ACE), as schematized in Figure 6. Also, as mentioned in the Introduction,

18

the classical ACE–Ang II–AT1R regulatory axis and the ACE2–Ang 1-7–MasR/AT2R signaling

19

pathway counter-regulate one another (Figure 6), and this is another way in which 17β-

20

estradiol can act: activation of the Mas receptor or AT2R activation via estradiol binding has a

21

protective effect on target cells. Activation of the MasR and AT2R receptors protect target

22

cells and organs by virtue of anti-fibrotic, anti-oxidant, anti-hypertrophic, and vasodilatory

23

effects (Seeland & Regitz-Zagrosek, 2012). The 17β-estradiol hormone increases expression

24

levels and activity of ACE2 in adipose tissue, kidneys, and myocardium (La Vignera et al.,

25

2020).

26
27

Yet another potential molecular mechanism for estradiol’s effects stems from ACE2 and AT2R

28

both being located on the X chromosome.

subtype 2) expression is increased by estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) agonists such as

2

estrogens (Janele et al. 2006) and, as diagramed in Fig 6, this protease is also involved in

3

cellular uptake of SARS-CoV-2 virions. These systems also feature feedback: ACE2-mediated

4

cell protection is lost following endocytosis of ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 (indeed, depletion of cell-

5

surface ACE2 is a critical pathological outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection), and this ACE2

6

shedding is mediated by three possible pathways that each elevate the activity of the

7

metalloprotease known as ADAM-17. Moreover, ADAM-17 activity is followed by soluble

8

tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-alpha) release into the extracellular space (not shown explicitly

9

in Fig 6). 17β-estradiol attenuates this latter pathway by inhibiting IL-6 activity (Fig 6). In

10

conclusion, the levels of cell-surface–exposed ACE2 generally will be higher in women

11

because of both (i) the balance between the effects of 17β-estradiol (activating and repressing)

12

on the multiple pathways shown in Fig 6, and (ii) by virtue of the X chromosomal location of

13

the ACE2 gene. Thus, while pre-menopausal women might be at a higher risk of initial SARS-

14

CoV-2 infection, they are more protected from a severe course of the disease.

Figure 6: A hypothetical mechanistic pathway for the presumably protective role of 17β-

estradiol in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The membrane-tethered ACE2 protein has an amino-

terminal catalytic domain (a peptidase) that faces the extracellular space.

Extending the hypothetical model and molecular factors described above, the relative

7

dominance of the MasR- and AT2R-based receptor signaling pathways in pre-menopausal

8

women has positive (beneficial) impacts upon downstream organ function, and it could

9

represent a significant basis for the sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection; pre-menopausal

10

women are more protected from cardiovascular, lung, and kidney diseases than their age-

11

matched male peers. Recently, it has been shown that the estrogen-mediated up-regulation

12

of the Mas-receptor contributes to the prevention of acute lung injury and affects endothelial

13

barrier stabilization (Erfinanda et al., 2020). A relative protection of females over males has

14

also been observed in other studies with experimental animal models of acute lung injury

15

(Carey et al., 2007); intriguingly, this protection was lost in ovariectomized mice, but restored

16

upon estrogen replacement (Speyer et al., 2005). The 17β-estradiol molecule attenuates lung

17

vascular permeability and edema (Breithaupt-Faloppa et al., 2020), and estrogens reduce the

18

pulmonary vasoconstriction during hypoxia by increasing levels of prostacyclin and nitric oxide

19

(NO) (Breithaupt-Faloppa et al., 2020). Moreover, in experimental mice models, active ACE2

20

alleviates pulmonary injury and vascular damage (Imai et al., 2005; Kuba et al., 2005). These

21

animal model experiments point to mechanisms that underlie the organ-protective effects of

22

17β-estradiol, such as anti-fibrotic, anti-oxidant, anti-hypertrophic, and vascular dilation

23

effects.

24
25

We assume that premenopausal women have higher basal ACE2 serum levels than age-

26

matched men—a scenario that could translate into a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in

27

women. Higher basal ACE2 levels could be due to the effects of estradiol on RAAS (Figure 6)

28

and/or the fact that the ACE2 and AT2R genes map to the X chromosome. In genetic terms,

29

this sex-linkage would allow women to be heterozygous and differently assorted compared to

1

men, who are hemizygous (Gemmati et al., 2020). The second X chromosome is not

2

inactivated in approximately 15 % of genes consistently escape from this inactivation and

3

another 15 % of genes vary between individuals or tissues in whether they are subject to, or

4

escape from, inactivation (Balaton, Cotton, & Brown, 2015). This may account for some of the

5

differences that are seen between men and women (sexual dimorphism) and could be a

6

reason for higher expression levels of ACE2- and ATIIR proteins in women (i.e., a gene dosage

7

effect).

8
9

Another pertinent mechanistic pathway, potentially triggered or modulated by the types and

10

levels of sex hormones, could be immunological—namely, gender-specific differences in the

11

immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A recent study has linked higher mortality among

12

men to a “cytokine storm”, which in turn closely relates to the severity of symptoms such as

13

pulmonary edema, fibrosis and other deleterious downstream effects associated with acute

14

lung injury (Li et al., 2020). An individual’s immune response to viral infections can vary with

15

fluctuations in sex hormone concentrations, including steroid hormones such as estrogens,

16

progesterone, and testosterone. Each immune cell type is influenced by all three of these

17

major sex hormones, albeit with different and partly opposing effects. From a biomedical

18

perspective of sex and gender, interleukin-6 (IL-6) is particularly interesting. IL-6 is a cytokine

19

with both anti- and pro-inflammatory effects. It can be produced by almost all stromal and

20

immune system cells (e.g., monocytes, lymphocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells, mast

21

cells, dendritic cells), and it is believed to play a central role in precipitating the cytokine storms

22

that, in turn, yield such severe symptoms from a SARS-CoV-2 infection (McGonagle, Sharif,

23

O'Regan, & Bridgewood, 2020). Notably, the endogenous female sex hormone 17β-estradiol

24

blocks the IL-6 cytokine pathway, while the male sex hormones (the androgens) increase IL-6

25

production (Dorak & Karpuzoglu, 2012).

26
27

Given the general, evidence-based model that we have presented above—namely, that the

28

female sex hormone estradiol is closely coupled to a broad array of downstream physiological

1

effects, including those related to SARS-CoV-2 infection—the second part of our retrospective

2

data analysis examines the outcome (required ventilation and death) of pre- and post-

3

menopausal women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including as a function of whether or not

4

exogenous estradiol is in use. In performing this analysis, we again employed the large,

5

international COVID-19 cohort developed in this study. To our knowledge, this is the first report

6

that has evaluated the impact of exogenous estradiol sex hormonal use, either for

7

contraceptive purposes or for postmenopausal symptoms, on COVID-19 fatality.

8
9

Among post-menopausal women, we observed a significant difference in the rates of death

10

between women with regular estradiol use (user group) and those without estradiol sex

11

hormone intake (non-user group). Furthermore, our data analysis included distinct sub-groups

12

of young women (15-49 years of age) with and without oral contraceptives. The dominant form

13

of estrogen used for “the pill” is ethinylestradiol. The magnitude of the protective effect of the

14

usage of oral contraception, compared to the non-users sub-population, is smaller among

15

younger versus older women; this may be the case because endogenous estradiol levels are

16

typically already higher in younger women than for post-menopausal women, thus drowning-

17

out any differences between user/not-user groups. Moreover, the level of exogenous hormone

18

intake for purposes of contraception is generally less than that used for post-menopausal

19

estradiol hormone therapy.

20
21

Note that other current trials are testing the effect of sex hormones (estrogen and testosterone)

22

on COVID-19 outcomes. A brief, seven-day course of estradiol, delivered via a transdermal

23

patch, could be a safe approach to reduce symptom severity in adult men and in older women,

24

when administered prior to intubation (ClinicalTrials.gov; Identifier: NCT04359329). The time-

25

course for estradiol treatment may need to be evaluated for its positive effects on lung

26

protection, and whether it could be an effective therapeutic approach not only for women but

27

also for men with COVID-19. This type of question cannot be answered solely by the data

28

presented here, and instead addressing this question is a key topic for further research.

2

Based on the main findings of our present study, we believe there are no concerns for

3

continuing the use of sex hormones that contain estradiol prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Even

4

though it can be seen in the data that the risk of infection is higher in pre-menopausal women

5

with higher endogenous estradiol levels, compared to either men of the same age strata or to

6

post-menopausal women, the clinical course of COVID-19 disease, and the ultimate mortality

7

rate, is lower in women with higher estradiol levels. Higher survival probabilities are particularly

8

evident in post-menopausal women who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and who regularly use

9

exogenous estradiol.

10
11
12

Conclusions

13

Pre-menopausal women are at a relatively high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the survival

14

probability in this below-50 age range is significantly higher in women than in men. A chief

15

finding of this study is the strong positive effect of regular estradiol hormone therapy on the

16

survival rates of post-menopausal women.
