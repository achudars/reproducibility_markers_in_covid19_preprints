Abstract

We used a new strategy to screen cytokines associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Cytokines that can classify populations in different states of SARS-CoV-2 infection
were first screened in cross-sectional serum samples from 184 subjects by 2 statistical
analyses. The resultant cytokines were then analyzed for their interrelationships and
fluctuating features in sequential samples from 38 COVID-19 patients. Three cytokines,
M-CSF, IL-8 and SCF, which were clustered into 3 different correlation groups and had
relatively small fluctuations during SARS-CoV-2 infection, were selected for the
construction of a multiclass classification model. This model discriminated healthy
individuals and asymptomatic and nonsevere patients with accuracy of 77.4% but was
not successful in classifying severe patients. Further searching led to a single cytokine,
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which classified severe from nonsevere COVID-19
patients with a sensitivity of 84.6% and a specificity of 97.9% under a cutoff value of
1128 pg/ml. The level of this cytokine did not increase in nonsevere patients but was
significantly elevated in severe patients. Considering its potent antiinflammatory
function, we suggest that HGF might be a new candidate therapy for critical COVID19. In addition, our new strategy provides not only a rational and effective way to focus
on certain cytokine biomarkers for infectious diseases but also a new opportunity to
probe the modulation of cytokines in the immune response.

Introduction
The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is imposing a heavy burden on
global public health. As of May 30, 2020, COVID-19 has been confirmed in more than
5 million people worldwide, carrying a mortality of approximately 6.2% [1]. COVID19 is caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARSCoV-2), which shares 79.5% sequence homology with SARS-CoV [2]. The high
transmission capability of SARS-CoV-2, which is indicated by a basic reproductive
number R0 of 2.0 - 3.77 [3, 4, 5], led to the rapid spread of the virus from a city to the
whole world in 3 months.
SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to infect
cells [6, 7]. The ACE2 distribution is enriched in human alveolar epithelial cells,
making the lung a vulnerable target organ [8]. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2
commonly manifest lower respiratory tract symptoms of dry cough or, less commonly,
dyspnea [9, 10]. These symptoms reflect, to some extent, inflammation in the lung.
Inflammation is a ‘side effect’ of the immune response. Viral infection induces innate
and/or adaptive immune responses by the host immune system. Initiation of these
responses can result in the production of some cytokines that induce a proinflammatory
response and attract cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, to sites of infection
and in turn cause damage to normal host tissues by releasing cytotoxic substances [11].
In COVID-19 patients, evidence has indicated that the levels of some cytokines are
significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients, and cytokine storms are associated with
the severity of the disease [10, 12, 13, 14]. In this study, we searched cytokine
biomarkers of COVID-19 by a new strategy taking into account the fluctuations and
interrelationships of cytokines, which have been largely overlooked in previous studies,
and identified cytokines that can classify populations with different conditions during
SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods
Patients and samples

Cross-sectional serum samples were obtained from 184 subjects, including 37 healthy
controls, 37 asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by RTPCR, 97 nonsevere or moderate COVID-19 inpatients, and 13 severe COVID-19
patients. The asymptomatic individuals and COVID-19 inpatients were included from
previous studies. Asymptomatic individuals and COVID-19 patients were confirmed
by RT-PCR assay from nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens.
Sequential serum samples used for the fluctuation analysis were obtained from 38
COVID-19 inpatients. These patients were among the subjects in a previous study [15].
Serum samples were collected from these patients every 3 days during hospitalization,
and each patient provided at least 4 sequential samples.
The study was approved by the Ethics Commission of Chongqing Medical University
(reference number: 2020006-1). Written informed consent was waived by the Ethics
Commission of the designated hospital for emerging infectious diseases.
Detection of cytokines
Concentrations of 48 cytokines and chemokines in serum samples were measured using
a Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine Screening Panel (48-Plex #12007283, Bio-Rad)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All serum samples were inactivated at
56 °C for 30 min before the assay.
Definitions
A confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as an individual with
nasopharyngeal swabs positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by RT-PCR. An
asymptomatic case was defined as an individual with a positive RT-PCR result but
without any relevant clinical symptoms in the preceding 14 days but before 2
consecutive negative RT-PCR results. Severe COVID-19 was determined if a COVID19 patient showed any of the following: shortness of breath, RR ≥ 30 bpm, blood
oxygen saturation ≤ 93% (at rest), PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300 mmHg, or pulmonary inflammation
that significantly progressed > 50% within 24 to 48 hours. Nonsevere patients,
including mild and moderate patients, were defined as COVID-19 patients with
symptoms but that could not be classified as severe.
Multiclass classification model

A multinomial logistic regression model was used to determine the class of individuals.
A multiclass classifier was trained by fitting the multinomial logistic model using the
‘nnet’ package of R software, version 3.6.0. A ten-fold cross-validation method was
used to evaluate the performance of the model. Briefly, all the subjects or healthy
controls (the cross-sectional samples) were randomly divided into 5 sets using the ‘caret’
package of R software; 3 of the 5 sets were used for training, and the remaining 2 were
used for testing. This procedure was repeated 10 times so that each set was under the
testing set. The classification accuracy was assessed in 10-fold cross-validation, and the
mean and standard deviation (sd) were calculated.
Model evaluation by quasiindependent data
Serum samples collected at other timepoints from a portion of the subjects in the crosssectional study, including 35 asymptomatic subjects, 65 nonsevere patients and 1 severe
patient, were used as a quasiindependent dataset to evaluate the predictive performance
of the multiclass classification model. These data were input into the model, allowing
the model to predict the class of each sample in the quasiindependent data. The area
under the curve (AUC) of each class was calculated to assess the performance of the
model using the ‘pROC’ package of R software.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as the median values (interquartile ranges, IQRs),
and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparisons; categorical variables were
expressed as numbers (percentages), and the χ² test or Fisher’s exact test was used for
comparisons. p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistically significant differences,
and p < 0.001 was considered to indicate highly statistically significant differences
(shown as ***). Statistical analyses were performed using R software, version 3.6.0.

Results
Strategy for searching cytokine biomarkers for COVID-19
Ideal cytokine biomarkers for COVID-19 should meet the following 3 criteria: (1)
accurate, differentiating people with different statuses of SARS-CoV-2 infection with
good sensitivity and specificity; (2) stable, accurately differentiating these people at

different stages during the infection; and (3) small in number, fewer cytokines means
less expense and easier establishment of a testing system. With these criteria in mind,
we used a screening strategy for searching cytokine biomarkers for COVID-19. In the
1st round of screening, cross-sectional serum samples from people with different SARSCoV-2 infection statuses were tested for 48 cytokines. These cytokines were
statistically tested by Wilcoxon analysis or/and ANOVA for their capacity to classify
different groups. Overlapping cytokines meeting the screening criteria (described
below) in the statistical analyses were selected for further screening. In the 2nd round of
screening, the fluctuation and similarity in the fluctuation patterns of cytokines during
illness were analyzed in sequential samples. The rationale for this step is as follows. (1)
A smaller fluctuation (in a patient) means more stability over time, translating to less
impact of the sampling timepoint on the level of cytokines. A prerequisite for this notion
is that the levels of cytokines do fluctuate, which is evidenced by the following results.
(2) A similar fluctuation pattern for different cytokines indicates that these cytokines
are partially redundant, at least statistically, in classifying different populations. For an
extreme example, simultaneously selecting 2 cytokines with 100% correlation would
be completely redundant, contradicting criterion (3) for ideal cytokine biomarkers.
Cytokines selected through the 2 rounds of screening were used to construct a
multiclass classification model. Then, the obtained model was tested by partially
dependent samples (Fig. 1).

Preliminary screening of cytokines in the cross-sectional samples
Serum samples collected from 184 subjects were measured for the concentration of 48
cytokines (Fig. 2A) by the system proven to be stable and repeatable (Fig. S1).
Demographics and baseline characteristics of the subjects are summarized in Table S1.
Wilcoxon analysis was used to identify cytokines with significant differences between
the healthy control group and the other 3 groups. Eighteen cytokines were screened out
by P<0.001 (Fig. 2B). ANOVA was used to screen cytokines that could classify the 3
groups, and 22 cytokines were selected by the criteria of P < 0.001 and F > 10 (Fig.
1C). Overlapping of the 2 sets of cytokines resulted in 10 cytokines, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8,
IL-13, MIP-1α, eotaxin, M-CSF, IFN-γ, SCF and IL-R2α (Fig. 1D).

Screening of cytokines by using sequential samples
We followed up 38 confirmed COVID-19 patients to examine the dynamic change in

48 cytokines (Fig. 3A). The demographics and baseline characteristics of these patients
are summarized in Table S2. Forty-eight cytokines in all the serum samples were
detected in parallel, and the samples from one patient were detected in the same plate.
The correlations among the dynamic changes in the 10 cytokines selected above were
analyzed. To this end, we first normalized the concentrations of cytokines by dividing
the concentrations of each cytokine at sequential points by the concentration of that
cytokine at the first point (Fig. S2A). This step eliminated the variation in cytokine
levels among different individuals. Correlation coefficients were calculated between
each cytokine and each of the other 9 cytokines for each patient, leading to 38
correlation coefficients (38 patients) for each correlation pair. The means of these
correlation coefficients were calculated and used to cluster the cytokines. As shown in
Fig. 3B, 3 clusters of correlated cytokines were found. Cluster 1 includes IL-6 and MCSF. Cluster 2 includes IL-7 and IL-8. Cluster 3 comprises IL-13, SCF, MIP-1α,
eotaxin, IFN-γ and IL-2Rα. Relatively high correlations were found for the cytokine
pairs IL-6/M-CSF (r=0.79) and IFN-γ/IL-2Rα (r=0.73). As examples, the fluctuating
patterns of these two pairs of cytokines from 9 patients are shown in Fig. S3.
Choosing 1 cytokine from each cluster would decrease redundancy since the
correlations within the clusters were higher than those between clusters (Fig. 3B). To
target the candidate cytokines, we analyzed the coefficient of variation (CV) of the
cytokines in each cluster. The CV of each cytokine for each patient was calculated using
the normalized concentrations of each cytokine described above, and the CVs of each
cytokine from the 38 patients are plotted in Fig. 3C. All of the cytokines fluctuated in
the sequential serum samples, as reflected by median CVs ranging from 15.5% (IQR
5.8%-64.6%) (SCF) to 56.4% (IQR 22.1%-131.7%) (IL-6). The ranks of the mean CVs
in each cluster are as follows: C1, IL-6 > M-CSF; C2, IL-7 > IL-8; and C3, IL-13 >
eotaxin > IL-2Rα > MIP-1α > IFN-γ > SCF. The most stable cytokines in each cluster
were M-CSF, IL-8 and SCF. Interestingly, these 3 cytokines also performed best in
each cluster in classifying different populations by univariate multiclass classification
model (Fig. 3D). Thus, we chose these cytokines for the construction of a multiclass
classification model.

Construction and testing of a multiclass classification model
The training dataset from the cross-sectional samples was used to construct a multiclass
classification model. The estimated overall accuracy of classification in 10-fold crossvalidation was 77.4% (with a standard deviation of 5.2%). The estimated mean
accuracy for the classification of the healthy control, asymptomatic and nonsevere
groups in 10-fold cross-validation was 76.0%, 76.2 and 88.6%, respectively (Fig. 4A).
Unfortunately, the model performed poorly for the classification of the severe group
(Fig. 4A). The AUC calculated using the quasiindependent dataset of validation was
0.883, 0.920, 0.920 and 0.923 for the healthy control, asymptomatic, nonsevere and
severe groups, respectively (Fig. 4B).

To identify cytokines with better performance in discriminating severe from nonsevere
COVID-19 patients, we screened the cytokines again from among those showing
significant differences between these 2 groups. Seven cytokines, IL-8, MIP-1α, HGF,
IL-16, IL-18, MCP-3 and SCGF-β, were screened out by Wilcoxon analysis. Among
the 7 cytokines, HGF was apparently superior to the others in ANOVA, with a far
greater F value than all the other cytokines (Fig. 5B). The accuracy of classification of
severe case was also the highest when using HGF (Fig. 5C). Thus, HGF was ultimately
used as the biomarker to discriminate severe from nonsevere COVID-19 patients. The
sensitivity and specificity of HGF to classify severe patients were 84.6% and 97.9%,
respectively, with an AUC of 90.5% (Fig. 5D). The cutoff value of HGF determined by
the ROC curve was 1128 pg/ml. This result means that a COVID-19 patient with an
HGF concentration over 1128 pg/ml has a great possibility of being severely ill. This
cutoff classified falsely only 2 out of 97 nonsevere patients and 2 out of 13 severe
patients (Fig. 5E). In addition, HGF levels were not associated with age within different
groups (Fig. S4) and no significant correlation was found between the fluctuation
pattern of HGF and those of other cytokines (data not shown), indicating HGF is a
relatively independent factor.

CoV-2 infection, including healthy controls and asymptomatic infection, nonsevere and
severe COVID-19 patients, might be involved in the immune or inflammatory response
induced by the virus. In our first step of searching for such cytokines, we identified 10
in cross-sectional samples by using 2 statistical analyses. To narrow down candidates,
we dissected the correlations among these cytokines after noticing the fluctuation of
cytokines in the followed-up COVID-19 patients.
The fluctuation in cytokine levels observed cannot be explained by a variation in the
measurement. We assayed the sequential samples from a patient in one plate, and the
within-run CVs (in one plate) of all the cytokine controls were less than 10% (Fig. S1),
while the CV means of the 10 cytokines from the samples ranged from 15.5% to 56.4%.
Indeed, cytokine fluctuation was clearly observed in a previous study, which showed
that IL-6, IP-10, MCP-1 and IL-15 levels fluctuated significantly over several days in
subjects experimentally infected with influenza A virus [16]. During chronic hepatitis
B virus infection, some cytokine levels also fluctuate significantly over a span of
several months [17]. The fluctuation raises a problem regarding when to sample for a
cytokine assay since the concentrations of a specific cytokine may vary largely between
samples. This consideration led to our strategy to find cytokines with minimal
fluctuation. On the other hand, we speculate that the fluctuation might reflect to some
extent the change in the intensity of the immune response, and similar fluctuation
patterns might suggest that relevant cytokines might be modulated similarly. For
example, if cytokine A fluctuated with a pattern similar to that of cytokine B, this
correlation might mean that A and B were regulated by the same stimulus or that A
might be a stimulus or product of stimulation of B. Under this condition, picking A and
B simultaneously as biomarkers would be at least partially redundant. This
consideration led to our strategy to select one cytokine from one closely correlated
group (Fig. 2).
The effectiveness of our strategy can be exemplified by the selection of M-CSF. This
cytokine was clustered with IL-6 (Fig. 2B), indicating a relatively high correlation
between them. Recent reports showed that IL-6 was associated with the severity of
COVID-19 [10, 18]. According to our strategy, only 1 of the 2 cytokines would be

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.31.20118315; this version posted June 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

desirable to minimize redundancy. Further analysis showed that M-CSF fluctuated less
and classified different populations more accurately than IL-6 (Fig. 2), suggesting that
M-CSF should be a better choice than IL-6.
Guided by the 2 strategies, we finally narrowed down the candidate cytokines to 3, MCSF, IL-8 and SCF. A multiclass classification model constructed with these cytokines
accurately predicted 77.4% of people in the healthy control group and asymptomatic
and nonsevere groups for quasiindependent samples. However, this model was not
successful in predicting severe cases, with an accuracy of only 1.7%, indicating the
difficulty in finding cytokines that can discriminate the entire spectrum of COVID-19
simultaneously. We adjusted our strategy by screening for cytokines that showed
significant differences between nonsevere and severe patients. This effort resulted in a
single cytokine, HGF, which predicted severe patients with a significantly improved
accuracy (84.6% vs 1.7%). This finding is consistent with 2 recent studies showing that
the increase of HGF was associated with disease severity during COVID-19
progression [13, 14].
HGF is a potent antiinflammatory factor that ameliorates inflammation and dysfunction
in a wide variety of experimental animal models [19]. It inhibits inflammation by
interfering with proinflammatory NF-κB signaling [20, 21]. Considering its function,
the increase in HGF in severe COVID-19 must not be a reason for but rather a
consequence of excessive inflammation. Of note, HGF levels did not increase in
asymptomatic patients and even decreased in nonsevere patients compared with those
in healthy controls, suggesting that it might be unnecessary to upregulate HGF to
control a moderate inflammatory response (Fig. 6). This result explains why HGF was
ruled out from the candidate cytokines used to classify the 4 populations (Fig. 1).
Presumably, HGF might significantly increase only when inflammation mounts
toward an uncontrolled storm. If this is the case, HGF might be considered a curb of
the cytokine storm and a candidate treatment for critical COVID-19 patients. Indeed,
HGF treatment showed benefits for inflammatory bowel disease in an animal model
and has been used to attenuate the inflammatory response to spinal cord injury in a
clinical trial [22].

As suggested above, a covibration might imply a modulation relationship among
cytokines: either the cytokines could be modulated by the same regulators or the
cytokines could be regulators of the correlated cytokines. Interestingly, there was
evidence supporting this hypothesis: an experiment conducted in canine endothelial
cells demonstrated that M-CSF dose-dependently induced IP-10 mRNA expression,
consistent with our finding that M-CSF fluctuated with a high correlation to IP-10
(r=0.73, data not shown). This result implies the possibility that M-CSF could be a
modulator of IP-10 in the immune response. Statistically high correlations also existed
between M-CSF and IL-6 (r=0.79) and IFN-γ and IL-2Rα (r=0.73). It is interesting to
investigate whether a functional relationship exists between these pairs of cytokines.
A limitation of this study is that the sample size, especially that of severe patients, was
small, and no critical and fatal cases were included. The accuracy of the cytokine
biomarkers to classify populations with different states of SARS-CoV-2 infection needs
to be tested further in a large and totally independent population. In addition, since all
the cytokines were tested only when the patients had already been in corresponding
states, it is not known how these cytokine biomarkers would predict which patients
could develop severe illness.

Fig. S2. Some cytokines fluctuated with a similar pattern. The concentration of each
cytokine from each patient was normalized against that of the first sample, and the
fluctuation patterns were analyzed (A and B). C, Examples showing covibration in the
fluctuations of IL-6 and M-CSF during illness. These examples also demonstrate
generally higher amplitudes of fluctuation of IL-6 than those of M-CSF.
