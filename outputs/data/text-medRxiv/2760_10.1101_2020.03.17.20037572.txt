Abstract
Background: Recently, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak
started in Wuhan, China. Although the clinical features of COVID-19
have been reported previously, data regarding the risk factors associated
with the clinical outcomes are lacking.
Objectives: To summary and analyze the clinical characteristics and
identify the predictors of disease severity and mortality.
Methods: The PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, Embase,
Cochrane and MedRxiv databases were searched through February 25,
2020. Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE)
recommendations were followed. We extracted and pooled data using
random-e ects meta-analysis to summary the clinical feature of the
confirmed COVID-19 patients, and further identify risk factors for
disease severity and death. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I²
method and explained with subgroup analysis and meta-regression.
Results: A total of 30 studies including 53000 patients with COVID-19
were included in this study, the mean age was 49.8 years (95% CI,
47.5-52.2 yrs) and 55.5% were male. The pooled incidence of severity
and mortality were 20.2% (95% CI, 15.1-25.2%) and 3.1% (95% CI,
1.9-4.2%), respectively. The predictor for disease severity included old
age (≥ 50 yrs, odds ratio [OR] = 2.61; 95% CI, 2.29-2.98), male (OR
=1.348, 95% CI, 1.195-1.521), smoking (OR =1.734, 95% CI,

1.146-2.626) and any comorbidity (OR = 2.635, 95% CI, 2.098-3.309),
especially chronic kidney disease (CKD, OR = 6.017; 95% CI,
2.192-16.514), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, OR =
5.323; 95% CI, 2.613-10.847) and cerebrovascular disease (OR = 3.219;
95% CI, 1.486-6.972). In terms of laboratory results, increased lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer and
decreased blood platelet and lymphocytes count were highly associated
with severe COVID-19 (all for P < 0.001). Meanwhile, old age (≥ 60 yrs,
RR = 9.45; 95% CI, 8.09-11.04), followed by cardiovascular disease (RR
= 6.75; 95% CI, 5.40-8.43) hypertension (RR = 4.48; 95% CI, 3.69-5.45)
and diabetes (RR = 4.43; 95% CI, 3.49-5.61) were found to be
independent prognostic factors for the COVID-19 related death.
Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first evidence-based medicine
research to explore the risk factors of prognosis in patients with
COVID-19, which is helpful to identify early-stage patients with poor
prognosis and adapt effective treatment.

Introduction
Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that widely exist in nature and can
infect both humans and animals1. At present, there are six recognized
types of coronavirus that can cause infection in humans, leading to
pneumonia, injury in the digestive tracts, kidney failure and even death.
Two of the coronavirus family have been reported to cause deadly
infections including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)2,3. Recently, pneumonia
caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), also termed as
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in China’s
Wuhan City, Hubei Province in December 2019 and the disease spread
rapidly in China and even around the world4.
Compared with two other types of coronaviruses, the present new
coronavirus is spreading far more quickly and has higher contagiousness5.
As of March 17, 2020, a total of 187, 361 COVID-19 cases in 151
countries have been confirmed, which almost 22.2 times the number of
people infected by the SARS in 2003. Although COVID-19 has a
relatively low mortality rate, it can be highly deadly and lethal,
especially in high-risk patients6. The reported incidence of COVID-19
accompanied with underlying comorbidities in the literature were up to
26.0%, and most of them (65.3%) had cardiovascular and cerebrovascular
diseases. Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 who already have

underlying diseases were at increased the risk of severe illnesses and
death7.
And more worrying, there is no vaccine and specific treatment
available for this novel coronavirus as of now8. Therefore, it is necessary
to identify potential risk factors for predicting the disease progression
and severity for COVID-19. Meanwhile, early monitoring the predictive
indicators may also increase the efficiency of treatment and improve the
prognosis of COVID-19. Thus, the aim of our study is to perform a
systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical characteristics to explore
the risk factors of COVID-19-associated severe illness and death, and
first time to compare the differences of those predictors between
COVID-19, SARS and MERS.
Methods
Our study was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and
Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE)
reporting guidelines9,10. In eMethods in the Supplement, we describe the
detailed definitions of COVID-19 laboratory confirmed cases and severe
illness.

(Clarivate Analytics), and MedRxiv databases were used for searching
articles published until February 25, 2020 using the following keywords:
“coronavirus”, “nCoV”, “HCoV”, “Wuhan”, “2019” “SARS-CoV-2”,
“COVID*”, “NCP*”, “China”, “clinical”, “outcome”, “sever*”, “death”,
“fatali*” and “mortalit*” alone and in combination. Detailed search
strategies were presented in eMethods in the Supplement. After removing
duplicates, three reviewers (C.M. & J.G. & P. H) were assigned to
independently screen the titles and abstracts and then examine the full
text, and any questions with conflict were resolved by the senior authors
(P. L. and X. Z.). Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) any study that
gives information about the clinical characteristics or demographic or
outcome of the infectious disease, (2) restriction language to English only,
and (3) studies that allowed us to stratify the risk of severe or fatal
COVID-19 by demographic or medical condition were preferred.
Exclusion criteria were (1) data that could not be reliably extracted, (2)
editorials, comments, expert opinions, case reports or articles with
number of patients ≤ 10, (3) studies with special populations (eg, only
focused on family clusters or severe or death cases).
Data extraction and quality assessment
Two authors (C.M. and J.G.) independently extracted the data using a
predesigned spreadsheet, including author’s name, publication year, study
period, geographical region, study design, epidemiological information,

sample size, baseline and clinical characteristics, laboratory results,
severity and outcomes. For the study cohort divided according to disease
severity, data of all patients, severe and non-severe patients were
collected, respectively. For further meta-analysis, categorical variables
like sex, comorbidities, symptoms or endpoint events, number were dealt
with as dichotomous variables, while for continuous variables such as age,
laboratory results or timelines of illness, different types of measurement
including median (range) or median (IQR, interquartile range) were
transferred to the form of mean (SD, standard deviation)10.
Along with data extraction, study quality was assessed using the Quality
Assessment Forms recommended by Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality (AHRQ) for cross-sectional study (eMethods in supplement)11.
Conflicts on the assessments were resolved either by consensus or by the
adjudicator (P.L. and X. Z.).
Data analysis
Firstly, to obtain summary e ect estimate for each clinical variable,
including case severity rate (CSR), case fatality rate (CFR), male
proportion, mean age, pooled value of lymphocyte count and timeline of
COVID-19 confirmed patients, random e ects meta-analysis was used
because high variability between studies was expected. Heterogeneity
was evaluated using the I² statistic. Cut-off values of 25%, 50%, and 75%
indicated low, moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively12. We

visualized the results with forest plots. Secondly, to identify the risk
factors for severity, pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were
estimated with the dichotomous method, and mean difference (MD) with
95% CIs between severe and non-severe cases were calculated with
continuous method, Fixed effects model was used when I² < 50%, and
random effects models otherwise. Regarding the COVID-19 related death,
we conducted logistic regression model to calculate relative risks (RR)
with 95% CIs using the data of Chinese Center for Disease Control,
which included 44672 laboratory confirmed patients. Thirdly, to explore
potential sources of heterogeneity, we conducted subgroup analysis and
random-e ects meta-regression. Variables significant in univariable
meta-regression (P < 0.05) were included in multivariable
meta-regression. Next, sensitivity analyses were performed by
systematically removing each study in turn to explore its effect on
outcome13.
Finally, to investigate the risk of publication bias, we applied the
Begger test, Egger test and the test used by Peters et al and visually
inspected the funnel plots14. All analyses were performed using Review
Manager (version5.3), Stata (version 15) and R (version 3.5.3), RStudio
(version 1.2.1335) and Comprehensive Meta-analysis (version 3.3).

We identified 854 studies, of which 30 were eligible for our analysis
including 53,000 COVID-19 confirmed patients (Figure 1)1,7,15-38. All of
them were retrospective, observational studies (19 single-center and 11
multi-center studies), which were performed between December 2019
and February 19, 2020. The majority of studies were conducted in Wuhan
(13, 43.3%) and other cities in China (11, 36.7%), 2 from nationwide and
3 from other countries including United States, Australia and Korea. To
avoid any overlap of cases, the nationwide study of Chinese Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) including 44672 confirmed cases was only used
for identifying COVID-19 related death risk factors. The male to female
sex ratio was 1.25, with an overall average age of 49.8 years (95% CI,
47.5-52.2). Five studies included the information of COVID-19 infected
medical staff (Table 1).
Case Severity Rate and Case Fatality Rate
18 studies listed the number of severe cases, with pooled CSR 20.2% (95%
CI, 15.1-25.2%, n = 18, I2 = 92%). The proportion of severe illness in
Wuhan subgroup was higher than outside of Wuhan in China (36.9%; [95%
CI, 26.7-47.0%]; n = 7 vs. 10.9%; [95% CI, 6.7-15.1%]; n = 7, P <
0.001]). Of note, the overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 3.1% (95% CI,
1.9-4.2%, n = 23, I2 = 75%). Subgroup analysis showed a significantly
higher CFR in Wuhan than outside Wuhan (9.5%; [95% CI, 5.2-13.8%]; n
= 10 vs. 0.2%; [95% CI, 0-0.5%]; n = 8, P < 0.001) (Figure 1).

Univariate meta-regression showed that compared with Wuhan, CSR
and CFR in other areas were significantly lower (all for P < 0.0001),
which was consistent with the subgroup analysis. Although not
statistically significant, CSR and CFR showed a decreasing trend over
time. In addition, onset-to-admission time were identified closely
correlation with CSR (4.99% per increase in days, P = 0.0047) and CFR
(1.97% per increase in days, P < 0.0001), suggesting shortening the

outcomes.

Multivariate meta-regression confirmed the close correlation between
onset-to-admission time and CFR (1.27% per increase in days, P =
0.0263). (Table 2 and Figure 3).
Clinical characteristics and laboratory results
Clinical and laboratory data from 26 studies, including 1374 severe and
4326 non-severe patients, were extracted for meta-analysis. Of this, 7.7%
patients (95% CI, 3.6-11.8%) were medical staff. The pooled CFR of
severe patients was significantly higher than non-severe patients (6.0%;
[95% CI, 4.6-7.3%] vs. 0.1%; [95% CI, 0-0.2%], P < 0.001). The mean
incubation period was 7.10 days (95% CI, 6.06-8.14 d), with no
statistically difference between severe and non-severe cases. The mean
time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 6.18 days (95% CI,
5.23-7.12 d), which is longer in severe cases than that in non-severe cases
(6.56 d vs. 4.81d, P = 0.023) and in Wuhan than outside (7.23 d vs.4.86 d,

Severe cases presented with older age (54.5 yrs; [95% CI, 55.5-61.4 yrs]
vs. 44.5 yrs; [95% CI, 42.0-47.1 yrs], P < 0.001) and higher ratio of male
(59.7%; [95% CI, 55.0-64.3%] vs. 51.9; [95% CI, 46.6-57.2%], P <
0.001), as compared with non-severe cases. Similarly, patients in Wuhan
were older than those outside Wuhan (55.7 yrs vs. 41.6 yrs, P < 0.001).
Fever (79.1%; 95% CI, 68.0-90.3%), cough (58.0%; 95% CI, 42.0-74.0%)
and fatigue (29.3%; 95% CI, 23.4-35.3%) were the dominant symptoms,
whereas digestive symptoms such as diarrhea (5.7%; 95%CI 3.9-7.5%),
nausea or vomiting (2.0%; 95% CI, 1.0-2.9%) were relatively rare. The
overall prevalence of any comorbidity was 37.1% (95% CI, 28.1-46.1%),
with higher incidence rate in severe cases than non-severe cases (54.9%
vs. 27.6%, P = 0.006), and higher in Wuhan than other areas (45.1% vs.
28.8%, P = 0.01). The most common comorbidities were hypertension
(19.0%, 95% CI, 13.2-24.9%), followed by diabetes (8.2%, 95% CI,
6.3-10.0%) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD, 2.7%, 95% CI, 1.4-4.1%).
Moreover, hypertension, diabetes, CVD, cerebrovascular diseases,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic kidney
disease (CKD) were significantly more common in severe cases as
compared with non-severe cases (all for P < 0.05). The overall proportion
of bilateral radiologic abnormalities was 87.2% (95% CI, 82.1-92.3%),
with significant difference between inside and outside Wuhan (91.6% vs.

82.6%, P = 0.018).
In terms of the laboratory index, several elevated indicators were
observed as follows: C-reaction protein (CRP, 26.07 mg/L; 95% CI,
20.69-31.44 mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, 46.54 mm/h; 95%
CI, 33.31-59.78 mm/h), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, 287.48 U/L; 95%
CI, 260.76-314.20 U/L), cardiac troponin I (cTnI, 4.54 pg/mL,; 95% CI,
-1.17-10.24 pg/mL) and ferritin (724.44 ng/mL; 95%CI, 356.28-1092.60
ng/mL). In contrast, the level albumin (37.31 g/L; 95% CI, 34.33-40.28
g/L) and lymphocytes count (1.18 × 10 /L; 95% CI, 1.00-1.36 × 10 /L)
were below normal level. Of note, obvious differences in laboratory index
were identified between severe and non-severe cases, as well as between
Wuhan and outside Wuhan. Elevated level of CRP, LDH and D-dimer,
together with reduced level of lymphocytes count and PLT count were the
prominent features of severe cases (all for P < 0.001). Likewise, more
elevated CRP, myoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and ferritin,
followed by decreased lymphocyte count and hemoglobin were observed
in Wuhan patients than outside (all for P < 0.001) (Table 2).
Risk factors for severity of COVID-19
Among the baseline characteristics, disease severity was highly
associated with old age (≥ 50 yrs, OR = 2.609; 95% CI, 2.288-2.976; n =
5; I2 = 37%), male (OR =1.348; 95% CI, 1.195-1.521; n = 13; I2 = 0%),
smoking (OR =1.734; 95% CI, 1.146-2.626; n = 4; I2 = 0%) and any

comorbidity (OR = 2.635; 95% CI, 2.098-3.309; n = 7; I2 = 12%).
Comorbidities with pooled OR larger than 2 included CKD (6.02; 95% CI,
2.19-16.51; n = 4; I2 = 0), COPD (5.32; 95% CI, 2.61-10.85; n = 6; I2 =
0%), cerebrovascular diseases (3.19; 95% CI, 1.51-6.77; n = 6; I2 = 0%),
tumor (3.21; 95% CI, 1.42-7.24; n = 4; I2 = 30%), diabetes (2.49; 95% CI,
1.82-3.4; n = 10; I2 = 44%) and hypertension (2.06; 95% CI, 1.61-2.62; n
= 10; I2 = 36%) (Figure 4, eFigure 5).
In terms of laboratory results, there were obvious difference between
severe and non-severe cases in PLT (MD = -30.654

n = 7) and CRP (MD = 30.395 mg/L, 95% CI, 20.006 to 40.784, n = 10).
Meanwhile, the ORs were calculated for several index including
lymphocytopenia (OR = 4.23; 95% CI, 3.03-6.03; I2 = 33%),
thrombocytopenia (OR = 2.84; 95% CI, 2.00-4.04; I2 = 49%), elevated
D-dimer (OR = 3.17; 95% CI, 1.86-5.41; I2 = 69%) and elevated CRP
(OR = 4.23; 95% CI, 2.94-6.08; I2 = 25%). (Figure 5, eFigure 6-7).
Comparison of Clinical Characteristics and risk factors among
COVID-19, SARS and MERS

MERS (68.0%), while hypertension for COVID-19 (19.0%). Fever and
cough were the dominant symptoms for all three viruses, whereas
digestive symptoms and chill were relatively rare for COVID-19.
Regarding laboratory index, elevated LDH was common for three
coronaviruses; higher incidence of lymphopenia, elevated AST or ALT
was observed in COVID-19 and SARS than MERS39,40. (Table 4).
Both old age and comorbidity proved the common risk factors for
predicting death among three coronaviruses. In support, COVID-19
related death was associated with old age ( ≥ 60 yrs, RR = 9.45; 95% CI,
8.09-11.04), male (RR = 1.67, 95% CI, 1.47-1.89) and any comorbidity
(5.86; 95% CI, 4.77-7.19), most notably CVD (6.75; 95% CI, 5.40-8.43)
followed by hypertension (4.48; 95% CI, 3.69-5.45) and diabetes (4.43;
95% CI, 3.49-5.61). Similar with COVID-19, male (RR = 1.6; 95% CI,
1.2-2.1) and CVD (OR = 3.5; 95% CI, 3.1-4.8) were also risk factors for
MERS related death41,42. In contrast, the most predominant risk factor for
SARS related death was CKD (9.02; 95% CI, 3.81-21.36), and the risk of
male gender was not statistically significant3,43,44. In addition, medical
staff had a lower fatality rate than non-clinical staff for COVID-19 (RR =
0.12; 95% CI, 0.05-0.30) and MERS (RR = 0.1; 95% CI, 0.02-0.20),
whereas the difference was not significant for SARS (RR = 0.76; 95% CI,
0.52-1.15). (Table 5).

Leaving each trial out of the analysis one at a time revealed no
meaningful differences in CSR and CFR (eFigure 8 in supplement). We
observed no evidence of publication bias with inspection of the funnel
plot or with the Begger test or the test used by Peters et al (eFigure 9 in
supplement).
Discussion
The main findings of this present analysis are that: (1) Despite the high
incidence rate, the distinctive feature of COVID-19 was low severity and
mortality, showing a significant difference on the incidence of severity
and mortality between Wuhan and outside of Wuhan; (2) The
onset-to-admission time was closely related to mortality, which will be
increased about 1.27% with every day of delay in admission; (3) Older
age is a common risk factor for poor prognosis of the three coronavirus
diseases; Hypertension and cardiovascular diseases are the most relevant
clinical predictors for the death caused by both COVID-19 and
MERS-CoV, while chronic kidney disease is for SARS; (4) The five main
laboratory indicators of severe illness included lymphocytopenia,
thrombocytopenia and the rise of LDH, CRP and D-dimer.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be higher contagious than
previously discovered human coronaviruses45. Until now, more than 187,
361 confirmed cases and caused 7, 485 deaths in 151 countries on six
continents were identified. Despite its high prevalence of COVID-19, the

pooled severe incidence and fatality rate is significantly lower compared
with SARS and MERS, which may explain why the novel coronavirus
has spread so widely46. Of note, there are regional and spatial differences
in the incidence rate of COVID-19. In our research, the pooled severity
rate and mortality caused by COVID-19 was found significantly higher in
Wuhan than that of the infected outside of Wuhan (all for P < 0.01). On
the other hand, disease incidence at the early stage of outbreak was higher
than that at the late stage, which may be caused by the lack of
recognitions and treatment experience for COVID-19. Moreover, the
longer time from symptoms to hospitalization, the higher incidence rate
of the mortality related to COVID-19, highlighting the importance of
timely medical treatment30. In addition, among the patients with
2019-nCoV, the pooled infection rate of medical staff was 7.7%, which
was lower than that of SARS (23%) and MERS (9.8%)39.
SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV belong to
high pathogenic coronaviruses, whereas each of which has its own
clinical manifestation. In comparison to SARS-CoV (4.6 days)
and MERS-CoV (5.2 days)47, COVID-19 has a longer latent period (7.1
days) and the initial manifestations are non-specific, making it more
difficult to prevent and control at early stage. Similar to
SARS and MERS, persons with COVID-19 often present initially with
lower respiratory signs, including fever, coughing and fatigue. In the late

course of illnesses, infected persons are characterized by progressive
breathing difficulty, tachypnea, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or
life-threatening complications. In fact, SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated
from respiratory secretions, feces, urine, blood, tears, and conjunctival
secretions48, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 infection is not confined to the
respiratory tract. Indeed, in our analysis, the pooled incidences rate of
respiratory symptom was present in 79.1% of patients, followed by 7.7%
with gastrointestinal disorders and 6.1% with neurological symptoms.
Therefore, the patients with COVID-19 whose initial symptom were out
of the lung should also be paid more attention, especially for those with
the contact history of COVID-19. It should be noted that the pooled
incidence of diarrhea symptoms (5.7%) is lower than previous data of
patients with MERS-CoV (25%) or SARS-CoV (26%) infection. In terms
of laboratory tests, the most common hematological abnormalities in
patients with COVID-19 were lymphopenia (54.7%), suggesting
aggressive effect on lymphocytes by COVID-19, which is similar to those
previously observed in patients with SARS (68-85%). In addition,
elevated levels of liver enzymes, LDH, myocardial enzymes, and
depressed platelet count concomitant with the rise of D-dimer was
observed in our study. Compare with MERS (36%) and SARS (45%),
thrombocytopenia was relatively less frequent in patients infected with
SARS-CoV-2 (12.8%)39,47.

Given the fact that the rapid progression to end-organ failure and even
death was occurred in some patients, it is therefore essential to paid more
attention to susceptible population of COVID-1949. Our results showed
the majority of the SARS-CoV-2 infection were male patients (55.5%)
similarly to the gender distribution of MERS (64.5%), while the
predominance of female patients (43.0%) was observed in SARS. It is
believed that the sex difference is probably related to the higher
expression of ACE2 receptor in male than that in female and the lack of
the protection of estrogen and X chromosome50. COVID-19 has affected
persons in all age groups; in particular, 53.5% patients were found after
more than 50 years, suggesting that the elderly patients are more likely to
have weak immune function. Moreover, 10-30% of patients in SARS and
37.1% of patients in COVID-19 had at least one underlying disorder;
patients with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular
diseases, renal failure and chronic respiratory diseases are especially
vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection7. Owning to the pro-inflammatory
state and the reduced immune response, the chronic conditions were also
noted to have similar effects in the other two coronaviruses. Although the
comorbidities identified in our study has been described previously, their
value to predict the severity of COVID-19 has not yet been evaluated.
A focus on risk factor affecting clinical outcome is critically
important to identify high-risk patients and mitigate COVID-19

complications. In the present study, people with old age, male, smoking,
presence of comorbidity, CKD, COPD, cancer, hypertension, and
diabetes were identified as predictors of severe disease from COVID-19
infection. Importantly, old age, male gender and presence of comorbidity,
including hypertension, diabetes, cancer and respiratory disease, were
identified predictor of disease severity as well as mortality related to
COVID-19, suggesting that elderly patients with these underlying
comorbidities should be given more attention and care. In line with
previously published studies, the laboratory indicators including
lymphocytes, CRP, LDL, PLT, D-dimer, ALT and CK levels were
closely related to a poor prognosis, which provided key reference index
of the prognosis of COVID-19. In particular, lymphopenia,
thrombocytopenia and elevated D-dimer could act as effective predictors
of the COVID-19 severity. However, it was worth noting that increased
level of myoglobin and ferritin were observed in severe cases, but the
predictive value could not be estimated limited by the number of related
studies and further in-depth research is needed.
Limitation
Our meta-analysis has several potential limitations. Firstly, there was
obvious heterogeneity among studies regarding CSR and its subgroups,
because of differences in medical condition, study period, public

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.17.20037572; this version posted March 20, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

awareness and others. Nevertheless, we conducted meta-regression based
on the observation duration and symptom onset to hospital admission
time, which explained a large percent of heterogeneity. Secondly, studies
published before February 25, 2020 and articles published in English only
were included in our study, therefore there was lack of data from other
countries. However, our meta-analysis involved 53000 confirmed patients
based on the data during the early-to-mid period of disease outbreak in
China, which will provide great referential value for global epidemic
control. Thirdly, meta-analysis was conducted on the level of the studies
and the characteristics of individual patients could not be retrieved, thus it
was hard to provide reference for individualized diagnosis and treatment
of COVID-19. Finally, all included studies were retrospective, as no
randomized control trials and prospective studies related to 2019-nCoV
finish till now, thus our results require to be confirmed by more
high-quality clinical researches.
Conclusions:
COVID-19 is emerging all over the world and spreading at an
unprecedented rate, resulting in significant impacts on global economies

and public health. The present study successfully and systematically
evaluated the prognostic predictors of COVID-19 by collecting published
information on risk factors of the outcomes related to SARS-CoV-2
infections. Nevertheless, more investigations are needed to further
