Abstract
In the Czech Republic, the first COVID-19 cases were confirmed on 1 March 2020; early population
interventions were adopted in the following weeks. A simple epidemiological model was developed to
help decision-makers understand the course of the epidemic and perform short-term predictions. In this
paper, we present the use of the model and estimated changes in the reproduction number (decrease
from > 2.00 to < 1.00 over March and April) following adopted interventions.

INTRODUCTION
More than 27 million of COVID-19 cases and over 800 thousand deaths have been reported globally so
far.[1] Population interventions including restrictions limiting public gatherings and social contact have
proved crucial in the fight against COVID-19.[2] In the Czech Republic, first COVID-19 cases were
confirmed on 1 March 2020. A series of early measures was adopted over the following weeks in
accordance with the Public Health Protection Act and the Act on the Security of the Czech Republic
(Table 1), leading to rather favourable results after the first wave of epidemic (87 cases and 3 deaths per
100,000 population at the end of May, compared to 269 cases and 32 deaths per 100,000 population in
the entire EU/EEA and UK).[3]
A simple epidemiological model was developed at the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of
the Czech Republic to help decision-makers understand the course of the epidemics including an
estimation of the effective reproduction number,[4] and to facilitate short-term predictions. In this paper,
we present results of COVID-19 epidemic modelling in a series of six model editions used by decision
makers and published in weekly intervals during the first wave of epidemic in late March and April, and
estimate the change of the effective reproduction number following the implementation of restrictive
measures.

DESCRIPTION OF THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MODEL USED
In the Czech Republic, only selected laboratories are allowed to perform testing. Test results are then,
with minimum delay, reported to the central Information System of Infectious Diseases (ISID), and
subsequently validated by the respective regional public health authority. Therefore, ISID allows us to
quickly obtain and analyse key data for evaluation of the course of epidemics and to publicly share the
current status.[5] Data on basic epidemiological characteristics (cumulative confirmed cases, active
cases,

incidence,

etc.)

are

available

as

(on-line

aktualne.mzcr.cz/api/v2/covid-19).
We developed an original epidemiological model, maintaining the simplicity of statistical models while
also considering the mechanics of transmission, which allowed us to better understand the course of the
epidemics and to produce more realistic predictions.[6] Our model uses classical S(E)IR approach[7, 8]
with the following compartments: S (susceptible), I (infected, set of compartments), Rsubcl (subclinical
cases) and R (removed, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases; see Figure 1).

Individuals identified as cases imported from abroad as well as individuals infected within the
community (in line with the estimated reproduction number) enter the state I1. They stay in the individual
compartments I1 to I7 always for one day. Individuals in states I4 to I7 can infect others, the number of
newly infected individuals depends on the reproduction number. To be able to consider the testing
effectiveness (i.e. the delay between referring the patient for testing and the availability of test results),
the average length of stay in the I8+ compartment was calibrated to the ISID data. For simplicity, it was
assumed that the isolation or end of patients’ infectiousness always comes on the second day after the
onset of symptoms, limiting further patient’s infectiousness. In line with the general testing policy
applicable in the Czech Republic in the respective time period, testing was assumed only in symptomatic

actual parameter values from the model edition from 30/4; for the period between 22/3 and 31/3, the
parameter value was linearly interpolated

Values of selected parameters were calibrated to available ISID data, namely to the cumulative number
of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Sum of squares was the metric used for the description of the goodness
of fit; except for the first edition, where the manual parameter search was used, the parameter values
were derived using the random search method; details are given in the Supplement S1. 5-10% of the
best fitting simulations were utilised for parameter estimation (later model editions used 5%). Of these
simulations, subset of simulations predicting the highest numbers of cases (see Table 3 for details on the
size of these subsets) were used in the early predictions as a precautionary approach. Parameter values
were estimated as means of parameter values from those accepted simulations; the reproduction number
was also estimated with standard deviations to allow estimation of an indicative 95% confidence
interval. The 95% confidence interval bands were subsequently applied as reproduction number values
on the recent (retrospective) and on the near future (prospective) period for estimating of a ‘sensitivity
interval’, i.e., the predicted interval of the potential numbers of cases at individual target dates (Table
3). Calculations were performed in Microsoft Excel.

APPLICATION OF THE MODEL
The results of the first model edition were published on 24 March 2020 and predicted a sharp increase
till the end of March (more than 3 thousand of cases, compared to 1,047 cases observed on 21 March,
Table 3). The real (observed) number of cases indeed exceeded 3 thousand on 30 March.
The basic reproduction number for Czech population was estimated to be 2.64, with a partial decline
since 12 March (1.84), reflecting the introduction of the state of emergency and the first nationwide
restrictive measures (Table 1). The reproduction number following the broader restrictive measures
since 16 March was assumed to be 1.2. In reality, the effect of the restrictive measures was even more
dramatic, which lead to a substantial overestimation of the number of cases predicted for the end of
April.
Further estimates of the reproduction number lead to downward corrections (1.00 since 16 March,
following the restriction of free movement, Table 1). The model edition from 23 April allowed us to
estimate a further decrease of the reproduction number since early April (0.74, 95% confidence interval
0.53-0.96). This trend of the declining reproduction number following implemented restrictions is
similar to recently published results from Italy.[12]
These data allowed an improved prediction of 7,759 cases at the end of April (sensitivity interval 7,370
– 8,250), which eventually lead to only a slight overestimation of the real observed figure (7,682
confirmed COVID-19 cases). The model published at the end of April predicted 8,484 COVID-19 cases
at the end of May, suggesting a controlled course of the epidemic following interventions enacted in
March by the Czech government (Table 3). The model and its assumed parameter values underestimated
the values observed at the end of May (Table 3, Supplementary Figure S2), which implies a minor
increase of the reproductive number in May, following the alleviation of interventions in late April and
May.
The basic reproduction number of COVID-19 was previously estimated to be 2.2-3.6.[13, 14] Our
simple mechanistic model was able to estimate a similar value. When interpreting the results of the
model, we need to bear in mind the substantial parameter and structural uncertainty. In particular,
published estimates of the periods of incubation and infectiousness differ among studies (e.g.[9, 15, 16];
we, therefore, needed to assume their values (Table 2) and apply them in the model structure. The values
we assumed were consistent with previously published estimates of the serial interval of 4-5 days
(e.g.[10]). Besides, substantial uncertainty exists around the proportion of subclinical cases.
Nevertheless, the use of an alternative proportion of subclinical cases (i.e., 30% as suggested by
Nishihura[17] instead of 10% used originally in our model) did not lead to a substantial change of the
prediction during the period of controlled epidemic (7831 vs. 7759 predicted for the end of April using
the model published on 23 April). Any new restrictions/alleviations following the prediction represent
another important source of uncertainty, as well as the epidemic course under different climatic

conditions. Indeed, the model has shown a satisfactory predictive validity; however, great uncertainty is
associated with the future values of the reproduction number, which is to a great degree affected by
adopted policies and the compliance of the target population.

CONCLUSION
The described model allowed us to analyse the course of the epidemic, including the estimation of the
basic reproduction number, and to perform useful short-term predictions, which facilitated the
estimation of the necessary readiness of the healthcare system in the days and weeks after the prediction.
The comparison of the predicted and observed numbers of cases is incorporated in the early warning
system, which is currently used by policy-makers both on the national and regional levels. The Czech
data on COVID-19 epidemic have also demonstrated the potential of early implementation of
government measures in slowing the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic.
