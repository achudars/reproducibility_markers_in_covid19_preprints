Abstract

A recent genome-wide association study of European ancestry has identified 3p21.31 and
9q34.2 (ABO gene) to be significantly associated with COVID-19 respiratory failure (1). Here,
we employed the detailed clinical, immunological and multi-omics data of the Human
Functional Genomics Projects (HFGP) to explore the physiological significance of the host
genetic variants that influence susceptibility to severe COVID-19. A functional genomics
investigation based on functional characterization of individuals with high genetic risk for
severe COVID-19 susceptibility identified several major patterns: i. a large impact of
genetically determined innate immune responses in COVID-19, with increased susceptibility
for severe disease in individuals with defective monocyte-derived cytokine production; ii.
genetic susceptibility related to ABO blood groups is probably mediated through the von
Willebrand factor (VWF) and endothelial dysfunction; and iii. the increased susceptibility for
severe COVID-19 in men is at least partially mediated by chromosome X-mediated genetic
variation. These insights allow a physiological understanding of genetic susceptibility to severe
COVID-19, and indicate pathways that could be targeted for prevention and therapy.

Introduction
The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (2)(3), firstly emerged in late December 2019 and has
been spreading worldwide very quickly. The COVID-19 pandemic creates a severe disruption
to the healthcare system and endangers the economy. As of the 21st of October, the World
Health Organization has reported more than 40 million confirmed cases and over 1 million
confirmed deaths (4). While much has been learned about the pathophysiology of the disease,
treatment proven to be effective is restricted to dexamethasone (5), and there is no effective
vaccine for COVID-19 yet. Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand the exact
host-pathogen interactions leading to increased severity and mortality, in order to design
additional prophylactic and therapeutic strategies in future (6)(7).

The severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is highly variable, and ranges from asymptomatic to
mild disease, and even to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome with a fatal outcome
(8). However, the causes for this broad variability in disease outcome between individuals are
largely unknown. A recent study indicates that human host factors rather than viral genetic
variation affect COVID-19 severity outcome (9). Additionally, clinical and epidemiological
data have shown that old age, male sex, and chronic comorbidity are associated with higher
mortality (10)(11). A recent genome-wide association study in individuals with genetic
European ancestry has identified several chemokine receptor genes, including CCR9, CXCR6
and XCR1 and the locus controlling the ABO blood type to be associated with severe symptoms
of COVID-19 (1). Nevertheless, little is known about the mechanisms through which these
genetic variants influence COVID-19 severity. For example, several competing hypotheses
may be envisaged for the involvement of immune genes in susceptibility to severe COVID-19:
on the one hand, it may be hypothesized that genetic risk for severe COVID-19 is associated

hyperinflammation and poor outcome. A purely genetic study cannot respond to this crucial
question, that would have important consequences for the approach to prophylaxis and therapy.

By making use of resources from the Human Functional Genomics Project (HFGP) (12, 13),
we assessed the impact of COVID-19 associated genetic polymorphisms on variability of
immune responses at the population level. This study will help us to understand how genetic
variability is related to disease susceptibility through the regulation of immune responses and
endothelial function.

Results
This study was conducted in two Dutch cohorts of healthy volunteers from HFGP: 451
participants from the 500 Functional Genomics (500FG) cohort (12, 13), and 313 volunteers
from the 300 Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (300BCG) cohort (14). The basic characteristics of
study populations are shown in Table S1.

COVID-19 loci are enriched for expression in immune organs, chemokine signaling
pathways and enhancer region
To explore the functional impact of the identified COVID-19 loci, we firstly investigated if the
identified independent genetic loci (<1´10-5) associated with severe COVID-19 are associated
with any phenotypes available at the GWAS catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/). We found
that many of these loci are associated with immune traits such as blood protein, LDL and VLDL
concentrations (Table S2). We next performed functional annotation of significant loci and

gene-mapping using FUMA(15). The SNP2GENE function identified 32 independent SNPs
located in 26 different loci which reached suggestive significance in this study (p-value <1´105

, Table S3). Using multiple independent expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) datasets,

FUMA mapped 115 genes to these 26 genomic risk loci. Using RNA-seq data of 30 tissues
from GTEx database (v8), we found significant enrichment of candidate genes in expression
in immune organs such as spleen and blood (Fig.1A), suggesting that they are important tissues
contributing to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 (16)(17). Moreover, we observed the
enrichment of candidate genes to be mainly expressed in small intestine and lung (Fig. 1A),
suggesting that COVID-19 represents a multisystem illness with involvement of different
organs, consistent with the respiratory and intestinal symptoms of the disease (18).

Pathway analysis using these 115 genes showed a strong enrichment in chemokine binding and
chemokine receptors binding (Fig. 1B), which is in line with the fact that chemokines can
recruit immune cells to the site of infection and are critical for the function of the immune
response (19). In addition, chemokines have been reported as the most significantly elevated
biomarkers in patients with severe COVID-19 on the intensive care unit (17).

Considering that all SNPs in LD with the 32 independent loci (p-value <1´10-5) identified by
the COVID-19 GWAS, were significantly enriched in the non-coding intronic region (p value
= 0.036, Fisher's exact test) (Table S4), we next examined whether the COVID-19 associated
variants are enriched in regulatory DNA elements. We interrogated all significant SNPs (pvalue<1´10-5 and stricter thresholds) with histone marks and chromatin states of 24 blood celltypes in the Roadmap Epigenome Project (20). We found that the COVID-19 genetic loci were
strongly enriched for enhancer markers and weakly enriched in promoter marker (Table S5).
The strong enrichment of COVID-19 loci in enhancer marks indicates that the associated

genetic variants are likely to be involved in the regulation of immunologically related functions.
This finding also suggests that epigenetic mechanisms may play an important role in the
pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection.

3p21.31 loci are associated with lower production of monocyte-derived cytokines
Severe COVID-19 is characterized by complex immune dysregulation, combining immune
defective features with hyperinflammatory innate immune traits (21)(22). However, these
analyses in patients could be done only late during the disease, and whether genetic risk for
severe COVID-19 is characterized by low or high innate immune responses in a non-infected
person is not known. We therefore used the cytokine QTL data from the 500FG cohort (13) of
the HFGP to test whether SNPs in 3p21.31 influence cytokine production upon stimulation.
We checked all SNPs located within a 50 kilobase window of top variant rs11385942, and
showed all nominal significant associations (p-value < 0.05, Fig. 2A). Interestingly, we
observed that the risk alleles for a severe course of COVID-19 are consistently associated with
lower production of monocyte-dependent cytokines (IL-6, IL-1b and TNF-α) upon various invitro stimulations (Fig. 2A). Of note, COVID-19 risk alleles also correspond to lower
monocyte-derived cytokine production after influenza stimulation, a viral stimulus(Fig. 2A and
B). It is thus tempting to speculate that the people who carry risk alleles may not respond
properly to an initial virus infection, leading to high viral loads, subsequent systemic
inflammation and poor outcome. Next, we tested whether the COVID-19 risk SNPs are
associated with the levels of circulating cytokines in blood. Using the same cohort, we found
that IL-18 and IL-18BP show a suggestive positive association with genetic risk of COVID-19
(Fig. S1).

Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and lymphocytes are strongly colocalized with ABO loci

It is known that ABO blood group influences the plasma levels of von Willebrand factor
(VWF)(23) and elevated VWF levels are associated with severe COVID-19 (24). We therefore
tested the association of ABO locus with VWF circulating concentrations from the individuals
in the 500FG cohort. Of note, we found the risk allele rs687621-G is significantly associated
with elevated levels of VWF (p-value = 9.58´10-20) (Fig. 3A and B). Recent studies have
reported that the VWF level is highly related to COVID-19 severity (25, 26). As VWF level in
plasma is an indicator of inflammation, endothelial activation and damage (27), our results
suggest that the association of VWF and COVID-19 severity is very likely mediated through
genetic regulation.

We next tested if this specific locus is associated with immune functions. Interestingly, we
observed consistent negative correlation of VWF and T-cell derived cytokine production in
response to various ex-vivo stimulations (Fig. 3C and Fig. S2). In addition, the ABO locus led
by the variant rs687621 also showed statistically significant co-localization with several
immune-mediated traits, including cell counts of lymphocytes (Coloc analysis H4: 0.98),
monocytes (Coloc analysis H4: 1), neutrophils (Coloc analysis H4: 0.8) and whole blood cells
(Coloc analysis H4: 1) (Fig. 3D).

Men have a higher genetic severity risk of COVID-19 than women
Polygenic risk scores (PRS) combine multiple risk alleles and capture an individual’s load of
common genetic variants associated with a disease phenotype (28). Using the summary
statistics provided in the GWAS study (1), we calculated the PRS for the samples from 500FG
and 300BCG cohorts. Since higher mortality of COVID-19 has been reported to be associated
with male sex and BMI (10, 11), we investigated whether these host factors are associated with
the PRS, a predictive measure of risk for development of severe COVID-19.

We firstly assessed if males have a higher genetic risk compared to females in 500FG. Hereby,
we defined people with top 10% PRS as a high-risk group and those with bottom 10% PRS as
a low-risk group. As shown in Fig. 4A, male tend to have higher severe COVID-19 risk than
female (odd ratio: 1.47, 95% CI: 0.98-2.22, p-value = 0.045 (Fisher’s exact test)) (Table S6).
We next used different percentile cut-offs (15%, 20%, 25% and 30%) to re-define low and
high-risk groups. Interestingly, we observed a consistent pattern that males have higher genetic
risk (PRS) than females at different percentile cut-offs. These results can be replicated in a
similar, but independent, cohort (300BCG, Fig. 4B). Meanwhile, the genetic risk difference
between male and female can be attenuated when a loose cut-off has been defined. The metaanalysis of two cohorts showed a significant p-value at various percentile cut-offs (10%, 15%,
20%, 25%) and marginal significant p-value of 0.051 at the percentile cut-off of 30%.
Furthermore, this result persisted when PRS was computed using summary statistics from the
GWAS model after age and sex correction, reported in the original GWAS study (Table S7).
When computing PRS while excluding variants from the X and Y chromosomes, the
enrichment of men in the higher PRS group was less pronounced at most thresholds (Fig. 4C
and D). This suggested that higher genetic severity risk at least partially originates from the
SNPs in the sex chromosomes.

As obesity or overweight has been reported as a risk factor for serious illness or death
from COVID-19, we tested if the PRS is associated with BMI (Fig. S3). We did not observe
any significant correlation between PRS and BMI.

Understanding the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is urgently needed for designing novel
preventive and therapeutic approaches against the disease. One important tool for identifying
the most important mechanisms mediating a disease is genomics: genetic variants that
influence susceptibility or severity to a disease are usually located in genetic loci that impact
important mechanisms for that particular disease. Using the information of a recently published
GWAS assessing the severity of COVID-19 (1), and the rich datasets available in the HFGP,
we interrogated the mechanisms through which genetic variants associated with severe
COVID-19 exert their effects.

Among the genetic loci associated with severe COVID-19, the 3p21.31 gene cluster has been
well replicated by independent studies from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative
(https://www.covid19hg.org), and it was reported to be inherited by Neanderthals (29). This
locus is currently regarded as a marker of COVID-19 severity, but crucial information is
missing: are the risk alleles in this locus (that encode several cytokines and chemokines)
associated with a lower or higher cytokine production. The answer to this question is crucial
for understanding COVID-19: a genetic risk associated with low cytokine production would
imply that severe COVID-19 is the consequence of a relative immunodeficiency, while a high
cytokine production associated with genetic risk would mean that severe COVID-19 is a
genetic hyperinflammatory disease. In our study, the 3p21.31 genetic polymorphisms
associated with a high risk of severe COVID-19 were associated with lower production of
monocyte-derived cytokines, especially to viral (influenza) stimuli. This important discovery
has significant prophylactic and therapeutic consequences. On the one hand, it implies that
improvement of innate immune responses in healthy individuals would decrease the probability
that they undergo a severe form of COVID-19: this supports the rationale of clinical trials that
improve innate immune responses through induction of trained immunity, e.g. by vaccination

with BCG (6). On the other hand, this also implies that the dysregulated immune responses that
have been described at late time points in patients with severe COVID-19 (30)(31) are likely
the consequence of accelerated viral multiplication due to defective innate immune responses,
and subsequent systemic inflammation due to high viral loads.

Several studies have shown that ABO blood types are associated with COVID-19 severity
(32)(33) and susceptibility (34)(35)(36). It is still not well-known how ABO gene regulates
COVID-19 susceptibility. As ABO blood group are also expressed on endothelial cells and
platelets, it has been speculated that this effect may manifest itself via elevated plasma VWF
(37). Our results provide evidence supporting this hypothesis, by showing that the risk alleles
in the ABO locus are associated with high concentrations of VWF. Moreover, interesting
associations have been found between polymorphisms in this locus and the number of various
immune cell populations, especially lymphocytes, since lymphopenia is also consistently
associated with severe COVID-19 (38). This suggests that genetic factors are relevant to the
host thrombo-inflammatory response. However, a note of caution should be mentioned , as the
association between the genetics of ABO group with severity in COVID-19 Host Genetics
Initiative data did not reach a genome-wide level of significance (p value <5´10-8) (Table S8)
(as of 21st of October 2020, and thus the association might be population specific.

Another important observation is that an important component of the impact of genetic
polymorphisms on the severity of COVID-19 is mediated through sex chromosomes, most
likely chromosome X which is known to encode many genes related to the immune system.
Indeed, men in both 500FG and 300BCG cohorts had a higher genetic risk then women, and
this difference was largely lost when sex chromosomes were excluded from the analysis. These
data strongly argue that at least part of the well-known increase of COVID-19 severity in men

is genetically determined. The recent description by our group of rare mutations in the RNA
receptor TLR7 located on chromosome X as a cause of very severe COVID-19 in young men
supports this hypothesis (39).

While our study sheds further light on how COVID-19 genetic risk affects the human immune
system, there are several limitations of this study: firstly, due to different sets of stimuli used
in measuring cytokine production to stimulations in the two healthy cohorts, we are not able to
replicate all our findings of genetic associations with cytokine responses from the 500FG
cohort in the 300BCG cohort. Secondly, young adults (< 30 years) are overrepresented in both
healthy cohorts (500FG and 300BCG), which may lead to a biased conclusion which cannot
be generalized to the whole population, especially since the severe COVID-19 cases often
occur in the elderly population. Thirdly, 500FG and 300BCG cohorts are designed to
understand the genetic regulation of immune function in healthy individuals. Therefore, a
COVID-19 patients’ cohort will be needed for better characterization of disease mechanism,
which will be our future research goal.

Collectively, our data demonstrate that genetic variability explains an important component of
the increased susceptibility to severe COVID-19. The genetic risk for severe COVID-19 is
associated with defective innate immune responses (low cytokine production), dysregulated
endothelial function, and is strongly influenced by polymorphisms in sex chromosomes. These
findings may contribute to the development of novel treatment and prevention strategies for
severe COVID-19.

The cohorts involved in this study are from the Human Functional Genomics Project
(HFGP)(40). 500FG consists of 451 healthy individuals of European ancestry with genotype
measurement. Within this cohort, immune cell counts, cytokine production upon stimulations,
platelets, globulins, and gut microbiome were measured (for detailed information see (12, 13,
41, 42)). 300BCG consists of 313 healthy Europeans that participated in a BCG vaccination
study (14)(43). Within this cohort, blood was collected before vaccination and cytokine
production was measured upon ex-vivo stimulation of PBMCs with microbial stimuli.

Genotype quality control and imputation
Genotyping on samples from 500FG and 300BCG was performed using Illumina
humanOmniExpress Exome-8 v1.0 SNP chip Calling by Opticall 0.7.0(44) with default settings.
All individuals of non-European ancestry, ambiguous sex, call rate ≤ 0.99, excess of autosomal
heterozygosity (F<mean-3SD), cryptic relatedness (π>0.185) were removed. SNPs with low
genotyping rate (<95%), with low minor allele frequency (<0.001), deviation from HardyWeinberg equilibrium (p<10-4) were excluded. The detailed QC steps have been published in
reference(13). Genotype data of 500FG and 300BCG were imputed respectively. The
imputation was performed on the Michigan imputation server(45). The cohorts were phased
using Eagle v2.4 with the European population of HRC 1.1 2016 hg 2019 reference panel.
After imputation, variants with a MAF < 0.01, an imputation quality score R2 < 0.5, or a HardyWeinberg-Equilibrium P < 10-12 were excluded. All quality control steps were performed using
Plink v1.9. After imputation and quality control, 451 individuals from 500FG and 313
individuals from 300BCG were available for downstream analyses.

Immune parameter quantitative trait locus (QTL) profiles
We acquired summary statistics of cytokine QTLs (13), cell proportion QTLs(41) and
circulating metabolite QTLs(46) from our previous studies performed with 500FG. We
performed QTL mapping for circulating mediators and platelet traits in 500FG using an R
package MatrixeQTL(47). The measurement of circulating mediators including IL-18BP,
resistin, leptin, adiponectin, alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), and IL-18 have been described
previously(12). Platelet traits(48) include Thrombin-Antithrombin Complex (TAT), Betathromboglobulin total, beta-thromboglobulin, fibrinogen binding, collagen-related peptide
(CRP) P-selectin, CRP fibrinogen, ADP P-selectin, ADP fibrinogen, P-selectin,
platelet−monocyte complex, total platelet count, and von Willebrand factor (VWF). The
circulating mediator levels and platelet traits were log2 transformed. A linear model was
applied to the platelet data and genetic data by taking age and sex as covariates. We considered
p-value < 5×10-8 to be genome-wide significant.

Colocalization analysis.
We performed co-localization analysis (49) to look at the overlapping profile between
molecular QTLs, COVID-19 GWAS, and other GWAS profiles using the R package ‘coloc’.

PRS calculation
Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were calculated by first intersecting the variants from the COVID19 summary statistics(1) with the variants present in our samples. Clumping was done starting
at the most significant variant. All variants within a 250kb window around that variant were
excluded if they were in greater LD than 0.1 before continuing to the most significant variant
outside of the previous window. For each sample specifically, we then multiplied the dosage
of the effect allele with its effect size while substituting missing genotype data with the average

dosage of that variant in the entire sample set. These values were then summed to form the
PRS for each specific sample. As the GWAS summary statistics for creating PRS from
Eillinghaus et.al (1) did not correct age and sex, we also performed a sensitivity analysis with
the PRS created from the GWAS model corrected for age and sex.

PRS based correlations
Linear models were constructed using the computed PRS and various phenotype data available
for each cohort. Samples within the top/bottom 10% PRS were classified as high/low-risk,
respectively. Using the PRS of the samples in these risk groups, we performed a Student T-test
to test for significant correlation between gender and PRS. Furthermore, we tested for
enrichment of any specific gender in these risk groups using a Fisher’s exact test.

Functional analysis of genomic loci
We used the FUMA pipeline in order to identify genes linked to COVID-19 with severe
respiratory failure. FUMA identified significant independent SNPs as variants with P < 1×105

that were independent from each other using an LD threshold of r2 < 0.6. Within these

independent significant SNPs variants lead SNPs are identified as the most significant variants
that are independent using an LD threshold of r2 < 0.1. We mapped Genes to these SNPs based
on their genomic position allowing for a maximum distance of 10kb. In addition to this, genes
were also mapped based on eQTL effects. Genes were selected based on significant SNP-gene
pairs at FDR < 0.05 using cis- and trans-eQTLs from eQTLGen.

As part of the FUMA pipeline we used these mapped genes in order to generate gene expression
heatmaps using GTEx v8 (54 tissue types and 30 general tissue types). Gene expression values
with a pseudocount of 1 were normalized across tissue types using winsorization at 50 and log2

genes in DEG sets for the different tissue types using a Bonferroni corrected P value ≤ 0.05.
Finally, we tested for overrepresentation of our input genes in predetermined gene-sets using
hypergeometric tests. Gene-sets were obtained from MsigDB, WikiPathways, and GWAScatalog reported gene-sets. We used Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction for each of the
categories within these gene-set sources separately using a threshold of 0.05 for our adjusted P
value.

Roadmap epigenetic state enrichment
Based on the Roadmap 15-core epigenetic state database(20), we used data obtained from 23
blood samples spanning 127 epigenomes to map the QTLs in the summary statistics to their
respective epigenetic states. Epigenetic state information was available for bins of 200bp. we
aggregated this information into 4 categories; active enhancer states (Enh, EnhG), active
promotor states (TssA, TssAFlnk), all enhancer states (Enh, EnhG, EnhBiv), and all promotor
states (TssA, TssAFlnk, TssBiv). We tested for enrichment using a Fisher's exact test based on
the number of unique 200bp bins variants mapped to. This was done after filtering the QTL's
down based on their p value using different thresholds (1×10-5, 1×10-6 and 1×10-7). Enrichment
P values were obtained after FDR correction.

Visualization.
R package ggplot2 was used to perform bar charts, box plots and scatter plots. We applied an
online tool Locus zoom to present genes within candidate loci. We used R package pheatmap
to generate heat maps.

*Enhancer and promoter states were derived from a 15-state model based on five chromatin
marks; the core set of five histone modification marks was shared by 127 reference epigenomes
of 24 blood cells from the Roadmap Epigenomics project. Promoter states include active
promoter states (TssA , TssAFlnk) and inactive states (TssBiv); Enhancer states include active
enhancer states (Enh, EnhG) and inactive states (EnhBiv). Enrichment of COVID-19 loci in
regulatory elements was estimated by using Fisher’s exact test.
