Abstract
Background The outbreak of COVID-19 has aroused global concerns. We aimed to
describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 nonsurvivors and analyze possible
causes for the rapid disease progress to death.
Methods Patients with confirmed COVID-19 died in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan
University before February 15, 2020, were identified. We obtained epidemiological,
demographic, and clinical data from electronic medical records.
Results Among 101 nonsurvivors, the median age was 71.0 years (IQR, 59.0-80.0),
59.4% were male, 79.2% had one or more comorbidities including hypertension
(58.4%), cardiovascular disease (22.8%), diabetes (20.8%) etc. The most common
symptoms were fever (76.2%), cough (58.4%) and dyspnea (54.5%). Respiratory
failure (99.0%), acute cardiac injury (52.5%), sepsis (40.6%) and acute kidney injury
(23.8%) were most common complications. Compared with patients died after 3 days
of admission, patients died within 3 days of admission had significantly higher white
blood cell count (10.8 vs 6.7×109/L, P=0.001) and neutrophil count (8.9 vs 5.5×109/L,
P=0.001), longer prothrombin time (13.2 vs 12.5 s, P=0.040), higher D-dimer
concentration (7.64 vs 2.82, P=0.040), higher lactate level (2.9 vs 2.2 mmol/L,
P=0.042), lower oxygen saturation (85.0% vs 91.0%, P=0.008), and were more likely
to suffer sepsis (52.1% vs 30.2%, P=0.025).
Conclusions Older patients with underlying comorbidities suffering COVID-19 were
at high risk of death. Respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury
played crucial roles in the death of COVID-19 patients. Early development of sepsis
was associated with the rapid disease progress to death.

INTRODUCTION
Since December 2019, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused
by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) swept across
China and many other countries have caused global concerns (1). As May 4, 2020, a
total of 3, 517, 345 COVID-19 cases around the world have been confirmed and 243,
401 lost their lives (2). In the early outbreak of COVID-19, respiratory infection
symptoms occurred, with some patients rapidly developed acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure and even death. Compared with severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS),
the concealed onset, stronger contagion and relatively lower mortality could be
defined as the clinical features of the disease (3-5). However, many patients suffered
rapid disease progress to death after admission in the early breakout in Wuhan, China.

Previous studies focused on clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19
patients varied from mild, severe, even deceased cases (6,7). But the possible causes
for the rapid disease progress to death need to be addressed further. In this study, we
aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of nonsurvivors confirmed
with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early outbreak, and to analyze the possible causes
for the rapid disease progress to death after admission in patients with COVID-19.

METHODS
Study Design and Participants
All the patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan
University (including Shouyi campus and Eastern campus) died before February 15,
2020 in Wuhan, China, were enrolled. Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University is one of

the major tertiary hospitals in Wuhan, China and is a government designated hospital
for COVID-19 treatment. All patients with COVID-19 identified in this study were
diagnosed according to World Health Organization interim guidance (8). Large
proportion of patients died within 3 days of admission in the early outbreak of
COVID-19, we also compared demographic and clinical characteristics of patients
died within 3 days with those survived 3 days of admission.

Procedures
We obtained epidemiological, demographic, laboratory, and outcome data from
electronic medical records. Missing data were collected through direct communication
with involved health-care providers or family member of patients. All data were
checked by two sophisticated physicians.

The date of disease onset was defined as the day when the onset of symptoms were
noticed. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute respiratory failure
were defined according to the Berlin definition and previously reported (9,10). Acute
kidney injury (AKI) was identified based on serum creatinine (11). Acute liver injury
was identified according to previous report (12). Acute cardiac injury was defined if
the serum ultra-sensitive troponin I was above the 99th percentile upper reference
limit (6). Sepsis was defined according to the Third International Consensus
Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (13). Characteristic chest computer
tomography (CT) imaging of these nonsurvivors were evaluated by previously
described method (14).

The primary outcome was the possible causes for the rapid disease progress to death

after admission. Secondary outcomes were to present epidemiological and
demographic data, comorbidities, signs and symptoms on admission, laboratory
indicators, CT findings, treatments, organ injury or failure (including lung, heart,
kidney and liver etc.), and to compare the differences of patients died within 3 days
with those survived 3 days of admission.

Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were described as the medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs).
Categorical variables were described as frequencies and percentages based on the
available data. We used Pearson’s chi-square test, the Mann-Whitney test and Fisher’s
exact test for comparisons between patients died within 3 days and those died after 3
days of admission, as appropriate. Survival curve was developed using the
Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test. All statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS (version 22.0) and GraphPad Prism (version 5.0) software. P<0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
By February 15, 2020, 101 hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 died in
Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (including Shouyi campus and Eastern campus)
were included in this study. The median age of nonsurvivors was 71.0 (IQR, 59.0-80.0)
years, 59.4% were male. There were 57 (56.4%) cases whose age over 70 years (Table
1). Among all the nonsurvivors, 81 (79.2%) patients had one or more underling
medical conditions. The most common comorbidities included hypertension (58.4%),
cardiovascular disease (22.8%), diabetes (20.8%), chronic pulmonary disease (14.9%),
and cerebrovascular disease (12.9%). The most common symptoms were fever

(76.2%), cough (58.4%), dyspnea (54.5%), and fatigue (37.6%). Other less common
symptoms were diarrhea (9.9%), anorexia (5.9%), nausea and vomiting (2.0%) and
abdominal pain (1.0%) (Table 1). The median duration from the onset of symptoms to
admission and from admission to death were 9.0 (IQR, 5.0-13.0) days and 4.0 days
(IQR, 2.0-7.0), respectively. The survival curve of COVID-19 patients were shown in
Figure 1.

Forty-eight cases (47.52%) died within 3 days of admission, the median age was 72.0
(IQR, 59.0-78.0) years, and 58.3% were male. Fifty-three cases (52.5%) died after 3
days of admission, the median age was 71.0 (IQR, 59.0-81.0) years, and 60.4% were
male. Compared with patients who survived 3 days, those died within 3 days of
admission exhibited significantly higher respiration rate (25 vs 20 rpm, P=0.005) and
heart rate (97 vs 84 bpm, P=0.006) on admission. There were no significant
differences of self-report symptoms and underlying comorbidities between patients
died within 3 days of admission and those survived 3 days of admission (Table 1).

We observed substantial abnormalities (below or over normal range) in laboratory
findings of these nonsurvivors on admission (Table 2). Elevated neutrophil count,
increased levels of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, NT-proBNP, ultra-sensitivity
troponin I, myoglobin, blood glucose, D-dimer and lactate were noticed in the
nonsurvivors. Besides, significantly decreased lymphocyte count, PaO2 and SpO2
below normal range were also obvious in these nonsurvivors. Patients died within 3
days of admission had significantly higher white blood cell count (10.8 vs 6.7×109/L,
P= 0.001), neutrophil count (8.9 vs 5.5×109/L, P=0.001). For other biochemical
indexes, creatine kinase-MB (3.3 vs 2.0 ng/ml, P=0.036), myoglobin (186.6 vs 118.7

ug/L, P=0.034) were significantly higher in patients died within 3 days of admission.
Compared with patients survived 3 days of admission, those died within 3 days had
longer prothrombin time (13.2 vs 12.5 s, P=0.040) and higher D-dimer concentration
(7.64 vs 2.82, P=0.040). Blood gas analyses showed patients died within 3 days
presented with significantly lower oxygen saturation (85.0% vs 91.0%, P=0.008) and
higher lactate level (2.9 vs 2.2 mmol/L, P=0.042) which reflected poor oxygenation in
these patients. Patients suffered severe lung damage and their lung CT features
presented vast or merged glass shadow, but quantification of lung injury revealed no
significant difference between patients died within 3 days and those died after 3 days
of admission (Table 1 and Figure 2).

Among treatment strategies, most patients received antiviral therapy (96.0%) and
antibacterial therapy (98.0%). Many received glucocorticoid therapy (43.6%) and
immunoglobulin therapy (35.6%). Seventy-eight (77.2%) patients received high flow
oxygen inhalation, 40.6% received noninvasive mechanical ventilation while 13.9%
received invasive mechanical ventilation and 5.0% received continuous renal
replacement therapy (Table 3).

Regarding to organ functions, 100 (99.0%) patients developed respiratory failure,
52.5% had acute cardiac injury, 40.6% developed sepsis, acute kidney injury were
developed in 24 cases (23.8%), acute liver dysfunction were found in 18 cases (17.8%)
and 15 (14.9%) suffered coagulation disorders among which one patient died of
massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Compared with patients died after 3 days of
admission, patients died within 3 days of admission were more likely to develop
sepsis. (52.1% vs 30.2%, P=0.025) (Table 3).

DISUSSION
As of February 15, 2020, 101 patients died because of COVID-19 were included in
this study. In the early outbreak of COVID-19, major gaps in our knowledge of the
epidemiology, clinical features and treatment measures of COVID-19 posed huge
challenge for our clinical practice. Although previous study reported the mortality of
patients with COVID-19 was 1.4% (15), some special population including the aged
and individuals with underlying comorbidities may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2
infection. Recent publication has demonstrated old age as an independent predictor of
mortality in COVID-19 patients (16). In our study, the median age of nonsurvivors
was 71.0 years, 79.2% of them combined with one or more underlying medical
conditions including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and chronic
pulmonary disease etc. This suggested that aged individuals with chronic medical
conditions were more likely to suffer a severe attack and death.

Common symptoms at onset of COVID-19 were fever, dry cough, myalgia, fatigue
etc. (6,17). In our study, we observed that besides fever and cough, dyspnea presented
early in most nonsurvivors with confirmed COVID-19, similar finding has also been
observed in critically ill patients reported by Yang etc. (18). Recent publication
suggested the median time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission of deceased
patients was 10.0 (IQR, 7.0-13.0) days, which tended to be longer than that of
recovered patients (9.0 [IQR, 6.0-12.0] days) (19). In our study, the median time from
symptom onset to admission of patients died within 3 days and after 3 days of
admission was 10.0 (IQR, 6.0-13.0) days and 8.0 (IQR, 4.0-14.0) days, respectively,

but with no significantly difference between two groups. This indicated that although
longer duration before admission might be associated with poor prognosis of
COVID-19 patients, it was not contributed to the rapid disease progress to death
within 3 days of admission.

Abnormal laboratory findings on admission suggested impaired pulmonary, cardiac,
liver and coagulation functions as well as disturbed immune function of these
nonsurvivors even before hospitalisation. ARDS was the most common complication
in nonsurviving patients with COVID-19 and oxygen saturation was an important
manifestation of ARDS. In our study, SpO2 of patients died within 3 days of
admission was 85.0% on admission, which was significantly lower compared with
those died after 3 days of admission. These suggested that SpO2 on admission might
serve as early warning signals of poor prognosis and should attract more attentions.
In terms of SARS, severe respiratory failure was the leading cause of mortality, with
little other organ failure (20). In our study, it was noticed that 52.5% and 23.8%
nonsurvivors

suffered

respectively.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a crucial SARS-CoV-2 receptor,
distributed widely in heart, kidney, and intestine etc. (21-23). Whether SARS-CoV-2
attack heart and kidney or other vital organs directly needs to be confirmed further.

Usually, neutrophils do not elevate significantly during viral infections. However,
viral infection might impair the immune system and facilitate opportunistic infection
and neutrophils are crucial in protection against bacterial infections (24). Of interest,
the occurrence of sepsis and significantly elevated neutrophils were noticed in patients
died with COVID-19, especially in those died within 3 days of admission. This

reminded us that secondary infection could be related to the rapid disease progress to
death. Frequent detection of bacterial infection indicators like procalcitonin and early
implementation of antibiotics might be beneficial for patients suspected of bacterial
infections. Compared with patients died after 3 days of admission, prolonged
prothrombin time and remarkably increased D-dimer were noticed in patients died
within 3 days of admission, which together with depressed platelet count indicated
coagulation disturbance and tendency of disseminated intravascular coagulation in
these patients.

Up to now, no antiviral treatment has been recommended for coronavirus treatment
except supportive care and organ support (6,25). Antiviral medications including
remdesivir, lopinavir and traditional Chinese medicine are being used in the clinical
practice. Available evidence showed that remdesivir was not associated with
statistically signifcant clinical benefts (26). Application of glucocorticoid depended on
the severity of inflammatory response. In our study, most nonsurvivors received high
flow oxygen inhalation, but quite a low proportion of patients received machine
ventilation partly due to limited medical resources against the steeply increasing
number of patients in the early outbreak.

Several limitations existed in this study. Firstly, not all laboratory tests were
performed in all patients, the missing data might lead to bias and the roles of some
indicators might be underestimated. Secondly, in the early outbreak of COVID-19,
relatively inadequate medical resources might affect the observation of the natural
course of disease. Finally, only 101 patients died with COVID-19 in one hospital were
included in this study, the interpretation of our results might be limited, so further

studies including multi-centres are still needed.

CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, the findings of this study suggested that older patients with
comorbidities were at high risk of death with COVID-19. Respiratory failure, acute
cardiac and kidney injury played crucial roles in the death of patients. Of importance,
the early development of sepsis, increased white blood cell count and neutrophil count
indicated poor outcomes and could associated with the rapid disease progress to death.
Thus, COVID-19 patients at high risks should attract more attention.
