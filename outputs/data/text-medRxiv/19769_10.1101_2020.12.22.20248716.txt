Abstract: This article investigates the geographical spread of COVID-19 confirmed
cases and deaths across municipalities in Mexico. It focuses on the spread dynamics
between Phase I (from March 23th to May 31st, 2020) and II (from June 1st to August
22th, 2020) of the social distancing measures. It also examines municipal-level factors
associated with cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths to understand the spatial
determinants of the pandemic. The analysis of the geographic pattern of the pandemic
via Space-Time Scan Statistics (SaTScan) revealed fast spread among municipalities.
During Phase I, clusters of infections and deaths were mainly located at the center of
the country, while in Phase II, these clusters dispersed to the rest of the country. The
regression results from the Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Regression analysis
suggested that income inequality, prevalence of obesity and diabetes, and concentration
of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) are strongly positively associated to confirmed cases
and deaths regardless of lockdown.

1. Introduction
As of November 24, 2020, Mexico ranks fourth in the world in coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) deaths, behind only by the U.S., Brazil and India. The country has a total
1’049,358 positive cases and 101,926 deaths, which at present, represents one of the highest
lethality rates (10.29%) in the world. Mexico, like other Latin American countries is framed
by growing poverty levels, large income inequality and disparities in access to healthcare
services (Dávila-Cervantes and Agudelo-Botero, 2019; Hessel et al., 2019; Mesenburg et al.,
2018). Furthermore, the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and other conditions that might
shape obesity in the country have a much larger role on the lethality disease. The strong
relationship between being individual with overweight or obesity and severe outcomes of
hospitalization has been well documented (Hernández-Garduño, 2020; Popkin et al., 2020).
Hence, individuals with excessive body fat, or major cardiometabolic problems (ranging from
hypertension to cardiovascular disease and diabetes) could present severe or even lethal
complications. In this vein, Mexico faces a significant risk as, for years now, it has been in
the second spot when it comes to the global ranking of adult obesity, just behind the U.S.,
whereas, overweight and obesity in childhood rates are the highest worldwide (OECD, 2019).
Similarly, an enormous amount of scientific literature has provided strong evidence
that climate factors such as high air temperature or exposure to air pollution lead to an increase

2020; Sobral et al., 2020). This has been explained by the contribution of air pollution to
respiratory tract infections, pulmonary disease, or diabetes burden (Lubrano et al., 2020; Ma
et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). Mexico, with vastly different climates among its states and
municipalities, has presented differentiated effects on COVID-19 confirmed cases (MéndezArriaga, 2020). Some other studies have shown the underlying socio-economic conditions
could correlate to the dynamics of the pandemic. For instance, Bambra et al. (2020)
documented how the exacerbated existing social inequalities in the country have translated to
higher rates of infection and mortality among the most disadvantaged communities. One can
also hypothesize that, like other highly densely populated cities in the world (Sun et al.,
2020a,b,c), the relative number of COVID-19 infections and deaths in Mexican metropolitan
areas would be larger than non-metro areas.
On top of the above-mentioned socio-economic, health and climate factors associated
with the dynamics of the disease, physical distancing and lockdown measures restricting
mobility add an extra layer of complexity to the understanding of the unfolding of the
pandemic. On one side of the spectrum, government authorities of countries like China,
Germany or South Korea acted early by sending their residents a clearly message about what
actions to be taken. The positive impact of lockdown on containing the COVID-19 outbreak
has been observed in China (Lau et al., 2020), Italy (Signorelli, 2020), Hong Kong (Lam et
al., 2020) United Kingdom (Ferguson et al., 2020) or Thailand (Dechsupa et al., 2020). On
the other side of the spectrum, government’s actions in countries like the U.S., Brazil or
Mexico have been questioned for failing to adopt early and strict containment. In Mexico,
“Phase I” of the temporary mobility restriction efforts started with the National Safe and
Social Distancing Program (in Spanish Jornada Nacional de Sana Distancia), and comprised
14 weeks between March 23th and May 31st, 2020. During Phase I, residents were exhorted
to: (i) to stay at home (not enforced), (ii) wash their hands repeatedly, and (iii) avoid touching
their face. With a 56% of informal employment, the possibility to “stay home” was limited to
a small sub-group of Mexicans. In fact, reports of automobile traffic, tracking of mobile
phones and social media activities indicated that most people were ignoring Phase I mobility
restrictions (Macip, 2020).
This study investigates main socio-economic, health, climate and mobility factors
associated to COVID-19 infections and deaths. To do so we fit Zero-Inflated Negative
Binomial (ZINB) regression models. We also attempted to understand the Relative Risk (RR)
of the transmission dynamics of current and future emerging geographical clusters. For this
task, we implemented discrete Poisson probability models. The RR is a non-negative number
representing how much more common disease is inside a geographical cluster compared to
outside. We use data from the 2,459 Mexican municipalities to explore correlations of
variables during Phase I and II. Here, Phase II is defined as the following 14 weeks after Phase
I ended, this is, between June 1st and August 22th, 2020.
Our Space-Time Scan Statistics (SaTScan) allows the detection, size and duration of
emerging clusters of cumulative disease cases. It illustrates how the dynamics of the disease
changed between Phase I and II. Each cluster consists of a 14-weeks window with a circular
geographic base which is centered around one of the possible centroids with high RR. For
instance, during Phase I, the most-likely cluster of COVID-19 infections was centered at

Mexico City metropolitan area with RR=4.49, meaning that the population within the cluster
was 4.49 times more likely to be exposed to the virus than the population outside the cluster.
Interestingly, during Phase II, the most-likely cluster was also centered at Mexico City
metropolitan area but with a considerably lower RR (RR=1.96). Phase II was also
characterized by the spread of new infection and death clusters along the country. The findings
suggest that during Phase I, both deaths and infections from COVID-19 were concentrated in
the country's capital, however, after the lifting of containment measures, the virus had a rapid
spread to the rest of the country due to multiple causes which we further try to investigate.
With respect to the ZINB regression results, we found that in both phases, income
inequality, the proportion of adults with obesity and diabetes resulted strongly positively
correlated with cumulative COVID-19 infections and deaths. Likewise, annual PM 2.5
concentration (log) was found to be strongly positively correlated to total deaths during Phase
I and II. This is, regardless the containment measures, municipalities with deep socioeconomic inequalities and poor health outcomes were more likely to suffer from larger
infections and deaths during the first wave of the pandemic.
After the introduction, Section II presents our methodological framework. Section III
shows the main results and discussion of the empirical findings. Finally, Section IV concludes
with some policy recommendations and further work.
2. Data and Methods
2.1 Spatial scanning statistical analysis
We used Kulldorff’s (1997, 2011) SaTScan analysis to detect space-time clusters of COVID19 cumulative positive cases and deaths for each of the two phases of lockdown. Under this
approach, we tested whether RR of the geographical clustering was caused by a random
variation or not. This is, whether the expected number of infections (resp. death) within
clusters were larger (e.g., cluster of a high risk of infection (resp. death)) than infections (resp.
deaths) outside. To do so, we implemented discrete Poisson probability models using different
windows of geographical radius. We refer interested readers to Kihal-Talantikite et al. (2013),
and Rao et al. (2017) for full technical details. Recent SaTScan applications in the context of
COVID-19 can be found in the works of Desjardins et al. (2020) or Kim and Castro (2020)
for the cases of U.S. and South Korea, respectively. The most-likely geographical cluster is
the one with maximum likelihood, and other clusters with significant log-likelihood ratios
(LLR) can be seeing secondary potential clusters. Each LLR has a p-value estimated via 999
Monte Carlo Simulations. Finally, if p-value<0.05, then the geographical cluster has
significantly higher risk of COVID-19 infections (resp. deaths) than that outside the area.
2.2 Potential factors influencing COVID-19 positive cases and deaths
The group of potential predictors is as follows.
• Socio-economic. A dummy of metropolitan area, log of population density, proportion of
males, Gini of income inequality, and proportion of poverty.
• Health. Proportion of obesity in adults aged 20 years or older, proportion of hypertension,
proportion of diabetes, and fast food outlets per 1,000 people.

Climate. Log of average monthly maximum temperature, log of average monthly

Commute. Public buses per 1,000 people, private vehicles automobiles per 1,000 people,
and proportion of economic units that are essential activities.

deaths using data from 2,459 Mexican municipalities. Vertical dashed lines in black color represent the
start and end of the Phase I.

Figure 1 displays the Pearson correlation coefficient resulting from monthly new positive
COVID-19 cases and deaths. By visual inspection we notice that population density (log),
proportion of adults aged 20 years or older with obesity, annual PM 2.5 (log) and cars per
1,000 people strongly correlate with new monthly COVID-19 cases and monthly deaths.
2.3 Econometric strategy
Our econometric strategy is like the one presented in McLaren (2020) in which the dependent
variable, 𝑦, is the cumulative monthly number of reported COVID-19 cases (resp. deaths).
More formally, we have:
log(𝐸[𝑦𝑖𝑡 ]) = 𝛽0 + ∑𝑚 𝛽𝑚 𝐷𝑚𝑡 + ∑𝑠 𝛽𝑠 𝑋𝑠,𝑖𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 ,

(1)

where 𝑦 = 0,1,2, …; 𝑖 stands for municipality and 𝑡 for month. 𝐷𝑚𝑡 is a dummy variable that
takes the value of 1 if 𝑚 = 𝑡 and 0 otherwise. 𝛽𝑠 are the coefficients associated to the 𝑠
explanatory variables which can be classified into one of the corresponding socio-economic,
health, climate or commuting factors.
Our unit of analysis are municipalities, and both the count of positive cases and deaths
have more zero observations than predicted by a Poisson process, which assumes that its

variance is equal to its mean. For both of our dependent variables the Vuong test detected
significant overdispersion, strongly favoring a ZINB regression. The ZINB regression uses
the mixing of a process (logistic regression in this study) that predicts some zero counts and
another one (negative binomial) that models counts. The logistic analysis of the ZINB model
predicts the probability of 𝑦 falling into the zero group (e.g., no positive cases (resp. no deaths)
in municipality 𝑖), while the negative binomial part models the expectation of 𝑦 conditional
on a non-zero value. This is, the expected count of the number of positive cases (resp. deaths)
in municipality 𝑖.
3. Results
3.1 Location of the pandemic in Mexico during Phase I and II
Figure 2(a) depicts the geographical location and size of the pandemic during Phase I. At the
beginning of the outbreak, the most-likely cluster of COVID-19 cumulative positive cases
was located at Mexico City metropolitan area while secondary clusters were also situated at
the center of the country with spatial overlaps.

More precisely, the most-likely cluster was composed of 21 municipalities (see Table 2)
accounting for 29,784 positive cases in a radius of 23.24km. Recall that Mexico City
metropolitan area has a total population of more than 20 million inhabitants. Like New York
in the U.S., this high-density area was the first in being hit by the pandemic. During this period,
the risk of COVID-19 positive cases of the most-likely cluster was about 4.5 (RR=4.49) times
higher than that in other clusters.

The effectiveness of social distancing measures imposed by local and federal
governments could, perhaps, be appreciated in Figure 2(b). From the figure, we observe that
most-likely and secondary clusters shifted towards southern and eastern regions. As expected,
these dynamics indicate the rising spread of the virus in less populated areas of the States of
Tlaxcala or Guanajuato. Interestingly, however, are the results of spatio-temporal clusters of
COVID-19 deaths which show an opposite pattern. This is, municipalities clustered at highrisk areas during Phase I were located along different latitudes and longitudes (States of Baja
California, Nuevo León, Tamaulipas, Oaxaca and Puebla) without a visible spatial pattern.
Alternatively, the high-risk areas during Phase II were concentrated around Mexico City metro
area (States of Mexico, Mexico City, Tlaxcala, Puebla, Hidalgo). The center of the most-likely
cluster of COVID-19 deaths during Phase II was located in Sonora State, with centroid

coordinates 29.9518 latitude and -112.094 longitude (LLR=698.19 p-value<0.001). This
circular area covered 69 municipalities with a radius of 353.85km, and included municipalities
sharing border with the U.S. The total number of COVID-19 deaths in the cluster was 3,179,
and the risk of fatality was about 2 times (RR=2.18) higher than outside this area.
The spatial distribution of COVID-19 positive cases and deaths is likely to be shaped
by climate and social processes related to the municipalities’ growth and social inequalities.
This motivates our further analysis, which we discuss in the next section regarding to the
examination of the main drivers of COVID-19 disease spread.
3.2 Descriptive statistics of the variables incorporated in the model
During the Social Distancing Program, a total of 1,493 (60.71%) municipalities reported at
least one confirmed case, and 1,216 (50.5%) reported at least one death. Three months after
the Social Distancing Program, 2,096 (85.2%) and 1,551 (63%) municipalities reported at
least one confirmed case and deaths, respectively.
Table 2 presents the summary statistics of the variables of interest. As we can notice,
due to data availability only some climate-related variables present monthly changes in their
values. Among other facts, 36 ± 95% (mean ± standard deviation) of the municipalities belong
to metropolitan areas, the average Gini income inequality per municipality is 0.39±0.04 while
in the average municipality 65±22% of the population lives below the poverty line. In average,
Mexican municipalities have 319.83 ± 1,269.56 inhabitants per sq. km of land, but its standard
deviation is considerably large indicating that datapoints tend to be far from the mean value.
The proportion of obesity is very high, this is, in average 32 ± 9% of the population
aged 20 years or older suffer from obesity. As mentioned previously, the relationship between
obesity and respiratory disease is largely known (Walton et al., 2009; Jiao et al., 2015;
Richardson et al., 2015) and we expect a positive relationship with COVID-19 deaths.
However, the magnitude of the coefficient estimates associated to obesity, as well as the
coefficients of the other comorbidities, is region dependent.
In the category of environmental variables, we have converted temperature into
Fahrenheit degrees to avoid negative values of Celsius degrees during cold months so that the
log transformation does not disrupts our analysis. Long-term exposure to PM 2.5 adversely
affects respiratory and cardiovascular systems and may increases lethality rates of COVID-19
(Wu et al., 2020). This could be particularly true for municipalities in metro areas. In MéndezArriaga (2020) it has been documented that climate conditions in States with low temperatures
and poor precipitation (in mm), such as Tlaxcala, Guanajuato or Michoacán, favoured local
infections during Phase I.
Our proxies for human mobility behaviour are expected to be positively correlated to
the spread of the virus (see Figure 1), but its association with deaths remains unknown. The
variable proportion of essential activities include health-related companies, public security
and fundamental sectors of the economy (utilities, food and beverages, agriculture, fisheries
and livestock, industrial chemicals, storage, courier services, private security,
telecommunications, emergency services, funeral services, transportation of individuals,

3.3 Main determinants of COVID-19 cumulative cases and deaths during Phase I and II
For the easiness of synthesizing our results, Figure 3 shows the effect size of the estimated
coefficients related to the count part of the model, e.g., negative binomial, and Tables 3 and 4
summarize full results. Recall that the count model describes associations between
explanatory variables and COVID-19 cases (deaths) among municipalities with at least one
reported COVID-19 case (death). During both Phases I and II, we observed (Figure 3(a)) a
large and significant positive association between municipal-level cumulative positive cases
and proportion of obesity (p-value<0.001), proportion of diabetes (p-value<0.001) and
income inequality (p-value<0.001). Although positive and statistical significative, the size of
the estimated coefficients of proportion of essential activities, population density (log),
average minimum temperature (log) and annual PM 2.5 concentration (log) is considerably
smaller.
In regard to COVID-19 fatalities, population density (log) and average minimum
temperature (log) were found to be positively associated to deaths. The statistical significance
of population density is not surprising as we could hypothesized such result from the strong
positive correlation shown in Figure 1. However, positive association between average

Figure 3. Effect size of predictor coefficients, count model of the Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial. Black lines
represent the 95% confidence interval. Variables in grey, red, green and yellow color correspond to socioeconomic, health, climate and commuting factors, respectively

Socio-economic and health-related variables had an important role on the evolution of
monthly cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. For the count model results in
Figure 3, the estimated coefficient of population density (log) during Phase I equals 0.53 (resp.
0.31) and it is statistically significant at the 99%. An alternative explanation for the estimated
coefficients is the incidence rate ratios (IRR), also known as odds ratios in ZINB models,
which are calculated by taking the exponent of the estimated coefficients in Figure 3. The IRR
of population density (log), see Table 3, indicates that a unit increase in this variable increased
it by 1.71 (=exp(0.53)) (resp. 1.37) times among those municipalities who experienced cases
of coronavirus disease 2019 infection (resp. deaths) during the Phase I. In Phase II, however,
the magnitude of the estimated coefficient became larger in the case of deaths, meaning that
more densely populated municipalities suffered from larger counts of fatalities. This result is
also partially illustrated in Figure 2. The finding is in line with recent published work using
U.S. county-level data (Sun et al., 2020a) or Iran province-level data (Ahmadi et al. 2020) but
contrary to the empirical evidence of the provincial regions in China (Sun et al., 2020c).

Municipalities located at metropolitan areas were more-likely (p-value<0.001) to
suffer from infections and deaths in Phase II. Income inequality is revealed as one of main
factors associated with the spread of the virus and deaths. During Phase I, holding all other
municipal-level variables at their mean values, positive cases increased by a factor of 4,045.05
for each one unit increase in the Gini index, while in Phase II this factor increased to

10,178.66. Moreover, municipalities with disproportionately social inequalities (e.g.,
municipalities in the States of Oaxaca, Mexico or Mexico City) suffered from larger IRR of
COVID-19 deaths. The result is in line with the evidence of the U.S. at the county-level
(Millett, 2020) or Singapore at the planning area-level (Yi et a., 2020). The pronounced social
disparities across states has shown that vulnerable geographical areas in terms of large social
disadvantages were those with the highest numbers of cases and deaths of COVID-19.
Our findings also provide support that poor air quality conditions at the municipallevel strongly correlate to the prevalence and deaths due to COVID-19. During Phase I (resp.
Phase II) an increase in 1 metric tonne in PM2.5 (log) per year would increase COVID-19
death rate by a factor of 1.25 (resp. 1.97). The finding is in line with relevant studies tackling
the atmospheric determinants of population’s vulnerability to COVID-19 in the U.S. (Bashir
et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020), Italy (Lubrano et al., 2020), China (Lin et al., 2020a) or some
cities of Latin America (Bolaño et al., 2020), all of them unanimously confirmed the
correlation between atmospheric conditions and COVID-19 cases, making poor air quality an
additional co-determinant of COVID-19 lethality. With respect to precipitation, we observed
that high cumulative rainfall (log) reduced the virus transmission and deaths during Phase II,
only. Different from air pollution, the literature focusing on the role of amount of rainfall and
virus transmission/deaths have found inconclusive results. In some countries like the U.S.
(Bashir et al., 2020), Indonesia (Tosepu et al., 2020) or Brazil (Rosario et al., 2020) rainfall
has been shown to be not associated with the dynamics of the virus.
The large magnitude of the coefficients associated to health-related explanatory
variables during Phase I indicates that regions with high prevalence of comorbidities, such as
municipalities in the states of Mexico, Sinaloa, Veracruz or Yucatan, were hard hit by
COVID-19. Note that during Phase I comorbidities where not statistically associated to the
cumulative count of deaths.
Lastly, commuting-related factors are found to be weakly correlated to confirmed
cases and deaths. For instance, during Phase I, municipalities with large proportion of essential
activities reported lower death rates (IRR= 0.26, p-value<0.001). After the social distancing
was gradually lifted in Phase II, an increase in the proportion of essential activities was linked
to a decrease (IRR= 0.46, p-value<0.001) in the spread of the virus. The explanation for these
apparently inconsistent effects is tied to the share of the informal employment in Mexico
(53.4% in 2016, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO, 2018)). Needless
to say that the size of the informal employment in the country is comparable to other Latin
American nations (Argentina, 47.2%; Brazil 40.5%; Chile 40.1%; Ecuador 59%) or China
(54.4%).
3. Concluding remarks
4.1 Discussion
The spatial distribution of emerging space-time clusters of COVID-19 at the municipal-level
showed that after Phase I was lifted, the de-escalation process exhibited rapidly spread of the
virus to northern and southern regions, particularly to those municipalities along the Mexico-

U.S. border. We identified a total of 23 clusters of COVID-19 infections during Phase I, and
surprisingly, the total number of clusters increased to 40 in Phase II. Notwithstanding, we also
found an opposite dynamic with respect to cumulative COVID-19 deaths. This is, the total
number of clusters reduced from 24 to 16 between Phase I and II, respectively, and their
centroids moved away from Mexico City metropolitan area to Sonora and other bordering
states. Although Phase II was characterized by a small number of clusters of COVID-19
deaths, they also reported a considerably larger number of cumulative deaths. For instance,
the most-likely cluster during Phase I reported 1,072 deaths whereas in Phase II, it exhibited
3,179. Our spatio-temporal analysis illustrates the usefulness of the spatial scan statistic
(SaTScan) as a tool for geographical disease surveillance.
Aside from the physical restriction measures imposed by local and federal
governments, other potential municipal-level factors associated to dynamic of the disease
could be existing socio-economic inequalities. The empirical evidence of Das et al. (2020)
showed that COVID-19 spread grow exponentially in those Indian regions with large socioeconomic deprivation. Similarly, the evidence comparing United Kingdom regions (Sun et
al., 2020b) revealed important geographical disparities in risk and outcomes of the disease.
This is, the risk of dying among those diagnosed with the infection was higher for those
belonging to minority ethnic groups and those living in more deprived areas. Sannigrahi et al.
(2020) also found strong evidence supporting the idea that spatial determinants of COVID-19
infections and deaths in Europe were mainly associated to poverty rates and income
inequality.
Additional arguments explaining the geographical spread of the disease are presented
in Geng et al. (2020). Their study found associations between reopening of urban business
centers in the U.S. and rapid spread of the virus across counties. Sun et al. (2020a) highlighted
the noticeable spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of positive cases in the U.S., in
particular, when comparing counties in the center of the country with those located at the East
and West coast. The authors illustrated the strong positive correlation between socioeconomic factors (population density, social segregation, and differences by ethnicity) and
infection rate. The link between space-time variations of disease and socio-economic factors
has also recently been investigated by Snyder and Parks (2020), Xie et al. (2020) and Karaye
and Horney (2020).
In the context of Mexico, our results at the municipal-level indicate that, regardless of
lockdown policies, metabolic disorders, such as obesity or diabetes, are able to exacerbate
both infections and deaths. Our findings are in line with those presented in Lubrano et al.
(2020), in which the extremely high level of COVID-19 lethality in Northern Italy compared
to the rest of the country can be explained by differences in air pollution and obesity. The
above-mentioned link, between obesity/air pollution and higher COVID-19 lethality is also
supported by Sanchis-Gomar et al. (2020). The authors detail how adipose tissue may be
vulnerable to COVID-19 infection, therefore, obese patients also have worse outcomes with
COVID-19 infection, including respiratory failure, need for mechanical ventilation, and
higher mortality (Almerie and Kerrigan, 2020; Palaiodimos et al., 2020; Flint and Tahrani,
2020). Similarly, the presence of diabetes has been associated with an increased mortality risk
(Pitocco et al., 2020; Papadokostaki et al., 2020) because people with diabetes could suffer

from a loss of capacity to regulate immunity. Therefore, due to the large prevalence of diabetes
(15%) and obesity (60%) in Mexico, we expect COVID-19 lethality being considerably higher
than the one experienced by other countries in the region. In this vein, our variable fast food
per 1,000 people was intended to discover possible effects of fast food restaurants on
infections and deaths. There is an ongoing debate on weather higher density of unhealthy food
options is associated with higher obesity and diabetes prevalence. While the evidence is mixed
(Frankenfeld et al., 2015, Mejova et al., 2015), Mexico has recently implemented a front-ofpack labeling system as an attempt to tackle obesity by reducing the purchase of unhealthy
products. All in all, our empirical evidence does not support the idea that an increasing number
of local fast food restaurants is associated with higher rates of disease infections or lethality.
4.2 Policy recommendations
On the one hand, the detection of space-time clusters of infections and deaths, Figure 2, can
be exploited by policymakers and healthcare authorities to target regions that are on need of
priority interventions. For instance, when there is a substantial overlap of secondary clusters,
e.g., Figure 2(a), it is indicative of an urgent need of regional measures for the prevention,
containment and coordination to be implemented in combating the COVID-19 health crisis.
Successfully examples of localized policy interventions are detailed in Leal-Neto et al. (2020)
and Dlamini et al. (2020) for the case of Brazil and Eswatini (Africa), respectively. Likewise,
some of the spatial clusters identified in this work grouped together municipalities from
different states. This scenario is of key relevance while designing localized public health
efforts. In Mexico, the federal government has delegated to Federal States much of the
responsibility about the management of the public health system during the pandemic. Federal
States also have main duties and responsibilities related to the restriction of non-essential
economic activities when the Epidemiological Risk Traffic Light (a bi-weekly monitoring
system met to monitor and grade the use of public space according to virus transmission) turns
into red color. In context of emerging clusters sharing municipalities from different states,
coordinated efforts among various governments levels are critical. Past published research has
shown the advantages of these type of coordinated public policy interventions not only to
prevent the spread of sexual transmission diseases (Marotta, 2016) or Salmonella (Seixas et
al., 2018) but also to provide with better healthcare services to vulnerable population suffering
from cleft lip and palate (Gasca et al., 2019), obesity (Gartner et al., 2016), tuberculosis (Rao
et al., 2017), and so forth.
On the other hand, while some experts say that the hardest hit countries had an aging
population (Gardner et al., 2020), underdeveloped healthcare systems (Tanne et al., 2020) or
unfavorable natural environment (Di Marco et al., 2020), it seems that unresolved structural
problems of high poverty and income inequality aggravated the spread of the pandemic in
Mexico. Thus, government response policies, such as testing procedures, tracking of
individuals, social distancing measures or plans for hospital reconversion and immediate
expansion will not be sufficient to mitigate the dynamics of the disease spread. Unless major
policy changes are implemented to improve environmental sustainability and promote human
development, more disadvantaged Mexican municipalities will become hotspots for virus

circulation and re-emergence. More precisely, some of the possible policy actions could
include support for workers in the informal sector, assistance for the population in poverty or
a decarbonization pathway that focuses on electrification and clean renewable energy.
Interestingly, the recent front-of-pack labeling system based on warning labels of unhealthy
products seems to be an adequate government’s strategy to fight obesity and ultimately
COVID-19.
