Abstract
Covid-19 and lockdowns have had spillover effects on other health outcomes. Motor vehicle
collisions (MVC) are likely to have been affected by the pandemic due to, among others, less
traffic volume and speeding on empty streets. This paper studies the impact of the pandemic
on MVCs in Northern Ireland. Using monthly data on injuries and deaths, we find a steep
decline in slight and serious injuries compared to what would have been expected in the
absence of the pandemic. However, we find no effect on the number of deaths. Based on data
from speeding tickets, a plausible explanation for the differential effect on the number of
injuries and deaths is speeding on empty streets during the pandemic.
Keywords: Covid-19; lockdown; motor vehicle collisions; speeding; injury; mortality

1. Background
Over 50 people lose their lives in Motor Vehicle Collisions (MVC) in Northern Ireland every
year, and more than 700 are seriously injured.1 As Covid-19 has been affecting nearly all
aspects of everyday activities, there are reasons to believe that the number of MVCs has also
been affected by the pandemic, as outlined by plausible mechanisms put forward in a previous
study.2
First, the impact on traffic volume may have an ambiguous effect on the number and
severity of MVCs. People are likely to commute less due to lockdowns and due to being afraid
of catching Covid-19. On one hand, less traffic volume means fewer vehicles at risk of
collision. Higher unemployment rates observed during the pandemic3 also are likely to lead to

On the other hand, less congested streets give an opportunity for speeding, which may affect

the likelihood and severity of collision.6-7
Second, factors associated with the pandemic have had an impact on driving behaviour.
Distraction, due to worrying about family members who are ill8 or due to economic uncertainty
and financial worries,9-11 has been associated with increased risk of MVC. Changes in drinking
patterns have also occurred during the pandemic. Bars and restaurants were closed for certain
periods, due to measures to tackle Covid-19, and had fewer customers when open as people
were trying to reduce the risk of catching the virus. However, overall alcohol consumption may
have increased.12 Sleeping patterns (another risk factor) have also been affected by the
pandemic.13-14
Empirical evidence on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on MVCs is scarce, as
many countries publish data with a significant time lag. Early empirical evidence suggests that
there has been a decrease in collisions during the pandemic.2,15-18 Interestingly, in the USA
there has been a reduction in MVCs in the first months of the Covid-19 pandemic,15-16 but at
the same time there has been an increase in deaths.19
The objective of this study is to examine whether and to what extent MVCs, injuries
and deaths were affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in Northern Ireland.

2. Data and Methods
We obtained monthly data on MVCs from the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). Data
included the monthly number of slight injuries, serious injuries and deaths for the period from
January 2015 to October 2020. Unfortunately, monthly data by cause of MVC were not
available, but the PSNI provides monthly data on the number of traffic-related fines by type of
violation.

We investigated the lockdown effects employing Interrupted Time Series (ITS)
analysis. The “intervention” started in March, when the first Covid-19 death occurred in
Northern Ireland, and the first lockdown was introduced. This is also the period when reduced
mobility was observed.20 Separate analyses were conducted depending on the MVC outcome:
number of slight injuries, serious injuries, and deaths. The model includes a time variable, a
post-intervention dummy variable, and an interaction between the post-intervention dummy
and the time variable, to capture any change in trend. In particular, for each target series we
estimated the model presented in Equation (1).

𝑌𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝐷𝑡 + 𝛽3 (𝑡 × 𝐷𝑡 ) + 𝜀𝑡 ,

(1)

where 𝑡 is the time trend, 𝐷𝑡 is a dummy variable which takes the value 0 in the pre-lockdown
period and the value 1 in the post-lockdown period and 𝜀𝑡 is the error term assuming the
standard assumptions hold. 𝛽0 can be interpreted as the overall (baseline) level at time 𝑡 = 0,
𝛽1 can be interpreted as the pre-lockdown trend, 𝛽2 indicates the change in the level after the
lockdown and 𝛽3 indicates the change in the slope. The above model can be estimated assuming
Gaussianity or Poisson (which is the standard approach in population health evaluations where
the outcome is a count variable). The extended set of our results includes both approaches as
well as the Quasi Poisson which accounts for overdispersion, even if this does not seem to be
the case with our data.

years (panel A). The number of slight injuries started increasing after the lockdown but
remained below that of previous years throughout the study period. There is also a decrease in
the number of serious injuries, although the difference compared to previous years is not as
strong as in the case of slight injuries (panel B). Although in January 2020 the number of
serious injuries was larger than that in any of the previous five years, this figure remained much
lower than previous years’ levels during the first lockdown, and below or at the lower end of
the distribution in subsequent months. However, there is little or no evidence of any decrease
in deaths during the first lockdown or in the following months (panel C).

[Insert Figure 1 here]

We naturally divided our sample in the pre-lockdown period (from January 2015 to February
2020) and the post-lockdown period (from March 2020 to October 2020) and started our
exploratory data analysis (EDA) by investigating a simple time scatterplot for the three
underlying target series. A first look reveals that there seems to be a slight, and possibly not
statistically significant, break in the trend and a change in the direction of the slope for deaths
(𝑌1 ). This is more evident for serious injuries (𝑌2 ) and slight injuries (𝑌3 ) where there is a
downward shift in the entire line, with a simultaneous change in the slope (Figure 2).

[Insert Figure 2 here]

We extended our EDA by calculating the descriptive statistics for the full sample, as well as
the pre- and post- lockdown subsamples (Table 1). Table 1 includes various statistics evaluated
across the full, pre- and post- lockdown samples. We compared the means of the pre- and postlockdown samples employing a T-Test allowing for unequal variances. Even this simplified

approach indicates that there is a statistically significant decrease in the average level of serious
and slight injuries. In particular, serious injuries decreased by 33.89% on average (from 64.097
to 42.375; p-value=0.002) and slight injuries decreased by 41.99% on average (from 699.29 to
405.625; p-value=0.000). However, there is no statistically significant change in the number
of deaths (p-value=0.396).

[Insert Table 1 here]

Table 2 presents the ITS results for the three dependent variables. There is a simultaneous
change in the trend as well as the slope in the post-lockdown periods for serious injuries (Y2)
and slight injuries (Y3). In accordance with the results of the T-Test, there is no statistically
significant difference for the Deaths (𝑌1 ) series. However, we have a negative change in the
level after the lockdown (𝛽2 ) and an abrupt increase in the slope (𝛽3 ) for the Serious Injuries
(𝑌2 ) and Slight Injuries (𝑌3 ) series.

[Insert Table 2 here]

Figure A1 in the Appendix illustrates the autocorrelograms of the residuals from the
regression of each series. It is evident that there is no autocorrelation or obvious seasonality
patterns.
As an additional check, we also calculated an extended set of results including: NeweyWest HAC t-values and confidence intervals;21 Poisson distribution for the error term; and
Quasi Poisson Distribution to account for overdispersion. Results are presented in Tables A1,
A2 and A3 respectively, in the Appendix. In all cases, our qualitative conclusions about 𝛽2 and
𝛽3 still hold and confirm the results of the baseline ITS model.

3.2 The potential role of speeding on empty streets
Interestingly, while there was a steep decline in the number of injuries, there didn’t seem to be
any change in the number of deaths. Could this be a result of greater collision severity, due to
speeding on empty streets?6-7 Or could it be a result of increased alcohol consumption?12 Figure
A2 in the Appendix shows the trends in speeding fines and fines relating to driving under the
influence of alcohol or drugs in 2020 and previous years (before 2017 there did not seem to be
much testing for alcohol). There is a steep increase in speeding fines in May and June 2020
compared to years 2017-2019. This could be a result of increased traffic violations, or a result
of a greater police crackdown as a result of more speeding-related accidents. There didn’t seem
to be any relative increase in the number of alcohol and drug violations, possibly because
people were drinking more at home, as bars and restaurants were shut, or because they were
afraid of catching the virus there after they opened.

4. Discussion
This study shows that there has been an increase in MVC-related injuries in Northern Ireland
during the Covid-19 pandemic. There was a decrease in slight injuries in March-October 2020
(which largely coincided with the first lockdown and other social distancing measures) by
about 42%, reflecting reduced mobility during and after the lockdown.20 Serious injuries
demonstrated a reduction of about 34% over the same period. However, there was no
statistically significant change in the number of deaths as a result of collision. Interestingly,
while the total number of collisions was reduced, roughly the same number of people died as
would have been expected in the absence of the pandemic – raising interesting questions about
collision severity and reduced collision numbers.

This differential impact on the number of injuries and the number of deaths is likely to
be a result of speeding in less congested streets, due to reduced traffic volume during the
lockdown and the pandemic in general. Unfortunately, monthly data by cause of MVC were
not available. However, an increase in fines for speeding in May and June 2020 points in that
direction. Of course, the number of fines is affected by policing intensity – but even if there
was a crackdown on speeding particularly in May-June 2020, this would likely be a response
to increased speeding violations. Speeding can lead to more severe crashes, thus resulting in
death. Therefore, it appears that the negative impact of the reduced number miles travelled was
counterbalanced by higher speeds.
Another factor that may have not allowed the number of deaths to decrease is health
system capacity during the pandemic. As ambulances and hospitals were responding to large
numbers of Covid-19 patients, this may have led to a delay in treatment of MVC injuries, that
could lead to more fatalities that otherwise. However, it is important to note that this is just a
plausible explanation and this does not follow directly from the findings of this study. Future
research can examine whether health system capacity was in any way related to MVC fatalities
during the pandemic.
An increase in alcohol consumption reported elsewhere during the pandemic could also
have been a factor,12 but there was no evidence of an increase in fines relating to drunk driving.
It is possible that increased alcohol consumption was counterbalanced by drinking at home
rather than in pubs or restaurants, thus avoiding drink driving. It is not possible to examine the
role of any change in sleep duration and patterns with the data currently available. This can be
examined by future research.
Results of this study add to existing research on how the pandemic affected MVCs.
While there is consensus on a reduction in collisions,15-18 the results on fatalities are not always
in the same direction.2,19

Findings also provide additional evidence on the spillover effects of Covid-19 on other
health outcomes in Northern Ireland and elsewhere.22-27 Overall, this study highlights yet
another indirect consequence of the pandemic in the short run, but as people adapt their
behaviour, additional evidence will be needed to study the long-term effects on motor vehicle
collisions.
