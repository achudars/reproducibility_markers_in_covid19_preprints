Abstract The SARS-CoV2 virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic is manifesting itself in different ways among infected
people. While many are experiencing mild flue-like symptoms or are even remaining asymptomatic after infection, the
virus has also led to serious complications, overloading ICUs while claiming more than 2.6 million lives world-wide.
In this work, we apply AI methods to better understand factors that drive the severity of the disease. From the UK
BioBank dataset we analyzed both clinical and genomic data of patients infected by this virus. Leveraging positiveunlabeled machine learning algorithms coupled with RubricOE, a state-of-the-art genomic analysis framework for
genomic feature extraction, we propose severity prediction algorithms with high F1 score. Furthermore, we extracted
insights on clinical and genomic factors driving the severity prediction. We also report on how these factors have
evolved during the pandemic w.r.t. significant events such as the emergence of the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV2 virus strain.
Introduction
COVID-19, caused by the deadly “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV2) virus, is one of
the worst pandemic in human history inflicting severe casualties across the globe. So far, it has caused 117,332,262
confirmed cases while claiming 2,605,356 deaths worldwide1 . This virus has stressed many health systems beyond
their limits, screaming for an urgent reaction from research to help mitigate this unprecedented societal threat.
The outbreak of the virus first occurred in Wuhan province of China and then rapidly spread world-wide using humanto-human transmission2 . One of the primary reason for the rapid spread is due to the wide spectrum of symptoms
inhibited by the virus ranging from asymptomatic to mild to rapid progression to critical stage with pneumonia and
likely death of respiratory failure3 . In general, patients with mild symptoms cure easily whereas severe COVID-19
patients require further treatments such as ventilation in ICU. Such heterogeneity in terms of COVID-19 disease pose
great challenges for designing treatment protocols. Typically, severe effects of infectious diseases like COVID-19 are
hypothesized to be associated with the variations of host genome4 . Several studies5 were conducted recently to find
the biological mechanisms of the severity of COVID-19 diseases such as genome wide association studies (GWAS)
of severe COVID-196 . In addition, clinical factors such as demographic, socio-economic factors, lifestyles, prior
conditions may also have impact on the spread, exposure, and severity. So does the viral load of the SARS-CoV2
virus. The availability of rich electronic health records (EHR) provides an opportunity for finding such important
clinical factors associated with COVID-19 along with important clinical factors observed in EHRs3, 7, 8 .
Finding the bio-markers for severe COVID-19 patients requires rigorous study on clinical and genomic datasets. Most
of the existing studies that aimed at finding the common risk factors for severe COVID-19 patients focused on either the
clinical or the genomics factors, but not both. In this study, we aim to find the common risk factors associated COVID19 severity using diverse factors from both clinical and genomics data available from a large-scale EHR dataset. Such
kind of combined clinico-genomic factors can provide a holistic view of COVID-19 disease mechanisms. Specifically,
it can provide the additional effects of genomic factors on the host genome as they relate to common clinical factors.
However, there are few challenges in finding the clinical and genomic factors associated with COVID-19 that can be
used as bio-markers. First, defining the COVID-19 severity from EHR datasets is often challenging, since it is not
collected directly in these datasets. Hence, the severity has to be defined using some clinical knowledge as a surrogate
phenotype which in turn may introduce label noise and data collection bias. Second, assessing the impact of genomic
factors on COVID-19 severity may be confounded by several other clinical factors such as the prior comorbidities of
patients and treatment protocols. The effect of such confounding factors has to be addressed carefully when conducting
the combined clinico-genomic studies. Third, the impact of clinico-genomic factors may also vary depending on the
variations of diverse COVID-19 strains that have been observed due to genetic mutations.

In this study, we propose a combined framework for finding the clinical and genomic factors associated with COVID19 severity using a large COVID-19 dataset from the UK Biobank (UKBB). To address the above mentioned challenges, we first use the COVID-19 related hospitalization as a surrogate outcome for defining severe COVID-19 cases.
Second, we use a machine learning technique called positive-unlabeled (PU) learning to address the noise and reporting
bias present in COVID-19 severity labels. Moreover, we use a recently proposed genomic analysis framework entitled
RubricOE9 to select the set of genomic factors after adjusting for the common prior comorbid conditions which may
act as potential confounders. Finally, we aim to assess how the importance of the extracted bio-markers evolve over
the pandemic marked by event such as the emergence of the reportedly more contagious B.1.1.7 COVID-19 strain.
Method
Dataset
We analyzed the large prospective cohort of patients from the UK collected in the UKBB10 repository. The dataset
contains diverse information including demographics, diagnosis, medications, lab tests, and genomic information of
approximately half a million patients. In addition, the national SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test data were made available
in UKBB through the Public Health England (PHE). This COVID-19 dataset contains a flag indicating specimen
origin of COVID-19 tests: hospital inpatient origin vs other settings. It also notes the specimen collection date and
the specimen result in addition to a few other information about how the specimen was collected. Data were available
from March 16, 2020 and the repository has been updated once or twice every month. In our current study, we used
data from March 16, 2020 to January 21, 2021.
Preparing the outcome and feature sets
Although the COVID-19 dataset in UKBB is a prospective study, it did not collect the COVID-19 severity explicitly.
The nature of this dataset is very diverse depending on national testing strategy which evolved over time as the pandemic progressed. For example, UK testing was initially restricted to those with symptoms in hospital and thus under
this assumption, using the positive tests of these subjects in hospital can be a reasonable proxy for severity. However,
when the testings were expanded covering even asymptomatic patients from diverse facilities, defining the severity
required analyzing information regarding the specimen sources of test.
Among several different fields available in the COVID-19 table of our the UKBB, we settled on specimen origin and
specimen results to track severity. We have used a combination of these flags for disease severity under the assumption
that patients with a positive COVID-19 test obtained in hospital are likely to be severe cases. Table 1 contains the
number of unique patients who had at least one positive test result and at least one ‘inpatient’ indicator retrieved from
the origin field. We used inpatient samples COVID-19 patients (Origin=1 and result =1) as the severe COVID-19
patients while other COVID-19 patients (Origin=1 and result = 0) as the non-severe COVID-19 cases.
While this approach estimates severity, it may be prone to a selection bias problem by defining all inpatient COVID-19
patients as severe cases. For instance, some patients may have been hospitalized due to other conditions or may have
been experiencing other problems before they got the COVID-19 infection. To cope with aspects of this problem, a
separate field covering hospitalization-acquired infections was collected in the database to filter out such patients from
actual severe COVID-19 infection related hospitalization. However, this field was enabled in the dataset very recently
and the protocol for marking that field is not yet uniformly applied to all samples.
Another potential issue with the dataset pertains to defining the non-severe COVID-19 patient cohort. While hospitalization data for acute COVID-19 patients were collected carefully, the non-severe patients are harder to define. For

example, patients who were tested positively for COVID-19 in outpatients or non-urgent care service centers (Origin=0) may have experienced severe symptoms. The lone presence of the Origin flag set to 0 does not always mean
that patients did not have severe reaction at a later stage - they may not have been traced prospectively in the dataset.
Such tracing would most likely require conducting another test while being in an inpatient service. To cope with this
issue, we used a special class of machine learning to handle this kind of noise associated in the outcome labels.
To build our severity prediction models, we used several clinical and genomic features that may have an impact on
COVID-19 severity. For the clinical features, we manually curated some of the most relevant features which may have
association with COVID-19 for further analysis. Our clinical features include demographics, lifestyles, comorbidities
based on patient’s prior history, self-reports, and their chronic disease histories curated from prior inpatient records.
Selecting Genomic Features
Starting with 12,965 overlapping samples with genomic information in the UKBB COVID-19 dataset, we only retained
high quality imputed genomic markers in the form of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) with imputation quality
INFO score > 0.3, resulting in approximately 4.4 million SNPs. We further did a standard quality control (QC) for
filtering informative variants, removing SNPs as well as individuals with more than 2% of missing data. We further
filtered for Minor Allele Count (MAC) > 2, Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) > 0.05, sex discrepancy in individuals,
variants deviating by more than p < 1e − 6 in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for cases and p < 1e − 10
in controls. We also filtered for individuals with ±3 standard deviation in heterozygosity rates and very closely
related individuals (second degree). All of the QC analysis was done using PLINK v1.911 . We ended up with 12,389
individuals and 4,539,795 SNPs which passed all the QC thresholds. Of these 12,389 individuals, 4,000 were cases
with severe COVID-19 infection and 8,389 were controls or non-severe individuals who tested positive. We further
pruned for linkage disequilibrium (LD), removing correlated SNPs with r2 > 0.2 with a variance inflation factor of
10 on a window size of 50 kb. We used this pruned dataset for Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and applying
downstream algorithms to select stable features.

Genome-wide association study We performed a GWAS on the filtered dataset to perform a sanity check for the
QC analysis as well as observe significant loci associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection. GWAS was
performed by the package SAIGE12 , which accounts for case-control imbalance in the data. We performed genomewide association tests while correcting for known confounders in genomics such as population structure, sex and age.
We computed the top 20 principal components (PCs) with TeraPCA13 as a proxy for population structure and used
them as covariates along with the biomarkers14 .
Stable feature selection We applied RubricOE (learning rubric for multi-omics and genetic epidemiology), a framework for learning stable features discriminating cases from controls to understand significant SNPs associate with
COVID-19 severity. The rubric employs a nested test-training set configuration on the genomic data after QC and
pruning for LD. The outer test-training set split reserves the test set (“validation”) for final SNP evaluation and denotes the training set as “working” data. Within the latter, further train-test splits are performed to rank the features
by their Youden index15 (also known as J statistic). The pipeline of RubricOE is outlined in Figure 1. RubricOE is
applied on the genomic data, accounting for top 20 PCs, sex, year of birth and Diabetes Mellitus (DM) as covariates.
It iteratively finds a “stable” set of SNPs which persistently remains highly ranked with their respective Youden index.
Functional annotation
Annotation, Gene Ontology (GO) and enriched pathway analysis of the “stable” set of SNPs produced by RubricOE
has been evaluated using the R package clusterProfiler16 v3.12.
Framework
We used a predictive learning framework called Positive-unlabeled learning (PU learning) for extracting the most significant clinical and genomic features associated with COVID-19 outcome. Note that our dataset is more robust in
terms of defining the severe COVID-19 patients than the non-severe cases. Hence, using a classical binary classification algorithm will not be appropriate and able to cope with such noisy class labels. PU learning algorithms have
alternatively been reported to be especially suitable for learning from a noisy negative class by treating instances in
this class as unlabeled while predicting the positive class (severe COVID-19 cases).
PU learning is a variant of the classical binary classification problem, where it is assumed that the unlabeled examples
could belong to either positive or negative class. We refer to17 for a comprehensive review of such PU learning
techniques. Among several state-of-the-art PU learning techniques, we use PU Adapter18 , uPU19 , and nnPU20 for
learning the COVID-19 severity. All of these PU learning techniques have the basic assumption that the observed
samples are drawn uniformly from the positive distribution, which enables PU learning techniques to leverage standard
binary classification methods with minor modification of data or algorithm.
The PU-Adapter18 technique pre-processes the available PU data so that any standard binary classification method can
be used for learning on the PU dataset. In particular, this method reweighs the samples of PU data so that learning
a traditional binary classifier on the weighted samples yield to similar target probability threshold on the PU dataset.
Moreover, it has been shown that the classifier trained on positive and unlabeled examples predicts probabilities that
differ by a constant factor from the true probabilities of positive class. Unbiased PU learning (uPU)19 uses two separate
loss functions for the positive and unlabeled samples using convex optimization framework.
Evaluation
We evaluate the effectiveness of PU-learning algorithms with a comparison with baseline traditional classification
algorithm using logistic regression with a L1 loss. Computing traditional metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score,
and accuracy is challenging in the positive unlabeled scenario since the only information available relates to the positive
label while no sample from the negative class is clearly provided. One straightforward solution to this problem is to
assume that the unlabeled data are negative. However, this is not fully accurate. A modified F1 score (we call it as F1pu
r2
, where r is the recall and p(ŷ = 1)
score) has been proposed to address this issue21 . This score is computed as p(ŷ=1)
pu
21
is the prevalence of the predicted positive label. As shown in , the F1 score can take values greater than one but

shares the same property as F1 score; it is high when both precision and recall are high and small when either one is
small. We also report metrics used to evaluate traditional classification methods for completeness although these are
not recommended for our setting. They include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
We used a 5-fold cross-validation (CV) approach for evaluating the performances of the predictive models, where in each
CV fold, the hyper-parameter for L1 loss was tuned internally
using a grid-search over the range of [10−3 , 10−2 , 10−1 , 1, 10].
Finally, we used a bootstrapping technique for estimating the
confidence intervals of the scores using 100 bootstrapping runs
for finding the importance of the clinico-genomic features.

Discussion
Our final combined clinico-genomic model finds the significant features associated with COVID-19 severity (Figure

previous studies. For example, age and black ethnicity have been reported in8 , and prior conditions like diabetes
mellitus, hypertension have been reported in7, 22, 23 . Note that our study finds smoking status (past smoker, current

smoker, pack years of smoking) is related to severe COVID-19 patients, which has ambiguous evidence in literature.
A few studies8 reported it with increased risk factors, while others22 did not find it to be a significant risk factors for
COVID-19 severity.
In addition, our study found a few more features such as number of medication taken per day to be significant. Such
features are related to the overall health status of the patient and correlate indirectly to high severity risk factors.
Interestingly, distance from home to workplace has also been reported with lower risk of severity, which may be confounded by people commuting by car for longer distance instead of public transport or cycling for shorter commuting
distance.
The genomic features obtained from RubricOE are enriched in a host of biological pathways related to transmembrane
transporters and receptor activities (Figure 5(a)). The most significant is transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine
phosphatase which on increasing activity might affect T cells and contribute to their depletion and immunoparalysis
in severe COVID-19 patients24 . Other important pathways such as ion channel, metal ion and inorganic cation transmembrane transporter activities reaffirm the notion that SARS-CoV-2 E protein is a potential ion channel25 like other
coronaviridae26 . Focusing on the significant biomarkers from the combined model, we observed two new GO enriched terms, passive transmembrane transporter activity and PDZ domain binding (Figure 5(b)). It has been shown
that PDZ-containing proteins among binders of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins E, 3a or N affect viral replication under
knock-down gene expression in infected cells, significantly27 , particularly in the E protein28 .
The impact of clinico-genomic features can be confounded by different treatment protocols. However, our UKBB
dataset does not have direct information on COVID-19 drugs and detailed treatment protocols that a COVID-19 patient
went through, so we tried to assess the impact of a COVID-19 drug indirectly using its date of approval. In particular,
we assessed how the co-efficients of topmost features mentioned in Figure 2 change before and after the drug was
approved for treatment. As a simple use-case, we report the changes of impact of the top 25 biomarkers (instead of
all 50 due to space limitation) for the first approved UK drug called ‘Dexamethazone’ with its approval date as June
15, 2020 in Figure 3. We can observe that most of the 25 significant factors from the whole dataset still had similar
impact after the drug being used, but only 5 features had significant impact before the drug was used.
Similarly, we also wanted to assess how the impacts of clinico-genomic features change over different strains of SARSCoV-2. In the UK, a reportedly more contagious strain named B.1.1.729 started surfacing from early September 2020
and it is estimated that by December 2020, over 60% of new COVID-19 patients had the newer strain. The UKBB also

did not collect the virus genome prospectively. So the only way to assess the impact of clinico-genomic biomarkers is
through the date when a patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. We divided the whole cohort into three parts: those
diagnosed before Aug 31, 2020 (older strain), diagnosed between September 1st, 2020 and December 15, 2020 (both
strains) and after December 15, 2020 (newer strain). Figure 4 shows how the effect of the top clinico-genomic features
obtained by the global model change over these three cohorts. We can observe that some factors like age, prior DM
condition and number of medication are consistent across both strains, while the smoking history (current and present)
had larger impact on older strain than the newer strain. Such analysis of temporal trend of a factor’s impact on severity
can help elucidate important clinical insights.

To combat the global pandemic caused by COVID-19, scientists across different disciplines have been studying the
disease to understand various facets such as its spread, epidemiological and patho-physiological characteristics, and
societal impact. In this section we survey some of the most relevant literature.
Some of the more studied aspects of understanding the spread and clinical manifestations of the disease has been
focused on the viral and host genomic factors30 . To help consolidate and streamline the efforts around studying
the host genetics for susceptibility the COVID-19 Host Initiative was launched in mid 20204 with a primary focus on
disease severity. As part of this initiative, Hou et al.31 found that ACE2 or TMPRSS2 DNA polymorphisms were likely
associated with genetic susceptibility of COVID-19, while Li et al.32 found that genetic variants under a polygenic
model shows promising improvements in prediction accuracies and argued for greater investigation into polygenic
risk scores. Wang et al.33 presented further genetic insights into phenotypic difference among the COVID-19 patient
groups, highlighting genes and variants of interest. More superficially, they conducted both single-variant and genebased association with respect to five severity groups finding insights such as variants involved in IL-1 signaling
pathways to be of interest. While studies identified a gene cluster on chromosome 3 as a risk locus for respiratory
failure after infection with COVID-19, Zeberg et al.34 found that the risk is conferred by a genomic segment that is
carried by around 50% of people in South Asia and 16% of people in Europe.
Simultaneously, there has been concerted efforts to characterize the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 including
the patho-physiology and the risk factors for covid. Several large-scale meta-analysis studies were conducted either
on previous studies (Fu et al.3 ) or by summarizing published articles (e.g., Li et al.7 , Zheng et al.8 ) to identify com-

mon clinical symptoms and lab abnormalities among severe COVID-19 patients. Some common risk factors observed
among critical/mortal COVID-19 patients are socio-demographic information such as male, older than 65, smoking, and prior history of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases, kidney diseases, obesity,
immunosuppresion, and cancer. In addition to these prior conditions, depression as well as other cognitive and neurological disorders were also found as risk factors by a nationwide cohort study in Israel 22 , although this study found
that smoking and presence of respiratory diseases do not significantly increase the risk of complications. Williamson23
presented a risk analysis using a secure health analytics platform (OpenSAFELY) that covers 40% of all patients in
England. They found risk factors such as male, age, socio-economic deprivation, diabetes, severe asthma, and various
other medical conditions. They also found Black and South Asian people to be at higher risk. Research has also
been conducted to characterize risk among sub-populations such as obesity, heart failure, and Parkinson’s Disease35–37
concurrently. Mathew et al.38 found three immunotypes revealing different patterns of lymphocyte responses among
hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Besides finding such clinico-genomic risk factors of severe COVID-19, several machine learning (ML) and artificial
intelligence (AI) have also been applied successfully to solve a wide range of needs, ranging from fast ML based
COVID-19 infection prediction 39 to routine blood-tests40 as fast alternatives to costly and time-consuming PCR
tests41 to predicting disease state of individual cells given their transcriptomes42 .

Conclusion
In this study, we looked for significant clinical and genomic factors that are associated with severe reaction of SARSCoV-2 virus infection from a large-scale EHR and GWA dataset available from the UK. In particular, we used a special
class of machine learning called positive-unlabeled learning to address the challenge of noisy class label of COVID-19
severity outcome. Our holistic clinico-genomic modeling can potentially discover the effect of such factors in a robust
manner, which can be used as potential biomarkers for better clinical decision making. In future, we plan to further
investigate the effect of treatment protocols and vaccination on COVID-19 severity leveraging the inpatient data. Also,
investigating risk factors associated with COVID-19 induced death will be an important future research.
