Background: The need for rapid access to regularly updated patient data for hypothesis testing,
surge planning, and epidemiologic investigations underscore the value of updated registries that
clinicians, researchers, and policy makers can easily access for local and regional planning. We
sought to create an adaptive, living registry containing detailed clinical and epidemiologic and
outcome data from SARS-CoV-2-PCR-positive patients in our healthcare system.

Methods: From 03/13/202 onward, demographics, comorbidities, outpatient medications, along
with 75 laboratory, 2 imaging, 19 therapeutic, and 4 outcome-related parameters were manually
extracted from the electronic medical record of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. These parameters
were entered on a registry featuring calculation, graphing tools, pivot tables, and a macro
programming language. Initially, two internal medicine residents populated the database, then
professional data abstractors populated the registry. When the National Center for Immunization
and Respiratory Diseases released their COVID-19 case report form for public access, we
adapted it and used it on a browser-based, metadata-driven electronic data capture software
platform. Statistics were performed in R and Minitab.

At the time of this submission, 200,807 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests were performed on 107,604
distinct patients. 3699 (3.4%) of those have had positive results. Of those, 399 (11%) have had
the more than 75 parameters full entered in the registry. The average follow-up period was 25
days (range 21-34 days). Age, male gender, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease,
kidney disease, and cancer were associated with hospital admission (all p values < 0.01), but not
ICU admission. Statin, ACEI-ARB, and acid suppressant use were associated with admission (all
p values < 0.03). Obesity and history of autoimmune disease were not associated with need for
admission. Supplemental oxygen, vasopressor requirement, and outpatient statin use were
associated with increased mortality (all p values < 0.03).

A living COVID-19 registry represents a mechanism to facilitate optimal sharing of data
between providers, consumers, health information networks, and health plans through
technology-enabled, secure-access electronic health information. Our approach also involves a
diversity of new roles in the field, such as using residents, staff, and the quality department, in
addition to professional data extractors and the health informatics team.

However, due to the overwhelming number of infections that continues to accelerate, and
the labor/time intense nature of the project, only 11% of all patients with COVID-19 had all
parameters entered in the registry. Therefore, this report also offers lessons learned and discusses
sustainability issues, should others wish to establish a registry. It also highlights the local and
broader public health significance of the registry.

Background:
One dilemma in the attempt to deliver state-of-the-art therapeutics or understand

44

emerging novel infectious pathogens is that the most current data is not always rapidly accessible

45

to clinicians as soon as it becomes available. Hence, living systematic reviews have arisen as a

46

potential solution to narrow the gap between evidence and practice.1, 2

47

Along the same lines, having live access with continuous updates of a patient data base

48

using a standardized, well designed format and a user friendly, interactive software which allows

49

us to also to more rapidly hypothesis test or identify patterns relevant to prevention motivated

50

this effort. Additionally, data from one country or U.S. locality may not be generalizable to

51

others, and data and experience from non-university or rural settings may be underrepresented in

52

the medial literature, or not covered by media.3 Furthermore, rural areas are currently

53

experiencing some of the biggest increases in new SARS-CoV-2 infections. Fourth, on June 19,

54

2020, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine hosted a public meeting

55

on “Data Needs to Monitor the Evolution of SARS-CoV-2”. Presenters agreed that regional

56

surveillance nodes were needed. Last, the recently described “tragic data gap”, and the federal

57

curtailment of reporting COVID-19 data to the national Health Safety Network, also provided

58

motivation for this intervention.4 In the current climate, archiving detailed patient data in

59

retrievable, easily analyzable, and share-friendly formats has become crucial for informing

60

responses to current and future pandemics.4

61
62
63

Recent guidance5 and events6, 7 also underscore the added value having private,
nongovernmental alternatives for collecting and analyzing large scale epidemiologic data.

We sought to implement an adaptive, ‘living’ registry capable of capturing detailed

65

epidemiologic and clinical information from every patient diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2

66

infection, similar to and more granular than the Danish COVID-19 Cohort or TriNetX network.

67

Examples of the living approach include the living rapid reviews in the Annals of Internal

68

Medicine, and the living systematic review of the University of Toronto regarding secondary

69

infections in patients with COVID-19. However, these are literature reviews and not registries.

70

Our ultimate goal is to have a minable source of detailed information updated on an

71

ongoing basis, with minimal human effort, and linkable to SARS-CoV-2 whole genome

72

sequences, and other registries across the United States. Perhaps, becoming one of many extra-

73

governmental surveillance nodes in a regional or national network.

74

Methods:

75

The healthcare system consists of five acute care hospitals (ACH) and six long- term care

76

facilities (LCTF) totaling 1056 ACH and 800 LCTF beds. It spans eleven suburban, rural and

77

urban counties in the Finger-Lakes Region of NY. The first iteration of the registry was

78

completed on 04/11/2020. Collection dates ranged from the first patient diagnosed w/ SAR-

79

COV-2 on 03/13/2020 to the present.

80

In mid-March 2020, after the first case in our community, demographics, comorbidities,

81

outpatient medications, along with 75 laboratory, 2 imaging, 19 therapeutic, and 4 outcome-

82

related parameters were manually extracted from the electronic medical record of SARS-CoV-2

83

positive patients. These parameters were entered on a registry featuring calculation, graphing

84

tools, pivot tables, and a macro programming language. Initially, two internal medicine residents

85

populated the database, then professional data abstractors populated the registry.

86

All patients in the above healthcare system who had a positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2

87

from 03/13/2020 onward are included. At the time of this submission, 200,807 SARS-CoV-2

88

RT-PCR tests were performed on 107,604 distinct patients. 3699 (3.4%) of those have had

89

positive results. Of those, 399 (11%) have had the more than 75 parameters full entered in the

90

registry. The average follow-up period was 25 days (range 21-34 days).

91

When the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases released their

92

COVID-19 case report form (Last updated May 5th 2020, available at

93

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/reporting-pui.html) for public access, we

94

adapted it and used it on a browser-based, metadata-driven electronic data capture software

95

platform.

96
97

Statistics were performed in R and Minitab.
Results:

98

Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 1, with mortality associations in Table 2.

99

Age, male gender, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and cancer

100

were associated with hospital admission, but not ICU admission. Statin, ACEI-ARB, and acid

101

suppressant use were associated with admission as well. Obesity and history of autoimmune

102

disease were not associated with need for admission. Supplemental oxygen and vasopressor and

103

outpatient statin use were associated with increased mortality.

104

Discussion:

105

The registry revealed local patterns not apparent from less granular databased such as the

106

CDC or county/state health departments, or from reports of other populations. For example, the

107

average length of stay (LOS) for all admitted patients was 8 days (SD 8.6). The average LOS for

108

patients who did and did not require ICU-level care was 13.5 (SD 10.4) and 5.9 (SD 6.8),

109

respectively. This is significant because remdesivir was not available during the follow up period

110

for this initial cohort, and the LOS without it was already shorter than the 15-day outcome

111

measure used in the final report.8 Another example is a meta-analysis that found 5 studies, ACEI

112

or ARB use was associated with a lower risk for severe illness. According to the authors, those

113

results “do not provide enough evidence to draw conclusions about the potential efficacy of these

114

medications in treating COVID-19”.2 In contrast, we found use of angiotensin inhibitors and

115

angiotensin receptor blockers was higher in admitted vs. ED treated-and-released patients (p ≤

116

0.001). A third example involves a Chinese report which showed that statin treatment was

117

associated with lower mortality.9 However in our population, statin use was higher in admitted

118

patients compared to patients who did not require admission (all p ≤ 0.001). Statin use was also

119

higher in those who died than those who survived (Table 2) Last, in New York City, viral load

120

was correlated with risk of intubation, but in our more rural and suburban area, we observed that

121

viral load did not correlate with severity of illness.10, 11

122

Registry challenges, pitfalls, and threats to sustainability are presented in Table 3.

123

Manual data extraction into the original spreadsheet became prohibitively labor intensive and

124

analytically unmanageable as the number of new cases rapidly increased. Real-time abstraction

125

needed to be suspended for several weeks while contents were transferred to the metadata-driven

126

electronic data capture software platform. As of 06/14/2020, registry personnel were able to

127

manually populate all the parameters mentioned above from 11% (399) of the patients who

128

tested positive (236 ambulatory, 163 inpatient). Mean follow up period for that group for the

129

descriptive statistics presented below 25 days (range 21-34 days).

For diseases with lower incidence rates, the sustainability of the initial approach would

131

have been be achievable, but the approach became unsustainable given epidemic/pandemic-level

132

volumes of new cases daily and weekly. For optimal sustainability, 2 full time experienced data

133

extractors, automation and machine-based learning would be required.

134

Conclusion:

135

A living COVID-19 registry represents a mechanism to facilitate optimal sharing of data

136

between providers, consumers, health information networks, and health plans through

137

technology-enabled, secure-access electronic health information. Our approach also involves a

138

diversity of new roles in the field such as using residents, staff, and the quality department, in

139

addition to professional data extractors and the health informatics team.

140

However, due to the overwhelming number of infections that continues to accelerate,

141

and the labor/time intense nature of the project, only 11% of all patients with COVID-19 had all

142

parameters entered in the registry. Therefore, this report also offers lessons learned and discusses

143

sustainability issues, should others wish to establish a registry. It also highlights the registry’s

144

local and broader public health significance.

145

The registry is well suited to address a range of hypothesis and is being leveraged by

146

other researchers in our system. It provides a resource for researchers, policy makers, surge

147

planning, and ultimately linking detailed clinical-demographic data to whole genome sequencing

148

data for precision epidemiology. This approach has been successfully used to improve outcomes

149

for drug-resistant bacteria.12 Last, once established, the informatics algorithms and parameters

150

can be applied to patients infected with any high-consequence or novel pathogen.

Table 3: Considerations and Lessons Learned for Creating Registries
Exploratory registries generally enable broader and more comprehensive data capture than
objective registries, but the trade-off is manageability and time required.
Initial data points should be extrapolated from existing knowledge on similar medical
conditions to determine objective points, even if the overall nature of the registry is
exploratory.
The registry needs agility to be able to manage evolving or changing parameters as the
pandemic continues.
Manual data extraction requires at least 0.25-0.5 hours per chart for clinicians with health
informatics familiarity, and 0.5-0.75 hours per chart for professional data extractors with
limited clinical experience. For inexperienced user, it can take much longer.
For optimal sustainability, software compatible with the electronic medical record, automatic
data extraction, and machine-based learning are needed.
Extracting information from subjective documentation may lead to measurement bias.
Data points with binary (yes/no) answers, or with numerical mapping (1=CHF, 2=DM,
3=CKD etc.) are more amenable statistical analysis; free text data entry should be reduced.
The number of parameters or data fields increases labor requirements and decreases
manageability, but broadens the range and number of hypotheses that can be tested. Similarly,
as the number of abstractors increases, so does inter-observer variability.
Serial or consecutive values of a data point will not be consistently obtained unless there a
systematic or research protocol in place.
The platform on which the registry is created should provide data visualization tools in an

Collaboration between multiple health systems with other patient populations increases
generalizability of findings.
Clinicians need protected time to analyze data.
