Abstract:
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to infect millions of people worldwide. In order to
curb its spread and reduce morbidity and mortality, it is essential to develop sensitive
and quantitative methods that identify infected individuals and enable accurate
population-wide screening of both past and present infection. Here we show that Single
Molecule Array assays detect seroconversion in COVID-19 patients as soon as one day
after symptom onset using less than a microliter of blood. This multiplexed assay format
allows us to quantitate IgG, IgM and IgA immunoglobulins against four SARS-CoV-2
targets, thereby interrogating 12 antibody isotype-viral protein interactions to give a high
resolution profile of the immune response. Using a cohort of samples collected prior to
the outbreak as well as samples collected during the pandemic, we demonstrate a
sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 100% during the first week of infection, and 100%
sensitivity and specificity thereafter. This assay should become the gold standard for
COVID19 serological profiling and will be a valuable tool for answering important
questions about the heterogeneity of clinical presentation seen in the ongoing pandemic.

Main:
SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) is a novel betacoronavirus that has caused the coronavirus disease pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19) 1-3. In order
to identify infected individuals and contain the spread of the disease, rapid and accurate
population-wide screening is essential. Currently, nucleic acid based tests of nasopharyngeal
(NP) swabs are the primary method used to detect COVID-19 infected individuals 2. These tests
can only diagnose disease during a narrow window of active infection with an overall clinical
sensitivity of 65-72% 4. Thus, additional diagnostic methods are needed to identify those who
are or have been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Robust serological assays that can detect
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can fulfill this critical need. These assays could be used to
detect infected individuals who have tested negative by RT-PCR. Furthermore, serological
assays could be used to identify individuals who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and
were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, thereby providing a better understanding of how
widespread the virus is within a population. This information can aid epidemiologists in
determining a more accurate population prevalence of COVID-19.
Many serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) have been recently
developed to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, these assays have four important
limitations 4-15. First, they lack the ability to detect antibodies at early stages of infection.
Second, false positive results due to non-specific binding can occur attributable to high levels of
pre-existing antibodies in blood 16. Third, conventional ELISA assays can only analyze one
immunoglobulin for a specific target at a time, limiting their ability to profile and understand the
underlying immune response. Finally, these assays lack the resolution to quantify variations in
the immune response, which may be key in understanding clinical progression.

To address these limitations, we developed ultra-sensitive Single Molecule Array
(Simoa) assays for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies against four immunogenic
viral proteins, providing us with detailed information about early stages of immune activation 17.
Simoa provides up to 1,000-fold improvement in analytical sensitivity over standard ELISA 18,19.
This ultra-sensitivity enables samples to be highly diluted resulting in significantly reduced nonspecific binding. Additionally, unlike the standard ELISA, Simoa has a wide dynamic range and
allows precise quantification of multiple analytes over a concentration range of four orders of
magnitude. This feature is particularly important since antibody levels vary between different
stages of infection, and thus it is advantageous to have a single assay format that can
quantitatively differentiate between individuals with high and low antibody levels.
We measured the levels of all three immunoglobulin isotypes binding to the four viral
proteins in patients who were determined COVID-19 negative or positive by NP RT-PCR
testing. We also measured the immunoglobulins in plasma samples collected from patients
before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. By looking at two time points for each positive NP
RT-PCR patient, we were able to study the response of the immune system over time. We show
that these serological assays detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with high sensitivity and
specificity at both earlier and later stages of infection.
Developing an ultra-sensitive Simoa assay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies
We developed a multiplexed ultra-sensitive Simoa assay for detection of IgG, IgM, and
IgA against SARS-CoV-2 in human plasma. This multiplexed assay detects the binding of each
of the three immunoglobulin isotypes to four viral targets: Spike Protein, S1 subunit, Receptor
Binding Domain (RBD), and Nucleocapsid, enabling the quantification of 12 binding interactions.
In this assay format (Figure 1), four types of dye-encoded paramagnetic beads are each coated
with one of the four SARS-CoV-2 targets. The coated beads are then incubated with diluted

heat-inactivated plasma samples for capture of immunoglobulins on the beads. A large excess
of beads is used compared to the number of immunoglobulin molecules in the sample, such that
either zero or one immunoglobulin molecule binds to each bead. After immunoglobulin capture,
the beads are incubated with a biotinylated anti-human immunoglobulin antibody specific to a
single immunoglobulin isotype. Finally, the beads are incubated with the enzyme streptavidin-βgalactosidase (SβG), which binds to the biotinylated anti-human immunoglobulin antibody,
forming a complete enzyme-labeled immunocomplex. The beads are then resuspended in
resorufin β-D-galactopyranoside (RGP), a fluorogenic substrate, and loaded onto an array of
femtoliter-sized wells in which only one bead fits per well. The wells are sealed with oil and a
locally high concentration of the fluorescent product is generated. This enables single molecule
detection of immunoglobulins by counting active wells. The ratio of active wells to the total
number of beads is determined for each target, and the Average Enzymes per Bead (AEB) is
calculated, providing a digital readout for each immunoglobulin isotype against each antigen.
During the assay development process, we ensured optimal performance of the
serological Simoa assays at several different steps. We produced and purified the SARS-CoV-2
Spike protein and the smaller RBD (Methods section and Supplementary Figures 1 and 2),
while the Nucleocapsid and S1 proteins were obtained commercially. We quantitatively
validated viral target conjugation to the bead surface using anti-His tag antibodies as well as
recombinant human anti-RBD antibody, as described in the Supplementary Information
(Supplementary Figure 3). The detector antibody for each immunoglobulin isotype was selected
from a panel of antibodies to optimize the performance of the assay (Supplementary Tables 13). Finally, we performed spike-and-recovery and dilution-linearity experiments using
recombinant human immunoglobulins to demonstrate assay precision and validity.
(Supplementary Figure 4 and Supplementary Table 4). The Simoa assays show excellent
linearity and recoveries ranging from 85-103%.

Detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in patient samples using Simoa
We used the Simoa serological assay to test 81 plasma samples from Massachusetts
General Hospital (MGH) in Boston, MA, USA. This sample cohort consisted of three groups: (1)
patient plasma collected before the COVID-19 outbreak, (2) plasma collected during the
pandemic from patients presenting with symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 at the Emergency
Department (ED) with a negative NP RNA test, and (3) serial plasma samples collected during
the pandemic from patients who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and were
hospitalized for COVID-19. Clinical characteristics of each patient group are shown in
Supplementary Table 5. Figure 2A shows IgG, IgM, and IgA levels in COVID-19 positive
samples, which were divided into five subgroups based on the number of days after symptom
onset. In addition, Figure 2A shows the immunoglobulin levels in the pre-pandemic group and
the NP RT-PCR negative group. Samples were measured at two different dilution factors and
similar results were observed (Supplementary Figure 5). Plasma samples measured at a 4000x
dilution factor show that all four viral antigens elicit an IgG, IgM, and IgA immune response in
COVID-19 positive patients. All twelve combinations (i.e. each of the four viral targets against
each of the three immunoglobulins) show an overall increase in immunoglobulin levels over the
course of the disease. Only one patient had a decrease in immunoglobulin levels; this person
did not survive their infection with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, a separate patient who displayed
low immunoglobulins levels at the late time point was on immunosuppressive medication.
To study the ability of the serological Simoa assays to detect seroconversion early
relative to symptom onset, we separated the results of the COVID-19 positive samples into two
sub-groups. The first group consists of data from early time points, in which samples were
collected in the first week following symptom onset. The second group consists of data from late
time points, in which samples were collected after the first week of symptom onset. We
assessed the performance of the IgG, IgM, and IgA Simoa assays using multivariate analysis

for each of the early and late time point groups compared to the pre-pandemic group. Figure 2B
shows the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for IgG, IgM, and IgA against all four
viral targets. For the early time point group, IgA had the highest area under the curve (AUC) at
0.95 followed by IgG at 0.93 and IgM at 0.87. The sensitivity of the IgA assay was 81% during
the first week at 100% specificity. Moreover, the AUC values for all three immunoglobulins
improve for the late stage group with IgA at 1, IgG at 1, and IgM at 0.998.
Next, we plotted the ROC curves for each of the 12 viral target and immunoglobulin
combinations to understand which viral antigens are critical to measuring the immune response
by classifying between COVID-19 positive groups and pre-pandemic groups (Supplementary
Figure 6). The Spike protein gave the highest sensitivity and specificity for each immunoglobulin
subtype at early time points, with a calculated AUC of 0.94, 0.93 and 0.85 for IgA, IgG and IgM
respectively. The Spike IgA assay yielded the best classification when comparing the prepandemic group to the COVID-19 positive group for early time points.
A major advantage of the Simoa serological assay is that one sample provides
information on all three immunoglobulin responses to four viral proteins compared to a
traditional ELISA where only a single interaction can be interrogated. Therefore, based on our
analysis in Supplementary Figure 6, we sought to assess the sensitivity and specificity of a
combination of IgA and IgG assays against spike protein for early time points. We performed a
multivariate analysis using only the combination of IgA and IgG Spike assays and were able to
achieve a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 100% for identifying patients within the first
week of symptom onset and 100% sensitivity and specificity for identifying patients after the first
week of symptom onset (Figure 3). We also assessed the positive predictive values (PPV) and
negative predictive values (NPV) of the combined Spike IgA/IgG assays for the two groups
(Figure 3B). As the true prevalence of COVID-19 in the population is unknown, varies among
countries, and is rapidly changing, we calculated these values for a range of prevalence values
(Figure 3B). We also sought to evaluate whether patients who tested negative for COVID-19

had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens in their blood. These individuals were tested
by NP RT-PCR since there was clinical suspicion that they may have been infected with the
virus. Interestingly, when assessing this RT-PCR COVID-19 negative group, 9 of the 19 patients
were above the seroconversion threshold. This result is in line with the RT-PCR tests having a
reported clinical sensitivity between 65-72% 4. It is possible that these patients with negative
RNA test results were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and were seroconverting.

Discussion
Quantitative and sensitive SARS-CoV-2 serological assays are necessary to address
unmet needs in the clinical setting, epidemiological studies, as well as therapeutic and vaccine
development. Using the Simoa technology, we developed a highly sensitive serological assay
for detection of IgG, IgM, and IgA in COVID-19 patients against four SARS-CoV-2 targets.
These assays were optimized for use on an automated commercially-available instrument,
which enables rapid, reproducible and high throughput results. The ultra-sensitivity enables
plasma to be diluted 4000x allowing for improved classification of COVID19 patients, likely due
to negligible nonspecific binding. Furthermore, at this dilution factor our dynamic range spans
four orders of magnitude, allowing for quantification of the full range of disease from early to late
stage. This dilution factor requires a sample volume of less than 1L plasma, potentially
enabling wide scale epidemiological testing with a finger prick sample collection method or dried
blood spots.
Since the clinical sensitivity of current RT-PCR tests is approximately 70%, it was crucial
to establish a true negative sample group in addition to the negative NP RNA test group. Our
analysis includes samples collected from U.S. adults presenting to the MGH Travel and
Immunization Center prior to traveling internationally. These samples were collected JanuaryDecember 2019 before introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the U.S. Although we cannot comment
on active non-SARS-CoV-2 coronoviridae infection nor previous exposure to such viruses

among these individuals, such viruses are a common cause of respiratory tract infections. Our
results suggest no significant cross reactivity of antibodies to our selected target antigens prior
to the COVID-19 outbreak, indicating minimal cross reactivity among coronaviridae in our assay.
In our dataset, IgA and IgG showed superior performance for early seroconversion
detection. However, the samples we used were heat inactivated, which has been shown to be
detrimental for serological assays and particularly the ability to detect IgM antibodies 20. It will be
important to investigate whether using non-heat inactivated plasma or serum can yield higher
sensitivity for the IgM assay, potentially leading to improved acute stage diagnosis. In addition,
since our assay provides detailed and high-resolution information about the immune response
to different SARS-CoV-2 antigens, the assay format should enable us to predict neutralization
potential of convalescent plasma.
Using a combination of IgG and IgA responses to spike protein, we are able to achieve a
sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 100% during the first week of infection when comparing
COVID-19 positive patients to pre-pandemic controls. This sensitivity increased to 100% and
the specificity remained at 100% for COVID-19 positive patients tested one week after symptom
onset. This early detection of seroconversion is unmatched by current commercial tests or
published laboratory data. Additionally, the resolution of our method enables us to probe small
variations in the immune response between patients and within a single patient. The Simoa
serological platform provides a powerful analytical tool that will benefit future research in
understanding the immune response to COVID-19 by enabling the analysis of antibody
response at the early stages of the disease and throughout disease progression with high
resolution. A comprehensive analysis of the immune response can provide critical insights
necessary for the development of therapeutics and vaccines.

Methods
Plasma samples:
Clinical samples were obtained from patient presenting to the Massachusetts General
Hospital with viral respiratory symptoms. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by RT-PCR on
nasopharyngeal specimen. Additional plasma samples collected from healthy adults prepandemic (January –December 2019) prior to travel internationally were also included in the
analysis. All samples were collected under approval of the Institutional Review Board for Human
Subjects Research at Massachusetts General Hospital. Human plasma samples were heat
inactivated (56C for 60 minutes). Samples were hand diluted in sample buffer to their final
dilution factor which varied for each experiment, as described in the results section. All sample
measurements had two technical replicates which were averaged.

RBD Expression and Purification
SARS-2 RBD (GenBank: MN975262.1) was cloned into pVRC vector for mammalian
expression (FreeStyle 293F or Expi293F suspension cells). The construct contains a HRV 3Ccleavable C-terminal SBP-His8X tag. Supernatants were harvested 5 days post-transfection and
passaged directly over Cobalt-TALON resin (Takara) followed by size exclusion
chromatography on Superdex 200 Increase (GE Healthcare) in 1x phosphate-buffered saline.
Typical yields from FreeStyle 293F cells are approximately 9 mg/liter culture. Affinity tags were
removed using HRV 3C protease (ThermoScientific) and the protein repurified using CobaltTALON resin to remove the protease, tag and non-cleaved protein. RBD sequence and
purification validation are provided in the Supplementary Figure 1.

Preparation of a stabilized ectodomain of Spike protein
To express a stabilized ectodomain of Spike protein, a synthetic gene encoding residues
1−1208 of SARS-CoV-2 Spike with the furin cleavage site (residues 682–685) replaced by a

“GGSG” sequence, proline substitutions at residues 986 and 987, and a foldon trimerization
motif followed by a C-terminal 6xHisTag was created and cloned into the mammalian
expression vector pCMV-IRES-puro (Codex BioSolutions, Inc, Gaithersburg, MD). The
expression construct was transiently transfected in HEK 293T cells using polyethylenimine.
Protein was purified from cell supernatants using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen), the eluted fractions
containing S protein were pooled, concentrated, and further purified by gel filtration
chromatography on a Superose 6 column (GE Healthcare), following a protocol described
previously 21. Negative stain electron microscopy (EM) analysis was performed as described 22.
Additional information is provided in Supplementary Figure 2

Bead Coupling & Verification
Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 antigens (Nucleocapsid, RBD, S1 and Spike) were coupled
to four types of dye-encoded 2.7 µm carboxylated paramagnetic beads (Quanterix) using EDC
(1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride) chemistry (ThermoFisher
Scientific 77149). The Nucleocapsid and S1 antigens were sourced commercially
(Nucleocapsid: Ray Biotech 230-30164 and S1: Sino Biological V0591-V08H). The Spike and
RBD antigens were produced in the labs of Bing Chen and Aaron Schmidt, respectively, as
described above. 2.8 × 108 beads were washed three times with 200 µL of Bead Wash Buffer
(Quanterix), three times 200 µL of Bead Conjugation Buffer (Quanterix), and then resuspended
in 300 µL of Bead Conjugation Buffer. Immediately prior to use, 10 mg of EDC was reconstituted
in 1 mL of Bead Conjugation Buffer. To activate the beads for conjugation, EDC was added to
the bead suspension and the beads were agitated on a HulaMixer (ThermoFisher Scientific) for
30 minutes at 4C. After activation, the beads were washed once with 200 L of Bead
Conjugation Buffer, and then resuspended in 300 L of Bead conjugation buffer containing the
antigen. Beads were agitated on the HulaMixer for 2 hours at 4C. The antigen-conjugated

beads were washed two times with 200 L of Bead Wash Buffer, and then blocked with BSA
(Bovine serum albumin) for 30 minutes at room temperature in 200 L of Bead Blocking Buffer
(Quanterix). The blocked beads were washed with 200 L of Bead Wash Buffer, 200 L of Bead
Diluent (Quanterix), and resuspended in 200 L of Bead Diluent. The amount of recombinant
protein and EDC used in each reaction are as follows: Nucleocapsid (20g antigen, 2L EDC),
RBD (20g antigen, 6L EDC), S1 (20g antigen, 6L EDC), and Spike (16.67g antigen, 6L
EDC). Nucleocapsid, Spike, S1, and RBD were conjugated to 488 nm, 647 nm, 700 nm, and
750nm dye-encoded beads, respectively. Beads were counted using a Beckman Coulter
Particle Counter and stored at 4C.
Antigen coupling to the beads was confirmed by an anti-His tag assay for Spike, S1, and
nucleocapsid beads and by an anti-RBD assay for RBD beads (Supplementary figure 3). For
spike, S1, and nucleocapsid, confirmation of antigen attachment to the beads was
demonstrated by Simoa with His tags experiments using a biotinylated anti-His tag antibody
(ThermoFisher MA121315BTI) on the HD-X Analyzer (Quanterix). The anti-His-tag antibody
was plated at concentrations of 0.1 pg/mL to 10,000 pg/mL using tenfold dilutions. RBD was
provided without a His-tag, therefore RBD beads were used as a control against the anti-His tag
antibody assay. RBD conjugation to beads was confirmed by Simoa with an anti-RBD antibody
(clone CR3022) and a biotinylated anti human-IgG antibody (Bethyl Laboratories A80-148B).
Nucleocapsid beads were used as a control for these experiments due to the ability of anti-RBD
antibody binding to RBD, S1, and full Spike protein but not nucleocapsid.

Biotinylation
Detection antibodies for IgA, IgG and IgM were purchased from Thermo Fisher, Bethyl
Laboratories, Abcam, Biolegend, and R&D systems (see Immunoglobulin Simoa assay format)
and were biotinylated for use in Simoa assays as described previously by Cohen et al 23. Briefly,

the antibodies were passed through an Amicon filter three times in Biotinylation Reaction Buffer
(Quanterix). Antibody concentrations were determined using NanoDrop One
Spectrophotometer. Antibodies were conjugated to biotin using EZ-Link NHS-PEG4 Biotin
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) by resuspending NHS-PEG4-Biotin in dionized H2O. For all
immunoglobulins a NHS-PEG4-Biotin was added in 40x molar excess and incubated for 30 min.
All biotinylated antibodies were then purified using three washes in an Amicon filter.

Immunoglobulin Simoa assay format
Simoa experiments were performed in an automated three-step assay format onboard
the HD-X Analyzer (Quanterix Corp) as described in Rivnak et al 24. Human plasma samples
were diluted in Homebrew Detector/Sample Diluent (Quanterix). Anti-human immunoglobulin
antibodies were diluted in Homebrew Detector/Sample Diluent to final concentrations of: IgG
(Bethyl Labratories A80-148B): 7.73ng/mL, IgM (Thermo Fisher MII0401): 216ng/mL, IgA
(Abcam ab214003): 150ng/mL. Streptavidin--galactosidase (SβG) concentrate (Quanterix) was
diluted to 30 pM in SβG Diluent (Quanterix). System Wash Buffer 1, System Wash Buffer 2,
Resorufin -D-galactopyranoside (RGP), and Simoa Sealing Oil were purchased from Quanterix
and loaded onto the HD-X Analyzer per the manufacturer’s instructions. In the first step of the
assay, 25L of the four SARS-CoV-2 antigen-coupled multiplex beads were incubated with
100L of diluted human plasma for 15 minutes. The total number of beads used per reaction
was 475,000 (125,000 each of Nucleocapsid, RBD, and S1 beads and 100,000 of Spike beads).
After incubation, six wash steps were performed with System Wash Buffer 1. In the second
step, the beads were resuspended in 100 L of the respective biotinylated anti-human
immunoglobulin antibody and incubated for 5.25 minutes, and then washed six times with
System Wash Buffer 1. In the third step, the beads were resuspended in 100L of SβG,
incubated for 5.25 minutes and washed six times. The beads were resuspended in 25 L of

RGP before being loaded into the microwell array for analysis. Following bead loading, the
microwell array was sealed with oil and imaged in five optical channels. Average Enzyme per
Bead (AEB) values were calculated by the software in the HD-X Analyzer.

Data Analysis
Duplicate measurements per sample were obtained for each of the twelve
immunoglobulin and viral target combinations. The average of duplicate measurements was
calculated and the data was then log transformed. Logistic regression analysis was conducted
in R version 3.6.2 for the multivariate analysis and Graphpad Prism 7 for the univariate
analysis25. All figures were plotted in Graphpad Prsim 7, Igor Pro7 and Adobe Illustrator version
2015.

Figure 1. Schematic illustration of the Simoa serological assay
Inactivated plasma is incubated with four types of dye-encoded beads that are each coupled to
one of four viral antigens (Spike, S1, Receptor Binding Domain, and Nucleocapsid). IgG, IgA,
and IgM antibodies specific to the SARS-CoV-2 antigens bind to the viral antigen coated beads.
After washing, beads are introduced to biotinylated anti-human immunoglobulin antibodies to
label either IgG, IgM, or IgA in the different reactions. After additional washes, the enzyme
streptavidin-β-galactosidase (SβG), is introduced. The beads are washed, resuspended in
fluorogenic resorufin β-D-galactopyranoside (RGP) and loaded into a 216,000 microwell array
for multicolor imaging.

Figure 2. Profiling seroconversion in COVID-19. a) Simoa serological assay results for IgG,
IgM, and IgA against the four viral targets: Spike, S1 subunit, Receptor Binding Domain, and
Nucleocapsid for pre-pandemic samples (light blue, n=20), NP PCR negative samples (dark
blue, n= 19) and COVID-19 positive samples (red, n=21, two timepoints each). The COVID-19
positive samples were divided into five groups according to time since symptom onset. Black
lines indicate the mean AEB (average enzyme per bead) value of each population.
b) Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for all four antigens against IgA, IgG, and
IgM. Each ROC graph is plotted for COVID-19 disease within one week of symptom onset (red,
n=21), and for later stage COVID-19 (maroon, n=21) each against the pre-pandemic cohort (left,
n=20). AUC values and 95% confidence interval are presented in the table (right).
