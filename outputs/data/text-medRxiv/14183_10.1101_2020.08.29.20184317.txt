Abstract
Importance The healthcare demand created by the COVID-19 pandemic was far beyond the
hospital surge capacity in many countries, resulting in possible negative influence on
prognosis of other severe diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD).
Objective To assess the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on CVD-related hospitalizations
and mortality.
Design Community-based prospective cohort study.
Setting the UK Biobank population.
Participants 421,717 UK Biobank participants who were registered in England and alive on
December 1st 2019.
Main outcomes and measures The primary outcome of interest was CVD death, as deaths
with CVD as a cause of death according to the death registers. We retrieved information on
hospitalizations with CVD as the primary diagnosis based on the UK Biobank hospital
inpatient data. The study period was between December 1st 2019 and May 30th 2020, and we
used the same calendar period of the three preceding years as the reference period.
Standardized mortality/incidence ratios (SMRs/SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals were
used to estimate the relative risk of CVD outcomes during the study period, compared with
the reference period, to control for seasonal variations and aging of the study population.
Results We observed a distinct increase in CVD-related deaths in March and April 2020 as
compared to the corresponding months of the three preceding years. The observed number of
CVD death (n=217) was almost doubled in April, compared with the expected number
(n=120), corresponding to an SMR of 1.81 (95% CI 1.58-2.06). We observed a sharp decline

of CVD hospitalization in March (n=841) and April (n=454), compared with the expected
number (n=1208 for March and 1026 for April), leading to an SIR of 0.70 (95% CI 0.65-0.74)
for March and 0.44 (95% CI 0.40-0.48) for April. There was also a clear increase of death, but
a clear decrease of hospitalization, in March and April for all the five major subtypes of CVD.
Conclusions We observed a distinct excess in CVD deaths in the beginning of the COVID-19
outbreak in the UK Biobank population. In addition to CVD complications of SARS-CoV-2
infections, the reduced hospital capacity might have contributed to the observed excess CVD
deaths.

Key Points
Question How did the COVID-19 outbreak affect rates of CVD-related death and
hospitalization?
Finding In this prospective study involving 421,717 UK Biobank participants, we observed
excess CVD-related mortality in parallel with decreased CVD-related hospitalization in the
beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, March and April 2020.
Meaning In addition to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection progressing to CVD-related death,
reduced hospital resources might have partially contributed to the excess CVD mortality.

Background
Since the first case of the Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) in December 2019, the
potent contagious disease has spread rapidly all over the globe, with profound influences on
the global economy and population health1. As of August 20202, with almost 18 million cases
and approximately 700,000 deaths, COVID-19 has brought tremendous pressure to the
healthcare service systems worldwide. The healthcare demand created by the COVID-19
pandemic is far beyond the hospital surge capacity in many countries, including in the US and
the UK3. As a result, in addition to insufficient ascertainment and treatment of COVID-19, the
severe shortage of medical resources might have considerable impact on patients with other
severe diseases. Yet, data illustrating the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on prognosis of
other severe diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), are limited4.
Here, taking advantage of a community-based sample in the UK Biobank with timely and
continuously updated longitudinal data on various health outcomes, we estimated the
potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on CVD-related death and hospitalization.

Methods
Study design
Based on the UK Biobank cohort, which has been described in details elsewhere5, we
included participants (n=421,717) who were registered in England and alive until December
1st 2019, as the inpatient hospital data during the COVID-19 outbreak are currently not
available for participants in Scotland and Wales. The study was approved by the biomedical
research ethics committee of West China Hospital (reference number: 2020.661).
The primary outcome of our interest was CVD death, which was defined as a death with

CVD as a death cause according to the International Classification of Diseases [ICD]-10
codes I00-I70, I730, and I74-I756, based on linked data from the death registers updated until
May 30th 2020. In sub-analyses, we focused on five major subtypes of CVD, including acute
myocardial infraction, arrhythmia, essential hypertension, heart failure and stroke (ICD codes
shown in Supplementary Table 1). The study period was between December 1st 2019 and May
30th 2020. To take into account seasonal variations in CVD mortality7, we used the same
calendar period of the three preceding years, as the reference period.
Because COVID-19 patients with cardiovascular comorbidity are more likely to
experience fatal outcomes8 and infection of SARS-CoV-2 leads to cardiac injuries9,10, we in a
separate analysis excluded individuals with confirmed COVID-19 who died of CVD (i.e.,
with a positive COVID-19 test according to data from Public Health England, a hospital
admission for COVID-19 according to the UK Biobank hospital inpatient data, or a cause of
death concerning COVID-19 according to data from the death registers).
As a proxy for access to healthcare for severe CVD during the outbreak, we retrieved
information about hospitalizations with inpatient diagnoses of CVD from the UK Biobank
hospital inpatient data. Hospitalization for CVD was defined as a hospital admission with
CVD as the primary diagnosis during the study period.
We further considered CVD diagnosed before December 1st 2019 as history of CVD,
according to the UK Biobank hospital inpatient data.

Statistical analyses
We first calculated the monthly numbers of CVD death between December 1st 2019 and May
30th 2020. We also calculated the mean monthly numbers of CVD death in the corresponding

six months during the three preceding years. To further account for aging, we calculated the
expected age-standardized monthly numbers of CVD death for the study period by
multiplying the numbers of persons by the average age (1-year strata)-, sex-, and
month-specific mortality rates derived from the same period of the three preceding years (i.e.,
the reference period), based on the same population. The standardized mortality ratios
(SMRs), i.e., the ratio of the observed to the expected number of CVD deaths, with its 95%
confidence interval6 was then used to estimate the relative risk of CVD death, comparing the
study period to the reference period. We further performed separate analyses for five major
subtypes of CVD, as well as subgroup analyses by history of CVD. We performed the same
analyses, including calculations of standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), for CVD
hospitalization. All analyses and graph drawing were carried out using R version 3.4.0.

Results
We observed a sharp increase in the number of CVD death in March and April but not in May
2020, compared with the corresponding months of the three preceding years (Figure 1A and
Supplementary Table 2). After taking into account aging of the population during the four
years of observation, the observed number of CVD (n=217) was almost doubled, compared
with the expected number (n=120), in April (Figure 1B), corresponding to an SMR of 1.81
(95% CI 1.58-2.06) (Figure 1C). After excluding CVD deaths with confirmed COVID-19, we
observed a diminished but still statistically significant increase in March (SMR decreased
from 1.38 [95% CI 1.17-1.6] to 1.19 [95% CI 1.00-1.40]) but not in April (SMR=0.97, 95%
CI 0.80-1.15) (Figure 1C).

We observed a rapid decline of CVD hospitalization from March onward, compared with
January and February 2020 (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 3). For both rates of CVD
death and hospitalization, the pattern did not differ substantially by history of CVD
(Supplementary Figure 1). Figure 3 shows the monthly numbers of CVD death and
hospitalization for the five major subtypes of CVD. In general, during the six-month study
period, the rates of death peaked for almost all five subtypes of CVD in March or April
(Figure 3A). The peak in CVD mortality diminished to some extent, but remained evident,
after excluding CVD deaths with confirmed COVID-19 (Figure 3B). In contrast, the rates of
CVD hospitalization were lowest during March or April for all five subtypes of CVD (Figure
3C).

Discussion
Based on analyses of a large community-based cohort study using the UK Biobank data, we
found a considerably increased risk of CVD-related deaths, while in parallel a significantly
reduced rates of CVD hospitalization, in March and April 2020. This matches the exponential
growth of COVID-19 cases in the UK during the time (e.g., from 35 to 25,521 from
beginning to the end of March), suggesting that the shortage of healthcare resources for
regular CVD care might have partially contributed to the excess CVD mortality. Similarly, the
fear of accessing health care by patients in need might have led to delayed treatment,
contributing further to an increase in CVD death. Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection has been
associated with cardiac injuries11 which may also contribute to the increased CVD-related
mortality. However, after exclusion of CVD deaths with a known COVID-19, the excess

CVD mortality remained statistically significant in March, especially among participants
without history of CVD. The null result in April might reflect the greater spread of COVID-19
affecting individuals more prone to fatal cardiovascular events in April than March12. Further,
the greater risk of CVD death in March and April, compared with May when the COVID-19
was still largely spreading in the UK, implies that other factors, such as severe emotional
stress reactions to the COVID-19 outbreak which have been demonstrated as a trigger for
CVD incidence and mortality in relation to other stressful life events6, may also contribute to
the observed excess deaths of CVD.
The major merit of our study is the self-comparison analysis, contrasting the numbers and
rates of CVD death and hospitalization during the study period (COVID-19 outbreak), with
the corresponding numbers and rates of a reference period (the same calendar period during
the three preceding years), using the UK Biobank population as the same study population.
This analysis adjusted inherently for potential confounders that are constant over time,
including genetic factors and many environmental factors that did not change greatly within
the 4-year period. Other influential factors, such as seasonal variation and aging of the study
population, were well controlled by monthly-based estimations and calculation of
standardized expected numbers and SIRs.
The notable limitations of this study include the fact that accessibility to COVID-19 test
in the UK was largely restricted to inpatients with symptoms before May 2020. Consequently,
we might have under-estimated number of deaths related to COVID-19 in March and April. In
addition, the UK Biobank population is not representative of the general population in the UK.
It therefore requires cautions when generalizing our findings to the whole UK population or

other populations.

Conclusions
Excess deaths from CVD were observed in the UK Biobank population in March and April
2020. CVD complications of COVID-19 but also decreased capability of hospital healthcare
system might have contributed to the observed excess risk of CVD death.
