Abstract
Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated worldwide investigation into a
myriad of potential therapeutic agents, including corticosteroids. The first RCT reporting
results on the impact of systemic corticosteroids on COVID-19 in a peer reviewed journal
was the RECOVERY trial published in July, 2020. The RECOVERY trial showed a reduced
risk of 28-day mortality in patients who received oral or intravenous dexamethasone for
10 days.
This study is a meta-analysis of peer reviewed RCTs aims to estimate the association of
systemic corticosteroid therapy compared to the usual care or placebo on all-cause
mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Software based tools to accelerate the
analysis process.
Methods: Meta-analysis of peer reviewed RCTs comparing systemic corticosteroids to
usual care or placebo.
Results: Five English language RCTs were identified, including data from 7645 hospitalized
patients worldwide using systemic dexamethasone, hydrocortisone and
methylprednisolone in COVID-19 positive patients. Three RCTs were discontinued when
preliminary results from the RECOVERY trial became available.
Meta-analysis of all identified RCTs showed no difference in survival in patients who
received systemic corticosteroid therapy compared to usual care or placebo (Odds ratio
0.82, 95% CI 0.64-1.05, p = 0.09). Subgroup analysis from the 1967 critically ill patients in
the identified RCTs showed improved survival in patients who received systemic
corticosteroid therapy (Odds ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.51-0.87, p = 0.01).
Conclusions: This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials published in peerreviewed literature by January 1, 2021 showed reduced mortality in critically ill patients
but not all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received systemic corticosteroids. The
early termination of three of the included RCTs because of the preliminary results of the
RECOVERY trial is likely to have dramatically influenced the results of this meta-analysis.
Further research is needed to clarify the role of systemic corticosteroid therapy in the
management of COVID-19.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated worldwide investigation into a myriad of potential
therapeutic agents. COVID-19 can cause highly elevated levels of inflammatory markers
such as C-reactive protein, ferritin, GM-CSF, IL-1 and IL-6 1,2. Corticosteroids can inhibit
this inflammatory response at the cost of increasing the risk of nosocomial and
opportunistic infections and worsening the course of COVID-19 3,4,5,6. Because of these
concerns, early guidelines for COVID-19 treatment stated that systemic corticosteroids are
contraindicated or not recommended 7,8.
Observational and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were immediately initiated to
evaluate the impact of systemic corticosteroids on COVID-19. The first RCT reporting
results in a peer reviewed journal, RECOVERY, was published in July, 2020 9.
RECOVERY trial showed that 6mg of oral or intravenous dexamethasone for 10 days
reduced the risk of 28-day mortality from 26% to 23% for all patients hospitalized due to
COVID-19. Critically ill patients showed a greater mortality reduction from 41% to 29%.
The positive results of the RECOVERY trial led to the suspension of most ongoing trials
evaluating corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19.
A prospective meta-analysis conducted by the WHO Rapid Evidence Appraisal for COVID19 Therapies (REACT) Working Group evaluating the role of systemic corticosteroids in the
treatment of COVID-19 was published on October 6, 202010. The REACT meta-analysis
included data from the RECOVERY trial and partial data from 6 other RCTs showing a
summary odds ratio of 0.66 (95% CI 0.53-0.82, p < 0.001). This indicates a reduced risk of
death in patients with COVID-19 treated with systemic corticosteroids.
A more conventional meta-analysis by van Paassen et al. reviewed data from RCTs and
observational studies11. It included data from 5 RCTs and 17 observational studies
showing a summary odds ratio of 0.72 (95%CI 0.57–0.87, p = 0.002) indicating a reduced
risk of death. The odds ratio with only RCTs was 0.84 (95%CI 0.69-0.99, p = 0.213),
showing no clear impact on the risk of death in a pooled sample of 7645 patients.
This meta-analysis of peer reviewed RCTs aims to estimate the association of systemic
corticosteroid therapy compared to the usual care or placebo on all-cause mortality in
hospitalized patients with COVID-19. This study utilized software based tools to accelerate
the analysis process.
Methods

Data management and statistical analysis was conducted with R version 4.0.2. Metaanalysis calculations and plots were generated using the meta (version 4.15-1) and metafor
(version 2.4-0) packages for R.
The protocol for this meta-analysis was registered and published in the PROSPERO
database (CRD42020224991) on December 8, 202014.

Identification of trials

Trials were identified by searching MEDLINE using the search terms COVID-19,
corticosteroids, and steroids. The results of these searches were exported and filtered via
the RobotSearch tool by Vortext Systems to identify randomized controlled trials12. The
filtered results were reviewed for inclusion criteria and evaluated for bias via the
RobotReviewer tool that applies the Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) tool to the full text of
articles13. ClinicalTrials.gov will also be searched to identify any other published trials.
Inclusion criteria for this study were: randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing
systemic corticosteroids to other treatments or placebo in hospitalized adults with COVID19 infections published by January 1, 2021 in an English language MEDLINE-indexed peer
reviewed journal.

Meta-analysis
A random-effects meta-analyses using the Paule-Mandel estimate of heterogeneity was
used to determine odds ratios. The Hartung-Knapp adjustment was used to address
uncertainty in the estimates of between-study variance in the random-effects metaanalysis.
Inconsistency in associations were evaluated using the I2 statistic and the Cochran Q
statistic. Exact p values are reported.
Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were plotted for each trial to evaluate the
association between corticosteroid therapy compared with usual care or placebo to the
outcome measure.
Meta-analysis of the trials reporting data on critically ill patients included all trials where
intensive care unit (ICU) admission was an eligibility criteria and the data on the patients
who were on invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) at randomization in all other trials.
Meta-analysis of trials reporting data on non-critically ill patients excluded all trials where
ICU admission was an eligibility criteria and the data on the patients who were not on IMV
at randomization in all other trials.

Outcomes
The primary outcome evaluated for this meta-analysis was all cause mortality up to 30
days after randomization. Shorter timeframes were acceptable if 30 day survival data was
not available.

Results

The search strategy identified five English language RCTs with results published in peer
reviewed literature (Figure 1). These 5 RCTs included data of 7645 hospitalized patients
from Australia, Brazil, Canada, the European Union (EU), New Zealand, UK and the USA
(Table 1). These studies used systemic dexamethasone, hydrocortisone and
methylprednisolone in COVID-19 positive patients. These interventions were compared to
placebo (2 RCTs) or usual care (3 RCTs). Three RCTs were discontinued when preliminary
results from the RECOVERY trial became available.

CAPE COVID Trial
The CAPE COVID trial (NCT02517489) enrolled 149 critically ill patients with a high rate of
invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) at time of enrollment (81%) in a placebo-controlled
trial to evaluate the impact of continuous intravenous hydrocortisone for 8-14 days on 21day mortality. The average age in this study was 62 years and 30% of participants were
women. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by laboratory testing in 97% of participants.
The risk of bias in this placebo-controlled RCT was assessed to be low. This study showed
no difference in mortality between the intervention and control groups (15% vs. 27%, p =
0.06). This trial was discontinued in June 2020 when preliminary data from the RECOVERY
trial became available15.

CODEX Trial
The CODEX trial (NCT04327401) enrolled 299 critically ill patients on IMV at time of
enrollment in an RCT to evaluate the impact of intravenous dexamethasone for 10 days on
28-day mortality. The average age in this study was 61 years and 37% of participants were
women. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by laboratory testing in 96% of participants.
This study has some risk of bias because treatment was not blinded. This study showed no
difference in mortality between the intervention and control groups (56% vs.61%, p =
0.85). This trial was discontinued in June 2020 when preliminary data from the RECOVERY
trial became available16.

METCOVID Trial
The METCOVID trial (04343729) enrolled 393 hospitalized patients with a moderate rate
of IMV at time of enrollment (34%) in a placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the impact of
twice daily IV methylprednisolone for 5 days on 28-day mortality. The average age in this
study was 55 years and 35% of participants were women. COVID-19 infection was
confirmed by laboratory testing in 81% of participants. The risk of bias in this placebocontrolled RCT was assessed to be low. This study showed no difference in mortality
between the intervention and control groups (37% vs.38%, p = 0.629)17. The METCOVID
trial was not identified in the PUBMED search, but was found in searching
ClinicalTrials.gov. METCOVID was PUBMED indexed at the time of our search.

RECOVERY Trial
The RECOVERY trial (NCT043881936) enrolled 6425 hospitalized patients with a low rate
of IMV at time of enrollment (16%) in an RCT to evaluate the impact of oral or intravenous
dexamethasone for 10 days on 28-day mortality9. The average age in this study was 66
years and 36% of participants were women. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by
laboratory testing in 89% of participants. This study has some risk of bias because
treatment was not blinded. This study showed a statistically significant difference in
mortality between the intervention and control groups (23% vs.26%, p < 0.001).

REMAP-CAP Trial
The REMAP-CAP trial (NCT02735707) enrolled 379 hospitalized patients with a moderate
rate of IMV at time of enrollment (55%) in an RCT to evaluate the impact of intravenous
hydrocortisone for 7 days on 21-day mortality18. The average age in this study was 60
years and 29% of participants were women. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by
laboratory testing in 72% of participants. This study has some risk of bias because
treatment was not blinded. This study showed no difference in mortality between the
intervention and control groups (28% vs. 33%, p not reported). This trial was discontinued
in June 2020 when preliminary data from the RECOVERY trial became available.

Association Between Systemic Corticosteroids and All-Cause Mortality In
Critically Ill Patients In Identified RCTs
The CAPE-COVID, CODEX, and REMAP-CAP trials only included critically ill patients. The
METCOVID and RECOVERY trial patients who were on IMV at randomization were includedd
in this meta-analysis. In critically ill patients there were 322 deaths in the 895 patients
randomized to receive systemic corticosteroids compared with 484 deaths in the 1072
patients randomized to the control groups. The random effects meta-analysis showed a
summary odds ratio of 0.67 (95% CI 0.51-0.87, p = 0.01, Figure 3). Heterogeneity
assessment shows an I2 of 0% (p = 0.58).

Association between Systemic Corticosteroids and All-Cause Mortality In NonCritically Ill Patients In Identified RCTs
Only the METCOVID and RECOVERY trial included non-critically ill patients. In this
population there was 406 deaths in the 1908 patients randomized to receive systemic
corticosteroids compared with 846 deaths in the 3770 patients randomized to the control
groups. The random effects meta-analysis showed a summary odds ratio is 0.95 (95% CI
0.75-1.19, p = 0.21, Figure 4). Heterogeneity assessment shows an I2 of 0% (p = 0.79).

Discussion

This meta-analysis of five RCTs included data of 7645 hospitalized patients from Australia,
Brazil, Canada, the European Union (EU), New Zealand, UK and the USA. This study did not
show a clear association between systemic corticosteroid treatment in COVID-19 patients
and 28-day mortality in critically ill and non-critically ill patients.
Data from the 1967 critically ill patients in the identified RCTs showed improved survival
in patients who received systemic corticosteroid therapy (Odds ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.510.87, p = 0.01). These correspond well to the meta-analysis by Pasin et al. of 888 patients
on IMV from the CODEX, METCOVID and RECOVERY trials (Odds ratio 0.85, 95%CI 0.72-1,
p = 0.05)19.
Data from the non-critically ill patients in the METCOVID and RECOVERY trials showed no
impact on mortality (Odds ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.75-1.19, p = 0.21).
This study has several important limitations. The focus on English language publications in
peer reviewed literature by January 1, 2021 can cause a significant bias by underrepresenting the full spectrum of research in this rapidly evolving field. Remarkably, these
5 trials were conducted and published within 9 months of the World Health Organization
declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic on March 11, 2020. The results of additional RCTs
evaluating the use of systemic corticosteroids in COVID-19 have been published on preprint servers and it is reasonable to expect these and other studies to be published in peerreviewed literature. Because of this rapid pace of research and the promising potential

impact of systemic corticosteroids on outcomes in COVID-19 infection, this meta-analysis
will be updated on a regular basis.
Treatment for COVID-19 has evolved considerably since the initiation of these studies. This
can be clearly seen in the prevalence of other COVID-19 therapies outlined in table 2.
The literature search and assessment methods used for this study were computer assisted,
which differs from traditional meta-analysis techniques that are time and effort consuming.
This strategy has the potential to introduce bias in the identification of RCTs. However, this
methodology identified the same trials and did produce similar results (no statistically
significant impact on survival) to a prospective meta-analysis conducted by the REACT
Working Group and the van Paassen et al. meta-analysis 10,11. The failure to identify the
METCOVID trial in the PUBMED search for this meta-analysis underscores the importance
of including at least one other type of search in future meta-analysis projects.
The REACT prospective meta-analysis included data of 1703 patients, in comparison to this
meta-analysis which included data of 7645 patients, due to the inclusion of complete
enrollment and outcomes data from three RCTs that contributed interim results to the
REACT meta-analysis and the results of an additional RCT. The results of this meta-analysis
are similar to the results of the prospective meta-analysis (Odds ratio 0.82 (95% CI 0.641.05), p = 0.09 vs. Odds ratio 0.70, (95% CI 0.48-1.01), p = 0.053). Results of the DEXACOVID-19 and Steroids-SARI studies included in the REACT meta-analysis were not
published in the MEDLINE-indexed peer-reviewed literature by January 1, 2021.
The traditional search strategies in the van Paassen et al. meta-analysis identified the same
studies identified in this meta-analysis. Results were nearly identical to the results in this
study (Odds ratio 0.82 (95% CI 0.64-1.05), p = 0.09 vs. Odds ratio 0.84 (95% CI 0.69 –
0.99), p = 0.213). The slight differences between the results of these two meta-analyses is
most likely due to differences in the software used for the analysis (R with the meta and
metafor packages vs. Stata).
Systemic corticosteroid therapy showed a statistically significant reduction in mortality for
critically ill patients (Odds ratio 0.67, p = 0.01) but not for all hospitalized patients (Odds
ratio 0.82, p = 0.09). The termination of three of the five included RCTs after the
preliminary results of the RECOVERY study were published is a significant confounding
factor with these results. This may have led to an underestimation of the impact of
systemic corticosteroids on mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
Conclusions

This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed literature
by January 1, 2021 showed reduced mortality in critically ill patients but not all
hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received systemic corticosteroids. The early
termination of three of the included RCTs because of the preliminary results of the
RECOVERY trial is likely to have dramatically influenced the results of this meta-analysis.
Further research is needed to clarify the role of systemic corticosteroid therapy in the
management of COVID-19.
