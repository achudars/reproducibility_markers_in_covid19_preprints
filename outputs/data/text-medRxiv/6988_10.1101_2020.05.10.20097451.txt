Abstract
Background. ​As the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, there is increasing global
interest in the role of serological testing for population monitoring and to inform public policy.
However, limitations in serological study designs and test standards raise concerns about the
validity of seroprevalence estimates and their utility in decision-making. There is now a critical
window of opportunity to learn from early SARS-CoV-2 serology studies. We aimed to
synthesize the results of SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance projects from around the world and
provide recommendations to improve the coordination, strategy, and methodology of future
serosurveillance efforts.
Methods. ​This was a rapid systematic review of cross-sectional and cohort studies reporting
seroprevalence outcomes for SARS-CoV 2. We included completed, ongoing, and proposed
serosurveys. The search included electronic databases (PubMed, MedRXIV, BioRXIV, and
WHO ICTPR); five medical journals (NEJM, BMJ, JAMA, The Lancet, Annals of Internal
Medicine); reports by governments, NGOs, and health systems; and media reports (Google
News) from December 1, 2019 to May 1, 2020. We extracted data on study characteristics and
critically appraised prevalence estimates using Joanna Briggs Institute criteria.
Results. ​Seventy records met inclusion criteria, describing 73 studies. Of these, 23 reported
prevalence estimates: eight preprints, 14 news articles, and one government report. These studies
had a total sample size of 35,784 and reported 42 prevalence estimates. Seroprevalence estimates
ranged from 0.4% to 59.3%. No estimates were found to have a low risk of bias (43% high risk,
21% moderate risk, 36% unclear). Fifty records reported characteristics of ongoing or proposed
serosurveys. Overall, twenty countries have completed, ongoing, or proposed serosurveys.
Discussion. ​Study design, quality, and prevalence estimates of early SARS-CoV2 serosurveys
are heterogeneous, suggesting that ​the urgency to examine seroprevalence may have
compromised methodological rigour. Based on the limitations of included studies, ​future
serosurvey investigators and stakeholders should ensure that: i) serological tests used undergo
high-quality independent evaluations that include cross-reactivity; ii) all reports of serosurvey
results, including media, describe the test used, sample size, and sampling method; and iii)
initiatives are coordinated to prevent test fatigue, minimize redundant efforts, and encourage
better study methodology.

Lessons from a rapid systematic review of early SARS-CoV-2 serosurveys
Introduction
As the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in SARS-CoV-2 serology testing
and immunity studies is increasing. Serology (also known as antibody) testing represents an
opportunity to systematically monitor the spread of symptomatic and asymptomatic
SARS-CoV-2 infection,​ identify disproportionately affected populations, and study protective
immunity. M​any policymakers, public health officials and employers are contemplating the role
of serosurveillance in strategies to reopen society.​1

Several countries and organizations - including the World Health Organization, with its
Solidarity II program - have begun ramping up serological testing efforts.​2,3​ However, limitations
in serological study designs and test standards raise concerns about the validity of seroprevalence
estimates and their utility in decision-making. Shortfalls in the first wave of SARS-CoV-2
nucleic acid diagnostic testing (including poor test sensitivity and specificity, lack of distribution
at scale, and inconsistent testing protocols), and the associated public outcry, serve as a
cautionary tale for efforts to implement antibody-based screening.​4

There is now a critical window of opportunity to learn from early SARS-CoV-2 serology studies.
This paper presents results from a rapid ​up-to-date systematic review and synthesis of the results
of SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance projects from around the world and provides recommendations
to improve the coordination, strategy, and methodology of future serosurveillance efforts.

Article Screening and Data Extraction
Pairs of reviewers pilot screened 50 articles and extracted 5 articles in duplicate. All subsequent
screening and data extraction was completed by one reviewer and verified by a second. Data on
study characteristics, participants, and prevalence estimates were extracted. Discrepancies were
resolved by discussion.

Critical Appraisal
The estimates were critically appraised using the Joanna Briggs Checklist for Prevalence
Studies.​7​ Two authors applied the criteria independently and in duplicate. Discrepancies were
resolved by discussion. Based on these criteria, an overall risk of bias assessment was provided
(i.e., low, moderate, high, unclear). The criteria were used to assess the extent to which
systematic bias may have been introduced, the nature of the potential bias, and the magnitude of
the potential bias. See Supplementary File 1 for additional notes regarding how the checklist was
adapted for use in this rapid review.

Data Presentation
All data were presented on a publicly accessible online platform, which can be accessed at
serotracker.com​. We designed built-in filters that allow users to sort prevalence estimates by
region (i.e., states, provinces) and population (i.e., age, sex, health care workers, long term care
residents, people aged 65+, people with chronic diseases/multi-morbidity). To contextualize each
prevalence estimate, the total number of confirmed cases per one million population for the
country on the start date for the study was extracted from Worldometer’s COVID-19 tracker.​8

Results
A total of 1,845 titles/abstracts and 1,267 full-text articles were screened, of which 70 were
included for analysis (Figure 1).
Figure 1: ​PRISMA Flow Diagram

Seventy-three studies were found, reported in 70 articles. Twenty-three studies reported
prevalence estimates (eight preprints, 14 news articles, and one government report). The vast
majority of these studies (n=20/23, 87%) were in the United States and Europe. These studies
had a total sample size of 35,784 and reported 42 prevalence estimates; 26 were final estimates
and 16 were preliminary. Reported seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.4% to 59.3%
(Summary in Table 3; full results in Supplementary Table 5). Fifty additional studies were
identified that intend to conduct 2.45 million tests and have not yet reported findings; most of
these studies are also in the United States and Europe (Supplementary Table 6).

For populations with multiple prevalence estimates, only the most recent fully-adjusted estimate was included; 95% confidence intervals were included in
parentheses if they were reported. ​b​Overall risk of bias (high, medium, low, unclear) was determined by considering all Joanna Briggs Institute criteria for
prevalence estimates (5), and using these criteria to guide an assessment of the extent, nature, and magnitude of systemic bias, and reflects the extent to which the
estimated prevalence may deviate from the true prevalence value. ​High:​ Limited certainty in the prevalence: the true prevalence may be substantially different
from the estimated prevalence. ​Moderate: ​Moderate certainty in the prevalence: the true prevalence is likely to be close to the estimate, but there is a possibility
that it is substantially different. ​Low: ​High certainty in the prevalence estimate: true prevalence is likely close to the estimate. ​Unclear:​ There was insufficient
information to assess risk of bias.

Overall, 14 countries have reported estimates from completed or ongoing studies, with six
additional countries having proposed studies (Figure 2). Various stakeholders have taken the lead
on these studies, including federal and regional governments, universities, health systems,
businesses, and cooperative efforts (Table 4). Estimates used a range of test types, including
ELISAs and lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs), and examined a variety of antibodies including
IgG alone, IgG and IgM, or IgG, IgM, and IgA.

No estimates were found to have a low risk of bias (43% high risk, 21% moderate risk, 36%
unclear). ​Study bias was predominantly attributed to inadequate sampling methods and antibody
test performance (Supplementary Figure 3). Non-random sampling (e.g., self-referral) or a
non-representative sampling frame (e.g., blood donors) characterized 61% of studies, and fewer
than half of prevalence estimates were obtained from an appropriately sized sample (calculation
in Appendix 1).​6​ Onl​y two ​studies reported using tests with the United States FDA recommended
minimum sensitivity and specificity (90% sensitivity, 95% specificity).​7​ The remainder used tests
that failed to meet both thresholds (sensitivity 63.3% to 100%; specificity 90.63% to 100%) or
failed to report test accuracy.

A full list of references for included studies is provided in Supplementary Table 7.

Discussion
This rapid systematic review of SARS-CoV-2 serosurveys found twenty-three studies reporting
data and fifty proposals for upcoming studies. Study design, quality, and results were
heterogeneous. This snapshot of initial serosurveys suggests that ​the urgency to examine
seroprevalence may have compromised methodological rigour and hence the validity of
prevalence estimates. These early efforts to measure seroprevalence provide important insights
on study design and coordination that will be critical to inform upcoming initiatives.

Minimum standards of reporting
Serosurvey reports did not provide adequate information on their methods. Only 15 studies
(65%) reported the test used, with only nine (39%) reporting test sensitivity and specificity. All
reports of serosurveys, whether in published articles, preprints, grey literature or the news media,
should meet minimum reporting standards.​9​ This includes the prevalence estimate itself, with
confidence intervals and sample size; test name and characteristics; the dates and populations
that these estimates apply to; and the sampling method.

Of course, the reporting standards for academic articles should be more rigorous. But in these
unprecedented times, news articles are being used to rapidly report preliminary study results.​10​ It
is therefore essential that these sources also provide the information needed to interpret their
findings. If news agencies don’t hesitate to report on the findings of serological tests, then they
shouldn’t hesitate to give their readers the complete picture.

Serological test performance
While the advent of new immunoassays detecting antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is welcome, the
emergency conditions of the pandemic do not justify overlooking a thorough assessment of assay
accuracy. As the recent experience in the UK reveals, rapid procurement of antibody tests only to
find they are sub-standard represents an inefficient use of scarce public resources and risks
undermining public confidence.​11

Assessment of test characteristics relies on independent evaluation against a reference panel.
Reference panels should include three key features: standardized positive and negative controls
for the disease; a sufficient number of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples at different stages of
infection, from day zero through 40+; as well as negative samples that have been exposed to
other viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-1, MERS and other viruses) to test for cross-reactivity.​12

While independent evaluation of tests by a standards agency like the FDA is the norm, there is
considerable variation in the way reference panels are prepared between agencies and hence
standards are set. For example, the US FDA’s Emergency Use Authorization Pathway for
serological tests requires the submission of test results on only 30 positive and 80 negative sera,
and considers cross-reactivity against HIV but not other coronaviruses.​7

Meanwhile, a variety of groups have conducted independent evaluations of SARS-CoV-2
antibody tests utilizing different volumes and types of sera in their reference panels.​13–15
Investigators from UCSF included SARS-CoV-2 positive sera at multiple time points from
infection and negative sera as part of the test evaluation for their study,​13​ while Danish study
investigators included robust assessment of cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses and
respiratory viruses.​14​ FINDDx is leading an ongoing independent evaluation program of 27 rapid
diagnostic tests and seven ELISAs. Their evaluation should be commended for using large
samples (100 positive and 100-300 negative sera) at multiple time points from symptom onset,
but does not not appear to mandate cross-reactivity testing to ensure test specificity.​15

Sensitivity and specificity thresholds for serology tests are a function of the prevalence of
infection. As many have pointed out for initial seroprevalence results, 90% specificity may seem
high, but can lead to as many false positives as true positives if prevalence is low. Insofar as
evidence of infection correlates with decreased risk of re-infection - a variable of interest to
guide decisions on re-opening society - there is a need to minimize false positives. As a result,
the specificity threshold for SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests has moved towards 99%.

While the discussion of serology test characteristics has focused on specificity, sensitivity is also
crucial. False negatives cannot be ignored, and are more likely in tests conducted soon after
infection due to lower IgG antibody levels.​13​ There is a direct trade-off between sensitivity and
specificity, and both are important to accurately assess population-level seroprevalence. To
minimize false negatives, standards for sensitivity should also move towards 95%. Recent
evaluations of commercial tests suggest that the market appears in a position to meet these higher
specificity and sensitivity standards, which augurs well for serosurveys moving forward.

Justify test choice and sampling method
Test selection can be complex and should be based on an overall testing strategy. Deciding
between ELISAs, LFIAs, and other assay types requires considering the characteristics of the
intended testing population. ELISAs require venous blood draws, making them easiest to deploy
in hospitalized populations and long-term care facilities, and permit blood banking for future
analysis.​16​ However, venipuncture may not be feasible in certain vulnerable populations,
including people experiencing homelessness, in low-resource settings with poor access to care,
or remote areas. LFIAs and paper blot assays are slightly less accurate, but are less invasive and
less expensive alternatives that may better represent these groups.​16

Few of the studies reviewed reported a rationale for their testing approach. Even of the eight
included preprints, where one might expect the most thorough reporting, only three studies
justified their choice of antibody test. When test choice was discussed, investigators and
academics cited the lack of commercially available tests as a driving factor.

Less than half of studies so far have used an appropriate sample frame and random sampling
method, with other studies using sampling designs that may oversample the young (recruiting
through Facebook ads), healthy (blood donors), and high-SES groups (daytime drive-through
testing).​17,18​ Adjusting estimates for population structure can provide a small degree of correction
with large samples, but should not be substituted for strong sampling design. For example, the
Santa Clara seroprevalence study weighted their sample by geography, sex, and race, but did not

have a sufficiently large sample size to also weight by age, so seniors remained underrepresented
in their weighted sample (4.5%) compared to the population (12.9%).​17

In aggregate, there are few reports of seroprevalence in populations at high risk for SARS-CoV-2
infection,​ including lower socioeconomic status, older adults, people with comorbidities, and
incarcerated populations. ​T​he first wave of studies was primarily focused on the general public,
with a​ second wave of studies now emerging to study front line workers (e.g., health care
providers, police officers).

COVID-19 has disproportionately affected marginalized populations; the UK and US are
reporting higher in-hospital mortality rates for black and minority ethnic groups and seniors
living in long term care facilities appear most at-risk everywhere.​19,20​ Moving forward, more
appropriate sample frames tailored to the highly uneven and inequitable distribution of
COVID-19 (as revealed by nucleic acid tests of acute infection) are needed to obtain more
representative estimates of seroprevalence.

The need for coordinated efforts
So far, serosurvey efforts have been scattered and partially overlapping. For example, the US
National Institutes of Health is offering voluntary enrolment to citizens from all US states,​21
overlapping with myriad state, municipality, university, and health system driven initiatives
(Table 4) - each of which cover variable populations in terms of size and demographics.

Concurrently, private corporations such as Amazon and Barrick Gold are beginning to source
hundreds of thousands of tests for their own employees, with no reported plans on how they will
analyze and share seroprevalence data.​22​ Some test manufacturers are selling direct to consumer
antibody test kits and private labs are offering pay-to-play testing, enabling people to self-refer
for testing and potentially never disclose the result.

This lack of coordination could have two major consequences. Firstly, participants may develop
test fatigue, wherein they are repeatedly offered antibody testing by multiple stakeholders and,
after having received one result, refuse to participate in larger programs using higher quality tests
that would yield more valuable and accurate results. Secondly, results obtained by a patchwork
of stakeholders may never be reported and synthesized, meaning no one party will have a
complete picture of the SARS-CoV-2 serology landscape.

Central registries of seroprevalence initiatives, and minimum regulatory standards on
methodology and reporting, would coordinate efforts without stifling the autonomy of
stakeholders eager to roll out antibody testing. These tools would make it possible to generate
data that can be meaningfully compared and combined. They may also conserve resources by
limiting duplication, allowing organisations to learn from each other, and integrating findings
from nucleic acid and antibody testing to track active and past infections alike. Although central
governance or partnerships can be slow to initiate, this disease may persist--and long-term
problems require long-term solutions.

Limitations
This review had some limitations. Firstly, it is possible that articles were missed by only
searching one academic database of peer-review articles. That said, the supplemental search
included five high-impact journals, two pre-print databases, and a trial registry. Secondly, we did
not conduct article screening or extraction using two independent authors. However, we
pilot-tested screening and extraction in duplicate to strengthen reliability. Furthermore, a second
author verified screening decisions and extracted data.

Conclusions
The world is entering the next phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic - attempting a return to
normalcy. The ability to accurately map seroprevalence patterns will be a key feature of this
phase as scientists determine the relationship between antibody levels and immunity, and as
decision-makers consider policies to ease restrictions on movement and reopen economies.

We should enter this phase armed with the lessons from early serosurveys: namely, that we need
to raise the bar on seroprevalence testing initiatives and we need to do it together.
