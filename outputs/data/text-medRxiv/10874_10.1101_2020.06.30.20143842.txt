Data From the COVID-19 Epidemic in Florida Suggest That Younger Cohorts Have
Been Transmitting Their Infections to Less Socially Mobile Older Adults

Abstract
We analyzed the daily incidence of newly reported COVID-19 cases among adults aged
20-39 years, 40-59 years, and 60 or more years in the sixteen most populous counties of the state
of Florida from March 1 through June 27, 2020. In all 16 counties, an increase in reported
COVID-19 case incidence was observed in all three age groups soon after the governor-ordered
Full Phase 1 reopening went into effect. Trends in social mobility, but not trends in testing, track
case incidence. Data on hospitalization do not support the hypothesis that the observed increase
in case incidence was merely the result of liberalization of testing criteria. Parameter estimates
from a parsimonious two-group heterogeneous SIR model strongly support the hypothesis that
younger persons, having first acquired their infections through increasing social contact with
their peers, then transmitted their infections to older, less socially mobile individuals. Without
such cross-infection, an isolated epidemic among older people in Florida would be unsustainable.

Introduction
Recent reports suggest that the age distribution of new cases of COVID-19 in the United
States has shifted toward younger adults (Malmgren, Guo, and Kaplan 2020). One possible
explanation is that younger adults have tended to adhere less strictly to recommended social
distancing measures, especially as many states, counties and municipalities have begun to
reopen. A particular concern is that the higher prevalence of active infection among younger
individuals will ultimately result in a higher rate of cross-infection in older persons.
In this article, we use publicly available data on confirmed individual COVID-19 cases
compiled by the state of Florida to test whether the incidence of new coronavirus infections has
in fact been rising more rapidly among younger cohorts. We then explore whether the available
data can be used to assess whether cross-infection of older cohorts is already occurring.
To that end, we analyze the daily incidence of newly reported COVID-19 cases among
adults aged 20-39 years, 40-59 years, and 60 or more years in the sixteen most populous counties
of the state of Florida from March 1 through June 27, 2020. In all 16 counties, we observe an
increase in reported COVID-19 case incidence in all three age groups soon after the governorordered Full Phase 1 reopening went into effect. Trends in social mobility, but not trends in
testing, track case incidence. We then use our data on COVID-19 case incidence to estimate a
parsimonious two-group heterogeneous SIR model of the epidemic in each county. Our
parameter estimates support the hypothesis that younger persons, having first acquired their
infections through increasing social contact with their peers, then transmitted their infections to
older, less socially mobile individuals. Without such cross-infection, an isolated epidemic among
older people in Florida would be unsustainable.
Data
Analytic Sample. We downloaded a data file of confirmed individual COVID-19 cases on
June 28, 2020 from the website of the Florida Department of Public Health (Florida Department
of Public Health 2020b). The database covered 141,040 cases diagnosed through June 27, 2020,
showing the age of the individual, the date of diagnosis, county of residence, and whether
hospitalized. We excluded 225 cases listed as diagnosed before March 1, 2020, as well as 222
cases of individuals with unknown age. Focusing on adults, we further excluded 12,572 cases
with recorded age less than 20 years, leaving 128,021 cases.

We classified the remaining cases into three age groups: 20–39 years old (“younger”),
40–59 years old (“middle aged”), and 60 years or more (“older”). We further focused on cases
among residents of the 16 counties with the largest projected population aged 20 years or more
(Population Studies Program 2019). The breakdown by county and age group was as follows:

on the daily numbers of positive and negative tests for the entire state of Florida up to the closing
date from the COVID Tracking Project website (COVID Tracking Project 2020).
Social Mobility Data. We accessed two sources of social mobility data: Google’s
Community Mobility Reports, which provided information on daily visits to retail establishments
and recreational activity for Florida counties (Google 2020); and OpenTable’s data on the daily
numbers of seated diners in restaurants in Fort Lauderdale, Miami, Miami Beach, Naples,
Orlando, and Tampa (OpenTable 2020).
Methods
Descriptive Analyses. We used data on confirmed COVID-19 cases to analyze trends in
daily incidence by age group in each of the 16 most populous counties. We related these trends
to key statewide regulatory events. We then analyzed trends in social mobility, trends in testing
at both the state and county level, and trends in hospitalization rates of older people to assess
whether the liberalization of testing criteria was a factor in determining COVID-19 case
incidence.
Two-Group SIR Model. To quantitatively test the hypothesis that younger cohorts of
infected individuals have been cross-infecting older persons, we relied on a parsimonious twogroup, heterogeneous SIR model (Ellison 2020). To that end, we collapsed the daily COVID-19
incidence data for the younger and middle-aged groups into a single group, ages 20–59 years,
retaining the incidence data for the older group, ages 60 years or more.
While we estimated the parameters of our two-group SIR model in discrete time, for

() ()

()

clarity of exposition we describe the model here in continuous time. Let Si t , I i t , and Ri t
denote the respective proportions of susceptible, infective, and resistant individuals in groups
i = 1,2 at time t ≥ 0 . Each group has a closed population, that is, Si + I i + Ri = 1 for i = 1,2 ,

where we drop the explicit time dependence to simplify the notation. The motion of these state

(

)

variables over time is governed by four differential equations: S!1 = −S1 α 11 I1 + α 12 I 2 ,

S!2 = −S2 (α 21 I1 + α 22 I 2 ) , I!1 = S1 (α 11 I1 + α 12 I 2 ) − β1 I1 , and I!2 = S2 (α 21 I1 + α 22 I 2 ) − β 2 I 2 , where we
have used the notation S! = dS dt for the time derivative. Given the closed population
constraints, the corresponding differential equations for the numbers of resistant individuals are
R! i = − S!i − I!i = β i I i for i = 1,2 .

The path of this dynamic system is determined by the four positive transmission

parameters α 11 ,α 12 ,α 21 ,α 22 , the positive rates at which the two groups become resistant

{β , β } , and the initial conditions on the state variables. The transmission parameter α

captures the rate at which younger persons come into contact with each other, as well as the
probability of transmission when a susceptible younger person comes into contact with an
infective younger person. The corresponding parameter α 22 captures the rate at which older
persons come into contact with each other, as well as the probability of transmission when a
susceptible older person comes into contact with an infective older person. We call these
intragroup transmission parameters.
Similarly, the intergroup transmission parameter α 12 captures the rate at which younger
persons come into contact with older persons, as well as the probability of transmission when a
susceptible younger person comes into contact with an infective older person. Similarly, the
intergroup transmission parameter α 21 captures the rate at which older persons come into contact
with younger persons, as well as the probability of transmission when a susceptible older person
comes into contact with an infective younger person. The main objective of our modeling effort
is to assess the relative magnitude of the latter intergroup transmission parameter α 21 .

{

}

The parameters β1 , β 2 capture the rates at which infective individuals transition to their
respective resistant states through recovery or death. While older persons are known to have a
significantly higher case mortality rate, we take both parameters to be well approximated by the
inverse of the serial interval between successive infections. A recent review gives a range of
serial intervals from 3.1 and 7.5 days (Griffin et al. 2020). In our base-case analysis, we assume

β1 = β 2 = b = 1 5.5 , but vary this parameter from b = 1 5 to b = 1 6 .
Converting our dynamic model into discrete time, we let Sikt and I ikt , respectively,
denote the proportions of susceptible and infective individuals in age group i = 1,2 located in
county k = 1,…,16 at date t . Let yikt = nikt N ik denote the observed incidence rate, which we
calculate as the number nikt of infections diagnosed among age group i in county k on date t ,
as derived from our analytic database, divided by N ik , the projected population of age group i in
county k (Population Studies Program 2019). We then reconstruct the daily path of the epidemic

application of the discrete equations of motion Sikt = Sik ,t−1 − yikt and I ikt = I ik ,t−1 1− b + yikt ,
where we take as initial conditions Sik 0 = 1− I ik 0 and I ik 0 = 1 N ik . We note that each

{

}

reconstructed state variable Sik ,t−1 and I ik ,t−1 depends on the past values of yiku : u = 1,…,t − 1
but not on the contemporaneous incidence rate yijt .
Our reconstructed epidemic paths in each age group and each county thus provide an
empirical framework for estimating the model’s transmission parameters. For notational

purposes only, let X ijk ,t−1 = Sik ,t−1 I jk ,t−1 , where i = 1,2 and j = 1,2 . Then our dynamic equations
for the incidence of new daily infections becomes yikt = α i1 X i1k ,t−1 + α i2 X i2k ,t−1 + ε ikt , where ε ikt
are assumed to be independently identically distributed random variables with zero expectation
and, moreover, ε ijt are independent of X ijk ,t−1 . In what follows, we focus on the estimation
equation for the daily incidence of new infections in older persons, that is

y2kt = α 21 X 21k ,t−1 + α 22 X 22k ,t−1 + ε 2kt . This equation can be estimated separately for each county k
or pooled across counties.
Results
Daily Incidence by Age Group: 16 Populous Counties Combined
For each adult age group, Figure 2 shows the daily incidence of COVID-19 cases per
100,000 population from March 1 through June 27 for the 16 populous counties combined. The
vertical axis is measured on a logarithmic scale so that an exponential rise in incidence would
correspond to a straight line on the plot (Harris 2020a). The sky-blue datapoints correspond to
the younger age group (20–39 years), the lime datapoints correspond to the middle-aged group
(40–59 years), and the mango datapoints represent the older group (60+ years).

Figure 2 shows an initial exponential rise in incidence in all three adult age groups during
March, followed by a flattening and decline in the incidence curve beginning around Sunday,
March 22 and extending to around Sunday, May 17. Since then, the incidence appears to be
increasing in all three adult age groups, most markedly in the younger age group (20–39 years).

Figure 3. Geometric Mean Daily Incidence Rates by Week and Key Executive Orders Superimposed on the
Incidence Plot of Figure 2

The superimposition of the larger connected points helps us see that the incidence has
recently been increasing in all three age groups. From the week beginning Sunday May 17 to the
week beginning Sunday June 24, the average daily incidence of new COVID-19 cases has
increased by 11.83-fold among the younger group, 5.98-fold among the middle-aged group, and
3.96-fold among the older group.
Further superimposed on the incidence trends in Figure 3 are black arrows marking the
dates of key orders issued by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Specifically, Order Number 20-68,
effective March 17, 2020, imposed restrictions on pubs, bars, nightclubs, restaurants and beaches
(Desantis 2020a). Subsequent Order Number 20-91, effective April 3, 2020, limited movement
outside the home to essential activities and confined business activities to essential services
(Desantis 2020b). Order Number 20-112, effective May 4, 2020, began Phase 1 of the state’s
reopening, permitting restaurants and retail stores to operate at 25 percent capacity and
liberalizing prior prohibitions on elective medical procedures (Desantis 2020c). Order Number
20-123, effective May 18, 2020, put Full Phase 1 into effect, allowing restaurants, retail

establishments, and gyms to operate at 50 percent capacity, opening professional sports events
and training camps, and permitting amusement parks and vacation rentals to operate subject to
prior approval (Desantis 2020d).
Causal inferences relating trends in COVID-19 incidence to specific regulatory actions
must be approached with care (Harris 2020b, c). Still, it is noteworthy that the deceleration of
initial exponential surge in early March began soon after Order Number 20-68, while the
backward bending of the incidence curve began soon after Order Number 20-91. Moreover, the
downward trend in incidence halted soon after Executive Order 20-112, while the resumption of
the upward epidemic curve began soon after Executive Order 20-123.
Trends in Social Mobility
Figure 4 shows the corresponding daily COVID-19 case incidence for the three age
groups in Broward County, which includes the city of Fort Lauderdale. As in Figure 3, the
incidence is measured in daily cases per 100,000 population for each age group, as measured on
the left vertical axis. Superimposed on the incidence trends is the change in the number of seated
diners from online, phone, and walk-in reservations, computed as a percentage of the
corresponding number of diners one year earlier. The data, indicated by the connected dark-red
line segments, are from Fort Lauderdale restaurants in the OpenTable network (OpenTable
2020). The negative numbers, shown on the right vertical axis, represent percentage declines in
restaurant seating.

The data in Figure 4 show prompt, full compliance with Executive Order Number 20-68,
effective March 17, as well as reopening to seated diners after Executive Order Number 20-123
(Full Phase 1) went into effect on May 18.† Thereafter the rise in social mobility, as reflected in
the TableOne indicator, parallels the surge in COVID-19 case incidence. While data are shown
here only for Broward County (including Fort Lauderdale), there were similar patterns for
Miami-Dade County (including Miami and Miami Beach), Hillsborough County (including
Tampa), Orange County (including Orlando), and Collier County (including Naples).
Figure 5 shows the same data on the daily incidence of COVID-19 cases in the three age
groups in Broward County, just as in Figure 4. By contrast, the superimposed data series shows
the percentage change in daily visits to retail stores and recreational activity, as reported by
Google’s Community Mobility Reports for Broward County in its entirety. The change is shown

Above and beyond the governor’s statewide orders, the commissioner of Broward County had also issued

Figure 5 likewise shows evidence of compliance with Executive Order Number 20-68,
effective March 17. In contrast to Figure 4, however, the relationship between COVID-19
incidence and the Google social-mobility indicator appears to follow a threshold relationship,
highlighted by the horizontal line identified as “35% below baseline.” The incidence curve
decelerates when the reduction in activity exceeds 35 percent and accelerates when the reduction
in activity rises to within 35 percent of baseline. The pattern observed in Figure 5 was likewise
seen in the other populous counties.
Trends in Total Tests and Positive Tests
We next inquire whether the increases in COVID-19 incidence observed from mid-May
onward in Figures 2 and 3 could have been at least partly due to more liberalized testing. At the

start of the epidemic in the United States, many jurisdictions initially restricted COVID-19
testing to those individuals with more severe symptoms (Harris 2020c). These restrictions were
likely motivated by the scarcity of testing materials and required protective personal equipment.
As testing criteria were liberalized – that is, as supply constraints were relaxed – more people
with less severe symptoms would thus be expected to test positive.
To address this potential explanation, Figure 6 shows the trends in the total number of
test results and the number of positive tests reported in Florida on a daily basis from March 29
through the June 27 closing date. The data for the figure, which is based upon testing for the

Figure 6 shows that the trend in positive tests did not parallel the temporal pattern of total
tests. The opening of Full Phase 1 was accompanied by a rapid expansion of mobile, walk-up
and drive-thru testing (Florida Department of Public Health 2020c), with statewide tests jumping
to almost 55,000 on May 20 and . Thereafter, the median number of tests was 26,380 per day
(interquartile range 20,710– 37,000), peaking at 60,640 on June 27. By contrast, total positive
tests initially fell as total testing rose. By the week of May 10, approximately 5.2 percent of tests
were read as positive (median 5.19%, interquartile range 2.81–6.19%). Thereafter, positive tests
rose much faster than total tests. By the final week of our sample, the positive test rate had
increased to 15.8 percent (median 15.80%, interquartile range 9.57–18.54%).
Figure 7 shows the same lack of parallelism between total tests and positive tests for
Broward County. The data were derived from the daily county reports of the Florida Department

substantially outstripped the change in total tests.
Trends in Hospitalizations Among Older Persons with COVID-19
We next inquire whether recently diagnosed cases have been less severe. To that end, it
would seem appropriate to examine hospitalization rates as an indicator of disease burden (Harris
2020b). Unfortunately, the data on hospitalization from the Florida Department of Health are
derived from tracking positively tested individuals, and not from querying hospitals. As a result,
there have been substantial delays in ascertaining recent hospitalization rates.
Figure 8 shows the trends in hospitalization status of older residents of Broward County,
aged 60 years or more, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 29 onward. Broward
County was notable for its near-complete tracking of test-positive individuals through the end of

hospitalization status was seen in other populous counties. (Results not shown.) To address this
data limitation, Figure 9 shows the hospitalization rates among only those older persons residing
in Broward County with known hospitalization status.
Figure 9 indicates that, at least through the third week in May, there was a general
downward trend in the hospitalization rate of older persons diagnosed with COVID-19 in
Broward County. During the first three weeks of June, however, the hospitalization rate has been
stable at about one in four infected individuals (median 26.3%, interquartile range 19.6–30.1%).

Counties in Florida

The plot in Figure 11 shows a consistent monotonic relationship across counties between
the COVID-19 growth rates of younger and older adults during the Full Phase 1 reopening
period. The slope of the best-fitting weighted least squares regression line, where the weights
were the number of COVID-19 cases in each county, was +0.677 (standard error 0.141), while
the unrestricted constant term was –0.0003 (standard error 0.012). That is, COVID-19 incidence
among older adults aged 60 or more was on average growing two-thirds as rapidly as COVID-19
incidence among younger adults aged 20–60 years.

Nearly all the county-specific regressions showed a significant estimate of the intergroup
transmission parameter α 12 , reflecting the cross-infection of older by younger persons. At the
same time, the intragroup transmission parameters α 22 were in general not statistically
significant. The notable exceptions to the overall pattern were Duval and Palm Beach Counties.
Table 3 shows the results of pooling the regressions for the 16 counties. In this
specification, we allowed for county-specific interactions with the intergroup transmission
variable X 1 j,t−1 , but constrained the coefficient of the intragroup transmission variable X 2 j,t−1 to
be uniform across counties. The omitted county in the list of county-specific interactions was
Brevard County.

Again, nearly all the intergroup transmission parameter estimates were statistically
significant. Pooling the data from all counties improved the precision of the intragroup parameter

α 22 . While the constant term was estimated with precision, its estimated value of 0.725 per
100,000 population was much smaller than baseline value of 4.2 per 100,000 for all 16 counties
at the start of Full Phase 1, as shown in Figure 2.
Figure 12 shows the fit of the latter model to the data on the incidence of COVID-19
infections among older persons in Hillsborough County from the Full Phase 1 reopening onward.

We also ran models of the incidence of COVID-19 infections y1kt among the younger
age group. In a model analogous to that of Table 3, the estimated coefficient of X 11 was 0.274
(standard error 0.015, P < 0.001). The corresponding coefficient of X 12 was –0.169 (standard
error 0.194, P = 0.386). (Detailed results not shown.) We also varied the common recovery
parameter from b = 1 5 to b = 1 6 . While the estimates were quantitatively different, the
qualitative findings were unchanged. (Detailed results not shown.)
Discussion
This study has a number of limitations. The basic data on confirmed COVID-19 cases
was derived from a regime of partial, voluntary testing. Without universal, compulsory testing, it
is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about trends in the incidence of new SARS-CoV-2
infections. Recent estimates from serologic surveys suggest that, at least in the period before the
Full Phase 1 reopening, the actual incidence of infection was significantly higher (Havers et al.
2020) Nonetheless, the available evidence from this detailed study in the 16 most populous

counties in Florida points to a substantial rise in case incidence in both younger and older adults
after Full Phase 1 reopening went into effect on May 18.
We lack detailed data on the symptomatology and case severity of individuals voluntarily
undergoing testing. Without such data, it is difficult to evaluate definitively the hypothesis that
the observed rise in COVID-19 case incidence, as seen in all adult age groups in Figures 2, 3, 4,
5, 10 and Appendix 1, was due in part to liberalization of testing criteria, thus resulting in
expanded testing of milder cases. Still, the patterns of total tests and positive tests seen in Figure
6 for the entire state and in Figure 7 for a specific county are inconsistent with supply constraints
on testing as an important explanation for the overall rise in COVID-19 incidence. Our analysis
indicates that the time path of positive tests was largely independent of the number of total tests,
with positive tests rising substantially as a fraction of total tests in recent weeks.
To the contrary, Figures 4 and 5 demonstrate that indicators of social mobility, rather
than measures of total testing, track the data on positive tests. These findings do not teach us that
the resumption of indoor restaurant dining or visiting a retail store or an entertainment venue was
the specific cause of the resurgence in COVID-19 incidence. They do, however, support the
conclusion that the resurgence was the real result of changes in social mobility, and not an
artifact of expanded diagnosis. Figure 5, moreover, suggests critical threshold effects in the
relation between social activity and disease propagation. So long as Google mobility index
remained at least 35 percent below baseline, incidence rates were declining. But when the index
crossed that threshold, new COVID-19 cases surged.
We lack complete data on the hospitalization status of all persons with confirmed SARSCoV-2 infections. The recent rapid rise in the COVID-19 caseload creates an even greater
resource burden on case tracking, and thus exacerbates this problem. Without more complete
data on hospitalization status, it is difficult to determine definitively whether older persons more
than 60 years of age are now coming down with more or less severe cases of COVID-19. While
we found evidence of a declining hospitalization rate among older persons during the earlier
phases of the epidemic in Florida, we found no evidence of further changes in hospitalization
rates since the recent post Full Phase 1 reopening. Hospital-based data with detailed patient
information may be the best solution to this problem.
It may be difficult to determine definitively whether younger persons, having become
infected as a result of increased interpersonal contact after Full Phase 1 reopening, then cross-

infected older people, who remained largely at home. While more age-specific data on social
mobility may be helpful, a more compelling approach will require large-scale case tracking that
identifies infector-infected pairs.
Still, the evidence accumulated here is consistent with the cross-infection hypothesis. As
shown in Figure 11, those counties with higher rates of increase of COVID-19 infection among
young persons also had higher rates of increase among older persons. As shown in Tables 2 and
3, parameter estimates based upon a parsimonious, two-group heterogeneous SIR model indicate
that the estimated cross-infection effects of young persons on older persons dominated the
within-older group transmission effects. The only salient exceptions among the 16 most
populous counties were the unconstrained estimates for Palm Beach County and Duval County
in Table 2, where the estimated intra-group transmission among older persons was significant.
These two exceptions require further study. Census data do not show these two counties to be
outliers in terms of the elderly living arrangements or the proportions of elderly persons driving
or employed (Florida Department of Health 2020).
There is the alternative possibility that older adults on their own engaged in enhanced
social contact and, at least in principle, cross-infected their younger counterparts. Social contact
matrices for the United State suggest that elderly persons have about one-third as many social
contacts as younger persons (Prem, Cook, and Jit 2017). However, contact matrices capturing
social interactions under normal non-epidemic conditions are unlikely to accurately represent
contacts under the pressure of a persistent, life-threatening pandemic. Older persons, effectively
quarantined by government order, would be more dependent on younger persons for a wide array
of social needs.
Table 3 yielded an estimate of the intergroup transmission parameter α 22 equal to 0.049
for older persons infecting each other. If there were no cross-infection from younger persons –
that is, if α 21 were zero – then the dynamic equation for the proportion I 2 of infective older

(

people would collapse to the homogenous SIR form I!2 = α 22 S2 − β 2 I 2 . With β 2 = 1 5.5 = 0.18
as discussed above, and with S2 ≈ 1 , we would have I!2 < 0 . Equivalently, the basic reproductive
number would be R0 =

= 0.17 ≪ 1 (Harris 2020a). That is, without cross-infection by

younger persons, a COVID-19 epidemic solely among older, less mobile persons in Florida
would be unsustainable.
An exogenous event – namely, the reopening under Executive Order Number 20-123
establishing Full Phase 1 – appears to have resulted in less strict adherence to social distancing
measures by younger adults, who increasingly frequented pubs, bars, nightclubs, restaurants,
beaches, retail stores, gyms, and amusement parks. These younger adults, once infected, appear
to have then have cross-infected less mobile, older adults, who have largely adhered to social
distancing norms.
