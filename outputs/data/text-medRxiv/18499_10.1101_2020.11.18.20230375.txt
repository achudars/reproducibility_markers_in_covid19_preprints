Abstract

52

The standard RT-PCR assay for COVID-19 is laborious and time-consuming, limiting

53

the availability of testing. Rapid antigen-detection tests are faster and less expensive;

54

however, the reliability of these tests must be validated before they can be used widely.

55

The objective of this study was to determine the reliability of the PanbioTM COVID-19

56

Ag Rapid Test Device (PanbioRT) (Abbott) for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab

57

specimens. This was a prospective multicenter study in ten Spanish university hospitals

58

of patients from hospital units with clinical symptoms or epidemiological criteria for

59

COVID-19. Patients whose onset of symptoms or exposure was more than 7 days earlier

60

were excluded. Two nasopharyngeal exudate samples were taken to perform the

61

PanbioRT and a diagnostic RT-PCR test. Among the 958 patients studied, 359 (37.5%)

62

were positive by RT-PCR and 325 (33.9%) were also positive by the PanbioRT.

63

Agreement was 95.7% (kappa score: 0.90). All 34 false-negative PanbioRT results were

64

in symptomatic patients, with 23.5% of them at 6–7 days since the onset of symptoms

65

and 58.8% presenting CT >30 values for RT-PCR, indicating a low viral load. Overall

66

sensitivity and specificity for the PanbioRT were 90.5% and 98.8%, respectively. The

67

PanbioRT provides good clinical performance as a point-of-care test, with even more

68

reliable results for patients with a shorter clinical course of the disease or a higher viral

69

load. While this study has had a direct impact on the national diagnostic strategy for

70

COVID-19 in Spain, the results must be interpreted based on the local epidemiological

71

context.

Introduction

76

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome,

77

emerged in Wuhan (China) in December 2019. The virus has spread rapidly, causing a

78

global pandemic that was defined by The World Health Organization (WHO) as

79

Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) (1). Reliable and early diagnosis of the responsible

80

agent, not only in symptomatic patients but also in close contacts of confirmed cases, is

81

critical to controlling the spread of the disease (2,3). Clinical diagnosis of COVID-19

82

has relied on nucleic acid amplification tests, such as real-time reverse transcription

83

polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 (3,4). RT-PCR, the

84

current standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, is also the standard test in clinical

85

microbiology laboratories for the diagnosis of many infections because the test is

86

sensitive and pathogen-specific. However, the method is laborious, requiring

87

inactivation of the virus and RNA extraction before the RT-PCR assay. The test (under

88

optimal conditions) takes approximately 4-5 h, and the response time is typically 12 to

89

24 h. This test also requires a continuous supply of PCR kits as well as swabs and

90

transport media for samples, inactivation solutions, extraction reagents, and disposable

91

plasticware. The WHO recommended at least 200 PCR tests per 100,000 population to

92

ensure adequate control of the pandemic; however, in Spain more than 1,500 PCR tests

93

per 100,000 population were performed in September and October 2020 (5). This high

94

level of testing will be difficult to maintain in winter because of testing for other

95

respiratory infections, such as influenza. Therefore, we risk saturating the PCR-testing

96

capacity of microbiology laboratories, but also of sampling capacities in primary care

97

centers.

98

There are ongoing efforts to develop fast, reliable, and inexpensive diagnostic tests

99

specific for detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Rapid antigen-detection tests (RADT)

Materials and Methods

111

This was a prospective multicenter diagnostic evaluation study across ten independent

112

university hospitals in two Spanish autonomous communities (Madrid and Basque

113

Country) using consecutive enrollment. The hospitals participating in the study from

114

Madrid were Hospital Clínico Universitario San Carlos, Hospital Universitario Ramón y

115

Cajal, Hospital Universitario La Paz, Hospital Universitario Doce de Octubre, and

116

Hospital Universitario Gregorio Marañón. Hospitals from Basque Country were

117

Hospital Universitario Araba, Hospital Universitario Cruces, Hospital Universitario

118

Basurto, Hospital Universitario Donostia, and Hospital Universitario Galdakao-

119

Usansolo. Patients with clinical symptoms or epidemiological criteria (asymptomatic

120

close contacts) for COVID-19 from hospital emergency rooms or other hospital units

121

who were to receive a diagnostic RT-PCR test were included in the study. All

122

participants were reported as part of the study and verbal informed consent was

123

obtained prior to their inclusion. The result of the PanbioRT did not influence the

124

clinical management of the patients, which was decided based on the RT-PCR result.

125

Patient data were coded and no samples were stored after the PanbioRT was performed.

126

Patients whose onset of symptoms or exposure was more than 7 days earlier were

127

excluded.

128

Two nasopharyngeal exudate samples were taken per patient: one was used immediately

129

by trained personnel to perform the PanbioRT according to the manufacturer’s

130

instructions, and the second was used for a molecular diagnostic (RT-PCR) by each

131

hospital according to its standard procedures for COVID-19 diagnosis.

132

The symptoms, number of days since the onset of symptoms or exposure, threshold

133

cycle (CT) values for PCR, and demographic data were collected for all participants.

134

Specificity and sensitivity with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the

135

RT-PCR results as the standard. Sensitivity was calculated for all patients and for

136

specific groups of patients according to the time of onset of symptoms or exposure, RT-

137

PCR CT values, symptoms, and age. The level of agreement between the tests was

138

evaluated using Cohen's kappa score (7).

Results

141

Between September and October 2020, 958 individuals who had at least one symptom

142

compatible with COVID-19 (n=830) or had been in close contact with a diagnosed

143

COVID-19 patient (n=128) were included in this study. There were between 8 and 245

144

individuals from each participating hospital with a mean age of 42.4 years (range, 1-

145

100); 61.3% were women (Table 1) and 58 cases were in pediatric patients (≤14 years

146

old).

147

Among these 958 patients, 359 (37.5%) were positive by RT-PCR and 325 (33.9%)

148

were also positive by the PanbioRT (Table 2). A total of 599 (62.5%) were negative by

149

PCR and 592 (61.8%) were also negative by the PanbioRT (Table 2). The agreement

150

between both methods was 95.7% (kappa score: 0.90; CI 95%: 0.88–0.93). In 41

151

patients the results differed between the two tests and most of the differences were in

152

individuals who tested positive with the RT-PCR test but negative with the PanbioRT

153

(n=34; 3.5%) (Table 2, Table 3). All 34 of these cases were in symptomatic patients,

154

with 8 (23.5%) of them at 6–7 days since the onset symptoms, and 20 (58.8%) had

155

CT>30 values for RT-PCR.

156

Based on these data, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the PanbioRT were 90.5%

157

(CI 95%: 87.5–93.6) and 98.8% (CI 95%: 98–99.7), respectively (Table 3). Sensitivity

158

was slightly higher in patients with ≤5 days of the clinical course of the disease (91.8%;

159

CI 95%: 88.8–94.8) or in those who had a CT <30 for the RT-PCR test (94.5%; CI 95%:

160

91.7–97.3) (Table 4).

161

Among the 128 asymptomatic participants who had close contact with a COVID-19

162

patient, there was full concordance in the 31 (24.2%) who were positive by RT-PCR

163

and in the 97 that were negative. Six (10.3%) of the 58 pediatric patients included in the

164

study were positive by RT-PCR and also by the PanbioRT.

165

The negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) in the study

166

cohort, with a high prevalence (37.5%), were 94.6% and 97.8%, respectively (Table 4).

167

PPV and NPV were also calculated for lower prevalence of 5% and 10%; the results

168

obtained were 79.8% and 89.3%, respectively, for PPV; and 99.5 and 98.9%,

169

respectively, for NPV.

Discussion

172

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues unabated, the gap between the number of tests

173

that are needed and the testing capacity of laboratories or in primary care settings

174

increases (3). RADT tests are simple to perform and interpret without the need for

175

equipment at the point-of-care, they are inexpensive, and they provide quick results.

176

Early rapid antigen-detection test for COVID-19 diagnosis had poor reliability that

177

precluded their general use (8-11); however, the new generation of RADT appear to

178

have substantially improved reliability (12-15). Although these rapid tests show promise

179

for use as part of a larger strategy for COVID-19 diagnosis and control (6), there are

180

insufficient validation studies to support their use in varied patient environments. In this

181

study the PanbioRT gave very good clinical performance values, with 90.5% sensitivity

182

and 98.8% specificity; moreover, sensitivity was even improved in patients with five or

183

fewer days of clinical progression of the disease. The strengths of this study include the

184

large study size, the high percentage of positive cases, the inclusion of multiple centers,

185

the prospective nature of the study, and the inclusion of point-of-care patients. This

186

study has had an immediate clinical impact, having been used to modify the Spanish

187

Strategy for Early Detection, Surveillance, and Control, of COVID-19 (Update

188

September 25, 2020) (16).

189

In two recent pre-published Spanish studies with 412 patients (54 positive by RT-PCR)

190

(13) and 255 patients (60 positive by RT-PCR) (12), the overall sensitivities were

191

79.3% and 76.3%, respectively; however, in the second study sensitivity was 86.5% in

192

symptomatic patients with seven or fewer days since the onset of symptoms (12). WHO

193

guidelines require that SARS-CoV-2 RADT demonstrate ≥80% sensitivity and ≥97%

194

specificity compared to the RT-PCR reference assay (6). Thus, our data support the

195

clinical use of the PanbioRT instead of the RT-PCR test in patients with symptoms of

196

COVID-19 with a short clinical course (≤5–7 days) of the disease. Although the results

197

obtained in asymptomatic patients and children under 14 years of age were good, the

198

number of cases included for these subpopulations was small (128 and 58, respectively),

199

making it inadvisable to conclude general results about that. In a pre-published study

8

200

with frozen samples (17), sensitivity was significantly higher among samples collected

201

in the setting of case identification (92.6%) and contact tracing (94.2%) than in

202

asymptomatic screening (79.5%). This is consistent with the advice from the WHO

203

against using RADT for screening asymptomatic individuals in populations with low

204

COVID-19 prevalence (6) due to the potential increase of higher incidence of false

205

positives. In this study, we estimated that the PPV decreased to 79.8% when the

206

prevalence was 5%.

207

The performance of an RADT may depend on the epidemiological situation of the

208

population being tested; therefore, how the test is used and how the results are

209

interpreted will depend on local epidemiological factors (6). In populations with a high

210

prevalence and a high frequency of symptomatic patients, a positive rapid test would be

211

considered confirmatory for infection. However, a negative result would lead to further

212

testing for respiratory pathogens, including an RT-PCR test for COVID-19 if the

213

symptoms were consistent with this disease. In populations with a low prevalence of

214

COVID-19 and more asymptomatic patients, a negative test would be accepted, but a

215

positive test, which is more likely to be false, could require a confirmatory RT-PCR

216

test.

217

The use of RADT as a diagnostic tool can greatly reduce the testing burden on

218

microbiology laboratories. However, in the primary care setting, which has also reached

219

saturation in the testing and diagnosis of COVID-19, changes would be required to

220

allow them to perform the rapid test on-site. The ability to perform this test in patient

221

care centers would simplify the process of testing, provide rapid results to the doctor

222

and the patient, thus improving the decision-making process and reducing pressure on

223

the health care providers.

224

In conclusion, this study showed that the PanbioRT provides very good clinical

225

performance as a point-of-care test, with even better results for patients with a shorter

226

clinical course of the disease or higher viral load. While this study has had a direct

227

impact on the national diagnostic strategy for COVID-19 in Spain, the results must be

228

interpreted based on the local epidemiological context. The ease and speed of RADT

229

with god clinical performance could help to prevent an overload on health care services

230

as laboratories will have to cope with an increase in respiratory infections during winter.
