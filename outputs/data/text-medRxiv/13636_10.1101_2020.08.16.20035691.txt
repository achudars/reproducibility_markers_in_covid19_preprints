ABSTRACT

48

Background

49

Insight into COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patient characteristics, rates and risks of

50

invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and associated outcomes as well as any regional discrepancies

51

is critical in this pandemic for individual case management and overall resource planning.

52
53
54

Methods and Findings
Electronic searches were performed for reports through May 1 2020 and reports on COVID-19

55

ICU admissions and outcomes were included using predefined search terms. Relevant data was

56

subsequently extracted and pooled using fixed or random effects meta-analysis depending on

57

heterogeneity. Study quality was assessed by the NIH tool and heterogeneity was assessed by I2 and Q

58

tests. Baseline patient characteristics, ICU and IMV outcomes were pooled and meta-analyzed. Pooled

59

odds ratios (pOR) were calculated for clinical features against ICU, IMV mortality. Subgroup analysis

60

was carried out based on patient regions. A total of twenty-eight studies comprising 12,437 COVID-19

61

ICU admissions from seven countries were meta-analyzed. Pooled ICU admission rate was 21% [95%

62

CI 0.12-0.34] and 69% of cases needed IMV [95% CI 0.61-0.75]. ICU and IMV mortality were 28.3%

63

[95% CI 0.25-0.32], 43% [95% CI 0.29-0.58] and ICU, IMV duration was 7.78 [95% CI 6.99-8.63] and

64

10.12 [95% CI 7.08-13.16] days respectively. Besides confirming the significance of comorbidities and

65

clinical findings of COVID-19 previously reported, we found the major correlates with ICU mortality

66

were IMV [pOR 16.46, 95% CI 4.37-61.96], acute kidney injury (AKI) [pOR 12.47, 95% CI 1.52-

67

102.7], and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [pOR 6.52, 95% CI 2.66-16.01]. Subgroup

68

analyses confirm significant regional discrepancies in outcomes.

Conclusions This is the most comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of COVID-19 ICU

71

and IMV cases and associated outcomes to date and the only analysis to implicate IMV's associtaion

72

with COVID-19 ICU mortality. The significant association of AKI, ARDS and IMV with mortality has

73

implications for ICU resource planning for AKI and ARDS as well as research into optimal ventilation

74

strategies for patients. Regional differences in outcome implies a need to develop region specific

75

protocols for ventilatory support as well as overall treatment.

INTRODUCTION

94

Since its inception, the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has placed unprecedented strain on

95

healthcare globally with intensive care unit (ICU) care and ventilator availability being focal points of

96

health resource allocation and planning. Understanding COVID-19 ICU and associated invasive

97

mechanical ventilation (IMV) patient characteristics and outcomes as well as appreciating their

98

regional variations is thus critically important for patient management as well as resource planning.

99

Despite an increasing number of studies relating to various aspects of severe COVID-19 and its ICU

100

management; discrepancies in size, methodologies and research focus as well as regional differences in

101

these studies calls for a comprehensive systematic review and analysis of reports to date.

poor. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between all authors.

138

Meta-analysis was conducted when there were two or more studies for the same outcome using

139

Comprehensive Meta-analysis (CMA) software version 3. The pooled event rate (pER) was used to

140

meta-analyze the prevalences of patient characteristics, rates of ICU admissions and IMV, and ICU and

141

IMV mortalities. Pooled odds ratio (pOR) was used to assess the association between clinical features

142

and outcomes. Pooled mean or weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI)

143

were used in meta-analysis of continuous outcomes. We used the fixed-effect model unless there was

144

evidence of heterogeneity, in which case the random-effects model was used. Heterogeneity was

145

determined using I2 and Q test [3.4] and was considered significant if the P-value of the Q test is <0.1

146

and/or I2 >50%. The corresponding 95% CI of the pooled effect size was calculated. Subgroup analysis

147

were done on patient region, overall quality, and publication type (pre-print vs. peer-reviewed) to

148

investigate the heterogeneity amongst studies. Publication bias was assessed using Egger’s regression

149

test and funnel plots for outcomes with five or more studies, and was considered significant if Egger’s

regression P-value is <0.1 [5,6]. When a mean value of a continuous outcome was missing, methods by

151

Wan [7] were utilized to impute the needed value for the meta-analysis. Since some studies [8,9,10-

152

17,18-23] included patients still hospitalized at endpoint (n=4,697, 37.8%), we considered two

153

mortality scenarios methodologically: (1) best case scenario by pooling patients with known outcome

154

and (2) worst case scenario by pooling those still hospitalized with non-survivors.

243

with both ICU and IMV mortality (pOR 2.02, 95% CI 1.37 – 2.98; pOR 1.5, 95% CI 1.06 - 2.12,

277

generally on all [36] or hospitalized cases [37], or from a certain region [38], or focused on specific

278

aspects such as mortality [39] or outcomes [40], with only one systematic review specifically

279

addressing IMV mortality [41]. Here we attempt to provide a comprehensive assessment of ICU-

280

admitted COVID-19 patient characteristics, regional discrepancies, as well as overall ICU and IMV

281

specific outcomes and their associated factors.

282

Our pooled ICU best case mortality rate of 28.3% (95% CI 0.27-0.32) amongst COVID-19

283

patients is lower than earlier reports from Wuhan's 78% [20] and Seattle's 85% [8], but in line with the

284

more recent report of 31% from Atlanta [10], as well as 25.7% and 41.6% reported in reviews by Quah

285
286
287

et al. [39] and Armstrong et al. [40] respectively.

288

reports of 86–97% from Wuhan [20.31] or 71-75% from Seattle [8.11]. The more recent Atlanta study

289

revealed improved IMV mortality of 35.7% [10], which is more consistent with the 35% to 46%

290

mortality respectively reported for patients intubated with H1N1 influenza pneumonia [42] and other

291
292
293

causes of ARDS [43].

294

reporting a median LoS of 8 (5-13) days for patients from China and 7 (4-11) days from outside China

295

[44]. As for IMV duration, we found a pooled mean duration of 10 days (95% CI 7-13), which is

296
297
298

shorter than earlier reports from Wuhan and Seattle of 10-17 days [41].

299

COVID-19 ICU outcome over time, which was attributed to increased ICU experience, and evolving

300

admission criteria, treatments, and demographics [40]. We additionally hypothesize that aimprovements

301

in reported mortalities over time and regions may arise as healthcare systems become less

302

overwhelmed, and as more recent studies account for more complete patient outcomes. Significant

303

differences between reporting geographic regions could additionally be due to different ICU admission

19

19

Our 43% (95% CI 0.29-0.58) pooled IMV mortality rate is also significantly lower than earlier

We found a pooled mean ICU LoS of 7.8 (7-8.5) days comparable to results from a review

Taken together, our results are consistent with the recent finding by Armstrong et alof improved

305
306
307

308

laboratory findings and complications of the disease have been published [46,47], although there is no

309

systematic review addressing all these aspects in COVID-19 ICU or IMV to date. We found that

310

elderly COVID-19 patients with comorbidities have higher ICU and IMV fatalities; but this is not

311

unique to COVID-19 as many studies have noted that ICU patients generally consists of elderly

312
313
314

patients who have greater mortality [48].

315

features in COVID-19 ICU patients, the relative prevalence is the same as reported in less severe

316

symptomatic or hospitalized cases. For example, a review of mostly Chinese studies similarly found

317

hypertension to be the most common comorbidity in COVID-19 [49]; and another review identified

318

fever (88.7%), cough (57.6%) and dyspnea (45.6%) to be similarly most common manifestations [50].

319

Our results also corroborated findings from meta-analyses where DM [51], CVD [52], abnormal liver

323

mortality, which is consistent with findings by a review that identified these same comorbidities to be

324

correlated with disease severity and ICU admissions [49]. Separately, Wang et al. also found HTM,

325
326
327

DM, and CVD to correlate with COVID-19 severity and mortality [54].

COVID-19 severity or mortality.

332
333

While most clinical correlates we found above are consistent and noted by other reports to date,

334

three correlates with ICU mortality deserve discussion. One is AKI (pOR 12.47, 95% CI 1.52-102.7),

335

for which there are divergent reports on prevalence and significance. Thus, while some large COVID-

336

19 systematic reviews excluded AKI [27,37] and it is absent from some COVID-19 critical care

337

management guidelines [55,56], its incidence in hospitalized COVID-19 has been reported to be as low

338

as 0.5% [29] and some researchers even concluded that COVID-19 does not cause AKI [57]. However,

339

we found a pooled AKI prevalence of 32% and a New York report cited 46% of hospitalized and 68%

340

of ICU COVID-19 cases with AKI with 34% of those in ICU requiring replacement renal therapy

341

(RRT), and with an OR of 20.9 (95% CI 11.7-37.3) for AKI vs non-AKI associated ICU mortality [58].

342

Along with our analysis, this raises the concern that AKI maybe seriously under appreciated in

critically ill COVID-19 patients.

346

found. Problematically, ARDS itself is a heterogeneous syndrome, with the six studies [8,9,22,31-33]

347

we analyzed variously applying the Berlin criteria [59], WHO guidance [60], or no criteria at all for its

348

diagnosis. Then there is a notion that COVID-19 ARDS may be a separate entity and that current

349

criteria are inadequate in guiding treatment [61]. Indeed, ARDS per the Berlin criteria defines a one

350

week onset limit whereas COVID-19 related ARDS has a median onset of 8-12 days [20].

351

Pathophysiologically, there are also differences between COVID or non-COVID ARDS and Gattinoni

352

et al. have highlighted the non-uniformity of ARDS in COVID-19 based on elastance,

353

ventilation/perfusion ratio, lung weight and recruitability [62]. Thus, further efforts are urgently

354

needed in clarifying the pathophysiology and developing new stratifications of severity for COVID-19

355
356
357

specific ARDS to guide optimal ventilatory support for ICU COVID-19 patients.

21

ARDS is another significantly associated complication (pOR 6.52, 95% CI 2.66 - 16.01) we

Finally, the issue of defining ARDS in COVID-19 leads to applicability of IMV as its treatment.

of outcome. Our finding that IMV itself is significantly associated with ICU mortality (pOR 16.46,

361

95% CI 4.37-61.96) coupled with subgroup analyses showing regions with higher ICU mortalities

362

coincide with regions with higher IMV rates (USA, UK, Italy) are notable because it questions the

363

benefits of IMV as well as the wisdom of public policies emphasizing ventilator availability in coping

364

with the pandemic. The concern for potentially harmful overuse of IMV has been raised by past

365

research, since IMV itself carries risks that may adversely affect survival [63]. Additionally,

366

inappropriate timing of intubation too early or too late, inadequately trained or overwhelmed staff, as

367

well as improper ventilation settings and IMV associated pneumonia can all potentially enhance

368
369
370

mortality; and this should all be investigated more fully in COVID-19 cases.

371

ventilation (NIV) may improve mortality over IMV [64], and there are suggestions that non-rebreathing

372

masks and prone positioning may improve outcome in hypoxemic COVID-19 patients [65]. The

373

comparison of different ventilation strategies is beyond the scope of our review and there is yet no

374

published study comparing ventilation strategies in COVID-19. However, our data supports a more

375

conservative approach to initiating IMV, as well as the need for well designed trials to clarify the role

376

of various ventilation strategies in COVID-19 associated ARDS.

From prior studies on ARDS, we know that other ventilation strategies such as non-invasive

377

Finally, our results highlight significant regional discrepancies in COVID-19 ICU and IMV

378

rates and outcomes. As the pandemic evolves, regional differences of local health systems and their

379

resources as well as genetic differences amongst populations and possible viral evolution over time can

380

all account for such differences and deserves study. Regional differences also imply the need for

381

flexible region-specific treatment protocols especially in resource-limited settings [65] instead of the

aim to set uniform international protocols for treatment.

383
384

Limitations

385

There are multiple limitations with our study. We have issues with incompleteness of data where not all

386

outcomes are accounted for in many studies, as well as underlying heterogeneity of data with small

387

number of studies and studies with small numbers of patients. Moreover, all our retrieved reports were

388

retrospective cohorts, which limits our ability to infer causality; and some of these were not peer-

389

reviewed. Furthermore, we could not adjust for confounders of potentially related variables in an

390

analysis of survival vs. non-survival based on these studies. Finally, regional differences in health

391

systems and their different treatment protocols may also confound results.

392
393

Conclusions

394

This is the largest and most comprehensive review and meta-analysis of ICU and IMV outcomes in

395

COVID-19 ICU patients. Our findings parallel earlier reports on prevalences of associated

396

comorbidities and clinical findings in COVID-19 patients implying largely the same set of factors is

397

associated with severity and outcome regardless of stage of disease. However, we highlight the

398

significant association of AKI and ARDS associated IMV in ICU outcomes, which deserve further

399

research to refine diagnostic criteria and enable the development of optimally tailored treatment

400

strategies, as well as better planning and allocation of critical care resources. Finally significant

401

regional discrepancies in outcomes implies a need for further studies to allow a broader perspective of

402

factors associated with ICU and IMV risks and outcomes under different healthcare systems in different

403

populations.
