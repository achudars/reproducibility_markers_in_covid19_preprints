Abstract
Background: Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is one of the most promising approaches to
effectively monitor the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The virus
concentration in faeces and its temporal variations are essential information for WBE. While some
clinical studies have reported severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
concentrations in faeces, the value varies amongst patients and changes over time.
Aim: The present study aimed to examine how the temporal variations in the concentration of
virus in faeces affect the monitoring of disease incidence. We re-analysed the experimental
findings of clinical studies to estimate the duration of virus shedding and the faecal virus
concentration.
Method: Available experimental data as of 23 October, 2020 were collected and patient data
reported in Germany were included for further analysis. The viral shedding kinetics was
modelled, and the dynamic model was fitted to the collected experimental data by a Bayesian
framework. Using samples of posterior distributions, the duration of viral shedding and the
concentration of virus copies in faeces over time were computed.
Results: We estimated the median concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces as 2.6 (95% Credible
Interval (CrI): 0.22‚Äì4.8) log copies per gram (g) of faeces over the shedding period, and our model
implied that the duration of viral shedding was 23.2 days (95% CrI: 19.5‚Äì31.5), given the current
standard quantification limit (Ct = 40). With simulated incidences, our results also indicated that a
one-week delay between symptom onset and wastewater sampling increased the estimation of
incidence by 13.5%.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that the temporal variation in virus concentration in faeces
affects microbial monitoring systems such as WBE. The present study also implied the need for
adjusting the estimates of virus concentration in faeces by incorporating the kinetics of unobserved

therefore, the results of this study might contribute to enhancing disease surveillance and risk
assessments that require quantities of virus to be excreted into the environment.

1. Introduction
As of 23 October 2020, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread all over
the world. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent
of this disease. The infection causes general symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath
and diarrhoea [1], and the disease progression differs according to age [2,3] and clinical history [4].
Previous epidemiological studies on COVID-19 have reported that a substantial proportion of
infected individuals were even asymptomatic [5,6]. These disease characteristics have caused
complications in controlling the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
To identify hidden chains of infection, more effective ways of monitoring the spread of the
disease are required. In this context, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been attracting
attention as a promising potential approach [7,8]. Clinical observations have demonstrated that
there is prolonged virus shedding in faeces, ranging from 1 to 33 days [9‚Äì11], and therefore
wastewater surveillance can enable the monitoring of excreted viruses through which we can
capture the presence and possibly the numbers of infected individuals, regardless of their
symptoms. As a monitoring system, researchers have successfully reported their detection or
quantification results in various countries, such as Australia [12], Japan[13], etc. [14‚Äì16]. The

Netherlands and several municipalities in the United States have already started utilising WBE in
practice as a part of their surveillance systems [17,18].
One of the most important quantities for WBE is the SARS-CoV-2 concentration in faeces. If
we wish to simulate the potential number of cases in a sewershed, the virus concentration in faeces
and its time course would affect the simulation. For example, earlier WBE studies have attempted
to simulate the incidence using sewage data [12,19]; however, no previous studies have accounted
for temporal variations in the virus concentration in faeces, and thus undetectable concentrations
that might occur after several weeks from symptom onset have not been considered. In addition,
while several clinical studies have reported that there is prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding in faeces
with binary results (i.e. positive/negative) [11] or threshold cycle (Ct) values over time [10,20],
quantitative estimates of possible virus excretions have yet to be fully explored.
The present study aims to examine how temporal variations in virus concentrations in
faeces affect disease incidence monitoring systems such as WBE by estimating the duration of
virus shedding and the virus concentration in faeces. We screened available time course data of
virus concentration in faeces in clinical studies and subsequently applied a mathematical model
that describes the kinetic viral shedding process. The present study also simulated the potential
bias for the estimation of incidence with WBE by using an estimated virus shedding time course.

2. Methods
2.1 Data collection
A literature review was conducted to collect available experimental data as of 23 October,
2020 using Google Scholar, PubMed and MedRxiv. Seven articles containing the following
information were assessed with full text reviews: (a) exact virus copies or Ct values, (b) days from
symptom onset or days from hospitalisation and (c) the amount of stool that was quantified by

quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) [10,20‚Äì25]. As a result of this review, only patient
data reported in Wolfel et al. (2020) were used for further analysis [21]; the other studies were
excluded because they reported only Ct values and the experimental details required conversion to
virus concentration in faeces [copies/grams (g)-faeces].
The analysed data consist of hospitalised patients involved in a large cluster that occurred
in Munich, Germany between 23 and 27 January, 2020 [21]. Since it is difficult in retrospective
studies to collect stool samples before the onset of symptoms, the data were expressed in the unit
of time ‚Äòdays after symptom onset‚Äô [21]. The sample size reported in this study was insufficient to
stratify the study population into sub-groups and thus exhaustive data were analysed to estimate
the temporal variations in virus shedding.

2.2 Model
The time course of virus shedding is modelled as two processes. First, the virus is
accumulated in a human host with concentration ùëê1 (ùë°) and then, at a certain point, the virus is
shed in concentration ùëê2 (ùë°). According to Teunis et al. [26], the dynamics can be formulated simply
as follows:

where A is the initial concentration of viruses and ùõº and ùõΩ are the transport rates of viruses. By
solving this system, the time course of virus concentration in faeces can be written as

where
present study,

(see a more detailed biological description in the original study [26]). In the
was defined as the day of symptom onset, assuming that the accumulation of

viruses was complete when the individuals started shedding viruses in their faeces.

One of the properties of this model is that one can analytically calculate important
quantities such as peak concentration. Finding the extrema of ùê∂(ùë°), the time to peak concentration
ùë°!"#$ is written as

, and the peak concentration ùê∂!"#$ is consequently obtained as
.

To define the end of virus shedding, Ct = 40 was used as the threshold (corresponding to
approximately 102 copies per g-faeces), following the recommended quantification threshold value
in current qPCR protocols [21]. The duration of virus shedding ùë°%&%#' was then computed by
seeking the intersection point of ùê∂(ùë°) and the threshold value.

2.3 Model fit
To jointly estimate the parameters (ùê∂0 , ùõº, ùõΩ), a hierarchical Bayesian framework was used to
account for individual variations and provide for the uncertainty of the estimates. Here, we denote
the expected value as

with natural log scale. By assuming that the log-transformed

concentration is normally distributed, the likelihood is simply

where is the observed data (i.e. the log-scaled virus concentration data) and is the standard
deviation. We describe the variation in the observed data in a hierarchical model framework

with mean vector

and standard deviation vector

.

For the hyperparameters, we specified positive non-informative prior probability distributions for
parameters

and . Using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm, we obtained estimates

and 95% credible intervals (CrI) by sampling the posterior distributions. All of the computations
above were implemented in R-4.0.0 with a package {rstan}-2.21.2. [27,28].

2.4 Simulation of relative incidence
Suppose that we wish to calculate the potential number of infected individuals per day
using WBE surveillance. If we have observational data on the average number of SARS-CoV-2
ribonucleic acid (RNA) copies in sewage per day and complete information on the symptom
onset of all of the infected individuals, we can simulate the crude daily incidence
average daily water volume

with the

and the average amount of faeces per person per day :

where is the average virus concentration in faeces.
The crucial point here is that the virus concentration is the variable that is dependent on the
time between sewage sampling and symptom onset. We thus denote the concentration in faeces at
day from symptom onset as

and examine the sensitivity of the expected incidence to the virus

concentration in faeces by defining the relative incidence as

where

is the baseline concentration defined by the median of the (quantified) concentration

reported in Wolfel et al. [21]. For simplicity, the analysis assumes that all of the individuals had the
same symptom onset ( days before sampling) and we simulated

by changing

and fixing the other conditions.

3. Results
3.1 Time course of viral shedding
The estimated curve for the time course of virus shedding is shown in Fig-1. The results of
model fitting indicate that the virus concentration in faeces rapidly increases after symptom onset,
and that prolonged shedding occurs until the concentration becomes lower than the quantification
limits. The time to peak concentration ùë°!"#$ was estimated to be 0.38 (95% CrI: 0.22‚Äì2.6) days. If we

3.2 Expected virus concentration

With HMC posterior samples, we estimated the possible range of virus concentrations in faeces
during the shedding period and at peak concentration. Those estimates with uncertainty are
shown in Fig-2(A). If we use the quantitative data from Wolfel et al. to calculate the expected virus
concentration [21], the median was 3.2 (95% percentile: 2.2‚Äì5.7) [log copies per g-faeces]; however,
our estimates suggest that the median of concentration over the whole shedding period was 2.6

(95% CrI: 0.22‚Äì4.8) [log copies per g-faeces]. For peak concentration ùê∂!"#$ , the estimate was 4.8
(95% CrI: 4.1‚Äì5.5) [log copies per g-faeces].

3.3 Simulated relative incidence
To assess the potential impact of the timing of sewage sampling for WBE, we simulated the
relative incidence by changing the delay between sewage sampling and symptom onset. Fig-2(B)
illustrates the results of simulated relative incidences in which the value equals 1 when Wolfel et
al.‚Äôs quantified data are used for the virus concentration in faeces [21]. The results indicate that the
(log-converted) expected incidence increased linearly with longer intervals, and a one-week delay
increased the estimated incidence by 13.5% (i.e., 100.87 times higher).

4. Discussion
In this study, we estimated the time course of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in faeces by applying
a simple dynamic model. Our findings show that there is a large temporal variation in virus
concentration in faeces (Fig-1), resulting in potential bias when simulating the number of infected
cases with the data on virus concentration in sewage (Fig-2). The model describes the kinetics of
the accumulation and excretion processes (Eq-1) and thereby accounts for unobserved
concentrations that were under the detection limits of real-time PCR.
The duration of virus shedding in faeces was estimated to be 23.2 (95%CrI: 19.5‚Äì31.5) days
from symptom onset. This result is consistent with previous clinical reports [9,11]. While earlier
studies have suggested possible durations with only binary (positive/negative) results [11], our
method provides a credible range of shedding duration with uncertainty. Furthermore, we can
easily simulate it even when the threshold values are changed. Several clinical studies have
reported Ct values over time, but the amount of stool in RNA extractions was not recorded
[20,22,23,25]. If such information is available, that evidence would be synthesised with our method
and induce more valuable implications for both the natural history of COVID-19 infection and
environmental surveillance.
In the context of WBE, our findings on the peak and median concentrations indicated that
there might be bias if we use only quantified experimental results of faecal samples by truncating
unobserved concentrations. There are large variations in concentration depending on the timing of
taking faecal samples (Fig-1 and Fig-2(A)); a one-week delay increases the estimation of incidence
by 13.5% (Fig-2(B)). Previous studies have attempted to simulate the potential incidence with the
quantified virus concentration in sewage [12,19]; however, since there is a strong dependency
between the observed concentration in sewage and the sampling delay from symptom onset, we
must carefully specify the interpretation of quantities averaged over time. Ideally, epidemiological

data such as case series based on symptom onset should be incorporated to simulate incidences
more precisely.
There are several limitations in this study. First, the analysed data are a single cohort that
consists of diagnosed cases in Germany. The disease progression might differ by age, race or
medical history and, consequently, those factors might affect the estimates. Since the sample size
was not sufficient to stratify the data into sub-groups, additional data are needed for further
analysis. Second, our modelling assumed that the virus shedding in faeces starts from symptom
onset. If the peak had occurred before symptom onset, it would not be captured with this analysis.
While earlier clinical studies have indicated that the peak in faeces might be around symptom
onset [10,20] and in throat swabs [29], there was no publicly available data that contain viral loads
from the day of infection to symptom onset. To obtain a conclusive estimate of the peak timing, we
need observational data such as (prospective) periodic stool sampling or human challenge studies.
Despite the abovementioned limitations, our analysis would be beneficial for surveillance
systems in different sectors. Our findings indicate that the temporal variation in virus
concentrations affects microbial monitoring systems such as WBE and repeated testing in
hospitals. Especially for the estimation of incidence, the virus concentrations in faeces must be
adjusted by incorporating the kinetics of unobserved concentrations (i.e. concentrations lower than
the quantification limits). The method used in this study is easily implemented in other
simulations and therefore the results of this study might contribute to enhancing disease
surveillance and risk assessments that require data on the quantities of viruses that have been
excreted into the environment.
