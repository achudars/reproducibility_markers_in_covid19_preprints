Abstract
Effective therapeutic interventions for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 are
urgently needed. A systematic review was conducted to identify clinical trials of
pharmacological interventions for COVID-19 published between 1 December 2019
and 14 October 2020. Data regarding efficacy of interventions, in terms of mortality,
hospitalisation and need for ventilation, were extracted from identified studies and
synthesised qualitatively.
In total, 42 clinical trials were included. Interventions assessed included antiviral,
mucolytic, anti-malarial, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory therapies. Some
reductions in mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation were seen with
interferons and remdesivir, particularly when administered early, and with the
mucolytic drug, bromhexine. Most studies of lopinavir/ritonavir and
hydroxychloroquine did not show significant efficacy over standard care/placebo.
Dexamethasone significantly reduced mortality, hospitalisation and need for
ventilation versus standard care, particularly in patients with severe disease.
Evidence for other classes of interventions was limited. Many trials had a moderateto-high risk of bias, particularly in terms of blinding; most were short-term; and some
included low patient numbers.
This review highlights the need for well-designed clinical trials of therapeutic
interventions for COVID-19 to increase the quality of available evidence. It also
emphasises the importance of tailoring interventions to disease stage and severity
for maximum efficacy.

Introduction
COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus,
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. The global
pandemic caused by COVID-19 is ongoing, with a projected death toll of almost 2.5
million by 1 February 2021 [2].
Although COVID-19 presents primarily as a respiratory tract infection, increasing
data have shown the potential for systemic involvement, including cardiovascular,
neurological and dermatological manifestations, in patients who present with the
disease [3]. The pathophysiological course of COVID-19 has been proposed to
comprise three distinct phases [4]. In the early infection phase, the SARS-CoV-2
virus enters epithelial cells in the nasal cavity and multiplies in the upper respiratory
tract, with or without pulmonary involvement [1, 4, 5]. The second phase is
characterised by localised pulmonary inflammation and the development of viral
pneumonia, with or without hypoxia. In a minority of patients, the disease enters a
third ‘host response’ phase, which manifests as an extrapulmonary systemic
hyperinflammation syndrome, characterised by high levels of pro-inflammatory
cytokines and potentially leading to thrombotic complications, viral sepsis and multiorgan failure [1, 4, 6].
Increasing understanding of the disease pathways involved in COVID-19 has
highlighted the importance of selecting and implementing treatments appropriate for
the disease stage that patients present with [4, 6]. Since the start of the outbreak,
global efforts to validate effective therapeutic interventions for COVID-19 have
resulted in the identification of many potential candidates and the initiation of
thousands of clinical trials of therapies with diverse mechanisms of action [7-9].

As of November 2020, a small number of treatments have received regulatory
approval on the basis of promising results (table 1). These include the antiviral,
remdesivir; remdesivir in combination with baricitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor;
dexamethasone, a corticosteroid; convalescent plasma; bamlanivimab, a monoclonal
antibody therapy; and casirivimab and imdevimab, a cocktail of two monoclonal
antibodies [10-13]. Additionally, one vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 has been
approved in Russia following results from two non-randomised phase 1/2 trials [14,
15] and several other vaccines are in late-phase clinical trials. Despite these
developments, treatment options for COVID-19 remain limited. The precise
proportion of patients requiring hospitalisation is challenging to determine, given the
uncertain prevalence of infection [16]. However, it is estimated that up to 20% of
patients with COVID-19 have an illness severe enough to warrant hospitalisation,
which may require intensive care admission and need for respiratory support [17-20].
Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic has put substantial pressure on healthcare
systems worldwide [21-25], and there remains an urgent need for effective therapies
for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.
The large quantity of clinical data being generated, wide spectrum of disease
presentations and rapidly changing clinical landscape present a critical need for
comprehensive evidence summaries and treatment comparisons. The overall aim of
this systematic literature review (SLR) was to assess available evidence regarding
efficacy and safety of potential pharmacological interventions for COVID-19.
Evidence retrieved was considered in the context of the evolving understanding of
the pathophysiology of COVID-19, the burden of COVID-19 in terms of mortality and
healthcare resource utilisation, and current knowledge gaps. Thus, the aim of the
analysis presented here was to synthesise evidence for mortality, hospitalisation and

Methods
Overview
This SLR (registered with the Research Registry, unique identifying number:
reviewregistry1019) evaluated studies of pharmacological options for the treatment
and prevention of COVID-19. The review was conducted according to the principles
embodied in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [26]
and guidance published by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination [27].

Search strategy
The systematic literature search was conducted from 1 December 2019 to 14 July
2020 and updated on 14 October 2020, using the electronic databases Embase,
MEDLINE® via the PubMed platform and The Cochrane Library. Details of the search
strings used for each database are presented in supplementary file 1. Searches
were supplemented by review of reports of pharmacological interventions for COVID19 included in a systematic and living map of COVID-19 evidence [28]. These
articles were assessed according to the same eligibility criteria as for the systematic
searches. As part of the 14 October update, an additional search of PubMed Central
was conducted following retrieval of one article from the systematic and living map
that was available in PubMed Central but not in the other databases searched.

Eligibility criteria
Key inclusion criteria were clinical trials of any pharmacological preventive or
treatment approach for COVID-19 of any stage, conducted in human subjects of any
age.

Treatment and prevention SLR

Exclusion criteria included studies of non-pharmacological interventions; traditional
or herbal medicines; studies that reported on in vitro or in silico investigations;
guidelines; clinical trial protocols or projection studies; or observational studies, such
as prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional
studies, case reports and case series. Articles that were not written in English,
reviews, comments, editorials, congress abstracts, and articles that had not
undergone peer review were also excluded.

Study selection
After removal of duplicates, records identified in the electronic database searches
were manually screened for eligibility on the basis of titles and abstracts by a single
reviewer, with a second reviewer screening ≥10% of records selected at random.
Any disagreements or uncertainties were discussed with a third reviewer to achieve
a consensus. Subsequently, full texts of potentially relevant studies were obtained
and reviewed for eligibility as for the first-pass screening. Studies containing
duplicate information or not meeting the inclusion criteria upon further review were
excluded.

Data extraction
Details of study design and population, interventions, comparators, follow-up
duration and safety and efficacy outcomes were extracted from identified articles
using a pilot-tested data extraction spreadsheet constructed in Microsoft Excel®. If
available, information on statistical comparisons between interventions was
recorded; any studies reporting insufficient data meeting the inclusion criteria were

excluded at the data extraction stage. All extracted data were cross-checked by an
independent reviewer.

Data synthesis and quality assessment
Included studies were reviewed and assessed for comparability in terms of study
design and outcomes reported. Randomised studies were included in the qualitative
synthesis if they reported ≥1 of the selected outcomes: mortality, hospitalisation (any
reported outcome, including duration, proportion of patients discharged and
incidence) and need for ventilation (use of oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and
intensive mechanical ventilation). Non-randomised trials reporting these outcomes
were only included if no randomised trial evidence was available for a particular
intervention.
Studies were grouped according to intervention and the disease phase targeted by
the intervention; details of the categorisation used are presented in supplementary
table 1. Studies reporting similar outcome measures were summarised descriptively
according to the type of intervention. Studies with outcomes that were defined
differently to other studies (e.g. event-free survival rather than percentage mortality,
or outcomes reported for the overall population rather than according to treatment
with [or allocation to] specific interventions) could not be grouped, and these were
assessed separately.
Each study was assessed in terms of methodological quality based on criteria
consistent with those in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions and the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool [26, 29].

Results
Summary of studies included
The literature searches identified 33,674 unique citations, and from these, 436 fulltext articles were assessed for eligibility (supplementary figure 1). A total of 375
articles were excluded as they did not meet eligibility criteria for reasons such as
reporting no outcomes of interest, presenting duplicate data from other studies or
having a non-interventional study design. A total of 61 articles were retained for
inclusion in the SLR and, of these, 43 articles, reporting on 42 trials [30-72], were
selected for qualitative synthesis, based on whether they reported ≥1 of the
outcomes of interest.
Details of the 18 articles that were not retained for qualitative synthesis are
summarised in supplementary table 2. An overview of the 43 articles included in the
qualitative synthesis is presented in supplementary figure 2, and detailed
characteristics of the individual trials are presented in supplementary table 3. The
majority of trials were conducted in patients hospitalised with COVID-19, but three
trials included non-hospitalised patients [37, 42, 44] and one was conducted in
asymptomatic adults with occupational or household exposure to COVID-19 [32]
(supplementary figure 2). Most trials used either standard care, which differed
between trials, or placebo as a comparator.

Mortality
In total, 39 randomised and one non-randomised trial reported on mortality, either as
the number of deaths that occurred during the study or as a pre-specified study
endpoint, with or without a statistical comparison between groups [30-36, 38-56, 58Page 9

70, 72]. One study included [71] was a re-analysis of data from another trial (Wang
et al. [46]) included in the qualitative synthesis. The outcomes for individual trials are
shown in figure 1.
Antivirals
Among trials of antivirals (figure 1A), four trials (N=48–66) reported trends towards
decreased mortality with interferons, sofosbuvir + daclatasvir, and triazavirin,
compared with standard care or placebo in patients with COVID-19 of varying
severity [61, 62, 69, 70]. Another trial (N=81) reported a significant reduction in 28day mortality with interferon (IFN) β-1a plus standard care compared with standard
care alone (19.0% versus 43.6%; P=0.015) in patients with severe COVID-19 [66].
The analysis also showed that administration of IFN β-1a early in the disease
significantly reduced mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 13.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]:
1.5–118) whereas late administration did not [66].
Of four trials that assessed lopinavir/ritonavir, three trials of patients with COVID-19
of varying severity (N=86–127) reported no deaths in either treatment group [39, 41,
64]. One trial (N=199) reported a numerical but non-significant reduction in 28-day
mortality with lopinavir/ritonavir versus standard care in patients with severe COVID19 [33]. Of four trials that investigated remdesivir in patients with moderate or severe
COVID-19, two trials (N=1062 and N=236) and the re-analysis of Wang et al. [71]
showed no significant mortality benefit of remdesivir compared with placebo [30, 46],
although one study showed a trend towards reduced mortality in patients who
received treatment earlier in their disease course (within 10 days of symptom onset)
[46]. The other two trials (N=397 and N=596) reported comparable mortality with 5day and 10-day remdesivir treatment [63, 72].

Anti-malarial and mucolytic drugs
Among eight trials of hydroxychloroquine or its derivatives (figure 1B), one trial
(N=81) reported significantly greater lethality with high doses of chloroquine
diphosphate compared with low doses (log-rank: −2.183; P=0.03) in patients with
severe COVID-19 [31]. Six trials (N=150–821) reported similar mortality with
hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, compared with standard care or
placebo in hospitalised [35, 47, 65] or non-hospitalised [32, 42, 44] patients with
mild, mild-to-moderate or severe COVID-19. Another trial (N=447) reported no
mortality benefit of adding azithromycin to hydroxychloroquine compared with
hydroxychloroquine alone in patients with severe COVID-19 [55]. In a trial of the
mucolytic drug, bromhexine (N=78), there was a significant reduction in mortality with
bromhexine plus standard care versus standard care alone (0% versus 12.8%;
P=0.027) in patients with COVID-19 of unspecified severity [49].
Anti-inflammatory drugs
Among trials of corticosteroids conducted in patients with severe COVID-19, three
trials (N=149–403) showed numerical but non-significant trends towards reduced
mortality with hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone compared with placebo or
standard care [48, 52, 68] (figure 1C). One trial (N=62) reported significantly reduced
mortality (5.9% versus 42.9%; P<0.001) with methylprednisolone plus standard care
versus standard care alone [54] (figure 1C). In a large trial (N=6425) of patients with
COVID-19 of unspecified severity, 28-day mortality was significantly decreased with
dexamethasone plus standard care versus standard care alone, both overall (22.9%
versus 25.7%; P<0.001) and in patients receiving oxygen (23.3% versus 26.2%) or
mechanical ventilation (29.3% versus 41.4%) at randomisation [45] (figure 1C). The

mortality benefit was greatest in patients with a longer duration of symptoms (>7
days versus ≤7 days; 12.3 by chi-square test for trend) [45]. Another trial (N=105),
also conducted in patients with COVID-19 of unspecified severity, showed
significantly increased event-free survival with the anti-inflammatory drug colchicine
in combination with standard care versus standard care alone (97% versus 83% of
patients after 10 days; P=0.03; data not shown graphically) [38].
Other therapies
Trials (N=20–135) investigating the kinase inhibitor, ruxolitinib [34]; the calcium
release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel inhibitor, auxora [58]; the anticoagulant,
enoxaparin [56]; and N-acetylcysteine, a mucolytic drug with anti-oxidant properties
[51], in patients with severe COVID-19 reported no significant difference in mortality
versus the comparator groups (figure 1C). One trial (N=200) reported a reduced 21day mortality with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhGCSF) added to standard care versus standard care alone (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.19;
95% CI: 0.04–0.88) in patients with severe COVID-19 [50].
Two studies reported on immunomodulatory therapies in patients with moderate
and/or severe COVID-19 (figure 1C): one single-arm trial (N=46) reported a mortality
of 6.5% with hyperimmune plasma [43], and another trial (N=103) reported numerical
but non-significant trends towards decreased mortality with convalescent plasma
versus standard care [40].

Hospitalisation
In total, 36 randomised trials and one non-randomised trial reported on
hospitalisation, either as a pre-specified study endpoint or the number of patients

experiencing a particular outcome during the study, with or without a statistical
comparison between groups [30, 32-35, 37-40, 42-57, 59-64, 66-70, 72].
Additionally, one study included [71] was a re-analysis of data from another trial
(Wang et al. [46]) included in the qualitative synthesis. Outcomes reported across
studies included median duration of hospitalisation (figure 2), proportion of patients
discharged during the study (table 2), incidence of intensive care unit (ICU)
admittance (table 2) and incidence of hospitalisation (supplementary figure 3).
Antivirals
Three trials of interferons (IFN ß-1a, IFN ß-1b or IFN- κ + trefoil factor 2 [TFF2];
[N=66–81]) added to standard care in patients with moderate or severe COVID-19
reported improvements in hospitalisation outcomes, including reduced hospitalisation
duration [67, 69] (figure 2A), a greater proportion of patients discharged [66, 69]
(table 2) and reduced incidence of ICU admittance [66, 69] (table 2) versus standard
care alone. Other trials (N=66 and N=88) reported reduced hospitalisation duration
with sofosbuvir + daclatasvir + standard care (6 versus 8 days; P=0.029) and early
versus late administration of favipiravir (14.5 versus 20 days; HR [95% CI]: 1.963
[1.331–2.894]) in patients with moderate or severe COVID-19 [70] or asymptomatic
to mild COVID-19 [53], respectively (figure 2A). Patients treated with sofosbuvir +
daclatasvir + standard care also had a significantly higher probability of hospital
discharge by day 14 (P=0.041) versus standard care alone (table 2).
Another trial (N=127), conducted in patients with COVID-19 of unspecified severity,
reported a significant reduction in median hospitalisation duration with
lopinavir/ritonavir + IFN ß-1b versus lopinavir/ritonavir alone [39]. When patients
were stratified according to the timing of treatment administration, median

hospitalisation was significantly reduced in patients who received treatment within 7
days of symptom onset, but not in those who received treatment later than this [39].
Among trials of remdesivir and the re-analysis of Wang et al., one trial (N=1062)
reported a reduced initial length of hospital stay with remdesivir versus placebo in
patients with severe COVID-19 (median, 12 versus 17 days) [30] (figure 2A). There
were trends towards more patients discharged with remdesivir versus
placebo/standard care, as well as with earlier remdesivir treatment in the remaining
trials [46, 63, 71, 72] (table 2), but between-group differences were either not
significant or not tested. A small pilot study (N=20) also reported a reduced mean
duration of hospitalisation (7 versus 13 days; P=0.02) with the antiretroviral,
azvudine plus standard care versus standard care alone in patients with mild
COVID-19 [59].
Anti-malarial and mucolytic drugs
Among six trials assessing hydroxychloroquine (N=194–821) [32, 35, 42, 44, 47, 55],
with or without azithromycin, no benefit was seen relative to the comparator groups
in terms of hospitalisation duration (figure 2A), incidence of ICU admittance (table 2)
or incidence of hospitalisation (supplementary figure 3). In a trial conducted in
patients with COVID-19 of unspecified severity (N=78), ICU admittance was
significantly reduced with bromhexine plus standard care versus standard care alone
(5.1% versus 28.2%; P=0.006) [49] (table 2).
Anti-inflammatory drugs
One trial (N=6425) reported a numerically shorter median duration of hospitalisation
(12 versus 13 days) and a greater probability of discharge alive within 28 days with

dexamethasone plus standard care versus standard care alone (rate ratio [95% CI]:
1.10 [1.03, 1.17]) in patients with COVID-19 of unspecified severity [45] (figure 2B;
table 2). In another trial of patients with severe COVID-19 (N=403), treatment with a
7-day fixed-dose course or shock-dependent dosing of hydrocortisone were
associated with reduced HRs for length of hospital and ICU stay; however, neither
treatment strategy met pre-specified criteria for statistical superiority [48]. A further
trial (N=62) reported a significantly reduced time to the composite outcome of
hospital discharge or death with methylprednisolone plus standard care versus
standard care alone in patients with severe COVID-19 (median, 11.6 versus 17.6
days; P=0.006) [54] (table 2). Other trials of anti-inflammatory agents (N=54–416)
reported no differences in hospitalisation outcomes versus comparators (figure 2C;
table 2; supplementary figure 3) [37, 38, 52, 68].
Other therapies
Among trials of other therapies, one trial (N=103) reported numerical but nonsignificant trends towards reduced hospitalisation duration and increased numbers of
patients discharged with convalescent plasma versus standard care [40] (figure 2B;
table 2). Trials of rhG-CSF (N=200), N-acetylcysteine (N=135), enoxaparin (N=20)
and ruxolitinib (N=43) reported no significant impact of these interventions on
hospitalisation outcomes versus standard care or placebo [34, 50, 51, 56] (figure 2B;
table 2).

Need for ventilation
In total, 30 randomised and one non-randomised trial, and one re-analysis of the
study by Wang et al. [46], reported outcomes relating to the need for oxygen, non-

invasive ventilation or intensive mechanical ventilation [30, 33-36, 38, 39, 41-43, 4552, 54-58, 61-63, 66, 68-72]. These endpoints were reported either as pre-specified
study endpoints or the number of patients receiving a particular intervention during
the study, with or without a statistical comparison between groups. The outcomes for
individual trials are shown in figure 3 and supplementary table 4.
Antivirals
Most trials of antivirals did not report a significant impact of the interventions
assessed on the number of patients requiring ventilation, nor on related outcomes
including duration of respiratory support (figure 3A; supplementary table 4).
However, there were trends towards decreased use of ventilation with IFN therapies,
sofosbuvir + daclatasvir and triazavirin (figure 3A) [61, 62, 66, 70]. Additionally, one
trial (N=81) of patients with severe COVID-19 reported an increased number of
patients extubated following treatment with IFN ß-1a plus standard care than with
standard care alone (53.5% versus 11.8%; P=0.019) [66] (supplementary table 4).
Another trial (N=1062), also conducted in patients with severe COVID-19, reported
fewer patients requiring new use of oxygen (36% versus 44%), non-invasive
ventilation (17% versus 24%) or intensive mechanical ventilation (13% versus 23%)

Four trials (N=194–665) reported no significant impact of hydroxychloroquine, with or
without azithromycin, on reducing the need for ventilation or improving other
respiratory outcomes compared with standard care, in patients with COVID-19 of a
range of severities [35, 42, 47, 55] (figure 3B; supplementary table 4). Among two
trials (N=78 and N=18) of bromhexine plus standard versus standard care alone, one

reported significantly reduced numbers of patients with COVID-19 of unspecified
severity requiring intensive mechanical ventilation with bromhexine (2.6% versus
23.1%; P=0.007) [49] (figure 3B). The other trial showed a numerical but nonsignificant trend towards reduced need for oxygen therapy with bromhexine (16.7%
versus 33.3%; P=0.11) versus standard care, in patients with mild or moderate
COVID-19 [57] (figure 3B).
Anti-inflammatory drugs
Among studies of anti-inflammatory drugs (figure 3B; supplementary table 4), one
randomised trial (N=6425) reported a statistically significantly decreased need for
invasive mechanical ventilation with dexamethasone plus standard care versus
standard care alone in patients with COVID-19 of unspecified severity [45]
(figure 3B). The risk of progression to invasive mechanical ventilation was also
significantly lower with dexamethasone than with standard care (risk ratio, 0.77; 95%
CI: 0.62, 0.95) [45]. Another trial (N=62) of patients with severe COVID-19 reported a
significant reduction in the proportion of patients receiving oxygen after 3 days of
treatment with methylprednisolone, compared with before treatment (82.4% versus
100%; P=0.025) [54] (figure 3B).
Other therapies
In a small trial (N=30), fewer patients with severe COVID-19 required invasive
mechanical ventilation; and the composite endpoint of death or invasive mechanical
ventilation occurred significantly less frequently in patients receiving auxora than in
those receiving standard care (HR: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.96; P<0.05) (figure 3B;
supplementary table 4) [58]. In another small trial (N=20), administration of
enoxaparin significantly reduced the median number of ventilator-free days

compared with low molecular weight/unfractionated heparin (0 versus 15 days;
P=0.028) and resulted in a higher ratio of successful liberation from mechanical
ventilation after respiratory failure (HR [95% CI]: 4.0 [1.035, 15.053]; P=0.031) in
patients with severe COVID-19 (supplementary table 4) [56]. Trials of ruxolitinib, Nacetylcysteine and rhG-CSF (N=43–200) showed no significant efficacy in reducing
need for ventilation in patients with severe COVID-19 [34, 50, 51] (figure 3B;
supplementary table 4).

Quality of evidence
There was variation among trials in terms of the risk of bias in the various domains
assessed (supplementary figure 4). Most trials were deemed at low risk of bias in
terms of complete reporting of patient and outcomes data. However, most trials were
also judged to be at high risk of bias in terms of blinding of participants and
researchers to the intervention received. Only four randomised double-blind trials
were considered to be at low risk of bias for all domains assessed [44, 46, 52, 68].

Discussion
This SLR assessed evidence, up to 14 October 2020, for the efficacy of
pharmacological interventions for COVID-19 in terms of mortality, hospitalisation and
need for ventilation. These outcomes were selected because COVID-19 has caused
significant mortality worldwide and continues to impart a substantial burden on
healthcare systems [21-24, 73]. Although observational studies have yielded
important and useful data, only clinical trials were included in this study to allow a
synthesis of the highest quality evidence available for each of the interventions
assessed.
Of 42 included trials, all but one assessed a treatment or treatment combination for
patients with established COVID-19. One trial assessed the use of
hydroxychloroquine as post-exposure prophylaxis in patients (N=821) with high-risk
or moderate exposure to COVID-19 versus placebo. There was no difference in
mortality or incidence of hospitalisation between groups, but the numbers of patients
experiencing these events were very low (no deaths occurred and only one
hospitalisation was reported in each group).
Among the trials assessing treatments in patients with COVID-19, interventions from
several treatment classes showed significant effects in improving one or more of
mortality, hospitalisation or need for ventilation outcomes. The most consistent effect
across all outcomes assessed was reported for the corticosteroid, dexamethasone,
in a preliminary report from the Randomised Evaluation of COVid-19 thERapY
(RECOVERY) trial (Clinical Trials.gov: NCT04381936). The study investigators
reported a significant reduction in mortality and a greater probability of discharge
alive within 28 days with dexamethasone plus standard care versus standard care

alone in patients who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen
at randomisation. Duration of hospitalisation was numerically shorter and the need
for invasive mechanical ventilation in patients who were not already receiving this at
randomisation was significantly reduced with the addition of dexamethasone to
standard care [45].
Other trials of anti-inflammatory drugs included in the present review presented
some evidence for efficacy in improving one or more of the outcomes assessed [38,
48, 52, 54, 68]. However, issues reported in these studies included small patient
numbers [54, 68], potentially being underpowered [52], and late administration of the
study treatment in some patients [68]. Further well-designed and adequately
powered studies are needed to increase the body of evidence for anti-inflammatory
drugs as treatment for COVID-19.
In this review, findings from trials assessing drugs acting in the early infection or
early pulmonary disease phase varied depending on the type of agent evaluated, the
disease stage of patients enrolled in the study and the timing of drug administration.
Some efficacy in reducing mortality, hospitalisation duration and need for ventilation
was seen with IFN therapies [66, 67, 69]; conversely, most trials of lopinavir/ritonavir
reported no significant benefit above standard care [33, 41, 64]. Similarly, and in line
with conclusions from published meta-analyses [74, 75], trials that assessed
hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, or its derivatives reported no impact of
these interventions on any of the outcomes of interest, and high doses of
chloroquine diphosphate were associated with increased lethality compared with low
doses in one trial [31].
Trials that assessed remdesivir compared with placebo or standard care also failed

to show a clear benefit in terms of reducing mortality, although one trial showed a
reduction in median hospitalisation duration and need for ventilation with remdesivir
compared with placebo [30]. Despite the lack of strong evidence of efficacy with
remdesivir, it is notable that this drug has received endorsement from regulatory
bodies for treating COVID-19 on the basis of data showing improved time to
recovery and fewer adverse events in remdesivir-treated patients versus placebo in
two clinical trials included in the present review, particularly in patients with less
severe disease [30, 46]. Consistent with these findings, a re-analysis of data from
one trial [46] suggested that remdesivir induced good responses in patients with
moderately severe, rather than critical, disease at enrolment [71]. Taken together,
the data suggest that remdesivir may improve recovery time if administered early
enough in the disease course; appropriate selection of patients with early-stage
disease in future trials of remdesivir may help to confirm this hypothesis.
Collectively, the findings from trials of drugs acting early in the pathophysiological
course of COVID-19 summarised in the present review are broadly in line with those
from the SOLIDARITY trial [76]. This international, randomised trial of COVID-19
treatments concluded that all four treatments evaluated (remdesivir,
hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferons) had little or no effect on
overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and hospitalisation duration in patients
hospitalised with COVID-19 [76]. A notable difference is that some studies in the
present review did show some efficacy of interferon therapies in reducing mortality
and improving hospitalisation outcomes [66, 67, 69], suggesting that these therapies
may warrant further investigation.
A key finding from this review was the relationship between the disease phase of

patients with COVID-19 and the efficacy of interventions. Several studies that
investigated agents targeting processes early in the disease course of COVID-19,
such as viral replication, showed improved efficacy in patients who received early
treatment compared with late treatment [33, 39, 46, 69]. Similarly, in a report from
the RECOVERY trial, the mortality benefit of dexamethasone was greatest in
patients with either the most severe disease or with the longest duration of
symptoms [45], which is consistent with it acting during the inflammatory phase of
the disease. These findings highlight the need for COVID-19 therapies to be tailored
to patients with disease stage and severity appropriate to the mechanism of action of
the intervention, as has been reported previously [77], in order for maximum efficacy
to be attained.
A small number of trials included in the present review reported on other types of
therapies, including kinase or CRAC channel inhibitor, anticoagulants, convalescent
plasma and other immunomodulatory or repair therapies [34, 40, 43, 50, 51, 56, 58].
Some studies showed either a significant efficacy effect or a trend towards improved
efficacy [34, 40, 50, 51, 56, 58]; however, in general the studies were of low quality
and further clinical trials are required for a more conclusive demonstration of
efficacy. In particular, although convalescent plasma has received emergency use
authorisation from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the decision was
controversial, owing to a lack of robust supporting data [12]. Only one study of
convalescent plasma (N=103) was included in the current review, and did not show
significant improvements in any of the outcomes assessed compared with standard
care [40]. Therefore, ongoing randomised studies, including the UK’s RECOVERY
trial, will be important in providing further evidence to clarify whether convalescent
plasma offers any benefit in treating COVID-19.

It was also notable that only one small clinical trial (N=20) [56] reported on an
anticoagulant, enoxaparin, despite many institutions having adopted anticoagulant
therapy as standard care for hospitalised patients with COVID-19. The data
presented were promising and showed a reduced need for ventilation compared with
patients receiving prophylactic anticoagulation. These findings support those from a
recently-published large observational study, which reported an association between
anticoagulant use and lower in-hospital mortality and intubation rates in patients
hospitalised with COVID-19 [78]. Upcoming randomised trials will provide valuable
data regarding the optimal type, duration and dose of anticoagulants for different
patients.
Strengths of this SLR include the comprehensive search strategy, rigorous screening
methodology and quality assessment of included studies. Although several other
reviews of COVID-19 therapies have been published [7, 79, 80], we believe that our
overview of the current state of the field makes an important contribution to the
existing body of evidence, particularly by considering the efficacy of current
treatments in the context of the disease phase in which they are used.
Limitations include the exclusion of non-English articles from searches, which may
have resulted in some relevant trials not being identified. Additionally, the searches
were conducted in three major databases but did not include smaller or countryspecific databases. Congress abstracts were excluded, on the basis of their data
being preliminary and not peer reviewed. Owing to time constraints and the fastmoving nature of the field, a review of citations in the reference lists of published
SLRs and meta-analysis was not conducted; and, similarly, the review will not have
captured relevant studies published after the date of the final search update.

Our ability to analyse and compare the data collected was limited by the significant
variation between the trials identified, owing to differences in study design, blinding
of participants, severity of illness of participants, drug doses and timing,
comparators, follow-up times and outcome definitions. Most trials administered
interventions in addition to standard care, which varies between countries and has
changed during the pandemic as the body of evidence for the efficacy and safety of
different therapies has accumulated. Similarly, the overall lack of high-quality
evidence for all interventions makes it difficult to make comparisons between
interventions.
Most of the trials included in this SLR were assessed as having a high risk of bias in
one or more of the domains evaluated, meaning that the results of the analysis of all
outcomes should be interpreted with caution. A variety of factors contributed to this:
some trials were pilot [36, 57, 59, 61] or proof-of-concept [43] trials, including small
patient numbers and might not have been optimally designed to show an
improvement in the study outcomes. Similarly, some trials were under-powered to
show significant differences between interventions [34, 40, 42, 46, 56, 64, 65]. Some
trials did not include a randomised placebo control group and many trials were not
double-blinded. Moreover, the follow-up period in most trials was between 14 and 28
days, and most studies did not report any longer-term data. This might have limited
the ability to assess mortality and hospital discharge, particularly in patients with
severe COVID-19 who often have a prolonged duration of illness.
These findings are in agreement with those reported in a living systematic review
and meta-analysis of drug treatments for COVID-19, last updated in September 2020
[80]. The authors concluded that the effectiveness of most of the interventions that

they assessed was uncertain, owing to the small numbers of patients enrolled in
randomised controlled trials at the time and important limitations of the study designs
[80]. A European Medicines Agency statement noted that small studies and
compassionate programmes are unlikely to generate the required level of evidence
to define the best treatment options for COVID-19 and stressed the need for multiarm randomised controlled trials of interventions [81]. However, it should be
acknowledged that the COVID-19 global public health emergency has presented an
urgent need for clinical data on available interventions for the disease, with the FDA
granting some substances emergency use authorisation (table 1). Thus, the
available data are valuable for the purpose of practical clinical decision making.

Conclusions
This SLR summarises evidence regarding efficacy of pharmacological interventions
in terms of mortality, hospitalisation and need for ventilation in patients with COVID19, and highlights the need for adequately powered, well-designed clinical trials to
increase the quality of available evidence. The summary of findings also suggests
the need to use interventions appropriate for the disease stage of COVID-19, to
maximise treatment efficacy. Although no relevant data from vaccine, antibody and
other novel COVID-19-specific treatments were available at the time of conducting
this review, the findings from ongoing clinical trials are awaited with interest.

FIGURE 3. Need for ventilation in trials of antivirals (A) and other therapies (B)
included in the qualitative synthesis

Other therapies include anti-malarial drugs, mucolytic drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, anticoagulants,
immunomodulatory therapies and repair therapies. Results from two studies are not presented graphically. Li Y et
al. [41] reported need for intensive mechanical ventilation in two of 13 severe patients (15.4%); Deftereos et al.
[38] reported need for ventilation among seven patients who met the primary clinical endpoint: in the control
group, one of seven patients (14.3%) needed non-invasive mechanical ventilation and five (71.4%) were
intubated and ventilated mechanically. The patient in the colchicine group who met the endpoint needed invasive
mechanical ventilation.
