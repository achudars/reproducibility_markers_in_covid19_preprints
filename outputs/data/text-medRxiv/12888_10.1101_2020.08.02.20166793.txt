Summary
Background: Countries have adopted different approaches, at different times, to reduce the
transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Cross-country comparison could indicate
the relative efficacy of these approaches. We assess various non-pharmaceutical interventions
(NPIs) over time, comparing the effects of self-imposed (i.e. voluntary) behavior change and of
changes enforced via official regulations, by statistically examining their impacts on subsequent
death rates in 13 European countries.
Methods and findings: We examine two types of NPI: the introduction of government-enforced
closure policies over time; and self-imposed alteration of individual behaviors in response to
awareness of the epidemic, in the period prior to regulations. Our proxy for the latter is Google
mobility data, which captures voluntary behavior change when disease salience is sufficiently
high. The primary outcome variable is the rate of change in COVID-19 fatalities per day, 16-20
days after interventions take place. Linear multivariate regression analysis is used to evaluate
impacts. Voluntarily reduced mobility, occurring prior to government policies, decreases the
percent change in deaths per day by 9.2 percentage points (95% CI 4.5-14.0 pp). Government
closure policies decrease the percent change in deaths per day by 14.0 percentage points (95% CI
10.8-17.2 pp). Disaggregating government policies, the most beneficial are intercity travel
restrictions, cancelling public events, and closing non-essential workplaces. Other subcomponents, such as closing schools and imposing stay-at-home rules, show smaller and
statistically insignificant impacts.
Conclusions: This study shows that NPIs have substantially reduced fatalities arising from
COVID-19. Importantly, the effect of voluntary behavior change is of the same order of magnitude
as government-mandated regulations. These findings, including the substantial variation across
dimensions of closure, have implications for the phased withdrawal of government policies as the
epidemic recedes, and for the possible reimposition of regulations if a second wave occurs,
especially given the substantial economic and human welfare consequences of maintaining
lockdowns.

Introduction
Over the course of six months only, the transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
has spread to 188 countries worldwide: so far, COVID-19 has infected tens of millions of
individuals and killed hundreds of thousands1. In the absence of available effective biomedical
interventions like vaccines and treatments, and in anticipation of an unprecedented surge of
patients in need of intensive care in hospitals, a large number of national responses have focused
on the implementation of drastic non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), including the closing
of schools and universities, the prohibition of most commercial business, and the legal enforcement
of local lockdowns and ‘shelter-in-place’ orders. As a result, in June 2020 an estimated 1.2 billion
children who should have been attending schools were not doing so 2, with long-term consequences
for learning potential and the creation of national capital, and hundreds of millions of adults have
had to cease their economic activities, with profound and immediate consequences for national
economies and personal livelihoods and well-being. This is much more than a global health crisis 3.
Now that the epidemic shows signs of receding in Western Europe, countries are urgently reconsidering their NPI policies, especially when and how to suspend or reverse the school closure
and ‘shelter-in-place’ policies that have such substantial developmental and economic
consequences. The challenge, however, is that the method used to select the NPIs may be less
helpful in planning their reversal. In the absence of real data or prior experience, the evidence base
supporting the rollout of such unprecedented NPIs relied on mathematical forecasting models 4-7
drawing on input parameters for epidemiologic quantities like severity and attack rate, risk factors,
and timing of transmission, for which empirical validation remains nascent 8. These assumptions
may have been inadvertently misleading, hence need careful reassessment before being used as
the basis for future decisions. For instance, with respect to school closures, a recent review 9 and
preliminary findings from France10 suggest that school children are not important drivers of
coronavirus epidemics, in contrast to influenza, and school closure might play a substantially
smaller role than the models had projected.
The need now is to retrospectively assess the true impact of NPIs on COVID-related morbidity
and mortality, and to plan their withdrawal using empirical evidence. However, little work to date

has conducted retrospective analyses of the possible mitigating effects of NPIs on the COVID
death toll11-16. In this paper, we use an up-to-date time series of COVID-related mortality data from
13 comparable Western European countries. We undertake a statistical examination of the timing
of introduction of NPIs and their impact on daily COVID deaths. Crucially, we include not only
the full spectrum of government-mandated regulations but also measures of voluntary behavior
change before the introduction of the government policies. This allows us to directly compare the
effects of naturally-salient social distancing and enhanced hygiene practices, versus externally
imposed and enforced regulations, with a view to contributing to the ongoing debate regarding reevaluating school and workplace closures and other dimensions of reopening in Europe and
beyond.

Methods
Data
Daily figures for new confirmed COVID-19 deaths by country were accessed through the
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control 17. We used data for the 13 Western European
countries with greater than 500 COVID deaths as of 16 May (Table 1), all of which had seven to
eleven weeks of data, starting with t0 which is defined when the five-day moving average of daily
deaths is first equal to at least five. This period captures all of the closure policies but (for
simplicity) none of the subsequent relaxation of guidelines – where government and voluntary
impacts are more difficult to disentangle.
COVID mortality data were used because: death constitutes a significant event; death certifications
are less likely (than case notifications) to suffer from misclassifications; and the completeness of
death data is far greater than that of case notification data due to varying testing capacity and
accuracy across countries. However, (i) actual death tolls are still likely to differ from currently
reported figures due to reporting issues; (ii) recording protocols can affect total numbers (for
example whether deaths in nursing care homes are included); and (iii) reported date of death can
be delayed from the actual date of death. Issues (i) and (ii) are mitigated here by focusing on
relative changes in deaths, which also allows us to abstract away from total population size. Issue
(iii) is mitigated in part by taking a five-day moving average of deaths. Hence, as our dependent

variable, we study the evolution over time of the following percentage change in smoothed daily
deaths:

∑

𝑑,
∑

−∑
𝑑,

𝑑,

(1)

where 𝑑 , is the daily reported number of deaths in country i on day t.
To get a sense for the behavior of this variable ∆ , , note that early in the pandemic the number of
deaths per day is typically rising, corresponding to the number of new infections having been
growing a few weeks earlier, which implies that ∆ , > 0. Late in the pandemic, when the number
of daily deaths is declining, this percent change will be negative. In between, each day will yield
approximately the same number of deaths and hence our dependent variable will be around zero.
Smaller values are always better, since they imply a slower rise in fatalities (if positive) or a more
rapid decline (if negative). Table A1 in the supplementary appendix shows the distribution of
values of this variable in our data, week by week.
For the interventions, we focus on two broad categories: government-imposed policies and
regulations, versus self-imposed and voluntary actions. The Oxford COVID-19 Government
Response Tracker provides dates and intensities for multiple categories of government policies
across the globe18. Here, we focus on their ‘containment and closure’ categories: school closing;
workplace closing; canceling public events; restricting public events and gathering sizes; closing
public transport; stay-at-home (or ‘shelter-in-place’) requirements; and restrictions on internal
movement and international travel. We define two alternate versions of the government closure
measure: first, an easy-to-interpret binary one, which is directly comparable to the voluntary
measure defined below, occurs when broad stay-at-home restrictions are initially promulgated; and
second, a continuous closure measure which is simply the sum of scores across all categories,
normalized by dividing by the maximum such score in the database.
Importantly, we also look at self-imposed restrictions on behavior which arose prior to the
introduction of governmental interventions. Our primary measure, mobility decline, is based on
Google’s Community Mobility Reports19, which assess physical mobility along different
dimensions, as compared to a pre-crisis baseline within each country. Our indicator (dummy)

variable switches from 0 to 1 in a given country when the mobility index is negative (representing
activity being below baseline levels) and remains so thereafter, for all of the three mobility
categories corresponding to workplaces, transit stations, and retail and recreation. Figure 1 presents
mobility data for three illustrative countries. We do not consider residential mobility, since that
does not necessarily correspond to social distancing. Similar changes were observed in China early
in the pandemic, where regional air pollution, indicative of reduced traffic and production,
decreased after cases were reported locally but before any government restrictions had been
imposed20.
The mobility indicator switches back from 1 to 0 when the government binary closure indicator
turns on in that country, because the goal is to evaluate the effect of naturally-occurring behavior
change. If binary closure takes place before self-imposed mobility decline (as in Austria and
Germany), then the mobility variable remains equal to 0 throughout the study period. As with
closure, we also define a continuous version of this variable equal to the normalized sum of
mobility decline across the three relevant categories, on a given date.
Evidently, none of these interventions, either regulatory or voluntary, will have an immediate
effect on fatalities due to COVID-19. Rather, we hypothesize that they will change the rate of new
infections, leading to a change in deaths some time later. In order to model that delay, we assume
that it is the sum of the incubation period, estimated to be 5 days 4, and the period from symptom
onset to death (for those who die), which has an observed median of 13 days 21. Note that the overall
typical time to death will be different from 13 days, because in a growing epidemic proportionately
more observations are from recent infections (some of whom will die later). We are modeling the
observed data in the midst of a growing epidemic, hence it is precisely the raw data that we need
to match. Thus we assume a median lag of 18 days from time of intervention to time of death.
There is naturally some distribution for this lag, thus we employ a 5-day moving average of deaths,
corresponding to lags from 16-20 days (Table 1).
Figure 2 shows the 5-day average deaths for three illustrative countries, along with the median
dates at which binary closure and (if relevant) binary mobility decline are assumed to have taken
effect. The three countries include Spain and the UK, which both have relatively large populations,

but where the local epidemic started relatively early and relatively late respectively, as well as
Sweden, which is unique in our sample in that the government never imposed stay-at-home
regulations.

Modeling approach
We evaluate the effect of NPIs on the rate of change in COVID deaths via a linear regression
model. We study the evolution over time of the daily percentage change in deaths, using a random
effect specification to further net out a range of country-specific factors that might affect both the
total number of deaths and local behavioral and policy changes, such as the scale of the epidemic,
political ideology, or infrastructure differences. We employed the following model specification
for the daily percentage change in COVID deaths in country i at time t:
∆ , = 𝛼 + 𝛽 𝐵𝑒ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑜𝑟 ,(

)

+ 𝛽 𝑃𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑦 ,(

and 𝑃𝑜𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑦 ,(

are indicators of behavioral and policy changes, respectively:

+ 𝛾𝑋 + 𝜇 𝑡 + 𝜇 𝑡 + 𝑒 ,

(2)

they are lagged by 18 days to reflect when policy changes materialize, as detailed above. 𝑋 is a
vector of country-specific controls: share of population over 65 22, population density22, the number
of acute care beds per 100,000 population23, as well as the starting date of the epidemic in each
country (Table 1). Lastly, t counts the number of days since the start of the epidemic in each
country: this captures exogenous time trends, as well as any endogenous learning by both
individuals and clinicians. Because this effect is expected to be nonlinear, we also include t2 as an
independent variable.
In order to help interpret the implications of the effect sizes, we estimated the number of days for
deaths to double, as of one week into the epidemic, under the assumptions of no intervention;
closure only; and salience only. To do this, we fixed t =7, predicted the expected country-average
growth rate ∆(

Finally, we estimated the number of COVID deaths that would have occurred in the first seven
weeks from the local starting date, under analogous situations: no intervention; closure only
(starting at t=7); and salience only (starting at t=7). This was calculated by summing deaths from
t=0 (normalized to our threshold of 5) through t=50, after iterating forward using the modeled
growth rates in each of the three hypothetical policy configurations. This is done at the level of
individual countries, which cannot be directly compared to one another using our analysis but are
illustrative of what would occur as a function of different underlying conditions. In particular, the
primary cross-country variation in our model comes from the starting calendar date of the
epidemic.
All statistical analyses used STATA/SE version 13.0. All data comes from publicly available
aggregate sources, so no ethical approval was required. No external funding was utilized during
the course of the study.

Results
Table 2 presents the main results, with Model I being the preferred specification. The first row
shows that as time passes, regardless of any external intervention, death rates go down.
Specifically, for each day that passes, the daily change in fatalities goes down by 0.88 (0.67-1.10)
percentage points. For similar reasons (results not shown), countries that experienced the start of
the pandemic earlier -- such as Italy and Spain -- fare worse than those that experienced it later -such as Germany and The Netherlands.
The central finding is that both the voluntary measure and the closure measure have substantial
and highly statistically significant impacts on death rates 18 days later. A binary reduction in selfimposed mobility is associated with a 9.2 (4.5-14.0) percentage point reduction in the daily rateof-change in fatalities, while binary government restrictions are associated with a 14.0 (10.8-17.2)
percentage point reduction. This means that if deaths were growing by 5% per day, then voluntary
behavior change would cause them to start declining by 4.2% per day, while government
regulations would cause them to decline by 9% per day.

Models II and III estimate the same specification but with fatality lags of 17 and 19 days
respectively, confirming that the results are robust across modeling choices. Model IV shows that
the continuous measures also yield similar results. The closure measure in this case has a larger
magnitude because it can be interpreted as all government policies being enacted at the maximal
observed level simultaneously. The supplementary appendix reports further sensitivity analyses:
first a specification of the main results with country fixed effects; second an alternate proxy for
voluntary behavior change, occurring when the number of national deaths surpasses a salience
threshold; and third the equalization of the length of data across countries.
Table 3 extends this analysis to separately examine the effect arising from different components
of the continuous closure metric. Model I looks at all eight categories individually, finding that
three of them are significant at the 5% level: closing non-essential workplaces is estimated to
reduce the change in deaths by 4.7 (0.3-7.1) pp; restricting public events reduces it by 5.7 (1.59.9) pp; and limiting international travel reduces it by 4.8 (0.7-9.0) pp. Models II and III combine
similar categories to examine consistency across domains, until finally model IV is the fully
aggregated version replicating model IV in Table 2. This suggests that the results are stable across
the combined versions, with the possible exception of limiting public events (which no longer
appears effective when combined with restrictions on the size of gatherings).
In order to help interpret the magnitudes of the effect sizes, we use the coefficients in Model I of
Table 2 to estimate the number of days for deaths to double, as of t = 7, under three scenarios: no
intervention of any kind, self-imposed behavior change, and government-enforced closure.
Doubling time is increased from 3.0 (2.7 – 3.4 days) to 4.5 days (3.7 – 5.8 days) with a voluntary
reduction in mobility, or to 6.1 days (5.0 – 8.1 days) with government lockdown.
Finally, Table 4 compares our projections of the expected number of deaths under three different
scenarios – no intervention, salience from t = 7, and closure from t = 7 – with reality for exemplar
countries. Spain experienced an early local start to the pandemic and we estimate that it would
have had 174,935 deaths in the first 50 days if there had been no interventions at all. In reality it
had 23,467 deaths over that period – but if it had closed down two weeks earlier, deaths would
have been only 3,487. Even with purely self-imposed changes throughout, if they had begun early,
the number of deaths would have been only 11,430. Thus the timing of interventions is crucial,

more important than the severity: tens of thousands of lives could have been saved even without a
full lockdown. Meanwhile Sweden experienced a later start and hence is estimated, in the absence
of any interventions, at 53,528 deaths in its first 50 days. Reality was 3,271 deaths – similar to our
projection in the case of voluntary changes only (since that was indeed what happened there,
although the timing was slightly different) – while government closure could have reduced this
further to 1,494.

Discussion
Using daily death data from 13 European countries, we find that NPIs can substantially reduce
fatalities from COVID-19. Both self-initiated behavior change prior to official government
guidelines, as well as more strict regulations themselves, had a significant effect on the ensuing
rate of change of deaths. Intriguingly, the magnitudes of the two approaches are not vastly different
from one another: government closures reduce the growth rate of deaths by around 14 percentage
points, while behavior change in the absence of government pronouncements reduces the growth
rate by just over 9 percentage points. Either approach, applied sufficiently but realistically early,
would have saved thousands of lives in a typical country in our sample.
Most previous observational analyses of NPIs – primarily stay-at-home and social distancing
directive – have focused on cases rather than fatalities, either in individual countries 24-27 or across
multiple countries28-29. There is limited existing work regarding the effect specifically of stay-athome policies on deaths, in Brazil11, France12-13, and the United States14-15, but not of the full range
of government interventions. The most similar analysis to this paper comes from Imperial
College16, which examines the impact of regulations on fatalities in 11 European countries. They
assess multiple government interventions (including explicit encouragement of social distancing)
but do not consider voluntary behavior change. Their main result is that lockdowns had a strong
impact but that no other policies (social distancing, limiting public events, closing schools, or selfisolation) had a significant effect at all. Our conclusions are very different, perhaps due to the fact
that we take a naïve but direct statistical approach to the relationships rather than filtering them
through a complex structural model. One other paper30 examines the impact of multiple
interventions on cases (not deaths) across six countries globally, using a similar reduced-form

approach to that taken here. However like the others it does not consider voluntary changes, so its
counterfactual scenario (exponential growth of 38% per day in the absence of policy) becomes less
and less realistic over time, exaggerating the role of explicit policies in flattening the curve.
To our knowledge, no previous study has explored the remarkable impact of self-imposed behavior
change, yet these empirical results suggest that enforced lockdown regulations offer only modestly
stronger epidemiological outcomes than well-timed voluntary behavior change.

This is an

important observation in the context of addressing future spikes or epidemics in other countries,
especially given that self-motivated behaviors – such as social distancing, improved personal
hygiene, reducing unnecessary travel, and working remotely when possible – are intrinsically less
disruptive and more individually malleable than regulatory options – such as shelter-in-place
orders, closing schools, and banning public transit. Most importantly, as the pandemic is expanding
in low- and middle-income countries in regions like South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa where the
health systems are often weak, where the sociodemographic and cultural traits differ immensely,
and where the great majority of people live on a daily wage, weighing the feasibility along with
the full benefits and costs of NPIs will be critical31.
The results also provide insights into which of the government regulations were more effective
when we disaggregate government policies into various subcategories. Limiting travel, particularly
international travel, seems to have a significant effect, as does closure of non-essential workplaces.
However other categories, including closing schools and imposing stay-at-home rules, show
smaller and statistically insignificant effects. These subcategory findings are to be interpreted with
caution, in part because there is less variation than optimal across countries in our sample, but they
do suggest that policy-makers should think carefully about whether – and if so for how long – the
various restrictions, some of which are known to inflict large costs on health, education, welfare
and the economy, are necessary.
As one of the first studies to explore these issues empirically using substantial data, this analysis
inevitably involves a number of limitations. Without randomization or other exogenous variation
in the treatments, evidently, we cannot fully ascertain a causal link between the NPIs and the
resulting changes in death rates. We do not expect any reverse causality, since future deaths will

not change current behaviors. However, it is conceivable that some third variable, for instance
heightened media attention and scrutiny, could directly influence both government policies and
individual behaviors. Future studies, using data on this and similar potential confounders, may be
able to fully disentangle the various mechanisms at play. Finally, the quality of the fatality data is
subject to variation in reporting standards across countries, although this will be partially mitigated
by focusing on rates of change rather than levels. Similarly, the quality of the government closure
data is, although compiled independently and not biased in any way, somewhat subjective in nature
as to the precise degree of severity in each category at each point in time.
The main messages here are that NPIs can have significant impacts in reducing COVID-19
mortality, and that the empirical evidence suggests that the simpler, more flexible and more easily
reversed interventions that result in self-motivated voluntary behavioral change, working remotely
to the extent possible, and reducing large-scale discretionary travel, are as effective as stricter
officially imposed regulations. Precisely why that is we cannot say from this analysis, but the
distinction may be important to those countries still in the earlier stages of responding to the
pandemic, particularly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Effective planning and evidencebased policy is that much more important for countries where finances are limited, health systems
are weak, and the majority of people rely on a daily wage.

Notes: Deaths data cumulative up to and including 16 May. We describe policy changes as taking effect over a 5-day date range because our model uses a 5-day rolling
average. t0 denotes the date at which the 5-day rolling average reached five deaths, which we define as the start of the epidemic.

measure calculated by summing the same three measures of the Google Mobility Index and normalizing across countries; binary closure is our
binary variable based on the Oxford Policy Tracker index for stay-at-home restrictions; and continuous closure is a measure calculated by
summing all 8 ‘containment and closure’ categories in the Oxford Policy Tracker and normalizing across countries. We make one small
change to the Oxford data: defining the German lockdown as being nationwide instead of regional. N is lower in Model IV because the lagged
mobility data is only available for Italy from the third day of the epidemic.

The distribution of the 5-day average of deaths shows that the growth in deaths is monotonically
decreasing over time, but less and less strongly as time passes, supporting the assumption of our
linear plus quadratic specification. In week 1 mortality is increasing in all countries, after which it
begins to decline for many but not all observations, and finally the downward trend seems to
plateau by weeks 6-7.

Table A2 presents the results running Models I-IV in Table 2 using a fixed effect specification
illustrated in Equation (A1). The model includes a 𝜃 term to capture country-specific variation of
the kind described above, and excludes 𝑋 due to collinearity. However, while it does not require
the random effects assumption (that conditional on country controls all other country-specific
variation is distributed randomly), the fixed effects model is less efficient compared with the
random effects model. We run a Hausman test, without clustering standard errors, to confirm the
validity of the random effects assumption by comparing the estimates in our fixed effects model
to our random effects model with controls. The results confirm the random effects assumption,
and so we use the random effects model as our primary specification.

Notes: Model III limits the number of days of data in each regression to 50, which is the lowest total in the group of countries (Ireland).

Mobility decline has the advantage of objectively measuring behavior, but it only captures a subset
of the relevant aspects – in particular nothing to do with personal hygiene (e.g. handwashing) or
with maintaining distance when interacting with others. Although we cannot directly measure
these, we can proxy for them by noting that they greatly increase in prevalence when the pandemic
becomes locally salient, approximated when the average daily number of deaths reaches 5 in any
given country (i.e. at time t0; table 1). We refer to this measure as inherent salience, switching

from 0 to 1 at time t0, as long as that is before binary closure takes effect, and switching off again
when closure applies. Model II of Table A2 tests this measure of inherent salience. We find that
the coefficient is negative, but insignificant. Closure is still negative and significant, but the effect
size is reduced. Separately, in our main specification some countries are effectively more heavily
weighted than others since we have more data available for countries whose epidemics began
earlier. Model III removes all datapoints later than the shortest epidemic length (Ireland at 50
days). Compared to Model I we find that the coefficients are still significant and roughly the same
magnitude, suggesting that this country weighting effect does not introduce a material bias.
