Abstract
The serosurvey is an alternative way to know the magnitude of the population infected by
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since the expansion of capacity of the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) to detect the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
was delayed. We herein report seroprevalence of COVID-19 accessed in the two community
clinics in Tokyo. The point-of-care immunodiagnostic test was implemented to detect the
SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody in the peripheral capillary blood. The overall positive
percentage of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody is 3.83% (95% confidence interval: 2.76-5.16) for the
entire cohort (n =1,071). The central Tokyo of 23 special wards exhibited a significantly higher
prevalence compared to the other area of Tokyo (p =0.02, 4.68% [95%CI: 3.08-6.79] versus
1.83 [0.68-3.95] in central and suburban Tokyo, respectively). The seroprevalence of the cohort
surveyed in this study is low for herd immunity, which suggests the need for robust disease
control and prevention. A community-based approach, rather than state or prefectural levels, is
of importance to figure out profiles of the SARS-COV-2 outbreak.

Introduction
A current challenge for the measurement of the future outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) is to find a more focused or personalized strategy of infection control such as
contact tracing until the establishment of the herd immunity by the previous infection or
vaccination which is under development.1 The New York State announced that the
seroprevalence in lower-income communities was higher than the overall population (27 versus
20% of positive for IgG of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2,
respectively).2 We already described our interim analysis of point-of-care antibody testing for
COVID-19, conducted in the community clinics in Tokyo, Japan.3 We herein reported our
extensive analysis which showed unique geographical characteristics of seroprevalence of
COVID-19 in Tokyo.
Methods
The Institutional Review Board of Navitas Clinic approved the present study (Approval
Number: NC2020-01). Asymptomatic subjects have been recruited by web posting of our clinic,
and written consent was obtained from all participants prior to the test. The present study here is
an observational study analyzing data collected from the medical record. The study participants
paid the cost of the point-of-care test since no insurance and public funding was not available to
defray it in Japan.
The SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody in the peripheral capillary blood was detected
by the point-of-care immunodiagnostic test (SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Testing Kit IgG RF-NC002,
Kurabo Industries Ltd, Osaka, Japan) in the two community clinics located in the major railway
stations in Tokyo (Navitas Clinic Shinjuku and Tachikawa). The rapid test implemented in this
study indicated 76.4, 100 and 94.2% of positive, negative and overall agreement rates,
respectively, in accordance with the manufacturer's investigation.
The 95% exact binomial confidential interval (CI) was calculated with the method of
Clopper-Pearson using PASS 14 (NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, UT). Statistical significance was
considered when two-side p-value <0.05. The descriptive and Fisher's exact test was performed
with IBM SPSS Statistics 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY)
Results
The overall positive percentage of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody is 3.83% (95% CI: 2.76-5.16) for
the entire cohort (n =1,071) (Table 1). No trend of increase in the positive proportion by time
was observed (Supplemental Table 1). All participants who had a history of SARS-CoV-2 PCR
positive (n =5) showed positive results of IgG, whereas IgG positive was also seen in two with
the PCR negative. The seroprevalence in central Tokyo of 23 special wards was significantly

higher than the other area of Tokyo after classification by residence (p =0.02, 4.68% [95%CI:
3.08-6.79] versus 1.83 [0.68-3.95] in central and suburban Tokyo, respectively). Furthermore,
we found the regional trend inside the central Tokyo; the highest and lowest prevalence was
found in the Southern and Northern areas (7.92% [95%CI: 3.48-15.01] and 0 [0.00-5.13]),
respectively, although no statistical significance was observed. (Supplementary Table 2 and
Supplementary Figure for classification of regions).
Discussion
The overall seroprevalence in this study is low as the survey in Los Angeles,4 which suggests
that the majority of the population is immunologically naÃ¯ve for SARS-CoV-2. Naturally, the
prevalence is higher in the place with a higher density of population, such as central Tokyo,
since the SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted by droplets. The regional trend of
seroprevalence is similar to the cumulative number of COVID-19 patients per unit population
(Supplementary Table 3). These facts suggest that the community-based investigation would be
beneficial to explore the cause of epidemic contagion. Limitation includes the selection bias and
accuracy of the test kit. Concerns about the risk of COVID-19 infection such as past fever,
illness of cohabitants or co-workers and working environment were common reasons for the
participation of this study, which can cause elevation of seroprevalence. Less sensitivity of test
kit develops the underestimation of the prevalence. Further serosurvey, along with the fine
characterization of population, is warranted for the measurement of a future outbreak.
