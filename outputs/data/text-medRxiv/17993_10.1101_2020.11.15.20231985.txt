ABSTRACT
Introduction
Long-term effects of Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and their sustainability in a large
number of patients are of the utmost relevance. We aimed to determine: 1)functional capacity of
non-severe COVID-19 survivors by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET); 2)those
characteristics associated with worse CPET performance.
Methods
We prospectively enrolled the first 150 consecutive subjects with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19
infection discharged alive from March to April 2020 at Azienda Sanitaria Locale (ASL)3, Genoa,
Italy. At 3-month from hospital discharge, complete clinical evaluation, trans-thoracic
echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), pulmonary function test (PFT), and
dominant leg extension (DLE) maximal strength evaluation were performed.
Results
Excluding severe and incomplete/missing cases, 110 patients were analyzed. Median percent
predicted peak oxygen uptake (%pVO2) was 90.9(79.2-109.0)%. Thirty-eight(34.5%) patients had
%pVO2 below, whereas 72(65.5%) above the 85% predicted value (indicating normality). Median
PFT parameters were within normal limits.
Eight(21.1%) patients had a mainly respiratory, 9(23.7%) a mainly cardiac, 3(7.9%) a mixedcardiopulmonary, and 18(47.4%) a non-cardiopulmonary limitation of exercise. Eighty-one(73.6%)
patients experimented at least one symptom, without relationship with %pVO2 (p>0.05).
Multivariate linear regression analysis showed age (β=0.46, p=0.020), percent weight loss (β=-0.77,
p=0.029), active smoke status (β=-7.07, p=0.019), length of hospital stay (β=-0.20, p=0.042), and
DLE maximal strength (β=1.65, p=0.039) independently associated with %pVO2.
Conclusions
Half of non-severe COVID-19 survivors show functional capacity limitation mainly explained by
muscular impairment, albeit cardiopulmonary causes are possible. These findings call for future
research to identify patients at higher risk of long-term effects, that may benefit from careful
surveillance and targeted rehabilitation.

INTRODUCTION
To date, the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic accounts for more than 50 million
confirmed cases and up to 1 million deaths worldwide[1]. Whereas handling the initial phase has
been challenging for health systems, the sheer number of cases raises alarm about the sustainability
of even minor sequelae after hospital discharge.
COVID-19 is a mainly respiratory disease, but cardiovascular (CV) alterations are also associated
with worse prognosis[2]. For the chronic phase, the main concerns are the development of
pulmonary interstitial disease and/or a lingering CV involvement, as hypothesized by a recent CV
magnetic resonance study[3] and potentially explained by the Severe Acute Respiratory SyndromeCoronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV2)-associated endothelitis[4]. How to intercept, assess, and treat
this large number of patients with potential long-term consequences of COVID-19 remains
uncertain, with the hypothesized rehabilitative effort mainly focused on the post-intensive care
patients[5, 6]. It should be noted, however, that among the 20,000+ COVID-19 patients hospitalized
in Italy and discharged alive, those classified as clinically severe or critical represent less than
20%[7].
Conversely, despite data from the 2003 SARS outbreak highlighting long-term exercise capacity
reduction even in absence of cardiac or pulmonary abnormalities[8], data on long-term functional
COVID-19 effects in less clinically complex patients are lacking.
Aims of our study were: 1) to evaluate pulmonary, cardiac, and functional capacity of non-severe
COVID-19 survivors by performing cardio-pulmonary exercise testing (CPET); 2) to identify those
baseline and clinical characteristics associated to worse performance at CPET.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Study subjects
We included the first 150 consecutive subjects undergoing post-COVID-19 evaluation at the
Outpatient Cardiac Rehabilitation center of Genoa, Italy. The local healthcare authority (Azienda
Sanitaria Locale, ASL 3 Genovese) set up a structured follow-up program for all patients with a
history of Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection admitted to COVID-19 wards from
1st of March 2020 to date (recruitment is still ongoing).
For the purpose of the study, we included in analysis all non-severe patients, excluding those
requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care.

Study design
At 3 months from hospital discharge, all patients received complete clinical evaluation, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), CPET, pulmonary function test (PFT), and dominant leg
extension (DLE) maximal strength evaluation. All patients signed an informed consent.
Study protocol and informed consent conform to the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by
the Ethics Committee of the Liguria Region (n° 430/2020CER).
All procedures and protocols are described in detail in online-only material.

Analysis
Categorical variables are presented as frequencies and percentages and were compared by chisquare test or Fisher’s exact test. Continuous variables are reported as mean and standard deviation
(SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR) according to their distribution. Normally distributed
variables were compared by means of unpaired Student’s t test. Non-normally distributed variables
were compared with the U Mann-Whitney non-parametric test.
The main outcome measure was percent predicted peak VO2 (%pVO2). Patients were categorized
according to the value of %pVO2 below or above 85%.
Multivariate linear regression model was used to estimate the beta coefficients with 95% confidence
interval (CI) of %pVO2. The model was adjusted for time from hospital discharge to CPET and all
clinically meaningful covariates with p <0.10 in univariate analysis.
All analyses were performed with R environment 3.6.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria) and packages tableone, finalfit, and ggplot2.

RESULTS
Of the first 150 evaluated patients, we excluded 24 (16.0%) who had needed invasive ventilation, 7
(4.7%) for missing data, and 9 (6.0%) as they were unable to perform CPET. The final population
included 110 patients. Table 1 depicts the characteristics of the study patients.
Forty-five (40.9%) patients were female, median age was 61.7 (53.5-69.2) years, median body mass
index (BMI) at CPET evaluation was 26.8 (23.9-30.5) kg/m2, median weight at hospital admission
was 82.0 (70.0-95.0) kg, whereas median weight at CPET evaluation was 77.0 (67.0 89.8) kg with
median percent weight loss of 9.4 (6.0-12.9) %. Forty-five (40.9%) patients were active smokers.

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing
The reason for maximal CPET interruption was exhaustion/leg fatigue for 109 (94.5%), dyspnea for
4 (3.6%), and new arrhythmia for 2 (1.8%). Median %pVO2 was 90.9 (79.2-109.0) %, median RER
1.1 (1.0-1.2). Thirty-eight (34.5%) patients had %pVO2 below, whereas 72 (65.5%) above the 85%
predicted value.
Of the 38 patients with reduced %pVO2, 8 (21.1%) had mainly respiratory limitation of exercise
(RLE, see online-only material for definitions), 9 (23.7%) mainly cardiac limitation of exercise
(CLE), 3 (7.9%) RLE and CLE, and 18 (47.4%) had non-cardiopulmonary limitation of exercise.

Pulmonary function test
At PFT, median forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and
diffusing capacity of lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were within normal limits; however, 2
(1.8%) patients had mild and 2 (1.8%) moderate impairment of FEV1, 1 moderate impairment of
FEV1, 5 (4.5%) mild and 2 (1.8%) impairment of FVC, and 9 (8.2%) mild, 6 (5.5%) moderate and
2 (1.8%) severe DLCO impairment.

3-month clinical evaluation
At 3-month clinical evaluation, 81 (73.6%) patients experienced at least one disabling symptom,
30/38 (78.9%) among those with %pVO2 below and 51/72 (70.8%) among those above 85%
(p>0.05). Of note, 55/110 (50.0%) patients complained of dyspnea, of whom 18/110 (16.4%) were
in NYHA class III/IV, 28/110 (25.5%) had chest pain, 54/110 (49.1%) had fatigue, and 25/110
(22.7%) complained of palpitations. Each symptom frequency did not differ between patients with
%pVO2 below and above 85% predicted value (all p>0.05).

Predictors of percent predicted peak oxygen uptake (VO2)
At multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted for time from hospital discharge to CPET, age
(β=0.46, p=0.020), percent weight loss (β=-0.77, p=0.029), active smoke status (β=-7.07, p=0.019),
length of hospital stay (β=-0.20, p=0.042), and DLE maximal strength (β=1.65, p=0.039) (Figure
1) were independently associated with %pVO2 (Table 2).

DISCUSSION
Our study has the following main findings: 1) 1/3rd of non-severe COVID-19 survivors had a
significant alteration both in exercise capacity and %pVO2 at 3 months after hospital discharge; 2)
in about half of patients with abnormal %pVO2, this was due to abnormal peripheral oxygen
extraction, most likely to some degree of muscle impairment, as DLE maximal strength was
independently associated with peak oxygen consumption; 3) more than 2/3rd (74.3%) of patients
experimented at least one disabling symptom at 3 months after hospital discharge, although there
was no relationship between symptoms and worst %pVO2.
To our knowledge, for the first time we assessed clinical status and exercise capacity of COVID-19
patients performing complete CPET evaluation after hospital discharge.
Regarding the first point, our results are reminiscent of Ong et al., who found a 41% prevalence in
reduced %pVO2 among 44 SARS 3-month survivors[8], albeit they also included 10/44 (22.7%)
patients that had required invasive ventilation. The abnormal %pVO2 was accompanied by an early
anaerobic threshold, translating into a significant impairment in daily activities.
On note, abnormal physical function and performance in COVID-19 survivors have been
preliminarily described by Belli et al.[9] using 1-min sit-to-stand test and Short Physical
performance Battery, without the more objective CPET evaluation.
Due to the ongoing and accelerating COVID-19 worldwide pandemic, these observations raise
important concerns for health systems, as we proved that a substantial number of non-severe
COVID-19 patients still had objective exercise impairment several months after hospital discharge.
As for the second point, it is noteworthy that a cardiopulmonary cause determining the exercise
capacity and %pVO2 reduction could only be found in about half of patients.
Interestingly, DLE maximal strength was independently associated with peak oxygen consumption
suggesting that muscle impairment should be responsible for the residual cases, probably due to bed
rest and subsequently muscular deconditioning, but also with a potential role for corticosteroid
myopathy[10, 11]. Our numbers are again similar to Ong et al. (about 40% had noncardiopulmonary impairment in their post-SARS cohort), although steroids during acute illness was
less frequently used in their sample (15% vs. 100%). The important role of muscular factors is
compounded by the higher weight loss in patients with abnormal %pVO2, probably representing a
reduction in fat and lean mass occurring during the acute phase.
We also highlight the role of hospital stay, that appeared longer among patients with abnormal
%pVO2, probably for both the forced confinement during the acute phase and the need for
aggressive medical care in COVID-19. Regarding this, our data can again only be compared with

Belli et al.[9], which found no association between physical performance and length of hospital
stay, but without measuring objective CPET-derived parameters.
We believe that the most important of our findings is the relationship between %pVO2 and
maximal strength of the lower limb muscles, maintained even after accounting for cardiopulmonary
variables, for length of hospitalization, and for percent weight loss. In our opinion this reduces the
likelihood that bed rest, exercise deprivation and loss of muscle mass alone could cause this degree
of impairment, raising the possibility of a direct effect of SARS-CoV2 at the muscle level. We only
mention the possibility of mitochondrial dysfunction[12], as several ongoing research projects are
exploring its role on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 acute phase[13-15].
As for the third point, we demonstrate that almost 3/4ths of patients experienced at least one
disabling symptom 3 months after hospital discharge, without any relationship with exercise
capacity. Several studies have already investigated the residual symptoms burden of patients
recovering from COVID-19, observing different rates between out-patients (about 35% in Tenforde
et al.)[16] and patients who had needed hospitalization (87% in the study by Carfì et al.)[6]. We
report relatively high rates of disabling symptoms (50% dyspnea, 49.1% fatigue). Halpin et al.
describe a cohort of 68 non-ventilated patients, of whom 41/68 (60%) complained of fatigue and
21/68 (43.6%) of dyspnea. The need for use of oxygen supplementation (80% vs. 70% in Halpin et
al.) was also similar [17].
In conclusion, it has been known for many years that most critically ill patients face long-lasting
functional impairment after discharge[10]; what is mostly worrying about our data is that we found
severe mid-term consequences of COVID-19 in a non-ICU population. This observation supports
the need for targeted management of these patients also during the acute phase (e.g. applying
appropriate nutrition and early mobilization plans). Moreover, as there was no relationship with
%pVO2, symptoms alone should not guide the post-acute management of COVID-19 patients:
more objective techniques, such as CPET, should probably be used to rapidly intercept and assess
the exercise impairment and, perhaps, to decide whether to start a physical rehabilitation program.

Limitations
Our study has important limitations. Firstly, all patients came from an area of the city of Genoa.
Secondly, the functional capacity evaluation was conducted three months after hospital discharge,
with the patients unsupervised in the meantime and no data available about the baseline condition
prior to COVID-19. Moreover, no direct structural evaluation at the muscle level was performed.
