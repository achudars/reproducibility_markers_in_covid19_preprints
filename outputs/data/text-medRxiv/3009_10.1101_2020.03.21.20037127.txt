Abstract
Background: At present, there is a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pneumonia. For COVID-19 patients, cancer is a coexisting disease that should not be
Here, we conducted a multicenter retrospective study to show the clinical information and
outcomes of cancer patients infected with COVID-19. Measurements: Medical records of
COVID-19 patients with cancer admitted to hospitals from Jan 5, 2020 to Feb 18, 2020 were
collected. Results: Of the 67 patients (median age: 66 years), the median age of patients with
severe illness was older than that of patients with mild symptoms (P<0.001). The proportion of
severe patients had co-morbidities was higher than patients with mild disease (P=0.004).
During the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia, tumor progression and recurrence was not
observed for those patients still at the anticancer treatment phase. Lymphocytopenia was the
main laboratory finding accompanying increased C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in
cancer patients, especially in severe cases. By Mar 10, 2020, 18 (26.9%) patients died from
COVID-19. The median age of survivors was younger than that of deaths (P=0.014). Lung
cancer (n=15, 22.4%) was the most common cancer type and accounted for the highest
proportion COVID-19 resulted deaths (33.3%, 5/15). We observed a tendency that patients at
the follow-up phase had a better prognosis than that at anticancer treatment phase (P=0.095).
Conclusion: This study showed COVID-19 patients with cancer seem to have a higher
proportion of severe cases and poorer prognosis. We should pay more intensive attentions to
cancer patients infected with COVID-19.

Introduction
An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has occurred in China and the rest of
world since Dec 2019, which was linked to the severe adult respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2).1-4. According to the situation report from World Health Organization
(WHO), COVID-19 has caused 332930 confirmed cases and 14510 deaths in global by Mar 23,
2020.5 WHO has declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern,
and raised its risk assessment from “high” to “very high”. And the COVID-19 has been
becoming a global pandemic.
Considering that the number of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 is large and still
increasing, cancer is a coexisting disease that should not be neglected. Many patients with
cancer are at the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Previous study including 18 cancer patients
found that patients with cancer had a higher risk of COVID-19 and deteriorated more rapidly
than individuals without cancer in 1099 cases.6,7 There were 107 patients with malignancy
among a total of 72314 patient records diagnosed as of February 11, 2020.8 However, we still
could not fully understand the clinical characteristics of cancer patients with COVID-19 from
the above-mentioned study due to limited sample size. Here, we conducted a multicenter
retrospective study to show the clinical information and outcomes of 67 cancer patients
infected with COVID-19 in 1548 cases from four designated COVID-19 hospitals.

Methods
Study design and participants
For this multicenter, retrospective, observational study, we identified 67 cancer patients with
COVID-19 from 1548 inpatients in four designated hospitals (Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan
University, the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan, the Seventh Hospital of Wuhan, and Wuhan Hankou
Hospital). Patients were admitted to hospital from Jan 5, 2020 to Feb 18, 2020. This study was
approved by the ethics commissions of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, with a
waiver of informed consent due to a public health outbreak investigation.

Definitions
COVID-19 were diagnosed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay
for SARS-CoV-2 according to recommended protocol.9 A small number of cases were
described as clinically confirmed cases based on Diagnosis and Treatment Program of 2019

New Coronavirus Pneumonia (v5.0 Feb 8, 2020) by National Health and Health Commission
of China.10 We also categorized the patients according to the disease severity. A mild case was
defined as a confirmed case with common symptoms and mild radiographic evidence of
pneumonia, while a severe case with dyspnea or respiratory failure. All cancer patients were
divided into follow-up group and ongoing treatment group. Follow-up group was defined as
routinely radical treatments were finished more than one month, and ongoing treatment group
was defined as anticancer therapy is required, not finished or finished in one month.

Data collection
Detailed information of medical records, including epidemiological, demographics, exposure
history, smoking history, chronic medical illness, signs and symptoms on admission,
comorbidity, chest radiography and CT findings, laboratory findings and treatment measures
were collected in this study. Clinical outcomes were followed up to Mar 10, 2020. All data was
checked by two researchers.

Statistical analysis
We compared the characteristics between severe and mild cases, survivors and non-survivors.
Continuous variables were described using mean (standard deviation, SD) if they are normally
distributed, median (range) if they are not. We expressed descriptive data as count (%) for
categorical variables. All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS statistics
(version 23.0 for Windows). Two-sided P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Results
Clinical characteristics of cancer patients with COVID-19 pneumonia
By Feb 18, 2020, we identified 67 cancer patients with COVID-19 from four designated
hospital (Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, the Fifth Hospital of Wuhan, the Seventh
Hospital of Wuhan, Wuhan Hankou Hospital). Among them, 58 (86.6%) patients had a
positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for
SARS-CoV-2, and 9 (13.4%) patients were clinical diagnosed cases. 94.0% (64/67) of patients
had radiological changes on chest CT scan. Hospital-acquired infection occurred in 9 (13.4%)

patients. Detailed clinical information about these patients was summarised in Supplementary
file 1.
Clinical characteristics of the 67 COVID-19 cases are summarised in Table 1. Of the 67
cancer patients involved in our study, 41 (61.2%) patients were male. The median age of
patients was 66 years old (range: 37-90). In terms of disease severity, 35 (52.2%) patients had a
mild illness, while 32 (47.8%) patients had a severe illness. The median age of patients who
had severe illness was older than that of patients who had mild symptoms (69 vs. 64 years,
P<0.001). Additionally, we observed that a higher proportion of severe patients had
co-morbidities compared to patients with mild disease (71.9% [severe] vs 37.1% [mild],
P=0.004). Of note, three of the severe cases had concurrent chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), and these individuals did not survive from the COVID-19 pneumonia. Nine
(13.4%) patients have a smoking history. Forty-three (64.2%) patients had other concurrent
chronic diseases, of which hypertension (53.7%, n=36), diabetes (19.4%, n=13), and coronary
heart disease (11.9%, n=8) were the most common. In addition, 23 (23/36, 66.7%) patients
with concurrent hypertension were severe, accounting for 71.9% (23/32) of all the severe
patients in our cohort.

Association of cancer diagnosis with COVID-19 pneumonia
Among the cancer diagnosed cancers, lung cancer (n=15, 22.4%) was the most common cancer
type. Forty-four (65.7%) patients were cancer survivors on routine follow-up after radical
treatment. Twenty-three (34.3%) patient had received anticancer treatment recently (Table 1).
Only two patients were still ongoing anticancer treatment after the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Among those 23 patients, 9 cases were receiving chemotherapy-based comprehensive
therapies, 7 cases were during perioperative period, 3 cases were receiving supportive
treatment, 2 cases were receiving radiotherapy combined with targeted therapy or with
endocrinotherapy, and the rest 2 patients were receiving endocrinotherapy or immunotherapy.
During the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia, no tumor progression or recurrence was
observed in all the patients.

Clinical progression and treatment
About 70% of these patients had fever (n=53, 79.1%) and cough (n=50, 74.6%) (Table 2).
More than half of them had shortness of breath (n=44, 65.7%). Other clinical symptoms
included fatigue (n=30, 44.8%), sputum production (n=30, 44.8%), dyspnea (n=22, 32.8%),
diarrhea (n=11, 16.4%), nausea and vomiting (n=10, 14.9%), myalgia (n=6, 9.0%) and

hemoptysis (n=3, 4.5%). Severe patients and non-survivors had a higher proportion of dyspnea
at admission (mild vs. severe, 11.4% vs. 56.3%; survivors vs. non-survivors, 20.4% vs. 66.7%,
P<0.05). The other baseline symptoms were similar between mild and severe cases in general.
According to the results of computed tomography (CT) scan, 27 (42.2%) patients had severe
baseline CT manifestations. Table 3 showed the baseline blood test results. Similar to general
infected patients, lymphocytopenia was the main laboratory finding accompanied by increased
C-reactive protein and procalcitonin in cancer patients, especially in severe cases. In addition,
we observed decreased platelets and increased blood urea nitrogen and lactate dehydrogenase
in severe patients/non-survivors.
The landscape of treatment was displayed in Table 2. Fifty-seven (85.1%) patients received
antiviral treatment. Thirty (44.8%) patients were also treated with glucocorticoids, and 14
(20.9%) patients treated with intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. More than 70% (n=49,
73.1%) of patients received oxygen therapy. Twenty (29.9%) patients used non-invasive
ventilator mechanical ventilation and 8 (11.9%) patients used an invasive ventilator to assist
ventilation.

Outcomes of cancer COVID-19 patients
By Mar 10, 2020, 14 (20.9%) patients had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS). The other common serious complication was heart failure (n=11, 16.4%). Two (3.0%)
patients presented with acute renal injury. In our cohort, 18 (26.9%) patients died from
COVID-19, and 39 (58.2%) patients have been discharged. The remaining 10 (14.9%) patients
were still in hospital for treatment. The case-fatality rate (CRF) in this study for overall patients,
patients at anticancer treatment phase, and at the follow-up phase is 26.9% (18/67), 39.1%
(9/23) and 20.5% (9/44), respectively. We observed a tendency that patients at the follow-up
phase might have a better prognosis than under treatment, but there was statistically
significance (Figure 1, P=0.095). The median time from onset to severe events for severe
cases was 10 (range: 1-21) days. The median durations from onset to recovery and death were
31 (range: 8-53) and 20 (range: 6-45) days, respectively. The median age of survivors was
younger than that of deaths (65 [37-83] vs 69.5 [52-98], P=0.014).

Comparison of different cancer types
To clearly compare clinical characteristics of lung cancer with other cancers, distributions of
cancers for different treatment phases, disease severity, age group and disease phase were

of patients in follow-up (Figure 2A). Digestive system cancer patients ranked the highest
proportion of severe condition (Figure 2B). Proportions of lung (12/15, 80%) and digestive
system cancers (14/17, 82.4%) with age ≥ 65 were higher than of other cancers (Figure 2C).
Up to the follow-up deadline, the CFR of COVID-19 patients with lung cancer (5/15, 33.3%)
was higher than that of digestive system cancers (5/17, 29.4%) and other cancers (22.9%)
(Figure 2D). Of note, all deaths (5 cases) in patients with lung cancer were at under treatment
phase.

Discussion
In this multicenter retrospective study, we reported the largest cohort of cancer patients with
COVID-19 to our knowledge. Up to Mar 10, 18 (26.9%) patients died from COVID-19, 39
(58.2%) patients have been discharged, and 10 (14.9%) patients were still in hospital for
treatment in our cohort. Perhaps most notably, we found that about half of the cancer patients
with COVID-19 developed severe illness, which is higher than the proportion in general
population (15.6%, 245/1572 in Guan et.al,11 Supplementary Table S1). According to a
nationwide study based on data regarding 1099 patients with COVID-19 in China, about 3.4%
of COVID-19 patients develop ARDS,7 while the incidence rate of ARDS in our cancer cohort
was 16.42%. The CFR rate of cancer patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 was higher than that of
the overall population. According to the situation report from the WHO, 153517 cases of
COVID-19 had been confirmed all around the world up to Mar 15, 2020, with a CFR rate of
approximately 3.7%.5 In contrast, the crude CFR in our cohort was about 26.9%. Our findings
provided evidence that cancer patients with COVID-19 could have a poorer outcome, which
was consistent with the previous study.6
In this study, the CFR of patients receiving ongoing anticancer treatment recently (39.1%,
9/23) was higher than those who were merely on follow-up post-cancer treatment in the routine
follow-up phase after radical treatment (20.5%, 9/44). Furthermore, we observed a tendency
that patients at the follow-up phase may have a better prognosis than those under treatment
(Figure 1, P=0.095). Those results provide further evidence to demonstrate that patients
receiving ongoing anticancer treatment recently have a poorer prognosis than those patients at
follow-up phase. It may a result of immune compromising effect led by anticancer
treatments.12-14 Noteworthy, this study showed that lung cancer was the most common cancer
type (accounted for 22.4%), which may have higher susceptibility SARS-CoV-2 infection than
other type cancers. There may be two main reasons: (1) lung cancer accounts for a large

proportion of all cancers; (2) 10 cases lung cancer patients were ongoing anticancer treatment,
and they may have high risks of nosocomial infection and low immunity to SARS-CoV viral
particles. Meanwhile, all 5 deaths with lung cancer is at anticancer treatment phase. This
indicates that patients with lung cancer at anticancer treatment phase might have poor
prognosis. The proportion of severe cases among different kinds of cancer types ranged from
25.0% to 64.7%, of which digestive system cancer patients ranked the highest. However, it is
still unclear whether there are any differences in the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection among
other types of cancer. More data is needed to further verify our findings.
As reported in previous studies,4,15,16 male and older patients had a higher risk of
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was validated in our cancer cohort. Patients in our cancer
cohort were older overall than patients in previous reports.4,15,16 It may because those patients
have accompanying cancer. In addition, we found that severe patients tended to be older than
patients with mild illness, which indicated that older patients were at an increased risk of being
critically ill. Patients who had other chronic illnesses were also at a higher risk of being severe
according to previous studies.4,15,17 In our cohort, we also observed that a higher proportion of
severe patients had co-morbidities compared to patients with mild disease (P=0.004).
Particularly, about 70% of patients with concurrent hypertension were severe, accounting for
the majority of the severe patients in our study. Recent studies suggested that
angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) could be the host receptor for SARS-CoV-2 with
high binding affinity.18,19 Besides, the expression of ACE2 in tumor tissues could be higher
than adjacent tissues and there is expression heterogeneity across different cancer types.20
In the clinical courses of cancer patients with COVID-19, lymphocytopenia was observed,
especially in severe patients/non-survivors, which might result from targeted damages by
SARS-CoV viral particles (21). Our findings were consistent with previous studies on
COVID-19,4,15 indicating that lymphocytopenia reflects the severity of COVID-19 in a way.
As for treatment, antiviral regimens were used in most patients in our study. To our knowledge,
there was no specific remedy for COVID-19 yet.7,22 Therefore, supportive treatment has been
adopted as the mainstay of therapy. In our cohort, about 73.1% of cancer patients with
COVID-19 received oxygen therapy. About 40% of the patients received mechanical
ventilation.
Hospital-acquired transmission accounted for 13.4% of our cancer patients. This data was
consistent with the previous report of 138 hospitalized patients from one of our center, in which
12.3% of in-hospital patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2 through hospital-acquired
transmission.17 It indicated that hospital-acquired transmission was also an important way of

infection in cancer patients. In addition, cancer patients are at a higher risk of COVID-19, even
if they have completed the anticancer treatment. More than 60% (65.6%) of cancer patients in
our study were at the follow-up phase after radical anticancer treatment. For regular anticancer
treatment and follow up, cancer patients need to visit hospital frequently, which increases the
risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection. Besides, cancer patients with COVID-19 might
have more complications due to their old age, weakened immune system and the side effects of
undergoing treatments.12,14 Therefore, we recommend systemic screening should be conducted
among hospitalized cancer patients. In our study, we also observed that ongoing anticancer
treatment was interrupted in most patients because of the diagnosis of COVID-19. Fortunately,
we had not observed tumor progression during the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. On one
hand, appropriately delaying treatment and reductive frequency of visit hospital for cancer
patients is feasible. On the other hand, medical oncologists are recommended to provide
professional consultation for COVID-19 cancer patients to ensure essential anticancer
treatments.
This study has several limitations. First, this is a retrospective study with only 67 cases from
four hospitals. Although it is the largest cancer patient cohort of COVID-19 up to now. The
results may not be representative of the entire cancer patient population and should be
interpreted with caution. Second, some specific clinical information was insufficient and
whether COVID-19 had further influence on the therapy and prognosis for cancer patients was
not analysed in this study. Therefore, an extended follow-up should be recommended for these
patients. In the future, a larger COVID-19 cancer patient cohort from multicenter is needed to
explore more detail information of cancer patients.

Conclusion
In this study, we reported the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in cancer
patients. Both patients within the follow-up phase and ongoing anticancer treatment phase
were at the risk of COVID-19. This study showed COVID-19 patients with cancer seem to
have a higher proportion of severe cases and poorer prognosis. The tendency of poor prognosis
was more obvious in patients at anticancer treatment phase. We should pay more intensive
attention to cancer patients, especially those with common risk factors of COVID-19.
