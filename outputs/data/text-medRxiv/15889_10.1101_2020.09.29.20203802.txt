ABSTRACT
Background/Aims: We reviewed demographic and clinical profiles, along with measures
of hospital-based clinical practice to identify temporal changes in clinical practice that may have
affected in-hospital outcomes of patients with COVID-19.
Methods: Data consisted of sociodemographic and clinical data captured in University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) electronic medical record (EMR) systems, linked by
common variables (deidentified). The analysis population included hospitalized patients (across
21 hospitals) with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19 infection during the period March 14August 31, 2020. The primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital mechanical
ventilation/mortality. We compared temporal trends in patient characteristics, clinical practice,
and hospital outcomes using 4 time-defined epochs for calendar year 2020: March 14-March 31
(epoch 1); April 1-May 15, (epoch 2), May 16-June 28 (epoch 3); and June 29-August 31 (epoch
4). We report unadjusted survival estimates, followed by propensity score analyses to adjust for
differences in patient characteristics, to compare in-hospital outcomes of epoch 4 patients
(recently treated) to epoch 1-3 patients (earlier treated).
Results: Mean number of hospital admissions was 9.9 per day during epoch 4, which was
~2- to 3-fold higher than the earlier epochs. Presenting characteristics of the 1,076 COVID-19
hospitalized patients were similar across the 4 epochs, including mean age. The crude rate of
mechanical ventilation/mortality was lower in epoch 4 patients (17%) than in epoch 1-3 patients
(23% to 35%). When censoring for incomplete patient follow-up, the rate of mechanical
ventilation/mortality was lower in epoch 4 patients (p<0.0001), as was the individual component
of mechanical ventilation (p=0.0002) and mortality (p=0.02). In propensity score adjusted
analyses, the in-hospital relative risk (RR) of mechanical ventilation/mortality was lower in

epoch 4 patients (RR=0.67, 95% CI: 0.48, 0.93). For the outcome being discharged alive within
3, 5, or 7 days of admission, adjusted odds ranged from 1.6- to 1.7-fold higher among epoch 4
patients compared to earlier treated patients. The better outcomes in epoch 4 patients were
principally observed in patients under the age of 75 years. Patient level dexamethasone use was
55.6% in epoch 4 compared to 15% or less of patients in the earlier epochs. Most patients across
epochs received anticoagulation drugs (principally heparin). Overall steroid (81.7% vs. 54.3%,
p<0.0001) and anticoagulation use (90.4% vs. 80.7%, p=0.0001) was more frequent on the day
or day after hospitalization in epoch 4 patients compared to earlier treated patients.
Conclusions: In our large system, recently treated hospitalized COVID-19 patients had
lower rates of in-hospital mechanical ventilation/mortality and shorter length of hospital stay.
Alongside of this was a change to early initiation of glucocorticoid therapy and anticoagulation.
The extent to which the improvement in patient outcomes was related to changes in clinical
practice remains to be established.

INTRODUCTION
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the US and countries worldwide have seen
variation in reported incidence, testing patterns, case fatality rates, investigations of novel
treatments, and clinical practice approaches. A few,1-3 but not all,4 recent non-peer reviewed
reports suggested that the case fatality rate of COVID-19 infection is decreasing, and care is
changing. However, there is an absence of published reports on large series of hospitalized
COVID-19 patients, particularly with respect to temporal changes in clinical outcomes within the
same data system.
One key intervention is mechanical ventilation, initially thought to be best started early
with more severe COVID-19 respiratory finding, notably hypoxemia. Over time, informal
reports note less mechanical ventilation use; potential explanations for lower rates of COVID-19
mechanical ventilation and less mortality include: (i) changing demographics of patients;5 (ii)
more judicious use of starting and using mechanical ventilation;6 (iii) more frequent use of
anticoagulants;7,8 and steroids;9-12 (iv) changing prominent disease manifestations of patients;13
(v) seasonal effects of temperature and humidity variation;14 and (vi) potential changes in viral
infectivity or pathogenicity.15,16
There have been temporal changes in COVID-19 testing in addition to no national testing
strategy. Early in the pandemic, only those with symptoms and a higher pretest probability of
COVID-19 exposure or disease were the focus of testing. Soon thereafter, COVID-19 testing
increased in many, notably populations with higher frequency of potential infection (e.g., nursing
home patients as well as health care professionals), and more recently increased screening of
asymptomatic patients such as those with return to college campus activities, along with more

carrying SARS CoV2 virus.17-20
We sought to examine clinical outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a large
health care system accompanied by an assessment of demographic and clinical profiles, along
with changes in hospital-based clinical practice, that have occurred since the onset of the
COVID-19 pandemic in the US.

METHODS
Sources of Data. We used data routinely captured in the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center (UPMC) electronic medical record (EMR) systems. In brief, UPMC is a large
academic medical center and insurer, housed principally in Pennsylvania.21 The UPMC data
system has detailed sociodemographic and medical history data, diagnostic and clinical tests
conducted, surgical and other treatment procedures performed, prescriptions ordered, and billing
charges on all outpatient and in-hospital encounters, with diagnoses and procedures coded based
on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth revisions (ICD-9 and ICD-10,
respectively).
We linked the primary data sources using common variables (deidentified) within the
UPMC data ecosystem aggregated in its Clinical Data Warehouse (CDW) that include: (i)
Medipac, the admit, discharge and transfer registration and hospital-based billing system; (ii)
Cerner, the inpatient electronic medical record (EMR) for relevant clinical information for
bedded patients at a UPMC inpatient hospital; (iii) Epic, the UPMC EMR for ambulatory office
visits owned by UPMC (Community Medicine Inc. and (University of Pittsburgh Physicians);
and (iv) Aria, the EMR utilized in most ambulatory Cancer Centers at UPMC for both radiation

oncology and medical oncology. In calendar year 2019 among discharged UPMC hospital
patients, there were 306,456 visits among 201,829 unique patients, with mean (median) age of 54
(60) years, 54% female, and median length of stay of 2.6 days.
Patient Population. We studied 139,465 patients with nucleic acid amplification tests for
SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19) during the period March 14, 2020 to August 31, 2020.
Of these, the study population consisted of 1,076 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and
were hospitalized at one of 21 UPMC hospitals (see Supplemental Table S1 for listing of
hospitals). Our study received formal ethics approval by the UPMC Ethics and Quality
Improvement Review Committee (Project ID 2882), the ethics/oversight body for ensuring
patient confidentiality and consent (including waiver of consent) for analysis and dissemination
of deidentified data within the UPMC system.
Primary and Secondary Outcomes. The primary outcome for this analysis was a
composite of in-hospital mechanical ventilation or mortality. We assessed in-hospital mechanical
by the presence of a charge of mechanical ventilation within the Medipac billing software,
specifically codes 94002 (first day of mechanical ventilation) and 94003 (each subsequent day of
mechanical ventilation). Because some facilities used intensive care units for the care of COVID19 patients regardless of illness acuity, we did not use intensive care unit admission as an
outcome. We assessed in-hospital mortality by the discharge disposition of “Ceased to Breathe”
sourced from the inpatient Medical Record System.
Secondary outcomes included in-hospital mechanical ventilation or mortality individually
and length of hospital stay (calculated by taking the difference between a discharge date time and
the admission date time) available through billing within the Medipac system. Study

investigators remained unaware of ascertainment of mechanical ventilation and mortality within
the UPMC system during data collection and analysis.
Explanatory Variables. For assessment of temporal changes and prior to analyses, we
categorized the study analysis period into discrete epochs based on observed empirical changes
in testing patterns in the UPMC system. We chose a 4-time period classification scheme (see
Figure 1), (Epoch 1: March 14-March 31, 2020; Epoch 2: April 1-May 15, 2020; Epoch 3: May
16-June 28, 2020; Epoch 4: June 29-August 31, 2020), and then collapsed the 4 epochs into 2
epochs to depict earlier (Epochs 1,2,3) versus recently admitted hospital patients (Epoch 4). For
assessment of variation between epochs, we considered demographic variables, clinical history
and medical comorbidities, laboratory values, vital signs, and medication use, with a focus on
indicators of changing clinical practice such as use and timing of specific medications. As above,
investigators were unaware of initial documentation of the explanatory variables in the EMRs.
Statistical Methods. We compared characteristics of patients across the 4 epochs using
analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical
variables. We used the same methods to compare patterns of use of drugs and unadjusted inhospital outcomes by epoch group, while using non-parametric Wilcoxon tests used for variables
with skewed distributions, in particular, days from hospital admission to initiation of specific
drugs or oxygen therapies. We defined 3 binary “shorter” hospital length of stay variables for
patients discharged alive as <3, <5, and <7 days, and included only patients admitted with
adequate time to meet these definitions. We used chi-square tests to compare proportions by
epochs. Then, we used Kaplan-Meier survival curves to present the outcomes in-hospital
mechanical ventilation/mortality and each individual component, comparing epoch 4 (recent)
versus epoch 1-3 (earlier) patients by use of the log-rank test.

We used propensity score methodology to compare in-hospital outcomes between epoch
4 versus epoch 1-3, adjusting for differences in presenting characteristics,.22,23 Logistic
regression models were fit using hospital admission during epoch 4 as the dependent variable
with stepwise selection (at p < 0.2) of measured pre-treatment explanatory variables. Resulting
propensity scores (i.e. predicted probability of being in epoch 4 versus epochs 1-3) were the
output and used as a continuous variable to control for confounding in Cox proportional hazards
regression and logistic regression models of in-hospital outcomes. In sensitivity analyses, models
were replicated with the use of inverse probability weighting (IPW), as well as 1:1 propensity
score matching (PSM) with a maximum propensity score probability difference of 0.01. We set
the comparison alpha error at 0.05 without correction for multiple comparisons.
In stratified analyses, we examined potential effect modification by patient age using 3
groups defined as: (i) less than 60 years of age; (ii) 60 to less than 75 years of age; and (iii) 75
years of age and older. We did not impute missing values in any of the analyses. Methods and
results are reported in accordance with The REporting of studies Conducted using Observational
Routinely-collected health Data (RECORD) statement24 (see Supplemental Table 2).

RESULTS
The mean number of hospital admissions was 9.9 per day during epoch 4, which was 2to 3-fold higher than average daily admission during the earlier epochs (see Supplementary
Figure S1). The overall rate of COVID-19 testing performed in epoch 4 also was higher (Figure
1).
Presenting characteristics of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are listed in Table 1.
The mean patient age was similar across the 4 epochs (ranging from 63.0 to 65.2 years), as was

representation by sex and race. In the earliest epoch (1) and most current epoch (4), the
proportion of patients covered by UPMC health insurance was higher. Otherwise, the majority of
patient characteristics were similar across the four epochs. Exceptions included a higher
prevalence of COPD in epoch 2 and 4 patients, and nominally different mean hemoglobin
laboratory values. Recent outpatient medication use at the time of hospital admission was similar
across the 4 epochs.
Prescribing Patterns for Inpatients. Reported timing and use of medications showed
changing patterns across the 4 epochs (Table 2). Specifically, the use of remdesivir peaked in
epoch 3 at 31.3% and then declined to 17.8% in epoch 4. There was an increase in the use of
dexamethasone to 55.6% of patients in epoch 4 compared to 15% or less of patients in the earlier
epochs. The majority of patients received anticoagulation drugs, principally heparin, and use was
highest in epoch 2 and 4 patients. There was a striking difference in the timing of drug initiation,
with much earlier use of dexamethasone, glucocorticoids as a class, and anticoagulation in epoch
4 patients. As depicted in Figure 2, a higher percentage of patients in epoch 4 had initiation of
steroids (p<0.0001) or anticoagulation (p=0.0001) on the same day (Day 0) or following day
(Day 1) after hospital admission compared to patients admitted in epochs 1-3.
Use of Oxygen Support and In-Hospital Outcomes. More than half of all patients
received oxygen therapy during their hospital stay, with the highest percentage (73%) observed
in epoch 2 patients (Table 3). Oxygen therapy started sooner in epoch 4 patients (mean of 1.9
days), and initiation of drug aerosol therapy was also sooner in epoch 4 patients (mean of 4.0
days) compared to epoch 1-3 patients (mean of 5.6 to 9.2 days). By contrast, the timing of the
start of mechanical ventilation after hospital admission was longest in epoch 4 patients (mean of
3.6 days) compared to epoch 1-3 patients (mean of 1.9 to 2.3 days). Individually, the crude rate

of use of mechanical ventilation was lower in epoch 4 patients (11.7%) than in epoch 1-3
patients (17% to 22%) as was in-hospital mortality (10.2% vs. 14.5% to 23.6%), recognizing that
not all epoch 4 patients had been discharged. For the primary outcome, the crude rate of
mechanical ventilation/mortality was lower in epoch 4 patients (17%) than in epoch 1-3 patients
(23% to 35%). When censoring for incomplete patient follow-up (i.e. patients admitted yet not
yet discharged), rates of mechanical ventilation (p=0.0002), mortality (p=0.02), and mechanical
ventilation/mortality (p<0.0001) were lower in epoch 4 patients compared to epoch 1-3 patients
(Supplemental Figures 2a, 2b, 2c, respectively). Rates of being discharged alive within 3, 5,
and 7 days of admission were significantly higher in epoch 4 patients compared to epoch 1-3
patients (Table 3).
Relative Risks of In-Hospital Outcomes. In propensity score adjusted Cox regression
models, the estimated in-hospital relative risks (RR: expressed as hazard ratios) of the composite
outcome mechanical ventilation/mortality (RR=0.67, 95% CI: 0.48, 0.93), use of mechanical
ventilation (RR=0.64, 95% CI: 0.42, 0.96), and mortality, (RR=0.81, 95% CI: 0.53, 1.23) were
lower in epoch 4 patients compared to epoch 1-3 patients (Table 4). In propensity adjusted
logistic regression models, RRs (expressed as odds ratios) of being discharged alive within 3, 5,
or 7 days of admission were higher in epoch 4 patients compared to epoch 1-3 patients, ranging
from an estimated 1.6- to 1.7-fold higher odds of shorter length of stay in epoch 4 patients
(Table 4).
In sensitivity analyses using 1:1 propensity matched group patients (epoch 4 vs. epochs
1-3), presenting patient characteristics were similar (see Supplemental Table S3), and Cox and
logistic regression estimates favoring better in-hospital outcomes in epoch 4 patients were
similar (see Supplementary Table S4). Outcome results using propensity inverse probability

weighting Supplementary Table S4) were similar. A comparison of outcome results across all
methods of analysis is depicted in Supplemental Figure 2, which shows similar results across
all methods.
Relative Risks of In-Hospital Outcomes by Age. As seen in Table 5, the in-hospital
outcome changes observed in epoch 4 versus epoch 1-3 patients varied by age. Specifically, in
the age groups of less than 60 years of age or 60 to 74 years of age, the adjusted risk of inhospital mechanical ventilation/mortality was approximately 50% lower in epoch 4 patients
compared to epoch 1-3 patients. In contrast, the adjusted risk of in-hospital mechanical
ventilation/mortality among patients 75 years of age and older was similar between epoch 4
versus epoch 1-3 patients.
Among patients less than 60 years of age, the adjusted odds of having a hospital stay of
<3 days (discharged alive) were approximately 1.8 fold higher in epoch 4 patients, and were
even larger for a hospital stay of <5 days (about 2.1-fold higher) or <7 days (about 2.6-fold
higher). Patients age 60 to less than 75 years also tended to have a shorter length of stay in epoch
4, whereas there were no differences by epoch in lengh of for patients aged 75 and older.

DISCUSSION
Among COVID-19 patients hospitalized starting in March of 2020, our analyses show
recent (epoch 4: June 19th to August 31st, 2020) decreases in rates of mechanical ventilation,
mortality, and hospital length of stay, compared with earlier time periods. These results were
observed principally in hospitalized patients under the age of 75, and are consistent with some,13,39-42

not appear to be attributable to differences in baseline characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19
patients, which were minimal and controlled for statistically with multiple analytic approaches.
In our large, representative health care system, we observed marked temporal changes in
clinical management of patients, The most notable changes in clinical management of patients in
the most recent interval was s higher use of dexamethasone (and glucocorticoids overall), higher
use of anticoagulants, earlier initiation of dexamethasone, glucocorticoids as a class, and use of
anticoagulants. The observed treatment strategy of earlier and significantly more frequent use of
dexamethasone in patients in the UPMC system likely was triggered by the July 2020 release of
the RECOVERY trial,9 which showed lower 28-day mortality in patients who were receiving
oxygen with or without invasive mechanical ventilation, and who received dexamethasone as
compared to placebo. Our observed practice pattern of more frequent use of steroids is also
consistent with a recently published (September 2, 2020) meta-analysis of six trials involving
random assignment of different steroids (dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone)
compared to placebo, and approximately 30% lower risk of 28-day mortality among patients
treated with steroids.25
Effect of Treatment Changes in Clinical Practice. An obvious question that arises
from the present analysis is to what extent did the recent changes in clinical practice (e.g. greater
use and earlier initiation of steroids and anticoagulants) lead to overall lower rates of mechanical
ventilation and hospital mortality, as well shorter length of hospital stay? Unfortunately, this type
of question is difficult to answer with an observational dataset. Specifically, in non-randomized
settings, there is potential confounding by indication (indication bias) when comparing different
treatment approaches. It is nearly impossible to determine whether a given treatment approach
was initiated a priori, as opposed to preferentially in response to patient disease severity and/or

hospital course, thereby rendering comparisons of such treated patients to those who did not
receive the treatment as potentially biased.26,27 As recently articulated, we believe caution is wise
and causality uncertain though possible with these observational data.28 Our data provide a
rationale for potential conduct of new RCTs, particularly pragmatic and adaptive types29 of trials
that can quickly study questions, such as the timing in which steroids and anticoagulants are
administered among COVID-19 hospitalized patients.
Variation in Outcomes by Age. The present analysis indicated that the better in-hospital
outcomes observed in recent hospitalized COVID-19 patients (epoch 4) were principally evident
in patients under the age of 75, and largely not evident among those 75 years of age and older.
Multiple potential explanations exist for these apparent differential results. First may be the
clinical decision for potential use of mechanical ventilation. A report of 5,700 COVID-19
patients admitted to 12 hospitals in New York showed high rates of mortality for mechanically
ventilated patients over the age of 65.30 These findings comport with indications that some
physicians may be reluctant to initiate mechanical ventilation in elderly patients as compared to
younger patients who typically present with fewer comorbidities, (e.g.31) potential medical ethics
arguments made for rationing use of ventilators by age,32,33 and from the patient perspective,
possibility that some elderly patients (coupled with family member input) may be particularly
likely to expressly state orders against the use of mechanical ventilation. (e.g.34-36) These types of
competing influences may blur assessment of the true clinical risk of mechanical ventilation in
elderly COVID-19 hospitalized patients. With respect to less indication in our dataset of a
mortality reduction in recently treated elderly COVID-19 patients, these findings may represent
the greater challenge and complexity in treating elderly hospitalized COVID-19 patients who
may be frail and have extensive comorbidities. This is consistent with reports of age being an

independent risk factor for COVID-19 mortality37 as well as for higher levels of inflammatory
dysfunction markers and weakened immune response38.
Strengths and Limitations. Strengths of this study include analysis of a large,
heterogenous patient population (e.g. enhances generalizability), standardized collection of realworld data and algorithmic coding of variables harmonized in a clinical data warehouse collected
for non-research purposes (e.g. reduces potential reporting and ascertainment bias), and access to
a very large battery of sociodemographic, medical history, medication use, and clinical practice
and outcome variables available for analysis. A limitation is that we extracted all variables from
the EHR of a multisite health care system, making fidelity concerns persist. All current data are
observational and cannot determine causality. We also did not collect data to inform changes in
host biology or viral pathogenesis over time, and we did not attempt to assess other external
factors, such as seasonal effects of temperature and humidity variation, and possible patientspecific directives against the use of mechanical ventilation. Lastly, the present analysis includes
a small percentage of hospitalized patients (<13%) enrolled in clinical trials, including potential
randomization to either hydroxychloroquine, steroids, immunomodulators, convalescent plasma,
or placebo. While a potential impact, we think that effect is modest if at all present.
Conclusions. Recently treated hospitalized COVID-19 patients in our large health care
system have overall lower rates of mechanical ventilation/in-hospital mortality and shorter length
of hospital stay compared to earlier intervals. The extent to which these improved patient
outcomes are related to recent changing clinical practice (i.e. greater and earlier use of steroids
and anticoagulants) is unknown but an opportunity for rigorous future controlled trials.

Supplemental Figure 3.
Plot of relative risks (RR) of in-hospital outcomes comparing epoch 4 patients to epoch 1-3
patients. The filled symbols represent the RR estimate; the lower and upper end of the vertical
lines represent the lower and upper limits of the 95% confidence interval. Symbol interpretation
is as follows: rectangle (unadjusted estimate); diamond (propensity score adjustment as a
continuous variable); triangle (propensity score with inverse probability weighting (IPW)); circle
(1:1 matched propensity score). Composite: in-hospital mechanical ventilation/mortality, LOS3:
length of stay <3 days; LOS5: length of stay <5 days; LOS7: length of stay <7 days.

*For all days from admission variables, comparisons by epoch were made by non-parametric Wilcoxon continuity-corrected 2-sample tests
comparing epochs 1-3 to epoch 4. **Some patients in epoch 4 (June 29-August 31) have yet to be discharged, hence, crude outcomes rates should
be cautiously interpreted. BIPAP: Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure. CPAP: Continuous positive airway pressure. LOS: length of stay.

*For in-hospital ventilation and mortality, relative risk (RR) estimates are presented as hazard ratios. For
length of stay (LOS), RR estimates are presented as odds ratios. **For length of stay, sample sizes ranged
from 977 to 986 for the all patients in undajusted analyses, and from 618 to 626 for the adjusted analysis
among patients with covariate data. The adjusted estimates are based on use of the propensity score as a
continuous variable.
