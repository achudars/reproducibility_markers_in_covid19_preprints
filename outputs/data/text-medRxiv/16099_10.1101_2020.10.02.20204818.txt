Abstract

We built a mathematical model for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and analyze it using
both a deterministic and a stochastic approach. We used this model to project the
burden of the disease in refugee camps characterized by peculiar demographic characteristics and a high level of deprivation, including lack of medical facilities and
personnel, as well as limited possibility to implement containment and quarantine
measures. Most of the parameters in our model were adapted from published literature but we used our own estimates of the basic reproduction number, R0 as well as
the lethality by age group and gender. We projected the burden in terms of number
of infections, number of deaths and number of bed-days in hospitalization and intensive care, among others. We conclude that the harsh conditions of refugee camps
combined with a high share of young people leads to a relatively mild scenario for
the burden of the disease.

Executive summary

Objective. The report illustrates the results of a series of simulations of the spread
of COVID-19 disease in refugee camps using a demo set of data from the Za’atari
refugee camp in Jordan. The purpose of this exercise is to illustrate the type of
information that can assist the UNHCR and camps’ administrators in preparing for
a COVID-19 outbreak.
Model. Simulations are conducted with a compartmental model that we call
“SIZ”. This is a newly developed epidemiological model with eight compartments
designed specifically to model COVID-19 outbreaks in closed and highly densely
populated communities such as refugee camps. The model segregates those infected
into symptomatic and asymptomatic categories and provides simulations using both
deterministic and stochastic solutions. Whereas deterministic models are based on
transition rates between compartments, stochastic models are based on transition
probabilities between them. The main difference is that in a deterministic model an
individual ‘splits’ among communicating stages, whereas in a stochastic model the
individual moves to only one of those stages. Also, transitions from the current state
X(t0 ) to the state X(t0 + t) are random, as well as the time for the transition, t. This
allows for the estimation of standard deviations and confidence intervals. Solutions
to the models have been programmed in Matlab, Python and Stata to check and
validate results.
Parameters. The basic reproductive number R0 used for these simulations is 3.
This is a low-end reproductive number as compared to the literature on COVID-19
and a cross-country estimation prepared by the authors based on publicly available
information. The rest of the parameters in the model such as residence time in each
compartment and transition probabilities between compartments were estimated directly or indirectly from the existing literature or using information collected from a
data set from Mexico [10] which has been used to benchmark lethality rates by age
and gender.
Policies. Some plausible control policies were included in the model including
use of masks, contact tracing and quarantine, promoting social distance and reducing
infection time by self-awareness. Results are presented for four sets of parameters

described in the Results sections. Two of the simulations include contact tracing
policies and two exclude them, and for each of these options we simulate the baseline
contact rate (no reduction in contact rate) and a 33% reduction in contact rate,
which can be the result of different distancing or isolation policies. Pharmaceutical
treatments are not included in the model since there is no known-effective therapy.
Nevertheless, if one wishes to do so, the parameters p and w in the model can be
changed to reduce the lethality of the disease. The same applies for vaccines which
would require a reduction in the contact rate.
Results of the Deterministic Solution. Results of the deterministic solutions
are shown in tables 12 to 15. It is shown that, with no reduction in contact rate and
no contact tracing, 95% of the population will be infected, although the mortality
will be comparatively low (less than 2 in 1000) mainly because of the large share of
young people among refugees (60 % is less than 20 years old in the Za’atari refugee
camp). The simulations also show that 3/4 of the infections will be reached in about
10 weeks. Since the time to first death is also about 7 weeks, the epidemic will not
be noticeable for the first month and a half and will be running underground, with
an estimate of 25 % of infections by week 8.
Most of the disease will manifest itself in hospitals and intensive care units. The
simulations reveal that, in the worst case scenario of those studied, 1,806 and 1,052
bed-days1 are required in hospital and Intensive Care (IC) units respectively. With
the average time of hospitalization used (three days), 49 beds in hospitals and and
25 in IC units will be required to fulfill most of the demand.
If we perform contact tracing and quarantine 1/3 of the infected individuals, the
epidemic size will drop from 94% of the population to 85%. If we reduce the contact
rate by 1/3, the epidemic size is reduced to 79% of the population. Both strategies
combined will reduce the epidemic size to 58%, although achieving this reduction
would be difficult in refugee camps [23].
The analysis suggests that it is important to concentrate efforts on reducing the
effective contact rate by encouraging the use of face masks and promoting social

distance, whereas testing and contact tracing is a less effective strategy due mainly
to the high R0 value. Also, promoting a reduction in the infectious time through
education and self-awareness is of little effect, mainly because the fraction of symptomatic individuals requiring hospitalization is small, and the epidemics is clearly
driven by those asymptomatic or not requiring hospitalization.
Lock-downs are effective to avoid the virus from entering the camp. But the
likelihood that this can be actually implemented in an effective way is dubious. The
disease will enter the camp if there is some kind of interaction between the camp and
any city or village nearby where an outbreak has began. Since a small fraction of
individuals will develop symptoms that require hospitalization, this means that, on
average, there will be many infections before the first infected individual is noticed
(the time to first death is on average over 6-7 weeks), which makes a lock-down
ineffective. Individual isolation is also difficult [23], mainly because it requires the
isolation of at least all members of a family.
Results of the Stochastic Solution. The average number of deaths and beddays calculated in the stochastic model are similar to those obtained for the deterministic model.2 Nevertheless, there are important differences in the maximum
number of hospitalized in a day as well as in the number of beds required to cover
the demand of hospital and ICU services. Other differences are related to the time to
some events such as the time to reach a given percentage of infections. In a stochastic
model, we are discarding those simulations in which the epidemic vanished quickly
with no deaths, thus, the distributions are switched to the right of the deterministic
model and the time to the occurrence of an event is larger.
In the results sections, we also present figures illustrating the number of beds
required to fulfill the demand for bed-days, also including the margins of error. For
example, we can see from Figure 7 (top panel) that, with 83 beds, it would be possible
to satisfy 90% of the demand for hospital beds, whereas 48 beds would be required
to satisfy 90% of the demand for beds in Intensive Care Units (ICUs, bottom panel).
Standard errors are included in all figures and represented by vertical bars.

Validation of results In an attempt to benchmark and validate our results,
we compare them with one other similar study conducted in a refugee camp in the
Cox’s Bazar district of Bangladesh, and with the information emerging on COVID-19
outbreaks in refugee camps.
In our knowledge, there is only one other study that estimated the potential
impact of COVID-19 in refugee camps. This is a study conducted by John Hopkins
University on the Kutupalong-Balukhali Extension Site, Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh
[23]. We first compare the results of this study with the results of our study on
the Za’atari refugee camp in Jordan and then compare the two models used by
these studies applying our SIZ model to Kutupalong-Balukhali Extension Site. To
note that the JHU-SEIR model also estimates the probability of an outbreak (with
probabilities ranging from 61 to 92%), whereas the WB-SIZ model only considers
outcomes following an outbreak.
Table 1 reports the key parameters and results of the two studies. The two studies
result in very similar estimates on the population shares of infected people at the end
of the epidemic. The JHU study for the Cox’s Bazar refugee camp reports 91.1%
infection rate with an R0 comprised between 2 and 3 whereas our study reports
an infection rate of 94.2% with an R0 of 3. Similarly, our model applied to the
Kutupalong-Balukhali Extension Site finds an infection rate of 94.3%. Essentially,
all simulations concord in finding that, at the end of the epidemics and with no
pre-existing immunity (something that is still debated in the literature), the quasitotality of people are expected to be infected.
However, there are significant differences across the two models in terms of overall
numbers of hospitalizations, hospitalizations in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and
deaths. Both studies find relatively small shares of people in need of hospitalization
(between 0.6 and 4.4 %), ICUs (between 0.1 and 1.4%), and low death rates (between
0.1 and 0.4 %), which are rates consistent with the latest literature. It is also

understood that these low rates are mainly explained by the relatively young age
of the population living in refugee camps. However, the the JHU study provides
estimates that are much higher than our estimates. The main explanations for this
difference are the benchmark data used by the two studies for the transitions between
infections, hospitalizations and death and the age adjustments. Our study relies on
a comprehensive data set of individual observations from Mexico, whereas the JHU
study relies on information available in the literature. As it is uncertain what best
applies to refugee camps, the most suitable interpretation of these differences is in
terms of ranges of possible outcomes. This implies that preparations for the outbreak
should rely on the upper estimates.
It is also possible to compare results of these simulations with the observed evolution of the spread of the disease in the Za’atari refugee camp in Jordan and the Cox
Bazaar refugee camp in Bangladesh. According to the refugee response coordination
platform in Jordan, testing in the Za’atari refugee camp has been underway and a
facility for treatment of COVID-19 cases has been already built in the expectation of
an outbreak. However, as of July 13th, 2020, no positive cases were detected3 Therefore, either the virus has not yet entered the camp or it is still in an very early stage
when casual testing is unlikely to catch positive cases. In either case, the situation
on the field cannot provide any information to validate the simulations proposed in
this study.
Some initial comparisons can instead be done between the results of the [23]
Kutupalong-Balukhali Site simulations and the evolving situation on the ground.
The first refugee COVID-19 case in the Cox’s Bazaar refugee camp was registered
around May 15th, 20204 , and, according to the WHO “As on 28 June, as many as
2,456 cases of infection have been confirmed in Cox’s Bazar District and 50 refugees
have tested positive in the Rohingya camps.”5 Therefore, the virus is widely present
in the district and in the camp, particularly if one considers the still limited number
of tests per day conducted in the region and the number of observed infections went

from 1 on May 15th to 50 on June 28th.
We know from studies worldwide that the true number of infections may be as
large as ten times what is observed, even in countries where testing is widespread.
According to the simulations provided by [23], “On average, in the first 30 days of
the outbreak, we expect 18 (95% prediction interval [PI], 265), 54 (95% PI, 3223),
and 370 (95% PI, 41,850) people infected in the low, moderate, and high transmission
scenarios, respectively.” The study focused on the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion
Site which is home of about 600,000 of the more than 1 m refugees in the Cox’s
bazaar district of Bangladesh, and we do not know how many of the 50 infected
cases were found in this particular zone. However, with a rough estimate of 30-40
cases, it is entirely plausible that in the 43 days that passed between May 15th and
June 28th, around 300-400 people have been infected in the camp. This would be
within the range found in [23]. The WB-SIZ model applied to the KutupalongBalukhali Expansion Site results in similar infection rates at the end of the epidemic
but reaches the end much faster than the JHU-SEIR model. This means that we
would have expected the spread of the infection to be more advanced by day 43.
This may depend of course on the effectiveness of the measures taken in the camp
but, regardless of these measures, we should expect continued growth of infections
in the next few months.
These findings warn against complacency with the low numbers of COVID-19
infected persons currently observed in Jordan and Bangladesh. Once the virus enters
the camp, the simulations in [23] and our study show that the virus can spread quickly
and widely, potentially reaching over 90% of the population. Thanks to the age and
gender profile of the camps, the number of hospitalizations and deaths will be low
relatively to older populations, but the numbers may still overwhelm hospitals and
health care facilities. In this respect, preventive measures such as building COVID-19
field hospitals as in the Za’atari refugee camp should be supported and not regarded
as excessive measures.

The compartments are described as follows:
1. All individuals start as susceptible, S. Once an individual is infected, it becomes infectious immediately, either in category I (symptomatic) or Z (asymptomatic). By symptomatic we define those individuals that will develop eventually severe symptoms that will require hospitalization, whereas an asymp-

tomatic individual refers to those that will develop none or mild symptoms
that will not require hospitalization. The probability that an infected starts as
symptomatic is p while it starts as an asymptomatic with probability (1 − p).
2. Infected asymptomatic Z, stay infected and infectious for an average amount
of time µ−1
1 . When they leave the Z stage they move immediately to stage R
(removed) where they are alive, non-infected and non-infectious. Individuals
in stage R are assumed to be immune, and they play no role in the dynamics
of the epidemic. An individual in stage Z can also be moved to stage R
without finishing the infectious stage if tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 virus.
We assume that testing is implemented according to a cordon sanitaire where
some contacts are tested for SARS-Cov-2. Testing depends on a parameter θ
that will be described later.
3. Infected symptomatic I stay infected and infectious for some time and will
develop eventually severe symptoms that will require hospitalization. An individual in stage I will move out of the I stage for two reasons: either this
individual developed severe symptoms and moves to hospitalization H which
occurs at a rate µ2 or it moves to temporary quarantine RT which occurs at
a rate µ2 α. Parameter α reflects the possible effect on self-awareness. When
individuals are more aware of the epidemic, its more likely that they will attribute classical symptoms of the disease as being infected, thus may reduce
contact rate and self-isolate. α = 0 implies individuals keep infectious until
they develop severe symptoms and move to hospitalization. α > 0 implies
individuals will stop being infectious by self-awareness and self-isolation before
the onset of severe symptoms.
4. Infected symptomatic I may also leave stage I by testing, as it was described
for individuals in stage Z. The only difference is that individuals tested positive
in stage I do not move to stage R since they are quarantined in a compartment
RT temporarily, where they remain until the appearance of severe symptoms
that will require hospitalization. Testing depends on a parameter θ that will
be described later.

5. Individuals removed temporarily in RT , move to hospitalization H at a rate
µ2 , due to the memoryless property of exponential distributions.
6. Hospitalized individuals H remain hospitalized for an average amount of time
µ−1
3 and they will need intensive care C with probability q or recover R and
become immune with probability 1 − q.
7. Individuals in intensive care C stay in this stage for an average time µ−1
4 and
may die with probability w or recover and become immune with probability
(1 − w).

3.2

Parameters

The parameters in the model are:
• λ, the contact rate, that is, the average number of contacts per unit of time.
• µ−1
1 , the average time in the compartment Z.
• µ−1
2 , the average time in the compartment I.
• µ−1
3 , the average time in hospitalization (not in intensive care).
• µ−1
4 , the average time in the intensive care unit.
• p, the probability that an infected individual becomes a symptomatic.
• q, the proportion of hospitalized individuals that will require intensive care.
• w, the proportion of individuals in intensive care that die from the infection.
• θ, the fraction of infected contacts that are removed due to testing. θ = 0
implies no testing, while θ = 1/2 half of the infected contacts of an individual
that has been tested positive, are removed.
• α, is the effect on the exit rate from compartment I by symptom awareness
and self isolation. α = 0 means no reduction in average in stage I due to

effects) changes from µ2 to µ2 (1 + α).

3 THE SIZ MODEL

Comments on the model and parameters

• The model does not consider infections caused by individuals in stages H and C
(Hospitalized). This has been documented, but nosocomial infection is reduced
in comparison to the rest of the susceptible.
• The model assumes implicitly that there is never shortage of beds in hospitals,
including intensive care units. It is, therefore, an approximation.
• In the model, stages I and Z are separated for three reasons:
– Individuals in stage I can reduce the average time in that stage with
appropriate information, tending to be alert to the onset of symptoms
which will allow them to self-isolate totally or partially. This is controlled
by α.
– It is important to keep the ratio Z/(I + Z) = 1 − p, that is, we need to
observe the fact that a proportion of those infected are asymptomatic.
– Separating I and Z would allow to change the infectiousness of the two
kind of infected, if necessary.
• Although it is clear that the outcome of the epidemics is affected by the age
structure of the population (seems that lethality is higher in older people), if
we are willing to concede that all age categories are equally likely to become
infected [24] but they respond differentially to the disease, then there is no need
to write a model that include a compartment for each age category (with the
necessary associated parameters) but to apply the distribution of differential
lethality a posteriori. This will be explained in detail later in this report.
• The model lacks of a latent or exposed class for two reasons:
– There are reports [20] that infected individuals become infectious quickly,
sometimes in the first 1-2 days.
– A latent class does not change R0 nor the final epidemic size, only delay
events in the rest of the compartments a little bit.

4 THE DETERMINISTIC SOLUTION OF THE MODEL

• It is clear that the model cannot be solved explicitly, in the sense that we cannot
derive analytic expressions for S(t), Z(t), I(t), H(t), C(t), R(t), RT (t) and D(t).
We will solve those expressions numerically and simulate a stochastic version of
the model. But we will find analytic expressions for the long range behaviour
of R(t) and D(t).
• All parameters above will be estimated or deducted from medical literature so
far, except λ.
• Testing in the model refers to testing for actual infection with SARS-CoV-2,
not for IgG or IgM (immunity tests). Laboratory testing always is implemented
several weeks after the outbreak when the strains are identified and kits produced, so, it is necessary to set θ = 0 at the beginning of the epidemic.
• Parameter θ, the testing capacity needs special explanation: it is assumed
that when individuals in stage I develop symptoms, they are tested and some
of its contacts are tested. θ is the fraction of all infected contacts that are
removed from circulation by testing. This shortens the infectious time of tested
individuals (independently if they are in stage I or Z) by half, by property of
exponential distributions.
• Choosing an appropriate parameter α is as follows: the average time spent in
stage I with no testing is µ2 + αµ2 = µ2 (1 + α). If we assume that certain
informative policy may reduce the average time to a fraction f of its original
value, then α = 1/f − 1.

The Deterministic Solution of the Model
Transitions between compartments

All rates between compartments are the product of three elements: an individual
event rate, the number of individuals affected by the previous rate and a thinning
probability.

Since the individual rate is the rate of a Poisson process, the resulting product is

Adjusted lethality by age group and gender

Parameter p in the model, the probability that an individual will eventually develop
severe symptoms that will require medical attention, is one of the most important
parameters that define the outcome of the epidemic in terms of fatalities. The
relevance of p is that it is a property of the disease. However, p seems to depend
on the age of the infected, p being higher for older individuals. In this section, we
calculate the lethality for age group which will allow us to estimate a global p at the
population level. We will then show how to obtain the p for a population with a
different age structure, as in refugee camps.
Tables 3 and 4 show the characteristics of hospitalization, intensive care and
deaths by age group for Mexico’s COVID-19 epidemic using Mexico’s IMSS database6 .
6

We used a database of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases maintained by the IMSS
in Mexico (Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social, or Mexican Institute of Social Security) that
serves about 12 million persons, non-government workers, and cover roughly 10% of the Mexican
population. The data on SARS-CoV-2 we used contains records of 26,039 confirmed cases from
March 2, 2020 to May 25, 2020. We discarded all cases with symptoms not starting in the previous
14 days to the last reported case (May 25, 2020) and from these, included only cases with disease
outcome as dead or recovered, leaving a database with 10,330 cases.

Column f contains the relative frequencies of each age group. Column h shows how
the hospitalizations where distributed among the different age groups. Column c
shows, for each age group, the proportion of individuals that needed intensive care
from those who went to hospital. Column d shows, for each age group, the proportion
of individuals that died from those who went to hospital.
From these, we obtain the raw lethality by age group u = h ◦ d. Overall lethality
0
is f1 u. Nevertheless, we cannot estimate the lethality with f 0 u since we are including
only data from individuals that went to the I compartment and then to hospitalization whereas lethality should consider all infections. In other words, we do not have
information on how many people went to compartment Z.
Estimates of the overall lethality are in the range 0.001 − 0.003 [21, 8]. We will
use the lethality reported by [8] of 86 in 100, 000 (about 0.001) because it is a more
recent study with a large number of blood donors (the possibility that conditions in
refugee camps can worsen the severity of the outbreak will be considered later in our
model).
Based on this lethality, we need to adjust u so that f 0 u = 0.001, which implies a
normalization factor k = 0.001/(f 0 u) = 0.0347. We then obtain the adjusted lethality
θ as θ = ku. By performing this analysis by gender and age group, we obtain Tables
3 and 4. The interpretation of adjusted lethality is as follows: if we select a male
person at random from the population in age group 30 − 39, the probability that
this person will die from COVID-19 given that the person is infected is 0.000811,
whereas if it is a female, the probability is 0.000381

Adjusted lethality in the Za’atari refugee camp

If the information necessary for the estimation of the adjusted lethality rate is not
available, as for areas not yet reached by the virus such as the Za’atari refugee camp,
one can use the adjusted lethality of a reference population. For example and for

the case of Za’atari camp, we can use the adjusted lethality estimated for Mexico by
age group and adjust these lethality rates using the age and gender structure of the
Syrian population living in the camp. The composition of the population structure
of Syrian refugees in Jordan is shown in Table 5. Using this age and gender structure,
the adjusted lethality for the camp is obtained with:
0
θM + fF0 θF = 0.000428
fM

which is about 2.3 times smaller than the calculated from the Mexican IMSS data,
due to the higher relative frequency of younger ages.

The parameters p, q and w

The adjusted lethality that we estimated for the Za’atari camp (0.000428) starting
from the IMSS data can be expressed as the product pqw. From the same IMSS
data, we can also estimate the product qw (the fraction of individuals that will die,
given that they entered the I compartment) as:
qw =

Number of deaths
Number of deaths + Number of recoveries

21

which is 0.1675 (note that the number of recoveries is only among those that went
through the I compartment). It is then straighforward to estimate p as p = pqw/qw =
0.000428/0.1675 = 0.0026. This implies about 1 in 400 infected will become symptomatic infected, in this particular camp. The fraction of hospitalized that require
intensive care (q) is derived from data on Iceland7 , where this parameter is estimated
at about 0.25. Finally, from q, we can derive w as qw/q = 0.1675/0.25 = 0.67.

4.5

Estimation of the exit rates µi

The exit rates are the inverse of the average time in a given stage. For the deterministic model, if L is the average time in some state, then the exit rate µ = 1/L.
4.5.1

Infected symptomatic (I)

The most recent and comprehensive report on the duration of the period a person
remains infectious comes from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases in Singapore8 . This study suggests that this period may begin around 2 days before the onset
of symptoms, and persists for about 7 - 10 days after the onset of symptoms. That
is a total period of between 9 and 12 days. However, people who are symptomatic
become aware of the infection by definition and should be expected to take measures
such as isolation to contain the spread of he virus. If this factor is taken into account,
one can estimate the period of infectiousness at 5 days as suggested in [13]. See also
[2] and [15]. Therefore, we take µ2 = 1/5
There is no data on the variance of this parameter, but if we use a gamma
distribution and consider that subjects have no more symptoms after 12 days (see
[13]) we can estimate a standard deviation. We need n and γ such that n/γ = 5 and
CDFX (n, γ; 12) = 0.95. This yields n = 6, γ = 1.1765, for an average time of 5 days
and a standard deviation of 4.33.

Infected asymptomatic (Z)

For the infected asymptomatic, we can use a value of µ1 = 1/11 based on the
Singapore study already cited.9 , alhtough we are aware than other studies such as
[25], [9] and [11] have higher estimates, around 20 days.
There is not much information on the variance of the duration in the asymptomatic period and we will use a standard deviation of 7 days.
4.5.3

Hospitalized (H)

This parameter strongly depends on the availability of human resources, equipment
and infrastructure. From IMSS data, we estimate it to be 3 days with S.D. of 2.91
days. Thus our estimate of µ3 = 1/3.
4.5.4

Intensive care unit (C)

From IMSS data, we estimate it to be 7 days with S.D. 4 days, for µ4 = 1/7.
4.5.5

Temporary quarantined (RT )

There is no way to estimate this parameter, since it depends on the time to symptoms
onset after the individual has left the I stage by self-awareness of testing. We use
the memoryless property of exponential distributions. The individual will remain an
exponential amount of time in this stage, with parameter equal to the inverse of the
average time in the previous stage, which is 1/5, but reduce the SD to 4 days.

Estimation of λ and R0

23

In the equation above, λ is an arbitrary parameter which is based on the COVID19 literature and a specific exercise that we devised to estimate λ with publicly
available cross-country data. This section explains this exercise and the specific
choice of R0 = 3 we made.
The contact rate λ we attempt to estimate is the raw contact rate. That is,
it represents the true potential transmission of the disease, and can be measured
at the onset of the epidemic. Countries first affected by the pandemic provide a
more precise estimate of the pandemic since other countries are expected to be more
prepared and are likely to have implemeted measures that may affect λ. The raw
contact rate λ is close to the transmission potential of a disease when the individuals
do not react to reduce it, by means of pharmaceutical interventions or by reducing
exposure activities. It is important, therefore, to estimate λ using existing crosscountry data. This will give us information not only on the true potential of the
disease but also on how much λ can be reduced with preparedness. Once the λs are
estimated, we can estimate the respective R0 s.
To estimate λ, it is customary to use observations on reported cases, mainly infections, which are recorded mostly when individuals report the onset of symptoms.
In our model, that would exclude the Z (asymptomatic) individuals and would only
consider the I (symptomatic) individuals. In most cases, the date reported as the
date of a confirmed case is the day a test was made, or even the day the laboratory
results were given, and rarely the date of onset of the symptoms. This adds considerable noise to the timing of the cases. Figure 5 shows an hypothetical example of the
lag between the time when individuals enter the I compartment and the reported
time.
As an alternative to using the number of infections, here we use the growth rate
in compartment D (deaths), which we believe is less prone to error in the timing
at which an individual entered that stage. The problem of underreporting is still
present but reduced as compared to infections, and the time of death is much more
accurate than the time of infection.
In general terms, once all other model’s parameters have been set, we choose an
initial λ and solve equations 8. With this numerical solution, we obtain the best fit
to the observed data in cumulative deaths and then repeat this procedure until the

best λ value is found within a predefined region. The need to seek the best fit of the
solution D(t) for a given λ is due to the fact that the beginning of the outbreak is
unknown and thus we need to find a k value so that D(t + k) is the best match to
the observed data on cumulative deaths.
For this exercise, we use the accumulated number of deaths in 185 countries taken
from the data set of Johns Hopkins University [6]. For each country we use the first
15 days of data at the onset of the epidemic starting the day when the accumulated
number of deaths was at least 5. Countries with a low R2 were rejected leaving only
40 countries with reliable estimates. For all countries but Germany, the calculated
beginning from our model occurred before the date of first confirmed case.
Table (6) contains the main statistics derived from the cross-country estimation
of λ and R0 . Estimates of λ vary between 0.172 and 0.366 with a mean value of

Figure 6 shows the relationship between the age of the pandemic and R0 . For
each country, we took as index the day the epidemic reached 5 confirmed cases.
Then we took all dates and subtracted the minimum date, so that the indexes are
now relative to the country with the first outbreak (excluding China), which is Italy.
There is an almost linear relationship between the age of the pandemic and the R0
in analyzed countries. The fact that R0 is reduced for countries that experienced the
epidemic at later stages indicates the importance and impact of preparing for the
epidemic.

resulted in R0 varying between 2.73 and 5.789, which are values consistent with the
COVID-19 literature. The same exercise also shows that higher values correspond to
countries that experienced the epidemic at later stages as compared to Italy. These
findings should be taken into account when we consider refugee camps still untouched
by the pandemic. We should use a baseline value closer to the lower bound estimated
with the cross-country exercise. Hence, our choice of a R0 = 3. However, as R0 is
an input parameter, all results can be quickly reproduced with alternative R0 s.

The role of demographics and control policies on the
parameters

There are factors affecting outcomes that are characteristics of the demographics
of the population. As mentioned before, differential morbidity by age and gender

has been amply documented for COVID-19. Also, population size and density and
other factors that affect camps specially, like poverty and other health issues may
be very important. Control policies like the use of face masks, reducing contacts,
contact tracing and testing (cordon sanitaire), pharmaceutical treatments, improvement of medical assistance through increasing hospitalization capacity and adding
more personnel or even vaccination if it becomes available are all policies that can
affect outcomes. In this section, we discuss how all of these changes can be simulated
in our model (or are implicit already) without the need of adding more parameters.
1. Demographics: The model can accomodate demographic changes as already
described in section 4.3 for the estimation of the adjusted lethality by age
and gender. In essence, demographic changes affect the estimation of p, the
likelihood that an individual will become a symptomatic infected. As p is the
first parameter to enter the model, all other estimations take the demographic
structure into consideration.
2. Population density: this can be included in the contact rate. There is a
linear relationship between contact rate and R0 , since this is just the contact
rate times the average infectious time. Although we do not exactly know how
much the density will affect the contact rate, this effect can be taken into
account by multiplying λ for a constant (C3), which is the number of times we
believe the contact rate is increased because of crowdedness.
3. Household size: The household size is an important effect to consider, and
there are two reasons why we did not include it into the model explicitly. First,
household size is implicit in the population density, so, the larger the household
size, the larger the density per square km, and thus we can increase the contact rate, as pointed out before. Second, in the particular case of COVID-19,
which is highly contagious, if we are willing to assume that all members of the
household will be infected when a single member of the household becomes
infected, then it is possiblle to show that R0 increases by a factor equal to
the average household size, which will take the epidemic size to a much higher
level. Since, as it will be discussed later, we can expect a very large fraction of

28

the population to become infected without modeling households, adding this
level of complexity is unnecessary.
4. Health issues There are several studies on how the lethality of SARS-CoV-2
is increased due to health issues like obesity, diabetes, respiratory diseases or
habits like smoking [18, 22, 1]. Most odds ratios in those studies are large with
a large SD. Including this differential lethality in our model for RC is impossible
because there is no information available on the incidence of these conditions
among the refugees. We can only think that the likelihood of becoming symptomatic (parameter p), the chances of moving to ICU while in hospitalization
(parameter q), and the chances of dying while in ICU (parameter w) in our
model all increase if health issues are present. However, the amount is left to
speculation.
5. Poverty Poverty includes a wide range of factors that affect the outcome of the
epidemic in a given community. Poverty is related to reduced education (which
affects the ability of camp administrators to implement control measures), diminished nutrition and reduced medical attention. There are no specific studies
that analyze how poverty affects the outcome of an epidemic but surely a reduced level of education tends to reduce the perception of the importance of
the disease and thus may not reduce the contact rate λ, whereas lack of nutrition and medical attention affect p, q and w in our model. Again, the amount
to increase is left to speculation. An analysis of the relationship between the
number of doctors in a city as a surrogate of wealth, and the number of cases
is shown in [19].
6. Social distancing and lock-down Social distancing is reflected in the model
as a reduction in the contact rate λ. In Figure 6 we saw how the R0 is reduced in
time across countries due to learning, which allowed some countries to prepare
for the arrival of the pandemic. This implies that it is possible to prepare by
reducing the contact rate through reinforcing and encouraging social distancing.
However, in refugee camps measures such as social distancing are evidently
more difficult to apply. Also, the possibility that the disease will not enter a

29

refugee camp is very low as camps’ supplies strongly depend on the interaction
with people outside the camp.
7. Face masks The effect of face masks is similar to that of an altruistic vaccine.
It is not very effective in reducing infection of the mask-user, but reduces the
ability to transmit the infection. Therefore, regarding the epidemic size, they
act as a vaccine. The use of surgical masks has been reported to be effective
in the transmission of the disease [7, 5], and [12] even suggests that frequent
mask use in public venues, frequent hand washing, and disinfecting the living
quarters were significant protective factors of infections (Odds Ratio 0.36 to
0.58). Nevertheless, the large number of infections reported among nurses and
doctors that certainly worked wearing a surgical mask, imply some limit to
this protective effect in crowded environments with a lot of infected people. If
wearing a mask reduces the emission of coronavirus droplets from an infected
person to a fraction φ, then lambda is reduced to λφ. If we assume that masks
protect equally susceptible persons by reducing the virus droplets by the same
amount, then λ is reduced to λφ2 . There is no information on the value of φ,
and we only can speculate on some positive value. Nevertheless, we must be
cautious since by considering that λ reduces to λφ2 we are implicitly assuming
that a reduction in virus droplets by a half will reduce the likelihood of being
infected by a half, which is not necessarily true.
8. Contact tracing, testing and quarantine As mentioned earlier, the cordon sanitaire consists on locating people that had contact with an infected
individual and quarantine them. Parameter θ in our model is an attempt to
account for this effect, in the sense that θ is how good we are at detecting and
isolating infected contacts. However, θ is a parameter we need to input as a
guess estimate.
9. Vaccination A vaccine that has efficacy β reduces the contact rate to λβ.
There is no current candidate vaccine and is seriously challenged that it will
be developed within a year. Even if a candidate vaccine is available now,
the testing time through phase IV takes over a year, even if all the permits

30

are speeded up. Therefore, modelling the impact of a vaccine is currently
premature.
10. Pharmaceutical interventions Pharmaceutical interventions or any other
treatment is included in parameters q and w in the model. Any increase in survival of individuals due to medical treatment should be included as a decrease
in q or w.
11. Herd immunity The herd immunity is just the thinning term S/N in the first
two rows of Table 2. The larger the infected group, the smaller the probability
that the next contact of an infected person will be with a susceptible person.
The highest peak of herd immunity is reached when the product (I +Z)∗S/N is
maximum, which is achieved when the number of active infected is equal to the
number of susceptible. Although sometimes herd immunity has been referred
to as a policy or resource, this is not the case. Exposing the population by not
implementing social distancing or lock-down will only accelerate the time to
final outcome and will increase the demand of medical services at any time.
There has been some claims that there is no guarantee that immunity is
achieved. Still, the number of cases reported at the global level of a second
infection are scarce and dubious. If immunity is a fact, then, surveillance for
immunity is useful in order to avoid a full collapse of economic activities in
the camp. Random testing, and in particular testing those who recovered, is
important to measure the size of compartment R at all times. There is the
possibility of deducting this by analyzing the ratio Recovered/Deaths. At the
worldwide level, on May 19, JHU reported 319, 213 deaths and 1, 805, 093 recovered, that is, for every death there are at least 5.6 recovered. This is a very
conservative estimate, because the number of undetected recoveries is larger
than the number of undetected deaths, since most of the recoveries detected
were more among symptomatic than among asymptomatic, and the first group
has a larger mortality than the second.

Sensitivity analysis

A sensitivity analysis consists in analyzing the effect of changes in the parameters
on the output of the epidemic. We concentrate on the effect of the parameters on
R0 . With LZ = 1/µ1 , LI = 1/µ2 where LI and LZ are the respective average times
in compartments I and Z, the equation for R0 can be expressed as follows:


pLI
LZ (1 − p)
R0 = λ
+
1+θ
(1 + α)(1 + θ)

(10)

We can see in (10) that R0 depends on λ, p, µ1 , µ2 , θ and α. As mentioned
before, the value of p is determined by the nature of the disease and the demographic
structure of the population and, in this sense, p can be considered as a fixed and
exogenous parameter. Changes in λ are possible by reducing the contact rate with
active policies such as social distancing or the use of face masks [7, 5, 12]. Changes
in µ1 and µ2 are possible by testing and isolation policies for the infected, which
reduce the average time in compartments Z and I, and increase the exit rates from
these compartments.
How sensitive is R0 to changes in λ, θ and α? Figure 4 shows changes in R0
when λ = 0.3, LI = 5, LZ = 11, p = 0.0172, θ = 0.25 and α = 0.25. The left-hand
panel shows absolute changes whereas the right-hand panel shows percentage changes
(elasticities). Results show that λ is the most elastic and important parameter (a
1% increase in λ resuts in a 1% increase in R0 ), which implies that we need to focus
on reducing the contact rate. θ and α are much less elastic, implying that it is much
more difficult to contain the spread of the disease with testing, contact tracing or
self-isolation due to symptom awareness. This is mainly due to the fact that there is
a smaller amount of symptomatic individuals that could reduce their infectious time
and have a significant effect on the epidemic.

The Stochastic Solution of the Model

In a stochastic model, the current state of the process is a vector X(t0 ) that will
change to some state X(t0 + t) in some time t. Whereas in deterministic models the
word simulation is used to refer to the numerical solution of a system of differential
equations, in stochastic models it has a different interpretation: the transition from
the current state X(t0 ) to the state X(t0 + t) is random, as well as the time for
the transition, t. Given some current state of the process, the change in the state
that will occur next as well as when the change will take place are calculated using
transition rates expressed in terms of probabilities.
The main difference between deterministic and stochastic models reside in the
algorithms for the transitions between compartments. Suppose that, after leaving
a compartment, a person can move to two different compartments at rates α1 and
α2 respectively. In a deterministic model, a fraction α1 /(α1 + α2 ) moves to one
compartment and another fraction α2 /(α1 + α2 ) moves to the other. In a stochastic
model, the individual moves to each compartment according to probabilities. If we
take a look at the model in Figure 1, we can see for instance that an individual in stage
H can move to stage C or R at rates µ3 q and µ3 (1 − q) respectively. Therefore, the
probability that this person will move to C is µ3 q/(µ3 q + µ3 (1 − q)) = q, which is the
relative share of those rates. To decide if the individual moves to R or C we generate
a random number u from a uniform distribution in (0, 1) and if u < q the individual
moves to stage C, otherwise this individual moves to R. In the deterministic model,
a fraction q of the individual moves to stage C and a fraction 1 − q to stage R.
Given the current state of the process as a vector containing the number of
individuals in each class of:
X(t) = [S Z I RT H C R D]
we first construct a list of all possible events that can take place at the next step,
along with their rates. In our particular model, this list is given in Table 8. Observe
that the list is obtained from the rates of the differential equations model. To decide
which of the 12 possible events will take place, we take a single observation from a
multinomial random variable with parameters

where gi = rate of event and G = i gi . Once we decide which event takes place,

Time to event simulation

In the previous section we explained how to simulate a series of transitions in a
continuous-time discrete-state stochastic process, that produces a vector X(t) at
each iteration. Nevertheless, we need to simulate the time between transitions, that
is, the index t.
In a stochastic model, when an individual is in some compartment and this individual leaves the compartment at a rate µ, it means that the individual will remain

35

in that compartment according to a random variable T that follows an exponential
distribution with parameter µ. That is:
P (T < t) = 1 − e−µt
If there are n individuals in that compartment, the time for the next individual
to leave the compartment is clearly the minimum of n exponential random variables,
which is also exponential with parameter nµ, that is, the time for the next individual
to leave the compartment is:
P (T < t) = 1 − e−nµt
Therefore, we can simulate the time to the next individual to leave this compartment
using:
T = − log(u)/(nµ)
where u is a random number from an uniform distribution in (0, 1). Using this,
the time to the next transition is an exponential random variable with parameter
P
R = i Ri . Therefore, the time to the next transition can be simulated as:
T = − log(u)/

X

Ri

It is important to notice that the inter-event times are independent of the event
that will take place. That is, the time to the next transition and the type of the next
transition are independent.

5.2

Accelerating the simulations

Time to event simulations are generally inefficient computationally since only one
individual moves at the time. The simulation stops when no more individuals can
leave a compartment which in our case is when all individuals are distributed among
S, R or D. The number of transitions depends largely on the population size, and
for a population of size N it could be up to 5N , since in our model approximately
N individuals will move to up to 5 stages.

There is a way to speed up the simulations, based on the relationship between
exponential and Poisson distributions. This can be explained by looking at Figure 5.
In this figure, there are n = 8 events that take place at the same rate. In time to event
simulations the system will change state when the first event occurs, which is event
E5 in Figure 5. In our approximation, we select a window of size W , and calculate
the probability that an event takes place in that window, call this p. Then, the
number of events that takes place in that window is a Binomial random variable with
parameters (n, p). Since the number of individuals in a compartment is, in general,
large and W can be very small, we can then approximate the binomial distribution
with a Poisson distribution with parameter np. Clearly, the limit when W → 0 is
the same as performing time to event simulation. In short, instead of simulating one
single event at the time, we generate all the events that will occur in a window of
size W . The smaller the size of the window, the better the approximation, because
the events inside W are not independent.
In our simulations, we take W = 1/24, that is, we change the system at unit
steps of an hour. This will require about 365 × 24 = 8, 760 transitions to simulate
an outbreak with a duration of one year, instead of the approximate half a million
simulations for a refugee camp of 100, 000 people. Another advantage is that this
Poisson approximation is independent of the population size.

5.3

Matching the mean and variance in stochastic simulations

Next, we calibrate simulations to reproduce real data. The idea is to match the
reported (observed) mean and variance of different stages, for instance, for the Z
and I stages. Assuming that the time in a compartment is exponential yields a
mean equal to the standard deviation, which is undesirable. For instance, if we
assume that the time in stage Z lasts on average 11 days, then an ordinary stochastic
approach to the model in Figure 1 will cause an individual to stay in that stage for
an average 11 days with a standard deviation of 11 days, which is different from the
reported (observed) 7 days that can be found in the literature and are described in
the deterministic report.

Figure 5: If inter-event times are exponential with parameter µ, the number of events

The method consits of dividing each stage in several compartments with an exponential duration each, so that the passage through all of them has the desired mean
and variance. The number of compartments and the individual rates depend on
how precise is the approximation we want to those two first central moments. This
method of approximation is called Phase distribution. [16, 17, 3, 14, 4]. In theory, it
is possible to match as many moments as we want, although in here we only try to
match the first two central moments, and we sacrifice precision in order to keep the
number of total compartments relatively small. Observe that our method is different
from the one reviewed in [4] in which a stage is subdivided in compartments with
identical exit rates. Phase distribution methods are not restricted to identical exit
rates.
Figure 6 shows the number of compartments required for each stage, Table 9
shows the required rates for each compartment and Table 10 shows the match

When an individual enters a stage, this person actually enters the first compartment

cause the mean and variance of the time to cross all the compartments to be equal
