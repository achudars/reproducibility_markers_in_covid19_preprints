Abstract
Background: Given the extensive time needed to conduct a nationally representative
household survey and the commonly low response rate in phone surveys, rapid online surveys
may be a promising method to assess and track knowledge and perceptions among the general
public during fast-moving infectious disease outbreaks.
Objective: To apply rapid online surveying to determine knowledge and perceptions of
coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) among the general public in the United States (US) and
the United Kingdom (UK).
Methods: An online questionnaire was administered to 3,000 adults residing in the US and
3,000 adults residing in the UK who had registered with Prolific Academic to participate in online
research. Strata by age (18 - 27, 28 - 37, 38 - 47, 48 - 57, or ≥58 years), sex (male or female),
and ethnicity (White, Black or African American, Asian or Asian Indian, Mixed, or “Other”), and
all permutations of these strata, were established. The number of participants who could enrol in
each of these strata was calculated to reflect the distribution in the US and UK general
population. Enrolment into the survey within the strata was on a first-come, first-served basis.
Participants completed the questionnaire between February 23 and March 2 2020.
Results: 2,986 and 2,988 adults residing in the US and the UK, respectively, completed the
questionnaire. 64.4% (1,924/2,986) of US and 51.5% (1,540/2,988) of UK participants had a
tertiary education degree. 67.5% (2,015/2,986) of US participants had a total household income
between $20,000 and $99,999, and 74.4% (2,223/2,988) of UK participants had a total
household income between £15,000 and £74,999. US and UK participants’ median estimate for
the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with SARS-CoV-2 was 5.0%
(IQR: 2.0% – 15.0%) and 3.0% (IQR: 2.0% – 10.0%), respectively. Participants generally had
good knowledge of the main mode of disease transmission and common symptoms of Covid19. However, a substantial proportion of participants had misconceptions about how to prevent

an infection and the recommended care-seeking behavior. For instance, 37.8% (95% CI: 36.1%
– 39.6%) of US and 29.7% (95% CI: 28.1% – 31.4%) of UK participants thought that wearing a
common surgical mask was ‘highly effective’ in protecting them from acquiring Covid-19. 25.6%
(95% CI: 24.1% – 27.2%) of US and 29.6% (95% CI: 28.0% – 31.3%) of UK participants thought
it prudent to refrain from eating at Chinese restaurants. Around half (53.8% [95% CI: 52.1% –
55.6%] of US and 39.1% [95% CI: 37.4% –40.9%] of UK participants) thought that children were
at an especially high risk of death when infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Conclusions: The distribution of participants by total household income and education followed
approximately that of the general population. The findings from this online survey could guide
information campaigns by public health authorities, clinicians, and the media. More broadly,
rapid online surveys could be an important tool in tracking the public’s knowledge and
misperceptions during rapidly moving infectious disease outbreaks.

Introduction
When faced with rapidly moving infectious disease outbreaks, as is the case with coronavirus
disease 2019 (Covid-19), assessing knowledge and perceptions of relevant populations has to
be accomplished in a short time frame if the findings are to be informative to the public health
response. Population-representative household surveys generally take many months of
preparation and data collection.[1] Phone surveys are faster to conduct but are increasingly
suffering from low response rates (typically well below 10%[2]),[2] which can be a major source
of bias even when extensive weighting adjustments are undertaken.[3] In addition, unless they
use interactive voice response (which tends to further decrease the response rate [4]), phone
surveys require substantial human resources to conduct the interviews. Given these limitations,
rapid online surveys, which demand minimal human resources (beyond those needed to design
the questionnaire) and could reach large numbers of respondents in a short time frame, may be
a valuable tool to assess (and monitor over time) knowledge and perceptions of an infectious
disease in the midst of an outbreak.

Covid-19 was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.[5] On March 11th 2020, the
World Health Organization (WHO) declared Covid-19 a pandemic;[6] and by March 17th 2020,
there were more than 200,000 confirmed cases and over 8,000 reported deaths from Covid-19
across the globe.[7] The course of the Covid-19 epidemic in the United States (US) and the
United Kingdom (UK) will likely be strongly impacted by how the population behaves, which in
turn is influenced by what people know and believe about this disease.[8] A particular concern in
this regard is the spread of dis- and misinformation about Covid-19 on social media sites, which
has led the WHO to host a page with “myth busters” on their website and engage in discussions
with social media companies.[9] Understanding what the general public knows about Covid-19

and which misperceptions they hold about the condition is important for US and UK public
health authorities as well as the media to design effective information campaigns.

The speed with which Covid-19 is spreading across the world calls for rapid assessments of the
population’s knowledge and perceptions of this infection.[7] This study tests a rapid online
survey methodology to determine knowledge and misperceptions of Covid-19 among the
general adult population in both the US and the UK.

Methods
Sampling participants:
This study is a cross-sectional online survey conducted on the research platform created and
managed by Prolific Academic Ltd.. Prolific is an online platform that connects researchers with
individuals around the world who are interested in participating in online research studies.[10]
The platform’s pool of participants numbers approximately 80,000 individuals of whom circa
43% reside in the UK and 33% in the US.[11] Researchers are required to pay participants a
minimum of $6.50 per hour.

For this study, Prolific established strata by age group (18 - 27, 28 - 37, 38 - 47, 48 - 57, or ≥58
years), sex (male or female), and ethnicity (White, Black or African American, Asian or Asian
Indian, Mixed, or “Other”), as well as all combinations of these strata. Using numbers from the
latest census in the US and the UK, a given number of places for taking the questionnaire was
opened on the Prolific platform in each stratum to achieve the same distribution of participants
by age, sex, and ethnicity as in the general population. The targeted total sample size in each
country was 1,500. Participants’ eligibility for the open places in a particular stratum was
determined based on the information they had entered in their profile when registering with

Prolific. Eligible participants enrolled in the study on a first-come, first-served basis. The study
was implemented in two rounds of 1,500 participants each in the US and the UK, such that the
total target sample size in each country was 3,000. Participants had to have indicated that they
are fluent in English when registering with Prolific to be eligible for this study.

Data collection:
The data were collected using the online questionnaire shown in Text S1 and Text S2.
Participants received US$1.50 (UK participants received the equivalent in pound sterling) for
completing the questionnaire. Following an informed consent form, the questionnaire asked
participants about i) the cause, current state, and future development of the Covid-19 epidemic;
ii) the risk of a fatal disease course; iii) knowledge of symptoms and recommended healthcareseeking behavior; iv) measures to prevent a Covid-19 infection; and v) their perception of the
risk posed by individuals of East-Asian ethnicity in their community. In order to investigate to
what degree dis- and misinformation about Covid-19 has affected the general public’s beliefs
about the condition, participants were directly asked whether or not they believed several
falsehoods listed on the WHO’s “myth busters” website,[12] which the WHO selected because
they had been circulating on social media.[13] Specifically, the questionnaire asked whether
receiving a letter or package from China poses a risk of infection, and whether using hand
dryers, rinsing your nose with saline, eating garlic, applying sesame oil to the skin, taking
antibiotics, and vaccinating against pneumonia are effective in preventing a SARS-CoV-2
infection. The questionnaire was built using Qualtrics software. Participants had to answer a
question to reach the next question. Numerical entry questions did not allow for non-sensical
inputs (e.g., percentage questions were restricted to inputs between 0 and 100).

Data analysis:
For binary and categorical response options, I computed the percentage of participants who
selected each response. For binomial proportions, I calculated two-sided 95% confidence
intervals using the Wilson score interval.[14] I did not use sampling weights given that this was
not a probabilistic sample of adults and that the survey was already self-weighting by the age,
sex, and ethnicity groups used to establish the strata for sampling.

Three types of data quality checks were performed. First, participants who took less than two
minutes to complete the questionnaire were excluded from the analysis because I judged this to
indicate random clicking. This resulted in the exclusion of two participants. Second, if some
respondents used random clicking to obtain the $1.50 reward as fast as possible, then a
bimodal distribution in the time taken to complete the survey might be expected (with one study
population clicking as fast as possible and one reading the questions). I, therefore, plotted a
histogram of the time taken to complete the survey. Third, participants were asked at the end of
the questionnaire whether they looked up any answers online (“It is natural to be tempted to
look up the answer to a question, especially when it’s only a click away. For approximately how
many of the questions did you first look up the answer on Google or somewhere else before
responding? The answer to this question will not affect your payment in any way.”) and if so, for
which question. Those who self-reported looking up an answer online for a question were
excluded from the analysis for that particular question. This was the case for 81 US participants
and 63 UK participants who reported looking up the answer online on a median of 1 (IQR: 1 – 5)
and 1 (IQR: 1 – 2.5) questions, respectively.

Characteristics of the sample of adults who chose to participate in the study:
Out of 3,000 adults residing in the US and 3,000 adults residing in the UK who could participate,
2,986 and 2,988, respectively, completed the questionnaire. Approximately two thirds (64.4%
[1,924/2,986]) of US and half (51.5% [1,540/2,988]) of UK participants had a tertiary education
degree (Table 1). 67.5% (2,015/2,986) of US participants had a total household income
between $20,000 and $99,999, and 74.4% (2,223/2,988) of UK participants had a total
household income between £15,000 and £74,999. 17.3% (516/2,986) of US participants and
13.7% (409/2,988) of UK participants were current students.

Cause, current state, and future development of the Covid-19 epidemic:
On a seven-point Likert scale ranging from ‘extremely unlikely’ to ‘extremely likely’, 23.9%
(22.4% – 25.5%) of US participants and 18.4% (17.1% – 19.9%) of UK participants selected
‘slightly likely’, ‘moderately likely’, or ‘extremely likely’ when asked whether Covid-19 is a
bioweapon developed by a government or terrorist organization (Figure S2). US and UK
participants estimated that a median of 100 (IQR: 20 – 500) and 40 (IQR: 13 – 200) individuals
in their country, respectively, were currently infected with Covid-19. 61.0% (59.3% – 62.8%) of
US and 71.7% (70.1% – 73.3%) of UK participants thought that the number of fatalities from
Covid-19 in their country will be 500 people or less by the end of 2020 (Figure 2).

high risk of death when infected. Almost all participants in both countries (96.3% [95% CI:
95.6% – 97.0%] in the US and 97.5% [95% CI: 96.9% – 98.0%] in the UK) responded that
adults with other health problems were more likely to experience a fatal disease course than
those without any other health problems.

Symptoms of COVID-19 and recommended healthcare-seeking behavior:
Most participants in both the US and the UK recognized fever, cough, and shortness of breath
as three common symptoms and signs of a Covid-19 infection (Figure 4).

recommended care-seeking option of staying home and contacting their health system. About a
third of respondents stated that they would either delay care-seeking, attend the hospital
emergency department unannounced, or take a taxi or public transport to their primary care
provider (Figure 5).

(95% CI: 41.7% – 45.2%) and 36.0% (95% CI: 34.3% – 37.8%) of US and UK participants,

infected with the new coronavirus. For the purpose of this question, "highly effective" is defined
as reducing your risk of getting infected by >95% and a "face mask" is a common medical
mask.”

74.8% (95% CI: 73.2% – 76.4%) of US participants and 81.2% (95% CI: 79.8% – 82.6%) of UK
participants correctly selected “droplets of saliva that land in the mouths or noses of people who
are nearby when an infected person sneezes or coughs” as the main mode of Covid-19
transmission (Figure S3). Virtually all participants disagreed with the statement that “only older
adults can become infected with the new coronavirus” (96.5% [95% CI: 95.8% – 97.1%] of US
participants and 97.1% [95% CI: 96.5 – 97.7%] of UK participants) and thought that there is
currently no vaccine available that protects against Covid-19 (96.0% [95% CI: 95.3% – 96.7%]
of US participants and 97.5% [95% CI: 96.9% – 98.0%] of UK participants). More than 20% of
participants in both the US and the UK thought that their government should quarantine
everyone coming in from abroad for 14 days and suspend all air travel to their country (Figure
7).

Perceptions of the risk posed by community members of East-Asian ethnicity:
When asked about the prevalence of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 among East-Asian
individuals in their country, the median estimate among US and UK participants was 0.5% (IQR::
0.0% – 2.0%) and 0.5% (IQR: 0.0% – 1.0%), respectively (Figure 8). The median rose to 1.0%
(IQR: 0.0% – 5.0%) among both US and UK participants when asking about the prevalence of
Covid-19 among “adults of East-Asian ethnicity in your neighborhood who wear a face mask”.

25.6% (95% CI: 24.1% – 27.2%) of US participants and 29.6% (95% CI: 28.0% – 31.3%) of UK
participants responded with ‘yes’ to the question “Do you think it would be prudent for you to not
eat at Chinese restaurants for the next few weeks to reduce the risk of getting infected with the
new coronavirus?”. Approximately a quarter of participants (29.0% [27.4%– 30.7%] of US
participants and 24.4% [22.9% – 26.0%] of UK participants) thought one may become infected
with Covid-19 by receiving a package from China. When asked “If you were an Uber driver
today, would you try to reject ride requests from people with East Asian-sounding names (or a
profile photo of East-Asian ethnicity) to reduce your risk of getting infected with the new
coronavirus?”, 29.7% (95% CI: 28.1% – 31.3%) of US participants and 40.8% (95% CI: 39.0% –
42.5%) of UK participants responded with ‘sometimes’, ‘often’, or ‘always’ (Figure 9).

Discussion
It was possible to conduct an in-depth online assessment of knowledge and perceptions of
Covid-19 among the general public in the US and the UK in a short time frame. It took two to
three days to obtain a completed questionnaire of 22 knowledge and perception questions from
1,500 adults in each the US and the UK, when allowing enrolment only in relatively granular
strata by age, sex, and ethnicity (and each of these variables’ combinations). Importantly, the
distribution of participants by education and household income in this sample, even though not
part of the enrolment criteria, was similar to that of the general population in the US and the
UK.[15, 16] In terms of data quality, there was no indication that participants randomly clicked
on responses to earn the monetary reward as quickly as possible, with only two participants
having taken less than two minutes to complete the questionnaire and there being no evidence
of a bimodal distribution in the time taken to complete the questionnaire. The direct cost to
Prolific of administering the questionnaire was merely $8,961 ($1.50 per completed
questionnaire for a total of 5,974 participants).

Regarding the survey findings, the general public in both the US and the UK held several
important misconceptions about Covid-19. Participants in both countries generally
overestimated the probability of a fatal disease course among those infected with Covid-19 (the
case fatality rate is currently believed to be between one and two percent among reported
cases,[5, 17, 18] but could be substantially lower if there are many unreported and/or
asymptomatic cases[19]), thought that children were at an especially high risk of death from
Covid-19 (which is currently not believed to be the case[5, 18-20]), and believed that common
surgical masks are highly effective in protecting them from catching a Covid-19 infection.
Participants also likely overestimated the prevalence of Covid-19 among East-Asian individuals
in their communities. Relatedly, a substantial proportion thought that they should refrain from

frequenting Chinese restaurants, stated that they would refuse Uber rides to individuals of EastAsian ethnicity, and perceived that receiving a package from China poses a risk of a Covid-19
infection. In general, differences in knowledge and misperceptions between US and UK
participants were small.

This study’s findings on levels of knowledge and prevalence of misconceptions regarding Covid19 could inform relevant information campaigns by public health authorities and the media, as
well as communication of healthcare workers with patients. For instance, such information
provision may highlight the comparatively low case fatality rate, the low risk posed by individuals
of East-Asian ethnicity living in the US and the UK, and that children do not appear to be at a
heightened risk of dying from Covid-19. In addition, a substantial proportion of participants
appeared to believe that common surgical masks are highly effective in preventing infection with
SAES-CoV-2. Information campaigns may, therefore, want to emphasize the comparative
effectiveness of common surgical masks versus other methods of prevention, particularly
frequent and thorough handwashing and avoiding close contact with people who are sick.
Lastly, it is important to note that while the general public appeared to be well informed
regarding the common symptoms of Covid-19, over a fourth of participants selected a
healthcare-seeking option that could lead to further transmission of Covid-19. Thus, clear
messaging on the recommended care-seeking action when experiencing some of the core
symptoms of Covid-19 will be crucial.

Public health information campaigns may also want to directly target some of the mis- and
disinformation that have circulated on social media.[9, 12, 13, 21] Such measures could include
information that rinsing your nose with saline, using a hand dryer, taking antibiotics, and
gargling mouthwash are not effective prevention measures, and that receiving a letter or
package from China does not pose a risk of Covid-19 infection. These are all falsehoods listed

on the WHO’s “myth busters” website that a substantial proportion of participants in this study
believed.[12] More broadly, this study underscores the need for the WHO and other public
health bodies to continue working with social media campaigns to minimize the circulation of
inaccurate information about Covid-19. In line with recent media reporting that this conspiracy
theory has been actively spread on Twitter,[21] about one in five participants believed it to be
‘slightly likely’, ‘moderately likely’, or ‘extremely likely’ that SARS-CoV-2 is a bioweapon
developed by a government or terrorist organization.

Participants did not expect that a large number of individuals would die from Covid-19 in their
country by the end of 2020. This finding may be surprising considering that fear-inducing
headlines in the media may (at least up to a certain extent[22]) result in more attention by
readers than more emotionally neutral ones, which could result in a catastrophizing of the
epidemic. Moving forward, information campaigns on Covid-19 may need to balance the
messaging of two important facts about the Covid-19 epidemic that could be interpreted by the
general public to stand in direct conflict with each other. That is, on the one hand, the case
fatality rate of Covid-19 appears to be lower compared to other recent infectious disease
outbreaks, such as Ebola,[23] the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),[24] and the
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).[24, 25] On the other hand, however, the epidemic
could cause a large number of fatalities, which implies that actions by governments and the
general public to reduce transmission of Covid-19 could save many lives.

This study has several limitations. First, while the sample of participants is representative of the
US and UK general population by age, sex, and ethnicity, and the distribution of participants by
household income and education was similar to that in the US and UK general population,
participants may still differ from the general population on a variety of other characteristics.
These characteristics may be both correlated with their knowledge and perceptions of Covid-19

as well as with their decision to participate in the study and/or to create a profile with Prolific.
Second, the estimates of discrimination against individuals of East-Asian ethnicity may be an
underestimate because some participants may not have wanted to volunteer their discriminating
tendencies to themselves or to the researcher. However, I as the researcher had no access to
any identifying information about the research participants and participants were reminded of
this fact prior to answering the question. In addition, such social desirability bias has been found
to be lower in online surveys than in telephone or in-person surveys.[26, 27] Third, it was
possible for participants to randomly click responses in order to devote the least amount of time
to earn the $1.50 reward. In my view, this issue is unlikely to have caused major bias in this
study because i) there was no evidence of a bimodal distribution in the time taken to complete
the survey (see Figure S1), ii) while it was physically possible to complete the survey in under
90 seconds when randomly clicking on responses, only two participants completed the survey in
under two minutes, and iii) the monetary reward ($1.50) was relatively small and thus, for most
participants, unlikely to be the main motivation for participating in the study. Lastly, it is possible
that individuals looked up the answers to some of the questions online prior to answering, which
may have biased the results from factual (rather than opinion-focused) questions. Participants
were reminded of the importance not to look up answers online prior to taking the survey and
were asked at the end of the survey (while being reassured that their payment is not influenced
by whether they volunteer information on having looked up an answer online) for which, if any,
questions they searched for an answer online prior to responding.

Rapid online surveys are a promising method to assess and track knowledge and perceptions in
the midst of rapidly evolving infectious disease outbreaks. Such assessments are crucial
because ensuring that the general public is well informed about a condition like Covid-19 could
reduce unnecessary anxiety as well as reduce disease transmission and, thus, ultimately save
lives.
