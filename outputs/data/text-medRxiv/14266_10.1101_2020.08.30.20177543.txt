ABSTRACT
Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic raised concern for exposure to
healthcare providers through aerosol generating procedures, such as bronchoalveolar lavage
(BAL). Current society guidelines recommended limiting use of BAL to reduce operators’ risk for
infection, yet data on the infection rate for providers after BAL is sparse. Since March 2020, our
institution used a modified protocol to perform over 450 BALs on intubated COVID-19 patients. We
therefore sought to describe the infectious risks to providers associated with BAL.

Methods: Fifty-two pulmonary and critical care faculty and fellows at our tertiary-care, urban medical
center were surveyed. Survey participants were asked to provide the number of BALs on COVID-19
patients they performed, the number of weeks they worked on intensive care unit (ICU) services with
COVID-19 patients, and the results of any SARS-CoV-2 testing that they received. Participants were
asked to assess the difficulty of BAL on intubated COVID-19 patients as compared to routine ICU BAL
using a numeric perceived difficulty score ranging from 1 (easier) to 10 (harder).

Results: We received 47 responses from 52 surveyed (90% response rate), with 2 declining to complete
the survey. Many respondents (19/45, 42%) spent >5 weeks on an ICU service with COVID-19 patients.

The number of COVID-19 BALs performed by providers ranged from 0 to >60. Sixteen of the 35
providers (46%) who performed COVID-19 BALs underwent at least one nasopharyngeal (NP) swab to
test for SARS-CoV-2, but none were positive. Twenty-seven of the 35 providers (77%) who performed
COVID-19 BALs underwent SARS-CoV-2 serology testing, and only one (3.7%) was
positive. Respondents indicated occasionally not being able to follow aerosol-minimizing steps but
overall felt BALs in COVID-19 patients was only slightly more difficult than routine ICU BAL.

Discussion: At a high-volume center having performed >450 BALs on intubated COVID-19 patients with
aerosol-limiting precautions, our survey of bronchoscopists found no positive NP SARS-CoV-2 tests and
only one positive antibody test result. While the optimal role for COVID-19 BAL remains to be
determined, these data suggest that BAL can be safely performed in intubated COVID-19 patients if
experienced providers take precautions to limit aerosol generation and wear personal protective
equipment.

INTRODUCTION

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused tremendous amounts of
morbidity and mortality. Bacterial co-infections in viral pneumonia have been well described, especially in
the setting of influenza pandemics, and have been associated with significant mortality (1). Preliminary
studies from COVID-19 have also shown found bacterial co-infection, with especially high rates in those
with fatal outcomes (2), suggesting that identification and appropriate treatment of ba(2)cterial coinfection may improve outcomes (3). Preliminary data on a subset of our population found high
coinfection rates (4). Given the long average duration of ventilation in COVID-19 patients (5), they are
also at high risk for secondary infection with nosocomial bacterial organisms (6).
Therefore, an accurate diagnosis of bacterial superinfection of ventilated COVID-19 patients is
important for management, especially to guide appropriate antibiotic stewardship (7, 8). Bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL) with quantitative cultures can be a helpful diagnostic test in the management of severe

pneumonia (9). We have a longstanding practice of examining lower respiratory tract samples with rapid
diagnostic platforms to inform the diagnosis and treatment of severe pneumonia, as well as research the
alveolar microenvironment in severe pneumonia (4, 10).
The standard in our intensive care unit (ICU) had been nonbronchoscopic BAL performed by
respiratory therapists, with occasional bronchoscopic BAL for more challenging cases. Since the primary
method of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission is aerosolization
of respiratory droplets (11), nonbronchoscopic BAL was felt to be contraindicated. Endotracheal aspirates
have been shown to be inferior to BAL (12, 13). When done correctly for diagnostic purposes, this
maneuver also involves a long break in the closed ventilator circuit (14, 15), and thus is not preferred.
Bronchoscopic BAL was therefore felt to be the safest procedure for determining the presence and
etiology of bacterial infections in intubated COVID-19 patients.
There is concern that bronchoscopy exposes healthcare workers by generating aerosols (16).
Society and panel guidelines discourage routine use of bronchoscopy in patients with COVID-19, though
this is only based on expert opinion (17, 18). A paucity of data informs the infectious risk to providers
performing BAL in COVID-19 patients. In a single-center report of 101 COVID-19 BALs, one of two
bronchoscopists became sick with COVID-19 and had to be replaced by a third, who remained uninfected
for the duration of the study (19). Some studies where COVID-19 BAL was performed mentioned low
provider infection rates, though details are not provided (20).
We therefore designed a safety protocol for BALs in patients intubated with respiratory failure
from known or suspected COVID-19. To date in our tertiary-care, urban academic medical ICU, we have
performed over 450 bronchoscopies on such patients. Given our high volume of COVID-19 BALs, we
designed the following study to assess the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seropositivity among
bronchoscopists.

METHODS
We surveyed all clinical faculty and fellows in the Pulmonary and Critical Care Division at
Northwestern Memorial Hospital (NMH) in Chicago, IL (Survey available as Supplementary 1.) Survey
participants were asked to provide the number of COVID-19 BALs that they personally performed or

directly participated in, the number of weeks they cared for ICU patients with COVID-19, and the results
of any SARS-CoV-2 testing that they had received. Participants were asked to assess the difficulty of
BALs on intubated COVID-19 patients compared to routine ICU BALs using a numeric perceived difficulty
score ranging from 1 (easier) to 10 (harder). They were also queried regarding COVID-19 exposures
outside of work. No identifiers were collected, and all respondents were offered the choice to decline to
participate. We received permission from the Vice Dean of Education and our Program Director to survey
trainees. This study was reviewed and deemed exempt by our institution’s Institutional Review Board.

SARS-CoV-2 testing
Nasopharyngeal (NP) testing for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Becton and
Dickinson, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ; Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA; and an
institutionally-developed platform) was offered to providers ad hoc at the discretion of our hospital’s
infection control team, either in response to providers’ symptoms, after a known exposure without PPE, or
routine pre-procedure screening for the provider’s own medical care. Serology (Abbott Architect SARSCoV IgG, Abbott Park, IL) testing was offered to all medical staff by NMH starting in June 2020.

COVID-19 bronchoscopy protocol (full protocol available in Supplementary 2)
Bronchoscopies were performed in the ICU on intubated patients with respiratory failure from
either known or suspected COVID-19. The decision to perform bronchoscopy was at the discretion of the
ICU team, in some cases to establish a diagnosis or in others to exclude bacterial coinfection. Bronchoscopies were performed by a pulmonary ICU attending, interventional pulmonology
(IP) attending, and/or Pulmonary/IP fellows. Nurses and respiratory therapists were not in the rooms
during the actual bronchoscopy. PPE included an N95 mask, eye protection, gloves, gown, and hair
protection. Bronchoscopy was performed with a disposable Ambu® aScope™ (Ambu Inc., Columbia,
MD) bronchoscope. Patients were sedated per ICU protocols or at the proceduralist’s discretion.
Administration of cisatracurium (0.1-0.2 mg/kg) in order to minimize coughing during bronchoscopy was
recommended. The endotracheal tube was clamped while the ventilatory circuit was manipulated to

accommodate scope placement, and the inspiratory limb of the ventilator was transiently disconnected
during the brief break in circuit.

Statistical Analyses
Survey results were exported from Qualtrics (Qualtrics XM, Provo, UT) and compiled in Microsoft
Excel (Version 15.39 for Mac, Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Graphs were generated in GraphPad Prism 8
(version 8.4.3, GraphPad Software LLC), Adobe Illustrator (Version CC for Mac, Adobe Inc, San Jose,
CA), and Python using Seaborn v0.10.1. Not all continuous data were normally distributed, and so
median values with interquartile ranges (IQR) were reported. Non-parametric analyses included MannWhitney-Wilcoxon and Spearman’s rank correlation for continuous variables. Kruskal-Wallis rank testing
was used to compare values across multiple categories.

RESULTS
We surveyed 52 clinical Pulmonary and Critical Care faculty and fellows. Forty-five respondents
(90% response rate) agreed to participate: 18 fellows and 27 attendings (Table 1, Figure 1). The majority
(35/45, 78%) had performed at least one bronchoscopy. The most common range of bronchoscopies
performed by a respondent was 10-30 bronchoscopies, which 14/45 (31%) respondents selected. Two
respondents reported performing bronchoscopy without full PPE under emergent situations, and 12
reported performing bronchoscopies without being able to follow the full protocol.
Many respondents (42%) spent >5 weeks on an ICU service with COVID-19 patients. The
number of weeks on ICU service correlated to bronchoscopy volume (Spearman r=0.66, p<0.05). The
overall median perceived difficulty score was 6 (IQR 6-7), with fellows (6.5, 5.75-7 IQR) and attendings (6,
IQR 6-7) not differing significantly (p=0.66) (Figure 3). The perceived difficulty score did not correlate with
either bronchoscopy volume (p=0.5) or time spent on ICU service with COVID-19 patients (p=0.18).
Comments included that respondents felt these bronchoscopies were quite safe given numerous
precautions instituted and adequate availability of PPE.
Sixteen of the 35 providers (46%) who performed bronchoscopies underwent at least one
nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2. No respondents reported a positive test. Five respondents

indicated having a respiratory illness that prompted their testing. Eight respondents indicated their SARSCoV-2 testing was for screening purposes only.
Twenty-seven of the 35 providers (77%) who performed bronchoscopies underwent SARS-CoV-2
serology testing. One individual (3.7%) had two sets of serology testing, with one result being positive
and another result being negative. This individual spent >5 weeks on an ICU service with COVID-19
patients, performed 10-30 bronchoscopies, but did not have any febrile respiratory symptoms.

DISCUSSION
Bronchoalveolar lavage plays an important role in the evaluation of acute respiratory failure in the
ICU. Current society guidelines recommend a limited role for bronchoscopy in the care of COVID-19
patients to minimize the potential infectious risk to beside providers of aerosol-generating procedures (17,
18). These guidelines are based on expert opinion and appropriately emphasize provider safety, but data
regarding the infectious risk of BAL to providers have been lacking. Our survey is small and limited to a
single center, but our data suggest that the risk of transmitting COVID-19 to providers performing BAL
may be low. No provider developed COVID-19, and only one had positive serology.
This survey was not a formal study of our specific bronchoscopy protocol. However, we
hypothesized that careful technique during bronchoscopy can limit infectious risk. Principles of our
protocol included: 1) limiting the number of providers in the room, 2) minimizing aerosol generation by
with clamping the endotracheal tube and disconnecting the inspiratory limb of the ventilator during
manipulations, 3) minimizing cough by neuromuscular blockade or heavy sedation and instillation of
lidocaine into the tracheobronchial tree, and 4) use of a disposable bronchoscope. We also had a small
number of highly skilled providers (our IP team) performing a high number of the BALs, ensuring
adherence to protocol. Fortunately, most providers felt that the bronchoscopies following the protocol
were only slightly more difficult than routine ICU bronchoscopy. We suspect that other centers may have
similar protocols, and a more scientific exploration of techniques would be needed to comment on
protocol efficacy.
Our group has supported adhering to evidence-based critical care during the COVID-19
pandemic rather than making practice changes solely in response to uncertainties associated with the

COVID pandemic (21). Medical provider safety is of paramount importance and precluded relying on our
standard of care nonbronchoscopic BAL performed by respiratory therapists. However, our providers
already utilize BAL during their routine critical care practice, and were likely to be able to safely continue
that practice while using appropriate PPE and minimizing aerosolization. Our results demonstrate that
assumption was accurate.
Our study has several limitations. First, this is a retrospective survey of providers and their
recollection of practices. We did not directly pull exact bronchoscopy numbers and test results from the
electronic medical records so as to respect our colleagues’ privacy, and instead looked for voluntary
responses. However, collateral data suggests overestimation of bronchoscopy numbers is very unlikely.
Adherence to the modified bronchoscopy protocol was not monitored. We were not able to capture a
100% response rate for the survey but obtained results higher than most physician survey response rates
(22).
While serology testing was offered to all providers per hospital protocol, only a subset of
providers actually got tested. NP testing was performed ad hoc based upon symptoms or exposure. Since
neither form of testing was mandated across the survey cohort, both may in fact under-represent the true
infectious risk. It is also possible that asymptomatic infections were missed if providers did not seek
testing in a short time period after performing said procedures.
In summary, this is the first detailed report of infectious risks from BAL from a large-volume center
that routinely incorporates bronchoscopy as part of critical care for patients with COVID-19 respiratory
failure. While additional research is needed to inform the optimal use of invasive sampling of the lower
respiratory tract to improve outcomes for patients with COVID-19, our data suggest that BAL can be
routinely incorporated into the ICU care of these patients with minimal infectious risk to providers.

Supplementary 1: Survey

Title of Research Study: Provider safety during COVID-19 bronchoscopies
IRB Study Number: STU00213164, version 7-24-20
Principal Investigator: Sean Smith
Supported By: This research is supported by Divison of Pulmonary and Critical Care.
Key Information about this research study: The following is a short summary of this study to help you
decide whether to be a part of this study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of
bronchoscopists in COVID-19 patients. You will be asked to complete a survey on the number of
bronchoscopies you have performed on COVID patients, the number of COVID tests you have received,
and the results of your COVID testing. We expect that you will be in this research study for the duration
of this survey.
The primary risk of participation is potentially being identified based on how many bronchoscopies you
have performed and the small cohort of participants. The main benefit of participation is publicizing the
risks/safety of bronchoscopy on COVID patients. Why am I being asked to take part in this research
study?
We are asking you to take part in this research study because you have potentially bronched a COVID-19
patient.
How many people will be in this study? We expect about 40 people here will be in this research study.

Supplementary 2: NMH COVID-19 ICU Bronchoscopy protocol

Bronchoscopy in the COVID ICU will be performed for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, including, but
not limited to:
•

Diagnostic evaluation of newly intubated patient, including COVID rule-out testing

•

Evaluation of possible VAP or superimposed bacterial CAP

•

Airway clearance

Bronchoscopy can be performed at the discretion of the ICU attending, but the general policy will be that
off-hour bronchoscopy performed by a fellow without an attending should be limited to emergent
situations such as mucous plugging. The following protocol will be used for bronchoscopy and will be
performed by 1-2 member(s) of the IP service or the ICU attending. The ICU fellow will participate if
willing and available (per fellow’s preference).

Given the longer circuit break with NBBAL, these will not be performed on COVID-19 patients.

The nurse will help with printing order labels, pre-procedural sedation including administration of
neuromuscular blockade but then will leave the room.
RT may help with gathering equipment but does not need to be present in the room.

Role 1: primary bronchoscopist (fellow, attending, IP attending) – this person is responsible for assessing
the clinical situation, consenting the family, ensuring all necessary equipment are ready, ordering lab
tests, ensuring adequate sedation, performing the bronchoscopy, cleaning the equipment afterwards, and
ensuring samples delivered to the lab.

Role 2: secondary bronchoscopist (supervising IP attending or ICU attending or fellow) – this person will
assist the primary bronchoscopist, silence ventilator alarms, assist in circuit manipulation, instill saline for
lavage, withdraw BAL, and connect lukens trap.
