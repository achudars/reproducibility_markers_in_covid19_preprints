Introduction. The COVID-19 Healthcare Personnel Study (CHPS) was designed to assess and
mitigate adverse short and long-term physical and mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic
on New York’s health care workforce. Here we report selected baseline results.
Methods. Online survey of New York State physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants
registered with the New York State Department of Health. Survey-weighted descriptive results were
analyzed using frequencies, proportions, and means, with 95% confidence intervals. Odds ratios
were calculated for association using survey-weighted logistic regression .
Results. Approximately 51.5% (95% CI 49.1, 54.0) of the survey-weighted respondents reported
having worked directly or in close physical contact with COVID-19 patients. Of those tested for
COVID-19, 27.3% (95% CI 22.5, 32.2) were positive. Having symptoms consistent with COVID-19
was associated with reporting a subsequent positive COVID-19 test (OR=14.0, 95% CI 5.7, 34.7).
Over half of the respondents, (57.6%) reported a negative impact of the COVID-19 efforts on their
mental health. Respondents who indicated that they were redeployed or required to do different
functions than usual in response to COVID-19 were more likely to report negative mental health
impacts (OR=1.3, 95% CI 1.1, 1.6).
Conclusions. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York State in Spring 2020, more than
half of physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants included in this study responded to
the crisis, often at a cost to their physical and mental health and disruption to their lives.

Introduction
The sudden onslaught of the COVID-19 in 2020 pandemic placed severe demands on US
health systems and the health care workforce, especially in New York State (NYS) and New
York City (NYC), the American epicenter. Early in the course of the pandemic, hospitals ran the
risk of exhausting their supplies of ventilators, ICU beds, and personal protective equipment
(PPE); the capacity of the health care workforce to meet the added demand was equally
strained. In the late winter and early spring of 2020, NYS and New York City bore a
disproportional share of the burden, with approximately half of all confirmed cases in America.
NYS instituted a number of strategies to expand hospital capacity and the workforce: the
governor mandated that all hospitals increase bed capacity by 50%; specialized hospital
facilities were constructed in large convention spaces; efforts to purchase and obtain donated
PPE were accelerated, and; volunteer, retired, and student health care professionals were
enlisted to supplement the workforce. Hospitals and health systems explored ways of
repurposing and expanding their stock of critical equipment.
During Spring 2020, a period of extreme system stress, when the nature and context of health
care rapidly adapted and changed, the COVID-19 Healthcare Personnel Study (CHPS) was
launched to longitudinally assess and mitigate the adverse health impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic on the NYS health care workforce. Between 28 April and 30 June 2020, the height of
the pandemic in NYS, CHPS collaborators recruited members of multiple health care
professions across NYS to participate. Professions included physicians, nurses and nurse
practitioners, medical residents, physician assistants, and ancillary health professionals such as
respiratory therapists, paramedics, emergency medical technicians, visiting nurses, home health
care workers, and others. Participants were drawn from community-based settings, as well as
hospitals and other institutional settings.

Our initial goals were to help define the challenges and stressors experienced by healthcare
workers (HCW), to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their mental, physical, and
social health and that of their families, and to evaluate the role of interventions such as just-intime training, counseling and childcare services implemented to reduce adverse health
outcomes of the health care workforce and to facilitate their professional response to the
pandemic.
We present here initial results of CHPS, based on the first wave of responses from physicians,
nurse practitioners and physician assistants. We report key characteristics of respondents, their
exposures and risk factors, including regional distribution and type of practice, exposure to and
experience with treating COVID-19 patients, reported impact of the pandemic on health and
practice patterns, and association of treating COVID-19 patients with testing positive for SARSCoV2. In addition to establishing a baseline for longitudinal assessments of this important cohort
this report documents its impact on healthcare professionals during an uncharted period of
extreme stress.

Methods
On 28 April 2020, an invitation to participate in the CHPS survey was sent from the office of the
NYS Commissioner of Health to 103,103 physicians, 21,503 nurse practitioners and 14,503
physician assistants, representing all persons licensed to practice in the state, for a total of
139,109 emails. All physicians (licensed MD/DO) are required by law (Public Health Law
Section 2995-a, Education Law Section 6524) to have a NYS Health Commerce System (HCS)
account and maintain information related to practice and education via the Physician Profile
Application on the HCS. Other professions are not subject to this regulatory requirement. All
Health Commerce System (HCS) users, regardless of profession, are presented with their
contact information every six months and need to either verify that the information is correct or (
edit it. This baseline survey was closed to enrollment on 30 June 2020.
The survey was administered through REDCap, a secure web application managed by Data
Coordinating Center at the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) for building and
managing online surveys and databases.1 Data were downloaded and read into the R statistical
computing system,2 checked for outliers and cleaned. We used raking procedure to assign a
survey weight for each respondent to make the sample representative of the target population of
physicians, nurse practitioners and medical assistants in age, gender and geographic location
across 10 regions of New York State. 3 4 5 Raking used the population margins of age, race and
geographic location to create weights such that the weighted sample distributions of these
variables conform to their population distributions. Estimated extrapolations to population-level
frequencies and proportions of physicians, nurse practitioners and medical assistants by age,
gender and geographic locations were based on documentation from the Center for Health
Workforce Studies. 6, 7, 8, and the New York State Department of Education 9. In the case of
physician assistants, population statistics were supplemented with national-level data. 10

Statistical analyses consisted of survey-weighted counts, proportions, means, and 95%
confidence intervals using the R “survey” package.11 Odds ratios for association were calculated
using survey-weighted logistic regression models. A one-way ANOVA for the association of an
8-category clinical specialty variables (Primary Care, Pediatrics, Emergency Medicine, Critical
Care, Non-Surgical Specialties, Surgery, Behavioral Health, and Other) was conducted on nonweighted data. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) of Columbia
University Medical Center, the New York State Psychiatric Institute, the City University of New
York, and NYU School of Medicine.

Results
Descriptive Epidemiology
Of the 139,109 emails sent, 38,090 (27.4%) reached an intended recipient and were opened. Of
these, 2,076 physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants completed the survey, for
a response rate of 5.5%. More female physicians responded (49% female physicians in the
study sample vs 35% in the target population). Physicians responding to the survey were also
skewed older (32% sample older than 60 vs 23% population). Physicians from upstate regions
were represented slightly more than downstate regions. After the raking procedure, the
weighted sample more closely approximated the physicians target population in age, gender
and geographic distribution. (Table 1) Similar adjustments were seen with the Nurse Practitioner
and Physician Assistant groups. After raking, the survey-weighted sample equaled a target
population of 137,710 (95% CI 134422, 140999) physicians, nurse practitioners and physician
assistants licensed in New York State. Our weighted sample had a mean age of 50.4 (95% CI
49.9, 51.0), of whom 46.1% (95% CI 43.7, 48.5) were female. (Table 2)
The largest survey-weighted proportion of respondents (41.6%) practiced in New York City,
followed by Long Island (19.3%), and the Hudson Valley (11.7%). (Table 3) A survey-weighted
proportion of 68.7% (95% CI 66.6, 70.9) of all respondents usually practiced in the New York
City Metro area (5 boroughs of New York City, Nassau, Suffolk, Rockland, and Westchester
Counties), and 67.7% (95% CI 65.5, 69.9) were practicing in the NYC Metro area at the time
they completed the survey.
A large majority of respondents had more than 5 years of practice experience, with nearly 27%
(95% CI 29.08, 29.12) in practice for 25 years or more. The largest proportion of respondents
(46.9%, 95% CI 46.88, 46.92) reported working in private practice or for a non-academic not for
profit institution; 46.5% (95% CI 44.1, 49.0) of respondents practiced primarily in a hospital

setting. (Table 4) The largest proportion of respondents (30% 95% CI 30.18, 30.22) practiced in
primary care. (Table 5)
Exposure to COVID-19 and Changes in Practice Patterns
A survey-weighted 51.5% (95% CI 49.1, 54.0) or an estimated survey-weighted frequency of
69,586 (95% CI 65,572, 73,599) of NYS physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants
reported having worked directly or in close physical contact with COVID-19 patients. Nearly a
quarter of all respondents (24.1%; 95% CI 21.6, 26.5) reported changing their living
arrangements because of concern about exposure to COVID-19. An estimated survey-weighted
frequency of 1,159 (95% CI 586, 1,733) NYS MD/NP/PA’s came out of retirement to work on the
COVID-19 response.
A survey-weighted one third (32.8%, 95% CI 30.5, 35.1) of respondents indicated that they were
required to perform functions different than their usual practice in response to COVID-19. Of
these, more than half (51.8%, 95% CI 45.9, 57.8) felt their new work setting placed them at
increased risk for contracting COVID-19.
Willingness to Respond and Concerns
A large survey-weighted proportion of respondents (43.3%; 95% CI 40.9, 45.8) reported
reluctance to work directly with COVID-19 patients. The primary reasons for reluctance were
fear of infecting oneself and fear of infecting others. (Table 6) A large survey-weighted
proportion of respondents (44.5%; 95% CI 42.1, 47.0) had children under the age of 18, the
large majority of whom (97.2%; 95% CI 96.5, 98.9) were living at home. While a surveyweighted majority of respondents (70.8%; 95% CI 68.6, 73.0) had parents, grandparents or
other relatives over the age of 70, only 8.4% of them (95% CI 6.7, 10.0) had persons over the
age of 70 living at home with them.

Over a third of survey-weighted respondents (37.7%, 95% CI = 37.63, 37.70) reported
shortages of N95 masks, and over half (51.5%, 95% CI= 48.6, 54.1) reported having had to reuse disposable personal protective equipment in a manner which seemed unsafe.
Approximately 22.8% (22.73, 22.80) reported shortages of test kits, and nearly a fifth (19.5%,
95% CI = 19.48 19.52) reported shortages of personnel. A smaller proportion reported
shortages of ventilators (2%, 95% CI = 1.98 2.0) or beds (4.4%, 95% CI = 4.4, 4.42).
COVID-19 Symptoms and Infections
Approximately 30% (95% CI 27.9, 32.5) of respondents reported symptoms consistent with
possible COVID-19 infection (fever greater than 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit; persistent cough;
persistent sore throat; headaches). A survey-weighted estimate of 37,759 (95% CI 34,498,
41,021) or 28.0% (95% CI 25.7, 30.3) NYS physicians, nurse practitioners and physician
assistants attempted to obtain a test for COVID-19. Of these, an estimated 28,992 (95% CI
26105, 31877) or 21.4% (95% CI 19,4, 23.5) were able to obtain a test. Of these, a surveyweighted estimate of 7,876 (95% CI 6276, 9475) tested positive for a survey-weighted
proportion of positive tests of 27.3% (95% CI 22.5, 32.2). Reporting symptoms consistent with
COVID-19 was strongly associated with reporting a positive test (OR=14.0, 95% CI 5.7, 34.7).
There was no statistically significant association between reporting working directly with COVID
patients and reporting a positive test (OR=1.1, 95% CI 0.6, 1.9). Nor was there any statistically
significant difference in a one-way ANOVA between clinical specialties among those reporting a
positive COVID-19 test (p-value = 0.135).

Mental Health Impacts
Well over half of the respondents, (57.6%) reported a negative impact on their mental health as
a result of COVID-19 efforts, and 43% felt it had negatively impacted personal relationships. A
third of those reporting a negative impact felt it had affected their physical health and/or ability to
work. (Table 7) There was no statistically significant association between working directly with
COVID patients and negative mental health impacts (OR=0.7, 95% CI 0.4, 1.2). Respondents
who indicated that they were redeployed or required to perform different functions in response
to COVID-19 were more likely to report negative mental health impacts (OR=1.3, 95% CI 1.1,
1.6) There was a very similar association between reporting a hospital-based practice and
reporting mental health symptoms (OR=1.3, 95% CI 1.1, 1.6). Having symptoms consistent with
COVID-19 was associated with an adverse effect on mental health (OR=1.7, 95% CI 1.3, 2.1).

Discussion
If the experience of New York State HCWs serves as a bellwether for the United States in the
months and perhaps years to come, the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to be an
unprecedented healthcare and public health challenge. We find that the COVID-19 pandemic
increased the risk of infection, adversely impacted mental health and disrupted lives of HCWs.
Despite this, over half of all physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants in this
cohort provided direct patient care, indicating that they rose to the challenge despite such risks.
A third changed from their usual practice or specialty, and a considerable number came out of
retirement to meet the needs of their fellow New Yorkers.
The literature on HCWs responses to previous epidemics is characterized by conflicting
emotions of duty and fear. These findings are consistent with results of a study of 83 French
HCWs regarding their state of preparedness to treat Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever in 2015, the
majority of whom (73%) wanted to be “personally involved” in patient care.12 Although the large
majority (91%) of a group of Saudi Arabian nurses reported an “ethical duty” to respond to an
outbreak of MERS-CoV outbreak that occurred in Jeddah, 96% “felt nervous and scared", and
92% had thought of quitting.13
Interpersonal and mental health issues may prove to be among the most important impacts of
COVID-19 on HCWs. The well-publicized suicide of an emergency physician in New York City
during the fielding of this survey brought this issue to the fore.14 Our study supports early reports
from China that “a considerable proportion of health care workers (treating COVID-19 patients)
reported experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress”, 15 as well as a
survey of Saudi HCWs who responded to the 2014 MERS outbreak in which "almost two thirds
reported having psychological problems”16. Although we did not find an association of direct
COVID-19 patient care with symptoms of mental health distress, we did find that redeployment

to non-familiar duties was associated with adverse mental health outcomes. Training and
clinical knowledge may be key factors in addressing HCW concerns about responding to a
pandemic.17 18 19
The literature on the mental health effects of COVID-19 on HCWs remains nascent, but we can
look to research on the effect SARS in the early 2000s and more recent MERS-CoV outbreaks
as a guide. A 2003 survey of 769 Canadian HCWs found "higher levels of burnout (p = 0.019),
psychological distress (p<0.001), and posttraumatic stress (p<0.001)" among those who had
treated SARS patients compared to those who did not, one to two years after the outbreak.20 In
an overview of the experience of HCWs responding to the Toronto SARS outbreak in 2003, the
investigators "estimated that a high degree of distress was experienced by 29-35% of hospital
workers." They concluded there were "Three categories of contributory factors...being a nurse,
having contact with SARS patients and having children."21
Concern for children and childcare is a frequent issue. One metanalysis concluded that
"Respondents living with children or having childcare obligations were one-third less likely to be
willing to work compared with those without these obligations."17 In a series of studies of the
2003 SARS epidemic in Canada, Canadian HCW’s who developed SARS chiefly expressed
concern about “the effects of quarantine and contagion on family members and friends.”22 It is
vitally important to “alleviate the concerns and fears of HCWs and remove potential barriers to
working” during a pandemic.23 A 2009 study addressing this issue concluded that among the
most important factors were “being ill, transportation, childcare (and) concern for family.”24 Our
study results are consistent with these findings from studies of these earlier outbreaks. Fully two
thirds of our respondents who expressed reluctance in treating COVID-19 patients cited fear of
infecting themselves or others as the primary reason.
There is evidence supporting specific measures to address distress among HCWs responding
to pandemics. Among helpful factors reported by HCWs in coping with a MERS-CoV outbreak

that occurred in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia were a "Positive attitude from colleagues in your
department" and financial compensation.13 The authors of a series of studies of HCW attitudes
toward responding to SARS concluded that "Reducing pandemic-related stress may best be
accomplished through interventions designed to enhance resilience in psychologically healthy
people," by providing psychological first aid, institutional training, support and leadership.25 The
same authors also pointed to the importance of practical and tangible support,21 as well as the
potential utility of computer-based tools to improve confidence and self-efficacy.26
Our data support a high risk of contracting COVID-19 among HCWs carrying out their
professional responsibilities, and describe important and meaningful challenges like a lack of
personal protective equipment that contributed to that risk.27 Our study’s s results indicate that
accessing a test for SARS-Cov2 at the height of the pandemic in NYS was difficult for clinicians.
A large proportion of HCWs who did access a test, tested positive, with an alarming 27%
reported test positivity rate. A recent study reports a nearly 12-fold increased risk of infection for
HCW compared to the general population, but comparisons and estimates of relative risk based
on our data are difficult. During a similar time period the overall NYS positivity rate was
approximately 40%,28 although tests for SARS CoV-2 in NYS were in short supply29 and often
reserved for the sickest patients, likely increasing the general positivity rate.
Our study is subject to a number of important limitations. These results apply narrowly to
physicians and advanced practice clinicians. The demographics of this group differ from other
groups demonstrated to be at increased risk of COVID-19, including Blacks/African Americans
who make up a large proportion of persons providing non-medical direct services to COVID-19
patients in NYC, but may not be well represented among physicians and advanced practice
clinicians.30 This is an area in which additional results from the CHPS addressing nursing and
non-medical providers can provide insights.

While response rate was low, it was based on a single-request and is in line with recent studies
of physicians.31 Low response rates are increasingly a feature of modern surveys, and less than
optimal response rates are not necessarily indicative of poor survey quality or bias; in some
instances lower response rates have been associated with less bias.32
We utilized statistical procedure to align our survey-adjusted sample with important
demographics of the target population, 6,7,8,9,10 but our sample may be biased. One or more
additional factors associated with the domains we measured may have affected the likelihood of
responding to the survey, and could have biased the results. The direction of that bias is
difficult to discern. Respondents may have been more severely impacted by the pandemic and
thus more motivated to respond than a representative population, in which case our results may
be overestimated. Alternatively, during a time when much activity in the state, including routine
patient care, had been curtailed there may have been more responses from clinicians less
impacted than those healthcare workers who were busier providing direct patient care to
COVID-19 patients.
Conclusion
Our study adds to increasing evidence on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U. S.
healthcare workforce. Our study finds that at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York
State in early 2020, the majority of physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants
responded, often having to change their usual practice, and at a cost of physical and mental
health and disruption to their lives. Future research should address the evolution of these
impacts to facilitate the ability and willingness of HCWs to respond to the pandemic, expanding
the target population to include other workers in the healthcare workforce, understanding the
ways that the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting clinical decision-making and practice behavior,
and documenting the impact of altered standards of care and triage decisions on vulnerable and
socially marginalized groups.
