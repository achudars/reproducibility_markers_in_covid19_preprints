Abstract
Phylogeny construction can help to reveal evolutionary relatedness among
molecular sequences. The spike (S) gene of SARS-CoV-2 is the subject of an immune
selective pressure which increases the variability in such region. This study aimed
to identify mutations in the S gene among SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected in the
Middle East and North Africa (MENA), focusing on the D614G mutation, that has
a presumed fitness advantage. Another aim was to analyze the S gene sequences
phylogenetically. The SARS-CoV-2 S gene sequences collected in the MENA were
retrieved from the GISAID public database, together with its metadata. Mutation
analysis was conducted in Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software.
Phylogenetic analysis was done using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian
methods. A total of 553 MENA sequences were analyzed and the most frequent S
gene mutations included: D614G=435, Q677H=8, and V6F=5. A significant increase
in the proportion of D614G was noticed from (63.0%) in February 2020, to (98.5%)
in June 2020 (p<0.001). Two large phylogenetic clusters were identified via ML
analysis, which showed an evidence of inter-country mixing of sequences, which
dated back to February 8, 2020 and March 15, 2020 (median estimates). The mean
evolutionary rate for SARS-CoV-2 was about 6.5 × 10-3 substitutions/site/year
based on large clusters’ Bayesian analyses. The D614G mutation appeared to be
taking over the COVID-19 infections in the MENA. Bayesian analysis suggested
that SARS-CoV-2 might have been circulating in MENA earlier than previously
reported.

Introduction
Members of Coronaviridae family of viruses have started to gain a substantial
interest due to their potential role as causative agents of emerging infections in
humans (Fehr and Perlman, 2015). This was manifested by the 2002-2003 SARS
outbreak, 2012 MERS outbreak, and the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic, the first documented coronavirus pandemic, which can be viewed as
the full-blown consequence of coronavirus threat (Cherry and Krogstad, 2004; Liu et
al., 2020; Lu and Liu, 2012; Peiris et al., 2003).
The causative agent of this unprecedented pandemic is an enveloped RNA
virus of the subfamily Betacoronavirinae (Liu et al., 2020). Similar to other RNA
viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is
presumed to have a relatively high mutation rate that is mostly related to its RNAdependent RNA polymerase, with minimal proofreading activity (Duffy et al., 2008;
Sevajol et al., 2014). In addition, the high frequency of recombination in
coronaviruses augments its genetic diversity and its ability of cross-species
transmission (Su et al., 2016; Woo et al., 2009).
The aforementioned features are accompanied by ubiquitous presence of
coronaviruses in various animal reservoirs (Guan et al., 2003). Thus, cross-species
transmission, including spread to humans seems an inevitable outcome (Graham
and Baric, 2010; Woo et al., 2009). This is mainly related to human, ecologic and
economic factors, which explain the increased frequency of zoonosis (Delabouglise
et al., 2017; Karesh et al., 2012; Morse et al., 2012).
The transcripts of SARS-CoV-2 include nine sub-genomic RNAs, of which one
structural protein, spike glycoprotein, being responsible for attachment of the virus
to its cellular receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [ACE2]) (Fehr and
Perlman, 2015). Host proteases’ cleavage of the spike glycoprotein is essential for
virion entry into the target cells (Ou et al., 2020). The receptor-binding domain (RBD)
in the S1 subunit binds ACE2 and facilitates fusion with host cell membrane (Tai et
al., 2020). For the S2 domain of the spike glycoprotein, its function facilitates fusion
of the viral and host cell membranes (Xia et al., 2020).

Studying the SARS-CoV-2 S gene attracts a special attention, particularly from
an immunologic and evolutionary points of view (Chen et al., 2020; Korber et al.,
2020; Robson, 2020). The spike gene is the subject of an immune selective pressure,
and antibodies against its protein product can inhibit the viral entry into the target
cells (Korber et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020). The selective forces directed against the
S gene can increase genetic variability in the region, which can be used to infer the
evolutionary relationships between viral sequences in a shorter time, compared to
use of less variable regions (e.g. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRp)),
where mutations occur, but appear to be more costly (Duffy et al., 2008; Moya et al.,
2004; Pachetti et al., 2020; Robson, 2020).
Genetic variability in the S gene can be demonstrated by continuous emergence
of mutations, that were reported at a global level (Korber et al., 2020). Some of these
mutations appeared to have a significant epidemiologic value, with the replacement
of aspartic acid by glycine at position 614 of the spike glycoprotein (D614G), which
is associated with a higher viral shedding and increased infectivity (Korber et al.,
2020; Maitra et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). This mutation currently appears to be
dominating the pandemic (Grubaugh et al., 2020). However, the clinical effect of such
mutation is yet to be fully determined (Eaaswarkhanth et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020b;
Korber et al., 2020). Other mutations in the S gene have also been reported, with the
most frequent including: D936Y/H, P1263L, and L5F (Korber et al., 2020; Lokman et
al., 2020).
Similar to other RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be the subject of phylogenetic
analysis due to its high evolutionary rate, and the application of molecular clock
analysis might be of value to determine the timing of introductions of large clusters
that imply networks of transmission (Duffy et al., 2008; Forster et al., 2020; Pybus and
Rambaut, 2009). State-of-the-art methods for phylogeny construction include
maximum likelihood and Bayesian tools (Anisimova et al., 2013).
The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region include the following 19
countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya,
Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), Sudan, Syria,
Tunisia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Yemen. Countries of the MENA were

affected early on during the course of COVID-19 pandemic, with an overwhelming
number of cases in some countries (e.g. Iran) (Karamouzian and Madani, 2020;
Sawaya et al., 2020). The first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the MENA dated back
to February 2020 and were reported in UAE, Iran, and Egypt (Daw et al., 2020;
Karamouzian and Madani, 2020; Mehtar et al., 2020). The total number of diagnosed
cases of COVID-19 in the MENA exceeded 1,175,000 with more than 32,000 deaths
reported as a result of the disease, as of July 25, 2020 (Worldometer, 2020).
Special attention to COVID-19 infections is needed in the countries of the MENA
region, where political and economic factors might lead to devastating effects on the
countries affected by the current pandemic (Karamouzian and Madani, 2020;
Sawaya et al., 2020). Particular attention should be paid to countries like Yemen,
Syria and Libya, where the ongoing instabilities can result in underreporting of
COVID-19 cases and heavy burden on their health-care systems (Da'ar et al., 2020;
Daw, 2020; Karamouzian and Madani, 2020; Sawaya et al., 2020).
The aims of this study included an attempt to phylogenetically analyze S gene
sequences and to analyze the spike gene mutation patterns in the MENA region. In
addition, we aimed to characterize the temporal changes of D614G mutation spread
in the region.

Materials and Methods
Compilation of the MENA SARS-CoV-2 dataset
All SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the MENA countries, were retrieved from the
global science initiative and primary source for genomic data of influenza viruses
(GISAID) (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017). We also downloaded the following
sequence metadata if available: date of sequence collection, age, gender, city of
collection together with country of sequence collection. The sequences were then
aligned to the reference SARS-CoV-2 sequence (accession number: NC_045512) and
alignment was conducted using multiple alignment program for amino acid or
nucleotide sequences (MAFFT v.7) (Rozewicki et al., 2019). The MENA sequences
that did not contain the complete S region were filtered out. In addition, we removed
the sequences that contained indels, the nucleotide ambiguity (N); while other
ambiguities were retained. The sequences that contained stop codons were removed
as well. Each sequence header was also edited to include data in the following order:
country of collection, collection date in days starting from January 5, 2020 (the date
of reference sequence collection), city, accession number, gender, and age. The final
dataset included 553 MENA S nucleotide sequences that were collected during
January 2020 until June 2020.
Detection of the S gene mutations
Analysis of the full MENA SARS-CoV-2 S gene sequences was conducted in
Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software (MEGA6) (Tamura et al., 2013).
Visual inspection of the aligned MENA amino acid sequences was done, and
mutations were identified based on comparison to the reference SARS-CoV-2
sequence (accession number: NC_045512), which was considered as the wild-type.
Amino acids that were translated from codons containing ambiguous bases (e.g. R,
Y), were excluded from mutation analysis.
Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis
The whole MENA S gene dataset was analyzed phylogenetically using the
maximum likelihood (ML) approach in PhyML v3, with selection of the best
nucleotide substitution model using Smart Model Selection (SMS), and depending

on Akaike Information Criterion (AIK) (Guindon and Gascuel, 2003; Lefort et al.,
2017). The model which yielded the smallest AIC was the general time-reversible
plus invariant sites (GTR + I) nucleotide substitution model with an estimated
proportion of invariable sites of 0.625. The estimation of nodal support in the ML
tree was based on the approximate Likelihood Ratio Test Shimodaira-Hasegawa like
(aLRT-SH) with 0.90 as the statistical significance level (Anisimova et al., 2011). The
ML analysis was repeated ten times and the ML tree with the highest likelihood was
retained for final analysis, and determination of the MENA phylogenetic clusters
was done by examining the ML tree from root to tips looking for branches with
aLRT-SH ≥ 0.90, with large clusters having ≥ 15 sequences.
Bayesian estimation of time to most recent common ancestors (tMRCAs) of the
large MENA phylogenetic clusters
For the large phylogenetic clusters (containing ≥ 15 sequences and identified
using ML analysis), tMRCAs were estimated using the Bayesian Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) method implemented in BEAST v1.8.4 (Drummond et al.,
2012). Bayesian analysis parameters included: Hasegawa–Kishono–Yano (HKY)
nucleotide substitution model with discrete gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity,
uncorrelated relaxed clock model with a normally-distributed rate prior (initial and
mean values of 0.0068, standard deviation=0.0008), and a Bayesian skyline tree
density model (Tang et al., 2020). For each large phylogenetic cluster, one run with
200 million chain length was performed. Samples of trees and parameters were
collected every 20,000 steps after discarding a burn-in of 20%, and convergence was
analyzed in Tracer v1.6.0 (Rambaut et al., 2015). The runs were accepted based on
effective sample sizes (ESS) of ≥200 and convergence in the trace file. The maximum
clade credibility (MCC) trees were assembled using TreeAnnotator in BEAST and
were visualized using FigTree (Rambaut, 2012).
Statistical analysis
Chi-squared test (χ2 test) was used to detect differences between the D614 and
D614G groups in relation to gender and region (Middle East vs. North Africa).
Mann-Whitney U test (M-W) was used to assess the difference between the D614
and D614G groups in relation to age. Linear-by-linear test for association (LBL) was

SARS-CoV-2 S gene mutations detected in the MENA
A total 55 unique non-synonymous mutations in the S gene were detected as
compared to the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome. Eight mutations were identified in
spike receptor binding domain (SRD), compared to 21 mutations in S2 glycoprotein
domain and 26 in other S regions. The most frequent mutation detected in the whole
S region was D614G (n=435), followed by Q677H (n=8), and V6F (n=5). The majority
of mutations were detected sporadically (n=43, 78.2%, Table 2). The highest number
of unique S gene mutations (including D614G) was noticed in Oman (n=16),
followed by Egypt (n=15), Bahrain (n=9), and KSA (n=6, Table 2).

Variables associated with a higher prevalence of D614G mutation
Analysis of the two variants of S gene (D614 vs. D614G) showed a higher
prevalence of D614G in North Africa compared to the Middle East (95.0% vs. 73.7%,
p<0.001; χ2 test). In addition, a higher prevalence of D614G variant was noticed in
the second half of the study period (April, May and June vs. January, February and
March, 90.7% vs. 59.5%, p<0.001; χ2 test). However, no statistical difference was
noticed upon comparing the two variants based on age (p=0.195; M-W), age group
(less than 40 years vs. more than or equal to 40 years, p=0.176; χ2 test), or gender
(p=0.644; χ2 test). Analysis of the D614G mutant per country showed its presence in
all MENA countries included in the study with exception of Iran and Qatar (Figure
1). In addition, no statistical difference was found in analysis per country upon
comparing the two variants based on age, age group, or gender.

Temporal trend of D614G mutant spread in the MENA
Analysis of temporal trend of spread of the D614G mutant of SARS-CoV-2
in the whole MENA region as a single unit revealed an increasing prevalence of
D614G from 63.0% in January 2020 to reach 98.5% in June 2020 (p<0.001; LBL,
Figure 2). The same pattern was detected upon comparing the first three months
of 2020, compared to April, May and June 2020 (59.5% vs. 90.7%; p<0.001; χ2

Maximum likelihood phyloegentic tree of MENA S gene sequences
To assess the possible presence of phylogenetic clusters in the MENA, ML
analysis was conducted. The constructed ML tree showed a star-shaped pattern
with short internal branches and long terminal branches (Figure 3). A total of 13
phylogenetic clusters (aLRT-SH ≥ 0.9) were determined; eight of which included
sequences from a single MENA country and five clusters contained sequences
collected in more than one MENA country (Appendix S2). Five clusters
contained two sequences, and two large clusters were identified, each
containing 26 MENA sequences. The highest percentage of clustering sequences
was found in Iran (n=3/5, 60.0%), followed by KSA (n=39/149, 27.9%), and
Tunisia (n=2/8, 25.0%, Figure 4). The overall proportion of phylogenetic
clustering was 15.4% (n=85/553).

Bayesian analysis of the largest MENA phylogenetic clusters
Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was conducted on the two large clusters
identified previously using the ML approach. One Egyptian sequence was
removed from each cluster due to the lack of exact collection date. This resulted
in analysis of two clusters, each containing 25 sequences. The first cluster
contained 14 Saudi sequences, ten Omani sequences and a single Egyptian
sequence, with a range of sequence collection between February 13 and May 11.
The median estimate for tMRCA for this cluster having the D614G mutation was
February 8, 2020 (95% highest posterior density interval [HPD]: October 19,
2019–February 13, 2020, Figure 5). For the second cluster (D614) with 20 Saudi
sequences, three Egyptian sequences and two Tunisian sequences, the estimated
median tMRCA was March 15, 2020 (95% HPD: February 21, 2020–March 15,
2020). The mean evolutionary rate estimated by molecular clock analysis was

Discussion
In this study, phylogenetic analysis tools were utilized to assess origins, spread
and mutations of SRAS-CoV-2 in the MENA. Phylogeny construction can help to
formulate hypotheses regarding the spread of certain taxa having a common origin
(Ciccozzi et al., 2019; Pybus and Rambaut, 2009). In addition, molecular clock
analysis can help to establish a timeline for origins of monophyletic clades (Jenkins
et al., 2002; Nasir and Caetano-Anolles, 2015). Phylogenetic analysis of the MENA S
gene SARS-CoV-2 sequences showed a relatively low level of phylogenetic
clustering (15%), which hints to a large number of virus introductions into the
region. In addition, molecular clock analysis suggests an early introduction of the
virus into the MENA which might have been circulating in the region from early
February 2020 or even earlier, with subsequent spread into large networks of virus
transmission. This estimate of an early virus introduction is supported by the close
proximity in time of official reporting of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the region
(Karamouzian and Madani, 2020).
In this study, no evidence of distinct SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants was found.
Plausible explanations might be related to the use of sub-genomic part of the genome
(the S gene) rather than utilizing the whole genome. The rationale behind selecting
the S region was for two reasons: first, the variability of this region is expected to be
higher than other parts of the genome (e.g. RdRp, where mutations are more costly)
(Agostini et al., 2018; Shannon et al., 2020). Second, mutations in the S gene can have
significant impact particularly for vaccine development and utility of neutralizing
antibodies (Lokman et al., 2020). The absence of distinct SARS-CoV-2 genetic
variants in this study does not provide a conclusive evidence of its genuine absence
from the region. These two genetic variants (named L and S lineages) were reported
previously, however, a recent report by MacLean et al. carefully discussed the
potential pitfalls of such premature conclusions (MacLean et al., 2020; Tang et al.,
2020).
For the estimated evolutionary rate of the two large MENA clusters identified
in this study, we based the rate prior selection on the previous finding by (Giovanetti
et al., 2020). This estimate appears higher than other estimates for SARS-CoV-2 and
16

should be interpreted with caution based on our selection of a strong prior.
However, the rate estimate might appear plausible, since it represents the S gene,
rather than the whole genome. For ML analysis, the MENA sequences yielded a starlike phylogeny suggesting a recent growing epidemic (Colijn and Plazzotta, 2018).
The major result of this study was the demonstration of a temporal shift of
SARS-CoV-2 from D614 into D614G variant, which dominated the most recent
sequences collected in the region. Such trend was revealed at the global level by
Korber et al., and our results indicated a similar pattern in the MENA (Korber et al.,
2020). In the aforementioned comprehensive study, Korber et al. estimated the global
prevalence of D614G at 71.0%, whereas our estimate in the MENA was 78.7%, which
appears reasonable, bearing in mind the protracted duration of sequence collection
in this study. The explanation for such an observation is most likely related to the
association of D614G with a higher viral load and subsequent higher quantities of
the virus shed by infected individuals, which increases the likelihood of infection by
such a mutant, although an early founder effect of this variant cannot be ruled out
(Deng et al., 2020; Farkas et al., 2020; Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020).
Whether this variant can have an effect on severity and outcome of COVID-19 is yet
to be fully determined (Becerra-Flores and Cardozo, 2020; Eaaswarkhanth et al.,
2020; Korber et al., 2020). This mutation appeared in all MENA countries, except in
Qatar and Iran, which might be related to the low number of sequences from these
two countries that were found in GISAID, and the early time of sequence collection
(less than 10 sequences from each country were found, dating back to March, 2020).
The emergence of D614G and its increasing prevalence have been reported by
several published papers and preprints including a report from North Africa by
Laamarti et al., albeit with a fewer number of sequences than the one analyzed in the
current study (Gong et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020b; Laamarti et al., 2020; Maitra et al.,
2020).
Other mutations that were found in the study included Q677H (found only in
Egypt), and L5F found in three different countries (Oman, Egypt, and Morocco). The
L5F mutation is located in the signal peptide domain of the spike glycoprotein and
might be related to recurring sequencing errors (Korber et al., 2020; N. De Maio,
17

2020). Nevertheless, its appearance in different studies warrants further
investigation to determine its significance (Korber et al., 2020). The functional
importance of Q677H has not been determined yet despite a previous report
describing its occurrence (Kim et al., 2020a).
Limitations of this study should be clearly stated and taken into consideration.
The most obvious caveat in the study was sampling bias. In spite of reporting
COVID-19 in all MENA countries, the following countries did not have S sequences
submitted to GISAID: Syria, Libya, Yemen, Sudan and Palestine (Iraq had partial
sequences that did not include the S gene). In addition, bias was observed for timing
of sequence collection. Furthermore, only two countries (Oman and KSA) had more
than 100 sequences available for analysis. Another point that should be considered
is related to the molecular clock analysis, where we used a strong informative prior
which may have affected our tMRCA estimates for dating the origins of the two large
phylogenetic clusters. Sequencing errors should also be taken into account, which
can partly explain some sporadic mutations that were found in this study.

Conclusions
In the current study, we demonstrated that the D614G variant of SARS-CoV-2
appears to be taking over COVID-19 epidemic in the MENA, similar to what have
been reported in other regions around the globe. Local transmission of SARS-CoV2 might have been established earlier than previously thought, and this illustrates
the importance of vigilant surveillance in such conditions of outbreaks by novel
viruses. The mutational patterns of SARS-CoV-2 should be closely monitored as the
virus seems to be heading into an endemicity in the human population, particularly
in relation to mutations’ potential impact on passive and active immunization.
