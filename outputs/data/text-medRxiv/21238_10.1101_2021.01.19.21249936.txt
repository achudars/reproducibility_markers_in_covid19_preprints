Abstract
In Situation Report #3 and 39 days before declaring COVID-19 a pandemic, the WHO declared a -19 infodemicṪhe volume of coronavirus tweets was far too great for one to find accurate or reliable information.
Healthcare workers were flooded with which drowned the of valuable COVID-19 information. To combat
the infodemic, physicians created healthcare-specific micro-communities to share scientific information with
other providers. We analyzed the content of eight physician-created communities and categorized each message in one of five domains. We coded 1) an application programming interface to download tweets and their
metadata in JavaScript Object Notation and 2) a reading algorithm using visual basic application in Excel to
categorize the content. We superimposed the publication date of each tweet into a timeline of key pandemic
events. Finally, we created NephTwitterArchive.com to help healthcare workers find COVID-19-related signal
tweets when treating patients. We collected 21071 tweets from the eight hashtags studied. Only 9051 tweets
were considered signal: tweets categorized into both a domain and subdomain. There was a trend towards
fewer signal tweets as the pandemic progressed, with a daily median of 22% (IQR 0-42%. The most popular
subdomain in Prevention was PPE (2448 signal tweets). In Therapeutics, Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine
wwo Azithromycin and Mechanical Ventilation were the most popular subdomains. During the active Infodemic phase (Days 0 to 49), a total of 2021 searches were completed in NephTwitterArchive.com, which was
a 26% increase from the same time period before the pandemic was declared (Days -50 to -1). The COVID-19
Infodemic indicates that future endeavors must be undertaken to eliminate noise and elevate signal in all aspects of scientific discourse on Twitter. In the absence of any algorithm-based strategy, healthcare providers
will be le� with the nearly impossible task of manually finding high-quality tweets from amongst a tidal wave
of noise.

Medical professionals are increasingly using Twitter to share scientific information with each other
(1-3). Healthcare providers in many medical specialties are using Twitter to broadcast cases, conduct
journal clubs, and share scientific information presented at their respective meetings (1-5). However,
not all of this information is accurate, credible, and/or supported by scientific evidence (noise
tweets) (6-7). Physician-learners have a di�icult time identifying highly educational tweets (signal
tweets) because the quality of scientific information created and shared through Twitter is variable.
This di�iculty worsens every year as the total number of tweets authored or retweeted by physicians
increases (8). To our knowledge, there has not been a concerted e�ort to help physicians eliminate
noise and elevate signal tweets.
Perhaps with great foresight, the World Health Organization (WHO) identified the problem of
finding signal tweets about the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly thirty-nine days prior to declaring
COVID-19 a pandemic (2 February 2020), the WHO declared a “COVID-19 Infodemic” (9). WHO
leaders predicted that the volume of COVID-19-related tweets would be so great that high quality
tweets about the disease/pandemic would be buried under an avalanche of lower/poor quality
ones (noise). To combat the COVID-19 Infodemic, the WHO committed itself to tweeting the most
accurate and evidence-based information about COVID-19 through its o�icial Twitter accounts (9).
The Organization did not commit to relaying high-quality information from sources other than

itself.
This commitment, while admirable, neglected the physician social media community that has, for
years, shared credible and evidence-based scientific information through Twitter (1-5). Beginning
on the day of the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic (Day 0; 11 March 2020) we undertook an
initiative to a) identify high quality tweets regarding COVID-19 from various physician communities,
b) categorize these tweets, and c) archive the most informative of these tweets for future searches.
Our objective was to eliminate noise and elevate signal tweets related to COVID-19 and provide
easy access to the most educational tweets for medical professionals who were searching for
information.

Methods

We identified COVID-19-related tweets from Days 0-199 (11 March to 27 September 2020) from
eight physician-specific hashtags established by various members of the physician social media
community (10). These hashtags were: #, #4rheum, #4MD, #4MDs, #2, #4MD, #4MDs, and #19Kidney.
While physicians from Nephrology, Rheumatology, and Internal Medicine created these hashtags,
anyone could read and post within them. The hashtags were created on Days 0 or 1 of the pandemic.
They were established to share medical information about COVID-19 with the scientific community
but their use was unrestricted and unregulated. We used an application programming interface
coded in JavaScript to download the tweets (and its associated metadata) every hour during
the study period. All tweets were translated into English using Google Translate. We stored the
translated tweets in Microso� Excel and categorized each into one of five domains and one of 84
subdomains. The five domains were: Diagnostics, Pathophysiology, Prevention, Symptoms, and
Therapeutics. The 84 subdomains are listed in Table 1.
Tweets that could not be categorized into a domain and subdomain were considered noise. The
remaining signal tweets were collected and analyzed for their information density. We analyzed
the metadata of each signal tweet to identify those that contained an image(s) and/or a URL linking
to an external source. Such tweets were designated as information density signal tweets and were
archived in an open-access, searchable, online repository that we created using Google Data Studio.
The repository can be accessed at NephTwitterArchive.com. We measured the number of completed
searches performed in the archive to gauge provider interest and/or need for COVID-19-related
information prior to and a�er the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic (Day 0). A completed search
was registered when the provider satisfied four criteria: a) input a query AND b) executed the search
AND c) was presented with results AND d) clicked on at least one link to the primary tweet. To
encourage use of the Archive, we advertised its existence on Twitter and maintained user anonymity
by not collecting user-specific data such as name, location, or provider type.

Results

During the first 200 days of the pandemic we collected 21071 tweets from the eight physicianestablished hashtags studied. Only 9051 (43% tweets were considered signal: tweets categorized
into both a domain and subdomain. There was a trend towards fewer and fewer signal tweets as
the pandemic progressed, with a daily median of 22% (IQR 0-42% (FIGURE 1). The domains with
the most tweets were Prevention (2915 tweets) and Therapeutics (3027 tweets) (TABLE 2). Tweets
about Prevention were composed at a steady rate from Days 0 to 49 while tweets about Therapeutics peaked on Day 21, approximately seven days before multiple pharmaceutical companies
announced vaccine trials (FIGURE 2) (11).
The most popular subdomain in Prevention was PPE (personal protective equipment) (2448 signal
tweets). In Therapeutics, Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine wwo Azithromycin and Mechanical
Ventilation were the most popular subdomains (1284 and 1224 signal tweets, respectively) (TABLE

3). Interestingly, neither vaccines nor Remdesivir were heavily discussed in the signal tweets. The
Infodemic quieted significantly a�er Day 50, when the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases (NIAID) commented about the use of Remdesivir in the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial
(11-13) (TABLE 4).
We evaluated the signal tweets and identified 2996 (33% being the highest quality: containing
either a citation to an external source or an image(s) or both. These tweets were archived in NephTwitterArchive.com and available for searches. During the active Infodemic phase (Days 0 to 49),
a total of 2021 searches were completed, which was a 26% increase from the same time period
before the pandemic was declared (Days -50 to -1). The average daily completed searches was 41.2
in the active Infodemic period; daily completed searches increased to 47.6 during the quiescent
period (Days 50-199; 7144 completed searches).

Discussion

The COVID-19 Infodemic exacerbated an already known and increasingly di�icult challenge for
those who rely on Twitter to share scientific information: the number of low-quality tweets is
overwhelmingly abundant and easily dilutes higher quality tweets (7-8). We coded algorithms to
separate signal from noise. By categorizing tweets into domains and subdomains, we were able
to reduce the noise by 43%Ṡubsequently, we identified and archived only 33% of the categorized
tweets. By comparing completed searches pre- and post-pandemic (days -50 to -1 and days 0
to +49, respectively), we were able to gauge interest in COVID-19-specific tweets by the Twitter
healthcare community. The substantial increase in searches suggests that healthcare providers
were looking for this information. Two representative examples show the limitations and strengths
of our algorithms. We believe the significant signal activity about Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine
wwo Azithromycin had more to do with a political misunderstanding of its e�icacy (or lack thereof)
rather than a legitimate scientific controversy about its e�ectiveness (14). Our algorithms could not
distinguish political misunderstanding from legitimate scientific controversy and thus tweets about
hydroxychloroquine were classified as signal and some were archived in NephTwitterArchive.com.
We were surprised that neither vaccines or the drug Remdesivir were actively discussed. The lack
of signal tweets for either subdomain may suggest that not enough scientific information and/or
clinical experience was available to generate informative tweets (15). In this case, our algorithms
identified these tweets as unsupported by external evidence and eliminated them from the archive.

Conclusion

The Infodemic indicates that future endeavors must be undertaken to eliminate noise and elevate
signal in all aspects of scientific discourse on Twitter (16). Our strategy to eliminate noise and
elevate signal has limitations, but in the absence of any algorithm-focused strategy, healthcare
providers will be le� with the nearly impossible task of manually finding high-quality tweets from
amongst a tsunami of noise.
