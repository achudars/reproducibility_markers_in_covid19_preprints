Abstract
Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease with
significant mortality, morbidity, and far-reaching economic and social disruptions. Testing is key
in the fight against COVID-19 disease. The gold standard for COVID-19 testing is the reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. RT-PCR requires highly specialized,
expensive, and advanced bulky equipment that is difficult to use in the field or in a point of care
setting. There is need for a simpler, inexpensive, convenient, portable and accurate test. Our aims
were to: (i) design primer-probe pairs for use in isothermal amplification of the S1, ORF3 and
ORF8 regions of the SARS-CoV2 virus; (ii) optimize the recombinase polymerase amplification
(RPA) assay for the isothermal amplification of the named SARS-COV2 regions; (iii) detect
amplification products on a lateral flow device. and (ii) perform a pilot field validation of RPA
on RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs.
Results: Assay validation was done at the National Reference Lab (NRL) at the Rwanda
Biomedical Center (RBC) in Rwanda. Results were compared to an established, WHO-approved
rRT-PCR laboratory protocol. The assay provides a faster and cheaper alternative to rRT-PCR
with 100% sensitivity, 93% specificity, and positive and negative predictive agreements of 100%
and 93% respectively.
Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-field and comparative laboratory
validation of RPA for COVID-19 disease in low resource settings. Further standardization will
be required for deployment of the RPA assay in field settings.
Keywords: RPA, COVID-19

Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease that has rapidly spread all
over the world leading to thousands of deaths, hospitalizations, and far-reaching economic and
social disruptions (Guo et al., 2020).

COVID-19 disease is caused by the severe acute

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and was first reported in Wuhan, China, in
December, 2019 (Wu et al., 2020). Fever and cough are the most common symptoms of the
infection. other symptoms include fatigue, dyspnea, muscle ache, headache, chest pain, diarrhea,
hemoptysis, sputum production, rhinorrhea, nausea and vomiting, sore throat, confusion,
diarrhea, and anorexia (Wu & McGoogan, 2020). The virus has caused more than 24 million
infections and 824,000 deaths worldwide with massive social disruption and far-reaching
economic effects as at the end of August 2020 (WHO, 2020).
Transmission of SARS-CoV2 is from person to person through respiratory droplets due to
coughing and sneezing and airborne aerosols. The disease can also spread through touching
infected surfaces and via the fecal-oral route (Lotfi et al., 2020). Clinical signs of COVID-19
disease appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus and include fever, sore throat, cough,
headache, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, muscle pain, chills, repeated shaking with
chills, and new loss of taste or smell (Chen et al., 2020; Sahin et al., 2020).
Testing is key in the fight against COVID-19 disease and is vital for the reopening of economies.
The gold standard for COVID-19 testing is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) (WHO, 2020). Whereas RT-PCR produces accurate and reproducible results,
it requires highly specialized, expensive, and advanced bulky equipment which cannot be used in
the field or in a point of care setting. It is also slow, and requires highly trained scientists.

Additionally, current RT-PCR tests are based on invasive sampling since samples are collected
using nasopharyngeal swabs which may be uncomfortable to many (Tang et al., 2020).
The antigen/antibody tests for COVID-19 overcome many of the challenges of the RT-PCR tests
since they are faster to conduct, cheaper, do not require expensive and bulky equipment, and can
be conducted in the field or at a point of care setting by non-scientists. However, the antigen
antibody tests are not very reliable and have a lower accuracy rate (Deeks et al., 2020).
Therefore, there is need for a test that provides the convenience and ease of the antigen/ antibody
test but with the accuracy and reliability of the RT-PCR test.
We have optimized an RPA assay for the detection of SARS-CoV2 for use in the field and in
rural settings and tested its applicability at a field station in Kigali, Rwanda. The assay leverages
on the power of recombinase polymerase amplification and lateral flow detection to provide a
method for the rapid detection of the SARS CoV2 in an accurate, simple, and affordable manner.
Unlike the RT-PCR test, isothermal amplification with detection on a lateral flow device does
not require expensive equipment, is portable and easy to perform, and can be done in the field or
in a point of care setting. It does not require highly trained scientists, is portable, versatile, and
does not require stable electricity (Daher et al., 2016). The optimized RPA assay was compared
against the LightMix RT-PCR test (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) as the ‘gold standard’.

Methods
Design of Primers and Probes

Primer design was based on the complete genome sequence of the SARS CoV2 isolate WuhanHu-1, complete genome, NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2 (Appendix 1). The SARS
CoV 2 genome is 29891 nucleotides in size, and it encodes 9860 amino acids with a G + C

content of 38%. Structurally, the genome is composed of two flanking untranslated regions
(UTRs) and one long open reading frame encoding a polyprotein arranged as follows orf1aorf1b-orf2-orf10. The 5’ UTR region is 265 nucleotides long while the 3’ UTR region is 358
nucleotides long. The Orf1/ab encodes 5′-replicase (orf1/ab)-structural proteins namely the Spike
(S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The replicase proteins are
cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) (Khailany et al., 2020).
To determine the best regions to target for efficient primer design, BLAST analysis was
performed and the percent sequence identity between the SARS CoV2 sequences and other
coronavirus sequences determined (table S 1). Primers were designed using Primer3 Plus
software to flank the Orf3b and Orf8/8b regions since this exhibit the lowest homology between
SARS CoV2 and other coronaviruses (Untergasser et al., 2012). This helped maximize the
specificity of the test assay. Additional primers targeted at the S1 region were designed (figure 19).
The rationale behind the design of S1 primers is that the S precursor protein of SARS-CoV-2 can
be proteolytically cleaved into S1 (685 aa) and S2 (588 aa) subunits. The S1 subunit contains a
signal peptide, followed by an N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD),
while the S2 subunit contains conserved fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat (HR) 1 and 2,
transmembrane domain (TM), and cytoplasmic domain (CP). The S2 protein is well conserved
among SARS-CoV-2 viruses and shares 99% identity with that of bat SARS-CoVs. In contrast,
the S1 subunit consists of the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which mediates virus entry into
sensitive cells through the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The S1
protein of 2019-nCoV shares about 70% identity with that of human SARS-CoVs. The highest
number of variations of amino acids in the RBD is located in the external subdomain (receptor

binding motif, RBM), which is responsible for the direct interaction between virus and host
receptor (Tai et al., 2020). Our primer target was the more conserved section of the RBD.
Primer design was based on best practice with regard to GC content and clamps and other basic
requirements but optimized for length as is needed for RPA probes. Length optimization ensured
that all primers lengths were between 18-35 with amplicon sizes ranging from 80-400bp. All
forward primers relating to have unmodified 5’ ends and all reverse primers have a biotin moiety
conjoined at their 5’ ends (Li et al., 2019). The primer pairs amplify S1 region of SARS-CoV2.

RNA Extraction Procedure
RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs using the QIAamp® Viral RNA kit (Qiagen,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 560 μl of lysis buffer + carrier
RNA was added into a sterile 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. Into this tube, 140 μl of the sample was
added and the mixture vortexed for 15 seconds, then incubated at room temperature for 10
minutes. 560 μl of ethanol was added followed by vortexing for 15 seconds. The whole mixture
was drawn into a spin column and centrifugation conducted at 8000rpm for 1 minute at room
temperature. The spin column was fit into a new collection tube, 500 μl wash buffer (AW1) was

added into the spin column, and centrifugation done at 8000rpm for 1 minute at room
temperature. The spin column was fit in a new collection tube and 500 μl wash buffer (AW2)
was added into the spin column followed by centrifugation at 14,000rpm and centrifugation for 3
minutes at room temperature. The spin column and collection tube was spun at 14,000rpm
centrifugation for 1 minutes to remove residual ethanol. RNA was eluted using 60 μl eluent and
the nucleic acid solution used immediately or stored at -200c for later use. The concentration of
RNA was measured using the NanoDrop™ 2000/2000c Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher, UK).
RT-PCR
RT-PCR was conducted on Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real Time PCR System (Roche,
Basel, Switzerland) using the LightMix RT-PCR test kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The
thermal cycling condition was 45 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of
95 °C for 15 s, and 55 °C for 1 minute. Negative controls (no template) were incorporated into
each set of reactions. Cycle threshold (ct) values higher than 40 were considered to be negative
results.
RPA Optimization

The TwistAmp nfo Kit (TANFO02KIT; TwistDX, Maidenhead, UK) was used to perform the
reactions in a final volume of 48 μl. The reaction mix was prepared in a 1.5 ml tube. The master
mix comprised of 2.1 μl of 10 μM forward primer, 2.1 μl of 10. 2 μl M reverse primer,
TwistAmp® nfo probe (0.6ul), 27.5 μl of the rehydration buffer, 2.5 μl of SuperScript™ III
Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher, UK), and 2 μl of RNase H (ThermoFisher, UK). RNA
template (1ul) and water up to 10 μl was added to the mastermix and thorough mixing done. The
reaction mix was added to a TwistAmp® nfo reaction and mixed by pipetting. 2.5 μl of 280mM
Magnesium Acetate (MgOAc) was added to the reaction and the reaction started by mixing.
Reactions were incubated in a heat block at 37˚C for 20 minutes and after 4 minutes the strips

were removed, vortexed, and spun briefly, then returned into the heating block. Negative
controls (no template) were incorporated into each set of reactions.
Detection on a Lateral Flow Device

The FAM-sequence-biotin amplicons were detected on a PCRD lateral flow cassette (Abingdon
Health, York, UK) where presence of the viral material was indicated by formation of a line on
the 2nd position of the cassette. To detect the amplicons, 6 μl of the amplification product was
pipetted into a 1.5 ml tube and diluted using 84 μl of the PCRD extraction buffer. The foiled
device was opened immediately before use and 75 μl of the diluted reaction mixture added to the
sample well of the PCRD cassette. The cassette was left in the horizontal position for 10 minutes
and then read visually. The third position of the PCRD lateral flow cassette has a control line that
forms to show that fluid has passed in the flow cell. Positive samples therefore had 2 lines
forming on the cassette: line 1 positive for S1 and line 3 which is the control line.
Validation Assays at NRL, RBC

Assay validation was done at the National Reference Lab (NRL) at the Rwanda Biomedical
Center (RBC). Previously collected, anonymized samples from current COVID-19 patients were
randomly selected and used to validate the assay. The cycle threshold of the patient samples used
ranged between 16-39 (table S 2). The template average concentration was calculated using the
following formula N1 V1=N2 V2 by considering the standard concentration of 28.9 ng/ μl for
sample B32213 with ct Values ranging 36-37 (Figure S 1). The sensitivity and specificity of the
assay was calculated and the measures validated by RT-PCR using the LightMix®Modular
SARS-CoV2 E-gene and RdRp kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) according to WHO and Rwanda
NRL guidelines. Visualization was done using the PCRD cassettes

Statistical Tests

Graphpad QuickCalcs (https://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/ConfInterval1.cfm) was used to
calculate confidence intervals (95% CI) for sensitivity and specificity comparisons
of LightMix®Modular

and

RPA.

The

easyRoc

v1.3.1

(http://www.biosoft.hacettepe.edu.tr/easyROC/) tool was used to calculate receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves and the sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive
values and likelihood ratios for comparison of the RPA assay against the LightMix®Modular
SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR as the ‘gold standard.’ P-values of < 0.05 were considered significant. SE
estimation was done using the DeLong (1988) method and the Youden index used for the
optimal cut-off (Goksuluk et al., 2016).

Results
Of the 28 samples that were tested using the LightMix®Modular SARS-CoV2 E and RdRp gene kits,
50% (n=14) were positive and 50% (n=14) were negative. All these samples were subjected to RPA
analysis. Of the 14 that were positive by LightMix®Modular SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR, 13 (~93%) were
positive by RPA. All the 14 samples that were negative by LightMix®Modular SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR
were also negative by RPA (100%) (Table 1).

Discussion
In this study, we have shown that the RPA assay has a sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of
~93% compared to the gold standard RT-PCR test when used in the detection of the SARSCoV2 virus from nasopharyngeal swabs. The gold standard was the LightMix® Modular SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR kit targeting the envelope (E) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)
genes. The LightMix® Modular SARS-CoV-2 E-gene and RdRp gene tests are based on
amplification of a 76 bp long fragment from a conserved region in the SARS-CoV2 E gene and
of the RdRp gene respectively followed by detection using FAM-labelled hydrolysis probes. The
sensitivity and specificity of the LightMix® E-gene kit has been validated by several researchers
(Corman et al., 2020; Roche, 2020). Findings show that this test has high specificity and
sensitivity, does not show cross reactions with common pathogens, is rapid with fewer
verification requirements, and is widely deployed (Yip et al., 2020; PHE, 2020). Based on this,
the LightMix® Modular SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR kit was an appropriate gold standard to use for
comparison during the RPA validation.
The overall sensitivity of the RPA assay was 93.3%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value
100%, negative predictive value 92.9%, and the negative likelihood ratio 0.067 compared to the
gold standard. A systematic review of RT-PCR tests revealed that initial false-negative RT-PCR
results occur in 54% of all COVID-19 tests and that the sensitivity of these tests ranges from 7198% (Arevalo-Rodriguez et al., 2020). Broughton et al (2020) described an RPA-based method
for detection of SARS-CoV2 using CRISPR/Cas-12 and reported a PPV of 95% and 100% NPV
compared to the conventional RT-PCR assay (Broughton et al., 2020). Thus, our RPA assay
compares well with available RT-PCR tests and the CRISPR/Cas12 test.

The positive likelihood ratio (LR) of our assay was infinite. Infinite LR suggest that the
condition that’s being tested is definitely present. On the other hand, negative LR, which is the
ratio of true negatives to false negatives, acts as a pointer on the absence of the condition being
tested given a negative result (Deeks & Altman, 2004). The negative LR for our RPA assay was
14.9. Based on the LR ratios, the conclusion is that the assay is asymmetric as it is very good at
ruling in covid-19 infection when the assay is positive than it is at ruling out infection when the
test is negative. Predictive values were 1.0 (positive) and 0.929 (negative) meaning that a
positive RPA assay is 100% predictive of SARS-CoV2 infection but a negative RPA assay result
leaves a 7% probability of disease.
The ROC curve is a plot of sensitivity versus 1-specificty and provides mean sensitivity values
over all possible specificity values. The converse is also true. The ROC is a good measure of a
diagnostic test’s utility (Mandrekar, 2010). The AUC in our assay was 0.97. According to
Hosmer & Lemeshow (2000), AUC values greater than 0.9 are outstanding. This implies that the
RPA assay has excellent discriminating ability and will correctly distinguish covid-19 positive
samples correctly from negative samples 97% of the time (Hosmer & Lemeshow, 2000)
Out of the 14 samples that tested positive with the gold standard, only one was negative for the
RPA assay. There are several possible explanations for this failure including variation due to use
of different gene primers, mutations in the SARS-CoV2 region targeted by the S1 gene primerprobe pairs, personnel skills, technical factors, lab standards, sampling procedures,
contamination of the RT-PCR sample, and lack of optimization of enzyme concentrations and
assay reaction temperatures. This can be possibly corrected through use of multiple gene targets
involving multiplexing of the other unused ORF3 and ORF8 primer-probe pairs with the S1
primer-probe pair, optimization of enzyme concentrations and assay reaction temperatures, and

review of the lab procedures for possible anomalies (Tahamtan & Ardebili, 2020).
Reproducibility was 100% for samples that had initially tested negative and 84% for those that
had initially tested positive discounting possible anomalies in the lab testing process for the RPA
assay.
Even though RT-PCR tests such as the gold standard used in this study have received positive
reviews (Corman et al., 2020), these tests can also detect other sarbecoviruses including bat
SARS-related coronaviruses and SARS-CoV and is not only specific for SARS-CoV-2 in spite
of the fact that they are designed around well conserved regions (Corman et al., 2020). This
means that they are primarily suited for initial screening with the requirement of further
confirmatory testing. This non-specificity can be attributed to the significant homology that’s
shared between the E envelope of SARS-CoV2 and other coronaviruses (Yip et al., 2020). In
contrast, our assay utilized primer-probe pairs for the S1 region of the spike glycoprotein which
is less homologous to the glycoprotein of other coronaviruses. The SARS-CoV2 E gene shares
100% and 95% homology with Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) coronavirus (batSL-CoVZXC21) and SARS-CoV E genes respectively. Homology between SARS-CoV2
ORF3b, bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and SARS-CoV2 is 32%. Homology between SARS-CoV2 ORF8
and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and SARS-CoV2 is 94% and 40% respectively while that between
SARS-CoV2, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and SARS-CoV is 70%. This reduced similarity together with
relatively longer primers and probes helps to overcome the weakness of the conventional RTPCR tests with regard to detection of other sarbecoviruses.
Mutations in the S1 and ORF3b/8 regions may affect the ability of our assay to accurately detect
SARS-CoV2. Korber et al (2020) reported a widespread mutation in the S gene. According to
their findings, the D614G mutation involves replacement of glutamic acid by aspartic acid in the

614th position of the S protein (position 23,403 in the Wuhan reference). The D614G mutation is
part of the G clade, it is almost always linked to 3 other mutations, and differs from the first
Wuhan virus by 4 mutations. It is suggested that the S mutations may be more infectious (Korber
et al. 2020). A strong recurrent mutation on the S gene at position 21,575 was reported by van
Dorp et al (2020). In total, van Dorp et al (2020) report 199 SARS-CoV2 mutations. 60% of the
reported mutations are found in the ORF1ab region and 11% in the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein
region. Lowest mutation rates are found in the E (0.5%), ORF10 (1%), and ORF6 (1%) regions.
Mutations in the S, ORF3a, and ORF8 comprise approximately 10%, 6%, and 1.5% of all
mutations (van Dorp et al., 2020).
From the foregoing, there are 3 conclusions. First, the S1 primers in our RPA assays were
designed to span positions 1847 to 1877 (forward) and 1997 to 2029 (reverse) of the S gene.
These are, to the best of our knowledge, outside the range of S gene mutations so far described.
A similar observation is made for our ORF3 and ORF8 primers. Of all the reported mutations,
none has affected the region targeted by our primers yet. Secondly, if such mutations on the S
gene are more infectious, the additional utility of our RPA test would be to design primers
around the variable region and use this to discriminate mild or less infectious disease (wild type)
from the more infectious (mutated) since the assay is based on double detection on a lateral
device. The utility would be in multiplexing the S primers with primers from a more conserved
region, such as E or ORF8. Thirdly, it is argued that SARS-CoV2 mutation rates are relatively
slower and that being a highly infectious disease with a low fatality rate, human hosts may
acquire widespread immunity and this may impose selection pressure on the virus, driving new
mutations (Biswas et al., 2020; Das et al., 2020). The implication is that, based on emerging

genomic information on SARS-CoV2 mutations, tests may need to be readjusted continuously
with regard to primer/probe pairs.
Regarding the concentration of the RNA used in the RPA assay, most of the samples had a
concentration below 3 ng/ul. This demonstrates that the RPA assay is very powerful and can
detect very small concentrations of the SARS-CoV2 virus and compares well with the minimum
RNA concentration required for RT-PCR tests.
Study Limitations
Due to financial limitations, only 49 samples were tested, optimization of reaction temperatures
and MgOAc concentrations was not done, ORF3a and ORF8a/b probes were not tested, and the
absolute limit of detection of RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs for RPA testing could
not be determined.
Conclusion

We have shown here that RPA can be applied successfully for the detection of SARS-CoV2
virus in nasopharyngeal swabs. However, further optimization of the reaction temperature and
MgOAc concentration is required. Other recommendations include determination of detection
limit, testing of crude extracts in place of pure extracts, and multiplexing of S1 and ORF primers
and probes in one reaction for double detection of virus as the second step of validation. Findings
suggest that sputum is more sensitive than nasal swabs for SARS-Cov2 detection (Yang et al.,
2020). Since the RPA assay requires minimal RNA concentrations, it is suggested that crude
sputum samples be trialed in place of nasal/oropharyngeal swabs since the latter also are invasive
and uncomfortable and false negatives have been linked to incorrect collection of nasal swabs.
Finally, further validation studies using a larger sample size needs to be conducted.
