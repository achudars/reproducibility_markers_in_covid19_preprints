Abstract
After the outbreak of the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) worldwide in 2012.
Currently, a novel human coronavirus has caused a major disease outbreak, and named corona
virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The emergency of MRES-COV and COVID-19 has caused
global panic and threatened health security. Unfortunately, the similarities and differences
between the two coronavirus diseases remain to be unknown. The aim of this study, therefore,
is to perform a systematic review to compare epidemiological, clinical and laboratory features
of COVID-19 and MERS-COV population. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane
Register of Controlled Trials database to identify potential studies reported COVID-19 or
MERS-COV. Epidemiological, clinical and laboratory outcomes, the admission rate of
intensive cure unit (ICU), discharge rate and fatality rate were evaluated using GraphPad
Prism software. Thirty-two studies involving 3770 patients (COVID-19 = 1062, MERS-COV
= 2708) were included in this study. The present study revealed that compared with COVID19 population, MERS-COV population had a higher rate of ICU admission, discharge and
fatality and longer incubation time. It pointed out that fever, cough and generalised weakness
and myalgia were main clinical manifestations of both COVID-19 and MERS-COV, whereas
ARDS was main complication. The most effective drug for MERS-COV is ribavirin and
interferon.
Keywords: COVID-19, MERS-COV, Clinical chaeacteristics, complication, ICU admission
rate, Fatality rate.

Introduction
Coronaviruses are RNA viruses with envelope and non-segmented positive-sense,
causing respiratory and intestinal tract infections in humans and other mammals [1]. Despite
majority of patients present mild symptoms and good prognosis, the spread of two βcoronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-COV) and middle east
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-COV), have resulted in the infection of thousands
of individuals in past decades, with the fatality rate of 10% for SARS-COV population and
37% for MERS-COV population [2-4]. Before 2019, there is a total of six identified
coronaviruses, but that might only be a small part of the iceberg, with potentially more novel
and terrible zoonoses to be presented.
As December 8, 2019, a series of unexplained pneumonia cases linked to Huanan
seafood wholesale market has been reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China [5-6]. Clinical
characteristics of this pneumonia were very similar to those of viral pneumonia such as
MERS-COV, initially severe acute respiratory infection, followed by developing rapidly acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and even acute respiratory failure [7]. Sequencing data
from throat swab samples of a patient indicated a novel coronavirus subsequently named
corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by world health organization (WHO). So far, more
than 70000 confirmed cumulative cases have been reported in China, and more than 10000
confirmed cumulative cases in other countries such as South Korea, Japan, Italy, Iran and the
USA.

Although many previous studies have reported clinical characteristics of COVID-19 or
MERS-COV diseases [8-11], systematic comparison of clinical features between COVID-19
and MERS-COV diseases has yet been published. Thus, the purpose of this study is to
perform a systematic review of epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics of
patients infected by COVID-19 or MERS-COV disease, and to compare COVID-19 and
MERS-COV in the context of their incubation, laboratory features, admission rate of intensive
cure unit (ICU) and rate of discharge and fatality, which will provide a comprehensive
reference for clinical physicians in treatment of coronavirus diseases.
Material and Methods
Search strategy
A comprehensive and systematic search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE and
Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials database up to 26 February 2020. Medical Subject

The study that met following criteria were included: (1) reporting clinical characteristics
of COVID-19 or MERS-COV disease, (2) minimum sample size of five, (3) confirmed
COVID-19 or MERS-COV disease, (4) English literature. Studies were excluded as following
criteria: duplicate publications, case report, meta-analysis, letter, review, technology report,
commentary, animal trial, correspondence, predictive study, guidence, radiograph study and
meeting report.
Study Selection
At the beginning, 4743 potential publications were identified. We removed 678
duplicates and reviewed the titles and abstracts of remaining 4065 publications. 4015
publications were excluded for following reasons: not involved research point (n = 1378),
review (n = 569), no English (n = 33), case report (n = 316), meta-analysis (n = 1), letter (n =
127), technology report (n = 196), commentaries (n = 61), animal study (n = 1107),
correspondence (n = 29), predictive study (n = 110), guidence (n = 28), meeting report ( n =
16) and radiograph (n = 44). Then, a comprehensive review of full-text was conducted for
remaining 50 publications. Two reviewers independently screened eligible literature, and any
argument was solved by discussion with a third reviewer. Finally, thirty-two studies were
included in this study [8-39]. The process was shown in Figure 1.
Data Extraction
Two reviewers extracted independently common, clinical and laboratory characteristics
of included studies, with disagreements were solved by discussion with a third reviewer. The
extracted data included incubation time, white blood cell (WBC) count, lymphocyte count, creactive protein (CRP), alamine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST),

creatinine, creatine kinase (CK), the admission rate of intensive cure unit (ICU), rate of
discharge and fatality, symptom, comorbidity, complications and cure rate of drug. For
normality distribution data, outcomes were extracted directly. For skewness distribution data,
the outcomes was extracted after being converted as specific formula [40].
Quality Assessment
The quality assessment of included studies was performed through the Newcastle-Ottawa
Quality Assessment Scale (NOS), as recommended by the Cochrane Non-Randomized
Studies [41]. The NOS includes three parts for risk of bias, with nine points in total: (1)
selection of research groups (four points); (2) inter-group comparability (two points); and (3)
ascertainment of exposure and outcomes (three points) for case–control and cohort studies,
respectively. Study that scored 6 or more was qualified for systematic review [42]. The
assessment process was completed by two reviewers independently. All debates were solved
by discussion with a third reviewer.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses and graphs were generated and plotted using GraphPad Prism
version 7.00 software (GraphPad Software Inc). The p value < 0.05 suggests significant
difference.
Results
Study Characteristics
All included studies were retrospective study [8-39]. Among ten studies reported
COVID-19, one trial was performed in Netherlands [12] and remaining nine trials were
conducted in China [8-9, 13-16, 37-39]. The sample size ranged from 6 to 425, and had a total

of 1062 patients (male = 610, female = 452). The year of publications was in 2020. On the
other hand, among twenty-two studies reported MERS-COV, fifteen studies were conducted
in Saudi Arabia [11, 17-18, 20-23, 27-30, 32, 34-36], five trials were performed in South
Korea [24-26, 31, 33], one trial was performed in Iran [19] and one trial was conducted in
Japan [10]. The sample size ranged from 5 to 883, and had a total of 2708 patients. The year
of publications ranged from 2013 to 2020. Clinical and laboratory characteristics of included
study were shown in Table 1 and Table 2 respectively.
Quality Assessment
Among thirty-two included studies, four studies obtained 6 points of NOS [26, 28, 32,
35], and remaining twenty-eight studies obtained 7 points of NOS or more [8-25, 27, 29-31,
33-34, 36-39]. The result of quality assessment was presented in Table 3.

liver injury, and the amount of which was 17 (1.6%), 28 (2.6%), 51 (4.8%), 11 (1%), 10
(0.9%) and 2 (0.2%) respectively. For MERS-COV population, the number of individuals
presented shock was 22 (0.8%), arrhythmia was 11 (0.4%), ARDS was 83 (3.1%), acute

hypertension, 77 (7.3%) patients had cardiovascular disease, 10 (0.9%) patients had chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 19 (1.8%) patients had malignancy, 24 (2.3%)
patients had chronic liver disease, 13 (1.2%) patients had cerebrovascular disease and 5
(0.5%) patients had chronic kidney disease. Among MERS-COV population, the number of
patients with diabetes was 247 (9.1%), hypertension was 244 (9%), cardiovascular disease
was 161 (5.9%), COPD was 83 (3.1%), malignancy was 70 (2.6%), chronic liver disease was
28 (1%), cerebrovascular disease was 47 (1.7%), chronic kidney disease was 167 (6.2%) and
obesity was 42 (1.6%). Those results were shown in Table 6.
Clinical and Laboratory Characteristics of COVID-19 versus MERS-COV
Systematic review was performed for clinical and laboratory outcomes of coronavirus
disease. There was no significant difference in age (50.9 ± 2 vs. 53.6 ± 1.5, P = 0.3), WBC
(5.7 ± 0.4 vs. 7.6 ± 1, P = 0.1), lymphocyte count (1.1 ± 0.1 vs. 0.8 ± 0.1, P = 0.2), CRP (37.6
± 5.8 vs. 13.9 ± 11.3, P = 0.1), ALT (28 ± 3.1 vs. 37.3 ± 5.1, P = 0.2), creatinine (74.5 ± 0.4
vs. 101.4 ± 18.5, P = 0.2) and creatine kinase (109.1 ± 20 vs. 136.4 ± 23.1, P = 0.5) between
COVID-19 and MERS-COV population. Compared with COVID-19 population, a higher
AST (31.5 ± 2.4 vs. 58.3 ± 7.6, P = 0.009) and longer incubtion time (5.1 ± 0.5 vs. 7.4 ± 0.4, P
= 0.02) were found in MERS-COV population. The results were shown in Table 7.

Incidence of ICU Admission, Discharge and Fatality
The higher admission rate of ICU was found in MERS-COV population than in COVID19 population ( 43.6% vs. 22.4%, Figure 2). There was a higher discharge rate in MERSCOV populations compared with COVID-19 population ( 59.9% vs. 33.5%, Figure 3). The
lower fatality rate was found in COVID-19 population compared with MERS-COV
population (6.8% vs. 34.1%, Figure 4).
Cure rate of drugs for MERS-COV
Of 93 patients treated by ribavirin and interferon, 67 (74.2%) were cured. Of 39 patients
treated by oseltamivir, 27 (69.2%) were cured. Of 70 patients treated by antivirals, 47 (67.1%)
were cured. Of 8 patients treated by intravenous immunoglobulin, 5 (62.5%) were cured. Of 9
patients treated by ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir, 4 (44.4%) were cured. Of 18 patients
treated by corticosteroids, 7 (38.9%) were cured. The results were shown in Figure 5.
Discussion
Coronavirus is an important pathogen causing respiratory and intestinal infection. Of
seven identified coronaviruses, the two very pathogenic viruses, SARS-COV and MERSCOV, cause severe ARDS and even acute respiratory failure. With a mortality rate of more
than 10% and more than 35% respectively [43-44]. The four other human coronaviruses
(HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1) only cause mild respiratory or
intestinal infection, despite they have certain pathogenicity for infants, young children and the
elderly with weakened immune systems [45-46]. The newest one is COVID-19. The
sequencing analysis has indicated that COVID-19, like SARS-COV and MERS-COV, belongs
to β-coronavirus. Both SARS-COV and MERS-COV originated in bats, but the origin of
COVID-19 remains to be further investigated. Although recent studies have reported the
clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19, systematic comparsion between COVID-19

and MERS-COV has yet been performed. Therefore, the aim of this study is to perform the
first systematic review to compare epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics of
COVID-19 and MERS-COV populations. Our results suggested that fever, cough and
generalised weakness and myalgia were main clinical manifestations of both COVID-19 and
MERS-COV, whereas ARDS was main complication. Compared with MERS-COV
population, COVID-19 population had a less incubation time and lower rate of ICU
admission, discharge and fatality.
Similarities of clinical characteristics between COVID-19 and MERS-COV have been
found. In the current study, the majority of COVID-19 patients presented with fever, cough
and generalised weakness and myalgia, which shows some resemblances to MERS-COV
infection. Moreover, both COVID-19 and MERS-COV patients hardly developed upper
respiratory tract infection such as rhinorrhoea or pharyngalgia, indicating that their target cells
might be located in lower respiratory. However, 11.6% of patients with COVID-19 infection
had diarrhoea or anorexia, and only 4.7% of patients with MERS-COV infection had this
symptom. Thus, Faces and urine samples should be tested to exclude a potential alternative
way of transmission that is unknown to the present.
In addition, we found that the number of males is more than that of females in either
COVID-19 or MERS-COV population. The possible reason of reduced susceptibility of
females to viral infection is that females have a lot of X chromosome and estrogen that are
vital components in development of innate and adaptive immunity [47]. Meanwhile, numbers
of patients with COVID-19 infection had chronic comorbidities, mainly hypertension,
diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which is similar to MERS-COV population. Those
results indicate that older adult males with chronic underlying disease might be more
susceptibility to COVID-19 or MERS-COV.

In terms of laboratory testing, reduced lymphocytes and increased CRP were found in
both COVID-19 and MERS-COV patients. This result indicates that COVID-19 might be
associated with cellular immune response, mainly act on lymphocytes like MERS-COV does
[48]. The cells infected by viruses induce the release of numbers of pro-inflammatory
cytokines and inflammation storm in the body. Moreover, increased cytokines might make
damage to related organs such as liver [49]. Our results demonstrated that abnormal value of
AST was found in MERS-COV population, but not in COVID-19 population. The possible
reason is that the follow-up time of COVID-19 population was too short, and the liver might
remain to be in compensatory stage. For this result, a long follow-up time study is urgently
needed. On the other hand, our results suggested that MERS-COV population had a higher
rate of ICU admission and fatality than COVID-19 population, indicating that compared with
MERS-COV, COVID-19 has less toxic and more easily cured. However, lower discharge rate
was found in COVID population than in MERS-COV population. The possible explanation is
that most of COVID-19 patients remained to be hospitalized at the time of manuscript
submission, and data on those patients could not be obtained in time. Thus, careful
interpretation is urged for this result.
Up to now, no effective strategy has been found for treatment of COVID-19 infection
[50]. Currently, the measure to COVID-19 is to control the source of the infection; taking
personal protective works to reduce the risk of transmission; and early diagnosing, isolating
and supportive treating for confirmed patients. In the present study, our systematic results of
cure rate of drug for MERS-COV infection indicated that ribavirin and interferon, oseltamivir,
antivirals and intravenous immunoglobulin all had been effective for MERS-COV infection,
with the cure rate of those drugs was 74.2%, 69.2%, 67.1% and 62.5% respectively. Thus, we

assume that those drugs might also be effective at COVID-19 infection. However, further
studies are needed to confirm this idea.
This study has several limitations. First, many patients infected by COVID-19 remained
to be hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission, leading to the unavailable of some
data. Second, the follow-up time of COVID-19 population is too short to get related data from
long-term observations of this disease. Third, finding of statistical tests and p values between
COVID-19 and MERS-COV populations should be interpreted with caution. Fourth, the
number of MERS-COV patients treated by drugs is small, careful understanding is needed for
the cure rate of drug for this disease. Finally, as COVID-19 is still developing around the
world and remains to have many unknowns, the results of this study are staged and need to be
carefully understood. More large-sample, multicentre, high-quality research should be
performed to update this study.
Conclusion
Our systematic review reveals that main clinical manifestations of both COVID-19 and
MERS-COV populations are fever, cough and generalised weakness and myalgia. ARDS is
main complication of both two populations. COVID-19 population has a shorter incubation
time and lower rate of ICU admission, discharge and fatality compared with MRES-COV
population.
