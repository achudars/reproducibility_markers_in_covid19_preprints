Abstract
In December 2019 and January 2020, novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) - infected pneumonia
(NCIP) occurred in Wuhan, and has already posed a serious threat to public health. ACE2
(Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) has been shown to be one of the major receptors that mediate
the entry of 2019-nCoV into human cells, which also happens in severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS). Several researches have indicated that some patients have
abnormal renal function or even kidney damage in addition to injury in respiratory system, and the
related mechanism is unknown. This arouses our interest in whether coronavirus infection will
affect the urinary and male reproductive systems. Here in this study, we used the online datasets to
analyze ACE2 expression in different human organs. The results indicate that ACE2 highly
expresses in renal tubular cells, Leydig cells and cells in seminiferous ducts in testis. Therefore,
virus might directly bind to such ACE2 positive cells and damage the kidney and testicular tissue
of patients. Our results indicate that renal function evaluation and special care should be
performed in 2019-nCoV patients during clinical work, because of the kidney damage caused by
virus and antiviral drugs with certain renal toxicity. In addition, due to the potential pathogenicity
of the virus to testicular tissues, clinicians should pay attention to the risk of testicular lesions in
patients during hospitalization and later clinical follow-up, especially the assessment and
appropriate intervention in young patients' fertility.

Introduction
Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus-induced pneumonia was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei
Province, China [1, 2]. The virus is a previously unknown sub-coronal virus (Î²-round virus)
named 2019-nCoV by WHO, which forms a branch in the subgenus sarbecvirus, subfamily
Orthocoronavirinae. 2019-nCoV is closely related to SARS- CoV with above 85% identity [3]. In
addition to common respiratory symptoms such as cough and fever, some patients may also
experience other symptoms such as diarrhea and liver damage [4], which brings more challenges
to the patient's recovery. Although the source of the 2019-nCoV is still unknown, previous
research has shown that the receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV was able to bind ACE2
protein on the surface of human cells, which provide strong evidence for human ACE2 being the
receptor for 2019-nCoV [5, 6].
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) belongs to the angiotensin-converting enzyme family
of dipeptidyl carboxydipeptidases, which is homologous to human angiotensin 1 converting
enzyme. The expression distribution of ACE2 suggests that it might play critical roles in the
regulation of cardiovascular and renal function, as well as fertility. Since the global outbreak of
SARS in 2003, numerous studies have revealed the role of cell surface ACE2 as the cellular
receptor for SARS-Cov and NL63 [7-9]. ACE2 has also been proven to be a major receptor of the
novel 2019-nCoV because 2019-nCoV is closely related to SARS-CoV. As the virus enters the cell
by binding to cell receptors to complete intracellular replication, virus release, and induce
cytotoxicity, the route of virus infection depends on the expression and distribution of the
corresponding receptor [10-12]. Meanwhile, the damage caused by the virus in different organs is
closely related to clinical manifestations and has a major implication for understanding the

pathogenesis and designing therapeutic strategies in clinical practice.
Here in this study, we analyzed the online datasets to uncover the expression pattern of ACE2 in
urinary and male reproductive systems, which is the potential mechanism of abnormal renal
function or even kidney damage in patients infected with 2019-nCoV. Moreover, we emphasized
high ACE2 expression level in testis because of the potential pathogenicity of the virus to
testicular tissues, especially the potential risks affecting fertility.

Materials and Methods
Clinical data
We summarized the clinical data of three previous studies to extract the incidence of abnormal
renal function or kidney damage in patients infected with 2019-nCoV [2, 13, 14]. All clinical data
are directly obtained from the articles above.

Publicly available scRNA-seq gene expression data sets
In this article, we made use of some online renal single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) gene
expression data sets that were publicly usable. These contained the data reported in GSE131685
and GSE107585.
We used RNA and protein expression data of ACE2 in different human tissues and cancer cell
lines through The Human Protein Atlas portal (Website: http://www.proteinatlas.org/) [15], GTEx
portal (Website: https://gtexportal.org) and The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) [16]. All
data are available directly online.

Analysis of scRNA-seq raw sequencing data
Primary analysis of scRNA-seq raw sequencing data
Raw reads were processed to generate gene expression matrices as described previously. Reads
with the same cell barcode, UMI and gene were grouped together to generate the number of UMIs
per gene per cell. Cell number was then determined based on the inflection point of the number of
UMI versus sorted cell barcode curve.

Results
To determine whether patients infected with 2019-nCoV have abnormal renal function or kidney
damage, we reviewed the latest 3 studies focused on the clinical features of such patients. In these
3 cohorts, one was a familial cluster of six patients, while other cohorts contained 99 patients and
41 patients, respectively. Outcome in two relatively larger sample studies suggest that about 3% to
10% of patients infected with 2019-nCoV had abnormal renal function, including elevated
creatinine or urea nitrogen. In addition, 7% of patients experienced acute renal impairment (Table
1). Considering the large number of infected patients, it is necessary to explore the mechanisms of
abnormal renal function and to promote to take special care on such patients.
As the virus frequently enters the cell by binding to cell receptors, and ACE2 has been proven to
be one of the major receptors of 2019-nCoV in human body, we explored the online datasets to
find out the expression level of ACE2 in urinary system. As we expected, data from CCLE and
GTEx portal indicated that ACE2 mRNA expression level is relatively higher in kidney cells
(Figure 1).
To further determine the protein expression level of ACE2 in kidney cells, we investigated the
Human Protein Atlas portal to find out some details. Results of immunohistochemistry (IHC) also
indicated that the expression level of ACE2 protein is significantly higher in the kidney, especially
in renal tubular cells, although the mRNA expression level is not such high (Figure 2, Table 2).
Unexpectedly, we also found that ACE2 expresses quite highly in testicular cells. The protein and
mRNA expression of ACE2 in the testes is almost the highest in the body. Moreover, both cells in
seminiferous ducts and Leydig cells showed high ACE2 expression level (Figure 2, Table 2).
These results indicate that testicular cells are the potential targets of 2019-nCoV.

To further assess the cell type specific expression of ACE2 and confirm ACE2 expression level in
kidney, we downloaded the gene expression data of single-cell RNA sequencing of human kidney
from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. We first analyzed GSE131685, a published
dataset containing scRNA-seq data of the normal kidney samples from 3 donors [17]. We divided
single cells into subclusters based on the canonical markers and cell classification in the original
literature (Figure 3A), and found specific ACE2 expressions in tubular cells. In contrast, ACE2
expression was not observed in immune cells and glomerular parietal epithelial cells (Figure 3 B).
Results of GSE132023 confirm the previous results (data not shown).
Therefore, ACE2 expression in renal tubular cells and testicular cells may suggest a potential
mechanism of infection and direct damage of renal tubules and testis by 2019-nCoV binding
ACE2 as host cell receptors.

Discussion
Novel coronavirus- infected pneumonia outbroke in Wuhan in December 2019 and January 2020,
which has posed a major threat to global public health [18]. The numbers of confirmed cases and
deaths are still rising quickly, posing higher challenges for disease control and patient treatment.
The symptoms of the disease are complex. In addition to common respiratory symptoms such as
cough and fever, some patients may also experience other symptoms such as diarrhea and liver
damage [4], or even asymptomatic, which brings more challenges to the patient's diagnosis and
treatment. Studies on the mechanisms of disease pathogenesis could help us understand the
disease comprehensively.
Here in this study, we first reviewed the latest literatures and found about 10% of the patients
infected with 2019-nCoV had abnormal renal function. This indicates the significance to explore
the mechanisms by which the virus affects renal cells. We used the online datasets and
bioinformatic methods and found out that ACE2, one of the major receptors for 2019-nCoV,
expresses quite highly in renal cells, particularly in tubular cells. IHC results showed no ACE2
expression in cells in glomeruli. Renal tubular cells have reabsorption and excretion functions, and
play a key role in excretion of metabolites, maintenance of body fluid balance and acid-base
balance. Renal tubular cell injury could cause renal tubules atrophy, thereby aggravating renal
interstitial fibrosis, secreting a variety of chemokines and growth factors into the stroma,
promoting interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration, interstitial intrinsic cell proliferation, and
extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation. Therefore, 2019-nCoV could enter the renal tubular cell
by binding to ACE2, which induces cytotoxicity and abnormal renal function. Examination and
follow-up of the renal function of patients infected with 2019-nCoV is necessary to detect the

impaired renal function in time and provide early intervention.
Another major point in this study is the high expression level of ACE2 in testicular cells. It is well
known that viruses such as HIV, HBV and mumps could enter the testicular cells and cause viral
orchitis. Besides, in some cases, virus-induced testicular tissue damage might result in male
infertility and testicular tumor [19]. SARS-CoV is just like the âcousinâ of 2019-nCoV and shares
the receptor ACE2 with 2019-nCoV. Previous research has also investigated the possible damage
of the testis in SARS patients and the effects of SARS on spermatogenesis. Their findings
suggested that orchitis is a complication of SARS and that spermatogenesis could be affected after
infection [20]. Current clinical data show that a large proportion of the novel coronavirus
(2019-nCoV) - infected pneumonia patients are young adults and even children, so the potential
testicular damage caused by the virus may exist as a late complication. However, limited
information is available regarding the involvement of reproductive organs in patients infected with
2019-nCoV. Therefore, our findings suggest that clinicians should take care of the possible
occurrence of orchitis. Following-up and evaluation of the reproductive functions should be done
in recovered male SARS patients, especially the young male patients.

Conclusions
Our study demonstrated the highly expression of ACE2 in kidney and testicular tissue and
facilitated the understanding of the mechanisms of abnormal renal function and kidney damage in
2019-nCoV-infected patients. Our findings also suggest the patient cares regarding the possible
occurrence of orchitis. Following-up and evaluation of the reproductive functions may be
necessary in recovered male SARS patients, especially the young male patients.
