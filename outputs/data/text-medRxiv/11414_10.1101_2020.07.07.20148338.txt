Abstract
th

On 24 March, 2020 the Government of India announced a national level lockdown to contain
the spread of COVID. The lockdown policy has generated considerable controversy, with critics
arguing that it was done without adequate notice or planning, exposed vulnerable section of the
population to a humanitarian crisis, and failed to contain the spread of COVID. In response, the
Government has claimed that lockdown slowed the transmission process of COVID, thereby
reducing the number of cases and deaths substantially. The consequent pressure on the health
infrastructure was also much less. To judge between competing claims, this study has undertaken
the first cost-benefit analysis of the world’s biggest lockdown. Although the data for a proper
cost-benefit analysis is currently not available, we have made a ball point estimate of the net
benefit of the lockdown under alternative scenarios. Our estimates reveal the net benefits of
lockdown to be negative; moreover, the results are robust under all scenarios.

What cost decisiveness?
A cost benefit analysis of the lockdown to contain COVID-19 in India

1 Introduction
Following the rapid spread of COVID in Europe and North America in February and early
March, 2020, the Government of India (GoI) took prompt and decisive action to contain the
spread of COVID by instituting a national lockdown. The lockdown was initially announced for
21 days, but was extended in April and May. A phased withdrawal has been started from June,
but restrictions continue in many regions of India.

It is widely accepted that lockdown is a drastic public health measure (Habibi et al. 2020, Sands
2016) with far-reaching consequences (Stone 2020, Polletto et al. 2014). The adoption of such an
extreme step requires careful analysis. A cost-benefit analysis of the lockdown in India is thus
imperative. While data for a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis will be available only in the
coming years, we have made a ball point estimate of the net benefit of the lockdown.

2 Contextualizing the lockdown
The lockdown of a society of more than 1.3 billion people over more than two months was hailed
by the World Health Organization (WHO) as “tough and timely” (PTI 2020). But the WHO
failed to realize the lack of planning associated with the decision. While lockdown is primarily a
defensive strategy to buy time for preparing the health infrastructure for the protracted struggle
of combating COVID in the post lockdown period, the GoI used it as an offensive weapon—
hoping that COVID would peter out during the lockdown. Nor did the GoI appreciate the
challenges that would be posed by India’s huge population distributed across diverse geophysical
regions, health inequalities, socio-economic disparities, and varied cultural values. The
announcement of the lockdown at hours’ notice did not give the huge population, particularly the
socio-economically vulnerable section, time to prepare for the coming hardship. It led to a
humanitarian crisis, with migrant workers starting a long and disastrous march, with those
remaining behind starving, and becoming stricken by COVID. Simultaneously, there was loss of
income and livelihoods of millions of people. The education system and maternal and child
health programmes, too, were in complete disarray.

The GoI was quick to claim that the lockdown had reduced R0, flattened the COVID curve, and
prevented the health infrastructure from being over-burdened:
“The lockdown decision was a timely decision, it helped us contain the positive cases to
around 23,000 as of today, while it could have gone up to 73,000. Curve has begun to
flatten. The nation has shown that lockdown has been effective in saving lives, containing
the infection and slowing down the doubling rate” (Dr. V.K. Paul, cited in Hindusthan
Times).1
A study by Husain et al. (2020), however, estimates that hospitalization cases averted by
lockdown are only 0.08 to 1.39 lakhs, and would have imposed a burden only in a few states.

Figure 1: Impact of lockdown on COVID-cases using Interrupted Time Series model

Interrupted Time Series models (Wagner et al. 2002) are a popular method for evaluating impact
of public health intervention using community level data.2 Application of such models to analyse
the relationship between lockdowns and trend in COVID cases over time reveal that the first two

lockdowns failed to reduce the intercept and slope (Fig. 1); in fact there was a statistically
significant increase in both level and slope of the COVID-time curve. Only the third lockdown
produced a change in level, though the trajectory of cumulative cases remained unaltered. The
fourth lockdown was associated with an increase in both level and trajectory. The lockdowns,
therefore, do not seem to have any major impact on the dynamics of COVID transmission. It is
possible, however, that COVID would have spread at a greater pace in the absence of the
lockdowns; further, there are other implications (both on the cost and benefit side) of lockdowns.
The present study incorporates other possible benefits and costs of the strategy to estimate the
net benefit of the world’s greatest lockdown.

3 Methodology and data
The costs and benefits imposed by the lockdown are categorized in Table 1.

Table 1: Costs and benefits of lockdown included in study
Benefits

Costs

1. COVID cases avoided

1. Unemployment

2. Net deaths averted due to lockdown:

2. Loss in production

(COVID-deaths + Deaths due to road accidents + Deaths
due to Pollution) less (Deaths due to delay in treating
cancer and TB + Deaths due to non-COVID reasons3)

Of course, there are other costs of lockdown—increase in domestic violence, disruption of
maternal and child health programmes, changes in dietary practices, interruption of education,
etc. We have not included such components because there are difficulties in estimating the
money value of such costs. It implies that our study underestimates the true cost of lockdown.
The COVID cases averted due to the lockdown is the difference between actual cases as on 6th
June 2020, and predictions made using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model
(Kermack and McKendrick 1927). The model parameters are estimated based on Indian data for
the pre-lockdown period using a Maximum Likelihood model (R0 = 3.048). The costs of treating
COVID cases is taken to be Rs.150,000 over a 14 day period (Sethi 2020). The case fatality rate

(0.0261%) is taken as the mean of 7-day moving average of deaths per cases, and used to
estimate deaths without lockdown.

The shutdown and consequent change in life styles has also changed normal mortality patterns
and rates. For instance, reduction of production has led to a cleaner environment, lowering
deaths due to pollution. Similarly, reduced vehicular movement has cut down traffic accidents.
On the cost side, delays in seeking treatment or disruption of public health programmes is
increasing mortality due to cancer, TB, etc. Lockdown is also increasing mental strain, causing
suicide rates to shoot up—referred to as “deaths of despair” (Case and Deaton 2020). These have
to be incorporated into our analysis.

The decrease in mortality if the reduced pollution level continues for 3 months is estimated to be
0.16 million (Sharma et al. 2020). Based on estimates reported in various studies, we assume an
additional 0.15 million TB-related deaths (Stop TB Partnership, Imperial College, Avenir Health,
Johns Hopkins University and USAID 2020) and 742 non-COVID related deaths4 occurred due
to lockdown. Accident deaths averted is estimated by calculating the total number of deaths
(mid-year population: 1.38 billion; UNDP estimate of death rate of 7.6564 per thousand), and
assuming that 2.9% of them (ICMR, PHFI, and IHME 2017) would have been due to road
accidents. Normally 0.22 million deaths would have transpired from cancer deaths;5 the
additional mortality attributable to lockdown (43,849 deaths) is 20% above the normal mortality
rate from cancer (Lai et al. 2020).

Combining the mortality-related figures, we get net deaths averted by lockdown to be 285,473.
The money value of this is estimated by assuming that such persons would have earned for the
next 20 years.6 Starting with an initial annual income of Rs. 135,050 (estimated Net National
Income per capita for 2019-20 reported by GoI, 2020a), we have assumed that every year there
will be an exponential increase of 6, 7 or 8%; a discount rate of 4% is applied to all future
payments to obtain present value. These figures, combined with money value of cases avoided,
give us three estimates of benefits from lockdown.

We now consider the costs of lockdown. CMIE has estimated that one out of every four worker
lost their jobs following lockdown; it implies that about 114 million jobs were lost in April (Vyas
2020), of which 21 million were regained in May (Mishra 2020). Although experts feel that
some of these jobs will be lost for a long period, we make the heroic assumptions that 50% of the
remaining unemployed will regain work in 2020-21, a further 25% will be re-employed in the
next financial year, and job recovery will be complete by April 2022. The money value of
unemployment is calculated as the income lost during the jobless period.

The Ministry of Commerce & Industry reports that the core sector has shrunk by 38% due to the
lockdown (GoI 2020b). We estimate the production loss under three assumptions—2, 5, and 10%
of the Net National Income of Rs. 168.37 trillion (2018-19).

5 Planning the lockdown
Tyler Cowan had commented that the lockdown was being used by political leaders to shore up
their image as strong and decisive decision makers.7 In India, in the haste to appear tough and
decisive, the GoI failed to plan for the lockdown adequately. Ultimately—with diminishing
returns to lockdowns, rising economic costs, and apathy of the public to lockdowns—the GoI
had little choice but to start phasing out the lockdown before the peak was reached. This policy
generates the threat of a major spike in COVID cases.

An alternative policy could have relied on better checking of international passengers at airports,
coupled with earlier closing of political boundaries; it might have delayed the entrance of
COVID in India. The lockdown itself could have been deferred to May. The postponement
would have resulted in more cases—but our projections using the SIR model indicates that the
increase in COVID cases would have been a relatively modest 10%. In the interim period, social
distancing, and a targeted lockdown in selective hotspots could have geographically contained
transmission, while the humanitarian crisis avoided by transporting the migrant workers home.
The latter policy had the additional advantage that migrant workers would have been able to
return home when few were affected by COVID. It could have possibly avoided the rapid
spreading of COVID from states like Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi to the districts of Bihar,
West Bengal and Jharkhand observed after the Shramik trains. In a bid to upstage the states,
however, the GoI failed to differentiate between dramatics and achievements; it remains to be
seen how costly this is for India.
