Abstract
In the absence of a viable pharmaceutical intervention for SARS-CoV-2, governments have implemented
a range of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to curb the spread of infection of the virus and the
disease caused by the virus, now known as COVID-19. Given the associated social and economic costs, it
is critical to enumerate the individual impacts of NPIs to aid in decision-making moving forward. We used
globally reported SARS-CoV-2 cases to fit a Bayesian model framework to estimate transmission
associated with NPIs in 26 countries and 34 US states. Using a mixed effects model with country level
random effects, we compared the relative impact of other NPIs to national-level household confinement
measures and evaluated the impact of NPIs on the global trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic over time.
We observed heterogeneous impacts of the easing of restrictions and estimated an overall reduction in
infection of 23% (95% CI: 18-27%) associated with household confinement, 10% (95% CI: 1-18%) with
limits on gatherings, 12% (95% CI: 5-19%) with school closures and 17% (95% CI: 6-28%) with mask
policies. We estimated a 12% (95% CI: 9-15%) reduction in transmission associated with NPIs overall. The
implementation of NPIs have substantially reduced acceleration of COVID-19. At this early time point,
we cannot determine the impact of the easing of restrictions and there is a need for continual assessment of
context specific effectiveness of NPIs as more data become available.

Introduction
The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus was identified in late December 2019 with first cases occurring in Wuhan
City, Hubei Province, China. A rapid spread of the virus in China, followed by an exponential increase of
global cases of the virus, resulted in the declaration of a global pandemic by the World Health Organization
(WHO) on March 11, 2020. As of the end of July 2020, reported infections have exceeded 13 million
representing a small fraction of the estimated global burden and resulting in almost than 580 000 reported
deaths1. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs via droplets or direct contact2. Mortality associated with
the disease cause by the virus, now known as COVID-19, is highest in those of older age and those with
pre-existing vascular and respiratory conditions 2.
In the absence of viable pharmaceutical interventions, governments have implemented non-pharmaceutical
interventions (NPIs) informed by historical outbreaks of H1N1 Influenza 3, severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)4. Using data from control measures
implemented in China in the first months of the epidemic 5,6, mathematical modelling studies 7–10, and,
observational evidence 11, NPIs have been implemented at both national and sub-national scales, at varying
times in the epidemic trajectory and at varying levels of severity. These interventions have ranged from the
closure of educational institutions, social distancing measures, restrictions on public gatherings, face-mask
policies and, enforcement of large-scale quarantines including stay-at-home orders, household
confinements and national lockdowns. NPIs have been implemented to reduce population contact and slow
down transmission rates resulting in an estimated 55% of the total global population observing some form
of self-quarantine by the end of April 2020 12.
Through the implementation of NPIs, a number of Asian and European countries first affected by the
pandemic have curbed infection rates and have achieved epidemic control 8. As infection rates continue to
rise in other regions, a number of European countries have begun to lift restrictions starting May 2020. A
recent study utilised the incidence rate ratio, the ratio of the rate of new infections reported between two
time-periods, to evaluate the impact of NPIs in 139 countries 11. They reported that physical distancing
measures were associated with a 13% reduction of SARS-CoV-2 incidence. One of the difficulties in
enumerating the quantitative impact of COVID-19 NPIs relates to the currently available measurement of
transmission based on real-time reported SARS-CoV-2 incidence. Discrepancies in the coverage and
strategy of testing over time, as well as delays in reporting and time to symptom onset, mean that dailyconfirmed cases do not give an accurate depiction of the total infected population at a given point in time.
Due to this, a number of groups have implemented dynamic mathematical modelling to estimate
transmission parameters that are currently unknown 7–10. A recent systematic review of evidence until
March 12 2020 included observational and modelling studies of SARS and MERS outbreaks and modelling
studies of COVID-19 related NPIs, concluding that quarantine measures were effective in reducing
transmission and COVID-19 related deaths4. Authors cautioned that data from SARs and MERS outbreaks
may not be applicable to the current pandemic and that results from modelling studies were based on limited
data at this early stage4.
The European Centre of Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) developed an age-stratified dynamic
transmission model to estimate the impact of NPIs in 30 European countries from the start of the pandemic
to 2 May 20209. In the absence of empirical evidence on the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 related NPIs, they
used expert opinion to estimate and rank the effectiveness of enforced lockdowns, voluntary home
confinement, and closure of public spaces and cancellation of mass gatherings estimating an 70% median
reduction in population contacts as a result of NPI implementation9. Using a semi-mechanistic Bayesian
hierarchical model, Flaxman et al. estimated the impact of lockdowns, banning of public events, school
closures, self-isolation and social distancing in eleven European countries from the start of the pandemic to

May 4, 20208. Due to the close and often overlapping time-periods in which interventions were
implemented in the early stages of the pandemic, they were unable to ascertain the impacts of specific
interventions. They did however estimate that periods of national lockdowns have led to an 81% (95% CI:
75-87%) reduction in transmission overall, as well as the prevention of 3.1 million deaths across all eleven
countries 8. Another study [currently in preprint] utilised a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model
with time-varying covariates for nine countries in three continents that were or currently are SARS-CoV-2
epicentres10. They found that travel restrictions and social distancing were not associated with reductions
in transmission and instead ascertained that a combination of school closures, mask wearing and centralized
quarantine may be sufficient to replace full lockdown measures10. Since the publication of these studies, a
number of research organisations have begun to collate and validate global datasets tracking the
implementation of SARS-CoV-2 NPIs by either assigning a time varying ordinal scale of the severity of
interventions implemented or using a variety of intervention categorisation frameworks13.
To our knowledge, no-one has implemented Bayesian methodology accounting for uncertainty in SARSCoV-2 transmission and data reporting, to quantify the impact of specific related NPIs across all global
regions. Additionally, we incorporated the first global estimates of the impacts of easing of restrictions up
to May 31st, 2020. Previous studies have focused on European countries first affected by the pandemic and
as such the effectiveness of NPIs in other global regions where cases continue to rise is currently unknown.
It is critical to enumerate the individual impacts of NPIs to aid in decision making moving forward,
especially for countries in the second and third wave of affected countries. We consider the impact of the
timing of the interventions in the local trajectory of the pandemic. In addition to what is currently known
about the impact of NPIs in European countries in the first months of the pandemic, we include countries
affected later in the global trajectory, where we expect a different impact of specific NPIs as global
awareness has resulted in large-scale behavioural changes.
Methods
Global NPI timeline: We created a global timeline of the implementation on NPIs including quarantine
and isolation policies, limits on gatherings, school closures (primary, secondary and tertiary educational
institutions), mask policies, household confinements (stay-at-home-orders, shelter in place orders and
lockdowns) and the easing of restrictions. We included all countries and United States (US) where COVID19 had exceeded 5000 cases by May 31st, 2020. We accessed daily reported cases from the United States
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) COVID Data Tracker14 for the US and European Centre of Disease
Prevention and Control data for the rest of the world, all accessed on May 31st, 20201. We utilised the public
health and social measures global dataset curated by the WHO (WHO PHSM), a consolidated dataset of
six global databases of COVID-19 related public health and social measures13. A full description of our
validation of the dataset is detailed in the Supplementary materials. We additionally included information
NPI implementation in the US from the Boston University School of Public Health US state policy database
15
. We included only compulsory NPIs implemented on a national (or state-level in US) scale and validated
timelines by cross-referencing dates with official governmental and health ministry announcements. A full
description of the timeline, sources and collection methodology can be found in the supplementary material.
In line with methodology used in previous publications8,9, we assumed the effect of household confinement
to supersede the effect of any other NPI implemented simultaneously and excluded any interventions
implemented after household confinement and prior to easing of restrictions. We defined the start date of
an intervention as the date on which the intervention was implemented and the end date as the date of any
successive intervention in the timeline. Based on the assumption of a 5-day latency period for SARS-CoV216, we included all events that had been implemented for a minimum of 5 days in the absence of any other
event. For interventions that are currently ongoing and where no successive interventions have been
implemented, we defined the end date as the date on which the analysis was conducted (May 31st, 2020).
We defined the date of easing of restrictions as the date at which any of the following was officially

announced: lifting of household confinement orders, opening of schools, opening of non-essential industry
activities and easing of limitations on gatherings.

Estimation and comparison of intervention specific Rt: We utilised the EpiNow R package, developed
by Abbot et al., to estimate the time varying daily reproduction numbers, Rt, from daily reported cases while
accounting for uncertainty in reporting delays, incubation period and generation time17. A full description
of the package and specifications used to propagate uncertainty are described in full elsewhere17. Following
the methodology described, a publicly available line-list of reported cases and time to symptom onset was
used to estimate uncertainty in the delay between symptom onset and case notification 18. We estimated
exponential and gamma distributions of time to symptom onsets for each confirmed case and binomial
upscaling was used to account for right truncation of notification dates. This same methodology was used
to estimate uncertainty in the serial interval. Assuming a normal distribution, parameters were sampled
from the reporting delay distribution and serial interval distribution were generated as described elsewhere
17
. Generation time was estimated as described by Ganyani et al.19 using an incubation period of 5-days16.
R0, the basic reproduction number was modelled with a gamma prior distribution using a mean estimate of
2.6 (sd: 2) based on early estimates from Wuhan17,20. Using the EpiEstim R package developed by Cori et
al.21, Rt was estimated from 1000 samples at each time point using parameter specifications as described 17.
As specified by Cori et al.21 the instantaneous reproduction number over time period measured by the
reproduction number is distributed with a gamma distribution, i.e.

Resulting in a posterior mean equal to

And a posterior coefficient of variation (CV, standard deviation divided by mean) equal to

Time varying daily Rt was estimated from the day reported cases exceeded 50 to May 31st, 2020 (Figure 1).
We calculated the average time varying daily Rt for each intervention period as well as the percentage
change in daily Rt from the start to the end of each intervention period. Linear mixed effects modelling fit
by restricted maximum likelihood was used to assess the relationship between the type and timing of
individual NPIs and changes in Rt. We compared the relative percentage reduction in Rt associated with
each NPI and the easing of restrictions by calculating the β-coefficient estimated marginal mean according
to the following formula:

Results
Global implementation of SARS-CoV-2 related NPIs
After the exclusion of all overlapping interventions, the final analysis consisted of 145 events from 26
countries and 34 US states (Figure 1). In the majority of scenarios, quarantine and isolation, limits on
gatherings and school closures preceded the implementation of household restrictions (Figures 1 and 2).
Universal facemask policies and mandatory quarantine isolation orders were often implemented in
conjunction with other interventions and as a result we were only able to evaluate the impact of these
interventions in 16% (N=10) and 33% (N = 21) of countries and states respectively (Table 1, Figure 1).
There was large variation in the timing of the implementation of NPIs across regions (Figure 1). In Europe,
where incidence has decreased in the majority of countries, 92% of countries (N = 11) have begun to ease
restrictions as of May 31st 2020. Comparatively, restrictions were still in place in African and South & Latin
American countries where incidence is still rising. This same pattern was not observed in the United States
where 71% (N = 27) of states included had begun to ease restrictions irrespective of marked decreases in
incidence (Figure 1).

Relative timing and effect of individual SARS-CoV-2 related NPIs
It was evident that NPIs clustered over time (Figure 2). We observed a negative correlation between mean
daily Rt and relative change in Rt over time, with higher mean Rt and a larger relative reduction in Rt
observed during NPIs implemented in the earlier months of the pandemic (Figure 2, A+B). We estimated
overall reductions in Rt associated with household confinement (23%), limits on social gatherings (10%),
school closures (12%) and mask policies (17%) (Table 2, Figure 2C). In cases where restrictions had been
eased, we estimated a range of impacts on transmission with Rt both increasing and decreasing (Table 2).
We additionally estimated an overall 12% (95% CI: 9-15%) reduction in daily Rt over time, irrespective of
intervention implemented (Table 2). We were unable to estimate plausible estimates for country, state or
regional effect sizes of the individual and overall impact NPIs.

In line with previous modelling studies8,9, we found that household confinement was associated with the
largest reduction in Rt. .In a time independent analysis, all other NPIs were associated with a higher Rt in
comparison to household confinement as a baseline intervention (Table 3A). When adjusting for the
combined impact of all NPIs (ie. the average change in Rt over time), the range of impact sizes for other
NPIs widened and in all cases included zero (Table 3B), supporting the effect of time evident in the first
step of our analysis (Figure 2A and B).

Discussion
We evaluated the impact of specific NPIs on reported SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in a global context. We
found a large variation in the timing and combination of NPIs implemented across all global regions. In 26
countries and 34 US States, we estimated a 23%, 17%, 12% and 10% reduction in the daily time varying
Rt as a result of household confinement, mask policies, school closures and limits on social gatherings
respectively. In agreement with current SARS-CoV-2 observational evidence11 and data from a recent
systematic review4, we found that earlier implementation of NPIs had a larger impact on the reduction of
Rt.. We additionally estimated an overall 12% reduction in Rt in all contexts where NPIs had been
implemented. The easing of restrictions had a heterogeneous effect, owing in part to restrictions being eased
in groups, making it harder to delineate the effect of lifting each NPI in turn
Globally, the majority of countries have implemented some type of NPI and we hypothesize that all have
experienced large-scale behaviour changes as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. As such we do not
have a suitable counterfactual scenarios to estimate rates of infection in the total absence of NPIs.
The overall 12% reduction in Rt, over time may be representative of the overall impact of sequential
interventions and general changes in behaviour 'snowballing' as global awareness increased, resulting in
the overall reduction in Rt regardless of the type and order of interventions implemented. In line with
assumptions informed by other studies4,8 and expert opinions9, we found that in the absence of any other
NPI, household confinement has the largest impact on reduction in Rt. In almost all cases, additional NPIs
were implemented prior to household confinements and as such, residual effects from these interventions
may contribute to strong reductions observed.
We were able to estimate plausible associated reductions for the above-mentioned NPIs and found a large
variation in the impact of quarantine and isolation and easing of restrictions. We reported an overall 23%
(95% CI: 18-27%) reduction in Rt as a result of home confinements in comparison to the 81% (95% CI: 7587%) estimated by Flaxman et al.8 The study by Flaxman et al included 11 European countries8, those first
affected by the pandemic where the majority had reached epidemic control by the end of May 2020 7. Our
estimate of the impact was informed by the same countries as well as countries affected later on the global
trajectory that have not yet reached a peak of infections and thus observed smaller reductions in R t during

intervention periods. Due to the large variation in impacts observed, we were unable to ascertain region and
country level specific effects to further investigate this relationship.
Current observational estimates of the potential impact of NPIs on SARS-CoV-2 are based on historical
interventions to control SARS and MERS outbreaks3,4 and the impact of NPI measured by real-time SARSCoV-2 reports13. While observational evidence supports the implementation of NPIs, estimates using
reported SARS-CoV-2 incidence are limited by a number of factors discussed later on. As such, dynamic
mathematical models with country specific demographics and infection parameters have been used to
estimate the individual impacts of NPIs on SARS-CoV-2 in China6,22, the UK23 and in Europe 7–10. Using
a mathematical model informed by region-specific smartphone mobility data, Lai et al. estimated the role
of local travel restrictions, identification and isolation of cases and social distancing measures in curbing
SARS-CoV-2 infection rates in China6. With a detailed timeline of region specific NPI implementations
and by estimating population mobility, region-specific contact patterns and resultant SARS-CoV-2
infection rates, authors concluded that lockdown alone would not have resulted in controlling infection in
Wuhan if not preceded by local travel restrictions6. They additionally noted the importance of the timing of
interventions, estimating that the implementation of NPIs a week earlier or later may have resulted in 3fold reduction or increase in observed cases respectively6. Flaxman et al. evaluated the impacts of NPIs in
11 European countries, accounting for the lag in case reporting by back estimating Rt from reported death
rates8. Due to the rapid succession of the implementation of NPIs during the beginning of the epidemic,
they were unable to estimate the individual impact of NPIs with the exception of lockdown measures.
Our analysis had a number of limitations. Firstly, our metric of comparison, the time varying Rt based on
reported cases, is sensitive to country level differences in testing coverage and strategies. In single country
studies, it has been difficult to accurately estimate true infection rates and Rt due to the large number of
asymptomatic infections that are assumed to go unreported24. Daily-confirmed cases do not give an accurate
depiction of the total infected population at a given point in time. Country and region-specific delays in
testing, in addition to differential delays between the reporting of positive and negative cases, result in a
lag between daily reported cases and the actual burden of infection. A combination of rapidly evolving
testing recommendations25,26, variations in laboratory processing capacities and, reagent shortages have
resulted in the implementation of a number of different testing strategies across countries and over time. It
is uncertain whether mass testing, shown to successful in the case of South Korea27, is feasible in other
contexts, and modelling studies indicate that in the absence of contact tracing, widespread testing will not
be sufficient in containing infection rates27,28.
Secondly, this study was limited by the epidemiological complexity of ascertaining the impacts of
individual COVID-19 NPIs implemented thus far. NPIs have been implemented with overlapping
timeframes, at varying levels of severity and have been adhered to with differing levels of compliance, even
within the same country. In order to account for this, we evaluated only interventions that had been
implemented in absence of any other intervention for a minimum period of five days. This criterion was
based on the conservative assumption of a 5-day latency period for SARS-CoV-2, although reports estimate
that an individual may be infectious for anywhere from 3-14 days16. Based on this, it may take up to two
weeks to observe the impact of any given intervention (or even longer taking reporting delays into account),
and therefore it is difficult to disentangle the immediate effect of an intervention and the residual impact of
an intervention implemented previously. In order to account for this and the above-mentioned limitations
of reported case data, we used a Bayesian methodology to model Rt with uncertainty in time to symptoms
onset, reporting delays and a range of estimates for the serial interval and generation time based on currently
available reports. These relationships are further confounded by static population-specific factors such as
age distributions, population density and distribution of underlying comorbidities that would contribute to
a differential rate of infections between countries. In addition to time-varying factors such as changes in
population mobility and case-importation rates that are not well documented, interventions themselves were
implemented at different time points in the global trajectory of the pandemic.

In agreement with what has been previously published4,7–11, we find that the implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) has been effective in reducing the acceleration of the COVID-19
pandemic on a global level and that earlier implementation of NPIs results in stronger reduction in
transmission. In comparison to studies based in European countries, we estimate a more conservative
overall impact of lockdown measures, likely driven by the inclusion of additional countries affected later
in the global trajectory of the epidemic. We find that this effect remains after controlling for time since first
100 infections. At this early stage we have been unable to quantify the impact of easing of SARS-CoV-2
restrictions or determine whether NPI implementation will result in epidemic control in countries where
cases are still rising. There is a need for continual assessment of the efficacy and optimal combination of
individual NPIs as more data become available.
