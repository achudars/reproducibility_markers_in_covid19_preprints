ABSTRACT
Background: Prisons in the United States have become a hotbed for spreading Covid-19 among
incarcerated individuals. Covid-19 cases among prisoners are on the rise, with more than 46,000
confirmed cases to date. However, there is paucity of data addressing clinical outcomes and mortality in
prisoners hospitalized with Covid-19.
Methods: An observational study of all patients hospitalized with Covid-19 between March 10 and May
10, 2020 at two Henry Ford Health System hospitals in Michigan. Clinical outcomes were compared
amongst hospitalized prisoners and non-prisoner patients. The primary outcomes were intubation rates,
in-hospital mortality, and 30-day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox-regression models
were used to investigate primary outcomes.
Results: Of the 706 hospitalized Covid-19 patients (mean age 66.7 ± 16.1 years, 57% males, and 44%
black), 108 were prisoners and 598 were non-prisoners. Compared to non-prisoners, prisoners were more
likely to present with fever, tachypnea, hypoxemia, and markedly elevated inflammatory markers.
Prisoners were more commonly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (26.9% vs. 18.7%), required
vasopressors (24.1% vs. 9.9%), and intubated (25.0% vs. 15.2%). Prisoners had higher unadjusted
inpatient mortality (29.6% vs. 20.1%) and 30-day mortality (34.3% vs. 24.6%). In the adjusted models,
prisoner status was associated with higher in-hospital death (odds ratio, 1.95; 95% confidence interval
(CI), 1.07 to 3.57) and 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.98).
Conclusions: In this cohort of hospitalized Covid-19 patients, prisoner status was associated with more
severe clinical presentation, higher rates of ICU admissions, vasopressors requirement, intubation, inhospital mortality, and 30-day mortality.

INTRODUCTION
In 2016, there were nearly 2.2 million incarcerated individuals in U.S correctional facilities.
Incarcerated individuals are among the most vulnerable for the outspread of infectious diseases due to
restricted mobility, overcrowding, confined spaces, limited resources and inequitable access to healthcare
services.(1,2) The first known case of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a U.S prison occurred in
mid-March at the Rikers Island Correctional Facility of New York City. Within few weeks, over 200
cases were diagnosed despite all efforts to curb its spread within the facility.(2) Since then, the outspread
of COVID-19 in U.S prisons continued to rampage, with no sign of a respite.(3) As of June 16, 2020, at
least 46,249 inmates in U.S. prisons were reported to have tested positive for COVID-19 and 548 died.(3)
Nationwide estimates for COVID-19 infection rates among prisoners are five times higher than in general
population.(3)(4) Despite this mortifying public health crisis, current federal and state-level healthcare
policies failed to respond adequately in a manner that would lead to “flattening the curve” in U.S
prisons.(1)
In the absence of an effective vaccine, physical distancing strategies remain the most effective
mitigative measure to halt the rate of COVID-19 spread. Such strategies were demonstrated to be
effectual during the Spanish influenza pandemic when early, sustained, and sweeping imposition of
public gathering restrictions in the 1918 managed to cease the flu’s death toll in cities across America.(5)
Yet, in situations where practicing physical distancing has not been attainable, infection rates and
mortality statistics can be astounding – as was seen on cruise ships (e.g., Diamond Princes cruise ship)
and nursing home facilities.(6) Similarly, physical distancing is practically impossible in the setting of
incarceration unless major shift in policies occurs. This challenge has led some local authorities in the U.S
to adopt depopulation measures to decrease the number of incarcerated individuals in prisons.

The State of Michigan has been a hotbed for COVID-19 spread among prisoners. With a total of
4,000 documented cases, Michigan ranks third across the nation with the number of COVID-19 cases per
10,000 prisoners.(3) The Michigan Department of Correction has adopted a strategy of universal
nasopharyngeal swab testing for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) for
all prisoners aiming to identify asymptomatic carriers. By the end of May, 2020, a total of 38,130
prisoners have been tested and 3,982 (10.4%) were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2.(7) Clinical
data about outcomes of prisoners with COVID-19 are lacking. In this study, we sought to report on the
characteristics and clinical outcomes of prisoners hospitalized with COVID-19 as compared to nonprisoners.

METHODS
1. Study Design, Settings, and Population
This was a retrospective cohort study of all consecutive patients hospitalized between March 10 and
May 10, 2020 and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on qualitative polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) assay
at two Henry Ford Health System hospitals. Patients evaluated at the emergency department without
being hospitalized were excluded. The first admission with COVID-19 was considered as the index
admission; data was extracted from the index admission while data from readmissions were disregarded.
The study was reviewed and approved by the Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) Institutional Review
Board (IRB). Patients included in the study were those hospitalized at two Henry Ford hospitals (i) Henry
Ford Allegiance Health: a 475-bed hospital located in Jackson county, Michigan and (ii) Henry Ford West
Bloomfield: a 200-bed hospital located in Oakland county, Michigan. Admission criteria and treatment
protocols were similar at both hospitals based upon healthcare system’s COVID-19 management
guidelines. Patients or the public were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting, or dissemination
plans of our research.
2. Data Collection
We collected patient-level data on imprisonment status (prisoner versus non-prisoner), demographic
characteristics (age, sex, and race), chronic medical conditions, smoking status, and obesity (determined
by body-mass index). Additional information included patient-reported symptoms, vital signs,
medications, laboratory findings, complications, and treatment outcomes. Reported clinical data were
linked to inpatient encounters during which a patient tested positive for COVID-19, or first inpatient

encounters that followed an out-of-hospital positive COVID-19 test. Upon hospitalization, COVID-19
testing was repeated to confirm diagnosis when initial positive COVID-19 testing could not be
documented. Follow-up information was obtained by contacting patients, families, or nursing home
facilities via phone. Prisoners’ follow-up information was obtained by contacting the healthcare staff at
the prison facilities.
3. Statistical Analysis
Characteristics of COVID-19 patients were compared according to imprisonment status (prisoners vs.
non-prisoners). For continuous variables, measures are presented as means and standard deviations (SD)
or medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs). Categorical measures are presented as percentages. The
prespecified primary outcomes were intubation, in-hospital mortality, and 30-day mortality. Each
outcome measure was assessed using unadjusted and adjusted models. Factors associated with in-patient
mortality and intubation were examined with the use of multivariable logistic regression models. Factors
associated with 30-day mortality were investigated with the Cox proportional-hazards models. Each of the
primary outcomes was examined using four models: (i) model 1: included imprisonment status only, (ii)
model 2: included imprisonment status, age, and sex, (iii) model 3: included model 2 variables, obesity,
and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score, (iv) model 4: included model 3 variables, respiratory rate,
lymphocyte count, platelets, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
c-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, procalcitonin, and d-dimer upon admission. CCI score was calculated
on the basis of 17 comorbid conditions, each of which is assigned a weighted score.(8) A higher score on
the CCI indicates a greater comorbidity burden. All model covariates were selected a priori based on
clinical relevance, demonstrated association with clinical outcomes in previous studies, or bivariate
analyses with outcomes.
Data for intubation and in-hospital mortality were complete for the whole cohort; while data for
30-day mortality was missing for 9 patients, all from the non-prisoner group. Patients with missing 30day mortality were not included in the Cox proportional-hazards models. Missing data for covariates were

handled with the use of multiple imputation. Multiple imputation models incorporated all available
baseline data. The following covariates were imputed in both the logistic and Cox regression models:
race, lymphocyte count, platelets, LDH, CRP, ferritin, procalcitonin, and d-dimer.
Results from the analyses of inpatient mortality and intubation are reported as odds ratios and
results from the analyses of 30-day mortality are reported as hazard ratios. The proportional-hazards
assumption for Cox models was investigated based on Schoenfeld residual method as well as graphically.
Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method to compare 30-day mortality between the
two groups. Log-Rank test was used to test equality of survival functions. A P value <0.05 was
considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed with the use of STATA 16
(State Corp LLC, College Station, Texas).

RESULTS
1. Characteristics of the Cohort
The first case of COVID-19 among prisoners in Michigan was identified on March 22, 2020; while
the first hospitalization for a prisoner in our hospitals was on March 25, 2020. A total of 706 consecutive
patients with COVID-19 were included in the analyses. Of them, 108 patients (15.3%) were prisoners and
598 were non-prisoners. The mean age of patients in the cohort was 66.7 ± 16.1 years, 56.5% were males
(98.0% of prisoners were males), 44.3% were Black and 48.0% were Caucasians. Overall, prisoners had a
higher CCI score (1.85 versus 1.57) and a higher prevalence of COPD, and underlying malignancies.
While, non-prisoners were older (67.7 vs. 61.2 years) and had a higher prevalence of chronic kidney
disease, obesity, and dementia. Comorbidities in both groups are detailed in table 1.
2. Clinical Signs and Laboratory Findings
The median time from self-reported onset of symptoms to admission was 6 (IQR: 3-8) days for
prisoners and 5 (IQR: 2-8) days for non-prisoners. Compared to non-prisoners, prisoners had worse
clinical signs at presentation, including fever (temperature ≥ 38.0 Celsius), hypoxemia (oxygen saturation
<94%), and tachypnea (respiratory rate >24/minute). Further, prisoners had markedly higher levels of
inflammatory markers upon admission, including CRP, ferritin, and LDH. Clinical signs and laboratory
findings upon admission and during hospital course are detailed in table 2.
3. Medical Treatment and Hospital Course

The median length of hospital stay was 8 (IQR: 5-12) days. A total of 141 of 708 patients (19.9%)
required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU); 26.9% of prisoners and 18.7% of non-prisoners.
During hospital course, 25.6% of patients did not require oxygen support, 41.6% required oxygen support
delivered via conventional nasal cannula, 16.4% required high-flow nasal cannula, and 19.9% required
intubation. Treatment protocol included anticoagulation (84.0%), corticosteroids (79.4%), antibiotics
(46.2%) for prevention/treatment of secondary infections, and hydroxychloroquine (64.8%).
Subcutaneous enoxaparin was the anticoagulant of choice in most patients (73%). Corticosteroids were in
the form of intravenous methylprednisolone (1-2 mg/kg/day). Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 inhibitor, was
given to 7.2% of patients at a dose of 400 mg intravenously based on clinic criteria. Other treatment
modalities include Remdesivir (compassionate use protocol) and Convalescent Plasma (part of Mayo
Clinic’s Expanded Access to Convalescent Plasma trial).(9) Of notice, more patients in the prisoners
group required pressure support with vasopressors to non-prisoners (24.1% vs. 9.9%). Details of
treatment modalities are shown in Table 3. Complications accompanying hospital course are shown in
eTable 1 (Supplement 1).
4. Intubation
Intubation and mechanical ventilation during the hospital course was required in 27 of 108 prisoners
(25.0%) and 91 of 598 non-prisoners (15.2%). Table 4 shows the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios of
intubation during hospital course. In the crude, unadjusted analysis, prisoners had higher odds of
intubation compared to non-prisoners (odds ratio 1.86; 95% CI, 1.14 to 3.03; P= 0.01). In the
multivariable logistic regression models, the odds ratios of intubation were 1.66 (95% CI, 0.96 to 2.86;
P= 0.07) and 1.16 (95% CI, 0.63 to 2.14; P= 0.64) in models 3 and 4, respectively (eTable 2, Supplement
1).
5. In-Hospital Mortality

In-hospital all-cause death occurred in 32 of 108 prisoners (29.6%) and in 120 of 598 (20.1%) nonprisoner patients. Mean time from admission to in-hospital death was 12.9 ± 6.6 days for prisoners and
10.4 ± 7.7 days for non-prisoners. Table 4 shows the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios of in-hospital
mortality. In the crude analysis, prisoners had higher odds for in-hospital mortality compared to nonprisoners (odds ratio, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.06 to 2.65; P= 0.03). Similarly, in the multivariable logistic
regression models (model 4), prisoners had approximately twice the odds of in-hospital death compared
to non-prisoners (odds ratio 1.95; 95% CI, 1.07 to 3.57; P= 0.03). Variables associated with higher inhospital mortality (etable 3 in Supplement 1) were increasing age, male sex, Caucasian race, increasing
CCI, elevated respiratory rate (>24/minute), elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (>250 u/L), and
elevated procalcitonin levels (>0.25 ng/ml). Imprisonment status was independently associated with
increased risk of in-hospital death (model 1).
6. 30-Day Mortality
Death within 30-day of follow-up occurred in 37 of 108 prisoners (34.3%) and 145 of 589 nonprisoner patients (24.6%). Mean time from admission to death was 13.7 ± 6.6 days for prisoners and 11.2
± 7.5 for non-prisoners. Table 4 shows the unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios of 30-day mortality. In
the unadjusted analysis, the hazard ratio of all-cause 30-day mortality was higher for prisoners compared
to non-prisoners (hazard ratio 1.41; 95% CI, 0.98 to 2.03; P= 0.06). In the adjusted time-to-event analyses
(model 4), prisoners had approximately twice the hazard of 30-day mortality compared to non-prisoners
(hazard ratio 1.92; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.98; P= 0.004). Variables associated with higher 30-day mortality
(etable 4 in Supplement 1) were increasing age, male sex, Caucasian race, increased CCI, and increased
respiratory rate (>24/minute). Figure 1 shows the Kaplan-Meier survival curve for mortality from
admission to day 30 of follow-up (log-rank test, P= 0.06).
The 30-day all-cause mortality for patients requiring intubation was 59.7% (71 of 119 intubated
patients died). However, there was a differential mortality based on imprisonment status amongst
intubated patients. The 30-day mortality was 88.9% for intubated prisoners compared to 51.1% for non-

prisoners. Comparing intubated prisoners to non-prisoners, the unadjusted hazard ratio for 30-day
mortality was 2.65 (95% CI, 1.61 – 4.40; P<0.001), while the age and gender-adjusted hazard ratio was
2.70 (95% CI, 1.54 – 4.68; P<0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival curve at 30-day follow-up among intubated
patients (log-rank test, P<0.001) is shown in Figure 2.
7. Disposition at Discharge
For non-prisoners discharged alive (479 patients), 75.8% were discharged to home, 20.0% discharged
to other facilities (skilled nursing or rehabilitation facilities), and 4.2% discharged to hospice homes. For
prisoners discharged alive (76 patients), clinically stable prisoners were discharged to quarantine units
within the prison facility (31.6%), while those requiring additional medical care (i.e., high oxygen
requirement) were discharged to a prisoner-designated hospital (68.4%), operated by Michigan
Department of Correction.

DISCUSSION
Despite more than 46,000 reported cases in the U.S, no reports to-date have investigated clinical
outcomes and mortality trends among prisoners hospitalized with COVID-19. In this study, we report our
experience on the comparative outcomes of 108 prisoners and 698 non-prisoners hospitalized with
COVID-19. Prisoner status was associated with approximately twice the risk of death compared to nonprisoners. Prisoners in our cohort presented from four local prisoner facilities located in Jackson and
Coldwater City in Michigan. In these facilities, positivity for SARS-CoV-2 was reported to range
between 38% (708 of 1,872 at one facility) and 55% (793 of 1,430 at another facility).(7) However,
precise estimation for hospitalization rates among COVID-19 positive prisoners was not feasible.
In our cohort, prisoners were more likely to present with signs consistent with Systemic
Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) and hypoxemia. Further, inflammatory markers at presentation
(e.g., CRP, ferritin, and LDH) were markedly higher in patients who are prisoners. The higher clinical
severity among prisoners could reflect a late reporting of symptoms or a higher threshold for referral of
COVID-19 patients from the prison facility to the hospital than that from the community. The Michigan
Department of Correction have adopted a pre-hospital scoring system to determine referral decisions.(10)
The scoring system is based on age, vital signs, oxygen requirements, and mental status (eTable 5 in
Supplement 1); only prisoners meeting the criteria of the scoring system were considered for

transportation to the hospital. On the other hand, the need for supplemental oxygen was the primary
deciding factor in admitting COVID-19 patients presenting from the community.
A higher percentage of prisoners than non-prisoners required admission to the ICU, pressure
support with vasopressors, and intubation. For both in-hospital and 30-day mortality, prisoners had
approximately 10% excess mortality rate than non-prisoners. Prisoners who required intubation had
strikingly dismal outcomes with 30-day mortality approaching 89%. The discrepancy in mortality rates
observed in the study population is multifactorial; while some are attributed to the demographic
characteristics and underlying comorbidity burden, others are inherently unique to the imprisonment
status. Incarcerated individuals bear a disproportionally higher burden of infectious diseases. Reports
have estimated that 25% of all HIV/AIDS cases and 35% of all hepatitis C virus cases in the U.S are
among incarcerated individuals.(11) Further, sepsis mortality rates were shown to be four times higher
among prisoners to that for non-prisoners (42.5% vs. 15.3%).(12)
In our cohort, prisoners were younger in age, predominantly males, and had higher prevalence of
COPD, diabetes mellitus, underlying malignancies, and a higher CCI score. COPD was overrepresented
among patients included in this cohort (14.6%) as compared to a reported prevalence of 2 – 6% in large
cohorts from New York, Louisiana, and China.(13)(14)(15) Moreover, a disproportionally larger
percentage of prisoners had underlying COPD compared to non-prisoners (37.5 vs. 10.5%) – reflecting
the higher prevalence of smoking in this group (80.1% were current or former smokers). Data on the
association between COPD and disease severity in COVID-19 patients remains scarce. A meta-analysis of
limited sample size suggests that COPD patients are at a substantially greater risk of more severe disease
and mortality.(16) Nonetheless, the discrepancy in 30-day mortality in our cohort remained remarkable
when comparing prisoner to non-prisoner patients without an underlying COPD (29.4% and 23.2%,
respectively).
The overwhelming majority of prisoners in our cohorts were males (98.2%). Sex-disaggregated
epidemiologic data across 38 countries have shown a significantly higher case-fatality rates for COVID-

19 among males.(17) Females have stronger innate, humoral, and cellular immunity resulting in sexspecific outcomes from viral infections.(18)(19) In animal models of mice infected with SARS-CoV-1,
higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-1 infection and greater infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages
into the lungs were observed in male mice.(20) Further, ovariectomized and estrogen receptor antagonisttreated female mice had increased mortality from SARS-CoV-1 infection.(20) These findings of sexbased differences in immune response and susceptibility can partially explain the excess mortality from
COVID-19 among prisoners.
The study has several limitations. First, the observational study design makes selection bias
inevitable, especially considering the potential discrepancy in hospital referral and admission threshold
between the two study groups. However, our findings remained largely consistent after controlling for
potential confounders related to demographics, comorbidities, clinical signs, and markers of disease
severity. Second, the study population was limited to one healthcare system in Michigan admitting
patients from certain prisons and communities, and therefore external generalizability requires validation.
Finally, presented findings were based on data extracted from the electronic medical records of the health
system, and hence, is subjected to the accuracy of documentation by the healthcare team, but the
outcomes were adjudicated and all patients discharged alive were contacted directly or through their
healthcare office.
In conclusion, our study provides insight into the disparity in clinical outcomes among prisoners
hospitalized with COVID-19. With COVID-19 becoming one of the leading causes of death in the U.S.,
findings on the association between imprisonment and COVID-19 mortality are alarming. Responding to
the outbreaks in incarceration facilities is uniquely challenging and failure to mount an adequate response
to ameliorate COVID-19 outbreaks in U.S prions has the potential to compromise the well-being of
prisoners, correctional workforce, and people living in the communities in which prisons are located.
Since physical distancing, the most effective mitigative measure, is constantly violated by prisons
overcrowding, major shift in policy towards enforcing ‘mass testing and segregation’ and prisons

depopulation (i.e., drastically reduce the population of prisoners) might be warranted to abort further
imminent outbreaks.(1) Nonetheless, maintaining the rights of prisoners for timely, adequate, and
equitable healthcare services is indispensable to close the gap in COVID-19 clinical outcomes with the

Figure 1: Survival Curve for Hospitalized COVID-19 Positive Patients, by Imprisonment Status.
Survival curve shows all-cause mortality for prisoners and non-prisoners (n= 697) hospitalized for
COVID-19. Graph is based on a Cox proportional hazards model. Sample size provided reflects 30-day
follow-up data availability; data for 30-day mortality was missing for 9 patients from the non-prisoner
group. Shaded Area Represent Pointwise 95% Confidence Interval. Log-Rank test for the survival curve
had P value of 0.06.
