Abstract
Background: There is a shortage of chemical reagents for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnosis and a surge of SARS-CoV-2 cases, especially in limitedresource settings. Therefore, the combination of an optimal assay kit is necessary.
Methods: We compared the ability to screen SARS-CoV-2 among three primer-probe sets in two
different master mixes, Invitrogen™ SuperScript™ III One-Step RT-PCR and LightCycler
Multiplex RNA Virus Master.
Results: The assay with TIB-Molbiol, IDT, and Phu Sa sets for LightCycler Multiplex RNA
Virus Master or Invitrogen™ SuperScript™ III One-Step RT-PCR showed positive results from
a single reaction of triplicate in the three days of 4.8 copies per reaction. R-squared and
amplification efficiency were 0.97 and ranged from 107 to 108%, respectively.
Conclusions: Our findings indicated that TIB-Molbiol, IDT, and Phu Sa primer-probe sets could
be beneficial for the laboratory screening of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR assay of E gene. There is
a need to consider the combination of these reagent sets as a new strategy to increase the testing
capacity of screening programs for COVID-19.

1. Introduction
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a threat to human health
which involves over 7,273,958 confirmed cases and 413,372 deaths [1]. While waiting for the
coronavirus vaccine approval, molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2 is one of the important
strategies to prevent and reduce the rate of infection by case identification, isolation, social
distancing, and proper treatment [2, 3].
Although many factors are leading to the low sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 such as a) detection
depends on the location of clinical specimens, b) low patient viral load, c) sporadic shedding, and
d) discrepancy in detection kits from various producers [4, 5]. However, the molecular diagnosis
of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR assay is a gold standard method [6-8]. Consequently, the
combination of an optimal assay kit is necessary because of the shortage of chemical reagents for
SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and the surge of SARS-CoV-2 cases, especially in limited-resource
settings.
In the present study, we aim to analyze the commonly used primer-probe sets, targeting E gene
of SARS-CoV-2 by the RT-qPCR assay for laboratory screening to increase testing capacity in
the context of thousands of overseas travelers returning to their countries.
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1.Primer-probe information
In this study, these three primer-probe sets based on the sequence information received from
three different companies, TIB-Molbiol (Berlin, Germany), IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies,
Skokie, Illinois, USA) and Phu Sa (Phu Sa Biochem, Vietnam) were used for comparative
analysis [8] (Supplementary Table 1).
2.2.Viral preparation
The infection assays were performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. Vero E6 cell lines were
infected with a clinical isolate SARS-CoV-2 [9]. After 72 hours, the virus medium was
inactivated at 65◦C for 1 hour. Viral RNA was then isolated from the culture medium using the
QIAamp viral RNA extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, German) following the manufacturer’s

instructions. The copy number of RNA extracted from SARS-CoV-2 strain was estimated through
a standard curve, which was published in a previous study [10].
SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated in this study is MT192773. The length of the genome sequence was
29,890 bp without gaps and high coverage 1,897×. This strain belonged to Betacoronavirus B
type and of 99.98% sequence similarity at the nucleotide level which was isolated in Wuhan
(MT019529), and >90.56% similarity with SARS-CoV isolated from pangolin (EPIISL410721).
There have been four mutations classified as nonsynonymous mutations such as G8388A (serine
to asparagine), A8987T (isoleucine to phenylalanine), and C10232T (arginine to cysteine) and a
synonymous mutation is G3778A, which was published in a previous study [9].
2.3.Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay
confirmation for SARS-CoV-2
RNA extracted specimens from the inactivated virus were tested for comparative assay of SARSCoV-2 by RT-qPCR on a LightCycler 480 or ABI 7500 system following the manufacturer’s
protocol (Invitrogen™ SuperScript™ III One-Step RT-PCR System or LightCycler Multiplex
RNA Virus Master). In this study, the reaction combination was prepared by multiplying the
volumes of each reagent in Table 1.

4. DISCUSSION
In this study, we reported the comparative analysis of laboratory screening for SARS-CoV-2
among three primer-probe sets in two different master mixes (Invitrogen™ SuperScript™ III
One-Step RT-PCR, and LightCycler Multiplex RNA Virus Master). The initial analysis showed
the combination of TIB-Molbiol, IDT, and Phu Sa primer-probe sets were quite sensitive to
positive results (4.8 copies/reaction) among Invitrogen™ SuperScript™ III One-Step RT-PCR
System (Table 7). In terms of LightCycler Multiplex RNA Virus Master, TIB-Molbiol, IDT, and
Phu Sa primer-probe sets also showed the same sensitivity (4.8 copies/reaction). The R-square of
each primer-probe set among the different master mixes were around 0.97, the findings were
compatible with a previous study [12]. Also, the values of AE in each primer-probe set among
different master mixes reach the accepted criteria of AE ranged from 90-110% [11]. These
findings could also contribute to gain better understandings of the combination of the best
reagents for SARS-CoV-2 screening to select the most optimum reagents to effectively halt
COVID-19.
The need for the optimum strategies aims to enhance testing capacity is a prerequisite because
there has been an increasing figure of false positives results of RT-qPCR that were reported in
the performs of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis for recovering patients and asymptomatic infected
patients [3]. Several recent studies reported the analytical sensitivity and efficiency comparisons
of SARS-COV-2 detection by several molecular assays with multiple primer-probe sets [3, 12-14].
Although RT-qPCR is appropriate for the large-scale diagnosis of viral infection in normal viral
load specimens, the RT-qPCR performance of each primer-probe set is different from others, and
various primer-probe sets have contextual amplification with SARS-CoV-2 negative
nasopharyngeal swabs [4], resulting in the inconclusive results. Because of the different

performances of each primer-probe set in RT-qPCR, the optimization for the design or selection
of the proper primer-probe set, the appropriate annealing temperature, the limit of detection for
the negative threshold determination could help to eliminate false positives or negatives once
designed for clinical diagnosis of viral infection [3].
On the other hand, RT-qPCR assays targeting SARS-CoV-2 depended on the high similarity of
SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-CoV as cross-react occurred. Furthermore, the less sensitivity of the assay
when collecting specimens in the early time points after admission[12]. Consequently, almost all
laboratories should locally validate diagnostic sensitivities and limit of detection values when
beginning these assays [13].
A recent study showed that the droplet digital PCR method could diminish the inaccurate results
in the low viral load specimens compared to RT-qPCR[15]. However, the possible false-positive
results or false-negative results arising from current standard RT-qPCR detection of SARS-CoV-2,
therefore, the improved choice of clinical practice could be a comprehensive approach about
molecular diagnosis, X-ray or computed tomography scan, serology test, along with the decision
by experienced clinicians in place of exclusively depending on RT-qPCR[15].
Several previous studies have also shown that the selection of the best primer-probe sets and
equipment for SARS-CoV-2 screening and diagnosis was an urgent and important solution for
prevention and control COVID-19 [12, 14]. Our findings found that these primer-probe sets in
two different master mixes were sensitive and reliable for laboratory screening of SARS-CoV-2.
Hence, these primer-probe sets could be beneficial for the laboratory screening of SARS-CoV-2
by RT-qPCR assay of E gene. It is crucial to improve the capacity of suspected case screenings
and to reduce the affected performance of the testing that yield false-negative results [16]. The
results of this study are a prelude for other studies to improve the testing capacity of screening
suspected cases.

5. CONCLUSION
Our findings indicate TIB-Molbiol, IDT, and Phu Sa primer-probe sets could be beneficial for
the laboratory screening of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR assay of E gene. There is a need for
considering the combination of these reagent sets as a new strategy to increase the testing
capacity for screening programs for COVID-19.
