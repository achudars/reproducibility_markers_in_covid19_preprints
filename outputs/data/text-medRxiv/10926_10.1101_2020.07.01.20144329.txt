ABSTRACT
Aim: To evaluate associations of plasma 25(OH)D status with the likelihood of coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) infection and hospitalization.
Methods: The study population included the 14,000 members of Leumit Health Services who
were tested for COVID-19 infection from February 1st to April 30th 2020, and who had at
least one previous blood test for plasma 25(OH)D level. "Suboptimal" or "low" plasma
25(OH)D level was defined as plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D, or 25(OH)D, concentration
below 30 ng/mL.
Results: Of 7,807 individuals, 782 (10.1%) were COVID-19-positive, and 7,025 (89.9%)
COVID-19-negative. The mean plasma vitamin D level was significantly lower among those
who tested positive than negative for COVID-19 [19.00 ng/mL (95% confidence interval [CI]
18.41-19.59) vs. 20.55 (95% CI 20.32-20.78)]. Univariate analysis demonstrated an
association between low plasma 25(OH)D level and increased likelihood of COVID-19
infection [crude odds ratio (OR) of 1.58 (95% CI 1.24-2.01, p<0.001)], and of hospitalization
due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus [crude OR of 2.09 (95% CI 1.01- 4.30, p<0.05)]. In
multivariate analyses that controlled for demographic variables, and psychiatric and somatic
disorders, the adjusted OR of COVID-19 infection [1.45 (95% CI 1.08-1.95, p<0.001)], and
of hospitalization due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus [1.95 (95% CI 0.98-4.845, p=0.061)] were
preserved. In the multivariate analyses, age over 50 years, male gender and low-medium
socioeconomic status were also positively associated with the risk of COVID-19 infection;
age over 50 years was positively associated with the likelihood of hospitalization due to
COVID-19.

Conclusion: Low plasma 25(OH)D level appears to be an independent risk factor for
COVID-19 infection and hospitalization.
INTRODUCTION
From its origin in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the novel coronavirus disease, COVID19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, has
spread rapidly throughout the world (1). In Israel, the first case of the COVID-19 infection
was reported on February 21, 2020. On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization
(WHO) declared COVID-19 disease a global pandemic (2). Immediate targeted action is
needed to identify risk factors of COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 virus has high levels of
transmissibility, estimated basic reproduction (Ro) ranging from 2.6 to 4.7, and an average
incubation duration ranging from 2 to 14 days (3). The main routes of transmission are
respiratory droplets and direct contact with contaminated objects and surfaces (4).
The status of the immune system is determined by a multitude of factors that may contribute
to the risk of a viral infection (5-16). Vitamin D is recognized as an important co-factor in
several physiological processes linked with bone and calcium metabolism, and also in diverse
non-skeletal outcomes, including autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes
type 2, obesity and cognitive decline and infections (17,18). In particular, the pronounced
impact of vitamin D metabolites on the immune system response, and on the development of
COVID-19 infection by the novel SARS CoV-2 virus, has been described (5-16). Vitamin D
deficiency has been recognized as a worldwide pandemic (19,20). We aimed to determine
associations of low plasma 25(OH)D with the risk of COVID-19 infection and
hospitalization, using real-world data. We hypothesized that the mean plasma level of
25(OH)D would be significantly lower and, accordingly, the rate of suboptimal plasma
25(OH)D would be significantly higher, among persons testing positive for COVID-19
infection, and among persons subsequently hospitalized, in a large population-based data
sample.

METHODS
We conducted a population-based study utilizing data from the Leumit Health Services
(LHS) database, a large health maintenance organization in Israel that provides services to
around 730,000 members nationwide. The comprehensive computerized database of LHS is

continuously updated with regard to demographics, medical visits, laboratory tests and
hospitalizations. The validity of the diagnoses in the registry is high for important medical
diagnoses and laboratory data (21-23). The study period was from February 1st to April 30th
2020. The study population included all members of LHS who were tested for COVID-19
infection during the study period and who had at least one previous test for plasma 25(OH)D
level (7,807 subjects). Referrals for viral tests were according to Israeli Ministry of Health
guidelines (March 2020). COVID-19 testing was done only by physician referral (based on
clinical criteria of exposure to confirmed COVID-19 patients or symptoms suggesting
COVID-19) using the AllplexTM 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene Inc., Seoul, Republic of
Korea) (24). According to LHS guidelines, blood was collected from fasting persons and
transported on ice to the Center Laboratory for processing within 4 h of collection using
DiaSorin Chemiluminescence assay (25-28). Data of each subject were collected from the
LHS computerized database and included age, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), weight,
height, body mass index, current smoking status, psychiatric and somatic comorbidities, and
hospitalizations as a result of the COVID-19 infection.
Definitions
All the somatic and psychiatric diagnoses were based on the International Classification of
Disease, tenth revision (ICD-10) codes and included chronic lung disorders (asthma, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease), diabetes, hypertension, depressive and anxiety disorders,
schizophrenia and dementia.
SES was defined according to a person’s home address. The Israeli Central Bureau of
Statistics classifies all cities and towns into 20 subgroups of SES. The classifications of one
to nine were considered as a low-medium SES, and ten to twenty were considered as
medium-high SES.
Obesity was considered as BMI>30 m2/kg.
According to Endocrine Society, National Osteoporosis Foundation, and International
Osteoporosis Foundation, the optimal 25(OH) D levels should be greater than 30 ng/mL (75
nmol/L), thus the plasma 25(OH)D level that is less than 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) were
considered as suboptimal and referred as "low" in our study (29-31) (see Supplementary
Table S1).
Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was conducted using STATA 12 software (StataCorp LP, College Station,
TX). The initial analysis compared demographic characteristics between individuals who
tested positive (COVID-19-P) and negative (COVID-19-N) for COVID-19. Student's t-test
and Fischer's exact χ2 test were used for continuous and categorical variables, respectively,
based on a normal distribution (0,1) and variable characteristics. The categorical data were
shown in counts and percentages. Data on continuous variables with normal distribution were
presented as means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The assumptions were based on twosided tests with α of 0.05.
Preliminary evaluation of risk estimates was conducted by stratified analyses. Subsequently,
multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI for the
independent association between low plasma 25(OH)D and a positive PCR test for the
SARS-CoV-2 virus, while controlling for potential confounders. The association of low
plasma 25(OH)D level with hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection was assessed among
those who tested positively for COVID-19.
Visualization methods
Open source programs, particularly, Plotly R Open Source Graphing Library was used.
Plotly's R graphing library was used for the production of figures, including scatter plots, area
charts, bar charts, and 3D charts.

RESULTS
Low vitamin D level and the likelihood of COVID-19 infection
Of 14,022 subjects, aged 2 months to 103 years, who were tested for COVID-19 infection,
1,416 (10.1%) had at least one positive result; and 12,606 (89.9%) had only negative results
(Figure 1). After excluding the 6,215 individuals without data on plasma 25(OH)D levels, the
study sample composed 7,807 (Figure 1). Also for this sample, the proportion of infected
individuals was 10.1% (782/7,807) for COVID-19-P, and 7,025 (89.9%) for COVID-19-N. In
a primary univariate analysis, COVID-19-P subjects were younger, and more likely to be
males and to reside in a lower SES area than were COVID-19-N subjects (Table 1, Figures
S1A and S1B, Supplementary Material). The mean plasma 25(OH)D level was significantly
lower for COVID-19-P subjects (Table 1), and the proportion with low vitamin D level was

higher (89.90% vs. 84.91%, p<0.001) (Table 2). The prevalence of dementia, hypertension,
cardiovascular disease and chronic lung disorders were greater among persons who were
COVID-19-N (Figure S1A, Supplementary Material) than those who were COVID-19-P
(Figure S1B, Supplementary Material) (p<0.05, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001) (Table 2).
Multivariate analysis, after controlling for the demographic variables, and psychiatric and
somatic disorders demonstrated an independent and significant association between a low
25(OH)D level and the increased likelihood of COVID-19 infection [adjusted OR of 1.50
(95% CI 1.13-1.98, p<0.001)]. The risk of COVID-19 infection was independently positively
associated with being male (Figure S1B, Supplementary Material) [adjusted OR of 1.49 (95%
CI 1.24-1.79, p<0.05)], aged older than 50 years (Figures S1A and S1B, Supplementary
Material) [adjusted OR of 1.56 (95% CI 1.26- 1.92, p<0.05)], and residing in a low-medium
SES city or town (Figure S1B, Supplementary Material) [adjusted OR of 2.06 (95% CI 1.652.59, p<0.001)]. Independent negative associations were observed between the risk of
COVID-19 infection and having a diagnosis of dementia [adjusted OR of 0.56 (95%CI 0.320.98, p<0.05], of cardiovascular disease [adjusted OR of 0.59 (95%CI 0.44-0.79 p<0.001]
and of a chronic lung disorder [adjusted OR of 0.58 (95%CI 0.42-0.79 p<0.001] (Table 3,
Figures S1A and S1B, Supplementary Material)).
Low vitamin D level and the likelihood of hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection
Among the COVID-19-P individuals, those who were hospitalized were older [58.69 years
(95%CI 54.78; 62.61) vs. 46.88 (95%CI 46.42-47.35)], and more likely to be male (47.8% vs.
41.3%, p<0.001) and to reside in a city or town of low-medium SES (73.64% vs. 69.45%,
p<0.001). The hospitalized compared to non-hospitalized individuals had a significantly
lower mean plasma 25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 level [18.38 ng/mL (95% CI 16.79-19.96) vs.
20.45 ng/mL (95% CI 20.22- 20.68), p<0.001]. In a univariate analysis, a low plasma
25(OH)D level was associated with an increased likelihood of hospitalization for COVID-19
infection [crude OR of 2.09 (95% CI 1.01- 4.31, p<0.05)]. In a multivariate analysis that
controlled for demographic variables and chronic disorders, the adjusted OR decreased
slightly to 1.95 (95% CI 0.98-4.84, p=0.061). Therefore, in this analysis, only age over 50
years was statistically significant associated with the likelihood for hospitalization due to
COVID-19 [adjusted OR of 2.71(95%CI 01.55; 4.78p<0.001] (Table 4 and Figure 3).

The main finding of this study was the low plasma 25(OH)D level association with COVID19 hospitalization risks, for patients tested positively for COVID-19, after adjusting for age,
gender, SES and chronic, mental and physical disorders. Hence, low 25(OH)D level was
identified as independently associated with the likelihood of COVID-19 infection. This
finding is in agreement with the results of other studies (5,7,9-16,20,32-44). Further, reduced
risk of acute respiratory tract infection following vitamin D supplementation has been
reported (45,46). Notably, a recent study from the UK (33-35) that included 449 subjects
(from the UK Biobank) with confirmed COVID-19 infection did not find an association
between vitamin D metabolite concentration and the risk of viral infections (47) as well as
COVID-19 infection (5,7,9-16,20,32-44). The discrepancy between those and our results may
be explained by a sample size of less than half in that study, the older population and the
inability to control for several confounders, like SES and chronic medical conditions.
According to our analysis, persons with COVID-19-P were younger than non-infected ones.
Two-peak distributions for age groups were demonstrated to confer increased risk for
COVID-19: ages 25 years old and 50 years old (Figure 4). The first peak may be explained
by high social gathering habits at the young age. The peak at age 50 years may be explained
by continued social habits, in conjunction with various chronic diseases (Figure 4). Other
clinical characteristics that were significantly linked to the likelihood of COVID-19 infection
included male gender and low residential SES (Figure S1, Supplementary Material). Despite
its being discussed as a risk factor in prior publications (48-50), obesity had not been
significantly associated with either an increased risk for COVID-19 infection or with
hospitalization due to COVID-19 in this study.
Surprisingly, chronic medical conditions, like dementia, cardiovascular disease, and chronic
lung disease that were considered to be very risky in previous studies (51,52), were not found
as increasing the rate of infection in our study. However, this finding is highly biased by the
severe social contacts restrictions that were imposed on all the population and were even
more emphasized in this highly vulnerable population. Therefore, we assume, that following
the Israeli Ministry of Health instructions, patients with chronic medical conditions
significantly reduced their social contacts. This might indeed minimize their the risks of
COVID-19 infection in that group of patients. The negative association with the current
smoking status is unclear and should be investigated, since recent studies show conflicting
data (38,53-64). Finally, in a subset analysis of only COVID-19-P subjects, hospitalized
patients were significantly older (58.69 vs. 46.88 years). Multivariate analysis showed that

being older than 50 years old was the single statistically significant risk factor for
hospitalization. To conclude, the low plasma 25(OH)D levels almost doubled the risk for
hospitalization due to the COVID-19 infection in the Israeli studied cohort.

Conclusions, strengths and limitations
The main strength of the study is its being large, real-world, and population-based. An
additional strength is the analysis of a multitude of variables that may affect the risk of
COVID-19 infection, independent of plasma 25(OH)D levels. However, the major weakness
of the study is the retrospective database design. Data regarding COVID-19 symptoms and
the hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection, and also adverse clinical outcomes (for
example, mechanical ventilation) will be further assessed. Moreover, a possible selection bias
arises in that vitamin D level was tested according to the presentation of symptoms, and not
according to population-wide testing. However, our previous study showed that poor health
function was not associated with low 25(OH)D levels (47). To conclude, our study found that
suboptimal plasma vitamin D levels may be a potential risk factor for COVID-19 infection,
particularly, for the high hospitalization risks, independent of demographic characteristics
and medical conditions. The finding is important, since it could guide healthcare systems in
identifying populations at risk, and contribute to interventions aimed to reduce the risk of the
COVID-19 infection. More studies are required, including assessment of the effects of
vitamin D3 supplements on the risk of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 infection.
