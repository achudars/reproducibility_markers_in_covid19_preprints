Per capita COVID-19 Case Rates are Lower in U.S. Counties Voting more Heavily
Democratic in the 2016 Presidential Election, except not in States with a Republican
Governor and Legislature

Abstract
In our recent paper Why do per capita COVID-19 Case Rates Differ Between U.S. States?
we established that U.S. states with a Democratic governor and a Democratic legislature have
lower COVID-19 per capita case rates than states with a Republican governor and a Republican
legislature, and case rates of states with a mixed government fall between the two. This
difference remained after accounting for differences between states in several demographic and
socio-economic variables. In a recent working paper The Changing Political Geographies of
COVID-19 in the U.S. it was found that that early in the pandemic U.S. counties at higher levels
of percentage Democratic vote in the 2016 presidential election had higher weekly per capita
COVID-19 rates, but that the situation was in the opposite direction by August 2020. We show
here that counties with a higher percentage of Democratic vote in the 2016 presidential election
have a lower mean cumulative per capita rate of COVID-19 cases and of COVID-19 deaths,
adjusted for county demographic and socio-economic characteristics, but only for counties in
states that currently have a Democratic governor and both chambers of the legislature
Democratic or in states that have a mixed government, but not for states that currently have a
Republican governor and both chambers in the legislature Republican. One possible contributor
to this difference is that some state Republican governments have restricted local action to fight
the spread of COVID-19.
Introduction
In our recent paper Why do per capita COVID-19 Case Rates Differ Between U.S. States?1
we established that U.S. states with a Democratic governor and a Democratic legislature have
lower COVID-19 per capita case rates than states with a Republican governor and a Republican
legislature, and case rates of states with a mixed government fall between the two. This
difference remained after accounting for differences between states in several demographic and
socio-economic variables. In a recent working paper The Changing Political Geographies of
COVID-19 in the U.S.2 by Krieger et al, the authors classified U.S. counties in five equal groups
according to the percentage of 2016 presidential vote in each county that was Democratic (or
that was Republican, or in terms of the difference between the Republican and Democratic
percentages – all three ways determine the same groups). They found that early in the pandemic
U.S counties in higher categories of percentage Democratic vote had higher weekly per capita
COVID-19 rates, and in an approximately graded manner, but that the situation was in the

opposite direction by August 2020. Their findings for weekly per capita COVID-19 death rates
were similar.
In this report we also analyze per capita COVID-19 case and death rates for the U.S. counties,
except we consider the cumulative cases and deaths through October 15, 2020. We adjust the
differences in COVID-19 case and death rates between the levels of county Democratic
percentage vote in the 2016 election by the same demographic and socio-economic factors
considered in our earlier paper. Further, because we already know about the differences in
COVID-19 rates between states according to party in power, we first assess whether the
association between COVID-19 rates and level of Democratic vote in 2016 differs by current
party in power.
Methods
We refer the reader to our earlier paper for details of our methods, which we only briefly
summarize here, and we also mention issues particular to the analysis of county data.
COVID-19 per capita case and death rates: The counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths through
October 15, 2020 are available from the same source as the state data, though data for the five
boroughs of New York City come from a separate data set there. The population denominators to
define the rates again come from the U.S. Census Bureau. We use the separate. Excluded from
our analysis are seven counties in the U.S. Census county list that do not have case counts, five
counties in the list of case counts that do not match the Census Bureau list of counties, and one
county (Trousdale, TN) that is an extreme outlier in case rate (21,817 per 100,000), leaving 3132
counties in the analysis.
County demographic and socio-economic characteristics: For percentage of people living in a
household with income below the poverty level; median income; percentage of the population
living in an urban area; population density (number of people per square mile); percentage of the
county population that is Hispanic of any race, and the percentage of the population that is
African-American and not Hispanic; median age; percentage of the population above the age of
25 with a bachelor’s degree or higher; and the percentage of the population aged 19-64 that is
uninsured, we use the same general Census Bureau sources for counties that we used for states.
Political status of the counties and states: As in the previous paper we classify states into three
categories according to the current party in power: those with governor and both chambers of the
state legislature Republican, those with governor and both chambers of the state legislature
Democratic, and the others, with mixed government. We also use the same source for county
vote totals for the 2016 presidential elections as we used for states, except for Alaska. The state
of Alaska does not present the actual presidential vote by county, but estimates of the county
totals are elsewhere available.3 We group this percentage Democratic of the 2016 presidential
vote into four levels. Because of the lopsided number of counties that voted Republican in 2016,
we do not use 4 equal groups of percentage Democratic vote, but choose the cutpoints for the

lower two groups to assure at least 100 counties in these groups in Democrat party-in-power
states.
Date: As previously we also consider adjusting for the date of first case in each county in the
case analysis and the median date of death in each county in the death analysis. For counties
without COVID-19 deaths we used the mid date between date of first case and October 15, 2020.
Analysis: The unit of analysis is U.S. counties. To study the association between vote in the 2016
presidential election and COVID-19 case rate in the counties it is important to control for the
county characteristics, in order to assess the level of association that is independent of those
characteristics. To this end we apply multiple linear regression of case rate as a function of the
county characteristics, the date variable, and the Democratic percentage of the 2016 presidential
election vote by county, grouped into four levels. Because of the high correlation between
percentage poverty, median income, and percentage with a bachelor’s degree, we replace these
latter two variables by their residuals from their prediction as a function of the other county
characteristics, including percentage of poverty. Because we have a large sample we are able to
include quadratic terms for the county characteristics and the date variable, and we retain terms if
they are statistically significant in the overall model or their exclusion changes the estimates of
the coefficients of the Democratic vote variables by more than 10%. Since we know from our
previous paper that case rate is associated with the party in power in the states, we also include
party-in-power variables. We first assess whether the association between case rate and county
Democratic percentage of the 2016 vote varies by party in power in the state. We do this by
including the relevant interaction terms in the model and then testing the interactions with a six
d.f. F-test. Since the interactions were indeed statistically significant, so that the associations of
interest do vary by party in power, we then fit separate models for counties belonging to each of
the different party-in-power groups, and present results only separately for these three groups.
The model directly estimates for each party-in-power group of states the mean differences
between the four levels of percentage Democratic vote in the counties for the 2016 presidential
election, adjusted for the county characteristics and the date variable. For ease of interpretation
we also estimate absolute adjusted means of case rate by percentage Democratic vote, using
predicted values from the model, with the adjusting variables set to their means. The analysis of
COVID-19 of death rates is similar, since the interaction terms were also statistically significant,
so that the results again differ between the three types of states.
We also confirm the results of the case analyses done with ordinary multiple linear regression
using a method well-suited to count data, namely a multiplicative (log linear) negative binomial
regression model using SAS Proc Genmod. Because there are 556 counties with no COVID-19
deaths we do not take this approach with death rate analysis.
Analysis was done with SAS 9.4, the figures were done with Excel (Microsoft 365).

Results
Table 1 shows the number of counties cross-classified by level of Democratic vote in the 2016
election and by party in power in the state to which the county belonged. Note that over half of
the counties, 1691, are in states with Republican party in power, while only 600 counties are in
states with Democratic party in power.

The final model for case rate included percentage Hispanic, population density, percentage
urban, percentage with bachelor’s degree (residual) and the date variable as linear terms, and
included percentage Black, median age, percentage uninsured, percentage in poverty, and
median income (residual) as linear and quadratic terms. The model for all 3132 counties also
included the variables for the four-level percentage Democratic 2016 county vote, the three-level
party-in-power variables, and the interaction of these variables. This model had R2 = 0.35 and
had statistically significant interactions (p < 0.0001), showing that the associations between case
rate and percentage Democratic 2016 county vote differed by state party in power. Thus, our
final models including the variables for the four-level percentage Democratic 2016 county vote
were fit separately by state party in power. Table 2 shows for each party-in-power group of states
the mean case rate differences between counties at each level of percentage Democratic vote in
2016 and those at the lowest level, adjusted for the other variables in the model, together with the
p-values to assess statistical significance (p < 0.05). For states with Democratic party in power
there is a strong graded difference in adjusted mean case rates, with counties having a higher
percentage Democratic vote in 2016 having a lower rate of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people.
For states with a mixed government there was also a graded association, though less strong than
with counties in Democratic-led states. For states with the Republican Party in power there was
no clear difference between counties at the four levels of percentage Democratic vote.

An alternative presentation of the same results except showing absolute adjusted mean case rates
instead of adjusted differences between levels of Democratic county vote is in Figure 1. The
figure confirms the findings of the previous paper, now at each level of the percentage
Democratic vote of 2016, that there is a graded decrease of cases per 100,000 people as one
moves from Republican to Mixed to Democratic-led states. The figure also illustrates the new
finding in this paper, that for two of the groups of states, Democratic (blue) and Mixed (purple),
as the county percentage Democratic vote in 2016 increases, the adjusted case rate decreases.
This is not true for the Republican states (red).

In the negative binomial modeling of case rate using the same variables as in the linear model,
the interaction model for all 3132 counties had R2 = 0.32 (after transforming back to the original
scale) and again had significant interaction terms (p < 0.0001). In the separate models of the
three state party-in-power groups of counties, the results were similar though somewhat stronger

than for the linear model. For example, the highest level of four 2016 percentage Democratic
vote groups had 54% (p <0.001), 69% (p < 0.001), and 101% (p = 0.854) of the adjusted case
rates as did the lowest level, for the Democratic, Mixed, and Republican state party-in-power
groups, respectively. Calculating ratios from the rates given from the linear model in Figure 1
we get similar percentages, 69% (p = 0.001), 76% (p < 0.001), and 101% (p = 0.931),
respectively.
The final model for death rate included percentage urban, percentage with bachelor’s degree
(residual), and median income (residual) as linear terms, and included percentage Hispanic,
percentage Black, population density, median age, percentage uninsured, percentage in poverty,
and the date variable as linear and quadratic terms. The interaction model for all 3132 counties
for death rate had R2 = 0.34 and also had statistically significant interactions ( p < 0.0001), again
showing that the associations between death rate and percentage Democratic 2016 county vote
differed by party in power, so again our final models including the variables for the four level
percentage Democratic 2016 county vote were fit separately by type of state party in power.
Table 3 shows for each party-in-power group of states the adjusted mean death rate differences
between counties at each level of percentage Democratic vote in 2016 and those at the lowest
level, together with the p-values to assess statistical significance. For states with Democratic
party in power, counties in the higher two levels of percentage Democratic vote in 2016 have a
lower adjusted mean rate of COVID-19 deaths per 100,000. For states with a Mixed government
there was a stronger graded association – the higher the counties’ percentage Democratic vote in
2016, the lower the adjusted COVID-19 death rate. For Republican-led states there was a
suggestion of an association in the opposite direction, though not statistically significant.

The alternative presentation of these results in terms of absolute adjusted mean death rates

adjusted COVID-19 death rates in counties with increasing percent Democratic vote in the 2016
presidential election is clear in the Mixed states (purple), less pronounced in Democratic-led
states (blue), and absent in Republican-led states.

County % Democratic in 2016 Presidential Election
Discussion

We have shown that counties with a higher percentage of Democratic vote in the 2016
presidential election have a lower mean cumulative per capita rate of COVID-19 cases and of
COVID-19 deaths, adjusted for county demographic and socio-economic characteristics and date
variables, but only for counties in states that currently have a Democratic governor and both
chambers of the legislature Democratic or in states that have a mixed government, but not for
states that currently have a Republican governor and both chambers in the legislature
Republican. One possible contributor to this difference is that some state Republican
governments have restricted local action to fight the spread of COVID-19.4
