Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has exceeded over ten million cases globallywith no vaccine available yet.
Different approaches are followed to mitigate its impact and reduce its spreading in different countries,
but limiting mobility and exposure have been de-facto precaution to reduce transmission. However, a
full lockdown cannot be sustained for a prolonged period. Evidence-based, multidisciplinary approach
on risk zoning, personal and transmission risk assessment on a near real-time, and risk communication
would support the optimized decisions to minimize the impact of coronavirus on our lives. This paper
presents a framework to assess the individual and regional risk of COVID-19 along with risk
communication tools and mechanisms. Relative risk scores on a scale of 100 represent the integrated risk
of influential factors. The personal risk model incorporates: age, exposure history, symptoms, local risk
and existing health condition, whereas regional risk is computed through the actual cases of COVID-19,
public health risk factors, socioeconomic condition of the region, and immigration statistics. A web
application tool (www.covira.info) has been developed, where anyone can assess their risk and find the
guided information links primarily for Nepal. This study provides regional risk for Nepal, but the
framework is scalable across the world. However, personal risk can be assessed immediately from
anywhere.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak originating in China in late 2019 has spread worldwide
claiming 1/2 a million lives[1], [2]. The rapid rate of human to human transmission of the virus has
threatened the health and livelihood of the entire world[3]. The World Health Organization (WHO)
declared it a pandemic on 11th March 2020[1]. Containment and quarantine of the virus contraction
have been the major tool to control the spreading in early stage, however, the increasing rate of infections
shown the limitations of this approach[4]. Several countries enforced strict lockdown to limit the spread
of COVID-19, such as Italy and Spain, or the during the initial phase of the outbreak as in Nepal[5].
WHO issued guidelines for responding to viruses prioritizing actions including maintaining hospital
facilities, raising public awareness, and stocking up medical supplies[6].
Public awareness of causative factors of COVID-19, the intensity, risk level, and its consequences could
help movivate people to adopt the required public health measures rather than ignoring or over-reacting
during this pandemic. A preliminary study from China showed several psychological consequences arising
during the COVID-19 pandemic[7]. Appropriate risk perception and communication could greatly help
in the management of fear and knowledge sharing during pandemic[8], [9]. To predict the most likely
scenarios, as governments and as individuals, the right tools need to be available.
Institutional and individual behaviour in society greatly affects the spread of infectious diseases[10].
Containment, contact tracing, and testing of infectious people should be prioritiesin the early stages of
the pandemic [11]. Several developing countries like Nepal introduced strict lockdown measures during
the early phase of the pandemic,, but still failed to control the spreading of the virus. Even after a long
2½ months of lockdown, new infections are mounting up[12]. Citizen and institutional/governance
awareness is always a key component in disaster risk reduction, something which is often lacking in lowincome countries[13].
Limiting economic activities to combat the pandemic have multi-dimensional impacts; increasing
economic uncertainties and exacerbating the vulnerability of the improvised community[14]. Demand
and supply chains all over the world have been disrupted[15]. United Nations (UN) agencies have
reported that lockdown in some low-income countries resulted in hunger and poverty [16], [17].There
needs to be a balace between conroling COVID-19 and maintaining economic activity including the
supply of food and essentials though it is challenging[18].
A personal and spatial risk assessment is required to cope with increasing challenges of the absolute
lockdown. It paves the way to open the essential operations in the low-risk area by providing safety
guidelines about the precaution measures that could fuel the socio-economy of the local community.
Personal and regional risk assessment is a systematic and scientific way, in near-real-time (daily basis) to
guide individuals and communities to take the appropriate decision. This is more effective in the
countries like Nepal, where the current transmission pattern of COVID-19 is sporadic as early COVID19 cases required the virus abroad with subsequent local transmission. Regular personalized risk indicator
and spatial risk zonation not only provides up-to-date information but also change the behaviour in risk
perception which could effectively be used to ease the strict lockdown measures in badly hit countries
[19], [20].

In this paper, we propose a framework for the COVID-19 risk assessment by incorporating the COVID19 cases, exposure, immigration (quarantined data), public health facility, and population density, to
access the regional and personal risk. We developed a near real-time COVID-19 Risk Assessment
(COVIRA) tool based on the proposed framework. The COVIRA incorporates the virus transmission
rate, public health risk, and population vulnerability, socio-economic status of the region, and importance
of the region in overall context for essentials production and supply. Additionally, personal risk
assessment provides individual vulnerability and risk of COVID-19 infection. Personalized risk
communication could support limiting the spread of the virus and ultimately provide a better way to exit
the pandemic. As, the personal, and regional risk computed through COVIRA reflect the recent scenario,
an appropriate measure can be taken to remain safe from the infection and bring the life of people to
normal as soon as possible.
Result
The COVIRA is a dynamic system for regional and personal COVID-19 risk assessment based on the
most recent data available. Results are presented in three segments; personal risk, regional risk assessment,
and zonal importance to provide the overall scenario of COVID-19 risk in real-time. Personal risk
provides the individual vulnerability towards this pandemic which will notifythe risk of : (i) an individual
getting infected, (ii) COVID-19 infection and (iii) being infected through regional risk. Regional risk
assessment provides COVID-19 transmission risk in the region, public health risk, socioeconomic risk
and the overall risk. One major aspect of managing exit from the pandemic is prioritizing essentialservices
by providing the regional importance maps and guidance. This would effectively be updated to guide the
community and individual when the government policy changes for the priorities during different stages
of a pandemic. All risk factors are normalized on a scale of 100 in the calculation.

Personal risk assessment
Age and existing health conditions are two major factors contributing to COVID-19 risk. Data analysis
from six countries (China, Italy, Spain, Germany, UK [United Kingdom] and USA [United States of
America]) provide a fair relationship of these factors in patients’ death. Age is exponentially correlated
with risk where underlying health conditions are contributing nearly 93% of overall death in UK and
USA. Data suggest that the older people are at high risk from COVID-19. A fraction of deaths to total
deaths in each age group and percentage of -non-survivors to total positive cases in corresponding age
groups, both indicate an almost similar trend, where death percentage of total positive cases promisingly
shows the exponential relationship with age as shown in equation 1. Data correlation between each
country is shown in methodology with more details on appendix from both perspectives.
𝑦 = 𝛼𝑒 𝛽𝑥 … … … (1)
Where, ‘y’ is a normalized risk factor; ‘x’ is the age in years (up to 90 years), normalized by mean 45.11
and standard deviation 27.32; α and β are coefficients having values (95% confidence level) 8.947 (5.955,
11.94) and 1.492 (1.272, 1.712) respectively; R-squared value of this relationship is 0.9538.

Underlying health condition from China[21], [22], the USA[23] and the UK[24] are also analyzed to find
the correlation of different underlying health conditions over the age due to COVID-19. Guan et al.[21]
reported total cases and severe cases, where Zhou et al.[22] reported total cases and corresponding deaths
associated with different underlying health conditions. Garg et al.[23] reported only hospitalization rates
of several underlying health conditions in different age groups. The UK data has been published by
Docherty et al.[24] reported a total of 16749 patients data with different symptoms and underlying health
conditions. Average of relative risk factors of different existing health conditions, comorbidities risk factor
(CRF) from available data are provided in Table 1, detailed data can be found in appendix.

Following the trend of percentage of deaths with an existing health condition to the different age groups,
another function (z) for a coefficient of comorbidity has been derived from UK data[25] as shown in
equation 2. Equation 3 provides total relative risk evaluation, COVID risk index (CRI) of an individual.
Figure 1 shows the risk curves of people with age for different comorbidities in a normalized scale of 100.

Where, coefficient values (with 95% confidence level) are, a = -3.40646579722815x10E-5 (-4.477e-05, 2.336e-05), b = 0.00672965343817772 (0.00563, 0.007829), and c =0.635624565570039 (0.6123,

Risk is communicated as a five-point Likert scale to express very high, high, moderate, low and very low
risk for an individual. Stratification of risk into five ranges is based on the distribution of the area under
the risk curve (Figure 2). Where risk under the curve with maximum risk is distributed equally. Table 2
shows the range of CRI to represent a different level of risk.

Probability of COVID infection for individual
Probability of COVID-19 infection has been assessied using exposure and local risk. A detail explanation
to calculate the exposure is discussed in the methodology. Probability of infection has been shown in a
five risk-levels on a linear scale (0-20-40-60-80-100). Assessing the symptoms of the patients reported in
recent studies[21]–[23], risk of having a positive case of COVID-19 in an individual is evaluated through
their response to the questionnaire in a web app. Fever, cough and shortness of breath are major

symptoms found in patients. Symptoms are only used to inform the respondent to contact to the nearest
health care facilities depending on the level of their risks associated with symptoms.

Regional risk assessment
Risk zones have been mapped through a multidisciplinary approach to evaluate the regional risk, which
is applicable for any region across the world. Public health risk, considering the underlying health
condition and health service facilities in respective of the total population of that area are mapped along
with socioeconomic risk level associated with COVID-19 as shown in Figure 3. The overall scenario of
COVID-19 risk and transmission risk throughout the country, considering the influential factors are
presented for pre-pandemic scenario. Figure 4 shows the relative risk maps of Nepal for overall risk of
COVID-19 and the transmission risk of COVID-19 on the pre-pandemic state.

Kathmandu is in the high risk zone for both transmission and overall risk, however, most of the other
areas with higher transmission risk are not associated with higher overall risk. Population exposure in
Kathmandu is also highest in the country, hence the government should prioritize and localize the
measures in the capital. CTR in southern boundaries are higher as it shares the open border with India,
other areas with highly dense population, having more locations of exposure such as hotels, airports are
in the upper side of the table.

COVIRA for risk assessment and communication
-COVIRA (www.covira.info) was launched by the Nepal Engineers Association on 21st June 2020. Results
are based on of data provided by the user questionnaire, designed for personal risk assessment. Address,
age, existing health condition, any current symptoms, exposure to infected persons were collected. Data
entered by an individual through multiple checkboxes are converted into scores which are then used to
calculate risk using the equations above. Personal risk values solely depend on the data provided by the
individual, but regional risk assessment, CTR will be the result of the risk in their locality. Result will be
provided on the web as shown in Figure 7. Personalized messages are displayed in brief on information
about risk and mitigation measures. Users can find the local risk in selected municipalities through the
navigation on the page.

Discussion
COVIRA framework would pave the way to move forward by minimizing the risk with no compromise
in public health. Results from the model showed good resemblance of COVID-19 transmission risk when
compared with no cases (right in Figure 4) and transmission risk on June 10th with cases over the country
(bottom left Figure 5). Hence, the cases are arising in the region where relative risks are higher and
spreading over the lower-risk zones.
For regions with very low risk, where no active cases have been found, a vigilance placed at the community
level can cautiously ease life from the nationwide lockdown. Regional importance and zoning of several
factors to sustain the minimum level of public life for the future, such as food and other essentials
production and supply, would guide the community to act responsibly. The use of this tool will also
greatly assist in easing tight lockdowns in places where mass testing is not . A risk assessment using the
tool will show those vulnerable in the region. It can also facilitate the entry of individuals into new zones
after mobility is restored in countries, based on knowledge of population at risk.
The COVIRA currently developed for Nepal generates bothpersonal and zonal risk with a current
scenario for adequate measurement and this tool can be scaled up worldwide. The two indicators for
personal risk reflect the chance of transmission, infection, and recovery under the stipulated
environmental and health condition. If the risk of transmission is high, one can limit one’s interactions
with other people, which reduces the exposure. However, if one has likely to have a low life-threatening
risk even if anyone gets infected with the COVID-19 they can continue their regular job with necessary
precautions. This could help the people remain aware of based on their risk factors. The system generates
the individual risk level along with public health advice to remain safe (see Figure 7). This way, a
community level risk is also possible to get once a large number of people participate in this system.
Quantitative risk assessment is a challenging process, but a good method for communicating and making
people aware of their vulnerability and risk due to COVID-19[26]. There is always a risk of entering the
wrong information in a crowd-sourced data collection tool. However, if someone enters the wrong
information and completes the assessment, it would only affect on their risk card since rRegional risk
assessment relies on the depth of data available at community level.
The regional/zonal vulnerability risk is dynamic as the input variables are not static as these include,
among others, the number of immigrants or COVID-19 positive cases. The COVIRA updates the
vulnerability condition as the input parameters change. Figure 5, (a) represents the base vulnerability risk
map, (pre-COVID-19), and Figure 5(d) is the latest vulnerability maps based on the updated COVID
infected cases and number of immigrants quarantined from abroad. Specifically, a large number of people
arrived from India after lockdown started and the majority of of newly identified COVID-19 infected
people in this population. The base vulnerability map depicts that the urban area/region with
international connections and regions bordering India have the highest base risk. And the total number
of infected people has increased significantly in these high-risk regions in the base risk map.
A recent study in Nepal shows “three in every five employees lost their jobs due to the COVID-19”, and
the resulting shardship could be even worst next year if total lockdown is continued[27]. Therefore, the
personal risk and zonal risk map can help some people to continue their daily activities, based on its
priority and risks. On March 24, when the Nepal government imposed the nationwide lockdown, there

was only one active COVID-19 patient and no casualty. Instead of taking a local approach, the
government imposed a nationwide absolute lockdown as its blanket approach, perhaps alocal approach
of containing the virus could have implemented for a better balance between health and socio-economic
consequences.
The scenario could change rapidly based on the infected condition, local activity, and the immigration
condition, data availability on time is always an issue. The reference data are taken from the high-income
countries (Italy, Spain, Germany, USA, UK) and China which are different from LMICs countries like
Nepal. However, the varying data sets of those countries well represent the risk scenario all over the world.
Methodology
Risk assessment is principally based on the available data, risk assessment in pandemics mainly rely on
daily updates on infected cases and recoveries. Main three sources of data are used; 1) recent updates
about COVID-19 (to find the relationships between potentially influential factors and to update the risk
map); 2) demography of health condition and facilities, socioeconomic and other static data; and 3)
questionnaire response in the app of an individual to assess the personal risk.
Data sources:
Published data related to COVID-19 cases from China[28] (n=1023), Italy[28] (n=1624), Spain[29]
(n=16680), Germany[30] (n=6512), the USA[31] (n=12998) and the UK[25] (n=20483) are used to
establish the relationships of different factors associated with the virus spreading and loss of life. The
individual risk depends upon age and underlying health conditions, however, other contextual
demographic classifications, as like ethnicity may further extend in different countries. Regional risk
assessment for most of the pandemic depends on population with an underlying health conditions, health
infrastructure facilities and services, water sanitation and hygiene status, poverty, literacy, population
density etc[32]. This study provides an example of regional risk assessment for Nepal, using the data
published in national reports[33]–[35]. Daily updates on COVID cases and quarantines are linked with
the Ministry of Health and Population web[12].

Personal risk assessment
Personal risk assessment consists of major three parts: 1) individual vulnerability ( danger to life when
infected with COVID-19); 2) risk of infection if symptoms exist and 3) risk of transmission to individuals
are being evaluated from their questionnaire responses.
Age and existing health conditions are two key factors for individual vulnerability. Distribution of death
of different age groups is further converted in relative scale from different countries. Death toll
distribution over the age group from the total death in the country and corresponding positive COVID
cases of the age group are analyzed. Figure 8 shows the normalized fatality rates for different age groups
from two perspectives; first column (a, b and c) shows the fatality rates in reported positive cases for each
age group where the second (d, e and f) represent relative death percentage of each age group in totality.
Interestingly, relative death percentages of age group to the total death and relative death percentage to
the confirmed cases of the corresponding age group show a very good correlation irrespective of sample
size and country except for China. Data from China show a lower percentage of death to total death in

the highest age group, however, the ratio of death to a positive case is highest in that age group. Equation
1 has been derived from death to positive cases percentage in age groups to represent the COVID-19 risk
factor.

residuals, d) normalized fatality percentage of total fatality reported, e) exponential curve fit to data of
‘d’ with 95% confidence boundaries and f) corresponding residuals.
Underlying health condition of the reported cases is also analyzed using the data those reported from
China[21], [22], the USA[23], and the UK[24]. Four sets of data are used to find the relative risk of
different existing health conditions, even though all data sets are not in a similar format, they support
each other in away. The major risk factor was established from the percentage of death and or severe
condition of patients with different underlying health conditions. Obesity has not been listed in data
from China but the USA and UK both have large numbers of patients even though the death percentage

is not clearly mentioned but is in nearly the same range of hypertension. Hence, the obesity risk factor is
assigned similar to hypertension. The chronology of data tables and calculations are provided in the
annex. The average of relative risk factors of different existing health conditions are provided in Table 1.
A recent study on gender effect on mortality rates due to COVID-19 suggested the higher mortality rate
for men (70.3% vs 29.7%)[36]. Hence, having the risk factor for male is 100, maximum risk factor for
female will be 42.24. Total risk evaluated will be multiplied by 0.4224 for female.
Individual vulnerability is now calculated through the weightage of age, gender and existing health
conditions. Recent data from the USA[23] and the UK[25](as of April 31) show the death percentages of
COVID cases with and without underlying health conditions are 89.3% (n=1,482) and 94.8%
(n=19,740). Following the trend of the percentage of deaths with an existing health condition in different
age groups, another function for the coefficient of comorbidity has been derived from UK data as
previously shown in equation 2.

Probability of COVID-19 infection for individual
Table 3 provides the relative percentage of patients having different symptoms from the data provided in
referred studies. Fever is the most common symptom where cough is almost found in a similar number
of patients, shortness of breath, fatigue, and sputum production are other major symptoms. Considering
the asymptomatic cases of COVID-19, providing the probability of having COVID-19 result is
challenging. Hence, if someone report any one symptom or combination of different sysmptoms,
recommendations will be displayed to contact to the nearest health care facilities.

In addition, exposure of any individual can be calculated through their profession, daily activities, travel,
and meeting with (a-symptomatic) COVID-19 infected people. Exposure and corresponding values are
shown in table in appendix. Now, considering the exposure and regional risk, the total probability of

COVID-19 infection risk will be calculated. Initial phase of Nepal cases as reported in media briefings
by Ministry of Health, very few of the people having positive case have symptoms. Hence, we proposed
the risk of COVID-19 infection as a product of local risk and exposure. Equation 4 provides the
probability of infection, where the upper bound value will be limited to 100, even if it exceeds.
Probability of COVID-19 infection = regional risk x exposure…… (4)
Exposure can be evaluated through the occupation, proximity to public and other persons and their day
to day safety measures. Studies from Italy[37], and six Asian countries[38] suggested the risk levels for
different work groups, where drivers and health workers have an higher exposure. Exposure level in scale
of 0 – 100 are provided in Table 4 and Table 5 on the basis of these recent studies.

In addition, preventive measures including using of face masks, keeping physical distances, wearing sun
glasses in daily life reduce exposure and hence risk[39]. Hence, contribution in reduction of exposure
has been introduced as shown in Table 6 those on the basis of results presented by Chu et al.[39].
Differences in risk presented due to each preventive measures are directly used to reduce the exposure
level. Regular sanitization has also reduce the exposure, hence considering the minimum exposure level
(50); with all preventive measures, net exposure is nullified.

Regional risk assessment
A multidisciplinary framework to evaluate the regional risk has been proposed to provide support on risk
zoning. COVID-19 risk can be stratified into different levels based on COVID-19 transmission risk,
public health status and facilities and socioeconomic condition. Population with an underlying health
condition and older people are more vulnerable[40], hence those regions with different existing health
condition population are assigned score in a scale of 100. Available health facilities like hospitals, primary
health care centre, health posts and female community health volunteers are also relatively scored in a
scale of 100, throughout the country, in a proportion of the population.
Population with higher poverty levels are more vulnerable during the pandemic, loss of a job, shortage of
food could push them further down in poverty, likely to have poor nutrition, and loosening the immunity
power. Hence, the socio-economic index of the region has also contributed to the vulnerability of the
region, where literacy rates and water, sanitation and hygiene indexes are also used to further clarify the
risk scenario.
Regional food production capacity and type, major supply chain hubs and network are further categorized
with relative indices. Government guidelines and policies along the pandemic period may vary additional

parameters to consider in importance zoning. General components of the framework are shown in Figure
9. There is a lack of proper statistical data to calculate the factors for different components in the overall
risk calculation related to this pandemic, hence, a Delphi method has been used to propose the equations
[41], [42].

Figure 9 Framework and components for total COVID-19 risk evaluation
COVID-19 transmission risk
Human to human transmission of the virus poses higher risk where more positive cases are found, other
factors contributing to regional risk are, quarantined people in the region, who have visited or travelled
from high-risk zones; exposure of the region to other regions of high risk and the population density.
Equation 5 has been proposed for COVID-19 transmission risk.
CTR = [0.6*PCS+0.1*QNT+ 0.1* EXP+0.2*POD] … (5)
where, PCS = Positive case score
QNT = Quarantined people score
EXP = Community exposure score
POD = Population density score
PCS is calculated in a relative scale of 0 to 100, considering the total active cases in and nearby region.
Having zero cases, there will be no score of PCS but when the region witnessed any case then the risk
score starts from 50. The reason behind the benchmark of ‘50’ is that, any active case may infect further
cases in that community, hence assigned 50 for the first case, then risk will be increased in logarithmic
scale to be 100 when cases will match with total household in the community. The score matrix of PCS
for the region is calculated as shown in Equation (6). Figure 10 shows the scenario of PCS for number
cases for different administrative regions [Kathmandu (985,453), Pokhara (426,759), Lalitpur (284,922),
Machhapuchhre (21,868), Chame (1,129) and Narpa Bhumi (538)] with a maximum and minimum
population in the country. The risk transmission possibility of the active cases from an administrative
region to the nearby region is also considered. Most people from the boundary region could travel to the
neighouring region for shopping, work or tradeas there are no restriction on movement. All adjacent
regions of the index region having cases is considered the same active case to compute the PCS within

the 10km buffer. It is considered half in the administrative regions within another 10km from the main
region having active cases.
PCS=100 – log (a/b)*50/(log(1/b))…… (6)
Where ‘a’ is the number of active cases in the region ‘b’ is a total number of household. Average
household size of Nepal is 4.6[43], which is used to calculate the household numbers in each
administrative unit. The risk will be minimized over time if no cases are found in the considered
administrative zone. Considering the characteristics of COVID-19 as reported by Lauer etal., time of
probable exposure to the detection of the positive case is up to 60 days for most of the cases, however
very few are longer but less than 90 days[44]. Hence, Any administrative unit, considered in this study,
having null positive cases for 60 consecutive days, PCS will be reduced to 50% of its value and after
another consecutive 30 days (total 90 days) of no positive cases reports, PCS will be nullified.

Figure 10 PCS for different urban/ rural administrative regions on number of cases
The score for the quarantined people in the region follows the similar approach of the PCS. Exposure of
the region is scored based on facilities those use by the people out of the region, like hotels, airports are
considered. International arrivals include international airport and the other land and port immigration
points. Exposure score is tabulated in Table 7 for different facilities in the region.

Population density of the region linearly correlates with the prevalence rate of infectious diseases[45].
Hence, the score for the population density of the region is relatively linearly distributed throughout the
country with the minimum assigned score of 20.
Public health risk
People with different underlying health condition (UHC) and the low availability of health facilities (HF)
in the region are associated to the public health risk (PHR) of that region. People with different UHC in
the region are scored in a single value with the weightage factors as of Table 1. Hospitals, primary health
care centers, and health posts are assigned 100,10, and 1 respectively for each unit. Summation of unit
values in the region will be divided by the population in the region. Relative score on scale of 100 will be
calculated for each region. Both UHC and PHF are in relative scale of 100. Hence, considering only
20% would potentially get service to recover from critical stage, PHR is given by the equation 7.
PHR = UHC – HF*0.2 … (7)
Further assessment of public health in community can be extended with different pandemic and postdisaster scenario. Natural hazard and structural vulnerability, production and supply of medical facilities
and medicines along with managerial and social engagement can also be considered in the public health
vulnerability. For the scope of COVID-19, this study confined within the smaller boundary.
Socioeconomic risk
Socioeconomic risk (SER) for the pandemic is also considered in the integrated risk analysis. Poverty not
increases to the risk of hunger, but poor people are often not able to afford the required precautionary
measures. Lower literacy rate indicates the lower level of awareness and similarly lower index of water
sanitation and hygiene indicates the higher chances of spreading of the virus. Poverty index (PVI), literacy
rate (LTR) and water, sanitation and hygiene index (WASH) of the region are relatively scored in scale of
100. Awareness campaigns through media and community can increase the public awareness for even
simply literate people so it will be given lower factor, comparison to poverty and WASH which would not
change within a short time frame. Combining the factors, SER can be represented by the equation 8.
SER = 0.4*PVI + 0.2*LTR + 0.4*WASH … (8)
Regional importance
Food production and supply is the most important maintain general health and well-being in the
community, which ultimately support to fight the pandemic. Hence, major hubs of supply chain network
(SCN) are mapped for their importance in scale of 100 as shown in Table 8. Similarly, food productivity
(FOOD) of the region are also relatively scored. Rice, wheat and maize production are taken into account
with their planting and harvesting time which will be more crucial for that region. Additionally, supply
of fertilizers, seeds and other supporting materials should be available within the very short time frame.

We cannot postpone the farming of such crops by months or even weeks, it depends on the climate and
weather. Food production and supply chain, both are equally important, hence, regional importance
(REG) can be represented in separate maps.

Overall risk will be calculated by combining CTR, PHR and SER, on the other hand regional importance
will be mapped. CTR is the major component in total risk score (TRS), where PHR and SER will further
escalate the risk, as proposed in equation 9.
TRS = CTR*(0.6*PHR+0.4*SER)/100 … (9)
Conclusion
COVIRA, a risk assessment and communication tool has been designed to provide an overall risk
assessment framework for COVID-19. The tool has been tested for Nepal but can be easily adapted across
the globe, since risk factors are similar worldwide. The empirical models fitted through the the available
data sets of COVID-19 are used for evaluation of individual risk, considering major risk factors identified
into the historical dataset. Personal risk assessment through questionnaire provides the individual risk
and communicate the rules and guidelines for awareness. Regional risk assessment would support
government and community to act locally, which will give a clear way out to manage the risk wisely,
refrained from any compromise on public health. Specifically, the regional risk and transmission map
could help support essential supply chains at the time of absolute lockdown across the country. This
multidisciplinary, holistic approach of risk assessment and communication can be extended to any other
future pandemic and natural disasters.
