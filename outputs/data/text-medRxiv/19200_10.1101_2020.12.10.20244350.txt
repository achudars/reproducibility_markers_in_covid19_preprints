Abstract

25

Background

26

In the ongoing pandemic situation of COVID-19, serological tests can complement the molecular diagnostic

27

methods, and can be one of the important tools of sero-surveillance and vaccine evaluation.

28

Aim

29

To develop and evaluate a rapid SARS-CoV-2 specific ELISA for detection of anti-SARS-CoV2 IgG from

30

patient’s biological samples.

31

Methods

32

In order to develop the ELISA, three panels of samples (n=184) have been used: panel 1 (n=19) and panel

33

2 (n=60) were collected from RT-PCR positive patients within 14 and after 14 days of onset of clinical

34

symptoms respectively, whereas panel 3 consisted of negative samples (n=105) collected either from

35

healthy donors or pre-pandemic dengue patients. As a capturing agent full-length SARS-CoV2 specific

36

recombinant nucleocapsid was immobilized. Commercial SARS-CoV2 IgG kit based on chemiluminescent

37

assay was used for the selection of samples and optimization of the assay. The threshold cut-off point, inter-

38

assay and intra-assay variations were determined. The total assay time for this in-house ELISA was set for

39

30 minutes.

40

Results

41

The assay time was set at a total of 30 minutes with the sensitivity of 84% (95% confidence interval, CI,

42

60.4%, 96.6%) and 98% (95% CI, 91.1%, 100.0%), for panel 1 and 2 respectively, with over all 94.9%

43

sensitivity (95% CI 87.5%, 98.6%). Moreover, the clinical specificity is 97.1% (95% CI, 91.9%, 99.4%)

44

with no cross reaction with dengue sample. The overall positive and negative predictive values are 96.2%

45

(95% CI 89.2%, 99.2%) and 96.2% (95% CI, 90.6% 99.0%) respectively. In-house ELISA demonstrated

46

100% positive and negative percent agreement with ROCHE (Elecsys; Anti-SARS-CoV-2), with a Cohen’s

47

kappa value of 1.00 (very strong agreement), while comparing 13 positive and 17 negative confirmed cases.

Introduction

56

The current situation of the world is all about the war between the visible and invisible. Life has

57

to adopt a new normality due to the advent of an acute respiratory disease, COVID-19 (1). The

58

disease, emerged in December 2019 in China, has been evolved as a public health threat due to its

59

global spread (2), morbidity and mortality rate. The etiological agent of this is SARS-CoV-2, a

60

positive strand RNA virus, belonging to the beta-coronavirus family (3). The disease presents an

61

unprecedented spectrum in clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic, mild or quasi-

62

common-cold symptoms to severe complications requiring immediate medical intervention (4-6).

63

Droplet, airborne, orofecal and fomite transmission of this virus as well as direct contact with

64

symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals contribute to the rampant spread of the disease (5, 7).

65

The havoc brought down by the pandemic demands early diagnosis during the acute phase of

66

infection. Viral RNA detection by real time RT-PCR is the gold standard for early diagnosis (8).

67

This immediate step identifies acute illness facilitating disease management and restricting rapid

68

spread to some extent. However, collection of samples from suitable sites, sample transportation,

69

the constraints of efficient and trained personnel as well as well-equipped facilities and increased

70

false negative results of RT-PCR at later phase of infection disqualifies its sole implementation in

71

the field of SARS-CoV2 diagnostics (9, 10). Although other molecular based methods such as

72

isothermal amplification techniques or CRISPR-based technology are implemented and suggested,

73

are yet to be well-practised considering the cost-effectiveness (11, 12).

74

Though serological tests are not yet suggested for case detection by World Health Organization,

75

in order to reveal the scenario of the prevalent and past episodes, serological assay has to be of

76

prime importance (13, 14). Retrospective serosurveillance, not only enlightens with current

77

immune status of the exposed individuals, but also facilitates therapeutic action by selecting

78

convalescent plasma donor as well as to study the plausible outcome from the vaccine shoot

79

focused on neutralizing antibody (15). Mass screening of a population is required to move towards

80

relaxing COVID-19 restrictions. Decisions like ‘back to the work’ and school require timely

81

seroprevalence study. All these aspects necessitate highly sensitive and specific immunoassay (16,

82

17).

83

The key structural proteins of SARS-CoV2 include Nuclecapsid protein (NCP), Spike (S), Envelop

84

protein (E) and Membrane (M) protein. Of these the N and S proteins are highly immunogenic in

85

nature commencing generation of IgM and IgG antibodies (18). These proteins are now exploited

86

as suitable targets for developing several serological assays like Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent

87

Assay (ELISA) (19).

88

The nucleoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly immunogenic and detection of antibody against this

89

protein is found to be more sensitive compared to Spike (S) or RBD (20, 21). This study

90

characterizes an in-house ELISA targeting IgG antibody against full-length SARS-CoV-2

91

nucleocapsid protein (NCP). To our knowledge, it is the first indigenous ELISA that is rapid with

92

thirty minutes incubation time and possessing higher sensitivity and specificity. Three panels

93

comprising of a total of 184 samples have been considered for the development of this ELISA and

94

a comparative study has been done with Elecsys Anti‑SARS‑CoV‑2 which is based on

95

chemiluminescent assay.

102

specific antigen. 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, USA)

103

was used as colour developer suitable for peroxidase substrate (Wako, Japan) while 1.5 M H2SO4

104

(Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) was used to stop the colour developed by TMB-peroxidase and read at

105

450 nm using ELISA plate reader (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA).

106

Sample selection and panel composition

107

The assay was developed and evaluated using panels of serum samples as per the FDA guidance

108

documents “Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests During the Public Health Emergency

109

(Revised)” and FDA recommendation. Three panels of serum samples comprising in total of 184

110

were collected from 134 individuals with their proper consent. Panel-1 comprises of 19 RT-PCR

111

positive samples collected from fourteen COVID-19 patients within 2 weeks of their onset of

112

clinical symptoms of infection, while the second panel consisted of sixty RT-PCR positive samples

113

collected after 14 days of onset of symptoms from patients. Panel 3 included eighty one serum

114

samples from healthy donors collected between April to June 2020, while 24 samples were

115

collected from dengue positive patients before the outbreak of COVID-19. All the samples were

116

stored in -80 °C until further analysis.

117

Characterization of seropositive and seronegative samples by Commercial Kit

118

A total of thirty samples of which thirteen from COVID-19 RT-PCR positive individuals and

119

seventeen from healthy donors were characterized using one of the Food and Drug Administration

120

(FDA) EUA approved commercially available chemiluminescence immunoassay. Following

121

analysis two SARS-COV-2 IgG positive and two IgG negative sera were used for the development

122

of this assay.

A 96-well flat-bottom immunoplate (Extra Gene, USA) was coated with 100 µl/well of SARS-

125

CoV-2 specific recombinant nucleoprotein (0.125 µg/well) in coating buffer (sodium bi-carbonate,

126

pH >9) and incubated either at 37 °C for an hour or overnight at 4 °C. The unbound antigen was

127

then decanted followed by blocking with 100 µl/well of blocking buffer (PBS, 0.1% Tween-20,

128

2% BSA) and incubated at 37 °C for an hour. Following incubation wells were washed three times

129

with ELISA wash buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% SDS, 0.8% NaCl, distilled water)

130

and used for the assay.

131

Assay Procedure

132

100l of test serum at 1:100 dilution in diluent buffer (PBS, 0.1% Tween20, 1% BSA) was added

133

into each well and incubated at 37 °C for 15 minutes. One positive, two negative and two plate

134

controls (no serum was added) were added in each plate. After incubation, the contents of the

135

wells were aspirated and the plate was washed 5 times using ELISA wash buffer. 100µl of

136

optimized goat anti-human IgG conjugated with HRP was added to each well and then incubated

137

for 10 minutes at 37 °C. Following incubation, the plate was washed 5 times and 100l TMB was

138

added into each well and incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature. Further colour

139

development, 100l 1.5M Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4) was used as stop solution and the optical density

140

(OD) was measured at 450 nm using a Multiplex micro plate ELISA reader.

141

Standardization and optimization of ELISA procedure

142

The procedure was optimized for antigen, conjugate, TMB and stop solution used in this study by

143

checkerboard titration using the positive and negative control sera at different dilutions. The

144

positive and negative sera were diluted at 1:50, 1:100 and 1:200 and tested against different

145

concentrations of conjugate (dilutions 1:2000, 1:3000, 1:4000 and 1:5000) and coating antigen

146

(dilutions 1:50, 1:100, 1:200 and 1:400). From the multiple combinations, the optimum condition

Thirteen and seventeen serum samples from the panel 2 and panel 3, respectively, were tested by

181

Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay to determine and select sero-status as well as positive

182

and negative controls. The result calculated by the analyser showed that all tested RT-PCR positive

183

samples were reactive and the negative samples were non-reactive. Two positive controls (P1, P2)

184

and two-negative controls (N1, N2) were selected for the development of this in-house rapid

187

Highest signal to noise ratio for positive controls with acceptable background from the

188

checkerboard titration has been selected (Table 1). The optimal conditions for this ELISA include

189

coating well with recombinant nucleocapsid antigen (NCP) at dilution 1:200, blocking for 1hr at

190

37 °C, sample dilution of 1:100 and detection anti-human IgG antibody-conjugate at 1:4000

191

dilutions, render the best possible result. The total assay time required to perform this assay was

192

established 30 minutes.

Clinical Validation

207

The performance validation of the assay was conducted using serum samples collected from

208

nineteen (n-19) RT-PCR confirmed positive patients within 14 days of onset of clinical

209

symptoms, while sixty sera collected from COVID-19 RT-PCR cases at their convalescence

210

stages (>14 days of onset of clinical symptoms). Total one hundred and five (n=105) sera were

211

used as negative samples of which 81 samples from healthy donors and 24 samples from pre-

212

pandemic dengue positive cases.

213

In patients, whose samples are collected within 14 days of onset of symptoms, among 19 RT-

214

PCR confirmed positive patients, 16 showed positive IgG antibody titres to NCP with sensitivity

215

of 84.2% (95% confidence interval, 60.4%, 96.6%) (Table 3). Within 14 days the test agreement

216

between NCP ELISA and gold standard was found 81.4% (Kappa=0.814, p<0.001) (Table 3 and

217

Fig 1A), with positive predictive value (PPV) 97.1% and negative predictive value (NPV) 84.2%

218

(Table 4). While following the patients, seropositivity increased at day >14 and among 60 RT-

219

PCR confirmed positive patients 59 cases were detected with sensitivity 98.3% (95% CI, 91.1%,

220

100.0%), whereas the test agreement was 94.8% (Kappa=0.948, p<0.001) (Table 3 and Fig 1A),

221

with PPV and NPV 99.0% and 95.2%, respectively (Table 4). The overall test sensitivity is

222

94.9% (95% CI, 87.5%, 98.6%) (Table-3 and Fig 1B), with test agreement 92.2% (Kappa=0.922,

223

p<0.001) and 96.2% PPV and NPV (Table 3 and 4). To check the specificity and cross reactivity

224

we have run 81 sera from healthy donors and 24 from dengue positive samples. Among them

225

only 3 samples were misdiagnosed and the overall specificity was 97.1% (95% CI, 91.9%,

226

99.4%) (Table 3 and Fig 1A).

Discussion

247

On the context of the current pandemic situation, several serological tests based on either

248

chemiluminescence, lateral flow, neutralization or immunosorbent assay have been developed and

249

approved by FDA for emergency use (19, 22, 23). Eleven of these 58 serological tests are mounted

250

on the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay targeting either IgM, IgG or total antibody (19).

251

The biologics, biosimilars, and bio-diagnostics developed by different biopharmaceuticals and

252

biosimilar manufacturer to combat COVID-19, fall short to satisfy the global demand surpassing

253

in-land need. Different countries are thus inclined to manufacturing their own diagnostics to satisfy

254

national demand (24-26). Late-entrant countries in biopharmaceutical industry, like Bangladesh,

255

are now working towards developing their own biosimilar products, anticipating the forthcoming

256

situations when these countries will have to lose access to World Trade Organisation (WTO)

257

waiver as a consequence of leaving LDC category in 2024 (27-31). Bangladesh, with death toll of

258

6388 and a total of 447,341 infected cases (till 22 November, 2020) (32) has yet to implement any

259

immunoassay kit for the management of COVID-19 that meet the standard set by its drug authority.

260

Although, policy makers are giving emphasis on the implementation of proper immunoassay kits,

261

in-house assay kits to meet the demand are essential to manage the wreckage. The emerging

262

condition underpins our endeavour to develop an indigenous IgG-ELISA specific to COVID-19,

263

an approach to creating an opportunity to satisfy national and global demand.

264

This assay is mounted upon nucleocapsid as an antigen which provides increased sensitivity

265

compared to either Spike-1 (S1) or Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) for detecting early phase of

266

infection due to its primordial inception (21, 33, 34). High expression of NCP protein of

267

coronaviruses has already been reported during infection (35), which is not only B-cell immunogen

268

but also evoke cellular immune response in SARS infected patients (36, 37). Also, spike (S) gene

269

of SARS-CoV-2 has 76% similarities with that of SARS-CoV-1, which exhibits non-synonymous

270

mutations as the disease evolves over time (38-40). On the other hand, the nucleocapsid protein is

271

more conserved having 90% amino acid homology with SARS-CoV-1 (39) which affected South-

272

East Asian countries comparatively to a lesser extent (41).

273

For tropical and sub-tropical dengue-endemic countries (42) developing serological tests specific

274

to COVID-19 is quite challenging, for serological and symptomatological overlap between the

275

diseases in question (43, 44). Misdiagnosis of COVID-19 as dengue due to serological cross-

276

reactivity has already been reported in Indonesia (45, 46). Singapore (47) and Thailand (48) and

277

vice-versa for rapid COVID-19 antibody kits in India (49). To address the concern, our assay is

278

characterized including 24 dengue positive samples from pre-COVID-19 situation that are found

279

to be non-cross-reactive in our in-house IgG ELISA.

280

This assay system exhibited 100% sensitivity as well as specificity in relation with the commercial

281

kit. A total of 184 samples subsumed in the panels have been then assayed by in-house ELISA and

282

our assay exhibits a sensitivity of 84% for samples that have been collected within 14 days of

283

symptom onset, and reach to 98% for samples collected after 14 days. This finding is in accordance

284

with Long et al and others where the seroconversion for IgG peaked at 100% within 17-19 days of

285

onset of symptoms (50). Our study suggests the use of this in-house ELISA in early phase of

286

infection detection as well as in retrospective serosurvey.

287

Diagnostic settings, handling a surge of samples, require a time-saving, convenient test method.

288

The strength of our indigenous system lies here, assay time being optimized at total 30 minutes,

289

while currently available ELISA kits such as “Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG)” or

290

“BioRad Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab” require total of 120 minutes of incubation to perform

291

their assay (19). Spectrum bias, which may affect sensitivity calculation, is circumvented by

longitudinal antibody analysis of individuals whose sera have been exploited as positive controls.

293

(51). Also the positive panels comprises of multiple samples from three patients who exhibited

294

higher antibody titer for a long period which is mentioned in a previous study (52).

295

Certain limitations in our assay development exist that are to be addressed. Firstly, for cross

296

reactivity test, no known respiratory sample was assessed, and secondly, the cohort sample size

297

was actually inadequate to draw conclusions on samples collected within 0-14 days of symptom

298

onset.

299

In conclusion, this in-house ELISA demonstrates its usefulness for the early detection as well as

300

for serosourveillence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG that developed against nucleocapsid proteins. This

301

assay is easy to perform, cost-effective and results can be interpreted at 30 minutes of test run.

302

Moreover, this test showed comparable level of performance against commercial FDA approved

303

electrochemiluminescence immunoassay and detected IgG from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.

304

Hence, this SARS-CoV-2 NCP-IgG Rapid ELISA could be equally applied as one of the COVID-

305

19 early sero-monitoring tools all over the COVID-19 pandemic countries.
