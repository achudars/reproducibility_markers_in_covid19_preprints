The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 has caused
widespread transmission around the world. As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of
particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases
in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number
of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African
country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April,
and May following viral introduction.

We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and
America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each
African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the
estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported
case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached
or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under
two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be
1.5 and 1.0 respectively.

37

We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest
number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation
runs, Morocco and Algeria’s estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was
close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in
total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then
was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario.

42

Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections
far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the
further spread of the epidemic.

Background

47
48

In late December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified among patients presenting

49

with viral pneumonia in Wuhan city, China1. Since then the number of coronavirus disease 2019

50

(COVID-19) cases and deaths increased rapidly2,3, and the city was locked down by the Chinese

51

government on 23rd January 2020. By late February, there had only been limited importations from

52

and to places outside China4. However, new epicentres in Europe and America emerged shortly

53

thereafter, causing a second wave of importations that further accelerated the spread of the

54

pandemic4. Most countries have since then imposed travel restrictions to prevent further

55

importation of COVID-19 cases5. By 30th April 2020, over three million cases and 200,000 deaths had

56

been confirmed worldwide4.

57

A particular area of focus has been on countries in Africa, with worries about missed imported cases

58

and what the impact will be of widespread transmission given the other heavy health burdens in

59

these countries. The first confirmed case in Africa was reported in Egypt on 14th February 2020, and

60

two weeks later, the virus was found in sub-Saharan Africa with a reported case in Nigeria4. By the

61

end of April, over 37,000 cases had been reported in the whole of Africa, with substantial variation in

62

the reported cumulative incidence across different countries4. This inter-country heterogeneity can

63

be due to a wide range of factors, such as the number of imported infections, the capacity to

64

conduct tests for COVID-19, surveillance efforts, as well as travel and movement restrictions which

65

vary widely from country to country depending on the local context5. The reported data alone thus

66

do not provide a clear depiction of the outbreak situation especially in countries with very limited

67

surveillance capacities, and additional studies are needed to narrow the knowledge gap between the

68

reported data and the real disease burdens.

69

Previous work has estimated the risk of importation from China at the early stage of the pandemic6,

70

assessed each African country’s capacity to respond to outbreaks6, systematically collated

71

information on the importation events reported by the sub-Saharan countries7, and projected the

72

spread of the epidemic seeded by the early cases represented in the World Health Organization

73

Situation Reports8. It is still unclear how many infections may have been introduced to Africa from

74

the new epicentres in Europe and America, although the reported case data do suggest that the size

75

of this second wave of importations has been much larger than the first wave of importations from

76

China7. In this study, we aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from the major

77

epicentres in Europe and America, and the magnitude of onward spread in each African country.

78

This method is insensitive to the different testing and reporting systems that are in place in different

79

countries.

Methods

82

Data

83

Case data

84

We collated data on the daily number of imported cases in Singapore reported by 31st March from

85

the following 12 epicentres: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain,

86

Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, and United States, which accounted for over 90% of

87

Singapore’s reported number of imported cases from countries outside of Asia9. These data will be

88

used later to estimate the number of imported cases in Africa. In addition, we obtained the total

89

number of cases (imported and autochthonous combined) reported by each African country by end

90

of March and April from the World Health Organization’s situation reports4.

91

Government response data

92

For each country, we collated the date on which each of the following policies came into force: (1)

93

banning non-citizens and non-residents from entry (the start date could vary depending on the

94

epicentre country from which a visitor arrived); (2) mandatory (self-) quarantine for travellers

95

arriving from each of the 12 epicentre countries mentioned earlier; (3) Stay-at-home order for all

96

non-essential workers (hereinafter referred to as “stay-at-home order”). We reviewed the following

97

sources: (1) country-level internal and international restrictions collated by the International SOS5,

98

(2) Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker10, (3) international travel restrictions collated by

99

the International Air Transport Association11, as well as (4) Wikipedia, where a separate page was

100

available for each country containing information regarding the government response. For each

101

Wikipedia page, we manually reviewed the online reports listed in the references to exclude data

102

with unconfirmed or unreliable sources. If stay-at-home order came into force in different states of

103

the same country at different times, only the earliest date was recorded.

104

Travel data

105

We obtained the total number of air ticket bookings for each origin-destination route allowing for up

106

to two connections during March 2017 from the Official Airline Guide. This will be used later to

107

estimate the ratio of air passenger volumes between pairs of origin and destination countries, which

108

we assumed to be relatively stable over time.

112

For each African country 𝑟, we denote the daily number of air passengers that arrived from an

113

epicentre country 𝑒 by 𝑣𝑒→𝑟 (𝑡 = 𝑡𝑒 , 𝑡𝑒 + 1, … , 𝑇𝑒→𝑟 ), where 𝑡𝑒 refers to the start date of the

114

COVID-19 epidemic in the epicentre country 𝑒, and 𝑇𝑒→𝑟 refers to the last day that non-citizens and

115

non-residents travelling from country 𝑒 were allowed to enter country 𝑟. Each day the probability

116

that an air passenger travelling from country 𝑒 to country 𝑟 was an imported case is denoted by 𝑝𝑒 ,

117

which we assume to be dependent on both the origin country 𝑒 and time 𝑡, but independent from

118

the destination country 𝑟. Hence, the total number of COVID-19 cases imported from an epicentre

119

country 𝑒 to an African country 𝑟 by the time the travel ban came into force (denoted by 𝑀𝑒→𝑟

120

below) can be approximated using a Poisson distribution (Refer to the supporting information for

121

(𝑡)

(𝑡)

𝑀𝑒→𝑟 ~̇ 𝑃𝑜 ( ∑ 𝑣𝑒→𝑟 ∙ 𝑝𝑒 ).

122

𝑡=𝑡𝑒

123

We used the imported COVID-19 case data reported by Singapore as well as flight data to provide a

124

conservative estimate for 𝑀𝑒→𝑟 , under the assumption that Singapore, being one of the countries

125

with the highest surveillance capacity12, has detected all the imported cases. Owing to the delay

126

from infection to hospital admission, we considered all cases imported from country 𝑒 to Singapore

127

that were reported by date (𝑇𝑒→𝑟 + 9) (hereinafter denoted as 𝑆𝐺𝑒,𝑟 ) based on Linton et al.’s

128

estimated mean incubation period and time from illness onset to hospital admission13. We assumed

129

that the ratio between the daily number of air travellers from epicentre 𝑒 to country 𝑟 and to

130

Singapore remained stable in the presence of the changes in flight pattern in response to the COVID-

131

19 pandemic. This allows us to model 𝑀𝑒→𝑟 (and 𝑆𝐺𝑒,𝑟 ) as Poisson random variables with mean

132

parameters proportional to the numbers of air passengers travelling from epicentre 𝑒 to country 𝑟

133

(and to Singapore) using the March 2017 flight data (Refer to the supporting information for the

Here, 𝛽𝑒,𝑟 refers to the proportionality constant to be estimated using the reported value of 𝑆𝐺𝑒,𝑟

138

and flight data, and was assigned a uniform prior with support (0, 1). We performed Markov Chain

139

Monte Carlo to sample from the posterior distribution of 𝛽𝑒,𝑟 using the JAGS software14, with 20,000

140

iterations burn-in and 150,000 iterations thinned for a posterior sample of size 5,000. The posterior

141

sample for all the model parameters was then used to estimate the uncertainty distribution of the

142

total number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres to each country.

143

In March 2020, a spike in the number of cases imported from United Kingdom and United States was

144

observed in Singapore, which was partly due to the increase in the number of returning Singaporean

145

students studying overseas15. This change in flight patterns, however, may not be applicable to all

146

African countries. Therefore, to be even more conservative, we also derived the imported case count

147

estimates excluding United Kingdom and United States from the 12 epicentre countries previously

148

considered. The resulting estimates were subsequently used in the simulations of the onward spread

149

of SARS-CoV-2 to get our estimates of case numbers over time.

150
151

Simulating the onward transmission following importation

152

We performed 1,000 simulations drawing from our estimated distribution of the number of

153

imported cases to project the onward spread of SARS-CoV-2 in each country up to 31st May 2020 or

154

the date when we estimate 10,000 infections was reached, whichever was earlier. The time of

155

infection for the cases imported from country 𝑒 to country 𝑟 was simulated via resampling from the

156

reporting dates of the 𝑆𝐺𝑒,𝑟 cases, which was then shifted backwards by 9 days to account for the

157

delay from infection to hospital admission based on Linton et al.’s estimates13. To account for the

158

effect of quarantine measures on the onward transmission, we only included the estimated

159

imported cases who had acquired the infection prior to the mandatory quarantine of travellers

160

coming into force, so that the estimation of local SARS-CoV-2 spread is conservative. For each

161

country and each day, we followed Cori et al. and expressed the total infectiousness of the infected

162

individuals as the weighted sum of the past incident infections16, where the weight parameters were

163

derived from the cumulative distribution function of COVID-19’s serial interval based on Nishiura et

164

al.’s estimate17. The number of secondary cases produced by each COVID-19 case, in the absence of

165

stay-at-home order, was assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution with mean 2 and

166

dispersion parameter 0.588. Once the stay-at-home order came into force, we created two scenarios

167

for the percentage reduction of the reproduction number: (1) 25% reduction, and (2) 50% reduction.

168

To be conservative, we assumed that the stay-at-home order, once implemented, can be sustained

169

up to the end date of our simulations. We ran the simulation algorithm following Churcher et al.18,

170

and derived the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by the end of March, April, and

171

May respectively for each country. (Refer to the supporting information for the implementation

Results

174
175

We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest

176

number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 new epicentres in Europe and America (Table 1

177

and Figure 1). All of these countries had their lower bound estimate of the imported case count

178

exceeding 100 (Table 1). By contrast, nine countries (e.g. Lesotho, Eswatini, and South Sudan) were

179

found to have a very low risk of importation, with the upper bound estimate of the imported case

180

count below 10 (Table 1). In a more conservative scenario where United Kingdom and United States

181

were excluded from the list of epicentre countries, the estimated number of imported cases did not

182

change drastically for most countries, albeit with some exceptions such as Kenya, whose estimate

183

decreased from 97 (95% CI: 75–120) to 27 (95% CI: 16–41) (Table 1).

184

Based on our 1,000 simulations of the onward SARS-CoV-2 spread, both Morocco and Algeria’s

185

estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both

186

scenarios that we considered (Figures 2A, 2D), whilst the reported total number of cases in each

187

country by end of March was ~500 (Figure 2G). Under the assumption that stay-at-home order

188

reduces the reproduction number to 1.5, we found four African countries where the estimated

189

probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was higher than 50% (Figure 2A). This

190

number quickly rose to 34 countries reaching this number of infections by the end of April, and 47

191

countries by end May (Figures 2B, 2C). For the alternative scenario where the reproduction number

192

is reduced to 1.0 by stay-at-home order, the numbers of African countries with a higher-than-50%

193

estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March, April, and May were 3, 23, and

194

32 respectively (Figures 2D–2F). Notably, four countries (Angola, Gambia, Mozambique, and Sao

195

Tome and Principe) were found to have reported less than 100 cases by end of April whilst the

196

estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the

197

more optimistic scenario (Figures 2E, 2H), suggesting that a very substantial number of cases may

198

have been undetected. The percentiles of the uncertainty distribution for the date by which 10,000

199

infections are reached in each country under the two scenarios were shown in Table 2.

Discussion

201
202

Our study has estimated the size of the second wave of COVID-19 importations in each African

203

country from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America. This allows us to narrow the

204

knowledge gap between the observed and actual number of importations, so that the unfolding of

205

the epidemic seeded by the imported infections can be better projected especially in countries with

206

very low testing capacities.

207

In the first wave of importations of infections from Wuhan, China, to other places outside China we

208

estimated that most places at risk were in Asia, Europe and USA19. Though there were links between

209

China and African countries, these were fewer than those between China and the rest of Asia,

210

Europe and USA 19. The shut down in China severely curtailed continuing importations out of China

211

and so these importations rapidly stopped.

212

Lower initial importations into Africa compared to Asia and Europe certainly tallies with what has

213

been seen. There have been very few reported cases in Africa in the first wave of importations, and

214

no reports of onward transmission. There was much discussion at the time whether the lack of

215

reported imported cases in Africa was because imported cases were not being picked up. This may

216

be some of the story, but our analysis would suggest that this was not the whole story, and it was

217

more that the early risk of importation into Africa was lower than other places19. However the

218

results we present in this paper estimate that this risk has dramatically increased with the spread of

219

the virus in Europe and the USA. This also tallies with what we have seen, as countries in Africa

220

started to report their first imported cases from Europe and the USA4. As of April 30th 2020, South

221

Africa had reported the highest number of cases at 53504, and we estimated South Africa to have

222

had one of the highest numbers of imported cases from the new epi-centres, although it was also

223

rated highest at risk in Africa of importations from China in previous analysis6. Senegal is one of the

224

countries for whom the risk has notably increased from the risk of importation from China as

225

estimated in previous analyses6,19. We only considered importations from the major epicentres in

226

Europe and America, and so the number of importations from all countries will be even higher.

227

Our study provides countries with information on the estimated timing of reaching 10,000

228

infections, which can be used for planning. Under the assumption that stay-at-home order reduces

229

the reproduction number from 2.0 to 1.5, our estimates suggest that a number of African countries

230

will reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections even earlier than the predictions of Pearson et al.8

231

This could be due to a number of imported infections being undetected and hence not reflected in

232

the situation reports, as well as the delay from infection to reporting, both of which were accounted

233

for in our study. Notably, we estimated two countries in North Africa, namely Algeria and Morocco,

234

as having the highest probabilities of reaching 10,000 infections by the end of March, which may

235

have occurred even prior to the lockdown. Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa having the earliest

236

estimated timings of reaching 10,000 infections include Angola, Côte d'Ivoire, Senegal, and South

237

Africa. In countries where stringent social distancing measures have yet to be implemented at the

238

time of writing (e.g. Tanzania), the unfolding of the epidemic was estimated to be substantially

239

faster than previous estimates suggest8. On the other hand, we projected that countries such as

240

Seychelles will reach 10,000 infections later than Pearson et al.’s forecasts8 owing to the stay-at-

241

home order. The epidemic was found to be further slowed down in many countries when we

242

assumed the reproduction number to be reduced by 50% due to stay-at-home order.

243

Many countries in Africa have considerable experience in dealing with other infectious disease

244

outbreaks, most notably Ebola, and will be able to call upon that experience for COVID-19. Countries

245

hit in this third wave of transmission, including those in Africa have some advantage as there have

246

been a variety of responses from around the world from which to assess what to do or not to do.

247

However there will need to be consideration of how effective measures can be adapted to different

248

settings20. Issues such as high HIV prevalence in some countries, and a younger demographic may

249

both affect the cases and deaths observed in different ways. This relationship however is yet to be

250

determined and there will need to be rapid research in countries in Africa to determine what the risk

251

of disease is in different populations and how best to respond in light of many other competing

252

health priorities.

253

Many countries in Africa are on high alert for incoming cases from Europe and USA, taking measures

254

such as quarantine of arrivals or shutting down travel from affected countries. This is a sensible

255

response given the vast amount of transmission on-going in these places. However as travel is either

256

maintained or reopened between countries closer by, risk of importations from other countries

257

should continue to be considered. Close attention should therefore be paid to where will be the next

258

epicentre, perhaps within Africa, and how this could translate into imported cases for each country,

259

particularly for those countries that we estimate to have experienced lower numbers of imported

260

cases previously and therefore lower onward transmission.

261

Not accounted for in our study currently is the impact of less stringent interventions on the local

262

SARS-CoV-2 spread, such as the effect of prohibiting large public gatherings, closure of social venues

263

and schools, and restrictions on inter-district travels. It is still unclear as to whether and to what

264

extent these interventions were effective in their local context, and hence in our simulations we only

265

considered stay-at-home order for all non-essential workers as an effective intervention to reduce

266

local transmission. Future modelling work considering the impact of different interventions in

267

different places will be vital for determining how each country can continue to respond.

268

In addition, we have made simplifying assumptions about the change in travel patterns in response

269

to the pandemic in each African country relative to that in Singapore, due to the unavailability of

270

2020 flight data. Despite these limitations, most of our model assumptions throughout the analyses

271

have been fairly conservative to avoid inflating the projections of the SARS-CoV-2 spread. For

272

example, the reported number of imported cases in Singapore was assumed to be complete, and the

273

risk of returning citizens carrying SARS-CoV-2 after travel restrictions came into force in each African

274

country was also not included. Simulations of the onward spread of the virus were based on the

275

estimated number of imported infections from the selected 10 epicentre countries, and stay-at-

276

home order was assumed to be effective (reproduction numbers being 1.5 and 1.0 in the two

277

scenarios we considered) and sustainable. In light of these conservative assumptions, any countries

278

found to have a high probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end March or April—especially

279

those with very limited cases detected—need urgent actions.

280
281

Conclusions

282
283

In conclusion, our study provides model estimates of the number of COVID-19 cases imported from

284

major epicentres in Europe and America to each country in Africa, as well as simulation results of the

285

onward epidemic spread. Our results highlight particular countries that are likely to reach (or have

286

reached) 10,000 infections far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of

287

resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.

Stay-at-home order was assumed to reduce the reproduction number to (A–C) 1.5 and (D–F) 1.0
respectively. Reproduction number in the absence of stay-at-home order in each country was
assumed to be 2. Reported total number of cases (G–H) were extracted from the World Health
Organization’s situation reports.

Table 2: Summary statistics for the estimated date by which 10,000 infections are reached in each African country. Reproduction numbers used for the simulation were 2.0 before, and 1.5
or 1.0 after stay-at-home order came into force in each country. Simulations were performed until 31st May, or 10,000 infections are reached, whichever is earlier, based on 1,000 model
runs.
