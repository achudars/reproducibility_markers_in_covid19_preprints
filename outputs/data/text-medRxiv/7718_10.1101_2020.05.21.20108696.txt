Abstract
Background: In this pandemic, it is essential for rheumatologist and patients to know the
relationship between COVID-19 and inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD). We want to assess
the role of targeted synthetic or biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (ts/bDMARDs)
and other variables in the development of moderate-severe COVID-19 disease in IRD.

Methods: An observational longitudinal study was conducted (1stMar to 15thApr 2020). All
patients from the rheumatology outpatient clinic from a hospital in Madrid with a medical
diagnosis of IRD were included. Main outcome: hospital admission related to COVID-19.
Independent variable: ts/bDMARDs. Covariates: sociodemographic, comorbidities, type of IRD
diagnosis, glucocorticoids, NSAIDs and conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs). Incidence
rate (IR) of hospital admission related to COVID-19, was expressed per 1,000 patients-month.
Cox multivariate regression analysis was run to examine the influence of ts/bDMARDs and
other covariates on IR.

Results: 3,591 IRD patients were included (5,896 patients-month). Concerning csDMARDs,
methotrexate was the most used followed by antimalarial. 802 patients were on ts/bDMARDs,
mainly anti-TNF agents, and rituximab. Hospital admissions related to COVID-19 occurred in 54
patients (1.36%) with an IR of 9.15 [95%CI: 7-11.9]. In the multivariate analysis, older, male
gender, presence of comorbidities and specific systemic autoimmune conditions (Sjoegren,
polychondritis, Raynaud and mixed connective tissue disease) had more risk of hospital
admissions regardless other factors. Exposition to ts/bDMARDs did not achieve statistical
signification. Use of glucocorticoids, NSAIDs, and csDMARDs dropped from the final model.

Conclusion: This study provides additional evidence in IRD patients regarding susceptibility to
moderate-severe infection related to COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
New SARS-CoV-2 causes a myriad of clinical signs and symptoms with analytic typical features.
As a whole, all characteristics are called COVID-19 disease 1, and it has affected millions of lives
worldwide.
A majority of COVID -19 patients present no symptoms or mild symptomatology. Other smaller
subgroup, shows progression to a moderate disease. A further subgroup apparently develops a
syndrome with autoimmunity and/or autoinflammatory features with critical/fatal outcomes
2,3

. In this sense, it seems that COVID-19 disease is having a particular incidence and severity in

patients with advanced age and comorbidities, mainly diabetes, hypertension, ischemic heart
disease, and previous respiratory diseases 4,5.
Serious infection is a well-recognized cause of morbidity and mortality across a number of
inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD). In this context of pandemic, it is essential for
rheumatologist and for patients themselves to know the relationship between COVID-19 and
IRD. Several guidance’s for the management of inflammatory rheumatic patients in this
scenario, based in expert opinion, have been performed, 6-8 as there is scarce epidemiological
research of the potential risk of IRD and/or disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
on COVID-19 disease and its severity. Few experiences from Italy and Spain have been
recently published, showing that patients with chronic inflammatory arthritis treated with
biologic or synthetic DMARDs do not seem to be at increased risk of infection nor respiratory
complications from SARS-CoV-2 compared with the general population 9-11. These preliminary
findings, if corroborated, could be very relevant and helpful for the IRD patient management.
The purpose of this study is to estimate the incidence rate of moderate-severe COVID-19
disease, globally and stratified by age, sex, type of diagnosis and therapy used in IRD patients
from our health area. Then, we want to assess the role of exposition to targeted synthetic or
biologic DMARDs (ts/bDMARDs) in the development of moderate-severe COVID-19 disease,
taking into account all other relevant parameters, such as age, sex, comorbidity, conventional
synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs), corticosteroids, NSAIDs and type of rheumatic diagnosis.

METHODS
Setting, design, and patients.
The setting is a tertiary hospital of the Public Health System of the Community of Madrid, the
Hospital Clínico San Carlos (HCSC), covering a catchment area of 400,000 people.
We performed a retrospective observational study, from the 1st of March 2020, (when our
health area had the first hospital admission related to COVID-19) to the 15th of April 2020. All
patients being attended at the rheumatology outpatient clinic of HCSC, whose data were

recorded in the health clinical record of our service (HRC Penelope), and with at least one visit
in the previous year, were preselected. We included all patients >16 years old, with medical
diagnosis (according to ICD-10) of inflammatory rheumatic disease including: a) chronic
inflammatory arthritis: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PSA), spondyloarthritis
(SPA), uveitis, Inflammatory bowel disease, Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and inflammatory
polyarthritis (IA); b) systemic autoimmune mixed connective tissue disease conditions:
Sjögren´s syndrome (Sjo), systemic sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD); systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE), polymyalgia rheumatic (PMR), vasculitis, Behcet´s syndrome,
sarcoidosis, polychondritis, autoinflammatory syndrome, antiphospholipid syndrome,
inflammatory myopathies and, primary Raynaud phenomenon. Those with loss of follow-up at
the time of inclusion were excluded.
The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical
Practices and was approved by the HCSC institutional ethics committee (approval number
20/268-E_BS).

Variables
The primary outcome was the development of moderate-severe COVID-19 disease defined as
hospital admission related to COVID-19 during the study period. This definition was based on
medical diagnosis +/- PCR diagnostic test. The independent variable was exposure to
ts/bDMARDs incluidng: a) anti-TNF alfa (Infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, certolizumab,
golimumab); b) Other Biologics: anti-IL6 (tocilizumab, sarilumab); rituximab (Rtx); abatacept
(Abata); belimumab (Beli); anti-IL17 / 23; anti-IL17 (ustekunumab, ixekizumab, secukinumab);
c) Jakinibs (JAKi: tofacitinib, baricitinib).
As covariables we considered: 1) Sociodemographic baseline characteristics including sex, age
and IRD duration. 2) Type of IRD: including chronic inflammatory arthritis and systemic
autoimmune conditions. 3) Baseline comorbidity described in table 1. 4) Other chronic
treatment for IRD: a) glucocorticoids, b) NSAIDs, c) csDMARDs incluidng: leflunomide (Lef);
methotrexate (Mtx); azathioprine or mycophenolate mophetilo (Aza), cyclophosphamide;
cyclosporine (Cpa); d) other csDMARDs inlcuidng: antimalarial (Am: chloroquine /
hydroxychloroquine); sulfasalazine (Ssz); and colchicine.
To consider patients were exposed to drugs, treatment had to start at least one month before
the beginning of the study, had to continue during the study period until the end of study or
medical admission for Am, glucocorticoids, Ssz, and NAIDs. Regarding Mtx, Lef, Aza, Cpa and
ts/bDMARDs, treatment had to start at least one month before the beginning of the study, had
to continue during at least 21st of March, end of study or hospital admission. In the case of
Rtx, the last infusion had to be at least on January.

Data sources
Patient sociodemographic, clinical, and therapeutic data were obtained through the HCR
Penelope. SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostic tests information were obtained from the microbiology
service of HCSC (n=5,577 patients with PCR test in the study period). Central Services of the
Hospital provided us all the HCSC admissions (n=1,146 in the study period). All information
from IRD patients was merged.

Statistical Analysis.
Patient´s characteristics were described as mean and standard deviation for continuous
variables, while proportions are shown for categorical variables.
Survival techniques were used to estimate the incidence rate of hospital admissions related to
CVID-19 (IR). IR was given per 1,000 persons-months with a 95% confidence interval [CI]. The
time of observation comprised the elapsed time from 1st March 2020, to the date of patient's
hospital admission, or end of study.
The incidence rate ratio of hospital admissions related to COVID-19 among IRD patients and
population from our heath area older than 16 years was assessed.
Cox bivariate analyses were done in IRD to evaluate statistical differences between hospital
admission risks and all variables. Cox multivariate regression model (adjusted by age, sex, type
of diagnosis and comorbidities) was run to examine the possible influence of ts/bDMARDs in
hospital admissions regardless other factors. In the model we also included glucocorticoids,
csDMARDs, and all other variables with a p<0.2 from the bivariate analysis. Results were
expressed as hazard ratio (HR) and [CI]. Proportional hazard assumption was tested using the
scaled Schoenfeld residuals. A two-tailed p value under 0.05 was considered to indicate
statistical significance.

RESULTS
IRD Patients description
3,951 IRD patients were included, with a total follow up of 5,896 patients-months. As we shoe
in table 1, many of them were women in their sixties. The most frequent diagnosis was RA,
followed by SPA, PMR, PSA and SLE. Regarding comorbidities, hypertension, dyslipemia,
thyroid disease and diabetes mellitus were the most prevalent. Concerning csDMARDs, Mtx
was the most used (n=1,461), followed by Am, Lef (n=333) Slz, and Aza (n=245). 6 patients
were using cyclophosphamide. 32% of the patients did not use csDMARDs, 47% were on
monotherapy and the remaining 21% used at least two concomitant csDMARDs (mainly
Mtx+Am; Mtx+Ssz and Mtx+Lef). Concerning ts/bDMARD (n= 802), 12.5% of them were on

monotherapy and the remaining 87.5% combined with csDMARDs. The most frequent were
anti-TNF agents, followed by Rtx.
Hospital admissions related to COVID-19 occurred in 54 patients (1.36%) during the follow-up.
76% were positive to PCR test, 5% were negative and in the remaining 19% the PCR test was
not performed.

Incidence rate of hospital admission related to COVID-19
The IR was estimated in 9.15 [7-11.9] per 1,000 patients-months. As expected, IR has been
increasing throughout the study: when we analyzed in fortnightly cuts, the IR from March 1 to
March 15 was 1.01 per 1,000; for March 15 to March 30 was 6.3 per 1,000; and for April 1 to
April 15 was 6.6 per 1.000 patients. In fact, IR in the period of March 15 to April 15 was higher,
estimated in 13 per 1.000 patients.
For IRD, the cumulative incidence of hospital admissions related to COVID-19 during the study
period was 15 per 1,000 patients, whereas the cumulative incidence for hospitalized patients
related to COVID-19 (n=1,059) in our health area (n>16 years: 325.900)12 was lower being
estimated in 3.2 per 1,000 persons (incidence rate ratio: 4.6 [3.4-6.1]; p=0.000).
As shown in table 2 the crude IR could vary depending on different variables. It was higher for
men than for women and in those older compared to youngers. It seemed lower for those
included in the chronic inflammatory arthritis group compared to those from the systemic
autoimmune conditions, with the exception of SLE. It was similar in patients with or without
csDMARDs. None hospital admissions were found for patients with Cpa, colchicine, nor
cyclophosphamide. Finally, concerning ts/bDMARDs IR was higher in patients on Rtx and lower
in patients using anti-TNF. None hospital admissions were found for patients with Abata, Sari,
Secu, Uste, Ixe nor Beli.

Bivariate analysis
As expected age, sex and several comorbidities, but also the use of glucocorticoids was
statistical associated to hospital admission related to COVID-19 in IRD. NSAIDs and
ts/bDMARDs did not achieve statistical significance, but had a trend (table 3). When we
analyzed separately other biologics, Rtx compared with the rest, had a trend of more risk of
hospital admission (HR: 2.2 [0.85-2.4], p=0.1). Regarding type of diagnosis, some systemic
autoimmune conditions had a trend of more risk of hospital admission except for SLE that had
lower risk (p=0.4). SLE versus chronic inflammatory arthritis did not reach statistical
significance (HR: 0.68 [0.16-2.8], p=0.59). However, other systemic autoimmune conditions
(not SLE) versus chronic inflammatory arthritis, achieved a trend of more risk (HR: 1.62 [0.942.8], p=0.08).

Multivariate analysis

In the final model, after adjusting by sex, age, comorbidities and type of diagnosis,
ts/bDMARDs did not achieve statistical significance compared to none use (table 4). Regarding
specific non-TNFs vs none, they did not reach statistical significance either (Rtx HR: 2[0.71-5.6]
p=0.190; Jakis HR: 2.6[0.3-19.3] p=0.3; and Tozi HR: 2.2[0.3-16.3] p=0.4).
Interestingly, glucocorticoids (HR: 1.46[0.8-2.5]; p=0.18), Am (HR: 1.3[0.6-2.8]; p=0.46), Ssz
(HR: 1.24[0.4-3.6]; p=0.6), Mtx-Lef-Aza (HR: 1.25[0.7-2.2]; p=0.4), and NAIDs (HR: 0.9[0.4-2.2];
p=8), dropped from the final model.
Concerning diagnosis, systemic autoimmune conditions vs chronic inflammatory arthritis did
not achieved statistical significance. When we categorized this variable in specific diagnoses
(we grouped RA-PSA as reference category based on syndromic similarity and incidence rates),
the final model did not change but we found some interesting results: Sjoegren (HR: 3[1.019.03]; p=0.04), Raynaud (HR: 4[1.2-13.7]; p=0.02), and polychondritis (HR: 111[1.5-91]; p=0.02)
increased the risk of hospital admission compared to RA-PSA and independently of other
factors. SLE (HR: 0.99[0.2-4.3]; p=0.8) did not achieve statistical significance. MCTD (HR: 2.5
[0.8-7.4]; p=0.09) achieved a trend or more risk, and the HR in rest of diagnosis did not differ
(p>0.2).
When analyzing the final model using as variables specific comorbidities instead of the
presence of comorbidities, lung disease (HR: 2.1[1.03-4.2], p=0.03), liver disease (HR: 3.1[1.28.0], p=0.01), and venous thrombosis/lung embolism (HR: 3.4[1.1-11.3], p=0.03) achieved
statistical significance.
The proportionality of these regression models was tested with a p value=0.7.

DISCUSSION
In this real-world longitudinal study of 1.5 months, we include a broad spectrum of inflamatory
rheumatic diseases treated with or without ts/bDMARDs, csDMARDs, and glucocorticoids.
With all this information, we have been able to estimate the incidence rate of hospital
admissions related to COVID-19 in ILD, but also to evaluate the influence of ts/bDMARDs,
csDMARDs, types of IRD, and other factors in the risk of hospital admissions related to COVID19.
This pandemic has had a great impact, especially in Madrid, with more than 41,304 hospital
admissions until first week on May 13. In this study we have been able to show the rising of this
incidence from March to April.
In our study, the IR of hospital admissions related to COVID-19 in IRD patients was estimated in
9.15 per 1,000 patients-months. When we compare the IR of hospital admissions related to
COVID-19 among IRD patients and the reference population, it seems that IRD have an

increased risk. Age, sex, therapies, and disease specific factors contribute form sure. Other
studies have compared the IR of IRD with their reference population without differences

. But they have compared PCR confirmed cases regardless the severity. Otherwise, two of

them

10,11

did not include patients with systemic autoimmune conditions. Moreover, the

incidence rate varies per regions and time period 10,11, 14-16.
Regarding ts/bDMARDs, the crude IR of hospital admission related to COVID-19 found in our
study was lower for those on Anti-TNF and higher for those with non-TNF biologics. But in the
multivariate analysis the sligthly statistical differences from the bivariate analysis dissapeared.
Interestingly only one hospital admission related to COVID-19 was found on tocilizumab, and
none were found on abatacept, anti IL-17/23 nor baricitinib. This may be promising, but we
should also bear in mind that the number of patients on these drugs were not sufficient to
draw specific conclusions. But, in agreement with other authors 15-17 ts/bDMARDs and mainly
Anti-TNF, do not seem to be associated with worse outcomes in IRD.
Another interesting finding of this paper, is that the crude IR of hospital admissions related to
COVID-19 differs among rheumatologic diseases, being somewhat higher in the systemic
autoinmune conditions. In the multivariate analysis, these differences remained statistically
significant for Sjoegren, polychondritis, CTMD, but also for primary Raynaud. Nevertheless, LES
had the same risk as RA-PSA without statistical significance. Other systemic autoimmune
conditions did not reach statistical significance, but maybe the number of patients was not
enough to find those differences.
Regarding other therapies, the crude incidence rates seems to be similar in patients with and
without csDMARDs, higher in those on corticoids, and lower in those using NSAIDs.
Nevertheless, after the multivariate analysis none of them remained statistically significant.
According to Favalli et al 16, it seems that Mtx, Lef or Aza do not increase the risk of hospital
admission related to COVID-19. In the case of Am, several autors have published its beneficial
effect for the acute treatment of moderate-severe infection related to COVID-19

18,19.

In

agreement of other authors 20, 21 we are not able to demonstrate the protective effect of the
chronic use of Am on moderate-severe infection related to COVID-19. Regarding
glucocorticoids, although the crude incidence rate was higher, they dropped from the final
model. Nevertheless, these results should be corroborated analyzing corticoids by doses.
Interestingly, we corroborated the role of age, male gender and comorbidities

in the

susceptibility to develop moderate-severe COVID-19 disease. Specifically liver disease, lung
disease and venous thrombosis/lung embolism achieved statistical significance in the
multivariate analysis. Ischemic vascular disease and diabetes mellitus only a trend and
hypertension, cancer or dyslipidemia did not achieved statistical signification. We do not have

to forget that data was recorded during routine consultations, with a heavy workload
environment, making easier the possibility of incomplete information mainly related to
comorbidity.
It is true that the PCR test should be required as a part of the main outcome definition.
However, in all admissions included, almost 20% of them did not have the PCR performed due
to a lack of available tests and or extreme health care overload at that time. Nevertheless, all
were reviewed being clinically compatible and managed as COVID-19. But, if we exclude these
cases, the real incidence of hospital admissions related to COVID-19 would be underestimated.
Another limitation is that we could have lost hospital admissions that have gone to other
hospitals. Two of them were rescued for analysis, and we think there won't be many more
considering the state of alarm and confinement decreed in Spain since March 14. As strengths,
we include 3,591 non-selected patients with a board spectrum of IRD, with not standardized
immunosuppressive therapy reflecting clinical practice from our health area, being able to
adjust for confounders.
To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date outlining the severity of COVID-19 in terms
of hospital admissions in IRD. It seems that patients with IRD could have a higher susceptibility
of moderate-severe COVID-19 disease compared to the general population, maybe at
expenses of systemic autoimmune diseases rather than chronic inflammatory arthritis.
Moreover, we have been able to analyze in greater extent the safety surrounding the
administration of disease modifying treatments. It seems that predisposition to develop
moderate-severe COVID-19 disease in IRD, is at expenses of the type of diagnosis, age, sex and
comorbidities, rather than the treatments exposed including ts/bDMARDs and csDMARDs.
