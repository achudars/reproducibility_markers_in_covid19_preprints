Abstract

24

Background: Estimating the prevalence of severe or critical illness and case fatality of COVID-

25

19 outbreak in December, 2019 remains a challenge due to biases associated with surveillance,

26

data synthesis and reporting. We aimed to address this limitation in a systematic review and

27

meta-analysis and to examine the clinical, biochemical and radiological risk factors in a meta-

28

regression.

29

Methods: PRISMA guidelines were followed. PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were

30

searched using pre-specified keywords on March 07, 2020. Peer-reviewed empirical studies

31

examining rates of severe illness, critical illness and case fatality among COVID-19 patients

32

were examined. Numerators and denominators to compute the prevalence rates and risk factors

33

were extracted. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed. Results were corrected for

34

publication bias. Meta-regression analyses examined the moderator effects of potential risk

35

factors.

36

Results: The meta-analysis included 29 studies representing 2,090 individuals. Pooled rates of

37

severe illness, critical illness and case fatality among COVID-19 patients were 15%, 5% and

38

0.8% respectively. Adjusting for potential underreporting and publication bias, increased these

39

estimates to 26%, 16% and 7.4% respectively. Increasing age and elevated LDH consistently

40

predicted severe / critical disease and case fatality. Hypertension; fever and dyspnea at

41

presentation; and elevated CRP predicted increased severity.

42

Conclusions: Risk factors that emerged in our analyses predicting severity and case fatality

43

should inform clinicians to define endophenotypes possessing a greater risk. Estimated case

Introduction

64

A novel corona virus, first identified in Wuhan, China in late 2019, resulted in a

65

pandemic by the first quarter of 2020, contributed by the prolonged survival of the virus in the

66

environment and extended length of pre- or post-symptomatic and potential asymptomatic

67

shedding. 1-4 While the virus is known to cause only a mild illness in a majority, severe illness

68

characterized by respiratory distress requiring hospital admission is not uncommon. 5

69

Furthermore, the virus has the potential to precipitate a life-threatening critical illness,

70

characterized by respiratory failure, circulatory shock, sepsis or other organ failure, requiring

71

intensive care. 6, 7

72

An extensive body of literature that emerged since the outset of the epidemic in China,

73

have examined the rates of severe and critically severe illness as well as case fatality associated

74

with COVID-19. However, the literature on COVID-19 has several limitations. First, due to lack

75

of awareness and limited availability of training and resources to confirm the diagnosis, failure to

76

recognize and code COVID-19 as the potential cause of morbidity and mortality may have

77

contribute to under estimation of the effects of COVID-19. 8 In fact, a recent estimate suggested

78

that approximately 86% cases of COVID-19 were not documented prior to January 23, 2020. 4

79

On the contrary, screening of only those who are at high risk may lead to over-reporting of

80

morbidity and mortality. Second, given that most datasets and publications are derived from

81

retrospective chart review, as opposed to prospective methods, high measurement error is

82

inevitable. 9 Third, the literature on the outcomes are originating mainly from tertiary care

83

settings, distorting the overall clinical picture. 10 Finally, including the same patients in multiple

84

reports examining the same research question without clearly indicating is a major lapse in

85

methodological and ethical standards. 11

86

As such, we aimed to conduct a systematic review of the available literature to identify

87

publications with minimal potential overlap, in order to estimate the prevalence of severe illness,

88

critical illness and case fatality among individuals with COVID-19 in random-effects meta-

89

analyses to enhance generalizability. More importantly, we aimed to adjust our prevalence

90

estimates by correcting for publication bias and underreporting. We further aimed to examine the

91

effects of clinical, biochemical and radiological risk factors moderating the between-study

92

heterogeneity of the severity and case fatality rates.

93

Methods

94

Search strategy and selection criteria

95

All procedures were conducted in accord with the Preferred Reporting Items for

96

Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed, Scopus and Web of

97

Science databases were searched on March 7, 2020 with the aim of identifying studies that have

98

been published in year 2020 examining the prevalence of severe illness, critically severe illness

99

and mortality associated with COVID-19 infection using pre-determined keyword combinations

100

(Table S1 in Appendix). No language restrictions were applied. Duplicate records were removed

101

and titles and abstracts were screened for pre-defined eligibility criteria (Figure 1) by two

102

independent raters (CD and CK or SC). Records published in Chinese were translated to

103

American English using Google translator and a native Chinese speaker (SC) examined the

104

original records in Chinese. Full-text manuscripts of records that were deemed eligible in the

105

initial screening were re-examined. All eligible full-text manuscripts were examined using the 9-

106

item Quality Assessment Tool for Case Series Studies of the National Heart, Lung and Blood

107

Institute by two study personnel.

Data were extracted from the eligible manuscripts into pre-defined data-fields. The data

111

fields included the total sample size and number of participants with severe illness, critically

112

severe illness and mortality. Severe illness was operationally defined as having either respiratory

113

distress with RR > 30 /min, resting peripheral oxygen saturation of < 93% or arterial partial

pressure of oxygen < 300 mmHg, requiring hospitalization. Critical illness was defined as having

115

respiratory failure, circulatory shock, end-organ failure or any combination of the above

116

requiring intensive care. In addition, the following variables were extracted as potential

117

covariates of the above outcomes. Central tendency (i.e. mean or median) and dispersion (i.e.

118

SD, SE, 95%CI, IQR or range) of age were extracted. When not reported, study level means and

119

standard deviations for age were imputed from the available statistics (i.e. median, IQR or

120

range). 12 Proportions of the following variables within a study sample were extracted: age < 18

121

years, age > 60 years, female sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart disease, chronic liver

122

disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy,

123

immunosuppression (e.g. HIV), smoking and pregnancy. Proportions of patients with specific

124

presenting symptoms (i.e. fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, headache, diarrhea),

125

asymptomatic cases, specific laboratory parameters (i.e. positive nucleic acid test for COVID-19,

126

leukopenia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase

127

(LDH), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), high

128

procalcitonin and high D-dimer based on reference ranges considered in each study) and

129

radiographic features (i.e. no lesions on CT, patchy consolidation, ground glass opacities,

130

peripheral distribution, and bilateral lung involvement or involvement of > 3 lobes).

131

Data analysis

132

Three separate DerSimonian-Laird random-effects meta-analyses were performed using

133

the ‘meta’ package (version 4.11-0) in R statistical software (version 3.6.2) to examine three

134

primary outcomes: the prevalence of a) combined severe or critical COVID-19 infection, b)

135

critically severe COVID-19 infection, and c) COID-19-associated mortality. 13 Studies with both

136

zero or 100% proportions were not excluded to ensure incorporation of all available data, which

137

is also known to ensure analytic consistency and minimize bias. 14 Consistency of the findings of

138

the meta-analyses were confirmed by leave-one-out sensitivity analyses. 15 Given that under-

139

reporting and publication bias could result in biased (i.e. smaller) prevalence estimates,

140

publication bias was examined using funnel plots and the effect-sizes were imputed for estimated

141

missing (i.e. unpublished / unreported) studies via the trim-and-fill method. 16, 17 The meta-

142

analyses were repeated including the effect-size estimates of these potentially missing studies in

143

order to obtain unbiased estimates of the three primary outcomes. Heterogeneity of effect-sizes

144

was quantified by calculating the Higgins’ I2 statistic for each meta-analysis. 18, 19 To explain the

145

heterogeneity of the studies 20, exploratory univariate random-effects meta-regression analyses

146

were performed to examine the moderator effects of each of the covariates described above.

147

Results

148

Results of database search, subsequent screening and eligibility assessment are

149

summarized in a PRISMA flow diagram (Figure 1). Out of 1,470 records identified in the initial

150

database search, 29 studies including data of 2,090 patients with COVID-19 were deemed

151

eligible. The proportions of females in the study samples ranged from 27.59-100.00%. The mean

152

age of the participants included in the studies ranged from 2-66 years. Four studies recruited

153

entirely on children and one study exclusively recruited pregnant women. The included studies

154

and their quality ratings are summarized in Table S2 with their references. The summary

155

statistics of all covariates are summarized in Table S3 in Appendix.

156

Pooled prevalence of severe or critically severe illness among individuals with COVID-

157

19 infection was estimated to be 14.6% (95%CI, 8.9%-23.1%) in the random-effects meta-

158

analysis (Figure 2a). Excluding any single study from the meta-analysis (i.e. leave-one-out

159

sensitivity analyses) did not significantly change the pooled prevalence estimate. However,

160

funnel plot of the effect-sizes was severely asymmetric, suggesting substantial underreporting or

161

publication bias (Figure 2b). Seven effect-sizes were imputed to correct for the publication bias.

162

When the random-effects meta-analysis was performed including these imputed effect-sizes (i.e.

163

after correcting for publication bias), the prevalence of severe or critical illness increased to

164

25.8% (95%CI, 17.2%-36.8%) (Figure 2c).

165

Significant heterogeneity was observed among the prevalence estimates of severe illness

166

(τ2 = 1.679; I2 = 94%, p < 0.001). Correcting for publication bias decreased this heterogeneity (I2

167

= 85%, 95%CI, 80%-89%), however, heterogeneity remained significant (p < 0.001).

168

Exploratory univariate random-effects meta-regression analyses conducted with the aim of

169

explaining the heterogeneity using the moderator effects of the considered covariates suggested

170

that each of increasing mean age (p = 0.006) and prevalence of age > 60 years (p < 0.001),

171

hypertension (p < 0.001), chronic kidney disease (p = 0.038), malignancy (p = 0.023) and

172

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p = 0.025) were associated with a greater risk of severe

173

or critical illness associated with COVID-19, while the prevalence of age < 18 years (p = 0.007)

174

within a sample was associated with a reduced risk of severe or critical illness. Prevalence of the

175

presenting clinical features of fever (p < 0.001), dyspnea (p = 0.028) and diarrhea (p = 0.026);

176

laboratory findings of lymphocytopenia (p = 0.003), elevated LDH (p < 0.001), CRP (p < 0.001)

177

and D-dimer levels (p < 0.001); and bilateral lung involvement or involvement of > 3 lung lobes

178

(p = 0.006) was associated with increased risk of severe or critically severe illness, while having

179

no radiological features on chest CT was associated with decreased risk of severe illness (p =

180

0.003). The results of all univariate meta-regression analyses examining the moderator effects of

181

the covariates on the prevalence of severe or critical illness in COVID-19 infection and their

182

effects on heterogeneity are summarized in Table S4 in Appendix.

The random effects meta-regression analyses revealed a pooled estimate of 4.8%

189

(95%CI, 2.4%-9.5%) for the prevalence of critical illness in COVID-19 infection (Figure 3a).

190

Leave-one-out meta-regression analyses did not significantly change this estimate. The funnel

191

plot of effect-sizes (Figure 3b) was highly suggestive of underreporting or publication bias.

192

Eleven effect-sizes had to be imputed to statistically correct for this bias and after correction, the

193

pooled prevalence of critical illness in COVID-19 infection increased to 16.3% (95%CI, 9.8%-

194

25.7%) (Figure 3c).

195

Significant heterogeneity of effect-sizes was a concern for the meta-analysis of

196

prevalence of critical illness as well (τ2 = 1.994; I2 = 92%, p < 0.001). Correcting for publication

197

bias decreased this heterogeneity (I2 = 78%, 95%CI, 69%-84%), however, heterogeneity

198

remained significant (p < 0.001). Univariate meta-regression analyses suggested increased risk of

199

critical illness associated with sample characteristics of increasing mean age (p = 0.002),

200

prevalence of age > 60 years (p < 0.001), comorbid hypertension (p < 0.01), cardiac disease (p =

201

0.023) and malignancy (p = 0.041). Similarly, prevalence of fever (p = 0.044), dyspnea (p =

202

0.042) and fatigue (p = 0.036) on presentation; prevalence of increased LDH (p = 0.003), CRP (p

203

= 0.008) and D-dimer (p = 0.021) were associated with a greater risk of critical illness (Table S5

204

in Appendix).

214

Prevalence of COVID-19 associated mortality was 0.8% (95%CI, 0.2%-2.9%) based on

215

the random-effects meta-analysis (Figure 4a) and this estimate was minimally affected by leave-

216

one-out sensitivity analyses. However, as with severe and critically severe illness, publication

217

bias / potential underreporting was apparent on the funnel plot of effect sizes (Figure 4b).

218

Thirteen effect-sizes were imputed to account for missing / unreported effects in an attempt to

219

statistically correct for the publication bias and conducting the meta-regression analyses with the

220

addition of these effect-sizes revealed a pooled estimate of 7.4% (95%CI, 4.5%-11.9%) for the

221

mortality rate associated with COVID-19 infection (Figure 4c).

222

Heterogeneity of effect-sizes on prevalence of mortality in COVID-19 was also a concern

223

(τ2 = 2.996; I2 = 86%, p < 0.001). Correction for publication bias decreased the heterogeneity (I2

224

= 61%, 95%CI, 45%-73%), yet the heterogeneity remained significant (p < 0.001). Univariate

225

meta-regression analyses modeling heterogeneity indicated increased mortality risks associated

226

with increasing mean age (p < 0.001), prevalence of age > 60 years (p = 0.011), presenting with

227

fatigue (p = 0.048), leukocytosis (p =0.007), high LDH (p = 0.030) and low albumin (p < 0.001).

228

Prevalence of age < 18 years (p = 0.036) was associated with a decreased risk of COVID-19-

229

associated mortality (Table S6 in Appendix).

Discussion
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we comprehensively and systematically

240

examined the available literature to estimate the prevalence of morbidity and mortality associated

241

with SRAS-CoV-2 infection. Despite the large number of articles that were reviewed, our

242

quantitative synthesis was limited to 29 studies representing data of 2,090 individuals. Our

243

literature-based estimates of severe illness, critical illness and case fatality rates among patients

244

with COVID-19 were 15%, 5% and 0.8% respectively. After adjusting for underreporting and

245

publication bias, COVID-19-associated prevalence of severe illness, critical illness and case

246

fatality increased to 26%, 16% and 7.4% respectively.

247

Our unadjusted random-effects estimates of severe illness requiring hospitalization (15%)

248

and critical illness requiring intensive care admission (5%), are consistent with the estimates of

249

COVID-19-associated morbidity based on large individual-level datasets. 21As such, the

250

unadjusted findings of our meta-analysis regarding severity of illness corroborate the inferences

251

made based on current surveillance systems. However, the unadjusted mortality rate observed in

252

our analysis (0.8%, 95% CI, 0.2%-2.9%) is lower than the COVID-19-associated mortality rates

253

in China (3.6%) or globally (3.4%) at the end of February, 2020 (i.e. the time represented in the

254

reviewed publications). 22

255

As we have noted in the introduction, retrospective patient data and the literature derived

256

from such data could be systematically biased towards both overestimating and / or

257

underestimating morbidity and mortality. The reviewed studies are largely representing tertiary

258

care settings, of which the capacity may have been overridden minimally, if at all, despite the

259

high reproductive number (R0) at the time of sampling. As such, the outcomes of our unadjusted

260

random-effects meta-analyses, which accounts for the random variability of effects between

261

studies, can be inferred to be a generalizable representation of morbidity and mortality rates

262

applicable to a well-trained and equipped healthcare setting of which resources are not

263

overwhelmed. This estimate therefore represents COVID-19 associated mortality in regions with

264

a low R0.

265

However, reverse-causation bias caused by failing to capture the deaths that may not

266

reach healthcare facilities / be diagnosed prior to death may contribute to underestimation. 23 The

267

effect-sizes imputed to correct for publication bias may in fact represent severity and case fatality

268

rates of settings where the demand exceeds the available resources. 24 In fact, our data

269

substantiate the recent forecasts and recommendations to suppress the epidemic growth. 25 While

270

optimized utilization of healthcare facilities by maintaining a low R0 may reduce the mortality

271

rates to as low as 0.8%, overwhelming healthcare resources may increase the overall case fatality

272

rate to 7.4%, or even greater as represented by the effect-sizes we have imputed. 26

273

In our meta-regression analyses that examined risk factors, increasing age and age > 60

274

years consistently stood out as a risk factor, while age < 18 years consistently remained a

275

protective factor, being consistent with the current literature. Angiotensin converting enzyme

276

(ACE)-2 receptors are generally upregulated in patients with hypertension or heart failure, who

277

receive ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor blockers. 27 COVID-19 is known to enter

278

cells by binding to ACE-2 receptors, increasing their risk of infection and development of severe

279

clinical illness. 27 Consistently, we observed an increased risk of severity with hypertension and

280

cardiovascular disease. Presenting with fever emerged as a risk factor for severe and critical

281

illness as well as mortality, underscoring the importance body temperature as a screening tool. 28

282
283

Our systematic review has some limitations. First, while we eliminated studies with
overlapping samples by screening for overlaps of institutes, study dates and authors, we cannot

284

be 100% certain. Second, high degree of heterogeneity was a concern. However, this should be

285

expected in any meta-analysis due to the variability in methodology and study samples and we

286

used heterogeneity to explore covariates in meta-regression analyses. 18, 20 Third, funnel plots of

287

all three meta-analyses indicating substantial publication bias, limiting the generalizability of

288

uncorrected random-effects meta-analyses. Finally, the protocol was not pre-registered. Use of a

289

systematic search strategy; use of random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses

290

assuming high heterogeneity of effect-sizes; exploring the etiology of heterogeneity in meta-

291

regression analyses, which also identified risk factors of morbidity and mortality; exploring the

292

validity of our findings in sensitivity analyses; and statistically correcting for publication /

293

underreporting bias are notable strengths of our systematic review and meta-analysis.

294

In conclusion, after correcting for publication bias, COVID-19 associated overall rates of

295

requirement for hospitalization, intensive care and case fatality could be as high as 26%, 16%

296

and 7.4% respectively. This underscores the importance of strict adherence to preventive

297

measures, case detection, surveillance and reporting. Hypertension; fever and dyspnea at

298

presentation; and elevated CRP seem to predict increased disease severity, while increasing age

299

and elevated LDH seem to consistently predict severity and case fatality. These risk factors

300

should inform clinicians to define endophenotypes possessing a greater risk.
