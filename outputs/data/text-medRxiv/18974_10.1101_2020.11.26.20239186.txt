Abstract:

Title: Characteristics of COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Pune, India,
and cost-effective predictors of intensive care treatment requirement.
Background : Maharashtra is one of the worst affected states in this pandemic.2 As of 30th
September, Maharashtra has in total 1.4 million cases with 38,000 deaths. Objective was to study
associations of severity of disease and need for ICU treatment in COVID-19 patients.
Methods: A retrospective study of clinical course in 800 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and a
predictive model of need for ICU treatment. Eight hundred consecutive patients admitted with
confirmed COVID-19 disease.
Results: Average age was 41 years, 16% were <20 years of age, 55% were male, 50% were
asymptomatic and 16% had at least one comorbidity. Using MoHFW India severity guidelines,
73% patients had mild, 6% moderate and 20% severe disease. Severity was associated with
higher age, symptomatic presentation, elevated neutrophil and reduced lymphocyte counts and
elevated inflammatory markers. Seventy-seven patients needed ICU treatment: they were older
(56 years), more symptomatic and had lower SpO2 and abnormal chest X-ray and deranged
hematology and biochemistry at admission. A model trained on the first 500 patients, using
above variables predicted need for ICU treatment with sensitivity 80%, specificity 88% in
subsequent 300 patients; exclusion of expensive laboratory tests did not affect accuracy.
Conclusion: In the early phase of COVID- 19 epidemic, a significant proportion of hospitalized
patients were young and asymptomatic. Need for ICU treatment was predicted by simple
measures including higher age, symptomatic onset, low SpO2 and abnormal chest X-ray. We
propose a cost-effective model for referring patients for treatment at specialized COVID-19

Introduction :
India reported its first case of COVID-19 on 30th January, 2020 in Kerala.1 As of 30th September
2020, according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) more than 6 million
COVID-19 cases have been reported in India, with 95,00 deaths. India is now 2nd only to United
States in the number of cases.2

Maharashtra is one of the worst affected states in this pandemic.2 As of 30th September,
Maharashtra has in total 1.4 million cases with 38,000 deaths. COVID-19 cases in Pune have
exceeded those in Mumbai. There is considerable load on the health care system to accommodate
COVID-19 patients which is met by opening specialized centers for mild patients. Guidelines for
triaging patients for hospitalization who may need subsequent ICU treatment will be useful.

Symbiosis University Hospital and Research Center is a state of the art hospital. The
management offered 500 isolation and 30 ICU beds for COVID-19 patients to the local
authorities on 24th March 2020.

We narrate our experience of managing the initial 800 consecutive patients admitted with
confirmed COVID-19 positive status. We described the demographic, clinical and biochemical
characteristics, and developed a model of predictors for ICU admission.

Methods:
COVID-19 patient admissions began on 8th April 2020, patients were referred by the Pune
Municipal Corporation with a positive RT-PCR3 test for SARS-CoV2 done at the National

Institute of Virology, Pune. The test was advised for symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 or
because of close contact with COVID-19 patients.

All patients were screened at admission for severity of the disease by the MoHFW Clinical
Guidelines for the management of COVID-19, dated 30th March 2020 (Table-S1).4 Screening
included: demographic details, history of symptoms, comorbidities and their medication, clinical
examination including respiratory rate, blood pressure, pulse oximetry (SpO2) and chest X-ray.
Clinically stable patients with SpO2 >94% on room air and without severe radiographic
abnormality were classified as mild. Patients with lung infiltrates on chest X-ray were classified
as having moderate disease if SpO2 was 90-94%, and severe if SpO2 was <90%.4

A venous blood sample was collected for following laboratory measurements: Complete blood
count (CBC) with absolute neutrophil count (ANC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), liver and
kidney tests, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), serum ferritin (as an acute phase reactant). Patients
with comorbidities had appropriate additional tests (glucose, HbA1c etc) (Table-S2).

A baseline ECG was recorded for any abnormalities and specifically for QTc, in anticipation of
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ, 400mg BD on day 1, and 200mg BD x 4 days) treatment which was
not given for those with prolonged QTc, G6PD deficiency and those younger than 16 years of
age. HCQ treatment was not prescribed for those patients admitted from June 2020 based on
updated evidence on its efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. Pre-admission treatment for comorbidities was continued or adjusted as necessary.

Laboratory tests were repeated as necessary and usually on day 5 for stable patients (Table- S2).
Those who showed deterioration in clinical state, fall in SpO2 or worsening chest X-ray were
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for necessary treatment. Patients with a stable course
were discharged between days 15-18 after two consecutive negative tests for SARS CoV-2 Ag.
In these initial 800 patients there were no height and weight measurements during admission. We
were able to obtain this data during a telephonic follow up 6 weeks after discharge (n=219).

All patients signed a written informed consent at the time of admission which permitted use of
anonymized data for research. The Institutional Research Committee (IRC) of Symbiosis
Medical College for Women gave necessary approvals.

Statistical methods:
We have presented data of clinical and laboratory characteristics of the initial 800 patients by
sex, severity of disease and for those admitted to ICU. We have also shown data for those who
were asymptomatic at admission. For statistical analysis, variables with skewed distributions
were log-transformed to satisfy assumptions of normality. Differences in clinical and
biochemical characteristics between groups of patients were tested by ANOVA adjusting for age
and sex or by Chi-square test. Significant associations generated in this analysis were used as
predictors to build a multivariate logistic regression model to test independent associations with
the outcome of need for ICU treatment. These are presented as ROC curves. Analyses were
carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y.,

USA).

A Random Forest model 5 was also built to predict ICU admission requirement using significant
clinical and laboratory features from the above analysis. The model was trained on the first 500
patients and tested on subsequent 300 patients for its accuracy which is reported as sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). The data on
subsequent 300 patients was shared for validation only after the model was available on the first
500 patients. We also generated models for a limited number of predictors which are likely to be
available in a ‘primary care ’set-up by excluding the more expensive and specialized
measurements. The model was built with 10,000 trees using randomForest package6 in R
statistical programming language.7

Results:
Of the initial 800 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to Symbiosis University Hospital
between 8th April to 15th June, 402 patients were tested for SARS-CoV2 because they had
suggestive symptoms and others because of close contact with a case (Fig 1). There were 440
males and 360 females. Our cohort of COVID-19 patients is relatively young: 49% of patients
were below 40 years of age (16% less than 20 years), only a fifth (n=155) were beyond 60 years
of age. Majority of patients belonged to lower and lower-middle socio-economic classes (TableS3).

At admission (Table-S3) 50% of patients had no symptoms, 31% had one symptom, 14% had
two symptoms and only 6% had more than two symptoms. The commonest symptoms were

fever (26%) and cough (26%); other symptoms included sore throat (13%) and breathlessness
(11%). The average duration of symptoms before hospitalization was 3.4 days. Diabetes (17%)
and hypertension (15%) were the commonest comorbidities which were more common in
females. None of the patients had a previous diagnosis of tuberculosis, HIV or other
immunocompromised state. We were able to calculate BMI in 219 patients from self-reported
height and weight data to be 25.0 + 6.0 kg/m2 (age 45.4 + 16.8 years, 52% males).

Asymptomatic patients were younger (38.9 vs 44.7 years), less likely to have comorbidities (23
vs 28%), and had lower prevalence of moderate and severe disease (15% vs 39% respectively)
compared to those symptomatic at the time of hospital admission. Only 3% of asymptomatic
patients needed ICU treatment and 4 died compared to 16% ICU admissions and 21 deaths in
symptomatic group. When comparing laboratory tests, lymphopenia was more common in
symptomatic and severely ill patients compared to asymptomatic patients, and inflammatory
markers were also higher. As a group, mild and asymptomatic patients had near normal
biochemical tests, normal chest X-ray (95%) that remained normal over the course of illness.
Details are provided in Table-S5.

Table-1 describes characteristics of patients by the clinical severity at admission. Out of 800
patients, 587 (73%) had mild disease, 49 (6%) moderate and 164 (21%) severe disease. Twentyfour severely ill patients needed immediate ICU admission (for hypoxemic respiratory failure)
(Table-S4), others were admitted in the isolation wards. Moderate and severely ill patients were
older than those with mild disease, had larger number of symptoms at presentation and for longer
duration. Twenty-four percent of patients with severe disease had more than one comorbidity

(35% had diabetes and 31% had hypertension). Expectedly, SpO2 was lower in moderate and
severe cases. Chest X-Ray was normal in 72%, and showed unilateral or bilateral infiltrates in
28% patients which were mostly seen in moderate and severe groups. Pulse rate and blood
pressure were similar across groups.

Hemoglobin, total leucocyte count and platelet count were similar across three severity groups.
There was increasing neutrophilia and lymphopenia with increasing severity which reflected in
increasing ANC/ALC ratio. Markers of inflammation i.e., serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and
serum ferritin progressively increased with severity of the disease. The haematological and
inflammatory markers remained stable and near normal in mild cases (on second measurement 35 days after admission) but continued to be elevated or deteriorated in severe patients.

Table-S3 shows demographic and clinical characteristics by sex. Females had similar age,
symptoms and severity grading but had higher rate of co-morbidities compared to males.
Mortality was higher in males.

HCQ was prescribed to 395 patients. It was stopped in 12 patients who developed QTc
prolongation on ECG. Seventy-seven patients also received Azithromycin and 86 Oseltamivir,
based on treating physician’s preference.

A total of 77 patients needed ICU treatment (Table-2) (24 directly admitted, 53 shifted from
isolation ward due to clinical deterioration). These patients had a mean age of 57 years (min 25
and max 90 years) and 44 were males. Majority of these patients were symptomatic at admission,

had longer duration of symptoms and about half of these patients had at least one comorbidity
(29 diabetes and 26 hypertension). They had higher ANC (median 5.3 vs 3.2), lower ALC
(median 1.0 vs 1.8), and higher ANC/ALC ratio (median 5.3 vs 1.9) compared to those who did
not require ICU treatment. Similarly, CRP and serum ferritin concentrations were also higher
Ten of these patients had cardiac arrhythmias, 37 required invasive mechanical ventilation, 12
had acute kidney injury (KDIGO8 stage 1 and above) and 25 developed circulatory failure
(Table-S4). Twenty-five patients died in the ICU: four because of refractory hypoxemia and 19
due to multi-organ failure, 2 due to sudden cardiac death. Patients who died were older (mean
age 64.7, min 36-max 90 years) compared to those who survived, and predominantly male 18/25.
Fifty-two patients were discharged from ICU; the average duration of ICU stay was 12 days.

We found that the following factors were significantly related to ICU admission on univariate
analysis: higher age, larger number of symptoms at diagnosis, more than 1 co-morbidity,
abnormal chest X-ray, low SpO2 (< 94%), higher ANC/ALC ratio, CRP and Serum ferritin
concentrations.

Table-3 describes the multivariate logistic regression to predict ICU treatment. Significant
predictors were: higher age (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.06), symptomatic presentation (OR 6.13,
95% CI 3.14 to 11.96), abnormal chest X-ray (OR 20.14, 95% CI 8.79 to 46.16) and low SpO2 <
93% (OR 12.67, 95% CI 6.36 to 25.23). Two indicators of lung involvement (low SpO2 and
abnormal chest X-ray) had an overriding prediction. The laboratory tests (ANC/ALC ratio, CRP,
S. Ferritin) were significantly related but did not make an additional contribution to the
prediction (Fig 2). The overall prediction was high (AUC 0.951), and the model suggests that

simple clinical, radiological and SpO2 predict requirement for ICU treatment quite reliably. Of
the laboratory tests, the simple hematological test of CBC made an equal contribution compared
to the costlier markers of inflammation. HCQ treatment did not reduce the need for ICU
treatment.9

A Random forest model was constructed on initial 500 patients using sex and eight features
found to be significant in univariate logistic regression. The model was able to predict ICU
admission with high accuracy on subsequent 300 patients (sensitivity 80%, specificity 88%, PPV
47%, NPV 97%). CRP, SpO2 and chest X-ray were the top three important predictors. A model
without CRP and ferritin was comparable (sensitivity 77%, specificity 86%, PPV 43% and NPV
96%), further excluding younger patients (<20 years of age) only marginally improved the
accuracy. (sensitivity 87%, specificity 86%, PPV 46% and NPV 98%) (Table-4)

Seven hundred and seventy-five patients (96.8%) were discharged from the hospital after 15-18
days of hospitalization.

Discussion:
This is one of the largest case series of COVID-19 patients from a dedicated COVID-19 hospital
from Pune, India. It describes patients from the early phase of the epidemic and given a liberal
hospital admission policy at the time includes a large number of asymptomatic (50%) and mild
(73%) cases. Sixteen percent of patients needed ICU management, 3% died and 97% were
discharged in satisfactory condition. We developed and validated a predictive model to identify
patients requiring ICU admission with high accuracy using mainly clinical parameters and two

commonly used markers of respiratory involvement. This supports the current policy to triage
patients needing hospitalization and the usefulness of simple clinical and bed-side measurements
in such a decision. This will be important in resource-limited settings.

We report on a large number of asymptomatic cases who were younger and had minimally
deranged laboratory findings. Majority of them remained with mild disease and did not need any
further intervention. Severe disease was associated with higher age, multiple symptoms and
comorbidities, and abnormal laboratory tests.10 The latter included higher neutrophil (ANC) and
lower lymphocyte (ALC) count leading to higher ANC/ALC ratio, and higher levels of CRP and
serum ferritin concentrations, but not coagulation parameters. Mild cases had stable clinical and
laboratory course while severe cases deteriorated in both. Patients who required ICU treatment
were older (mean age 57 years), more symptomatic and had more comorbidities compared to
those who did not require ICU treatment. Those who died were the oldest (mean age 64.7 years)
and predominantly men (18/25). Our death rate of 3% is lower than the rate in Pune at that time
(4.5%), probably due to preponderance of young patients with mild or asymptomatic disease.

We used both a conventional multiple logistic regression and the random forest technique to
predict the need for ICU admission with high accuracy. Overriding importance of clinical and
simple bedside predictors of respiratory compromise makes our model highly cost-effective in a
resource limited set-up. Our results highlight the importance of having at least a basic x-ray
machine in primary COVID care centers. We encourage other researchers to validate and
improve our model using their data to increase its generalizability. A high negative predictive
value means that the model accurately predicts those who are unlikely to need ICU admission,

and raises confidence in selecting patients for home quarantine, thus helping to avoid
overcrowding of specialized COVID-19 hospitals.

A large number of papers have been published on epidemiology, clinical and biochemical
characters of COVID-19 patients and some models to predict serious outcomes. They are mainly
from China, Italy, Spain, USA and UK.9,10,11 These countries have a different demographic and
socio-economic profile compared to India. Their COVID-19 patients were older, more obese and
with substantially more co-morbidity. This reflected in higher morbidity and mortality,
especially in the geriatric and the deprived sections of the population. There are only a few
reports from India: 1) Gupta et al reported on 22 young patients with mild disease from a tertiary
hospital in Delhi, two-thirds having a history of travel abroad. 12 2) Tambe et al reported on 197
patients (mean age 45 years) from the largest public hospital from Pune, with a high mortality
rate of 29.4%, probably due to a referral bias.13 In other reported studies, the risk of ICU
treatment varied from 8-15%.14 Saluja et al also reported (n=406) a profile of relatively young,
predominantly male patients. Their figures of 8% ICU requirement and 1.9% mortality are not
very different to our case series.15 We have also reported our experience of critically ill ventilated
patients and outcomes. 16

Strengths of our study include: a large number with a mix of symptomatic and asymptomatic
patients, a uniform protocol of clinical and laboratory measurements, severity classification, and
ICU transfer. Inclusion of data on a large number of asymptomatic and mild patients provides an
assurance that they can be managed at home or in a peripheral facility. For hospitalized patients,
we developed a useful predictive model for ICU requirement from simple clinical measurements

and validated it in subsequent group of patients. This has guided us to improve our treatment
practices and make them pragmatic. Unfortunately, we do not have measurements of height,
BMI and admission glucose concentrations in these patients, and therefore are not able to
comment on their contribution to bad outcomes.

In summary, we describe clinical features of COVID-19 patients from early phase of epidemic in
India and the first validated model to predict ICU requirement. This will be useful for the
clinicians and the policy makers.
