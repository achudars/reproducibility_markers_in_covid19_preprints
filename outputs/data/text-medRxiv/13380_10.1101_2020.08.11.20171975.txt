Abstract

27

Introduction: Understanding the clinical course and outcomes of patients with Covid-19 in

28

underrepresented populations like Latin America is paramount. In this study, we report the

29

clinical characteristics of Covid-19 in Chile, with a focus on subjects requiring hospitalization

30

during the initial phases of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

31

Methods: This is a single center study including all consecutive patients diagnosed with

32

Covid-19 during the first month of the pandemic. Demographics, clinical characteristics and

33

laboratory data were collected within 24 hours of admission. The primary outcome was a

34

composite of ICU admission or all-cause, in-hospital mortality.

35

Results: During the first month of the pandemic, 381 patients were confirmed as positive

36

for SARS- CoV-2 by molecular testing; 88 (23.1%) of them eventually required

37

hospitalization. Median age of the cohort was 39 years (IQR 31-49). Overall mortality was

38

0.7% and 18 (3.7%) out of the 88 subjects who required hospitalization either died and/or

39

required ICU. Increased body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein levels (CRP) and the

40

SaTO2/FiO2 index on admission were independently associated with a higher risk of ICU

41

care or death.

42

Discussion: The lower mortality observed in our prospective cohort during the first month

43

of SARS-Cov-2 pandemic was lower than previously reported. This finding could be due to a

44

lower threshold for admission, a healthcare system not yet overburdened and a younger

45

population, among other factors. BMI, CRP on admission were strong predictors for ICU

46

care or all-cause, in- hospital mortality. Our data provide important information regarding

47

the clinical course of Covid- 19 in Latin America.

Introduction

49

In December 2019, a cluster of severe pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in

50

Wuhan, Province of Hubei, China.1 A rapid investigation determined that the agent involved

51

was a novel Coronavirus sharing significant sequence identity with bats and human-related

52

coronaviruses.2,3 The virus and its associated disease were named Severe Acute Respiratory

53

Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Coronavirus disease 19 (Covid-19), respectively.

54

4

55

health care systems and society as a whole. According to publicly available information, the

56

first case of Covid-19 in Chile was diagnosed on March 3, 2020. Initial cases were imported

57

from Europe, but family clusters and evidence of secondary transmission were rapidly

58

observed. Therefore, the Chilean government declared phase 4 (widespread, ongoing local

59

transmission) on March 16, 2020. Data from early clinical series have shed light on the

60

clinical presentation of Covid-19. After a median incubation time of 5 days, 5,6 patients

61

developing symptoms usually present with an influenza-like illness, with fever, dry cough,

62

headache, odynophagia, and dyspnea as the most common symptoms1. Interestingly, a

63

large proportion of subjects also report the development of anosmia and/or augesia as one

64

of the cardinal symptoms of the infection. Early work from China showed that 80% of the

65

subjects with Covid-19 followed an uncomplicated course, 15% required hospital admission

66

and 5% developed a severe infection with a catastrophic respiratory failure needing critical

67

care support. 5 The case-fatality rate is variable, ranging from 2.25% in the Republic of Korea

68

to 14.5 % in countries like Italy, with increasing age, and comorbidities being the most

69

important predictors of mortality.7,8 As Covid-19 spreads, and the number of cases

Soon after its identification, SARS-CoV-2 spread globally causing tremendous burden to

70

dramatically increases, a detailed description of Covid-19 in new geographical areas is

71

critical. Moreover, understanding the clinical course and outcomes of patients with Covid-

72

19 in underrepresented populations like Latin America is paramount. In this study, we

73

report the clinical characteristics of Covid-19 in Chile with a focus on subjects hospitalized

74

during the first month of the epidemic.

75
76

Methods

77
78

The study was conducted in Clínica Alemana de Santiago (CAS), a tertiary care not-for-profit

79

hospital in Santiago, Chile. CAS is a 442-beds healthcare facility that before the Covid-19

80

pandemic included 12 general and 10 cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) beds. The study was

81

approved by the Institutional Review Board, with a waiver of informed consent given that

82

data was collected as part of routine clinical practice and used in a de-identified manner.

83

All consecutive patients attending the Emergency Room and diagnosed with Covid-19

84

between March 3, 2020, and April 4, 2020, were included in this cohort. Laboratory testing

85

for SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed using a commercial reverse-transcriptase (RT)

86

polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples.9

87

Cases were identified using the central laboratory database and electronic medical records.

88

Only patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR were included. Data was extracted from

89

the electronic medical records and entered into a REDCap database by a team of

90

researchers, after a training session led by the senior data manager investigator (AP). Two

91

study investigators (MS and AP) conducted weekly data audits to ensure the quality of the

92

collected data. Data collected included demographic information, comorbidities, clinical

93

presentation, as well as duration of symptoms, treatment, and outcomes. Laboratory values

94

were automatically extracted from the electronic medical records. The Charlson

95

Comorbidity Index (CCI) was used to summarize comorbidities. The score goes from 0 to 24,

96

with zero representing no comorbidities.10 Body Mass Index (BMI) was used to assess excess

97

body weight. Pulse oximetry saturation (SpO2)/ Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio was

98

used to assess respiratory exchange.

99

The primary outcome was a composite of ICU admission or all-cause, in-hospital mortality.

100

Variables used to assess risk factors for the main outcome were obtained within 24 hours

101

of admission.

102
103

Statistical analysis

104

Continuous and categorical variables were presented as median (IQR) and n (%),

105

respectively. Patient characteristics were compared by subgroups of interest using a chi-

106

square test, Fisher’s exact test or the Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. A two-tailed p-

107

value <0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.

108

To explore risk factors associated with disease severity, univariable and multivariable

109

logistic regression models were used. We selected variables for the logistic regression

110

model based on previous findings and plausibility. A maximum of 8 variables were included

111

in the logistic regression model to avoid overfitting. All analyses were conducted using Stata

112

(Version 16.0. College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC).

Results

115

During the first month of the Covid-19 pandemic, 3679 subjects presented with possible

116

SARS-CoV-2 infection and tested by RT-PCR in our institution; 381 (10.4%) were confirmed

117

as positive and included for this study. The average time of symptoms at the time of initial

118

testing was 3.7 days (SD 3.8).

119

The median age of the cohort was 39 years (IQR 31-49) and 153 (52%) were female (Table

120

1). A total of 253 (66.4%) patients reported an epidemiological risk factor for acquiring

121

SARS-CoV-2, i.e. 206 had exposure to a confirmed case, and 47 had recently visited a high-

122

risk country, (16 reported both risk factors). Cough and fatigue were the most common

123

symptoms at presentation. A summary of the main demographic and clinical features of the

124

cohort is shown in Table 1.

125

Subgroup of patients requiring hospitalization

126

Among the 381 patients, 88 (23.1%) eventually required hospital admission, 51 of them were

127

hospitalized after an initial management as outpatients. The median time of symptoms at

128

the time of admission was 8 days (IQR 5-10). Hospitalized patients were generally older than

129

those managed as outpatients (median 49 vs. 37, p < 0.001) and had a higher CCS with 0.28

130

for outpatients and 1.38 for inpatients (p < 0.001). On the first day of hospitalization, 40

131

(45%) subjects were admitted to general wards, 41 (47%) to a step-down unit, and 7 (8%)

132

to ICU. Among subjects hospitalized in general wards and stepdown units, 10 (12%) patients

133

were subsequently transferred to the ICU. The median duration of hospitalization was 8 (4-

134

14.5) days and the median length of stay (LoS) in the ICU was 13 (5.3-17.8) days. A total of

135

82 (93%) patients had an imaging compatible with pneumonia; 39 (44%) required

136

supplementary O2 only, 20 (23%) non-invasive ventilation and 10 (11%) invasive ventilation.

137

Median days of invasive ventilation were 7.5 (6.3-15.3). Among those hospitalized, excess

138

body weight (62.5%) and hypertension (28%) were the most common coexisting conditions

139

A summary of the laboratory abnormalities on admission is presented in Table 3 and Figure

140

1. The most common laboratory abnormalities were: lymphopenia, increased levels of C-

141

reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer. Ferritin values were available for 25 patients at

142

admission, with 20 (80%) presenting an increased level. A comparison of patients who

143

presented severe disease, defined as need for ICU care at any time during admission or in-

144

hospital death, with non-severe disease is provided in Table 3. In univariate analysis, odds

145

of ICU care/death were higher in males, and those with higher BMI, older age, a history of

146

diabetes or hypertension, and chronic medication such as steroids, angiotensin-converting

147

enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Increased white blood

148

cells, neutrophils, CRP, procalcitonin, ferritin, D-dimer, bilirubin, troponin T, LDH and lower

149

SaTO2/FiO2, prothrombin time, sodium, albumin and lymphocytes were all associated with

150

the need for ICU care or death. Based on clinical plausibility and significance level on the

151

univariate analysis, the following variables were included in the multivariate logistic

152

regression model: age, gender, CRP, BMI, neutrophil lymphocyte ratio, SaTO2/FiO2, D-dimer

153

and sodium. Increased BMI and CRP levels were independently associated with increased

154

odds of ICU care/death. SaTO2/FiO2 had a p-value of 0.051, not significant according to our

155

predetermined level of 0.05. See Table 3. As of July 31, out of the 88 patients who required

hospitalization, a total of 3 patients had died and 85 had been discharged and remained

alive.

158

Discussion

159

Chile has been one of the most affected countries by the spread of SARS-Cov-2 worldwide,

160

and still struggling to contain the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. We report the first

161

prospective cohort of patients with Covid-19 in Chile and one of the few available for Latin

162

America and other developing regions. The 381 patients of our cohort encompass all

163

patients diagnosed at our institution during the first month of the pandemic and represent

164

a significant proportion of all notified cases in Chile during the study period (n = 4,161). The

165

cohort mirrored the beginning of the epidemic curve (first four weeks), when a large

166

proportion (~65%) of patients remained able to identify a risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2;

167

thus, many subjects attended the hospital despite having minor symptoms to receive advice

168

and obtain a diagnosis. Importantly, in Chile, summer vacations go from December to the

169

first week of March, so despite frontiers closing on March 16 (only 13 days after the first

170

case), many cases were brought into the country by returning travelers. Indeed, 47 (12.3%)

171

of patients in our cohort had recently visited what was considered at the time a high-risk

172

country. These data suggests that strict isolation and contact tracing of imported cases may

173

have resulted in decreased spread to the general population.

174

A large proportion of patients in our cohort had a mild presentation, with only 18 (4.7%)

175

out of 381 requiring ICU care, consistent with prior studies.11 Interestingly, only 3 patients

176

died during the hospitalization, representing a 3.4% of all patients requiring admission and

177

0.7% of the overall cohort. An in-hospital mortality rate of 3.4% is strikingly lower compared

178

to previous large reports from Wuhan (28%), the New York Area (21%) and other European

179

countries.12-15 This difference could be explained by a lower threshold for admission in our

180

cohort at a time when the healthcare system was not yet overloaded and bed capacity was

181

high. However, an in-hospital mortality of 22% reported from Germany at a time when the

182

healthcare capacity was not burdened argues against this as the sole explanation.14 Also,

183

patients in our cohort were younger (median age 49) compared to the New York, Wuhan

184

and German cohorts (median ages 63, 56 and 72 respectively). Age has been consistently

185

associated with disease severity and outcomes 12,16, hence, it is likely a contributing factor

186

in the lower mortality rates observed in our cohort. Finally, previous cohorts 14,15 excluded

187

a large proportion of patients who were still hospitalized at the time of study closure,

188

biasing results towards an increased mortality rate due to the higher inclusion of patients

189

who died early in the course of hospitalization

190

The cohort presented here is mostly Hispanic, an ethnic population generally

191

underrepresented in medical research.17 Data from the United Kingdom and USA has shown

192

an increased risk of severe COVID-19 among ethnic minorities.18-20 The low fatality and ICU

193

rate of our cohort suggests that the ethnicity issue might rather be a disparity problem.

194

Studies appropriately representing minority populations are sorely needed. Indeed, failing

195

to include an ethnically representative population leads to results that may not apply to

196

these groups, increasing the health inequality.

197

As reported elsewhere,21 higher CRP levels were associated with increased odds of need for

198

ICU care or in-hospital death. Further, our data suggest that elevated CRP levels in the first

199

24 hours of admission were a biomarker for severe clinical presentation of Covid-19. CRP is

200

an acute phase protein released mainly in response to interleukin-6 (IL-6), a cytokine that

201

has also been associated with disease severity in Covid-19.12 Higher CRP levels are likely

202

associated with a higher inflammatory response, which may correspond with increased

203

tissue damage. CRP levels are widely available and generally cheaper than measuring IL-6

204

levels and therefore may represent an interesting biomarker to investigate in future studies.

205

Increased BMI was also associated with severe disease. Several theories have been raised

206

to explain this association, which was described before in other cohorts22, including

207

overactivated inflammation and immune response, decreased chest expansion, and

208

increased expression of ACE 2, among others.22-23 Although the mechanisms are beyond the

209

scope of this study, BMI seems to be a useful predictor of Covid-19 severity and therefore

210

obese patients should be considered a high-risk population. Finally, although the

211

SaTO2/FiO2 index on admission was not independently associated with our main outcome

212

(p=0.051), it was very close to our pre-established level of significance. These data, along

213

with a high biological plausibility suggests this index is worth exploring as a marker for the

214

development of severe Covid-19 disease in future studies.

215

The role of other biomarkers previously identified as predictors of in-hospital mortality or

216

ICU need were not confirmed in our cohort. These findings could be explained due to the

217

limited number of patients included in our series along with the low frequency of

218

occurrence of our primary outcomes (i.e. ICU admission and/or in-hospital mortality). In

219

addition, other relevant limitations of our study include that it is a single center effort and

220

its observational nature. Due to the latter, we did not explore treatment effects given our
10

221

limited ability to appropriately correct for potential confounders. However, our data were

222

prospectively collected with high quality standards and provide one of the few studies

223

contributing information from developing areas of the world, in this case South America. As

224

mentioned above, the data of this cohort mainly represent the initially affected high-income

225

population of Chile and a time of the pandemic were the healthcare system was not yet

226

overwhelmed. Therefore, future studies analyzing the general population attending to a

227

wider range of hospital centers and reflecting a systemic stress created by the large number

228

of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 will be important to help understand the possible

229

influence of social and health disparities, and of the system overload in the outcomes of

230

Covid-19 patients.

231

In conclusion, among patients in our study, SARS-CoV-2 generally caused mild illness with a

232

case fatality rate of 0.7%. On admission, variables associated with the need of ICU care

233

and/or in-hospital mortality included BMI, CRP and SaTO2/FiO2, all of which are widely

234

available in low and middle resource settings such as Latin America.
