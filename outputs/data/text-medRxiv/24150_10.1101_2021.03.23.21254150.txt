Abstract

30

Background

31

Early identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection is important to guide quarantine and reduce

32

transmission. This study evaluates the diagnostic performance of lung ultrasound (LUS), an

33

affordable, consumable-free point-of-care tool, for COVID-19 screening.

34

Methods

35

This prospective observational cohort included adults presenting with cough and/or dyspnea at

36

a SARS-CoV-2 screening center of Lausanne University Hospital between March 31st and May

37

8th, 2020. Investigators recorded standardized LUS images and videos in 10 lung zones per

38

subject. Two blinded independent experts reviewed LUS recording and classified abnormal

39

findings according to pre-specified criteria to investigate their predictive value to diagnose

40

SARS-CoV-2 infection according to PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs (COVIDpos vs COVIDneg).

41

We finally combined LUS and clinical findings to derive a multivariate logistic regression

42

diagnostic score.

43

Results

44

Of 134 included patients, 23% (n=30/134) were COVIDpos and 77% (n=103/134) were

45

COVIDneg; 85%, (n=114/134) cases were previously healthy healthcare workers presenting

46

within 2 to 5 days of symptom onset (IQR). Abnormal LUS findings were significantly more

47

frequent in COVIDpos compared to COVIDneg (45% versus 26%, p=0.045) and mostly consisted

48

of focal pathologic B-lines. Combining LUS findings in a multivariate logistic regression score

49

had an area under the receiver-operating curve of 63.9% to detect COVID-19, but improved to

50

84.5% with the addition of clinical features

Introduction

70

A year into the pandemic, Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) remains a constant threat,

71

overburdening the healthcare system. Current molecular diagnostic tests such as PCR and rapid

72

antigen/antibody tests rely on consumables, which are vulnerable to shortages and saturation

73

during exponential demand. The use of lung imaging as a diagnostic tool for COVID-19 has

74

shown promises. Chest CT has a good sensitivity for patients triaged in emergency departments

75

[1,2] and has even been able to detect pathology in asymptomatic cases, suggesting its potential

76

as an early screening test in specific populations [3–5]. However, CT and even X-rays expose

77

patients to ionizing radiation, are costly, and often not available in decentralized screening sites.

78

Lung ultrasonography (LUS) is an alternative, consumable-free, easy-to-use, portable, non-

79

radiating and non-invasive screening tool that can be performed at the bedside, with simple

80

disinfection between patients and only a negligible cost of ultrasound gel as a consumable. It

81

would allow immediate identification of infected patients at the point-of-care and be invaluable

82

to the sustainable control of the pandemic. Its diagnostic performance for pneumonia has been

83

established using chest CT as a gold standard [6]. For COVID-19, recent studies conducted in

84

emergency departments showed several LUS patterns ranging from mild interstitial infiltrate,

85

to lung consolidation, which correlated with disease progression and outcome [7,8]. However,

86

these studies included mostly severe patients in emergency departments or intensive care units,

87

which may lead to overoptimistic diagnostic performance of LUS due to a spectrum effect [9].

88

To our knowledge, no studies have described LUS findings in subjects with mild COVID-19.

89

This study aims to compare LUS characteristics between SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed

90

(COVIDpos) and PCR-negative (COVIDneg) patients in a screening center and explore LUS

91

performance for identification of COVID-19 outpatients.

Methods

93

Study design, setting and population

94

This prospective cohort study recruited consecutive outpatients at the COVID-19 screening

95

center in Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland (CHUV) between March 31st and May 8th

96

2020. All adults (age ≥ 18 years) presenting at the center with cough and/or dyspnea and who

97

fulfilled eligibility criteria for nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 real time (Rt-) PCR according to

98

the State recommendations at the time of the study were eligible. These State criteria were the

99

presence of symptoms suggestive of COVID in a health worker or a subject with at least one

100

vulnerability criterion, i.e. age ≥ 65 years old or having at least one comorbidity (obesity,

101

diabetes, active cancer, chronic cardiovascular, pulmonary, liver, renal or inflammatory

102

disease). Exclusion criteria were uninterpretable Rt-PCR results or absence of LUS recording.

103

Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

104

To ensure that LUS abnormal findings would be specific of a respiratory tract infection, we

105

included a control group of healthy volunteers, matched for age (+ 5 years), sex, and smoking

106

status with COVIDpos patients (Supplementary Table 1). These volunteers were asymptomatic

107

during the previous 15 days (absence of odynophagia, cough, dyspnea, runny nose, fever, loss

108

of smell or taste) and did not have a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection.

109

At inclusion, demographics, comorbidities, symptoms (including duration), and vital signs were

110

collected using a standardized electronic case report form in REDCap® (Research Electronic

111

Data Capture). Patients were subsequently classified as either COVIDpos or COVIDneg

112

according to the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results (at inclusion or at any time during the 30-day

113

follow-up if the test was repeated for the same clinical episode). We assessed 30-day outcome

114

by phone using a standardized interview (persistence of symptoms, secondary medical

115

consultation, hospital admission, death).

Patient and public involvement

120

Subjects were not involved in the design or conduct of this study.

121

Sample size

122

The minimum sample size required for this study was 100 patients with a clinical suspicion of

123

COVID. It was calculated using a COVID prevalence of 20% and an estimated sensitivity of

124

LUS to identify COVIDpos at 80% This sample size guarantees a power of 80% with a false

125

discovery rate of 5% [10].

126

Lung ultrasonography

127

Three medical students trained in LUS performed image acquisitions in the triage site. The first

128

10 acquisitions were done under direct supervision of an experienced board-certified expert

129

(OP) who verified the quality of recorded images. Acquisition was standardized according to

130

the “10-zone method” [11,12], consisting of five zones per hemithorax. Two images (sagittal

131

and transverse) and 5 second videos were systematically recorded in every zone with a Butterfly

132

IQTM personal US system (Butterfly, Guiford, CT, USA), using the lung preset. The LUS probe

133

and the electronic tablet were disinfected with an alcohol-based solution between each patient

134

to avoid nosocomial spread [13].

135

For interpretation of LUS pathology, a physician experienced in LUS (TB) and an expert

136

radiologist (JYM), blinded to patients’ diagnoses, independently filled a standardized report

137

form as previously described [8]. Discordance between the two readers were adjudicated by a

138

third expert (OP). The abnormal images were summed up in a LUS score for each patient, as

139

previously described [8,14,15].

141

Differences between COVIDpos and COVIDneg patients for all collected demographic and

142

clinical features as well as LUS findings and LUS score were evaluated by Mann Whitney or

143

chi-squared test, as appropriate. A bilateral p value <0.05 was considered as indicative of

144

statistical significance. A multivariate logistic regression was built from 22, 15, 10 and 8

145

features using recursive feature elimination (RFE), originally including the following:

Feature coefficients are presented, as well as their importance in ranked order from RFE .

160

Performance at several stages of the RFE are reported, using the top 22, 15, 10 and 8 features.

161

Models using just LUS or just clinical findings were also built.

162

Diagnostic performance is reported as sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive

163

values (PPV, NPV), positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+, LR-) and area under the

readers. R Core Team (2019) statistical software and python 3.0 with the sklearn library was

171

used for analyses. Similar analyses were attempted on the outcome at 30-day follow up but

172

impossible due to the limited sample size.

Results

175

Demographics and clinical presentation

176

A total of 141 patients met inclusion criteria and were enrolled into the study; eight (5%) were

177

later excluded, due to uninterpretable PCR results or LUS technical issues. Of the 134

178

remaining patients, 31 (23%) were classified as COVIDpos and 103 (77%) as COVIDneg based

179

on Rt-PCR test. Among the 13 COVIDneg patients who had a second screening test during the

180

30-day follow-up, only one had a positive SARS-CoV-2 Rt-PCR, related to a clearly distinct

181

clinical episode. This patient was thus classified as COVIDneg. Most patients were female

182

(63%), healthcare workers (85%) with a median age of 35 years; most sought out testing within

183

the first 5 days of symptom onset (Table 1). COVIDpos patients had fewer comorbidities than

184

COVIDneg, the latter suffering mostly from asthma, obesity or hypertension. COVIDpos patients

185

presented more often with a history of fever and anosmia, but less often with dyspnea than

186

COVIDneg patients. Vital signs at inclusion were normal in most patients of both groups.

187

Lung ultrasonography findings

188

Lung ultrasound was abnormal in 31% of patients (Table 2). The two observers showed good

189

concordance to differentiate a normal from an abnormal LUS, with a kappa of 0.67. Most

190

anomalies were focal and unilateral. The most frequent patterns were pathologic B-lines and

191

thickening of the pleura with pleural line irregularities. Only 9.1% of control subjects presented

192

any abnormal finding on LUS, and all these anomalies were focal pathologic or confluent B

193

lines (Supplementary Table 2).

194

Among all symptomatic patients, two factors were significantly associated with abnormal LUS:

195

SARS-CoV-2 infection and history of fever (Table 3). Indeed, COVIDpos patients had abnormal

196

LUS findings significantly more frequently compared with COVIDneg (45% versus 26%,

197

p=0.045). However, this feature alone was poorly sensitive (45%) and specific (74%). No

specific ultrasonographic pattern on its own significantly distinguished COVIDpos from

199

COVIDneg subjects (Table 2).

200

Although not statistically different, the proportion of COVID-19pos with abnormal LUS

201

findings was positively associated with symptoms duration. While only 30% of COVID-19pos

202

patients had abnormal LUS within 2 days of symptom onset, 52% of patients had pathological

203

LUS after 2 days (p=0.24).

204

Multivariate diagnostic score.

205

We combined LUS findings with symptoms, vital signs and a binary feature for known contact

206

with a COVID-19 case to build a multivariate logistic regression diagnostic score. Using all

207

features, the score had 78.8% sensitivity, 84.0% specificity, 83.1% PPV, 61.4% NPV, 4.9 LR+,

208

0.3 LR- and 84.5% AUC (Figure 1). We present a plot on which to assess the score according

209

to a desired sensitivity/specificity trade-off.

210

In Table 4, score performance with several combinations of features at various stages of RFE

211

are presented. The strongest positive predictor was any evidence of pleural thickening at any

212

number of sites (coefficient: +0.69) with LUS, although it became a negative predictor with an

213

increasing number of sites with this feature (-0.40). The presence of pathological B lines and

214

confluent pathological B lines were also positively associated with COVID infection in this

215

score. All three of the above patterns were retained by RFE within the top seven features. The

216

LUS features that were negative and quickly eliminated by RFE were those describing

217

consolidation and multifocal pathology. Cough, fever and anosmia were the highest ranked

218

symptoms (coefficient ≥0.4), in line with previous reports. While LUS patterns were highly

219

ranked in the RFE, rerunning the model without LUS findings reduced AUC by only 4% (AUC

220

84.5% vs 80.3%). LUS findings were poorly sensitive in the absence of clinical features (AUC:

221

63.9% Sensitivity: 45.5%, Specificity: 77.3%, PPV: 66.7%, NPV: 55.6%, LR+: 2.0, LR-: 0.7).

13
222

Combining all 22 features and using RFE, we observe that removing 7 features had minimal

223

impact on score performance, and removing 12 features reduces AUC by only 4% compared to

224

the original.

225

30-day outcome

226

The 30-day follow-up was available for 121/134 (90%) patients. None was hospitalized or died

227

during follow-up. COVIDpos patients had more frequently persistent symptoms (fatigue,

228

dyspnea or anosmia) at 30-day compared with COVIDneg (Table 1).

229

The presence of an abnormal LUS at inclusion was not associated with symptom persistence

230

(Table 3).

231

As no patients were admitted or died, we could not analyze the value of LUS findings to predict

232

critical clinical outcome.

Discussion

234

Lung pathology is detectable by chest CT early in the course of COVID disease, even in

235

asymptomatic patients, suggesting that lung imaging might have a place as a complementary

236

diagnostic tool [3]. However, large scale CT screening is not feasible even in hospital settings

237

with abundant resources. Point-of-care LUS is now affordable, portable and implementable in

238

a decentralized setting and has all the attributes to become a pragmatic community-based

239

screening tool.

240

We evaluated the diagnostic performance of LUS in a prospective cohort of subjects with mild

241

acute respiratory tract infection attending a COVID-19 Swiss screening center. COVIDpos

242

outpatients more frequently had abnormal LUS findings at inclusion compared with COVIDneg.

243

However, LUS findings alone had insufficient sensitivity, NPV and LR- to recommend LUS as

244

an independent screening tool in outpatients. The combination of LUS findings with clinical

245

presentation showed promising results.

246

The limited sensitivity of LUS in our population is discordant with previous studies, which

247

showed a good sensitivity (89-97%) to identify Rt-PCR-confirmed COVID-19. These

248

retrospective studies were conducted in emergency departments and included patients with

249

severe and critical COVID-19 infection[17–19]. Other studies using chest CT also showed an

250

excellent sensitivity (97-98%) to diagnose COVID-19 [2,20,21]. However, all these studies

251

were conducted in hospitalized patients with severe or critical disease, preventing extrapolation

252

to our milder population screened for symptoms only.

253

The clinical severity of the disease strongly affects the performance of diagnostic tests, and

254

particularly the sensitivity of LUS. We conclude that while LUS may be an interesting COVID-

255

19 screening tool in emergency departments, it is not reliable when used alone in patients with

256

mild disease. In the only study investigating chest CT features in patients with asymptomatic

257

(73%) or mild (27%) COVID-19, which was conducted in the passengers of the cruise ship

Diamond Princess, 54% of asymptomatic patients and 79% of patients with mild disease

259

presented opacities on chest CT. These results suggested the potential use of chest CT in clinical

260

decision making [3]. Most opacities were located in the peripheral areas of the lung, where LUS

261

is performant. Patients included in the Diamond Princess study were older compared with our

262

study population (mean of 63 ± 15 years vs. 39 ± 13 years), a possible explanation for the lower

263

proportion of patients with lung involvement in our study. However, our data suggest that a

264

combination of LUS findings and clinical characteristics might achieve better detection of mild

265

COVID-19 in young outpatients.

266

We observed more abnormal LUS findings in COVIDpos patients who had more than 2 days of

267

symptoms (52% versus 30%), although our results were not statistically significant. Concordant

268

with our findings, a relationship between the duration of infection and the proportion of

269

abnormal radiological findings has been described [22–24]. In one study, only 44% of patients

270

presenting within 2 days of symptoms had an abnormal CT, while this proportion rose to 91%

271

after 3 to 5 days and 96% after 5 days [24]. This study did not provide any data on COVID-19

272

severity. In another study using chest X-ray in patients admitted to the emergency department,

273

the proportion of an abnormal chest X ray increased with the duration of symptoms (63% in the

274

first 2 days to 84% after 9 days) [25].

275

In our study, most patients with abnormal LUS findings presented with focal pathologic B lines,

276

confluent B lines or pleural thickening, irrespective of the etiology of the acute respiratory tract

277

infection. Inclusion of healthy volunteers confirmed the causality between LUS findings and

278

acute respiratory tract infections. Indeed, only 9% of healthy volunteers presented LUS

279

anomalies (and all were focal pathologic B lines).

280

Two previous study showed that thickened pleural lines on LUS were significantly associated

281

with COVID-19 [17,18]. However, in a third report, LUS findings were similar in both COVID-

282

19 and non-COVID-19 patients [19].

Limitations

284

Our study has some limitations. First, most of our subjects were healthy and young healthcare

285

workers, which prevents extrapolation of our results to an older and comorbid population.

286

However, young, healthy subjects are of a prime importance in the management of the virus

287

spread [26]. Second, SARS-CoV-2 Rt-PCR nasopharyngeal swab was used as the gold

288

standard, and we might have missed some early infections when it has limited sensitivity [27].

289

However, it is considered as the reference diagnostic method. Furthermore, we sought to

290

mitigate technical and sample collection error using validated nucleic acid amplification tests

291

and a dedicated trained medical team performing nasopharyngeal swabs [28]. In addition, we

292

had 30-day follow-up, which may have reduced the number of patients misclassified as

293

COVIDneg. To better investigate the predictive potential of LUS findings, we built a

294

multivariate score. The small sample size and high feature count (n= 22) exposes the model to

295

the risk of overfitting. Thus, this score is not ready for clinical use, but rather is a mean to

296

demonstrate the feature importance by RFE.

297

Conclusion

298

To our knowledge, this is the first study, which assessed the use of LUS in a screening center

299

outpatient population with mild COVID-19. As disease severity plays an important role in the

300

ultrasonographic findings, LUS is poorly sensitive as a SARS-CoV-2 screening tool in the

301

context of mild community-level screening. However, the good performance of a combination

302

of clinical and LUS features showed promising results, which could be used to avoid a PCR

303

test in patients with a negative screening. These results need confirmation in a larger study

304

population.

Multivariate logistic regression for COVID diagnosis where selection order is indirectly proportional to the feature’s predictive importance, in
recursive feature elimination (RFE), i.e., the feature labeled 22 was removed first, while 1 was retained until the end. Four feature groups
containing 10 LUS findings, 8 symptoms, 3 vital signs and 1 epidemiological history of contact are color-coded according to their coefficient in
the multivariate score including all 22 features (orange positive correlation with COVID and blue negative correlation). *The coefficient in
multivariate scores is susceptible to multicollinearity.
