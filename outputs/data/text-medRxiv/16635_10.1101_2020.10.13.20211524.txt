Abstract
We present an in-depth analysis of data from drive through testing stations using rapid antigen

detection tests (RDT’s), RT-PCR and virus culture, to assess the ability of RDT's to detect infectious

cases. We show that the detection limits of five commercially available RDT's differ considerably,

impacting the translation into the detection of infectious cases. We recommend careful fit-for-

purpose testing before implementation of antigen RDT's in routine testing algorithms as part of the

COVID-19 response.

Main text
Rapid detection and isolation of new cases, combined with contact tracing and quarantine has

become a critical pillar of the global efforts to reduce circulation of SARS-CoV-2. The purpose of this

test, trace and isolate (TTI) strategy is to stop transmission chains and reduce the impact of COVID-

19. Epidemiological modelling suggests that aggressive TTI combined with physical distancing and the

use of personal protective equipment when physical distancing is not achievable, could suppress a

1

second wave without the need for a prolonged lockdown .

The case numbers have increased in recent weeks across Europe (https://covid19-country-

overviews.ecdc.europa.eu/) and the capacity to keep up the TTI strategy is reaching its limits.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for optimising the available resources. Currently, case diagnosis

relies on RT-PCR testing, which has limitations in terms of time to result, and for which scaling up

capacity has been hampered by scarcity of critical reagents. In addition, while highly specific, the

sensitivity of RT-PCR combined with prolonged shedding of low amounts of viral RNA for weeks may

2

lead to positive test results following clinical recovery long after a person is infectious . Furthermore,

screening of persons without symptoms may yield weak positive test results, raising questions about

how to handle such cases. Ideally, screening of cases would be based on testing for infectivity, but

such cell culture based assays have long turnaround times and therefore are not suitable for rapid

screening, which is essential for the success of TTI. Rapid antigen detection tests (RDT) have recently

entered the diagnostic market. Compared with RT-PCR, they are relatively easy to produce, cheaper,

easy to use with faster turn-around times, and, depending on the assay, without the need for

dedicated equipment or high level laboratory capacity. The widespread and frequent use of such

tests has recently been proposed as a solution to the safe reopening and return to the pre-pandemic

social interactions, but to our knowledge there is no data about the performance in detecting

3

infectious cases .

Here, we assess the potential impact of introduction of RDT’s in the current test strategy of the

Netherlands in which the majority of testing is done in drive through test stations. Detection limits of

5 commercially available RDT's were determined using serial dilutions of freshly harvested SARS-CoV-

2 virus stock. Freshly collected nasal and nasopharyngeal samples in viral transport media from

people presenting to the drive through test station with a range of Ct values were tested in parallel

by RT-PCR, and RDT. Samples were also inoculated onto Vero E6 cells to assess the correlation

between RT-PCR/antigen rapid test results and infectiousness for persons with mild symptoms, to

supplement published data on this relationship for hospitalised patients and patients with mild

2,4

symptoms

.

Quantitative data on the distribution of viral RNA loads for all cases tested positive at the test

location since June 1st (N = 1754), results of RT-PCR testing, expressed as cycle threshold (Ct) values

were retrieved from the laboratory database for the two different RT-PCR platforms used. To allow

direct comparison of results, the Ct values were translated into copy numbers by determining the

amount of RNA copies based on the E-gene RT-PCR and quantified E-gene in vitro RNA transcripts as

5

described by Corman et al. and using an in-house prepared standard of cultured virus . For both

platforms, turnaround time was logged systematically and this data was extracted to assess potential

impact of implementation of antigen testing on the time to result. To determine the profile of

positive patients in the drive-through test stations, we selected data from 223 COVID-19 index cases

with complete background on date of symptom onset, date of sample collection date of diagnosis

from the database of the municipal health service of Rotterdam-Rijnmond.

The distribution of Ct values and estimated RNA loads for patients reporting to drive through testing

was skewed to high RNA loads (Figure 1). Data on time since symptom onset for a selection of cases

showed that the majority of persons report to the testing station within the first week of symptom

onset, in line with national recommendations for testing (Figure 2). The viral load distribution for the

complete patient group (N = 1754) was similar, and therefore we assumed a similar profile of cases

(data not shown). Results were available the same day for 33% of cases, the next day for 55%, after 2

days for 11% and after 3 days for 1%. Infectiousness was assessed by including the matched viral

cultures and RT-PCR of 78 randomly selected individuals that were diagnosed with SARS-CoV2 in the

drive through testing station. We determined the probability of being infectious for all patients

tested in the drive through station using logistic regression analysis in R 4.0.0. This analysis was used

to calculate the density distribution of infectious persons (Figure 2, red bars). In addition,

infectiousness was calculated based on two published studies that tested cell culture in parallel with

RT-PCR in hospitalized patients with severe and mild illness, respectively (Van Kampen et al., 2020;

Wölfel

et al., 2020) (Supplementary figure 1). This comparison suggests that throat/nose swabs from

outpatients more often were cell culture positive than those from hospitalised cases.

Table 1 shows the estimated proportion of these infectious cases which would be detected and

missed if the different rapid antigen detection tests would be used as the first line of screening in the

current test routine. With the most sensitive RDT's, 97.30% (88.65%-99.77%) of infectious individuals

would be expected to be detected. This decreased to 92.73% (range 60.30-99.77) and 75.53 (range

17.55-99.77) for assays B and C, respectively. This preliminary analysis suggests major differences in

the RDT's regarding suitability for tracking of most infectious cases.

Assuming that the implementation of rapid tests will lead to reporting of the results on the same day,

followed by contact by a public health official in all cases, the proportion of cases with optimal start

of contact tracing can increase from 33% to 75,53% when using the least sensitive assay to 97.3% for

the most sensitive assays.

Discussion
The use of rapid antigen tests for screening of individuals offers the potential for rapid identification

3

of those individuals at greatest risk of spreading the infection . We tested this line of reasoning based

on real life data, as a basis for discussion on choices for assays and testing algorithms. The advantage

of faster time to result and therefore initiation of contact tracing is a great added benefit of RDT's. In

our example, routine application of RDT's will increase the proportion of suspect cases who receive

their test results the same day from 33 to 97%. The shortening of testing delays is a critical

determinant of success of a contact tracing strategy, and shortening from 3 to 1 days can push

expanding outbreaks into suppression with a reproductive number below 1

6,7

. Our analysis also

shows, however, that antigen RDT's differ greatly in their ability to detect infectious cases, therefore

requiring careful validation before routine application. In our setting, people were tested relatively

soon after onset of disease, when viral loads are at their peak thus ensuring highest sensitivity of the

RDT's. A more challenging application is the use of RDT's in testing persons without symptoms, as a

strategy to reopen society after lockdowns. Here, in the absence of knowledge of time since

exposure, negative predictive values are difficult to assess and risk of false negatives is higher than in

symptomatic persons that may be using physical distancing as is currently recommended globally.

Nonetheless, when used judiciously, RDT's offer hope to improve containment by more rapid

isolation and contact tracing of the most infectious individuals.
