Abstract

27

pandemic and local, regional and national public health policies designed to limit the spread of the epidemic as

28

well as “reopen” cities and states, are best informed by serum neutralizing antibody titers measured by

29

reproducible, high throughput, and statically credible antibody (Ab) assays. To date, a myriad of Ab tests,

30

both available and authorized for emergency use by the FDA, has led to confusion rather than insight per se.

31

The present study reports the results of a rapid, point-in-time 1,000-person cohort study using serial blood

32

donors in the New York City metropolitan area (NYC) using multiple serological tests, including enzyme-

33

linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and high throughput serological assays (HTSAs). These were then

34

tested and associated with assays for neutralizing Ab (NAb). Of the 1,000 NYC blood donor samples in late

35

June and early July 2020, 12.1% and 10.9% were seropositive using the Ortho Total Ig and the Abbott IgG

36

HTSA assays, respectively. These serological assays correlated with neutralization activity specific to SARS-

37

CoV-2. The data reported herein suggest that seroconversion in this population occurred in approximately 1 in

38

8 blood donors from the beginning of the pandemic in NYC (considered March 1, 2020). These findings

39

deviate with an earlier seroprevalence study in NYC showing 13.7% positivity. Collectively however, these

40

data demonstrate that a low number of individuals have serologic evidence of infection during this “first

41

wave” and suggest that the notion of “herd immunity” at rates of ~60% or higher are not near. Furthermore,

42

the data presented herein show that the nature of the Ab-based immunity is not invariably associated with the

43

development of NAb. While the blood donor population may not mimic precisely the NYC population as a

44

whole, rapid assessment of seroprevalence in this cohort and serial reassessment could aid public health

45

decision making.

Projections of the stage of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)

47

Background
The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 pandemic has swept the global

48

community with the United States reporting nearly 8.5 million confirmed cases and over 230,000 deaths from

49

Coronavirus disease (COVID)-19.(1, 2) Transmission models of SARS-CoV-2, supported by studies of

50

immune responses to related viral infections, suggest that recovery from infection could provide immunity to

51

reinfection.(1, 3) Thus, the use of serological tests to identify those who have acquired antibodies (Abs)

52

against SARS-CoV-2 (seroconversion) and the frequency of seroconversion in the population (seroprevalence)

53

is a powerful means with which to guide public health policies.(4, 5) The term ‘hotspots’ has emerged to

54

describe regions of high infectivity that appear and then recede as the pandemic evolves. It is important to

55

ascertain the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in regional populations to estimate the risk of infection

56

associated with newly developing or receding COVID-19 hotspots.

57

As natural infection continues to persist, and vaccine distribution commences, serologic assays will be

58

vital in monitoring the development of herd immunity, also called community or population immunity, which

59

refers to the point at which enough people are sufficiently “protected”, and person-to-person transmission is

60

unlikely. Reaching this milestone will, in effect, herald the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore,

61

population-wide serological assessment and reassessment are critical, and the tests employed need to be

62

reliable, credible, reproducible and high throughput. Furthermore, it is important to understand the degree of

63

correlation of any given assay’s “reactivity” with the presence of neutralizing antibody (Nab). These data,

64

then, can be used to assist public health officials in modeling projections and in informing policy making

65

decisions including the safe “reopening” of cities, states, and regions.

66

The performance and sensitivity of COVID-19 serology assays is myriad in platform (lateral flow,

67

ELISA, etc.) and variable in terms of sensitivity and specificity.(6, 7) Such assays rely on detection and

68

quantification of antibodies that recognize specific SARS-CoV-2 antigens including the four major structural

69

proteins; spike (S) protein (containing the S1 domain and RBD motif), nucleocapsid (NP) protein, membrane

70

(M) protein, and envelop (E) protein.(8) Research conducted on 2005 SARS-CoV-1 and Middle East

71

respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which are highly related to SARS-CoV-2, found that

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.06.20220087; this version posted November 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

72

recovered individuals produced the strongest immunogenic antibodies against antigens of the S and N

73

proteins.(9) Thus, the development of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies has focused heavily on the

74

detection of antibodies against these viral proteins.

75

As above, antibody-based tests vary considerably in both technology (platform) and target antigen

76

(design) which led to, in May 2020, the FDA reversing its emergency use authorization (EUA) and approval

77

policies in order to help ensure that reliable tests could be used to accurately measure seroconversion in

78

populations. Some tests have received emergency use authorization but population-wide data are limited, and

79

continuous monitoring is necessary to be of practical importance.

80

Variability in test characteristics, particularly sensitivity, implies that there may not yet be an ideal test

81

design and instrument platform, which can lead to variability and potential bias in the estimation of the level

82

of immunity in various locales or subpopulations.(10, 11) However, two platforms have been widely cited: 1)

83

in-house enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and 2) high-throughput serological assays (HTSA).

84

ELISAs offer wide flexibility for research laboratories to select virtually any antigenic protein of interest and

85

assay patient sera to provide highly sensitive, quantitative results. HTSAs are more suitable to clinical

86

laboratories processing large volumes of samples. Although HTSAs offer a narrower selection of antigen

87

choices, these platforms offer high-throughput capacity, high sensitivity and can be integrated into clinical lab

88

testing facilities. The resulting expectation of antibody development is an association with antiviral activity

89

and acquisition of immunity against future viral infection. However, only a subset of virus-specific antibodies

90

will be neutralizing, and the levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies necessary to confer

91

protective immunity following infection or vaccination across the population are not known. Thus, studies that

92

evaluate serological test designs are necessary to associate a serological result with a probability of immunity.

93

New York City (NYC) was one of the first epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic and possesses the

94

highest case count per capita of anywhere in the United States.(12) Seroconversion, therefore, is likely to be

95

substantial in a random sampling of NYC residents. Moreover, the true number of COVID-19 cases may be

96

underreported, resulting in inaccurate case estimates (incidence) and morbidity and mortality rates of SARS-

97

CoV-2.(13)

98

The objectives of the study reported herein were to determine the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2

99

Ab in blood donors in the NYC metro area at a specific point in time four months after the first NY case, as a

100

surrogate for the population as a whole, an indicator of the stage of the epidemic, and as a baseline for future

101

reassessments, using commercially available serology tests, and characterize the Ab responses in ELISAs and

102

a neutralizing antibody assays, allowing us to ultimately inform city, state and nation-wide efforts to mitigate

103

the pandemic and its attendant social and economic strife.

104

Results

105

Characteristics of the NYC Blood Donor Population

106

To estimate seroprevalence, 1,000 blood donor plasma samples were randomly collected from NYBC

107

blood donation centers between June and July 2020, encompassing regions proximal to NYC, including Long

108

Island, Westchester County and New Jersey (Figure 1A). To characterize donors demographically, we cross-

109

referenced donor data to the 2010 U.S. Census dataset.(14) Donors ranged in age from 16 to 78 years with a

110

median age of 48 years (95% CI: 46-49 years), which was older than the New York City median age of 35.5

111

years and deviated from a Gaussian distribution (Figure 1B, r2=0.708). The donor group also included

112

significantly fewer female donors (38.5%) compared to 52.5% citywide (Figure 1C). Donors that did not

113

respond to ethnicity or reported as ‘Other’ composed 15.6% of the donors. Among donors that responded, the

114

distribution of donor race/ethnicity was 73% white, 3.6% black, 3.4% multi-race, and 4.4% Asian, compared

115

to an average NYC Metro distribution of 44% white, 25.55% black, 3.99% multi-race, and 12.7% Asian

116

(Figure 1D). These data show skewing of blood donors from the NYC demographics in many categories,

117

which is a known characteristic of the blood donor population.

118

High Throughput Serological Estimates

119

To quantify SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in donor samples, the Ortho Clinical Diagnostics VITROS

120

Total Ig Test (Ortho) and the Abbott Labs Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Abbott) HTSA assays were used.

121

Results of the Ortho test yielded 121 positive donors while the Abbott test showed 109 positive donors

122

(Figure 2A). Adjusting for sample size effect, the estimated seroprevalence rate using the Ortho HTSA was

123

12.1% (95% CI: 10.2 – 14.27%) while the Abbott test indicates a seroprevalence rate was 10.9% (95% CI:

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.06.20220087; this version posted November 7, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

124

9.1% - 12.9%). In total, 128 donors were seropositive by either HTSA test, with 102 donors (79.69%) testing

125

positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using both the Ortho and Abbott tests, and 19 (14.84%) or 7 (5.47%)

126

of donors testing positive using only the Ortho or Abbott test, respectively (Figure 2B). The median results

127

using the Ortho test for seropositive donors was 414 (n=121, 95% CI: 320.0-466.0, IQR: 135.0-692.5),

128

representing a 5,900-fold increase over the median Ortho result for seronegative donors which was 0.07

129

(n=879, 95% CI: 0.07-0.07, IQR 0.05-0.10) (Figure 2C). The median Abbott test result for seropositive

130

donors was 4.1 (n=109, 95% CI: 3.56-4.77, IQR: 2.77-5.915), representing a 130-fold increase over the

131

median Abbott result for the seronegative donors which was 0.03 (n=891, 95%CI: 0.02-0.03, IQR: 0.02- 0.5)

132

(Figure 2D).

133

The gold-standard of serological quantification is the ELISA assay. To compare HTSA results using

134

our in-house SARS-CoV-2 ELISA assays, we analyzed donor plasma for antibodies using S1 and NP

135

antigens. Using the S1 ELISA (Figure 2E), the median value for seropositive donors was 352.1 µg/mL

136

(n=128, 95% CI: 312.0-399.8 µg/mL, IQR: 179.9 – 617.2 µg/mL) and the median value for negative donors

137

was 21.5 µg/mL (n=97, 95% CI: 17.32 – 26.77 µg/mL, IQR: 6.29 – 38.79 µg/mL). Using the NP ELISA

138

(Figure 2F), the median value for seropositive donors was 193.5 ng/mL (n=128, 95% CI: 155.6 ng/mL-

139

226.7ng/mL, IQR: 74.00 ug/mL- 380 ug/mL) and the median value for negative donors was 19.38 ng/mL

140

(n=97, 95% CI: 15.74 ng/mL - 24.20 ng/mL, IQR: 12.79 ug/mL - 31.49ug/mL). Interestingly, seropositive

141

donors for Ortho and Abbott tests showed 88.2% and 84.5% above the S/co value for the S1 ELISA assay.

142

Expectedly, seropositive donors negative by S1 ELISA assays had relatively low HTSA scores (data not

143

shown), which suggests HTSA assays have higher sensitivity than traditional ELISA methodology. Linear

144

regression of Ortho and Abbott tests (Figure 2G) showed a modest goodness-of-fit (r2=0.37) indicating that

145

while HTSA test scores are positively associated, a high degree of variation within donors exists between

146

HTSA test results. Taken together, these data confirm that a wide range of serological results are prevalent in

147

the NYC metro population and HTSA platforms have the highest sensitivity to quantify serological results

148

with which to estimate seroprevalence.

Neutralizing Activity of NYC Blood Donors

150

Antiviral antibodies can inhibit viral particles from infecting target cells and constitute an important

151

form of immunity to future viral exposure; particularly in relation to effective vaccination. In the case of

152

SARS-CoV-2, such assays require biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facilities and highly trained personnel. To

153

overcome this limitation and expedite testing, we employed a ‘surrogate virus’ neutralization assay to quantify

154

nAb levels present in donor plasma, which differs from conventional SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles in

155

that surrogate virus retains replication potential and is thus more analogous to live SARS-CoV-2. The results

156

of the neutralization end point titer (NT100) assays are summarized in Table 1. The majority (87.4%, n=90) of

157

Ortho seropositive donors (n=121) were positive for nAbs, while 18 samples (14.9%) had indeterminant levels

158

of nAbs and 13 samples (12.6%) were negative for neutralizing activity. Ortho seronegative donors (n=104)

159

showed 1 positive (0.9%) and 2 (1.8%) indeterminant samples for neutralizing activity. The majority (92.4%,

160

n=86) of Abbott seropositive donors (n=109) were also positive for nAbs, with 16 samples (14.7%) having

161

indeterminant levels of nAbs and 7 samples (7.6%) being negative for neutralizing activity. Abbott

162

seronegative donors (n=116) showed 5 positive (4.3%) and 4 (3.4%) indeterminant samples for neutralizing

163

activity. It was noted that all samples positive for neutralization activity were positive for at least one HSTA

164

assay, while 14.9% of seropositive samples were negative for neutralization activity (Table 2). These data

165

illustrate the that serological assays, particularly those with values near the S/co value for each assay, may not

166

reliably correspond to bona fide neutralization activity.

167

The semi-quantitative NT100 method showed that titers for seropositive samples varied between donors.

168

Reciprocal dilution factor values ranged from <80 to 1,280 (Figure 3A). Analysis of the 128 seropositive

169

samples revealed 21.9% were below the LOD at the 1:80 dilution (the lowest dilution tested in this analyses)

170

and 7.0% were considered ‘indeterminant’, due to suspected sample interference. We found low NT100 titers of

171

80 and 160 comprised 30.5% and 29.7% of BD samples, respectively, constituting over half of seropositive

172

blood donors. Moderate NT100 titers of 320 and 640 accounted for 5.5% and 4.7% of donors while the highest

173

nAb titers of ≥1280 described 0.8% of seropositive samples. These data indicate that, similar to serology

174

results, nAb levels against SARS-CoV-2 are highly variable and are skewed towards low neutralizing activity

175

within seropositive blood donors in the NYC metro area.

176

It remains infeasible to implement neutralization assays as a measurement of antiviral antibodies at the

177

scale of the general population. While many serology tests have been developed, evidence as to the predictive

178

value between SARS-CoV-2 serology test results and neutralizing activity continues to be an important

179

validation for the medical and scientific community. To this end, we examined the correlation between

180

serology and neutralization assays in the CP donor samples. Spearman’s correlation analysis of all five

181

serological analyses showed a high degree of positive association between all tests (Figure 2H). The Ortho

182

and Abbott HTSA tests showed the highest degree of correlation with neutralization activity (Ortho: r= 0.64,

183

Abbott: r=0.62), followed by the S1 (r=0.55) and NP (r=0.51). Interestingly, the Ortho HTSA and S1 ELISA,

184

and Ortho HTSA and nAb assay showed the highest correlation (r=0.64), further validating the SARS-CoV-2

185

spike S1 protein as an important target of neutralizing function. These data confirm that established HTSA and

186

ELISA assays strongly correlate with neutralizing activity. As expected, the Ortho test, which measures anti-

187

spike antibodies, showed a higher degree of correlation with the S1 ELISA titers (r=0.639) while the Abbot

188

test, which measures anti-NP antibodies, showed a high degree of correlation with the NP ELISA titer

189

(r=0.778).

190

Further, median values for both HTSA assays increased with higher neutralizing assay titers (Figure 3B, 3C)

191

and this observation was also observed in ELISA assays (Figure 3D, 3E). These data highlight the utility of

192

HTSA and ELISA assays to predict neutralization activity of plasma samples.

193

Similarly, we evaluated the correlation between donor-reported SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain

194

reaction (PCR) testing, SARS-CoV-2 serology, and neutralization. 273 donors (27.3%) reported having had a

195

PCR test, with 44 (16.1%) reporting to have had a positive PCR result, 203 reporting to have had a negative

196

PCR result, and 750 donors who were either not tested or were awaiting PCR results (Table 3), though date of

197

PCR test was not available. Of the 44 donors reporting to have had a positive PCR result, 43 (97.7%) were

198

seropositive, with 39 (88.6%) being both Ortho seropositive and Abbott seropositive, and an additional 3

199

being Ortho seropositive, and 1 being Abbott seropositive. Donors reporting to have had a positive PCR result

200

were also tested for neuralization activity, with 38/44 (86.4%) samples positive, 5 indeterminate, and 1

201

negative for neutralizing activity (Table 4). Though the amount of time between positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR

202

test result and blood donation is not known, CP eligibility requires that the donor be 14 days from the date of

203

last symptom. Whether or not indeterminate/negatives may have seroconverted subsequent to the donation

204

analyzed, these results show strong correlation between positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results, seropositivity,

205

and neutralization activity and may be suggestive of longitudinal immunity.

206

Discussion

207

COVID-19 antibody testing has entered public discourse as an important metric in monitoring the

208

evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Ultimately, the application of antibody testing could be clinically

209

informative as to the degree of immunity incurred by recovered patients or vaccinated individuals. Random

210

blood donor screening is a practice that is readily feasible using blood banking infrastructure to rapidly screen

211

regional populations for seroprevalence monitoring. This is the first study to evaluate a large cohort of

212

random blood donors in the NYC metro area for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, we recognize the

213

limitations of the current study include a lack of generalizability as a consequence of the modestly skewed

214

demographics of blood donors and the general population as a whole, and that this may impact the

215

conclusions of the results. In fact, seroprevalence has been suggested to be higher in specific racial/ethnic

216

communities based on recent studies.(15) Thus, more inclusive and complete seroprevalence studies will need

217

to be performed in the future. Nonetheless, the authors believe that using blood donor in serial studies is an

218

important, if indirect, measure of community immunity.

219

In this study, we found the Ortho Total Ig and Abbott IgG HTSA assays estimate a ~10.9-12.2%

220

SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in July of 2020 in the NYC Metro area. Moreover, we found that ELISA assays,

221

which are the gold-standard of serological quantification, corresponded with seropositive classification of

222

donors as detected by HTSAs, thus validating the use of ELISAs in population studies. Further, in seropositive

223

blood donors we observed a wide range of anti-SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing activity that was skewed towards

224

low to moderate NT100 titers. This trend is in agreement with our previous investigation of convalescent

225

plasma donors(16) and a study of patients recovering from COVID-19, both of which also showed large

226

variability and modest levels of neutralizing activity in plasma units.(17)

227

Our estimation of the NYC Metro area blood donor seroconversion is in agreement with other reports

228

from state and local departments of health. Seroconversion in a study of Bergen County, NJ was estimated to

229

be 12.2% in June of 2020.(18) Seroconversion among hospital workers in New York City was estimated to be

230

13.7% as of June of 2020.(19) The overall seroprevalence in New York City, at the peak of the epidemic, was

231

estimated to be 21% with some communities as high as 68% using data from emergency care clinics.(20) This

232

is juxtaposed to neighboring states, such as Rhode Island, where we estimated seroconversion to be 0.6%

among blood donors in May 2020.(21) Given the early introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in the NYC Metro area

234

in March of 2020 as an initial, and possibly largest, ‘hot-spot’ in the United States, the estimated

235

seroprevalence in this study may be lower than anticipated due to naturally waning antibody titers(22) (or due

236

to demographics of donor population relative to the NYC population.

237

Conclusion

238

In conclusion, we estimate the seroprevalence of NYC metro blood donors to be approximately 1 in 8

239

donors during the month of July 2020 and four months post the commencement of the epidemic in NY. While

240

it is slightly lower than another study using a NYC population of healthcare workers during a similar time

241

period, who, in all likelihood, had higher than typical exposure rates,(19) our findings demonstrate a

242

comparable seroprevalence estimate can be discerned using a widely accessible blood donor population and it

243

an important metric during this catastrophic outbreak. This strategy can therefore be leveraged in its design for

244

future studies to implement rapid seroconversion/seroprevalence monitoring. Furthermore, considering the

245

possibility that this may be an underestimate of the metropolitan population, these conclusions suggest that in

246

the absence of a vaccine, “background” or “herd” immunity continues to be low at four months post-

247

commencement, and, now eight months into the US pandemic, it is probable that the susceptible population

248

remains very high, and possibly at ~80% or greater.

251

Methods

252

Whole Blood Donors and Sample Preparation
From June 16, 2020 – July 15, 2020, consecutive NYC metro donors (n=1,000) received a 2-question

253
254

survey, provided demographic information and completed a blood donation. Choropleth was generated in

255

house from donor zip code prefix data using the web tool, http://www.heatmapper.ca/geocoordinate/. Plasma

256

was isolated from whole blood samples collected in citrate tubes. Samples were extracted, aliquoted to

257

minimize freeze-thaw cycles, and stored at -80°C. Donor blood samples were tested using the Ortho

258

VITROS™ SARS-CoV-2 Total Ig assay, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, in-house ELISAs, and the Vyriad

259

IMMUNO-COV™ neutralization assay as described with some modifications.(23) The IMMUNO-COV

260

assay performed here differed from that which was described in the referenced publication in that: 1) plasma

261

samples were heat-inactivated instead of serum samples, which is necessary due to thermal coagulation and 2)

262

neutralization activity was quantified using neutralization end point titer (NT100) method and not a standard

263

curve.

264

High-throughput Serology Assays

265

Plasma samples were barcoded and dispatched to Rhode Island Blood Center (RIBC). Samples were

266

analyzed using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay using the Abbott

267

Architect i2000SR (Abbott Core Laboratories), as well as the VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-

268

SARS-CoV-2 Total Test using the VITROS 5600 (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics). All assays were performed by

269

trained RIBC employees according to the respective manufacturer standard procedures.

270

Virus Neutralization Assays

271

Plasma samples were heat-inactivated for 30 min at 56o, then clarified by centrifugation for 5 min. at

272

12,000 x g and assayed using a surrogate virus SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. A modified version of the

273

IMMUNO-COVTM assay (19), was used in which each plasma sample was serially diluted and assayed at a

274

total of six dilutions, starting at 1:80. The virus neutralizing titer was determined as the reciprocal of the

275

highest dilution at which the sample was still positive for neutralization based on assay performance relative to

276

a pre-defined calibrator consisting of monoclonal anti-spike antibody.

277
278

In-house SARS-Cov2 Binding-Antibody ELISAs
Flat-well, nickel-coated 96 well ELISA plates (Thermo Scientific; USA) were coated with 2 ug/mL of

279

recombinant S1 spike protein, nucleocapsid protein, or Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) spike protein

280

specific to SARS-CoV-2 in resuspension buffer (1% Human Serum Albumin in 0.01% TBST) and incubated

281

in a stationary humidified chamber overnight at 4°C. On the day of the assay, plates were blocked for 30 min

282

with ELISA blocking buffer (3% W/V non-fat milk in TBST). Standard curves for both S1 and RBD assays

283

were generated by using mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein monoclonal antibody (clone [3A2],

284

ABIN2452119, Antibodies-Online) as the standard. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid mouse monoclonal

285

antibody (clone [7E1B], bsm-41414M, Bioss Antibodies) was used as a standard for nucleocapsid binding

286

assays. Monoclonal antibody standard curves and serial dilutions of donor sera were prepared in assay buffer

287

(1% W/V non-fat milk in TBST) and added to blocked plates in technical duplicate for 1 hr with orbital

288

shaking at room temperature. Plates were then washed three times with TBST and incubated for 1 hr with

289

ELISA assay buffer containing Goat anti-Human IgA, IgG, IgM (Heavy & Light Chain) Antibody-HRP (Cat.

290

No. ABIN100792, Antibodies-Online) and Goat anti-Mouse IgG2b (Heavy Chain) Antibody-HRP (Cat. No.

291

ABIN376251, Antibodies-Online) at 1:30000 and 1:3000 dilutions, respectively. Plates were then washed

292

three times, developed with Pierce TMB substrate (Thermo Scientific; USA) for approximately 5-7.5 min, and

293

quenched with 3 M HCl. Absorbance readings were collected at 450 nm. Standard curves were constructed in

294

Prism 8.4 (Graphpad Software Inc.) using a Sigmoidal 4PL Non-Linear Regression (curve fit) model.

295

Estimated Seroprevalence & Statistical Calculations

296
297

For HTSA assays, seroprevalence was estimated using the Wilson Bayesian statistical method.(24)
Data and statistical analyses were performed and presented using Prism 8.
