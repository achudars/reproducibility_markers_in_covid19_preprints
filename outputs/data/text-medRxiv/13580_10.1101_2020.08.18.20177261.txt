Abstract
In recent months, the world has suffered from the appearance of a new strain of coronavirus, causing the COVID-19 pandemic. There are great scientific efforts to find new
treatments and vaccines, at the same time that governments, companies, and individuals
have taken a series of actions in response to this pandemic. These efforts seek to decrease
the speed of propagation, although with significant social and economic costs. Countries
have taken different actions, also with different results. In this article we use non-parametric
techniques (HT and MST) with the aim of identifying groups of countries with a similar
spread of the coronavirus. The variable of interest is the number of daily infections per
country. Results show that there are groups of countries with differentiated contagion dynamics, both in the number of contagions plus at the time of the greatest transmission of
the disease. It is concluded that the actions taken by the countries, the speed at which they
were taken and the number of tests carried out may explain part of the differences in the
dynamics of contagion.

Introduction

In recent months, the world has suffered from the appearance of a new strain of coronavirus,
causing the COVID-19 pandemic. There are great scientific efforts to find new treatments and
vaccines, at the same time that governments, companies, and individuals have taken a series of
actions in response to this pandemic. These efforts seek to decrease the speed of propagation,
although with significant social and economic costs. Countries have taken different actions, also
with different results. In this article non-parametric techniques (HT and MST) are introduced
to identify groups of countries with a similar spread of the coronavirus evolution. The variable
of interest is the number of daily infections per country during a period of at least 100 days
after the confirmation of the tenth case. The coronavirus propagation is analyzed in terms of a
complex system composed of many interacting elements that exhibit numerous forms of emergent
collective dynamics (Machado and Lopes, 2020). Complex systems cannot be explained by
studying the constituent parts in isolation, but by considering the interrelation with the other
elements of this system.
Vasconcelos et al. (2020) analyze the fatality curves of the COVID-19 disease, represented by
the cumulative number of deaths, for eight countries: Brazil China, France, Germany, Iran,
Italy, South Korea, and Spain. The study model the cumulative number of deaths by applying
the Richards growth model and find that it describes very well the fatality curves in all cases.
The authors also find that -in order to be effective- the countermeasures (i.e. social distancing,
quarantine, school closures, etc.) must be taken immediately after the onset of the epidemic. In
particular, they find that if the interventions are delayed by ten days the respective efficiencies
drop to about 50% or less. Additionally, a delay of additional 20 days brings the efficiency to
less than 30%.
Manchein et al. (2020) study the growth of the cumulative number of confirmed infected cases
by a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) until March 27, 2020. The study focuses on nine countries (Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Republic of Korea, and USA) and
finds that in all cases the cumulative number of confirmed infected cases follows a power-law
growth. Moreover, by using the distance correlation, the power-law curves between countries
are statistically highly correlated. The authors argue that these correlations suggest the universality of such curves around the world. Regarding the impact of the countermeasures, the
article finds that soft quarantine strategies are inefficient to flatten the growth curves. Among
the most effective countermeasures to flatten the power laws, the authors identify the social
distancing of individuals and also the strategy of identifying and isolating infected individuals
which, according to the authors, is the best strategy to flatten the curves.
Zarikas et al. (2020) present a hierarchical cluster analysis, in which they analyze active cases,
active cases per population and active cases per population and per area based on Johns Hopkins epidemiological data. The analysis identifies four different shapes in the evolution rate
of COVID-19. The first shape corresponds to China, which characterizes by a sharp increase
during the first 21 days and then a flattening of the curve2. The second shape corresponds to
South Korea, which is similar to the China´s shape but with a lower number of cases. The
third shape is associated to the countries where the cases appeared early, but they have a low
number of cases (for example, Vietnam, Thailand, Japan, Japan, Singapore or Nepal). Finally,
the fourth shape corresponds to countries in which the cases arose since several days, but the

sharp increase occurred very recently and the number of cases during last day was very high
(for example, USA, France, Germany, Italy, UK, Spain, Iran, Canada or Israel. Important to
note, as the authors suggest, that the surface area of each country is a parameter influencing
the criticality of the situation, i.e. geography matters.
Chandu (2020) utilizes a K-means clustering algorithm to analyze 89 countries with at least
1000 confirmed positive cases. The algorithm groups the countries into two main clusters.
The Americas, European countries, and Australia were members of the same cluster, which is
characterized by high COVID-19 case fatality rate, higher proportion of country’s population
tested COVID-19 positive, higher percentage of GDP spent as public health expenditure, and
greater percentage of population being more than 65 years of age.
Rojas et al. (2020) present an analysis of the states of the United States with the aim of
measuring the similarity of COVID-19 time series. In the proposed methodology, infected and
deceased persona are jointly analyze and the similarity between time series is measured through
the dynamic time warping distance (an extension of the Euclidean distance) and nine different
clusters are obtained, showing a different pattern in the eastern region and western region of
the United States.
In this article we use non-parametric techniques (HT and MST) with the aim of identifying
groups of countries with a similar spread of the coronavirus. The variable of interest is the
number of daily infections per country. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In
section 2, the methodology of this paper is presented: Hierarchical Trees (HT) and the Minimum
Spanning Trees (MST). Section 3 introduces the data, whereas section 4 presents the empirical
results. The final section 5 draws the conclusions.

Methodology

Following the methodology developed by Mantegna (1999), in this study the coronavirus propagation is formulated as a network problem, where each country would be represented as a node,
and the relationship between each pair of countries as a link. Thus, the spread of coronavirus
would be a complex network of mutually interacting nodes and each link would represent how
similar is the coronavirus dynamics between any pair of countries.
The Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) graphs were introduced by Kruskal in graph theory (Kruskal,
1956), but they started to be utilized in the realm of Econophysics due to the work of Mantegna
(1999), who utilized the MST applied to time series data to analyze stock market correlations.
The clustering process used to form the MST is known in cluster analysis as the single-linkage
clustering method. The main advantage of the MST is that it simplifies comparisons by reducing
the number of elements that must be analyzed. Moreover, since MST selects the strongest
relationships among network nodes, it condenses the core information on the global structure
of the network. Thus, the general characteristics of the network can be reproduced in the MST
(Hill, 1999; Kwapień et al., 2009). In this article we propose analyzing the evolution of new
daily coronavirus cases by using elements of graph theory. Thus, the time series of new cases per
country will be the nodes of a graph, while the relationships between countries will be represented
by the links of the graph. This way, the links correspond to the Pearson’s correlation distance
(Mantegna, 1999) between any pair of countries. Following Stanley and Mantegna (2000), from

2 METHODOLOGY

these correlation distance we construct the minimum spanning tree (MST), which is the minimal
graph that covers all nodes without loops. The first step of this methodology is the calculation
of the Pearson’s correlations between the n Ö n pairs of countries:
ρi,j =

Cov(ri , rj )
σri σrj

(1)

where ri is the number of new cases in country i. Then, the correlation matrix is built with the
correlation coefficients ρi,j . By definition, ρi,j takes values in the interval (-1, 1), where -1 means
complete anti-correlation, 1 complete correlation and 0 that the two variables are uncorrelated.
This matrix is symmetrical, with ρi,j = 1 in this main diagonal. As it is well known, the Pearson
correlation coefficient (1) does not fulfill the three axioms that define a Euclidean metric. For
this reason, the correlation matrix is transformed into the correlation distance matrix according
que the following formula
q
di,j = 2(1 − ρi,j )
(2)
which fulfills the three axioms of an Euclidean distance:
(i) d(i, j) = 0 ↔ i = j
(ii) d(i, j) = d(j, i)
(iii) d(i, j) ≤ d(i, k) + d(k, j)
Then, the distance matrix is used to determine the minimal spanning tree (MST) connecting the
n vertices. The MST is constructed following the Kruskal’s algorithm, which links all the vertices
together in a single graph that minimizes the distances between the corresponding time series.
Then, the distance matrix is used to determine the minimal spanning tree (MST) connecting
the n vertices. The Kruskal method is implemented by following the next steps. First, the
algorithm chooses a pair of nodes with the nearest distance and connects them with a line that
is proportional to the distance. Then, the algorithm connects another pair of nodes with the
second nearest distance. In the third step, the nearest pair that is not connected by the same
tree is also linked. This step is repeated until all the nodes are connected in a single tree.
From the MST we obtain the subdominant ultrametric distance matrix X, which corresponds to
the matrix whose elements are the subdominant ultrametric distance d∗ (i, j). The subdominant
ultrametric distance d∗ (i, j) between the vertices i and j is the maximum value of any correlation
distance d(i, j) detected by moving one step from i to j through the shortest path connecting i
and j in the MST. The ultrametric distance d∗ (i, j) between the vertices i and j is then given
by:
d∗ (i, j) = max(d(wi , wj ); 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1)
(3)
where ((w1 , w2 ), (w3 , w4 ), ..., (wn−1 , wn )) shows the minimal path in the MST that connects the
vertices i and j, where w1 = 1 and wn = j. Using this formula we compute the ultrametric
distance d∗ (i, j) between each pair of currencies and from it we construct the Hierarchical Tree
(HT), which is represented as a tree known as dendogram.

Data

This study compares the active cases per population of 191 countries. For each country, we
construct a time series composed by daily data of the number of daily infections per country.
Each time series considers a period of 100 days after the confirmation of the tenth case, using
a moving average smoothing. This way, the analysis of new active cases takes into account the
different moments in which the virus began to disseminate in each country. Data are obtained
from “Our World in Data” (Roser et al., 2020), which is built from information supplied by the
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, government reports, Oxford COVID-19
Government Response Tracker, World Bank – World Development Indicators, United Nations
Statistics Division and Eurostat. Although this study focuses on new active cases per population,
it will also analyze total active cases, new deaths and total deaths per population, new tests and
test per 1,000 people, the Government Response Stringency Index as well as other demographic
and socioeconomic indicators.

Results

In this section we present the empirical results of this article. Figure 1 shows the MST and
the corresponding HT. In Appendix 1, Table 2 lists the countries belonging to each cluster and
Figure 8 shows how the clusters are distributed among the different countries belonging to the
sample.
According to pesudo-F (Caliński and Harabasz, 1974) and pseudo-t2 (Duda et al., 1973) hierarchical clustering stopping rules, three main groups can be identified plus a fourth small group
integrated by both Mongolia and the series representing the average of all the countries. Cluster
1 has 104 members, cluster 2 is integrated by 43 countries and cluster 3 includes 43 countries.
Within these groups represented in Figure 1, it can be seen that the structure of the network for
cluster 2 is linear while for clusters 1 and 3 it has countries with a higher number of connections.
A higher number of connections (higher node degree) or a higher number of shortest paths
that pass through the node (higher betweenness centrality) imply that these nodes summarize
a large amount of information from the network. In other words, it means the data series for
these countries represent many of the characteristics of the groups to which they belong. Table
1 shows that the nodes with the highest centrality are India, Indonesia and Mexico for cluster
1 and Italy and Romania for cluster 3.

Figure 2: Evolution of new cases: median of each group, in logs (left) and joint graph of the
elements of each cluster, in logs (right).
As showed by Figure 2, each group of countries exhibits a different kind of dynamic behavior.
Countries in cluster 1 starts with a low number of cases per million, although it maintains
an upward trend during the whole period. On the other hand, cluster 2 begins with values
between 10 and 20 cases per million and follows a decreasing trend. Finally, cluster 3 reaches
its peak between the 20th and 40th day and immediately starts to decrease. On the other hand,
when observing the dynamics within each group of countries, it can be seen that the median
represents the trend behavior within each group. How similarity is measured in this work
(Pearson’s correlation coefficient) tends to group countries with similar trends, therefore the
three main clusters represent three different dynamic behaviors for the first 100 days: sustained
growth, decrease sustained or accelerated growth followed by a decrease in the number of new
cases.
Figure 3 shows examples of the dynamic behavior of countries extracted from each cluster.
Mexico and Argentina, both members of cluster 1, follow a quite similar upward trend, whereas
the paradigmatic case of Uruguay (see Moreno et al, 2020) -member of cluster 2- follows an
oscillatory although descending trend. Italy is a representative example of cluster 3, as we
mentioned before. We observe that it began with a pronounced increase in new cases, reached
its peak between the 20th and 40th day and afterwards started a descending trajectory.
It is worth to note that cluster 3 is the group with the highest number of cases, as can be seen
in Figure 4. In addition, this cluster has had the most pronounced downward trend. This group
includes China and Italy, countries with an accelerated initial growth. Initially they experienced
an accelerated rate of contagion, reached their respective peaks and entered sooner into the phase
of deceleration. In addition, many of the cluster 3 countries have been the first countries to face
COVID 19, in the epidemic stage. We can assume that in the absence of knowledge about this
disease and the lack of adequate protocols in early 2020, the virus spread more rapidly through
these countries. Group 2 is composed of islands and small countries. We can assume that these
geographical conditions made it easier for them to isolate themselves once the contagion stage
began, preventing the possibility of new infections from people who travel from abroad.
Total number of deaths and new tests per thousand inhabitants are shown in Figure 5. We

observe that groups 2 and 3 began to stabilize between the 40th and 60th day, whereas the
cluster 1 has maintained a constant growth rate since day 30. With respect to new tests, group
2 is the one with the highest number, followed by cluster 3. Group 1 registers a lower number
of new tests, although with an increasing trend. An interesting result is that the groups of
countries that have achieved a drop in the number of cases are those that perform a greater
number of tests; moreover, it after 100 days, with a growing trend and a higher number of new
cases per million, the countries of cluster 1 are maintained below the number of tests performed.
This may mean that, along with other measures, mass testing helps control the spread1 .
Figure 6 presents a comparison between groups according to demographic and socioeconomic
indicators. From the comparison, we observe that group 3 shows better socioeconomic indicators
than the other groups. However it also present higher risk factors due to the age of its population.
The former might be related to a greater effectiveness in the effective control of disease, whereas
the latter to a higher mortality rates. On the other hand, group 1 has, in median, the largest
population, the lowest density, younger population and worse socioeconomic conditions. For
most of the indicators, group 2 occupies the intermediate position, except for its population and
the proportion of the population with access to basic handwashing facilities.
Finally, Figure 7 presents the Stringency Index, which is a composite measure based on nine
response indicators, including school closures, workplace closures, and travel bans, rescaled to a
value from 0 to 100, where 100 represents the strictest response. The groups reach similar levels
of restrictions about 20 days after the first cases, although relevant differences are observed.
Group 1 progressively increases their controls, which began to stabilize around day 50. Group
2 had the quickest response, reaching its peak before the day 20. Group 3 applied the measures
more slowly, following the contagion curve. Relationships between the Stringency index and data
about new cases per million can be established for each group, observing that those countries
with a faster government response have been more successful in controlling the disease, while
a decrease in the number of new infections does not seem to be related to mobility restrictions
1

The intensity of the tests is a variable of government policy that is related to the success in containing the
disease. This association can also be found in James and Menzies (2020).

more extended in time. An example of this is cluster 1, which has remained at very high levels
of restrictions from the 20th to the end of the period analyzed without being able to modify
the growing trend of new infections. Countries in clusters 2 and 3 have progressively reduced
restrictions on mobility, following the decrease in new cases in those clusters.

Conclusions

Three large clusters of countries were identified and each one was associated with three different
types of contagion curves. The largest cluster has not reached its maximum yet and maintains a
growing trend. It is also noteworthy that cluster 1 has higher levels of poverty, which implies that
a significant proportion of the population must seek their livelihood on a daily basis, also related
to the lesser scope of their health and social protection systems, in accordance with Goutte et al.

5 CONCLUSIONS

(2020). For this segment of the population staying at home during the pandemic is a major
challenge. This might be one the drivers behind the fact that in cluster 1 the virus continues
spreading. This dynamics can be seen also in developed countries with weakened organized labor
and job insecurity, because as McKee and Stuckler (2020) notes, “even the wealthiest societies
are only as strong as their weakest members”. The cluster 2 was the first to reach the peak
of daily infections and quickly entered into phase of decline. It is worth observing that this
group is composed by small countries and islands, which highlights the importance of geography
as a key factor (Zarikas et al., 2020). The cluster 3 had an abrupt increase in new cases and
once the maximum was reached it entered into a decreasing phase. This cluster also had both
the highest death toll and the oldest age group, which underlines the importance of protecting
people in risk factor groups. Another important point is the relationship between the Stringency
index and the contagious curves. We observed that the three groups reached similar levels of
restrictions 20 days after their first cases. However, cluster 2 implemented countermeasures
10 days before the other clusters and reached its maximum without experiencing an abrupt
jump in the number of cases. This result highlights the importance of a timely response and
it is in line with Vasconcelos et al. (2020), in which the authors find that the countermeasures
must be taken immediately after the onset of the epidemic. The quality of the health and social
protection systems are crucial in this regard since both the level and the speed of the government
response will depend on these factors, as can be seen also in Armocida et al. (2020). The levels
of trust of citizens in science and institutions and the association between academia and political
representatives (see Moreno et al. (2020)) are essential for good management of the situation.
An additional implication on this issue is about the dichotomy between the economy and health.
Countries of clusters 2 and 3, which have been more aggressive and faster in implementing stayat-home measures and massive testing, have achieved a decrease in the number of new cases
and a progressive decrease in restrictions on the mobility, while cluster 1 countries maintain
higher restrictions on mobility after one hundred days. Lin and Meissner (2020) do not find an
association between local restriction policies and the economy, although unlike what Lin and
Meissner (2020) suggested, our analysis suggest that these measures could be associated with
changes in the number of infections. It is necessary to investigate more about this matter, but
it could be thought that there is no dichotomy between health and the economy, but that the
best measures for subsequent reactivation of economic activity consist of the rapid response to
the pandemic. This aid should cover both health systems and the most vulnerable individuals
in society. One important limitation when working with these databases is the possibility of
under-reporting of cases, which might imply -among other consequences- that cluster 1 has
already reached its maximum or that cluster 2 had a less/more pronounced peak. Additionally,
it is important to note that at this point it is not clear if all the reported deaths are caused
by COVID-19 or if the deaths were caused by a third factor. This might constitute a future
research question. In addition, this work may be extended in order to analyze other variables,
such as the ratios “deaths / active-cases” and “active-cases / tests” or by utilizing temporal
windows to study the clusters dynamics.
