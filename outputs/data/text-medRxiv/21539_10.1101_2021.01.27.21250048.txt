Abstract
Background: The new SARS-CoV-2 variant VUI (202012/01), identified recently in the United
Kingdom (UK), exhibits a higher transmissibility rate compared to other variants, and a
reproductive number 0.4 higher. In the UK, scientists were able to identify the increase of this
new variant through the rise of false negative results for the spike (S) target using a three-target
RT-PCR assay (TaqPath kit).
Methods: To control and study the current coronavirus pandemic, it is important to develop a
rapid and low-cost molecular test to identify the aforementioned variant. In this work, we
designed primer sets specific to SARS-CoV-2 variant VUI (202012/01) to be used by SYBR
Green-based RT-PCR. These primers were specifically designed to confirm the deletion
mutations

Δ69/Δ70

in the spike and the

Δ106/Δ107/Δ108

in the NSP6 gene. We studied 20

samples from positive patients, 16 samples displayed an S-negative profile (negative for S target
and positive for N and ORF1ab targets) and four samples with S, N and ORF1ab positive profile.
Results: Our results emphasized that all S-negative samples harbored the mutations Δ69/Δ70 and

Δ106/Δ107/Δ108.

This protocol could be used as a second test to confirm the diagnosis in

patients who were already positive to COVID-19 but showed false negative results for S-gene.
Conclusions: This technique may allow to identify patients carrying the VUI (202012/01)
variant or a closely related variant, in case of shortage in sequencing.

Introduction
As the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 continues to affect the planet, researchers around the world are
monitoring the virus and detecting acquired mutations that may lead to higher threats of
spreading COVID-19 [1]. A new variant was recently reported in the UK as a Variant Under
Investigation (VUI - 202012/01), belonging to the B.1.1.7 lineage [2]. Its rate of transmission is
estimated to be >70%, and its reproductive number (Ro) seems to be up to 0.4 higher [3]. This
variant harbors 14 non-synonymous mutations, 6 synonymous mutations and 3 deletions [2, 3].
A wide variety of diagnostic tests have been used by high-throughput national testing systems
around the world, to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 infection [4]. The arising prevalence of new
SARS-CoV-2 variants such as B.1.1.7 has become of great concern, as most of the existing RTPCR tests will not be able to specifically distinguish these new variants because they were not
designed for such a purpose. Therefore, public health officials most rely on their current testing
systems and their sequencing results to draw conclusions on the prevalence of new variants in
their territories [2, 5]. An example of such cases has been seen in the UK. In fact, scientists were
able to identify the augmentation of the B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 variant infection in the population
through an increase in the S-gene target failure in their three target gene assay (N+, ORF1ab+, S) when using the Applied Biosystems TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, USA) that included the ORF1ab, S, and N gene targets [1, 6, 7].
In 24 December 2020, Thermo Fisher Scientific confirmed that the S deletion Δ69/Δ70 was in
the area targeted by the TaqPath Kit. Whilst other variants with

Δ69/70

are also circulating

worldwide, the absence of detection of the S gene target increasingly appears to be a highly
specific marker for the new variant [2, 7]. In addition, the European CDC recommended that
multi-target RT-PCR assays that included an S gene target affected by the deletions could be

used as a signal for the presence of the Δ69/Δ70 mutation for further investigations and could be
helpful to keep tracking these mutant strains [8].
Genome sequencing is the gold method to confirm the new variant, but observational studies
provide also stronger evidence if similar models are observed in multiple countries, especially
when randomized studies are not possible. In Lebanon, surveillance data from Beirut Medical
Center and Bahman Hospital showed a rapid and dramatic increase in S-negative profile in PCR
testing for SARS-CoV-2 in the first twelve days in January, reaching approximately 60% of
positive cases [9].
In 15 January 2021, in GISAID we found 374,613 SARS-CoV-2 sequences, among them 17,473
sequences belonged to the new variant (VUI 202012/01). It is important to notice that the cooccurrence of mutations Δ69/Δ70 in the spike and Δ106/Δ107/Δ108 in the NSP6, was present in
this new variant. We then decided to use these two deletions as targets for our rapid and low-cost
protocol, performing SYBR Green-Based RT-PCR. In this work, we propose primer sets that can
be applied as a second step to confirm the diagnosis in cases that were already detected as
positive to SARS-CoV-2.
It is well known that confirmatory diagnosis based on specific diagnostic biomarkers remains a
great challenge allowing the further control and eradication of infections including COVID-19
[10]. Therefore, this novel method may lead to specifically identify individuals carrying the

Δ69/Δ70 and the Δ106/Δ107/Δ108 mutations.

Material and Methods
Clinical specimens
20 clinical samples for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, with Ct (cycle threshold) value < 30,
were selected for this study from December 9 to January 10. All samples were previously tested
positive by the Applied Biosystems™ TaqPath™ COVID-19 assay which targeted the RdRP, N
and Spike genes in the Molecular Laboratories at Bahman Hospital and Beirut Cardiac Institute
in the city of Beirut. 16 of these samples were S-negative and 4 were S-positive.
All patients provided written and signed informed consents
RNA extraction and cDNA obtention
RNA was extracted from the clinical samples using Qiamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen). Total
RNA was converted to cDNA using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad), following the
manufacturer’s recommended procedures.
Primer design
Primers were designed based on the recently available full sequence of the new variant VUI
(202012/01)

from

the

NCBI

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512).

SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR
Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out using iTaq universal SYBR green super mix (Bio Rad). In
brief, each reaction consisted of a total volume of 20 μl containing 2 μL of each primer [10
pM/μL], 5 μl of cDNA, 10 μl SYBR Green super mix and 1 μL of Rnase free Water.
Real-time PCR was performed using Bio Rad CFX96 RealTime PCR Machine. The thermal
cycling conditions used were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of amplification
at 94°C for 10 seconds, and 60°C for 1 minute. The reaction was completed by determining the
dissociation curve of all amplicons.

Results
In order to validate our method, we re-tested 20 samples that had been tested as positive for
SARS-CoV-2 with Ct < 30, by the TaqPath kit. 16 samples with S-negative profile and four
samples with S-positive profile (Table 2). N primer pairs were used as positive control, Spike
WT and NSP6 WT primer pairs were used to detect the variants not harboring the deletion
mutations Δ69/Δ70 in the spike nor the Δ106/Δ107/Δ108 in the NSP6, respectively. Spike del
69/70 primer pairs were designed to detect the deletions Δ69/Δ70 in the spike protein (Figure 1).
Our results showed that the N-gene amplicons were detected in both, S-negative and S-positive
profiles proving the role of this primer as a positive control (Table 2 and Figure 2), whereas the
spike del 69/70-gene amplicons were detected only in the S-negative profile confirming the
absence of the amino acids 69 and 70 in the spike protein of these samples (Figure 2. B, Figure
2), For the spike WT and NSP6 WT primers, amplicons of both, were detected only in the Spositive profile confirming the presence of the two amino acids 69 and 70 in the spike protein

and the three amino acids 106, 107 and 108 in the NSP6 protein of S-positive samples (Figure
2.A). The Ct values of both TaqPath kit and SYBR Green-based RT-PCR were similar to a
difference in Ct of 2.1 on average when comparing the Ct values of N gene in Probe-based and
SYBR Green –Based PCR (Table 2).
The results of spike del 69/70 primers were fully concordant with spike WT and NSP6 WT
primers, 100% of the S-negative profile had the Spike deletions Δ69/Δ70 (Figure 3. A), while
100% of the S-positive profile did not contain the deletions Spike

Δ69/Δ70

and NSP6

Δ106/Δ107/Δ108 (Figure 2. A). Moreover, we confirmed the presence of only one PCR product
by a unique melting peak for each primer pairs (Figure 2. C, D).

Conclusion
Sequencing is the current gold standard diagnostic method to confirm the presence of any new
variant, its efficient but a time consuming method and not accessible to all laboratories especially
in developing countries. In this study, we have developed a rapid, low-cost, large-scale screening
protocol for the detection of the deletions

Δ69/Δ70

and

Δ106/Δ107/Δ108.

We hope that our

efforts will be helpful and can contribute to the early detection of the new variant (VUI
202012/01), for the prevention of transmission and early intervention. This protocol should not
be limited to this variant, but also for any other future variant to come, just by designing the
appropriate primers.
