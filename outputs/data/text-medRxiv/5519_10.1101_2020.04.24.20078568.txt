Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a new type and rapidly spread viral pneumonia, is
now producing an outbreak of pandemic proportions. The clinical features and laboratory
results of different age groups are different due to the general susceptibility of the disease. The
laboratory findings of COVID-19 in pregnant women are also conflicting. Para-clinical
investigations including laboratory tests and radiologic findings play an important role in early
diagnosis and treatment monitoring of severe acute respiratory syndrome and coronavirus-2
(SARS-CoV-2). The majority of previous reports on the SARS-CoV-2 laboratory results were
based on data from the general population and limited information is available based on age
difference and pregnancy status. This review aimed to describe the COVID-19 laboratory
findings in neonates, children, adults, elderly and pregnant women altogether for the first time.
The most attracting and reliable markers of COVID-19 in patients were: normal C-reactive
protein (CRP) and very different and conflicting laboratory results regardless of clinical
symptoms in neonates, normal or temporary elevated CRP, conflicting WBC count results and
procalcitonin elevation in children, lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in
adult patients, lymphopenia and elevated CRP and LDH in the elderly people and high CRP,
leukocytosis and elevated neutrophil ratio in pregnant women.
Keywords: COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; diagnosis; laboratory findings; age; pregnancy.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a form of mild to severe respiratory disease caused
by a virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family

1,2.

According to the current statistics of the

Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the disease has involved all over the world, with
over 1362000 diagnosed cases and more than 76000 deaths until April 7, 2020 3. In the initial
phases of the disease, symptoms like fever, cough, and dyspnea can occur

2,4.

Some patients

rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and additional severe
complications, which are ultimately followed by multiple organ failure 5, hence, timely diagnosis
of patients is very essential. Although detection of viral nucleic acid using real-time reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) remains the gold standard of diagnosis and
monitoring, it is very time-consuming and has a high prevalence of false-negative results

6,7.

Other laboratory tests, such as whole white blood cells (WBCs) count, neutrophil ratio,
lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), hemoglobin,
platelets, procalcitonin, creatine kinase (CK), myoglobin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin, creatinine, cardiac troponin I, D-dimer, albumin,
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and several other laboratory tests have been reported to change
in COVID-19 patients

1,8-10.

The majority of previous reports on the SARS-CoV-2 laboratory

results were based on data from the general population and limited information is available
based on age difference and pregnancy status

11-14.

Since the laboratory medicine provides an

essential contribution to the clinical decision making in many infectious diseases including
COVID-19, we reviewed a broad spectrum of COVID-19 clinical and laboratory reports to
provide a comprehensive data collection in order to clarify the dark parts of laboratory-based
diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19 in a different group of patients including neonates,
children, adults, elderly and pregnant women altogether for the first time.
Search strategy
The search was performed in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science, using the keywords
“COVID-19” or “2019-nCoV” or “2019 novel coronavirus” or “SARS-CoV-2” without language or
date restrictions. The title and abstract of all articles identified and those describing laboratory

findings in COVID-19 patients were finally selected. The articles that had not reported data on
laboratory test results were excluded. Because the aim of the study was to investigate the
laboratory results among different age groups including neonates, children, adults, elderly and
also pregnant women, the articles without exact clarification of age range were also excluded.
Ages under 1 year, 1-17 years, 18-64 years and 65 years or older were considered as neonate,
children, adults and elderly, respectively.
Laboratory findings of COVID-19 in neonates
Clinical features of COVID-19 in neonates may be non-specific 15. Neonates with COVID-19
may also develop multiple organ damage and rapid illness alterations

16.

Although laboratory

data on severe acute respiratory syndrome and coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected neonates
are still limited, there are several case reports that provide some laboratory findings. In a 6month-old male neonate with confirmed COVID-19 infection, with no clinical signs or symptoms
and high viral load, WBC count and biochemical markers including liver function tests were
normal on day 2 and only neutropenia occurred on day 8 of admission

17.

This asymptomatic

neonate with normal laboratory results may play significant roles in the transmission of COVID19 in the community. Another infected infant with no significant signs of the disease revealed
different results. Blood tests showed lymphopenia, elevated liver function tests and elevated
CK level 18. A 55-day-old female infant with only rhinorrhoea and a dry cough without fever or
other significant symptoms was confirmed to have COVID-19. Laboratory tests results indicated
that there were changes in hepatic function tests. Lymphocyte count, platelet count, liver
function tests, procalcitonin, and serum IgM level were all slightly elevated. Other laboratory
examinations including CRP, ESR, coagulation tests, hemoglobin, D-dimer and renal function
tests showed no abnormalities

16.

Laboratory examination of a 3-month-old female infected

with COVID-19, suffering from diarrhea and fever with normal chest computerized tomography
(CT) scan results, revealed high neutrophil levels and reduced lymphocytes 19. Although all the
described cases were asymptomatic or with mild clinical manifestations, their laboratory results
were very different and conflicting. For example, lymphocyte counts varied from lymphopenia
to lymphocytosis and CRP was normal among neonates (Table 1). These findings highlight the

difficulties in detecting the disease and making decisions in neonates based on symptoms and
laboratory results.
Laboratory findings of COVID-19 in children
Based on current data, the majority of the SARS-CoV-2 infected children have mild or no
symptoms

20,21.

CRP was normal in the majority of infected children. WBC count results are

conflicting but were normal in most of the cases 22-25. In a study on the 34 infected children, the
WBC counts of 82% were normal. CRP levels and ESR were increased in only 1 and 5 cases,
respectively. Lymphopenia and neutropenia were found in only one case, respectively.
Procalcitonin elevation was found in only 1 case and D-dimer in 3 cases. Another study carried
out on 10 children cases, the LDH levels were high

24.

Wei et al. claimed that procalcitonin

elevation was common in pediatric patients which is different from adults. The procalcitonin
was elevated in 80% cases in this study which is not common in adult patients 23. Procalcitonin
is a marker for bacterial infection and can be induced by bacteriotoxins but suppressed by
interferons. It may suggest that routine antibacterial treatments may be effective in pediatric
patients 23. Based on Wei et al. report and since WBC count results are very conflicting and CRP
is usually normal in children, procalcitonin may be a good diagnostic marker to detect COVID-19
in children. Nevertheless, procalcitonin was reported to be elevated in only 3% of all children
cases reported by Wang et al. 24. While laboratory data of infected children is limited and less
than adults, normal or temporary elevated CRP, conflicting WBC count results and procalcitonin
elevation are the most important laboratory reports of COVID-19 infected children (Table 1).
These different laboratory results may be due to more active innate immune response,
healthier respiratory tracts, and fewer underlying disorders in children as well as they are less
likely to be exposed with infected people or infected environments 22.
Laboratory findings of COVID-19 in adults
There are many reports regarding laboratory results of adult patients with COVID-19.
However, a large number of them did not categorize the patients’ age, therefore, they were
excluded from our study. In the study conducted by Xiao-Wei et al. on 62 COVID-19 adult
patients, the laboratory results were as follows: leucopenia (31%), lymphopenia (42%), high

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.20078568; this version posted April 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

level of LDH (27%), normal serum levels of procalcitonin (89%), normal platelet count (95%),
mean levels of AST, ALT, D-dimer, and hemoglobin were within the normal range as well 26. In
addition, Huang et al. reported that 63%, 25%, and 5% of patients had lymphopenia,
leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia, respectively. Normal procalcitonin levels were found in
69% of adult patients. Also, LDH levels were high in 73% of patients. Creatinine, CK, and AST
were elevated by 37%, 10% and 33% of patients, respectively. However, neutrophil count,
prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), albumin, hemoglobin, D-dimer, ALT,
sodium, and potassium were normal among patients 2. In the report of Yingxia et al. CRP and
LDH were high in 85% of patients. Fifteen percentage had leukocytosis and others had normal
WBC count. Forty-three percentage had lymphopenia. The neutrophil ratio was elevated in 57%
of patients. Platelet count was normal in all patients. Moreover, normal AST, ALT, and
procalcitonin levels were observed in 85%, 72%, and 85% patients, respectively, while 43%
showed low albumin levels

27.

In the Mingqiang et al. study on nine COVID-19 adult patients,

33% had normal blood routine tests, while abnormal diagnostic results were as follows: high
CRP (55%), lymphopenia (22%), leukocytosis (11%) and high procalcitonin levels (45%)

28.

Although it seems that lymphopenia and elevated LDH are more common, the results are very
different and conflicting in adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection (Table 1).
Laboratory findings of COVID-19 in elderly patients
Elderly people with underlying diseases including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and
diabetes are more susceptible to COVID-19

6,29.

It may be due to changes in the elderly's lung

anatomy and muscle atrophy leading to changes in respiratory system function. Because elderly
people with COVID-19 are prone to multi-system organ dysfunction 6, they may present
different laboratory outcomes. Early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in elderly patients is absolutely
essential because elderly patients especially those with underlying diseases are more
susceptible to severe illness and the mortality of them is higher 6,30. A study carried out by Kai
et al. demonstrated that lymphopenia in elderly COVID-19 confirmed patients was significantly
higher than that in the young and middle-aged groups. Furthermore, CRP was significantly
higher in elderly patients compared to young and middle-aged groups. Other laboratory results
including WBC count, neutrophil ratio, platelet, hemoglobin, procalcitonin, albumin, and serum

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.24.20078568; this version posted April 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

creatinine were not significantly different between the study groups 6. In the study of Fuk-Woo
et al. lymphopenia, low platelet count and elevated CRP were observed in all elderly patients.
LDH, activated PTT and fibrinogen were also elevated in all elderly patients. Similar to Kai et al.
results, WBC count, neutrophil ratio, hemoglobin, albumin, and creatinine were normal. Liver
function tests, CK, urea, and PT were also within the normal range 21. In Liu et al. report, CRP
and LDH were high in all elderly patients. Lymphopenia also detected in most of the old cases.
WBC count, albumin, liver enzymes, myoglobin, CK-MB, procalcitonin, blood urea nitrogen
(BUN), creatinine, and platelets were almost normal in all cases 27. Taken together, it is safe to
claim that lymphopenia and elevated CRP and LDH are tests that should be considered more
particularly in elderly COVID-19 people (Table 1).
Laboratory findings of COVID-19 in pregnant women
Pregnant women are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and severe pneumonia, because they
are at physiological adaptive changes and immunosuppressive state during pregnancy

31,32.

An

ample body of evidence has revealed that the clinical symptoms and laboratory findings of
infected pregnant women are atypical in comparison with the non-pregnant adults. The
leukocytosis and elevated neutrophil ratio were reported to more common in the COVID-19
infected pregnant women in the Liu et al study 33. However, there was no significant difference
regarding lymphopenia among pregnant and non-pregnant groups. CRP elevation is obvious in
most of the cases

33.

In the study of Wang et al., laboratory findings included high leukocyte

count, elevated neutrophil ratio, lymphopenia, and elevated CRP, D-dimer, and LDH. However,
aminotransferase levels and creatinine were reported in a normal range 34. Moreover, LIU et al.
reported that leukocytosis and elevated neutrophil ratio, elevated CRP and interleukin 6, and
low albumin are the main laboratory findings of pregnant women, while the normal amount of
ALT, AST, ferritin, and ESR were reported

35.

Chen et al. reported that among nine pregnant

women with COVID-19 pneumonia, 55% had lymphopenia. 66% had elevated concentrations of
CRP and 33% had increased concentrations of ALT and AST. Additionally, inconsistent with
other reports indicated leukocytosis and elevated neutrophil ratio, 77% of patients had a
normal WBC count 31. It seems that high CRP, leukocytosis and elevated neutrophil ratio are the
most reliable markers of COVID-19 among pregnant women and other laboratory tests are

conflicting (Table 1). Nevertheless, the physiological findings regarding leukocytosis and
elevated neutrophil ratio due to adaptations to gestation

33

can complicate the situation.

Comprehensive data on larger population of pregnant women with COVID-19 are needed to
better understanding the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on maternal and birth outcomes.
Conclusion
There is a crucial need to better recognize the full laboratory spectrum of COVID-19 in the
different populations in order to help early diagnosis of the disease. This review aimed to
describe the COVID-19 laboratory findings in neonates, children, adults, elderly and pregnant
women altogether for the first time in order to better comparison of laboratory results and
provide an insight about the diagnosis of the disease in different age populations. We showed
that the laboratory findings of COVID-19 confirmed pneumonia patients were very different
and conflicting, however, some tests are attracting more attention. Laboratory results of
neonates were very different and conflicting regardless of clinical symptoms, and CRP was
normal in the cases compared to other age categories though. Normal or temporary elevated
CRP, conflicting WBC count results and procalcitonin elevation are the most important
laboratory reports of COVID-19 infected children. With respect to adult patients, lymphopenia
and elevated LDH were more common. Lymphopenia and elevated CRP and LDH were markers
that should be considered more in elderly people. High CRP, leukocytosis and elevated
neutrophil ratio were the most reliable markers of COVID-19 among pregnant women.
Differences in the distribution, functioning and maturation of viral receptors is often mentioned
as a probable reason of the age-related differences in clinical and laboratory features on
COVID-19 patients

15.

There were many limitations including lack of age range clarification in

many reports, the low number of studies in neonates, children and pregnant women, small
sample size of some studies, different or lack of normal ranges of laboratory tests and
incomplete laboratory data reporting in previous studies.
