Abstract: Variables responsible for the differential
COVID-19 pandemic severity among countries remain
undefined. Zinc, a micronutrient required for
immunocompetence, is found deficient in populations.
We hypothesized the differential COVID-19 severity
observed among European countries could be
associated with the Zn-deficiency prevalence. The
COVID-19 data from different stages of pandemic, i.e.,
8 April, 12 and 26 May 2020, were analyzed for
covariation with the estimated Zn-deficiency. A
significant, relatively stable, but negative correlation
of Zn-deficiency with cases per million for the time
period [r(20): -0.4930 to -0.5335, p-value: 0.02720 to
0.0154] and a steady improvement of covariation with
deaths per million [r(20): -0.4056; p-value: 0.0760 on 26
May 2020] was observed. Considering, Zinc’s key
immunomodulatory role, widespread deficiency along
with the self- and prescribed intervention in different
target groups, e.g. children, women, elderly, carefully
planned dedicated exploratory studies to understand
the basis of the observed association are advisable.

I. INTRODUCTION
The world is currently in the middle of a novel
coronavirus, i.e., SARS-CoV-2 caused COVID-19
pandemic. The damage from COVID-19 had been
significant in terms of morbidity and mortality. More than
5.67 million people had been infected and over 351
thousand had already died worldwide by 26 May 2020
while more than 1.93 million infections and over 169
thousand deaths were reported from Europe alone
(Worldometers, 2020a). The unprecedented severity of
COVID-19 in Europe and North America in contrast to its
relatively benign course in the countries of Africa, Asia,
South America, and Oceania, had been baffling. Several
exploratory studies have been initiated based on
assumptions as well as our understanding of coronavirus

biology to identify and establish protective interventions
(WHO, 2020a; WHO, 2020b; Wikipedia, 2020). Recently, a
protective correlation between Vitamin D serum levels and
the cases and the deaths per million from COVID-19 had
been indicated in the European countries supposedly
having comparable confounding variables and similar
health care infrastructure (Ilie, Stefanescu & Smith, 2020;
Singh, Kaur & Singh, 2020). The association had been
reassuring given the established role of Vitamin D in
overall health and the protection offered from acute
respiratory tract diseases through an effect on the host’s
renin-angiotensin system comprising ACEs (Cannell,
Vieth, Umhau et al, 2006; Xu, Yang, Chen et al, 2017).
Identifying such potential protective variables is highly
desirable.
Zinc
is
essential
to
good
health
and
immunocompetence. Its deficiency is generally associated
with a negative impact on overall health, increased
susceptibility to disease, and infections (Prasad, 2013;
NIH, 2020; EFSA, 2006; Maares & Haase, 2020). In the
absence of reliable methods to assess the Zn status of a
population, the deficiency or inadequacy in a population is
estimated by combining the dietary intake by a population
as per FAO’s Food Balance Sheet and the estimated
prevalence of stunting (NIH, 2020; EFSA, 2006; Wessells
& Brown, 2012; Hess, 2017). Among micronutrients
associated with good health, the deficiency of Zinc is quite
prevalent ranging from about 5-50 % of the population
(Wessells & Brown, 2012). Its high prevalence is
associated with increased susceptibility to diseases,
mental capacity, complications, high morbidity, and
mortality in mothers and neonates (Prasad, 2013; NIH,
2020). Given its role in the overall human health and
wellbeing, the countries have tried to overcome the
problem through fortification of foods (Prasad, 2013; NIH,
2020; Maares & Haase, 2020; Wessells & Brown, 2012).
The countries from the high-income group that consumes
a more diverse micronutrient-rich diet are estimated to
have Zinc deficiency below 5-10 percent (Wessells &
Brown, 2012; Hess, 2017). Incidentally, these had been

the countries also worst affected by COVID-19
(Worldometers, 2020a).
Given the global prevalence of Zinc deficiency and its
role in human health as well as the immunocompetence
(Prasad, 2013; NIH, 2020; EFSA, 2006; Maares & Haase,
2020), we hypothesized that the incidence of COVID-19 in
populations (cases) and the adverse outcomes (deaths)
would be directly correlated to Zinc deficiency. The
analysis of European countries with comparable
underlying confounding variables when performed at
different stages of the pandemic was envisioned to provide
a more robust indication of the correlation as indicated
previously (Singh, Kaur & Singh, 2020). The primary aim
of the current study was to identify any correlation between
the prevalence of Zinc deficiency with the adverse
outcomes in the European countries. Additionally, we
intended to identify if it affected the number of cases per
unit population or crudely the spread of disease.
Surprisingly, our analysis of the selected European
countries indicated a consistently negative correlation of
Zinc deficiency with COVID-19 cases per million

populations over the time period and indicated an almost
significant correlation with the adverse outcome, i.e.,
death, which seemed improving with the passage of
pandemic.

II. MATERIAL AND METHODS
The European countries with seemingly comparable
confounding variables were considered for the analysis as
done previously (Ilie, Stefanescu & Smith, 2020; Singh,
Kaur & Singh, 2020). The cases and deaths per million
population data for COVID-19 from three time-points, i.e.,
8 April, 12 May, and 26 May 2020 (Table 1) were collected
from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ – the
coronavirus pandemic data portal. Most of the countries
were before COVID-19 infections peak on 8 April 2020
while on 12 and 26 May they were post and late post
infections peak stage. The Zinc deficiency estimate data
for different countries based on FAO’s food balance
datasheet and the prevalence of stunting in the countries
were obtained from the previously reported estimate by
Wessells & Brown, 2012. All basic statistical analysis of

the data, i.e., descriptive, linear regression, calculation of
best-fit trend line, Pearson correlation coefficient, and Rsquared value (R2) was performed in the Microsoft excel
as done previously (Singh, Kaur & Singh, 2020).

III. RESULTS
A negative correlation between the Zinc deficiency
prevalence estimate for the countries and the reported
cases of COVID-19 was consistently observed at all three
time-points analyzed that covered pre infections peak,
i.e.,8 April 2020, and post infections peak, i.e., 12 and 26
May 2020 (see Table 2). The Zinc deficiency of the
populations also negatively covaried with adverse

outcomes (mortality) per million populations and the
correlation seemed to better with the passage of the
current wave of COVID-19 infections. Refer to Table 2
below for the comparative estimate of the correlation and
Figure 1 for the correlative regression analysis of the data
set (R2=0.3936 for cases and R2=0.2831 for deaths per
million) on 26 May 2020. An exploratory estimation of the
correlation for COVID-19 affected countries of the world
that had seemingly comparable exposure to disease,
population structure, and health care response as on 12th
May 2020 (> 30,000 cases and upwards of 15,000 tests
performed per million of the population) and accounted for
63.7% of total cases, namely, Spain, UK, Russia, Italy,

France, Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland,
USA, Canada, seemed reassuring. For these eleven
countries, the Zn deficiency prevalence was exponentially
correlated to cases per million with R2 = 0.3301 and more
strongly to deaths per million with R2 = 0.4307 suggesting
a supposedly robust correlation and potential biological
significance.

IV. DISCUSSION
Our analysis identified a negative association between
the Zinc deficiency prevalence in the European countries
and the COVID-19 impact in terms of cases and deaths
per million of population. The observed covariation should
be evaluated for its biological significance, if any, by
evaluating COVID-19 patient data to allow its potential
translation into preventive measures.
In the absence of Zinc storage in the body, its daily
intake is required to maintain healthy levels (Prasad, 2013;
Maares & Haase, 2020). The recommended daily Zinc
intake varies with the age - increasing from 2 mg for
newborns to 8 mg for children 9-13 years old. Its
recommended intake is 11 mg for >14 years males while
8- 13 mg for females depending upon their physiological
status (NIH, 2020) or lower (EFSA, 2006). The countries of
Europe and North America have low Zinc deficiency as
compared to other parts of the world (Wessells & Brown,
2012; Hess, 2017), rather there exists chances of
excessive Zinc intake from food and supplements (NIH,
2020; EFSA, 2006). Considering the associated adverse
effect on immunity, lower level of HDL, low copper levels
its upper no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) and
tolerable upper intake limit (UL) have been defined by
EFSA as daily intake of 50 mg and 25 mg, respectively
(EFSA, 2006). For children and adolescents 1-17 years of
age, the recommended UL range is 7-22 mg based upon
age and body weight. Zinc deficiency is not considered as
a concern as for all the age groups the estimated 97.5
percentile of total Zinc intake is closer to the
recommended ULs (EFSA, 2006). In the USA, a 20%
reduced no adverse effect upper daily limit for Zinc has
been suggested, i.e., >40mg for people older than 18
years while for youngers it is from 4-34 mg depending
upon the age and body weight (NIH, 2020).
The estimated Zinc deficiency among the European
countries, though low, ranged from 3.1 % (Iceland) to
21.7% (Turkey) based upon their dietary preferences
(Wessells & Brown, 2012). Countries with a less diverse
diet, lower animal protein intake and increased intake of
phytate containing diet happen to have a higher
prevalence of Zinc deficiency. Generally, the countries with
higher Zn deficiency prevalence, e.g., Turkey (21.7%),
Slovakia (16.3%), Czechia (11%), Estonia (10.5%),

Germany (9%), Hungary (8.4%), Portugal (6.3%),
Denmark (6.2%), Norway (6.2%) had reported lesser no of
cases per million population as compared to lower Zinc
deficiency prevalence countries, e.g., Iceland (3.1), France
(3.9), Ireland (4%), UK (4.6%) Switzerland (4.9%) Spain
(5.4%), Italy (5.8%). However, the difference in the rate of
deaths reported per million population by the above
indicated differentially Zinc deficient countries was lesser.
Worldwide estimates indicate lower adverse outcomes
from COVID-19 in children, adolescents, and women
(Worldometers, 2020b). The Zinc deficiency in children,
adolescents, women, vegetarians, and alcoholics is
widespread (NIH, 2020; EFSA, 2006). Among the
countries of Europe, the children, adolescents, and women
seemed to be relatively less affected (Worldometers,
2020b). These are the same constituents of the population
that tend to have higher Zinc needs and associated
physiological deficiency in the body and have a higher
prevalence of Zinc deficiency as compared to the
estimated deficiency prevalence in the population (NIH,
2020; EFSA, 2006; Maares & Haase, 2020; Wessells &
Brown, 2012; Hess, 2017). Interestingly, women appear to
be more protected from COVID-19 than males in
European countries (Worldometers, 2020b). The COVID19 associated mortality in women is estimated to be about
two-fold lower than that in men. Remarkably, women tend
to have a higher prevalence of Zinc deficiency deviating
about two fold from that estimated for a population as per
surveys performed in low and middle-income countries
(Hess, 2017). The relationship may be coincidental or
causal only later studies can reveal.
Elderly people (>60-65 years) in Europe had been
affected most by COVID-19. Although there is insufficient
data to reliably estimate the Zinc deficiency in the elderly,
it is perceived to be quite prevalent in the elderly with less
than 50% of daily recommended intake being common
(Mocchegiani, Romeo, Malavolta et al, 2013). Despite the
lower Zinc levels in elderly, the altered Zn homeostasis
(lower intercellular availability), altered interplay with
copper
and
Iron
homeostasis,
the
supposed
immunosenescence and Zinc level alteration as a result of
fortification, supplementation, and medication (NIH, 2020;
EFSA, 2006; Maares & Haase, 2020) along with other
underlying pathologies could be responsible for the
relatively higher mortality in the elderly (Worldometers,
2020b). The existence of potential correlations may be
established by future epidemiological studies.

V. CONCLUSION
A negative correlation between Zinc deficiency and the
COVID-19 infections and mortality is observed in
European countries. The basis as well as biological

significance of such an observation, if any, is unknown.
Carefully designed studies investigating the basis of
increased vulnerability of target groups and the elderly
could reveal the role of Zinc and other key micronutrients
such as Cu, Fe and Se in COVID-19 and may help devise
better strategies for future COVID-19 control. If the
observed correlation is to be believed as having cause and
effect relationship, it may be predicted that the inherently
or transiently higher Zinc levels resulting from
supplementation or medication may be associated with
higher COVID-19 infections and mortality in patients. A
scrutiny of the COVID-19 patients’ data for potential Zinc
status alteration, such as resulting from the intake of
vitamin C, organic acids, animal protein, phytate content
along with Zinc supplementation and the administration of
Zn status altering drugs such as Hydroxychloroquine
would shed light on the biological significance of the
observed covariation of the prevalence of Zinc deficiency
with COVID-19 cases and mortality in different target
populations and its potential preventive role. So, more
evidence-gathering follow-up exercises for the closer
scrutiny of the COVID-19 patients' medical records,
including the micronutrient supplementation and food
consumption details is advisable to ascertain the role of
Zinc or other key micronutrients on COVID-19 pandemic
and potentially find an early solution to COVID-19.
