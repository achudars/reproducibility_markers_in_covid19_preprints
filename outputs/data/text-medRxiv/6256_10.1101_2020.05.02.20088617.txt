Abstract
Since the first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID19) in the 2nd day of March, Saudi Arabia has not report a quite rapid
COVD-19 spread compared to America and many European countries.
Possible causes include the spread of asymptomatic cases. To characterize the transmission of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, this paper applies a
susceptible, exposed, symptomatic, asymptomatic, hospitalized, and recovered dynamical model, along with the official COVID-19 reported data
by the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia. The basic reproduction number R0 is estimated to range from 2.87 to 4.9.
Keywords: COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia, SEIR model, Simulation.

Introduction

As of April 22, 2020, more than 12772 cases and 114 deaths of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus had been confirmed in
Saudi Arabia. Since the 4th of March [17], control measures have been implemented within Saudi Arabia to try to control the spread of the disease. Isolation
of confirmed cases and contact tracing are crucial part of these measures, which
are common interventions for controlling infectious disease outbreaks [26–28].
For example, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak SARS and
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), were controlled through tracing suspected cases and isolating confirmed cases because the majority of transmission
occurred concurrent or after symptom onset [27–29].
However, it is unknown if transmission of COVID-19 can occur before symptom onset, which could decrease the effectiveness of isolation and contact tracing [26, 27, 29].

In this paper, the impact of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases on the spread
of the disease will be considered using a modified version of the susceptibleexposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) dynamical model, along with the official COVID19 data reported by the ministry of health in Saudi Arabia. Other main objectives of this paper include: estimating the basic reproduction number (R0 )
of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia and how interacting with infected individual
(symptomatic and asymptomatic) affect the estimated number, estimating the
maximum required number of hospital beds and intensive care units (ICU).

Model establishment

The population will be divided into six categories: susceptible (S), exposed
(E), symptomatic (Y ), asymptomatic (N ), hospitalized (H), and recovered (R)
individuals (SEYNHR). Individuals moves from the susceptible compartment
S to the exposed compartment E after interacting with infected individuals
with transmission rates β1 , β2 , and β3 as shown in Figure 1. COVID-19 is

the black ones, represent progression from one compartment to the next.
known to have an incubation period, from 2 to 14 days, between exposure
and development of symptoms [6, 30]. After this period, exposed individual
transits from the compartment E to either compartment Y at a rate α, or to
compartment N at a rate α(1−γ). An individual could move from compartment
N to Y at a rate K if they show symptoms. Once an individual becomes infected
with the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, that individual develops immunity
against the virus with a rate ΦY or the individual will be hospitalized with a rate
of  or die because of the disease with a rate of µ1 . When individual becomes
hospitalized, that individual receives treatment and develops immunity against
the virus with a rate r or die because of the disease with a rate of µ2 .
As shown in Figure 1, the SEYNHR model has six compartments, and there-

metric for assessing the transmission potential of an emerging COVID19 in Saudi
Arabia.

Basic reproduction number R0

An important concept in epidemiology is the basic reproduction number, defined as “the expected number of secondary cases produced, in a completely
susceptible population, by a typical infective individual” [10]. The next generation method will be used to calculate R0 [11]. The system in Equation 1 can
be rewritten as follows

Results

At the initial time t = 0, if we set the initial population N (0) = 1, then
N (0) = S(0)+E(0)+Y (0)+N (0)+H(0)+R(0) = 1. The transition probabilities
between states are all in the range of [0, 1], i.e.,
0 ≤ A, β1 , β2 , β3 , µ, α, γ, ΦY , , µ1 , K, ΦN , r, µ2 ≤ 1.
I fitted the model in Equation 1 to the published data from the Ministry of
Health in Saudi Arabia (MOH) from 2nd day of March until the 14th of April to
estimate values for the unknown parameters β1 , β2 , β3 and K using MATLAB.
The results are shown in the upper panel of Figure 2. Increasing the value of
K from 0.009/day requires increasing the value of β1 , β2 and β3 from 0.267,
0.53 and 0.13 (day x individual)−1 to 0.5, 1 and 0.26 (day x individual)−1 ,
respectively. All other parameters and their descriptions are given in Table 1.
I assumed that the mean asymptomatic infectious period is the same as the
mean symptomatic infectious period because there is no estimation available in
the literature [9, 29]. Based on those estimated, assumed and measured values,
the basic reproduction number R0 is estimated to range from 2.87 to 4.9. The
variation of the basic reproduction number R0 for different values of β1 , β2 , ΦY ,
ΦN and K are shown in the heat maps in Figure 3. The upper heat map of
Figure 3 shows that practicing physical distancing could significantly reduce the
value of R0 and hence control the spread of the disease.
The center panel of Figure 2 shows that about 18% of the entire Saudi population will be asymptomatic in the last week of May 2020 and about 17% will
be exposed in the third week of May. The percentage of the entire population
being symptomatic at anytime will not exceed 1%, which is estimated to occur in the third week of May. Moreover, about 60000 hospital beds and 18000
ICU beds are required (30% of the hospitalized cases [6]) immediately after the
second week of May. Currently, the Ministry of Health designated 25 hospitals
for COVID-19 infected patients with up to 80,000 beds and 8000 intensive care
units (ICU) beds [25] and therefore extra 10000 ICU beds could be required.

Discussion

The parameter with the hight degree of uncertainty are the effective contact
rates from symptomatic to susceptible β1 , from asymptomatic to susceptible
β2 and from hospitalized to susceptible β3 (expected to be a fraction of β1
because of the protective measures in hospitals), as well as the mean infectious
−1
periods for symptomatic Φ−1
Y and asymptomatic ΦN individuals. I estimated
a maximum value of β1 to be 0.5 which is one half of the value reported by Li
et al. [18]. This could be a reasonable estimation as we have not seen similar
scenario in Saudi Arabia after 5 weeks since reaching 100 confirmed cases on
the 14th of March (week 7 since the first case) as we have seen in many other
countries like China, America and different European countries in the same
timescale. This could be a result of the precautionary measures taken by the
Saudi authorities, including closure of schools and universities that started as
early as the 8th of March (six days after the first confirmed COVID-19 case
in Saudi Arabia). Based on the above estimation for R0 , the center panel of
Figure 3 suggests that the infectious period for symptomatic patient could be
in the range from 6.6 to 12.5 days (i.e., ΦY ∈ [0.08, 0.15]) and the infectious
period for asymptomatic patient could be in the range from 6.6 to 25 days (i.e.,
ΦN ∈ [0.04, 0.15]). The infectious period for symptomatic cases are consistent
with what is being observed clinically [30].
In reality, R0 is not a biological constant; it could fluctuate daily depending
on environmental and social factors such as percentage of entire susceptible

population wearing suitable medical mask and practicing physical distancing.
In the literature, estimates of R0 vary greatly: from 1 to 6 [18–24] up to 26.5
[9]. This variation is because of different assumptions and factors they had
considered in the calculations. In general, considering asymptomatic infection
sub-population will increase the estimated values of R0 .

Conclusion

The contribution of undocumented COVID-19 infections (asymptomatic cases)
on the transmission of the disease deserves further studies and investigations.
This paper shows that asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 will drive the growth
of the pandemic in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, more testing is needed to identify
COVID-19 patients (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and to contain the spread
of the disease.
