Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged from a zoonotic spillover event and has led to a global pandemic. The public health response has been predominantly
informed by surveillance of symptomatic individuals and contact tracing, with quarantine, and
other preventive measures have then been applied to mitigate further spread. Non-traditional
methods of surveillance such as genomic epidemiology and wastewater-based epidemiology
(WBE) have also been leveraged during this pandemic. Genomic epidemiology uses highthroughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to inform local and international transmission
events, as well as the diversity of circulating variants. WBE uses wastewater to analyse
community spread, as it is known that SARS-CoV-2 is shed through bodily excretions. Since both
symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals contribute to wastewater inputs, we hypothesized that
the resultant pooled sample of population-wide excreta can provide a more comprehensive
picture of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity circulating in a community than clinical testing and
sequencing alone. In this study, we analysed 91 wastewater samples from 11 states in the USA,
where the majority of samples represent Maricopa County, Arizona (USA). With the objective of
assessing the viral diversity at a population scale, we undertook a single-nucleotide variant (SNV)
analysis on data from 52 samples with >90% SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage of sequence reads,
and compared these SNVs with those detected in genomes sequenced from clinical patients. We
identified 7973 SNVs, of which 5680 were “novel” SNVs that had not yet been identified in the
global clinical-derived data as of 17th June 2020 (the day after our last wastewater sampling date).
However, between 17th of June 2020 and 20th November 2020, almost half of the SNVs have
since been detected in clinical-derived data. Using the combination of SNVs present in each
sample, we identified the more probable lineages present in that sample and compared them to
lineages observed in North America prior to our sampling dates. The wastewater-derived SARSCoV-2 sequence data indicates there were more lineages circulating across the sampled
communities than represented in the clinical-derived data. Principal coordinate analyses identified
patterns in population structure based on genetic variation within the sequenced samples, with
clear trends associated with increased diversity likely due to a higher number of infected
individuals relative to the sampling dates. We demonstrate that genetic correlation analysis
combined with SNVs analysis using wastewater sampling can provide a comprehensive snapshot
of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic population structure circulating within a community, which might not
be observed if relying solely on clinical cases.
1. Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the bigest pandemic since
the 1918 H1N1 influenza A virus (Wang et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak
in humans likely emerged from a zoonotic transmission event(s), and was first recorded in
December, 2019, in the City of Wuhan, China (Andersen et al., 2020; Boni et al., 2020; Zhang
and Holmes, 2020). According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center (Dong et al.,
2020), there have been >95 million confirmed cases, resulting in more than >2 million deaths
globally as of 18th January 2021. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus in
the family Coronaviridae (Gorbalenya et al., 2020) that can cause a range of symptoms in infected

individuals including complications with breathing, dry cough, fever, and diarrhoea (Wang et al.,
2020). However, the majority of individuals show little to no symptoms (Buitrago-Garcia et al.,
2020; Byambasuren et al., 2020; Kimball et al., 2020; Syangtan et al., 2020).
Clinical testing of individuals for SARS-CoV-2 is the primary surveillance method for informing
public health strategic interventions, and essential for implementing preventive measures, such
as quarantine, to mitigate the spread of the virus. The most frequently used approach for clinical
testing relies on the detection of genomic elements of SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) based methods (CDC, 2020a; WHO). The
clinical analysis is now also being complemented with antibody-based assays (Adams et al.,
2020; Becker et al., 2020; Bryant et al., 2020; CDC, 2020b; WHO) that provide an indication of
current or previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies are being used to sequence the SARS-CoV-2
genome from a subset of the infected population globally using clinical samples. This has resulted
in over >278,000 published genomes (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017; Shu and McCauley,
2017), and has provided insight into its origins, spread, and diversity via computational
approaches in genomic epidemiology. Screening/testing of a large number of individuals for
SARS-CoV-2 can be challenging particularly from a logistics perspective due to sample collection
and transportation, availability and storage of assay reagents, and the rapid turnaround time
needed for test results to be most informative to healthcare outcomes and pandemic
management. Furthermore, in most countries it is largely the symptomatic population that is
targeted for testing and therefore a large proportion of infected asymptomatic individuals may be
missed.
Nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva samples have been the principal sample types used for
screening; however, SARS-CoV-2 has also been detected in other clinical specimens such as
faeces, from both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals (Chen et al., 2020; Jones
et al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020; Xing et al., 2020). Moreover, of late, wastewater
samples have been utilized as a way to identify several pathogenic human viruses and, not
surprisingly, it has gained attention for assessing population-level trends of SARS-CoV-2
infections.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater (untreated and treated) has been a focus of research,
with feasibility highlighted in the review by Farkas et al. (2020) and with reported studies from
locations including North America (D'Aoust et al., 2021; Nemudryi et al., 2020; Peccia et al., 2020;
Wu et al., 2020), Europe (Balboa et al., 2020; Kocamemi et al., 2020; La Rosa et al., 2020;
Medema et al., 2020; Randazzo et al., 2020; Westhaus et al., 2021; Wurtzer et al., 2020), Asia
(Kumar et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) and Oceania (Ahmed et al., 2020). These studies used a
range of sample concentration and viral RNA recovery approaches followed by RT-qPCR
amplification to detect and determine the viral load. These proof of concept studies demonstrated
the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and identified trends indicating wastewater
monitoring can serve as a useful early warning tool for informing public health (Farkas et al.,
2020). Although some studies did verify, by sequencing, the RT-qPCR products were indeed

detecting SARS-CoV-2, most rely on the threshold cycle (Ct) values of RT-qPCR assays. Beyond
this, two recent studies have sequenced the SARS-CoV-2 genomes recovered from wastewater
(Crits-Christoph et al., 2021; Izquierdo Lara et al., 2020).
Despite the promising success of these prior studies, it is still unclear how well wastewater-based
epidemiology can identify the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in a given population and how this
relates to known viral diversity of clinical cases. This is especially important as new lineages are
being discovered. For example, the B.1.351 strain in the United Kingdom that contains singlenucleotide variants (SNVs) of potential biological significance such as N501Y (in the spike protein)
(Rambaut et al., 2020b) and K417N, E484K and N501Y in South Africa (Tegally et al., 2020). To
investigate the potential of using wastewater to gain insights into variants of SARS-CoV-2
circulating in the population, we used a tiling amplicon-based high-throughput sequencing
approach to determine SARS-CoV-2 sequences (spanning the genome) in 91 wastewater
samples collected from 11 states in the United States (USA) between 7th April 2020 and 16th June
2020. To further survey the viral diversity circulating within a community and to examine how
these relate to sequences from clinical cases, we undertook SNV analysis and beta diversity
analyses of SARS-CoV-2 sequences in 52 (>90% coverage) out of the 91 wastewater samples
from 10 states. We focused specifically on spatial and temporal trends, and how they compare
with clinically-derived data.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Sample collection and transport
Flow- or time-weighted, 24-hr composite samples of untreated wastewater were collected either
from the headworks of the wastewater treatment plant, from within the wastewater collection
system or at hospital facilities using high frequency automated samplers (Teledyne ISCO, USA)
from locations across 11 states in the USA between 7th April 2020 and 16th June 2020 (Table 1,
Figure 1A, Sup Figure 1). Most samplers had refrigeration capabilities or were supplied with an
ice/dry ice blend to keep the interior collection vessel cool. During sample collection, wastewater
was thoroughly mixed and transferred to high-density polyethylene sample bottles and placed on
ice for transport. The samples were either hand delivered or shipped (next-day/2-day) in insulated
shipping containers for subsequent processing and analysis.
2.2. Wastewater sample processing and RNA extraction
Aliquots of 150 ml of each composite wastewater sample were filtered through a 0.45 μm
polyethersulfone (PES) filter and then subsequently through a 0.2 μm (PES) filter. The filtrate was
then concentrated using the Amicon® Ultra 15 Centrifugal Filter Units (MilliporeSigma, USA) by
centrifuging at 4500 rpm for 15 min. For each sample, the process was repeated five times in total
using two filter units, and subsequently the concentrates were pooled per sample (from the two
filter units). For each sample, a 200 μl aliquot was used to extract total RNA using the RNeasy
mini kit (Qiagen, USA).

2.3. SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR detection and high throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2
genome sequences
To determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples, the extracted RNA was used
in a reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay targeting the E gene, as designed
and validated by Corman et al. (2020) and cited by the World Health Organisation (WHO) (WHO,
2020a). This probe-based assay was performed as per the specifications outlined in Corman et
al. (2020) using the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen, USA). This assay
was validated and used by Holland et al. (2020) on SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples.
91 samples from 11 states in the USA (Figure 1) were collected between 7th April 2020 and 16th
June 2020 that tested positive, and one negative control sample collected in October 2019 in
Tempe, Arizona (Table 1) were selected for sample processing and high-throughput SARS-CoV2 amplicon sequencing. The SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay Ct values ranged from 26.8 to 36 for
the 91 samples. Total RNA (11 l) from each sample was used to generate cDNA using the
Superscript® IV First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher, USA). The manufacturer's
protocol was followed, with one modification, the reverse transcription incubation step (50ºC) was
increased from 10 to 50 min. 10 μl of cDNA from each sample was used to generate Illumina
sequencing libraries (92 libraries in total) with the Swift Nomalase® Amplicon SARS CoV-2 Panel
(SNAP) and these were subsequently normalized, pooled and sequenced at Psomagen (USA)
on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer (2×100 paired-end option on 1 lane in rapid mode).
2.4. Bioinformatics pipeline and analyses
The Illumina raw read sequences were aligned to the reference genome of SARS-CoV-2
(MN908947; RefSeq ID NC_045512.2) using the Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA) MEM
(Li and Durbin, 2009). The primers used for the tiling PCR-based amplification step were softclipped using iVAR trim tool (Grubaugh et al., 2019) which also removed reads <30nts and reads
that started outside of the primer region. Trimming with a sliding window of 4 for a minimum
PHRED quality of 20 was performed as default by iVAR. Primers that may have mismatches with
the reference sequence were also evaluated and reads from those amplicons with varying primer
binding efficiency were also removed as described by Grubaugh et al. (2019). The genome
coverage (minimum quality of 20 and 10× coverage) and mean depth was calculated for all
samples. Variant calling was performed using iVAR (Grubaugh et al., 2019) with minimum base
quality of 20 and 20× coverage with no cut-off frequency since we have population-level sequence
data. From the variants that were identified, only those with a p-value <0.05 in the Fisher's exact
test implemented in iVAR (tests if SNV frequency is higher than the mean error rate at the specific
position) were maintained. Suggested masked sites due to biases shown by phylogenetic analysis
or sequencing technology (De Maio et al., 2020) as of September 2020 were removed for
downstream analyses. To identify the novel SNVs, the obtained SNVs from the 52 wastewater
samples with SARS-CoV-2 read coverage >90% were searched in the clinical data available in
GISAID (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017; Shu and McCauley, 2017) at two time points (17th
June 2020 and 20th November 2020). Variants that were not present in the GISAID deposited

SARS-CoV-2 genomes were considered novel, however, to be more stringent, variants that were
only present in one of the wastewater samples were removed from further analyses.
2.5. Support for lineages assigned by PANGOLIN
Each environmental sample was compared against the SARS-CoV-2 genomes available in
GISAID (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017; Shu and McCauley, 2017), an open-access genomic
database, to collect a set of clinical genomes whose mutations were supported by the SNVs
identified above. To reduce false positives, basal genomes, defined as those with 3 or fewer
mutations relative to the reference (MN908947) were excluded. The set of genomes supported
by each environmental sample SNV profile were grouped by lineages assigned by PANGOLIN
(Rambaut et al., 2020a) and lineages with fewer than 3 genomes were excluded to avoid any
misannotations resulting in false positives. PANGOLIN is an online platform that assigns lineages
to sequences (Rambaut et al., 2020a) and is updated as new metadata are submitted to GISAID.
For each group of genomes (grouped per PANGOLIN), we then looked to see whether any
genome was from North America and, if so, recorded the time between the genome’s sampling
date and the collection date of the environmental sample. Note that the set of genomes which we
summarize as certain SARS-CoV-2 lineages assigned by PANGOLIN may be different for each
environmental sample, and thus the time between clinical and environmental sampling dates
depends on the particular SNV profile of the environmental sample. Given that linkage of SNVs
is not possible via short read sequencing, support for mutation profiles observed in clinical
genomes (and, correspondingly, PANGOLIN) does not guarantee that the lineages were present
in the environmental sample.
2.6. Sample-based SARS-CoV-2 sequence distance calculation and ordination analysis
The ‘genotype’ of each sample was represented in a four-column matrix. In this matrix, each row
corresponds to a position in the reference genome, and the value at each column is the frequency
of occurrences for each nucleotide (A, C, G and T). At each genomic position, the Yue & Clayton
measure of dissimilarity index (Yue and Clayton, 2005) on the nucleotide frequency of the
compared samples was calculated. If the nucleotide frequency at a position of a sample cannot
be calculated due to zero depth, the Yue & Clayton measure of dissimilarity index at this position
between this sample and any other sample compared is assumed to be zero. The sum of the Yue
& Clayton dissimilarity (Yue and Clayton, 2005) of all genomic positions was used as a measure
of distance between samples. The distance matrix was constructed by calculating pairwise
distances of all samples and was subsequently used for principal coordinates analysis (PCoA)
(Gower, 1966).
3. Results and discussion

A sample collected in October 2019 in Tempe, Arizona was processed as a negative control. The
samples were processed using a virus concentration approach, followed by RNA extraction and
screening for the SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR targeting the E gene. A standard curve with SARSCoV-2 synthetic RNA (Twist Bioscience, USA) was used to estimate viral load and to establish
the limit of detection. Based on the standard curve we determined a consistent limit detection with
a Ct-value of ~34.0. For the samples we analysed, the Ct-values ranged from 26.8 to 36 (Table
1, Figure 1B).
3.2. Amplification and high-throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 from wastewater
samples
The tiling PCR amplification enrichment process for the SARS-CoV-2 genome generated 341
amplicons covering ~99% of the genome albeit missing the 200 nts of 5’ end and 162 nts from 3’
end. The genome coverage calculated for all samples ranged between ~1.3% and ~99%. 52 of
the 91 RT-qPCR positive samples showed >90% coverage (minimum quality of 20 and >10 reads
per position) (Table 1). We note that there is no clear correlation between coverage and Ct values
obtained using the RT-qPCR assay (Figure 1). This has been shown in other wastewater-derived
viral sequencing projects using an Illumina sequencing platforms via an amplification process
(Izquierdo Lara et al., 2020) and a capture approach (Crits-Christoph et al., 2021). This lack of
correlation is not unexpected given the nature of wastewater, where dilution and degradation play
a significant role, thereby this likely results in samples with differing levels of genomic RNA
degradation. Furthermore, since the RT-qPCR assay only targets a specific small region of the
genome, the Ct-value based quantification vary. Additionally, it is important to highlight that there
are variabilities attributed to the handling and transport process of the wastewater samples prior
to concentration and RNA extraction.
3.3. Wastewater-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequence analyses
For the 52 samples with >90% genome coverage, SNV analysis was undertaken using the
program iVAR (minimum quality of 20 and >20 reads per position) without a frequency threshold
in order to detect all variations at a population level. This approach was used because, unlike the
case with a clinical sample from a single infected individual, wastewater contains material from a
population that inhabits a particular region and therefore represents a collection of SARS-CoV-2
variants actively shed by infected individuals within the population. The detected SNVs with pvalue >0.05 in the Fisher’s exact test were excluded and also a priori suggested masked sites
due to biases shown by phylogenetic analysis and sequencing technology (De Maio et al., 2020)
were excluded from this analysis.
A total of 7973 SNVs were detected for the 52 analysed samples after quality control steps from
which the number of detected SNVs per sample ranged from 24 to 793 (Supp. Table 1, Figure
2A). As expected, mean depth is correlated with the number of SNVs detected in each sample
(Figure 2B), the regression analysis indicates the trend.

To determine unique variants within the 52 wastewater-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences, SNVs
counted in more than one sample at each site were removed and this resulted in 5680 unique
SNVs identified across the genome. Of these, 4372 are non-synonymous and 1308 are
synonymous substitutions. Additionally, 246 are nonsense mutations and 64 are in non-coding
regions. We highlight that SNV A23403G responsible for the spike protein substitution D614G
that is frequently seen in clinical data, although it has not thus far been shown to be under strong
positive selection (Volz et al., 2021), was present in all 52 wastewater-derived SARS-CoV-2
sequences. From one sample (sample #147, Tempe, Arizona), a new variant A23403T was also
identified that results in a D614V substitution in the spike protein, but at very low frequency (Sup.
Table 1).
3.4. Comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 SNVs in clinical and wastewater-derived
samples during the collection period
The wastewater-derived SARS-CoV-2 SNVs were compared with substitutions that have been
detected in clinical-derived sequences. The first aim was to identify possible “novel” SNVs present
in the analysed wastewater samples that had not yet been identified in any of the sequences
available in GISAID (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017; Shu and McCauley, 2017) from clinical
samples globally. To accomplish this, we initially undertook an analysis to identify all the detected
SNVs in the clinical data available from GISAID up until the 17th June 2020 (subsequent to the
last day of wastewater sampling in this study - 16th June 2020) which on that date consisted of
45,836 SARS-Cov-2 genome sequences. A total of 548 novel SNVs were identified in the 52
wastewater samples collectively, of these 469 were non-synonymous (not including nonsense
mutations) and 79 were synonymous substitutions (Figure 3). Since we evaluated all variants
regardless of frequency, some locations (as expected) had more than one possible variant and
are illustrated in Figure 3 and outlined in Sup Table 1. These 548 SNVs are distributed along the
SARS-CoV-2 genome with three of those located in non-coding regions. The vast majority of
“novel” SNVs were detected in up to 8 of the wastewater samples analysed. The exceptions are
four non-synonymous mutations, three on the ORF1ab and one in the N gene that are present in
>8 samples (Figure 3 and Sup table 1).
3.5. Identification of SARS-CoV-2 SNVs in wastewater samples in clinical-derived samples
post-collection period
To determine how many SNVs have been identified post wastewater sample collection (16th June
2020), a second SNV comparison was performed with all the clinical-derived sequence data
available as of 20th November 2020 (203,741 SARS-Cov-2 genomes available at GISAID). Based
on the analysis of samples during the collection period, SNVs that were not detected in the clinicalderived sequence data were considered as novel SNVs. From the 548 SNVs considered as
“novel” from the wastewater-derived samples, 263 SNVs have subsequently been identified in
clinical-derived samples in the period of 17th June - 20th November 2020 (Sup Table 1, Figure 3).
285 SNVs identified in the wastewater-derived samples with the last sampling date of 16th June
2020 have not been identified in clinical-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences between then and 20th
November 2020.

It is important to highlight that the detection of these “novel” SNVs does not necessarily indicate
they are fixed in SARS-CoV-2 lineages that are actively being transmitted nor is it possible to
determine if any of these SNVs are linked within lineages. Nonetheless, the identification of the
“novel” SNVs clearly demonstrates the relevance of wastewater-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequence
analysis which can provide valuable information on SNVs that are not captured using clinicalderived approaches. The wastewater-derived sequence analysis does provide information at a
population scale and can allow for rapid detection of clinically relevant / important SNVs.
3.6. Determination of putative lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater-derived sequences
Given that wastewater harbours a collective population of SARS-CoV-2 and therefore likely many
variants, it is not ideal to determine consensus sequences and consensus sequences-based
phylogeny. Therefore, our first approach was to evaluate which clades in the global phylogeny of
clinical-derived sequences are supported by the SNVs present in each sample based on the
SARS-CoV-2 lineages assigned by PANGOLIN (Rambaut et al., 2020a). The represented SARSCoV-2 lineages for each wastewater sample that are supported are shown in Figure 4. We
determined the time frames for which these lineages were first detected in North American
clinical-derived sequences relative to the date each wastewater sample was collected (Figure
4A).
We also undertook a comprehensive analysis of all the lineages detected in each state in the USA
up to November 2020 that were supported by at least one environmental sample, this included
the number of clinical-derived SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced in each lineage (Figure 4B).
This approach helps to determine whether wastewater-based surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 can
provide valuable insights on putative circulating lineages in the wastewater contributing
population. Although there are several limitations to the analysis of wastewater-derived SARSCoV-2 sequences, our analysis of SNV-based supported lineages revealed some interesting
findings. From the 52 analysed wastewater samples, 15 SARS-CoV-2 lineages assigned by
PANGOLIN (Rambaut et al., 2020a) were supported, with lineage B.1.5 being the most prominent
for the wastewater-derived sequences. The B.1.5 lineage has been identified in clinical samples
in 27 USA states. Our wastewater-derived sequence data suggests that B.1.5 may also be
present in 6 additional states in the USA (Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky and New
Jersey). In 17 of the 52 wastewater samples, there were up to two supported SARS-CoV-2
lineages that had not been detected in North American clinical samples, during the period of our
wastewater collection, as of 17th June 2020 (Figure 4). These 17 samples were from the states of
Arizona, Kentucky and Massachusetts (Figure 4B). In wastewater-derived sequences from
Arizona, which represents the greatest proportion of samples, the observed circulating lineages
based on clinical-derived sequences are well represented (Ladner et al., 2020), with an additional
nine possible circulating lineages identified.
Although wastewater-based SARS-CoV-2 sequence analysis does not provide the same level of
genome confidence (and thus lineage assignment) as those from clinical samples, the
wastewater-derived data can be used to identify possible circulating lineages and assess the

diversity of SARS-CoV-2. We would like to emphasize that despite us identifying supported
lineages based on SNVs analysis, without verification of full genomes using long read sequencing
technologies it is not possible to confirm all the specific lineages present in the wastewater.
Nevertheless, it is apparent that valuable population-level variant information on SARS-CoV-2
can be gleaned from wastewater sampling, including significant sequence data that are potentially
missed in clinical-derived sequence data where genomes are sequenced from predominantly
infected individuals who might represent a small percentage of those shedding virus in a
community.
3.7. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) analysis of nucleotide frequencies to diversity
estimate
In Figure 5, we show our PCoA analysis results using nucleotide frequencies to evaluate the viral
population diversity within and between samples. SARS-CoV-2 sequences in the samples from
the ten states were overall highly diverse, and those with two or more samples from the same
state tend to cluster closer together (Figure 5). The main exceptions are those from Kansas (20th
May 2020 and 27th May 2020) and Colorado (20th May 2020 and 28th May 2020) that do not cluster
together, both were collected a week apart, and the locations have an estimated human
population size of ~25,900 and ~8,300, respectively. Additionally, the Arizona wastewater SARSCoV-2 sequences are broadly distributed in the PCoA plot which is likely a consequence of the
large number of samples collected over a three-month period across several sites within Maricopa
County, Arizona (Tempe sites, Guadalupe and Gilbert) (Figure 5A, B and C). In comparison to
those in the Arizona wastewater samples, the SARS-CoV-2 sequences in samples from Louisville
(Kentucky) are much more tightly clustered in the PCoA plot despite sampling from several
locations in the city over a two-month period (Figure 5A). Despite the large number of samples
collected in Arizona compared to Kentucky, and the other states, if seven individual samples were
to be randomly picked from each location over the same period as those from Kentucky the SARSCoV-2 genetic distance between them would still be apparently higher for Arizona. We
hypothesize that one contributing factor to the differences in viral diversity present in these two
areas i.e. Maricopa County Arizona and Louisville (Kentucky), is that, Tempe (the region where
the majority of the samples were collected) is home to one of the largest universities in the USA,
Maricopa County is the 4th most populous county in the USA with ~4.4 million inhabitants
(Maricopa County 2020) and a major travel hub with an international airport.
The highest number of samples collected within a state both temporally and spatially for this study
was in Arizona. In Arizona, we note that the wastewater-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences in
samples from the same locations do not necessarily cluster together in the PCoA plot (Figure 5C).
Nonetheless, there are clear shifts in the SARS-CoV-2 sequence variants in each location over
time (Figure 5B and C). This is most evident for the Town of Guadalupe (Arizona) given the
sampling effort here, where the SARS-CoV-2 sequences in the samples collected in early May
2020 cluster with lower distance but we can see a clear shift in the viral population starting late
May 2020 through to early June (Figures 5B and C) which coincides with stay at home lockdown
being lifted on 15th May 2020. It is important to highlight that the Town of Guadalupe (Arizona)
has a small resident community (~6,500) from where wastewater was collected. Moreover, SARS10

CoV-2 sequences in the samples from the same location at closer timepoints are often more likely
to be similar, yet there are exceptions such as the samples from site TP04 (Tempe, Arizona) that
have no resident population (Figure 5B and C). The shift in SARS-CoV-2 sequence diversity in
locations such as TP04 (Tempe, Arizona) over time may be due to new infections given the
transient population.
Increases in SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in wastewater have been correlated to an increase in the
number of cases locally (Medema et al., 2020). Observing a shift in the SARS-CoV-2 population
diversity through wastewater analysis with time provides insights into corresponding dynamics of
increased infection in the community. For example, in Tempe, the number of recorded cases
nearly doubled in June 2020. When analysing wastewater-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequence data
and correlating it with human dynamics, business districts in the cities will certainly see the activity
of transient community members and this will likely reflect in sequence diversity data.
4. Conclusion
Wastewater-based analysis is rapidly becoming a useful platform for investigating the
epidemiology of viruses shed in human excretions (Farkas et al., 2018; Farkas et al., 2020;
Tambini et al., 1993). In this study, we analyse HTS data of wastewater-derived SARS-CoV-2
sequences to determine SNVs, putative circulating lineages and also population structure at a
spatial and temporal scale. Analysis of wastewater-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 10
states (Figure 2A) highlighted that the SNVs range from 24 to 793 SNVs for each sample with the
highest number in samples from Arizona. As expected, mean depth is correlated with the number
of SNVs detected in each sample (Figure 2B). Our major findings included the detection of a high
number of novel SNVs detected (548) in the 52 wastewater-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences
analysed here (Figure 3) that had not been identified in clinical samples previously to the last day
of our sampling (16th June 2020). Furthermore, 263 SARS-CoV-2 SNVs identified in wastewater
samples sampled during our collection period had not been identified in clinical-derived
sequences as of 20th November 2020 (Figure 3). It is likely that a large proportion of these SNVs
are in “actively circulating” viruses and could have some biological significance.
Through analysis of SNVs in the SARS-CoV-2 sequences in each wastewater sample, we were
able to identify putative Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak Lineages
(PANGOLIN) that are known to be circulating in the USA as well as several lineages that had not
been detected in North America up until 20th November 2020. For the samples from the states of
Arizona and Kentucky where we had undertaken temporal and spatial sampling, some
PANGOLIN that had been detected in SARS-CoV-2 clinical-sequence data were also supported
in the wastewater in addition to several other putative lineages which may have been missed by
clinical sampling (Figure 4). In conjunction with diversity analyses using distance matrices (Figure
5) this shows trends in viral populations which can help to track the spread of the SARS-CoV-2.
This study supports the use of wastewater sampling as a tool suitable for analysing the genomics
of ongoing outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as SARS-CoV-2. As demonstrated here, HTS
of RNA from wastewater can provide novel information on SNVs and lineages which, when

coupled with that derived from clinical data, can help identify new emerging variants/lineages of
clinical importance within a population. The study results indicating a shift in the SARS-CoV-2
sequence variation in wastewater from each location over time shows the ongoing need for such
approaches. As a collective, the approaches we have outlined in this study can be used within a
public health setting as an early warning tool to inform infectious disease mitigation measures.

Figure 3: Novel SARS-CoV-2 SNVs (i.e. not yet detected in clinical-derived samples as of 17th June 2020)
identified in the 52 wastewater samples analysed. On the y-axis are the number of samples containing the
SNV and on the x-axis is the relative position of SNV in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Positions with multiple
variants are marked in red and those marked with grey circles represent the SNVs that have been detected
up until 20th November 2020 in clinical samples.

Number of GISAID samples

Figure 4: Publicly available genomes from clinically derived data deposited in GISAID, grouped by PANGOLIN, whose mutations were consistent with those observed in wastewater samples. A. Heatmap showing
the number of days between sample collection and when supported lineages were first observed in clinical
data. Each wastewater sample (52 samples across 10 states) contained support for different clinical
samples which are grouped here by PANGOLIN, some of which have only been observed outside North
America (indicated as “global only”). B. Clinical genomes reported in USA states and territories which were
assigned to PANGOLIN supported by at least one environmental sample. Black borders indicate lineages
supported in environmental samples from the respective location.

samples. A. Distribution of sequences from samples collected in ten states (each represented by a different
colour) in the USA showing pairwise distance based on genomic composition between viral populations
present in each sample. B. Timeline representation (shown by the colour gradient) of samples taken from
the sample locations across ten USA states between April-June 2020 with pairwise distance based on
genomic composition between viral populations present in each sample. C. Spatial representation of
SARS-CoV-2 sequences from samples collected from various regions within Arizona (represented by
different symbols) comparative to those from other states. D. Sampling catchments in Tempe, Guadalupe
and Gilbert, Arizona.
