Summary
Genomic sequencing is crucial to understanding the epidemiology and evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Often, genomic
studies rely on remnant diagnostic material, typically nasopharyngeal swabs, as input into whole genome SARSCoV-2 next-generation sequencing pipelines. Saliva has proven to be a safe and stable specimen for the
detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via traditional diagnostic assays, however saliva is not commonly used for SARSCoV-2 sequencing. Using the ARTIC Network amplicon-generation approach with sequencing on the Oxford
Nanopore MinION, we demonstrate that sequencing SARS-CoV-2 from saliva produces genomes comparable
to those from nasopharyngeal swabs, and that RNA extraction is necessary to generate complete genomes from
saliva. In this study, we show that saliva is a useful specimen type for genomic studies of SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
Genomic studies of SARS-CoV-2 are critical to the collective understanding and control of the COVID-19
pandemic. Unbiased genomic sequencing identified a novel betacoronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in the
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of an individual with pneumonia in December, 20191. This first SARS-CoV-2
genome sequence paved the way for the design of numerous vaccines2, the development of diagnostic assays3,
and targeted sequencing approaches4. Since then, more than 2 million SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequence
genomes have been uploaded and shared on GISAID (gisaid.org) as of June 21, 2021. Open data sharing has
facilitated wide scale viral surveillance that has led to the identification of multiple variants of concern and shaped
both clinical and public health approaches to the treatment and control of COVID-195.
Workflows for whole-genome SARS-CoV-2 sequencing begin with sample collection, typically from discarded
clinical diagnostic specimens. While nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs are still considered as the ‘gold standard’ for
SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing, we have shown that saliva is a sensitive6,7 and stable8 sample type, which can
be reliably self-collected9, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-qPCR diagnostic assays in the absence
of RNA extraction10. As saliva is increasingly being used in diagnostic testing programs, we sought to determine
if saliva samples can be used to generate high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes.
In this study, we consider two common measures of genome quality: depth of coverage (i.e. the number of reads
aligning to the genome) and breadth of coverage (i.e. genome completeness). Intrinsic viral diversity, polymerase
errors, and sequencing artifacts introduce heterogeneity into sequencing data, making it difficult to determine
the consensus nucleotide identity with few reads. The ARTIC Network protocol only assigns a nucleotide identity
to positions with at least 20x coverage (i.e. 20 or more reads align to a given position in the genome) to increase
confidence in the consensus genome sequence. The completeness of a sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genome often
depends on the viral load and sample quality. Because SARS-CoV-2 RNA typically makes up a small proportion
of RNA in clinical diagnostic specimens, PCR amplification increases the amount of genomic material available
for sequencing. However, due to the highly multiplexed nature of the ARTIC Network PCR approach, where
more than a hundred individual primer sets are pooled in a single reaction, a slight imbalance in priming efficiency

can lead to unequal read distribution and result in incomplete genomes. Thus, genome completeness is rarely
100%, rather genomes that are 80-99% complete are considered high-quality for the purposes of this study.
We compared SARS-CoV-2 genome quality from i) saliva and NP swabs of varying viral concentrations from a
hospital cohort, ii) paired saliva and NP swab samples from the same individual, and iii) saliva samples with and
without RNA extraction. Our results show that saliva performs similarly to NP swabs using both random and
paired samples, genome coverage is strongly correlated with viral load and data quantity, and that performing
RNA extraction from saliva drastically improves genome completeness. These data demonstrate that highquality SARS-CoV-2 genomes can be readily sequenced from saliva samples.

Results
SARS-CoV-2 genome completeness is similar between NP swabs and saliva samples
To establish whether we could generate whole SARS-CoV-2 genomes from saliva, we used the ARTIC Network
amplicon generation approach to sequence SARS-CoV-2 RNA extracted from 172 nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs
and 60 saliva samples on the Oxford Nanopore MinION. We found that the cycle threshold (Ct) value for the N1
target according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR diagnostic
assay is associated with genome completeness for both NP swabs and saliva samples (Figure 1A). Specifically,
Ct values are inversely correlated with viral RNA quantity, and we could sequence more complete SARS-CoV2 genomes from samples with low Ct values, regardless of sample type. We generated high-quality genomes
from saliva samples with a wide range of Ct values. A Ct value of 30 is often used as a threshold by sequencing
labs, where samples with higher Ct values may not generate complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes11. Based on our
RT-qPCR standard curve, a Ct value of 30 corresponds to ~1,000 SARS-CoV-2 genome equivalents (GE) per
μL (Methods). Our data show that we could sequence the majority of samples with a Ct ≤30 to >80%
completeness (165/172, 95.9%) (Supplemental Table 1). However, we generated fewer genomes with >80%
completeness from saliva samples with a Ct ≤30 (35/41, 85.4%) compared to NP swabs (130/131, 99.2%).
As we require ≥20 aligned sequencing reads to call a base at any genome position, it is useful to assess lower
depths of coverage to determine if more complete genomes would be generated with more data. We evaluated
the discrepancy in SARS-CoV-2 genome completeness between sample types by calculating genome
completeness at various depths of coverage for the 6 saliva samples and 1 NP swab with a low Ct value (≤30)
and low genome completeness (<80%) (Figure 1B). For the 6 saliva samples at 10X, 5X, or 1X depth of
coverage, we found that sequencing reads were generated across the genome, suggesting that simply allocating
more sequencing space per sample would have resulted in more complete genomes. However, genome
completeness was only slightly improved at lower depths of coverage for the NP swab sample.
We sequenced all samples included in this study in a multiplexed fashion, with as many as 22 samples included
per run, and therefore the total amount of sequencing space given to each sample varies. As expected, we found
a direct relationship between the total number of reads per sample and the genome completeness (Figure 1C).
Of the 96 samples composed of > 200,000 reads, 94 (97.9%) exhibited high levels of genome completeness
(>80%). Therefore we suggest allocating at least 200,000 reads per sample, regardless of sample type, to
generate near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes using this sequencing approach.
Sequencing matched saliva and NP swab samples from the same individuals produce genomes of similar
completeness and relatedness
Next, we examined if saliva samples are directly comparable to NP swabs by sequencing matched samples
taken from the same individual at the same time point. We obtained matched samples from 12 individuals and
randomly downsampled the sequencing reads to match the sample with the least amount of data. We found no
substantial difference in genome completeness for different sample types collected from the same individual

(Figure 2A). For 5 individuals, saliva produced the more complete genome with normalized read counts
compared to 7 for NP swabs. Saliva samples have a mean genome completeness of 91.1% ± 0.04% compared
to NP samples at 92.0% ± 0.07%. Consistent with our previous results6, we found lower SARS-CoV-2 Ct values
from saliva compared to the matched NP swabs. We also compared the genetic relatedness of every matched
sample by constructing a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree. We found that 10 of the 12 pairs had identical
genomes, where in two pairs (04 and 09) the genome sequenced from the NP swab had an additional mutation
compared to the genome from saliva (Figure 2B). The mutations identified in the NP swab samples from pairs
04 and 09 are well supported with >400X depth of coverage at the sites. These mutations did not change the
lineage placement for the NP swab genomes from samples 04-NP and 09-NP, both clustering with the B.1
pangolin lineage.
RNA extraction improves completeness of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from saliva
The removal of the RNA extraction step for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test can streamline workflows and has been
demonstrated for multiple sample types, including saliva10,12,13. SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing workflows
would similarly benefit in the time and cost reductions by removing RNA extraction steps. We attempted to
sequence SARS-CoV-2 genomes from split saliva samples, where half of the sample underwent our normal RNA
extraction procedure and the other half was processed according to our SalivaDirect protocol with a proteinase
K and heat treatment instead of RNA extraction10. While the extraction-free SalivaDirect protocol yielded similar
SARS-CoV-2 Ct values to samples with RNA extraction, indicating similar levels of PCR detection, we found that
sequencing from the SalivaDirect substrate led to a substantially lower genome coverage of 7.8% ± 33.3%
compared to RNA extracted samples averaging 89.3% ± 29.0% completeness (Figure 3A). In fact, of the 11
samples processed using our SalivaDirect protocol, only 1 sequenced genome met our standards of 80%
completeness, while the majority produced genomes that were less than 50% complete. In comparison to the
counterpart sample that did undergo RNA extraction, we sequenced 9 out of 11 to >80% completeness, including
some samples with Ct values >30. We then investigated whether this observation could be attributed to
insufficient data by calculating the percentage completeness of each genome at various levels of depth of
coverage (Figure 3B). Our analysis showed that increasing data per sample would improve genome coverage
for only 4 of the samples processed with the extraction-free SalivaDirect protocol as evidenced by the large
separation between data points in Figure 3B. However, 8 of these samples had no reads aligning to >90% of
the genome, indicating that more data would not have substantially improved coverage, even at low Ct values.
Thus, without further protocol optimization, RNA extract from saliva samples is necessary for sequencing
complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes.
Discussion
In this study, we determined that SARS-CoV-2 genomes generated from saliva were of the same completeness
as those generated from NP swabs, the gold standard diagnostic specimen for COVID-19. By comparing a
random subset of samples from saliva and NP swabs spanning different viral titers (Figure 1A), we found little
difference between genome completeness from different sample types. Rather, viral titer (Ct values) and the
amount of sequencing data generated from each sample is more indicative of genome completeness than
specimen type (Figure 1B,C). Our results demonstrate that samples with a Ct value at or below 30, or ~1000
SARS-CoV-2 GE/ul, with greater than 200,000 reads should produce near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes
using using the ARTIC amplicon-based sequencing approach, in line with previously published data11. We
observed substantial variation in Ct values from matched saliva and NP samples (Figure 2A), however the
genome sequence itself was identical or nearly identical regardless of sample type (Figure 2B). When comparing
saliva samples that have undergone RNA extraction to identical saliva samples processed with our SalivaDirect
approach that excludes RNA extraction, we see a substantial drop in genome completeness (Figure 3A,B). This
result may be explained by the highly multiplexed nature of the amplicon generation step being less efficient
when RNA is not extracted and purified.

There are important considerations for the interpretation of these data. Our Ct value threshold of 30 is
conservative and should not be seen as a lower limit of detection. Ct values will vary based on RT-qPCR assays,
reagents, and thermocyclers, and we were able to sequence some near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes at Ct
values greater than 30. Similarly, individual laboratory validation is necessary to determine the amount of data
needed per sample if using protocols outside of the specific library preparation and sequencing approaches used
in this study. Modifications of the primer concentrations used in the ARTIC Network’s amplicon-based
sequencing approach have resulted in improved read distribution across the SARS-CoV-2 genome4. Our data
were generated prior to these modifications, thus we would expect substantially fewer reads per sample will be
needed to generate high-quality genomes. As well, data presented here was generated on the Oxford Nanopore
MinION where the entire ~400 b.p. amplicon is sequenced in a single read. Most library preparation approaches
used for Illumina sequencing platforms fragment amplicons for shorter library insert lengths, meaning more reads
will need to be generated per sample on short-read sequencing platforms.
In addition to these considerations, there are some limitations to our results. We did not assess how saliva
performs as a specimen for sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genomes outside of amplicon-based strategies and
additional research is needed to assess how saliva would perform in metagenomic or hybrid-/capture-based
sequencing approaches. Additionally, we did not quantify the effect RNA extraction has on generating complete
genomes from NP swabs. Therefore, we cannot determine if the reduction in genome completeness seen from
samples without RNA is a specimen type specific phenomenon.
Saliva is a stable and sensitive specimen type for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays. In addition to the safety
afforded through self-collection opposed to NP swabs, saliva is increasingly becoming an appealing specimen
type, in particular for large-scale public health surveillance. Taken together, our data indicate that saliva is a
satisfactory sample type for not only diagnostic assays but also for sequencing high-quality SARS-CoV-2
genomes. This is an important finding for the scalability and streamlining of genomic epidemiological studies.
Conclusions
The results of our study comparing the use of saliva to NP swabs for SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing indicate
that viral titers and data quantity influence genome completeness more than specimen type.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva were collected from enrolled COVID-19 inpatients and healthcare workers
from Yale-New Haven Hospital in accordance with the Yale University HIC-approved protocol #2000027690.
Samples were collected after the study participant had acknowledged that they had understood the study
protocol and signed the informed consent. All participant information and samples were collected in association
with non-individually identifiable study identifiers. These samples were used to create the Yale COVID-19
Biorepository.
METHOD DETAILS
Sample selection and RNA extraction
Samples were received as either purified RNA, original nasal swab in viral transport media, or original saliva
sample. NP swab, saliva, and RNA samples came from the Yale-New Haven Hospital in partnership with the
Yale Pathology Lab, Yale Clinical Virology Lab, and/or the Yale COVID-19 Biorepository. Nucleic acid was
extracted from original samples (300 μL) using the MagMAX viral/pathogen nucleic acid isolation kit (Thermo
Fisher) and eluted into 75 μL. Samples were screened for SARS-CoV-2 RNA via a multiplex RT-qPCR assay
using the NEB Luna universal probe 1-Step RT-qPCR kit with CDC N1, N2, and RP primer-probe sets on the
Bio-Rad CFX96 touch real-time PCR detection system14. PCR conditions were as follows: 55°C for 10 minutes,
95°C for 1 minute, 45 cycles of 95°C for 10 seconds followed by 55°C for 30 seconds. A standard curve of
synthetic RNA transcripts was used to convert Ct values to genome equivalents (GE) (available on
https://github.com/josephfauver/Saliva_Sequencing_Manuscript). Multiple extraction controls were included for
each RNA extraction batch and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by the same assay.
SalivaDirect
A detailed SalivaDirect protocol has been published15. Briefly, 50 μL of saliva is combined with 2.5 μL (50mg/mL)
Proteinase K (Thermo Fisher) and vortexed for 1 min at 3200 RPM. After 5 minutes of incubation at 95°C for 5

minutes, 5 μL of lysate was directly used as input in the RT-qPCR reaction with the same conditions as specific
for extracted RNA above. Samples were stored at -80°C before sequencing.
Oxford Nanopore library preparation and sequencing
RNA extracted from positive samples or processed SalivaDirect samples served as the inputs for an ampliconbased approach for sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT; Oxford, United Kingdom)
MinION16. Sequencing libraries were prepared using the ONT Ligation Sequencing Kit (SQK-LSK109) and the
ONT Native Barcoding Expansion pack as described in the ARTIC Network’s protocol with V3 primers (IDT) 17
with the following modifications: cDNA was generated with SuperScriptIV VILO Master Mix (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), all amplicons were generated using 35 cycles of amplification, amplicons were
then normalized to 15 ng for each sample, end repair incubation time was increased to 25 min followed by an
additional bead-based clean up, and all clean up steps used a ratio of 1:1 beads:sample. No-template controls
were introduced for each run at the cDNA synthesis and amplicon synthesis steps and were taken through the
entire library preparation and sequencing protocol to detect any cross-contamination. For each control in each
run, less than 1,000 total reads were observed. A subset of reads in control samples aligned to the SARS-CoV2 genome, although no position of the genome had greater than 20 reads i.e. enough data to influence the
generation of a consensus genome. 25 ng of the final library was loaded on a MinION R9.4.1 flow cell and
sequenced for approximately 8-10 hours.
Bioinformatics processing
The RAMPART application from the ARTIC Network was used to monitor approximate genome coverage for
each sample and control in real time during the sequencing run (github.com/artic-network/rampart). Fast5 files
were basecalled using the Guppy basecaller 4.4.0 fast model and consensus genomes were generated
according to the ARTIC bioinformatic pipeline (artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html)
which uses Nanopolish to call variants18. A threshold of 20x coverage was required to call a base pair in the
consensus genome. Regions of the genome with less than 20x coverage were designated with N’s in the
consensus genome.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Genome completeness was determined either by counting N’s in the consensus genome output by the ARTIC
pipeline for 20x coverage (Figure 1A and C) or by using the SAMtools19 depth feature for various coverage
thresholds (Figure 1B). At the 20x threshold, these two methods produced highly similar values with a slight
discrepancy.
Matched saliva and NP swab genomes were aligned with MAFFT20,21 and placed in a phylogenetic tree using a
maximum-likelihood approach (PHYML) to show similarity between matched samples22. Some manual curation
was necessary to correct for misalignment over ambiguous regions of the genome. Lineage assignments were
conducted using pangolin (v.3.1.3)23
