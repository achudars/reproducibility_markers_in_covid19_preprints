ABSTRACT:
Background: Despite wide utilisation of severity scoring systems for case-mix determination
and benchmarking in the intensive care unit, the possibility of scoring bias across ethnicities
has not been examined. Recent guidelines on the use of illness severity scores to inform
triage decisions for allocation of scarce resources such as mechanical ventilation during the
current COVID-19 pandemic warrant examination for possible bias in these models. We
investigated the performance of three severity scoring systems (APACHE IVa, OASIS,
SOFA) across ethnic groups in two large ICU databases in order to identify possible
ethnicity-based bias.
Method: Data from the eICU Collaborative Research Database and the Medical Information
Mart for Intensive Care were analysed for score performance in Asians, African Americans,

Hispanics and Whites after appropriate exclusions. Discrimination and calibration were
determined for all three scoring systems in all four groups.
Findings: While measurements of discrimination - area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUROC) - were significantly different among the groups, they did not
display any discernible systematic patterns of bias. In contrast, measurements of calibration standardised mortality ratio (SMR) - indicated persistent, and in some cases significant,
patterns of difference between Hispanics and African Americans versus Asians and Whites.
The differences between African Americans and Whites were consistently statistically
significant. While calibrations were imperfect for all groups, the scores consistently
demonstrated a pattern of over-predicting mortality for African Americans and Hispanics.
Interpretation: The systematic differences in calibration across ethnic groups suggest that
illness severity scores reflect bias in their predictions of mortality.

Introduction:
Severity scoring systems are employed in the intensive care unit (ICU) to perform severity
adjustment for the purposes of benchmarking and research.1 It has generally been assumed
that these systems are fair and objective in terms of their use across different ethnic groups.
However, while it is known that such models may perform differently among disparate
geographic populations or between different centres, 2 the assumption of scoring neutrality
among ethnic groups within a given population has not been closely examined.

Disparities in ICU outcomes may result from pre-admission clinical factors, socioeconomic
determinants, the quality of ICU care, and cultural practices.3, 4 Another possible source of
disparity emanates from the use of biased algorithms.5, 6, 7, 8 The current COVID-19 pandemic
raises two intersecting issues that demand a closer evaluation. First, relatively higher
mortalities have been observed in particular ethnic populations, specifically African
Americans.9 Second, severity scores have been proposed by professional societies and
various policy groups to be incorporated into triage systems for potential scarce resource
allocation.10, 11 It is therefore imperative to determine whether biased scoring systems could
be adding to existent baseline disparities in healthcare.
The latest model of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation scoring system,
APACHE IVa, was developed using data from 104 intensive care units in 45 USA based
hospitals utilising 142 patient variables. The model employs the worst values in the first
‘APACHE day’ of the patient’s ICU stay to generate a risk score for hospital and ICU
mortality and length of stay.12 The Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS) was
developed from 81,087 admissions from 86 ICUs in the USA, utilising 10 variables collected
in the first 24 hours of ICU stay.13 The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score
was developed based on expert opinion, incorporating organ function scores from six organ
systems to characterize severity state in sepsis but has been repurposed to predict patient
outcomes.14
In this retrospective observational study, we examined the performance of three severity
scoring prediction models, namely APACHE IVa, OASIS, and SOFA in two large, publicly
available ICU databases (eICU-Collaborative Research Database and Medical Information
Mart for Intensive Care-III).

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
Evidence before this study:
We searched PubMed on September 4, 2020 with no filter restrictions using the terms
‘intensive care unit severity scoring systems’ and ‘bias’ and ‘racial bias’ and found no
results. These systems are used in critical care medicine for severity adjustment for
research purposes and for benchmarking intensive care unit (ICU) performance. Ethnicity
is generally documented in the process of hospital admission. However, none of the
currently employed ICU severity scoring systems incorporate ethnicity or other relevant
socioeconomic factors as a parameter in their analysis. We chose to examine three of these
systems (APACHE IVa, OASIS, SOFA) for possible ethnically based bias. Out of these
three, SOFA has come to be potentially employed (in guidelines) for initial ICU triage
purposes and to determine the continuation of mechanical ventilation in situations of
limited resources during a pandemic.
Added value of this study:
We analysed the performance of three different clinical prediction models across four
ethnicities in two large publicly available critical care databases involving 122, 919 and
43,823 admissions respectively. We found evidence that all three models over-predict
mortality in all ethnic groups. While this general phenomenon of model drift is already
known, we show that the over-prediction is more marked in African American and
Hispanics, who are traditionally associated with poor socioeconomic status compared with
Whites and Asians in the United States. This was consistent in both the databases for all
the prediction models tested.
In view of the aforementioned use of one of the scoring systems (SOFA) in the current
pandemic for purposes of triage of potentially limited resources and the disparate clinical
outcomes of certain ethnic groups, we concluded that it is particularly important to
ascertain whether severity scoring systems might contain previously undetected elements
of bias which would make them inappropriate to utilize for clinical decision-making.
Implications of all the available evidence:
Triaging of critical care resources is being discussed widely in the context of the current
pandemic. In order to bring objectivity to the decision making, clinical prediction scores
have been proposed to form part of the triage process. Sequential Organ Failure and
Assessment (SOFA) is the most commonly proposed model in this context. We would
maintain that we demonstrated sufficient evidence of bias in terms of the predicted versus
observed mortalities (model calibration) that such use should be approached with extreme
caution, and it may be most prudent to avoid applying these prediction models to critical
care triage across populations involving patients from different socioeconomic and ethnic
background.

Methods
The eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD)
This eICU-CRD was derived from the eICU telehealth system.15 This system was designed to
complement on-site ICU teams with remote support. The data include over 200,000
discharged patient episodes across 335 ICUs at 208 hospitals during the period of 2014-2015.
Patient demographics including age, sex, ethnicity , vital signs, diagnoses, laboratory
measurements, clinical history, problem lists, APACHE IVa scores and treatments are
available in the database.

MIMIC-III database
MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) is a publicly available database
consisting of over 60,000 ICU admissions to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre
(BIDMC) between 2001 and 2012. 16 MIMIC-III incorporates OASIS as a mortality
prediction model.

Admission SOFA scores were computed in both databases. Mortality in all ethnic groups
were calculated at multiple SOFA cut-offs, with SOFA score categories of 0-7, 8-11 and >11.
The categories are based on what have been proposed for COVID-19 ventilator allocation. 10

The Federal guidance in the USA classifies race into five categories, and ethnicities into two
categories.17 For this paper, we defined “ethnicity” based on the entries made in the
demographic sections of the respective databases. The ethnicities included in the analyses
were African American, Asian, Hispanic and White. Native Americans were excluded due to
the much smaller sample size compared to the other ethnicities (n=946 (0.7%) in eICU and

n=57 (0.11%) in MIMIC). Patient episodes with a nonspecific or unknown ethnicity category
were excluded.

Patients with missing survival data or erroneous/missing prediction scores, missing ethnicity
data and those <16 years or >90 years of age were excluded from the analyses.

Ethnicity information was available in both the databases. It is typically entered by an
administrator who asks the patient or the family member which ethnic group they identify
with, or obtained from previously available records.

Tests of discrimination
Discrimination was determined by the Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic
(AUROC) curve for different ethnic groups. Hospital mortality was the outcome of interest.
SOFA score was analysed in both databases, while APACHE IVa and OASIS were used as
predictors in the eICU-CRD and MIMIC-III databases respectively.

Tests of calibration
Calibration was evaluated using standardised mortality ratio (SMR) for APACHE IVa and
OASIS. Since predicted mortality for a given SOFA score for an individual patient cannot be
calculated, SMR could not be specifically calculated for SOFA. Instead, observed mortality
for each ethnic group was compared to the mortality rate in the overall population in that
SOFA score category in order to provide an evaluation of comparative outcomes among
ethnic groups.
To further characterise model performance in the context of sicker patient populations, an
additional calibration analysis was performed across risk grades of 0-5%, >5-10%, >10-20%,

>20-50% and >50%, based on APACHE IVa and OASIS in eICU and MIMIC-III patients
respectively. (Supplementary appendix)
The statistical analyses were performed in R v4.0.0. The packages used included: rsq (partial
R2) – v2.0; ems (SMR) - v1.3.2; dplyr (data handling and summarising) – 1.0.0 and pRoc.
Stata version 14 was used for comparison of AUROC between groups using the Roccomp
function.

Ethical approval
Research using the eICU-CRD is exempt from institutional review board (IRB) approval due
to the retrospective design, lack of direct patient intervention, and the security schema, for
which the re-identification risk was certified as meeting safe harbour standards by an
independent privacy expert (Privacert, Cambridge, MA) (Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act Certification no. 1031219-2). The data in MIMIC-III has been previously
de-identified, and the IRBs of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (No. 0403000206)
and BIDMC (2001-P-001699/14) both approved the use of the database for research.

Results
The distribution and characteristics of patients in different ethnic groups are shown in Table
1. As shown in Figure 1, the following patients were excluded: missing/unknown ethnicity,
ethnicity outside the 4 being examined, those outside the 16-89 age range and those without a
valid model predicted mortality (required for SMR calculation). The total numbers of ICU
admissions included in the final analysis were 122,919 (83.8% of all episodes) and 43,823
(71.2% of all episodes) in the eICU-CRD and MIMIC-III respectively.

African Americans and Hispanics were younger than patients of other ethnicities. Mean
prediction scores were similar across the groups. Predicted hospital mortalities across
ethnicities were in the 11%-12% range in the eICU-CRD and 11%-14% in MIMIC-III, while

observed mortalities were 8%-9% in the eICU-CRD and 7%-13% in MIMIC-III, indicating
that both models over-estimated hospital mortality.
Discrimination
Tests for discrimination showed that the APACHE IVa model performed well across all
ethnic groups in the eICU-CRD, with the AUROC, for the Hispanic, African American,
Asian and White groups being 0·89, 0·87, 0·86 and 0·86, respectively (See Table 2 and
Figure 2). Across group differences in the AUROC were statistically significant (p=0·016).
The AUROCs in MIMIC-III in the Hispanic, African American, White and Asian groups
were 0·76, 0·75, 0·76 and 0·77, respectively, displaying insignificant across group
differences (p=0·85).

Calibration
The observed/predicted death rates in the eICU-CRD were 442/608, 1219/1813, 8732/11456,
and 169/220 in the Hispanic, African American, White, and Asian groups, respectively.
Therefore, across all groups, APACHE IVa predicted more deaths than were actually
observed, with SMRs of 0·73, 0·67, 0·76, and 0·77 in the same group order (Table 3). This
over-prediction of mortality was also observed in MIMIC-III, with the SMR values of
Hispanics, African Americans, Whites and Asians being 0·64, 0·67, 0·81 and 0·95
respectively. As can be seen in Table 3 and Figure 4, the APACHE IVa model was least
accurate for predicting hospital mortality in African Americans (SMR 0·67) and most
accurate in Asians (SMR 0.77). OASIS was least accurate in Hispanics and African
Americans (SMRs of 0·64 and 0·67 respectively), and most accurate in Asians (SMR 0·95).
Forest plots of the SMR data are displayed in Figure 4. While all the differences do not quite
reach statistical significance, there do appear to be two distinct groupings consisting of
Hispanic/African American patients, and Asian/White patients, with the former displaying
significantly worse calibration than the latter. The difference in calibration between the
African American/Hispanic groups and the White/Asian groups is significant in MIMIC-III.

In all the ethnic groups, SMR was higher and generally closer to 1 with increasing predicted
risk categories, signifying that APACHE IVa and OASIS are better calibrated across all
ethnicities in sicker patient populations. (See the supplementary appendix).

Figure 4:
Top panel: Forest plot for SMRs for different ethnic groups from the eICU for mortality predicted by APACHE
IVa. There is a clear separation between White and African American groups. However, all other groups have
overlapping 95% confidence intervals, with a lower SMR point estimate for Hispanics, compared to Whites and
Asians. Bottom panel: Forest plot for SMRs for different ethnic groups from the MIMIC-III for predicted
mortality determined by OASIS. There is clear separation of CIs between the African American/Hispanic and
White/Asian groups. Hispanic and African American SMRs again are lower than Asian and White.

Performance of SOFA in the eICU-CRD and the MIMIC-III
Discrimination in both the databases was comparable across ethnicities, with the exception of
Asians in the eICU-CRD where the AUROC was considerably lower (See Figure 5). For the

SMRs could not be calculated to determine calibrations for SOFA. However, using the
approach we described, we observed the same phenomenon of a lower observed mortality for
a given risk score category in African Americans (and less so for Hispanics), compared with
Whites and Asians across many of the score categories (Table 4 and Table 5). SOFA
mortalities were also notably different between the databases for the same scoring category
within a given ethnic group.

Discussion:
In this first comparative study of ICU mortality prediction model performance in different
ethnicities, we show that while there was a statistically significant difference across the
AUROCs, there was no systematic pattern to the difference in the discriminative
performances of APACHE IVa, SOFA, and OASIS. However, with regard to calibration,
OASIS, APACHE IVa, and SOFA over-predicted mortality in all ethnic groups. This poor
calibration was particularly notable in the African American and Hispanic groups. There was

a statistically significant difference between the SMRs of Whites and African Americans for
both APACHE IVa and OASIS, and a statistically significant difference between Whites and
Hispanics for OASIS. Asians were statistically different from African Americans and
Hispanics in OASIS only. (Figure 4)
Although not designed for mortality prediction, SOFA performed reasonably well in terms of
discrimination with the exception of the somewhat aberrant AUROC in the Asian group in
eICU-CRD. The relative mortality risks in Hispanics and African Americans were notably
different (lower) in the two databases for low to moderately high SOFA scores. This must be
taken into consideration when SOFA is employed for prognostication and triage decisions in
the ICU.
Importantly, while it is reassuring that all scores were better calibrated in the sicker
population, it is of concern that in mild to moderate risk categories, including mid-range
SOFA scores, calibration is poor in the ethnic groups who are usually associated with poor
socioeconomic backgrounds. While calibrations were less disparate at the highest score levels
(indicating very poor prognoses) of >11, the mortality ratio for African Americans was still
>10% lower than that of Whites and Asians in the ICU database at this level.
These findings have potential repercussions for some of the guidelines on the appropriation
of limited ICU resources during the pandemic. It has been proposed, for example, that for a
persistent SOFA score of 8-11 after 48 or 120 hours, treatment continuation should be
evaluated. 10, 11 If SOFA does indeed over-predict mortality in that score range, then this form
of decision making could be misguided. The same guidelines from New York and Michigan
have used a level of 12 as a potential cut-off for admission or continued ICU care. The
critical question raised by this study is why the African American and Hispanic groups
demonstrated such inaccurately high mortality predictions. In this context, the most

concerning potential scenario would be withholding of treatment or withdrawal of care on the
basis of a perhaps falsely high predicted mortality.

Precise calibration is particularly important if these systems are to be used for care decisions
in individual patients. Triage decisions related to patient admission, management (including
discontinuation of treatment), and discharge from the ICU are potentially subjective and
vulnerable to bias. Scoring systems may be applied to these decisions in order to, in theory,
introduce a greater level of objectivity and fairness when resources are critically limited.
However, if the systems themselves are biased, then their use for these purposes will
systemically imprint and effectively endorse existing inequities. Another important point is
the utilisation of prediction models based on a single time point, as this may not always
capture an individual patient’s potential to respond to a proposed treatment. However, in realworld decision making, especially in a resource constraint scenario, all the clinician or a
triage official has is a snapshot type of risk prediction tool.
While a temporal drift in model performance may explain low SMRs in all the ethnic groups,
it is not clear why these scoring systems produce ethnically consistent patterns of poor
calibration. Based on recent papers, it is unlikely that African American and Hispanic
patients received relatively better care. 18, 19 It is also doubtful that an identical physiological
phenotype represents a different disease trajectory in those groups. An implicit assumption of
scoring systems is that patients have the same baseline states and that the scores represent the
same degree of deviation from that baseline state. However, African Americans and
Hispanics admitted to an ICU with the same severity scores as Whites and Asians, may
actually be exhibiting a smaller change from their baseline status. For example, a population
with a higher prevalence of chronic organ failure (e.g. baseline elevations in serum creatinine
or bilirubin) could demonstrate SOFA scores that do not accurately portray their acute
physiological status. Deliberato et al. demonstrated that patients with obesity, which may

well be higher in the African American and Hispanic populations,20 may be similarly
misclassified with regard to illness severity based on absolute physiologic measurements on
ICU admission given a more abnormal baseline state compared to patients with a lower body
mass index.21 In the same vein, it has been shown that the chronic disease burden may
contribute more towards mortality in critically ill.22 Given that the Hispanics and AfricanAmericans were younger than the other two ethnic groups in both the databases, it is possible
that they had a low chronic disease burden, resulting in a lower contribution of chronic
disease towards mortality risk for the similar acute physiological profile.
In a perfect world without bias and health disparities, only patient and disease factors would
determine case-mix and clinical outcomes in the ICU. However, studies have repeatedly
demonstrated that this is far from the case.18, 19 Our detection of inadvertent but undeniable
bias in severity scores would seem to indicate that it is time to develop scoring systems that
are more precise than the current ‘one size fits all’ systems. This will admittedly pose a
challenge, but one that is achievable as more data accumulate for varying patient cohorts and
contexts. In response to this need, there is a movement across the critical care community to
make mortality risk prediction models more dynamic and useful in real time, often based on
data collected from electronic health records.23, 24, 22, 25, 26, 27 Notably, around 70% of the
patients were White in the training and validation datasets for APACHE and OASIS models.
More diverse ethnic representation of patients during model development will help reduce
potential bias. Attention must also be paid to relevant sociodemographic factors while
developing the models. Especially, with the potential resource limitations arising in the
COVID-19 pandemic, the wide use of biased risk prediction models is undoubtedly
problematic.28 Access to care, including life-saving treatments, is the strongest predictor for,
and a potential root cause of, poor health outcomes.29 Evidence also exists that health
outcomes differ significantly within an ethnic group depending on income and education.30, 31

To add to the complexity surrounding this issue, there persists a debate whether race is a
social or a biological concept.32 In fact, there are greater genetic differences between
individuals of the same ethnic group than there are differences across ethnic groups.
Furthermore, because socioeconomic factors may be distributed disproportionately, it has
been recommended that both ethnicity and socioeconomic parameters are included in health
reporting.30, 33 A mere race adjustment may further the disparity in care.34
In addition to their use for triage purposes, these scoring systems are used for severity
adjustment in research and for benchmarking performance. Our findings will need to be taken
under consideration for these purposes, as well. For example, an ICU with a largely African
American population would appear to be performing better than a unit of largely White
patients on the basis of model mortality overpredictions for the African Americans . For
research, populations thought to be of equal severity, may not be quite so. These are
important considerations that will need to be addressed, but not of the urgency of the
potential bias of systems employed for triage purposes. Another important point is that given
that MIMIC-III and eICU capture a wide variety of ICUs in the U.S., these data should be
potentially generalisable to most western settings where triaging of critical care resources on
the basis of risk prediction tools have been discussed. However, a local assessment of model
performances in different ethnic group in different settings is needed.
There are a number of limitations of our study. First, there was elimination of patients with
missing ethnic data from the analysis. Missing data is unfortunately an integral part of realworld clinical data analysis, and although extremely unlikely to be due to systematic bias, it
is not possible to ascertain what resulted in the absence of the ethnic data in those patients.
Second, the ascertainment of ethnicity was done at individual hospitals and was largely based
on self-reporting. Third, the attribution of certain score components (e.g. Glasgow Coma
Scale) could be somewhat subjective. However, this issue is an inherent nature of ICU risk

scoring and would be a factor in any study of similar nature. Fourth, the ethnic group
category for Asians is very heterogeneous including Indian-Asians, Filipino-Asians, ChineseAsians and others. There may be significant differences to the performance of the scoring
systems in these sub-groups that would be lost after aggregation.
In conclusion, we found that the APACHE IVa, SOFA, and OASIS predictive models
performed discrimination in a manner that was technically but not systematically different
between ethnic groups. However, all of these prediction models significantly and
systematically overestimate mortality across all ethnic groups. Importantly, this poor level of
calibration was most notable in Hispanic and African American patients and was found in all
three scoring systems. In a world with health disparities whose healthcare providers’ triage
decisions may be tainted with bias, current severity scoring prediction models may not be
able to correctly and fairly characterize patient severity and risk. Incorporating precise
socioeconomic and geographic parameters along with a set of specific biomarkers for a given
disease into future prediction models may potentially make such models less biased and
therefore, more robust. Extreme care must be taken in the application of current scoring
systems for triage decisions in individual patients, if they are, in their present states, to be
used at all for these purposes.

Supplementary appendix
Summary of the three prediction scores in the study:
APACHE IVa
•

Critical care mortality prediction model, predicts hospital mortality of the critically ill

•

The model was developed using multivariate logistic regression.

•

The model was built and tested in 104 ICUs in 45 U.S. based hospitals

•

For a patient, a percentage probability of hospital mortality can be generated.

•

Was developed based on 142 variables (including 116 admission categories and 17 acute
physiological parameters), worst values in the first ICU day hours are taken for the acute
physiology component

•

Acute physiology contributes towards 65.9% of the score and age, chronic health
condition, underlying diagnosis, ventilation status

•

Currently often the clinical data is pulled from electronic health record automatically to
generate the score. In some units, it can be done by the nurses.

•

In can also predict ICU mortality

OASIS
•

Critical care mortality prediction model, predicts hospital mortality and ICU mortality of
the critically ill patients

•

A machine learning technique called particle swarm optimization was used to develop the
model.

•

This was developed in 86 ICUs in 49 hospitals

•

The model uses 10 patient parameters (heart rate, mean arterial pressure, temperature,
respiratory rate, urine output, pre-ICU admission length of stay, GCS, age, being placed on
a mechanical ventilator at any point during day 1 and admission following elective
surgery.)

•

Worst values on the first ICU days are taken

•

A score is converted by logit to generate a probability of mortality

SOFA
•

SOFA or Sequential Organ Failure and Assessment was built by expert consensus

•

This was initially built for sepsis patients, but later on used for wider critical illnesses.

•

SOFA can be calculated at admission and also thereafter daily with worst values for each
day.

•

This is not build on a statistical model and cannot assign a specific mortality probability for
a given score

•

Six different organ system (cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic, renal, coagulation and
neurological) are evaluated

•

Each system can be assigned a score between 1 and 4 depending on the relevant parameters

•

It is widely used in clinical care and also in clinical trial settings

Additional discussion on risk categories of APACHE IVa and OASIS
Table S1 shows the trend of increasing SMR with increasing predicted mortality risk. This was the same in all
ethnic groups, as shown in Figures S1 and S2. In the lower risk categories, SMR was markedly low in certain
groups. For example, SMR was 0·47 in Hispanics in MIMIC-III within the 10-20% risk category. This pattern
was the same in other risk strata in the eICU data as well (e.g. African Americans and Hispanics had SMRs of
0·49 and 0·31 respectively in the eICU data’s 0-5% risk category). An exception to this trend of improving
SMR with increasing predicted risk was African Americans in MIMIC-III, where no such improvement was
seen and the patients within this group had persistently low SMRs (<0·7) in all risk categories.
