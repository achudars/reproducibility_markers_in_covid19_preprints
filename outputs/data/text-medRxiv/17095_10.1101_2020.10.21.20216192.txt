Abstract
Severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is linked to the presence of autoantibodies against multiple targets, including
phospholipids and type-I interferons. We recently identified activation of an autoimmune-prone B cell response
pathway as correlate of severe COVID-19, raising the possibility of de novo autoreactive antibody production
during the antiviral response. Here, we identify autoreactive antibodies as a common feature of severe COVID19, identifying biomarkers of tolerance breaks that may indicate subsets of patients that may particularly
benefit from immunomodulation.

Main text
The contribution of B cell responses to severe COVID-19 infection through the generation of pathogenic
autoantibodies remains to be demonstrated. Yet, such a mechanism is strongly supported by recent
descriptions of autoantibodies against phospholipids1, type-I interferons2, and other targets3. Our group and
others have recently described a correlation between severe infection and intense extra-follicular (EF), B cell
responses bearing cellular, repertoire, and serological features reminiscent of SLE pathogenic auto-reactivity 46

. Together, these observations raised the possibility that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection frequently results in

breaks of self-tolerance to a variety of autoantigens.

To explore this possibility, we retrospectively collected data from 31 critically ill patients with COVID-19 and no
known history of autoimmunity undergoing treatment between June 1st and July 2nd, 2020 in two academic
intensive care units in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. All patients fell into the NIH COVID-19 “Severe” or “Critical”
categories with an average CRP level of 191ug/mL (Table 1).

Patients were tested for a variety of broad serologies commonly used for the initial evaluation of autoimmune
rheumatic diseases (Table 1). Consistent with tolerance breakdown, 44% of patients had positive levels of
ANA at ≥ 1:80, the entry threshold value for SLE classification7 in a predominantly speckled pattern (50%) (Fig
1a). Of positive tests, 81% displayed titers of ≥1:160, a titer present in <5% of the normal population, with the
higher titers ranging from 1:320-1:640(Fig 1a). Anti-RNP and anti-centromere IgG titers were detected in 2 of
22 ANA+ patients, while dsDNA reactivity was not readily detected (Fig 1a). Reactivity against rheumatoid

factor (10/52), phospholipids (3/52), prothrombin (2/52), and c-ANCA (2/52), with or without ANA reactivity,
suggests broad autoimmune targeting (Fig 1a). Indeed, 59% of ANA+ patients displayed at least one other
positive auto-reactive antibody test emphasizing the potential for multiple tolerance breaks across the cohort
(Table 1, Figure 1a).

The presence of autoreactivity could be clearly correlated with increasing serum levels of CRP (Figure 1a). We
have previously described the correlation of serum CRP with the activation of SLE-like B cell responses
although those findings stopped short of documenting clinical autoreactivity. In this cohort, we identify
increased production of both ANAs (35% vs. 56%, respectively) and RF (0% vs. 38%) in patients with higher
CRP levels (Figure 1b), with >70% of patients in the CRP-high group showing ANA or RF production,
confirming autoreactivity as a common feature of severe disease. Of importance, all patients displaying
additional autoreactivities tested positive for either ANAs, or RF, suggesting that these two clinical tests may
be valuable in efficiently screening patients for broad tolerance breaks.

Longitudinal data was available for 7 patients within the cohort at 2-week follow-up. Out of 4+ baseline ANA
titers, 2 increased to as high as 1:2560, one remained at 1:360, and a lower 1:80 became negative. Of note,
substantial or increasing ANA titers occurred despite declining serum CRP levels (Figure 1c).

Effector B cell responses can proceed either through germinal center reactions or extrafollicular (EF)
responses. In both cases, autoreactivity is likely to be generated through activation of autoreactive cells
present at high frequency in the pre-antigenic naïve repertoire. While GC reactions frequently generate
additional autoreactivity through somatic hypermutation, they are also endowed with multiple checkpoints to
prevent their progression to pathogenic effector responses. In contrast, EF reactions are characterized by
direct antibody production and may not be able to negatively regulate autoreactive B cell responses 8. Human
EF responses have been best defined in SLE, where they may be induced through TLR7 by single-stranded
RNA sensing, and correlate with disease severity9.

Our findings invite two interpretations. Either patients with undocumented and pre-existing autoimmunity
comprise the majority of the critical illness within our Atlanta-based cohort, or more likely, the immunological
environment of serious COVID-19 infection, including TLR7 activation by SARS-CoV2 ssRNA, is sufficient to
drive de novo autoreactivity against a variety of self-antigens. The latter possibility has been documented in the
setting of other serious infections10, and is now mechanistically supported through independent validation of
autoimmune-prone EF response activation in serious disease6. These findings may be consequential for the
identification of patients in whom immunomodulation may be beneficial and suggest the value of autoreactivity
measurements for proper segmentation and allocation of properly targeted therapies. They further suggest
that simple clinical testing for ANAs or RF may be able to distinguish those groups. Longitudinal study of
recovered patients will be critical in understanding the persistence of this autoreactive state, it’s role in the
increasingly documented cases of ‘lingering’ COVID-1911, and it’s propensity for conversion into self-sustaining
autoimmunity in order to devise early rheumatological intervention strategies and establish effective long-term
care protocols.
