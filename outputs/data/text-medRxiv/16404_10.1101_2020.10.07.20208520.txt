Abstract
In a large cohort of ambulatory confirmed COVID-19 patients with multiple self-collected sample
time points, we compared 202 matched nasal-oropharyngeal swabs and oral salivary fluid
sample pairs by RT-PCR. Nasal-oropharyngeal swabs were more sensitive than this salivary
sample type (oral crevicular fluid) suggesting that not all saliva sample types have equivalent
sensitivity. However, all samples that were Vero E6-TMPRSS2 cell culture positive (e.g.,
infectious virus) were also oral fluid RT-PCR positive suggesting that oral fluid may find the
patients most likely to transmit disease to others.

Background: There is an urgent need to improve COVID-19 diagnostics that rely on collection
of nasopharyngeal specimens by health care personnel using special swabs. Salivary specimen
sampling circumvents the swab supply chain bottlenecks, can be easily self-collected even by
children, and is less likely to create aerosols during collection. In a hospitalized cohort of
matched nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and saliva specimens, saliva specimens had a significantly
higher mean log copies per milliliter of SARS-CoV-2 RNA than NP swab specimens.(1)
Objective: We sought to determine how salivary specimens would perform if self-collected in a
cohort of ambulatory COVID-19 adults.
Methods and Findings: We compared SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results in 202 matched selfcollected mid-turbinate nasal-oropharyngeal (OP) swabs and oral crevicular fluid collected by 67
non-hospitalized, consenting COVID-19 adults >18 years. (Figure 1) Among the samples that
were concurrently positive, nasal-OP swab sample RNA measures were significantly higher
(lower cycle thresholds) than oral fluid values, median 15.98 (IQR 13.96-21.21) vs 21.81 (IQR
17.35-25.27) (p-value<0.001). Of the matched samples for which at least one sample was
positive, only 11.6% of samples (14/121) had higher viral burdens measured in oral fluid
compared to nasal-OP swab samples. Midway through enrolment, participants were asked to
add spit from the back of the mouth and throat into the Oracol collection tube to evaluate if that
might enhance sensitivity. Oral fluid samples supplemented with spit remained statistically less
sensitive for viral RNA detection than nasal-OP samples (p-value <0.001). Interestingly, of the
52 pre-spit samples, 4 (7.7%) had lower Ct values than nasal-OP, and, in the post-spit samples,
this percentage increased to 14.5% (10 of the 69 samples). Oral fluid samples that were
obtained earlier in the course of infection (<5 days) were more likely to be positive. We cultured
all RT-PCR positive nasal-OP specimens on VeroE6 TMPRSS2 cells. All culture positive
samples were obtained within 11 days of symptom onset. In all matched samples in which
SARS-CoV-2 was cultured, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in both nasal-OP and oral fluid
samples.
Discussion
Our data underscore the limitations of salivary testing for SARS-CoV-2 and challenge of
COVID-19 diagnostics. In contrast to the study of Wyllie et al., we generally detected less
SARS-CoV-2 RNA in oral fluid compared to nasal-OP specimens in our outpatient cohort.
Others also have reported testing discordance including lower sensitivity in saliva compared to
NP samples.(2) Differences in salivary collection processes might explain the findings. Wyllie
et al. collected expectorated samples in the morning, a process that might increase viral

abundance by enrichment of deeper samples, especially in hospitalized patients with
pneumonia.(3) In the present study, samples were self-collected in an ambulatory setting using
a device that was optimized for detection of oral crevicular fluid antibodies.
Oral fluid, useful for the detection of antibodies, may dilute the salivary sample and decrease its
sensitivity for viral RNA detection. Many in vitro devices that are currently being tested for the
direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 are proposing saliva including passive drool, spit, oral fluid, and
sputum from clearing the throat. Not all salivary samples may be equivalent in terms of
diagnostic utility and more data are needed to inform device manufacturers. Differences in the
stage of infection may also factor since limited data suggest salivary tests have higher
sensitivity in the first week of symptoms.(1, 4) The timing of collection, time after onset of
symptoms, hospitalized vs outpatient populations, and the volume of saliva/spit may all be
important for optimizing sensitivity of the saliva sample. In vitro device manufacturers will need
to consider these factors when considering what sample types to test and when assessing
assay performance.
However, our data and others consistently demonstrate the potential pragmatic use of salivary
testing.(5) There was a high rate of acceptability for self-collection of oral fluid in an ambulatory
setting. In addition, we and others have found that salivary sampling was 100% successful in
detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA from persons with detectable infectious virus, the widely accepted
correlate of transmissibility. Thus, even if there are small reductions in analytical sensitivity, for
the public health objective of identification of persons who might transmit SARS-CoV-2, home
collection of salivary/oral fluid samples is an important advance that might be added to other
measures like rapid testing of antigen (vs RNA) to enhance the effectiveness and scale of
COVID-19 diagnostics.
