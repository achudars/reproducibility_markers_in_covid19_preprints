SUMMARY
SARS-CoV-2 infection is typically very mild and often asymptomatic in children. A
complication is the rare Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated
with COVID-19, presenting 4-6 weeks after infection as high fever, organ dysfunction and
strongly elevated markers of inflammation. The pathogenesis is unclear but has overlapping
features with Kawasaki disease suggestive of vasculitis and a likely autoimmune etiology.
We apply systems-level analyses of blood immune cells, cytokines and autoantibodies in
healthy children, children with Kawasaki disease enrolled prior to COVID-19, children
infected with SARS-CoV-2 and children presenting with MIS-C. We find that the
inflammatory response in MIS-C differs from the cytokine storm of severe acute COVID-19,
shares several features with Kawasaki disease, but also differs from this condition with
respect to T-cell subsets, IL-17A and biomarkers associated with arterial damage. Finally,
autoantibody profiling suggests multiple autoantibodies that could be involved in the
pathogenesis of MIS-C.
HIGHLIGHTS
Hyperinflammation in MIS-C differs from that of acute COVID-19
T-cell subsets discriminate Kawasaki disease patients from MIS-C
IL-17A drives Kawasaki, but not MIS-C hyperinflammation.
Global autoantibodies profiling indicate possibly pathogenic autoantibodies

adults infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Lu et al., 2020). Reasons for this have not been
established, but several theories have been discussed, involving immune system
differences such as thymic function, cross-reactive immunity to common cold coronaviruses,
as well as differences in the expression of the viral entry receptor ACE2, as well as a better
overall health status among children as compared to the elderly (Brodin, 2020). The mild
COVID-19 in children has been confirmed also in areas with high disease prevalence such
as northern Italy (Parri et al., 2020). The view that COVID-19 disease course is always mild
in children is now challenged by recent reports of children presenting with a rare, but very
severe hyperinflammatory syndrome in the United Kingdom (Riphagen et al., 2020;
Whittaker et al., 2020), Italy (Verdoni et al., 2020), Spain (Moraleda et al., 2020) and New
York City (Cheung et al., 2020). In these case series, children present with high fevers, and
a variable number of symptoms previously associated with Kawasaki disease such as
conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, mucocutaneous rash and coronary artery dilation and in
the most severe cases cardiovascular shock, encephalitis and multiple organ failure.
Kawasaki disease is a vasculitis affecting medium sized arteries with highest incidence in
children younger than 5 years old and it is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in

developed countries where streptococcal infections are commonly treated, and rheumatic
fever is rare (Shulman and Rowley, 2015). Kawasaki disease has a particularly high
incidence in children with East Asian ancestry and was first described in Japan. The
dominating theory for the pathophysiology of Kawasaki disease involves the production of
self-reactive antibodies during an acute immune response to a viral infection, probably at
mucosal surfaces and focused around IgA-producing plasma cells. Such cells have also
been found within the arterial wall in specimens from children with Kawasaki disease
(Rowley et al., 2008). Neutrophils infiltrate the arterial wall and a necrotizing arteritis
develops leading to the destruction of the connective tissue and arterial dilation in severe
cases (Shulman and Rowley, 2015). Efforts to define the pathogenesis of Kawasaki have
also revealed an imbalance of IL-17-producing T-cells and regulatory T-cells during the
acute phase of this disease (Jia et al., 2010).
Given the severity of the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in children (MIS-C)
associated with COVID-19, and the uncertain development of the ongoing pandemic, there
is an urgent need to understand the pathogenesis of MIS-C, its similarities and differences
with Kawasaki disease, such that optimal treatment strategies can be devised. Here we
have performed a systems-level analysis of immune cells, cytokines and antibodies in the
blood of children presenting with MIS-C as compared to children with mild SARS-CoV-2
infection, children with Kawasaki disease and healthy children enrolled prior to the COVID19 pandemic (Figure 1). We reveal several details of the hyperinflammatory state in children
with MIS-C, contrasting with both the hyperinflammation seen in adults with acute SARSCoV-2 infection, as well as that of children with Kawasaki disease. We define key cytokine
mediators, assess serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses and we identify
putative autoantibody targets possibly involved in the pathogenesis of this new disease.
RESULTS
Children with SARS-CoV-2, MIS-C and Kawasaki disease
We enrolled 41 children with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in Rome, Italy, all with mild
disease, and we denote these as CoV2+ children throughout this manuscript (Table 1). We
also enrolled three children presenting with MIS-C in Rome and 10 children presenting with
MIS-C in Stockholm, Sweden. We compare these CoV2+ and MIS-C children with 28
children presenting with Kawasaki disease prior to the COVID-19 pandemic from March
2017 to May 2019. The children with MIS-C were significantly older than children with

Kawasaki disease (Table 1), in line with previous reports (Whittaker et al., 2020). No
significant sex-differences were found among the groups of children. Both MIS-C and
CoV2+ children presented with lower white blood cell counts (WBC) as compared to patients
with Kawasaki disease and healthy children (Table 1). Lymphopenia is a hallmark of COVID19 and was more pronounced in MIS-C than in children with mild SARS-CoV-2 infection,
and also more pronounced than in children with Kawasaki disease (Table 1). MIS-C patients
also had markedly higher CRP and ferritin levels and lower platelet counts as compared to
both Kawasaki disease and CoV2+ children (Table 1). These observations are in line with
recent clinical reports (Whittaker et al., 2020), suggesting that our cohort is representative
of patients with MIS-C, Kawasaki disease and children with mild SARS-CoV-2-infection.

Hyperinflammation during MIS-C differs from that of severe, acute COVID-19
In adults and the elderly, the main cause of severe COVID-19 disease and death is
uncontrolled immune activation, hyperinflammation and immunopathology (Vardhana and
Wolchok, 2020). This life-threatening response requires urgent management and the

immunological aspects of this process is under intense investigation (Kuri-Cervantes et al.,
2020; Mathew et al., 2020; Rodriguez et al., 2020). A number of clinical trials are ongoing
to test immunomodulatory strategies that can calm the cytokine storm in severe COVID-19.
Since MIS-C is also a hyperinflammatory condition associated with COVID-19, but with a
delayed presentation, we wondered whether this hyperinflammatory state is similar to that
seen in adults with severe COVID-19 disease and whether similar immunomodulatory
strategies should be considered in both conditions. We measured 180 plasma proteins
involved in immune response and inflammation in serum samples from children with mild
MIS-C and Kawasaki disease and compared these to the cytokine profiles recently reported
in adults with severe acute COVID-19 and hyperinflammation (Rodriguez et al., 2020). After
filtering out proteins with >30% measurements below the threshold of detection, we
performed principal component analysis (PCA) including 120 unique proteins (Figure 2A,
Supplementary Table 1). Adults with acute COVID-19, both patients in the Intensive Care
Unit (ICU) and floor (non-ICU), but all severely ill, had very different cytokine profiles from
those seen in children with either MIS-C or Kawasaki disease (Figure 2A). The main
contributing features explaining this difference included IL-8 (Figure 2B), a chemokine
recently shown to be associated with lymphopenia in severe COVID-19 cases (Zhang et al.,
2020). IL-7 was also higher in acute COVID-19 hyperinflammation than in MIS-C and
Kawasaki disease, IL-7 is a cytokine involved in T-cell maintenance and associated with
lymphocyte counts (Figure 2B). The MIS-C and Kawasaki hyperinflammatory states
partially overlapped and both differed from adults with acute COVID-19 hyperinflammation
(Figure 2A).
Differences in T-cell subsets in MIS-C and Kawasaki disease
To better understand the hyperinflammation in MIS-C and Kawasaki disease we assessed
peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) phenotypes by flow cytometry. Samples were
collected at hospital admission, prior to treatment and reflect cellular states during the
hyperinflammatory immune response. We found differences in the distributions of
subpopulations of CD4+ T-cells as defined by the expression of CD45RO and CD27, and
the frequency of T-follicular helper cells (TFH) expressing the chemokine receptor CXCR5 (

). Total T-cell frequencies were lower in both types of hyperinflammatory patients, MIS-C
and Kawasaki disease as compared to healthy children (Figure 3A). Within the CD4+ T-cell
compartment, MIS-C patients and children with mild SARS-CoV-2+ infection had similar
subset distributions, indicating that differences seen in relation to healthy children could be
related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection itself (Figure 3C-E). Both SARS-CoV-2 experienced
groups of patients had higher abundances of central memory (CM) and effector memory
(EM) CD4+ T-cells, but fewer naïve CD4+ T-cells as compared to Kawasaki disease patients
(Figure 3C-E). Follicular helper T-cells, important players in germinal center reactions and
supporters of B-cell responses were reduced in SARS-CoV-2 experienced children, both
with and without MIS-C, but not in Kawasaki disease patients (Figure 3F). CD57 marks
terminally differentiated effector CD4+ T-cells and these have been shown to be reduced in
adult patients with severe acute COVID-19 and acute respiratory distress syndrome (Anft et
al., 2020). In children with mild COVID-19 and children with MIS-C we find higher levels of
these terminally differentiated cells when comparing to Kawasaki disease patients and
healthy children (Figure 3G). We find that CD4- T-cells (mostly CD8+ T-cells) were
significantly lower in MIS-C children as compared to children with mild SARS-CoV-2
infection (Supplementary Figure 1A-D). These results further emphasize that the
hyperinflammation seen in acute, severe COVID-19 in adults, differs from that seen in MIS-

C and also indicates some specific differences between immune cell responses in MIS-C
and patients with Kawasaki disease occurring prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Unraveling the cytokine storm in MIS-C and Kawasaki disease
To further investigate the hyperinflammatory immune states in MIS-C and Kawasaki disease
patients, we performed Olink assays on plasma samples from 11 children with MIS-C and
28 children with Kawasaki disease. We measured 180 unique proteins using two Olink
panels (Key Resource Table) and filtered out proteins with >30% measurements below the
threshold of detection, resulting in 125 plasma proteins used for PCA (Figure 4A,
Supplementary Table 2).

We find that healthy children and children infected with SARS-CoV-2, without MIS-C, mostly
overlapped, illustrating the mild infection and low-grade inflammatory response in these
CoV2+ children (Figure 4A). As shown by the blown up PC2 vs. 3 plot, MIS-C
hyperinflammatory states differ from that of Kawasaki disease (Figure 4A). PC2 best

discriminated these hyperinflammatory states in MIS-C and Kawasaki disease and we
focused on the contributing features (loadings) of PC2 (Figure 4B). We find that elevated
IL-6, IL-17A, CXCL10 contributed the most to the cytokine storm (Figure 4C). IL-17A is
important in Kawasaki disease (Jia et al., 2010), but was significantly lower in MIS-C
patients, indicating a difference in the underlying immunopathology (Figure 4C). In contrast,
the top negative contributors were adenosine deaminase (ADA), stem cell factor (SCF) and
TWEAK, a negative regulator of IFNg and Th1-type immune response (Maecker et al.,
2005). As a regulator of angiogenesis, TWEAK is also an interesting finding given the
vasculitis component of Kawasaki disease and probably also MIS-C (Figure 4D).
We also identified additional plasma proteins distinguishing MIS-C from Kawasaki. Apart
from IL-17A, DCBLD2, also called ESDN, was more elevated in Kawasaki disease than MISC. This protein has been shown to be secreted by endothelial cells attacked by allogeneic
immune cells after heart transplantation (Sadeghi et al., 2007) and in balloon dilated carotid
arteries (Kobuke et al., 2001) suggestive of more pronounced arterial damage in Kawasaki
than in MIS-C. Collectively, these findings indicate more arterial involvement in Kawasaki
than MIS-C, and also a IL-17A driven cytokine storm in Kawasaki disease but not in MIS-C.
IL-17-blocking agents are used in psoriasis and other diseases and could be of interest for
future clinincal trials also in these patients. Moreover, other key proteins differing among
these groups is MMP-1 and MMP-10 (Supplementary Figure 2A), proteins involved in
arterial disease (Martinez-Aguilar et al., 2015), which is intriguing given the likely arterial
inflammation component of both MIS-C and Kawasaki disease.
MIS-C immune profiles intersect mild COVID-19 and Kawasaki disease and change
upon immunomodulation
To understand the interaction among different immune system components and their
coregulation, we applied Multiomics Factor Analysis (MOFA) (Argelaguet et al., 2019) to
integrate T-cell subset frequencies and plasma protein concentrations from MIS-C patients,
Cov2+ children and children with Kawasaki disease. We identified 10 latent factors that
explain the combined variance across cell and protein datasets (Supplementary Figure
1D-E). The first factor separated Kawasaki disease samples from both groups of SARSCoV-2 infected children (MIS-C and CoV2+) (Supplementary Figure 1F). Conversely,
factor 5 discriminated the extremes of Kawasaki vs. mild SARS-CoV-2+ infections and
placed MIS-C samples in between these polar opposites (Supplementary Figure 1G-H),

indicating that the immunopathology in MIS-C shares features with both acute SARS-CoV2 infection and the postinfectious response associated with Kawasaki disease.
MIS-C patients are treated with strong immunomodulatory agents. The treatment regimens
for the 13 MIS-C patients in our cohor are shown in Figure 5A. Most patients were treated
by high dose steroids in combinations with intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) to override
the effect of autoantibodies and stimulate inhibitory Fc-receptors (Figure 5A). A number of
children were also given recombinant IL1RA (Anakinra) to block IL-1a/b mediated
inflammation (Figure 5A). We assessed the cytokine changes upon treatment and found
that TNFB, ITGA11 and CCL25 levels decreased, while HEXIM1, PSP1 and CXCL10 levels
increased in response to treatment in the seven MIS-C patients with available pre/post
samples (Figure 5B-C). These results indicate that there is a particular cytokine profile
associated with MIS-C, that differs from Kawasaki disease hyperinflammation and that
changes in response to immunomodulatory treatment.
Serologic responses and pre-existing humoral immunity in MIS-C
Given that immunopathology of Kawasaki disease and possibly also MIS-C involving
autoantibodies, we decided to test IgG responses to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in these
patients. We measured IgG binding of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the Spike
protein from SARS-CoV-2. We found that the majority of children in our cohort testing
positive for infection by PCR also seroconverted (Figure 6A). We also found that 3 out of 4
tested MIS-C patients seroconverted and had comparable levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG
antibodies to the spike protein as the children with mild SARS-CoV-2 infection and no MISC (Figure 6A). This result is in line with data from other groups studying antibody responses
in MIS-C patients (Gruber et al., 2020; Rostad et al., 2020). A possible hypothesis for why
some children develop MIS-C is that prior immunity to other viruses could modulate their
responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and give rise to hyperinflammation either by antibodymediated enhancement or other mechanisms (Tetro, 2020). To assess this, we applied
VirScan, a phage display method for testing IgG binding of 93,904 epitopes from 206
different viruses able to infect human cells (Xu et al., 2015). We found that the children in
our cohort had IgG antibodies to common viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
and rhinovirus as well as viruses of the herpesvirus family (Figure 6B). This is in line with
our previous results (Pou et al., 2019). The common cold coronaviruses are particularly
interesting as possible modulators of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 given their

similarities. We focused on IgG antibodies to these viruses in MIS-C, CoV2+, Healthy and
Kawasaki-disease children. We found that IgG antibodies to human coronavirus HKU1 was
commonly observed, as were antibodies to betacoronavirus 1, but the MIS-C patients were
the only ones lacking antibodies to either of these common coronaviruses (Figure 6C). The
relevance of this difference remains to be determined; this could either reflect the fact that
the MIS-C patients are older than the other groups of children analyzed, but it is also
possible that the lack of IgG antibodies to common coronaviruses modulates the immune
response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and plays a role in the pathogensis of MIS-C.

Proteome array profiling reveals potentially pathogenic autoantibodies in MIS-C
Several studies have proposed autoantibodies as an element of the immunopathology of
Kawasaki disease (Sakurai, 2019). An external trigger, likely in the form of a virus is
indicated by epidemics of Kawasaki disease, and direct evidence of antiviral antibody
responses, particularly targeting viral particles in inclusion bodies in the respiratory
epithelium have been reported (Rowley et al., 2008). Autoantibodies targeting endothelial
cells can activate

IL-6 production by endothelial cells in vitro (GRUNEBAUM et al., 2002), but a possible role
of autoantibodies in MIS-C is currently unknown. To search for such autoantibodies in MISC, we screened serum samples from children with MIS-C (n=12), Kawasaki disease (n=28),
SARS-CoV-2+ infection (n=5) and healthy control children (n=11) against 9341 human
protein antigens from 7669 unique proteins using protein arrays (Zhu et al., 2001)

(ProtoArray v5.1, PAH05251020, ThermoFisher, Waltham, Mass). As expected, the
autoantibody signals were low for the vast majority of antigenic targets (Landegren et al.,
2016) (Figure 7A). We ranked autoantibody targets using fold-change calculations between
the MIS-C group and each of the other groups of samples, and looked for enriched Gene
Ontology (GO)-terms among the targets using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
(Subramanian et al., 2005). There were 26 GO-terms that were enriched in MIS-C samples
when compared to all other groups (Figure 7B), and these involved lymphocyte activation
processes, phosphorylation signaling pathways and heart development (Figure 7C). The
latter was interesting given that myocarditis and impaired cardiac function are hallmarks of
MIS-C clinical presentation. We studied individual autoantibody targets within this GO-term
(Figure 7D), and identified Endoglin, a glycoprotein expressed by endothelial cells and
necessary for structural integrity of arteries to be differentially regulated among groups of
samples (Figure 7E). Previous reports have found that when Endoglin is disrupted it causes
the disease Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, a disease characterized by
multisystemic vascular dysplasia (McAllister et al., 1994). Several, but not all of the MIS-C
patients had elevated levels of autoantibodies targeting Endoglin higher than levels in
healthy controls and a subset of Kawasaki disease patients also had autoantibodies to
Endoglin (Figure 7E). Endoglin protein expression is seen predominantly in the vascular
endothelium with the heart muscle having the highest mRNA expression of all tissues (Uhlen
et al., 2015). Among immune cells, mainly monocytes express Endoglin (Uhlen et al., 2019).
We also measured plasma levels of Endoglin, but in contrast to our expectation, the levels
where elevated in Kawasaki and MIS-C as compared to healthy children, possibly indicating
that autoantibodies to Endoglin are not the cause of tissue damage, but rather a
consequence thereof (Figure 7F). Nevertheless, it is interesting to investigate a possible
role for this protein, and antibodies targeting it, in the context of MIS-C and Kawasaki
disease pathogensis.
Among the enriched GO-terms, the majority involve signal transduction and in particular
signals mediated by phospho-tyrosine and -serine intermediates. GO: 0018100105 is one
such term with strong overrepresentation among MIS-C samples over children with mild
SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 8A). We found several possible autoantibodies in MIS-Cpatients not seen in other samples such as antibodies to MAP2K2, and antibodies to three
members of the Casein kinase family (Figure 8B). The latter is interesting in the context of
SARS-CoV-2 infection because a global analysis of phosphorylation landscapes in cells

infected by this virus showed strong upregulation of Casein-kinase 2 activity, and potent
antiviral activity of its inhibitor drug silmitasertib (Bouhaddou et al., 2020). If this signaling
cascade is important during viral infection, autoantibodies to intermediates of this pathway
could be pathogenic downstream and give rise to MIS-C. These protein targets are also
broadly expressed across tissues, which is in line with the diffuse clinical presentation in
patients with MIS-C.
Although there are overlapping features in the clinical presentation among MIS-C and
Kawasaki disease patients, there are also clear differences. Kawasaki disease involves
inflammation of medium sized arteries such as the coronary arteries, while MIS-C patients
have more diffuse presentation involving the intestine, myocardium and brain. Also, we
found that Kawasaki disease patients have higher levels of biomarkers associated with
arterial damage and inflammation as compared to MIS-C patients. To understand possible
differences in autoantibody profiles among these two conditions we focused on the
autoantibodies most different between Kawasaki disease and MIS-C patients. Although
there were a number of differentially regulated targets, EDIL3 autoantibodies were
particularly abundant in Kawasaki disease patients but not in MIS-C (Figure 8C). This gene
has previously been associated with Kawasaki disease (Jiang et al., 2017), and encodes a
structural glycoprotein in the arterial vessel wall that is regulated by vascular injury. EDIL3
serves to inhibit inflammatory cell recruitment to the endothelium and when disrupted there
is increased neutrophil recruitment to the tissue and elevated inflammatory responses (Choi
et al., 2008). Collectively our results different cytokine profiles in Kawasaki disease and MISC, more biomarkers of arterial inflammation and damage in Kawasaki and a possible focus
on autoantibodies to the Casein kinase system intermediates in MIS-C, a system strongly
induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. All these potential targets need to be validated in larger
sets of MIS-C patients and more mechanistic experiments.

DISCUSSION
The SARS-CoV-2 virus infects children at a similar rate as adults (Jones et al., 2020), but
fortuitously the disease COVID-19 is very mild in the overwhelming majority of infected
children (Brodin, 2020). Despite the mild COVID-19 in children, recent reports of severe
hyperinflammatory disorders developing 1-2 months after the acute infection with SARSCoV-2 are cause for much concern. This Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children
associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C) also called Pediatric multisystem inflammatory
syndrome, temporally associated with COVID-19 (PIMS-TS) have now been reported in

more than 100 children worldwide and the numbers are increasing (Cheung et al., 2020;
Moraleda et al., 2020; Riphagen et al., 2020; Verdoni et al., 2020; Whittaker et al., 2020).
Here we have combined high-dimensional analysis methods to uncover multiple aspects of
the hyperinflammatory response in children with MIS-C. We find similarities with the immune
response in Kawasaki disease, but also important differences, such as the IL-17A mediated
hyperinflammation in Kawasaki disease, but not MIS-C. In addition, differences in T-cell
subsets and cytokine mediators place MIS-C at the intersection of Kawasaki disease and
acute SARS-CoV-2 infection immune states in children as well as the hyperinflammation
seen in adults with severe COVID-19. We also find higher levels of biomarkers associated
with arteritis and coronary artery disease in Kawasaki disease than in MIS-C suggesting a
more diffuse endothelial involvement and immunopathology in MIS-C than in Kawasaki
disease. Finally, we perform global autoantibody screening and find binding of
autoantibodies to proteins involved in particular in immune cell signaling, structural proteins
in heart and blood vessels. These data suggest possible targets of autoimmune attack. The
hypothesis that autoantibodies contribute to the pathology in MIS-C is supported by the
efficacy of intravenous immunoglobulin in MIS-C, a common approach to activate inhibitory
Fc-receptors and prevent membrane-attack complexes by complement factors and thereby
mitigating autoantibody-mediated pathology (Mackay et al., 2001).
Our results of lymphocyte subsets with lower naïve CD4+ T-cell, TFH and increases in central
and effector memory subpopulations in MIS-C as compared to Kawasaki disease patients
could be partially explained by differences in patient age as immune cell proportions change
with age even in healthy children (Olin et al., 2018; Schatorjé et al., 2012). We did however
see these cell population differences remained even when comparing against additional
older healthy controls, comparable in age to the MIS-C patients. Also, several studies have
indicated defective T-cell responses as a central aspect of severe COVID-19 disease in
adult patients (Vardhana and Wolchok, 2020). We find expanded CD57+ CD4+ T cells often
representing immunosenescent and dysregulated T cells in both MIS-C and SARS-CoV-2+
children with mild infections, suggesting that this might be a direct consequence of the
SARS-CoV-2 infection and a similarity between MIS-C and acute COVID-19. Additional
studies in mild and especially asymptomatic COVID-19 cases are required to investigate
this further.

Treatments of MIS-C have mostly followed protocols used in atypical Kawasaki disease
given the overlapping presentation between these patients and children with MIS-C. The
data presented here present a more complex picture with both shared features and clear
differences that could influence strategies for treating these conditions. Kawasaki, but not
MIS-C has a strong IL-17A upregulation and future clinical trials in severe Kawasaki disease
patients treated with IL-17A blocking agents such as Secukinumab (Hueber et al., 2010)
could be considered. In contrast the children in this study with MIS-C were treated with a
combination of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), corticosteroids and recombinant IL-1receptor antagonist, IL-1RA (Anakinra). The profiles of seven cytokines significantly
changed before and after treatment in patients with paired samples (Figure 5B-C). IVIG can
neutralize some of the immunopathological effects of autoantibodies, while corticosteroids
provide general immunosuppression and IL-1RA neutralizes the strong IL-1 response likely

elicited by endothelial cells and innate immune cells recruited to the site of tissue injury.
Other treatment strategies reported by others include TNFa blockade (Infliximab) (Whittaker
et al., 2020), but compared to adults with acute COVID-19, TNFa levels are lower in MIS-C
(Figure 2) and also when comparing TNFa-levels in MIS-C to that of healthy children we
find no elevated levels (Supplementary Figure 2B), suggesting that TNFa-blockade will
not be useful to mitigate MIS-C. Also, IL-6 blockade is a candidate treatment strategy
already used in acute COVID-19 but we find highly variable IL-6 levels in MIS-C with 2/3
patients having normal IL-6 levels even during acute hyperinflammation (Figure 4C). We
therefore suspect that blocking IL-6 might not be universally effective in MIS-C patients.
Overall the data presented here suggest novel directions for future work towards more
mechanistic understanding of the immunopathology in MIS-C and development of novel
immunomodulatory therapies that can mitigate the effects of hyperinflammatory disease in
children during the COVID-19 pandemic.

coronary abnormalities (including ECHO findings or elevated Troponin/NT-proBNP), iv)
evidence of coagulopathy (by PT, PTT, elevated d-Dimers), v) acute gastrointestinal
problems (diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain); AND elevated markers of inflammation
such as ESR, C-reactive protein, or procalcitonin; AND no other obvious microbial cause of
inflammation, including bacterial sepsis, staphylococcal or streptococcal shock syndromes;
AND evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (RT-PCR or serology positive), or likely exposure
to COVID-19 patient. With regards to the MIS-C only 3 out of 4 patients were analyzed for
deep immunology studies since one patient died due to cardiac complications after surgery
during the study duration. Twenty-eight children diagnosed with Kawasaki disease were
enrolled during their acute phase of the disease at the Academic Department of Pediatrics,
Division of Immune and Infectious Diseases at Bambino Gesù Children’s Hospital (OPBG)
between September 2017 and June 2019, well before the COVID-19 pandemic hit Europe.
KD diagnosis was made according to the 2017 criteria of the American Heart association,
including both the complete and incomplete types. Fever onset was considered as the first
day of the acute KD phase. Twelve healthy controls (HC) were recruited at OPBG.
Demographic and clinical data of all the patients are summarized in Table 1. Swedish
patients are included in accordance with the Ethical permit Agency (Study ID: 2020-01911).
Italian children are included within the study protocol approved by the OPBG Ethics
Committees and informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians of all patients.
Autoantibody analyses in APS-1 patients were approved by Ethical board of Stockholm
(Permit: 2016/2553-31/2).
Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection
All patients enrolled in the CACTUS study with nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid using reverse-transcriptase qualitative PCR assay were
considered confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, all serum samples of
COVID19+ were investigated for presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. IgG antibodies were
quantitatively tested by LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG test (Diasorin).
Serum protein profiling and analyses
Serum proteins were analyzed using a multiplex technology based upon proximity-extension
assays (Lundberg et al., 2011). We measured 180 unique proteins using the Olink panels
of Immune Response and Inflammation (Key Resource Table). Briefly, each kit consisted
of a microtiter plate for measuring 92 protein biomarkers in all 88 samples and each well

contained 96 pairs of DNA-labeled antibody probes. To minimize inter- and intra-run
variation, the data were normalized using both an internal control (extension control) and an
inter-plate control, and then transformed using a pre-determined correction factor. The preprocessed data were provided in the arbitrary unit Normalized Protein Expression (NPX) on
a log2 scale and where a high NPX represents high protein concentration.
Plasma protein analyses in Figure 2 were performed using samples from children with
MIS-C (n=13), children with Kawasaki (n=28), adult CoV2+ non-ICU (n=7 subjects, 14 time
points total), and adult CoV2+ ICU (n=10 subjects, 43 time points total). In order to
compare Adult CoV2+ cases with Kawasaki and MIS-C children, bridge normalization was
used due to available bridge samples between assays regarding children. Bridge
normalization was done with the function olink_normalization(). A 30% LOD cutoff was
used to filter out proteins for all Olink plates. Then both plates were filtered for matching
proteins across. The normalized combined plate with children cases as well as the plate
containing the Adult CoV2+ cases were scaled within each set to unit variance (z-score)
before merging. For the PCA and PC contribution plots, both were done using the library
factoextra and only the top 20 contributions were displayed in the contribution plot.
Plasma protein analyses in Figure 4 were performed using samples from healthy children
(n=12), children with SARS-CoV-2 without hyperinflammation (n=41), children with MIS-C
(n=21, pre-treatment n=11, post-treatment n=7), and children with Kawasaki (n=28). The
four proteins (IL10, IL6, CCL11, IL5) that overlapped between Olink Immune Response and
Inflammation panels were averaged. Proteins with >30% measurements below the threshold
of detection were filtered out, resulting in 120 and 133 plasma proteins used for PCA in
Figures 2 and 4 respectively. Because Olink data from Figure 4 was run in two batches,
bridge normalization was applied using function olink_normalization from R package
OlinkAnalyze, followed by batch correction using the function removeBatchEffect from R
package limma. The analyzed Olink parameters for Figures 2 and 4, and their mean NPX
and standard deviations are provided (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). For analyses in
Figure 5, seven paired pre/post treatment MIS-C samples were compared.
VirScan
We investigated and compared antiviral antibody repertoires (IgG) of MIS-C, Cov2+,
Kawasaki and healthy children with VirScan, a viral epitope scanning method that relies on

bacteriophage display and immunoprecipitation. Briefly, VirScan uses a library of
bacteriophages presenting 56-amino-acid-long linear peptides that overlap by 28 amino
acids to collectively encompass the entire genomes of 1,276 viral strains from 206 viral
species known to infect human cells. After virus inactivation and normalisation to total IgG
concentration, plasma samples were incubated with the phage library to form IgG-phage
immunocomplexes, later captured by magnetic beads. Collected bacteriophages were
lysed and sequenced to identify the IgG-targeted epitopes. VirScore is the output given by
VirScan and corresponds to the number of peptide hits that do not share epitopes, and it is
incremented by 1 when a hit is enriched in the ‘output’ compared with the ‘input’.
Background noise is usually observed in bacteriophage display assays. In order to
minimise false-positive hits, VirScan removes hits occurring as a consequence of
unspecific binding to beads only (blank reactions without antibodies). Moreover, it also
removes cross-reactive antibodies by ignoring hits that share a subsequence of at least
seven amino acids with any other enriched hit found in the same sample.
Virscan data analysis
For each sample, sequencing reads were first mapped to the original library sequences with
Bowtie, and the number of reads of each peptide in the original library were counted with
SAMtools. A zero-inflated generalised Poisson distribution was applied to fit the frequency
of peptides, and −l og10(P ) was calculated for each peptide as the probability of enrichment.
Peptides with −l og10(P ) larger than 2.3 in both technical replicates were considered to be
significantly enriched. Among the significantly enriched peptides, those appear in at least 3
of the beads samples were removed as nonspecific bindings. We also filtered out the
peptides that were enriched in only one sample. The remaining enriched peptides were used
to calculate the virus scores. To remove the hits caused by cross-reactive antibodies, we
first sorted the virus by their total number of enriched peptides in descending order. For each
virus in this order, we iterated through all the enriched peptides and removed those that
shared a sequence of more than 7 amino acids with any previously observed peptides in
any virus of the same sample. The remaining enriched peptides were considered specific
and their number is the virus score for the virus. Afterwards, we filtered out the outlier viruses
with Virus Scores >1 in only sample and negative Virus Scores in all others. We also filtered
out viruses with Virus Scores < 2 in all samples.

Serum endoglin levels (CD105) were determined using manufacturer’s instruction (Key
Resource Table). Briefly, samples were heat inactivated (56 C for 30 min) and ~50mL was
used for ELISA-based quantification of Endoglin levels. Samples with out-of-range values
were diluted and measured again
Autoantibody profiling and analyses
We performed autoantibody profiling on samples from healthy children (n=11), children with
CoV2+ (n=5), children with MIS-C (n=12) and children with Kawasaki (n=28) in two batches.
Serum autoantibody reactivity was studied using full-length human protein arrays
(ProtoArray v5.1, PAH05251020, ThermoFisher) (Zhu et al., 2001). Protein arrays were
probed with serum at a dilution of 1:2000, and otherwise followed the protocol provided by
the manufacturer for immune response biomarker profiling. Protein arrays were first
incubated with blocking buffer (PA055, Life Technologies) for 1 hour, followed by 90 min
incubation with serum at 1:2000 dilution, and 90 min incubation with detection antibodies:
Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-human IgG antibody (A21445, ThermoFisher) at 1:2000 dilution
and Dylight 550 goat anti-GST (#DY550011-13-001, Cayman Chemicals) at 1:10,000
dilution. The LuxScan HT24 (BioCapital) microarray scanner was used. All analyses of
autoantibody reactivities were performed using background-subtracted mean signal values
of protein duplicates of the human IgG channel. Samples were quantile-normalized, and
technical duplicates were averaged. For comparisons of autoantibody target reactivity
between MIS-C and other groups (healthy control, CoV2+ and Kawasaki), differential
expression was run using deseq function of the R package Deseq2. Ranked lists were
obtained for each comparison to MIS-C (contrasts), and used for GSEA. GSEA was run on
the ranked list of unique targets using the gseGO() function of the clusterProfiler R package.
Flow Cytometry analysis of T cell subsets
Blood samples from KD and SARS-CoV-2+ patients were collected at the time of diagnosis
and with regards to KD, always before Intravenous immunoglobulin administration. After
ficoll, PBMCs and plasma samples were stored in liquid nitrogen or at -20°C, respectively,
in Nunc Cryotubes (Merk KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Flow cytometry was performed for
30 patients, and isolated PBMCs were stained with LIVE/DEAD™ Fixable Near-IR Dead
Cell Stain Kit (for 633 or 635 nm excitation, ThermoFisher, Waltham, Massachusetts, US)
for 15 minutes at 4°C. Then, the cells were washed in wash buffer (phosphate-buffer saline
with 1% bovine serum albumin) and stained for 30 minutes at 4°C with anti-hCD3 PE-CF594,
