ABSTRACT

Background: Laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (the cause of COVID-19) uses
PCR to detect viral RNA (vRNA) in respiratory samples. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been
detected in other sample types, but there is limited understanding of the clinical or laboratory
significance of its detection in blood.
Methods: We undertook a systematic literature review to assimilate the evidence for the
frequency of vRNA in blood, and to identify associated clinical characteristics. We performed
RT-PCR in serum samples from a UK clinical cohort of acute and convalescent COVID-19
cases (n=212), together with convalescent plasma samples collected by NHS Blood and
Transplant (NHSBT) (n=111 additional samples). To determine whether PCR-positive blood
samples could pose an infection risk, we attempted virus isolation from a subset of RNApositive samples.
Results: We identified 28 relevant studies, reporting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 0-76% of blood
samples; pooled estimate 10% (95%CI 5-18%). Among serum samples from our clinical
cohort, 27/212 (12.7%) had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by RT-PCR. RNA detection
occurred in samples up to day 20 post symptom onset, and was associated with more
severe disease (multivariable odds ratio 7.5). Across all samples collected ≥28 days post
symptom onset, 0/143 (0%, 95%CI 0.0-2.5%) had vRNA detected. Among our PCR-positive
samples, cycle threshold (ct) values were high (range 33.5-44.8), suggesting low vRNA copy
numbers. PCR-positive sera inoculated into cell culture did not produce any cytopathic effect
or yield an increase in detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Conclusions: vRNA was detectable at low viral loads in a minority of serum samples
collected in acute infection, but was not associated with infectious SARS-CoV-2 (within the
limitations of the assays used). This work helps to inform biosafety precautions for handling
blood products from patients with current or previous COVID-19.

BACKGROUND
Since January 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a global pandemic of COVID-19,
challenging hospitals and laboratory services worldwide [1]. Diagnosis of infection has
largely been based on RT-PCR amplification of viral nucleic acid from the upper respiratory
tract (nose/throat) swabs [2]. However, detection of viral RNA (vRNA) has also been
reported in blood, serum and plasma from clinical small case series (e.g. [3,4]). The
frequency and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood fractions, and the significance of
blood as a transmission route remains unknown.

Understanding the clinical contexts within which SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in blood
is important to determine the extent to which PCR-positive blood, plasma or serum could
have impact as a clinically useful biomarker of disease severity or prognosis. Furthermore,
there is an urgent need to consider whether the detection of viral RNA in blood samples
reflects the presence of infectious virus, as this has important safety implications for
clinicians and laboratory personnel engaged in both routine laboratory testing, as well as
COVID-19-specific pipelines such as serology [5,6].

Different organisations have made varying recommendations for the laboratory handling of
samples from patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2, but these have had to be
developed quickly in the face of little experience or data, and rely on the presence of viral
RNA in samples as an imperfect surrogate for live virus. Laboratory protocols seeking to
reduce the bioburden of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples suggest either chemical
inactivation (e.g. with sodium-dodecyl-sulfate, Triton-X100, and/or guanidinium thiocyanatelysis buffers), alone or in combination with heating protocols that vary from 30°C up to as
high as 92°C for 15 minutes [7]. These approaches add processing time, may require
additional laboratory reagents, and are also potentially associated with a loss of sensitivity in
any downstream analysis, particularly pertinent for serological assays. Previous reports
suggest that heat inactivation may be particularly detrimental to the sensitivity of antibody
detection [8].

An alternative to chemical or heat inactivation is to undertake all sample handling in a
biosafety (containment) level 3 (BSL3) facility, but this is expensive, requires specialist staff
training, substantially reduces the number of samples that can be processed, and is
completely inaccessible in many settings. There is a lack of consensus about appropriate
biosafety precautions, and escalate to BSL3 may be based on concerns about risks
associated with viraemic samples even when the risk of aerosol generation is low, and there
are no data to suggest a risk of blood-borne transmission to laboratory staff.

Here we assimilate the peer-reviewed literature describing the presence of SARS CoV-2
RNA in human blood, with the aim of providing a pooled dataset to provide improved insights
into the causes and correlates of RNA-aemia. We then present our own investigation of the
frequency and determinants of vRNA detection in blood using 424 samples collected from
acutely infected and convalescent patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. We attempted in vitro
isolation of the virus from viraemic samples in order to determine whether RNA detection is a
marker of infectious virus. Together, these data may help to determine the significance of
viral RNA in blood, and can contribute to the development of consistent and evidence-based
laboratory protocols.

METHODS
Terminology and definitions

● Blood: we have used the term blood to refer to whole blood, serum or plasma when
there is not a clear distinction in existing pre-published data, although we recognise
that there may be differences in the sensitivity of viral detection between whole blood
and blood fractions.

● Serum: in the work undertaken here, we refer specifically to serum, as this blood
fraction was consistently used across our experiments.

● RNA-aemia: we have used this term to describe the presence of viral RNA, above
the technical limits of detection of RT-PCR assays, in blood, serum or plasma. The
alternative term, ‘viraemia’, suggests the presence of whole virus in blood. Since we
have not demonstrated the presence of replication-competent (infectious) SARSCoV-2 in the blood compartment, we have elected to use the more conservative
description of RNA-aemia (which may or not indicate viraemia).

Systematic literature review
We searched PubMed, Web of Science, MedRxiv and Google between 7th-11th May 2020,
using the search terms (“SARS-CoV-2” OR “COVID” OR “2019-nCoV” OR “COVID-19” OR
"2019 NCOV" or "SARS COV 2" or "2019NCOV" or "2019-nCoV" or "2019 novel
coronavirus") AND (“qPCR” OR “RT-PCR” OR “PCR” OR “VIRAL LOAD” OR “RNAaemia”
OR “RNAemia” OR “viraemia” OR “viremia” OR “RNA-aemia” OR “RNA-emia”) AND
(“BLOOD” OR “PLASMA” OR “SERUM”). We excluded animal studies. We did not make
exclusions on the basis of language, but two papers not in English were ruled out because
they did not contain details of vRNA detection that we required. Each study was reviewed by
at least two independent reviewers. A PRISMA flow chart is presented, showing
identification of 28 relevant studies (Figure 1; Table S1). We collected information on the

prevalence of vRNA detection in blood, serum or plasma, noting whether this attribute was
correlated with clinical or laboratory phenotypes of disease, and recording Ct values when
these were reported. Data were collated in Microsoft Excel. To undertake a meta-analysis,
we removed one study each of uninfected (healthy) donors and convalescent individuals,
and four studies with <5 participants, taking the final number of studies analysed to 22
(Figure 2).

Cohorts and sample selection
We studied a total of 323 serum samples from 278 individuals (Table S2), all of whom had
SARS-CoV-2 detected by a clinical diagnostic microbiology laboratory using RT-PCR on a
respiratory swab. We collected 212 serum samples through the microbiology department at
Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, OUH NHSFT, comprising adults with a
diagnosis of COVID-19, classified in three groups as follows:
(i) Hospital in-patients, n=139 samples from 94 participants; these were collected
from individuals admitted to OUH NHSFT, a tertiary referral centre in the South
East of England, for treatment of COVID-19. Samples were collected between 1-5
days following admission to hospital or intensive care (whichever came later), a
median of 8 days following symptom onset (range 1-37 days).
(ii) Convalescent healthcare workers, n=41 samples from 41 participants; these
were collected from healthcare workers from OUH NHSFT, following a period of ≥
7 days absence from work following a diagnosis of COVID-19, a median of 12 days
following symptom onset (range 7-17 days).
(iii) Convalescent patients, n=32 samples from 32 participants; these were
collected from patients presenting to OUH NHS FT followed up in the community, a
median of 42 days following onset of COVID-19 symptoms (range 31-62 days).

Additional samples were collected through NHS Blood and Transfusion (NHSBT), as follows:
(vi) Convalescent plasma donors, n=111 samples from 111 volunteer plasma
donors, ≥28 days from recovery of symptoms.
(v) Healthy pre-pandemic controls, n=5 samples from 5 independent healthy
volunteer donors, collected prior to December 2019.

In groups (i)-(iii) >1 sample was obtained from 45 individuals, so our clinical dataset overall
represents 167 unique individuals with COVID-19. Among these 167 individuals, we
classified severity of illness as asymptomatic, mild, severe, or critical based on standard

℃

WHO criteria [9]. All serum samples were frozen in 0.5ml aliquots at -20 .

RT-PCR on serum samples
Following nucleic acid extraction, we used reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to amplify SARSCoV targets from serum samples. Due to different pathways for patient recruitment and
sample processing, PCR protocols varied by cohort (indicated in Table S2). Further specific
details of each method are provided in supplementary material (S3) available on-line [10]. In
brief:
1. Samples from acute hospital admissions and convalescent health care workers were
processed by the OUH NHSFT clinical microbiology laboratory, using a Symphony
Rotorgene protocol with an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene target,
validated by Public Health England (PHE) for use on respiratory samples [11][12].
2. For convalescent OUH NHSFT patients, a nested PCR was undertaken using newly
developed PCR primers [13].
3. Convalescent samples collected through NHSBT were analysed by Public Health
England (Colindale), targeting either RdRp or a conserved region of the open reading
frame (ORF1ab) gene of SARS CoV-2, together with detection of an assay internal
control to monitor the extraction and RT-PCR processes. Reverse transcription and
PCR amplification was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7500 FAST system.

High cycle threshold (Ct) values (>37.0) are often viewed as being non-specific in clinical
diagnostic laboratories depending on the clinical situation. However, for research purposes
we collected and reported all Ct values.

Viral culture system
For viral culture, we used 20 serum samples, designated VC01-20 (identified in Table S2).
VC01-16 comprised acute and convalescent samples that were RT-PCR positive, selected
at random from our sample bank, representing samples from 12 individual patients (four
individuals were represented at two timepoints), collected at 3-20 days following onset of
symptoms. VC17-20 were pre-pandemic control samples. One further sample collected from
a pre-pandemic NHSBT serum donation was used as media (VC21).
Samples VC01-20 were provided blinded for viral culture experiments. 50 μL aliquots of
samples VC1-VC20 were separately added to 2.4 x 105 Vero E6 cells (Cell Bank, Sir William
Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford) in 24 well plates. Cells were propagated in
Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum
(FBS). Virus growth assays were done in DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS, glutamine and
penicillin/streptomycin, according to published methods [14]. In parallel, wells of the same
number of cells were cultured in triplicate without virus challenge but with 50 μL control

serum (VC21), or in duplicate with a stock of Victoria/01/2020 SARS-CoV-2 passage 4
(Oxford) at calculated ten-fold serial dilutions per well of 78, 7.8, 0.78 and 0.078 plaque
forming units (pfu) in 50 μL of control serum (VC21).
Wells were observed daily for cytopathic effects (CPE), and 50 μL samples were taken for
vRNA extraction on day 3 post-challenge. Where residual sample volumes permitted, 50 μL
aliquots of the respective serum were processed in parallel. In addition, 1 x 108 vRNA copies
produced by in vitro transcription and quantified by droplet digital PCR were spiked into two
equivalent control media samples, and processed in parallel, to provide quantification and
estimate the loss of vRNA during extraction. All samples were processed for vRNA using
QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA extracts were
analysed by qRT-PCR, and vRNA copy number was interpolated from the standard curve of
Ct value by known copy number. On day 4, 50 μL aliquots of supernatants from cells
challenged with VC01-20 were “blind passaged” to fresh cells, and the remaining
supernatants were harvested and stored separately at -80C for future analysis. After a
further 3 days, we recorded CPE, if any, for second passage cultures.

RT-PCR of culture supernatant
To determine whether there had been productive infection of cells in vitro, we took aliquots
of culture supernatant, including positive and negative controls, and serum samples for qRTPCR analysis using CDC NP1, CDC NP2 and HKU ORF1b diagnostic panels. RNA
standards with a quantitative logarithmic range from 107 to 101 vRNA copies/reaction were
included to calculate vRNA copy numbers across all samples. Details are provided in
supplementary material S4.

Ethics
Acute hospital in-patients were recruited into the Sepsis Immunomics study (Ref:
19/SC/0296). Convalescent healthcare workers with hospital encounters (n=38) and
convalescent patients (n=32) provided informed consent for recruitment into the ISARIC
WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK (ISARIC WHO CCP-UK), with ethics approval by
the South Central (Oxford C) Research Ethics Committee in England (Ref: 13/SC/0149), and
Scotland A Research Ethics Committee in Scotland (Ref: 20/SS/0028). Additional
convalescent healthcare workers were recruited by the Oxford GI Biobank, n=3 (approval by
Yorkshire and The Humber - Sheffield Research Ethics Committee, ref. 16/YH/0247).
Healthy pre-pandemic control samples were used under the NHSBT ethics, providing donor
consent for their samples to be used in research.

Statistical analysis
Anonymised data were stored using Microsoft Excel. We analysed and presented data using
GraphPad Prism v.8.3.1. Statistical analyses were undertaken using R 3.6.2. Binomial
confidence intervals are presented for proportions. Univariable and multivariable logistic
regression models were used to determine associations between detectable vRNA and time
since symptom onset, disease severity and patient sex and age, accounting for any nonlinear effects of continuous factors using natural cubic splines. Meta-analysis was
undertaken using the meta package for R, version 4.12.

RESULTS
Literature review to determine the frequency and clinical associations of RNA-aemia
We identified 28 relevant studies (Table 1; Table S1), among which 22 contained metadata
suitable for meta-analysis (Fig 1). Point estimates for the frequency of vRNA detection are
presented for each study representing ≥5 individuals, together with 95% confidence intervals
(Figure 2; Table S1). We observed considerable heterogeneity in the range of estimates for
vRNA-aemia, from 0% in several studies [15–19], up to 76% in a report of patients in a
critical care setting [20]. Pooling the data from these reports, the point estimate for the
prevalence of vRNA in blood products in the 28 days following symptomatic infection is 10%
(95%CI 5-18%, random effects model).
Viral RNA-aemia was reported in association with more severe disease in some studies,
including a higher risk of admission to critical care settings, and increased incidence of acute
clinical deterioration [21–24]. One study reported lower RNA levels in serum compared to
other sample sites [3], whilst another found RNA levels in blood to be no different to that of
other sample types [4]. In a small number of reports that included specific Ct values, these
were typically high, although studies used variable PCR targets and different thresholds for
reporting positivity (details of methods and reported Ct values are available in Table S2).

We excluded two studies from the meta-analysis because they focused on cohorts with
different characteristics from all other samples sets. One of these reported PCR results from
samples taken at timepoints beyond 28 days, among which none contained vRNA [19]. The
other investigated vRNA-aemia in blood donors in Wuhan, China at the time of the peak of
the local epidemic in the first three months of 2020, finding vRNA in six samples from among
>7000 screened [25].

Our local clinical sample set included n=212 samples from 167 patients (median age 57
years, IQR 46-76), 89 male (53%). In 163 patients in whom clinical data were available,
disease was classified as asymptomatic (n=1, 0.6%), mild (n=81, 50.0%), severe (n=37,
22.7%), or critical (n=44, 27.0%). In this sample set, collected at a median of 11 days post
symptom onset (IQR 7-17 days), 27/212 were PCR positive for vRNA (12.7%, 95%CI 8.618.0%). Deduplicating this to represent 167 unique individuals, 20 (12.0%, 95%CI 7.517.9%) had RT-PCR positive serum at any time point tested. Considering all 212 samples in
a multivariable analysis, critical disease severity was associated with increased vRNAaemia, comparing mild and asymptomatic cases to severe (OR 2.3, 95%CI 0.5-12.6, p=0.29)
and critical cases (OR 7.5, 95%CI 2.0-37.3, p=0.006) (Table 2). Within this dataset there
was moderate statistical evidence of a trend towards decreased odds of vRNA-aemia over
time (OR, per day, 0.95, 95%CI 0.89-1.00, p=0.12) (Table 2; Figure 3).

Pooling our hospital data with results from the NHSBT convalescent cohort, vRNA was
detected in 23/131 (17.6%, 95%CI 11.5-25.2) samples collected up to day 13, 4/40 samples
from between day 14-27 (10.0%, 95%CI 2.8-23.7%), and 0/143 samples at ≥28 days (0%,
95%CI 0.0-2.5%) (Figure 2B). Day 20 was the latest time point at which any PCR positive
sample was collected.

Ct values for all of our 27 PCR-positive sera were high (median 40.9, range 33.6-44.8).
Using the more stringent Ct threshold of 37 that may be applied by clinical laboratories to
report a positive result, only 7/25 fell below this cut off, reducing our overall positive rate to
7/212 among the local clinical cohort (3.3%, 95%CI 1.3-6.6%) or 7/424 across our entire
sample set (1.6%, 95%CI 0.7-3.4%).

Cytopathic effects arise in cell cultures inoculated with reference viral stock, but not
in samples from COVID-19 patients or pre-pandemic controls
Healthy uninfected control cell cultures of Vero E6 cells were established (Figure 4A). We
observed substantial cytopathic effects (CPE) in all samples inoculated with reference virus,
characterised by cell rounding up and detaching (Figure 4B). CPE of this type was observed
in wells challenged with 78 and 7.8 pfu, and moderate but typical CPE was observed in one
well challenged with calculated 0.78 pfu reference virus. Cells exposed to a 1/10 dilution of
control plasma did not show typical viral CPE. However in contrast to the CPE seen with
reference virus, these control samples, the VC01-20 test cultures, and the culture inoculated
with 0.078 pfu, instead showed variable cellular abnormalities and noticeable gel-formation
in most samples (Figure 4C). Second passage cultures were undertaken in all cases, and
none showed evident cytopathic effects at day 7 (Figure 4D). This approach is limited to the

sample volume of 50 μL but we have demonstrated a single pfu at this volume reliably. Our
detection threshold is <20 pfu/mL plasma, suggesting that plasma samples contain <0.1
infectious unit per 50 μL.
RT-PCR of culture supernatant
To determine whether there had been productive infection of cells in vitro, we took aliquots
of culture supernatant for RT-PCR. From the positive control cultures, any culture receiving

≥1 infectious unit of virus (78 and 7.8 pfu in 50 μL of control serum) on day 0 produced ≥1 x
105 copies of viral RNA (vRNA) per sample by day 3, detected by all three (CDC NP1, CDC
NP2 and HKU ORF1b) primer/probe sets. All diagnostic panels also detected low levels of
vRNA in the culture inoculated with a calculated dose of 0.078 pfu. These vRNA traces are
likely to reflect fragments and RNA debris from the cells in which the virus was grown.

No serum sample, and no serum-inoculated cultures had >100 vRNA copies by day 3 based
on the CDC, NP1 and NP2 assays. Marginal vRNA was detected in 10 serum samples, but
none of these showed a rising titre by day 3 and none had vRNA levels within the reliably
quantifiable range. The highest were in the range found in the sub-infectious dose positive
control cultures (supplementary material S4). In contrast, no vRNA copies could be detected
in serum-inoculated cultures tested at day 3 using the HKU ORF1b primer/probe set, while
for the majority of original sera samples the HKU ORF1b assay gave similar results to the
CDC, NP1 and NP2 diagnostic panel. The only exception from this was VC15, where
marginal vRNA was detected in both serum and serum-inoculated cultures. These results
suggest that no rising titre or no vRNA can be detected in serum-inoculated cultures. The
comparison between the CDC and HKU diagnostic panels highlights interesting differences
for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus and should be explored further.

DISCUSSION
Impact of results
Recognition that SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be detected and quantified in blood highlights its
potential provenance as a biomarker, but also raises concerns about safety for personnel
handling samples in clinical and research environments. Protocols to underpin the safe
handling of blood samples need to consider the best evidence for routes and risks of

possible - unified, and evidence-based. Developing new data to support laboratory practice
is an important foundation for standardising practical guidelines.

Based on a systematic review of the literature, together with our own data, we estimate that
SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be present at low copy numbers in ~10% of blood samples obtained
from individuals with COVID-19 prior to day 28, most of which arise at earlier timepoints and
in the setting of more severe disease. Despite being PCR-positive for vRNA, none of our
clinical samples exceeded the threshold for viral infectivity.

Relationship between viral load and disease phenotype
The Ct values reported in the literature and in our local samples are high, reflecting low copy
numbers and suggesting that assays may be detecting genomic fragments rather than
replication-competent virus in blood. However, it is also possible that intact virions are
present, but that these are immune-complexed or otherwise neutralised, accounting for the
lack of CPE in our culture system.

A previous study reported a decline in RNA-aemia in severe cases from 45% at the time of
admission to 11% by week 4, and in mild cases from 27% to 0% over the same time period,
although these differences did not reach statistical significance [3]. Viral load (measured by
qRT-PCR) in respiratory samples has been correlated with disease severity [3,26,27].
Detection of vRNA in blood therefore may be more common in severe/critical disease as a
result of higher viral loads overall, or specifically relating to a high burden of infection in the
lungs leading to spill-over into the circulation, or reflecting the destruction of infected cells in
the respiratory epithelium. Multisystem end-organ disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 could
reflect systemic viral dissemination by blood or lymphatics (potentially with direct infection of
lymphocytes), or may arise as a consequence of a sepsis syndrome triggered primarily by
localised pulmonary infection [28]. Given the high Ct values for vRNA in blood, the
identification of virus in the vascular compartment currently remains non-specific; further
work is needed to understand its origins and significance, and to determine whether vRNA in
the blood is innocuous or could contribute to immune dysfunction and the systemic
inflammatory process.

Further work is needed to determine the bioburden and clinical significance of SARS-CoV-2
in other tissue types, for example in faeces [29,30]. Different clinical and laboratory infection
control practices to be considered for specific sample types, to determine the frequency and
duration of carriage and to assess whether infectious virus can be detected.

Caveats and limitations
Datasets reported in the literature represent mostly a small number of carefully selected
patients, typically in the acute hospital setting and therefore biased towards inclusion of
more unwell patients meeting WHO criteria for severe or critical disease. Recognising that
the field that is currently moving at pace, we elected to include papers from the pre-print
server MedRxiv, for which peer review has not been undertaken. As a result, not all material
included has undergone this quality assurance step. Published reports frequently do not
include timing of sample collection relative to diagnostic respiratory samples and/or symptom
onset, samples from individuals with trivial or absent symptoms are not well represented in
existing studies and there are insufficient data to distinguish between frequency or
quantification of vRNA present in whole blood, versus serum or plasma.

Due to the logistics of rapid recuitment of different patient groups through different pathways,
RT-PCR methods varied by cohort, potentially introducing some variation in the sensitivity of
detection. In our clinical samples, we adopted an inclusive approach to reporting detection of
vRNA, by including samples with Ct values above those which would normally be called
positive by a clinical diagnostic facility. This may lead to an over-estimation of the true
prevalence of RNA-aemia in this sample group. Many previous publications do not report ct
values and direct comparisons between datasets are therefore difficult.

The absence of CPE and amplification of vRNA must be considered within the constraints of
the low sample volume (50 μL in each assay), and the limits of detection within the assays
used. We tested serum samples after they had been subjected to a freeze/thaw cycle, which
could also have potential influence on retrieval of infectious virus. However, as samples
were frozen in accordance with standard laboratory operating protocols within a few hours of
collection, we anticipate this would have a limited impact on viral replication capacity, as has
been demonstrated previously for other viruses [31–33].

Conclusions
Our data confirm that blood from COVID-19 patients may contain detectable RNA, but this
arises in a minority of samples and is typically in low copy numbers, often outside the
threshold that would be reported as positive in a clinical diagnostic laboratory. Based on
evaluation of a small sample set, we have found no evidence to suggest that blood samples
containing RNA could yield replication competent virus, suggesting a negligible risk of
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to healthcare workers and laboratory staff from handling such
material. However, laboratory practice should be informed by guidance from Public Health
England [34], CDC [35] and WHO [36]; individual risk assessment is important to account for

the nature of the material being handled and the process being undertaken. Universal
precautions and routine safety procedures should be carefully observed, not only to protect
from COVID-19 infection but also to provide protection from other potential pathogens.
Further data are needed to determine the extent to which serum PCR positivity for vRNA is
useful as a diagnostic or prognostic marker in patients with COVID-19 infection.
