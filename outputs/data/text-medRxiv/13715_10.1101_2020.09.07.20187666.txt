One Sentence Summary: Intestinal infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a mild
inflammatory response and improved clinical outcomes.

Abstract: Given that gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are a prominent extrapulmonary
manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we investigated intestinal infection with
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its effect on disease
pathogenesis. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in small intestinal enterocytes by immunofluorescence
staining or electron microscopy, in 13 of 15 patients studied. High dimensional analyses of GI
tissues revealed low levels of inflammation in general, including active downregulation of key
inflammatory genes such as IFNG, CXCL8, CXCL2 and IL1B and reduced frequencies of

proinflammatory dendritic cell subsets. To evaluate the clinical significance of these findings,
examination of two large, independent cohorts of hospitalized patients in the United States and
Europe revealed a significant reduction in disease severity and mortality that was independent of
gender, age, and examined co-morbid illnesses. The observed mortality reduction in COVID-19
patients with GI symptoms was associated with reduced levels of key inflammatory proteins
including IL-6, CXCL8, IL-17A and CCL28 in circulation but was not associated with significant
differences in nasopharyngeal viral loads. These data draw attention to organ-level heterogeneity
in disease pathogenesis and highlight the role of the GI tract in attenuating SARS-CoV-2associated inflammation with related mortality benefit.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a multisystem illness caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) a recently discovered novel betacoronavirus(1-3).
Manifestations of COVID-19 range from asymptomatic infection to severe, life-threatening
disease with end-organ damage(3-5). Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and
shortness of breath that occur within 2 to 14 days after exposure to SARS-CoV-2(6). A subset of
COVID-19 patients also report gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, comprising nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, abdominal pain and/or loss of appetite(7-11), which is not surprising given that the host
receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (ACE2 receptor) is highly expressed on intestinal epithelium(12, 13).
Several studies have demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the fecal samples of
infected persons(11, 14-17) and in some cases even after clearance from respiratory samples(17).
Additionally, several members of the Coronaviridae family are known to be enterotropic, causing
gastroenteritis in addition to respiratory illness(18). Notably, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, closely

related to SARS-CoV-2, have been identified in fecal samples of infected individuals(19-22).
Finally, the presence of GI involvement by SARS-CoV-2 has also been suggested by
epidemiological(23), clinical(24), non-human primate(25) and in vitro(26-29) data. However, to
date, there is limited evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection of human enterocytes(15) and there are
no studies on the responses of the GI immune system, arguably the largest in the body, in COVID19 patients.
Immune dysregulation has been suggested as a primary driver of morbidity and mortality
in COVID-19. Several cytokines and other immunological parameters have been correlated with
COVID-19 severity. Most notably, elevated IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, MCP-1 and IP-10 levels were
detected in hospitalized patients, especially critically ill patients, in several studies, and were
associated with ICU admission, respiratory failure, and poor prognosis(3, 30-36). Alongside this
pro-inflammatory cytokine environment, significant immune cell alterations have been described
such as lymphopenia, T and B cell activation, and exhaustion(37), as well as altered frequencies
of myeloid cells, including conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells
(pDCs)(5, 38, 39).
Given the emerging evidence of enteric involvement by SARS-CoV-2, immune
dysregulation in COVID-19 and the propensity of the GI immune system to suppress
inflammation, we aimed to document infection of the GI tract in patients with COVID-19 and to
define the impact of GI involvement on disease pathogenesis. Here, we present findings from wellcharacterized cohorts of COVID-19 patients hospitalized in tertiary care centers, from both New
York City, USA and Milan, Italy, where we conducted high dimensional analyses of mucosal and
systemic immune parameters and investigated disease outcomes associated with GI involvement
in COVID-19 patients.

Results
The gastrointestinal tract of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients was endoscopically uninflamed in
most patients
We sought to obtain GI tissue to determine if SARS-CoV-2 virus can be detected in human
enterocytes in vivo as suggested by ex vivo enteroid studies(40, 41). To this end, we enrolled 18
COVID-19 patients and 10 SARS-CoV-2 uninfected controls who underwent upper GI endoscopy
(SARS-CoV-2 infected n=16, uninfected n=8), colonoscopy (SARS-CoV-2 infected n=1,
uninfected n=1) or both upper endoscopy and colonoscopy (SARS-CoV-2 infected n=1, uninfected
n=1) (Table 1 and table S1). Patient 10 was initially suspected to have COVID-19 but was
ultimately excluded after multiple negative SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal (NP) PCR tests and
negative COVID-19 antibody tests. The remaining 17 cases were classified as asymptomatic / mild
/ moderate (n=10) or severe (n=7) disease according to the criteria detailed in table S2. GI biopsies
were performed after 17.3 ± 17.5 days from last positive nasopharyngeal (NP) swab (if patient had
a positive NP swab after the procedure, it was considered to be 0 days from last PCR positive)
(Fig. 1A). COVID-19 symptoms on presentation and treatment regimens were diverse as detailed
in table S3. Sample allocation for different assays is detailed in fig. S1 and table S4.
The GI mucosa was endoscopically uninflamed in all subjects regardless of the severity of
illness, with no evidence of loss of vascularity, edema, friability, erosions or ulcerations (Fig. 1B),
except for one post-intestinal transplant case where inflammation was attributed to transplant
rejection. Histopathological examination revealed normal histology in 4 cases, while of the
remaining cases, we observed a mild increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in 8 cases and
a scant neutrophilic infiltrate in 7 cases (Fig. 1, C and D, fig. S2 and, table S4).

Small bowel enterocytes have robust expression of Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2)
and harbor SARS-CoV-2 antigens
An initial step in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis entails binding of viral spike (S) protein to the host
ACE2 receptor, leading to viral entry and infection(42). Using immunofluorescence (IF) staining,
we observed robust and extensive expression of ACE2 on the small intestinal brush border in both
controls and COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2, A to H). Additionally, we detected SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid protein in small intestinal enterocytes of COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2, I and N, fig.
S3), but not controls (Fig. 2, M and R, fig. S4), indicative of virus infection in these cells.
Remarkably, when present, the distribution of viral antigens was patchy in the upper small
intestines (duodenum; Fig. 2, I to L), but diffuse in the lower small intestines (ileum; Fig. 2, N to
Q). Positive staining was exclusively seen in the epithelium irrespective of intestinal location of
the biopsies. Overall, of the 11 COVID-19 patients where IF staining was performed, 10 showed
viral antigen on IF microscopy in at least one intestinal segment (duodenum or ileum) (table S4).
Interestingly, the presence of viral antigens on IF did not correlate with the presence of histologic
abnormalities. As negative controls, 5 duodenal biopsies and 6 ileal biopsies from 10 patients
collected prior to the pandemic (table S5), showed no evidence of viral antigens on
immunostaining (Fig. 2, M and R, fig. S4).

Ultrastructural analyses of GI tissues reveal viral particles in small intestinal enterocytes
Transmission electron microscopy of intestinal biopsy tissues revealed the presence of 70-110 nm
viral particles in the enterocytes of the duodenum and ileum (Fig. 2, S to U). Pleomorphic,
spherical structures, morphologically consistent with SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were observed
in conjunction with small vesicles within enterocytes along the basolateral surface of the

enterocytes (Fig. 2S) and blebbing off of the enterocyte apex (Fig. 2U). Particles with distinct,
stalk-like projections (corona) were seen within the enterocyte cytoplasm (Fig. 2T). Overall, of the
13 patient samples processed for electron microscopy studies, 6 showed viral-like particles on
ultrastructural analyses (table S4).

Infectious virions could not be isolated from the GI tissues of COVID-19 patients
Attempts were made to assess for the presence of potentially infectious virions in the intestines of
COVID-19 patients. When we inoculated Vero E6 cells with the supernatants of homogenized
intestinal tissues from COVID-19 patients, we did not observe any apparent cytopathic effects
(CPE) in the cells, despite culturing them for a week. In addition, cell culture supernatants did not
reveal the presence of viral RNA by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and plaque assays.
Experiments showed no plaque formation in Vero E6 cells after staining with 2% crystal violet
solution.

GI lamina propria pro-inflammatory dendritic cells are depleted in COVID-19 patients
Next, we performed mass cytometry (CyTOF) based immunophenotypic analyses on the GI tissues
of 13 and peripheral blood of 10 COVID-19 cases and 10 controls (Table 1, table S1, fig. S1). GI
tissues were processed to separate lamina propria (LP) and epithelial compartment (EC) fractions
and both compartments were analyzed separately. Immune populations were clustered on the basis
of cell- type specific markers for both the intestinal compartments (LP and EC) and blood (Fig. 3,
A, C and G, fig. S6A and S7A, data file S1). While the overall distribution of canonical immune
cell subsets in the GI LP were comparable between COVID-19 and control patients (Fig. 3, A and
B), few immune populations showed differences as detailed below. Additionally, no clear

differences in the LP could be discerned between patients with asymptomatic/mild/moderate
disease and those with severe disease (Fig. 3B, data file S2).
In the LP, among myeloid cells, CD206+CD1c+ “inflammatory” cDC2 (conventional
DCs)(43) were reduced in COVID-19 cases compared to controls (0.4-fold decrease, p=0.01).
Additionally, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) were reduced in COVID-19 cases (0.5 fold decrease,
p=0.07) (Fig. 3, D and E), analogous to changes described in the peripheral blood of COVID-19
patients(36). Among other LP populations, effector (PD-1+CD38+) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were
significantly increased in COVID-19 cases compared to the controls (Fig. 3F), while CD8+CD103+
T cells (tissue resident memory subset) were higher in COVID-19 cases compared to controls (1.7fold increase, p=0.06) (fig. S5A). Neutrophils (3-fold), eosinophils (1.9-fold), CD4-CD8-T cells
(3.5-fold) and CD4+CD103+ T cells (1.8-fold) were increased in COVID-19 cases, but these
differences were not statistically significant possibly due to the sample size. We also observed a
trend of non-significantly decreased regulatory CD4+ T (TREG) cells (0.6-fold decrease) and
increased IgM+ plasma cells (2.3-fold increase) in the LP of infected cases vs controls (fig. S5A).
The distribution of naïve and memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was altered in COVID-19 patients,
with a reduction of naïve CD4+ T cells and EMRA (effector memory re-expressing RA) CD8+ T
cells in the LP of COVID-19 patients (fig. S5B), but this difference did not reach statistical
significance.
Similar to the LP, the EC showed a reduction of CD206+ cDC2 in COVID-19 cases
compared to controls (0.4-fold decrease, p=0.05), while the CD4-CD8- subset of IELs was
significantly increased (1.6-fold-increase, p=0.03) (Fig. 3H). CD8+ T cells, the dominant IEL
population, showed an increase (2.6-fold) in COVID-19 cases compared to controls but the
difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.4) (data file S2), likely owing to inter-patient

variability, also observed by light microscopy. A subset of CD8+ IELs, CD8+CD69+ T cells,
showed a non-significant increase in COVID-19 cases vs controls (3.9-fold, p=0.2), while plasma
cells were comparable between the cases and controls (fig. S6, B and C).
In the peripheral blood, cell type assignments were carried out using specific cell surface
markers (fig. S7A). We observed that effector (PD-1+CD38+) T cells (for both CD4+ and CD8+ T
lymphocytes) were significantly increased in PBMCs of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (Fig.
3I). CD14-CD16+ inflammatory monocytes trended lower in COVID-19 cases compared to
controls (0.4-fold decrease, p=0.09). In contrast, CD14+CD16- “classical” monocytes were
comparable in COVID-19 cases and controls (p=0.3) (fig. S7B). Additionally, a non-significant
increase in IgG+ plasma cells (7.2-fold, p=0.13) and a non-significant decrease in TREG (0.8-fold,
p=0.2) were observed in COVID-19 cases (fig. S7, C and D, data file S2). Finally, a significant
increase in activated (CD29+CD38+) CD4+ T cells was noted in the peripheral blood of COVID19 cases compared to controls (fig. S8A) and a non-significant increase of these activated T cells
in the LP of COVID-19 patients (fig. S8B). Details of all immune population changes in the
intestinal tissues and in circulation are provided in data file S2.
Altogether, similar to published data from the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients(36),
intestinal tissues from COVID-19 cases showed reduced pro-inflammatory DCs and pDCs but
increased effector T cells compared to controls.

GI lamina propria pro-inflammatory pathways are downregulated in COVID-19 patients
To further probe the molecular response of the GI tract following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we
performed RNA-Seq on the EC and LP intestinal compartments separately in 13 COVID-19
patients and 8 controls. Samples derived from the EC and LP clustered separately on the basis of

their top transcriptional signatures, demonstrating distinctness of the two compartments within the
GI tract (fig. S9, data file S3). Accordingly, comparisons between COVID-19 cases and controls
were performed separately for each tissue, and 1063 differentially expressed genes (DEG) were
identified out of total 11419 genes detected (Fig. 4A, data file S3). The majority of DEGs were
detected in the LP (1061, false discovery rate (42) £ 0.05), compared to 12 DEGs in the EC that
largely overlapped with the LP (Fig. 4A). Both LP and EC showed upregulation of genes involved
in immunomodulation, including the anti-microbial peptide LCN2, and the metallothioneins
MT1E, MT1F, MT1H, MT1M, MT1X, MT2A and TMEM107. In addition, heat shock proteins,
HSPA1A and HASPA1B, were downregulated in both tissues. Pathway enrichment analysis of
DEGs ranked by significance revealed several KEGG pathways that were depleted in COVID-19
patients compared to controls (Fig. 4B). Downregulation of pathways linked to TH17 cell
differentiation and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) was characterized by the depletion of
RORA, IL4R, IFNG, IL18R1, IL1B, STAT4 and HLA-DRA. Pathways linked to antigen processing,
TH1 and TH2 cell differentiation, and MAPK signaling were significantly downregulated in the LP
from COVID-19 patients. In contrast, genes associated with metabolic functions, including amino
acid metabolism (NOS2, SMS, ALDH2, GOT2), mineral absorption (MT1G, MT2A, MT1E), as well
as mucin biosynthesis (GALNT7, GALNT3, GALNT8) were significantly upregulated in COVID19 patients compared to controls (Fig. 4B).
We considered the possibility that the observed expression changes could imply alterations
in relative cell type proportions (in addition to transcriptional alterations within cells). Therefore,
we interrogated GI data derived from single-cell RNA-seq(44) for enrichment of cell type-specific
gene expression signatures. Consistent with our CyTOF data (Fig. 3 and data files S1 and S2),
genes associated with DCs and eosinophils were reduced in COVID-19 patients compared to

controls (Fig. 4C). Additionally, signatures related to the size of endothelial cell and mast cell
pools were reduced, while genes linked to goblet cells, proliferating epithelial cells,
enteroendocrine cells and epithelial stem cells were increased, possibly reflecting the sequelae of
intestinal epithelial infection by SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent recovery (Fig. 4C).
Given the unexpected reduction in DC numbers in the GI tissues, we probed myeloid gene
signatures further, and found significant downregulation of genes associated with pDC (DAPK1,
IRF7, ICAM1 and GM2A), activated DCs (TNFAIP2, CD86, CD83), cDC1 (RELB, IRF8 and HLADRA) and cDC2 (CLEC7A and CLEC10A). Of note, we also found that LP genes associated with
inflammatory DCs (monocyte-derived DCs, MoDCs) (TGFBI, TGFB1, STAB1, SDCBP,
RNASET2, MSR1, MRC1, MERTK, DNASE1L3, CD163L1, C5AR1, SPI1, CSF1R, AOAH, ABCA)
were significantly reduced (Fig. 4D), which was consistent with the reduced number of
inflammatory DCs observed in our CyTOF results.
Finally, we looked at the average EC and LP expression of recently reported gene
signatures linked to the antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2 from post-mortem lung tissue
samples(30), and human intestinal organoids(29). Although we did not observe a substantial acute
SARS-CoV-2 response, there was significant upregulation of LCN2 in both EC and LP, and OAS
and GBP3 in the LP only. Notably, we did observe a trend towards induction of antiviral response
genes in the EC, where expression of canonical antiviral genes such as IFI44L, IFIT1, IFITM3,
IFI44, IFI6 and OAS3 was increased (Fig. 4E, top panel).
Next, using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), we rank ordered the EC DEGs according
to effect size (logFC * -logPvalue) and tested for enrichment in the reported SARS-CoV-2 infected
organoid gene signatures(29) (fig. S10A). The genes we found upregulated in the EC of COVID19 patients were significantly enriched in the SARS-COV-2 infected organoid gene datasets. We

then carried out Hallmark pathway enrichment analyses on this ranked EC gene list and found that
the top two processes associated with genes upregulated in EC were interferon alpha response
(normalized enrichment score (NES) 1.91, FDR<0.005) and interferon gamma response
(NES=1.8, FDR=0.005) (fig. S10B). This enrichment is indicative of the host antiviral response
against SARS-CoV-2 in the intestinal EC of COVID-19 patients.
We projected our RNA-seq dataset on the published data set from the human bronchial
epithelial cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and evaluated cytokines and chemokines in intestinal
samples(30). Remarkably, we found that many of the inflammatory cytokines and chemokines
such as IL-1b, IFN-g, CCL24 and CXCL8 were downregulated in the intestines of COVID-19
patients (Fig. 4E, bottom panel). The only chemokine significantly increased was CCL15 which
is reported to be structurally similar to antimicrobial peptides and has a role in maintaining
intestinal homeostasis(45) (Fig. 4E, bottom panel). We also noted that the key inflammatory genes
including IFNG, IL1B, CXCR4, TNFSF14, CXCL2, CSF-1, CXCL8, IL18R1, NRP1 and IL18BP
were downregulated in intestinal LP of COVID-19 cases compared to the uninfected controls (Fig.
4F). Interestingly, the expression of NRP1, a recently discovered host factor for SARS-CoV-2
infection(46), was found to be significantly reduced in LP of COVID-19 patients compared to the
controls.
Together, these data reveal a dynamic remodeling of GI tissues by SARS-CoV-2, notably
with a significant downregulation of pathways associated with inflammation and antigen
presentation in the LP, while with a concomitant activation of viral response signaling genes in the
EC.

Examination of a cohort of COVID-19 patients (Discovery Cohort) to assess the clinical impact
of GI involvement: clinical characteristics
Given that GI biopsies from COVID-19 patients demonstrated a paucity of cellular
inflammation and in some instances, a down regulation of key inflammatory genes, despite the
presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the enterocytes of the respective patients, we hypothesized that
intestinal involvement in COVID-19 would be associated with a milder disease course. To test our
hypothesis, we examined a large, retrospective cohort of patients (henceforth referred to as the
‘Discovery Cohort’) who were hospitalized at Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) between April 1, 2020
and April 15, 2020. Among 925 patients hospitalized with the diagnosis of COVID-19 during this
period, after an initial screening, 634 cases met our inclusion criteria of age > 18 years and having
a multiplexed cytokine panel performed during their admission (fig. S11). Demographics (gender,
age and race/ethnicity) and clinical variables including the presence of comorbid diagnoses,
COVID-19 severity and GI symptoms were carefully analyzed and documented. The mean age of
patients was 64 ± 16 years (range 23-99 years); 28% of patients self-reported as Hispanic, 25% as
African American, 22% as White and the remainder as Asian or other. Patients had multiple
comorbid illness that included obesity (37%), hypertension (HTN) (36%) and diabetes mellitus
(DM) (22%) (table S6). With regards to comorbid illnesses, the composition of the Discovery
Cohort is similar to prior reports(47).
Next, we recorded the presence of GI symptoms that have been associated with COVID19(7-11) in each of the patients. We only considered the GI symptoms that were present at the
time of hospital admission (to avoid iatrogenic confounders) and focused on symptoms that were
indicative of direct gastrointestinal involvement such as diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. We did
not consider symptoms like anorexia and weight loss (which might be multifactorial), or dysgeusia

and anosmia (indicative of nasopharyngeal involvement). Using these criteria, 299 patients (47%)
reported any of the GI symptoms of interest (nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea) with diarrhea being
the most common (245 patients, 39%), followed by nausea (157 patients, 25%), and then vomiting
(82 patients, 13%) (table S6).

COVID-19 severity was significantly reduced in patients with GI symptoms when compared to
those without GI symptoms on multivariate testing, accounting for age and comorbidities.
At the outset, we performed univariate analyses comparing the distribution of COVID-19
severities in patients with and without GI symptoms. Overall, 54 (9%) patients had mild disease,
361 (57%) moderate, 158 (25%) severe and 61 (10%) had severe COVID-19 with end organ
damage (EOD) (disease severity defined in Materials and Methods and table S2; table S6). During
hospitalization, 110 patients were admitted to the ICU (17%) and 151 patients (24%) died by the
end of data collection (6/15/2020) (table S6). Patients presenting with GI symptoms had less
severe disease than patients without GI symptoms (p<0.001 Chi-square test, Table 2). Importantly,
mortality was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms (15.7%) than those
without GI symptoms (31.0%; p<0.0001 Fisher’s exact test) (Table 2). Furthermore, each
individual GI symptom (nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) was associated with less severe disease
(p<0.02 Fisher’s exact test) and lower mortality (p<0.001 Fisher’s exact test) (table S7). These
findings were further emphasized by Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival over short-term followup of 25 days (p<0.001 log-rank test) (Fig. 5A and fig. S12, A and B). Consistent with prior
reports(35, 47, 48) older age and higher disease severity were associated with higher mortality in
the Discovery Cohort (table S8), providing validity to our findings.

Next, we decided to account for multiple comorbidities and demographics in determining
the impact of GI symptoms on COVID-19 outcomes. While patients with GI symptoms (61 ± 15
years) were younger than those without GI symptoms (67 ± 16 years), the distribution of race,
ethnicity and co-morbid illnesses including obesity, HTN, DM and inflammatory bowel diseases
(IBD) were comparable between those with and without GI symptoms (Table 2). To account for
potential confounders, especially the age difference, we created a multivariate model where we
adjusted for the effect of age, body mass index (BMI), gender, race, diabetes, HTN, chronic lung
disease and heart disease on outcomes. Consistent with published literature(49-52) (age and BMI
were positively associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality (table S9. Using this
multivariate model, we analyzed the impact of GI symptoms on disease outcomes. The presence
of any GI symptoms taken together, as well as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting taken individually,
were inversely associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality (Fig. 5B, table S9). Patients who
presented with GI symptoms had 50% reduced odds of having severe disease (odds ratio of 0.56)
and death from COVID-19 (odds ratio of 0.54), compared to the patients who presented without
GI symptoms (Fig. 5B, table S9).

An External Validation Cohort further confirms decreased mortality in COVID-19 patients with
GI symptoms on multivariate testing
Next, we identified an external cohort of 287 well-characterized patients, distinct from the MSH
Discovery Cohort (henceforth referred to as ‘External Validation Cohort’) from Milan, Italy, to
determine the impact of GI symptoms on COVID-19 associated outcomes. In this cohort, GI
symptoms on admission were characterized as presence or absence of diarrhea (table S10).
Consistent with the Discovery Cohort, patients with diarrhea on admission had significantly lower

mortality (10.0%) when compared to patients without diarrhea (23.7%, p=0.008). Additionally,
patients with diarrhea had lower composite outcome of mortality or ICU admission compared to
those without diarrhea (20% vs 40%, p=0.001) (table S10). When we performed multivariate
logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, BMI, diabetes, chronic heart and lung disease and
other confounders in our External Validation Cohort, we observed that, the presence of diarrhea
on admission was found to be significantly inversely associated with mortality with a median odds
ratio of 0.33 over 1000 bootstrap iterations (Fig. 5C). Our observations from this External
Validation Cohort were in alignment with those from our Discovery Cohort.

Presence of GI symptoms can be used to predict reduced disease severity and mortality in
patients with COVID-19
After observing significantly reduced mortality in COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms in our
Discovery and External Validation Cohort, we developed a predictive model based on the
Discovery Cohort and applied it to a distinct Internal Validation Cohort comprising 242 wellcharacterized patients with COVID-19, admitted between April 16, 2020 and April 30, 2020 to
MSH. The inclusion of ‘any GI symptoms’ to a model consisting of age and BMI at baseline,
improved the ability to predict severity and mortality with a median area under the curve (AUC)
of 0.59 (age + BMI) vs. 0.64 (age + BMI + any GI symptoms) for disease severity and 0.70 (age
+ BMI) vs. 0.73 (age + BMI + any GI symptoms) for mortality (Fig. 5D, table S11). In addition,
the effect of GI symptoms, age and BMI on the AUC was evaluated by excluding each variable
one at a time from the model and calculating the consequent reduction in AUC. The exclusion of
GI symptoms resulted in a significant reduction in AUC with a median value of 0.054 for disease
severity and 0.03 for mortality. Notably, the effect of GI symptoms on the AUC was more dramatic
than that of age (AUC reduction of 0.054 versus 0.025) for disease severity (Fig. 5E, table S11).

Nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral loads are similar in patients with and without GI symptoms.
There is recent evidence that nasopharyngeal (NP) SARS-CoV-2 viral loads are correlated with
disease outcomes(53), therefore, we compared NP viral loads in a subset of Discovery and Internal
Validation Cohort patients (n=329, where these data were available). Patients with GI symptoms
had similar SARS-CoV-2 NP viral loads compared to those without GI symptoms (mean log10
copies/mL 5.1 (SD 2.3) vs 5.6 (SD 2.4) respectively) (p=0.07); furthermore, no significant
differences in viral loads were observed when analyzing each individual GI symptom (Fig. 5F).
Therefore, the lower severity and mortality in those with GI symptoms are not explained by
differences in viral loads.

COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms have reduced levels of circulating cytokines associated
with inflammation and tissue damage.
To correlate the observed mortality difference between patients with and without GI symptoms
with known biomarkers associated with severe COVID-19, we initially examined, a set of 4
cytokines, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-1β, measured on admission in all the patients as part of
routine clinical care. IL-6, and IL-8 levels, known to be associated with poor survival(35) were
found to be significantly reduced in circulation of patients with GI symptoms (FDR 10%) (fig.
S13, table S12).
Next, to facilitate high dimensional analyses of potential immunological differences
between patients with and without GI symptoms, we performed a validated, multiplexed proteomic
assay (O-link), simultaneously quantifying 92 protein analytes in 238 patients (from among the
Discovery and Internal Validation Cohorts; GI symptoms (n=104), no GI symptoms (n=134))
where serum samples were available for analyses. Unsupervised consensus clustering of these 92

analytes revealed six groups of analytes with similar expression patterns across all COVID-19
patients (Fig. 6A, table S13). Notably, analytes in clusters 5 and 6 displayed less correlation in
patients with GI symptoms compared to those without GI symptoms (Fig. 6A, fig. S14). Next, we
interrogated biological pathways over-represented in each cluster of soluble analytes. We found
that the “KEGG Jak/Stat Signaling Pathway” was significantly enriched in Cluster 5; while the
"Hallmark Inflammatory Response" pathway was significantly enriched in Cluster 4 (Fisher’s
exact test 10% FDR). These pathways were downregulated in patients displaying diarrhea
symptoms based on pathway level signatures (p<0.05 from t-test) (Fig. 6B); suggesting a reduced
inflammatory response in patients affected by GI symptoms. In addition, we found that clusters 1,
2, 3, 5 and 6 were significantly downregulated in patients with GI symptoms compared to those
without (FDR 15%) (Fig. 6C). This downregulation seemed to be driven mostly by diarrhea since
the same clusters 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 were significantly downregulated with FDR correction at 10% in
patients who presented with diarrhea compared to those without symptoms. The reduced signal
observed for nausea and vomiting might be due to reduced statistical power given by the smaller
number of samples displaying vomiting (n=29) or nausea (n=54) symptoms.
When looking at each of the 92 analytes individually, key inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines were significantly downregulated (IL-8, TGF-a, IL-17C, IL-15RA, IL-10RB,
MMP10, TNFRSF9, OPG, IL-6, LIF, GDNF, IL-17A, ARTN and CCL28). On the other hand,
TNF-Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand (TRAIL), a cytokine with immune regulatory
properties(54, 55) and IL-7, a cytokine associated with T cell development(56) were significantly
upregulated in patients with GI symptoms compared to those without (t-test FDR 10%) (Fig. 6, D
and E, table S14). When looking at each individual GI symptom, diarrhea had the most
significantly differential analytes. Again, this difference between diarrhea, nausea and vomiting

might be due to reduced statistical power given that fewer patients presented with nausea and
vomiting than those who presented with diarrhea. Consistent with GI symptoms as a group, IL-7
was significantly increased, in addition, MCP-2 was significantly increased in patients presenting
with diarrhea.
Thus, overall, GI symptoms are associated with significantly reduced levels of key
inflammatory cytokines like IL-6, IL-8, IL-17 and CCL28 that are known to be associated with
poor COVID-19 outcomes.

Discussion
Given the robust expression of ACE2 on the small intestinal epithelium(57), at levels that
are arguably among the highest in the body(58), we hypothesized that the GI tract would be
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study was designed to test this hypothesis by
examining for human intestinal infection by SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we report on the first detailed
human study to demonstrate infection of intestinal enterocytes in vivo and to define the cellular
and transcriptomic responses of GI tissue in COVID-19 patients. Having seen an unexpected mild
inflammatory response in the intestinal tissues, despite evidence of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and
viral particles, we next hypothesized that GI involvement could perhaps be associated with
improved clinical outcomes. In two distinct and large cohorts of COVID-19 patients, we observed
a significant reduction in mortality in patients with GI symptoms compared to those without GI
symptoms, even after adjusting for multiple confounders including age and comorbid illnesses.
These data identify a potentially novel aspect of COVID-19 pathogenesis and emphasize the
presence of an ‘organ-specific’ program of host response to SARS-CoV-2, which in this case is
associated with a survival advantage.

We considered several non-mutually exclusive hypotheses to explain the lower mortality
in COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms. Multiple physiological mechanisms enable the
intestines to maintain a state of “immunological tolerance”. Among these, IgA, the dominant
intestinal immunoglobulin does not invoke the complement cascade unlike IgG, and effects a
“non-inflammatory” pathogen neutralization. A recent study has demonstrated that dimeric
Immunoglobulin A (IgA), that would be induced within mucosal tissues of the GI tract is
significantly more potent than IgG or monomeric IgA in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization(59).
Effective, but non-inflammatory viral neutralization at the intestinal mucosal surface would reduce
tissue viral loads, potentially attenuating the inflammatory cascade. Additionally, we found
increased expression of anti-inflammatory gene products, including transcripts involved in the
biogenesis of the gut-specific MUC2 mucin, a mucus-forming glycoprotein released by goblet
cells that contributes to intestinal tolerance(60). We also examined for differences in NP viral loads
between patients with and without GI symptoms, hypothesizing that perhaps the virus in some
patients is “diverted” away from the respiratory system. However, we did not observe significant
NP viral load differences between patients with and without GI symptoms. Therefore, we believe
that limited intestinal and systemic inflammation contributed to improved mortality in COVID-19
patients with GI involvement.
Multiple lines of evidence from our study and from the existing literature support this
possibility. First, and most evident was the relative paucity of inflammatory infiltrates in the
intestinal epithelium as well as LP of COVID-19 patients. Additionally, we observed a rather
significant lack of cDC2, ‘inflammatory’ DCs, pDCs in the intestinal LP. These findings mirror
observations from the SARS epidemic of 2003(19), recent autopsy data from COVID-19 patients,

and findings from a recently published small animal (golden hamsters) model, all demonstrating a
lack of intestinal inflammation despite the presence of viral antigens (61).
At a transcriptomic level, our analyses of the intestinal biopsies demonstrated the
downregulation of a number of important pro-inflammatory gene products, including IFNG, IL1B,
IKBKB and STAT3B, which contribute to TH17 cell differentiation and IBD pathogenesis.
Calprotectin, a heterodimer encompassing calgranulin A and calgranulin B, which are encoded by
S100A8 and S100A9, respectively, was recently identified as a biomarker of severe COVID-19
disease and suggested to represent a trigger of cytokine release syndrome(62). We observed no
induction of S100A8 or S100A9 in intestinal tissues, even in patients with severe COVID-19,
suggesting that the vast intestinal surface did not contribute to the production of calprotectin in
COVID-19 patients. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that are elevated in the lungs of
COVID-19 patients(63, 64) were surprisingly downregulated (IL1B, CXCL8, CXCL2, CXCR6) or
unchanged (CCL3, CXCL10, CCR1, CXCR3) in the intestines, compared to non-COVID controls.
Other relevant gene products associated with severe COVID-19(63, 65, 66) were either
significantly lower in the intestinal LP (CXCL8, IL1B, IFNG, HIF1A, HLA-DQA1) or trended
lower (CCL2, CCL4, CCL4L2, CTSB, IL23A) or were comparable to non-COVID controls
(HMGB1, CCL3, CCL8, HMOX1). Tissue-residence markers such as ITGA1, CXCR6, JAML,
which are reported to be increased in the pulmonary mucosa of severe COVID-19 patients(63),
were significantly downregulated in the GI tract. Thus, by dissecting GI tissue transcriptomic
response, we noted an immunological milieu characterized by either a suppression of or a failure
of induction of an inflammatory response against the virus. Additionally, we observed a lack of
production of secondary mediators including calprotectin, which would feed into the inflammatory
cascade and culminate in the “cytokine storm” typical of severe COVID-19. Our detailed cellular

analyses confirm a lack of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages and a depletion of
inflammatory DCs in the GI tract. This failure of induction of inflammatory pathways, regardless
of the clinical severity of disease, stands in stark contrast to the massive immunopathology, noted
systemically, and within the pulmonary mucosa of severe COVID-19 patients(67) as well as
patients with active IBD(68, 69).
With data demonstrating an attenuated inflammatory response to infection in the GI tract,
we sought to address the clinical impact of these findings and recruited two large cohorts from
North America and Europe. After controlling for multiple confounding variables including patient
age and comorbid illnesses, we found a significant reduction in COVID-19 morbidity and
mortality in hospitalized patients in both cohorts. Similar findings were recently reported in a study
of 278 patients from a Columbia University Hospital in New York City. Among COVID-19
patients with GI symptoms (diarrhea, nausea and vomiting), there was a non-significant trend
towards lower rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and a significantly lower rate of death
during short-term follow-up(70).
In a subset of patients from our large, Discovery and Internal Validation Cohorts, serum
samples were available, allowing us to study circulating biomarkers that are associated with
COVID-19 severity(30, 31, 35). Multiple proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines were found to
be downregulated in patients with GI symptoms compared to patients without. These included IL6 and IL-8, which are now considered a hallmark of increased severity and mortality in COVID19 as well as a number of other cytokines/chemokines involved in tissue inflammation. The lower
IL-17 expression we observed systemically is in line with the reduced TH17 RNA seq expression
signatures we found in biopsy samples from COVID-19 patients. IL-17 is secreted by TH17 and
innate cells and is crucial for the recruitment of neutrophils promoting inflammation in a variety

of tissues, including the intestinal mucosa(71, 72). Additionally, IL-17 has been shown to have
pathogenic effects both in SARS-CoV-2(73) as well as during SARS-CoV(74) and MERS(75)
infections. Interesting, IL-17C (specifically found to be decreased in patients with GI symptoms
in our study) is produced primarily by epithelial cells rather than hematopoietic cells(76). Our
finding of COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms having reduced CCL28, a cytokine expressed by
mucosal epithelial cells and involved in eosinophil chemotaxis(77), is consistent with prior work
showing increased eosinophils to be associated with severe COVID-19 disease(31) and our RNAseq data showing decreased eosinophil associated genes. IL-15 promotes neutrophilic cytoplasmic
re-arrangements and phagocytosis(78), DCs differentiation(79), and T cell stimulation(80). The
reduced systemic expression of the IL-15 receptor is in line with our intestinal findings showing
lower frequencies of DCs in COVID-19 patients. IL-10 is generally considered an immune
modulatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine, however an excess of IL-10 can inhibit the function
of immune cells such as NK and CD8+ T cells, possibly delaying clearance of viruses(81). Our
results of increased systemic expression of IL-10 receptor in patients presenting without GI
symptoms is in line with previous studies showing IL-10 to be elevated in COVID-19 patients,
associated with disease severity and inversely correlated with CD8+ T cells(82, 83).
In contrast, the only two cytokines found to be upregulated in patients presenting with GI
symptoms were IL-7 and TRAIL, both with important immunoregulatory functions. IL-7,
produced by stromal cells and intestinal epithelial cells, has been considered as a therapeutic agent
in COVID-19 related to its effects on T cell differentiation and survival(84). Similarly, TRAIL is
associated with immunosuppressive, immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory functions(54, 55)
as well as some evidence of viral infection control in the intestinal tract(85).

While our data point to a novel aspect of COVID-19 pathogenesis, we would also like to
mention a few limitations of our study. GI biopsies were not performed on a representative subset
of the Discovery or Validation Cohorts, but rather from a distinct set of patients who were
undergoing clinical indicated procedures. In addition, we recognize our analysis on intestinal
mucosal samples were not performed during the most acute phase of the illness in some patients.
A separate study by our group that analyzed stool samples from patients going through the acute
phase of COVID-19, found little evidence of an active gut inflammatory response. In particular,
such stool samples strikingly lacked any significant increase of IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a and IL-10,
despite the detection of viral genomes (MEDRXIV/2020/183947). Finally, in our clinical
outcomes analysis we acknowledge that the reporting GI symptoms can be subject to individual
variation and the clinical documentation might vary depending on providers and on the acuity of
the patients’ presentation. While it is possible that GI symptoms might have been underreported
in patients who were admitted directly to the ICU, our findings are in line with those observed in
the External Validation Cohort where patients who died or were admitted to the ICU within 24
hours form initial presentation were excluded from the analysis.
In summary, we have observed an unexpected but significant reduction in COVID-19
severity and mortality when patients demonstrate GI symptoms like diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.
These data suggest a previously unappreciated tissue-specific response to SARS-CoV-2 and
provide the rationale for more studies aimed at determining the mechanisms underpinning the
attenuation of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity by the intestinal environment. Such efforts may lead to
the development of novel treatments against COVID-19 and potentially other similar deadly
infections in the future.

Materials and Methods
Clinical cohorts
1. Intestinal Biopsy Cohort
Intestinal biopsies and peripheral blood from 18 COVID-19 and 10 control patients were obtained
between April 17, 2020 and June 2, 2020. Subjects included hospitalized patients as well as those
seen in the outpatient GI practices. COVID-19 cases and controls were defined on the basis of
nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 swab PCR tests. The demographic characteristics of these patients
and controls are provided in Fig. 1A, Table 1, and table S1. Informed consent was obtained from
all patients. The biopsy-related studies were approved by the Mount Sinai Ethics Committee/IRB
(IRB 16-0583, The impact of viral infections and their treatment on gastrointestinal immune cells).
COVID-19 severity was defined based on internal scoring system developed by the Department
of Infectious Diseases at Mount Sinai Hospital. This scoring system was developed according to

2. Discovery Cohort
Patients admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) between April 1, 2020 and April 15, 2020 were
recruited into the Discovery Cohort if they were SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive, more than 18 years
of age and if the “ELLA panel of cytokines” (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1b and TNF-a) was performed as part
of clinical care. Clinical details from eligible patients were extracted from Mount Sinai Data
Warehouse (MSDW) under an IRB approved protocol (IRB-20-03297A North American registry
of the digestive manifestations of COVID-19).
A total of 634 subjects were included in the Discovery Cohort (fig. S11). In addition to
demographic information (including race and ethnicity and primary language), clinical
characteristics, laboratory data and outcomes data was extracted from the medical charts. Covariates that were studied included: history of smoking, BMI (obesity defined as BMI >30) and
comorbid conditions including, hypertension, diabetes, chronic lung disease (including asthma and
COPD), heart disease (including coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation and heart failure),
chronic kidney disease, cancer, HIV, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
GI symptoms were defined as more than one episode of either diarrhea, nausea, and/or
vomiting at the time of admission. If only one episode of either diarrhea, nausea, and/or vomiting
was specifically documented, patients were not considered to have GI symptoms. Additionally,
we did not consider GI symptoms that developed during the course of hospitalization, as they could
reflect nosocomial or treatment-related effects and only considered the GI symptoms that were
present at the time of hospital admission so as to avoid including iatrogenic confounders
(treatments or hospital acquired illnesses that can result in diarrhea, nausea and vomiting).

Disease severity (as described above) and mortality were considered as outcomes variables.
Mortality was calculated as patient status (dead or alive) at 25 days post admission. If no
information was available after discharge, patients were censored at the time of hospital discharge.
3. External Validation Cohort
To confirm the Discovery Cohort findings, we analyzed a cohort of patients admitted to a tertiary
care center in Milan, Italy between February 22, 2020 and March 30, 2020. A total of 287 patients
with a confirmed positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR and who did not die or were not transferred to the
ICU within 24 hours from admission were studied. Presence of vomiting and diarrhea (defined as
at least three loose bowel movement per day) on or prior to admission was recorded. Outcomes
were analyzed using ICU admission, death or the composite study end-point of ICU admission or
death within 20 days of hospitalization.
4. Internal Validation Cohort
To test a predictive model of COVID-19 severity and disease-related mortality, we developed a
distinct ‘Internal Validation Cohort’ of patients who were hospitalized at MSH between April 16,
2020 and April 30, 2020 and satisfied the same inclusion and exclusion criteria as in the Discovery
Cohort. Additionally, patients already included in the Discovery Cohort were excluded. From a
total of 408 patients, 242 met inclusion criteria and were thus included in the Internal Validation
Cohort. Demographic, clinical and outcomes related data was extracted from patients’ medical
records as described for the Discovery Cohort.

SARS-CoV-2 testing
The SARS-CoV-2 PCR was run in the Clinical Microbiology laboratory as part of routine care on
the Roche cobas platform. This platform performs selective amplification of 2 targets ORF-1 gene

(Target 1) and the E-gene for pan-Sarbecovirus (Target 2) (detects SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS
or MERS viruses, but not routine seasonal Coronavirus). A positive result indicated that either
both Target 1 and Target 2 were detected (majority of cases) or Target 1 alone was detected. A
presumptive positive result indicates a negative Target 1 result and a positive Target 2 result which
according to the manufacture can be a result of the following: “1) a sample at concentrations near
or below the limit of detection of the test, 2) a mutation in the Target 1 target region in the oligo
binding sites, or 3) infection with some other Sarbecovirus (e.g., SARS-CoV or some other
Sarbecovirus previously unknown to infect humans), or 4) other factors." Patients with a
presumptive positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR were included in the analysis if they were treated
clinically as having COVID-19.

Immunofluorescent (IF) microscopy
Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue acquired during routine clinical care was obtained from
the pathology core at our institution. Sections (5µm) were dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated in
graded alcohol and then washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Heat-induced epitope
retrieval was performed by incubating slides in a pressure cooker for 15 minutes on high in target
retrieval solution (Dako, S1699). Slides were then left to cool in the solution at room temperature
for 30 minutes. Slides were washed twice in PBS and then permeabilized for 30 minutes in 0.1%
tritonX-100 in PBS. Non-specific binding was blocked with 10% goat serum for 1 hour at room
temperature. Sections were then incubated in primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution
overnight at 4°C. Primary and secondary antibodies are summarized in table S15. Slides were
washed in PBST (0.1% tween 20, PBS) thrice and then incubated in secondary antibody and 4′,6-

diamidino-2-phenylindole (1µg/mL) for 1 hour at room temperature. Sections were washed twice
in PBST and once in PBS then mounted with Fluoromount-G (Electron microscopy sciences,
1798425). Controls included, omitting primary antibody (no primary control), or substituting
primary antibodies with non-reactive antibodies of the same isotype (isotype control). Tissue was
visualized and imaged using a Nikon Eclipse Ni microscope and digital SLR camera (Nikon, DSQi2).

Electron Microscopy (EM)
Biopsy specimens for electron microscopy were placed in 3% buffered glutaraldehyde. Following
post-fixation in 1% osmium tetroxide, tissues were serially dehydrated and embedded in epoxy
resin in standard fashion. One-micron toluidine-stained scout sections were prepared for light
microscopic orientation; 80nm ultrathin sections for EM were stained with uranyl acetate and lead
citrate and examined in a Hitachi 7650 transmission electron microscope at 80kV.

Biopsy collection and processing for Mass cytometry (CyTOF)
Endoscopic biopsies were obtained from COVID-19 patients and controls during clinically
indicated endoscopic procedures. The biopsies were processed in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility
within 2 hours of collection.
Briefly, biopsies were transferred to 10 ml of ‘dissociation buffer’ (1M HEPES(Lonza),
5µM EDTA(Invitrogen), 10% FBS in HBSS buffer (Gibco). The tubes were kept in a shaker (180
rpm, 37°C) for 20 min and then gently vortexed. Cell suspensions were collected after passing the
biopsies through 100µm cell strainers. A second round of EDTA dissociation was performed as
detailed above. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 1800 rpm to pellet the epithelial fraction

and kept on ice. The remaining tissue was transferred to fresh tubes containing a ‘digestion buffer’
(2% FBS, 0.005g Collagenase type IV per sample (Sigma), 100 µl DNAse-I (Sigma) in RPMI).
Tubes were placed in the shaker (180 rpm, 37°C) for 40 min and thereafter gently vortexed. The
digested tissues were filtered through 100 µm cell strainers followed by another round of filtration
through 40µm cell strainers. Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 1800 rpm to obtain lamina
propria mononuclear cells. Both epithelial cell (EC) and lamina propria (LP) pellets were then
resuspended into 500 µl of RPMI (Gibco) containing 10% FBS+ 1µl Rh103 +1µl IdU and
incubated at 37°C for 20 min. 5 ml RPMI (+10%FBS) was added to each tube and spun at 1800
rpm to pellet cells. 700 µl of Prot1 stabilizer (SmartTube Inc.) was added to each tube and
transferred to cryovials and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Cryovials were immediately
transferred to -80°C until the sample was acquired for mass cytometry as detailed below.

Blood collection and processing for CyTOF
Phlebotomy was performed on COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 controls at the time of
endoscopic evaluation. All the blood samples from COVID-19 patients were processed in
enhanced BSL2 conditions as per institutional guidelines. Briefly, 15ml of LymphosepÒ Lymphocyte Separation Medium (MP Bio.) was added to each 50 ml centrifugation tube. Blood
was diluted with PBS to bring the volume up to 30ml and diluted blood was layered gently over
LymphosepÒ. Tubes were then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 mins with the brakes and
acceleration off. After centrifugation, the buffy coat containing PBMCs was transferred to another
tube and was centrifuged at 1800 rpm to pellet the cells. Pellets were resuspended in PBS and
tubes were centrifuged at 1800 rpm. Finally, the pellets were resuspended in the freezing medium
(10% DMSO + 44% FBS in RPMI) and cryopreserved at -80 °C.

CyTOF processing and data acquisition
Cells were processed as previously described by Geanon et al.(86). Briefly, EC and LP SmartTube
proteomic stabilized samples were thawed in a 10°C water bath and washed with Cell Staining
Buffer (Fluidigm). To facilitate data acquisition and doublet removal, multiple samples were also
barcoded using Fluidigm Pd barcoding kits and then washed and pooled for data acquisition.
Immediately prior to data acquisition, samples were washed with Cell Staining Buffer and Cell
Acquisition Solution (Fluidigm) and resuspended at a concentration of 1 million cells per ml in
Cell Acquisition Solution containing a 1:20 dilution of EQ Normalization beads (Fluidigm). The
samples were then acquired on a Helios Mass Cytometer equipped with a wide-bore sample
injector at an event rate of <400 events per second. After acquisition, repeat acquisitions of the
same sample concatenated and normalized using the Fluidigm software, and barcoded samples
were de-multiplexed using the Zunder single cell debarcoder.

CyTOF Data analysis
De-barcoded files were uploaded to Cytobank for analyses. Immune cells were identified based on
Ir-193 DNA intensity and CD45 expression; Ce140+ normalization beads, CD45-low/Ir-193-low
debris and cross-sample and Gaussian ion-cloud multiplets were excluded from subsequent
downstream analysis. Major immune cell types were identified using automated Astrolabe
approach, the result of which largely correlated well with our manual gating approaches. The
impact of each tested condition on relative staining quality was evaluated in two ways: 1) overall
correlations were determined by calculating the Pearson’s correlation coefficients for the median
expression of each marker across each defined immune subset; and 2) a staining index was

calculated using defined populations showing the highest and lowest expression levels of each
marker: SI = (Medianpos - Medianneg) / 2 X Std.Devneg. It is already been described that
SmartTube-based fixation protocols take into account previously described mass cytometry
artifacts such as cell-cell multiplets, isotopic spillover or oxidation, or mass cytometer instrument
configuration(86).

Statistical Analysis for CyTOF
Pre-gated viable CD45+ cells were first clustered and annotated using the Astrolabe Cytometry
Platform (Astrolabe Diagnostics, Inc.), which involves using a hierarchy-based FlowSOM
algorithm for labeling cell populations in individual samples. These Astrolabe Profiling clusters
from each tissue type were then meta-clustered across all samples utilizing Clustergrammer2's
interactive heatmap as a method to interrogate antibody expression across every cluster and curate
and assign cell population categories. Single sample clusters were also visualized using UMAP.
Pairwise comparisons were performed on the frequencies of each identified cell population
between the patient cohorts (COVID-19 vs. control, COVID-19 severe vs. control, COVID19asymptomatic/mild/moderate vs. control) to determine fold change, p-values and FDR adjusted pvalues using the Benjamini-Hochberg(87) method to account for multiple comparisons.

Cell Culture Experiments and Virus Isolation
African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (Vero E6) were originally purchased from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium
(DMEM) w/ L-glutamate, sodium pyruvate (Corning) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum

(FBS), 100 U penicillin/ml, and 100 mg streptomycin/ml. For all experiments, the cells were
always maintained in monolayers.
Several attempts were made to isolate live infectious particles from these biopsies. Briefly,
biopsies were collected and stored in PBS until homogenization. Following homogenization and
centrifugation (10,000 × g, 20 min, 4°C), the resulting supernatant tissue supernatant was
inoculated onto Vero E6 monolayer maintained in optimal virus growth media for SARS-CoV-2
virus (DMEM w/ L-Glutamate, Sodium Pyruvate, 2% FBS, 100 U Penicillin/ml, and 100 mg
Streptomycin/ml, 10 mM Non-Essential Amino Acids, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate and 10 mM
HEPES). Vero E6 cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for a week and monitored daily for
potential cytopathic effect (CPE).
Cell culture supernatants were also collected and assessed for the presence of infective
particles by plaque assay. Briefly, ten-fold serial dilutions were performed in infection media for
SARS-CoV-2 and inoculated onto confluent Vero E6 cell monolayer in 6-well plate. After onehour adsorption, supernatants were removed, and cells monolayers were overlaid with minimum
essential media (MEM) containing 2% FBS and purified agar (OXOID) at a final concentration of
0.7%. Cells were then incubated for 3 days at 37°C. Cells were fixed overnight with 10%
formaldehyde for the inactivation of potential SARS-CoV-2 virus. Overlay was removed and cells
were washed once with PBS. A 2% crystal violet solution was used for plaque visualization and
count. Experiments were performed under BSL3 conditions.

Specimen Processing for Nucleic Acid Extraction
Whole biopsy tissues from COVID-19 patients and non COVID controls were directly
homogenized in Trizol (Invitrogen) and used to detect the presence of viral RNA. Total RNA was

extracted using Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Plus (Zymo) kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. In parallel, RNA isolated from both the intestinal compartments, EC and LP cellular
fractions, were used for transcriptomics analyses.

RT-qPCR for Viral Determination
RNA was retro-transcribed using the enzyme Maxima First Strand cDNA (Thermofisher), and
PCR reaction was performed using the TaqMan™ Universal PCR Master Mix (Thermofisher). For
detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, we used the following primers and probe targeting the N gene:
N1- SARS-CoV2-F5’GACCCCAAAATCAGCGAAAT;
N1-SARS-CoV2-R5’TCTGGTTACTGCCAGTTGAATCTG;
N1-SARS-CoV2-P

FAM5’

ACCCCGCATTACGTTTGGTGGACC-BHQ-1

(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/rt-pcr-panel-primer-probes.html)
Another set of primers was included to detect host 18S and GAPDH. Limit of detection and
amplification efficiency were calculated before GI tissue quantification for N1 (173%; R2>0.94)
primers using plasmids expressing the NP protein (2019-nCoV_N_Positive Control, IDT, cat.
10006625). RNA from GI tissues were run in triplicates in 384-well plates using the following
cycling conditions on the Roche LightCycler 480 Instrument II (Roche Molecular Systems,
05015243001): 50°C for 2 min; 95°C for 10 min; 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 1 min.
Samples below the limit of detection (Ct≥34 corresponding to 100 genome copies/reaction) were
considered negative. Primers and probes for housekeeping genes GAPDH (assay ID
Hs02758991_g1 FAM) and 18S (assay ID Hs03928990_g1 FAM) were obtained from
Thermofisher Scientific).

RNA Sequencing
Library preparation and sequencing
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on RNA isolated from the EC and LP samples
obtained from COVID-19 cases and controls. Directional RNA-seq libraries were prepared from
50 ng of total RNA with the TruSeq® Stranded Total RNA prep with Ribo-Zero kit (Cat no.
20020599). Paired-end (100 bp) sequencing was performed for DNA libraries on an Illumina
NovaSeq instrument on a NovaSeq S1 Flowcell, with an average yield of 39 million PE
reads/sample.

RNA-seq analysis
Base-calling and quality scoring of sequencing data were done through Illumina’s Real-Time
Analysis (RTA) software. RNA-seq data processing and reference mapping were done with
custom analysis scripts combining publicly available tools as previously described(88) with
modifications as follows, reads were mapped to a custom reference that combined the human hg38
reference genome (Release 34, GRCh38.p13) and the SARS-CoV-2 genome (RefSeq NC_045512)
for simultaneous quantification of host and virus transcripts.
Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis was performed with the Bioconductor edgeR
package (89) using as input a combined matrix of mapped paired-end read raw counts, with genes
in rows and samples in columns. Prior to DGE analysis, gene counts were converted to fragments
per kb per million reads (FPKM) with the RSEM package with default settings in strand-specific
mode(90).
Genes with less than 1 FPKM in at least 50% of the samples were removed. The remaining
gene counts were then normalized across samples using the weighted trimmed mean of M-values

(TMM) method(91). The dispersion was estimated by fitting a generalized linear model (GLM) as
implemented in edgeR, sex was fitted as a covariate on a per-patient paired design. Pairwise
comparisons were performed between sample groups (i.e., between tissue sections, and between
cases and controls). Significant expression differences were selected based on eBayes adjusted p
values corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (q ≤ 0.05).

Gene Ontology and Pathway Enrichment Analysis
KEGG pathway and gene ontology (GO) biological process (BP), molecular function (MF), and/or
cellular component (CC) enrichment analyses were performed using the gProfileR R v0.6.8
package(92). The background gene set was restricted genes with detected expression (defined as
genes with expression levels above 1 FPKM in at least 50% of samples). Genes with differential
expression were ranked by log 2 fold change and used as an ordered query. P values were corrected
using the g:SCS algorithm to account for multiple comparisons.

Cell-type deconvolution and gene signature enrichment analysis
For cell-type deconvolution of the bulk RNA-seq data, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of
differentially expressed genes of cases vs controls comparisons was performed against cell type
gene-expression single-cell signatures from intestinal mucosa(44) and gene-expression signatures
from ileal dendritic cell (DCs) subsets (43). Similarly, differentially expressed genes were tested
for enrichment of gene signatures associated with an antiviral response, inflammation, and
cytokine signaling in acutely infected post-mortem tissue with SARS-CoV-2(30) , were tested for
significant (p ≤ 0.05) enrichment using Fisher’s exact tests and using Bonferroni correction for
multiple comparisons.

Additionally, GSEA(93) was carried out on a rank ordered list of the infected EC versus
control molecular analysis. The ranking metric used was logFC * -logP value, however, the results
were similar when logFC metric was also used (data not shown). For the COVID-19 associated
datasets, we curated two signatures from infected organoids(40): hSIOs-COVID-19: human small
intestinal organoids (hSIOs) grown in either i) Wnt high expansion (EXP) medium (at adjP<0.05)
or ii) differentiation (DIF) medium (at adjP<0.1). The standard GSEA settings were used, namely
‘meandiv’ for normalization mode, ‘weighted’ enrichment statistic, and ‘1000’ permutations.
GSEA using the Hallmark database (v7.1, (94)) was also performed with the same settings.

Computational analyses
Descriptive statistics
Basic demographics and clinical characteristics of the cohort were defined by descriptive statistics.
For univariable statistical analyses, graph pad prism (version 8) was used. For age, an unpaired
two tailed t-test was performed. For categorical variables, the Fisher’s exact test or the Chi-square
test was used as appropriate.
Multivariate model based on Discovery Cohort
For this analysis, we considered 570 patients with clinical descriptors including as age, gender,
race, BMI, comorbidities and GI symptoms. A multivariate logistic regression was utilized to
model severity and mortality as function of each of the GI symptoms and clinical variables
including race, age, gender, BMI, heart and lung diseases and hypertension. In particular, race was
stratified as White (Caucasian), Black (African-American), Hispanic and others; lung disease was
set equal to 1 if the patient was either affected by COPD or asthma and zero otherwise; heart

disease was set equal to 1 if the patient was either affected by coronary artery disease, atrial
fibrillation or heart failure and 0 otherwise. The severity indicator was set equal to 1 for severe
and severe with EOD patients and 0 for Mild and Moderate COVID patients; mortality was set
equal to 1 for deceased patients and 0 otherwise. Significant association based on 95% confidence
interval (CI) are reported in table S9. CI of odds ratio were computed based on 1000 bootstrap
iterations. At each bootstrap iteration, patients were sampled with replacements and logistic
regressions were estimated considering as outcome severity and mortality. Then, 95% CI of
coefficients and odds ratio were estimated across bootstrap iterations (Fig. 5B).
External Validation Cohort
For this analysis, we considered 228 patients with clinical data such as age, gender and GI
symptoms as described in Aghemo et al.(95). A multivariate logistic regression was utilized to
model mortality, ICU admission and the composite outcome of ICU admission or mortality as
function of presence or absence of diarrhea and clinical variables including age, gender, BMI,
heart disease, COPD, diabetes and hypertension. Heart disease was set equal to 1 if the patient was
either affected by coronary artery disease or atrial fibrillation and 0 otherwise. Confidence
intervals of odds ratio were computed based on 1000 bootstrap iterations. At each bootstrap
iteration, patients were sampled with replacements and logistic regressions were estimated
considering the outcome as mortality, ICU admission or the composite outcome of ICU admission
or death. Then, 95% confidence intervals of odds ratio were estimated across bootstrap iterations
(Fig. 5C).

Predictive performance based on the Internal Validation Cohort

For this analysis, we considered 233 patients with clinical data including age, BMI, and GI
symptoms. In order to evaluate the predictive performance of each model, bootstrapping was
performed. Specifically, at each bootstrap iteration, we randomly sampled patients in the
Discovery Cohort with replacement and estimated a logistic regression to model each outcome as
function of a particular GI symptom, age and BMI. In this analysis, only age and BMI were
adjusted for since they were the only variables significantly associated with both outcomes across
different GI symptoms models in the Discovery Cohort (Fig. 5B). Then, the estimated model was
utilized to predict the outcome of patients in the Internal Validation Cohort. This procedure was
repeated for 1000 bootstrap iterations. For each iteration, Receiving Operating Characteristic
(ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) were computed. For comparison purposes, the
distribution of AUC across 1000 bootstrap iterations from the predictive model based on age and
BMI only was considered. Fig. 5D shows the boxplot of AUC values across 1000 bootstrap
iterations. Then, considering the following model
outcome = f(age + bmi + any GI symptom) [Model 1]
we evaluated the effect of each variable on the outcome by computing the reduction in AUC
obtained after removing one variable at a time. For this purpose, the AUC of model [Model 1] was
compared to the following three models
outcome = f(age + bmi) [Model 2]
outcome = f(age + any GI symptom)[Model 3]
outcome = f(bmi + any GI symptom)[Model 4]
for 1000 bootstrap iterations. Following the strategy above, at each bootstrap iteration, patients
were sampled with replacement. Fig. 5E shows the 95% confidence intervals of difference in AUC
between [Model 1] and [Model 2], [Model 3] and [Model 4] (i.e., AUCModel1 - AUCModel2,

AUCModel1 - AUCModel3, AUCModel1 - AUCModel4) across 1000 bootstrap iterations. The
difference in AUC was computed considering both mortality and severity as the outcome.

Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal viral loads
SARS-CoV-2 viral loads were determined as detailed in Pujadas et al(53). Briefly, viral RNA was
extracted from the nasopharyngeal swab specimen followed by real time RT-PCR using N2
primers. Only specimens with N2Cpt < 38 were included. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was calculated
with the delta CT method and a standard curve. Viral loads are presented as log base 10
transformed uncorrected N2 value + 1000 (constant added before transformation)(53). For patients
with multiple NP swabs available, the first swab was used for analysis.

ELLA Cytokine panel
The ELLA platform is a method for rapid cytokine measurement using microfluidics ELISA
assays. The assay measured TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1β, previously validated by the Mount Sinai
Human Immune Monitoring Center (HIMC) using plasma from multiple myeloma patients and
recently reported for large cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital(35).

Multiplexed proteomic assay (Olink)
For analysis of circulating cytokines, we used a multiplexed proteomic inflammation panel
(Olink), which consists of 92 inflammation-related proteins quantified by an antibody-mediated
proximity extension-based assay(79). Samples with normalized protein expression values below
the limit-of-detection in >75% of samples were excluded from further analysis. For the remainder
of analytes, any sample under the limit of detection was assigned a value of the limit-of-detection

divided by the square root of 2. The log2 fold-change over the median healthy control protein
expression was then calculated, and the Benjamini-Hochberg(80) procedure was used to adjust P
values for multiple testing.

Consensus Clustering of Olink Data
For this analysis, we considered 238 samples with GI symptoms annotation. Consensus clustering
was performed based on the abundance of 92 cytokines across all 238 samples. Consensus
clustering was performed using the R packages ConsensusClusterPlus(81) based on z-score
normalized data. Specifically, markers were partitioned into six clusters using the Kaplan Meier
(KM) algorithm, which was repeated 1000 times. Then, markers in each cluster were considered
in order to derive cluster z-score signatures via package GSVA(82). Based on these signatures, the
association between different clusters and GI symptoms were derived via logistic regression with
outcome corresponding to each GI symptom. Fig. 6C shows the signed FDR (-log10 scale). Pvalues were adjusted via Benjamini-Hochberg(80).

Defining associations between GI symptoms and Olink protein markers
Associations between GI symptoms and Olink proteomic data were derived using unpaired t-test
comparing the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. P-values were adjusted via BenjaminiHochberg(80). Only associations passing a 10% FDR were reported as significant (Fig. 6D).

Unpaired two-tailed t-tests were used to compare individual cytokines quantified by the ELLA
panel between GI symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. P-values were adjusted via BenjaminiHochberg(80).

Fig. 5 COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms had reduced severity and mortality despite
similar nasopharyngeal viral loads compared to those without GI symptoms. (A) KaplanMeier (KM) curves for survival stratified by any GI Symptoms (left panel) and diarrhea (right
panel) for patients in the Discovery Cohort. P-values from log-rank test and 95% confidence
intervals of KM curves are shown. Below each KM curve, the number of patients at risk are
reported for the respective time points. (B) Confidence intervals of odds ratio (95%) of GI
symptoms based on 1000 bootstrap iterations in a multivariate logistic regression for severity
(blue) and mortality (red). (C) Validation based on the External Cohort. Confidence intervals of
odds ratio (95%) of diarrhea covariate based on 1000 bootstrap iterations to capture mortality, ICU
admission and composite outcome of ICU admission or death. Results are based on multivariate
models after accounting for confounders such as BMI, age, gender, lung disease, heart disease and
hypertension. (D) Validation based on the Internal Cohort. Boxplot of AUC over 1000 bootstrap
iterations to predict mortality and disease severity in the Validation Cohort. (E) Confidence
intervals of the reduction in AUC (95%) based on 1000 bootstrap iterations for the model “Age +
BMI + Any GI Symptoms” after removing age (blue), GI symptoms (red) and BMI (green). (F)
SARS-CoV-2 viral load copies per mL (log10 transformed based on N2 primer with the addition
of a constant) stratified by GI symptoms. The box plot represents median and interquartile range.
P-values from two-tailed unpaired t-tests are reported.

Fig. 6 COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms have reduced levels of circulating inflammatory
cytokines. (A) Correlation matrix (Pearson’s) for 92 markers contained in multiplexed proteomic
platform (O-link) across patients with any GI symptoms (top left panel) compared with no GI
symptoms (top right panel) and patients with diarrhea (bottom left panel) compared with patients
without diarrhea (bottom right panel). Cluster assignment derived based on consensus clustering
is reported on the top of the heatmap. (B) Boxplot of “Hallmark Inflammatory Response” and
“KEGG JAK/STAT Signaling pathway” z-scores stratified by GI symptoms. P-values from
unpaired t-test are reported. “Hallmark Immune Response” and “Hallmark JAK/STAT Signaling”
pathways were found significantly enriched at 10% FDR in Cluster 4 and Cluster 5, respectively.
(C) Association between proteomic clusters and GI symptoms, which was derived by comparing
cluster signatures between asymptomatic and symptomatic groups via unpaired two-tailed t-test.
Associations significant at 10% (dark blue) and 15% (light blue) FDR are reported. (D) Analytes
associated with GI symptoms at 10% FDR based on unpaired t-test. The intensity of the color is
proportional to the -log10 p-value. Negative associations are displayed in blue; while positive
associations in red. On the right side of the heatmap, the cluster assignment for each marker is
reported. (E) Boxplots represent median and interquartile range of select differentially expressed
markers stratified by GI symptoms. P-values from unpaired t-test are reported.
