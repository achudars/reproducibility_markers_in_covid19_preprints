ARTICLE HISTORY
Compiled July 1, 2020
ABSTRACT
Since February 2020, COVID-19 has spread rapidly to more than 200 countries in
the world. During the pandemic, local governments in China have implemented different interventions to efficiently control the spread of the epidemic. Characterizing
transmission of COVID-19 under some typical interventions is essential to help countries develop appropriate interventions. Based on the pre-symptomatic transmission
patterns of COVID-19, we established a novel compartmental model: Baysian SIHR
model with latent Markov structure, which treated the numbers of infected and
infectious individuals without isolation to be the latent variables and allowed the
effective reproduction number to change over time, thus the effects of policies could
be reasonably estimated. By using the epidemic data of Wuhan, Wenzhou and Shenzhen, we migrated the corresponding estimated policy modes to South Korea, Italy,
and the United States and simulated the potential outcomes for these countries when
they adopted similar policy strategies of three cities in China. We found that the
mild interventions implemented in Shenzhen were effective to control the epidemic
in the early stage, while more stringent policies which were issued in Wuhan and
Wenzhou were necessary if the epidemic was more severe and needed to be controlled
in a short time.

1. Introduction
Since December 2019, the report of COVID-19 detected was sent to the World Health
Organization (WHO) by Chinese government [25]. China issued a series of intervention
policies to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as suspending public transportations in areas of severe outbreak (e.g. Wuhan), cancelling public gatherings and
delaying reopening of enterprises. These endeavours have led to the significant suppression of the epidemic of COVID-19. There was no domestically newly reported

confirmed cases for the first time in China on March 18, 2020 [27]. The local and national responses of China have made remarkable contributions to the prevention and
control of COVID-19.
In this article, we selected Wuhan, Wenzhou and Shenzhen cities as the typical representatives of the policy interventions of China. Wuhan was the most severe epidemic
city of COVID-19 outbreak in China. It suspended public transportation, cancelled all
outbound trains and flights[23] and started to construct a specialist emergency hospital (i.e. Huoshenshan Hospital) for patients on January 23, 2020. Wenzhou was the city
with the largest number of cumulative confirmed cases in Zhejiang province and implemented comparatively stringent policy interventions for the control of COVID-19.
It announced that every household might send one person every two days outside for
necessity purchases[24]. Shenzhen was the city of the confirmed cases initially reported in Guangdong province, the intervention policy was relatively moderate due to its
special economic status in China. It announced that all the individuals returning from
Hubei needed to be isolated at home or other suitable facilities for 14 days on February
2, 2020[21], and the residential units with confirmed cases were forced to implement “hard quarantine” for 14 days. All details about the interventions implemented in
these cities were given in Figure 1.
Nevertheless, these policy interventions were implemented at the expense of the
economic loss. Taking individual consumption industry as an example, the amount
of total retail sales of consumer goods decreased by about 20.5% with a sharp drop
of catering services by 43.1% from January to February 2020 compared to the same
duration of 2019 according to the National Bureau of Statistics in China [17]. Consequently, policymakers needed to anticipate the likely outcomes of interventions in
terms of their own epidemic situations.
The epidemic has rapidly spread to more than 200 countries around the world. WHO
declared that COVID-19 became a pandemic on March 11, 2020 [26]. As an epitome
of the pandemic, the numbers of cumulative confirmed cases and deaths on May 31,
2020 were 11468 and 270 in South Korea, 232664 and 33340 in Italy, and 1819788 and
105634 in the United States, respectively[1]. Some details about the spread of COVID19 in South Korea, Italy and the United States are given in COVID-19 prevalence
in Supplemental material. In this situation, the control measures of China, which
have significantly suppressed the spread of COVID-19, are worth learning for other
countries confronting with coronavirus. Therefore, it would be instructive to simulate
the potential outcomes for other countries when they adopted similar policy strategies
of China.
In order to simulate the likely outcomes under different policy patterns of China
for other countries reasonably, an epidemic model reflecting the nature of COVID19 and the effects of policy interventions is needed. Based on the report of WHO[9],
the transmission of COVID-19 could be caused by the individuals infected with the
virus before significant symptoms developed. Because of the lacking assumption of
incubation period, traditional compartmental model, such as SIR model[5, 7], were
inappropriate to be used in the evaluation of the spread of COVID-19. Moreover,
although the typical SEIR model [14, 15] took the effects of incubation period into
account, it needed some modifications of the delay effects [12, 28] for considering
pre-symptomatic transmission of COVID-19, which was subjective and indirect for
reflecting the transmission patterns of COVID-19.
In this paper, we proposed a novel compartmental epidemic model based on PSIHR Probabilistic Graphical Model[22]: Bayesian SIHR model, which considers presymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 by an appropriate compartmental assumption

with the well-defined time-varying reproduction number. In Bayesian SIHR model, the
numbers of infected and infectious individuals without isolation are the key ingredients
for the evaluation of the spread, which are assumed to be latent variables correlated
with numbers of compartments at different time by a latent Markov structure. We
used the estimated time-varying reproduction number[11, 20] to reflect the effects of
interventions implemented in Wuhan, Wenzhou, and Shenzhen, and then migrated the
corresponding policy patterns by parameters transition to simulate the likely outcomes
of these interventions in South Korea, Italy and the United States, so that the lessons
can be learned from the key decisions made in the representative cities.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the construction of our proposed model, describe the parameter estimation procedure in details
and further show the mode migration approaches in policy pattern assessment. In Section 3, we present the simulation study for the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea,
Italy and the United States under different interventions of China by the proposed
model. Finally, we end up with conclusions in Section 4.

2. Epidemic Modelling
2.1. Data sources
The epidemic data were extracted for Wuhan, Wenzhou, and Shenzhen from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) [18], we used the reported numbers of cumulative confirmed cases, cumulative recovery cases and total
deaths from January 15 to February 12 in Wuhan, from January 21 to February 9
in Wenzhou and from January 19 to February 6 in Shenzhen. Similarly, the reported
numbers of cumulative confirmed cases, cumulative recovery cases and total deaths
for South Korea, Italy and the United States were downloaded through April 23, 2020
from “nCov2019” package [1].
2.2. Bayesian SIHR model
To understand the pre-symptomatic transmission patterns of COVID-19, we introduced Susceptible-Infected and infectious without isolation-Hospitalized in isolationRemoved (SIHR) model with four compartments: Susceptible (S), infected and infectious without isolation (I), hospitalized in isolation (H), removed (R) and assumed
that:
(1) The susceptible (S) individuals have no immunity to the disease;
(2) The infected and infectious individuals without isolation (I) were assumed to be
infectious, transmissible and would transform into the hospitalized in isolation
eventually after symptoms onset;
(3) The hospitalized (H) individuals were in isolation and treated carefully and
would not transmit COVID-19 to the susceptible;
(4) The removed (R) individuals would not be infected again.
Based on the above assumptions, the transfer relationships between compartments
S, I, H, R were given in Figure 2:

Figure 2. The diagram of transfer process of four compartments. Susceptible (S), infected and infectious
without isolation (I), hospitalized in isolation (H), and removed (R).

Notice that an increase in the number of infected individuals only happens through
the contact between S and I, similar to SIR model [5, 7], we can define the corresponding dynamic system of these four compartments as follows:
S(t)

I(t) − βI(t),

dt
dR

dt

(1)

where (S(t), I(t), H(t), R(t)) are the numbers of corresponding compartments at
time t. Conatct rate α denotes the average contact numbers per person during the
outbreak of infectious disease, 1/β, 1/γ are the average lengths of retention time of a
person for compartments I and H, respectively, where 1/β is the mean of the length
of incubation period of COVID-19, and is assumed to be 5 days in terms of studies
about COVID-19 [3, 10, 16].
The basic reproduction number R0 , which is the expected number of secondary
cases produced by a single (typical) infection in a completely susceptible population,
is defined as the spectral radius of the next generation operator [11, 20] of SIHR model:

R0 = α/β.
Taking policy interventions into consideration, it’s more reasonable to assume the
time-varying transmission patterns in SIHR model, which can be achieved by the
assumption of time-varying reproduction number Rt [8].
To obtain Rt , we supposed that the parameter α was time variant and would decrease with the interventions. We used logistic function [22] to simulate the decreasing
trend of α:

While time-varying SIHR model defined above could be effective to consider the
pre-symptomatic transmission patterns of COVID-19 and the effects of policy interventions, in order to fit the observed data appropriately, we introduced randomness to
time-varying SIHR model by the latent Markov structure: let Ω := (α0 , d, m, γ), which
are the parameters needed to be estimated under the given β, and St , It , Ht , Rt be the
random numbers of compartments S, I, H, R at time t. At := (St , It , Ht , Rt ) is assumed
to be a multidimensional Markov process under constraints N = St + It + Ht + Rt ,
i.e. for g < t,

p(At |As≤g ) = p(At |Ag ) = Mult(At ; N, (At (Ag , Ω)/N ),
where At (Ag , Ω) is the vector of the numbers of compartments S, I, H, R at the time
t determined by the deterministic dynamic system (2) given the initial value Ag and
parameters Ω and β. Mult(·; n, p) is the density of Multomial distribution with the
total number n and the incident rate vector p. and .
Notice that the observable data are the numbers of cumulative confirmed cases (ct ),
cuMultative recovery cases (rt ) and total deaths (dt ) at each time t. According to
the definition of compartments R and H, we have Rt = rt + dt and Ht = ct − Rt .
Based upon the above assumptions, the observed data for stochastic time-varying
SIHR model are H1:T , R1:T , N , where T is the observed length of time. We treated
I1:T as the latent variables, then the randomness of St , It , Ht ,and Rt construct a latent
Markov structure for the dynamic process of epidemic.
2.3. The estimation procedure
We employed Bayesian framework [6, 13] for the statistical inference of Ω and I1:T .
Once the prior distribution of Ω: π(Ω) were given, we used the posterior distribution of
Ω and I1:T : π(Ω, I1:T |H1:T , R1:T , N, β) for evaluating the dynamic process of epidemic.
Notice that:

where (S (t) , I (t) , H (t) , R(t) ) := At (As , Ω).
If N → ∞, we can use Poison approximation for the marginal distributions of
It , Ht , Rt , which implies that It ∼ Pois(I (t) ), Ht ∼ Pois(H (t) ), Rt ∼ Pois(R(t) )
and St = N − It − Ht − Rt given As , where Pois(λ) means the Poison distribution with mean λ. We used this approximation for the posterior distribution
π(Ω, I1:T |H1:T , R1:T , N, β). Since π(Ω, I1:T |H1:T , R1:T , N, β) has no closed form, combining with flat prior for Ω, we used Gibbs sampler embedded Metropolis-Hastings
steps [2, 4] to sample π(Ω, I1:T |H1:T , R1:T , N, β), the full conditional distributions of
Ω and It are as follows:

p(Ω|·) ∝

p(IT |·) ∝ Mult(AT ; N, (AT (AT −1 , Ω)/N ).

The technical problem within the iteration of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
is the sampling of latent variables I1:T , which is high dimensional if T is large. For
sampling I1 , note that at the early stage of epidemic, S1 ≈ N , which implies that
I (2) ≈ I1 exp (α − β),
where (I (2) , H (2) , R(2) ) := A2 (A1 , Ω), then the full conditional distribution of I1
approximately achieves:

p(I1 |·) ∝ Mult(A2 ; N, (A1 (A1 , Ω)/N )
≈ Pois(I2 ; I (2) ) · Pois(H2 ; H (2) ) · Pois(R2 ; R(2) )
∝ exp (−I1 exp (α0 − β)) · I1I2 · Pois(H2 ; H (2) ) · Pois(R2 ; R(2) ),
which means that we can use Gamma(I2 + 1, exp (α0 − β)) as the proposal transfer
kernel of I1 for well approximation of p(I1 |·). Given the sample of I1 , there are two
strategies for the sampling of I2:T :
(1) Group sampling: For i in 2 to T , Ii ∼ Pois(I (i) ) given Ω, (Si−1 , Hi−1 , Ri−1 )
and the sample Ii−1 , and then accept the whole I2:T with given probability in
Metropolis-Hastings steps, where (S (i) , I (i) , H (i) , R(i) ) := Ai (Ai−1 , Ω).
(2) Sequential sampling: For i in 2 to T , Ii ∼ Pois(I (i) ) given Ω, (Si−1 , Hi−1 , Ri−1 )
and the accepted sample Ii−1 in (i − 1)-th step, and then accept the Ii with
given probability in Metropolis-Hastings steps, where (S (i) , I (i) , H (i) , R(i) ) :=
Ai (Ai−1 , Ω).
The group sampling of I1:T would be high dimensional and hard to transfer in the
iteration of Metropolis-Hastings step, while the sequential sampling of I1:T would be
less efficient for the convergence of Markov chain [2, 4]. We utilized the mixture of
MCMC kernels [2] to combine these two sampling strategies for the trade-off between
the acceptance rate and the convergence of MCMC.
For the prediction of epidemic, we could use the information of the posterior distribution π(Ω, I1:T |H1:T , R1:T , N, β). In Bayesian framework, since Ω is assumed to be
random, As (T ) := As (AT , Ω) is also random for given AT , s > T . Note that:
π(As (T )|H1:T , R1:T , N, β)
Z
∝ p(As (T ), Ω, I1:T |H1:T , R1:T , N, β) dI1:T dΩ
Z
∝ I(As (T ) = As (AT , Ω)) π(Ω, I1:T |H1:T , R1:T , N, β) dI1:T dΩ,
Hence the posterior distribution of As (T ) exists and could be calculated by
π(Ω, I1:T |H1:T , R1:T , N, β).
We applied π(As (T )|H1:T , R1:T , N, β) for the predicted distributions of As . The
point estimation of parameters Ω, latent variables I1:T and the predicted As , s > T
were presented as the median of the posterior distribution while 95% credible intervals
were constructed with 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles.
2.4. The mode migration
For simulating the epidemic trend of other countries, we applied the Bayesian SIHR
model where Rt is time-invariant, i.e., d and m were chosen as 0 and +∞, respectively,
for South Korea, Italy and the United States.
We used the real-time epidemic data in South Korea, Italy and the United States and
estimated the posterior distributions of parameters, predicted numbers of cumulative
confirmed cases and the missing numbers of infected and infectious individuals without

isolation country by country. And then we migrated the estimated intensity of policy
intervention of Wuhan, Wenzhou, and Shenzhen to South Korea, Italy, and the United
States, i.e. changed the parameters m of South Korea, Italy, and the United States
to the point estimation of m of Wuhan, Wenzhou, and Shenzhen, and simulated the
epidemic trend, respectively. The point estimates were presented as the median of the
posterior distribution while 95% credible intervals were constructed with 2.5% and
97.5% quantiles.

3. Real data analysis of COVID-19
3.1. The estimation of policy patterns in China
To describe the effects of interventions in different cities in China, we used the observed
data of Wuhan, Wenzhou and Shenzhen, to estimate the trends of Rt , which were
shown in Figure 4.
The initial Rt for Wuhan was greater than that for Shenzhen, followed by Wenzhou. While Shenzhen was the city where the reproduction number started to decrease
earliest, followed by Wuhan and Wenzhou. Moreover, the decreasing speed of Rt in
Wenzhou was faster than that in Wuhan, followed by Shenzhen.
In SIHR model, the estimated Rt could reasonably reflect the patterns of policy
interventions. From Figure 4, the different decreasing speeds of Rt implies different intensities of policy interventions. The intensity of policies for Wenzhou was the
strongest, as opposite to be the weakest in Shenzhen of three cities. Comparing with
details in Figure 1, Shenzhen issued relatively mild polices in the early period of outbreak, such as suspending entertainment places and tracking on the close contacts of
confirmed cases, unlike the stringent policy interventions in Wenzhou, such as block
both long-distance and short-distance social contacts. Indeed, mild strategy would
cause less economic damage, oppositely, stringent strategy was used for the quick
control of infectious disease.

3.2. Simulation of the migration of policy patterns
The simulation of COVID-19 trend for constant Rt and time-varying Rt with mode
migration of three policies of China in South Korea, Italy, and the United States are
given as follows (Figures 5-7).
From our simulation, if interventions were not implemented since the starting date of
our extracted data in South Korea, Italy and the United States, the expected cumulative confirmed cases would be 7705971 with corresponding 95% credible intervals (CI)
(2419211,17969284) on March 7 (Figure 5A), 6680363 with 95% CI (442494,35236491)
on March 29 (Figure 6A), and 34179685 with 95% CI (5274919,136469414) on April
17 (Figure 7A), respectively, when the expected cumulative confirmed cases would be
over 10% of the total population in the corresponding country for the first time.
As the estimated number of I was 2639 with corresponding 95% CI (2306,3055) on
February 26 in South Korea, there is not much difference for the expected cumulative
confirmed cases in the simulation of three urban interventions in South Korea (Figure 5B). However, for Italy, there is a substantial difference in the simulation of three
policies implemented (Figure 6B). It may be caused by the large estimated number of
I (25768) on March 28, which implies that it is cautious to carry out a policy at this
stage of epidemic. Similarly, in the United States, there is a considerable difference
from the policy of Shenzhen compared with other two patterns. One reason for this
distinction is that the estimated number of I was 83232 (Figure 7B) on March 29,
which implied certain risks for long-term outbreak of epidemic.

3.3. Discussion
For South Korea, Italy and the United States, if interventions were not implemented,
it can be expected that how tremendously large populations would be infected in
these countries. Thus, the interventions are critical for the control of the fast spread
of infectious disease.
Based upon our simulation, the actual cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19
in South Korea from February 26 to March 9 were within the ranges of expected
cumulative confirmed cases for Shenzhen pattern, whose intensity was relatively mild
compared with both Wuhan and Wenzhou patterns. According to the report [19],
South Korea has implemented similar interventions to Shenzhen pattern, where it
implemented policies closely following and isolating the close contact individuals of
confirmed cases to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. This indicated that the
mitigation policies like Shenzhen pattern, implemented at an early stage of epidemic
could effectively curb the outbreak of infectious diseases.
On the other hand, note that the expected number of cumulative confirmed cases
under the interventions of Wenzhou for Italy would be the smallest. Comparing the
actual situations of Italy, the cumulative confirmed cases were 187,327 on April 23,
2020, which were 28.7% higher than the simulation of COVID-19 under interventions of
Wenzhou. If taking such highly stringent interventions, the epidemic situation could be
mitigated where the expected number of cumulative confirmed cases would be 146,012
on May 31, decreasing by 19% and 32% compared to the implementation of policy of
Wuhan and Shenzhen, respectively. It showed that containment policies like Wenzhou
pattern were effective for quick control of the magnitude of outbreak of infectious
disease.
In the United States, the cumulative confirmed cases were 849094 on April 23,
2020, and were 113.3% more than the simulation of COVID-19 under interventions of
Wenzhou, which implied that the implementations of interventions of Wenzhou may
significantly decrease the magnitude of the outbreak of COVID-19 for the United
States. If taking the relatively mild interventions of Shenzhen, the situation would
get worse and the expected cumulative confirmed cases would be over 1000000 in the
United States on May 31.

4. Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a novel compartmental epidemic model: Bayesian SIHR
model, which took the pre-symptomatic permissibility of COIVD-19 into account and
could estimate the policy patterns according to the real data, and further we can
get reasonable assessments for the corresponding policy patterns through the mode
migration between countries.
As a typical example, we used the epidemic data of three representative cities in
China (Wuhan, Wenzhou and Shenzhen) and migrated the estimated policy modes to
South Korea, Italy and the United States.
Our simulation results indicated that the mild interventions were difficult to control
the magnitude of outbreak of infectious diseases when the number of infected and
infectious without isolation (I) was quite large, but it was effective to implement at
the early stage of epidemic. Once the epidemic became severe, the highly stringent
interventions were needed to be implemented for the control of epidemic. Although

it still takes time to make a reasonable assessment of the patterns and effects of
these policies, the transmission patterns of COVID-19 under some typical intervention
measures could be learned from them.

Comparing three countries, we can find that South Korea had the highest COVID19 cases per 100,000, followed by Italy, and the United States had the lowest from
February 18 to March 9, 2020. On March 10 the COVID-19 cases per 100,000 in Italy
surpassed that in South Korea, rising rapidly. After May, the United States had the
largest COVID-19 cases per 100,000.
