Abstract°

30

Aims: Temperature screening is important in the population during the outbreak of 2019

31

Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). This study aimed to compare the accuracy and precision of

32

wrist and forehead temperature with tympanic temperature under different circumstances.

33

Methods: We performed a prospective observational study in a real-life population. We

34

consecutively collected wrist and forehead temperatures in Celsius (°C) using a non-contact

35

infrared thermometer (NCIT). We also measured the tympanic temperature using a tympanic

36

thermometers (IRTT) and defined fever as a tympanic temperature ≥37.3°C.

37

Results: We enrolled a total of 528 participants including 261 indoor and 267 outdoor

38

participants. We divided outdoor participants into four types according to their means of

39

transportation to the hospital as walk, bicycle, electric vehicle, car, and inside the car. Under

40

different circumstance, the mean difference ranged from -1.72 to -0.56°C in different groups

41

for the forehead measurements, and -0.96 to -0.61°C for the wrist measurements. Both

42

measurements had high fever screening abilities in inpatients (wrist: AUC 0.790; 95% CI:

43

0.725-0.854, P <0.001; forehead: AUC 0.816; 95% CI: 0.757-0.876, P <0.001). The cut-off

44

value of wrist measurement for detecting tympanic temperature ≥37.3°C was 36.2°C with a

45

86.4% sensitivity and a 67.0% specificity, and the best threshold of forehead measurement

46

was also 36.2°C with a 93.2% sensitivity and a 60.0% specificity.

47

Conclusions: Wrist measurement is more stable than forehead measurement under different

48

circumstance. Both measurements have great fever screening abilities for indoor patients. The

49

cut-off value of both measurements was 36.2°C. (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT04274621)

Introduction

52

The outbreaks of 2019 novel coronavirus COVID-19 (previously known as 2019-nCoV)

53

has attracted global attention, due to its strong transmission ability and certain fatality (1, 2).

54

Some studies reported that fever, fatigue and dry cough are common symptoms of

55

COVID-19 patients (3, 4), and 43.8% of the patients showed fever before admission with it

56

largely being the first symptom (5). Therefore, temperature screening in the high-risk

57

population is important for early identification of COVID-19 infection and thereby reducing

58

the risk of cross infection.

59

During the epidemic, infrared tympanic thermometers (IRTT) and non-contact infrared

60

thermometer (NCIT) are being applied to temperature screening in the general population (6).

61

As a screening tool, it is quick for mass screening and allows a faster triage (7). However, we

62

need to consume a lot of disposable plastic covers when we use IRTT. It may increase the

63

financial burden in the widespread use of population screening. Furthermore, indirect

64

contacts with infected individuals may increase the risk of cross infection. NCIT meets the

65

clinical requirements for mass screening in terms of detection efficiency, safety and

66

cost-performance. Besides, it takes less time than IRTT. Forehead is one of the key targets of

67

thermography. However, forehead temperature is affected by physiological and

68

environmental conditions (8). It should be measured in a relatively temperature-controlled

69

environment. A previous study suggested to acclimate to the indoor temperature for at least

70

10 min for those who were exposed to the cold before taking body temperature readings (8).

71

However, it is not practical for mass screening in winter during the outbreak of COVID-19.

72

Wrist temperature in this outbreak is under consideration. Before testing, they just need

73

to roll up their sleeves at 10 cm above the palmar side of the wrist. Considering this area is

74

covered with clothing, the wrist temperatures may keep stable. Previous study showed

75

wearable devices (WD) on the wrist were applied in temperature monitoring in clinical

76

practice (9). It brings a challenge whether it can be used as an accurate, safe and

77

cost-effective screening tool in this outbreak.

78

In this study, we explored the accuracy and advantages of wrist temperature

79

measurement in a real-life population in different environments and conditions. We aimed to

80

find the thresholds of this key technique for diagnosis of fever. It may assist to improve the

81

standardization of both practical use and performance, especially indispensable in the

82

pandemic 2019-nCoV situation.

Materials and Methods

86

Study population

87

This was a prospective observational study in a real-life population. We consecutively

88

enrolled a total of 572 participants at Ningbo First Hospital in China in this study (Figure 1).

89

The exclusion criteria included: (i) Age ≤ 18 years (n = 6); (ii) Wearing hearing aid, or

90

having a cerumen (n = 7); (iii) Participants with soft tissue infection or trauma (n =3); (iv)

91

Missing data of wrist, forehead, and tympanic temperature (n = 4); and (v) Participants whose

92

forehead temperature measurements showed “low” (n = 23). We finally enrolled 528 eligible

93

participants for the final analysis, including 261 indoor and 267 outdoor participants. The 261

94

indoor participants were from the fever clinic and emergency department, and the 267

95

outdoor participants included patients and accompanying family members. The data of indoor

96

participants were collected consecutively between February 14th and February 20th, 2020.

97

The data of outdoor participants were collected on February 14th, 15th, 17th, 2020.

98

Temperature readings were taken by trained and experienced nurses. Each participant was

99

measured for wrist, forehead, and tympanic temperature twice. The temperatures were

100

recorded by mean wrist temperature, forehead, and tympanic temperature, respectively. Data

101

regarding age, gender, transportation, occupation, and temperature were recorded

102

immediately by the nurse to pre-printed files.

103

The study was approved by Ningbo First Hospital Ethics Committee. All participants

104

were asked verbally. They gave their oral informed consent in this study. The study was

105

registered in ClinicalTrials.gov with identifier number: NCT04274621.

107

Assessment of environment

108

Indoor patients at the fever clinic and emergency department were those who has been

109

indoors for at least a few minutes. The outdoor participants were divided into four type

according to their means of transportation to the hospital as walk, bicycle/electric vehicle, car,

111

and inside the car.

113

Measurement of temperature

114

Tympanic temperature was measured using IRTT (Braun ThermoScan PRO 6000). Wrist

115

and forehead temperature were measured using NCIT. The NCIT was ranged 32.0–42.9°C.

116

The accuracy was ± 0.2°C. NCIT measurements were taken following the manufacturer's

117

instructions in the mid-forehead and a region at 10 cm above the palmar side of the wrist.

118

After pulling the pinna backward, the nurse inserted IRTT into the external auditory meatus.

119

The probe was held in the same position until the “beep” was heard. Temperature readings

120

were taken by the same trained nurse in the following order: forehead, forehead (the second

121

time), left wrist, right wrist, left tympanic, and right tympanic. The data were recorded by

122

another researcher in pre-printed files. Tympanic membrane is in close proximity to the

123

hypothalamus and the internal carotid artery (10). Thus, tympanic temperature is considered

124

to directly reflect core temperature (11), and was defined as the gold standard in this study.

125

These thermometers were stabilized before measurements. Calibration of thermometers were

126

checked by the Quality and Technology Supervision Bureau, Ningbo, China. It was

127

according to Calibration Specification of Infrared Thermometers for Measurement of Human

128

Temperature (JJF1107-2003).

129
130

Statistical analysis

131

Power calculation was performed for sample size. The following parameters were used: a

132

power of 90%, an α-error level of 0.05, estimating a standard deviation of 1°C and a potential

133

allowable error of 0.2°C. Considering a 10% possibility of dropouts and otherwise missing

134

data, at least 293 subjects were needed in our study.

147

Participants

148

In this prospective observational study, a total of 528 participants were enrolled. Figure 1

149

summarizes characteristics of the participants. The mean age was 46.7 ± 16.4 years. 69.4% (n

150

= 297) of participants were males, and 78.2% (n = 413) were patients (Table 1). Mean

151

forehead, wrist, tympanic measurements were 35.6 ± 1.2°C, 35.7 ± 0.8°C, and 36.6 ± 0.6°C,

152

respectively. There were 44 patients with fever in indoor patients. The data of outdoor

153

participants were collected on February 14th, 15th, 17th, 2020. Mean weather temperatures

154

were 13°C, 14°C, and 7°C, respectively.

155
156

Bland-Altman comparison among the participants under different environment

157

Table 2 showed mean temperatures and Bland-Altman analysis among the participants

158

under different environment. Compared with tympanic temperature as golden standard, the

159

mean difference ranged from -1.72 to -0.56°C for the forehead measurement, and -0.96 to

160

-0.61°C for the wrist measurement. We observed a lower variation in wrist than forehead

161

temperature measurements.

162

Outdoor participants were divided into four types as walk, bicycle or electric vehicle, car,

163

and inside the car. For those who walked, the agreement limits for wrist and tympanic was

164

between -2.05 and 0.34°C; -4.07 and 0.64°C for forehead and tympanic (Figure 2A, B). For

165

those who used bicycle or electric vehicle, the agreement limits for wrist and tympanic was

166

between -2.14 and 0.93°C; -3.82 and 0.84°C for forehead and tympanic (Figure 2C, D). For

167

those who were transported by car, the agreement limits for wrist and tympanic was between

168

-1.43 and -0.44°C; -1.47 and -0.36°C for forehead and tympanic (Figure 2E, F). For those

169

who were inside the car, the agreement limits for wrist and tympanic was between -1.54 and

170

-0.15°C; -2.41 and 0.16°C for forehead and tympanic (Figure 2G, H). It highlighted that wrist

171

temperature had narrower 95% limits of agreement than forehead. Wrist measurements had

172

the higher percentage of differences falling within ± 0.5°C than forehead measurements in

173

these four types.

174

For indoor patients, the agreement limits for wrist and tympanic was between -2.70 and

175

-0.77°C; -1.91 and 0.80°C for forehead and tympanic (Figure 3). 57.1% of forehead values

176

were included within ± 0.5°C, followed by wrist values (41.4%). We also explore the

177

agreement of left and right wrists (Figure S1). The mean bias is 0.00. The agreement limits

178

for wrist and tympanic was between -0.74 and 0.74°C. It showed good agreement between

179

right and left wrists.

180
181

The receiver–operator characteristic (ROC) curves for detection of fever

182

We performed a ROC curves in indoor patients for detecting tympanic temperature

183

≥37.3°C. Figure 4 shows the comparison between wrist and forehead measurements for

184

detection of fever. Both measurement had significantly great abilities of screening patients

185

for fever (wrist: AUC 0.790; 95% CI: 0.725–0.854, P <0.001; forehead: AUC 0.816; 95% CI:

186

0.757–0.876, P <0.0001). The cut-off value of wrist measurement for detecting tympanic

187

temperature ≥37.3°C was 36.2°3 with a 86.4% sensitivity and a 67.0% specificity. And the

188

best threshold of forehead measurement was also 36.2°6 with a 93.2% sensitivity and a 60.0%

189

specificity.

Discussion

192

In this prospective real-world study, we found that wrist temperature measurement is

193

more stable than forehead using NCIT under different circumstances in outdoor participants.

194

Both measurement had significantly great abilities of screening patients for fever in indoor

195

patients. The cut-off value for wrist and forehead temperature were both 36.2°C. They

196

showed good sensitivity. It may assist for fever screening in the population, especially in the

197

outbreak of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). To our knowledge, this study was the first

198

to explore the reliability and validity of wrist and forehead temperature measurement in mass

199

screening.

200

Previous studies showed that axilla, rectal temperature were the gold standards in clinical

201

practice (14, 15). However, it was impractical for the large-scale screening. Timesaving and

202

less invasive tools were needed. IRTT and NCIT are being applied in the general population

203

during the epidemic. A lot of disposable plastic covers were consumed, which may increase

204

the financial burden. In China, it cost 1–2 RMB (about 0.2 dollars) for per disposable plastic

205

cover. Besides, indirect contacts increased the risk of cross infection. Forehead temperature

206

was used for the widespread use of population screening using NCIT. However, it can be

207

affected by a person’s physiological and environmental conditions (8, 16). The forehead

208

temperature value of 23 participants showed “low” in our study. This all happened on the

209

same day (February 17th, 2020) with an outside temperature of 7°C. Thus, we chose wrist

210

temperature as an alternative, especially in the winter when mass screening is needed. Wrist

211

measurement indicated peripheral temperature at 10 cm above the palmar side of the wrist. It

212

was within our expectation that wrist measurement readings attained was lower than

213

tympanic route. However, this area was covered by clothing all the time. It was less

214

influenced by environmental conditions. Our study showed it was more stable for participants

215

under different circumstance than forehead measurement. It is important for mass screen in

216

the open air during the Outbreak of COVID-19. The ROC curves showed wrist and forehead

217

measurement had significantly great abilities of screening patients for fever. The cut-off

218

value of both measurement was 36.2°C. It can be applied in clinical practice and assist to

219

improve the standardization of both practical use and performance.

220

The strengths of this study included its large sample size, and prospective design in the

221

real-world setting. There were several limitations. First, it is difficult to quantify the

222

physiological and environmental conditions. Second, only one brand of thermometer was

223

enrolled in this study. It was uncertain that it could be generalized to all brands of

224

thermometers in the market.

225

In conclusion, this study confirmed wrist measurement was more stable for participants

226

under different circumstance than forehead measurement. Both measurement had

227

significantly great fever screening abilities for indoor patients, and the cut-off value of both

228

measurements for fever was 36.2°C. Further studies are needed to explore the validity and

229

accuracy of wrist temperature.
