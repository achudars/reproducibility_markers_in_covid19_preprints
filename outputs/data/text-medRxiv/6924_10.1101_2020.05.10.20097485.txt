Abstract
In the late stages of an epidemic, infections are often sporadic and
geographically distributed. Spatially structured stochastic models can
capture these important features of disease dynamics, thereby allowing a
broader exploration of interventions. Here we develop a stochastic model
of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission amongst an interconnected group of population centres representing counties, municipalities and districts (collectively, “counties”). The
model is parameterized with demographic, epidemiological, testing, and
travel data from Ontario, Canada. We explore the effects of different control strategies after the epidemic curve has been flattened. We compare a
local strategy of re-opening (and re-closing, as needed) schools and workplaces county-by-county according to triggers for county-specific infection
prevalence, to a global strategy of province-wide re-opening and re-closing
according to triggers for province-wide infection prevalence. We find that
the local strategy results in a similar number coronavirus disease (COVID19) cases but significantly fewer person-days of closure, even under high
inter-county travel scenarios. However, both cases and person-days lost
to closure rise when county triggers are not coordinated and when testing
rates vary among counties. Finally, we show that local strategies can also
do better in the early epidemic stage but only if testing rates are high and
the trigger prevalence is low. Our results suggest that pandemic planning
for the far side of the COVID-19 epidemic curve should consider local
strategies for re-opening and re-closing.

Introduction

Outbreak containment through testing, case isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine is often the first line of defense against a novel emerging infectious disease [2, 8, 32]. However, efforts to contain SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks have failed
in many jurisdictions, leading decision-makers to supplement contact tracing
with effective but socio-economically costly interventions such as school and
workplace closure and other means of physical distancing [3, 15].
These measures have flattened the epidemic curve: they have reduced the
effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 below one, meaning that each
infected case is infecting less than one person on average [3]. The epidemic curve
is a common way to visualize the spread of an infectious disease and has become
ubiquitous during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Data
on cases over time lends itself naturally to analysis by compartmental epidemic
models that assume a homogeneously mixing population. Such models can be a
valid approximation for many applications [22,41]. However, the epidemic curve
can also obscure the spatio-temporal nature of infectious diseases, as infections
jump between neighbouring populations [33]. In the early stages of an outbreak,
cases are few and thus subject to random effects (stochasticity). And in the late
stages of an outbreak, cases are both stochastic and spatially dispersed across
multiple population centres connected through travel [18].
In such early and late stages of an epidemic, a stochastic, spatially structured
model can capture important features of disease dynamics [6, 27, 28, 30]. When
cases are rare, the infection may go locally extinct due to chance events–an effect referred to as stochastic fade-out [4, 9, 33]. This has nontrivial interactions
with the spatial structure of the population [46]. If cases are still high in other
populations, the virus may be subsequently re-introduced from those other populations through travel [14, 33]. But if the infection has also faded out in the
other populations, the virus is eradicated [16].
As cases continue to decline on the far side of the COVID-19 epidemic curve,
decision-makers will make choices about how and when to lift restrictions. But
they will face a very different epidemiological landscape than the middle stages
of the outbreak, when infections were numerous. Complete and sudden removal
of these restrictions before a sufficient proportion of the population is immune
to SARS-CoV-2 could cause a resurgence of cases [45]. Hence a phased approach
to open or close schools and workplaces, based on“trigger” conditions such as
the number of local confirmed positive cases, might be better [15, 45].
Phased approaches might be temporal in nature, with certain types of workplaces being opened before other types, for instance. Alternatively, a spatially
phased approach is also possible, with smaller and/or less densely populated
areas being re-opened before larger urban centers [34]. Spatially phased approaches are based on the hypothesis that during the later stages of a pandemic,
the force of infection in smaller populations could be significantly less than larger
populations due to more frequent stochastic fade-out [4, 9, 33], reduced contact
rates on account of lower population densities [5, 21, 24, 26], and/or reduced
case importation due to fewer travel connections [13]. Indeed, Ontario’s four

largest cities have 2.5 times more COVID-19 cases per capita than the rest of
the province (Fig. 1a) [37]. Hence, school and workplace closure could be lifted
first in those populations where they provide little marginal benefit. But under
a spatially phased approach, coordination between local populations remains
paramount [39], given that pathogens can spread rapidly between populations
during a pandemic [13, 15]. Re-importation risk may compound when local closures are poorly coordinated, with some populations eager to lift closures and
hesitant to re-enact them when needed.
These observations emphasize three things about modelling COVID-19 interventions on the far side of a flattened curve: (1) a stochastic transmission
model might be useful for capturing disease dynamics once cases become rare;
(2) spatial structure is important for evaluating spatially phased plans, since
the pathogen will not be present everywhere all the time, and (3) cases can be
re-imported from other locations that have not eliminated the infection, suggesting that coordination between counties under a spatially phased approach could
remain important. Our objective is to develop a spatially-structured stochastic
model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, testing, and school and workplace closure
in order to address three questions: (1) Are closures best lifted at the scale of an
entire province or on a county-by-county basis? (2) Does coordination of testing
protocols and re-opening criteria between counties improve outcomes? (3) How
well can a spatially phased approach work in the early stages of the epidemic?
We use our model to determine the timing and organizational scale at which
school and workplace re-opening strategies can minimize both the number of infections and person-days lost to closures, during the late-stage and early-stage
epidemic. Our model is parameterized with epidemiological, demographic, and
travel data for the counties, municipalities, and districts (collectively, “counties”) of Ontario, Canada.

Results
Model overview
We model a population distributed across local population centres (“counties”)
connected through travel. Within each county, transmission follows an SEPAIR
disease natural history: S is susceptible to infection, E is infected, but not yet
infectious (or simply, ‘exposed’), blueP is pre-symptomatic infectiousness (or
simply, ‘pre-symptomatic’), A is infectious without ever developing symptoms
(or simply, ‘asymptomatic’), I is both infectious and symptomatic (or simply,
‘symptomatic’), and R is removed (no longer infectious). Symptomatic individuals are tested for SARS-CoV-2 and their status becomes ascertained with
some probability per day. The infection transmission probability in a county
depends on the number of contacts in schools and workplaces–which are reduced by closures–and on contacts in other settings not affected by closures,
such as homes. Transmission also depends on how effectively closures reduce
transmission, and the extent to which population size drives transmission. The

population behavioural response to the presence of the COVID-19 is an important feature of physical distancing [11, 17, 29, 40, 47]. Hence, we assumed that
transmission outside of schools and workplaces is reduced by individual physical distancing efforts (restricting social contacts, washing hands, etc) and that
more confirmed positive cases in the county cause more individuals to practice physical distancing. Each individual travels from their home county to
another county for the day with some probability (Fig. 1b) that is reduced if
schools and workplaces are closed in the destination county. Additional details
on model structure, data sources, parameter values, and calibration appear in
Materials and Methods. Parameter definitions, values, and literature sources
are summarized in SI Appendix, Table 1.

System dynamics
We ran re-opening and re-closing simulations over a time horizon of one year
and projected the number of cases in each county. Each simulation began with
a 75-day period of province-wide closure applied once 325 confirmed positive
cases accumulated in the province. After this period, we contrasted a “local
strategy” of re-opening and re-closing counties individually according to a trigger prevalence of confirmed positive COVID-19 cases in the county, to a “global
strategy” of re-opening and re-closing the entire province according to a trigger
prevalence of confirmed positive COVID-19 cases in the province. Our model

dynamics are characterized by two distinct regimes (Fig. 2a,c). In highlypopulated counties, COVID-19 is endemic throughout the time horizon of the
simulation. However, in counties with lower populations, cases blink in and out
during the year, as infections jump between counties through travel and decline
due to testing and voluntary distancing alone. The infection patterns appear
qualitatively similar under both strategies (Fig. 2a,c), but closure patterns are
very different, with most counties being closed most of the time under the global
strategy (Fig. 2b,d).

Local versus global re-opening strategies
The local strategy tends to outperform the global strategy for most values of the
trigger prevalence (Fig. 3). When the trigger prevalence is very high (i.e. an
extreme scenario where decision-makers re-open or re-close for a prevalence of
1,000 confirmed positive cases per 100,000), a high proportion of the population
becomes infected, since school and workplace closures are rarely sustained in
either strategy after the initial 75-day province closure. At the other extreme of
the lowest trigger prevalence, both strategies minimize infections by maintaining
closures for the majority of the year. However, intermediate values of the trigger
prevalence represent a “sweet spot” for the local strategy, where it outperforms
the global strategy in terms exhibiting significantly fewer person-days of closure
for a comparable number of COVID-19 cases. The local strategy can accomplish
this because it affords flexibility to enact closures only in areas with continuing
active outbreaks–primarily more populous counties with higher epidemic spread
rates. We identify an optimal trigger prevalence as the trigger prevalence that
allows significant reductions in person-days lost to closure, but only permits
cases to increase by 1% compared to its minimum value across all values of the
trigger prevalence (blue dashed lines, Fig. 3). At this optimal trigger, the local
strategy results in 20% fewer person-days of closure across the entire province
than the global strategy.

Benefits of coordination
A local strategy could enable different counties to adopt different triggers. Our
simulation results confirm that poor coordination can undermine the benefits
of the local strategy (Fig. 4a,b). As between-county variation in the trigger
prevalence increases, both the mean and 85 % quantile across stochastic realizations of both the proportion infected and person-days closed rise under a
broad range of assumptions for inter-county travel rates (Fig. 4a,b). The rise in
infections in this scenario is somewhat counteracted by the rise in person-days
lost to closure: renewed outbreaks in counties that lift closures prematurely export infections to neighbouring counties, which in turn necessitates additional
closures in those counties and increases the number of person-days lost to closure (Fig. 4b). This emphasizes how close coordination can be beneficial from
both public health and economic perspectives. Lack of coordination in testing
is also problematic (SI Appendix, Fig. 1). As between-county variation in the

testing rate for symptomatic individuals increases, the mean and 85 % quantile
of proportion infected and person-days lost to closure increase in most of the
stochastic realizations.

Sensitivity analysis
These results are qualitatively unchanged under moderate changes to parameter
values in univariate sensitivity analyses (SI Appendix, Fig. 2). Projections are
most sensitive to variation in the transmission probability, efficacy of physical
distancing, and the removal rate. The performance of the local versus global
strategies depends relatively little on the extent to which transmission probabilities are driven by population size, in other words, how rapidly the probability
that a given susceptible person is infected by a given infectious person declines
with the population size of the county (ξ is changed and model is refitted with
new ξ values, SI Appendix, Fig. 3). Similarly, the relative performance of the
two strategies is not strongly affected by doubling of travel rates (SI Appendix,
Fig. 4): although cases and person-days lost to closure increase for both strate-

gies, the local strategy retains its relative performance lead over the global
strategy.

Local closures in the early epidemic
We also compared a modified local strategy of omitting the initial 75-day provincewide closure and closing counties one at a time from the very beginning (followed
by re-opening and re-closing counties as needed), to our baseline local strategy
of following a 75-day province-wide closure with re-opening and re-closing counties one at a time. We found that the modified local strategy could outperform
the baseline local strategy under specific conditions for trigger prevalence and
testing rates (Fig. 5). In particular, the trigger prevalence must be reduced
compared to our baseline analysis (Fig. 5a), such that counties are closed as
soon as a few cases are detected (Fig. 5c). The optimal trigger prevalence for
the modified local strategy increases exponentially with the testing probability
(from 17 to 120 positive active cases in a city the size of Ottawa), meaning
that counties can apply less stringent triggers only if their testing rates are very
high and find more cases (Fig. 5c). Testing of asymptomatic individuals is not
included in our baseline analysis, but might occur under high testing capacity
and effective contact tracing, and would permit a higher trigger prevalence and
reduced person-days closed under the modified local strategy (Fig. 5b) by limiting epidemic growth to the most populous counties. However, given the initial
short supply of test kits and long testing turnaround times that characterized
Ontario and many other jurisdictions, the testing rate for symptomatic individuals probably remained below the required 0.1/day during the early epidemic in
Ontario. Sensitivity analysis in the early epidemic (Fig. 5b) additionally shows
that the benefit of fewer person-days closed under the local strategy declines

omitting the initial 75-day province-wide closure at the start of an
epidemic can minimize infections and person-days of closure under
moderate-to-high testing rates and low trigger prevalence. (A) Across
all combinations of control parameters (specified in B), not enacting an initial
75-day province closure at the start of the epidemic reduces person-days closed
but requires a lower trigger prevalence in county-level closure decisions (vertical

either absent or present (in which case γl,j among counties follows a uniform
distribution with coefficient of variation 0.27), asymptomatic testing τA = 0 or

the population or concentrated in two randomly selected counties population
> 500, 000.
when closures begin after many thousands of people are already infected, when
travel is high, or if initial infections are concentrated in cities. Taken together,
these results suggest that the modified local strategy of omitting the 75-day
province-wide closure could significantly outperform the baseline local strategy early in the initial epidemic only with prompt mitigation, moderate-to-high
testing rates, and very low trigger prevalence (a scenario resembling the South
Korean control strategy). This finding reiterates public health consensus that
early and aggressive action in the early stages of a pandemic, and also potentially during second waves, could minimize both infections and total person-days
of closure.

Discussion
Plans for re-opening and re-closing schools and workplaces in the later stages
of COVID-19 epidemics are diverse and uncoordinated. Some re-opening guidelines include epidemiological triggers such as case incidence or contact tracing

capacity [36], while others include guidelines for re-opening on a county-bycounty basis [34]. Our results suggest that plans for re-opening economies on
the far side of the COVID-19 epidemic curve should consider preceding largerscale re-openings with local re-openings. However, for this to work, the trigger
conditions need to be coordinated by the province: individual counties cannot
draw up guidelines independently.
Our model was parameterized for the province of Ontario, Canada. Sensitivity analysis showed our results were robust to assumptions regarding transmission processes and travel patterns. The robustness of these results stems
from being able to re-open more sparsely populated counties that have a lower
case burden and can benefit from stochastic fade-out more often than denselypopulated urban centres (Fig. 2). In turn, this suggests that the results may
apply more broadly to other Canadian provinces and US states with similarly
low population density and dispersed spatial structure. However, this would
need to be confirmed with model extensions that are tailored to these other
jurisdictions. Additionally, not all US states began their control efforts with
a period of closure that was effective enough to flatten their epidemic curves,
which is a crucial difference.
Province- and state-wide lockdowns have generated resistance from populations that feel the restrictions should not apply to them. This outcome is tied
up with the phenomenon of policy resistance, where the nonlinear behavioural
response to an intervention partly undermines the intervention [43]. Nonlinear interaction between human and natural systems is pervasive [25], and epidemiological systems are no exception [7, 47]. Behavioural feedback during the
COVID-19 pandemic has manifested through (1) physical distancing to minimize individual infection risk in response to rising case reports [40], and (2)
pushback against lockdowns on account of economic impacts or perceived restrictions on civil liberties. An evidence-informed and coordinated approach
to lifting lockdowns in less densely populated areas first, such as the one we
propose, might have the added benefit of improving compliance to measures
in populations that perceive province-wide closure to cover a needlessly large
section of the population. In a related vein, local closures may be more effective
if local decision-makers can enact closures more promptly than what is possible
under a province-wide decision-making process.
Our model did not include several features that could influence predictions.
A key assumption was that individual counties enact closures as soon as positive
cases exceed a trigger prevalence. In practice, a delay could allow case notifications to surge. Hesitation to re-close counties as needed can be especially
problematic because (1) an increase in deaths follows weeks behind an increase
in cases, and (2) the optimal trigger prevalence found here translates to closing
counties when only a few active cases are detected (Fig. 3b). Future iterations
of this model could include other important features such as age structure [45]
or ICU capacity. These features could enable projecting the effect of re-opening
only primary and elementary schools, or using local ICU occupancy as a trigger.
Future work could also explore the role of extra-provincial case importations in
the late stage of the pandemic, which could become important once local cases

become rare [33].
Data on SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology, interventions and treatments will become both increasingly available and increasingly reliable as the COVID-19
pandemic unfolds. There is a corresponding urgent need to develop more detailed models that can address a broader range of policy questions, so that
evidence-based policy-making has more information upon which to base decisions. Stochastic, spatially structured models may become increasingly useful
for informing re-opening and re-closing strategies in the COVID-19 pandemic,
by allowing decision-makers to explore the potential advantages of coordinated
county-by-county strategies.

Methods
The following subsections describe the details of the model structure and parameterization. A table of parameter definitions, baseline values, and literature
sources appears in SI Appendix: Table 1.

Population structure and travel
The model contains 49 local populations (“counties”) that represent each of 49
Ontario census divisions and have the same corresponding population sizes [1].
At the start of each day, each individual in county j travels to county k for
the day with probability mjk , in which case they experience any transmission
events that occur there. At the end of the day, they return back to county j.
The values of the travel matrix M = [mjk ] were obtained from survey data [1]
spanning 39% of Ontario inhabitants, of whom 25% worked outside their census
division, arriving at an aggregate daily travel probability of 10% per day. This
likely overestimates the impact of travel since we are treating each individual
in the population as equally likely of travelling to another county each day,
whereas in real populations, the same individuals tend to travel each day and
tend to repeat their contacts with the same individuals. Infected individuals
are less likely to travel by a factor r = 0.19 (i.e. 19% less likely to travel),
since 81% of reported COVID-19 cases are mild [12]. Individuals who test
positive are less likely to travel by a factor η = 0.8 [20, 42], with travel by
individuals sick and confirmed positive reduced by (1 − η)(1 − r). Additionally,
each individual’s travel probability to a closed county is reduced by a factor ,
since fewer individuals travel to a county when its schools and workplaces are
closed.

Transmission and testing
The state {Di , Ti } of individual i reflects both their epidemiological status
Di ∈ {S, E, A, P, I, R} and their testing status, where Ti ∈ {N, K} for not
known/known infection status, respectively. {·, Ti } denotes an individual with

testing status Ti and any of the five epidemiological states, with similar interpretation for {Di , ·}. Pj denotes the population size of county j and PjDT denotes
the number of individuals of state {D, T } in county j. Each timestep lasts one
day. During each day, each individual’s epidemiological status in county j is
updated as follows:
1. Individuals in the {S, ·} state become exposed with probability λj , entering
the {E, ·} state.
2. blueIndividuals in the {E, ·} state become pre-symptomatic with probability (1 − π)α and enter the {P, ·} state, or become asymptomatic with
probability πα and enter the {A, ·} state.
3. Individuals in the {P, ·} state become symptomatic with probability σ,
entering the {I, ·} state.
4. Individuals in the {I, N } state are tested with probability τI,j , entering
the {I, K} states.
5. blueIndividuals in the {I, ·} and {A, ·} states are removed (are no longer
infectious) with probability ρ, entering the {R, ·} state.
Infection history parameter values are obtained from epidemiological literature [35, 44]. We assign each newly infected individual to be a super-spreader
with probability s = 0.2 [31] and denote super-spreading (non-super-spreading )
individuals with the subscript s (e.g., As , Is ) (ns, resp.). Super-spreaders infect
others with a probability that is (1−s)/s times higher than non-superspreaders.
blueDaily testing probabilities improved over the the first 60 days of provincewide closures as processing time declined three-fold and testing increased 100fold [38]. To model this, we assumed daily testing probabilities increase from
t
an initial level τIt0 to τI f by day 60 after the 325th positive case is detected
t
t0
and constrained τI > τI f /100. Physical distancing through closures or behavioural changes can reduce the probability of transmission by up preventing
a fraction of all contacts. Closure Cj (t) (see below) of schools and workplaces
in county j can be applied and lifted over time and affect a fraction w of all
contacts. We take w = 0.45 based on time use data for time spent at schools,
workplaces, and other institutions that can be mandated to close [10]. The remaining time spent, 1 − w, is in settings such as homes and social gatherings.
We assumed that individuals reduce their contacts in proportion to the number of confirmed cases reported in their county by a factor 1 − exp(−ωPj+ /Pj ),
where Pj+ = PjAK + PjIK . Hence, the fraction of contacts Fj (t) remaining after
physical distancing in county j at time t is therefore
Fj (t) = w(1 − Cj (t)) + (1 − w)(1 − (1 − exp(−ωPj+ /Pj ))).
The contacts of an infected person decline from fT =N = 1 to a fraction fT =K =
1 − η if they test positive for COVID-19, where η = 0.8 [20, 42]. The transmission probability also depends on the individual’s epidemiological state D, with

the transmission probability depends on population size: standard incidence is
recovered for ξ = 0, while ξ = 1 recovers a scenario where contacts increase with
population size to an extent controlled by c [5].

School and workplace closure
In Ontario, an emergency was declared on the day the cumulative number of
reported positive cases tn reached 325 (March 17), leading to closures of workplaces (schools were already closed for March Break). Hence, closure strategies
in our model were enacted only after an initial tstart = 75-day province-wide
closure expires. Re-openings (and re-closures) are subsequently enacted under
the local and global strategy when the percentage of confirmed cases fall below
(or exceed), a trigger prevalence γG at the province level or γl,j within a county
j. Under limited coordination, γl,j may be greater in counties eager to lift or
hesitant to enact closures. Any closures last for δC = 50 days, with tG (tl,j )
denoting the last time a closure was enacted in the province (in county j), after
which period the closure decision is re-evaluated. The closure function Cj (t) is

Calibration
We set β0A = β0P = 0.5β0I [19], based on data showing 44% of SARS-CoV-2
shedding occurs before symptoms develop and our assumed duration of infectious periods. blueGiven that contact rates can depend on population size, we
determined β0I under each value of ξ and c by calibrating the model in the
absence of distancing, closure, and testing such that 65% of the population is
infected, based on the assumption that R0 = 2.3 and using resulting projections
of the final size from compartmental epidemic models [23, 45]. We calibrated

intervention efficacy (, ω), testing (τIt0 , τI f ), and transmission dependence on
population size (ξ, c) by fitting model outputs of (1) timeseries of incident confirmed cases (the number of individuals entering the {I, K} state each day) to
empirical data on daily confirmed cases by reporting date [37] (SI Appendix,
Fig. 5); (2) the spatial distribution of cumulative confirmed positive cases by
day 85 of the outbreak (June 10, 2020) in the model to data [37]; (3) the modelled ratio of actual cases to confirmed positive cases province-wide (i.e. number
of individuals not in {S, ·} to the cumulative number of individuals tested positive), to an empirical estimate of this ratio of 8.76 for under-ascertainment in the

modelled amount of discretionary physical distancing 1−exp(−ωPj+ /Pj ) by day
t − tn=325 = 21 in our simulation to an empirical estimate of ≈ 50% adherence
to physical distancing by day 21 of the outbreak (April 6, 2020) from a public
survey gallup1 (0.49 ± 0.3 in our model). blueIn fitting the spatial case distribution, we calculated the proportion of all confirmed positive tests found in the
4 most populous Ontario cities and in 3 sets of counties grouped by population
density. We adjusted the proportion of total cases and total cases per 100,000
(Fig. 1a) observed in each county or county group j for spatial differences in the
number of tests Tj per capita, byPmultiplying
P the observed number of cases in
each location by the fraction (Pj Tj )/(Tj P j) (with fraction values ranging
0.72-1.16).
