43

as a protective mechanism but conclusive evidence is lacking. Here we demonstrate that all

44

unexposed individuals harbor SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells with marginal cross-

45

reactivity to common cold corona and other unrelated viruses. They display low functional

46

avidity and broad protein target specificities and their frequencies correlate with the overall

47

size of the CD4+ memory compartment reflecting the “immunological age” of an individual.

48

COVID-19 patients have strongly increased SARS-CoV-2-specific inflammatory T cell

49

responses that are correlated with severity. Strikingly however, patients with severe COVID-

50

19 displayed lower TCR functional avidity and less clonal expansion. Our data suggest that a

51

low avidity pre-existing T cell memory negatively impacts on the T cell response quality against

52

neoantigens such as SARS-CoV-2, which may predispose to develop inappropriate immune

53

reactions especially in the elderly. We propose the immunological age as an independent risk

54

factor to develop severe COVID-19.

Introduction

72

COVID-19 displays remarkable disparity of clinical symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic or

73

mild disease frequently observed in children and younger adults to severe clinical symptoms

74

associated with high mortality mainly in elderly and high-risk patients. Differences in the

75

immune response may contribute to this diverse pathology. Severe disease is characterized

76

by hyperinflammation, suggesting that exaggerated immune reactions are part of COVID-19

77

pathogenesis. However, it is currently not clear which type of adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-

78

2 is protective or detrimental. Thus, there is an enormous interest to decipher the anti-SARS-

79

CoV-2 response, both to define parameters of immune protection versus pathology, as well as

80

for the design of effective vaccination strategies.

81

SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells are prime candidates to be involved in this process. They

82

are central organizers of anti-viral immune responses while uncontrolled T cell responses may

83

cause pathology. Severe lymphopenia accompanies severe disease and T cell reappearance

84

correlates with patient recovery (Huang et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Yang

85

et al., 2020). Markers of T cell activation were found to be increased on total (Diao et al., 2020;

86

Sekine et al., 2020; Wilk et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020), as well as on SARS-CoV-2-specific

87

T cells (Braun et al., 2020; Sekine et al., 2020). Overall COVID-19 patients seem to develop

88

robust Th1-like SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cell responses focused on spike, membrane

89

and nucleocapsid (Ncap) proteins (Grifoni et al., 2020). Increased frequencies of SARS-CoV-

90

2-specific T cells have been correlated with more severe disease (Anft et al., 2020; Peng et

91

al., 2020) supporting the idea that exaggerated CD4+ T cell responses may contribute to the

92

hyperinflammation. However, the factors which determine the magnitude as well as the quality

93

of the CD4+ T cell response and how this relates to predisposition and/ or manifestation of

94

severe disease remains unknown. In particular, the effect of aging is discussed, since the risk

95

to develop severe COVID-19 dramatically increases in the elderly.

96

Several studies have observed that a certain fraction of un-exposed donors have pre-existing

97

SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells (Braun et al., 2020; Grifoni et al., 2020; Le Bert et al., 2020;

98

Mateus et al., 2020; Meckiff et al., 2020; Sekine et al., 2020; Weiskopf et al., 2020) which

99

contained at least some T cells cross-reactive against selected peptides with homology to

100

related common cold corona virus strains (CCCoV) (Braun et al., 2020; Mateus et al., 2020).

101

From this it was hypothesized that encounter with CCCoV may provide protective cross-

102

reactive memory especially in younger patients, where infections with CCCoV are especially

103

prevalent.

104

However, data on the prevalence of CD4+ T cell responses against CCCoV in humans are

105

lacking. Furthermore, pre-existing immunity has also been described for several other

106

pathogens and neoantigens (Bacher et al., 2013; Campion et al., 2014; Kwok et al., 2012; Su

107

et al., 2013) with variable consequences, from protective to harmful (Bacher et al., 2019;

Greiling et al., 2018; Koutsakos et al., 2019; Sridhar et al., 2013; Welsh et al., 2010; Woodland

109

and Blackman, 2006). Thus its impact may depend on the T cells functional characteristics,

110

the specific antigen- or pathogen-context (Sette and Crotty, 2020), and age (Woodland and

111

Blackman, 2006). Such functional characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in severe

112

versus mild COVID-19 and unexposed individuals are still poorly described. Specifically, the

113

prevalence of the putative cross-reactive T cells within unexposed donors and COVID-19

114

patients and in different age groups, their phenotypic and functional characteristics, as well as

115

the inducing antigen(s) are unknown.

116

Here we show that pre-existing memory T cells are present in all unexposed donors and

117

increased in the elderly, but not primarily driven by CCCoVs. Pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-

118

specific memory T cells possess only low TCR avidity, suggesting impaired functionailty. This

119

functional impairment is closely mirrored in T cells from severe COVID-19 patients in contrast

120

to mild disease, suggesting that they may originate from pre-existing memory T cells. Thus we

121

suggest the immunological age as a potential risk factor for severe COVID-19.

Results
Strongly increased frequencies of human SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells against
the spike, membrane and Ncap proteins in COVID-19 patients
To characterize the human T cell response against SARS-CoV-2, we analyzed T cells reactive

129

against a panel of 12 different SARS-CoV-2 proteins. SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells were

130

detected based on the up-regulation of CD154+ (CD40L) following 7h ex vivo stimulation of

131

PBMCs with overlapping peptide pools of the different proteins and subsequent magnetic

132

enrichment (Antigen-reactive T cell enrichment, ARTE) (Bacher et al., 2016; Bacher et al.,

133

2019) (Figure S1A). SARS-CoV-2 exposure versus non-exposure of blood donors was verified

134

by SARS-CoV-2 PCR and/ or serology testing (Table S1).

135

The response of COVID-19 patients was mainly directed against three proteins, spike,

136

membrane and nucleocapsid (Ncap), as previously suggested (Grifoni et al., 2020), as well as

137

to lower extent and with more variability between donors against AP3a, ORF9b, NS6, NS7a

138

and NS8 (Figure 1A, B). We observed no differences in the reactivity against the N-terminal or

139

C-terminal part of the spike protein in COVID-19 patients. The frequencies of reactive cells

140

against single or pooled spike, membrane and Ncap, were strongly increased in patients

141

versus unexposed individuals (Figure 1C), whereas no differences were detected against a

142

pool of Influenza A H1N1 proteins (containing HA, MP1, MP2, NP and NA), as a control

143

antigen. In contrast to previous reports suggesting pre-existing memory only in a subset of

144

unexposed individuals, the sensitive detection by ARTE identified SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells

145

in all unexposed donors albeit at low and variable frequencies ranging from 1 in 10-5-10-3

146

(Figure 1A-C). However, while typically >80-90% of SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in COVID-

147

19 patients were directed against spike, membrane and Ncap, the response in unexposed

148

donors was much more variable and directed against multiple proteins (Figure 1D) (Grifoni et

149

al., 2020; Le Bert et al., 2020). The specificity of the SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells in unexposed

150

as well as exposed donors was confirmed by high reactivity of sorted and expanded CD154+

151

T cells towards SARS-CoV-2, but not control antigens (Figure S1B, C).

SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells of COVID-19 patients show an activated Th1/Tfh-like
signature
SARS-CoV-2 reactive cells from COVID-19 patients versus unexposed individuals displayed

159

increased expression of the acute and chronic activation markers Ki-67 and CD38 (Figure 2A),

160

as reported by others (Braun et al., 2020; Sekine et al., 2020). The expression of both markers

161

declined with time after infection, but not the frequencies of reactive T cells (Figure 2B, C). We

162

also detected slightly increased relative and strongly increased absolute production of

163

inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 patients, such as IL-2, IFN-g and IL-21 compared to

164

unexposed donors, as well as a slightly higher production of IL-10 (Figure 2D, E). While

165

inflammatory cytokines increased with time after infection, IL-10 was mainly produced during

166

active disease (Figure S2A), suggesting a counter-regulatory mechanism during acute

167

infection. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells expressed stably high levels of PD-1

168

(CD279) (Figure 2D, E and S2A). Compared to other anti-viral reponses, production of TNF-

169

a, IFN-g and IL10 was rather reduced in convalescent COVID-19 patients, while IL-21 and PD-

170

1 were highly increased (Figure 2F, Figure S2B). We observed no differences in the cytokine

171

response or phenotype between the individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Figure 2F, Figure S2B).

Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies similar T cell clusters in COVID-19 and
unexposed donors

177

To obtain a deeper insight into the cellular composition of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and

178

their molecular patterns we next performed single-cell RNA sequencing of ex vivo FACS-

179

purified SARS-CoV-2 reactive memory T cells. After quality filtering (see Methods) we

180

analyzed in total 104,417 single cells from 6 unexposed and 14 COVID-19 patients.

181

UMAP cluster analysis revealed five clusters with a distinct transcriptional profile (Figure 3A).

182

These were assigned as T follicular-helper-like (Tfh-like, key marker genes IL21, POU2AF1),

183

transitional memory (CD28, IL7R), central memory (CCR7, SELL), cytotoxic (IFNG, CSF2,

184

PRF1, GNLY), type-I interferon response (MX1, OAS1) and cycling T cells (MKI67, CDK1)

185

(Figure 3B). Similar clusters have recently been described in anti-viral T cells (Meckiff et al.,

186

2020). However, especially Tfh-like, transitional and central memory T cells were related and

187

important genes like IFNG, CSF2, IL21, IL2 and PDCD1 were expressed by many cells in all

188

clusters although at different level (Figures 3B, Figure S3A). In addition, we observed three

189

robust clusters, cytotoxic /Th1, type-I interferon, and cycling, which are indicative of cellular

190

activation and an anti-viral type-I interferon response. These results confirm our cytometric

191

analysis pointing to a highly activated Th1 and Tfh-like phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 specific T

192

cells in COVID-19. However, similar clusters were also identified in SARS-CoV-2 reactive

193

memory T cells from unexposed individuals and we were not able to clearly separate

194

unexposed donors from COVID-19 patients or between patients with different disease severity

195

only based on qualitative differences of the reactive T cells (Figure 3C, Figure S3B). There was

196

a tendency that clusters indicative of acute activation, such as cycling and type-I interferon

197

were relatively enriched in COVID-19 and Tfh cells were more abundant in mild COVID19

198

(Figure 3C).

199

Taken together, the cytometric and single cell sequencing data confirm that COVID-19 patients

200

generate a strong pro-inflammatory Th1/cytotoxic-like and Tfh-like response against SARS-

201

CoV-2 spike, membrane, and Ncap proteins. Interestingly though, the differences between the

202

patients groups and healthy controls were mainly quantitative, rather than qualitative. This

203

suggests that these cell types are not unique to COVID-19 but may represent a common

204

cellular phenotype of anti-viral T cells, which are already present in pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-

205

reactive memory T cells from healthy unexposed donors.

206
207
208
209

Low avidity SARS-CoV-2-reactive memory T cells increase with age in unexposed
donors

210

Recent studies have demonstrated pre-existing T cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2

211

presumably against common cold viruses in 20-50% of unexposed donors (Braun et al., 2020;

212

Grifoni et al., 2020; Le Bert et al., 2020; Mateus et al., 2020; Meckiff et al., 2020; Sekine et al.,

213

2020; Weiskopf et al., 2020). However, the antigen specificity as well as the clinical relevance

214

of this cross-reactivity remains unknown (Sette and Crotty, 2020) although some cross-

215

reactivity against homologous CCCoV epitopes has been found (Braun et al., 2020; Mateus et

216

al., 2020). As shown in Figure 1, by sensitive enrichment of reactive T cells we detected low

217

frequencies of cross-reactive T cells against different SARS-CoV-2 proteins in 100% of

218

unexposed donors. To further characterize these pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells,

219

we determined the proportion of memory versus naïve cells. Remarkably, a substantial fraction

220

of SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells from unexposed donors but not COVID-19 patients displayed a

221

naïve phenotype, as evidenced by high expression of CD45RA and CCR7 and lack of effector

222

cytokine expression (Figure 4A, B; Figure 2F). The proportion of memory cells was highly

223

variable between different donors (range 25-95%) (Figure 4B). It has further been speculated

224

that this pre-existing immunity may improve protection especially in young patients and

225

children due to frequent infections with common cold corona viruses (Braun et al., 2020).

226

However, we detected no correlation of pre-existing T cell frequency with donor age (Figure

227

4C). Rather and in sharp contrast to the “pre-immune” hypothesis, the frequency (Figure 4D)

228

and the proportion (Figure 4E) of SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive memory cells of unexposed

229

individuals positively correlated with the proportion of memory cells within the total CD4+

230

population that is associated to the immunological age. A similar pattern was observed for

231

CMV-reactive T cells from CMV sero-negative versus sero-positive donors (Figure 4E), as well

232

as T cells reactive against the neoantigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) (Figure S4).

233

These data argue against induction of the pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 memory cells by a specific

234

cross-reactive antigen, but rather for arbitrary stochastic selection from a large memory

235

repertoire in adult humans. In support of this, SARS-CoV-2-reactive memory T cells expanded

236

from unexposed individuals displayed a 1-2 log lower functional avidity compared to COVID-

237

19 patients, which was in the same range as CMV-reactive T cells (Figure 4F, G). Taken

238

together, pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive memory T cells in unexposed donors are

239

common in humans and increase with the immunological age but do not display features of a

240

protective cross-reactive T cell population.

241
242

Robust memory T cell response to common cold corona viruses (CCCoVs)

243

Our data do not exclude the possibility that in some donors protective pre-existing immunity

244

may exist, for example due to infections with related common cold corona viruses (CCCoVs).

245

Since data on the prevalence of CCCoV-specific T cell memory are lacking, we next analysed

246

the response against spike proteins from the CCCoV strains 229E, OC43, HKU1 and NL63.

247

Strikingly, robust memory T cell responses were readily detected in all donors with frequencies

248

ranging between 1 in 103-104 (Figure 5A, B), which is in a similar range like against Influenza

249

A (Figure 1C), but up to 10-fold higher than SARS-CoV-2 spike-reactive T cells (Figure 5B).

250

CCCoV responses displayed a memory phenotype (Figure 5C, D), independent of

251

immunological age (Figure S5A), and high functional avidity (Figure 5E) in accordance with an

252

in vivo induction upon viral infection. Of note, expanded CCCoV-specific T cells from healthy

253

donors showed only marginal cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and vice

254

versa (Figure 5F, G). Furthermore, while the frequencies of reactive memory T cells between

255

the different CCCoVs showed strong linear correlation as an indicator of cross-recognition,

256

there was only a weak correlation between SARS-CoV-2 memory T cells and individual

257

CCCoV strains (Figure 5H), which was in fact similar to other non-related common viral

258

antigens (Figure S5B). To further analyse the potential relevance of pre-existing immunity to

259

the anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune reponse, we re-stimulated expanded SARS-CoV-2-specific T

260

cell lines from COVID-19 patients and unexposed donors (Figure 5I, J). Only minimal and

261

highly variable cross-reactivity against CCCoV strains, but also against CMV or Influenza A

262

were detected in COVID-19 patients, as well as in expanded cells from unexposed individuals,

263

adding up to maximally 5% of the total response in individual donors (Figure 5I).

264

Taken together these data clearly argue against a strong protective effect of pre-existing

265

immunity in general and specifically against a major protective contribution of CCCoVs to the

266

T cell response against SARS-CoV-2 in unexposed donors, as well as in COVID-19 patients.

267
268

Increased, but unfocussed and low affinity CD4+ T cell response against SARS-CoV-2

269

in severe disease

270

Although we essentially excluded a general protective effect of pre-existing immunity we

271

demonstrated that cross-reactive memory T cells against SARS-CoV-2 antigens are common

272

in humans, increase with the immunological age and display rather low functional avidity. So

273

far, the consequences of this stochastic pre-existing memory are unclear. Since elderly suffer

274

more frequent from severe disease, we next compared the response of patients with mild

275

versus severe disease. Classification was based on WHO criteria, whereby WHO groups 3-5

276

(moderate) and 6-7 (severe) were combined to increase statistical power (see Table S1).

277

Interestingly, frequencies of reactive T cells against the single and pooled SARS-CoV-2

278

proteins, but not against Influenza A antigens positively correlated with disease severity

279

(Figure 6A). This was not due to an age bias in severe disease as shown for a selected group

of donors in the age range of 50-65 years (Figure 6B, C). Instead, we observed a clearly

281

increased immunological age of hospitalized versus non-hospitalized patients within the same

282

age group (Figure 6D).

283

To test whether the immunological age-related cross-reactive memory may impact on COVID-

284

19 severity, we also compared TCR avidities and clonalities of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells

285

from hospitalized versus non-hospitalized patients. Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells

286

from hospitalized patients displayed significantly lower functional avidity compared to non-

287

hospitalized patients (Figure 6E-G). In line with this, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells from

288

hospitalized COVID-19 patients displayed a trend towards a more diverse TCR repertoire

289

(Figure 6H) and reduced clonal expansions, as indicated by the lower Gini coefficient, as a

290

measure of the eveness of a population (Figure 6I). However, this was not significant due to

291

one outlier (grey dot in Figure 6G-I, see below). Thus despite strongly increased T cell

292

frequencies in severe COVID-19 (Figure 6A), this increase did not result from an expansion of

293

individual clones, but instead reflected a broad polyclonal response. We next analyzed the

294

distribution of the most clonally expanded TCRs per patient within the different clusters of the

295

single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. Interestingly, we observed a tendency that in mild

296

disease the most expanded clones were mainly restricted to the cytotoxic cluster, whereas in

297

more severe disease, they were scattered over several clusters (Figure 6J, K). One severe

298

COVID-19 patient (grey dot in Figure 6G-I) did not fit into this scheme and also showed a high

299

clonality strongly focused to the cytotoxic cluster (Figure 6K, lower right). Interestingly this

300

patient suffered from a CMV reactivation, which may account for expansion of cross-reactive

301

clones. Still the cells from this donor were of low avidity for SARS-CoV-2 antigens (Figure 6G,

302

grey dot) confirming the robustness of the avidity data.

303

In summary our data suggest that severe COVID-19 disease is characterized by a strong but

304

rather unfocused virus-specific CD4+ T cell response involving a broad polyclonal repertoire

305

of rather low avidity T cells. Such unfocused, low avidity response may in fact result from

306

preferential recruitment of a broad pre-existing memory repertoire preferentially present in the

307

elderly.

Discussion

310

Defining the parameters contributing to the high clinical variability of COVID-19 is essential to

311

predict disease outcome and develop effective therapeutic and vaccination strategies. Here

312

we provide two key observations, suggesting a negative impact of pre-existing T cell memory

313

which may explain the age-bias of COVID-19 severity: First, we show that all COVID-19

314

patients generate strong pro-inflammatory T cells responses, that increased with disease

315

severity. Unexpectedly, severe disease is associated with lower functional avidity and TCR

316

clonality. Second, we identify SARS-CoV-2 “pre-existing” T cell memory as a common feature

317

related to the immunological age of an individual, which recapitulates the low functional avidity

318

found in severe COVID-19 and suggests a causative relation.

319

Our cytometric and single-cell RNA sequencing characterization of SARS-CoV-2 memory T

320

cells confirmed previous results showing common characteristics of an anti-viral T cell

321

response but did not identify clear-cut differences between severe and mild disease.

322

Surprisingly, similar cell clusters were present in SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells from

323

unexposed controls. Thus quantitative differences rather than unique functionality profiles

324

develop in COVID-19. Indeed, all COVID-19 patients develop strong, pro-inflammatory Th1-

325

like CD4+ T cell responses directed against the three main proteins spike, membrane and

326

Ncap, as shown before for convalescent patients (Grifoni et al., 2020). Interestingly, despite

327

the reported T cell lymphopenia in severe disease, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell frequencies

328

increased with disease severity (Anft et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020). Compared to other

329

common viruses SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells showed signs of recent activation, such as

330

CD38, Ki-67 and PD1, as well as CD154 and high IL-21 production indicative of B cell helper

331

function. Also the slightly reduced expression of cytokines like IFN-g, TNF-a and IL-2 compared

332

to other anti-viral responses may be related to the recent activation. Thus the T cell response

333

phenotype per se does not explain disease severity but will require detailed longitudinal

334

analysis in the future. The preferential formation of a highly focused clonal T cell population

335

within the cytotoxic cluster in mild COVID-19 suggests their potential protective function, which

336

may deserve further detailled analysis, including their peptide specificities.

337

We also characterized pre-existing memory as one factor for quantitative differences in the T

338

cell response in mild versus severe disease. The observation that SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells

339

were found in a subset of unexposed donors (Braun et al., 2020; Grifoni et al., 2020; Le Bert

340

et al., 2020; Mateus et al., 2020; Meckiff et al., 2020; Sekine et al., 2020; Weiskopf et al., 2020),

341

has initially fueled the hypothesis of protective pre-existing immunity, for example induced by

342

related CCCoVs preferentially in young people (Braun et al., 2020; Mateus et al., 2020). Such

343

heterologous immunity between related pathogens has been previously demonstrated mainly

344

in infection models (Welsh et al., 2010) but may also modulate human immune responses

345

(Bacher et al., 2019; Gras et al., 2010; Hayward et al., 2015; Koutsakos et al., 2019; Sridhar

346

et al., 2013). So far, cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells was poorly characterized

347

and their functional impact remained unknown. In line with our results, a weak correlation

348

between CCCoV and SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses in unexposed donors has been identified

349

and cross-reactivity to CCCoV was observed in SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell lines directed

350

against the most homologous part of spike proteins (Braun et al., 2020) or selected

351

homologous peptides (Mateus et al., 2020). Our more detailled analysis of cross-reactivity in

352

healthy and COVID-19 patients argues against a major role of CCCoVs: Pre-existing memory

353

T cells were detected in all unexposed donors and their frequencies correlated with the

354

immunological age but not with CCCoV-specific memory. Furthermore pre-existing memory

355

cells displayed low functional avidity and were less focused on the dominant COVID-19 targets

356

spike, membrane and Ncap protein (Figure 1D) (Grifoni et al., 2020; Le Bert et al., 2020). Most

357

importantly, CCCoV cross-reactivity both within SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells from COVID-19

358

patients, as well as unexposed donors, was marginal despite the ubiquitous presence of a

359

strong CCCoV-specific memory T cell response in all tested donors. Interestingly, also Mateus

360

et al. found that SARS-CoV-2-specific, but not cross-reactive T cells against the homologous

361

CCCoV peptides increased in COVID-19 patients (Mateus et al., 2020), supporting our finding.

362

Thus CCCoV-specific T cell memory is common in the human population but seems to have

363

minimal impact on SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. It is important to mention that our

364

demonstration of strong T cell memory against all four CCCoV strains in all tested donors may

365

be an encouraging sign that protective cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 might also

366

persist longterm, even if antibody responses are transient (Seow, 2020).

367

An even more important role of pre-existing memory in COVID-19 and for human immunity in

368

general is emerging from our analysis. In contrast to previous reports we find memory T cells

369

against SARS-CoV-2 in all tested unexposed donors. This probably reflects the high sensitivity

370

and specificity of the ARTE assay. In fact, lack of magnetic pre-selection, prolonged stimulation

371

times and the use of frozen PBMC may limit sensitivity and specificity (Bacher and Scheffold,

372

2013, 2015). However, this pre-existing memory does not represent classical heterologous

373

immunity between related pathogens. Instead, pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 memory has features

374

of an unbiased, stochastic cross-reactivity within a large TCR repertoire similar as observed

375

against other neoantigens. This is supported by its ubiquitous presence and broad protein

376

specificity (Figure 1D) as well as its strong positive correlation with total CD4+ memory (Figure

377

4D, E). Especially the low functional avidity argues against in vivo affinity selection (Figure 4G)

378

(Bacher et al., 2016). Memory T cells against neo-antigens are commonly detected in humans

379

(Bacher et al., 2013; Campion et al., 2014; Kwok et al., 2012; Su et al., 2013). This can be

380

explained by the known TCR-intrinsic cross-reactivity against related and even unrelated but

381

structurally similar peptides (Birnbaum et al., 2014; Sewell, 2012). Thus a highly diverse

382

memory pool, which accumulates in humans over lifetime contains TCRs specific for neo-

383

antigens similar to the naïve T cell pool.

384

The impact of pre-existing memory on T cell responses against neoantigens in humans is

385

poorly understood. However, its correlation with the immunological age suggests increasing

386

impact in the elderly (Lanzer et al., 2018; Lanzer et al., 2014; Woodland and Blackman, 2006)

387

and it is tempting to speculate that this may contribute to the increased risk for severe COVID-

388

19 in the aged population. Since memory T cells have a lower activation threshold, a large

389

number of suboptimal low avidity memory cells may compete and prevent naïve T cell

390

activation and high affinity selection (Lanzer et al., 2018). Indeed the size of the naïve T cell

391

pool has been shown to correspond to vaccination success (Kwok et al., 2012; Schulz et al.,

392

2015; Woodland and Blackman, 2006). Thus we hypothesize that pre-existing memory may

393

contribute to the reduced avidity and higher diversity of TCRs in severe COVID-19. Such a

394

polyclonal and low avidity T cell response may also be less susceptible to intrinsic negative

395

control mechansims, which may explain the increased SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cell response.

396

Pre-existing memory indeed represents a general mechanism of immune-modulation towards

397

neo-antigens, especially in the elderly (Woodland and Blackman, 2006). Provided the great

398

heterogeneity within the human population with regard to antigen exposure and MHC

399

composition, we expect in fact highly variable and context-dependent effects of pre-existing

400

memory from protective to harmful. Therefore the impact of pre-existing memory on

401

neoantigen exposure, including sensitizing antigens, infections or vaccinations, as well as for

402

autoantigens has to be carefully evaluated in future studies.

780

(Identifier of the University of Cologne Ethics Committee 08-160) and signed informed

781

consents.

782

Peripheral EDTA blood samples were collected between April and July 2020 from 49 COVID-

783

19 patients and from 50 in-house volunteers as unexposed controls (Table S1). 44 of 49

784

COVID-19 patients were tested positive and for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We included 5 mild cases

785

of COVID-19 without positive SARS-CoV2 RNA test, but with positive detection of antibodies

786

using a certified antibody test (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Roche Diagnostics GmbH,

787

Mannheim, Germany) who had clinical symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and a traceable

788

contact person found positive.

789

All, except three active COVID-19 patients who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA test, were

790

tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Roche Diagnostics

791

GmbH and/ or Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA, Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany). All healthy controls

792

were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Roche

793

803

Peptide pools of control antigens Influenza A H1N1 (HA, MP1, MP2, NP and NA), CMV (pp65,

804

IE-1), EBV (EBNA1, BZLF1, LMP2A, LMP1), AdV (Hexon) were purchased from Miltenyi

805

Biotec and CCCoV Spike proteins (229E, OC43, HKU1, NL63) from JPT. Pools were

806

resuspended according to manufacturer´s instructions and cells were stimulated at a

807

concentration of 0.5 µg/peptide/ml. Tetanus-toxoid was purchased from Statens Serum

808

Institute and used at a concentration of 10µg/ml.

810

Antigen-reactive T cell enrichment (ARTE)

811

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were freshly isolated from 20-50ml EDTA blood on the day

812

of blood donation by density gradient centrifugation (Biocoll; Biochrom, Berlin, Germany).

813

Antigen-reactive T cell enrichment (ARTE) was performed as previously described (Bacher et

814

al., 2019; Bacher et al., 2016). In brief, 0.5-2×10e7 PBMCs were plated in RPMI-1640 medium

815

(GIBCO), supplemented with 5% (v/v) human AB-serum (Sigma Aldrich, Schnelldorf,

816

Germany) at a cell density of 1×10e7 PBMCs / 2 cm2 in cell culture plates and stimulated for

817

7 hr in presence of 1 µg/ml CD40 and 1 µg/ml CD28 pure antibody (both Miltenyi Biotec,

818

Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). 1 µg/ml Brefeldin A (Sigma Aldrich) was added for the last 2

819

hr.

820

Cells were labeled with CD154-Biotin followed by anti-Biotin (CD154 MicroBead Kit, Miltenyi

821

Biotec) and magnetically enriched by two sequential MS columns (Miltenyi Biotec). Surface

822

staining was performed on the first column, followed by fixation and intracellular staining on

823

the second column. Frequencies of antigen-specific T cells were determined based on the cell

824

count of CD154+ T cells after enrichment, normalized to the total number of CD4+ T cells

825

applied on the column. For each stimulation, CD154+ background cells enriched from the non-

826

stimulated control were subtracted.

827
828

Flow cytometry

829

Cells were stained in different combinations of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies (see Key

830

Resources Table). Viobility 405/520 Fixable Dye (Miltenyi Biotec) was used to exclude dead

831

cells. For intracellular staining cells were fixed and permeabilized with the Inside stain Kit

832

(Miltenyi Biotec). Data were acquired on a or LSR Fortessa (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA,

833

USA). Screening of expanded T cell lines on 384-well plates was performed on a

834

MACSQuantX Analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec). FlowJo (Treestar, Ashland, OR, USA) software was

835

used for analysis.

838

For expansion of antigen-specific T cell lines, PBMCs were stimulated for 6 hr, CD154+ cells

839

were isolated by MACS and further purified by FACS sorting on a FACS Aria Fusion (BD

840

Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA) based on dual expression of CD154 and CD69. Purified

841

CD154+ T cells were expanded in presence of 1:100 autologous antigen-loaded irradiated

842

feeder cells in TexMACS medium (Miltenyi Biotec), supplemented with 5% (v/v) human AB-

843

serum (GemCell), 200 U/ml IL-2 (Proleukin; Novartis, Nürnberg, Germany), and 100 IU/ml

844

penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 µg/ml amphotericin B (Antibiotic Antimycotic Solution,

845

Sigma Aldrich) at a density of 2.5×106 cells/cm2. During expansion for 2-3 weeks, medium

846

was replenished and cells were split as needed.

847

For re-stimulation, fastDCs were generated from autologous CD14+ MACS isolated

848

monocytes (CD14 MicroBeads; Miltenyi Biotec) by cultivation in X-Vivo™15 medium

849

(BioWhittaker/Lonza), supplemented with 1000 IU/ml GM-CSF and 400 IU/ml IL-4 (both

850

Miltenyi Biotec). Before re-stimulation expanded T cells were rested in RPMI-1640 + 5 %

851

human AB-serum without IL-2 for 2 days. 0.5-1×10e5 expanded T cells were plated with

852

fastDCs in a ratio 1:1 of in 384-well flat bottom plates and re-stimulated for 6 h, with 1 µg/ml

853

Brefeldin A (Sigma Aldrich) added for the last 4 hr.

854
855

Cell isolation and single-cell RNA-seq assay (10x Genomics)

856

For single cell transcriptomics, CD154+ cells were isolated by MACS and further purified by

857

FACS sorting on a MACSQuant Tyto (Miltenyi Biotec) based on dual expression of CD154 and

858

CD69. Sorted CD154+ T cells were removed from the sorting chamber into pre-coated low-

859

bind collection tubes, 1ml RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 5% AB Serum was added,

860

and cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 400 x g, 4°C. The supernatant was carefully removed

861

leaving 10-30μl to reach a maximum concentration of 1000 cells /µl.

862

Single-cell suspensions were loaded on a Chromium Chip G (10x Genomics) according to the

863

manufacturer’s instructions for processing with the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 5′ Library

864

and Gel Bead Kit v1.1. Depending on the number of cells available for each patient, a

865

maximum of 30,000 cells were loaded for each reaction. TCR single-cell libraries were

866

subsequently prepared from the same cells with the Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Enrichment

867

Kit, Human T Cell. Libraries were sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 machine with 2x100

868

bp for gene expression, aiming for 50,000 reads per cell and 2x150 bp and 5000 reads per cell

869

for TCR libraries.

870
871

Single cell T cell receptor (TCR) sequence analysis

872

Single-cell T-cell receptor repertoire clonotype tables were generated using the VDJ command

873

of the Cellranger software, version 3.1.0. from 10xGenomics and using the reference GRCh38

874

version 2.0.0. Clonotype tables were filtered in order to include only cells which passed quality

875

filtering in the gene expression analysis. In addition, clonotypes were stringently filtered for

876

possible doublets by removing clonotypes (i) found in 1 cell only and containing more than 1

877

TCR alpha and 1 TCR beta (ii) containing more than 1 TCR alpha and no TCR beta sequence

878

(iii) containing more than 1 TCR beta and no TCR alpha sequence (iv) containing more than 2

879

TCR alpha or more than 2 TCR beta sequences.

880

Alpha diversity measures were calculated for each patient either for the whole repertoire or

881

divided based on Seurat clusters. R packages “vegan” and “tcR” were used to calculate the

882

Inverse Simpson diversity index and the Gini inequality index, respectively. For these analyses

883

samples were normalized by selection of the most abundant 50 clonotypes in order to remove

884

the impact of different sample sizes (number of cells per sample) and to analyze only the

885

distribution of the most expanded clonotypes.

886

Analysis of the most expanded clonotypes was conducted by selecting the 3 most expanded

887

clonotypes per sample. To evaluate potentially existing preferential cumulation of most

888

expanded clonotypes in certain functional clusters, the proportion of cells carrying these

889

clonotypes falling in each distinct Seurat cluster was calculated.

890
891

Single-cell transcriptome analysis

892

The preprocessing of the scRNA-data was performed with the 10x Genomics’ Cell Ranger

893

software v3.1.0 using the reference GRCh38 v3.0.0 for the mappings. The resulting filtered

894

feature-barcode matrix files were analyzed with the R package Seurat v.3.2.0 (Butler et al.,

895

2018). Thereby, all genes with a detected expression in less than 0.1% of the non-empty cells

896

were excluded. Moreover, TCR genes were not considered for further analyses to avoid

897

functional clustering of cells based on TCR information. To minimize the number of doublets,

898

empty cells, and cells with a transcriptome in low quality, only cells harboring between 840

899

(minimum median among samples) and 3000 RNA features and less than 5% mitochondrial

900

RNA were selected for further processing. Afterwards, data were log-normalized and scaled

901

based on all genes. After performing a PCA dimensionality reduction (20 dimensions) with the

902

RunPCA function, the expression values were corrected for effects caused by different sample

903

preparation time points in time using the R package Harmony v1.0 (Korsunsky et al., 2019). In

904

the final steps, the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensional

905

reduction was performed with the RunUMAP function using 20 dimensions, a shared nearest

906

neighbor graph was created with the FindNeighbors method, and the clusters identification

907

was performed with a resolution of 0.2 using the FindClusters function. Positive cluster marker

908

genes were determined using FindMarkers with the MAST method (Finak et al., 2015).

909

Thereby, only genes with detected expression in at least 25% of the cells in the respective

910

cluster were considered.
