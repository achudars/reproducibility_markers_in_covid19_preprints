Abstract
Background: Italy and especially the Lombardy region is experiencing a heavy burden of Covid-19 infection. The
peak of the epidemics has not yet been reached and it is expected to be delayed in Central and Southern Italian
regions compared to Northern ones. We have modeled the Covid-19 outbreak progression in Italian Regions vs.
Lombardy. Methods. In our models, we have estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) -which represents the
average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection - both by fitting
the exponential growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period and also by using day by day assessment,
based on single observations. We used the susceptible–exposed–infected–removed (SEIR) compartment model to
predict the spreading of the pandemic in Italy. Results. The two methods provide agreements of values, although
the first method based on exponential fit should provide a better estimation, being computed on the entire time
series. Taking into account the growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period, in Lombardy each infected
person has involved other 5 people (4.94 base on data of March 22nd vs. 5.07 based on data of March 19th)
compared to a value of ଴  2.68 reported in the Chinese city of Whuan. According to our model and Piedmont,
Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Marche reach an R0 value up to 4. The R0 is 3.7 for Lazio and 3.6 for
Campania region, where this latter shows the highest value among the Southern Italian regions, followed by Apulia
(3.5), Sicily (3.4), Abruzzo (3.4), Calabria (3.1), Basilicata (2.5) and Molise (2.4). The value of R0 is decreasing in
Lombardy and Northern Regions, while it is increasing in Central and Southern Regions. Conclusion. The
expected peak of SEIR model can be forecast by the last week of March at national level, and by the first weeks of
April in Southern Italian Regions. These kind of models can be useful for adoption of all the possible preventive
measures, and to assess the epidemics progression across Southern regions as opposed to the Northern ones.

Epidemiological figures
TH

According to the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS), at the date of March 19

in Italy there were

35731 people who were tested positive to Wuhan novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Men were 20686 and

women were 14378. Women are the majority of cases in the age group 20-29 (n=732 females vs. 603

males) and >90

years old (n=694 females

vs. 397

males); women and men are equally

distributed

between 30-39 and 40-49 years old (n=1202 females vs. 1261 males, and n=2123 females vs.2186 males,

respectively), while men represent the majority of casesin all the other age groups (n=118 vs 84 from 0

to the age of 9; n=150 vs. 117 between 10 and 19 years old; n=3775 vs. 2926 from 50 to 59 years of age;

Based on these figures, it is clear that the Covid-19 outbreak is now putting overwhelming pressure
mainly on Lombardy and Northern regions of the Po Valley (Padana plain), but the peak of the epidemics
has not yet been reached. Until now, Southern Regions seem to be less affected by the Covid-19
infection although a huge number of people - mainly students attending Universities in Northern Italy came back from Po Valley to their families in the South just in the middle of the outbreak, thus
representing a potential factor able to accelerate the spreading of the viral infection.
Here we present an attempt to predict the peak of the outbreak in Italy, which is expected at national
level by the end of March, and the different progression of the epidemics in Southern Italian Regions
compared to Lombardy.

Modeling the Covid-19 outbreak progression in Southern Italian Regions vs. Lombardy
The basic reproduction number (R0) is an indicator that resumes the average number of people that can
be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection. R0 is a metric of how contagious is the
disease and its correct estimation is extremely important for epidemiologists, especially when facing
new diseases like COVID-19. R0 can be computed in different ways. In our models, we have estimated
the basic reproduction number (R0) both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a
1-month periodand also by using day by day assessment, based on single observations [1]. This study
makes use of the susceptible–exposed–infected–removed (SEIR) compartment model [4] to predict the
spreading of the pandemic in Italy. Our efforts could be helpfulin the adoption of all the possible
preventive measures, and to study of the epidemics progression across Southern regions as opposed to
the national trend. This metric can be biased by the optimal estimation of the basic reproductive
number R0 (pronounced R-nought). It must be said that R0 is important if correlated with weather
conditions and that reproductive index is reduced as the air temperature and relative humidity
increase,[5] according to the formula:

ܴ

= 3.968 − 0.0383

ܶ݁݉‫݁ݎݑݐܽݎ݁݌‬

− 0.0224

ܴ݈݁ܽ‫ݕݐ݅݀݅݉ݑܪ݁ݒ݅ݐ‬

.

This means the transmission of COVID-19 candecrease with the warmer season, and that at least some
specific figures of the outbreak in Lombardy and Po Valley can be explained taking into account climatic
variables.

Modeling basic reproductive number R0
Exponential framework estimation
The exponential estimation is based on the work of Wu et al[7], which essentially was based on that of
Zhao and colleagues[8], where the epidemic curve obey to the exponential growth.

At the date of this study (March 23rd2020), the epidemic growth was still near exponential growth,, aand
the fitted model has many inliers data points. The method is based on non-linear least square framewo
work
for intrinsic growth estimation , in order to obtain
probability distribution of the serial interval

with M the Laplace transformingg the

of the infection. The

estimation is obtained with 1000%

susceptibility for 2019-nCoV at the early stage in Wuhan as reported in [7]. In Figure 2, the

numb
mber

estimates are computed for the Southern Italian regions and for the initialoutbreak region (Lombard
rdy).
According to our model, in Lombardy, each infected person has involvedother 4.9 people (5.07). The
he R0
lowers to 3.6 for Campania region, which shows the highest value among the Southern Italian region
ions,
followed by Apulia (3.5), Sicily (3.4), Abruzzo (3.4), Calabria (3.2), Molise (2.4), and Basilicata (2.2).

Daily basis estimation of the reproductive number
R0 is an average value, but it can be also computed day by day to monitor the transmission off the
t
infection. Being an average value, it can be skewed by super-spreader events. A super-spreaderis
is an
infected individual who infects an unexpectedly large number of people. In Italy this event can be also
al
generated not necessarily by an individual, but from the perturbation of a susceptible population, as it
happened in Apulia and Sicily with uncontrolled large group of people coming from outbreak areas. For
Fo a
“super spreader” individual, such events are not necessarily a bad sign, because they can indicate that
th
fewer people are perpetuating an epidemic. Super-spreaders may also be easier to identify and conta
ntain,
since their symptoms are likely to be more severe. In short, R0 is a moving target. Tracking every ca
case
and the transmission of a disease is extremely difficult, so the estimation of R0 is a complex aand
challenging issue: estimates often change as new data becomes available. If we define the Y(t) ass tthe
number of infected people with symptom at time t, the exponential growth rate is

Modeling transmission in Italy

We used the susceptible-exposed-infectious- recovered (SEIR) model [4] to simulate epidemic since
ce it
was established on January 2020. It is based on a previous model SIR which was based on thr
three
compartments, but since the infection has an incubation period, the compartment E (Exposed) is include
uded.
This compartments are modeled over the time, and capture the changes in the population. Let us say th
that
given N the total population, then N=S+E+I+R, where:
-

“S” Susceptible is the portion of population that does not have any vax coverage or immune;

-

“E” exposed: is the portion of the population that have been infected, but are in the incubation
period that do not infect others;

-

“I” Infectious: is the portion of N that is infectious and may infect others, they become dead or
may recover;

-

“R” Recovered: number of infectious people who have been healed, and become immune.

Figure 2 SEIR model with the four compartments and their relationships

This model captures dynamics of these compartments over the time by four ordinary different
ential
equations. One of the most important aspects of these ordinary differential equations is equilibrium,, w
who
is achieved by setting to zero their derivatives along the time t. The two equilibriums are: disease-fr
free
equilibrium (DFE) and endemic equilibrium (EE).

disease, then decrease with government control policy measures. The contact rate follow a logistic

We have considered as Exposed people, a number of twice Infected people, after lockdown which is in

reach the peak later, in the first days of April.
