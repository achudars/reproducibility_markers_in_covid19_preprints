LETTER:

15

To control the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, China undertook stringent

16

traffic restrictions and self-quarantine measures, first in Wuhan and neighboring cities beginning

17

on January 23, 2020, and two days later, in all provinces in China (Figure 1A). The countrywide

18

ban on traffic mobility greatly limited transportation emissions, whereas emissions from

19

residential heating and industry remained steady or slightly declined.1 We herein examine the

20

change in air pollution levels and the potentially avoided cause-specific mortality during this

21

massive population quarantine episode.

22

As of March 14, 2020, new confirmed COVID-19 cases in China reported by the National

23

Health Commission (NHC) dropped to 20 (4 from Wuhan) (Figure 1A). Most Chinese provinces

24

have lowered the level of emergency responses. We thus defined the “during quarantine” period

25

as February 10 to March 14 and the “before quarantine” period as January 5 to 20. We excluded

26

the Chinese New Year holidays to avoid non-quarantine related air pollution reductions, based

27

on evidence from previous years (Figure 1B). We obtained daily concentrations of nitrogen

28

dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in 367 Chinese cities. We then applied a

29

difference-in-difference approach to quantify air pollution changes due to the quarantine.

30

Specifically, we calculated changes in air quality during vs. before the quarantine period in 2020,

31

and compared these with corresponding changes in the same lunar calendar periods in 2016-

32

2019. Details of the material, methods, and numeric results are provided in the Supplementary

33

Appendix.

34

We found that, due to the quarantine, NO2 dropped by 22.8 µg/m3 and 12.9 µg/m3 in Wuhan and

35

China, respectively. PM2.5 dropped by 1.4 µg/m3 in Wuhan but decreased by 18.9 µg/m3 across

36

367 cities. The dramatic decline in NO2 across China during the quarantine period was also

37

detected by the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite using the NO2 tropospheric column density

38

(Figure 1C).

39

We then calculated the avoided cause-specific mortality attributable to these decreases in NO2

40

and PM2.5 over China based on the concentration-response functions from a previous study of

41

272 Chinese cities, and the cause-specific mortality data from the China Health and Family

42

Planning Statistical Yearbook 2018.2,3 We estimate that improved air quality during the

43

quarantine period avoided a total of 8911 [95 confidence interval (CI): 6950, 10866] NO2-related

44

deaths, 65% of which were from cardiovascular diseases (hypertensive disease, coronary heart

45

disease, and stroke) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), (Figure 1D). Further,

46

we estimate that PM2.5 reductions during the quarantine period avoided a total of 3214 (95% CI:

47

2340, 4087) PM2.5-related deaths in China, 73% of which were from cardiovascular diseases and

48

COPD. These numbers should be interpreted with caution due to the potential overlap between

49

PM2.5- and NO2-related mortality and the disrupted healthcare systems during quarantine to

50

conduct a timely treatment for patients with chronic diseases.

51

We conclude that interventions to contain the COVID-19 outbreak led to air quality

52

improvements that brought health benefits which outnumbered the confirmed deaths due to

53

COVID-19 in China (3199 deaths as of March 14, 2020).4 These findings illustrate the

54

substantial human health benefits related to cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality that

55

can be achieved when aggressive air pollution control measures are taken to reduce emissions

56

from vehicles, such as through climate mitigation-related traffic restrictions or efforts to

57

accelerate the transition to electric vehicles.
