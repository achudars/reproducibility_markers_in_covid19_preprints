Abstract
Objective: To rapidly identify areas of need and improve care in people with
Parkinson’s disease (PwPD) affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, we deployed a
survey focusing on the presentation and complications of COVID-19 infection and the
effect of the COVID-19 pandemic among those not infected.
Methods: Individuals with and without PD participating in the online study Fox Insight
(FI) were invited to complete an online survey between April 23-May 23, 2020. Among
people reporting COVID-19 diagnosis, we compared the frequency of symptoms and
poor outcomes in people with and without PD. Among people not reporting COVID-19,
we assessed the effects of the pandemic on access to medical care and other services,
and in PwPD, its effects on PD symptoms.
Results: Among 5,429 PwPD and 1,452 without PD, 77 reported a COVID-19 diagnosis
(51 PwPD, 26 without PD). Complications were more frequent in people with longer PD
duration. PwPD and COVID-19 experienced new or worsening motor (63%) and
nonmotor (75%) PD symptoms. PwPD not diagnosed with COVID-19 reported disrupted
medical care (64%), exercise (21%), and social activities (57%), and worsened PD
motor (43%) and non-motor (52%) symptoms. Disruptions were more common for
PwPD living alone, and for those with lower income and non-white race.
Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with wide-ranging effects on
people with PD, and certain groups may be at particular risk. FI provides a rapid,
patient-centered means to assess these effects and identify needs that can be used to
improve the health of PwPD.

Introduction

SARS-CoV-2 infection and the societal changes associated with the COVID-19
pandemic may have particularly severe consequences for people with chronic
neurologic diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). Many people with PD (PwPD)
are concerned about COVID-19 risk,1 and indeed early reports2-4 describe worsening of
parkinsonian symptoms during infection and poor outcomes in some cases. Among
those not infected, social distancing guidelines may lead to social isolation, a known risk
factor for poor outcomes,5 and reduced access to care,6 all of which are additional
concerns of PwPD.1 Rapid changes in healthcare delivery to PwPD have been
developed, including recommendations on implementing telemedicine7 and managing
advanced therapies remotely,8, 9 but these resources are not universally available.10 The
persistent spread of the pandemic and the associated global disruption highlight the
urgent need for increased understanding of its effect and mitigating strategies in PwPD.

We surveyed participants in Fox Insight (FI), an online study that involves thousands of
people with and without PD,11 between April and May, 2020. Our goals were to (1)
understand the symptoms and outcomes of SARS CoV-2 infection in people with and
without PD, (2) determine its effects on PD symptoms; and (3) understand the effects of
the pandemic and associated public health measures. We were particularly interested in
how demographic factors, including age, sex, and socioeconomic factors, related to
disruptions from the pandemic.

Description of Fox Insight
Fox Insight (FI) is a fully remote study platform.12 Participants ≥18 years old with and
without PD complete surveys at regular intervals and are periodically invited to complete
additional surveys targeting particular topics.11

Survey design
This was a cross-sectional study. The COVID-19 survey was designed through an
iterative process involving multidisciplinary providers and clinical researchers with active
feedback on survey content and format from PwPD.

Study population and survey deployment
All FI participants were invited by email on April 23, 2020, with follow-up reminders on
May 1st and May 11th to participate in the COVID-19 survey. Because spread of the
pandemic and related attitudes, guidelines, and practices have changed rapidly, we
limited analyses to surveys completed between April 23rd and May 23rd, 2020. We
excluded respondents with missing diagnostic or demographic data in FI and those who
reported a diagnosis of PD before age 25.

Assessments
Participant information comes both from FI longitudinal study assessments and direct
questions of the COVID-19 survey. From FI, we obtained demographic information that
participants provide annually. For covariate analysis, older age was defined as more
than 65 years at completion of the survey. Respondents of “non-white race” include
those who did not identify as White and identified as another race (either African

American, Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander,
according to the choices in FI). Participants with a household income below $50,000,
representing roughly the lowest tertile of respondents, were classified as having lower
income. Several PD-related genes may be pertinent to COVID-19 infection: LRRK2
mutations may play a role in immunomodulation,13 while APOE e4 homozygosity has
been associated with increased COVID-19 risk14 and, along with GBA, may increase
susceptibility to cognitive impairment in PwPD.15 Genotype was therefore included for
the subset of PwPD in FI who had those data available.11 Information about PD
diagnosis was obtained both from FI and from our current survey; respondents with
conflicting answers were excluded.

All subsequent assessments of COVID-19 and the effect of the pandemic were obtained
through the deployed survey. We considered people to have COVID-19 if they reported
that a definite or probable COVID-19 diagnosis had been made by a medical
professional. People reporting a history of diabetes, HIV or AIDS, recent chemotherapy,
current treatment with oral steroids or other immune suppressants were classified as
immunocompromised. To understand how the pandemic is affecting both infected and
non-infected people with and without PD, the survey was divided into three sections: (1)
COVID-19 symptoms, diagnosis, testing, risk factors, and treatment; (2) change in PDrelated symptoms; and (3) effect of shelter-in-place orders and social distancing
practices on healthcare access, social interactions, and other essential activities (the full
survey is available online).16

Outcomes assessed in people with COVID-19 included development of pneumonia,
need for supplemental oxygen, hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission or
ventilator support. For people without COVID-19, we assessed pandemic-associated
disruption of medical care, daily essential activities, and exercise or social activities. We
evaluated changes in individual PD-related motor and non-motor symptoms by domain:
motor problems (imbalance, falling, tremor, slow movement, stiffness, dysphagia,
difficulty eating, increased OFF time, dyskinesia), cognitive problems (confusion,
hallucinations, difficulty thinking, memory problems), sleep problems (acting out
dreams, difficulty sleeping, excessive sleepiness, fatigue), mood symptoms (anxiety,
depression, apathy), and autonomic problems (urinary problems, orthostasis,
constipation).

Statistical analysis
Survey results and demographic information were summarized using descriptive
statistics. We evaluated differences in means of continuous variables using Student’s ttest for normally distributed data and Wilcoxon rank sum for non-normally distributed.
We used the chi-square test for comparison of categorical variables. For our main
results, we constructed logistic regression models adjusting for age and sex. For
COVID-19 related analyses, we performed sensitivity analyses restricting the cohort to
only those reporting a definite COVID-19 diagnosis or a positive COVID-19 test.
Participants who reported COVID-19 infection were excluded from analyses about the
effects of social distancing to reduce confounding. All analyses were performed using R
version 3.5.2 (12-20-2018). Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05.

Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents
The FI study and the survey for this COVID-19 study were approved by the New
England IRB and informed consent was obtained online from all participants.

Data Availability Policy
All survey questions and data are available for download online.16

Results
As of May 23, 2020, 7,209 people with and without PD responded, representing more
than 50% of the 14,166 Fox Insight participants active in the preceding 12 months.
Three-hundred and twenty-eight people were excluded for irreconcilable or missing
data, leaving 5,429 people with PD and 1,452 people without. Responses were from all
continents, but about 80% came from the United States (Figure 1). Respondents with
PD were older, more often female, had a higher prevalence of heart disease, a lower
prevalence of immunocompromising conditions and lung disease, and had lower
household income than people without PD (Table 1).

COVID-19 diagnoses were reported by 51 PwPD (22 definite, 29 probable) and 26
people without PD (7 definite, 19 probable). Positive tests were reported in 17 PwPD
and 6 without PD. One PwPD reported a positive COVID-19 test but was asymptomatic
and was not included in analyses of COVID-19-associated disease features. Among
PwPD, those with COVID-19 were more likely to smoke (5.9% vs 1.6%, p = 0.048) and
have a history of heart disease (20% vs 8.2%, p = 0.008). Compared to people without

PD who had COVID-19, PwPD who had COVID-19 were more likely to be older, male,
and less likely to have lung disease (Table 1).

Behavioral and environmental risk factors for COVID-19 were more common in people
without PD than PwPD: 100% of people without PD with COVID-19 reported a
professional or recreational activity that potentially put them at risk, whereas only 75%
of PwPD with COVID-19 could identify any such activity (p = 0.012). PwPD and COVID19 were more likely to have a household or other personal contact that was diagnosed
with, suspected to have, or had symptoms consistent with COVID-19 compared to
PwPD without COVID-19 (59% vs 7.7%, p < 0.001). The types of COVID-19 symptoms
were generally similar in PwPD and those without except for more frequent chills and
pulmonary symptoms in people without PD (Table 2). Among people with COVID-19,
the new onset of hyposmia was reported by 3.9% of PwPD and 7.7% of people without
PD, and worsening of existing hyposmia was reported by 26% of PwPD and 19.2% of
those without PD. Among people without COVID-19, new onset of hyposmia was
reported by 0.4% of PwPD and 0.2% of people without PD, and worsening of existing
hyposmia was reported by 3.1% of PwPD and 3.1% of people without PD. Among
people with COVID-19, there were slight differences in several reported outcomes
between those with and without PD, but none were statistically significant (Table 2).
Longer PD-duration was associated with a higher risk of pneumonia, the need for
supplemental oxygen, or hospitalization (44% among PwPD for greater than 9 years vs
14% among PwPD with equal to or less than 9 years, aOR 5.44, 95% CI 1.04 - 30.5, p=
0.043).

During COVID-19 infection, PwPD reported worsening of many PD-related symptoms
(Figure 2). New motor symptoms were reported by 18%, and 55% reported worsening
of at least one existing motor symptom. New and worsening non-motor symptoms were
reported for all domains: mood (20% new, 51% worsening), cognition (7.8% new, 41%
worsening), sleep (12% new, 59% worsening), and autonomic (7.8% new, 29%
worsening).

Among those without COVID-19, healthcare was altered due to the pandemic in 62% of
all respondents, including cancelled appointments, reduced in-home care or difficulty
obtaining medications. Only cancellations in rehabilitation services were more common
in PwPD (17% PwPD vs 5.5% not PD, p < 0.001). Among PwPD, disruption in medical
care was more likely in those with longer PD duration (41% PD duration > 9 years vs.
32% for PD duration 0-3 years, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.47, 95% CI 1.26 – 1.73, p
< 0.001) (Table 3). Race and lower income were independently associated with
difficulty obtaining PD medications (non-White race 13% vs 7.3%, aOR 1.98 95% CI
1.05 - 3.45, p = 0.023, and lower income 10% vs 7.2%, aOR 1.36, 95% CI 1.07 - 1.72, p
= 0.01); arguably more people of Latinx ethnicity reported difficulty obtaining
medications (14% vs 7.5%, 1.61, 95% CI 0.93 – 2.63, p = 0.07). Telemedicine
appointments were reported by 39% of PwPD, but those with lower household income
were less likely to attend healthcare appointments through telemedicine (40% vs 35%,
aOR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69, 0.90, p = <0.001).

At least one essential daily activity was disrupted in 35% of PwPD. Essential daily
activities were more often disrupted in PwPD who live alone compared to other PwPD,

including getting food (12% vs 8.7%, aOR 1.50, 95% CI 1.14 – 1.94, p = 0.003) and
getting regular homecare / housekeeping 15% vs 9.0%, aOR 1.50, 95% 1.16 - 1.91, p =
0.001). Other regular behaviors disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic included
cancelled exercise (21% PwPD) and social activities (57%), although many people
found alternative ways, such as online classes, to continue these activities (Table 4).
PwPD with lower income were less likely to report alternative means of exercising (32%
vs 44%, aOR 0.57, 0.50 – 0.66, p<0.001) or social activities (49% vs 58%, aOR 0.66,
0.58 – 0.76, p <0.001); older PwPD were less likely to use alternative ways to exercise
(39% vs 44%, aOR 0.82 (95% CI 0.73, 0.93), p=0.002).

The pandemic was also disruptive to research participation among the cohort. Among
the 16% of PwPD without COVID-19 who had been participating in research, 40% had
to cancel and 35% had to postpone in-person research visits, while 25% were able to
conduct research visits through alternative methods. Overall, 6.3% of PwPD felt that the
COVID-19 pandemic had made them more likely to participate in research, while 11%
felt that the pandemic had made them less likely to participate, and 83% reported no
change in their likelihood to participate in research.

Among PwPD who did not have COVID-19, new PD symptoms emerged and existing
symptoms worsened in all major domains (motor: 6.2% new, 41% worsened; mood: 6.5
% new, 30 % worsened; cognitive: 2.5 % new, 16 % worsened; sleep: 4.5% new, 32%
worsened; autonomic: 2.6% new, 18% worsened (Figure 3). Respondents who
experienced interruptions to PD-related medical care were also more likely to
experience new or worsening symptoms in all domains (motor symptoms: 56% vs 36%,

aOR 2.21, 95% CI 1.97 – 2.48, p<0.001; cognitive problems: 24% vs 14%, aOR 1.92,
95% CI 1.66-2.22, p<0.001; mood symptoms: 42% vs 30%, aOR 1.70, 95% CI 1.511.92, p <0.001; autonomic symptoms: 27% vs 17%, aOR 1.75, 95% CI 1.53-2.00, p
<0.001; and sleep problems: 42% vs 31%, aOR 1.60, 95% CI 1.42-1.79 p <0.001). New
onset motor symptoms in particular were more likely in those that had disruption of
medical care (8.2% vs 5.1% aOR 1.63, 95% CI 1.31-2.04, p < 0.001). Respondents who
experienced interruptions to exercise, social activities or were asked to self-isolate were
also more likely to report worsening of PD symptoms (Table 5). Neither the number of
APOE e4 alleles nor PD-associated mutations in LRRK2 were associated with an
increased risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19, and the number of APOE e4 alleles
and GBA mutations were not associated with new or worsening PD-related symptoms
during the pandemic.

Women with COVID-19 more often reported new or worsening cognitive symptoms
(67% women vs 25% men, aOR 6.00, 95% CI 1.82 – 22.3, p = 0.005). New or
worsening symptoms were also more common in women with PD but without COVID19: motor symptoms (49% women vs 38% men, aOR 1.63, 95% CI 1.46 - 1.81. p
<0.001), mood symptoms (42% women vs 27% men, aOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.69 – 2.12,
p<0.001), sleep problems (39% women vs 31% men, aOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.28 - 1.60, p
<0.001), and autonomic problems (23% women vs 18% men, aOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.17 –
1.52, p < 0.001). In analyses adjusting for social factors more commonly experienced by
women with PD (living alone, disrupted home care, interruptions in medical care),
women with and without COVID-19 were still at greater risk of symptom worsening.

Discussion
This large, participant reported study demonstrates the profound effect COVID-19 has
had on individuals with PD. Thousands of people completed the survey in just a few
weeks, illustrating the value of online research in providing rapid responses from an
engaged community despite limits to in-person interactions.

Both motor and non-motor symptoms of PD worsened during SARS-CoV-2 infection,
including stiffness, tremor, difficulty walking, mood symptoms, cognition, and fatigue.
Others have similarly reported worsening of PD-related symptoms either as presenting
signs of COVID-194 or during the course of the infection.2, 3 Worsening of PD symptoms
is commonly experienced in PwPD who have infectious illnesses,17 possibly due to
systemic inflammation, altered dopaminergic signaling, or changes in medication
absorption or pharmacokinetics.18 Worsening of symptoms due to a direct infection of
the CNS by SARS-CoV-2 is less likely. Although COVID-19 has been associated with
changes on neuroimaging19, 20 and SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in
cerebrospinal fluid,21, 22 a recent autopsy series of patients that died with COVID-19 —
all of whom experienced altered mental status — did not find immunohistochemical
evidence of encephalitis or viral invasion into brain tissue.23 Exacerbation of PD
symptoms during COVID-19 may in part be due to the inflammatory reaction
characteristic of the disease.24 The consistent reporting of symptom exacerbation in
PwPD due to COVID-19 emphasizes the need to consider COVID-19 as a possible
explanation for suddenly worsening PD-related symptoms.

Hyposmia has been well described in people with COVID-19.25 Although objective
testing was not performed, respondents with and without PD who reported COVID-19
also reported new onset hyposmia. Interestingly, even PwPD who already had
hyposmia reported worsening of this symptom. A minority of people without COVID-19
also experienced worsening of sense of smell, possibly representing undiagnosed
SARS-CoV-2 infection.26

A greater proportion of women than men with PD reported COVID-19. Other case series
of PwPD and COVID-19 have not shown an excess of women,2, 3 though our study did
capture more people. Women are relatively over-represented in the FI population27 and
may be more likely to respond to surveys, but this tendency should be equally
distributed in those with and without COVID-19. Men with COVID-19 have been
reported to have more severe disease than women,28, 29 while women may be more
susceptible.30 Women with COVID-19 may be over-represented in our study because
they had relatively milder disease, and were therefore more able to answer surveys
than men. Women with PD without COVID-19 reported worsening or new onset of PD
symptoms more often than men without COVID-19 in all domains except cognition.
Other studies have similarly suggested that women with PD report more mood
symptoms31 32 and fewer cognitive problems33 than men, and our findings may be more
reflective of differences in symptoms between men and women with PD rather than
reflecting changes due to the pandemic.

A recent report suggested that COVID-19 infection is more common in people
homozygous for APOE e4.14 Among the PwPD with genetic testing available, no one

related to the risk of COVID-19 or symptomatic worsening during the pandemic.
However, as the prevalence of these mutations is low, our sample size may not have
been big enough to detect a difference in associated risk.

Among those with COVID-19, outcomes were largely similar between people with and
without PD. Longer PD-duration was associated with a higher risk for poor outcomes.
Similarly, a series of 10 cases identified through hospitals in Padua, Italy, and London,
UK, suggested that PwPD of longer duration may be at risk of more severe illness and
mortality from COVID-19.2 Preliminary reports from the CDC indicate that a high
proportion of people with COVID-19 and neurologic disorders require hospitalization,34
and severity of other neurologic conditions has been associated with complications of
COVID-19.35 Although the number of PwPD and COVID-19 studied is small,
consistency among reports suggests that complications may be more frequent in
advanced PwPD.

The vast majority of PwPD did not have COVID-19, yet most reported significant
disruptions in many aspects of their daily lives due to the pandemic and consequent
public health precautions. Longer disease duration and living alone increased the risk of
disruption to medical care or other essential activities, indicating that these groups may
need specific attention. Non-white race and lower household income were
independently associated with difficulty obtaining medications, a particularly concerning
finding that highlights the presence of barriers to healthcare access even among an

online research cohort, and that these barriers are exacerbated during the pandemic.
People with lower income were also less likely to find alternative means to conduct
exercise and social activities and were less likely to use telemedicine. Among those with
PD, lower socioeconomic status may already be associated with poor outcomes such
as earlier exit from the work force36 and higher mortality risk.37 The rapid transformation
of healthcare delivery increases access for many through telemedicine alternatives and
will hopefully be a long-lasting consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic,7 but access for
some already disenfranchised groups may be further reduced unless we are particularly
conscious of this risk.38

Interruption of medical care, exercise, and social activities were also associated with
exacerbation of PD symptoms. The effect was even greater among those asked to
socially isolate or quarantine. In the elderly, social isolation has been associated with
more rapid cognitive decline,39 and quarantine in particular can lead to lasting
psychological effects.40 Individuals with PD are at high risk for anxiety,41 and may be
particularly vulnerable to external stressors. Developing ways to minimize these
adverse consequences while maintaining safety precautions are needed.

Several limitations of this study must be acknowledged. We relied on self-report of
COVID-19 infection and outcomes. In sensitivity analyses, applying more stringent
criteria for COVID-19 classification of cases did not change our findings. Survey
completion was naturally limited to people who were healthy enough to log-in online and
fill out a survey, and we likely did not capture those with very advanced PD nor those
with severe COVID-19 illness. People with PD and COVID-19 may have been less likely

to fill out a survey, preventing our study from identifying true differences in infection risk
or outcome severity. Additionally, certain populations were underrepresented, and the
fact that we did see significantly greater disruption from the pandemic in some of these
groups (e.g. non-White race, lower income) indicates that the true differences may be
much larger. Finally while PD-diagnosis is self-reported in FI, available data indicate
high accuracy of self-reported PD in research settings; in one study that verified selfreported diagnosis of PD through use of a Webcam, a neurologist agreed with the
diagnosis in 97% of cases.42 An effort to validate diagnoses in FI is currently underway.

Our study raises important questions for future analyses. Anosmia in COVID-19, though
usually transient,43 may represent true viral invasion of the olfactory bulbs.44 Hyposmia
predicts PD-associated clinical and pathological changes.45, 46 This association, among
other neurologic manifestations in people with COVID-19,47, 48 has prompted worries
about the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection triggering long-term neurodegeneration,49
as was observed following the 1917-1918 pandemic.50 Follow-up of people with and
without PD who had new or worsened hyposmia may provide important insights into this
question. Our survey population also provides the opportunity to investigate the longterm effects of COVID-19 on PD progression and of the social and public health aspects
of the pandemic on PwPD. PwPD rely heavily on a network of outpatient healthcare,
ancillary services, and social support, and interruptions of those services may have
lasting implications that should be characterized longitudinally. FI has the capability to
reach a broader and more diverse group than traditional, center-based research, and
targeted recruitment will allow future studies to clarify the extent of and solutions for
disparities in healthcare access during and after the pandemic.

In conclusion, the disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic in PD is substantial, both
due to direct effects of the infection and the broader shelter-in-place guidelines.
Disruptions in PD-related medical care, essential daily activities, exercise, and social
activity were frequent, and contributed to worsening of motor and non-motor symptoms
especially in specific at-risk groups. Compensatory activities such as telemedicine and
online exercise and social programs are important, though these are not available to
everyone. As the pandemic and social distancing guidelines will likely last for some
time, targeted strategies should be developed to provide support to patients with all
levels of resources. The COVID-19 pandemic will likely have long-term repercussions;
intervention to mitigate those effects in our patients should begin as soon as possible.
