Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 infection induces severe disease in a subpopulation of patients, but the underlying
mechanisms remain unclear. We demonstrate robust IgM autoantibodies that recognize
angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) in 18/66 (27%) patients with severe COVID-19, which
are rare (2/52; 3.8%) in hospitalized patients who are not ventilated. The antibodies do not
undergo class-switching to IgG, suggesting a T-independent antibody response. Purified IgM
from anti-ACE2 patients activates complement. Pathological analysis of lung obtained at
autopsy shows endothelial cell staining for IgM in blood vessels in some patients. We propose
that vascular endothelial ACE2 expression focuses the pathogenic effects of these
autoantibodies on blood vessels, and contributes to the angiocentric pathology observed in
some severe COVID-19 patients. These findings may have predictive and therapeutic
implications.

COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2(1). It is a highly
infectious pathogen, and continues to have a massive global impact since its recognition in
Wuhan in late 2019, with more than 37 million confirmed infections, >1 million confirmed
deaths and massive economic disruption across the world. While most infections appear to be
self-limited, 15-20% of symptomatic individuals become hospitalized, and 5-10% require
admission to ICUs(2),(3). Mortality rates of hospitalized patients in the US range between 13
and 28%. Growing evidence suggests that some of the severe COVID-19 clinical features
represent damage induced by activation of the immune and inflammatory responses initiated
by the virus(4),(5),(6). In addition to frequent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), there
is also evidence of vasculopathy(7),(8), clotting(9),(10), and cardiovascular complications(11)
whose mechanisms are presently unclear, but in which complement activation has been
implicated(12),(9). The recent finding that low-dose dexamethasone has a beneficial effect on
mortality in a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 requiring ventilation has suggested
that uncontrolled inflammatory mechanisms might play an apical role in mediating disease
severity in a subset of patients with this disease(13). Understanding these mechanisms is
therefore a high priority, particularly if they might be rapidly addressed therapeutically with
additional off-the-shelf approaches.

IgM autoantibodies recognizing ACE2 are associated with severe disease in COVID-19
We were immediately drawn to ACE2, the host receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry (1), as a
potential autoantigen in COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein binds with higher affinity (5-20
fold higher) to ACE2 than the other coronaviruses which also bind to this host receptor (14).

Furthermore, ACE2 expression is enhanced in lung (epithelial and endothelial cells) and heart
(endothelial cells) (15), and hypomorphic ACE2 function has been implicated in adverse
outcomes in models of ARDS (16). We therefore established assays to screen for IgM and IgG
autoantibodies to ACE2, and applied these to a cohort of 66 hospitalized patients with COVID19 that reached the 6 most severe WHO ordinal categories as their maximal severity (28 severe,
38 moderate). 8 patients were positive for ACE2 IgM autoantibodies. 7 of these were in the
mechanically ventilated (WHO 6/7) or dead groups (WHO 8) (7/28; 25%), while only a single
patient was positive among the 38 patients who were not ventilated (1/38; 2.6%; OR 12.3, 95%
CI 1,875-141.9; p=0.0084; Fisher’s exact test; Supp.Fig. 1A). In order to increase sample size
and define the stability and kinetics of these antibodies, we assembled additional patients in
whom serum was available from multiple laboratory blood draws taken across their
hospitalization. This added 52 COVID-19 patients for analysis (38 in WHO ordinal groups 6-8 [31
ventilated and 7 dead], and 14 patients in ordinal category 4). The frequencies of anti-ACE2 IgM
in these patients were very similar to the initial group: 11/38 (28.9%) of the patients with
severe COVID-19 were positive for anti-ACE2 IgM antibodies compared to 1/14 (7.1%) in the
milder COVID-19 group (Supp. Fig. 1B). The combined frequency of anti-ACE2 IgM in severe
COVID-19 was 18 of 66 patients (27.2%) compared to 2 of 52 patients with moderate COVID-19
(3.8%; p= 0.0009; OR 9.38, 95% CI 2.38-42.0; Fisher’s exact test; Fig. 1A). IgM levels were robust
(Fig. 1A, center panel); all positives were confirmed and quantified by serial dilution
(representative examples in Supp. Fig. 1B). Anti-ACE2 IgG were found in 12/66 (18%) patients
with severe COVID-19 (WHO 6-8), and 6/52 (11.5%) patients with moderate disease (WHO 3-5;
p=0.44, Fisher’s exact test). Only 4/18 (22%) severe patients with anti-ACE2 IgM antibodies

were also IgG positive (Fig. 1A, right panel). ACE2 is therefore a prominent autoantibody target
in patients with COVID-19, with IgM autoantibodies quite strikingly associated with severe
disease.
Clinical features of the anti-ACE2 IgM-positive group are summarized in Fig 2 and Supp.

anti-ACE2 was higher in females (13/38, 34%) than males (5/28, 17.8%) with severe COVID-19,
this difference did not reach statistical significance in this sample (p=0.17; Fisher’s exact test).

Interestingly, the anti-ACE2-positive group had statistically significantly higher average

from linear mixed-effects model Wald test with 4 degrees of freedom (see statistical methods),
Fig. 2E). Various infectious and autoimmune disease controls were also tested for anti-ACE2
IgM (Fig. 2F). Anti-ACE2 IgM autoantibodies were not observed in 30 patients with acute
influenza infection (including 11 patients evaluated in the ED and discharged to outpatient care,
and 19 hospitalized patients requiring oxygen therapy or assisted ventilation (5)), 25 patients
with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 13 with scleroderma, and 15 with autoimmune
necrotizing myopathy. Interestingly, we did find ACE2 autoantibodies in an index patient with a
rare acute dermatopulmonary syndrome associated with autoantibodies to MDA5 (17) from
who we had collected serum previously, and which appears to phenocopy several of the
features of severe COVID-19 (see case report in Methods; additional studies on similar patients
are underway). This specificity of anti-ACE2 IgM for severe COVID-19 or a close phenocopy is
striking.

Longitudinal analysis of anti-ACE2 IgM and IgG suggests a T-independent autoantibody
response.
Since IgM is the earliest isotype elaborated in immune responses, we pursued a
longitudinal analysis of anti-ACE2 IgM on all positive patients for whom serum was available.
This demonstrated several patterns (Fig 1B, and Supp. Fig 3): (i) In 3 patients (CV-117, CV-123,

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.13.20211664; this version posted October 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

CV-128), sampling spanned the development of anti-ACE2 IgM (Fig.1B and Suppl Fig 3). In these
cases, autoantibodies appeared at ~10 days after admission, and around the time of clinical
worsening and intubation. We have not captured sufficient numbers of events around this time
to make a definitive statement about onset of antibodies, but they do not appear to
significantly precede clinical worsening; (ii) Anti-ACE2 IgM were already elevated at the first
time point assayed in most patients, where patients were already intubated; in 4 patients (CV1, CV-58, CV-65, CV-126), levels remained stable over time (one example shown in Fig. 1B;
additional examples in Supp Fig. 3); (iii) In a third group, anti-ACE2 IgM levels decreased over
time (CV-113, CV-124 and CV-134 (Fig 1B); CV-3, CV-57, CV-64, CV-129, CV-140, CV-143 (Suppl
Fig 3)).
Overall, our studies captured multiple individuals where IgM levels decreased over time
(Fig. 1B, Supp. Fig. 3). In T cell-dependent immune responses, this generally occurs at the time
of class switching to IgG. We therefore examined whether decreasing IgM levels over time
were associated with increasing anti-ACE2 IgG levels at later time points. In one patient (CV-1),
both IgG and IgM were present at the earliest point and remained constant over time (Fig. 1B).
In 8 anti-ACE2 IgM-positive patients, we observed a decrease of anti-ACE2 IgM to ~50% over
time; all these patients were IgG-negative and remained so.
Multiple groups have noted that high levels of anti- SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein IgG
occurring at the time of hospital admission are associated with more severe disease in COVID19 (e.g. ref (18)). We assayed antibodies to S-protein by ELISA, and anti-S and -RBD antibodies
by the CoronaChek assay (Supp. Fig. 4). The mean ODs of anti-S antibodies were significantly
higher in patients with severe compared to mild COVID-19 (0.68 +/- 0.48 vs 0.23 +/- 0.33; mean

+/- SD, P<0.0001; Supp. Fig. 4A). Anti-S IgG levels were also significantly increased in anti-ACE2
IgM-positive COVID-19 patients compared to anti-ACE2 IgM-negatives (median 0.55 vs 0.14;
p=0.028; Mann-Whitney test; Supp. Fig 4B). Using the CoronaChek assay, 8/8 (100%) of antiACE2 IgM-positive patients had a positive anti-ACE2 IgG result, compared to only 31/58 (53.4%)
of anti-ACE2 IgM-negative patients (p=0.017, Fisher’s exact test; Supp. Fig 4C). Since anti-ACE2
IgM-positive patients have evidence of a robust anti-viral IgG response, failure of the anti-ACE2
IgM to isotype switch to IgG is not a general feature of anti-ACE2 patients. Instead, these data
strongly suggest that the anti-ACE2 IgM immune response is not predominantly driven by T
cells (either anti-viral or autoreactive), but rather represents a T-independent antibody
response induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such T-independent responses generally arise from
B1 or marginal zone B cells(19),(20), and we suggest that such cells are the likely origin of this
response. The finding of strikingly expanded circulating plasmablasts in severe COVID19(21),(4),(22), a response which is oligoclonal with some clones that have not undergone
somatic mutation, is consistent with this mechanism. An intriguing possibility is that a robust
neutralizing anti-S IgG response induces an anti-idiotype IgM response, which also cross-reacts
with ACE2, the spike protein receptor. The finding that anti-ACE2 IgM only appear after about
8-10 days after admission, where anti-S responses are well-established, is consistent with this
possibility. The enhanced clinical inflammatory features (increased body temperature and CRP
levels) that occur in anti-ACE2 IgM patients early after admission provides additional support
for this hypothesis (Fig. 2D & E), as it suggests that the amplification to severe disease may
begin significantly before decompensation(2).

The clinical efficacy of steroids in patients with severe COVID-19(13),(23) prompted us
to examine whether any of the anti-ACE2 IgM-positive patients had been treated with steroids,
and whether there was any relationship to subsequent IgM levels. None of the 5 anti-ACE2 IgMpositive individuals who died were treated with steroids for more than 2 days. Of the 13
patients that were ventilated but survived, 6 were treated with steroids for more than 2 days,
and there was a temporal association of decreased anti-ACE2 IgM levels with steroid treatment
in 3 patients where appropriate samples were available (Fig. 1B and Supp Fig. 3). The data
suggest that anti-ACE2 IgM might be a dynamic biomarker, and worthy of study in a prospective
cohort where the effects of steroids and other immune therapies can be rigorously addressed.

Properties of IgM autoantibodies recognizing ACE2
We next pursued additional analysis of the anti-ACE2 IgM binding properties using a
different source of ACE2 antigen, and a different assay format. IgM purified from 2 patients
with high titer ACE2 antibodies and 2 healthy controls were analyzed via biolayer
interferometry. Patient IgM binding to immobilized ACE2 was saturable, with apparent K D
R

R

values (Fig 3C) of 0.11µM (CV-1) and 3.6 µM (CV-64), whereas IgM from healthy controls did
not exhibit measurable binding to ACE2 (Fig. 3A-C and Supp. Fig.5, panels A-C). The reported K D
R

values provide a ceiling for these measurements; since the purified IgM is a mixture of
antibodies against various targets, the actual ACE2 affinities for individual IgM clones are
presumably higher. These data are consistent with antibodies that have not undergone affinity
maturation, which are known to have low affinity (high nanomolar to micromolar range) but
benefit from avidity effects (24).

Since hypomorphic ACE2 function has been associated with severity in ARDS, we
investigated whether purified IgM from COVID-19 patients affected the catalytic function of
ACE2 against a fluorogenic substrate. The purified IgM used above in binding assays had no
effect on ACE2 activity (Fig. 3D and Supp. Fig5C).
IgM antibodies are mainly found in the circulation, where they are the most effective
isotype at activating the classical complement cascade at surfaces expressing their cognate
antigens(25). We found that IgM antibodies with high affinity binding to ACE2 (i.e. CV-1)
consistently activated complement upon antigen binding (Fig. 3E). In some experiments, IgM
purified from CV-64 and CV-164 behaved similarly to CV-1, although the magnitude of the
effect was decreased (Supp. Fig 5D). These data suggest that IgM antibodies recognizing ACE2
play a role in the widespread complement pathway activation observed in COVID-19 patients
(7)(26).
Recent autopsy studies in COVID-19 have demonstrated a striking series of findings in
the lung of COVID-19 patients(9),(27). In addition to diffuse alveolar damage and perivascular
infiltrating lymphocytes, there were striking angiocentric features in COVID-19 lungs, including
severe endothelial injury associated with membrane disruption and ACE2 expression,
widespread microangiopathy with occlusion of capillaries, and new vessel growth.
In order to define whether there was any in vivo evidence of IgM deposition in the lungs of
patients with COVID-19, specimens from 23 autopsies were stained with anti-human IgM.
Serum from the biorepository was only available in 7 of these patients; they were all negative
for serum anti-ACE2 IgM, and had no IgM staining in the lung. Among the remaining patients, 4
(25%) had evidence of staining with anti-IgM, with staining observed in blood vessels and

capillaries in 2 patients (Fig. 4). Another patient had staining of a lymphatic channel, and the
final patient had staining that was alveolar in pattern. Vascular endothelium appeared reactive,
mostly without accompanying inflammatory infiltrates. The finding of examples of endothelial
IgM deposition in COVID-19 lung demonstrates that an endothelial cell target with similar
distribution to ACE2 (9),(27) is recognized by IgM in a subgroup of COVID-19 patients with fatal
disease. Defining whether these IgM molecules recognize ACE2 or another endothelial antigen
is a high priority.

These studies demonstrate that anti-ACE2 IgM arise in the context of severe COVID-19,
likely predominantly as a T-independent antibody response. This immune response is of
potential pathogenic significance through binding to the surface of endothelial cells, activating
the classical complement cascade, and initiating an inflammatory response. These mechanisms
are potentially amenable to several readily available treatments, particularly short duration
anti-inflammatory therapy (e.g. steroids and IVIG therapy (28),(29),(30) and potentially
inhibitors of complement or therapies targeting T-independent antibody generation). It is
noteworthy that mortality of the dermatopulmonary phenocopy associated with MDA5
autoantibodies appeared to be substantially decreased by steroids, IVIG and calcineurin
inhibitor treatment (31)(32), although controlled trials have not been possible in this rare
phenotype. Since ACE2 autoantibodies have features of T-independent responses, this may
provide an important opportunity to use focused, short-term immune-focused therapies in
severe COVID-19 (consistent with the dexamethasone results(13)) rather than the deeper
immunosuppression needed for T cell-driven processes.

In contrast to the recently described genetic and preexisting autoimmune factors that
predispose to severe COVID-19 (i.e., inborn errors of type I IFN immunity and anti-IFN
autoantibodies (33)), this study adds a unique biomarker that results from SARS-CoV-2
infection and is strongly associated with severe clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19.
The 27% of those with critical disease who develop IgM to ACE2 (more women, antibodies
follow infection) are almost certainly non-overlapping with the 10% of severe COVID-19
patients who have prexisiting IgG to Type I IFNs (autoantibodies are IgG, almost exclusively in
males, and precede infection) (33). Together with an additional 2-3% have inborn errors of type
I IFNs (33), these constitute about 40% of severe COVID-19 patients. Another major
endophenotype in severe COVID-19 appears to encompass patients with immunosenescence,
with blunted CD8 responses, which is enriched in the elderly (34)(35). These endophenotypes,
driven by distinct mechanisms, having actionable markers and accounting for a substantial
fraction of severe COVID-19, will likely benefit from both shared and distinct therapeutic
approaches. Rapidly defining additional mechanistically-anchored groups in severe COVID is a
high priority.

FIGURE LEGENDS
Figure 1: Anti-ACE2 IgM antibodies are found in patients with COVID-19. A: Antibodies were
assayed by ELISA in the combined COVID cohort (N=118 patients). Left panel: the number of
patients with and without anti-ACE2 IgM antibodies is shown grouped by disease severity.
27.2% of severe patients were anti-ACE2 positive compared to 3.8% with moderate COVID (p=
0.0009; Fisher’s exact test). In the center and right panels, data from anti-ACE2 IgM and IgG
ELISA assays, respectively, is presented as corrected OD 450 absorbance units. This data was
obtained on all the COVID patients presented in the left panel, as well as from 30 healthy
controls. Red dots in the IgG panel denote IgG-positive samples that also have anti-ACE2 IgM
antibodies. The horizontal line on each plot represents the cutoff for assigning a positive
antibody status. B: Longitudinal analysis of anti-ACE2 IgM antibodies. For all those anti-ACE2
IgM-positive patients with multiple banked sera available (16/18), anti-ACE2 IgM and IgG
antibodies were quantitated over time. Red and blue lines on each plot denote anti-ACE2 IgM
and IgG antibodies, respectively. Solid black bars represent steroid treatment periods.
Additional examples are shown in Suppl Fig 3.

Figure 2: Clinical features of anti-ACE2 IgM-positive COVID-19 patients compared to those
that do not have these antibodies. A-E: Age, BMI, sex, temperature and CRP levels were
compared between the anti-ACE2 IgM-positive and negative COVID patient groups. Red and
blue colors denote anti-ACE2 IgM-antibody positive and negative status, respectively. Box plots
show median, 25th and 75th percentiles, and whiskers min to max. Fig. 2D, E. IgM anti-ACE2
patients have higher average body temperature and CRP measurements beginning early after

hospital admission. The IgM anti-ACE2-positive group had statistically significantly higher
average temperatures and CRP levels over the first 10 days of hospitalization than the IgMnegative group (p = 0.0001 and 0.02, respectively). Analyses in both 2D and 2E use linear mixedeffects model Wald test with 4 degrees of freedom (see statistical methods. 2F: Anti-ACE2 IgM
antibodies are detected in COVID-19 patients but not in other infectious and autoimmune
disease controls.

Figure 3: Properties of anti-ACE2 IgM antibodies. (A-C): Kinetic analysis. A: Kinetic traces of
the binding interactions between immobilized human ACE2 and purified IgM, as determined by
biolayer interferometry. Percentages represent twofold dilutions of IgM from patient CV-1 and
Control B. B: Equilibrium binding titrations. Normalized responses at the indicated
concentrations of purified IgM from the donors shown in (A) are plotted. C: Quantitation of the
data obtained in A&B, and a separate patient and control shown in Supp. Fig 5A&B. D: AntiACE2 IgM antibodies do not inhibit ACE2 activity. ACE2 activity, in the presence or absence of
IgM from patient CV-1 or Control B, was measured using a fluorescent substrate in a time
course assay. The positive control was ACE2 alone, and the negative control was ACE2 plus
ACE2 inhibitor (see Suppl Fig.5D for data obtained from another patient and control). E:
Complement activation induced by IgM antibodies to ACE2. Dynabeads containing immune
complexes of ACE2 and purified IgM from controls or anti-ACE2-positive COVID-19 (CV) patients
were incubated with human complement. Deposition of C1q and C3 was visualized by
immunoblotting. ACE2 is shown as a loading control. Markedly enhanced C1q binding in CV-1
observed in 3 separate experiments.

Materials and Methods
Patient data and serum samples.
The study cohort was defined as inpatients who had: 1) a confirmed diagnosis of COVID19; 2) survival to death or discharge; and 3) remnant specimens in the Johns Hopkins COVID-19
Remnant Specimen Biorepository, an opportunity sample that includes 59% of Johns Hopkins
Hospital COVID-19 patients and 66% of patients with length of stay >=3 days. Diagnosis of COVID19 was defined as detection of SARS-CoV-2 using any PCR test with an Emergency Use
Authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration. Selection and frequency of other
laboratory testing were determined by treating physicians. The primary clinical data source was
JH-CROWN, a Johns Hopkins Medicine COVID-19 registry that integrates all clinical data for
COVID-19 patients, including demographics, medical history, comorbid conditions, symptoms,
medications, laboratory results, medical images, and comprehensive bedside flowsheet data,
including vital signs, respiratory events, and intravenous medication titration (2).
Patient outcomes were defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19
disease severity scale. The WHO scale is an 8-point ordinal scale ranging from ambulatory
(1=asymptomatic, 2=mild limitation in activity), to hospitalized with mild-moderate disease
(3=room air, 4=nasal cannula or facemask oxygen), hospitalized with severe disease (5=high flow
nasal canula (HFNC) or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), 6=intubation and
mechanical ventilation, 7=intubation and mechanical ventilation and other signs of organ failure
(hemodialysis, vasopressors, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)), and 8=death. For
this study we combined adjacent WHO classes, dividing the inpatient population into two groups
according to maximum WHO severity: patients who did not require mechanical ventilation (WHO

class 3-5); those who required mechanical ventilation with or without additional support, such as
intravenous pressors, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and/or extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) who survived (WHO classes 6-7) or died (WHO class 8). Serum
samples were selected for timing within 24 hours of onset of the maximum WHO class; when
multiple samples were available, the specimen closest to the WHO class onset was used. The
initial analysis used a random sample of 12-20 unique patient specimens from each of the 4
classes meeting the criteria above (depending upon specimen availability for the clinical class).
To determine biomarker trajectory, we analyzed an expanded cohort of patients who had 3-4
consecutive sera per patient across the course of their hospitalization. Patient selection was
determined solely by specimen availability. Where available, additional serum for anti-ACE2 IgMpositive individuals was requested from the remnant biorepository. These studies were approved
by the JHU Institutional Review Board (IRB 00251725, IRB 00256018, 00256547), with a waiver
of consent because all specimens and clinical data were de-identified by the Core for Clinical
Research Data Acquisition of the Johns Hopkins Institute for Clinical and Translational Research;
the study team had no access to identifiable patient data. Patient numbers per analysis are
denoted in the figure legends.
Disease and healthy control sera – Three autoimmune disease control cohorts consisted of the
following. (i) Sera from N=25 patients with SLE from the Johns Hopkins Lupus Cohort. (ii) Sera
from N=13 patients diagnosed with systemic sclerosis after evaluation at the Johns Hopkins
Scleroderma Center. (iii) N=15 patients with necrotizing myopathy defined by a positive antiHMGCR antibody status evaluated at the Johns Hopkins Myositis Center. Serum from N=30
patients with influenza diagnosed using the Cepheid Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV assay in the Johns

Hopkins Emergency departments or in-patient units, were studied. 11 were evaluated in the ED
and discharged to outpatient care; an additional 19 patients were hospitalized, and required
oxygen therapy or assisted ventilation (5). Sera from N=30 adult healthy control individuals
were also studied. Informed consent for these samples was obtained following protocols
approved by the JHU Institutional Review Board (NA_00039294, NA_00039566, #NA00007454,
IRB00066509, IRB00091667).
At the initiation of this study, we were struck by the similar clinical presentation of severe
COVID-19 to a dermatopulmonary syndrome, characterized by skin rash, rapidly progressive
interstitial lung process with frequent progression to a need for ventilatory support, and a unique
vasculopathic phenotype including cutaneous ulcers and digital ischemia (17)(36)(37). This
syndrome has been associated with IgG autoantibodies to melanoma differentiation-associated
5 (MDA5)(38). In its fulminant form, this can be viewed as a phenocopy of severe COVID-19, with
a high mortality in the absence of treatment with steroids, IVIG, or calcineurin inhibition (31)(32).
Serum was available to us from a 42 year-old patient with this MDA5-associated syndrome, who
developed symptoms of weakness, rash, fevers, and dyspnea in October of 2011. Her clinical
course stabilized with immunosuppression consisting of corticosteroids, tacrolimus, and
rituximab over the ensuing 8 years. Informed consent was obtained at presentation following
protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins Institutional Review Board #NA00007454. Strikingly,
this index patient had IgM and IgG autoantibodies against ACE2; her serum served as the
reference calibrator on all ELISA plates. A study to understand the prevalence and relevance of
these ACE2 autoantibodies in anti-MDA5-positive dermatomyositis-like disease and other
rheumatic syndromes characterized by severe lung disease is currently ongoing.

Anti-ACE2 and -SARSCoV2 spike ELISA assays – ELISA plate wells were coated overnight with
50 ng of purified protein (recombinant human ACE2 from Abcam, cat # ab151852; SARSCoV2
spike protein S1 subunit from Sino Bio cat # 40591-V08B1) diluted in PBS. For each serum
assayed, 2 wells were coated with protein (duplicate readout), and an adjacent well was
incubated overnight with PBS only (to determine background specific to each sample tested).
Anti-ACE2 IgM ELISA: Wells were washed with PBS plus 0.1% Tween (PBST), and subsequently
blocked with 3% milk/PBST. Primary antibody incubations were routinely performed by diluting
sera 1:200 in 1% milk/PBST overnight at 4oC. For the area under the curve plots (shown in Suppl.
Fig 1B), serial serum dilutions ranging from 1:100 to 1:3,200 were used for the ELISA assays. Wells
were then washed with PBST, followed by incubation with HRP-labeled anti-human IgM (Heavy
chain-specific; Jackson ImmunoResearch cat # 109-035-043) diluted 1:5000 in 1% milk/PBST (1
hour, room temperature). Color was developed with SureBlue peroxidase reagent (KPL).
Reactions were terminated by adding HCl, and absorbances were read at 450 nM. The same antiACE2 IgM-positive reference serum was included on each plate assayed and all absorbances were
calibrated relative to this reference serum. Anti-ACE2 IgG ELISA: was performed as described for
anti-ACE2 IgM antibodies, with the following modifications. The concentration of Tween in PBST
was 0.5%. Blocking was performed with 5%BSA/PBST, and sera and secondary antibodies were
diluted with 1% BSA/PBST. The secondary antibody was HRP-labeled anti-human IgG (Jackson
ImmunoResearch cat # 109-036-088 ), diluted 1:10,000. The cutoff for assigning anti-ACE2 IgM
and IgG antibody positivity was determined by assaying sera from 30 healthy controls. The mean
+3 SD of these values (0.340 and 0.187 calibrated OD units for anti-ACE2 IgM and IgG antibodies,
respectively) was taken as the cutoff for each. The anti-ACE2 ELISA was validated by (i) blotting

purified recombinant human ACE2 and (ii) using a second source of recombinant human ACE2
purchased from another vendor (Sino Biological, cat # 10108-H08H). Anti-SARSCoV2 spike IgG
ELISA – These assays were performed as described for anti-ACE2 IgG ELISAs, with the following
modifications. Sera were assayed at a 1:1,200 dilution, and the primary antibody incubation was
performed for 1 hr at room temperature.

CoronaChek assay - The CoronaChek serologic lateral flow assay (Hangzhou Biotest Biotech Co,
Ltd., Hangzhou China) detects M (IgM) and G (IgG) antibodies to the spike protein and receptor
binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. Studies on positive and negative control specimens from
Maryland demonstrated: sensitivity of 95%, (95%CI 83%, 99%) in convalescent plasma donors an
average of 50 days post symptom onset; sensitivity of 100% (95%CI 89%, 100%) in PCR confirmed
hospitalized individuals 15 days after symptom onset; specificity of 100% 95% CI 94%, 100%) in
pre-pandemic patients infected with rhinoviruses and other coronaviruses.

Purification of IgM from patient serum - Following the manufacturer’s instruction, 0.5 mL of
POROS CaptureSelect™ IgM Affinity Matrix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was equilibrated with 10
column volumes (CV) of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH7.2 in a Poly-Prep® chromatography
column (Bio-Rad). Patient serum samples (400 µL) were diluted 1:10 in PBS pH 7.2, filtered via
centrifugation at 12,000´g using 0.45 µm spin filters (EMD Millipore), and loaded onto the
column. The column was washed twice with 5 CV of PBS pH 7.2. Bound IgM protein was eluted
with 5 CV of 0.1 M glycine, pH 3. The eluted IgM was immediately neutralized with 0.1 CV of 1 M
Tris-HCl (pH 8).

The eluted IgM was exchanged into PBS and concentrated to match the original serum
volume using Amicon 30 kDa molecular weight centrifugal filters (EMD Millipore). The 280 nm
absorbance of the purified IgM was measured to calculate the IgM concentration, using the
extinction coefficient for pentameric human IgM.

Biolayer interferometry analysis of ACE2/IgM interaction - Biolayer interferometry was
performed using an Octet RED96 instrument (Molecular Devices) to measure the interaction of
purified IgM from patient serum to ACE2. Wells of a black flat-bottom polypropylene plate
(Corning) were loaded with the following samples: 50 nM biotinylated human ACE2 (Sino
Biological, 10108-H08H-B); twofold dilutions of purified patient IgM; PBSA (PBS pH 7.2 containing
0.1% bovine serum albumin [BSA]); and regeneration buffer (0.1 M glycine, pH 3). All samples
were centrifuged at 12,000´g through a 0.45 µm filter device (EMD Millipore), and buffers were
vacuum filtered using a 0.22 µm membrane (EMD Millipore). ACE2 and the IgM samples were
diluted in PBSA. ACE2 was loaded onto hydrated streptavidin (SA) biosensor tips (Molecular
Devices), and baseline measurements were collected in PBSA. Binding kinetics were then
measured by submerging the ACE2-coated biosensors in wells containing twofold serial dilutions
of each patient IgM sample for 300 s (association) followed by submerging the biosensor in wells
containing only PBSA for 450 s (dissociation).

Tips were regenerated via exposure to

regeneration buffer. Analysis and kinetic curve fitting (assuming a 1:1 binding model) was
conducted using Octet Data Analysis HT software version 7.1 (Molecular Devices). Normalized
equilibrium binding curves were obtained by plotting the response value after the 300 s
association phase for each sample dilution and normalizing to the maximum value. Equilibrium

curves were fitted to a single logistic model using a non-linear regression algorithm in GraphPad
Prism software.

ACE2 activity assay - ACE2 activity was measured using a kit from BioVIsion (K897). Purified IgM
(5 µg) or ACE2 inhibitor was preincubated with ACE2 in white Costar 96-well plates for 20 min at
RT, followed by addition of fluorogenic ACE2 substrate as per the manufacturer’s protocol. PBS
made up 20% of the assay volume for CV-1 IgM and 10% for CV-64 IgM (due to lower protein
concentration of the CV-1 IgM). Thus, a PBS control was included for each assay. The positive
control contained only ACE2 and substrate, and the negative control was ACE2 plus ACE inhibitor
and substrate. Fluorescence was measured every 5 min after substrate addition in a BMG Labtech
FLUOstar Omega plate reader, with excitation at 355 nm and emission at 460 nm. Fluorescence
values for wells containing no ACE2 (blank) were subtracted from the values shown.

Complement activation assay: 20 µl Dynabeads M-270 streptavidin (Thermo) were coated with
250 ng of biotinylated ACE2 purchased from either ACROBiosystems (Cat# AC2-H82E6) and
SinoBiological (Cat: #10108-H08H-B). These were then incubated with 0.5µg purified IgM (see
above) diluted in 200 µl NP40 Buffer A (20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) containing
1% BSA. After 2 hrs at RT, the beads were washed twice in Buffer A and once in gelatin veronal
buffer (GVB, Comptech). Human serum was added as the source of complement (1:50 dilution)
to reach a final volume of 100 µl in GVB. After 1 hr at 37oC, the beads were washed in Buffer A,
and boiled in gel application buffer. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on 12% SDSpolyacrylamide gels. ACE2, C3 and C1q were detected by immunoblotting (anti-ACE2, R&D

were detected using horseradish peroxidase–labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson
ImmunoResearch) and chemiluminescence. Images were acquired using a Protein Simple
Fluorochem-M digital imager.

Immunohistochemistry - Autopsies of 23 patients infected with Sars-CoV-2, documented by PCR
on a pre or postmortem nasopharyngeal swab, were examined. Autopsies were consented for
and performed on the clinical service with complete examination of chest organs and in-situ
sampling of remaining organs and tissues, with histology performed on all sites. Lung paraffin
sections from COVID-19 autopsy patients were either stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin, or
processed as follows. After deparaffinization and rehydration, the sections were immersed in
antigen retrieval solution (DAKO) for 30 min at 98oC. For IgM staining, the sections were blocked
with goat serum (30 minutes at room temperature), followed by incubation with horseradish
peroxidase labeled goat anti-human IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat # 109-035-043) diluted
1:500. Visualization was performed with a liquid DAB substrate-chromagen system (DAKO) and
the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin before mounting.

Statistical Methods - The clinical measures used in this analysis are from the JHM COVID-19
Crown Registry that is actively curated by a team of clinicians, informaticists, and statisticians to
assure data quality. For repeated measures outcomes (e.g. temperature, CRP, BMI) data was
checked by making spaghetti plots (39) and visually checking the consistency of observations over
time within an individual. The other main source are laboratory measurements of immune status

(e.g. IgM or IgG antibodies) that are either binary indicators of presence/absence or absorbance
levels as described in the immunoassay section.
To compare the rates of IgM antibody positivity between two subgroups, we estimated
the ratio of the odds of positivity for one subgroup versus the other (odds ratio) and 95%
confidence interval. Given the small numbers of patients in some comparator groups, we used a
Fisher's exact test of the null hypothesis that the rates were equal (odds ratio = 1). To compare
means of continuous variables with roughly Gaussian distributions (determined using a quantilequantile plot), we estimated the mean difference and its standard error and used an unpaired ttest of the null hypothesis that the two population means are equal. When we detected a large
deviation from Gaussianity (for S protein IgG), a non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney) was used
instead.
To compare the trajectory of clinical outcomes over time between IgM positive and IgM
negative groups, we used a linear mixed effects model (40). Variables were transformed to the
log-scale if their marginal distribution was more nearly symmetric after transformation. The fixed
effects included an indicator variable for IgM-positive status a smooth function of time (natural
cubic spline with 3 degrees of freedom) and their interaction. We assumed each person had a
random intercept and random linear trend to account for the likely correlation among repeated
observations on individuals. Given this specification, we estimated the smooth curve for the IgM
positive and negative groups as well as their difference with 95% confidence intervals. We tested
the null hypothesis that the two population time curves are the same (coefficients for main effect
of IgM and interaction of IgM with time all equal 0) using a Wald test statistic that was compared
to a Chi-square distribution with 4 degrees of freedom. The analysis was repeated using natural

ELISAs were performed as described in the Methods section. In the Discovery cohort (left
panel), 8/66 patients with COVID-19 were positive for anti-ACE2 IgM antibodies. Of these, 25%
of the WHO 6-8 group were positive compared to 2.6% of the WHO 3-5 group (p=0.0084,
Fisher’s exact test). An additional 52 COVID-19 patients were assayed (“Expanded discovery”,
right panel); the frequency of anti-ACE2 IgM in these patients was similar to the initial group.
Data from the combined cohorts (N = 118) is shown in Fig 1A. B. Anti-ACE2 IgM ELISAs were
performed using serial serum dilutions (1:100 to 1:3,200 range). Data obtained from four
different patients is shown in the left panel, each assayed using serum from a single bleed.
Data from a fifth patient is shown in the right panel, using serum made from blood draws on 4
different days. Area under the curve (“AUC”) plots are shown in both panels.

Supplemental Fig. 2: The higher average body temperature measurements in IgM anti-ACE2
patients are not a function of disease severity. IgM anti-ACE2-positive group had statistically
significantly higher average temperatures over the first 10 days of hospitalization than the IgMnegative group (Fig. 2D). The analysis here is restricted to the severe IgM-positive patients
compared to all severe COVID-19 patients from the CROWN Registry for whom IgM status was
unknown. The results are unchanged, implicating the increased temperature as a function of
IgM status rather than disease severity (IgM-positive: mean = 37.53, S 2 = 0.64, N = 721 on M =

Supplemental Fig 3: Longitudinal analysis of anti-ACE2 IgM antibodies in patients
hospitalized with severe COVID-19. For all those anti-ACE2 IgM-positive patients with multiple
banked sera, anti-ACE2 IgM and IgG antibodies were quantitated over time. Red and blue lines
on each plot denote anti-ACE2 IgM and IgG antibodies, respectively. The following patients
were on steroid treatment: CV-58 (days 20-24 and 29-36); CV-65 (days 26-28) and CV-129 (day
20 to beyond day 60). Additional examples are shown in Fig. 1B.

Supplemental Fig. 4: Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S-protein in anti-ACE2-positive COVID-19
patients. A: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S-protein IgG antibodies were assayed by ELISA (N=66). Patients
are shown grouped by disease severity in (left panel), and by anti-ACE2 IgM antibody status in
(right panel). The mean ODs of anti-S antibodies were significantly higher in patients with
severe compared to mild COVID (P<0.0001, Chi-squared). The median anti-S-antibody level was
significantly higher in anti-ACE2 IgM-positive patients compared to anti-ACE2 IgM-negatives
(P=0.028, Mann-Whitney test). B: Anti-S and -RBP antibodies assayed by the CoronaChek point
of care assay. 8/8 (100%) of anti-ACE2 IgM-positive patients had a positive IgG result,
compared to only 31/58 (53.4%) of anti-ACE2 IgM-negative patients (p=0.017, Fisher’s exact
test). Red and blue denote anti-ACE2 IgM antibody-positive and -negative patients,
respectively.

Supplemental Fig 5: Properties of anti-ACE2 IgM antibodies. (A-B): Kinetics. A: Kinetic traces
of the binding interactions between immobilized human ACE2 and purified IgM, as determined
by biolayer interferometry. Percentages represent twofold dilutions of IgM from patient CV-64
and Control A. B: Equilibrium binding titrations. Normalized responses at the indicated
concentrations of purified IgM from the donors shown in (A) are plotted (see Fig.3A&B for data
obtained from CV-1 and control B). Kinetic parameters are provided in Fig. 3C. C: Anti-ACE2
IgM antibodies do not inhibit ACE2 activity. ACE2 activity, in the presence or absence of IgM
from patient CV-64 or Control A, was measured using a fluorescent substrate in a time course
assay. The positive control was ACE2 alone, and the negative control was ACE2 plus ACE2
inhibitor (see Fig 3C for data from CV-1 and control B). D: Complement activation induced by
IgM antibodies to ACE2. Dynabeads containing immune complexes of ACE2 and purified IgM
from controls (cont) or anti-ACE2 IgM from COVID-19 patients (CV) were incubated with human
complement. Deposition of C1q and C3 was visualized by immunoblotting. ACE2 is shown as a
loading control.
