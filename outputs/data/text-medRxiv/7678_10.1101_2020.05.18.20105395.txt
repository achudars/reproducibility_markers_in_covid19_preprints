Abstract (250 words)
Background
Reports from the UK and the USA suggest that COVID-19 predominantly affects poorer individuals
and neighbourhoods. This article paints a more complex picture by distinguishing between a first
and second phase of the pandemic. The initial spread of infections and its correlation with socioeconomic factors largely depends on how the virus first entered a country. The second phase of the
pandemic begins when individuals start taking precautionary measures and governments implement
lockdowns. In this phase the further spread of the virus depends on the ability of individuals to
socially distance themselves, which is to some extent socially stratified.
Methods
We analyze the geographical distribution of known cases per capita across 401 local districts in
Germany, once for infections in the initial phase and for new infections during the second phase.
Results
In Germany, the virus first entered via individuals returning from skiing in the Alps and other
international travel. In this first phase we find a positive association between the wealth of a district
and infection rates and a negative association with indicators of social deprivation. During the
second phase, richer districts and districts with a higher share of university-educated employees
record fewer new infections, whilst the initial safety advantage of more socially deprived districts
disappears.
Conclusion
The social stratification of Covid-19 changes substantively across the two phases of the pandemic in
Germany. Only in the second phase does socio-economic advantage turn into a safety advantage.
Thus, suggestions that the pandemic predominantly hits the poor needs to be qualified.

Introduction
It is a recurrent theme in the public health literature that during a pandemic, low-income
populations will be infected with a higher probability (Bouye et al. 2009; Bernardi 2020; van
Dorn et al. 2020). In line with this established argument, recent media reports from the
United Kingdom (Toynbee 2020), data from the US (Han et al. 2020) and an academic study
of Covid-19 mortality in New York City (Harris 2020) suggest that the poor are more likely to
get infected with Sars-CoV-2 and develop Covid-19 and that poor neighborhoods will bear
the brunt of the pandemic. In other countries, however, Covid-19 is perceived to be a ‘rich
man’s disease’. In many developing countries, the coronavirus was imported via business
travelers from China, students from Europe, or by tourists (Bengali et

al. 2020), and in

European countries, a good part of the spread can be traced back to ski tourism in the Alps
(Correa-Martínez et al. 2020).

The argument that Covid-19 affects and kills predominantly the poor and socially deprived
cannot be generalized to all countries and the link between socio-economic factors and who
bears

the

major

burden

of

the

pandemic

is

more

complex.

Our

argument

rests

on

a

distinction between two phases of the pandemic. In phase 1 the first importation of the
virus from abroad and its subsequent initial spread will depend to some extent on pure
chance and its correlation with socio-economic factors in a country is strongly influenced by
the channels through which the virus enters a country. This initial phase is characterized by
widespread ignorance first and neglect later on. The existence of the virus may be known –
European citizens had seen footage from China and Italy – but the ability to test for a SarsCoV-2

In Germany, the virus happened to be spread initially via individuals returning from ski holidays in the Alps and, to a much lesser extent, through business and other travelers from
China, Italy and other hotspots, which meant that the majority of infected people in the
beginning were relatively young and well-off (Correa-Martínez 2020; Steffens 2020). In Italy,
by contrast, the virus was initially spread mainly through hospitals, which made the average
infected Italian much older than the average infected German. Once the virus had reached
Germany,

the

subsequent

spread

of

infections

was

facilitated

by

super-spreader

social

events such as a carnival session in Gangelt, a small town in the district of Heinsberg on the
border

to

the

Netherlands,

a

beer

festival

in

the

small

city

of

Mitterteich,

district

of

Tirschenreuth, and a wine event in Bretzfeld, Hohenlohekreise. These super-spreader events
create local cluster effects if the social event is mainly attended by locals. In fact, even two
months after the above events took place, these were still the districts with the highest
number of known infections per 100,000 citizens in Germany.

Map 1 displays known Sars-CoV-2 cases, normalized by population, in German districts on
13 April. Even at a first glance we see that the rate of infection declines from South to North
and from West to East. Even within the Western part of Germany, regions in which a greater
share of the population is Catholic also have a higher incidence, which may be correlated to
spreader

events

such

as

carnival

that

is

much

more

popular

in

predominantly

Catholic

regions. The North-South divide appears to be stronger than the East-West divide. This may
be down in part to the greater ease by which Southern Germans can reach by car what
turned out to be virus hotspots in ski resorts in Northern Italy and Austria.

Map 1: Distribution of Known Sars-CoV-2 Infections Per Capita, April 13

Once the existence and dangers of the pandemic have become public knowledge, people
and governments implement precautionary measures and the spread of the virus slows
down

(Maier and

Brockmann

2020; Schmitt

2020). At

the

same

time,

the

geographical

pattern of infections slowly changes. For a virus to spread, social interaction between an
infected and an uninfected person is required. Since the number of new infections remains
strongly influenced by the number of active infections in a district, the pattern that has
evolved during phase 1, will not disappear quickly. Thus, hotspots remain hotspots for some
time.

But not forever. Map 2 shows the distribution of new positive Sars-Cov-2 tests between 13
April and 17 May. Whilst the North-South and East-West divides are still present, clearly the
distribution of new infections already starts to look different from the distribution of cases
on 13 April.

In phase 2 of the pandemic and despite the enduring and strong path-dependency, which
map 2 visualizes, the correlation of the spread of the infection with socioeconomic factors
changes.

Map 2: Distribution of New Known Sars-CoV-2 Infections Per Capita, 13 April to 17 May

The ability to reduce social interactions and to ‘stay home’ is not distributed evenly in a
society (Almagro and Orane-Hutchinson 2020a, 2020b). The spread of the virus in phase 2 is
shaped by the extent to which individuals manage to reduce their social contacts. In general,
white collar activities can be moved to a home office, while other workers still need to commute to their workplace and work if their employer does not lock down the workplace.
Poorer people find social distancing more challenging than richer people, having less access
to resources to shield them from the economically damaging effect of the lockdown. The
further spread of the virus becomes increasingly socially regressive. Regardless of how and
where the virus had spread first in the initial phase of the pandemic, in phase 2 the virus is
likely to become a poor man’s disease.

To test these predictions, we study the social stratification and the dynamics of the coronavirus pandemic in Germany. Specifically, we analyze the geographical distribution of known
coronavirus cases across 401 local districts in Germany. We find that, firstly, the initial risk of
becoming infected during phase 1 was higher in richer districts and was lower in more
socially deprived districts.

Secondly, we also

provide evidence of

the socially regressive

nature of new infections once phase 2 has begun. Richer districts and districts with a higher
percentage of the workforce who are university educated now see lower new infections,
whereas the initial safety advantage of more socially deprived districts vanishes.

Methods
The transition from phase 1 to phase 2 is a smooth process rather than a hart cut, as this
depends on when people start consciously changing their behavior and some do so earlier
than others. Still, a definite break comes with the lockdown. The first German states to go
into lockdown were Bavaria and the Saarland. Their curfew begun on 21 March; one day
later the whole of Germany followed. Hartl et al. (2020: 26) find that “confirmed Covid-19
cases in Germany grew at a daily rate of 26.7% until 19 March. From March 20 onwards, the
growth rate drops by half to 13.8%, which is in line with the lagged impact of the policies
implemented

by

the

German

administration

on

13

March

and

implies

a

doubling

of

confirmed cases every 5.35 days. Before 20 March, cases doubled every 2.93 days.”

Ideally, therefore, we would test our first prediction with data on cases from late March or
early April, since it takes roughly a week from the implementation to the effectiveness of
policy measures on infection rates. Unfortunately, the first date at which we were able to
capture the full distribution of confirmed infections across all German districts is 13 April,
with data sourced from the website of the Robert Koch Institute. Whilst clearly introducing
measurement error as overlapping with the second phase of the pandemic, the strong path
dependency

of

any

pandemic

means

that

the

stock

of

infections

on

13

April

will

be

sufficiently strongly correlated with the stock of infections around 30 March, which would
have been the ideal date.

To study our second prediction, we take as our second dependent variable new infections
that happened in the second period between 13 April and 17 May. These new infections all
occurred after people had time to adjust to the by now fully known risks and the lockdown
had

been

imposed.

We

divide

the

initial

stock

of

infections

and

the

new

infections

thereafter by population size in a district in 10,000 people. Consequently, the dependent
variables in our regressions represent cases and new infections per capita. We estimate our
regression models with ordinary least squares and robust standard errors.

As our measure of wealth of a district we include the average income subject to income tax
in thousands of Euro. We also control for the share of the workforce that is universityeducated. This variable is a proxy for the share of the population that can move work from a
home

office.

To

measure

social

deprivation

we

include

two

variables,

namely

the

percentage share of the population in a district that receives social welfare benefits as well
as the unemployment rate. For brevity, we only show results for the first variable but results
are

qualitatively

similar

if

we

include

the

unemployment

rate

instead.

Average

taxable

income is highly negatively correlated with the population share of social welfare benefits
and the unemployment rate at r = -0.46 and r = -0.58, which is why we include average
taxable

income

and

the

population

share

of

social

welfare

benefit

recipients

only

in

separate regressions.

As two, admittedly crude, measures to account for the way in which the virus first entered
Germany and spread initially we include the latitude location of a district and the share of its
population that is Catholic. The former accounts for the ease by which residents could drive
to the Alps for ski tourism, whilst the latter account for the greater popularity of carnival as
potential super-spreader events in predominantly Catholic districts. A further way in which
we account for the path dependency of the pandemic is by including the stock of cases on
13 April into

the

regressions with the new

infections

and 17 May as

dependent variable. The correlation between April 13 infections and new infections on May
17 is approximately 0.59. The variable can function as a proxy for the risk of new infections
stemming from existing infectious cases in the district.

In addition, we include dummy variables for the nature of habitation of a district, namely
whether it is predominantly urban, and for the extreme remoteness of a district. The virus
should spread more easily in more densely populated urban habitats (Zelner et al. 2012;
Ameh 2020) and while extreme remoteness is often seen as a costly locational disadvantage
(Redding and Sturm 2008; Dasgupta et al. 2012), it partly protects the local population from
infections as there will be less exchange with people from the outside. All data for the
explanatory variables are sourced from regional databases of the German statistical offices.

with a standard deviation of 12.3. By stark contrast, average taxable income is negatively
associated with a higher share of new infections after 13 April. A district that is richer on
average by 10,000 Euros is estimated to have 1.6 fewer new infections per 10,000 people.
The mean of new infections per 10,000 people is 6.2 with a standard deviation of 5.7. Richer
districts were initially more affected but manage to have fewer new infections than poorer
districts in the second phase of the pandemic. The same is true for districts with a higher
share of university-educated workforce. A ten percentage points increase in this share is
associated with 1.4 fewer infections per 10,000 people.

Our results are substantively similar to those reported in tables 1 and 2 if we include fixed
effects for the 16 states that make up the Federal Republic, except that the positive association
of average taxable income with the initial stock of cases becomes statistically insignificant.

The opposite pattern emerges for the population share of social welfare benefits as the
central explanatory variable – see table 2. Districts with a larger population share of social
welfare benefit recipients initially had a safety advantage as they report lower cases on 13
April. One fewer case per 10,000 people is associated with a two percentage points increase
in the population share of social welfare benefit claimants among the district population.
This statistically significant negative association disappears for new infections in model 4
and actually turns positive, if only marginally statistically significant. More socially deprived
districts lose their initial safety advantage in the second phase of the pandemic.

We find that latitude maintains its negative association with the initial stock of cases on 13
April and with new infections thereafter. The catholic population share has a statistically
significant positive association with initial cases but not with new infections. The urbanity of
a district is not statistically significantly associated with the initial stock of cases on 13 April
and only marginally so with new infections in model 2. The 18 districts that are considered

the

negative association for cases on 13 April is only marginally statistically significant in model

Discussion
The COVID-19 pandemic does not simply predominantly affect poorer and socially deprived
neighborhoods more than richer and less deprived ones. Evidence from the US and the UK
suggests that such an outcome is possible, but as the evidence from Germany presented in
this

article

demonstrates,

one

cannot

generalize

to

other country

settings.

In

Germany

richer districts were more affected and socially deprived neighborhoods were less affected
in the first phase of the pandemic mainly because ski tourism is expensive and because the
districts geographically closer to the Alps are also relatively wealthy and have little social
deprivation.

This pattern started to change in the second phase of the pandemic following the lockdown.
The safety advantage that socio-economically disadvantaged districts had in the initial phase
disappears in the second phase. Controlling for the strong path dependence in infections
