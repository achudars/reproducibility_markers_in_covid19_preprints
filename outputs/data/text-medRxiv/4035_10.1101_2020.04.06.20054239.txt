Abstract
The Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) outbreak has caused havoc across the world.
Subsequently, research on COVID-19 has focused on number of cases and deaths and predicted
projections have focused on these parameters. We propose that the number of tests performed is a
very important denominator in understanding the COVID-19 data. We analysed the number of
diagnostic tests performed in proportion to the number of cases and subsequently deaths across
different countries and projected pandemic outcomes.
We obtained real time COVID-19 data from the reference website Worldometer at 0900 BST on
Saturday 4th April, 2020 and collated the information obtained on the top 50 countries with the
highest number of COVID 19 cases. We analysed this data according to the number of tests
performed as the main denominator. Country wise population level pandemic projections were
extrapolated utilising three models - 1) inherent case per test and death per test rates at the time of
obtaining the data (4/4/2020 0900 BST) for each country; 2) rates adjusted according to the
countries who conducted at least 100000 tests and 3) rates adjusted according to South Korea.
We showed that testing rates impact on the number of cases and deaths and ultimately on future
projections for the pandemic across different countries. We found that countries with the highest
testing rates per population have the lowest death rates and give us an early indication of an
eventual COVID-19 mortality rate. It is only by continued testing on a large scale that will enable us
to know if the increasing number of patients who are seriously unwell in hospitals across the world
are the tip of the iceberg or not. Accordingly, obtaining this information through a rapid increase in
testing globally is the only way which will enable us to exit the COVID-19 pandemic and reduce
economic and social instability.

Introduction
The Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) outbreak has caused havoc across the world after it was
first reported in Wuhan, China 1,2. Subsequently, research on COVID-19 has exploded to understand
the new disease and its impact on mankind3-16. However, the number of baseless articles resulting in
fake news articles has also gone up exponentially17-19. A number of models have been adapted by
policymakers to predict the course of COVID-19 across the world4,6,13,20. The reason for such models
is to ensure that healthcare systems can plan services to help them cope with the demands of this
new disease which is resulting in serious cases leading to hospitalisation3,8. Core elements of the
prediction models have been the number of cases and deaths reported and these studies
extrapolated the numbers forward to the population over time4,6,13,20. Given the pandemic course of
COVID-19, it has become common practice to compare its spread in different countries using case
fatality rates3,4,7,13. However, such methods only tell us part of the story. Vast differences amongst
countries in their testing policies for varied reasons including availability of testing equipment,
infrastructure, resources and local governing policies affect case fatality rates.

In addition,

comparing case fatality rates between countries which are at different stages of the epidemic in
their region would be erroneous as rates at the beginning and end would be lower compared to
rates at the peak when healthcare services are stretched to their limits. Therefore, the search for a
common yardstick or denominator is necessary to compare different countries so that the data can
be extrapolated for global comparison. Over the past four weeks, as COVID-19 spread further
around the world, testing rates have picked up in most countries. We propose that analysis of the
number of diagnostic tests performed in proportion to the number of cases and subsequently deaths
in the underlying populations of different countries is the best way to predict what might happen
next. We analysed this from the ACALM Big Data research unit.

Methods
We obtained real time COVID-19 data from the reference website Worldometer at 0900 BST on
Saturday 4th April, 2020 and collated the information obtained on the top 50 countries with the
highest number of COVID-19 cases21. From this source, we obtained many parameters including the
number of country wise COVID-19 cases, deaths, tests performed, cases per million population,
deaths per million population and tests per million population. China and Saudi Arabia were
excluded due to lack of data on number of diagnostic tests performed, therefore numbers 51 and 52
were included in the compiled top 50 list.
We obtained case fatality rates by dividing the number of deaths by the number of cases
represented as a percentage. Next, tests per positive case were calculated by dividing the number of
tests by the number of cases. We then calculated the number of cases per test and number of
deaths per test by dividing the number of cases and deaths respectively, by the number of tests
represented as a percentage (a case per test rate and a death per test rate). Subsequently, we
obtained the population of these countries (in millions) from the number of cases divided by the
number of cases per million. We can obviously obtain more accurate country population statistics
from other sources but to maintain our consistency of the data source and methodology (for all
countries), we derived the information from this data only. We then analysed the above in three
steps.
Firstly, we extrapolated the population level pandemic data for each country in terms of cases and
number of deaths according to each country’s case per test rate and death per test rate as
calculated as a snapshot at the time of obtaining the data.
There are a number of limitations to the methodology used when taking a snapshot of these
countries at a point in time, as done above, especially because each country is likely to be on a
different part of the pandemic curve and extrapolating to the population level data is not likely to be

accurate. Therefore, we further undertook a consistent adjustment according to countries which
performed the most tests; in favour of larger countries with bigger populations we chose an
arbitrary cut off of 100,000 tests per country. 15 countries had undertaken more than 100,000 tests
and as all these countries showed differences in their cases/test and deaths/test we took the 15
country group as a whole to obtain an adjustment factor according to the cases/test and
deaths/test. Using this we derived a case per test rate of 13.53% and a death per test rate of 0.77%
for the 15 country group. Based on the above numbers, we extrapolated figures at the population
level for all 50 countries to calculate the predicated number of cases and deaths.
We felt it necessary to undertake further analysis, the third analysis, to adjust the data to a country
which is progressing towards the latter half of the pandemic curve – South Korea

22-24

. Ideally,

undertaking this adjustment with data from China would be most appropriate but data for the
number of diagnostic tests performed in China was not available.

The adjustment factor for South

Korea was a case per test rate of 2.23% and 0.04% death per test rate.
Hence our country wise population level pandemic projections were based on 1) inherent case per
test and death per test rates at the time of obtaining the data (4/4/2020 0900 BST) for each country
2) rates adjusted according to the countries who conducted at least 100000 tests and 3) rates
adjusted according to South Korea. Our analyses are shown in the tables and figures. No additional
analyses were performed.

Results
Full data obtained on 4/4/2020 are shown in Table 1 for the top 50 countries with highest number of
COVID-19 cases in the world. Table 2 shows the countries according to number of tests performed
per positive diagnosed COVID-19 cases. Table 3 shows population level pandemic projections for
cases and deaths according to each individual country’s case per test and death per test rate on
4/4/2020 0900 BST.

Table 4 shows population level pandemic projections adjusted for the

combined case per test and death per test rate of the 15 countries group that have performed at
least 100000 tests. Table 5 shows the population level pandemic projections adjusted for the case
per test and death per test rate of South Korea. Figure 1 show a scatter plot to show the relationship
between the case fatality rate and the testing rate as a percentage of the total population of the
country for the countries which have tested at least 1% of their total population. Italy was excluded
from this scatter plot as it was an outlier with a case fatality rate of 12.25%.

Discussion
COVID-19 statistics are complex and comparing different countries based on number of total cases,
deaths and/or case fatality rate does not show the complete picture (Table 1).

A common

denominator is required to make senses of these numbers and we propose that this denominator is
the number of diagnostic tests performed. In our analyses we showed the deaths and cases in
relation to the number of tests performed and presented population level pandemic projections
based on these. This is particularly relevant in the current environment where testing parameters
vary across different countries leading to non-uniformity in projections. It is important to discuss
each of our different analyses in turn, the rationale, drawbacks and what it means for different
countries.
As table 2 shows, the number of tests per positive case is an important parameter because it is an
indication of how widely the testing policy of the respective country has followed the advice from
the World Health Organisation (WHO)1. Analysis using tests per positive case approach favours richer
countries with smaller populations such as the UAE which tests over 174 people per positive case.
However, there are exceptions to this such as Russia and India which both have large populations.
This data suggests that both countries are undertaking a large number of tests to detect one positive
case. In these countries the overall percentage of population tested is low. Bias in these figures
could be the reliability of the reported number of tests performed. For example, the figures for
India as released by the Indian Council of Medical Research25 in terms of numbers tested are not as
high as the raw data obtain from this source but for consistency in dealing with all the raw data in
the same way, we analysed according to the data obtained from Worldometer. Of course similar
bias could be inherent for the testing data for all countries but in our defence we have treated all the
raw data obtained in the same way for consistency and have opened up the data for scrutiny.
Another important factor to consider here is the testing policy followed in these countries. Are the
countries at the top of this table testing a cohort of people who have a low possibility of carrying this

infection? If only those with symptoms are tested then individuals are more likely to test positive for
COVID-19 leading to a low test per positive number. If these countries test the sickest of patients as
you would expect in countries with the largest populations and limited testing kits to do, then high
testing rates per positive case is even more remarkable as it may suggest lower virus rates compared
to other countries but this cannot be concluded from this study. Furthermore, the reliability of local
testing kits is an important factor as there are a number of reports of COVID-19 patients testing
negative numerous times before a positive test11. South Korea can be considered as an exception to
this because following an explosion of cases initially, they embarked on an extensive testing policy
along with isolation policies combined with the utility of mobile tech and applications to inform the
public about real time locations of positive cases. As such, it is widely accepted that South Korea are
further along the pandemic curve and the rates of new cases and deaths have significantly reduced
22-24

.

Projections for the pandemic on an individual population level are very important for governments
to plan and organise healthcare systems in response. COVID-19 presents a unique problem because
there is no immunity for this in the community, nor a vaccination or targeted medical treatment.
Given that this is a highly contagious disease that spreads very quickly, if a large part of the
population suffer from the disease in a short space of time, even if majority of cases are mild, a small
minority of severe/critical cases will still lead to significant pressures on healthcare systems as now
seen in Italy, Spain and the USA (particularly New York). Globally lockdowns have been instated to
reduce the spread of infection, allow the healthcare systems to cope with the condition and “flatten
the curve” of the pandemic. These were not enforced all at once and the projections in table 3 are
based on the data available on 4/4/2020 and a snapshot depending on the actions, policies of
individual countries. Much more complex models have been undertaken by different groups which
included time as a variable 20. However, we propose that testing rate is a very important parameter
in projecting the outcomes of the pandemic. Therefore, whilst it seems far-fetched to suggest that
Indonesia may end up with over 7 million deaths from less than 2000 cases reported so far, we have

to note that only just over 7000 tests have been performed for a country of 283 million. There are a
number of factors for low testing rates such as local policies, lack of resources and equipment and it
is impossible to discuss them all; we point out that testing rates are extremely important in
projecting the outcomes of the pandemic particularly in countries with large populations. In this
context, if we look at countries such as the UK and India both of which have tested over 100000
tests, given the large populations and their case per test rate and death per test rate on 4/4/2020,
both countries have projections for over 1000000 deaths.
As mentioned the position of any given country on the pandemic curve is important in determining
population level projections and since we proposed that testing rates have an impact on projections
we adjusted all projections to the combined case per test and death per test rates of all the
countries that have performed over 100000 tests. This analyses is shown in table 4. We also felt
that projections should be done on the case per test and death per test rate for South Korea given
the countries position on the pandemic curve and are shown in table 422-24. Both these analyses are
biased in terms of predications for total deaths for countries with larger populations. For example in
spite of the case per test and deaths per test rate being low in India, as the population of the country
is large, the projections are still over 10 millions deaths as per table 4 (adjustment according to
countries which have performed more than 100,000 tests) and 500,000 deaths as per table 5 (South
Korea adjustment).
It is also no coincidence that none of the top 10 countries in table 4 or table 5 have tested at least
1% of the total population. We looked at the countries that have tested at least 1% of their
populations and looked at their cases fatality rate. We excluded the 10th country on the list – Italy
because of its high case fatality rate of 12.25%. All other countries had a case fatality rate of 3% or
lower. We then correlated the case fatality rate with percentage of the population tested as shown
in figure 1. This approach showed higher percentage of population tested in countries with lower
populations who have tested a higher proportion of their total population, but not in all cases. Both

Germany (population 83 million) and to a lesser extent Australia (population 25million) and have
tested more than 1% of their population and showed low case fatality rates (1.4% Germany and
0.54% Australia). Provided that their testing criteria is reliable, these figures may serve as early
indicators of the actual mortality rate for COVID-19 and these low figures are encouraging.
None of these methods used for projections are likely to hold true in reality. If we go back to the
analyses for South Korea and its projections of approximately 20,000 deaths, there have been only
177 deaths in South Korea so far. It seems highly improbable that for a country where the number
of cases and deaths have significantly tailed off would end up with 19,952 deaths. Furthermore, the
herd immunity concept has been a strategy to contain disease spread not only for COVID-19 but
across a number of pandemics such as Swine Flu

26

. Although it is widely debated as to what

percentage of the population would need to be affected by the disease to confer herd immunity, a
figure of 60% has been widely used27-29. Even if we adjust the South Korea figures (table 5) to 60%,
we will probably still over estimate the number of deaths.
Where does all of this leave us and what is the point of all these statistics and analyses? Clearly
from the example of South Korea we can contain COVID-19 and in spite of differences of the specific
policies of lockdown between countries, social distancing and limiting spread are the broad themes
to take forward. The analyses in this study highlight the importance of testing as the relevant
denominator for which all the COVID-19 data should be related to. The testing policy is advocated
strongly by the WHO in their COVID-19 statements1. The suggested early indication of a low
mortality rate from our analyses, coupled with the fact that COVID-19 is a new disease affecting the
globe in a short time, it is highly plausible that the serious cases and deaths we are seeing in the
some countries may be the tip of the iceberg of a disease that has spread widely. If we look at
influenza data there are millions of cases and up to half a million deaths worldwide every year due
to flu and these tend to be seasonal in spite of vaccination programmes and herd immunity to some
extent 27-30. In the case of COVID-19 we might be experiencing the full whammy of a disease without

immunity, globally all at once resulting in deaths. The magnitude of these deaths in perspective to
other diseases such as Influenza may not be high30. Our analyses in this study do not prove this
theory but the only thing that can is continued extensive and rapid testing across the globe. This may
be the only exit strategy to prevent COVID-19 related economic and social breakdown.
