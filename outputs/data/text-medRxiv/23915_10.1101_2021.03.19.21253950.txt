In the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic there has been an
increase of the use of antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT). The performance of
Ag-RDT vary greatly between manufacturers and evaluating their analytical limit of detection
(LOD) has become high priority. Here we describe a manufacturer-independent evaluation of
the LOD of 19 marketed Ag-RDT using live SARS-CoV-2 spiked in different matrices: direct
culture supernatant, a dry swab, and a swab in Amies. Additionally, the LOD using dry swab
was investigated after 7 days’ storage at -80°C of the SARS-CoV-2 serial dilutions. An LOD of ≈
5.0 x 102 pfu/ml (1.0 x 106 genome copies/ml) in culture media is defined as acceptable by the
World Health Organization. Fourteen of nineteen Ag-RDTs (ActiveXpress, Espline, Excalibur,
Innova, Joysbio, Mologic, NowCheck, Orient, PanBio, RespiStrip, Roche, Standard-F, StandardQ and Sure-Status) exceeded this performance criteria using direct culture supernatant applied
to the Ag-RDT. Six Ag-RDT were not compatible with Amies media and a decreased sensitivity
of 2 to 20-fold was observed for eleven tests on the stored dilutions at -80°C for 7 days. Here,
we provide analytical sensitivity data to guide appropriate test and sample type selection for use
and for future Ag-RDT evaluations.

Introduction

40

During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic,

41

reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has become the gold standard for

42

diagnosis of acute infection1 . However, RT-PCR technologies have several limitations: they are

43

not deployed easily, require significant laboratory infrastructure, reagents, and skilled staff, and

44

during this pandemic shortages in global supply have presented challenges2–4. In addition, the

45

turnaround time from sample collection to result can be up to 72 hours compromising the

46

effectiveness of triage, isolation, and contact tracing strategies5,6. In comparison, rapid

47

diagnostic tests (RDTs) based on antigen detection (Ag-RDT) can determine the presence of

48

the virus in a clinical sample on site in less than 30 minutes without the need for a laboratory.

49

Ag-RDTs are faster, cheaper and can be available at the point-of-care (POC), which is

50

especially important for implementation in community and low-resource settings, where limited

51

laboratories and trained staff are available, and there may be suboptimal cold chain capacity to

52

ensure appropriate conditions for more complex testing 7–9. Furthermore, their use could also

53

enable rapid isolation of cases and their contacts.

54

Ag-RDTs are less sensitive than RT-PCR, but clinical evaluation data is emerging that

55

demonstrates Ag-RDTs are accurate at detecting the vast majority of individuals with a high-

56

viral load (cycle threshold (Ct) on RT-PCR ≤ 25.0 or >106 genomic virus copies/ml)7,10–16. In

57

addition, in outbreak scenarios, a diagnostic test with lower sensitivity but a fast result enables

58

quick interventions such as self-isolation and isolating contacts of cases 17. Implementation of

59

Ag-RDTs into testing algorithms would allow rapid detection and isolation of new cases and

60

thereby support the test, trace and isolate strategy, aiming to stop transmission chains and

61

reduce the impact of COVID-19.

62

Ag-RDTs have been recently used for screening asymptomatic people in high prevalence areas

63

and frontline workers to quickly identify persons with a SARS-CoV-2 infection to adapt infection

64

prevention and control measures, thus preventing transmission in the community18–20. A mass

65

testing program screening asymptomatic people in Slovakia using Ag-RDTs was shown to

66

reduce the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections by >50% within two weeks18.

67

Despite the increased adoption of Ag-RDTs as an alternative of RT-PCR, independent

68

analytical sensitivity data is currently lacking for many rapid antigen tests. Evaluation of Ag-

69

RDTs using spiked samples in the laboratory before proceeding on clinical specimens is of

70

paramount importance because the sensitivity of Ag-RDTs is highly variable depending on the

71

manufacturer, ranging 0%-95% in respiratory samples7,21–24 .

72

Here we describe a single-center, manufacturer-independent analytical validation of nineteen

73

commercially available Ag-RDTs. The aims of the study were to assess the limit of detection

74

(LOD) using viral culture in different sample matrices: direct culture supernatant, dry swab and

75

swabs in Amies. The effect on the LOD of one freeze-thaw cycle following storage at -80°C was

76

also explored; demonstration of adequate performance using this sample type could support

77

future rapid evaluation of Ag-RDTs with stored material.

78

Results

79

LOD using different matrices

80

The LOD was evaluated in three matrices: direct culture supernatant, dry swab and swab in

81

Amies. Direct viral culture supernatant was used as it is the standardized protocol for the

82

evaluation of LOD in Ag-RDTs25. Dry swab matrix using the proprietary swab kit was selected to

83

evaluate the LOD in the sample type as defined in the instructions for use (IFU). Finally, swab in

84

Amies was used to assess the use of the same swab used for RT-PCR as a sample type for Ag-

85

RDTs.

86

A predefined performance criterion of an analytical LOD of ≤ 5.0 x 102 plaque forming units

87

(pfu)/ml (≈ 106 genome copy numbers (gcn)/ml) using direct culture supernatant was selected

88

based on current WHO and national standards 25,26. Fourteen of nineteen Ag-RDTs evaluated in

89

this study had an LOD of ≤ 5.0 x 102 pfu/ml (ActiveXpress, Espline, Excalibur, Innova, Joysbio,

Mologic, NowCheck, Orient, PanBio, RespiStrip, Roche, Standard-F, Standard-Q and Sure-

91

Status) using direct culture supernatant and the remaining had an LOD of 1.0-5.0 x 103 pfu/ml

92

(Biocredit, Genedia, iChroma and Wondfo) (Figure 1). Espline, iChroma, Innova Panbio and

93

Roche had the lowest LOD using direct culture supernatant reaching 0.5-1.0 x 102 pfu/ml,

94

followed by ActiveXpress, Excalibur, Mologic, Orient, Standard-Q and Sure-Status and with an

95

LOD of 2.5 x 102 pfu/ml. Biocredit, Genedia, Respi-Strip, Standard-F and Wondfo and were the

96

least sensitive with an LOD of 0.5-5.0 x 103 pfu/ml. See Figure 1 and Supplementary materials

97

for detailed LODs on all Ag-RDTs.

98

The LOD using dry swab was poorer in all tests when compared to direct culture supernatant

99

with the exception of Mologic, where the LOD was the same using direct culture supernatant

100

and dry swab. The LOD using dry swab was ≤ 5.0 x 102 pfu/ml only in four Ag-RDT (Espline,

101

Mologic, Roche and Sure-Status), 1.0-5.0 x 103 pfu/ml in seven (Bioeasy, Innova, NowCheck,

102

Orient, Panbio, Respi-Strip and Standard-Q) and ≥ 1.0 x 104 pfu/ml in seven (ActiveXpress,

103

Biocredit, Genedia, iChroma, Joysbio, Standard-F and Wondfo). The least sensitive using dry

104

swab matrix was Joysbio with an LOD of 2.5 x 105 pfu/ml (Figure 1).

105

None of the Ag-RDTs evaluated specifically indicate compatibility with swabs in Amies media.

106

However, four tests recommend the use of universal or viral transport media (UTM/VTM)

107

(Biocredit, Respi-Strip, Roche and Wondfo), three tests do not recommend the use of UTM/VTM

108

(NowCheck, Standard-F and Standard-Q), and the remaining kits do not mention the use of any

109

transport media. Six Ag-RDTs (Excalibur, Joysbio, NowCheck, Orient, Sure-Status and Wondfo)

110

were found to be incompatible with the Amies media, as these showed a positive test line with

111

the negative control sample. Of these, Wondfo is the only kit which recommends the use of

112

transport media. LODs using swabs in Amies media was poorer than using dry swabs except in

113

two test where the LOD was the same as with the dry swabs (PanBio and Standard-Q).

115

We investigated whether the absorbance of the proprietary swabs provided with the Ag-RDT

116

kits affected the LOD compared with direct culture supernatant i.e. if a less absorbent swab

117

resulted in a poorer LOD in dry swab compared with the LOD obtained in direct culture

118

supernatant for the same test. To test this hypothesis a Spearman’s correlation coefficient was

119

performed comparing direct culture supernatant and dry swab matrices from the same Ag-RDT.

120

The volume recovered by swabs per tests are shown in supplementary materials. Spearman’s

121

correlation coefficient did not show any statistically significant correlation between the LOD and

122

the volume recovered by swabs (P=0.421, ρ= -0.50), volume of extraction buffer (P=0.483, ρ= -

123

0.011) and dilution factor (calculated by considering the volume recovered by swabs and

124

volume of extraction buffer) (P=0.460, ρ=-0.025).

125

LOD one freeze-thaw cycle after 7 days at -80°C

126

Ag-RDTs are intended to be POC tests and thus the majority are recommended for use with

127

freshly collected specimens. To validate test performance, use of stored material is much

128

easier. Therefore, we performed this experiment to understand whether LOD is impacted

129

following sample storage. The LOD of each of the tests using SARS-CoV-2 serial dilutions after

130

7 days storage at -80°C and one freeze-thaw cycle is shown in Table 2.

131

The LOD for 6 tests (ActiveXpress, Bioeasy, iChroma, NowCheck, RespiStrip and Wondfo) was

132

equivalent using stored, frozen viral dilutions compared to fresh preparations. Three tests

133

showed increased sensitivity (lower LOD by 2 to 5-fold) (Joysbio, PanBio and Standard-Q), and

134

eleven showed poorer performance with a higher LOD of 2-fold (Biocredit, Espline, Roche and

135

Sure-Status), 4-5 (Excalibur, Mologic and Orient), ten (Innova) and twenty (Genedia and

136

Standard-F).

137

Discussion

138

Here, we present the analytical performance of nineteen antigen rapid tests, which are currently

139

on the market and in use in multiple countries. Analytical LODs are a useful proxy of clinical

140

sensitivity, and the most standardized way to evaluate multiple antigen tests head-to-head, as

141

each test requires a separate swab from patients. An approximate LOD of ≤ 5.0 x 102 pfu/ml (≈

142

1.0 x 106 copies/ml) calculated using direct culture supernatant, has been proposed as the

143

minimal analytical sensitivity by the WHO and the Department of Health and Social Care

144

(DHSC, U.K.) 25,26. Fourteen of the nineteen marketed Ag-RDTs evaluated in this study fulfill this

145

requirement (ActiveXpress, Bioeasy, Espline, Innova, Mologic, NowCheck, PanBio, Excalibur,

146

RespiStrip, Joysbio, Roche, Standard-F, Standard-Q, Sure-Status and Orient).

147

Evaluation of the LOD using the kit-specific swabs immersed in the viral culture dilutions offers a

148

more representative comparison to the level of sensitivity for clinical samples than using direct

149

viral culture. Only four of the nineteen tests detected samples with concentrations ≤ 5.0 x 102

150

pfu/ml (≈ 1.0 x 106 gcn/ml) when using the dry swabs (Mologic, Espline, Roche, Sure-Status)

151

and none of the tests met that LOD target when using swabs in Amies, like due to the dilution

152

factor with the addition of 1 ml Amies buffer as well as potential chemical interactions between

153

the media and the kit-specific buffers.

154

The more absorbent swabs will absorb more viral material, and so we investigated if the volume

155

retained by the swab had any bearing on the LOD of each test when compared with the LOD

156

achieved with direct culture supernatant. We took into account the volume recovered from the

157

swab and the volume of proprietary buffer provided, but no correlation was found, this suggests

158

that other factors may reduce the sensitivity when using swabs such as differences in the

159

formulation of the proprietary buffers. A reduction in sensitivity using clinical samples may be

160

observed compared to swabs in viral culture, as clinical samples are more viscous than culture

161

media, potentially resulting in less viral material being absorbed onto the swab. The efficiency of

162

the recovery is also likely to be increased by the centrifugation method used in our protocol.

163

We also evaluated the LOD and compatibility of the Ag-RDTs using a swab placed in Amies

164

media, as these are routinely used to collect upper-respiratory samples in SARS-CoV-2

165

suspected individuals for diagnosis using RT-PCR27,28. If the same swab proves to be suitable

166

for both RT-PCR and rapid antigen testing, one swab can be used for both tests as part of a

167

serial algorithm. As well, the frozen leftover Amies media from RT-PCR testing could be used

168

for future Ag-RDT evaluations. Either approach could simplify clinical and/or evaluation

169

workflows. None of the Ag-RDT manufacturers specifically recommend the use of Amies media,

170

and we demonstrated here that this ‘off-label’ sample preparation should be used with caution:

171

six tests had false positive results (Espline, Excalibur, Joysbio, Sure-Status and Orient) and

172

sensitivity was also reduced due to the additional volume of Amies.

173

The effect of storage at -80°C and one freeze-thaw cycle was evaluated, with eleven Ag-RDTs

174

showing a loss of sensitivity by up to twenty-fold. A small decrease in sensitivity has been

175

reported in in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing (<1 RT-PCR cycle threshold) after one and two

176

freeze-thaw cycles 29 but there are no studies so far that have reported the effect of freeze-thaw

177

on antigen detection. Results here highlight that the use of frozen material with Ag-RDTs should

178

be performed with caution. The fact that three tests showed two-to-five-fold better sensitivity

179

after an additional freeze thaw-cycle could not be explained in here, a further investigation is

180

required with a larger sample size to rule out whether this phenomenon was within the margin of

181

error of the experiment.

182

Three out of nineteen Ag-RDTs (Bioeasy, iChroma and Standard-F) rely on detection of a

183

fluorescent signal using a reader. Though this may enable quantitative detection and potentially

184

more consistent result interpretation, we did not find any improved sensitivity for this test format.

185

Furthermore, Ag-RDTs that rely on a device may limit testing throughput if only one test can be

186

read at a time. The reader also presents additional costs, as well as potential technical and

187

maintenance issues which can be a barrier to implementation.

188

This analytical study has some limitations, as only a single isolate

189

(REMRQ0001/Human/2020/Liverpool) was used to assess the LODs but our results are

190

consistent with other recently-published analyses30,31. To the authors knowledge, all 19 tests

191

evaluated here detect the nucleoprotein, presumably chosen for abundance and relative low

192

mutation rate and therefore hypothesized to pick up all currently known variants 32,33. Another

193

limitation is that only one lot per kit was evaluated.

194

There is a growing number of studies suggesting that although antigen detection is less

195

analytically sensitive than nucleic acid amplification techniques, it may strongly correlate with

196

culturable virus, which may be a proxy for transmissibility. Hence Ag-RDTs could be informative

197

for test, trace, isolate processes for the most infectious individuals 10–15. Viral loads have been

198

estimated to range from 108 to 1011 gcn/ml in the most infectious patients34–36. The majority of

199

Ag-RDTs evaluated here have an LOD predicted to successfully diagnose infected individuals

200

with higher viral loads in this range across all matrices, except Joysbio that had an LOD of 5.4 x

201

108 gcn/ml in dry swab. Further, Biocredit, iChroma, Standard-F and Genedia tests had LOD

202

greater than 1.0 x 108 gcn/ml when using swabs placed in Amies and

203

In conclusion, the most sensitive tests with an LOD ≤ 5.0 x 102 pfu/ml (≈ 1.2 x106 gcn/ml) on dry

204

swabs and direct culture supernatant were Espline, Mologic, Sure-Status and Roche and the

205

least sensitive on all matrices were Biocredit, iChroma, Standard-F and Genedia. The

206

differences of LODs found here between tests and/or matrices ranged between 2-3 logs (i.e.

207

100-1,000 fold). Some tests showed impaired performance when using freeze-thaw material

208

and/or Amies media. These findings highlight the importance of understanding assay specific

209

performances and the need to select the appropriate sample matrix and the right test for each

210

intended use, particularly for laboratories and evaluation programs that seek a rapid validation

211

of Ag-RDT using frozen stored samples and ‘off-label’ specimen preparations. The LODs

212

obtained in this comprehensive assessment of analytical sensitivity are consistent with rapidly

213

emerging clinical performance data 9,11,37 demonstrating the high clinical accuracy of Ag-RDTs

214

for rapid detection of individuals with high viral loads, which can be very impactful for initiation of

215

isolation and tracing measures.

242

The SARS-CoV-2 isolate REMRQ0001/Human/2020/Liverpool was propagated in Vero E6 cells

243

(C1008; African green monkey kidney cells), maintained in DMEM with 2% fetal bovine serum

244

(FBS) and 0.05 mg/ml gentamycin. Ten-fold serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 stock were made

245

starting from 1.0 x 106 pfu/ml to 1.0 x 102 pfu/ml using culture media as a diluent (DMEM with

246

2% FBS % and 0.05 mg/ml gentamycin). Two-fold dilutions were made below the ten-fold LOD

247

dilution to refine the LOD. For quantification, viral RNA was extracted using QIAmp Viral RNA

248

mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The genome copies/ml

249

(gcn/ml) were calculated using the COVID-19 Genesig RT-qPCR kit (PrimerDesign, UK). RT-

250

qPCR testing was carried out using the Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen, Germany), with a ten-fold serial

251

dilution of using quantified specific in vitro-transcribed RNA38. A total of five replicates were

252

tested for each standard curve point and extracted RNA from each culture dilution was tested in

For the direct viral culture matrix, a specific volume of the serial dilutions was added directly to

258

the extraction buffers at a 1:10 ratio except for Respi-Strip which was added at 1:1 ratio with the

259

extraction buffer following the IFU.

260

For dry swab testing, the proprietary nasopharyngeal (NP) or nasal (N) swabs included in each

261

individual kit was used except for Respi-Strip, which does not include swabs, and the

262

recommended Eswab (Copan, Italy) was used instead. To prepare the dry swab matrix, the

263

swab was soaked in 1 ml of the virus culture dilution series for 6-8 seconds, followed by

264

immersion in the prescribed amount of proprietary reaction buffer solution.

265

For the preparation of spiked wet swabs, Eswab in Amies media (Copan, Italy) was used across

266

all tests. The swab was first immersed in the serial viral dilutions for 6-8 seconds, then placed

267

into the Amies media to mimic the sample collection stage. Ag-RDTs were evaluated by then

268

immersing the same swab into the extraction buffer, except for test Respi-Strip where 100µl of

269

the Amies was mixed at 1:1 with the extraction buffer following its IFU.

270

For all Ag-RDTs and matrices, the sample volumes applied, and procedures were performed as

271

specified in the test specific IFUs.

272

The LOD was defined as the lowest dilution at which all three replicates were positive. Every

273

dilution was tested in triplicate and non-spiked culture media and Amies were used as negative

274

controls. Results were interpreted by two operators, each blinded to the result of the other. If a

275

discrepant result was obtained, a third operator read any discrepant tests for a 2/3 result.

276

Volume of liquid recovered by swabs

277

We investigated the effect of the absorbance of the proprietary swabs provided with the Ag-RDT

278

kit in the LOD using dry swab, i.e. if a less absorbent swab resulted in a poorer LOD on dry

279

swab compared with direct culture supernatant. To compare the effectiveness of each NP and N

280

swab to recover sample, the amount of liquid absorbed by the swabs was measured. Five

281

replicates of each swab brand were immersed in culture media for 6-8 seconds, then taped on

282

the inside of a 50ml centrifuge tube. These were then centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1000g and

283

the amount of liquid released was measured using a micropipette. The dilution factor of each

284

test type was calculated taking into account the volume recovered by swab and volume of

285

proprietary buffer in which the swab was immersed.

286

The degree of correlation of LOD by swabs with the volume recovered by swab type, volume of

287

proprietary buffer and dilution factor were investigated by Spearman’s correlation coefficient rho

288

(ρ). Statistical significance was set at P <0.05.

289

LOD after 7 days at -80° C and one freeze-thaw cycle

290

After performing the LOD experiments, the viral culture dilutions were stored at –80 °C for 7

291

days and then the LOD experiments were performed again using the dry NP and N swabs. This

292

would help to assess the use of stored clinical samples could be used to facilitate evaluation of

293

Ag-RDTs.
