Abstract

23

Background: Low testing rates and delays in reporting hinder the estimation of the mortality

24

burden associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. During a public health emergency, estimating

25

all cause excess deaths above an expected level of death can provide a more reliable picture of

26

the mortality burden. Here, we aim to estimate the absolute and relative mortality impact of

27

COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico.

28

Methods: We obtained weekly mortality time series due to all causes for Mexico, and by gender,

29

and geographic region from 2015 to 2020. We also compiled surveillance data on COVID-19

30

cases and deaths to assess the timing and intensity of the pandemic and assembled weekly series

31

of the proportion of tweets about ‘death’ from Mexico to assess the correlation between people’s

32

media interaction about ‘death’ and the rise in pandemic deaths. We estimated all-cause excess

33

mortality rates and mortality rate ratio increase over baseline by fitting Serfling regression

34

models and forecasted the total excess deaths for Mexico for the first four weeks of 2021 using

35

the generalized logistic growth model.

36

Results: We estimated the all-cause excess mortality rate associated with the COVID-19

37

pandemic in Mexico in 2020 at 26.10 per 10,000 population, which corresponds to 333,538

38

excess deaths. Males had about 2-fold higher excess mortality rate (33.99) compared to females

39

(18.53). Mexico City reported the highest excess death rate (63.54) and RR (2.09) compared to

40

rest of the country (excess rate=23.25, RR=1.62). While COVID-19 deaths accounted for only

41

38.64% of total excess deaths in Mexico, our forecast estimate that Mexico has accumulated a

42

total of ~61610 [95% PI: 60003, 63216] excess deaths in the first four weeks of 2021. Proportion

of tweets was significantly correlated with the excess mortality (ρ=0.508 [95% CI: 0.245, 0.701],

44

p-value=0.0004).

45

Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has heavily affected Mexico. The lab-confirmed COVID-

46

19 deaths accounted for only 38.64% of total all cause excess deaths (333,538) in Mexico in

47

2020. This reflects either the effect of low testing rates in Mexico, or the surge in number of

48

deaths due to other causes during the pandemic. A model-based forecast indicates that an

49

average of 61,610 excess deaths have occurred in January 2021.

Background

53

SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread unabated in many parts of the world. In particular, Latin

54

American countries are being heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with a total of

55

22,467,574 cases including 709,062 deaths as of March 12, 2021 [1]. Mexico, one of the highly

56

populated countries in the world with approximately 42% of the people living in poverty [2],

57

documented the first imported COVID-19 case on 27th February, 2020 and currently ranks 3rd in

58

the world in terms of numbers of COVID-19 reported deaths, with a total of 192,488 recorded

59

deaths (7.33% of total deaths globally) as of March 12, 2021 [1]. Delays in the implementation

60

of social distancing interventions, mixed reactions towards the stay-at-home order

61

recommendations, and phased reopening of the country have facilitated sustained transmission of

62

COVID-19 in Mexico [3].

63

Mexico has one of the lowest per-capita COVID-19 testing rates in the world with about 17 tests

64

per 1000 people in total [4]. The low testing rates, compounded by reporting delays, hinders the

65

estimation of the mortality burden associated with the COVID-19 pandemic based on

66

surveillance data alone. Instead, a more reliable picture of the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on

67

mortality can be derived by estimating excess deaths above a baseline or expected level of death

68

[5, 6]. These estimates can provide information about the deaths that are directly or indirectly

69

attributed to the pandemic [6]. Indeed, some deaths could be misclassified as COVID-19 deaths,

70

or some could be occurring in the context of overburdened health care systems. Thus, tracking

71

all-cause mortality in near real time can help assess whether excess deaths are occurring during a

72

specific period of time and spatial area [6].

73

Here we report our estimates of the absolute and relative mortality impact of the COVID-19

74

pandemic in Mexico using cyclical Serfling regression models together with publicly available

75

weekly all-cause mortality data from 2015 to 2020 by gender and for Mexico City and other

76

areas of Mexico. Further, we collected and analyzed weekly twitter data from Mexico about

77

‘deaths’ during the COVID-19 pandemic in correlation with the excess all-cause death rate and

78

COVID-19 death rate. We supplemented our analyses with social media data from Twitter,

79

which has been found useful to interpret epidemiological trends [7]. In prior work, Google

80

Trends, Wikipedia searches, and Twitter data have been used for predicting COVID-19 deaths

81

[8]. Taking this data fusion approach even further, other researchers have used Twitter data,

82

alongside smart thermometer data, up-to-date clinician search logs as well as Apple and Cuebiq

83

mobility indices to build near-real time early warning systems for COVID-19 [9].

84

We also generated predictions of excess mortality for the first 4 weeks of January 2021 using

85

generalized logistic growth model [10].

86

Methods

87

Data: We obtained weekly all-cause death counts based on epidemiological weeks for Mexico

88

which were also stratified by gender and geographic region from January to December 2020 as

89

well as for the preceding 5 years (2015-2019) in order to establish a baseline mortality level [11].

90

We accessed publicly available weekly mortality data available from National Institute of

91

Statistics and Geography (INEGI) for the years from 2015 to 2018, and data available from

92

National Population Registry (RENAPO) for the years 2019 and 2020 [11]. The last week of

93

December 2020, also includes first 2 days of January 2021. To gauge the timing and relative

94

intensity of the pandemic in Mexico, we examined surveillance data characterizing the weekly

95

number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths, which were obtained from the

96

official website of the Mexican Ministry of Health through the Directorate General of

97

Epidemiology [12]. Population size estimates used to calculate mortality rates were obtained

98

from National Population Council (CONAPO) of Mexico [13].

99

Statistical analysis: To investigate and quantify the mortality pattern associated with the

100

COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, we estimated excess all-cause mortality rates per 10,000

101

population at the national level and for Mexico City, and other areas of Mexico and by gender.

102

The excess death rate corresponds to the overall mortality rate above a seasonal baseline of the

103

expected mortality rates in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic using standard statistical

104

methods [5, 14-17].

105

Definition of pandemic periods and excess mortality estimation: We estimated the baseline

106

mortality level by fitting cyclical Serfling regression models to all-cause deaths in non-COVID-

107

19 period, after excluding data from March to December 2020. We included a combination of

108

linear terms with sine and cosine terms describing time trend and seasonal change respectively,

109

which is described by the following equation [5, 15]:

110

Weekly death rates(t) = a + α × t + β*sin(2 × π/52.17 × t) + γ*cos(2 × π/52.17 × t),

111

Where, a is the intercept and t represents the epidemic week.

112

Once a weekly baseline and 95% CI were established, periods of COVID-19 pandemic were

113

defined as the weeks in 2020 where the observed all-cause mortality rate exceeded the upper

114

95% confidence limit of the baseline mortality level. The same pandemic period was used for

115

estimating the total excess mortality rate for entire Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico excluding

116

Mexico City, and gender specific excess mortality rates using established methodology [5, 14-

117

17]. Excess all-cause mortality rate was defined as the difference between the observed and

118

model adjusted baseline mortality rates for each week constituting the pandemic period.

119

Negative excess mortality estimates were replaced by zeros in our analyses. Overall pandemic

120

excess mortality attributed to all cause for total population, each gender group, Mexico City, and

121

Mexico excluding Mexico City was calculated by summing the excess death rates across the

122

pandemic weeks in 2020 [14, 16]. We also calculated the rate ratio (RR), the ratio of observed

123

all-cause mortality rate during pandemic period to the model predicted baseline mortality level in

124

the absence of COVID-19 for the given group.

125

Twitter data analysis: We used a clean version of the publicly available dataset of tweets version

126

42 [18], the clean version of this dataset removes all re-tweets, keeping only directly initiated

127

posts by users. We filtered all tweets, by removing all other languages via their ISO 639-1

128

language code, to only keep the tweets in Spanish (es) and those that originated from Mexico via

129

its country code MX. Additionally, we removed tweets from news agencies and bot accounts.

130

We used the following terms to subset the tweets per day: "muerto, muerta, fallecio, murio,

131

deceso, fallecimiento, defunción, óbito, expiración, defuncion, obito, expiracion, perdio la vida,

132

sin vida". In English, these terms reflect the meanings “dead, deceased, died, death, expiration,

133

lost life, lifeless”. We collected a total of 1,223,096 and 32,423,282 unique tweets reflecting

134

death and total tweets respectively from March to December 2020. Next, we overlayed the curve

135

of proportion of tweets on death out of total tweets in a given week over the mortality rate curve

136

to inspect the relationship between the mortality rate and the proportion of tweets. We also

137

calculated correlation coefficients between proportion of weekly tweets and the weekly excess

138

death rate and the weekly COVID-19 death rate.

139

Short term forecast of excess deaths: We used generalized logistic growth model (GLM) to

140

predict excess deaths during the first four weeks of 2021. GLM characterizes epidemic growth

141

by estimating (i) the intrinsic growth rate, (ii) a dimensionless “deceleration of growth”

142

parameter,  and (iii) the final epidemic size, ଴ . The deceleration parameter modulates the

143

epidemic growth patterns including the sub-exponential growth (0<  <1), constant incidence (

144

=0) and exponential growth dynamics ( =1). The GLM model is given by the following

145

differential equation:

153

utilized parametric bootstrapping approach with a Poisson error structure [10].

Our estimates of both the absolute and relative excess mortality rate as measured by the rate ratio

224

of observed vs baseline mortality rate was highest for Mexico City (2.09) compared to other

225

areas of Mexico (1.62) and for males (1.76). The rate ratio (RR) at the national level was

226

estimated at 1.67.

227

Finding from the average weekly forecast of excess deaths generated from the GLM model

228

calibrated to weeks starting from November 22 to December 27, 2020 shows that Mexico had a

229

total of ~61610 excess deaths in first four weeks of 2021 (Figure 5).

Discussion

238

Monitoring the excess mortality rate during the course of a pandemic is one of the key

239

approaches for evaluating pandemic mortality impact [19]. In this study we characterized the

240

excess mortality impact during COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico from March 1, 2020 to January

241

2, 2021. The pandemic was associated with an excess mortality rate of 26.10 per 10,000

242

population (a total of 333,538 excess deaths). Further, COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed deaths

243

comprised only 38.64% of total excess deaths during the studied period. Our findings indicate

244

that the COVID-19 pandemic has exerted a particularly devastating mortality burden on the

245

Mexican population. We found that the all-cause excess-death rate among males was twice as

246

high as the excess death rate among women in Mexico. This finding is in line with the previous

247

studies, indicating that more men die from COVID-19 than women [20-22]. Several factors such

248

as differences in the prevalence of comorbidities [23] as well as risk behaviors such as smoking

249

and drinking [24], frequency of hand washing [25-27] and delays in health care seeking [22]

250

could be contributing to a higher risk of COVID-19 death among males.

251

We found that both the all-cause excess death rate and the rate ratio were the highest in Mexico

252

City, compared to rest of the country. A previous study reported that Mexico City was the most

253

affected area during 2009-10 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic in Mexico [28]. Mexico City is one

254

of the most crowded cities in the world [29] and has been significantly affected by air pollution

255

for decades [30]. Prior work has identified high population density [31, 32] and long-term

256

exposure to ambient air pollution [33, 34] as significant predictors of COVID-19 death. Besides,

257

the long term exposure to ambient air pollution, and living in overcrowded setting is not random

258

and might interact with other social determinants of health [34] such as poverty, unemployment,

259

and lack of healthcare access that increase the risk of death during natural disasters.

260

The fraction of COVID-19 attributed excess deaths was lower in Mexico (38.64%) compared to

261

more than 65% in the USA [19, 35], and Germany [36]. From March to May 2020, the number

262

of all cause excess deaths in the US was only 28% higher than the official record of COVID-19

263

deaths for that period [19]. Subsequently, from March 15, 2020 to January 30, 2021 an estimated

264

527,500 excess deaths occurred in the USA of which 83.3% were attributed to COVID-19 [37].

265

In developed countries like Germany where the COVID-19 pandemic management has been

266

considered a success story, the estimated excess number of deaths during the first wave of

267

pandemic was lower than the reported number of COVID-19 deaths (+8071 estimated excess

268

deaths vs. 8674 reported COVID-19 deaths) [36]. The low proportion of COVID-19 deaths out

269

of total excess deaths could be driven by low COVID-19 testing rates in the country [4], delays

270

in reporting COVID-19 deaths [38], diagnostic delays for fatal conditions such as cancer [39],

271

issues related to the sensitivity of reverse transcriptase-PCR (RTPCR) test [40], disruption of

272

routine health care owing to the collapse of the health system, or intentional choices of not

273

visiting health facilities due to fear of contracting the virus, exacerbating the effects on the health

274

of vulnerable groups [41]. Moreover, the pandemic triggered a mental health crisis that has given

275

rise to an increase in self-harm and suicide [42, 43]. Our forecast of excess deaths during the first

276

four weeks of 2021 showed an increasing trend which was in line with the high morbidity trend

277

of COVID-19 cases surrounding that time period [44].

279

Our Twitter signal indicate an increasing trend in the Twitter chatter about deaths from mid-

280

January 2020 that peaked in mid-February 2020. This increase coincided with a series of events

281

including the declaration of the novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan as a public health

282

emergency of international concern (PHEC) (January 30, 2020), and the WHO-China joint

283

mission of experts from different countries to inform planning on next steps in the response to

284

COVID-19 outbreak (16-24 February, 2020) [45]. Following a short period of decline, the

285

Twitter chatter showed a substantial increase, just as the trend in lab-confirmed COVID-19

286

deaths started to rise in Mexico. However, it substantially declined during the next few months

287

probably due to pandemic fatigue. This normalization of the pandemic also reflects people’s

288

beliefs of the government signaling that the pandemic was subsiding during the second half of

289

2020 [46, 47].

290

Several factors could explain the large number of all-cause excess deaths in Mexico (333,538).

291

First, Mexico has a high burden of non-communicable diseases. In 2019, the top 5 leading causes

292

of deaths were ischemic heart disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, and stroke

293

[48]. These comorbidities have been found to be associated with severe outcomes including

294

death due to COVID-19 [49, 50]. Therefore, COVID-19 pandemic in a country like Mexico with

295

high prevalence of chronic diseases, as well as with a health system struggling with absenteeism

296

and health worker infections might have led to this alarming number of excess deaths [51, 52]. It

297

is worth noting that, Mexico has the highest number of health worker deaths due to the COVID-

298

19 pandemic (~1400 deaths) in the world [53-55].

299

The COVID-19 pandemic has a higher all cause excess mortality compared to 2009 A/H1N1

300

pandemic in Mexico [56] as shown in Table 2. Past work has reported estimates of respiratory

excess mortality in Mexico City during the 1918-19 influenza pandemic [57]. Our all-cause

Our study has several limitations. As excess death rates will be strongly different among

309

subgroups (it is quite high among the elderly, and those with underlying diseases), overall

310

estimate is affected by structure of the population. A detailed data on death certificate with age

311

and underlying diseases information will provide more accurate estimates. Likewise, we can not

312

rule out the possibility of negative excess deaths following this elevated period of excess

313

mortality due to new innovations on vaccination and treatment which might prevent serious

314

complications and deaths, or due to the reduction of the vulnerable populations such as the

315

elderly during the initial pandemic years. Similarly, the COVID-19 deaths data that we have used

316

might be underestimated because of different factors such as very low testing rates in Mexico,

and misclassification of COVID-19 deaths. Further studies are needed to shed light on the extent

318

of deaths directly attributable to COVID-19 and those that are related to other causes.

319

Conclusion

320

Our estimate of all-cause excess mortality rate at 26.10 per 10,000 population during COVID-19

321

pandemic in Mexico provides a reliable estimate of the mortality impact of COVID-19 in a hard-

322

hit Latin American country with a low testing rate. As more refined mortality data becomes

323

available on different sub-groups of the population, further studies on excess mortality could

324

elucidate the mortality impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. Our findings indicate that

325

Mexico has been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
