ABSTRACT:
Background: The current COVID19 pandemic began in December 2019 and rapidly expanded to
become a global pandemic. The COVID 19 presents multitude of clinical disorders, ranges from
asymptomatic infection to severe disease, which can accompanied by multisystem failure leading to
death. The immune response to SARS CoV 2 is understood to involve all the components of the
system that together causes viral elimination and recovery from the infection. However, such immune
responses implicated in the disease has varied presentation ranging from mild to a severe form, which
appears to hinge on the loss of the immune regulation between protective and altered responses. In
this study, we want to unravel this association of immune responses to various clinical variables,
which might have a major role to play, while generating the immune response. The objective was to
test this hypothesis in our settings and comparing the results of serologic tests from a group of
COVID 19 patients and will analyzed the disease severity in comparison.

Conclusions: The data presented in this research study did not find any statistical significance
between SARS CoV 2 IgG antibody levels with COVID 19 disease severity, duration of symptoms,
age, gender, and length of convalescence.

Methods: Testing for SARS COV2 IgG Antibody was done with chemiluminescent assay on the
Ortho Clinical Diagnostic’s (OCD) Vitros 5600 platform.
Results: A total of 106 COVID 19 patients were included in this study, of whom 61 were male and 45
were female. Their mean age was 43.7 years (range 17–83) and the median interval between initial
symptom onset and sample collection was 12.33 days. Eighty patients (82%) had mild or moderate
symptoms and twenty-six patients (18%) had severe symptoms. The antibody titers were positive in
99 patients (93%) and were found negative in 7 patients (7%). When comparing patients with
mild/moderate symptoms and patients with severe/critical diseases, no statistically significant
difference was observed between their gender ratios (P = 0.373) and age composition (P = 0.224).

The ongoing pandemic of COVID 19 is causing big threat to communities around the world. It is
caused by a virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is a
highly contagious virus and spread by respiratory route. Patients most commonly presented with
fever, cough and respiratory symptoms. Mortality and morbidity quite largely depends upon the host
immune response and people with co-morbidities are at greater risk from COVID-19 infection.. As a
general immune principle, body immune response to acute phase of infection starts with IgM
antibody, whereas IgG and IgA antibodies appears 3 to 4 weeks to post-exposure 1,2. However, it has
been observed that the immune response against this virus is highly variable in nature. It is a general
assumption that the patients who have had more severe disease appear to have higher levels of
important neutralizing antibodies3. Similarly, patients who had mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 have
low levels of neutralizing antibodies. Many authors have reported diverse presentation of SARS-CoV2 antibodies and varied presentation with different clinical features 4,5,6,7. The present study is
undertaken to understand the status of antibody generation in confirmed COVID-19 patients and to
analyze its correlation with disease severity, if any in our hospital settings.

The present study is a single-center, open-label, cross-sectional, retrospective study. The Subjects
were recruited into single-arm consulting COVID19 OPD of a tertiary care cancer hospital in North
India. All the subjects presenting to our hospital from the start of the pandemic to 11 September 2020,
with COVID-19 infection were eligible for enrolment into the study. In keeping with Indian Council
of Medical Research (ICMR) protocols and international practice, patients were deemed to have
COVID-19 if a Real-time Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay test and/or cartridge-based
nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) test from a combination of the naso-oropharyngeal swab
was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients with a radiological or clinical suspicion of COVID-19, but a
negative RT-PCR test were not included in this analysis. A total of 108 subjects were enrolled in the
study who were tested positive either by RT PCR) or CBNAAT by GeneXpert. The testing data were
extracted from hospital electronic medical records (EMR) and the clinical data was obtained
telephonically for detailed medical history. The data set includes patient demographics, comorbidities, and course of illness, various symptoms, type of symptoms, and the severity of symptoms
specific to COVID-19.

Method: Testing for SARS COV2 IgG Antibody was done with chemiluminescent assay on the
Ortho Clinical Diagnostic’s (OCD) Vitros 5600 platform, US with the dedicated reagents. Antibody
levels are presented as chemiluminescence values divided by cutoff (S/CO) levels. The cutoff level
used in the study was 1.00, as per the kit insert from OCD. The RT PCR test was performed on Quant
5 studio (Thermo-Fisher life science) employing an ICMR approved real-time test kit (TRUPCR®),
whereas CBNAAT testing was done with Cepheid®USA (GeneXpert® assay).

Statistical Analysis: Continuous variables are presented as Mean±S.D, whereas for categorical
variables, frequencies, and percentages were provided. Shiparo- Wilk test was used to test the
normality of the data for the data which follows the normal distribution (P-value >0.05). An
Independent t-test was used to compare the age and duration of symptoms between Mild/Moderate
and Severe patients. A Chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables with the severity of
symptoms. All data entries and statistical analyses have been performed by using SPSS® Version
23.0 software. All the reported p-values were two-sided and p-values <0.05 were considered to
indicate statistical significance.

A total of 106 COVID-19 patients were included in this study, of whom 61 were male and 45 were
female. Their mean age was 43.7 years (range 17–83) and the median interval between initial
symptom onset and sample collection was 12.33 days. Eighty patients (82%) had mild or moderate
symptoms and twenty-six patients (18%) had severe symptoms. (Table 1). The antibody titers were
positive in 99 patients (93%) and were found negative in 7 patients (7%). When comparing patients
with mild/moderate symptoms and patients with severe/critical diseases, no statistically significant
difference was observed between their gender ratios (P = 0.373) and age composition (P = 0.224).
The average duration of the convalescence period was 12.14 days to 12.92 days in mild to moderate
cases and severe cases respectively with no statistical significance. Also, while analyzing various
symptoms of the patients, the majority of patients experienced fever (97%), myalgia (61%) cough
(60%), and weakness (37%) (Table 2). However, few patients experienced other symptoms e.g. loss
of taste, loss of smell, diarrhea, and gastritis with minor frequency. The antibodies were detectable in
samples collected over 90 days after onset of disease with the earliest seroconversion of IgG antibody
was observed 2 days after disease onset. The area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating
characteristic curve (ROC) to predict the best possible detection of antibodies in the serum postinfection was 0.704 with 95% CI (0.603-0.792) (Fig 1).

COVID 19 represents an array of various clinical forms ranging from asymptomatic to mild,
moderate, and very severe cases. In the present study out of 106 patients, males are affected more than
females. This varied presentation could be due to higher exposure risk to males. Around 82% patients
present with mild to moderate symptoms and 18 % patients present with severe symptoms. Majority
of subjects (97.2%) present with fever and 40-50% subjects complaint of associated symptoms of
cough, myalgia and weakness. More than 95% cases did not give history of any loss of taste or smell
or Nasal congestion. Sharma et al in the review article on global trends of clinical presentation also
enumerated similar trends of clinical presentation.8 The immunology of all these cases is different
and becomes more complex when the patients progresses to severe disease. The research studies done
by Long et al, Thevarajan et al, have found an association between high SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels
and COVID-19 severity 3, 9. A plausible explanation for this observation may be that patients
experiencing severe forms of the disease are exposed to higher viral load 9. Alternatively, it may
represent an overall exaggerated immune response driven either by "cytokine storms” or by
“antibody-dependent enhancement” (ADE) which are two known immune responses causing severe

lung tissue damage. However, as a counter explanation, many authors have found no association of
the antibody response against COVID-19 with the severity of the disease. A recent study by Phipps W
et al10, has concluded that the measurement of IgG and IgM antibodies did not predict disease
severity. The data studied herein also do not support the abovementioned association between high
SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels and COVID-19 severity. In effect, we failed to find differences in
SARS-CoV-2 IgGs levels between patients with mild, moderate, or severe symptoms, when they are
matched for age, sex, and co-morbidities. The threshold duration of antibody detection was 7 days
from the onset of disease with sensitivity and specificity of 71.11 and 57.14 respectively with area
under the curve (AUC) of 0.704 with 95% CI (0.603-0.792). Similar findings regarding antibody
detection after COVID-19 illness has been observed in other clinical studies by Rode etal11. Antibody
dynamics due to variable antigen presentation may contribute to false positive or negative results and
inconsistencies in seroprevalence studies12. In our opinion, a comparison between studies addressing
the abovementioned issue is challenging, thanks to notable variations in clinical characteristics,
categorization of severity, and ways SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are utilized for detection and
quantification.

175

The data presented in this research study did not find any statistical significance between SARS-CoV2 IgG antibody levels with COVID-19 disease severity, duration of symptoms, age, gender, and
length of convalescence. We finally conclude that a better understanding of the pathogenesis and
immunogenicity should be studied in greater detail to understand the ever changing immunogenicity
profile of SARS-COV-2.
