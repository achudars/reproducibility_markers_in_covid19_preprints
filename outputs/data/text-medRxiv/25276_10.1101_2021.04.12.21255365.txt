Abstract

21

Background: This new COVID-19 pandemic challenges health systems around the world;

22

therefore, it is extremely important to determine which patients with COVID-19 can evolve to

23

more severe outcomes. Accordingly, we decided to assess the role that comorbidities play in

24

death from COVID-19.

25

Methods: Two age groups (<60 and ≥ 60 years) were defined for analysis. Decision trees were

26

made to identify which comorbidities had the highest fatality rate (FR). Multiple logistic

27

regressions were performed to measure the association between comorbidities and death.

28

Results: A significant difference was found between the FR of <60 group and ≥ 60 group. The

29

most frequent comorbidity were cardiac diseases and diabetes. The combination of comorbidities

30

with the highest FR was diabetes with kidney disease. Combinations of more than two

31

comorbidities presented higher FR. The comorbidities had higher Odd ratios in the younger

32

group than in the older group.

33

Conclusions: Comorbidities seem to play a greater role in death from COVID-19 in the younger

34

group, while in the> 60 group; age seems to be the most important factor. We assigned a score to

35

the comorbidities and their combinations for both age groups to help the health personnel make

36

decisions.

Introduction

41

From the first case of COVID-19 that was reported in the city of Wuhan, China in December

42

2019 until the beginning of November 2020, 46 million infected people have been reported

43

worldwide.1 Of these 46 million, 2.6% have died. 1 This new pandemic challenges health systems

44

around the world and carries important ethical questions, especially under the need of rationing

45

health care in the context of scarce resources and crisis capacity. 2 For this reason, it is extremely

46

important to determine which patients with COVID-19 can evolve to more severe outcomes,

47

including death. Age, male gender, and ethnicity have all been reported to be associated with

48

severe COVID-19 outcomes.3,4 Also, comorbidities such as diabetes, kidney, respiratory, and

49

cardiovascular diseases have been reported as risk factors for severe outcomes by COVID-19. 3,5

50

Based on this, we decided to assess the role that comorbidities play in death from COVID-19 in a

51

large database from Brazil that includes recovered and deceased patients, to provide valuable

52

information for designing strategies for case management.

diagnostic test, age, sex, and disease evolution. Patients with missing data were excluded from

62

the database. We did not impose any further exclusion criteria to limit selection bias.

63

Study design

64

Two age-group were defined for the analysis with those <60 or ≥ 60 years-old. Decision trees

65

were built to order the comorbidities according to their frequency and the proportion of deaths

66

from COVID-19 reported. Then, the correlation of the absence/presence of the following

67

comorbidities: diabetes, immunosuppression, kidney, respiratory, and cardiovascular disease with

68

death from COVID-19 was analyzed. For this, a multiple logistic regression was performed to

69

identify which variables were associated with death from COVID-19. Also, the probability

70

obtained from logistic regressions (probability of dying when infected by COVID-19 if the

71

comorbidities were present) was used to calculate the area under the receiver-operator

72

characteristic curve (AUC). The AUC was used as a measure of the ability of the comorbidities

73

model to predict death from COVID-19. Finally, the values of probability obtained from logistic

74

regressions were used to assign a score to the comorbidities and the combinations of them. All

75

statistical analyses were carried with RStudio version 1.3.1093 (RStudio: Integrated

76

Development for R. RStudio, PBC, Boston, MA). Analyses with p-values <0.05 for a level of

77

significance of 95% were considered statistically significant. Figures were done with GraphPad

78

83

comorbidities registered in all the patients can be observed in Table S1 of supplementary

84

material. In our database, median age was 38 years old (IQR: 30-51); 46% were males and 54%

85

females. It was found that 2.1% of patients died while 97.9% were recovered. A statistically

86

significant difference was found between the fatality rate of <60 group (0.7%, n= 457557) and ≥

87

60 group (11.3% n= 74176) (p<0.01) (Fig. 2). Also, the median time between the onset of

88

symptoms and death was 20 days (IQR: 12-33), and no differences were found between age

89

groups.

90

Five comorbidities were recorded in the data file: cardiovascular disease, immunosuppression,

91

kidney disease, respiratory disease, and diabetes. Among 87.6% of the cases, no comorbidities

92

were registered; meanwhile, the most frequent comorbidity registered in the database was

93

cardiovascular disease (7.2% (39542/549733)), followed by diabetes (4.3% (23966/549733)),

94

respiratory disease (2.0% (11035/549733)), immunosuppression (0.9% (4934/549733)) and

95

kidney disease (0.5% (2684/549733)). In addition, It was observed that in the <60 group, cardiac

96

disease (Frequency= 4.3%) and diabetes (Frequency= 2.6%) presented a fatality rate of 1.6% and

97

0.5% (Fig. 3a). In addition, the highest fatality rate (19%) was found in individuals with diabetes

98

and kidney disease (Fig. 3a). In the ≥60 group the most frequent comorbidities were also diabetes

99

(Frequency =15%, fatality rate =19%) and cardiovascular disease, without diabetes, (Frequency

100

=12.4%, fatality rate =13%). At the same time, the combination of comorbidities with the highest

101

fatality rate was diabetes with kidney disease (fatality rate= 35%) and diabetes with kidney and

102

respiratory diseases (fatality rate= 47%) (Fig. 3b).

For the <60 group and ≥ 60 groups, the values of AUC=0.66 and AUC=0.61 were obtained,

respectively. As Fig. 4 shows, the comorbidities had higher ORs in the <60 group than in the ≥

118

60 group. In this first group, diabetes, kidney disease, and immunosuppression had the highest

119

ORs; whereas in the ≥60 group, the comorbidities with the highest ORs were kidney and

respiratory diseases (Fig. 4).

121

The logistic regression allowed us to assign a score to the comorbidities and their combinations,

122

from one (lower probability of a severe outcome) to eight (high probability of a severe outcome)

for both age groups. These scores were ordered into three categories of low, medium, and high

Discussion

135

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019, the reported case fatality rate

136

has varied. Early estimates from small cohorts of hospitalized patients indicated a fatality rate of

137

15%; later and with more data, the percentage of deaths fell from 11% to 4.3% and finally to

138

3.4%.8 In addition, 81% of patients with COVID-19 have a mild illness and never require

139

hospitalization.9 Therefore, for a better understanding of the causes that lead to severe results of

140

COVID-19, in this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed risk factors for death in individuals

141

with COVID-19 in a large database from Brazil with a fatality rate of 2.1%.

142

Older age has been reported by several authors as an important factor associated with the severity

143

of the disease or fatality in patients with COVID-19.4,5,10 In accordance with this, we found a

144

higher fatality rate in patients older than 60 years of age.

145

It is important to highlight the relevance of age-stratified analyses when examining the

146

association between comorbidities and fatality with COVID-19.5 In our study, the odd ratio (OR)

147

values for comorbidities varied depending on age group. In the <60 group, both higher ORs and a

148

higher AUC value were observed compared to those obtained for the ≥ 60 group. This suggests

149

that the comorbidities considered are able to better explain the fatality from COVID-19 in the

150

<60 group than in the ≥ 60 group. Therefore, the comorbidities seem to have an important impact

151

on death in the <60 group, while in the ≥ 60 group the comorbidities might play a minor role in

152

death from COVID-19. This suggests that the main risk factor in the older group is age itself,

153

which is consistent with previous findings for Brazilians patients.3

154

Diabetes was the most frequent comorbidity and had the highest OR value in the <60. Patients

155

who presented diabetes as comorbidity, reached a fatality rate of 0.5% and 19% in the <60 group

156

and ≥ 60 group, respectively (Fig. 2). Worth mentioning, Brazil is one of the countries with more

157

diabetes cases in the world, being the estimated prevalence of 11.9 % (95 % CI 7.7–17.8).11 The

158

evolution of COVID-19 has shown to be more severe in patients with diabetes and metabolic

159

dysfunction.12 Recent data suggests that COVID-19 could precipitate acute metabolic

160

complications of diabetes, such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemia. The potential

161

mechanisms that may increase susceptibility to severe COVID-19 in patients with diabetes

162

include: 1) higher affinity cell binding and effective entry of the virus, 2) decreased viral

163

clearance, 3) decreased T cell function, 4) increased susceptibility to hyperinflammation and

164

cytokine storm syndrome, and 5) presence of cardiovascular diseases.13 This becomes more

165

relevant when considering that the most frequent combination of comorbidities included diabetes

166

and cardiovascular disease, with a fatality rate of 6% and 20% in the <60 group and≥ 60 group,

167

respectively.

168

Another important risk factor is kidney disease. In the ≥ 60 group, this comorbidity together with

169

respiratory disease presented the highest ORs. Moreover, the combination of diabetes with

170

kidney disease caused the highest fatality rates. Since diabetes is the main cause of chronic

171

kidney disease,14 patients with these two comorbidities can represent diabetic patients in a more
10

172

severe stage of the disease or without adequate medical care. Interestingly, the human kidney has

173

been reported to be a target for SARS-CoV-215; however, it remains controversial whether

174

SARS-CoV-2 causes acute kidney injury.16

175

There is a wide spectrum of immunosuppressed patients, including patients with cancer, solid

176

organ transplant recipients, those taking antirheumatic drugs, primary immunodeficiency, and

177

HIV infection. We found that in both age groups, immunosuppression was a risk factor

178

associated with death from COVID-19. However, this should be interpreted with caution since

179

the database did not allow to determine precisely the underlying cause of the immunosuppression

180

and because there is controversy about the role immunosuppression in COVID-19. Previous

181

research indicates that patients with cancer and solid organ transplant recipients may have a

182

higher risk of developing more severe COVID-19.17,18 Nonetheless, immunosuppressed adults

183

with no further comorbidities might not be likely to have a severe clinical outcome.18 This

184

contradiction may be because the host's immune response is an important factor contributing to

185

the severity of COVID-19, through a dysregulation of innate immunity or an excessive

186

inflammatory response.19 Thus, immunosuppression, as a sole comorbidity, probably does not

187

determine a severe outcome.

188

As has been shown in this study, there are comorbidities that increase the probability of severe

189

COVID-19. Therefore, they should be considered in case management. Concerning this, we

190

assigned a score to each comorbidity to provide a possible order of priority. Based on the analysis

191

of this large database, there are small subgroups of cases that carry an exceedingly high risk of

192

death due to COVID-19.

193

It is important to understand the limitations of this study when interpreting these results. First,

194

possible selection biases cannot be ruled out due to the reduction of the data file. Second, the data

195

come from all the states of Brazil, but might not be representative of the entire population, and

196

the generalizability of the results beyond this cohort is unclear. However, it is worth noting the

197

high number of cases analyzed and that the proportion of the comorbidities in the database

198

(n=549733) is similar to in the original data file (n=8056794).

199

In conclusion, we demonstrate that diabetes, kidney disease, respiratory disease, cardiovascular

200

disease, and immunosuppression are risk factors related to death from COVID-19, where age

201

seems to be a determining factor. The combination of comorbidities increases the risk, which

202

must be considered and analyzed for clinical decisions.
