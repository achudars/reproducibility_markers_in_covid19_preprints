Abstract

Background: The serologic response of individuals with mild forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection
is poorly characterized.
Methods: Hospital staff who had recovered from mild forms of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using two assays: a rapid
immunodiagnostic test (99.4% specificity) and the S-Flow assay (~99% specificity).The
neutralizing activity of the sera was tested with a pseudovirus-based assay.
Results: Of 162 hospital staff who participated in the investigation, 160 reported SARS-CoV2 infection that had not required hospital admission and were included in these analyses. The
median time from symptom onset to blood sample collection was 24 days (IQR: 21-28, range
13-39). The rapid immunodiagnostic test detected antibodies in 153 (95.6%) of the samples
and the S-Flow assay in 159 (99.4%), failing to detect antibodies in one sample collected 18
days after symptom onset (the rapid test did not detect antibodies in that patient). Neutralizing
antibodies (NAbs) were detected in 79%, 92% and 98% of samples collected 13-20, 21-27
and 28-41 days after symptom onset, respectively (P=0.02).
Conclusion: Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in virtually all hospital staff
sampled from 13 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. This finding supports the use
of serologic testing for the diagnosis of individuals who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2
infection. The neutralizing activity of the antibodies increased overtime. Future studies will
help assess the persistence of the humoral response and its associated neutralization
capacity in recovered patients.

Introduction

A novel human coronavirus that is now named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. In response, many countries have
implemented large scale public health and social measures in an attempt to reduce
transmission and minimize the impact of the outbreak. As the benefits of these measures are
now becoming apparent in terms of a reduction in the daily incidence of SARS-CoV-2
infections and associated deaths, countries are looking for ways to lift these measures and
resume economic and social activities. Ideally, the lifting of measures would occur if the
population had built sufficient collective immunity, known as herd immunity, to the point that
any reintroduction of the virus would not trigger a new epidemic wave. In this context, it is
important to understand the extent to which infection has spread in communities, and to which
those who have been infected may be protected from re-infection. This requires further
understanding of antibody kinetics following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Numerous serologic assays are now available, which provide information on extent of infection
and estimates of protective immunity – that is, protection against re-infection. To date, it is
thought that for hospitalised patients with COVID-19, seroconversion occurs within the second
week following onset of symptoms, with a median time of 5-12 days for IgM antibodies and 14
days for IgG and IgA [1–6]. However, it remains unclear whether time to seroconversion may
differ according to disease severity, and early reports suggest that individuals with mild
infection may have delayed or absent seroconversion [4]. Further, the correlation between
detection of antibodies generated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and protective
immunity has not yet been established.

The first three COVID-19 cases identified in France were reported on 24 January 2020 in
travellers returning from Wuhan, China [7]. Between 17 and 24 February, an annual religious
gathering attended by 2500 people took place in Mulhouse, eastern France and resulted in a

SARS-CoV-2 superspreading event. Infected individuals went to regional hospitals, and this
led to a cluster of infected staff at the Strasbourg University Hospitals from the first week of
March. Most of them are young individuals who developed mild forms of disease.

The epidemic in Strasbourg, and specifically, the cluster of infected hospital staff, provides the
opportunity to use serologic assays, to assess antibody kinetics in individuals who had
recovered from COVID-19 and to understand how this correlates with protective immunity.

Methods

Participants
Between 6 April and 8 April 2020, all hospital staff from Strasbourg University Hospitals with
PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were invited to participate in the investigation. This
invitation included doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, dentists, medical students, orderlies,
hospital assistants, and hospital administrative staff.
Following informed consent, participants completed a questionnaire which covered
sociodemographic information, underlying medical conditions, and details related to SARSCoV-2 infection, including date of testing, date of symptom onset and a description of
symptoms. A 5 mL blood sample was taken from all participants.

Serologic response measurement
All serum samples were tested for antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 using two serologic
assays: 1) a rapid immunodiagnostic assay detecting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor
binding domain (RBD) developed by Biosynex®; 2) the S-Flow assay, a flow-cytometry based
assay that measures antibodies binding to the Spike protein (S) expressed at the surface of
target cells [8]. Two parameters can be calculated with this assay: the first is the percentage
of cells having captured antibodies, defining the seropositivity. The second is the mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI) of this binding, which provides a quantitative measurement of the
amount of antibodies and their efficacy [8]. As a control for the S-Flow tests, we included
samples from pre-epidemics individuals, providing cut-offs for the the S-Flow >99% specificity
([8] and Fig. 1A). The rapid immunodiagnostic assay has a specificity estimated at 99.4% for
the IgM, 100% for the IgG, and 99.4% for the combined IgM/IgG results (S.F.K., personal
communication). Samples were also tested for neutralization activity using a viral pseudotypebased assay [8]. Briefly, single cycle lentiviral pseudotypes coated with the S protein and
encoding for a luciferase reporter gene were preincubated with the serum to be tested at a
dilution of 1:100, and added to 293T-ACE2 target cells. The luciferase signal was measured

after 48h. The percentage of neutralization was calculated by comparing the signal obtained
with each serum to the signal generated by control negative sera. In some analyses, we
categorized the samples according to the extent of neutralization observed at the 1:100
dilution. Neutralizing activities >50% and >80% corresponded to inhibitory dilution 50% (ID50)
>100 and ID80 >100, respectively.

Statistical analyses
Seropositivity was defined as the presence of detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The
proportion of seropositive samples was compared by time between onset of symptoms and
collection of blood sample using chi-square test.
Antibody neutralizing activity was compared by age, gender, underlying medical conditions,
time from symptom onset and type of symptoms using chi-square or Fisher’s exact test where
appropriate. Logistic regression was used for multivariable analysis.
The S-Flow MFI and neutralization of sera were compared by delay since onset of symptoms
using the Kruskall-Wallis non-parametric test. The S-Flow MFI of sera with ID50 and ID80
above or below 100 were compared using Student’s t-test. The chi-2 test was used to evaluate
the association between investigated factors and neutralization levels.
All analyses were performed using Stata (Stata Corp., College Station, Texas, USA) or
GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, LLC).

Ethical considerations
This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04325646) and received ethical
approval by the Comité de Protection des Personnes Ile de France III. Informed consent was
obtained from all participants.
Results
Between 6 April and 8 April 2020, 162 hospital staff from Strasbourg University Hospitals who
had recovered from RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection participated in the

investigation. Two individuals who were hospitalized for COVID-19 were excluded from these
analyses to determine serologic responses in those with mild forms of COVID-19. Table 1
indicates the characteristics of these 160 hospital staff. The median age was 32 years (inter
quartile range (IQR): 26-44) and 50 (31.2%) were males. The majority of participants were
medical students (28.1%), doctors (20.0%) or nurses (19.4%).

In terms of possible sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 74 (46.2%) reported having had contact
with a COVID-19 patient either in the ward or in the emergency room. A further 38 (23.7%)
reported having had contact with a COVID-19 case outside the health care setting.

One hundred and fifty five (96.9%) had symptoms consistent with COVID-19 (dry cough, fever,
dyspnea, anosmia or ageusia). The median time between onset of symptoms and PCR testing
was 2 days (IQR:1-4), and the median time from onset of symptoms to blood sampling was
24 days (IQR: 21-28, range 13-39).

Figure 1 and Table 2 indicate the seropositivity rates detected by the three assays and
categorized by the delay between onset of symptoms and collection of samples. Across all
160 participants, 159 had detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by S-Flow (99.4%
sensitivity). The only participant whose serology was negative with all assays was a 58-yearold male with a body mass index of 32 kg/m2 and no other risk factors for severe COVID-19
disease. His blood was sampled 18 days after onset of symptoms which persisted at the time
of blood collection. The S-Flow MFI displays a significantly higher signal in individuals sampled
at days 28-41 compared to those sampled at days 13-20 (Figure 1A). These results suggest
that the overall amount or the affinity of the antibodies improved with time since onset of
symptoms.

The IgM rapid test appeared more sensitive than IgG (overall sensitivity: 88.1% vs 71.2%,
repectively), especially at the earlier timepoints (Table 2). The combination of IgG and IgM
rapid test data increased the sensitivity to 95.6%.

Figure 1B and Table 3 show the proportion of individuals with a neutralizing activity, using the
pseudovirus neutralization assay. The proprotion of samples with neutralizing activity
increased over time (Figure 1B), reflecting the increase of antibody titers observed with the SFlow. The proportion of individuals with an ID50 ≥100 were 79 %, 92% and 98% at 13-20, 2127 and 28-41 days after symptom onset, respectively (P=0.02) (Figure 1B).

The associations between the neutralizing activity and the type of symptoms, age, underlying
medical conditions and tobacco use are summarized in Table 3. The characteristics
associated with neutralizing activity (ID50 > 100) were time since onset of symptoms (P=0.02),
absence of asthma (P=0.02), and absence of a flu vaccine (P=0.02). In a multivariable model
including the three variables, none remained associated with neutralizing activity. We also
analysed the association of high neutralizing activity (ID80 ≥100) with patients characteristics.
High neutralizing activity was associated with time since onset of symptoms (P = 0.004),
having a dry cough (P = 0.04), male gender (P=0.07), high BMI (P=0.02), and high blood
pressure (P = 0.03). All these characteristics remained independently associated with high
neutralizing activity in multivariable analysis except for high blood pressure (P = 0.11). There
was no association between neutralizing activity and ageusia, anosmia, or fever.

We next examined the relationship between the extent of antibody response and the
neutralizing capacity of the sera. Regardless of the time post-symptom onset, samples with
ID50 and ID80 ≥100 displayed significantly higher signals in the S-Flow assay (Figure 1C).

Discussion
In this investigation, we described the serologic responses of 160 hospital staff who recovered
from PCR-confirmed mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most studies published to date have been
based on hospitalized patients, and therefore have not been able to evaluate serologic
responses in individuals with mild or subclinical infection. Since these individuals are currently
understood to represent at least 80% of all SARS-CoV-2 infections [9], it is crucial to assess
antibody responses in those with mild disease. In our study, we were able to show that all but
one (99.4%) participant had detectable levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from 13 days
after onset of symptoms. The differences observed between time to seroconversion across
the different assays reflect their sensitivity. The S-Flow assay, which displays a high
sensitivity, detected seroconversion in all but one sample. The rapid immunodiagnostic test
performed well 21 days after onset of symptoms. The rapid test therefore has utility as a tool
for diagnosis in the recovery phase of infection. The neutralization assay was positive in 91%
of the samples, and the extent of neutralization paralleled the levels of signal obtained with
the S-Flow and.
At the community level, countries that have implemented public health and social measures
to limit transmission are now lifting some of these measures. Most of the evidence to date
suggests that herd immunity after the first wave of the epidemic will be far from sufficient to
provide protection against a second epidemic wave [10]. In our study, neutralizing ID50 ≥100
were found in 91% of the individuals. We further report that the neutralization activity of the
serum increases with time, reaching 97% four weeks after the onset of symptoms. Therefore,
it is a fair assumption that the majority of individuals with mild COVID-19 generate neutralizing
antibodies within a month after onset of symptoms. Although not yet demonstrated, several
lines of evidence suggest that the presence of neutralizing antibodies may be associated with
protective immunity for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In humans, passive immunotherapy based on
transfer of antibodies from recovered COVID-19 patients decreases disease severity [1,3,6].
In a monkey model, protection from a second SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with the
presence of neutralizing antibodies in the serum [11]. SARS-CoV-2 NAbs are known to be

present in symptomatic individuals [5,12–14]. In a study of 175 convalescent patients with mild
symptoms, NAbs were most often detected 10-15 days after symptom onset [14]. However,
about 30% of recovered patients generated low titers of NAbs (≤1:500), even at a later time
point [14]. Our results are in line with this observation and indicate that recovery from mild
cases is generally, but not always, associated with high titers of NAbs in the serum. Indeed,
we report here that one month after the onset of symptoms, 98% and 77% of individuals
display Nabs with an ID50 and ID80 ≥100, repectively. Antibody titers are generally higher in
patients with severe or critical diseases [6,14]. Interestingly, in our study, individuals with
factors associated with more severe disease (e.g., male sex, high body mass index and high
blood pressure), were more likely to have high titers of neutralizing antibodies compared to
others. This may be due to a higher antigenic burden in such individuals, which will generate
a stronger humoral response, or may, on the contrary, suggest that some antibodies may play
a deleterious role during infection [15]. Future studies are warranted to characterize the
beneficial or detrimental role of specific antibodies in COVID-19 patients and the minimal titer
required for protection.

For patients with SARS-CoV-1, antibodies persist for at least 2 years after symptomatic
infection [16]. In the case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, the antibody
response is variable, not robust, and often undetectable when disease is mild [17–20]. Future
studies will help evaluating the persistence of antibodies upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. The
cohort of hospital staff described here provides the opportunity to study the duration of the
humoral response and the dynamics of the neutralization capacity of the sera. A clinical and
virological assessment of potential reinfections will also help establishing the links that may
exist between the antibody response and immune protection.

Figure 1. Analysis of SARS-Cov-2 antibody response. (A) Sera from the 160 HCW were surveyed for
anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies. S- Flow data are represented by the frequency of S+ cells (n=160, left
panel) and the median Fluorescence intensity (MFI) in positive samples (n=159, middle panel).
Historical pre-epidemic samples (pre) were included to determine backgrounds of S Flow (n=140).
Each dot represents a sample. Samples were grouped according to the number of days after
symptom onset. Statistical analyses were performed using Kruskall-Wallis with Dunn’s multiple
comparisons test or chi-2 test. * p<0.005. n.a.: not applicable (B) Neutralizing activity of the 160 sera.
The ability of each serum to neutralize lentiviral S- pseudotypes was assessed at a serum dilution of
1:100 (left panel). Samples are grouped according to the number of days after symptom onset. For
each time group, the frequencies of samples displaying a ID50 >100 (middle panel) or a ID80 >100
(left panel) were determined. Each dot represents a sample. ** p<0.005 Kruskall-Wallis with Dunn’s
multiple comparisons test. (C) Relationship between serological measurement and neutralizing
activity. The S-Flow MFI of samples displaying ID50 and ID80 above or below 100 are depicted.
Each dot represents a sample. **** p<0.0001 Unpaired t-test. The statistically significant differences
are depicted.
