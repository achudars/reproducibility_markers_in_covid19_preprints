ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND
Characterizing the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and developing accurate serologic
assays are needed for diagnostic purposes and estimating population-level seroprevalence.

METHODS
We measured the kinetics of early antibody responses to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of
the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 259 symptomatic North American patients
infected with SARS-CoV-2 (up to 75 days after symptom onset) compared to antibody levels in
1548 individuals whose blood samples were obtained prior to the pandemic.

RESULTS
Between 14-28 days from onset of symptoms, IgG, IgA, or IgM antibody responses to RBD were
all accurate in identifying recently infected individuals, with 100% specificity and a sensitivity of
97%, 91%, and 81% respectively. Although the estimated median time to becoming seropositive
was similar across isotypes, IgA and IgM antibodies against RBD were short-lived with most
individuals estimated to become seronegative again by 51 and 47 days after symptom onset,
respectively. IgG antibodies against RBD lasted longer and persisted through 75 days postsymptoms. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were highly correlated with neutralizing
antibodies targeting the S protein. No cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-targeted
antibodies was observed with several known circulating coronaviruses, HKU1, OC 229 E, OC43,
and NL63.

CONCLUSIONS
Among symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases, RBD-targeted antibodies can be indicative of previous
and recent infection. IgG antibodies are correlated with neutralizing antibodies and are possibly a
correlate of protective immunity.

INTRODUCTION:

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread rapidly around the world since first identified
in Wuhan, China, in December 20191. On March 11th, 2020 the World Health Organization
(WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic. As of July 13th, 2020, the disease has caused
12,750,275 confirmed cases and 566,355 deaths globally2.

Currently, our understanding of antibody responses following infection with SARS-CoV2 is limited3,4, including the magnitude and duration of responses, cross-reactivity with other
coronaviruses and viral respiratory pathogens, and correlates of protective immunity following
infection. A detailed characterization of antibody responses is needed to determine whether
antibody-based tests can augment viral detection-based assays in the diagnosis of active or recent
infections and to inform the design and interpretation of seroepidemiologic studies.

In this study, we characterize the kinetics and antibody isotype profile to the receptor
binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 in a longitudinal cohort of North
American patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and in pre-pandemic controls. We evaluated the
sensitivity and specificity of anti-RBD responses in detecting recent infection and estimated the
time it takes for cases to become seropositive (seroconversion) or return to seronegative
(seroreversion). We also examined how well these responses correlated with neutralizing
antibody activity directed at the S protein. Additionally, we evaluated the cross-reactivity of
these responses with other coronavirus RBDs and characterize assay performance using dried
blood spots.

MATERIALS/ METHODS:

Plasma/serum/dried blood spot (DBS) samples. Clinical samples were obtained from
individuals with PCR confirmed SARS-COV-2 infection presenting to the Massachusetts
General Hospital (MGH) in Boston, MA with fever and/or viral respiratory symptoms from
March to April 2020 and who met criteria for RT-PCR testing. These criteria changed over time,

but included patients with severe symptoms requiring hospital admission, who had other risk
factors for disease progression (e.g. were age 60 or older, had diabetes, or were
immunocompromised), or who worked or lived in a setting where infection control requirements
dictated a need for testing. Additional serum/plasma samples collected September 2015 to
December 2019, prior to the SARS-COV-2 outbreak, were used as controls. This included
healthy adults seen at the MGH Immunization and Travel Clinic prior to travel, patients
undergoing routine serology, and patients presenting with other known febrile illnesses. Plasma
samples, except for the routine serology samples, were heat-inactivated at 56°C for one hour
prior to analysis. DBS sample preparation is provided in the Supplementary Material. Patient
demographic information, lab results, and clinical outcomes were extracted from the electronic
medical record. All research was approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human
Subjects Research at MGH.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA assays measured IgG, IgA, and
IgM responses to the receptor binding domain of the spike protein (RBD) from SARS-CoV-2
[GenBank: MN975262], Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus [GenBank:
AFY13307.1], SARS-CoV-1 [GenBank: AAP13441.1], and common cold coronaviruses HKU1
[GenBank: AAT98580.1], OC229E [GenBank: AAK32191] , OC43 [GenBank:AAT84362], and
NL63 [GenBank: AKT07952]. Anti- RBD-specific antibody concentrations (ug/mL) were
quantified using isotype-specific anti-RBD monoclonal antibodies5. A full protocol is provided
in the Supplementary Material and is available on protocols.io
(https://www.protocols.io/view/sars-cov-2-rbd-elisa-bikbkcsn).

Pseudovirus neutralization assay. To determine the SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity of our
plasma samples, we used a lentivirus pseudoneutralization model as previously described6,
which is a strong correlate of protective immunity in challenged rhesus macaques7. We
expressed results from this assay as the antibody titer required to neutralize 50% of the SARSCoV-2 pseudovirus (NT50).

Single isotype thresholds. We first explored how cutoffs of individual isotypes (IgM, IgG and
IgA) performed in identifying previously infected individuals. We compared measurements from
pre-pandemic controls, with those taken at any time, ≤7 days, 8-14 days,>15-28 days, and >28
days after the onset of symptoms. Using a previously described cross-validation procedure8, we
allocated both cases and controls among 10-folds to calculate a pooled cross-validated AUC
(cvAUC). Using the isotype cut-offs defined by the maximum concentration (ug/mL) found
among pre-pandemic controls (IgG: 0.57, IgM: 2.63, IgA: 2.02), we estimated sensitivity and
bootstrap 95% confidence intervals.

Random forest classification models. We explored how combining multiple isotype-specific
responses with a random forest classification models performed identifying previously infected
individuals. We repeated the same procedures for cross-validation and assessed variable
importance within these different models using a permutation test–based metric, mean decrease
in accuracy.

Analysis of time to seroconversion and seroreversion. Using the cut-offs defined earlier, we
modeled the time required to become seropositive (seroconversion) and return to becoming
seronegative (seroreversion). Using individual level interval-censored data, we fit nonparametric (i.e Turnbull’s Estimator) and parametric accelerated failure time models using the
icenReg R package9. All time-to-event data were assumed to be Weibull distributed with
bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals estimated.

All analyses were completed using R (Version 3.6.1) within Rstudio (Version 1.2.5019).

RESULTS

Study cohorts. We measured RBD responses in two cohorts: 1) symptomatic patients who tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR (n = 259) and 2) healthy (n = 1,515) and febrile controls (n =
33) collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The majority of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases
were severe (95% hospitalized, 31% requiring ICU level care, 16% died), male (62%), and older
(median age: 58) (Table 1, Figure S1). Most pre-pandemic controls were younger (median age:

37) and female (62%). Serum was collected at multiple time points for most patients (56%;
n=146), with 23% (n=59) having ≥4 samples. Forty-nine percent of this cohort had a sample
collected between 0-7 days after onset of symptoms (n=126), 59% had a sample between 8-14
days (n=154), 42% had a sample between 15-28 days (n=110), 22% had a sample between 29-45
days (n=56), 8% had a sample between 46-60 days (n=20) and 3% had a sample > 60 days (n=7).
The last sample was collected 75 days post-symptom onset.

Kinetics of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody responses. Most cases eventually had evidence
of elevated antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 compared to pre-pandemic controls (Figure 1). From
days 5 to 14, there was a sharp rise in RBD-specific antibodies of all isotypes, and IgG titers
continued to rise until day 25 after the onset of symptoms (Figure S2A). The population average
IgA and IgM responses peaked a few days earlier than IgG and then declined towards levels
measured in pre-pandemic samples (Figure S2 and S3). IgG antibody responses also began to
wane, but at a slower rate. Among 58 cases with ≥4 measurements, the individual peak
measurement IgM often occurred before that of IgG (Before: 48%, Same: 48%) and
simultaneously with that of IgA (Before: 22%, Same: 62%). Among hospitalized patients, the
population average trajectory differed little between severity levels; the average IgM levels
among hospitalized cases admitted to the ICU dropped more quickly than that of patients not
requiring the ICU or who died (Figure S2B).

Accuracy of RBD antibodies for identifying recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Each antibody
isotype was predictive of infection, and the cross-validated AUC (cvAUC) of antibody testing
for each antibody isotype increased to above 97% during the period of 15-28 days after symptom
onset (Table 2). The cvAUC remained high for IgG after 28 days but began to fall for IgM and
IgA. Using the pre-defined cutoffs, the sensitivity of IgG antibodies rose from 7% (<=7days) to
97% after 14 days of symptoms. The sensitivity of IgA and IgM rose to 91% and 81% 2-4 weeks
post-symptom onset but dropped after 4 weeks to 57% and 40%, respectively.

Combining multiple isotype measurements to improve predictive accuracy. The
discriminatory power of IgG alone was high after 14 days; however, we found the accuracy of
ELISA-based identification of recent infections could be improved by adding IgM and/or IgA at

the earlier phases of infection (Table S1; Figure S4). The random forest model cvAUC was 0.91
for IgG and IgM and 0.91 for IgG and IgA at 8-14 days post-symptom onset. These models
provide an estimate of the contribution of each antibody isotype, as well as the maximum
predictive value of combined measures of anti-RBD IgG, IgA and IgM responses. While IgM
levels contributed the most to prediction of recent infection in the early phase of illness, IgG
responses were the most predictive of infection 8 or more days after the onset of symptoms.
Using the pre-determined thresholds for seropositivity for each antibody isotype, out of the 223
patients with samples collected during early infection (< 14 days post symptom onset), we were
able to identify an additional 14 cases by adding IgM, 15 by adding IgA, and 23 by adding both
IgM and IgA.

Estimation of time to seroconversion and seroreversion for each isotype. Of 94 cases with
samples after 20 days post-symptoms, most had evidence of seroconversion for all isotypes (IgG:
99%, IgM: 90%, IgA: 96%). The estimated median time to seroconversion from symptom onset
was comparable across antibody isotype: 10.9 days (95% CI:10.0-11.9) for IgG, 11.8 days (10.713.1) for IgA and 12.1 (10.8-13.7 days) for IgM (Figure 2). On average, most hospitalized
individuals seroconverted at least two days sooner to all isotypes compared to non-hospitalized
patients, while age and sex appeared to have little effect (Table S2). Of seroconverted cases with
samples 40 days post-symptoms or after, most eventually had IgM (21/27) and IgA (18/27)
seronegative measurements. Only 1 of 29 (an immunosuppressed individual) cases seroreverted
for IgG. We estimated the median time to seroreversion for IgM was 46.9 days (95% CI: 41.1 –
54.8), with the first 5% seroreverting by 24 days. Similarly, we estimate a median seroreversion
time for anti-RBD IgA to be 51.0 days (95% CI: 45.7 – 57.1), with the first 5% seroreverting by
29.8 days (Figure 2).

Association between RBD responses and the development of neutralizing antibodies
targeting the S protein. We measured pseudoneutralizing antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV2
S protein in 88 samples from 15 individuals collected between 0 and 75 days post-symptoms
(Figure 3). Over the course of infection, all patients tested developed detectable neutralizing
antibodies (NAb). NAb titers were correlated with the concentration of anti-RBD IgG (r = 0.87).

Of note, similar to anti-RBD IgG responses, NAb titers plateaued and remained detectable at
later time points despite the more rapid decline of IgA and IgM responses.

Evaluation of cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses. We evaluated antibody responses to
RBDs derived from spike proteins of endemic human coronaviruses (CoVs) (i.e. HKU1, CoV
OC 229E, OC43, and NL63), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) and
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Figure S6). We did not observe a
cross-reactive response to the endemic human coronaviruses in individuals infected with SARSCoV-2, and antibody responses to these CoVs were comparable between pre-pandemic controls
and individuals with COVID-19 at all phases of infection. We observed significant crossreactivity to SARS-CoV-1 RBD in individuals with COVID-19, but no cross-reactive responses
to the MERS-CoV RBD.

Comparison of plasma responses to dried blood spots (DBS). Since this assay could be used
in large serosurveys, we also evaluated the assay with dried blood spot eluates in a subset of
patients (n= 20 at two timepoints; 40 samples) and pre-pandemic controls (n=20). The anti-RBD
IgG DBS measurements had a high degree of linear correlation in both cases and control plasma
(r = 0.99, Figure S7). While the classification of all samples was the same between DBS and
plasma samples (100% classification concordance), values between the two media diverged more
at low titer values.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we found that the presence of antibodies against the RBD region of the S
protein was highly predictive of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specifically, the presence of IgG
antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 RBD was a highly specific (100%) and sensitive (97%)
marker of infection after 14 days from onset of illness. IgG seropositivity was sustained in
patients up to 75 days (last time point measured), and the concentration of these antibodies was
highly correlated with pseudovirus NAb titers. In contrast, IgM and IgA responses to RBD were
short-lived and with many individuals seroreverting within two months of the onset of illness.
Longer term follow-up is needed to determine the duration of IgG responses.

RT-PCR based detection of SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive early in the first week after the
onset of symptoms10, and our results suggest that the detection of antibodies against the SARSCoV-2 RBD by ELISA is not likely to contribute significantly to the early diagnosis of COVID19. Even models incorporating all isotypes had limited predictive capacity during the first week
of illness. However, our results do demonstrate that the detection of IgM and IgA responses
improved the sensitivity of serologic testing within two weeks of the onset of symptoms. Beyond
two weeks after symptom onset, supplementing viral detection assays with antibody-based
testing methods clearly increases sensitivity in diagnosing recent infection11,12, particularly as the
sensitivity of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 infection wanes13. Our results, also, show that the early
seroreversion of IgA and IgM responses could be useful in the future in distinguishing previous
infection from acute COVID-19. Taken together, these findings suggest specific and clearly
defined applications for serologic testing of RBD responses in the clinical setting.

Testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies can also be applied in seroepidemiologic
studies, even in areas of low prevalence, given their excellent specificity and defined kinetics.
Variation in the performance of commercial serologic tests and confusion about the role of
antibodies as biomarkers of past infection versus protective immunity has led to widespread
misperception that antibody testing may not be accurate or useful14,15. In contrast, our study,
based on a large sample of cases and controls should provide significant confidence in the
potential contribution of serologic measures in public health efforts to identify transmission hotspots and at-risk populations. In addition, the lack of cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with
common cold coronaviruses should provide additional confidence in the specificity of the assay.
Longer term characterization of IgG responses, however, is still needed to assist in design and
interpretation of serosurveys.

One notable limitation of our study was that our cohort of individuals with SARS-CoV-2
infection was skewed toward adults with clinically significant disease or with risk factors for
disease progression. Individuals with mild or asymptomatic infection have been shown to
develop less robust antibody responses13, which may lead to false negatives if our proposed
assay thresholds are used. Individuals with mild or asymptomatic infection may also serorevert

quicker than symptomatic individuals13. The gradation of responses by disease severity has been
found in other infections, including SARS-CoV-213 and MERS-CoV infection16. An association
between disease severity and the kinetics of the antibody response is also suggested by our
finding that individuals with more severe disease, who required ICU-level care, seroconverted
earlier than individuals who did not require ICU-level support.

It is important to note that our assay identifies individuals with recent SARS-CoV-2
infection but does not provide information about whether individuals are protected from
subsequent infection. Optimal immunologic correlates of protection for SARS-CoV-2 remain
unknown in humans. In many human challenge studies of common cold coronavirus infection,
the presence of pre-existing neutralizing antibodies has been associated with protection against
the development of symptomatic infection and with decreased viral shedding17. In addition, in
vaccinated rhesus macaques challenged with SARS-CoV-2 infection, neutralizing antibodies
directed at the S protein were also a strong correlate of protective immunity6. Thus,
neutralization titers, in the absence of other known markers, has become a de facto immunologic
marker of protection pending further investigation; however, whether there is a threshold titer
that is robustly associated with protection remains unclear. Nonetheless, it is notable that antiRBD IgG antibodies were strongly correlated with the neutralizing antibodies associated with
protection in vaccinated macaques6. This correlation with neutralizing titers was stronger than
observed for other previously tested commercial serologic assays18.

Our results, therefore, provide strong support for the application of anti-RBD antibodies
as a marker of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. This approach meets the CDC’s interim guidelines
for serologic testing19 and has the potential to facilitate accurate diagnosis in clinical settings and
the implementation of population-based studies of previous infection globally. While the
association between RBD-IgG with neutralizing titers and the persistence of these antibodies at
late time points is encouraging, further work is needed to define the optimal antibody mediated
correlates of protective immunity.

maximum concentration (µg/mL) found among pre-pandemic controls (IgG: 0.57, IgM: 2.63,
IgA: 2.02). The solid line represents the estimated cumulative distribution function of the time to
seroconversion or reversion with 100 bootstrapped fits shown as transparent lines. The
parametric accelerated failure time models assume a Weibull time-to-event distribution. Nonparametric estimates shown in grey were calculated using the Turnbull method. Only 1
individual seroreverted for IgG, so no model is included. B) The table indicates the estimated
average number of days since onset of symptoms it takes for a percentage of cases to seroconvert
or serorevert. Bootstrap 95% confidence intervals are shown in parentheses.

Method S1. Additional details on laboratory assays
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The RBDs were expressed in Expi293F
suspension cells with a C-terminal SBP-His8X tag, and purified using affinity chromatography
and then size exclusion chromatography prior to removal of the His tag as described
previously1. Briefly, 384 well Nunc MaxiSorp plates (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were coated by
adding 50 µL of RBD in carbonate buffer (1 µg/mL) and incubating for 1 hour at room
temperature (RT). Plates were then blocked for 30 minutes at RT with 5% non-fat milk in trisbuffered saline (TBS). Diluted samples (1:100 in TBS with 5% milk, 0.5% Tween) were added to
the plate (25 µL/well) and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C with shaking. Serial 4-fold dilutions to
1:6400 were also included for individuals with high titers. Goat anti-human IgA, IgG, and IgMhorseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibodies diluted (Jackson ImmunoResearch,
West Grove, PA) at 1:10000 (IgG, IgM) or 1:5000 (IgA) in 5% milk in TBST were then added to
plates (25 µL/well) and incubated at RT with shaking for 30 minutes. Bound secondaries were
detected using 1-step Ultra TMB (tetramethylbenzidine; ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA, 25
µL/well). Plates were incubated at RT for 5 minutes in the dark before addition of 2 N sulfuric
acid stop solution (25 µL/well). The optical density (OD) was read at 450 nm and 570 nm on a
plate reader. OD values were adjusted by subtracting the 570 nm OD from the 450 nm OD. We
used a standard curve of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal, CR3022 2 ,to calculate the
concentration of anti-RBD IgG, IgA, and IgM expressed in µg/mL.
Dried blood spots (DBS). Single donor, sero-negative whole blood, collected in sodium heparin
tubes (Becton, Dickinson, NJ), was spiked with heat-inactivated plasma from SARS-CoV-2
patients. Forty microliter (40 µL) droplets were spotted in replicate onto Whatman 903 Protein
Saver cards (GE Healthcare, Cardiff, UK). Cards were left to dry overnight at ambient room
temperature. The following day, two 6-mm2 punches were removed from the DBS card using a
manual hole-punch and eluted overnight at 4°C with gentle agitation in 133 µL PBS-0.05%
Tween 20 pH 7.4 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).

Table S1. Predictive accuracy of multiple isotypes for classifying
controls and cases over time since symptom onset.
Random forest models were used to calculate cvAUC. The isotype cut-offs chosen for calculating
sensitivity were the maximum concentration (µg/mL) found among pre-pandemic controls (IgG: 0.57,
IgM: 2.63, IgA: 2.02). Samples with measurements above at least one cut-off were classified as cases.
