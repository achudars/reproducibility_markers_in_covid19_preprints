Abstract

50

Background: At our tertiary care public hospital, we saw COVID-19 presenting with

51

thromboembolic phenomena, indicating a possible early thrombo-inflammatory pathology.

52

Objectives: We documented patients with cardiac and neurological thromboembolic

53

phenomena as a primary presentation of COVID-19, and compared a subset of COVID

54

associated strokes against COVID-19 patients without thrombotic manifestations.

55

Methods: We included all COVID-Stroke and COVID-ACS (COVID-19, with ischemic

56

arterial stroke/Acute Coronary Syndrome presenting prior to/simultaneous with/within 72

57

hours of systemic/respiratory COVID manifestations) admitted from April to

58

November 2020. In the nested case control analysis, we used unpaired T-test and chi-square

59

test to study differences between COVID-Strokes (case group) and non-thrombotic COVID

60

controls.

61

Results and Conclusions: We noted 68 strokes and 122 ACS associated with COVID-

62

19. ACS peaked in May-June, while stroke admissions peaked later in September-October,

63

possibly because severe strokes may have expired at home during the lockdown.

64

In the case-control analysis, cases (n=43; 12F:31M; mean age 51.5 years) had significantly

65

higher D-Dimer values than controls (n=50; 9F:41M; mean age 51.6 years). Mortality was

66

significantly higher in cases (51.2% vs. 26.0%; p = 0.018). We noted 7.5 times higher

67

mortality in cases versus controls even among patients needing minimal oxygen

68

support. Imaging in 37 patients showed both anterior and posterior circulation territories

69

affected in seven, with almost half of Carotid territory strokes being large hemispherical

70

strokes. Additionally, CT/MRI angiography in 28 strokes showed large vessel occlusions in

71

19 patients. Death in cases thus probably occurred before progression to intense respiratory

72

support, due to severe central nervous system insult.

Binary logistic regression analysis showed respiratory support intensity to be the sole

74

independent predictor of mortality among cases. Respiratory distress could have been due to

75

COVID-19 lung infection or aspiration pneumonia resulting from obtunded sensorium. In

76

controls, mortality was predicted by increasing age, female sex, and respiratory

77

support intensity.

COVID-19 with early neurological and cardiac thromboembolic phenomena—timeline

96

of incidence and clinical features

97

Introduction

98

COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a member of the Coronaviridae family.

99

There are numerous reports of patients with COVID-19 presenting with both arterial (stroke,

100

myocardial infarction) and venous thrombosis (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary

101

thromboembolism, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis).(1–10) Accelerated thrombogenesis in

102

COVID-19 is postulated to be due to Virchow’s triad, resulting in endothelial dysfunction,

103

abnormal flow and a hypercoagulable state.(11–13) At our tertiary care public hospital, we

104

saw COVID-19 presenting with thromboembolic phenomena, where the respiratory

105

involvement was either very mild and simultaneous, or occurred only later during

106

hospitalization, indicating a possible early thrombo-inflammatory pathology, in a subsection

107

of patients. Hence, we documented patients with cardiac and neurological thromboembolic

108

phenomena as a primary presentation of COVID-19. Further, we compared clinical and

109

inflammatory markers in a subset of these patients with markers in patients without

110

thrombotic manifestations of the disease during hospitalization.

111

Aims

112

We aimed to document the incidence of acute thromboembolism, namely, ischemic stroke

113

and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) as a presentation of COVID-19. We also aimed to

114

compare clinical and inflammatory markers in a subgroup of patients of COVID-19 with

115

acute ischemic stroke at presentation or within the first 72 hours of other signs and symptoms

116

of COVID-19, with the parameters in patients presenting with respiratory onset disease. This

117

latter group had neither cardiac nor neurological ischemic pathology during their

118

hospitalization.

Methodology

120

Our study center is a 1400 bedded, tertiary care, municipal public hospital in Mumbai, India.

121

We did a retrospective observational serial recruitment of all cases satisfying the inclusion

122

criteria, followed by a nested case control analysis of a subset of the larger cohort of COVID-

123

19 patients.

124

Operational definitions:

125

Ischemic stroke: Patients who presented to the hospital with ischemic arterial stroke, without

126

systemic or respiratory signs and symptoms of COVID-19 at admission, or stroke developing

127

within 72 hours of systemic or respiratory signs and symptoms of COVID-19, were included

128

from a study period of April to November 2020. Any of the symptoms comprising fever,

129

myalgia, throat pain, dry cough, tachypnoea, loose motions, and an oxygen saturation under

130

95% on room air at admission were considered as indicative of presence of systemic and

131

respiratory signs of COVID-19.

132

Acute coronary syndrome: Patients who presented to the hospital with ACS {ST segment

133

elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction

134

(NSTEMI), or Unstable angina, diagnosed as per standard criteria} without systemic or

135

respiratory signs and symptoms of COVID-19 at admission, or ACS developing within 72

136

hours of systemic or respiratory signs and symptoms of COVID-19, were included in a

137

similar manner.

138

Patients with pulmonary or other systemic and peripheral thromboembolism and patients with

139

cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) were not included in the detailed analysis in this

140

study, unless associated with stroke or ACS, as a separate registry is being maintained for

141

them.

142

Inclusion in case group and control group:

143

We compared clinical and inflammatory markers inpatients of COVID-19 with

144

thromboembolic phenomena (acute ischemic stroke) at presentation or within the first 72

145

hours of other signs and symptoms of COVID-19, with the parameters in patients presenting

146

with respiratory onset disease. The latter group continued to be free of cardiac and

147

neurological ischemic pathology till discharge. We selected the group with acute ischemic

148

stroke as the case group, as complete data was available for the patients with COVID-19

149

associated stroke. Thus, we analyzed detailed data for 43 COVID-19 cases with associated

150

stroke, and 50 controls with COVID-19 and no associated thromboembolic events.

151

Controls were included in a number similar to the cases. The selection of controls from any

152

given month of the study duration (April to November 2020), corresponded to the proportion

153

of COVID strokes to total COVID-19 cases, for that month. As strokes were highest in

154

proportion to total COVID-19 cases in September and October 2020, the maximum number

155

of controls were taken from that period. Selection of individual cases was by using random

156

computer-generated numbers.

157

We evaluated and compared demographic features (age, gender), clinical features

158

(comorbidities, oxygen saturation at admission and modality of maximum oxygen support

159

required during hospitalization), laboratory parameters {inflammatory markers such as C

160

Reactive Protein (CRP) and D-Dimer, creatinine level, platelet count}, mortality and

161

predictors of mortality in the case group versus the control group. Modalities of respiratory

162

support included, in order of increasing intensity, nasal cannula, venturi mask, non-

163

rebreathing bag and mask (NRBM), high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), non-invasive

164

ventilation (NIV), and intubation and mechanical ventilation. In the correlation of in-hospital

165

mortality with requirement for respiratory support, we divided the patients into two groups.

166

The low flow oxygen support subgroup included patients on room air, nasal cannula and

167

venturi mask, and the high flow oxygen support subgroup included patients on NRBM,

168

HFNC, NIV and intubation with mechanical ventilation.

169

We used Microsoft Excel (2010) to tabulate and clean the raw data, and to generate pivot

170

tables and graphs. We imported the excel datasheet into IBM SPSS version 20.0 and

171

performed univariate and multivariate analyses. We divided the study set into subgroups

172

according to relevant characteristics, and used the unpaired samples T-test and chi-square test

173

to study differences in key variables. We assumed unequal variances in reporting T tests. We

174

calculated 95% confidence intervals for mean differences and odds ratios, and considered a p

175

value below 0.05 to be statistically significant only if the confidence intervals for the

176

concerned statistic were congruent. We performed binary logistic regression to determine the

177

key predictors of in-hospital mortality. We entered the following variables as independent

178

predictorsfor both case and control groups: age, sex, number of comorbidities and respiratory

179

distress level (the last coded on an ascending scale reflecting the intensity of mode of

180

supplementary oxygen delivery, where 0 represented no support required, and 6 represented

181

invasive ventilation). CRP and D-Dimer were not added as predictors to this model, as

182

laboratory reports for both markers were available for only 20 cases. In the initial days of the

183

pandemic, logistic pressures on the hospital made it difficult to procure reports for all

184

patients.

185

Ethical considerations: We obtained scientific and ethical approval for the study from the

186

Human Research Institutional Ethics Committee, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical

187

College and General Hospital, Sion, Mumbai.

188

Data availability statement: The data used in our analysis will be made available to

189

researchers upon reasonable request to the corresponding author.

Figure 1 shows that during the period of April-November 2020, there were 4,069 COVID-19

192

cases admitted in our hospital. There were 68 cases of stroke associated with COVID-19 and

193

122 cases of ACS associated with COVID-19. The peak of total COVID-19 cases and cardiac

194

cases was in May and June 2020.The peak of stroke cases was in September and October

195

2020. Among the 68 patients with stroke, 49 had ischemic stroke. Of these 49 patients, 43

196

satisfied inclusion criteria for early presentation as ischemic stroke as per our operational

197

definitions. The case records of these 43 patients (case group) were analyzed in detail. Close

198

to half of the 43 patients in the case group (21; 48.9%) belonged to the 41-60 years age

199

group. Among them, 11 were aged 51-60 years, and 10 were 41-50 years of age. Whereas out

200

of 50 controls, 13 patients (26.0%) were aged 61-70 years, followed by 11 each (22.0%) in

201

the 31-40 years and 51-60 years age groups, respectively.

202

The sex distribution of cases and controls was as follows: 12 (27.9%) women and 31 (72.1%)

203

men in the case group, versus 9 (18.0%) women and 41 (82.0%) men in the control group.

204

There was no significant difference in the age or sex distribution of case and control groups.

205

Among the cases, 14 of 43 patients (32.6%) were free of comorbidities, compared to 22 of 50

206

controls (44.0%). Among the cases there were 9 patients with hypertension (HTN), 4 with

207

diabetes mellitus (DM), and 12 who had both comorbidities. Among the controls, 6 patients

208

had HTN, 11 had DM, and 9 had both. These differences were not statistically significant.

209

Among the 43 stroke cases, we noted 40 patients with pure arterial infarcts, one with arterial

210

infarct associated with CVST, and two patients with bithalamic infarcts, possibly due to

211

blockage of artery of Percheron or vein of Galen. As CT angiography and venography were

212

not available for these two patients, they were classified as of indeterminate (arterial/venous)

213

etiology. CT scans pinpointed the vascular territory affected in 37 of 41 patients (40 pure

214

arterial infarcts and one infarct+CVST) with arterial infarcts. Of these,26 (70.3% of 37) had

10
215

infarcts in the carotid territory, four (10.8% of 37) in the vertebrobasilar territory, and seven

216

patients (18.9% of 37) had infarcts in both territories. Additionally, four patients were

217

clinically diagnosed as carotid territory infarct, although their initial CT scans revealed no

218

acute changes (repeat CTs were not done either due to logistic constraints or clinical

219

deterioration). Among the 33 carotid ischemic strokes with CT scans available (comprising

220

carotid territory strokes and carotid component of mixed territory strokes), 15 were classified

221

as large hemispherical, 10 were subcortical and 8 were pure cortical infarcts.

222

Among the 43 stroke patients, 28 (65.1%) had a CT angiography or MRI angiography done.

223

Large vessel occlusion (LVO) was present in 19/28 (67.8%) patients.

224

As seen in Table 1, cases had significantly lower average levels of respiratory support

225

requirement and significantly higher D-Dimer values than controls.

226

Comparing maximum respiratory support requirement in cases versus controls, we noted that

227

32/50 (64.0%) of the controls required intensive modes of respiratory support (NRBM,

228

HFNC, NIV, Intubation) as compared to 10/43 (23.26%) of the cases. This difference was

229

statistically significant (Χ2 = 2.022, df 6, p = 0.001).

230

Mortality was 51.2% in the case group compared with26.0% in the control group, being

231

significantly higher in cases compared to controls (Χ2 =6.237, df 1, p = 0.018; OR 2.98,

232

95CIOR 1.25–7.11).

233

Table 2 shows that patients requiring higher modalities of oxygen support (NRBM, HFNC,

234

NIV, invasive ventilation) had higher mortality in both cases and controls. We observed that

235

in both low flow oxygen and high flow oxygen subgroups, cases had significantly higher

236

mortality than controls. However, the difference in mortality between cases and controls was

237

striking in the low flow subgroup. In the latter, despite maintaining satisfactory oxygen

238

saturation on room air or with minimal oxygen support, the mortality was 7.5 times higher in

COVID stroke patients as compared to controls (Low flow: 42.4% vs 5.6%, Χ2= 7.626, df 1,

240

p = 0.006; OR 12.53, 95CIOR 1.49–105.58; High flow: 80.0% vs 37.5%, Χ2= 5.517, df 1, p =

241

0.030; OR 6.67, 95CIOR 1.21–36.74).

242

Accurate dates of admission and discharge/death were available for 26 of 43 cases, and all 50

243

controls. Mean duration of hospitalization for cases was 13.25 days for those who survived

244

and 9.36 days for those who died. For controls it was 12.57 days for those who survived and

245

11.54 days for those who died.

246

Table 3 shows the results of binary logistic regression analysis to determine predictors of

247

mortality in the case group and control group. The level of respiratory support requirement

248

was the sole independent predictor of mortality among the cases. In controls, mortality was

249

predicted by increasing age and female sex in addition to respiratory support requirement.

250

Discussion

251

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was recognized early on that the presence of thrombosis

252

in multiple organ systems points to thromboembolism being an integral component in the

253

pathogenesis of this novel disease.(10,11,14,15)

254

During the months of May and June 2020, we noted many patients presenting with

255

thromboembolic phenomena as an early manifestation of COVID-19, or developing these

256

complications during admission. Hence, the first part of our study comprised documentation

257

of acute cerebral and cardiac thromboembolic events during admission for COVID-19

258

infection. Acute neurovascular and cardiac events associated with COVID-19 at our centre

259

included 68 cases of stroke and 122 cases of ACS during the period of April-November 2020.

260

Of these 68 strokes, 49 had ischemic strokes. Of these 49 COVID-19 associated ischemic

261

strokes, 22 (51.2%) presented with only stroke and no respiratory signs and symptoms of

262

COVID-19 (data in press). This possible early thromboembolic effect of COVID-19 on the

12
263

neurovascular system, prompted us to investigate and study patients with ischemic stroke as a

264

primary presentation of COVID-19, in the second part of our study. The occurrence of

265

thromboembolic phenomenon early in the course of COVID-19 disease has also been

266

observed in other studies by Pillai et al,(14) Stefanini et al(16) and Mao et al.(17)

267

43 patients satisfied our inclusion criteria for this study viz., ischemic stroke within 72 hours

268

of onset of first symptoms of COVID-19. As complete data was available for the patients

269

with stroke, we compared characteristics of stroke patients with corresponding findings in

270

patients without thromboembolic manifestations of the disease. A detailed similar analysis of

271

the patients with ACS was not possible, due to lack of complete data.

272

Figure 1 shows the timeline of admission of all COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 cases with ACS

273

and COVID-19 cases with stroke, under medicine and cardiology departments, at our centre.

274

Whereas the peak of cardiac cases was in May and June 2020, the peak of stroke cases was in

275

September and October 2020, at which time stroke and ACS incidence were approximately

276

the same. As both ACS and stroke are thrombo-inflammatory manifestations of the virus, it is

277

surprising that these two events have shown different peaks (Figure 1). ACS incidence

278

showed a gradual decline after June whereas stroke incidence gradually rose to peak in

279

September-October. In September and October 2020, the number of COVID-19 admissions

280

(only patients with higher category oxygen requirement, beyond nasal cannula at 4

281

litres/minute, or those with systemic complications, are admitted at our centre) had fallen

282

steeply, with ACS cases also showing a gradual decline. It is possible that patients with

283

severe strokes may have expired at home due to difficulties of travel in a severely disabled

284

state during the lockdown in peak months. Hence, the rise in stroke admissions later may

285

have been due to better facilities of transportation, as the lockdown eased in the city in the

286

later months.

Among the 43 stroke cases, CT confirmation of infarct and arterial territory could be made in

288

37 patients. Four patients were diagnosed clinically as carotid territory stroke, and the lack of

289

hemorrhage on the CT classified them as possible early infarcts. Due to the difficulties

290

inherent in and peculiar to the COVID-19 situation in a large public hospital, a repeat

291

imaging study could not be done in these patients. However, it was clear that in those with

292

imaging confirmation, the infarcts were either large or multiple, or in eloquent areas; 18.9%

293

being in both anterior and posterior circulation territories, 10.8% in vertebrobasilar territory,

294

and even among the carotid territory strokes, almost half being large hemispherical strokes.

295

Additionally, 67.8% of those who had a CT angiography done, showed evidence of LVO,

296

portending the possibility of enlargement of infarct area.

297

CRP levels, while being over 10 times the upper limit of normal level in both groups, showed

298

no significant difference between the two groups (Table 1). This was not surprising as both

299

the groups fell into the moderate to severe infection categories, in terms of respiratory and

300

other systemic involvement. While both cases and controls had high levels of D-Dimer (more

301

than thrice the upper limit of normal value), the case group had a significantly higher D-

302

Dimer level as compared to the control group. A deranged coagulation function, including

303

elevated D-Dimer, has been demonstrated to lead to disease progression of COVID-

304

19.(18,19) Several studies have reported elevated levels of CRPs and D-Dimer in patients

305

with COVID-19.(3,4,17,20,21) Additionally, COVID-19 associated inflammation resulting in

306

a hypercoagulable state has been well documented.(21,22)

307

Our study showed that the control group required a higher level of respiratory support care

308

than the case group, the number of patients requiring NRBM, HFNC or intubation being 32

309

(64%) in control group, as compared to 10 (23.26%) in case group. This could be related to

310

two factors: the higher survival rate in the control group (mortality in case and control groups

311

being 51.2% and 26.0% respectively), and longer mean duration of survival in the control

312

group (the patients in the case group who died in hospital, survived for an average of 9.3 days

313

as compared to 11.5 days in the patients who expired in the control group).

314

In the overall ‘low flow oxygen support group,’ the 7 times higher death rate in the case

315

group as compared to the control group, was striking. Death in the case group probably

316

occurred before progression to higher levels of respiratory support, due to severe central

317

nervous system insult, without having severe respiratory involvement. The phenomenon of

318

increased risk of thrombus formation leading to stroke (postulated to be due to viral

319

involvement of the endothelium), in the absence of severe respiratory disease, has been

320

previously documented.(15) Contrarily, other authors have posited that the incidence of

321

stroke in COVID-19 may be related to severity of infection.(17,21)

322

In this study, although higher modes of respiratory support were less frequent in the case

323

group, respiratory distress level requiring higher modality of support predicted mortality

324

within the group. The respiratory distress could have been due to COVID-19 lung infection

325

or due to aspiration pneumonia resulting from obtunded sensorium in stroke.

326

The prediction of mortality by increasing age, as seen in the control group in our study, has

327

been well documented by various authors.(23,24) However, most studies have shown that

328

men have a higher risk of COVID-19 related death than women,(23,25) contrary to our

329

findings in the control group. Our sample size for the control group was small, and this

330

limitation could have led to this finding.

331

A major limitation of our study is the lack of documentation of clinical and subclinical

332

pulmonary thromboembolic phenomena in the case and control groups. This was highly

333

probable, given the thrombo-inflammatory milieu, and the concomitantly existing cerebral

334

thrombosis. It is possible that this was more common in the case group and could have

335

contributed to the mortality. We did not take pulmonary thromboembolism into account in

336

our analysis, as complete data on CT pulmonary angiography was not available in many

337

patients.

338

In conclusion, our comparison of a thromboembolic cerebral presentation of COVID-19 with

339

a clinically non-thromboembolic presentation of COVID-19, demonstrated higher D-Dimer

340

levels, and a higher mortality in the absence of prominent respiratory compromise, in the

341

former group. The higher mortality was possibly due to the severity of stroke and presence of

342

proximal LVOs. We could not compare mortality in COVID-19 associated strokes with a

343

cohort of non-COVID associated strokes in the same period, as our regular admissions were

344

severely limited during the pandemic. A meta-analysis of stroke in COVID-19 has

345

highlighted that the mean mortality rate among stroke patients with COVID-19 infection was

346

46.7% compared to only 8.7% among those without COVID-19 infection.(26)
