Abstract
In late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infection
started in Hubei province of China and now it has spread like a wildfire in almost all parts of
the world except some. WHO named the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19
(CoronaVirus Disease-2019). It is very intriguing to see a mild trend of infection in some
countries which could be attributed to mitigation efforts, lockdown strategies, health
infrastructure, demographics and cultural habits. However, the lower rate of infection and
death rates in mostly developing countries, which are not placed at higher levels in terms of
healthcare facilities, is a very surprising observation. To address this issue, we hypothesize
that this lower rate of infection is majorly been observed in countries which have a higher
transmission/prevalence of protozoan parasite borne disease, malaria. We compared the
COVID-19 spread and malaria endemicity of 108 countries which have shown at least 200
cases of COVID-19 till 18th April 2020. We found that the number of COVID-19 cases per
million population correlates negatively with the malaria endemicity of respective countries.
The malaria free countries not only have higher density of COVID-19 infections but also the
higher case fatality rates as compared to highly malaria endemic countries. We also postulate
that this phenomenon is due to natural immune response against malaria infection, which is
providing a heterologous protection against the virus. Unfortunately, there is no licensed
vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 yet, but this information will be helpful in design of future
strategies against fast spreading COVID-19 disease.

SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infection is affecting
almost all countries in the world. After being reported by WHO in early January 2020 about
human to human transmission of the virus, till now the spread is on increase day by day
(www.who.int). WHO named the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as COVID-19
(CoronaVirus Disease-2019) and declared it a global pandemic in February 2020. However,
there are striking differences in the behavior of COVID-19 spread in different countries of
different continents. For example, United States of America is been shown to have highest
number of cases and the spread is pretty fast with high mortality rates (www.cdc.gov). On the
other hand South Korea and Taiwan, despite having initial cases have been reported too early,
show a slower spread of infection and less mortality rate. Medical infrastructure and correct
timing of restrictions on public gatherings and movement can be listed as factors which has
led to such differences in the menace created by this virus [1].
We propose an alternate hypothesis regarding the spread of COVID-19, which is that
there is limited spread of the disease in malaria endemic countries as compared to malaria
free countries. Malaria is a vector borne disease caused by apicomplexan parasite i.e.
Plasmodium sp. Malaria is a deadly disease that causes about 228 million cases and more
than 405,000 deaths per year globally as per WHO report 2019. Malaria distribution across
the world can be divided as endemic regions and non-endemic regions as per the number of
cases reported per million of the population (WHO malaria report 2019). In endemic areas,
malaria is being reported to occur repeatedly throughout the year and hence the population in
these areas get infection at regular intervals [2]. Malaria cases have also been governed by
presence of vector, Anopheles mosquitoes in that region as they are the prime carriers of the
parasite. Some countries are free of malaria due to the climate conditions, lack of vector and
successful malaria eradication efforts which include North America and Europe along with
others [3]. Population in malaria endemic countries are been reported to achieve a natural
protection against future infection by generating combination of Th1 and Th2 response
against the pathogen. This anti-malaria immunity can stay for longer durations, upto 3 years
in some cases [4]. Lower number of COVID-19 cases are being reported from Malaria
endemic countries (WHO COVID-19 status report). In the light of the fact that immunity
against one pathogen can be effective in controlling infection by another pathogen, as also
suggested by various studies including BCG vaccination [5], [6]; we hypothesize that antimalaria immunity may play a role in slowing down the spread of COVID -19 viral infection.

In order to understand the correlation between less numbers of covid-19 cases in malaria
endemic regions, we carried out this study by analyzing current epidemiological data of the
two diseases and tried to identify the possible mechanisms behind such observation. The
study will be helpful in understanding the natural resistance against the COVID-19 infection
and can provide useful information regarding better management of this pandemic.
Material and Methods

We collected the data about Malaria infection across the globe from WHO report 2019. The
data

for

COVID-19

infection

is

been

obtained

from

worldometer

th

(https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 18 April 2020. Data was plotted and
analyzed using Graphpad prism and R package based statistical analyses.

Results

Distribution of malaria and COVID-19 shows drastic contrast
We plotted the COVID-19 trend and malaria burden on world maps and a straight look at
them highlights the stark contrast between trends for the two diseases. The less spread of
COVID-19 is seen in third world countries including Africa, Asia and Latin America (Figure
1) which are clearly seen having greater burden of malaria. Whereas, in European countries
and USA, the COVID-19 spread is very high while these countries/regions are almost malaria
free. It points towards possible correlation between less infectivity of COVID-19 and high
rates of malaria.

COVID-19 burden is negatively correlated with malaria burden
In order to get a quantitative understanding of correlation between the burdens of COVID-19
and malaria, we compared the COVID-19 cases/million populations till 18th April 2020 with
malaria cases/million (in 2018) of 108 countries reporting at least 200 COVID-19 cases and
having a population of at least 0.5 million. We have excluded countries which have not
reported at least 200 of COVID-19 cases as those countries majorly have imported cases of
COVID-19 rather than community spread, and/or also due to underreporting by the local
administration.

Also, for studying correlation between malaria burden and COVID-19

burden, it is necessary to not consider countries with only imported cases or very few local
infections. By statistical analyses of data from these 108 countries we found that there is an
inverse correlation between incidences of malaria in 2018 and COVID-19 infections (r= -

0.15, p= 0.02). Further we grouped these 108 countries into four categories based on extent of
malaria burden; countries with, (i) no malaria, (ii) 1 to 1000, (iii) 1000 to 100 thousand and
(iv) >100 thousand malaria cases/million in 2018, each category having 76, 14, 10 and 8
countries respectively and calculated the combined COVID-19 burden of each category. The
total population of countries in each of these categories are 3400, 768, 2255 and 426 million
respectively (Figure 2A). As shown in figure 2B, the countries having no malaria burden at
all have an average COVID-19 burden of 576.6 cases/million whereas countries with malaria
burden 1 to 1000, 1000 to 100 thousand and >100 thousand cases/million have average
COVID-19 burden at 67.4, 31 and 10.2 cases/million respectively. Further, the shares of each
category in total number of COVID-19 cases are 94%, 2.5%, 3.3% and 0.2% for groups,
respectively. These data clearly shows a negative correlation between malaria endemicity and
COVID-19 burden, suggesting the possibility of role of anti-malaria immunity in curtailing
the SARS-CoV-2 spread.

Malaria free countries have high prevalence of COVID-19 Infections
Next, in order to have more detailed understanding of the correlation between malaria
endemicity and COVID-19 cases, we did a country-wise analysis of COVID-19 and malaria
burdens in 108 countries selected above. Out of 108 countries, total 76 countries are malaria
free countries whereas remaining 32 countries are mild to highly endemic for malaria. We
analyzed number of COVID-19 cases in 76 malaria free countries (as per WHO Malaria
report 2018) and observed that most of the European countries have reported more than or
equal to 1000 cases/million population (Figure 3). Luxembourg has the highest density of
COVID-19 cases at >5000 cases/million and is followed by Spain, Switzerland and Belgium
each showing >3000 cases/million. Italy, Ireland and France each reported >2000 COVID-19
cases/million. United States of America has maximum number of COVID-19 cases in the
world but owing to its large population, its COVID-19 burden is 1958 cases/million (Figure
3A). A total 37 of these countries have shown COVID-19 burden between 100 to 1000
cases/million with majority of countries from malaria free Middle East Asia falling in this
category. Remaining 19 malaria free countries have shown <100 cases/million and include
countries like Lebanon, Kyrgyzstan, Ukraine, Tunisia, Japan, Iraq, China and Sri Lanka etc.
Countries form middle east (i.e. Lebnanon, Egypt , Jordan and Iraq) and African regions (i.e.
Tunisia) have lesser number of infections despite being malaria free regions. These less
number of COVID-19 cases in these regions can be attributed to lot of factors, including
crippled medical infrastructure due to war and less number of tests being conducted and lack

of proper reporting by their administrations. However, these countries still have reported
roughly 40-60 COVID-19 cases/million of the population. China is surprisingly seen among
this group having lower COVID-19 burden at 57.43 cases/million, which could be because of
many reasons. Firstly, the SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans originated in Wuhan city of
China’s Hubei province, so it was very easy for Chinese administration to contain the disease
in local area and directing the mitigation efforts to one particular area rather than at scattered
hotspots as in case of other countries. In addition to this, the vast landscape of China along
with largest population in the world (>1.4 billion) has brought down COVID-19 cases/million
despite having ~82,000 cases of COVID-19 placed at 7th position in the world in terms of
total number of cases. Sri Lanka is another outlier in this group having only 11.6 COVID-19
cases/million which could be explained by the fact that it has become malaria-free just 3-4
years back and had significant malaria burden earlier, along with this, the local government’s
well-articulated and timely mitigation efforts further helped in halting the SARS-CoV-2
spread.

Malaria endemic countries have reduced prevalence of COVID-19
Similarly, we analyzed COVID-19 cases/million and malaria cases/million for 32 countries
having malaria (Figure 3). Countries with malaria burden of 1-1000 cases/million showed a
mixed kind of response to COVID-19 with burden ranging from 2.8 and 9.6 cases/million for
Vietnam and Bangladesh respectively, to 452 and 883 cases/million in Ecuador and Panama
respectively (Figure 3). High density of COVID-19 cases in Ecuador and Panama could be
due to significantly lower malaria burden (95.1 and 185 cases/million, respectively). Among
these, Republic of Korea has the highest total number of COVID-19 cases (10,613 cases) but
its well praised mitigation efforts and medical interventions have helped it to significantly
curtail the spread of SARS-COV-2. Also, it has a negligible malaria burden of only 9.8
cases/million. Countries with yearly malaria infections between 1,000 to 100 thousand
cases/million showed a very low numbers of COVID-19 burden ranging from ~4.3 to 446.8
cases/million. Out of these 10 countries, Djibouti, Peru and Brazil have highest density of
COVID-19 at nearly 447, 352 and 137 cases/million respectively. Djibouti surprisingly has
very high COVID-19 cases/million despite having high malaria burden of ~26,000
cases/million but it could be explained by looking at the number of actual COVID-19 cases
and its population. It has reported only 435 cases of COVID-19 but due to its smaller
population of only ~973,000, the COVID-19 burden expressed as cases per million, become
high enough to create delusion. Peru on the other hand despite having malaria burden of 1798

cases/million showed higher COVID-19 burden at 352 cases/million

which could be

attributed to its demography and lack of good healthcare infrastructure culminating into
inefficient screening and reporting. Brazil on the other hand showed COVID-19 burden of
137 cases/million which is on higher side in the group despite moderate malaria burden and
could be attributed to the lack of political will in containing the spread of SARS-COV-2.
Remaining seven countries of this group have negligible COVID-19 burden of ≤61
cases/million which correlated well with high burden of malaria in these countries. Further,
eight countries which are highly endemic for malaria having malaria burden more than 100
thousand cases/million showed a minimal burden of COVID-19 ranging from 2 to 31.6
cases/million. All of these countries showed less than 1000 total cases of COVID-19 thereby,
suggesting the negligible or no spread of this disease among its population (figure 3). Overall,
these quantitative analyses support our hypothesis that extent of malaria burden does play a
significant role in curtailing the spread of COVID-19 across the world.

Malaria free countries have higher COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR)
Relatively lower numbers of reported COVID-19 infections in a county, is also been
attributed to less number of tests being conducted, as the case for several Asian and African
Countries. In such situations, case fatality rate (CFR) will be a better assessment tool to
understand the fatality of COVID-19 infection in malaria endemic as well as malaria free
countries. For this, we analyzed the case fatality rate (expressed as percentage of COVID-19
positive cases who succumbed to the disease) for the four groups of countries divided on the
basis of malaria burden as described in the previous sections. In total population of malaria
free seventy six countries the COVID-19 case fatality rate is 6.63% and is highest among all
the groups (Figure 4). In the second group having mild malaria burden of 1 to 1000
cases/million, the COVID-19 case fatality rate of 3.88% is observed. Similarly, for the group
with moderate malaria burden of 1000 to 100 thousand cases/million, the COVID-19 case
fatality rate of 4.63% is observed. Whereas, in the group having severe burden of malaria
>100 thousand cases/million, the COVID-19 case fatality rate is just 2.58% which is the
lowest among four groups and also significantly lower than that of malaria free countries
(Figure 4). These case fatality statistics further support that along with lesser spread, the
fatality of SARS-CoV-2 is also mild in populations having higher malaria burden.

COVID-19 infection is spreading in the world very rapidly and had claimed about 0.15
million human lives till 18th April 2020. Based on our analyses we hypothesize that there is
natural resistance against the spread of this viral disease in malaria endemic countries, which
can be partially explained by immunity generated against recurrent malaria infections in these
endemic regions [7, 8]. The countries of African and Asian regions where malaria is
prevalent, have shown considerably fewer cases of COVID-19 infections as well as
mortalities. Whereas, majority of the European countries, which haven’t seen much of
malaria infection due to Plasmodium, have reported much higher number of COVID-19 cases
and associated mortalities. Hence, the population that has always remained unexposed to
malaria antigens thereby lacking anti-malarial immunity, showed a significantly higher
burden of COVID-19 in comparison to populations which are exposed to malaria infections.
It points toward resistance being provided by antimalarial immunity against the spread of
COVID-19 infection.
Cross immunity against infections is a phenomenon which is been shown in the past
[6], and it’s a well established fact now that one pathogen can generate immunity which can
be deleterious for another pathogen [6]. In addition, it is being shown that vaccine against one
pathogen can provide a long lasting immunity against another pathogen [5]. In this
antagonistic phenomenon, pathogen of certain species can inhibit the infection by another one
through inhibiting the invasion, survival and/or reproduction of another pathogen [9].
Different parasites are been reported to reduce the severity of viral infections, one of such
example comes from Giardia which can reduce the severity and infection of rotavirus if
concurrent infection takes place [10]. Plasmodium infection also can influence the infection
caused by Chiukungnya virus [11] where the protection is attributed to the inhibition of
CD8+ cell migration due to Plasmodium infection [11].
SARS-CoV has evolved a way to evade innate antiviral type I interferon responses of
host cells in order to prolong viral replication and survival [12]. Recent studies have also
suggested that dysregulated type I and II interferon responses may culminate in to failure of
the switch from hyperinnate immunity to protective adaptive immune responses in SARS
patients with a poor outcome [13] It is only in convalescent SARS-COV-2 patients that
increased levels of IFNγ, IL-4 and IL-10 were observed [14] [15] [16]. It points out to host
response towards SARS-COV-2 infections and protective role of IFN-γ and IL-10 against
the SARS-COV 2 infection.
Immune response due to malaria is bimodal in nature, which includes Th1-type
response for limiting initial parasitemia and further Th2 based cytokine production for

parasite clearance. It is a common assumption that immunity against malaria parasite is shortlived and that a continuous exposure to parasite antigens is needed to keep it alive. However,
several studies came up which differ from such observations and have pointed out that in
endemic areas anti-malarial immunity survive for longer durations [17] [18] [19] [20] [21]
[22] [23]. It has been observed that immigrants from endemic areas maintain some clinical
immunity against clinical malaria [24] [25] [26]. It is also been observed in epidemiological
studies that in areas of low and unstable malaria transmission, such as South Africa,
individuals having prior exposures even decades ago, can have protective immunity much
later in life [27].
Reemergence of malaria in Madagascar after a long period of total control, was not able to
infect people present 30 years earlier during malaria exposure. These Individuals were much
more resistant to clinical disease than were younger population, which points to an aspect of
immunity which is long lived [23].
Studies in malaria endemic regions has pointed out towards sustained levels of IFN-γ
and IL-10 cytokines upto 3 years and 6 years respectively [28] [29]. In experimental malaria,
single P. falciparum infection can approach the persistent of IFN-γ and γδ T cells which
remain viable up to 14 months [27] [30], whereas under natural infections the half-life for the
[31], with IL-10 and CD4+ T cells maintained till 6

IFN-

years [31]. Further, Treg cells in acute malaria episodes are also been suggested to expanded
from pre-exsisting pool of memory T cells [32]. As the analysis in our study pointed out
about less prevalence of COVID-19 infection in malaria endemic regions of the globe, it will
be relevant to consider role of immune-response against malaria in providing resistance to the
infection.
One may argue that the high malaria endemic regions are relatively warmer than the regions
worst affected by COVID-19 pandemic, but from overall consensus from past and current
data, it appears that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted in hot and humid weather as well [33].
In view of above mentioned literature we hypothesize that a pre-existing immunity,
due to malaria infection, in the malaria endemic countries is responsible for slow growth of
SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, the part of globe which has never faced malaria
transmission have not shown such resistance to the SARS-CoV-2 infection and hence the
high mortality and infections are been observed.
