Summary

25

Background: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

26

(SARS-CoV-2) results in a cluster of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We

27

reported the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory

28

distress syndrome (ARDS), and further investigated the treatment and progression of

29

ARDS in COVID-19.

30

Methods: This study enrolled 109 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Central

31

Hospital of Wuhan, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 2 to

32

February 1, 2020. Patients were followed up to February 12, 2020. The clinical data

33

were collected from the electronic medical records. The differences in the treatment

34

and progression with the time and the severity of ARDS were determined.

35

Findings: Among 109 patients, mean age was 55 years, and 59 patients were male.

36

With a median 15 days (range, 4 to 30 days) follow-up period, 31 patients (28.4%)

37

died, while 78 (71.6%) survived and discharged. Of all patients, 53 (48.6%)

38

developed ARDS. Compared to non-ARDS patients, ARDS patients were elder (mean

39

age, 61 years vs. 49 years), and more likely to have the coexistent conditions,

40

including diabetes (20.8% vs. 1.8%), cerebrovascular disease (11.3% vs. 0%), and

41

chronic kidney disease (15.1% vs. 3.6%). Compared to mild ARDS patients, those

42

with moderate and severe ARDS had higher mortality rates. No significant effect of

43

antivirus, glucocorticoid, or immunoglobulin treatment on survival was observed in

44

patients with ARDS.

45

Interpretation: The mortality rate increased with the severity of ARDS in COVID-19,

and the effects of current therapies on the survival for these patients were not

satisfactory, which needs more attention from clinicians.

Research in context

51

Evidence before this study

52

We searched PubMed and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database for

53

articles published up to Feb 24, 2020, using the keywords “novel coronavirus”, “2019

54

novel coronavirus”, “2019-nCoV”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”, “pneumonia”,

55

“coronavirus”, AND “clinical feature” ,“mortality”, AND “acute respiratory distress

56

syndrome”, “ARDS”, for articles published in both Chinese and English. We found

57

several recent articles describing the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients.

58

One autopsy report described pathological findings of a 50-year-old COVID-19

59

patient with ARDS. A recent research with 52 critically ill patients published in The

60

Lancet Respiratory Medicine indicated that older patients concurrent ARDS are at

61

increased risk of death. No published work about the comprehensive description of

62

clinical features, treatment, and mortality according to the severity of ARDS in

63

COVID-19 patients.

64

Added value of this study

65

We report the differences in the clinical manifestations between COVID-19 patients

66

with and without ARDS. Among 109 patients, 53 (48.6%) of them developed ARDS.

67

Compared with non-ARDS patients, patients with ARDS were elder and more likely

68

to have coexistent diseases. The mortality rate in ARDS patients (49.1%) was

69

significantly higher than that in non-ARDS patients (8.9%). The clinical

70

characteristics of COVID-19 patients varied with the severity of ARDS. High

71

mortality rates were found in patients with moderate and severe ARDS. The survival

72

of COVID-19 patients with ARDS was not significantly improved by the antivirus,

73

glucocorticoid, or immunoglobulin treatment.

74

Implications of all the available evidence

75

In the front-line epidemic area, COVID-19 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS

76

had high mortality rates. The current medical treatments might not have a satisfactory

77

effect on the in-hospital survival of COVID-19 patients with ARDS. For clinicians, it

78

is necessary to pay close attention to COVID-19 patients who are at high risk for

79

ARDS. The risk stratification and therapeutic strategy for COVID-19 patients should

80

be tailored according the variations in ARDS severity. It is essential for intensive care

81

physicians to participate in treatment decision-making and management in the early

82

stages of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Introduction

85

The emergent outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the

86

novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain a threat

87

to the public health worldwide 1,2. As of February 24, 2020, 77,262 cases were

88

confirmed, and 2,595 death cases were recorded in China. The number of confirmed

89

cases in other countries are ascending as well 3-5. COVID-19 may impose a great

90

socioeconomic, public health, and clinical burden, especially in the low-income and

91

middle-income countries.

92
93

Growing studies identified the clinical features of COVID-19 6-8. Similar to SARS in

94

2003, this infectious disease results in the high possibility of the admission to the

95

intensive care unit (ICU) and the mortality 6. Notably, due to the cytokine cascade

96

within a short period, the critically ill patients with COVID-19 were more likely to

97

develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and receive oxygen treatment 6.

98

ARDS was the most common complication in COVID-19 patients, with a high

99

mortality rate 6,7. The latest publication in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, Yang et

100

al. 9 reported that 67% of critically ill patients develop ARDS. However, little is

101

known regarding the clinical characteristics, treatment, and progression of COVID-19

102

patients according to the severity of ARDS.

103
104

In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of patients with COVID-19

105

who were admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan, and determined the differences

106

in the clinical characteristics between COVID-19 patients with and without ARDS.

107

Additionally, to reveal the evolvement of ARDS in COVID-19, we also investigated

108

the clinical features and therapies of COVID-19 patients at each severity level of

109

ARDS. Our study might provide new insight into the risk stratification and

110

therapeutic strategy for COVID-19 patients.

Methods

113

Study Population

114

We retrospectively analyzed the data of confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the

115

Central Hospital of Wuhan between January 2 and February 1, 2020. The Central

116

Hospital of Wuhan is one of the first designated hospitals to receive patients with

117

COVID-19. According to the World Health Organization interim guidance 10, the

118

diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 was based on the virus RNA detection, the clinical

119

characteristics, the chest imaging, and the ruling out common pathogen. Patients with

120

malignant tumors, previous craniocerebral operation, or died on admission were

121

excluded. In this study, we also excluded patients who had been transferred to other

122

hospitals for advanced life support and patients with mild symptoms who had been

123

transferred to mobile cabin hospitals. The clinical outcomes of patients were followed

124

up to February 12, 2020. Patients who were still in hospital before February 12, 2020

125

were excluded. Finally, 109 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included in the

126

analyses. All data were anonymous, and the requirement for informed consent was

127

waived. The Ethics Committees of the Central Hospital of Wuhan approved this study.

Data Collection

130

Case report forms, nursing records, laboratory findings, and radiological features were

131

reviewed. All data were collected onto the standardized forms from the electronic

132

medical records in the hospital. Two senior physicians independently reviewed the

133

data. Information on demographic data, symptoms, underlying comorbidities, chest

134

computed tomographic images, and laboratory results were included. All treatment

135

measures were collected during the hospitalization, such as antiviral therapy,

136

antibacterial therapy, corticosteroid therapy, immune support therapy, and respiratory

137

support. The time of disease onset was defined as the day of symptom onset. The time

138

from the first symptom to the fever clinics, hospital admission, and clinical outcomes

139

were recorded. A confirmed respiratory tract specimen was defined as positive for

140

SARS-CoV-2. Repeated tests for SARS-CoV-2 were done in the confirmed patients to

141

show viral clearance before the hospital discharge. The Berlin definition was applied

142

to determine the presence and severity of ARDS 11. Acute Physiology and Chronic

143

Health Evaluation II (APACHE II), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)

144

scores and CURB-65 criteria 12 were determined within 24 hours after admission.

150

respiratory specimens was detected by real-time reverse transcription polymerase

151

chain reaction (RT-PCR). Two target genes were used, including open reading frame

152

lab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N), and the sequences were as follows:

153

ORF1ab: forward primer CCCTGTGGGTTTTACACTTAA; reverse primer

154

ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA. N: forward primer

155

GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT; reverse primer

156

CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG. The real-time RT-PCR assay was conducted in

157

line with the manufacturer’s protocol (Beijing Genomics Institution and Geneodx

158

biotechnology Co. Ltd). Positive test results for two target genes were considered as

159

laboratory-confirmed infection.

Statistical Analysis

162

Normally distributed continuous variables were presented as mean ± SD, compared

163

by Student’s t-test. Skew distributed continuous variables were shown as median

164

(interquartile range [IQR]), analyzed by Mann–Whitney test or Kruskal–Wallis test.

165

Categorical variables were compared by Chi-square test or the Fisher’s exact test.

166

Kaplan–Meier methods were used for survival plotting, and log-rank test for

167

comparison of survival curves. The dynamic trajectory in laboratory parameters was

168

plotted using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, Inc). Generalized linear mixed

169

models examined the differences in the laboratory data between ARDS and non-

170

ARDS groups over time. All statistical analysis were performed by the statistical

171

software packages R (http://www.R-project.org, The R Foundation) and the

176

Clinical Characteristics

177

A total of 109 patients with COVID-19 were included in the current study. The

178

baseline clinical parameters of overall COVID-19 patients and COVID-19 patients

179

with and without ARDS were summarized in Table 1. Mean age of all subjects was

180

55 years (IQR, 43-66 years; range, 22-94 years), and 54.1% of all patients were male.

181

The most common symptom at the illness onset was fever (82.6%), followed by dry

182

cough (61.5%) and fatigue (56.9%). Seventy-six patients (69.7%) had underlying

183

comorbidities, including hypertension (33.9%), diabetes (11.0%), and chronic kidney

184

disease (9.2%). The first virus RNA detection rate was 24.8% in the fever clinics, and

185

all patients were reconfirmed by repeated virus RNA testing after admission. Among

186

109 patients, 53 (48.6%) of them developed ARDS, 100 (91.7%) of them had bilateral

187

involvement of the chest radiographs, and 28 (25.7%) patients received high-flow

188

nasal oxygen ventilation, while 31 (28.4%) died.

189
190

Compared with non-ARDS patients with COVID-19, ARDS patients were elder

191

(mean age, 61 years vs. 49 years), and more likely to have coexistent diabetes (20.8%

192

vs. 1.8%), cerebrovascular disease (11.3% vs. 0%), and chronic kidney disease (15.1%

193

vs. 3.6%). The bilateral involvement in the chest radiographs was identified in all

194

ARDS patients, but in 83.9% non-ARDS patients. The likelihood to receive high-flow

195

nasal ventilation for ARDS patients (49.1%) was significantly higher than that for

196

non-ARDS patients (3.6%). The mortality rate in ARDS patients (49.1%) was also

197

significantly higher than that in non-ARDS patients (8.9%).

198
199

Disease Severity Scores and Laboratory Findings in COVID-19 Patients With

200

and Without ARDS

201

The disease severity evaluation and laboratory examination of non-ARDS and ARDS

202

patients with COVID-19 on admission were shown in Table 2. Compared with non-

203

ARDS subjects, ARDS subjects had significantly higher disease severity on the day of

204

hospital admission (all P values <0.001 for CURB-65, SOFA, and APACHE II).

205

ARDS patients were more likely accompanied by lymphopenia on admission (P value

206

<0.001). Besides, the levels of lactate, neutrophil count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and

207

procalcitonin were significantly higher in ARDS patients than in non-ARDS patients

208

(median lactate level, 1.6 vs. 1.1 mmol/L; median neutrophil count level, 4.1 vs. 3.2

209

×109/L; median CRP level, 4.9 vs. 2.0 mg/dL; median procalcitonin level, 0.15 vs.

210

0.06 ng/mL). Significant increased levels of blood urea nitrogen, serum fibrinogen, D-

211

dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase in ARDS patients were observed, compared with

212

those in non-ARDS patients (all P values <0.05).

213
214

As shown in Figure 1, the dynamic trajectory in nine laboratory parameters were

215

tracked on Day 1, 3, 7 and 14, respectively. Significant differences in the levels of

216

neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, CRP, procalcitonin, and D-dimer were found

217

between ARDS and non-ARDS patients with COVID-19 (all P values <0.05). From

218

Day 1 to 14, ARDS patients had significantly lower lymphocyte count levels, while

219

the levels of other laboratory findings were higher in ARDS patients.

220
221

Clinical Profile and Progression of COVID-19 Patients With ARDS

222

According to the severity of ARDS, we further analyzed the clinical features,

223

treatment, and progression of 53 COVID-19 patients with ARDS. As presented in

224

Table 3, the increase in APACHE II, SOFA, and CURB criteria scores occurred

225

concomitantly with the severity of ARDS (all P values <0.001). The levels of lactate,

226

blood urea nitrogen, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase ascended with the severity

227

of ARDS (all P values <0.05), whereas the lymphocyte count levels decreased (P

228

value = 0.045). Patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS were the most likely to

229

receive glucocorticoid therapy (P value = 0.02) and high-flow nasal oxygen

230

ventilation (P value <0.001). Compared to patients with mild ARDS, those with

231

moderate and severe ARDS had higher mortality rates (P value <0.001). Subsequent

232

survival analysis was shown in Figure 2. We found no significant effect of antivirus,

233

glucocorticoid, or immunoglobulin treatment on survival in COVID-19 patients with

234

ARDS (all log-rank tests P >0.05).

Discussion

237

In the present study of ARDS progression in COVID-19, we firstly identified the

238

differences in the clinical manifestations between COVID-19 patients with and

239

without ARDS. Second, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients varied with

240

the severity of ARDS. High mortality rates were observed in patients with moderate-

241

to-severe ARDS. Third, we did not observe any apparent effect of the current

242

therapeutic interventions on the in-hospital survival of COVID-19 patients with

243

ARDS. Our findings might highlight the clinical significance in the enhanced

244

attention towards COVID-19 patients at high risks of ARDS.

245
246

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the clinical features

247

and progression of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients according to the severity of ARDS.

248

We revealed that elder patients, or complicated by diabetes, cerebrovascular disease,

249

and chronic kidney disease, were more likely to develop ARDS. This finding might

250

further explain the significant association of age and comorbidity conditions with the

251

poor clinical outcomes in a previous COVID-19 study 7. In addition, the elevated

252

levels of neutrophil count, CRP, procalcitonin and D-dimer, but the decreased

253

lymphocyte count levels, were detected in patients with ARDS, rather than those

254

without ARDS. Similarly, the levels of lactate and D-dimer increased with the

255

progression of ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2, while severer lymphopenia occurred over

256

time. Our investigations into these laboratory indicators were comparable with other

257

COVID-19 studies 6,7,13, suggesting that cytokine cascade, excessive inflammatory

258

reaction, and coagulation dysfunction might evolve in the course of ARDS resulted

259

from SARS-CoV-2.

260
261

Our understanding of this ARDS progression could be furthered by a recent autopsy

262

report on a 50-year-old COVID-19 patient with ARDS 14, which was highlighted by

263

the inflammatory infiltration of lymphocytes in both lungs and the immune

264

hyperactivation in the patient. Interestingly, no obvious heart injury occurred in this

265

patient, while the liver injury might be caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection or

266

medication use 14. These pathological results were concordant with our clinical

267

observation of a dysregulated inflammatory and immune state in COVID-19 patients

268

with ARDS, which might in turn help to guide our medical therapy.

269
270

The medical management of ARDS has advanced remarkably during the past decades

271

15

272

from 11% to 87% 16. In our study, most patients with COVID-19 received antibiotics

273

and antivirus treatment, while over half of them were given by glucocorticoid and

274

intravenous immunoglobulin therapies. Moderate-to-severe ARDS patients were more

275

likely to use high-flow nasal oxygen ventilation. Unfortunately, the mortality rate was

276

extremely high in severe ARDS patients with COVID-19, and the survival of COVID-

277

19 patients with ARDS was not improved by the antivirus, glucocorticoid, or

278

immunoglobulin treatment. Some potential reasons might interpret the high mortality

279

we observed: First, due to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak within a short period, the

designated hospitals were overloaded in short term, with inadequate medical facilities

281

and insufficient medical staff. Notably, intensive care resources are in short supply

282

and may fail to meet demand under the increasing number critically ill patients.

Second, the Central Hospital of Wuhan is close to Huanan Seafood Market, and the

284

inpatients were the first or the second generation infected patients. In addition, the

285

inadequate preparation and insufficient understanding of the disease might contribute

286

to increased mortality in the front-line epidemic area during the early outbreak period.

287
288

The epidemic spread knows no borders. We are deeply concerned about the current

289

outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. As the low-income and middle-income countries are more

290

vulnerable to the lack of medical resources, the mortality rate of infectious diseases

291

may be even higher. Therefore, from a policy perspective, the government should

292

provide capital, technology, and manpower to curb the epidemic. Meanwhile, in the

293

front-line epidemic area, limited medical resources should be allocated reasonably

294

and effectively. Based on our observation, some patients progress quickly to severe

295

pneumonia or ARDS without warning sign. Adequate critical care resources and the

296

involvement of intensive care physicians are essential in the early stages of the SARS-

297

CoV-2 outbreak.

298
299

The present study is subjected to several limitations. Due to the retrospective nature of

300

the present study, a systematic selection bias could be introduced. We could not

301

completely address the residual confounding factors as well. Although our laboratory

302

observations showed the significant changes with the time and the severity of ARDS,

303

the clinical predictive value remained to be determined. In addition, our results on the

304

effect of the current treatments should be considered with caution, and high-quality

305

clinical interventional studies are needed. Meanwhile, the benefits of the invasive

306

ventilation therapy on the disease prognosis should be further investigated. In the

307

future, a multi-center and follow-up study with a larger cohort is eagerly warranted.

308
309

Conclusions

310

In the current study from one of the designated hospitals in Wuhan, China, the

311

significant changes with the time and the severity of ARDS were observed in COVID-

312

19 patients. Moreover, COVID-19 patients with moderate and severe ARDS had high

313

mortality rates. The current medical treatments might not have a significant effect on

314

the in-hospital survival of COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Our observations might

315

help to guide the risk stratification and therapeutic strategy for COVID-19 patients.

Figure 1. Timeline charts illustrate the laboratory parameters in 109 patients with COVID-19 (56 non-ARDS and 53 ARDS) on day 1, day 3, day

406

7, and day 14 after admission. Data are represented as geometric mean and 95% confidence interval (one group only shows the upper or lower

407

bar). The dash lines in black show the upper normal limit of each parameter, and the dash line in red shows the lower normal limit of lymphocyte

408

count.
