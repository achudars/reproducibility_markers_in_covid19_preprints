ABSTRACT
Monocytes and dendritic cells are crucial mediators of innate and adaptive immune responses
during viral infection, but misdirected responses by these cells might contribute to
immunopathology. A comprehensive map of the mononuclear phagocyte (MNP) landscape
during SARS-CoV-2 infection and concomitant COVID-19 disease is lacking. We performed
25-color flow cytometry-analysis focusing on MNP lineages in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients
with moderate and severe COVID-19. While redistribution of monocytes towards intermediate
subset and decrease in circulating DCs occurred in response to infection, severe disease
associated with appearance of Mo-MDSC-like cells and a higher frequency of pre-DC2.
Furthermore, phenotypic alterations in MNPs, and their late precursors, were cell-lineage
specific and in select cases associated with severe disease. Finally, unsupervised analysis
revealed that the MNP profile, alone, could identify a cluster of COVID-19 non-survivors. This
study provides a reference for the MNP response to clinical SARS-CoV-2 infection and unravel
myeloid dysregulation associated with severe COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
The current COVID-19 pandemic has claimed more than 800.000 lives worldwide during its
first 8 months in 2020. Clinical presentation of COVID-19 can vary from asymptomatic to lifethreatening acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure. Additional
potentially lethal complications include profound coagulation abnormalities associated with
systemic thrombogenicity combined with a hyperinflammatory state1,2. Despite a steadily
growing body of information regarding the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection
and the pathophysiology behind COVID-19, it is still unclear why certain patients enter the
detrimental courses of the disease while others merely present with mild or no symptoms2.
Thus, there is an urgent need to characterize in depth the immunological and inflammatory
aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and ensuing COVID-19 disease.

Mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) in peripheral blood comprise of dendritic cells (DCs) and
monocytes, with central roles in orchestrating induction of both innate and adaptive immune
responses. Monocytes and DCs are at the front line during an infection, able to recognize,
process, and present antigens to immune cells and at the same time produce cytokines and
regulate immune responses3,4. These cells are divided in subsets with respect to their ontogeny
and specialized functions. The monocytes are rapidly recruited to the site of infection, and can
be divided into three major subsets; i.e., classical, intermediate, and non-classical5-7.
Monocytes provide both proinflammatory and/or resolving activities as a supplement to other
immune cells present at the site of infection8,9. DCs are also a heterogeneous group of cells
divided into conventional DCs (cDCs) and type I interferon- (IFN-) producing plasmacytoid
DCs (pDCs)10,11. Among cDCs, cDC1s are specialized in cross-presenting antigens to CD8+ T
cells while cDC2s initiate T helper cell responses, both essential for successful viral clearance12.
cDC1s constitute a discrete population of cells identified based on highly specific markers such

as CLEC9A. cDC2s are more heterogeneous as evident by the functionally distinct CD5+ DC2
and CD5- DC3 subsets, among which inflammatory DC3s, positive for the classically monocyte
restricted marker CD14 are found13-16. In addition, circulating DC precursors, described as preDC17 or AS DC18, have recently been discovered.

Except for having a central role in the defence against infections, misdirected MNP responses
might also contribute to immunopathology. Indeed, the importance of monocytes, monocytederived cells and DCs in COVID-19 pathogenesis is emerging19-27. Yet, a detailed
understanding of developmental and phenotypic alterations, especially with respect to DC
lineages and their circulating precursors in COVID-19, is lacking. Moreover, clues on how the
altered MNP compartment in COVID-19 is linked to host response to the virus, disease severity,
clinical complications, and final outcome are limited. Therefore, we here performed a deep
profiling of peripheral blood MNP landscape using 25-color flow cytometry, integrated with
publically available single-cell transcriptional data from lung tissue, as well as soluble
inflammatory serum factors in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with moderate and severe
COVID-19. Altogether, the present results provide a comprehensive resource of the MNP
landscape in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and ensuing COVID-19 disease.

RESULTS
SARS-CoV-2 infection causes declining numbers of circulating cDCs, their progenitors,
and pDCs
To study the immune profile of MNPs in SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalized patients with
ongoing moderate and severe COVID-19 disease were recruited based on strict inclusion and
exclusion criteria early in their disease course (Fig. 1A, Supp. Material and Methods, Supp.
Table 1, Supp. Table 2). There was no difference in time from onset of symptoms until hospital
admission, nor until study sampling, in the two severity groups (Supp. Table 2). An integrative
analysis approach was taken where the detailed phenotype of distinct MNP lineages was
analyzed in relation to the clinical disease status, combining supervised and unsupervised
strategies, with the aim to comprehensively chart the response of circulating MNPs in response
to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID-19 disease (Fig. 1B). As immune
homeostasis is significantly disrupted in COVID-19, canonical lineage markers, such as HLADR used to identify discrete subsets of MNPs, are altered in expression19. As a point of
departure, we designed an MNP-focused 25-color flow cytometry panel (Fig. 1C). After
exclusion of granulocytes (CD15+), NK cells (CD7+), ILCs (CD7+), B cells (CD19+), T cells
(CD3+), circulating early progenitors (CD34+), basophils (FCER1A+HLA-DR-), and plasma
cells (CD38+CD45RA+CD19low), the total MNPs were identified among the cells defined as
CD88+ and/or CD116+ (Fig. 1E, D). The MNP identification-strategy allowed clear
visualization of DC1, pre-DC and pre-DC2, cDC2, CD5+ DC2, and three subsets of DC3
(CD163-CD14-, CD163-CD14+, CD163+CD14+) (Fig. 2A). This approach was further
validated by assessing DC subset-specific markers (Fig. 2B). Next, analysis of absolute
numbers of the identified DC subsets revealed that all subsets were decreased in SARS-CoV-2
infected patients (Fig. 2C). In relation to the drastic loss in patients compared to controls, only
minor differences where noted between severity groups with pDC and pre-DC loss, if anything,

even more profound in the severe COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2D), and with no major differences
in-between the different DC sublineages (Fig. 2E). Thus, declining circulating cDCs, their late
progenitors, and pDCs is a response feature in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

DC response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and affected developmental-related phenotypes
detected in severe COVID-19
Next, a detailed phenotypic mapping of each DC subset was performed. As a starting-point,
Phenograph clustering was performed. The revealed clusters corresponded to all major DC
subsets (Fig. 3A). When investigating the phenotype of DC1, upregulated expression of AXL,
related to type-I IFN signaling, was a general feature in COVID-19 along with decreased
expression of the differentiation marker c-KIT (Fig. 3B-D). Of note, IFN-signaling was also
the strongest pathway activated in DC1s at the site of infection as assessed in bronchioalveolar
lavage (BAL) samples (Fig. 3E, re-analysis of public scRNA-seq data of BAL immune cells of
COVID-19 patients and controls, Supp. Fig. A-R). Circulating pDCs were observed to respond
with decreased levels of CD45RA (Fig. 3F-G), while pDCs in BAL were enriched for cytokine
and chemokine signaling pathways and further presented with reduced gene expression of
LAMP5, known to be downregulated in response to TLR9 stimulation and type I IFN
signaling28, in severe COVID-19 patients (Fig. 3I). Focusing on cDC2s, an increase in
frequencies of CD5+ DC2s was detected in moderate COVID-19 (Fig. 3J-K), while a
percentage reduction of CD163-CD14- DC3s was noted in severe COVID-19 with an otherwise
stable relationship among the DC3 subsets (Fig. 3L). Analyzing the pre-DC subsets (Fig. 3M),
a higher percentage of pre-DC2 among the total pre-DC was seen in severe COVID-19 (Fig.
3N). In pre-DCs, an upregulation of the stem cell marker c-KIT was detected in severe COVID19 (Fig. 3O), and AXL was decreased in response to infection. The levels of AXL correlated
positively with serum levels of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L), central for DC

development (Fig. 3M). Finally, levels of the maturation markers HLA-DR and CD86, the ectoenzyme CD38, the inhibitory receptor CD200R, the GM-CSF receptor (CD116), the IL-6R
(CD126), thrombomodulin (CD141), and a possible SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor
CD147 were assessed across the DC subsets (Fig. 3Q). Higher levels of CD38 were detected
specifically in moderate COVID-19 patients, while the maturation markers HLA-DR and CD86
were decreased across all DC subsets (with an exception for DC1s) in severe disease (Fig. 3Q).
Finally, in severe disease, all subsets of the cDC2 linage presented with lower levels of CD200R
while DC1s specifically downregulated the IL-6R (Fig. 3Q). Taken together, this analysis
suggests lineage specific changes and affected developmental phenotype in DC subsets of
COVID-19 patients that occur either in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection or specifically in
patients with severe COVID-19 disease.

Major phenotypic alterations within monocyte subpopulations of COVID-19 patients
Next, we focused on monocytes and their subsets (Fig. 4A). As expected, three major
populations of monocytes were identified based on CD14 and CD16 expression; i.e.,
CD14+CD16- cMonos, CD14+CD16+ iMonos, and CD14lowCD16++ ncMonos (Fig. 4A).
UMAP-analysis verified the present gating strategy and demonstrated separation between
monocytes and DCs (Fig. 4A). This was also the case for DC3s, which in many aspects are
similar to monocytes in phenotype, especially due to their expression of CD14 (Fig. 4A). In
accordance with previous publications, iMonos expressed the highest levels of HLA-DR while
cMonos displayed relatively high levels of CCR2 (Fig. 4B). Assessment of absolute counts of
monocyte populations in COVID-19 patients and controls revealed no change in cMono
numbers, significantly increased iMono numbers in response to infection, especially in
moderate patients, and declining numbers of ncMonos in all patients (Fig. 4C). A similar pattern
was observed when monocyte subset frequencies were assessed (Fig. 4D). While increased

CD38 expression across monocyte subsets was a general feature unrelated to disease severity,
higher levels of CCR2 on ncMonos and iMonos, as well as lower levels of HLA-DR and CD86
with increased expression of CD163 in all monocyte subsets were found in severe COVID-19
(Fig. 4E). Furthermore, thrombomodulin (CD141) expression was increased in severe COVID19 in ncMonos and iMonos while it was also increased in moderate patients in cMonos (Fig.
4E). In summary, this shows redistribution and an immature phenotype of the monocyte
compartment in COVID-19 that is linked to disease severity.

Dimensionality reduction reveals MDSC phenotype in severe COVID-19
To analyze the global monocyte landscape in an unbiased manner and integrate the contribution
of all tested markers, we next re-clustered all monocytes revealing high heterogeneity of cells
that fell into the cMono category (Fig. 4F). Indeed, cMonos stratified into 15 Phenograph
clusters whereas only one or two clusters were found for iMono and ncMono (Fig. 4F, Supp.
Fig. 1A). When assessing these clusters in relation to disease severity, only one cluster (#4,
corresponding to ncMonos) was reduced in all patients compared to controls whereas clusters
9 and 10 were specifically increased in severe compared to moderate patients and healthy
controls (Fig. 4G, Supp. Fig. 1A). Next, when clusters with differential presence among the
three groups (Supp. Fig. 1A) were ordered sequentially (controls, moderate and severe
patients), a distinct phenotypic pattern emerged (Fig. 4H). In clusters enriched in moderate and
severe patients, falling into the cMono category, higher expression of the GM-CSF receptor
(CD116), IL-6R (CD126), CD147, CD38, and CCR2 was found. Monocyte clusters specific to
severe COVID-19 patients (clusters 9, 10) compared to the ones from patients with moderate
disease (clusters 3, 5, 17) had lower levels of HLA-DR and CD86. This phenotype was
reminiscent of a monocytic myeloid derived suppressor cell (Mo-MDSC)-like phenotype29,30.
In addition, the Mo-MDSC-like cluster 9 expressed high levels of c-KIT and CD163 (Fig. 4H).

Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between cMono Phenograph clusters specific to
severe COVID-19 disease (clusters 2, 9, 10, 18) and the soluble immunosuppressive factors IL10, TGF-b, and VEGFA as well as with AREG (Fig. 4I, J), known to be involved in tolerance
and tissue repair31. In contrast, these clusters showed a negative association with stem cell
factors important for myeloid cell development and differentiation (Fig. 4I). The Mo-MDSClike clusters also correlated positively with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), known to support
Mo-MDSC expansion32 (Fig. 4I). To search for evidence of an Mo-MDSC signature at the site
of infection, publicly available single cell RNA-seq data of BAL from healthy controls,
moderate, and severe COVID-19 patients was used22 (Supp. Fig. 2A-P). The expression of MoMDSC signature genes, comparing monocyte versus Mo-MDSC33, was significantly higher in
MNPs from severe patients compared to controls (e.g. IFITM1, IFITM2, GRINA, SOCS3, and
CD84) (Fig. 4K, Supp. list 1). In line with the specific immune suppressive Mo-MDSC gene
expression pattern, MHC class II molecules and CD74 were found at lower levels in severe
COVID-19 patients compared to controls (Fig. 4K). Altogether, this analysis revealed
monocyte heterogeneity related to COVID-19 disease severity and an expansion of monocytes
with a MDSC-like phenotype only in severe COVID-19 patients.

Viremia and seroconversion are associated with recovery of inflammatory DC3s
The patients all presented with elevated inflammatory markers but clinical hyperinflammation
and signs of coagulation disturbances were most pronounced in the severe COVID-19 patients
(Fig. 5A, Supp. cohort description). Integrative correlation mapping of clinical parameters,
including peak measurements recorded during hospitalization up until study sampling (Fig. 5B)
and those taken within 24 hours from MNP profiling (Supp. Fig. 3A) revealed that levels of
inflammatory cytokines and LDH clustered together with fatal outcome and viremia. Indeed,
subgroups of moderate and severe COVID-19 patients had detectable virus in serum (serum

PCR+, measured at study sampling), while the majority of seroconverted (SARS-CoV-2 IgG+,
measured at study sampling) patients were critically ill (74%, 14/19) (Fig. 5C). Significantly
higher numbers of pre-DC2 as well as of inflammatory DC3 (CD163+CD14+ DC3 and
CD163+CD14- DC3) were found in patients without ongoing viremia (serum PCR-) and the
same DC3 populations were elevated in seroconverted patients (Fig. 5C, Supp. Fig. 3B).
Following a similar trend, ncMonos were also present at higher numbers in seroconverted
patients (Fig. 5C, Supp. Fig. 3B). As expected, patients that had seroconverted (IgG+) were
sampled slightly later in their disease course (Fig. 5D). Absolute numbers of the inflammatory
DC3 subset (CD163+CD14- DC3) as well as iMonos and cMonos increased over time after
onset of symptoms (Fig. 5E, Supp. Fig. 3C), suggesting that seroconverted patients had passed
the time-point when their DC3s were at their lowest levels. Thus, subset-specific changes in
MNPs absolute numbers depended on the time from symptom onset, and were associated with
a time-dependent recovery of DC3 and increase of monocytes and monocyte-like cells.

Independent assessment of the MNP landscape identifies clinical subgroups and disease
outcome-correlates in COVID-19
Finally, to get an overall view of the MNP landscape in relation to COVID-19 disease severity,
we performed a principal component analysis of the 108 MNP parameters measured. Here,
COVID-19 patients clearly separated from healthy controls and within the patient groups,
moderate and severe additionally clustered apart (Fig. 5F). The MNP parameters that
contributed highly to separate the groups were: higher DC counts and Mono cluster 4 (nonclassical monocytes), higher c-KIT expression in DC1, higher CD45RA expression in pDCs,
and higher HLA-DR, CD86 and CD200R expression in cDC2 lineage in controls; higher CD38
expression in MNPs, higher frequency of CD5+ DC2s among cDC2s in moderate patients
COVID-19; and an expansion of Mo-MDSC-like clusters (9 and 10), higher c-KIT levels in

DC progenitors, and higher frequencies of pre-DC2s in severe patients (Fig. 5F, Supp. Fig. 3D).
Dimensionality reduction using UMAP and Phenograph was performed using the same MNP
variables, revealing 3 major clusters, where cluster 1 corresponded to healthy controls, cluster
2 corresponded to all moderate and some severe COVID-19 patients, and cluster 3
corresponded to severe COVID-19 patients only (Fig. 5G). All patients with fatal outcome were
found in cluster 3 and these further had a high oxygen requirement, showed higher levels of
LDH (peak measurement), high neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, and elevated ferritin (measured
within 24 hours from MNP profiling) (Fig. 5G, Supp. Fig. 3E). To visualize the key MNP
profile components specific for each cluster, 44 of the most significant MNP parameters
analyzed so far were selected and subjected to hierarchical clustering. Monocyte clusters 9 and
10, corresponding to Mo-MDSC-like cells, were specific to patient cluster 3 with the nonsurvivors. These parameters also clustered together with CD163 expression on all monocyte
subsets, CCR2 expression on iMonos, and c-KIT in total pre-DCs. For moderate disease, higher
expression of CD38 in all DC lineages, CD141 on cMono, and higher levels of monocyte cluster
18 (iMono, the only cluster expressing high levels of CD200R among the patient specific
clusters), were the determining parameters. A set of markers were lost in severe patients
including HLA-DR and CD86 in both monocytes and DCs, and CD200R in DC subsets (Fig.
5H). Moreover, the CD200R decrease in non-survivors was restricted to the cDC2 lineage, with
the most significant differences seen in progenitors (pre-DCs and pre-DC2) (Supp. Fig. 3F).
Finally, to address if this was entirely dependent on severity status rather than outcome,
CD200R levels were assessed within severe patients only. A similar pattern was observed,
suggesting that CD200R is diminished in the cDC2 lineage and is related not only to disease
severity but also to fatal outcome (Supp. Fig. 3F). Altogether our results suggest lineage
restricted phenotypic and developmental shifts in MNPs and their late precursors and show that
MNPs, alone, could identify a cluster of COVID-19 non-survivors (Fig. 5 and 6).

DISCUSSION
While broad efforts towards getting an overview of immune cell- and soluble factor alterations
in COVID-19 are under way, a deep and comprehensive understanding of the mononuclear
phagocyte (MNP) system, including circulating progenitors, is lacking. Here, we used highdimensional flow cytometry to characterize the MNP landscape in well-defined prospective
cohorts of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 disease as well
as matched SARS-CoV-2 IgG negative healthy controls. This allowed a robust mapping of
phenotypic and developmental alterations in circulating DCs and monocytes that occurred
either in response to clinical infection or specifically in severely sick patients (Fig. 6). By
combining conventional gating with unsupervised dimensionality reduction, we provide a
reference for absolute numbers and lineage dependent phenotypic shifts in MNP subsets in
response to SARS-CoV-2 and reveal an affected developmental phenotype in the cDC2 lineage
and expansion of monocytic MDSC-like cells in critically ill patients. In addition, the results
were related to data from the site of infection and severe inflammatory impact by means of reanalysing BAL scRNA-seq data and relevant soluble factors in circulation. Finally, and
strikingly, alterations within the MNP landscape, alone, were found to separate healthy controls
from patients and further identify distinct patient clusters such as moderate and severe as well
as within severe patients even those with fatal outcome. Thus, the present high-dimensional
mapping of the MNP landscape yields new insights into the MNP response during SARS-CoV2 infection and in relation to COVID-19 disease severity and provides a comprehensive
framework for future studies (Fig. 6).

Knowledge on alterations of specific DC subsets and their circulating progenitors in acute viral
infection in humans is limited, but the depletion of all DCs and their precursors detected here
is in line with previous studies showing DC disappearance in circulation during acute viral

insults20,34,35. Given their central role in antigen recognition and control of adaptive immunity36
as well as their presence in COVID-19 lung22, it is plausible that DC disappearance from the
circulation is related to their influx to tissues and lymph nodes to lead and assist initiation of
adaptive immune responses aiming at virus elimination. In support of this, we find recovery of
absolute numbers of pre-DC2s as well as subsets of DC3s in patients where virus has been
cleared from circulation and seroconversion occurred. Other features of host response included
decreased levels of c-KIT in DC1, expansion of AXL+DC1 and CD5+ DC2s, similarly to
monocytes increased expression of the ecto-enzyme CD38 in most DC subsets, and decreased
CD45RA on pDC possibly indicating activation as also detected in lung tissue. It has been
shown that DC1s downregulate c-KIT upon viral stimulation in an IFN-dependent manner37,
and it is thus possible that lower c-KIT levels in DC1 found here indicate DC1 SARS-CoV-2
sensing. In support of this, pathways analysis of DC1s in COVID-19 lung revealed PRR-related
pathways and an IFN-response imprint. The expansion of AXL+ DC1 in circulation could
further support an IFN-affected phenotype, as AXL has been shown to be upregulated on
myeloid cells upon type I IFN stimulation38.

In severe COVID-19 disease, the DC phenotype showed affected maturation status with lower
levels of HLA-DR and CD86 in all DC subsets, with an exception for DC1, and an altered
developmental phenotype with expansion of late progenitors pre-DC2 and increased expression
of the stem cell marker c-KIT in pre-DCs. Additional lineage specific DC alterations in severe
COVID-19 included downregulation of IL-6R in DC1 and a drastic decrease of the inhibitory
receptor CD200R in the cDC2 lineage, including circulating progenitors. Decreased CD200R
levels might be of particular interest in development of severe COVID-19, given that CD200R
signalling is known to modulate immune responses to pathogenic stimuli, control myeloid cell
function, inhibit proinflammatory cytokine expression, and inhibit tissue damage caused by

myeloid-derived cells39,40. Moreover, it has been suggested that CD200R signalling plays an
important role in T cell priming during viral infection41, but remains to be studied in further
detail in COVID19. Our findings suggest that in severe COVID-19, DCs, and in particular the
cDC2 lineage, are immature with alterations in the developmental phenotype, lack upregulation
of the activation marker CD38 that is seen in moderate patients, and loose the inhibitory
receptor CD200R, all possibly contributing to inefficient regulation of pro-inflammatory
conditions in severe COVID-19.

In line with previous reports, we observed an expansion of intermediate CD14+CD16+
monocytes in COVID-19 patients21,42. This appeared to be a general feature of clinical SARSCoV-2 infection. In addition, all monocyte subsets responded with increased CD38 expression,
that in contrast to DCs, was independent on disease severity. It is plausible that iMonos,
exhibiting a strong IFN-signature in COVID-1927, contribute to successful viral clearance in
moderate COVID-19 patients. In addition, the Phenograph cluster we identified that
corresponded to iMonos (cluster 18, Fig. 4H) had high levels of the inhibitory receptor
CD200R, supporting the hypothesis that robust innate antiviral responses as well as efficient
control of the pro-inflammatory state are important in order to have a moderate course of
COVID-1943. On the other hand, in line with previous observations19,27,44, monocytic cell
clusters with an immature phenotype (in particular cluster 9 and 10), identified as Mo-MDSClike cells, were linked to severe disease and a patient cluster that included all non-survivors.
Further studies are required to understand whether Mo-MDSC-like cells described here in fact
have suppressor functions, e.g., through a supply of immunosuppressive cytokines, that in the
present study showed a positive correlation with Mo-MDSC-like cell frequencies. It is possible
that a myeloid differentiation bias in the bone marrow, reflected by the expansion of immature
Mo-MDSC-like cells and the lack of adequate expansion of CD14+CD16+ iMonos, the latter

being better equipped to clear virus through the IFN-response, contribute to the
immunopathogenesis of COVID-19. In support of this, we found a negative correlation between
Mo-MDSC and the growth factors FLT3L and SCF, which are required for myeloid
differentiation. This coincided with a positive correlation between Mo-MDSC and HGF, known
to mediate Mo-MDSC expansion32 (Fig. 5I). This would fit with the model of sequential
transition, suggesting that a certain proportion of cMonos eventually become iMonos, followed
by their development into ncMonos45. While the elevated CCR2 on ncMonos found here may
present an explanation for their more pronounced disappearance from the circulation in severe
COVID-19, a sequential transition model might also explain the decrease of ncMonos detected
in COVID-19 patients by us (Fig. 4C, D) and others20,27,35,42.

Hyperinflammation in COVID-19 is characterized by high systemic cytokine levels combined
with coagulation abnormalities and thromboembolism46-48, also indicated in our study by
increased levels of fibrinogen and D-dimer. Increased levels of thrombomodulin (CD141), a
cofactor for thrombin reducing blood coagulation, possibly possessing an anticoagulant
potential, were observed on cMonos in both moderate and severe disease, and on iMonos and
ncMonos in severe COVID-19. While the role of the extracellular metalloprotease inducer
CD147 that was discussed to be a viral spike protein receptor remains to be determined, it is
also a potential host factor in infection-mediated coagulation49. In the present study, elevated
levels of CD147 on iMonos and ncMonos was a general feature of all patients, while increased
levels of CD147 on pDCs, pre-DCs and pre-DC2s were specific to severe COVID-19. In this
context it is interesting to note that DC progenitors can themselves be susceptible to viral
insult50. It remains to be addressed what causes CD147 upregulation in COVID-19 and how the
MNP system may participate in dysregulated coagulation, but it has previously been shown that
CD147 support platelet-monocyte interactions promoting vascular inflammation51. In addition,

CD147 is upregulated upon TNF and IFN-γ stimulation, an effect strongly potentiated by
bacterial stimuli52. Of note, the two pulmonary embolism cases in our cohort occurred in severe
COVID-19 patients suffering from superinfection with positive blood cultures.

In summary, we here provide a comprehensive mapping of the MNP landscape in COVID-19.
Lineage restricted changes were observed with loss of the inhibitory receptor CD200R in
cDC2s, including the progenitors, associated with severe disease and fatal outcome as well as
expansion of immature Mo-MDSC-like monocytes in critically ill. These findings suggest
dysregulation of myeloid development in severe COVID-19, involving both monocyte and DC
lineages, and changes detected in circulation were mirrored in lung tissue. Unsupervised
analysis revealed that MNPs, alone, could identify a cluster with non-survivors. Further
research is warranted to understand if and how immature myeloid derived cells in COVID-19
contribute to perpetuation and silencing of the inflammatory storm, and how the altered MNP
development affects monocyte and DC ability to contribute to viral clearance. The new
knowledge gained from investigating MNP biology provides a framework that has the potential
to influence vaccine development, where accurate MNP host response are needed, and
improvement of treatment strategies aiming at controlling the proinflammatory storm without
affecting the immune system’s ability to clear the virus.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient and healthy control cohorts
COVID-19 patients were recruited at the Karolinska University Hospital Stockholm. All
patients were SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive in nasopharynx or sputum, had clinical COVID-19
disease, and were sampled within 8 days from hospitalization. Moderate COVID-19 patients
and an oxygen saturation (SO2) between 90-94% or had a 0.5-3 L/min oxygen requirement at
screening. Severe COVID-19 patients were treated at the intensive care unit or a high
dependency unit. Patients with an ongoing malignancy or ongoing immune suppressive
medication prior to hospitalization were excluded from the study. The patients were further
described by Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score 53 and the National Institute
of Health (NIH) ordinal scale

54

. The NIH ordinal scale scores are as follows: 1, not

hospitalized, no limitations; 2, not hospitalized, with limitations; 3, hospitalized, no active
medical problems; 4, hospitalized not on oxygen but requiring ongoing medical care; 5,
hospitalized, on oxygen; 6, hospitalized, on high flow oxygen or non-invasive mechanical
ventilation; 7, hospitalized, on mechanical ventilation or ECMO; 8, death. In addition, a group
of healthy volunteers matched for age and sex, no history of COVID-19 disease, no signs or
symptoms of ongoing COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 IgG seronegative, was recruited in
parallel as a control group. The research was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review
Authority.

Serology
SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers were measured at the day of sampling in serum in all the patients and
controls according to the routinely used clinical pipeline at the Clinical Microbiology
Department, Karolinska University Hospital; and finally interpreted by a clinical microbiologist
as positive or negative, according to clinical practice.

Viral titers
Viral load was assessed at the day of sampling as serum SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity,
examined in serum from all the patients following the pipeline at the Clinical Microbiology
Department, Karolinska University Hospital. Briefly, two independent tests were used and
finally interpreted by a clinical microbiologist as positive or negative, according to the clinical
routine.

Trucount staining
In order to determine the absolute leucocyte numbers, trucount staining was performed. Briefly,
50 µl EDTA blood and 20 µl of antibody mix (6-color TBNK Reagent and CD123 BUV395
from BD, CD15 PB, CD193 BV605 and HLA-DR BV785 from Biolegend and CD14 PE-Cy5
from eBioscience) were added in BD trucount tubes and incubated for 15 min at room
temperature in the dark. The samples were then fixed using 430 µl 1X BD FACS lysing solution
(BD Biosciences).

Sample processing and flow cytometry
PBMCs were isolated from patient and control blood samples after Ficoll separation using
Lymphoprep (Stemcell Technologies) and FACS staining was performed on freshly isolated
cells in three independent experiments during three subsequent weeks to minimize batch
effects. To assess batch related effects, internal control of frozen healthy PBMCs were used in
all experiments and revealed minimal variability. Briefly, PBMCs were resuspended in PBS
containing 2% FCS and 2 mM EDTA and a mixture of antibodies, supplemented with BD
Horizon Brilliant Stain Buffer Plus (BD Biosciences) at 1:5 and FcR Blocking Reagent
(Miltenyi Biotec) at 1:25 and were incubated for 30 min. Next, cells were washed twice and

fixed in PBS containing 1% PFA for 2 hours in order to inactivate the virus. Cells were acquired
on a FACSymphony A5 instrument (BD Biosciences), equipped with UV (355nm), violet (405
nm), blue (488 nm), yellow/green (561 nm), and red laser (637 nm). Details of antibodies used
as well as information on filters for cytometer configuration are provided in Table 2.

Flow cytometry analysis
Acquired data was analyzed using DIVA (BD Biosciences), FlowJo v.10.5.3 (BD Biosciences)
and Prism v.8.0.2 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Absolute numbers of MNPs were determined
relating to CD14+ cells in the trucount staining. Algorithms used for dimensionality reduction
were UMAP (Becht et al., Nature Biotechnology, 2018; https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap) and
Phenograph (Levine et al., Cell, 2015; https://github.com/JinmiaoChenLab/ Rphenograph).

Soluble factor analysis
Serum levels of soluble factors were analyzed at the day of the sampling using proximity
extension assay, based on real-time PCR quantification of pair-wise binding of oligonucleotidelabeled target antibodies (Olink Proteomics, Uppsala, Sweden; sensitivity, specificity, dynamic
range, repeatability, reproducibility and scalability validation documents are available at
www.olink.com/downloads).

Single cell analysis
Seurat version 3 was used to re-analyze single cell data. In brief, scRNA-seq from previously
published report22 was used and 10X Genomics filtered_feature_bc_matrix files were acquired
from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; accession number GSE145926). QC such as gene
number between 200 and 6000, UMI count above 1000 and mitochondrial gene percentage
below 0.1 were applied, and ‘LogNormalize’ method in Seurat V3 was used to normalize the

data matrix followed by PCA using top 2000 most variable genes. Top 50 principal components
were used to visualize the cells in UMAP, and ‘bimod’ test was used to detect differentially
expressed genes. First, we selected myeloid DC clusters 22, 25, 27 (CLEC9A, CADM1, CD1c,
FCER1A), pDC cluster 28 (LILRA4, IL3RA), and other myeloid clusters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 21, 23, 29 (CD14, CD68), after exclusion of B cells, plasma cells, epithelium,
NK cells, and T cells (Supp. Fig. 1A-F). After re-running total myeloid cells through the
dimensionality reduction pipeline (Supp. Fig. 1G-K), neutrophils were excluded (Supp. Fig.
1F, G). To identify DCs, DC-containing clusters 11, 27, and 29 from the myeloid cell UMAP
were re-clustered (Supp. 1L-P). As cluster 4 contained a comparable number of cells in severe
and moderate cohorts, and cluster 7 in severe and healthy, the DEGs in those clusters were
calculated between the severe patients and the respective cohort and subjected to pathway
analysis. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was performed to study pathways (Content version:
51963813; Release Date: 2020-03-11; Ingenuity Systems). Predicted upregulation and
downregulation of pathways was based on Z-score, where positive score implied upregulation
and negative score implied downregulation.

PCA and correlation plots
PCA plots were created using ‘prcomp’ function and ‘ggbiplot’ package in R and correlation
mapping was performed using ‘corrplot’ package in R. The color of the circles indicated
positive (red) and negative (blue) correlations, color intensity represented correlation strength
as measured by the Pearson’s correlation coefficient. The correlation matrix was reordered
using “hclust” for hierarchical clustering order. Significance tests were performed to produce
p-values and confidence intervals for each pair of input features.

Statistical analysis
Differences between two groups were evaluated using Mann-Whitney test, and Kruskal-Wallis
test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test were used to evaluate differences among the three
groups in all the analysis. Friedman test was used in Fig. 2E to evaluate differences among
paired variables. Spearman test was used for correlations of non-normally distributed data and
Pearson test was used for normally distributed data. Significance for pathways analyses in Fig.
3E, 3H was defined by the IPA software (Ingenuity Systems). Significance level: *p<0.05,
**p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001.

FIGURE 6: Summary of MNP response to SARS-CoV-2 and in relation to COVID-19
disease severity.
Monocytes (left side) and dendritic cells (right side), respond to SARS-CoV-2 (upper panel)
with decreased circulating levels of all DC subsets, but higher CD5+ DC2 frequency,
activated phenotype (upregulation of ecto-enzyme CD38, expansion of CD14+CD16+
iMonos, decrease of CD14lowCD16++ ncMonos, and lower CD45RA levels on pDCs), and
features pointing to viral sensing and type I IFN imprint found in DC1s (e.g. lower levels
of c-KIT, expansion of AXL+DC1s). Severe COVID-19 (lower panel) is associated with
altered developmental DC phenotype (e.g. increased frequencies of late pre-DC2
progenitors and increased stem cell marker c-KIT expression in pre-DCs, as well as
immature phenotype on all DC subsets with lower HLA-DR and CD86), expansion of MoMDSC-like cells and decrease in inhibitory receptor CD200R, specific to cDC2 lineage.
Arrows in red boxes indicate changes in counts and frequencies of cell populations. Arrows
in green areas illustrate altered expression of receptors within indicated populations.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL AND METHODS
Detailed cohort description
To address general features of the clinical biomarker pattern of COVID-19 we investigated
parameters measured in the clinic as a part of routine monitoring, including inflammatory,
hematological, biochemical and coagulation related parameters, and compared them between
the two cohorts of COVID-19 patients, reference values indicated in grey (Figure 6A). As
expected, almost all patients had elevated levels of almost all inflammatory parameters
previously associated with COVID-19, such as CRP, ferritin, as well as the cytokine levels (IL10, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF), and differences in IL-6 levels was detected between the two study
cohorts with higher levels in the critically ill patients. Coagulation parameters were also
affected, and higher levels of D-dimer were detected in the severe patients, who also had
elevated levels of fibrinogen (85%, 11/13). Biochemical status revealed higher levels of lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) and myoglobin in critically ill patients and hypoalbuminemia in all, with
lower levels in severe disease. From the hematological perspective, severe patients had higher
levels of WBC, higher neutrophil counts, lower lymphocytes and subsequently higher
neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, with no striking differences in platelets or monocytes (Figure
6A). Radiologically, all patients examined showed bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray;
therapeutically, the majority received anticoagulants (93%, 25/27) and more than half broadspectrum antibiotics (56%, 15/27). From a HLH perspective, all patients had fever at admission
(100%, 27/27) and elevated ferritin levels (100%, 26/26, data not available for 1 patient), but
no suspicion from the hematological parameters available, and in line rather elevated than low
fibrinogen levels. Four patients in the severe group had superinfections (24% of severe patients,
4/17), in two of whom pulmonary embolism was detected, representing all detected cases of
pulmonary embolism. To further address clinical laboratory status in relation to each other
clinical parameters and outcome, integrative correlation mapping was performed (Figure 6B).

This showed cytokines (IL-10, TNF, IL-6), LDH, neutrophil and D-dimer levels clustering
together with fatal outcome, peak oxygen need and viremia. Of note, levels of monocytes
showed a positive correlation with body mass index (BMI), a known COVID-19 risk factor,
and monocytes were the only clinically available cell type correlating with days from symptom
debut, indicating the myeloid mononuclear cell importance in disease development timeline.
We also investigated symptom panorama at admission, and found that in addition to fever, all
patients had dyspnea (100%, 27/27), most had cough (85%, 23/27), few had GI related
symptoms (15%, 4/27), while body ache showed higher variation (44%, 12/27), and correlated
with thromboembolism, days since symptom debut and, intriguingly, levels of monocytes
(Figure 6B). Importantly, a similar pattern was observed when integrative correlation mapping
was performed including clinical parameters available 24 hours within MNP profiling
(Supplementary Figure 4A). Further details on clinical and laboratory findings are presented in
Supplementary Table 1 and 2.

(A) Analytic pipeline of sc-RNAseq data. (B) After quality control, scRNA-seq data reanalyzed using the Seurat version 3 (V3). (C) Expression plots of key markers used to
discriminate between cells to be included and excluded in subsequent analysis. (D)
Distribution of cells from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls among clusters
generated in the whole data set. (E) Distribution of cells from moderate and severe COVID19 patients and healthy controls among clusters generated in the whole data set.
(F)Distribution of cells from each sample among clusters generated in the whole data set.
(G) Selected myeloid cell clusters re-analyzed. (H) Expression plots of key markers used to
discriminate between MNP and neutrophil clusters. (I) Distribution of cells from COVID19 patients and healthy controls in MNP clusters. (J) Distribution of cells from moderate
and severe COVID-19 patients and healthy controls in MNP clusters. (K) Distribution of
cells from each sample in MNP clusters. (L) Clusters containing DCs selected and reanalyzed. (M) Distribution of cells from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls in DC
clusters. (N) Distribution of cells from moderate and severe COVID-19 patients and healthy
controls in DC clusters. (O) Distribution of cells from each sample in DC clusters. (P) Key
genes of pDC and DC1 in cluster 4 (green) and 7 (red), respectively. (Q) Genes in pDCs
differentially expressed between severe and moderate COVID-19 patients, presented in the
three cohorts. (R) Genes in DC1s differentially expressed between severe COVID-19 and
healthy controls, presented in the three cohorts. Statistical evaluation using ‘bimod’ test for
differentially expressed genes.

(A) Integrated correlation clustering of clinical parameters with CRP, procalcitonin,
hemoglobin, WBC, lymphocytes, neutrophils, ferritin, troponin, D-dimer, PK-INR,
fibrinogen, creatinine, bilirubin, and albumin taken within 24 hours from the MNP
profiling; the color of the circles indicated positive (red) and negative (blue) correlations,
color intensity represented correlation strength as measured by the Pearson’s correlation
coefficient. (B) Differences in absolute numbers of MNP populations between SARS-CoV2 PCR+ and SARS-CoV-2 PCR- patients, and between SARS-CoV-2 IgG- and SARSCoV-2 IgG+ patients. (C) Correlation of days since symptom debut until the sample
collection and absolute numbers of cells within MNP populations. (D) Principal component
analysis of 108 MNP parameters in the three cohorts, parameters contributing most to the
separation highlighted; each dot represents controls (white), moderate COVID-19 (light
green), and severe COVID-19 (dark green) patient; to better visualize marker names, a plot
with smaller dots is provided (right). (E) Differences in LD, D-dimer, Ferritin,
neutrophils/lymphocyte ratio at peak or 24h within MNP profiling (lower row) between
patient cluster 2 and 3. (F) Differences in CD200R MFI between survivors and nonsurvivors in all patients (left) and in severe patients only (right). Statistical evaluation using
Mann-Whitney for comparison between the two groups, Spearman test for correlations of
non-normally distributed data and Pearson test for correlations of normally distributed data.
Significance level: *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001.
