Research in context
Evidence before this study
There have been reported increases in mental health problems during the outbreak of the
COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is unclear whether changes in mental health problems
have been symptom specific, how changes have differed across populations and whether
increased mental health problems have persisted over time. We systematically reviewed and
meta-analysed longitudinal cohort studies that examined mental health among the same
participants prior to and during the pandemic in 2020. This approach allowed us to quantify
the mental health burden associated with the outbreak of the pandemic and how it has
changed over time. We searched Pubmed, SCOPUS, Web of Science and PsychInfo from
January 2020 to January 11, 2021 and identified eligible unpublished articles available on
pre-print servers.

Added value of this study
We identified 65 eligible articles that reported 201 comparisons of mental health pre vs. post
pandemic outbreak. Meta-analysis indicated that longitudinal cohort studies that examined
mental health prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 showed a significant but
statistically small increase in mental health symptoms. The overall increase in mental health
symptoms was most pronounced during the early stages of the pandemic (March-April),
before decreasing and being generally comparable to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2020.
Compared to anxiety and general measures of mental health functioning, increases tended to
be larger in depressive symptoms and although statistically small, remained elevated past the
early stages of the pandemic. Increases in mental health symptoms were observed across
most population sub-groups, but there was no evidence of a change in mental health
symptoms among samples of participants with a pre-existing mental health condition.

Implications of all the available evidence
Findings confirm that the initial outbreak of the pandemic was associated with a significant
but statistically small increase in mental health symptoms. Given that small effects may have
meaningful cumulative consequences at the population level, there is a need for continued
mental health provision and monitoring particularly during periods of the pandemic when
infection rates and deaths are high. Further into the pandemic, mental health problems
decreased significantly, which indicated recovery and resilience in overall mental health.
Contrary to predictions made early in the pandemic, there was also no evidence of a
worsening of mental health symptoms among samples of participants with a pre-existing
mental health condition. Overall the results of the present analyses suggest that the pandemic
may not have caused an unprecedented and long lasting mental health crisis, instead there
appears to have been resilience in mental health.

Abstract
Background: Increases in mental health problems have been observed in some studies during
the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear whether changes have been large and experienced by
most population sub-groups, persisted over time or been symptom specific.
Methods: We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed longitudinal cohort studies that
examined changes in mental health among the same group of participants before and during
the pandemic (PROSPERO: CRD42021231256). Searches for published and unpublished
studies were conducted in January 2021. Changes in mental health (standardised mean
change; SMC) were examined using meta-analyses.
Findings: Sixty-five studies were included. There was an overall increase in mental health
symptoms that was most pronounced during March-April 2020 (SMC = .102 [95% CI: .026
to .192], p = 0.03) before significantly declining over time (May-July SMC = .067 [95% CI: .022 to .157], p = .141). Compared to measures of anxiety (SMC = 0.13, p = 0.02) and
general mental health (SMC = -.03, p = 0.65), increases in depression and mood disorder
symptoms tended to be larger (SMC = 0.22, p < .001) and reductions over time appeared less
pronounced. Increased mental health symptoms were observed across most population
subgroups examined but there was no evidence of any change in symptoms among samples
with a pre-existing mental health condition.
Interpretation: There was a small increase in mental health symptoms soon after the
outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic that decreased and was comparable to pre-pandemic
levels by mid-2020 among most population sub-groups and symptom types.

Introduction
As of February 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has been responsible for more than 2.5
million deaths worldwide (1). Soon after the COVID-19 crisis was declared a pandemic by
the World Health Organisation (WHO) on the 11th March, concerns were raised over a
potential parallel mental health crisis fuelled by the pandemic and the associated social
restrictions imposed by governments to reduce virus transmission (2, 3). The mental health of
‘at risk’ groups during the pandemic, such as those with pre-existing mental health
conditions, has also been highlighted as cause for concern (3, 4).
There are considerable methodological challenges to quantifying the impact that the
pandemic has had on mental health. During the outbreak of the pandemic studies indicated
that many participants perceived their mental health had worsened (5, 6), but retrospective
reports of change in mental health are prone to substantial bias (7, 8). Other studies have
found a greater incidence of mental health problems in cohorts recruited during the pandemic
compared to different cohorts who completed measures prior to the pandemic (9, 10).
However, differences in how samples were recruited (e.g. greater reliance of online and nonprobability based samples during the pandemic) and differences in demographic profiles of
pre vs. post-pandemic outbreak cohorts also make inferring change in mental health
attributable to the pandemic difficult (11).
A number of longitudinal cohort studies have sampled the same participants before
and during the pandemic to examine how mental health has changed. In a large nationally
representative sample of UK adults, Daly et al. found that non-specific general mental health
symptoms (GHQ-12) increased in April-June 2020 compared to a pre-pandemic baseline
(12). Other longitudinal cohort studies have found little change in mental health (13) or
mixed evidence (14). Longitudinal studies are uniquely placed to characterise the time course
of the mental health burden associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the effects of

the pandemic on mental health could be long lasting (15), a recent multi-wave longitudinal
study of US adults found that after an initial increase in distress during the early stages of the
pandemic, distress reduced to pre-pandemic levels within a few months (16).
There has been no systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal cohort studies
with pre-pandemic measurement of mental health (17-19). We systematically reviewed and
meta-analysed studies that examined longitudinal changes in mental health among the same
sample of participants before vs. during the pandemic, in order to quantify the size of the
mental health burden associated with the pandemic and how this burden changed over time.
Secondary aims were to examine whether changes have been symptom specific and whether
changes differed based on population demographics.

Methods
Eligibility Criteria
Participants. To be eligible, studies were required to have sampled the same cohort of
participants prior to 11/03/20 (date the WHO declared a pandemic) (20) and at least once
after this date. Chinese studies were eligible (but analysed separately) if mental health was
assessed prior to and after 23/01/20 because substantial social restriction measures were
enforced across China from this point (21). There were no limits on populations sampled.
Measures of interest. To be eligible, studies were required to have collected data using a
validated multi-item measure of mental health symptoms or mental well-being, such as
depression (e.g. Patient Health Questionnaire: PHQ9), anxiety (Depression, Anxiety, Stress
Scale: DASS), non-specific general mental health related functioning and distress (General
Health Questionnaire: GHQ12, Kessler) and well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental
Wellbeing Scale). As our focus was on mental health symptoms, ineligible measures included
loneliness, stress and physical health related quality of life.

Outcome. Studies that examined continuous changes (i.e. standardised mean change; SMC) in
mental health symptoms were eligible, as was change in the % of the sample meeting
questionnaire specific cut-offs for clinically relevant/likely serious mental health problems
were eligible (i.e. Odds Ratio).
Study design features. Studies were required to sample the same participants using the same
measure of mental health pre and post-pandemic (repeated cross-sectional studies were not
eligible). If only a sub-sample of participants were followed up across survey waves, only
data from the sub-sample were eligible. Interventions to improve mental health during the
pandemic were not eligible. If multiple articles reported on data from the same cohort of
participants, the article with the largest number of post-pandemic follow-up data collection
points was included. Journal articles and pre-prints were eligible.

Article Identification
We searched Pubmed, SCOPUS, Web of Science and PsychInfo from January 2020 to
January 11, 2021, using combinations of coronavirus and mental health relevant search terms
(see online supplementary materials). One author conducted title and abstract screening and
25% were cross-checked by a second author (no discrepancies). Two authors conducted fulltext screening and disagreements in eligibility were resolved by discussion. We searched
three databases for unpublished pre-prints; Open Science Framework (inclusive of 30
preprint archives, e.g. PsychArxiv), MedrXiv and the Social Science Research Network, and
conducted forward citation tracking (Google Scholar) for all eligible articles. A single author
conducted pre-print searches and forward citation tracking; a second author verified
eligibility of identified articles.

Data Extraction
The following information was extracted by a single author and checked for accuracy by a
second author; country of study, participant group sampled, age group of sample, sampling
strategy used (e.g. use of representative sampling vs. convenience), pre and post pandemic
dates of data collection, mental health measure, analytic treatment of mental health
symptomology change (e.g. use of change in % meeting questionnaire cut-off vs. continuous
change in questionnaire score), level of attrition (%), effect size information (authors were
contacted if information was missing) and whether the study was reported in a journal article
or pre-print.

Risk of Bias
We reviewed methodological quality scales and risk of bias measures to develop a list of bias
indicators relevant to included studies. See online supplementary materials for full detail
(including justifications for each indicator). Indicators were rated by two authors; i) whether
the study reported representative sampling (yes = lower in risk of bias), ii) whether the study
underwent peer review (yes = lower in risk of bias), iii) low level of attrition unlikely to
affect results (yes = lower in risk of bias), iv) whether the study had a relatively large
(N≥1000) sample size (yes = lower in risk of bias), v) whether the pre-pandemic measure of
mental health was collected within the last year of the post-pandemic outbreak measure (yes
= lower in risk of bias), vi), whether survey delivery mode (e.g. online) was consistent across
pre and post outbreak waves of data collection (yes = lower in risk of bias), vii) whether
conflicts of interest were reported (no conflicts = lower in risk of bias).

National COVID-19 data
To examine if heterogeneity of change in mental health was attributable to country level
factors, for each eligible study, we identified the number of recorded COVID cases and
deaths (by country) per million population for the month that mental health was measured
during the pandemic. We also used data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response
Tracker to characterise each country’s severity of social restrictions, number of health
measures and level of economic support in place during the month post-pandemic outbreak
mental health was assessed. See supplementary materials for full information.

Analyses
For our main analysis on continuous data, we computed standardised mean change (SMC) in
pooled SD units For analyses examining questionnaire cut-off data we computed Marginal
Odds Ratios to quantify size of change. See online supplementary materials for full statistical
information. As studies contributed multiple comparisons to analyses, we conducted a multilevel meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistic. We examined whether time
(month post-pandemic outbreak measure was collected) predicted change in mental health
symptoms using meta-regression. We also conducted sub-group analyses on symptom type
(depression, anxiety, general mental health functioning (including distress), well-being,
psychotic symptoms, other), gender, age (adult vs. child/adolescent), population sampled
(general population, university students, mental and physical health conditions) and continent
sample was from. A minimum of n=5 effects for each sub-group was required for analysis.
All analyses were conducted in R. To address influential cases we conducted leave one-outanalyses and computed DFBETAS values for each effect size in the full models (without
moderators). Funnel plots were inspected for potential publication bias, Egger’s test of

Results
Article identification. After removal of duplicates, title and abstract screening of electronic
database search results and identification of eligible articles through other sources, 153
articles were full-text screened. A total of 65 articles were eligible for inclusion. See Figure 1
for study selection flow chart.

Overview of studies and eligible effects. The 65 articles reported on a total of 201 pre vs.
during pandemic mental health comparisons to include in the meta-analyses. The majority of
studies sampled European (N=31) or North American (N=16) populations. The majority of
comparisons (n=177) examined pre vs. post pandemic outbreak change in overall mental
health as a continuous variable (i.e. change in mean questionnaire score) and n=24 examined
change in % of sample meeting questionnaire cut-offs for clinically relevant symptomology.
See Table S1 in the supplementary materials for individual study information.

Overall change in mental health symptoms (SMC). There were 177 pre vs. post pandemic
comparisons across 61 studies. Twelve comparisons (4 studies) came from Chinese samples,
which left a total of 165 comparisons included in the main analysis. Sample sizes of
comparisons ranged from n=9 to 11,599. Depression and mood disorder symptoms (n=58),
anxiety disorder symptoms (n=52) and general non-specific mental health symptoms (n=35)
were the most common symptoms studied. From the 165 comparisons drawn from ~55,015
participants, overall change in mental health symptoms from pre-post pandemic outbreak was
significant (SMC = .106 [95% CI: .039 to .172], z = 3.12, p = .002, I2 = 97.8) and indicative
of heterogeneous and small increase in symptoms (SMC=0.2 is indicative of a small effect).
There were no influential cases, and although there was some evidence of funnel plot
asymmetry, Trim and Fill did not impute any studies (see online supplementary materials).

For studies in China (~ 1,854 participants), change in mental health symptoms was indicative
of a small, non-significant increase in symptoms (SMC = .194 [95% CI: -.576 to .964], z =
0.49, p = .622].

Symptom-level analyses. We examined whether SMC in mental health symptoms was
moderated by symptom type. The test of moderation was significant (QM(5) = 19.71, p <
.001). There was a significant increase in symptoms of anxiety (SMC = .125 [95% CI: .019 to
.230], z = 2.31, p = .021) and depression (SMC = .216 [95% CI: .135 to .296], z = 5.24, p <
.001), with the increase in depression larger than anxiety (p = .049). There was a significant
decrease in symptoms of psychosis (SMC = -.211 [95% CI: -.376 to -.046], z = 2.51, p =
.012).1 There was no significant change in measures of general mental health (SMD = -.030
[95%CI -.158 to .098], z = 0.457, p = .648), well-being (SMC = .067 [95% CI: -.123 to .256],
z = .690, p = .490) or for the mixed ‘other’ conditions sub-group (SMC = -.041 [95% CI: .203 to .121], z = 0.501, p = .616). See online supplementary materials figures S2-S7 for
symptom level forest plots.

Time analyses. Change in symptoms from pre-pandemic levels became smaller over each
month (monthly change coefficient = -.057 [95%CI: -.100 to -.013], z = 2.57, p = .010). To
illustrate, among post-pandemic measures of mental health collected in March and April (n =
98) the change in mental health was statistically small and significant; SMC = .102 [95% CI:
.026 to .192] z = 2.22, p = .026). Conversely, for measures collected during May-July (n =
67) there was no significant change compared to pre-pandemic mental health symptoms;
SMC = .067 [95% CI: -.022 to .157], z = 1.47, p = .141). There was no robust interaction
between symptom types and time. See Table 1 for SMCs for each symptom type by time.

Sub-group analyses. Across sub-groups, we found no evidence that change in mental health
symptoms differed based on age, gender, or study continent. See Table 2. Change in

Multi-level models remained a better fit of the data separately for anxiety, depression and general mental
health measures, but not for psychosis, well-being or other symptoms which is likely due to smaller number of
effect sizes. Regardless, treating the data as single or multilevel in these cases did not substantially influence the
effect sizes or statistical significance of the models.

symptoms tended to be larger among participants with a pre-existing physical health
condition compared to the general population. Notably, change in mental health symptoms
was non-significant in samples with pre-existing mental health conditions. No country-level
data (number of COVID cases/deaths, stringency of government measures or level) explained
heterogeneity between samples (ps > .05). See online supplementary materials for full results.

Risk of bias. Due to the small number of studies examining changes in % of sample meeting
questionnaire cut-offs, risk of bias analyses were limited to SMC studies. See Table 2 for risk
of bias summary information and results and Table S2 for study-level information. We found
limited evidence that the risk of bias indicators predicted size of change in symptoms, except
that change in mental health tended to be larger when delivery mode of questionnaire was
consistent pre vs. post pandemic. In an exploratory analysis limited to a more homogenous
collection of studies that were of lower risk of bias results were consistent with the main
analyses. See Figure 2.

Change in numbers exceeding questionnaire cut-offs for mental health problems. Twentyfour comparisons across 12 studies (~21,825 participants) were included. There was a

Ratio = 1.31 [95% CI: 1.10 to 1.55], z = 3.18, p = .001, I2 = 93.2%), where an OR of 1.5 is
tconsidered a small sized effect. See Figure 3. There was no evidence of publication bias or
influential cases. See online supplementary materials for full results.

General Discussion
Across sixty-five longitudinal cohort studies comparing mental health prior to and during the
COVID-19 pandemic there was a statistically small overall increase in mental health
symptoms. The increase in mental health symptoms was largest among studies that sampled
participants in the early stages of the pandemic (March-April) and severity of mental health
symptoms decreased significantly over the following months (May-July). This pattern of
results may represent an acute and normal response to an unforeseen and distressing
traumatic event (22), which was then followed by a period of psychological adaptation and
resilience (16, 23). In line with this interpretation, a large study of US adults found that

perceived risk and worries about financial instability, infection and death were highest during
the early stages of the pandemic(24). However, as more information about the pandemic
became available perceived risks decreased and this predicted recovery to pre-pandemic
levels of distress (24). Similarly, in a large sample of UK adults recruited after the pandemic
outbreak, both anxiety and depressive symptoms showed a trajectory of recovery from the
beginning of April onwards (25).
Worsening of mental health symptoms was largest in studies examining depression
and mood disorders symptoms, and a small increase in depression symptoms was still
observed during May-June. Change in anxiety symptoms was smaller and was not significant
in samples measured in May-June. Changes in non-specific general mental health functioning
(including distress) and well-being were small and non-significant. The more pronounced
change in depressive symptoms observed may reflect the effects of isolation and sadness
caused by social restrictions and loss of life during the pandemic (26). Increases in mental
health problems were observed across most population sub-groups sampled (e.g. general
population, university students, existing physical health condition).
Contrary to concerns raised early in the pandemic (3, 4), changes in mental health
were less pronounced among people with pre-existing mental health conditions and overall
there was no statistically significant change in mental symptoms in this group. These findings
may in part be explained by regression to the mean and naturally occurring recovery of more
severe mental health symptoms over time (27), as well as stay at home restrictions that
potentially provided a more structured routine and reduced exposure to external stressors (e.g.
large social gatherings) among those with severe mental health conditions (22). A number of
countries, such as China, introduced new mental health services in response to the pandemic
(4) and this may have relieved symptoms among those with and without pre-existing mental
health conditions. In contrast, mental health symptoms increased among those with pre-

17
existing physical health conditions, which may reflect the elevated risk posed by COVID-19
to this group.
Increases in mental health symptoms were observed in both North American and
European samples, though there were a limited number of studies from other continents. We
examined whether a range of country-level factors explained heterogeneity in mental health
change across samples, including number of country level COVID-19 cases and attributed
deaths in the month that mental health was measured, levels of government financial support
and social restrictions in place to reduce virus transmission. We found no evidence that
country level factors explained heterogeneity. However, it is difficult to make firm
conclusions because the majority of studies were conducted in the early phase of the
pandemic when deaths from COVID-19 were high and restrictive measures had already
introduced relatively high levels of restriction. A number of countries also implemented
restrictions regionally.
A smaller sub-set of studies examined change in proportion of sampled population
exceeding questionnaire cut-offs for clinically relevant mental health symptoms. In line with
the main analyses, there was a statistically small increase in likelihood of meeting
questionnaire cut-offs. A limitation of these studies is that although questionnaires used have
been shown to be valid indicators of clinically relevant mental health disorder
symptomology, it was common for response formats to be altered to ask participants to report
on shorter time frames (e.g. the last week). Therefore, these studies provide an indication of
acute symptom severity rather than clinical diagnostic value (e.g. anxiety disorder diagnosis
typically requires symptoms for several months (28)).
In contrast to the fear that the COVID-19 pandemic would cause a parallel and
longstanding mental health crisis (2, 3), the present findings suggest that overall there has

there have been stable rates or decreases reported across a number of countries (29).
However, there is a need for continued mental health provision and monitoring particularly
during periods of increased COVID-19 infection and death. The increase in depression and
mood disorder symptoms that did not return to pre-pandemic levels warrants attention, as
even a small upward shift in depressive symptoms may have meaningful cumulative
consequences on the population-level.
There are limitations to the studies included. The majority of studies sampled
populations in developed countries during the early stages of the pandemic. Given that there
have been second waves of the pandemic in many countries during early 2021, it will be
important to continue to monitor mental health. Heterogeneity of models ended to be high
and although some of this variability was explained by symptom type and population groups
sampled, it will be important to identify further explanatory factors. For example, there are
population sub-groups who may be at greater risk of declines in mental health that we were
unable to examine and who are likely to be under-represented in studies of the general
population. Due to stressful working conditions frontline healthcare workers may be at
increased risk and there may be long-term mental health effects among those who become
seriously ill from COVID-19, live in nursing homes or those who suffered financially as a
result of the pandemic (30). Participants with pre-existing mental health conditions tended to
be grouped in studies and therefore we were unable to examine changes in symptoms among
specific patient groups (e.g. schizophrenia). We found little evidence that study outcomes
were strongly related to individual risk of bias indicators and in an analysis limited to
relatively high-quality studies results were similar to the main analyses. Level of attrition was
high across studies and this is a limitation. Although there was no significant evidence of
attrition being associated with change in symptoms in meta-regression or sub-group analyses

and lower levels of attrition tended to be associated with a smaller as opposed to larger
increase in symptoms.

Conclusions
Among longitudinal cohort studies examining mental health prior to and during the COVID19 pandemic in 2020 there was a significant but statistically small increase in mental health
symptoms. Increases were larger for depressive symptoms compared to anxiety and measures
of overall mental health functioning. The overall increase in mental health symptoms was
most pronounced during the first two months of the pandemic, before decreasing and being
comparable to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2020. There was no evidence of a worsening of
mental health symptoms among samples of participants with a pre-existing mental health
condition.

n = equals number of comparisons. Cells with - are indicative of insufficient effect sizes for individual analyses. Depression and mood disorder symptoms
included depressive symptoms and emotional problems. General (non-specific) mental health measures included mental health related-quality of life, distress,
internalizing symptoms. Psychotic symptoms included measures of psychoticism and paranoia. Well-being included measures of overall psychological wellbeing. Other disorder specific symptoms included eating disorder symptomology, post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, suicidal ideation. For all measures
included by symptom type see Table S1.

Number of comparisons does not add up to n=165 because for a small number of effects it was unclear whether the pre-pandemic measures was collected
more than 12 months prior to the post-pandemic outbreak measure.

We also examined whether attrition was associated with the change in mental health symptoms pre-post pandemic using meta-regression. There was no
significant association (coefficient = .092 [95% CI: -.185 to .370] z = .653, p =.514).
