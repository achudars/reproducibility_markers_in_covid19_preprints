Abstract:
Objectives: The aim of this study is to depict the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on the
clinical services and academic activities in the department of stomatology of a tertiary
hospitals in Wuhan, China.
Methods: We obtained historical data of the Department of Stomatology from the Health
Information System of the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, Wuhan, China
between January 2018 and June 2020. Line plots were used to illustrate temporal trend of the
variables. Mean ± standard deviation and median with interquartile range were used to
summarize the variables. The Kruskal-Wallis equality-of-populations rank test was used to
compare the difference between groups.

Results: A significant decrease was noted in the monthly average number of patients seeking
the outpatient services for the year 2020. The monthly numbers of patients seeking outpatient
services were decreased by two thirds from 2018 to 2020. The number of emergency cases
also decreased significantly by 64% in 2020. The monthly number of teaching hours
decreased from 3.8 ± 1.5 in 2018 and 4.7 ± 1.4 in 2019 to 1.7 ± 1.9 in 2020. The number of
interns also decreased more than 70% in 2020.
Conclusions: The impacts of COVID 19 in the stomatology clinic were significant with
notable decreases in clinical services and education offered to the stomatology students. We
must find solutions to keep as many as needed dental profession stay on thriving and to
remain on the frontline of healthcare.

1. Introduction
As a public health emergency of international concern, the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in over 23 million confirmed cases and 809
thousand deaths worldwide by August 23, 2020.[1, 2] According to the current evidence,
COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and
person-to-person contact routes.[3, 4] Dental patients who cough, sneeze, or receive dental
treatment including the use of a high-speed handpiece or ultrasonic instruments make their
secretions, saliva, or blood aerosolize to the surroundings.[5] Due to the characteristics of
dental settings, the risk of cross infection may be high between dental practitioners and
patients, and dental practitioners are at high risk of acquiring an infection while treating
patients.[6] The impact of coronavirus on the dental community is eminent, the big challenge
is how we can offer dental treatment despite the outbreak.[6, 7] Dental education programs
and academic activities will also suffer from the ramifications of the pandemic.
The General Hospital of the Central Theater Command is a teaching hospital and one of the
largest tertiary hospitals in Wuhan, where the COVID-19 epidemic broke in China. There are
a total of 60 personnel in the Department of Stomatology of the hospital, including 34
stomatologists, 22 nurses, and 4 technicians. Fortunately, there were no personnel infected by
COVID-19 during the epidemic in Wuhan because they strictly followed the Protocol for
Prevention and Control of COVID-19 of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and
Prevention throughout the epidemic.[8, 9] On 23 January 2020, the central government of
China imposed a lockdown in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province. Wuhan has been
gradually reopened since April 1, 2020.[10]
The aim of this study was to depict the impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic on the clinical
practices and academic activities of the department during January to June, 2020.

2. Materials and methods
We obtained historical data of the department from the Health Information System of the
General Hospital of the Central Theater Command, Wuhan, China. The data were in monthly
statistics and grouped into three broad categories (clinical services, education and academic
activities/communication) between January 2018 and June 2020 to determine the impacts of
COVID-19 on the department. Variables under clinical services included number of
outpatient cases, emergency cases, operation cases, hospitalization and discharge of patients;
numbers of interns and teaching hours were variables under education, while number of
people attending scientific conference, lectures given by the personnel of the department,
personnel study outside, and outside visitors to the department were variables for academic
activities. Line plots were used to illustrate temporal trend of the variables during the study
period. Mean ± standard deviation and median with interquartile range were used to
summarize the variables. The Kruskal-Wallis equality-of-populations rank test was used to
compare the difference between the medians of the variables during the same time period, i.e.
from January to June, in 2018, 2019 and 2020. All the analyses were conducted in Stata 16.1
(StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).
There were no human subjects involved in the study, and only aggregated data were used in
the analysis, and no private and confidential information could be disclosed, therefore the
ethical approval is not applicable.

3. Results
Clinical services
According to the results of this study, there was a decrease in the number of patients seeking
clinical services in the stomatology clinic beginning January 2020. The month of February
2020 recorded almost zero patients in all variables for clinical services. Figure 1 shows a

continuous trend of all the clinical services until the month of January 2020 when a decrease
began. However, from the month of April 2020, an increase in the number of patients starts to
be observed again. The monthly number of patients seeking the outpatient services during
January and June was decreased by two thirds, which are 3561.3 ± 419.2 in 2018, 3996.2 ±
579.2 in 2019, and 1222.4 ± 1106.8 in 2020 (Table 1). The number of emergency cases
attended to in this department also significantly decreased by 64%, from a monthly number of
125.2 ±17.8 in 2018 to 45.3 ± 18.6 in 2020. Table 1 compares the median numbers of all
clinical services in the three years, and statistically significant differences are noted in all
variables among the three years.
Education
There is a decreasing trend for teaching hours and number of interns in the year 2020. This
decrease was noted from the month of January 2020 (Figure 2). The monthly number of
teaching hours decreased by >50%, from 3.8 ± 1.5 in 2018 and 4.7 ± 1.4 in 2019 to 1.7 ± 1.9
in 2020. The number of interns also decreased by > 70%, from a monthly number of 20.5 ±
9.2 in 2018 and 29.0 ± 10.1 in 2019 to 5.7 ± 4.5 in 2020. Table 1 compares the medians of the
education variables over the three years and shows statistically significant differences
between the three years.
Academic Communication
Since academic activities/communication were usually taken in autumn and were much fewer
in other seasons, there was no statistically difference noted in the time trend over the three
years.
No statistically significant difference was found for academic activities/communication
throughout the three years, except for the number of personnel studying outside (Table 1),
however, the difference was no clinical significance.

4. Discussion
Stomatology clinics are among the departments in the health sector that are severely affected
by infectious diseases mostly transmitted by respiratory droplets, and COVID-19 is no
exception. This has been shown to be due to the nature of dental interventions and the
proximity of the dental care provider to the oral region of the patient.[6, 11] Recent
identification of COVID-19 in saliva [12] has also intensified the need for strict and effective
infection control protocols for hospitals and dental practices in areas that are affected with
COVID-19.
According to our study, all the clinical services and education in the stomatology clinic were
significantly affected since the beginning of the epidemic in the city. The most significant
impacts happened in the month of February, 2020 that recorded almost zero patients in the
number of outpatients, emergency services, operations and hospitalization. Although the
decline in the number of patients seeking services was expected after the emergence of the
epidemic due to fear and recommendations from the government of China to stay indoors [6,
10], reports of the first human to human transmission seems to have also severely affected
these services as this was first reported in late January 2020.[13] Our study collaborating with
other studies show that in times of the similar epidemics happening the clinical services in
stomatology clinics having been severely affected.[6, 11, 14]
The education in this department was affected with a decline in the number of teaching hours
and the number of interns compared to other years. Although practical sessions are the
preferred format for the department, online sessions have also shown promising results as
reported by Liu et al.[15]
There was no impact observed on academic activities so far due to their inherent seasonal
pattern. However, the long-term effects still need to be investigated in the future.

5. Conclusion
The impacts of COVID 19 on the stomatology clinic are significant with a decrease in clinical
services and education offered to the stomatology students. To mitigate the negative impacts
of the epidemic on the stomatology clinics, it is necessary to review the guidelines and
protocols of the clinics, and encourage people seek for dental services with enough protection
against COVID-19, therefore to keep as many as needed dental profession stay on thriving
and remain on the frontline of healthcare.
