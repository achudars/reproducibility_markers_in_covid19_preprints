Key Points:

Question: What clinical parameters lead to a lower mortality rate in nursing home patients with
COVID-19?

Findings: In this cross-sectional analysis of 56 SARS-CoV-2 positive New Jersey nursing home
residents from March to July 2020, controlling hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, hematologic

and lipid panels to recommended levels yielded a mortality rate of 14.3%, a 49.5% reduction

from the 28.3% mortality rate of COVID-19 in New Jersey nursing homes.

Meaning: Maintaining rigorous control of clinical parameters in nursing home populations may
account for a decreased mortality rate of COVID-19.

Abstract:

Importance and Objective: COVID-19 has a high mortality rate amongst nursing home
populations (26.4% nationally and 28.3% in New Jersey). Identification of factors influencing

mortality in COVID-19 positive nursing home populations may help direct physicians towards

appropriate glycemic, blood pressure, weight, kidney function, lipid, thyroid, and hematologic

management to reduce COVID-19 mortality.

Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cross-sectional study of patients in two nursing
home facilities (one urban, one suburban) from 3/16/2020 to 7/13/2020 with positive COVID-

19 PCR assays. Age, race, sex, lipids, hematologic parameters, body mass index, blood pressure,

thyroid function, albumin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and hemoglobin A1c were

correlated with COVID-19 mortality by chi-squared analysis.

Main Outcome and Results: 56 patients met the inclusion criteria for the study. Mortality was
14.3% while the New Jersey nursing home average mortality rate was 28.3% as of August 2020.

Our patient cohort had a 49.5% reduction in mortality compared to the state average.

In our overall cohort, none of the clinical parameters correlated with COVID-19

mortality using chi-squared analysis. In the 56 patient cohort, average clinical and laboratory

findings were 74.0 years, 62.5% female, 28.5% uncontrolled hypertension, BMI 25.6,

hemoglobin A1c 6.4, TSH 2.4, vitamin B12 568.3, folate 12.4, iron 47.8, total iron binding

capacity 271.8, hemoglobin 11.6, albumin 3.5, triglycerides 100.3, total cholesterol 133.5, HDL

40.9, and BUN to Creatinine ratio 22.2:1. Logistic multivariate regression analyses failed to

demonstrate clinically significant correlation with COVID-19 mortality.

In the urban nursing home, BUN to creatinine ratio exceeding 20:1 was the only factor

that showed statistical significance to COVID-19 mortality (p = 0.03). In the suburban nursing

home, age over 80 was the only clinical factor demonstrating statistical significance to COVID-

19 mortality (p = 0.003).

Conclusions and Relevance: In our COVID-19 positive nursing home patients, no one parameter
was clinically significant in the overall 56-patient cohort; however, mortality in our population

was 14.3% compared to New Jersey’s 28.3%, a 49.5% reduction in mortality. Rigorous control of

the aforementioned clinical parameters may have contributed to this reduction in mortality.

Further research requires analysis of more nursing home patients to determine whether

rigorous control of clinical parameters decreases mortality from COVID-19.

Introduction:

COVID-19, is an emerging infectious disease with a particularly high mortality rate

amongst nursing home populations compared to the general population (26.4% vs. 7.8%

th
1-4
nationally and 28.3% vs. 7.6% in New Jersey as of August 5 , 2020).
Nursing home

populations consist of residents who have chronic underlying medical conditions such as

hypertension, cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, thyroid disease,

hematologic disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and renal disease.

5

Identifying clinical

parameters that positively or negatively affect mortality from COVID-19 in a nursing home

population should be of paramount importance to reducing the mortality rate for this

vulnerable population.

Prior studies that discuss the prevalence of co-morbidities in the total COVID-19 positive

6
population show that 60-90% of patients have a comorbidity. The co-morbidities for COVID-19

positive patients in the nursing home population include chronic lung disease (38%), diabetes

(38%), cardiovascular disease (81%), cerebrovascular accident (40%), renal disease (38%),

hemodialysis (6%), cognitive impairment (58%), and obesity (23%). These co-morbidity

report the severity of those conditions and how that might have affected the overall mortality

rate of the patients in those nursing homes.

Our study looks at the clinical parameters of COVID-19 positive patients in a skilled

nursing facility and aims to identify significant factors that lead to increased or decreased

mortality in the nursing home population. The purpose of the study is to direct nursing home

physicians towards appropriate glycemic, blood pressure, weight, kidney function, lipid, thyroid,

and hematologic management so that COVID-19 mortality can be reduced.

Methods and Materials:

Subjects: Retrospective cross-sectional study of 56 nursing home residents from 3/16/2020 to

7/13/2020 who tested positive for COVID-19 via PCR assay. These patients were under the

primary care of one internal medicine physician and lived in two nursing home facilities, one in

an urban setting (sub-cohort comprised of 26 patients), and the other in a suburban setting

(sub-cohort comprised of 30 patients) in New Jersey. Our study was approved by the Cooper

University Hospital institutional review board. Written permission was granted by the nursing

home administrators.

Demographics: The median age of our patient cohort was 74.0 years with an interquartile range

(IQR) of 64.8 to 83.0 years old. The patient cohort was 62.5% female, the median body mass

index (BMI) was 25.6 with an IQR of 23.4 to 33.0, 61% of patients had diabetes, and 91% with

hypertension defined as greater than 120/80 mm Hg.

Procedures: A retrospective cross-sectional analysis. All patients (both symptomatic and

asymptomatic) in both nursing facilities were tested for COVID-19 positivity during the time

interval of our study. A list of patients with a positive COVID-19 PCR assay was obtained. From

these patients, sex, age, blood pressure (BP), BMI, hemoglobin A1c, thyroid stimulating

hormone (TSH), vitamin B12, folate, iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), hemoglobin,

albumin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein

(HDL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (Cr) were obtained from the patients’ hybrid

PointClickCare electronic medical record and paper charts. BMI was calculated using height,

weight, and a BMI calculator. Patients were treated using low molecular weight heparin therapy

9
if not previously anticoagulated. Acetaminophen was provided on an as needed basis for fever.

Definitions and Criteria: Triglycerides were labelled as normal if the value was between 35-160

mg/dL, and high if the value was over 160 mg/dL. Total cholesterol was labelled as normal if the

value was 200 mg/dL or less, and high if the value was over 200 mg/dL. HDL cholesterol was

normal if the value was between 35-80 mg/dL, low if the value was below 35 mg/dL, and high if

the value was above 80 mg/dL. LDL cholesterol was normal if the value was at or below 130

mg/dL and high if the value was above 130 mg/dL. BMI was defined as normal if the value was

between 20.0-24.9, overweight if the value was between 25.0-29.9, and obese if the value was

above 30.0. Hypertension was defined as any blood pressure greater than 120 mm Hg systolic

and 80 mm Hg diastolic. Uncontrolled hypertension was defined as any blood pressure greater

than 130 mm Hg systolic and 90 mm Hg diastolic. Patients were considered non-diabetic if their

hemoglobin A1c was less than 5.7%, pre-diabetic if their hemoglobin A1c was between 5.7%-

6.4%, and diabetic if their hemoglobin A1c was above 6.4%. Albumin was normal if the value

was between 3.5-5.5 mg/dL. BUN to Cr ratio was normal between 10-20:1 mg/dL. TSH was

normal if the value was between 0.4-4.0 mU/L. Hemoglobin was normal if the value was

between 12-17.5 g/dL. Vitamin B12 was normal if the value was between 200-900 pg/mL.

Folate was normal if the value was between 2-20 ng/mL. Iron was normal if the value was

between 50-170 mg/dL.

Data Collection: All clinical parameter values were obtained from clinical and laboratory

reports.

Statistical Tests: Data was broken into categories as described above. COVID-19 mortality was

analyzed against all other categories using chi-squared analysis. Logistic multivariate regression

analyses were used to compare COVID-19 mortality, age, and all the other clinical parameters

with a chi-squared p-value less than 0.30. A p-value less than or equal to 0.05 represents an

acceptable level of statistical significance.

Results:
Three out of 26 patients died from COVID-19 in the urban nursing home setting and 5

out of 30 patients died from COVID-19 in the suburban nursing home location. Analysis of our

whole patient cohort showed that the mortality of COVID-19 positive patients was 14.3% (8 out

of 56 patients) compared to the 28.3% mortality rate observed throughout New Jersey nursing

homes. Our 56 patient cohort had a 49.5% reduction in mortality compared to the state

average.

Taking a closer look at our whole patient cohort, we analyzed age, sex, race, blood

pressure, BMI, hemoglobin A1c, TSH, vitamin B12, folate, iron, TIBC, hemoglobin, albumin,

triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, and BUN:Cr ratio and compared these parameters to

COVID-19 mortality. Six/29 (20.7%) Black patients, 1/18 (5.6%) White patients, and 1/9 (11.1%)

Hispanic patients died from COVID-19. Obesity was found in 28.6% of the patient cohort.

Cardiovascular disease was present in 94.6% of the patient cohort. Cerebrovascular accident

was present in 28.6% of the patient cohort. Hypertension was present in 85.7% of the patient

cohort with 28.7% of the patients having uncontrolled hypertension defined as greater than

130/90 mm Hg. Hyperlipidemia was present in 67.9% of the patient cohort. Diabetes was

present in 55.4% of the patient cohort. Chronic lung disease was present in 30.4% of the patient

cohort. Renal disease was present in 42.9% of the patient cohort. We found that none of these

factors had statistical significance towards increased COVID-19 mortality amongst this cohort

(Table 1 and 2). Logistic regression analyses using combinations of the aforementioned

parameters failed to demonstrate any statistically significant correlation with COVID-19

mortality.

In the urban nursing home facility and the suburban nursing home facility, clinical

parameters mentioned above were compared to COVID-19 mortality via chi-squared analysis

(Table 3). Only BUN to Cr ratio above 20:1 showed statistical significance to increased COVID-19

mortality (p = 0.03) in the urban nursing home facility and age over 80 (p = 0.003) showed

significance to increased COVID-19 mortality in the suburban nursing home facility. Thirteen out

of the 30 patients (43.3%) in the suburban nursing facility who contracted COVID-19 were over

80 years old. Five of these 13 patients (38.5%) died (all the patients who died in this facility). In

the urban nursing home, 9 out of 26 patients (34.6%) who contracted COVID-19 were over 80

years old. None of these 9 patients died. Clinical parameters for patients over 80 years old were

compared in Table 4. No statistical significance was found comparing clinical parameters and

COVID-19 mortality for the greater than 80-year-old sub-cohort in the urban or suburban

nursing home.

Discussion:

We found that in our whole patient cohort, the COVID-19 mortality rate was 14.3%, a

49.5% reduction in mortality compared to the 28.3% mortality rate from COVID-19 in the New

Jersey nursing home population. Upon further investigation, there was no clinical or social

parameter (race, sex, age, hypertension, BMI, hemoglobin A1c, TSH, vitamin B12, folate, iron,

TIBC, hemoglobin, albumin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, and BUN to Cr ratio) in our

entire cohort that indicated increased or decreased likelihood of COVID-19 mortality. In the

urban nursing home facility, BUN to Cr ratio over 20:1 was the only clinical parameter that

indicated increased likelihood of COVID-19 mortality (p = 0.03). In the suburban nursing home

facility, age over 80 years was the only clinical parameter that showed increased likelihood of

COVID-19 mortality (p = 0.003) because all the patients who died in this facility were over the

age of 80. No specific clinical parameter in the over 80-year-old suburban nursing home sub-

population increased mortality.

This dramatically lower mortality for our combined group of nursing home patients may

provide guidance in reducing COVID-19 mortality without the discovery of new treatments. The

nursing home residents from our cohort on average had rigorous control of their diabetes,

blood pressure, weight, lipids, and hemoglobin. The cohort’s median hemoglobin A1c for

diabetics was 6.4% which is excellent control according to the American Diabetes Association

which recommends controlling hemoglobin A1c to less than 8.0% for older patients with

10
multiple co-morbidities.
The cohort’s average blood pressure was 125 mm Hg systolic BP and

72 mm Hg diastolic BP. According to the Joint National Commission 8 guidelines on

hypertension which recommends that the general population over age 60 have blood pressure

less than 150 for systolic BP and 90 for diastolic BP, the cohort had excellent BP control at 125

was controlled to below the upper limit of normal for the 67.9% of the patient cohort with

hyperlipidemia. All other clinical parameters were controlled to their normal reference ranges

except for hemoglobin in which the average was 11.6 g/L which is under the lower limit of

normal at 12.5 g/L.

Nursing home patient clinical parameter control and its effects on COVID-19 have not

been explored in the literature so far. A few papers detailed the rates of underlying conditions

in a COVID-19 positive nursing home population.

7,8

Cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular

accident, chronic lung disease, diabetes, renal disease, and obesity had prevalence rates of

81%, 40%, 38%, 38%, 38%, and 23% respectively in the COVID-19 positive nursing home

population.

7

These are similar rates seen in our patient cohort: 94.6%, 28.6%, 30.4%, 55.4%,

42.9%, and 28.6% for cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular accident, chronic lung disease,

diabetes, renal disease, and obesity respectively. Therefore, we can assume that our nursing

home population has a co-morbidity rate similar to that of other nursing homes in the United

States.

The 49.5% reduction of mortality in our patient population compared to the state

average suggests that meticulous control of clinical parameters might help to decrease COVID-

19 mortality in the nursing home population, regardless of race or sex. While we could not

identify specific parameters in our combined urban and suburban populations that indicate

higher risk of COVID-19 mortality, we believe it is imperative that physicians maintain strict

control of their nursing home patients’ clinical parameters in order to mitigate the potential

lethality of COVID-19.

Study strengths and limitations: All patients in the cohort were treated under the

auspices of a single physician, who provided uniform care to all COVID-19 positive patients.

Data was collected from two nursing home facilities. A large-scale review of nursing home

charts from multiple physicians in multiple nursing homes across New Jersey (and perhaps

nationwide) is needed for comparison between our cohort’s clinical parameters and those of

other physicians in other nursing homes in New Jersey and nationally. However, despite this

limited data set, we feel that the finding of decreased mortality in our cohort compared to New

Jersey’s COVID-19 positive nursing home population is supported by the rigorous clinical

parameter control detailed in Table 1.

Conclusion:

From our data, we conclude that the 49.5% reduction of mortality in our nursing home

cohort compared to the state average was a result of carefully controlled blood pressure,

diabetes, lipids, and other clinical parameters. Future directions should include a large-scale

review of nursing home patient clinical parameters to determine the specific factors in the

nursing home population that increase COVID-19 mortality.
