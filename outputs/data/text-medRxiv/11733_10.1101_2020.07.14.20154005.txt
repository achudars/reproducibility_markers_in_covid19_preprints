Abstract

2

With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, there is need

3

for sensitive, specific and affordable diagnostic tests to identify infected individuals, not all of whom

4

are symptomatic. The most sensitive test involves the detection of viral RNA using RT-qPCR, with

5

many commercial kits now available for this purpose. However, these are expensive and supply of

6

such kits in sufficient numbers cannot always be guaranteed. We therefore developed a multiplex

7

assay using well-established SARS-CoV-2 targets alongside a human cellular control (RPP30) and a

8

viral spike-in control (PhHV-1), which monitor sample quality and nucleic acid extraction efficiency

9

respectively. Here, we establish that this test performs as well as widely used commercial assays, but

10

at substantially reduced cost. Furthermore, we demonstrate >1,000-fold variability in material

11

routinely collected by nose-and-throat swabbing, and establish a statistically significant correlation

12

between the detected level of human and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids. The inclusion of the human

13

control probe in our assay therefore provides a quantitative measure of sample quality that could

14

help reduce false negative rates. We demonstrate feasibility of establishing a robust RT-qPCR assay

15

at ~10% of the cost of equivalent commercial assays, which could benefit low resource

16

environments and make high volume testing more affordable.

Introduction

18

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 [1], originated in Wuhan

19

(China) in December 2019 and rapidly spread across the globe, resulting in substantial mortality [2,

20

3] and widespread economic damage. Until a vaccine becomes available, public health strategies

21

centred on reducing the rate of transmission are crucial to mitigating the epidemic, for which

22

effective and affordable testing strategies to enable widespread population surveillance are

23

essential. The most sensitive test to diagnose infected individuals involves the detection of SARS-

24

CoV-2 viral RNA using RT-qPCR, most commonly using samples collected with nasopharyngeal (nose-

25

and-throat) swabs (NTS), although there is increasing evidence that the use of saliva may be a valid

26

alternative [4-7]. Many commercial kits are now available, most of which employ multiplex RT-qPCR,

27

detecting 2 or 3 different SARS-CoV-2 targets, and generally include an internal control to show

28

successful nucleic acid extraction. However, such kits are often costly and their supply in sufficient

29

numbers cannot always be guaranteed. We therefore developed a similar multiplex assay using well-

30

established SARS-CoV-2 targets and internal controls, which can be carried out at a significantly

31

lower cost and provides more flexibility to ensure resilience against potential shortages in reagent

32

supplies.

33

Our assay makes use of the Takara One Step PrimeScript III RT-qPCR kit. This reagent was used in the

34

first high profile publication to describe SARS-CoV-2 [1], and it has since been shown to outperform a

35

number of similar reagents [8]. Before commercial COVID-19 assays were available, various in-house

36

assays were published on the WHO website [9]. Based on the data available at the time (March

37

2020), we decided to focus our initial efforts on targeting the following SARS-CoV-2 genes (Fig 1A;

38

[10-12]): E (envelope), RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) and N (nucleocapsid). Corman et al

39

(2020) proposed the E gene as a useful target for first line screening, with the RdRp gene suggested

40

as a good target for confirmatory/discriminatory assays [13, 14]. The N gene was central to the USA

41

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in vitro diagnostics emergency protocol, with

42

three different primer/probe sets (N1, N2 and N3) used against different portions of this viral gene

43

[9]. The CDC protocol also included a probe against human RPP30, a single copy gene encoding the

44

protein subunit p30 of the Ribonuclease (RNase) P particle, to ensure the presence of a sufficient

45

number of cells in patient samples and successful isolation of intact nucleic acids.

46

In early versions of these protocols, all probes were labelled with fluorescein amidite (FAM), and

47

separate reactions were therefore needed to detect each target. To increase efficiency, we

48

developed a multiplex assay using 4 different fluorescent labels (FAM, HEX, CAL Fluor Red 610 and

49

Quasar 670) for each of the probes, allowing their detection in a single reaction. In the final version

50

of our assay, we use previously described primers and probes against the well-established SARS-CoV-

51

2 E and N gene (N1 and N2) targets, as well as a human cellular control and a viral spike-in control

52

(Fig 1B, C): human RPP30 and Phocine Herpes Virus 1 (PhHV-1, hereafter referred to as PhHV). The

53

rationale behind the human control is that a considerable number of patients with clinical and

54

radiological signs of COVID-19 are PCR negative; and poor quality of swab samples with no or little

55

usable patient material is one possible explanation for this [15]. In essence, the RPP30 control

56

provides a measure of sample quality. In addition, a defined amount of PhHV is spiked into each

57

sample with the lysis buffer at the start of the nucleic acid isolation procedure, resulting in a known

58

cycle quantification or Cq value (also referred to as the cycle threshold or Ct value, [16]). Detection

59

of PhHV (using the Glycoprotein B gene as a target) simultaneously controls for extraction and

60

amplification efficiency, and indicates absence of PCR inhibitors [17, 18].

61

If paired with an in-house RNA extraction protocol, our assay can be performed for less than £2

62

(GBP; $2.50, USD) per test, excluding cost of plastic consumables, which could mean a potential 10-

63

fold difference in cost compared to commercial kits. Here we present data that demonstrates

64

equivalent performance to the commercial TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (CE-IVD; Thermo Fisher

65

Scientific) and Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay. We also document the utility of inclusion of

66

RPP30 as a human internal control to provide important sample quality information.

Results

69

N and E gene multiplex assays sensitively detect viral RNA

70

With the aim of developing a sensitive and affordable assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA,

71

we tested three different 4-plex strategies (Fig 1B, C). All made use of RPP30 (HEX) and PhHV (Cy5)

72

probes employed as internal controls (controlling for the presence of human cells in patient samples,

73

and successful nucleic acid isolation, respectively), as well as a CFR-labelled (CAL Fluor Red 610)

74

probe for the SARS-CoV-2 E gene. To enhance assay sensitivity and specificity, a FAM-labelled probe

75

against a second SARS-CoV-2 target was included in each of the three assays: RdRp, N1 or N2 (N

76

gene). We named these tests RdE-RP (RdRp, E, RPP30, PhHV), N1E-RP (N1, E, RPP30, PhHV) and N2E-

77

RP (N2, E, RPP30, PhHV) respectively (Fig 1C). Initial validation tests showed that these assays were

78

capable of detecting cultured SARS-CoV-2, with Cq values for E, N1 and N2 similar to those for

79

ORF1ab, S and N gene obtained using the ThermoFisher TaqPath COVID-19 assay. In contrast, RdRp

80

Cq values were substantially higher (Fig 1D; 4.4-6.1 cycles above the other targets).

81

Next, the RdE-RP, N1E-RP and N2E-RP assays were used to test SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative

82

patient samples (n = 19), comparing them to the commercial TaqPath assay and Abbott RealTime

83

SARS-CoV-2 assay (which detects RdRp and N gene). The N1E-RP and N2E-RP assays both correctly

84

identified all 9 samples that had tested positive using the TaqPath and Abbott assays (Table 1). The

85

RdE-RP assay performed less well, identifying 7 of these samples correctly, giving inconclusive results

86

for the other two (P18 and 19), with E gene but not RdRp detected. Overall, we find RdRp detection

87

to be at least 20-fold less sensitive than for E gene, N1 and N2 under our assay conditions; consistent

88

with reports by others [19]. This may be due to a mismatch in the reverse primer employed in the

89

RdRp (P2) assay, as originally designed [14]. Both N1E-RP and N2E-RP assays also identified positive

90

samples that scored negative with the commercial tests, suggesting potentially higher sensitivity of

91

our assays. Of the 10 patient samples that were negative for the Abbott assay, 9 were similarly

92

shown to be negative using the N1E-RP assay, whereas 8 of these were negative for the N2E-RP

93

assay. Patient 11, previously negative using the Abbott assay, was inconclusive with TaqPath (1 of 3

94

SARS-CoV-2 targets detected) and N2E-RP assays (1 of 2 targets detected), but positive in the N1E-RP

95

assay. Patient 12 had previously tested negative using both Abbott and TaqPath assays, and was also

96

negative for N1E-RP; however, this sample tested weakly positive for both SARS-CoV-2 targets in the

97

N2E-RP assay. Cq values were high for both P11 and P12, close to the limit of detection, but with

98

multiple viral targets detected, these likely represent true positives. However, differentiating

99

between samples with low viral loads and false positives is challenging. Analysis of such samples by

100

Sanger sequencing of PCR products, or nanopore sequencing of RNA present could provide useful

101

information. Further clinical evaluation and repeat sampling of the patient involved may also be a

102

beneficial route to a secure clinical diagnosis.

103

As our initial characterisation demonstrated the N1E-RP and N2E-RP assays to be at least as sensitive

104

as two commercial assays, TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Abbott

105

RealTime SARS-CoV-2 (Abbott Laboratories), we focussed on these two assays for further validation

106

experiments.

107
108

Multiplex assays for N and E genes can detect between 1 and 50 copies of IVT RNA

109

To determine the detection limit for the N1E-RP and N2E-RP assays, in vitro transcribed (IVT) RNA

110

controls for each of the SARS-CoV-2 targets were prepared. An equimolar mix was used to make a

111

dilution series (for 10,000 down to 1 copy of RNA per reaction; a 50-copy control was also included)

112

and Cq values determined in triplicate using both assays (Fig 2A). To test our nucleic acid isolation

113

protocol, all dilutions after extraction were simultaneously tested in triplicate (Fig S1A). All probes

114

(E, N1 and N2) reproducibly detected 50 copies (Fig 2A, Fig S1A and Table S1). The N1 probe

115

detected 10 copies reproducibly (6 out of 6; 6/6), while the N2 probe did so in some reactions (4/6)

116

of the respective 4-plex assays. The E probe detected 10 copies reproducibly in the N2E-RP assay

117

(6/6), but only did so in half of the N1E-RP reactions (3/6). As might be expected, single copies of

118

RNA were only detected in a small proportion of reactions for each probe: E (2/12), N1 (3/6) and N2

119

(1/6). We therefore conclude that our assays have the sensitivity to detect between 1 and 50 copies

120

of IVT RNA (Fig 2A, Fig S1A and Table S1), both pre and post-extraction.

121
122

N1E-RP and N2E-RP assays can detect between 1 and 3 copies of viral RNA

123

To confirm the range of detection for total viral RNA, nucleic acids isolated from cultured SARS-CoV-

124

2 were used to make a dilution series (10-1 to 10-6), and Cq values determined in triplicate using the

125

N1E-RP and N2E-RP assays (Fig 2B). To test the impact of the nucleic acid isolation procedure on

126

extraction of low copy numbers of viral RNA, and to test the PhHV spike in control, the dilution

127

series was also re-extracted and used for RT-qPCR simultaneously (Fig S1B). Sensitivity of detection

128

for these samples was highest for E gene, followed by N1 and N2 (Fig 2B, Fig S1B and Table S2).

129

Signal was lost for the 10-5 dilution in most cases, consistent with the Cq values of the undiluted

130

sample (21.3-23.4) and the 100,000-fold reduction in copy number for this dilution (theoretically

131

predicted Cq values, ~38-40). For all extractions and RT-qPCR replicates the signal for the PhHV spike

132

in was highly reproducible (Table S2), with a Cq value of 32.5 ± 0.40 (mean ± SD, range 30.7-33.0),

133

indicating robust extraction efficiency and absence of PCR inhibitors.

134

Finally, 8 quality control samples obtained from QCMD (an international external quality assessment

135

organisation) were also tested using the N1E-RP, N2E-RP and TaqPath assays. Each assay gave the

136

same outcome, consistent with data provided by QCMD (Table S3), identifying 5 samples as positive

137

(4 to 4,000 copies of SARS-CoV-2 per reaction) and 3 as negative (containing transport medium or

138

different corona viruses). All probes used in the N1E-RP and N2E-RP assays displayed a linear range

139

of detection down to 4 copies of viral RNA (Fig 2C). These calibration curves were retrospectively

140

used to calculate the detection limit of our own viral RNA serial dilution (Fig 2B), showing that in

141

these experiments our assays detected between 1 and 3 copies of genomic SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

142
143

N1E-RP and N2E-RP multiplex assays correctly identify positive patient samples

144

Next, to further establish assay reproducibility in a diagnostics context, the N1E-RP and N2E-RP

145

assays were performed on an additional 89 patient samples, and results compared to the TaqPath

146

assay. The patient samples contained both SARS-CoV-2 positives and negatives, and were tested

147

blind. Internal controls were included to provide confirmation of successful nucleic acid extraction

148

and absence of PCR inhibitors, with lysis buffer spiked with both MS2 (an RNA bacteriophage that

149

infects Escherichia coli) and PhHV (a DNA virus that infects seals), detected by the TaqPath and N1E-

150

RP/N2E-RP assays respectively. In addition, the same three controls were performed for each assay:

151

an extracted viral transport medium control (negative for SARS-CoV-2 and RPP30, positive for PhHV),

152

a non-extracted water only control (negative for all targets) and a non-extracted in vitro transcribed

153

RNA positive control (50 copies; positive for SARS-CoV-2, negative for RPP30 and PhHV).

154

Results for controls were as anticipated (Table S4), with signal absent (undetermined) for SARS-CoV-

155

2 and RPP30 targets for the negative controls, and Cq values for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive

156

control (50 copies) similar to those obtained previously (Fig 2A). The PhHV control gave consistent

157

Cq values for both N1E-RP (32.5 ± 1.1) and N2E-RP assays (33.3 ± 1.2; Table S4, Fig S2A), confirming

158

reliable and reproducible extraction of nucleic acids from patient samples; similar to the MS2 control

159

used in the TaqPath assay (mean Cq value, 25.6 ± 0.9; Table S4, Fig S2A). Out of the 89 samples, the

160

TaqPath assay identified 75 samples as negative, 1 as inconclusive and 13 as positive. Both the N1E-

161

RP and N2E-RP assay detected the same 13 positive samples, and the majority of TaqPath negative

162

samples were similarly negative in our assays (n = 74). For the N1E-RP assay 6 of the negative

163

samples had Cq values between 39.0 and 43.2 for N1 (E gene not detected), suggesting potentially

164

higher sensitivity of the N1 probe in this assay. The sample that was inconclusive with the TaqPath

165

assay (P75) was positive for both N1E-RP and N2E-RP assays, consistent with this being a true

166

positive. In addition, there was one sample (P53) that was negative with TaqPath, but positive for

167

both N1E-RP and N2E-RP assays, albeit with very high Cq values (between 35.7 and 39.2), close to

168

the limit of detection.

169

Altogether, our data (for n = 108 patient samples) establish that the sensitivity of the N1E-RP and

170

N2E-RP assays is similar to, if not higher than, the TaqPath assay (Fig 3).

171
172

Substantial variability in NTS quality, as measured by human RPP30, impacts on assay sensitivity

173

The range of Cq values for the human RPP30 control was much greater than that of the PhHV

174

internal control (Table S4, Fig 4A, B and Fig S2). This indicated that there was considerable variability

175

in the amount of cellular material present in different patient samples. The RPP30 primer/probe set

176

has good amplification efficiency and was able to detect 10 copies of positive control nucleic acids

177

(Fig S3), hence Cq values for this probe represent a good measure of the presence of intact cellular

178

nucleic acids in patient samples. Although RPP30 was detected in all samples, Cq values ranged from

179

20.1 to 31.7 for the N1E-RP assay and from 20.3 to 32.1 for the N2E-RP assay, which equates to a

180

difference of between 3,100 and 3,600-fold in extracted nucleic acids between the best and worst

181

samples. Although the distribution of positives (Fig 4A, B) shows that samples with high RPP30 Cq

182

values can still test positive, this is not an adequate measure of the likelihood of false negatives

183

among samples with similarly low levels of human material. A statistically significant linear

184

correlation between Cq values for each of the viral probes (E, N1, and N2) and the Cq values for the

185

RPP30 sample quality probe (p < 0.001; Fig 4C and data not shown) established that samples

186

containing fewer human cells are more likely to have less SARS-CoV-2, decreasing the chance of

187

detection. To visually demonstrate the impact of this, we normalised SARS-CoV-2 Cq values to the

188

sample with the lowest amount of human material detected (reference sample, RPP30 Cq value

189

31.7/32.1). Due to the linear correlation between RPP30 and viral Cq values, subtracting the

190

difference in RPP30 Cq between a particular positive sample and the reference sample from the

191

SARS-CoV-2 Cq gives an indication of what the viral Cq may have been had it contained the same low

192

amount of human material present in the reference sample. This shows that of the 26 positive

193

samples we detected, between 4 and 6 (15-23%) would not have tested positive, with at least one of

194

the viral targets exceeding the detection limit (Cq > 40; Fig 4D and Fig S4A). Theoretically, using this

195

approach, even a strong positive sample (SARS-CoV-2 Cq value of 28.2) of good quality (RPP30 Cq

196

value of 20.3) may have given a false negative test result (SARS-CoV-2 Cq value of 40) if it had

197

contained the same low amount of human material as the reference sample (RPP30 Cq value of

198

32.1; viral Cq: 32.1-20.3+28.2=40). Conversely, normalising samples to an optimal quality sample

199

(RPP30 Cq 20.1/20.3) gives an indication of what viral Cq values may have been if all samples had

200

contained a similar (more optimal) amount of material (Fig 4E, Fig S4B). This highlights the possibility

201

that a proportion of apparent SARS-CoV-2 negative samples are in fact false negatives as a result of

202

insufficient material in the swab fluid. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 Cq values clustered more strongly

203

after normalisation (Fig 4D, E; Fig S4). This reduced variability not only shows that the amount of

204

human material present in NTS samples impacts on assay sensitivity, but also suggests that

205

variability in viral load is not as great as implied by RT-qPCR data without normalisation.

206

207

Discussion

208

Here, we describe a user-friendly protocol for an accurate and affordable SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test.

209

Although we did not detect substantial differences between our two assays, others have reported

210

higher sensitivity of the N1 over the N2 assay [19]. We therefore recommend the use of the N1E-RP

211

assay for primary testing, and the N2E-RP assay could be employed if initial results are inconclusive.

212

We provide detailed materials and methods to enable others to rapidly set up this assay in their own

213

laboratory or to adapt it to locally available equipment and reagents. While we provide extensive

214

validation of the reagents and instruments used to perform these multiplex RT-qPCR assays, our

215

methods allow some flexibility. Probes with different labels as well as alternative Real-Time PCR

216

217

controls other than PhHV could be used, such as recombinant DNA or RNA. However, virus would

218

better mimic extraction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and other viruses with an RNA genome (e.g. lentivirus,

219

routinely produced in many molecular biology laboratories) would make particularly good controls,

220

not only confirming successful RNA extraction, but also controlling for RNA stability and reverse

221

transcription. As a further development, replacing E gene with M or S gene probes, could provide

222

N2M or N2S assays as fully independent second line tests. Both M and S gene assays have been

223

shown to have high sensitivity [20, 21] and their target regions display low sequence variation (Table

224

S5). Additional improvements to our protocol could include the use of control primers/probe specific

225

to a human RNA transcript (the RPP30 primers/probe described here detect both RNA and genomic

226

DNA) as this would ensure that samples contain intact RNA [22]. However, it should be stressed that

227

any changes to the protocol may also change the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection, and new

228

protocols should undergo appropriate validation before use for diagnostic purposes.

229

Our assays have high analytical sensitivity, equivalent to commercial CE-IVD kits. RT-qPCR tests are

230

molecular tests with high intrinsic accuracy, however false positive and false negative results can

231

occur. The use of multiplex assays that detect multiple SARS-CoV-2 targets, such as those reported

232

here, reduces the chance of both. Off-target reactivity is one possible cause of false positives, and

233

although some have reported high false positive rates for the E gene assay [20, 23], this does not

234

match our experience. In two patients, our N1E-RP and N2E-RP assays detected virus, albeit weakly,

235

whereas commercial assays did not. As multiple SARS-CoV-2 targets were positive, these are likely

236

true positive results and not due to off-target reactivity. False positives can also occur due to lab

237

issues such as sample mislabelling, data entry errors, reagent contamination with target nucleic

238

acids or contamination of primary specimens. However high standards of quality control at all stages

239

of testing, and effective mitigation strategies should quickly identify problems. Additionally, sample

240

re-testing with an independent assay and/or patient re-sampling should also be effective measures

241

to counter false positives, particularly in low pre-test probability situations such as mass screening.

242

False negative test results are an important ongoing issue, estimated to be somewhere between 2

243

and 54% [24-26]. Sequence variation at primer/probe binding sites could be one factor resulting in

244

false negatives. However, for the primers and probes used the chance of this is low (>97.6% of

245

97,782 strains have no relevant changes; Table 2, Table S5), and strains with mutations in two

246

independent targets should be very rare. Therefore sequence variation is not expected to be a

247

significant contributing factor to the number of false negatives. In contrast, low sample quality

248

provides a much more likely explanation; and this may be particularly important in case of self-

249

sampling. Systematic inclusion of a human control to provide sample quality metrics, could therefore

250

have utility in reducing the number of false negatives. Testing saliva, as an alternative to NTS

251

sampling, could also be beneficial as a modality that may have less-sample to sample variability [7].

252

Absence of RPP30 signal (undetected or Cq >40) clearly indicates that absence of viral detection

253

cannot be interpreted as a negative test result and that a repeat test is required (Table S6).

254

However, utilising RPP30 Cq values when interpreting an apparent SARS-CoV-2 negative sample

255

requires further consideration: what should the RPP30 Cq limit be for which to order a repeat test?

256

One option would be to simply set an arbitrary cut-off, e.g. one could decide to re-test any samples

257

with RPP30 Cq >30, or with Cq values above the 95th centile (Cq ~ 31 for our 108 samples). To

258

determine robust cut-off limits, collection of RPP30 data for a much larger number of patient

259

samples would be desirable. This would allow development of diagnostic algorithms that could

260

incorporate a sample quality score based on the level of RPP30 detected. Nonetheless, RPP30 data,

261

even as it stands, are useful for the interpretation of cases for which only one of the SARS-CoV-2

262

targets is (weakly) positive, with samples with high RPP30 Cq values interpreted with particular

263

caution. In such cases, repeat testing of the same sample (with an independent assay of equal or

264

better sensitivity) would be advisable, and repeat patient specimen collection and testing might also

265

be considered (see Table S6 for guidance). Ultimately, the clinical sensitivity of any diagnostic test is

266

influenced by multiple factors, including sample timing relative to symptom onset, sample type and

267

sample quality. The inclusion of a human control in our assays provides an internal sample quality

control, supporting improved interpretation of test results, which could contribute to reducing false

269

negative rates.

270

Taken together we show that sensitive and robust RT-qPCR assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2

271

are available at a fraction of the cost of comparable commercial assays. The use of these assays

272

could make widespread population testing more feasible.

Materials and Methods

274

Patient samples

275

Samples were collected from symptomatic individuals by trained healthcare professionals using

276

combined nose-and-throat swabbing, and processed for diagnostic testing using validated CE-IVD

277

assays. Excess samples were then used to validate the in-house multiplex assays, with specimen

278

anonymization by coding, compliant with Tissue Governance for the South East Scotland Scottish

279

Academic Health Sciences Collaboration Human Annotated BioResource (reference no. SR1452). A

280

variety of swabs and viral transport media (VTM) were used. In each case, swabs were placed in VTM

281

and kept at ambient temperature until processed (within 24 h).

282
283

Nucleic Acid isolation

284

Nucleic acids were isolated using the Omega Mag-Bind Viral DNA/RNA 96 Kit (Cat. No. M6246),

285

following the Supplementary Protocol for NP Swabs (April 2020 version). Briefly, 200 µl VTM was

286

taken from patient swab sample inside a Class-2 safety cabinet and mixed with 240 µl TNA Lysis

287

Buffer, 1 µl carrier RNA and extraction controls (MS2, provided as part of the TaqPath COVID-19

288

Combo Kit, and PhHV, provided by the laboratory of Jürgen Haas) in screw capped tubes, for virus

289

inactivation. After incubation at room temperature for at least 15 min, samples were transferred

290

from tubes into 96-well KingFisher Deep well plates (Cat. No. 95040450) containing 280 µl

291

isopropanol and 2 µl Mag-Bind Particles per well, using a Biomek NXP Automated Liquid Handler

292

(Beckman Coulter). Plates were then moved and the isolation completed on a KingFisher Flex robot

293

(Cat. No. 5400610) as instructed by the manufacturer, including washes with 350 μL VHB Buffer and

294

2x 350 μL SPR Buffer, and RNA finally eluted in 50 µl of nuclease-free water in KingFisher 96

295

microplates (Cat. No. 97002540). Also see Supplementary Material, Protocol 2.

An in-house version of a magnetic bead-based isolation was tested and shown to perform similarly

297

in preliminary experiments (data not shown). The use of this protocol could further reduce the cost

298

per test, but would require additional validation. For details of this RNA isolation protocol, see

301

Primers and probes

302

Primers and probes (Table 3) were synthesised and HPLC purified by LGC BioSearch Technologies

303

(Risskov, Denmark), and dissolved in IDTE (10 mM Tris, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) to prepare 100 μM

304

stocks. Pre-prepared primer/probe mixes (FAM-labelled) for N1, N2 and RPP30 were obtained from

305

Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, USA; Cat. No. 10006713). Since we developed our assay, N1, N2

306

and RPP30 primers and probes also became available from IDT as 100 μM stocks, but can also be

307

purchased from other reputable oligonucleotide synthesis companies. All nucleic acid stocks and

308

dilutions were prepared in Eppendorf DNA LoBind tubes (Cat. No. 10051232).

309

Primer/probe mixes (50x) were prepared for E gene (20 µM E_Sarbeco_F1, 20 µM E_Sarbeco_R2, 10

310

µM TxRd_E_Sarbeco_P1), RdRp (30 µM RdRp_SARSr-F2, 40 µM RdRp_SARSr-R2, 10 µM

311

FAM_RdRp_SARSr-P2), RPP30 (25 µM Hs_RPP30-F, 25 µM Hs_RPP30-R, 6.25 µM HEX-Hs_RPP30-P)

312

and PhHV (15 µM PhHV-F, 15 µM PhHV-R, 5 µM Cy5-PhHV-P). The N1 and N2 primers/probes were

313

purchased premixed (~13.3x) from IDT. These individual primer/probe mixes, were then used to

314

prepare a single mix for each of the 4-plex assays: 12.5x for RdE-RP (with equal volumes of each of the

315

relevant mixes), 7.4x for N1E-RP and N2E-RP (with equal volumes of the E, RPP30 and PhHV mixes,

316

combined with 3.7x volumes of N1 or N2 mix). Mixes were stored at -20°C, with working stocks kept

317

at 4°C.

323

RT-qPCR

324

All RT-qPCRs were performed on Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR Systems with ABI

325

7500 software v2.3, using MicroAmp Fast Optical 0.1 mL 96-well reaction plates (Cat. No. 4346906)

326

and Optical Adhesive film (Cat. No. 4311971). For our assays we used the Takara One Step

327

PrimeScript III RT-qPCR kit (Cat. No. RR600B). These were compared to the TaqPath COVID-19

328

Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. A47814) and the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay

329

(Cat. No. 09N77-090), used as instructed by the manufacturer. The TaqPath assay was performed on

330

the ABI 7500 Fast System and the Abbott assay was performed on the M2000 system. Experiments

331

using the 4-plex assay were performed as described below, with a user-friendly protocol provided in

332

Supplementary Material, Protocol 1.

333

Reaction master mixes were prepared (20 μl per reaction) for each assay, before adding 5 μl of

334

template RNA per reaction, brief centrifugation and starting the PCR program. For the RdE-RP 4-plex

335

assay, per reaction 12.5 μl of One-Step mix, 5.5 μl of nuclease-free water, 2 μl of 12.5x primer/probe

336

mix and 5 μl of template RNA were mixed. For the N1E-RP and N2E-RP 4-plex assays, per reaction

337

12.5 μl of One-Step mix, 4.16 μl of nuclease-free water, 3.34 μl of 7.4x primer/probe mix and 5 μl of

338

template RNA were mixed. For all 4-plex reactions the PCR program was: 5 min at 52°C, 10 s at 95°C,

339

then 45 cycles of 3 s at 95°C and 30 s at 60°C. For detection the FAM, JOE, TEXAS RED and CY5

340

channels were used.

343

Amplification efficiency (E) was determined for all standard curves using the slope of the linear curve

344

fit when plotting Cq values versus the log of input amounts. An E of 100% means that the number of

345

molecules of the target sequence double during each replication cycle. The following formula was

346

used: E = 100 x (10-1/slope – 1).

347
348

Positive controls

349

Positive control RNAs generated by in vitro transcription were provided by Sylvie Behillil (Institut

350

Pasteur, Paris, France) for E gene [9] and by Christine Tait-Burkard (Roslin Institute, Edinburgh, UK)

351

for RdRp [13, 14], N1/N3 and N2 [9]. An equimolar mix of all RNAs was prepared at 2.5 x 108

352

copies/µl, and aliquots stored at -80°C. Dilution series were prepared in nuclease-free water, in

353

Eppendorf DNA LoBind tubes (Cat. No. 10051232), at 2,000, 200, 20, 10, 2 and 0.2 copies/µl.

354

A cultured SARS-CoV-2 control (strain hCoV-19/England/02/2020; GISAID Accession EPI_ISL_407073,

355

[27-29]) was provided by Rory Gunson (NHS Molecular Development in Virology and Microbiology,

356

Glasgow, UK). Except for the reported S15519T mismatch in RdRp-SARSr_R1 [19], this strain has no

357

mutations in target sites for the primers and probes used in our assays [30].

358

QCMD controls

360

Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics (Glasgow, UK) provided controls as part of the “QCMD

361

2020 Coronavirus Outbreak Preparedness (CVOP) EQA Pilot Scheme” [31]. RNA extractions were

362

performed using 200 µl of each sample, eluting in 50 µl. After samples were tested blind with our

363

assays, expected results along with sample identities were provided by QCMD. Quantification of

364

control samples was carried out by QCMD prior to distribution within the EQA scheme, using droplet

365

digital PCR (ddPCR) with E-gene primers and probe [13, 14] on the Biorad droplet digital PCR

366

platform. A serial dilution of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (strain BetaCoV/Munich/ChVir984/2020;

367

GenBank Accession MT270112, [32]) was prepared and each dilution replicate tested 4 times using

368

both RT-qPCR and ddPCR assays. Regression analysis was used to assess the linearity across the

369

dilution series, and the analytical measurement range established for both assays, comparing results

370

of each by Bland-Altman difference plot. Except for the reported S15519T mismatch in RdRp-

371

SARSr_R1 [19], this strain has no mutations in target sites for the primers and probes used in our

372

assays [30]. Concentrations determined by ddPCR in Log10 dPCR copies/ml were used to calculate

373

the number of copies of input RNA.

374
375

Statistical analysis

376

To determine whether a linear relationship exists between the observed Cq values for viral probes

377

and the RPP30 (sample quality) probe, we used Pearson’s correlation coefficient and linear

378

regression. Linear regression p-values were calculated using an F-test. Qualitative visual model

379

diagnostics indicated in each case that the statistical assumptions of linear regression models were

380

not violated; in particular the normality and homoscedasticity of residuals. Statistical analysis was

381

performed using R version 4.0.3 [33].

383

Primer/probe mismatch analysis

384

SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19) genome sequences and multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of 131,759

385

strains were downloaded from the GISAID EpiCovTM database [27, 29]. Local alignments were

386

generated between each oligo and the hCoV-19/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 reference strain using

387

biopython’s pairwise2 module [34]. Alignment coordinates were then transposed to the

388

corresponding positions in the MSA. For each strain sequence in the MSA, mismatches and gaps

389

were counted; where mixed bases (IUPAC ambiguity codes with the exception of N) were present in

390

either oligo or strain sequence a position was considered to “match” if there was overlap between

391

the mixed bases. If either oligo sequence or strain sequence contained gaps relative to one another

392

a pairwise local alignment was performed between the oligo and the strain sequence corresponding

393

to the oligo position ± 20 flanking nucleotides in order to detect any ungapped matches between

394

strain sequence and oligo.

395

To ensure only high-quality sequences were included in the analysis, genome sequences with >1%

396

Ns or with gaps ≥ 95th percentile were excluded. Sequences with Ns in oligo regions were also

397

excluded, leaving a total of 97,782 sequences. Code used to count mismatches between strains and

oligos is provided at https://github.com/david-a-parry/SARS-CoV-2_oligos_vs_strains.

High quality genome sequences analysed only (n=97,782).
* 0-0.003% of genomes have deletions in primer/probe binding regions, so majority are mismatches. Presence
of these changes does not necessarily impact on primer/probe performance. Mutations at the 3’ ends for the
primer regions (here defined as the final 5 nt) are more likely to affect assay sensitivity.
** Mismatches/deletions in the primer/probe set used in single target assay
*** Mismatches in the forward and reverse primers only. For probes values are given between brackets for
reference (in the “per primer” column).

Figure 1 | Primers and probes used in our mulƟplex qRT-PCR assays detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
A: LocaƟon of qRT-PCR amplicons on the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Open reading frames (ORFs) and qRT-PCR target
sites (orange, blue) in RdRp, E and N gene indicated. AŌer a -1 ribosomal frameshiŌ (arrow head) on ORF1ab of
the genomic RNA, the pp1ab polypepƟde is formed and RdRp/nsp12 released by proteolyƟc cleavage (doƩed
lines). Genes 3’ of ORF1ab on the posiƟve-sense genome (including E and N) are transcribed (from
negaƟve-sense RNA) as subgenomic RNAs and include a short leader sequence (L, black box) at their 5’ ends [10].
B: qRT-PCR primers (grey) and probes (colour) used in this study. PCR product sizes are indicated between
brackets. Yellow and red lines in RdRp primers indicate degenerate nucleoƟdes and a mismatch respecƟvely (as
present in the original design [14]). To detect RdRp we used the RdRp_SARSr-P2 probe, which detects
2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 and not SARS-CoV. The N1 and N2 assays are specific to SARS-CoV-2 , whereas the E gene
assay also detects SARS-CoV [9,13,14].
C: Probes used in the RdE-RP, N1E-RP and N2E-RP 4-plex assays detect 2 SARS-CoV-2 targets and 2 controls.
D: Using our 4-plex assays, E, N1 and N2 give Cq values (mean ± SD, n = 2 experiments) comparable those for
ORF1ab, S and N from the TaqPath assay (mean of technical triplicates, n = 1 experiment) when detecƟng
cultured SARS-CoV-2.

Figure S4|Increased chance of false negaƟves for low quality NTS samples, with high RPP30
Cq values.
A, B: Comparison of actual (Act) and RPP30-normalised (Norm) Cq values for SARS-CoV-2
targets shows that values cluster more strongly aŌer normalisaƟon, both when normalising to
the worst (highest RPP30 Cq; A) and best (lowest RPP30 Cq; B). Increased clustering (i.e.
reduced variability) demonstrates the impact of the correlaƟon between quanƟty of human
and viral nucleic acids in NTS samples (Fig 4C). This shows 1) that sample quality substanƟally
impacts on assay sensiƟvity and 2) that variability in viral loads is smaller than non-normalised
data suggest. Plots in A demonstrate that 4-6 posiƟves (15-23%) would likely have been below
the detecƟon limit (above the red line, viral Cq > 40) in a worst quality sample scenario.

High quality genome sequences analysed only (n=97,782).
* No genomes have deletions in primer/probe binding regions, with the exception of the S-gene probe, which
has a 6 nt deletion in 0.31% of genome sequences. Presence of these changes does not necessarily impact on
primer/probe performance. Mutations at the 3’ ends for the primer regions (here defined as the final 5 nt) are
more likely to affect assay sensitivity.
** Mismatches/deletions in the primer/probe set used in single target assay
*** Mismatches in the forward and reverse primers only. For probes values are given between brackets for
reference (in the “per primer” column).

High PhHV Cq values (>35; but depending on the exact amount used for spike-in; 2 to 3 cycles above the expected Cq is a good guide) indicate poor RNA isolation and/or
presence of PCR inhibitors. Therefore, any negative (i.e. both SARS-CoV-2 targets not detected) or inconclusive samples (i.e. only one SARS-CoV-2 targets detected) should
be interpreted in this context, and repeat sampling/testing must be performed. This has no impact on positive samples (both SARS-CoV-2 targets detected), which should
still be reported as such.
* The precise RPP30 Cq cut-off value remains to be determined. This requires collection of a much larger amount of data, including repeat sampling of sufficient numbers
of patients with varying RPP30 Cq values and initial negative test results. As an initial guide repeat sampling could be performed for any sample with RPP30 Cq >30. For any
samples with RPP30 Cq values undetermined or >40, repeat sampling is essential, unless both SARS-CoV-2 targets are <40, in which case the test result is positive.

RT‐qPCR
Any Real‐Time qPCR machine that can detect the four different channels and has been calibrated for
the appropriate fluorophores can be used. We use the Applied Biosystems™ 7500 Fast Real‐Time
PCR Systems (channels FAM, JOE, TEXAS RED and CY5) and 7500 Software v2.3, MicroAmp Fast
Optical 0.1mL 96‐well reaction plates (Cat. No. 4346906) and Optical Adhesive film (Cat. No.
4311971). We performed all RT‐qPCRs with Takara One Step PrimeScript™ III RT‐qPCR kit (Cat. No.
RR600B). Other One‐Step mixes are available, but may require slightly different reaction conditions
and may change sensitivity of SARS‐CoV‐2 detection.

[For our assays, we used 25 µl of culture supernatant containing PhHV particles to 25 ml of lysis
buffer. This amount was previously shown to give a Cq value of ~33.]
For each plate, include the following controls:
H10, negative extraction control, VTM extracted;
H11, non‐extraction negative control, water only;
H12, 50 copies of positive control RNA (see below).

Positive control RNA
Positive control RNAs generated by in vitro transcription (IVT) were provided by:
‐ Sylvie Behillil (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France): mix of E gene and RdRp (the latter is not the same as
the Corman et al (2020) RdRp template) [1‐3] at 109 copies/µl.
‐ Christine Tait‐Burkard (Roslin Institute, Edinburgh, UK): RdRp [1, 2], N1/N3 and N2 [3]. Three
individual IVT RNAs at known concentrations (ng/µl) were provided; molecular weights used to
determine the concentrations in copies/µl and 109 copies/µl prepared for each RNA.

Prepare all stocks and dilutions in Eppendorf DNA LoBind tubes (Cat. No. 10051232).
1. Prepare an equimolar mix of all RNAs at 2.5 x 108 copies/µl. Store aliquots of this solution at ‐80°C.
2. Prepare 104 copies/µl positive RNA controls and store 5 µl aliquots at ‐80°C for single use per
plate. Mix 5µl of 2.5 x 108 copies/µl with 620 µl of water to give 2 x 106 copies/µl. Dilute this 20 µl
plus 180 µl water giving a 2 x 105 copies/µl solution, and 20 µl plus 380 µl giving 104 copies/µl.
3. For each plate, a 25 copies/µl solution is made by diluting the 104 copies/µl solution by mixing:
2 µl with 98 µl water, then
12.5 µl of this with 87.5 µl water
Of this 25 copies/µl solution, 2 µl is added to well H12 along with 3 µl of water, to give the
50 copy positive control on each plate.

Supplementary Protocol 2: Viral nucleic acid isolation
In principle, the buffers and solution below can replace those of the equivalent buffers in the Omega
Mag‐Bind Viral DNA/RNA 96 Kit (Cat. No. M6246). Lysis and wash buffers can either be replaced with
guanidine thiocyanate (GnSCN) or guanidine hydrochloride (GnHCl) containing solutions, depending
on reagent availability. In our preliminary tests, all performed equally well (data not shown). All lysis
buffers (Omega TNA, GnSCN Lysis Buffer, GnHCl Lysis Buffer, each with/without isopropanol) were
shown to inactivate coronavirus after 15 min incubation (Fig P1). Briefly, to determine whether lysis
buffers inactivate coronaviruses, 200 µl CoV 229E‐GFP [5, 6] stock (9.6x105 pfu/ml in DMEM, 10%
FCS, 1% NEAA) was mixed with lysis buffer at the recommended ratio (240 µl lysis buffer without
isopropanol or 520 µl lysis buffer with isopropanol, i.e. 240 µl buffer and 280 µl isopropanol). For
positive infection controls, virus was mixed with 240 or 520 µl medium. All mixes were inverted 8
times and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Cytotoxic components were then removed by
centrifugation at 4°C using Microcon filter columns (Millipore; 30 kDa cut‐off), and two 0.5 ml PBS
washes, similar to previously described methods [7, 8]. Remaining virus particles were then
resuspended in 200 µl DMEM and 50 µl of a 1/100 dilution added to HUH7 cells (a cell line
permissive to infection by CoV 229E). Cells were seeded the previous day at 1.8x104/well in a black
96‐well plate (Corning), and were at ~80% confluence for infection. Cultures were monitored daily
for cell viability, cytopathic effects and GFP expression using microscopy. No significant cell death
was observed for any of the samples. Relative fluorescence was measured using a Clariostar BMG
Plate Reader at 72 h, with fluorescence for a non‐infected control set to zero. No fluorescence was
observed for any of the lysis buffer treated samples (Fig P1), and fluorescence microscopy confirmed
the absence of GFP positive cells (data not shown), consistent with complete viral inactivation.

In our preliminary tests, we used the March 2020 version of the protocol provided with the Omega
Mag‐Bind Viral DNA/RNA 96 Kit to test viral nucleic acid isolation with our own solutions and
reagents (see below). We used the Mag‐Bind Particles CNR from the Omega kit, and although we
have not yet tested this, we expect that these can be replaced by SeraSil‐Mag silica beads (Cytiva,
cat No. 29357375). The March 2020 protocol is different from the April 2020 Supplementary
Protocol provided by Omega. The latter was used in combination with original Omega kit
components for all other work presented in our manuscript. We do not see any reasons why our
solutions would not work equally well with the April 2020 version of the protocol, but have not
tested this. All purifications were carried out using a KingFisher Flex robot (Cat. No. 5400610),
KingFisher Deep well plates (Cat. No. 95040450), KingFisher Flex 96 Deep‐Well Tip Combs (Cat. No.
