Abstract

21

SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concerns (VOC), e.g., B.1.351 (20H/501Y.V2) and P1 (20J/501Y.V3),

22

harboring N-terminal domain (NTD) or the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (e.g., E484K)

23

mutations, exhibit reduced in vitro susceptibility to convalescent serum, commercial antibody

24

cocktails, and vaccine neutralization, and have been associated with reinfection. The

25

accumulation of these mutations could be the consequence of intra-host viral evolution due to

26

prolonged infection in immunocompromised hosts. In this study, we document the

27

microevolution of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from sequential tracheal aspirates from an

28

immunosuppressed patient on tacrolimus, steroids and convalescent plasma therapy, and

29

identify the emergence of multiple NTD and RBD mutations associated with reduced antibody

30

neutralization as early as three weeks after infection. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the first

31

swab (Day 0) and three tracheal aspirates (Day 7, 21 and 27) were compared at the sequence

32

level. We identified five different S protein mutations at the NTD or RBD regions from the

33

second tracheal aspirate sample (21 Day). The S:Q493R substitution and S:243-244LA deletion

34

had ~70% frequency, while ORF1a:A138T, S:141-144LGVY deletion, S:E484K and S:Q493K

35

substitutions demonstrated ~30%, ~30%, ~20% and ~10% mutation frequency, respectively.

36

However, the third tracheal aspirate sample collected one week later (Day 27) was

37

predominated by the haplotype of ORF1a:A138T, S:141-144LGVY deletion and S:E484K (>

38

95% mutation frequency). Notably, S protein deletions (141-144LGVY and 243-244LA deletions

39

in NTD region) and substitutions (Q493K/R and E484K in the RBD region) previously showed

40

reduced susceptibly to monoclonal antibody or convalescent plasma. The observation supports

41

the hypothesis that VOCs can independently arise and that immunocompromised patients on

42

convalescent plasma therapy are potential breeding grounds for immune-escape mutants.

Introduction

53

After a year of the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 100 million global cases and 2.80 million

54

deaths, the world is now focused on the biological consequences of the distribution of vaccines

55

and the spread of “Variants of Concerns” (VOC). Three SAR-CoV-2 VOCs, i.e., B.1.1.7

56

(20I/501Y.V1), B.1.351 (20H/501Y.V2) and P1 (20J/501Y.V3) carrying the spike protein N501Y

57

mutation emerged in the UK, South Africa, Brazil and Japan1, and have been associated with

58

high transmissibility due to the increased affinity to the ACE receptor. In each of these viruses,

59

the spike protein contains clustered mutations in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the receptor-

60

binding domain (RBD) (e.g., E484K) regions. Some VOCs carrying these mutations show

61

reduced in vitro susceptibility to convalescent serum, commercial antibody cocktails, and

62

vaccine neutralization, and have been associated with reinfection2,3. The accumulation of these

63

mutations is assumed to be the consequence of intra-host viral evolution due to prolonged

64

infection in immunocompromised hosts4,5. A recent NEJM report from Choi et al.4 described the

65

emergence of antibody escape mutations from an immunocompromised patient 75 days after

66

infection. Here, we document the microevolution of SARS-CoV-2 recovered from sequential

67

tracheal aspirates from an immunosuppressed patient on tacrolimus, steroids and convalescent

68

plasma therapy, and identify the emergence of multiple NTD and RBD mutations associated

69

with reduced antibody neutralization as early as three weeks after infection.

76

detection was performed using the CDI-enhanced COVID-19 test6, targeting SARS-CoV-2 E an

77

N2 genes. The test was approved for use on March 12, 2020 under FDA Emergency Use

78

Authorization for COVID-19 and has a limit of detection less than 20 viral genome copies per

79

reaction. A specimen is considered positive if the gene target has a cycle threshold (Ct) value <

82

SARSCoV2 viral sequencing and genomic analysis

83

SARS-CoV-2 targeted assay libraries were prepared using the AmpliSeq Library Plus and cDNA

84

Synthesis for Illumina kits (Illumina) in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations.

85

Briefly, 20ng of RNA was reverse transcribed followed by amplification of cDNA targets using

86

the Illumina SARS-CoV-2 research panel (Illumina). The amplicons were then partially digested,

87

ligated to AmpliSeq CD Indexes, and then amplified using 18 cycles of PCR. Libraries were

88

quantified using fluorescent-based assays including PicoGreen (Life Technologies), Qubit

89

Fluorometer (Invitrogen), and Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytics). Final libraries were

90

sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (v1 chemistry) with 2x150bp.

91
92

Short read-data were filtered and processed prior to alignment. Read pairs that did not contain a

93

single 19bp seed k-mer in common with the SARS-CoV-2 genome reference (NC_045512.2)

94

were discarded. Adapter sequences and low quality (Q < 20) bases were trimmed from the

95

remaining reads, using Cutadapt v2.1017. Processed reads were then mapped to the SARS-

96

CoV-2 genome reference using BWA-MEM v0.7.1728 and only read pairs with at least one

97

alignment spanning a minimum of 42 bp in the reference and starting before position 29,862 (to

98

exclude polyadenine-only alignments) were kept. Genome sequences were determined by

99

alignment pileup consensus calling with a minimum support of 5 reads using Samtools v1.11

102

calling frequency was set to be 5% to identify within host variations.

103
104

The resulting SARS-CoV-2 viral genome sequences were uploaded to Nextclade server

105

(https://clades.nextstrain.org/) to assign Nextstrain clades11. SARS-CoV-2 lineage was

106

determined using Pangolin v2.3.0 (https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin) and GISAID clade

107

is determined based upon the clade specific marker variants from https://www.gisaid.org12. In

108

addition, 2,282 SARS-CoV-2 genomes with E484K mutation were downloaded from GISAID

109

database12 (date as 2/12/2021), and the genomes with less than 1% ambiguous nucleotides

110

(Ns) and > 28,900 bp were aligned using MAFFT v7.475 12 using default setting. A maximum

111

likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed using IQ-TREE v2.1.213 with automatic model

112

selection and 1000-bootstrap replicates. The resulting tree was annotated using ITOL v514.

Case description

120

A male in early 50s presented to a Northern Jersey hospital with fever, productive cough,

121

generalized myalgias, and progressive shortness of breath for 4 days (Fig1A). He had history of

122

deceased donor kidney transplant for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to HTN,

123

complicated by cellular graft rejection and recurrent collapsing focal segmental

124

glomerulosclerosis. On physical examination, the patient had fever of temperature 102.3F, O2

125

Saturation 90% on 100% non-rebreather. His examination was significant for tachypnea, but

126

otherwise unremarkable. He was admitted under the suspicion of COVID-19 pneumonia. His

127

medications were significant for his immunosuppressive regime of mycophenolic acid,

128

prednisone, and tacrolimus along with multiple anti-hypertensive medications.

129
130

COVID-19 was confirmed to be positive by RT-PCR (Day 0). Chest X-Ray (CXR) revealed

131

dense infiltrates bilaterally reflective of his viral pneumonia. Given his multiple comorbidities,

132

immunosuppressed status, and work of breathing, he was admitted to the ICU for high flow and

133

awake proning and was started on broad spectrum meropenem treatment. His anti-

134

hypertensives were discontinued due to his normotension, and his immunosuppressive regime

135

was continued except for mycophenolate given the likelihood of serious infection.

136
137

He was treated with high-titer convalescent plasma (Day 1) and tocilizumab (Day 2). Due to his

138

worsening respiratory status, the patient was intubated (Day 2). Antibiotics were switched to

139

vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam and then discontinued as the patient was afebrile (Day

140

3). The patient was found to have bilateral deep venous thrombosis and was started on

141

therapeutic heparin (Day 3). Due to worsening hypoxic respiratory failure despite complete

142

support from mechanical ventilation, the patient was subsequently cannulated and placed on

143

veno-venous extra-corporeal oxygenation (ECMO) (Day 5). He went into rapid atrial flutter as

144

well and was started on intravenous amiodarone (Day 5). His renal failure attributed to multiple

145

factors such as his tacrolimus, COVID-19 injury, and hypotension slowly began to improve.

146

Oxygenation began to improve and stabilize, leading to tracheostomy (Day 16) and ECMO

147

explantation (Day 20). The patient, however, became febrile and septic with Enterococcus

148

bacteremia and Proteus mirabilis pneumonia and was restarted on vancomycin and piperacillin-

149

tazobactam (Day 20). He subsequently developed septic shock and was started on

150

vasopressors (Day 21). Following the antibiogram, antibiotics were de-escalated to ampicillin

151

(Day 21) and continued for a 7-day course. The septic shock resolved, and the patient was re-

152

started on his anti-hypertensives once his blood pressure began to remain stable. His course

153

continued to be complicated by periodic desaturations and wide and narrow complex

154

tachycardia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. He slowly improved permitting ventilation and

155

sedation weaning. As his dysphagia was unresolved during his recovery, percutaneous

156

endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube was placed (Day 28) to improve nutritional status. He was

157

transferred to the step-down unit as he continued to recover (Day 49) and was discharged to a

158

long-term care facility (Day 64) requiring ventilatory support only at night. Unexpectedly, the

159

patient expired presumably due to hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to his COVID-19

160

pneumonia (Day 94).

161
162

Genomic analysis

163

SARS-CoV-2 positive qRT-PCR results (Table 1) were obtained from three nasopharyngeal

164

swab samples (on Day 0, 34 and 41) and three tracheal aspirates (on Day 7, 21 and 27); the

165

first swab and the three tracheal aspirates were available for viral genome sequencing (Fig1A).

166

The genotype of the initial swab and tracheal aspirate (Day 7) were identical. The genomes of

167

these two samples harbored 14 mutations (versus Wuhan-Hu-1), and were assigned as

168

Nextstrain clade 20C, Pangolin lineage B.1.369 and GISAID clade GH, distinct from the three

169

501Y VOCs (Fig1B, C). The second tracheal aspirate specimen (from Day 21) showed five

170

different S protein mutations at the NTD or RBD regions. The S protein Q493R substitution and

171

243-244LA deletion had ~70% frequency, while ORF1a A138T, S protein 141-144LGVY

172

deletion, E484K and Q493K substitutions demonstrated ~30%, ~30%, ~20% and ~10%

173

mutation frequency, respectively (Fig1D). However, the third tracheal aspirate sample collected

174

one week later (Day 27) was predominated by the haplotype of ORF1a:A138T, S:141-144LGVY

175

deletion and S:E484K (> 95% mutation frequency) (Fig1D).

176
177

The 141-144LGVY and 243-244LA deletions are located in the recently described “Recurrent

178

Deletion Region” (RDR) 2 and 415, respectively, within the NTD of the spike protein. The

179

appearance of deletions in the RDR region of the spike protein has been observed during

180

prolonged infections in immunocompromised patients and proposed as a mechanism that

181

evades the proofreading activity of the virus and accelerates adaptive evolution. The 141-

182

144LGVY and 243-244LA deletions confer resistance to NTD specific monoclonal antibody in

183

neutralization assays15. The Q493K/R and E484K substitutions are located in the RBD region

184

of the spike protein, and associated with resistance to monoclonal antibodies or convalescent

185

plasma16,17. In particular, the E484K mutation has been linked to the rapid spread of B.1.351

186

and B.1.1.28 variants in South Africa and Brazil, respectively. To date, over 17,000 E484K

187

variants have been identified from >60 countries within various SARS-CoV2 lineages

188

(www.gisaid.org) (Fig2), potentially posing significant challenges to vaccine efficacy and

189

increased reinfection risk. Intriguingly, the co-occurrence of 141-144LGVY and E484K in the

190

third tracheal aspirate specimen completely replaced other mutants, suggesting this haplotype

191

may have compensated for a fitness cost or have higher antibody resistance level.

192
193

Discussion

194

While most immunocompetent hosts are able to achieve resolution of COVID-19 within 1-3

195

weeks after symptoms, there is emerging evidence that a pre-existing immunocompromised

196

state is associated with prolonged infection and significantly increased risk of severe

disease4,5,18,19. Although the immunological mechanisms for control of SARS-CoV-2 in humans

198

have not been clearly elucidated, it is likely that both cytotoxic T-cells and antibody-mediated

199

immune responses are important for clearance of the viral infection18,20. Activation of type I and

200

type III interferons has been postulated to be a key contributor to innate immune control 20,21, in

201

addition to CD8+ effector T-cell–mediated killing of virally infected cells and CD4+ T cell–

202

dependent enhancement of CD8+ and B-cell responses 18,20. Following viral clearance, long-

203

term memory T-cells are formed for prolonged antiviral immunity. Chronic viral infection must

204

evade or suppress some part of this pathway. Moreover, animal studies have shown that

205

chronic viral infections were characterized by persistent antigenic activation of T-cells, ultimately

206

driving a nonresponsive cell state known as T-cell “exhaustion”. This state was often

207

accompanied by lymphopenia20. This patient’s anti-rejection regimen of mycophenolate and

208

tacrolimus targets and inhibits T-cell function and replication, and treatment with prednisone

209

may compromise the ‘proliferative burst’ of effector T-cells 22. While mycophenolate was

210

discontinued, the patient was maintained on tacrolimus and prednisone during his entire

211

hospitalization, which likely further impaired his cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2. In our

212

case, the treatment with convalescent plasma in combination with the routine maintenance of an

213

anti-rejection regiment may have facilitated a “breeding ground” and the emergence of immune-

214

escape mutants. Although we have no evidence that these two escape variants were

215

transmitted, this case suggest that VOCs may arise among immunocompromised populations

216

undergoing anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy, and enhanced measures will be required to reduce

217

transmission.

immunocompromised patient. (A), Clinical timeline of events of the immunocompromised
patient. (B), SARS-CoV-2 genotypes of the major haplotypes from the swab (swab-1) and
tracheal aspirate samples (TA-1, day 7; TA-2, day 21 and TA-3, day 27). (C), The phylogenetic
clades of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The tree was generated using Nextclade
(clades.nextstrain.org). The nodes are highlighted by the Nextstrain clades. The clades
associated with E484K mutations are denoted by red arrows, while the B.1.369 genomes
described in this study are illustrated by a black arrow. (D), The mutation frequency changes
among the swab and tracheal aspirate samples over time.

tree with the 4 patient sequences (B.1.369) and 1,983 selected SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the
GISAID database (date as 2/12/2021) is annotated using iTOL (www.itol.embl.de). The scale
represents 0.0001 nucleotide substitutions per site. The SARS-CoV-2 Pangolin lineage and
country are illustrated as two outer rings in different colors.
