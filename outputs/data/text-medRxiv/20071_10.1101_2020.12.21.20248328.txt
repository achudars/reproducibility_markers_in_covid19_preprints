The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the world since the beginning of 2020. Spain is among the
European countries with the highest incidence of the disease during the first pandemic wave. We
established a multidisciplinar consortium to monitor and study the evolution of the epidemic, with
the aim of contributing to decision making and stopping rapid spreading across the country. We
present the results for 2170 sequences from the first wave of the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic in Spain
and representing 12% of diagnosed cases until 14th March. This effort allows us to document at
least 500 initial introductions, between early February-March from multiple international sources.
Importantly, we document the early raise of two dominant genetic variants in Spain (Spanish
Epidemic Clades), named SEC7 and SEC8, likely amplified by superspreading events. In sharp
contrast to other non-Asian countries those two variants were closely related to the initial variants
of SARS-CoV-2 described in Asia and represented 40% of the genome sequences analyzed. The
two dominant SECs were widely spread across the country compared to other genetic variants
with SEC8 reaching a 60% prevalence just before the lockdown. Employing Bayesian
phylodynamic analysis, we inferred a reduction in the effective reproductive number of these two
SECs from around 2.5 to below 0.5 after the implementation of strict public-health interventions
in mid March. The effects of lockdown on the genetic variants of the virus are reflected in the
general replacement of preexisting SECs by a new variant at the beginning of the summer season.
Our results reveal a significant difference in the genetic makeup of the epidemic in Spain and
support the effectiveness of lockdown measures in controlling virus spread even for the most
successful genetic variants. Finally, earlier control of SEC7 and particularly SEC8 might have
reduced the incidence and impact of COVID-19 in our country.

MAIN
The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 emerged in China in
October/November 20191 and by the end of March of 2020 it was present in most countries of the
world. The World Health Organization declared the new disease as a pandemic on 11th March
2020. Spain suffered a severe epidemic with the first case notified on 29th January2 and with an
accumulated number of 261,584 cases by 1st July, including 29,965 fatalities. Furthermore, a
nationwide seroprevalence study showed that only one in ten cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2
were diagnosed and declared in that period3, suggesting that the total number of infections has
been vastly underestimated. Spain ordered a series of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures
including a general lockdown on 14th March4, later applied by many other countries, and was
successful in bending the curve by the end of May. Despite these measures, at least 30,000
individuals died during the first wave of the epidemic and a second wave of COVID-19 slowly
started by the end of July 20205.
Despite the high incidence accumulated across the country some regions had significantly higher
incidence than others. Genomic epidemiology and phylodynamics6–8 offer a unique opportunity to
understand the early events of the epidemic at the global, regional and local levels, to track the
evolution of the epidemic after its initial stages and to quantify the impact of lockdown measures
on the genetic variants of the virus. However, there are challenges and caveats that prevent the
use of pathogen genomes as the sole source of interpretation. While there is now a large number
of SARS-CoV-2 sequences deposited in the databases9 there are still important unsampled areas
of the world, including some that played an important role in the initial spread of the epidemic. In
addition, the virus spreads faster than it evolves10,11 which limits the resolution of phylogenetic
and phylodynamic analysis12. Finally, despite important efforts by sequencing consortiums, only
a fraction of the total number of infections has been sequenced. Nevertheless, genomic
epidemiology has played an important role in understanding the global and local epidemiology of
COVID-1913–15.
After the pandemic was declared in Spain, we assembled the National Consortium of genomic
epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 (http://seqcovid.csic.es/). This established a unique network
incorporating more than 50 hospitals and scientific institutions across the country to collect clinical
samples and epidemiological information from COVID-19 cases. Here we present the results of
this nation-wide effort. We were able to sequence 12% of the reported cases before the national
lockdown, and 1% of the reported cases of the first wave (until 14th May), including samples of
SARS-CoV-2 across Spain in the early months of the pandemic (February-May). Using a
combination of pathogen genomics, phylogenetic tools, clinical and epidemiological data we have
been able to dissect the very early events in the dispersion of SARS-CoV-2 throughout Spain as
well the evolution of the virus during the exponential phase and after the lockdown. We document
simultaneous introductions in the country from multiple sources. We show that up to 40% of cases
were caused by two Spanish epidemic clades, named SEC7 and SEC8. Seven other Spanish
epidemic clades were detected but their role was minor, probably because they were introduced
relatively close to the lockdown and had no opportunities for a rapid exponential expansion as the

initial two clades had. In contrast to other European countries these SECs belong to early lineages
in the epidemic (A in Pangolin, 19B in NextStrain). We also show that the reproductive number,
Re, of the most successful Spanish epidemic clades quickly declined after the implementation of
lockdown measures and they were completely absent from samples taken in July-September.
Our results suggest that the most successful variants were those associated with earlier
introductions but also that their success may depend on the synergy between superspreading
events and high mobility. These results also show the effectiveness of lockdown measures in
controlling the virus spread and eliminating established successful epidemic clusters from
circulation.
SARS-CoV-2 was introduced multiple times from multiple sources
Our dataset consists of 2,170 sequences from Spain, collected under ethical approval, from 25th
February to 22nd June, coinciding with the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country
(Figure 1a). The most populated Spanish regions were sampled, resulting in a dataset with
sequences representing 16 of the 17 administrative regions in which the country is divided (Figure
1b). 1,962 out of the 2,170 (90.4%) samples analyzed here have been sequenced by the
SeqCOVID consortium, while the remaining 208 have been generated by independent
laboratories and downloaded from GISAID9 (Table S1). Spain displayed a particular viral
population structure with a higher proportion of lineage A sequences compared to other European
countries16(Figure 1c). Strains from patients in Spain were more closely related with cases
sequenced in China and were the most abundant during the first weeks of the Spanish epidemic.
They were replaced by lineage B strains (Figure S1), which differ by at least 6-7 substitutions
from lineage A and dominated the beginning of the pandemic in most European countries. In
addition, we observed an heterogeneous distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity within
Spain, both at the regional and local levels. For example, our analysis shows how viral diversity
declined with geographic distance from a large urban outdoor like Valencia (see Supplementary
Notes).
Similarly to other countries17,18, phylogenomic analyses suggest the existence of multiple
independent entries of the virus into Spain. To identify possible introductions we inspected the
placement of Spanish viral samples in a global phylogeny constructed with more than 30,000
sequences (Figure 1d). Given the low genetic diversity of the virus, particularly at the beginning
of the epidemic, we found most instances in which a Spanish sample is genetically identical to
other variants circulating in the rest of the world. According to their phylogenetic placement, three
different possibilities were considered for the phylogenetic position of Spanish sequences. A
sequence was included in a ‘candidate transmission cluster’ when it was found in a monophyletic
clade with other Spanish sequences; it was included in a ‘zero distance’ group when it grouped
with other genetically identical Spanish sequences but also with other foreign sequences; and it
was denoted as ‘unique’ when no matching sequence in the Spanish dataset was identified (see
detailed definitions of the groups in Mat and Met and in Figure S2). We detected 224 ‘candidate
transmission clusters’ comprising 827 sequences (~40% of the Spanish samples); 30 ‘zerodistance clusters’, comprising 831 sequences, and 513 ‘unique’ sequences (Figures S3). Next,
we determined how many unique cases and clusters were compatible with an introduction before

the general lockdown. We detected that 191 groups (165 'candidate transmission clusters’ plus
26 ‘zero distance clusters’) and 328 unique sequences met this criteria, representing at least 519
independent introductions (distribution of dates in Figure 1e). This is probably an underestimation
of the total number of entries because the number of sequences analyzed is a small subset of the
total notified cases (Figure 1a). Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the most likely introductions
of cases with a clear phylogenetic link (see Methods) came from Italy, the Netherlands, England,
and Austria (accounting for ~23%, ~20%, ~13% and 12% of the cases for which a likely country
of origin can be inferred, respectively) (Figure 1f). The observation that more than half of the
introduction events detected are unique sequences illustrates the heterogeneous outcome after
an introduction, as some events resulted in large epidemiological clusters, and others
disappeared leaving almost no trace. A clear example is the first described death in Spain for
which we have generated a partial sequence and who was infected in Nepal but who did not
generate any identifiable secondary cases in our dataset.

To identify those introductions that resulted in sustained transmission and therefore
epidemiologically successful in the long-term, we scanned the phylogeny for larger clades mainly
composed by Spanish samples (see Mat and Met for criteria). We identified 9 Spanish Epidemic
Clades (SEC) distributed across the phylogeny, representing 46% of the total Spanish dataset
analyzed (995 out of 2,170 samples) (Figure 2a, Figure S4, Figure S5, Table S1, Table S2). We
first noticed that only two SECs encompassed 30% and 10% of all Spanish samples (SEC8 and
SEC7, respectively). This implies that the introduction of these two specific genetic variants
explains a high proportion of the entire epidemic for the first wave in the country. In fact, they were
responsible for 44% of the ‘candidate transmission clusters’ identified before the lockdown (Figure
2b). We then estimated the time of introduction in Spain for the 9 SECs using a Bayesian
approach (Table S2). As a conservative estimate we considered the time of introduction as any
time between the age of the most recent common ancestor of the SEC and the date of the first
Spanish sample (Figure 2c). Thus, we assume that the ancestor of the SEC was not necessarily
in Spain.

A few genetic variants dominated the first wave in Spain

Our analysis shows that the earlier the introduction, the larger the size of the SEC (Figure S6).
The larger clades, SEC7 and SEC8, were the first successful genetic variants introduced into
Spain during late January - February (Figure 2b). Both belong to lineage A (Pangolin
nomenclature) and partially explain the peculiar population structure in Spain relative to other
European countries (Figure 1c). In addition, compared with other SECs, SEC7 and SEC8 were
widely spread in the country, being present in at least 10 of the 17 administrative regions (Figure
2b) and had a mean pairwise geographic distance between samples of more than 300 km
regardless whether or not the Islas Canarias and Baleares are included (Figure S7). On the
contrary, SECs that were introduced later were smaller and showed a narrower geographic
spread (between 0 - 58 km, ANOVA adjusted p-value << 0.01, Supplementary Notes).

Superspreading events and mobility were key for the success of SEC8
Why some genetic variants succeed over others cannot be answered solely from genomic
sequence data. We must also take into account the epidemiological dynamics in the country.
There is data supporting a role of the 614G mutation in the spike protein associated with
epidemiological success. However, SEC7 and SEC8 do not harbour the variant, explaining why
614G was less frequent during the first weeks of the epidemic in Spain than in other countries
(Figue S8). In addition, the inspection of signature positions for both SECs did not lead to any

In a first phase, SEC8 was introduced at least twice from Italy to the city of Valencia (Figure 3a).
There is epidemiological evidence that both cases were infected in Italy, as they attended the
Atalanta-Valencia Champions League football match on 19th February, and that one of them
initiated a transmission chain upon returning to Valencia a few days later. This epidemiological
link strongly suggests that the SEC8 genetic variant was imported from Italy. This introduction
occurred in agreement with the estimated time of entry of SEC8 into Spain (Table S2). NextStrain
tracking tools for viral spatial spread suggests additional SEC8-related early seedings in Madrid,
País Vasco, Andalucía, and La Rioja regions (Video S1) which may involve other countries, not
necessarily Italy. Given the lack of virus genetic differentiation and scarce epidemiological
information there is no certainty on whether they resulted from independent introductions from
abroad or from internal migrations of infected persons, although the simultaneous detection in
different regions favours the first option. Most of these multiple introductions occurred during the
second half of February, a period in which more than 11,000 daily entries of travelers from Italy
were recorded.

In a second phase, SEC8 was fueled by superspreading events. Based on the topology of the
phylogenetic tree (Figure 2a) there were multiple clades involving a large number of very closely
related sequences (1-3 SNPs) (Figure 3a). Of special relevance was a funeral on 23rd February
with attendees from the País Vasco and La Rioja regions from which 25 sequences had been
sequenced. Importantly, although they did not differ by more than 2 SNPs these sequences are
spread across the SEC8 phylogeny suggesting the existence of many more non-sampled
secondary cases across the country (Figure 3a). In a third phase, SEC8, after reaching high
frequency locally, was redistributed across the country and in less than two weeks it reached a
prevalence of 60% among the sequenced genomes (Figure 3b), being present in almost every
region analysed. All these phases occurred between the first known diagnosed SEC8 case on
25th February (Table S2) and the lockdown on 14th March, highlighting the need for very early
containment measures to stop the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

In the second half of March, Spain imposed a strict lockdown on non-essential services and
movements. A Bayesian birth-death skyline analysis allowed us to evaluate the impact of the
lockdown on the effective reproductive number (Re) of the most successful SECs. The analyses
of SEC7 (Figure S9) and SEC8 (Figure 3c) resulted in similar estimates for Re before the lockdown
(2.10 with 95% highest posterior density, HPD:1.67-2.62 and 3.14 HPD: 2.71-3.57, respectively)
similar to the Re estimated early in the epidemic for SARS-CoV-219,20. After the lockdown there
was a substantial decrease to less than 0.5 in both cases (0.27 95% HPD: 0.06-0.47; 0.23 HPD:
0.15-0.32, respectively). The model also estimated that the date with highest support for a change
in Re roughly coincides with the start of the lockdown in Spain on 14th March (20th March HPD:
15-25th March; 9th March HPD: 8-10th March, respectively). In addition, we calculated the doubling
time for both SECs21. Before the corresponding date of change for Re, the doubling time for SEC7
was estimated at 6.3 days (95% HPD: 4.3-10.2 days) and that for SEC8 at 3.3 days (95% HPD:

both SECs (see Supplementary Notes), a result that supports the reduction in the rate of increase
of confirmed cases and that is in agreement with estimates from epidemiological models and
data19,20.

Our analyses have revealed more than 500 independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 to Spain
between late January, coinciding with the first reported cases in our country2,22, and mid-April
2020. The earliest entries corresponded to lineage A, matching the virus diversity profile reported
for the country. This lineage was common in Asia but rare in the rest of Europe23. We observed
that two genetic variants (SEC7 and SEC8) of this lineage dominated the first stages of the
epidemic wave in Spain contrary to what was observed in other European countries. In fact, most
cases described in Europe at the beginning were lineage B what makes the situation in Spain
more unique. This highlights the importance of epidemiological data in which we know that SEC8
was introduced at least from Italy contradicting the dominant lineages in the country at that
time16,24,25.
Reasons for why some variants dominate over others can be related to the viral genetics, to
founder events associated to particular variants, and to the implementation of different measures
over time, not necessarily in an exclusive manner. This variant distribution could also be partly
explained by sampling bias. No mutation likely associated with epidemiological success has been
identified in our analyses of SEC7 and SEC8 (Table S3). In fact, neither SEC7 nor SEC8 carry
the 614G mutation in the spike protein contrary to what is seen in most, but not all, lineage B
variants (Figure S8). The mutation 614G has been associated with increased viral shedding
compared to the ancestral 614D variant in laboratory conditions26 and in transmission studies27,28.
However, other studies cast doubts on its actual role in the epidemic29 suggesting that its impact
on epidemic transmission was minor, if any. In the case of Spain, 614G was not behind the initial
success of the epidemic because SEC7 and particularly SEC8 were much more common than
other genetic variants until the lockdown (10% and 30% of cases respectively). On the contrary,
founder events seem to have played an important role for these particular variants. Our analysis
shows that they were the first variants introduced in the country and, at least SEC8, were linked
to very early superspreading events that contributed to their success. However, an early
introduction of lineage A variants also occurred in other European countries but they did not take
hold and were displaced by lineage B. Despite the early adoption of strong NPI measures, we
hypothesize that epidemic control in the first wave in Spain was soon overwhelmed as compared
to countries that controlled early outbreaks13. This was likely associated with a strict
implementation of the case definition by the WHO, which allowed a stealth dispersion of the first
introductions, but also to several superspreading events, which strongly favoured the
establishment of the earliest variants arriving into the country. Spain implemented one of the most
strict lockdowns in Europe with a high compliance from the population as tracked by mobility
data30. The efficacy of NPI measures was evident a few weeks later and it was reflected in the
almost complete elimination of SEC7 and SEC8 by the end of the first wave. The spread of new
variants, represented by other SECs and more isolated cases, corresponded to a new phase in
the epidemic at the national level, with much more limited mobility and social interactions which
prevented the establishment of large clusters and transmission chains except in high risk settings
such as nursing-homes and long-term care facilities.
This study has several limitations. Despite being one of the countries with more contribution to
public repositories, our dataset only represents a small subset of confirmed cases that occurred
in the first COVID-19 wave (1% of cases). Moreover, sampling across the country was

We believe that our results allow us to draw lessons for the control of this and future pandemics.
First, we have shown how specific variants can be used to track the effectiveness of epidemic
control measures. In February, the number of SEC8 cases was just a few dozens and yet it ended
up accounting for 60% of the sequenced samples in the first weeks of March. Second, the closure
of borders to countries with high incidence is relevant to reduce simultaneous and multiple imports
of the virus, but its efficacy depends on the inward incidence of the disease31. The most successful
SECs during the first wave were probably those that arrived early, multiple times, and to diverse
locations. Thus, as suggested elsewhere, founder effects are important for the success of certain
variants. Third, SEC7 and SEC8 extended across Spain in a matter of days. Controlling mobility
is essential when the level of community transmission is high, as demonstrated by the significant
decrease in Re for these high-transmission genetic variants after the lockdown. As a comparison,
before the lockdown Re values were 50% higher in Spain (3.3 for SEC8) than in Australia (1.63),
and they underwent a reduction down to 7% of the original value (0.23) as a result of the
containment measures, compared to 30% (0.48) in Australia15. From a public health perspective,
our results add to the evidence that the success of specific genetic variants is fueled by
superspreading events which rapidly increase the prevalence of the virus32. Subsequently,
coupled to the high mobility of our connected world, a variant may end up dominating the epidemic
in a geographic location. This is what occurred to SEC8 and what at a local level has been
described in Boston33. In fact, we have recently described a new variant in Europe that is rapidly
growing in several countries, which is also linked to initial superspreading events34. The
conclusion is that early diagnosis and notification of cases would have helped to a timely
implementation of effective contact tracing that, coupled with earlier mobility closures and maybe
tighter border control, would have probably delayed a few days the expansion of genetic variants
such SEC8 during the early stages of the epidemic in Spain. Whether this might have changed
the global shape of the epidemic in the country or other genetic variants would have performed
its role leading to a similar outcome cannot be ascertained, but the comparison with other
countries lead us to suspect that there would have been not many differences with them.

heterogeneous and the representation of each region in the dataset was not always proportional
to the incidence during the studied period. Lack of genome data from countries with high disease
burden, especially at the beginning of the pandemic, may have led to underestimating the total
number of introductions and prevented a reliable identification of their likely sources based only
on viral genome sequences. In addition, we did not have access to individual patient data for most
cases. Despite these limitations, we have been able to investigate some of the key cases and
events that ignited the epidemic in Spain. This allowed us to understand the origin and early
spread of SEC8, which would not have been possible based only on genome data. But we have
also shown that genetic data can be used to accurately estimate relevant epidemiological
parameters such as Re and doubling times even when the proportion of sampling is low.

week (number of weeks since 2019-12-23) as plotted in Microreact.
-Figure S2: Examples of the different groups of sequences identified. ‘Candidate
transmission clusters’ are groups of Spanish sequences that form a clade. ‘Zero distance clusters’
are groups of Spanish sequences that are at zero distance from each other. Finally, the ‘unique’
sequences are Spanish sequences that are more than 1 SNP away from any other Spanish
sequence and that do not share a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) node with other Spanish
sequences
-Figure S3: Distribution of the different clusters/groups sizes in Spanish samples.
-Figure S4: Number of international and Spanish sequences in each SEC.
-Figure S5: Phylogenetic location of each SEC in the global SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny.
Sequences from Spain are coloured according to their SEC (as indicated in Figure 2) while
international sequences remain in black colour.
-Figure S6: Time of the MRCA of each SEC plotted against the contribution of each SEC
to the total number of samples in the Spanish dataset. We observed a significant correlation (⍴=0.69, p-value=0.03) between the time of the MRCA of each SEC and its size, estimated as the
number of samples sequenced.
-Figure S7: Distribution of genetic (salmon) versus geographic (grey) distances within
each pair of samples belonging to the same SEC.

mutations in the sequenced samples by date. The national lockdown event is marked by a purple
vertical line.
-Figure S9: Phylodynamic estimates of the effective reproductive number (Re) of Spanish
SEC7. A birth–death skyline (BDSKY) model was implemented in Beast v.2, allowing for
piecewise changes in Re, with the time and magnitude estimated from the data. The X axis
represents time, starting with the MRCA of all sampled diversity within SEC7 and ending with the
date of the most recently sequenced genome from 15th May. The blue dotted line indicates the
posterior value of the timing of a most significant decrease in Re, around 20th March [95% HPD:
15–25th March]. The Y axis represents Re, and the violin plots show the posterior probability
distribution for this parameter before and after the change time in Re; with a mean of 2.10 [95%
HPD: 1.67–2.62] and 0.27 [95% HPD:0.06–0.47] before and after this time, respectively. The
phylogenetic tree in the background is the maximum clade credibility tree from the BDSKY
analysis, with the tips colored according to whether they were sampled before or after 20th March.

between the largest cities (> 70k inhabitants) of the Comunidad Valenciana autonomous region.
- Figure S11: Left) Heatmap of genetic diversity for the province of Valencia; red colors
indicate high diversity; blue colors indicate lower diversity. Genetic diversity has been measured
as the number of base substitutions per site averaged over all sequence pairs within each
municipality. Genetic diversity is largest near Valencia, the region’s capital, and decreases with
geographic distance to it. Right) All sequences included in our dataset from Comunidad
Valenciana, coloured according to the pangolin lineage they belong to.
