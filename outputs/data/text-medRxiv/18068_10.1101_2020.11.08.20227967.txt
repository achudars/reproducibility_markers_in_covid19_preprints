Abstract

20

Background: The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic as a large scale stressor could

21

have negative distress on the mental health on medical students. Since gender differences in

22

mental health may exist between males and females, it would prove interesting to see if a large

23

scale stressor such as the pandemic will cause variances in the psychological distress between

24

both genders.This study assessed and compared the psychological distress of COVID-19 among

25

male and female medical students in medical schools in South-Western Nigeria

26

Materials and methods: A cross-sectional online survey using was carried out among 1010

27

medical students from three largest universities in south western Nigeria during the COVID-19

28

pandemic. The respondents were purposively selected, data was obtained on participants

29

demographic and psychological distress was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire 12

30

(GHQ-12). Data was analyzed using the SPSS version 21 statistical software, chi square was

31

used to assess gender differences, multivariate regression analysis assessed the predictors of

32

psychological distress among both gendersand p values less than 0.05 were considered

33

significant.

34

Results: Female medical students are at a higher risk of psychological distress compared to their

35

male counterparts (p<0.005). Females were almost twice at risk of psychological distress during

36

the COVID-19 pandemic than males (OR=1.534, 95% p=0.003). Females with a positive history

37

of mental illness were five times more at risk of psychological distress during the COVID-19

38

pandemic compared to females with no previous mental health history (OR=5.102, p=0.002)

Introduction

46

The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome

47

coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2), which is highly transmissible and has been a cause for worldwide

48

concern [1]. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China in December 2019 [2], the virus

49

has expressed high rates of rapid transmission. It was declared a pandemic on the 11th March,

50

2020 after more than 118,319 confirmed cases and 4,292 deaths had been recorded from various

51

continents of the world [3]. Shortly before this declaration, Nigeria, the most populous country in

52

Africa, recorded her first case on the 27th February, 2020 [4]. As at the 24th of October 2020,

53

Nigeria had a total of 61,930 confirmed cases with 1,129deaths. Almost half (49%) of these

54

cases are in south-west states of the country [5].

55

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) mental health is "a state of well-being in

56

which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life,

57

can work productively and is able to make a contribution to his or her community" [6].

58

A person’s mental health is influenced by social and economic conditions like family, school and

59

social support among other factors [7]. It is widely believed that social ties play a positive part in

60

the preservation of one’s mental health [8]. In a bid to curb the spread of the COVID-19 there

61

has been a disruptionin social life due to the advent of measures like social distancing, lockdown,

62

self-isolation and quarantine. Apart from the social distancing, there is also the possibility of fear

63

and uncertainty in the hearts of many concerning the novel coronavirus which may pose a risk to

64

their mental health [9]. Moreso, several nations have also suffered from economic recessions as a

65

result of the adverse distress of COVID-19 on the economy, leading to loss of employment or

66

reduction in income which could negatively affect mental health [10].

67

Gender differences in mental health may exist between males and females, with females

68

observed to have a higher prevalence in mental health disorders compared to males. Thismay be

69

because females are exposed to risk factors such as gender inequality, gender-based violence and

70

gender discrimination [11]. A mental health survey carried out in Lagos StateNigeria for the

71

assessment of mental health disorder symptoms, revealed significant gender differences with

72

females showing higher prevalence [12]. Since strategies for identification, prevention and

73

treatment of mental disorders may be based on gender [13], there is a need for a gender specific

74

study when measuring the psychological distress of any population.

75

Previous studies have shown that the predisposing factors to mental health disorders are gender

76

specific [14-17]. It would prove interesting to see if a large scale stressor such as the pandemic

77

will cause a change in the psychological distress between males and females and help us know if

78

these variances can be characterized as COVID-19 related, hence this study.

79

This study assessed and compared the psychological distress of COVID-19 among male and

80

female medical students in medical schools in South-Western Nigeria. It also assessed the risk

81

factors associated with psychological distress among male and female medical students. It is

82

hoped that the study findings will be useful for policy makers in the educational sector and

83

provide information useful in tailoring the medical curriculum to suit the peculiar needs of

84

medical students during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

85
86

87

Materials and methods

88

This was a descriptive cross-sectional study thatcompared the psychological distress between

89

male and female medical students of the three largest Colleges of Medicine in the South-western

90

regions of Nigeria. The Colleges are: College of Medicine, University of Ibadan (COMUI),

91

College of Medicine, University of Lagos (CMUL) and Lagos University Teaching Hospital

92

(LASUCOM). Purposive sampling was used to select the three largest medical schools in South-

93

western Nigeria, which the study was carried out. Convenience sampling method was used in

94

recruiting eligible male and femalerespondents (medical and dental undergraduates ofthe three

95

universities), who participated in the study.

96

Data collection

97

This survey was conducted from June 22 to July 16, 2020. This was about 4-5 months after the

98

first case of COVID-19 were reported in Nigeria. Because it was not feasible to do a face-face

99

sampling survey during the on-going pandemic, data was collected using an online survey

100

platform (Google forms https://forms.gle/19yfEzehJKwsme759). Relying on the authors’

101

networks with colleagues in the three universities, a recruitment poster was created and posted to

102

the class online platform in the three colleges. This poster contained a brief introduction on the

103

background, voluntary nature of participation, declarations of anonymity and confidentiality, as

104

well as the link code of the online questionnaire. Persons, who are medical students of the three

105

colleges, understood the content of the poster and agreed to participate in the study were

106

instructed to complete the questionnaire by clicking the link.

107

Survey instrument

108

The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), a self-administered screening tool was used to

109

assess individuals with psychological distress [18]. It was developed in 1970 by Sir David

110

Goldberg and Paul Williams [19]; the twelve item GHQ-12 is the most extensively used

111

screening instrument for common mental disorders, in addition to being a more general measure

112

of psychiatric well-being. It assesses the severity of mental problems over the past few weeks. Its

113

brevity makes it attractive for use [18,19]. Its psychometric properties have been studied in

114

various countries and in several sub-populations, including in Nigeria [20,21].

115

GHQ scoring

116

The bimodal scale was used in this study to grade the participants risk of psychological distress

117

during the pandemic, with a score of 0 given to the ‘Not at all’ and ‘No more than usual’

118

responses while a score of 1 is given to the ‘Same as usual’ and ‘much less than usual’ response.

119

A total summation of the scores between 0 and 12 was collated for the responses selected by

120

each participants, scores ≤ 2 implies that the participants have ‘No risk of psychological

121

distress’, whereas scores ≥ 3 implies that participants are ‘At risk of psychological distress’.

Data analysis

124

Data collected was analyzed with SPSS 21 statistical software for windows (version 21.0 SPSS

125

Inc, Chicago IL). Categorical variables were expressed in frequency tables with the

126

corresponding percentages while normally distributed continuous variables were expressed as

127

means and standard deviations. Chi square was used to assess gender differences in categorical

128

and continuous variables respectively. A multivariate regression analysis was used to identify the

129

predictors of psychological distress first among the general participants, and subsequently for

130

males and females separately. p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant

131

Ethical considerations: Ethical approval was obtained from Research and Ethics Committee of

132

the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, with HREC assigned number:

133

LUTHHREC/EREV/0620/56. Informed consent (online) was obtained from the participants

134

before the commencement of the study. Participation was voluntary and Confidentiality assured

135

to all respondents. Data was stored anonymously in a password-protected database

136

Results

137

The socio-demographic characteristics of study participants are shown in Table 1. The total

138

number of data collected for male respondents was 486 and that of females, 524.

The mean age of female respondents was 21.28 ± 2.5 years and made up more than half (54.7%)

144

of respondents who had a family monthly income greater than 100,000 naira. More females

145

(65.5%) constitute the group of respondents who reported to have been previously diagnosed

146

with a mental condition and also made up 64.7% of respondents who had a relative/acquaintance

147

diagnosed of COVID-19. In comparison, the mean age of males was 22.43±3.2 years which were

148

higherthan the mean age of females. Male respondents constitute less than half (45.3%) of

149

respondents who had a family income greater than 100,000 naira. Fewer male (34.5%)

150

constituted the group of respondents’ whoreported having ever been diagnosed of a mental

151

illness and males made up 35.3% of respondents who had relatives/acquaintances diagnosed of

Psychological distress assessment

155

From the results in Table 2, more females reported they had lost much sleep over worry (53.9%),

156

been feeling depressed (56.2%) and been thinking of themselves as worthless (54.1%), ‘Rather

157

more than usual’, than the male gender (46.1%, 43.8% and 45.9% respectively).

Female respondents had higher risk of psychological distress compared to males. However, the

predictors of psychological distress among the female participants are age, family income greater

Discussion

201

The findings our study showed that the pandemic had a negative psychological impact on the

202

respondents and agrees with Gupta et al, which stated that the negative psychological impact on

203

the participants was greater during the lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic [22]. From their

204

survey, it was reported that the pandemic and lockdown increased mental morbidity among the

205

general public [22] and the number of increasing cases resulted in an extension of the lockdown

206

and curfews [22]. However, the results from our study and that of Gupta et al, contradict the

207

claims of Yun Li et al [23] where all participants had low mean scores for anxiety and

208

depression. This reason for this unusual finding may be because, as at the time of study, the

209

number of COVID-19 cases was fewer compared to the latter period.

210

Our study reports that there is a significant gender difference in the psychological distress on

211

medical students with females constituting a majority (60%) of the population at risk of

212

psychological distress, this finding agrees with existing evidence from Ochilbek et al, which

213

stated that females were at a higher risk of psychological distress than males [24]. In the study by

214

Ochilbek and Senol, there was a significant gender difference as women had higher anxiety and

215

depressionscores than men which confirm our results. The findings from our study further

216

supports a study by Rodríguez-Rey et al which also revealed women showed significantly higher

217

levels in anxiety, stress and depression [25]. In addition, a similarsurvey by Li G et al found out

218

that female healthcare workers were more exposed to the psychological threat of COVID-19 than

219

male healthcare workers [26]. However, the significant gender difference in this study is in

220

contrast with findings from a similar pre-pandemic study which showed gender not to be

14

221

significant in the psychological impact on the students. This may be because their study was

222

done in the absence of a large scale stressor such as the pandemic [27].

223

Our results from the regression analysis indicated that female participants with family income

224

greater than #50,000 are at risk of psychological distress compared to femaleparticipants who

225

had lower family income. This is consistent with the study by Tull et al which discovered that

226

income level was uniquely inversely associated with anxiety, financial worry and loneliness

227

during the COVID-19 pandemic [28]. Our study also agrees with Saurabh et al which found out

228

that the psychological problems of children and adolescents was mainly associated with loss of

229

father's job, financial losses of family and unavailability of basic life needs [29].

230

Furthermore, our regression analysis showed that female respondents who have been previously

231

diagnosed with a mental disorder are also at increased risk of psychological distress, compared to

232

female respondents who have never been diagnosed of a mental health condition. This finding

233

further buttresses the theory that there is an association between mental disorders and stressful

234

events.

235

This study is among the first few gender comparative studies in Nigeria that assessed the

236

psychological distress of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students, it also featuresa large

237

sample size of 1010 distressamong Nigerian medical students. However it has some limitations

238

and the findings should be interpreted with some caution.

239

Information obtained was collected using an online self-administered questionnaire indicating

240

the possibility of selection bias. Furthermore, the results cannot be generalized to the

241

entirecountry because it was limited to participants in three universities only in the South West

242

region of Nigeria. There is also a possibility for recall bias and causal inferences cannot be made

243

since due to the cross-sectional nature of the study

244

A more representative sample and a broader study involving colleges of medicine across the

245

entire country would provide more generalized and accurate estimate of the gender comparison

246

of the psychological distress of COVID-19 in medical students.

247
248

Conclusion

249

Females were at higher risk of psychological distress compared to male students emphasizing the

250

need for gender specific interventions for psychological distress among medical students. Also,

251

future research to establish the long term psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on

252

medical students is recommended.
