Abstract

11

A comprehensive understanding of the transmission routes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome

12

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is of great importance for the effective control of the spread of Corona

13

Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Human-to-human transmission by close contact where large

14

respiratory droplets play a significant role has been established as the main transmission route. At the

15

same time the transmission by small aerosol is getting increasing attention. There is no distinct

16

boundary between droplets and aerosol in nature so it is natural to investigate the infection risk due

17

to aerosol. Here, we utilized a newly developed dose-response relation, combined with a box model

18

for the exposure estimation, to quantitatively evaluate the infection risk of SARS-CoV-2 through

19

aerosol transmission and compared with the risk due to close contact. The results indicated that the

20

median infection risk via aerosol transmission was about 3.7×10-5 (95% confidence interval: 3.5×10-6

21

to 4.4×10-4) for one hour of exposure in a room with the size of 10 m (width)×10 m (length)×3 m

22

(height) with one infected individual in it. The risk was more than three orders of magnitude lower

23

than the risk at short distance, about 12.8% within 1 m, based on a meta-analysis. A simple

24

exponential regression model Risk=10-0.90×D+0.10 (D<=5 m) could be utilized to characterize the

25

magnitude of infection risk in the considered scenario based on the distance D from the infected

26

individual. With prolonged exposure duration and large exposed population, the infection caused by

27

aerosol transmission could be considerable, thus it is necessary to be cautious for the potential

28

aerosol transmission risk in such situations.

A comprehensive understanding of the transmission routes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome

32

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is of great importance for the effective control of the spread of Corona

33

Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). A recent open letter from 239 scientists 1 appealed to the relevant

34

communities and organizations to recognize the potential airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2

35

through microscopic respiratory particles (aerosols).

36

A quantitative assessment of the infection risk through different transmission routes is essential to

evaluate their relative importance and to prioritize the control measures. A recent study by Chu et al.

at further distance through a systematic review and meta-analysis on the betacoronaviruses causing

COVID-19. However, the studies for aerosol transmission risk are still scarce in part due to the lack

43

of dose-response relation.

has estimated the infection risk by close contact, which was about 12.8% within 1 m and about 2.6%

44
45

Recently, we developed a simple framework 3 to deduce the dose-response relation for coronaviruses,

46

by integrating the a priori dose-response relation for SARS-CoV 4 based on mice experiments, the

47

recent data on infection risks from COVID-19, SARS and MERS meta-analysis

52

An exponential model, p=1−exp(−d/k), was adopted for the dose-response relation, where p is the

53

infection risk, d is the exposure dose, and k is the pathogen dependent parameter. It was estimated

54

that k was from 6.2×104 to 7.3×105 virus copies dependent on the contributions of the airborne

55

virus-laden particles to the total infection risk 3. The value of k was about 1.5×105 if the aerosol

56

transmission contributed half of the infection risk. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to assess

57

the risk. Here, it was assumed that k was a stochastic variable following the triangular distribution

58

with lower limit, upper limit and mode of 6.2×104, 7.3×105 and 1.5×105 copies.

59
60

To illustrate the relative importance of aerosol transmission compared to that of close contact, we

61

considered a simple scenario of a room with the size of 10 m (width)×10 m (length)×3 m (height).

62

The typical ventilation rate for offices 6, 1 ACH (Air Changes per Hour), was adopted for the

63

scenario. One infected individual was assumed to be at the center of the room. The infection risk of

64

close contact from the meta-analysis

65

minimum of 1 h. Representative exposure duration of 1 h was utilize for the development of the

66

dose-response relation. It is close to the total duration of close contact between a nurse / health

67

worker and a patient per day 7. One hour of exposure in the room was also adopted for the

68

assessment of the infection risk here.

was induced by various durations from any duration to a

69
70

A box model 8 was utilized to estimate the virus concentration and deposition in the room. The box

71

model assumed that the airborne virus-laden particles were well mixed and the virus concentration

72

was homogeneous in the room. A recent study based on computational fluid dynamics 9 indicated the

73

aerosol mainly remained below 2 m for indoor environment, so 2 m was utilized as the mixing height

74

instead of the room height (3 m). Four key processes were considered in the model, i.e. viral

75

shedding, biologic decay, ventilation and deposition. Recently, Leung et al. 5 has shown that the viral

76

shedding (Evirus) was about 102 to 105 virus copies with a geometric mean of about 104 copies in the

77

samples of respiratory particles from the symptomatic individuals infected by coronavirus (NL63,

78

OC43, HKU1 and 229E) for 30 min. In the Monte Carlo simulations, the viral shedding was a

79

stochastic variable following the distribution log10(Evirus)~Normal(4, 0.5). The half-life period of the

80

virus also followed the triangular distribution with the lower limit, upper limit and mode of log10(0.5),

81

log10(100) and log10(10) based on the data reported in the literature8. The deposition velocities were

82

estimated following the method proposed by Lai et al. 10 based on the size distribution 11 of particles

83

generated by breathing and coughing. For the exposure estimation, the total respiratory volume was

84

assumed to be 0.6 m3 per hour and the deposition of particles in the respiratory system was estimated

85

by lung deposition model for bioaerosols12.

86
87

The results indicated that the median infection risk to contract COVID-19 via the aerosol route was

88

about 3.7×10-5 (95% confidence interval: 3.5×10-6 to 4.4×10-4) for one hour of exposure, which was

89

more than three orders of magnitude lower than the risk due to close contact (about 12.8% within 1

90

m) based on the meta-analysis 2. It is reasonable to assume that 5 m is far enough to prevent the

91

transmission routes of close contact (direct/indirect) or large respiratory droplets, so the infection risk

92

is dominated by aerosol transmission. An additional intermediate data point from the meta-analysis 2

93

was that the infection risk was about 2.6% when the distance was > 1m. The above results suggested

94

that the infection risk exponentially decreased with the increasing distance from the infected

95

individual in the room. A simple exponential regression model Risk=10-0.90×D+0.10 (D<=5 m) could be

96

utilized to roughly estimate the magnitude of infection risk for the considered scenario (Figure 1),

97

where D is the distance from the infected individual.

98
99

Larger rooms could reduce the infection risk via aerosol by enhancing the dilution of the airborne

100

virus-laden particles. The decreasing rate of the risk was correlated with the area of the rooms (L2) as

101

shown in Figure 2. The median risk decreased by about a factor of 4, from 3.7×10-5 to 1.0×10-5,

102

when the room size increased from 10 m to 20 m. The infection risk decreased slower for further

103

distance (D>5 m) than that within 5 m. The ventilation rates had moderate effects on the infection

104

risk due to the modulation of deposition. The median risk increased from 3.7×10-5 with 1 ACH to

105

7.0×10-5 with 0.1 ACH as shown in Figure 3.

The recently developed dose-response relation could be utilized to quantify the magnitude of the

108

infection risk via aerosol transmission. The uncertainties in the estimations were mainly due to the

109

dose-response relation and the viral shedding. Despite the uncertainties, the assessment could still

110

improve the understanding of the relative importance of different transmission routes. The infection

111

risk via aerosol transmission with one-hour exposure (10-6 to 10-4) was more than three orders of

112

magnitude lower than the risk caused by close contact (10-2 to 10-1).

113
114

Keeping distance is not enough to prevent or reduce the exposure to aerosol indoors. Wearing masks

115

is helpful. The infection risk via aerosol transmission could increase for prolonged exposure duration,

116

e.g. at home and office. In addition, the expected number of infected cases could be considerable if

117

there are a large amount of exposed individuals, e.g. in clubs. As a result, it is necessary to be

118

cautious for the potential aerosol transmission risk in such situations.
