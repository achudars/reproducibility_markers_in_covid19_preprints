Abstract
We introduce a simple methodology to estimate the infection fatality rate (IFR)
and from here the total number of infected with SARS-CoV-2. The virus has
shown to be highly infectious and thus we based our method under the assumption that all members of a household with at least one confirmed case of
COVID-19 should be infected, therefore we estimate the IFR using the number
of secondary fatalities in households. The simplicity of the methodology allows
for large sample sizes, since it requires minimal laboratory testing capabilities.
We applied this methodology to a database of 3,232 confirmed cases in Mexico
and arrived to an IFR estimate within the range reported in other studies.

1. Introduction
It is known that the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 may range from
fully asymptomatic to exhibit mild or even severe responses that may cause
death. Estimates of the probability of presenting a particular response are

mathematical models that may provide some projections at the population level,
specially to analyze the evolution of the immune population with the purpose
of economic recovery. These estimates are particularly important to estimate
the total number of infections by expanding the fraction of observed in some
10

category, for the instance the number of hospitalized persons or the number of
deaths.
Let p be the probability that an individual will die given that it is infected
with SARS-CoV-2, that is, p is the infection fatality rate (IFR). If p̂ is and
estimate of p then we can build an estimate of the number of infections per

15

every death as 1/p̂. If the total number of deaths M is known, one can estimate
the total number of infections with M/p̂.
There are current estimates of the probability of showing a specific reaction
to infection, for instance, being asymptomatic, presenting mild or severe symptoms [1, 2, 3, 4], but their statistical properties are unknown. A possible design

20

that would allow to estimate p is random screening for infection or antibodies,
and categorizing the response of infected or already immune individuals. Some
of these studies have been recently released for Iceland [5] and there are ongoing
studies in other countries.
Here we suggest a simple study design based on the number of deaths ob-

25

served in households with at least one confirmed case of COVID-19.

Methodology
Let’s define an effective contact or contact for short as any act between
an infectious and a susceptible individual that would result in the infection of
the susceptible [6]. Let’s suppose that have n individuals that we know had a
30

contact. Then and estimate of the IFR is p̂ = x/n where x is then number of
observed deaths among the n individuals.
From here, the importance of finding individuals that we know had a contact.
But these individuals may easy to find: several studies have suggested that
household transmission as well as familial transmission is very high [7, 8, 9, 10,

11, 12, 13] or even in offices for relative short interactions [14]. Therefore, if
we are willing to concede that all the members of a household with a diagnosed
individual had a contact with the initial infected in the household, the fraction
of deaths among the remaining members of the household is an estimate of p.
It is possible to pool data from several households to obtain a better estimate.

40

In what follows, we formalize this estimate.
Suppose that we have a confirmed case of COVID-19. This confirmed case
can lead us to household j with nj members in total. Define the individual
that led us to a household as the index case (not necessarily the first case in a
household). Assume that:

45

(i) The remaining nj − 1 members of household are infected with probability
1.
(ii) Once infected, the response to infection of each of the nj − 1 individuals are independent, that is, the number of deaths among the remaining
susceptible members in a household follows a binomial distribution with

50

parameters nj − 1 and p.
Observe that (i) implies that when two or more individuals are infected in
the household, the probability that any one of the remaining susceptible will be
infected is not increased. Also, it implies that all infected individuals are equally
infectious, regardless of their symptomatic response to infection. Observe also

55

that by excluding the index case of each household we avoid any bias.
Estimation of IFR and the total number of infections
Suppose a sample of m confirmed individuals led us to m households of
Pm
size nj , j = 1, 2, 3, . . . , m. Let n = j nj be the sum of all members in all

60

households in the sample. Let xj be the number of deaths in household j
Pm
(excluding all possible deaths of index cases) and let x = j xj . The estimate
of p, the IFR measured at the household level is xj /(nj −1). Using all households
data in the sample, the estimate of p is:

p̂ =

x
n−m

(1)

with variance p̂(1 − p̂)/(n − m).
With one further assumption, one can estimate the number of infections for
65

the total population from these same data. If we assume that the number of
COVID-19 deaths recorded includes all deaths from COVID-19, we can simply
estimate the number of infected people in the population by expanding the
fraction of infected people estimated from the sample of observed households.
This should provide a simple but statistically sound estimate of the total number

70

of infected people in the population.
The estimate of the total number of infections per death is about θ = 1/p̂.
The approximate variance of θ̂ is:

Var(θ̂) =

1 − p̂
(n − m)p̂3

Let M be the total number of deaths from COVID-19 in the population, the
estimate of the total number of infected individuals in the population, N is:

N̂ = M
75

(1 − p̂)
+ M = M/p̂
p̂

(2)

with approximate variance:

2
σ̂N
=

M 2 1 − p̂
n − m p̂3

(3)

It is important to stress that our model does not assume that all infections
among the remaining nj − 1 members of the household were caused by the
same individual. In fact, our approach only requires that the remaining nj − 1
individuals in the household have had enough infectious pressure to guarantee
80

they are infected. Thus, it works even if one or more infections among the
members in a household were caused outside the household.

Example
In this example we build an approximation to (1) using a database from
Mexico’s IMSS (Instituto Mexicano de Seguro Social), the Mexican Institute
85

for Social Insurance.
The database has 9939 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases from March 2 to May
4, 2020. In an attempt to consider only households with final outcomes we
excluded cases with symptoms onset in the last 21 days, that is, we considered
only cases from March 2 to April 19, 2020. The final dataset has 3232 cases.

90

We grouped the cases in households. If there were more than one case in a
household, we only considered the household if all cases were already solved as
deaths or recoveries. In every household with more than one case we consider
the index case as the individual with the earliest symptom onset and counted the
number of deaths among the remaining members of the house. From the final

95

set of 3193 households, there were 3185 with no deaths among the remaining
members of the household and 8 houses with one additional death. The mean
age of this final set was 46.0 years with a standard deviation of 14.79 years with
median 45 years. From these, there were 57.4 % males and 42.6 % females. In
this set, 37 % were at least 50 years old.

100

The total number of households was m = 3193 and there were a total of
x = 8 deaths. Since the total number of individuals in all households in the
sample (n) i s not known, we vary the average household size in the sample (µ)
to calculate n = mµ and estimate p̂ using (1). The results are summarized in
Figure 1.

105

Discussion
First we must mention that our goal here is not to provide precise estimates
of p for Mexico since the total number of individuals in all households is not
known and we used an approximation according the average household size.
Our goal is to illustrate a simple methodology to estimate the true number of

110

infections in a population using available information on confirmed individuals.

the total infected to deaths. The point marks the IFR at the average family size for Mexico,
3.7 At this average, IFR= 0.00092 and K = 1077.

Our estimate from the IMSS data at the average household size µ = 3.7 is
p = 0.00092, which is in the range 0.001 − 0.003 reported in [15] and [16].
Our method is simple enough to be applied in countries with relatively few
tracking capabilities. All it is needed is a list of households with at least one
115

confirmed case of COVID-19 (a sample may suffice) with the total number of
members in the household and the number of deaths for COVID-19 in each
household. The precision of estimate (1) depends on the sample size m, and
the precision of estimate (2) depends in addition on how good is our estimate
of the actual number of deaths from COVID-19 to date. Overall, the precision

120

will depend on our ability to diagnose COVID-19 related deaths.
Assumption (i) is central for this proposal, but there is a way to avoid
it although clearly at a larger economic cost: this consists in testing all the
members of the household of a confirmed case. The estimate (1) can still be
applied using only data of confirmed cases, but now x is the number of deaths

125

among all confirmed cases in all households (excluding the infected zero) and

n the total number of confirmed cases in all households (including the infected
zero).
In a following step, we can obtain the same probabilities for the whole population of positive cases by matching the household sample of tested households
130

with households in the census. In other words, we only need to make sure
that the sample of households retained from the interviews is representative of
the national sample of households. This can be done, ex-ante with a sample
of available infected households or, if this information is not available, ex-post
by matching the interviewed sample of households with the national census of

135

households. Something that can be done with matching or machine learning
methods. This provides the distribution of cases between any categorization
of symptoms for the population of infected people in a population. A direct
approach from stratified sampling may use some demographic knowledge of the
population which would allow us to weight for differential response to the in-

140

fection. Suppose that we classify a population in K categories (e.g., age) at
relative frequencies fi . Let x(i) and n(i) be respectively the total number of
deaths and total number of individuals in category i in all households in the
sample of size m, then a better estimate of p would be:

p̂ =

n(i) − m

with variance

p̂ =

(5)

This p̂ must be plugged in (2), with variance (3). We can divide then population
in Mexico in two categories: age ≤ 50 years and age > 50 years, at respective
proportions f1 = 0.9 and f2 = 0.1 [17]. The IFR in the first category was 0.002
and in the second 0.0052. From (4) we have p̂ = 0.0023 for the whole population,
the weighted estimate suggests the number of total infected is about 400 times

150

larger than the number of deaths.

One of the most important sources of bias in this method, is that some
observations may be censored. Perhaps death has not occurred yet in a given
household and thus the probability of death is underestimated. In our analysis
of IMSS data, we tried to control this by using only data where the onset of
155

symptoms was at least 21 days old so that the outcome is very likely observed,
but in principle, we should use households were there is enough evidence to
believe that we can observe final outcomes.
