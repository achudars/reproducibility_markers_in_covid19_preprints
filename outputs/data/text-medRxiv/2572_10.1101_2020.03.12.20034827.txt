Abstract

1

2

Background:

The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome

3

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread to nearly every country in the world since it first emerged in China in

4

December 2019. Many countries have implemented social distancing as a measure to ‘flatten the curve’ of the

5

ongoing epidemics. Evaluation of the impact of government-imposed social distancing and of other measures to

6

control further spread of COVID-19 is urgent, especially because of the large societal and economic impact of

7

the former. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of self-imposed prevention measures and of

8

short-term government-imposed social distancing in mitigating, delaying, or preventing a COVID-19 epidemic.

9

Methods and Findings: We developed a deterministic compartmental transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 in

10

a population stratified by disease status (susceptible, exposed, infectious with mild or severe disease, diagnosed

11

and recovered) and disease awareness status (aware and unaware) due to the spread of COVID-19. Self-imposed

12

measures were assumed to be taken by disease-aware individuals and included handwashing, mask-wearing, and

13

social distancing. Government-imposed social distancing reduced the contact rate of individuals irrespective of

14

their disease or awareness status. The model was parameterized using current best estimates of key epidemiolog-

15

ical parameters from COVID-19 clinical studies. The model outcomes included the peak number of diagnoses,

16

attack rate, and time until the peak number of diagnoses. For fast awareness spread in the population, self-

17

imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses.

18

A large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread,

19

self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of

20

the peak. Early implementation of short-term government-imposed social distancing can only delay the peak

21

(by at most 7 months for a 3-month intervention). The delay can be even longer and the height of the peak

22

can be additionally reduced if this intervention is combined with self-imposed measures that are continued after

23

government-imposed social distancing has been lifted. Our analyses do not account for stochasticity, demograph-

24

ics, heterogeneities in contact patterns or mixing, spatial effects, imperfect isolation of individuals with severe

25

disease, and reinfection with COVID-19.

26

Conclusions: Our results suggest that information dissemination about COVID-19, which causes individual

27

adaption of handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing can be an effective strategy to mitigate and delay

28

the epidemic. Early-initiated short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare

29

systems to prepare for an increasing COVID-19 burden. We stress the importance of disease awareness in

30

controlling the ongoing epidemic and recommend that, in addition to policies on social distancing, governments

31

and public health institutions mobilize people to adopt self-imposed measures with proven efficacy in order to

32

successfully tackle COVID-19.

Author summary

34

Why was this study done?

35

• As of May 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has
spread to nearly every country in the world since it first emerged in China in December 2019.
• Confronted with a COVID-19 epidemic, public health policymakers in different countries are seeking recommendations on how to delay and/or flatten its peak.

37

38

39

• Evaluation of the impact of social distancing mandated by the governments in many countries and of other

40

prevention measures to control further spread of COVID-19 is urgent, especially because of the large societal

41

and economic impact of the former.

42

What did the researchers do and find?

43

• We developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed measures (handwashing, mask-

44

wearing, and social distancing) due to awareness of COVID-19 and of short-term government-imposed social

45

distancing on the epidemic dynamics.

46

• We showed that self-imposed measures can prevent a large epidemic if their efficacy exceeds 50%.

47

• Short-term government-imposed social distancing that is initiated early into the epidemic can buy time (at

48

most 7 months for a 3-month intervention) for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing COVID-19

49

burden.

50

• The delay to the peak number of diagnoses can be even longer and the height of the peak can be additionally

51

reduced if the same intervention is combined with self-imposed measures that are continued after lifting

52

government-imposed social distancing.

53

What do these findings mean?

54

• Raising awareness of self-imposed measures such as handwashing and mask-wearing is crucial in controlling
the ongoing epidemic.

60

36

55

56

• Short-term early-initiated government-imposed social distancing combined with self-imposed measures pro-

57

58

• In addition to policies on social distancing, governments and public health institutions should continuously

59

mobilize people to adopt self-imposed measures with proven efficacy in order to successfully tackle COVID-19.

Introduction

62

As of May 5, 2020, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide and only 13 countries have not

63

reported any cases. It has caused over 3,640,835 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and nearly 255,100 deaths since the

64

detection of its outbreak in China on December 31, 2019 [1]. On March 11, the World Health Organization officially

65

declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic [1]. Several approaches aimed at the containment of SARS-CoV-2

66

in China were unsuccessful. Airport screening of travelers was hampered by a potentially large number of asymp-

67

tomatic cases and the possibility of pre-symptomatic transmission [2–4]. Quarantine of fourteen days combined

68

with fever surveillance was insufficient in containing the virus due to the high variability of the incubation period [5].

69

70

Now that SARS-CoV-2 has extended its range of transmission in all parts of the world, it is evident that many

71

countries face a large COVID-19 epidemic [6]. Initial policies regarding COVID-19 prevention were mainly limited

72

to reporting cases, strict isolation of severe symptomatic cases, home isolation of mild cases, and contact tracing [7].

73

However, due to the potentially high contribution of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic spread [8], these case-

74

based interventions are likely insufficient in containing a COVID-19 epidemic unless they are highly effective [8–11].

75

Given the rapid rise in cases and the risk of exceeding critical care bed capacities, many countries have implemented

76

social distancing as a short-term measure aiming at reducing the contact rate in the population and, subsequently,

77

transmission [6, 12].

78

schools, public places and non-essential businesses, canceling mass events, and issuing stay-at-home orders [6].

79

Previous studies on the 1918 influenza pandemic showed that such mandated interventions were effective in reducing

80

transmission but their timing and magnitude had a profound influence on the course of the epidemic [13–18]. These

81

short-term interventions were associated with a high risk of epidemic resurgence and their impact was limited if

82

introduced too late or lifted too early [13–16].

Several governments have imposed nationwide partial or complete lockdowns by closing

83

84

Self-imposed prevention measures such as handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing could also contribute

85

to slowing down the epidemic [19, 20]. Alcohol-based sanitizers are effective in removing the SARS coronavirus

86

from hands [21] and handwashing with soap may have a positive effect on reducing the transmission of respiratory

87

infections [22]. Surgical masks, often worn for their perceived protection, are not designed nor certified to protect

88

against respiratory hazards, but they can stop droplets being spread from infectious individuals [23–25]. Informa-

89

tion dissemination and official recommendations about COVID-19 can create awareness and motivate individuals

90

to adopt such measures. Previous studies emphasized the importance of disease awareness for changing the course

91

of an epidemic [26–28]. Depending on the rate and mechanism of awareness spread, the awareness process can

92

reduce the attack rate of an epidemic or prevent it completely [26], but it can also lead to undesirable outcomes

93

such as the appearance of multiple epidemic peaks [27,28]. The secondary epidemic waves may appear as the result
of individuals relaxing adherence to self-imposed measures prematurely in a population where the susceptible pool

following the first wave is still significantly large and disease has not been completely eliminated. It is essential to

95

assess under which conditions, spread of disease awareness that instigates self-imposed measures can be a viable

96

strategy for COVID-19 control.

97

98

The comparison of the effectiveness of early implemented short-term government-imposed social distancing and

99

self-imposed prevention measures on reducing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are currently missing but are of

100

crucial importance in the attempt to stop its spread. If a COVID-19 epidemic cannot be prevented, it is important

101

to know how to effectively diminish and postpone the epidemic peak to give healthcare professionals more time to

102

prepare and react effectively to an increasing health care burden. Moreover, given that several countries have peaked

103

in cases, the importance of evaluating the effect of self-imposed measures after lifting lockdown measures is profound.

104

105

126

Using a transmission model we evaluated the impact of self-imposed measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and

106

social distancing) due to awareness of COVID-19 and of a short-term government-imposed social distancing inter-

107

vention on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate, and time until the peak number of diagnoses since the first

108

case. We provide a comparative analysis of these interventions as well as of their combinations and assess the range

109

of intervention efficacies for which a COVID-19 epidemic can be mitigated, delayed or even prevented completely.

110

Qualitatively, these results will aid public health professionals to compare and select a combination of interventions

111

for designing effective outbreak control policies.

112

Methods

113

Baseline transmission model

114

We developed a deterministic compartmental model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a population stratified

115

by disease status (Figure 1). In this baseline model, individuals are classified as susceptible (S), latently infected

116

(E), infectious with mild disease (IM ), infectious with severe disease (IS ), diagnosed and isolated (ID ), and recovered

117

after mild or severe disease (RM and RS , respectively). Susceptible individuals (S) can become latently infected

118

(E) through contact with infectious individuals (IM and IS ) with the force of infection dependent on the fractions

119

of the population in IM and IS compartments. A proportion of the latently infected individuals (E) will go to

120

the IM compartment, and the remaining E individuals will go to the IS compartment. We assume that infectious

121

individuals with mild disease (IM ) do not require medical attention and recover (RM ) without being conscious of

122

having contracted COVID-19. Infectious individuals with severe disease (IS ) are unable to recover without medical

123

help, and subsequently get diagnosed and isolated (ID ) (in e.g. hospitals, long-term care facilities, nursing homes)

124

and know or suspect they have COVID-19 when they are detected. Therefore, the diagnosed compartment ID

125

contains infectious individuals with severe disease who are both officially diagnosed and get treatment in healthcare

127

institutions and those who are not officially diagnosed but have disease severe enough to suspect they have COVID-19

128

and require isolation. For simplicity, isolation of these individuals is assumed to be perfect until recovery (RS ), and,

129

hence, they neither contribute to transmission nor to the contact process. Given the timescale of the epidemic and

130

the lack of reliable reports on reinfections, we assume that recovered individuals (RM and RS ) cannot be reinfected.

131

The infectivity of infectious individuals with mild disease is lower than the infectivity of infectious individuals with

132

severe disease [29]. Natural birth and death processes are neglected as the time scale of the epidemic is short

133

compared to the mean life span of individuals. However, isolated infectious individuals with severe disease (ID )

134

may be removed from the population due to disease-associated mortality.

Red dashed arrows indicate the compartments contributing to the force of infection. Susceptible persons (S)
become latently infected (E) with the force of infection λinf via contact with infectious individuals in two
infectious classes (IM and IS ). Individuals leave the E compartment at rate α. A proportion p of the latently
infected individuals (E) will go to the IM compartment, and the proportion (1 − p) of E individuals will go to the
IS compartment. Infectious individuals with mild disease (IM ) recover without being conscious of having
contracted COVID-19 (RM ) at rate γM . Infectious individuals with severe disease
(IS ) are diagnosed and kept in isolation (ID ) at rate ν until they recover (RS ) at rate γS or die at rate η. Table 1

Transmission model with disease awareness

136

In the extended model with disease awareness, the population is stratified not only by the disease status but also by

137

a
a
a
the awareness status into disease-aware (S a , E a , IM
, ISa , ID
, and RM
) and disease-unaware (S, E, IM , IS , ID , and

138

RM ) (Figure 2 A). Disease awareness is a state that can be acquired as well as lost. Disease-aware individuals are

139

distinguished from unaware individuals in two essential ways. First, infectious individuals with severe disease who

140

a
are disease-aware (ISa ) get diagnosed and isolated faster (ID
), stay in isolation for a shorter period of time and have

141

lower disease-associated mortality than the same category of unaware individuals. The assumption we make here

142

is that disease-aware individuals (ISa ) recognize they may have COVID-19 on average faster than disease-unaware

143

a
individuals (IS ) and get medical help earlier which leads to a better prognosis of ID
individuals as compared to

ID individuals. Second, disease-aware individuals are assumed to use self-imposed measures such as handwashing,

mask-wearing and self-imposed social distancing that can lower their susceptibility, infectivity and/or contact rate.

145

a
Individuals who know or suspect their disease status (ID , ID
and RS ) do not adapt any such measures since

146

they assume that they cannot contract the disease again. Hence, they are excluded from the awareness transition

147

process and their behaviour in the contact process is identical to disease-unaware individuals.

148

149

Similarly to Perra et al [27], disease-unaware individuals acquire disease awareness at a rate proportional to the rate

150

a
of awareness spread and to the current number of diagnosed individuals (ID and ID
) in the population (Figure 2 B).

151

We assume that awareness fades and individuals return to the unaware state at a constant rate. The latter means

152

that they no longer use self-imposed measures. For simplicity, we assume that awareness acquisition and fading

153

154

rates are the same for individuals of type S, E, IM , and RM . However, the rate of awareness acquisition is faster

155

and the fading rate is slower for infectious individuals with severe disease (IS ) than for the remaining disease-aware

156

population.

Prevention measures

158

We considered short-term government intervention aimed at fostering social distancing in the population and a

159

suite of measures that may be self-imposed by disease-aware individuals, i.e., mask-wearing, handwashing, and

160

self-imposed social distancing.

161

162

Mask-wearing

163

Mask-wearing, while often adapted as a protective measure, may be ineffective in reducing the individual’s suscep-

164

tibility because laypersons, i.e., not medical professionals, are unfamiliar with correct procedures for its use (e.g.

165

often engage in face-touching and mask adjustment) [36]. However, mask-wearing reduces infectious output [25]

166

a
and, therefore, we assume that this measure lowers only the infectivity of disease-aware infectious individuals (IM

167

and ISa ) with an efficacy ranging from 0% (zero efficacy) to 100% (full efficacy).

168

Handwashing

169

Since infectious individuals may transmit the virus to others without direct physical contact, we assume that handwashing only reduces one’s susceptibility. The efficacy of handwashing is described by the reduction in susceptibility

170

(i.e., probability of transmission per single contact) of susceptible disease-aware individuals (S a ) which ranges from

202

0% (zero efficacy) to 100% (full efficacy). Since transmission can possibly occur through routes other than physical

172

contact, hand washing may not provide 100% protection to those who practice it.

173

Self-imposed social distancing

174

Disease-aware individuals, who consider themselves susceptible, may also practice social distancing, i.e., maintaining

175

distance to others and avoiding congregate settings. As a consequence, this measure leads to a change in mixing

176

patterns in the population. The efficacy of social distancing of disease-aware individuals is described by the reduction

177

in their contact rate which is varied from 0% (no social distancing or zero efficacy) to 100% (complete self-isolation

178

or full efficacy). Since contacts might not be eliminated entirely (e.g. household contacts remain), realistic values

179

of the efficacy of self-imposed social distancing can be close to but may never reach 100%.

180

Short-term government-imposed social distancing

181

Governments may decide to promote social distancing policies through interventions such as school and workplace

182

closures or by issuing stay-at-home orders and bans on large gatherings. These lockdown policies will cause a

183

community-wide contact rate reduction, regardless of the awareness status. Here, we assume that the government-

184

imposed social distancing is initiated if the number of diagnosed individuals exceeds a certain threshold (10–1000

185

persons) and terminates after a fixed period of time (1–3 months). As such, the intervention is implemented

186

early into the epidemic. Government-imposed social distancing may be partial or complete depending on its

187

efficacy, i.e., the reduction of the average contact rate in the population which ranges from 0% (no distancing)

188

to 100% (complete lockdown). Since during a lockdown, some contacts in the population cannot be eliminated

189

(e.g. household contacts), realistic values of the efficacy of government-imposed social distancing can be close to

190

but never reach 100%. For example, a 73% reduction in the average daily number of contacts was observed during

191

the lockdown in the UK [37] but the reduction could be different in countries with more or less stringent lockdown.

192

Model output

193

The model outputs are the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate (a proportion of the population that recovered

194

or died after severe infection), the time to the peak number of diagnoses since the first case, and the probability

195

of infection during the course of an epidemic (see Appendix for a more detailed description of the latter). We

196

compared the impact of different prevention measures and their combinations on these outputs by varying the

197

reduction in infectivity of disease-aware infectious individuals (mask-wearing), the reduction in susceptibility of

198

disease-aware susceptible individuals (handwashing), the reduction in contact rate of disease-aware individuals

199

only (self-imposed social distancing) and of all individuals (government-imposed social distancing). We refer to

200

these quantities as the efficacy of a prevention measure and vary it from 0% (zero efficacy) to 100% (full efficacy)

201

(Table 1). The main analyses were performed for two values of the rate of awareness spread that corresponded

203

to scenarios of slow and fast spread of awareness in the population (Table 1). For these scenarios, the propor-

204

tion of the aware population at the peak of the epidemic was 40% and 90%, respectively. In the main analyses,

205

government-imposed social distancing was initiated when 10 individuals got diagnosed and was lifted after 3 months.

206

207

Estimates of epidemiological parameters were obtained from the most recent literature (Table 1). We used contact

208

rates for the Netherlands, but the model is appropriate for other Western countries with similar contact patterns.

209

A detailed mathematical description of the model can be found in the Appendix. The model was implemented

210

in Mathematica 10.0.2.0. The code reproducing the results of this study is available at https://github.com/

211

lynxgav/COVID19-mitigation.

212

Sensitivity analyses

213

To allow for the uncertainty in the parameters of the baseline transmission model, we conducted sensitivity analyses

214

with respect to the proportion of infectious individuals with mild disease, the relative infectivity of infectious

215

individuals with mild disease, the recovery period of infectious individuals with mild disease, the delay from onset

216

of infectiousness to diagnosis for infectious individuals with severe disease, and the basic reproduction number

217

(Appendix). We also conducted sensitivity analyses for the model with disease awareness with respect to changes

218

in the delay from the onset of infectiousness to diagnosis and isolation for disease-aware individuals, the rate of

219

awareness spread, the relative susceptibility to awareness, and the duration of awareness (Appendix). Parameter

220

ranges used in these sensitivity analyses are specified in Table 1.

221

In addition, we present results for the impact on the model outcomes of all combinations of self-imposed prevention

222

measures as their efficacy was varied from 0% to 100% and of the government-imposed social distancing with efficacy

223

ranging from 0% to 100%, different thresholds for initiating the intervention (1 to 1000 diagnoses), and different

224

durations of the intervention (3, 8 and 13 months) (see Appendix for details).

225

Results

226

Our analyses show that disease awareness spread has a significant effect on the model predictions. We first considered

227

the epidemic dynamics in a disease-aware population where handwashing is promoted, as an example of self-imposed

228

measures (Figure 3). Then, we performed a systematic comparison of the impact of different prevention measures

229

on the model output for slow (Figure 4) and fast (Figure 5) rate of awareness spread.

230

Epidemic dynamics

231

All self-imposed measures and government-imposed social distancing have an effect on the COVID-19 epidemic

232

dynamics. The qualitative and quantitative impact, however, depends strongly on the prevention measure and

233

the rate of awareness spread. The baseline model predicts 46 diagnoses per 1000 individuals at the peak of the

234

epidemic, an attack rate of about 16% and the time to the peak of about 5.2 months (red line, Figure 3 A and B).

235

In the absence of prevention measures, a fast spread of disease awareness reduces the peak number of diagnoses

236

by 20% but has only a minor effect on the attack rate and peak timing (orange line, Figure 3 A and B). This is

237

expected, as disease-aware individuals with severe disease seek medical care sooner and therefore get diagnosed

238

faster causing fewer new infections as compared to the baseline model. Awareness dynamics coupled with the use

239

of self-imposed prevention measures has an even larger impact on the epidemic. The blue line in Figure 3 A shows

240

the epidemic curve for the scenario when disease-aware individuals use handwashing as self-imposed prevention

241

measure. Even if the efficacy of handwashing is modest (i.e., 30% as in Figure 3 A) the impact on the epidemic

242

can be significant, namely we predicted a 65% reduction in the peak number of diagnoses, a 29% decrease in the

243

attack rate, and a delay in peak timing of 2.7 months (Figure 3 A and B).

244

245

The effect of awareness on the disease dynamics can also be observed in the probability of infection during the

246

course of the epidemic. In the model with awareness and no measures, the probability of infection is reduced by

247

4% for all individuals. Handwashing with an efficacy of 30% reduces the respective probability by 14% for unaware

248

individuals and by 29% for aware individuals. Note that the probability of infection is highly dependent on the

249

type of prevention measure. The detailed analysis is given in the Appendix.

250

A comparison of prevention measures

251

Slow spread of awareness

252

Figure 4 shows the impact of all considered self-imposed measures as well as of the government-imposed social

253

distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate, and the time to the peak for a slow rate of awareness

254

spread. In this scenario, the model predicts progressively larger reductions in the peak number of diagnoses and in

255

the attack rate as the efficacy of the self-imposed measures increases. In the limit of 100% efficacy, the reduction

256

in the peak number of diagnoses is 23% to 30% (Figure 4 A) and the attack rate decreases from 16% to 12-13%

257

(Figure 4 B). The efficacy of the self-imposed measures has very little impact on the peak timing when compared

258

to the baseline, i.e., no awareness in the population (Figure 4 C). Since the proportion of aware individuals who

259

change their behavior is too small to make a significant impact on transmission, self-imposed measures can only

260

mitigate but not prevent an epidemic.

261

262

When awareness spreads at a slow rate, a 3-month government intervention has a contrasting impact to the

263

self-imposed measure scenario. The time to the peak number of diagnoses is longer for more stringent contact

264

rate reductions. For example, a complete lockdown (government-imposed social distancing with 100% efficacy)

265

can postpone the peak by almost 7 months but its magnitude and attack rate are unaffected (with respect to

267

imposed social distancing starts early (e.g, after tens to hundreds of cases) and is lifted a few weeks to few

268

months later. This type of intervention halts the epidemic for the duration of intervention, but, because of a

Fast spread of awareness

271

Since the government intervention reduces the contact rate of all individuals irrespective of their awareness status,

272

it has a comparable impact on transmission for scenarios with fast and slow rate of awareness spread (compare

273

Figure 4 and Figure 5). However, the impact of self-imposed measures is drastically different when awareness

274

275

spreads fast. All self-imposed measures are more effective than the short-term government intervention. These

276

measures not only reduce the attack rate (Figure 5 B), diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses

277

(Figure 5 A and C), but they can also prevent a large epidemic altogether when their efficacy is sufficiently high

278

(about 50%). Note that when the rate of awareness is fast, as the number of diagnoses grows, the population

279

becomes almost homogeneous, with most individuals being disease-aware. It can be shown that in such populations

280

prevention measures yield comparable results if they have the same efficacy.

281

282

Combinations of prevention measures

283

If government-imposed social distancing is combined with a self-imposed prevention measure, the model predicts

284

that the relative reduction in the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate are determined by the efficacy of the

285

self-imposed measure, while the timing of the peak is determined by the efficacies of both the self-imposed measure

286

and the government intervention. This is demonstrated in Figure 6, where we used a combination of handwashing

287

with efficacies of 30%, 45% and 60% and government-imposed social distancing with efficacy ranging from 0% to

288

100% for slow and fast spread of awareness. Our results show that the effect of the combined intervention highly

289

depends on the rate of awareness spread. Fast awareness spread is crucial for a large reduction in the peak number

290

of diagnoses (Figure 6 A) and in the attack rate (Figure 6 B). Note, that for fast spread of awareness, a combination

291

of a complete lockdown and handwashing with an efficacy of 30% could postpone the time to the peak number

292

of diagnoses by nearly 10 months (Figure 6 C). Thus, when combined with short-term government-imposed social

293

distancing, handwashing can contribute to mitigating and delaying the epidemic in particular after the lockdown

294

is relaxed. The second wave of the epidemic could be prevented completely if the efficacy of handwashing exceeds

295

50% (Figure 6 A). The results for the combination of mask-wearing and government-imposed social distancing are

296

similar, and are therefore not shown.

297

298

The effect of combinations of self-imposed measures (e.g. handwashing and mask-wearing) is additive (see Ap-

299

pendix). This means that, for fast spread of awareness, a large outbreak can be prevented by, for example, a

300

combination of handwashing and self-imposed social distancing each with an efficacy of around 25% (or other

301

efficacies adding up to 50%).

Discussion

304

For many countries around the world, the focus of public health officers in the context of COVID-19 epidemic has

305

shifted from containment to mitigation and delay. Our study provides new insights for designing effective outbreak

306

control strategies. Based on our results, we conclude that handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing
adopted by disease-aware individuals can delay the epidemic peak, flatten the epidemic curve and reduce the attack

307

rate. We show that the rate at which disease awareness spreads has a strong impact on how self-imposed measures

affect the epidemic. For a slow rate of awareness spread, self-imposed measures have less impact on transmission, as

309

not many individuals adopt them. However, for a fast rate of awareness spread, their impact on the magnitude and

310

timing of the peak increases with increasing efficacy of the respective measure. For all measures, a large epidemic

311

can be prevented when the efficacy exceeds 50%. Moreover, the effect of combinations of self-imposed measures is

312

additive. In practical terms, it means that SARS-CoV-2 will not cause a large outbreak in a country where 90%

313

of the population adopt handwashing and social distancing that are 25% efficacious (i.e., reduce susceptibility and

314

contact rate by 25%, respectively).

315

316

Although our analyses indicate that the effects of self-imposed measures on mitigating and delaying the epidemic

317

for the same efficacies are similar (see Figure 4 and Figure 5), not all explored efficacy values may be achieved

318

for each measure. Wong et al [22] and Cowling et al [24] performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the

319

effect of handwashing and face masks on the risk of influenza virus infections in the community. While the authors

320

highlight the potential importance of both hand hygiene and face masks, only modest effects could be ascertained

321

with a pooled risk ratio of 0.73 (95% CI: [0.6, 0.89]) for a combination of these two measures. However, the authors

322

also highlight the small number of randomized-controlled trials and the heterogeneity of the studies as notable

323

limitations which may have led to these results. Given the high uncertainty around the efficacies of hand hygiene

324

and mask-wearing on their own, the promotion of a combination of these measures might become preferable to

325

recommending handwashing or mask-only measures. For self-imposed social distancing, contacts might not be

326

eliminated entirely (e.g. household contacts remain) and therefore realistic values of the efficacy of self-imposed

327

social distancing can be close to but may never reach 100%. Thus, for a fair comparison between measures, realistic

328

efficacy values of a specific measure should be taken into consideration.

329

330

We contrasted self-imposed measures stimulated by disease awareness with mandated social distancing.

Our

331

analyses show that short-term government-imposed social distancing that is implemented early into the epidemic,

332

can delay the epidemic peak but does not affect its magnitude nor the attack rate. For example, a complete

333

lockdown of 3 months imposing a community-wide contact rate reduction that starts after tens to thousands

334

diagnoses in the country can postpone the peak by about 7 months. Such an intervention is highly desirable, when

335

a vaccine is being developed or when healthcare systems require more time to treat cases or increase capacity. If

336

this intervention is implemented in a population which exercises a self-imposed measure that is continued being

337

practiced even after the lockdown is over, then the delay can be even longer (e.g. up to 10 months for handwashing

338

with 30% efficacy). In the context of countries that implemented social distancing as a measure to ‘flatten the

339

curve’ of the ongoing epidemics, peaked in cases and now are now planning or have already started gradual lifting

340

341

of social distancing, it means that governments and public health institutions should intensify the promotion of

342

self-imposed measures to diminish and postpone the peak of the potential second epidemic wave. The potential

343

second wave could be prevented altogether if the coverage of a self-imposed measure in the population and its

344

efficacy are sufficiently high (e.g. 90% and 50%, respectively). Our sensitivity analyses showed that lower or

345

higher efficacies can be required to prevent a large epidemic for countries with smaller or larger basic reproduction

346

numbers (Appendix).

347

348

Since for many countries the COVID-19 epidemic is still in its early stages, government-imposed social distancing

349

was modeled as a short-term intervention initiated when the number of diagnosed individuals was relatively low.

350

Our sensitivity analyses showed that government interventions introduced later into the epidemic (at 100—1000

351

diagnoses) and imposed for a longer period of time (3—13 months) not only delay the peak of the epidemic but also

352

reduce it for intermediate efficacy values (see Appendix). Previous studies suggested that the timing of mandated

353

social distancing is crucial for its viability in controlling a large disease outbreak [13, 14, 16, 38]. As discussed by

354

Hollingsworth et al [16] and Anderson et al [20], a late introduction of such interventions may have a significant

355

impact on the epidemic peak and attack rate. However, the authors also showed that the optimal strategy is

356

highly dependent on the desired outcome. A detailed analysis of government intervention with different timings

357

and durations that also takes into account the economic and societal consequences, and the cost of SARS-CoV-2

358

transmission is a subject for future work.

359

360

To our knowledge, our study is the first to provide comparative analysis of a suite of self-imposed measures,

361

government-imposed social distancing and their combinations as strategies for mitigating and delaying a COVID-19

362

epidemic. Several studies (e.g. [39–42]) looked at the effect of different forms of social distancing but they did

363

not include self-imposed measures such as handwashing and mask-wearing. Some of these studies concluded

364

that one-time social-distancing interventions will be insufficient to maintain COVID-19 prevalence within the

365

critical care capacity [40, 42]. In our analyses, we explored the full efficacy range for all self-imposed prevention

366

measures and different durations and thresholds for initiation of government intervention. Our results allow to draw

367

conclusions on which combination of prevention measures can be most effective in diminishing and postponing the

368

epidemic peak when realistic values for the measure’s efficacy are taken into account. We showed that spreading

369

disease awareness such that highly efficacious preventive measures are quickly adopted by individuals can be crucial

370

in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and preventing a large epidemics of COVID-19.

371

372

Our model has several limitations. It does not account for stochasticity, demographics, heterogeneities in contact

373

patterns, spatial effects, inhomogeneous mixing, imperfect isolation of individuals with severe disease, and reinfec-

374

tion with COVID-19. Our conclusions can, therefore, be drawn on a qualitative level. Detailed models will have to
be developed to design and tailor effective strategies in particular settings. The impact of the duration of immunity

375

has been explored by Kissler et al [43]. The effect of non-permanent immunity on the results of our model would

be an interesting subject for future work. To take into account the uncertainty in SARS-CoV-19 epidemiological

377

parameters, we performed sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the model predictions. As more data

378

become available, our model can be easily updated. In addition, our study assumes that individuals become

379

disease-aware with a rate of awareness acquisition proportional to the number of currently diagnosed individuals.

380

Other forms for the awareness acquisition rate that incorporate, e.g., the saturation of awareness, may be more

381

realistic and would be interesting to explore in future studies. Furthermore, we assume that handwashing may

382

reduce the susceptibility of an individual down to 0% and therefore neglect aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

383

Thus, the impact of handwashing on the epidemic may be an overestimation. However, while there is preliminary

384

evidence on SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in aerosols [44], there is still uncertainty about the level of infectiousness

385

of the detected aerosols and the significance of potential airborne transmission. Current recommendations by the

386

WHO are still focused on droplet and contact precautions [45]. Our model may be adapted as more information

387

on the relative contribution of the transmission routes of COVID-19 emerges.

388

389

In conclusion, we provide the first empirical basis of how stimulating the uptake of effective prevention measures,

390

such as handwashing or mask-wearing, combined with government-imposed social distancing intervention, can be

391

pivotal to achieve control over a COVID-19 epidemic. While information on the rising number of COVID-19

392

diagnoses reported by the media may fuel anxiety in the population, wide and intensive promotion of self-imposed

393

measures with proven efficacy by governments or public health institutions may be a key ingredient to tackle

394

COVID-19.
