ABSTRACT
An unprecedented outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the form of peculiar pneumonia has spread globally since its first case in Wuhan province, China,
in December 2019. Soon after, the infected cases and mortality increased rapidly.
The future of the pandemic’s progress was uncertain, and thus, predicting it became
crucial for public health researchers. These future predictions help the effective allocation of health care resources, stockpiling, and help in strategic planning for clinicians, government authorities, and public health policymakers after understanding
the extent of the effect. The main objective of this paper is to develop a hybrid
forecasting model that can generate real-time out-of-sample forecasts of COVID19 outbreaks for five profoundly affected countries, namely the USA, Brazil, India,
UK, and Canada. A novel hybrid approach based on the Theta method and Autoregressive neural network (ARNN) model, named Theta-ARNN (TARNN) model, is
developed. Daily new cases of COVID-19 are nonlinear, non-stationary, and volatile;
thus a single specific model cannot be ideal for future prediction of the pandemic.
However, the newly introduced hybrid forecasting model with an acceptable prediction error rate can help healthcare and government for effective planning and
resource allocation. The proposed method outperforms traditional univariate and
hybrid forecasting models for the test data sets on an average.

1. Introduction
In December 2019, clusters of pneumonia cases caused by the novel severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) were identified at Wuhan, Hubei
province in China [19,22,54]. Soon after the emergence of the novel beta coronavirus,

World Health Organization (WHO) characterized this contagious disease as a
pandemic in March 2020 due to its rapid spread within and outside the highly mobile
population of China which got further aggravated by the densely populated location
of the sea-food market and time of Chinese new year [47]. It resulted in an exponential
increase in the incidence rate (IR) and case-fatality rate (CFR) [37]. As of March 16,
2021, a total of 120,512,041 confirmed global cases and 2,665,742 deaths have been
reported worldwide [3].

Researchers have faced significant challenges to forecast real-time COVID-19 cases
with traditional mathematical, statistical, and machine learning-based forecasting
tools [9,14,29,31,40,56,60]. Studies in March 2020 with simple and efficient forecasting
methods such as exponential smoothing model predicted cases ten days ahead, with
large confidence intervals, that despite the positive bias, had reasonable forecast error
[43]. Previously used linear and exponential model forecasts for better preparation
regarding hospital beds, ICU admission estimation, resource allocation, emergency
funding, and proposing strong containment measures were conducted [17] that
projected ICU admissions in Italy for March 20, 2020. ICU admission and mechanical
ventilation for critically ill patients reached their peak shattering the health system of
Lombardy, Italy, by end of March 2020 [18]. Health-care workers had to go through the
immense mental stress left with a formidable choice of prioritizing young and healthy
adults over the elderly for allocation of life support, especially unwanted ignoring of
those who are extremely unlikely to survive [13,48]. Real estimates of mortality with
14-day delay demonstrated underestimating the COVID-19 outbreak and indicated
a grave future with a global CFR of 5.7% [2]. Some of the countries are eventually
in a second wave with cases rising in India, and the UK. The uncertain future has
several unanswered questions on the daily trajectory of the pandemic, infection rate,
and number of deaths. Thus, real-time forecasting with time series models could
respond to these debatable quires to reach a statistically validated conjecture in
this current health crisis. Some of the impacting leading-edge research concerning
real-time projections of COVID-19 confirmed cases, recovered cases, and mortality
using statistical, epidemiological and machine learning models are as follows. Shortterm forecasting of cumulative confirmed cases was produced using autoregressive
integrated moving average (ARIMA), Cubist regression, Random Forest, Ridge,
Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Stacking-Ensemble Learning (SEL) model
in [46] whereas Exponential smoothing model produced ten days ahead forecasts of
actual cases within 90% CI and forecasts reflect the significant increase in the trend
of global cases with growing uncertainty [43]. Forecasting and nowcasting domestic
and international COVID-19 cases is also done with epidemiological compartmental
models, like Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) and SIR models
[14,45,56]. Modern machine learning techniques like neural networks and black-box
deep learning models were also used for COVID-19 forecasting [50,52]. However,
forecasting COVID-19 cases is harder and this is primarily due to the following major
factors [28]: (a) Very less amount of data is available; (b) Less understanding of the
factors that contribute to it; (c) Model accuracy is constrained by our knowledge
of the virus. With an emerging disease such as COVID-19, many biologic features
of transmission are hard to measure and remain unknown; (d) Another source of
uncertainty, affecting all models, is that we don’t know how many people are, or have
been, infected; (e) We are certainly missing a substantial number of cases due to virologic testing, so models fitted to confirmed cases are likely to be highly uncertain [21].

Time-series forecasting models take input of historical observations and extrapolate
the patterns into the future. The past in no way will continue in the future for this
pandemic, so it is challenging to model and produce predictions. There are essentially
two general approaches to forecasting a time series: (a) generating forecasts from a
single model; and (b) combining forecasts from many models (Hybrid). In classical
time series forecasting, the ARIMA model is used predominantly for forecasting linear
time series [4], which has a significant strong assumption of linearity in the system
and homoscedastic error distribution; typically without sudden jumps and bursts.
Individual models such as ARIMA, Wavelet ARIMA (WARIMA)[11], and Theta
method [1,26] are inadequate to model such situations. Usage of nonlinear time series
techniques in infectious disease modeling has successfully demonstrated the success
of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Autoregressive Neural Networks (ARNN)
[6,32,34,58]. The idea of hybridizing forecasting models is not a new concept and
their empirical applications resulted in superior forecasts to their counterparts. Most
recently, some hybrid models combining linear and nonlinear time series models are
proposed for COVID-19 [9,16] and performed exceptionally well for predicting these
epidemics.

Motivated by this, this study considers the time series data sets of coronavirus
confirmed cases that show non-linearity, non-stationary and non-Gaussian patterns,
thus making decisions based on a discrete model critical and unreliable. Another difficulty in COVID-19 data from the modeling aspect is the unavailability of sufficient
data points, which generates biased predictions and estimates, which can be well maneuvered by neural nets [38]. Most of the relevant studies focused on the outbreak’s
short-term and long-term forecasts of reported confirmed cases have a broad range of
fluctuations, wide confidence intervals, poorly reported data and model specifics, and
highly optimistic predictive performance [57]. Hybridization of two or more models is
the most common solution [36] for optimizing forecasting performance, and efficiency
with unknown complete data characteristics [30]. The importance of hybrid methodology with a fusion of linear and non-linear forecasting models becomes evident in
tackling such dynamic/non-linear time series and its inbuilt time-changing variance,
complex autocorrelation structure [9,42]. With the growing need for advanced parsimonious hybrid forecasting methods accompanied by precise accuracy and accurate
forecasts, the main objectives of this study are:
(1) To propose a simple and computationally efficient hybrid forecasting model
which generates out-of-sample forecasts (two months) for five profoundly affected
countries (United States of America (USA), Brazil, India, UK, and Canada) with
higher accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art forecasting methods..
(2) To prove the model’s stationarity and ergodicity properties from a statistical
point of view.
(3) To discuss the merits and future challenges that needs attention while working
with the proposal for epidemiological forecasting. We also recommend policymaking decisions, resource allocation based on these forecasts.
Therefore, this study proposes a novel hybrid Theta Autoregressive neural network
model (TARNN) model combining Theta and ARNN models that can capture
complex COVID-19 data structures. The proposed TARNN model has easy interpretability, produces robust predictions, and is adaptable to seasonality. An RShiny
application is also built for TARNN can help practitioners reproducing and updating

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the formulation of
the proposed hybrid TARNN model. The ergodicity and stationarity of the proposed
hybrid model are discussed in Section 3. In Section 4, we discuss the country-wise
COVID-19 confirmed case data sets and experimental results. The discussions about
the results and practical implications are given in Section 5.

The ‘Theta method’ or ‘Theta model’ is a univariate time series forecasting technique
that performs particularly well in M3 forecasting competition and of interest to forecasters [1]. The method decomposes the original data into two or more lines, called
theta lines, and extrapolates them using forecasting models. Finally, the predictions
are combined to obtain the final forecasts. The theta lines can be estimated by simply
modifying the ‘curvatures’ of the original time series. This change is obtained from a
coefficient, called θ coefficient, which is directly applied to the second differences of
the time series:
”

Ynew
(θ) = θYdata

”
where Ydata
= Yt −2Yt−1 +Yt−2 at time t for t = 3, 4, · · · , n and {Y1 , Y2 , · · · , Yn } denote
the observed univariate time series. In practice, the coefficient θ can be considered as a
transformation parameter which creates a series of the same mean and slope with that
of the original data but having different variances. Now, Eqn. (1) is a second-order
difference equation and has solutions of the following form [26]:

Ynew (θ) = aθ + bθ (t − 1) + θYt ,
149

153

where aθ and bθ are constants and t = 1, 2, · · · , n. Thus, Ynew (θ) is equivalent to a
linear function of Yt with a linear trend added. The values of aθ and bθ are computed
by minimizing the sum of squared differences:
t

[Yt − Ynew (θ)] =

[(1 − θ)Yt − aθ − bθ (t − 1)]2 .

Forecasts from the Theta model are obtained by a weighted average of forecasts of
Ynew (θ) for different values of θ. Furthermore, the prediction intervals and likelihoodbased estimation of the parameters can be obtained based on a state space model
which is demonstrated in [26]. The generalized version of the Theta method is suitable
for automatic forecasting of time series [51].

2.2. ARNN Model
Artificial Neural Network-based forecasting methods received increasing interest in
various applied domains in the late 1990s. A wide variety of neural nets are popularly
used for supervised classification, prediction, and nonlinear time series forecasting [59].
The architecture of a simple feedforward neural network can be described as a network
of neurons arranged in an input layer, hidden layer, and output layer in a prescribed
order. Each layer passes the information to the next layer using weights that are
obtained using a learning algorithm [15]. ARNN model is a modification to the simple
ANN model especially designed for prediction problems of time series data sets [15].
ARNN model uses a prespecified number of lagged values of the time series as inputs
and the number of hidden neurons in its architecture is also fixed [24]. ARNN(p, k)
model uses p lagged inputs of the time series data in a one hidden layered feedforward
neural network with k hidden units in the hidden layer. Let x denotes a p-lagged inputs
and f is a neural network of the following architecture:
f (x) = c0 +

k
X


wj φ aj + b0j x ;

(4)

j=1

177

where c0 , aj , wj are connecting weights, bj are p-dimensional weight vector and φ is
a bounded nonlinear sigmoidal function (e.g., logistic squasher function or tangent
hyperbolic activation function). These Weights are trained using a gradient descent
backpropagation [49]. Standard ANN faces the dilemma to choose the number of hidden neurons in the hidden layer and the optimal choice is unknown. However, for
ARNN model, we adopt the formula k = [(p + 1)/2] for non-seasonal time series data
where p is the number of lagged inputs in an autoregressive model [24].

In this section, we describe the proposed hybrid model based on Theta method and
ARNN model and we name it TARNN model. The proposed TARNN model is based
on an error remodeling approach and there are broadly two types of error calculations
popular in the literature which are given below [35].
Definition 2.1. In the additive error model, the forecaster treats the expert’s estimate
as a variable, Ŷt , and thinks of it as the sum of two terms:
Ŷt = Yt + et ,

183

where Yt is the true value and et is the additive error term.
Definition 2.2. In the multiplicative error model, the forecaster treats the expert’s
estimate Ŷt as the product of two terms:
Ŷt = Yt × et ,

184

185
186

where Yt is the true value and et be the multiplicative error term.
Now, even if the relationship is of product type, in the log-log scale, it becomes
additive. Hence, without loss of generality, we may assume the relationship to be

additive and expect the errors (additive) of a forecasting model to be random shocks.
However, this is violated when there are complex correlation structures in the time
series data and less amount of knowledge is available about the data generating process.
A simple example is the daily confirmed cases of the COVID-19 cases for various
countries where very little is known about the structural properties of the current
pandemic. Thus, we need two-stage modeling approach to formulate this complex
time series problem. The proposed TARNN model is a hybrid model based on the
additive error re-modeling approach. The hybrid TARNN approach consists of three
basic steps:
• In the first step of the TARNN model, the Theta method is applied to the time
series data to model the linear components of a given time series data set.
• Theta model generates in-sample forecasts and the error series is calculated.
• In the next phase, the residuals (additive errors) generated by the Theta method
are remodeled using a nonlinear ARNN model. Finally, both the forecasts obtained from the Theta and ARNN models are combined together to get the final
forecasts for the given time series.
The mathematical formulation of the proposed hybrid TARNN model (Zt ) is as
follows:
Zt = Lt + Nt ,

205
206
207
208

where Lt is the linear part and Nt is the nonlinear part of the hybrid model. We can
estimate both Lt and Nt from the available time series data. Let L̂t be the forecast
value of the Theta model at time t and t represent the error residuals at time t,
obtained from the Theta model. Then, we write
t = Zt − L̂t .

209
210

These left-out residuals are further modeled by ARNN model and can be represented
as follows:
t = f (t−1 , t−2 , ..., t−p ) + εt ,

211
212
213

where f is a nonlinear function and the modeling is done by the ARNN model as
defined in Eqn. (4) and εt is supposed to be random shocks. Therefore, the combined
forecast can be obtained as follows:
Ẑt = L̂t + N̂t ,

214
215

where N̂t is the forecasted value of the ARNN model. An overall flow diagram of the
proposed TARNN model is given in Figure 1.

216
217
218
219
220
221
222
223

In the proposed TARNN model, ARNN is applied to remodel the left-over autocorrelations in the residuals which Theta model individually could not model. Thus, the
proposed TARNN model can be considered as an error re-modeling approach. This is
important because due to model mis-specification and disturbances in the pandemic
time series, the linear Theta model may fail to generate white noise behavior for the
forecast residuals. The TARNN approach eventually can improve the predictions for
the epidemiological forecasting problem as shown in Section 4.

Remark 1. The idea of additive error modelling is useful for modeling complex time
series for which achieving random shocks based on individual forecasting models is
difficult. More precisely, the TARNN approach is developed for forecasting the COVID19 confirmed cases for which the data generating process and the various characteristics
of the epidemic are still unknown. The proposed TARNN model only assumes that
the linear and nonlinear components of the epidemic time series can be separated
individually.

In this section, we derive the results for the ergodicity and asymptotic stationarity
of the proposed TARNN model. The ergodicity and stationarity is of particular
importance from a statistician’s point of view in time series analysis since for such
processes a single realization displays the whole probability of the data generating
process. We use several previous results on nonlinear time series and Markov chains
to find sufficient conditions for which the overall process is ergodic and stationary
[5,7,10,53].

To start, we write the underlying stochastic model of the Theta method using
the state space approach. We initialize the model by setting Y1 = l1 and then for
t = 2, 3, · · · ; and drift term b, let
Yt = lt−1 + b + t and lt = lt−1 + b + αt ;
240
241
242
243

where {t } is assumed to follow Gaussian white noise with mean zero and variance σ 2
and α is the smoothing parameter for the simple exponential smoothing (SES) model.
Now, Yt follows a state space model which gives forecasts equivalent to SES with drift
[26]. Also, Yt can be written in the following form:
Yt = Yt−1 + b + (α − 1)t−1 + t .

244
245
246
247

(5)

The above is an ARIMA(0,1,1) process with drift term [26]. The left-out residuals of
Theta model is further modeled by ARNN process. We consider the ARNN process
generated by the additive noise of the ARIMA(0,1,1) process with drift. Let t be the
process defined by the stochastic difference equation of the following form:
t = f (t−1 , t−2 , · · · , t−p , Θ) + εt ,

(6)

250

where εt is an i.i.d. noise process and f (·, Θ) is a feedforward neural network with
weight (parameter) vector Θ and inputs t−1 , t−2 , · · · , t−p . The definition of f is
given in Eqn. (4).

We start by defining the following notations:

Then Eqn. (6) can be written as follows [10]:
zt = F (zt−1 ) + et

with zt , et ∈ Rp . In this section, we show the (strict) stationarity of the state space
form, as defined in Eqn. (7). The problem of showing {zt } to be stationary is closely
related to the ergodicity of the process [55]. A Markov chain {zt } is called geometrically
ergodic if there exists a probability measure π on the state space (Rp , B) and a constant
ρ > 1 such that

The definition for P n (z, A) can be given as the probability that {zn } moves from z
to the set A ∈ B in n steps: P n (z, A) = P (zt+n ∈ A|zt = z) . Also, expression for π(A)
is as follows:
Z
π(A) = P 1 (z, A)π(dz) for all A ∈ B.
Thus, we call π as the stationary measure and the distribution of zt converges to π if
{zt } is ergodic. Then, we say {zt } is asymptotically stationary [33]. To establish the
ergodicity of TARNN processes, we need the concept of irreducibility and aperiodicity.
A Markov chain {zt } is called irreducible if

whenever λ(A) > 0 and λ denotes the Lebesgue measure on (Rp , B). Thus, for an
irreducible Markov chain, all parts of the state space can be reached by the Markov
chain irrespective of the starting point. Now, an irreducible Markov chain is aperiodic
if there exists an A ∈ B with λ(A) > 0 and for all C ∈ B, C ⊆ A with λ(C) > 0, there
exists a positive integer n such that
P n (z, C) > 0 and P n+1 (z, C) > 0 for all z ∈ Rp .

Hence, it is possible that the Markov chain returns to given sets only at specific time
points for an aperiodic Markov chain. For most general time series models, irreducibility and aperiodicity cannot be assumed automatically. However, for a TARNN process,
these conditions can be checked. In general, it is sufficient to assume the distribution of
the noise process to be an absolutely continuous component with respect to Lebesgue
measure and the support of the probability density function (PDF) is sufficiently large.

It is clear from the above discussion that if the Markov chain is geometrically ergodic,
then its distribution will converge to π and the corresponding time series will be called
asymptotically stationary, see also [53]. Lemma 3.1 states that the state space of the
Markov chain cannot be reduced depending on the starting point.
Lemma 3.1. Let {zt } is defined by (7), and let E|εt | < ∞ and the PDF of εt is positive
everywhere in R. Then if f is defined by (4), the Markov chain {zt } is ϕ-irreducible
and aperiodic.
Proof. Since the support of the PDF of εt is the whole real line, that is, the PDF
is positive everywhere in R, then we can say that {zt } is ϕ-irreducible by using [10].
In our case, every non-null p-dimensional hypercube can be reached in p steps with
positive probability (and hence every non-null Borel set A). A necessary and sufficient
condition for {zt } to be aperiodic is to have a set A and positive integer n such that
P n (z, A) > 0 and P n+1 (z, A) > 0 for all z ∈ A [53]. In this case, this is true for all n
due to consideration of the unbounded additive noise.

The theorem below states the necessary conditions for geometric ergodicity of a
Markov chain. This can be obtained using the decomposition technique and ergodicity
of stochastic difference equations [7,10].

290

Theorem 3.2. Suppose {zt } is defined as in (6) and (7), F be a compact set that can
be decomposed as F = Fh + Fd , and the following conditions hold:
(i) Fh (.) is continuous and homogeneous and Fd (.) is bounded;
(ii) E|εt | < ∞ and probability distribution function of εt is positive everywhere in R;
then {zt } is geometrically ergodic.

291

Proof. {zt } satisfies the following equation:

Let Fh be continuous and homogeneous, viz., Fh (cz) = cFh (z) for all c > 0, zt ∈ Rp ,
and Fd is bounded. Let the origin, O, be a fixed point of Fh . It is important to note that
εt satisfies the condition (ii) in Theorem 3.2. We are going to show that the existence

ensure the geometric ergodicity of (7).

To start with we let W ⊆ Rp , the closure of W by W and its boundary by W
let V be defined over the closure of the unit ball. We let p0 = inf kzk=1 V (z), where
k · k denote the Euclidean norm. Also, let G be the maximal connected component of
{z : V (z) < p20 } that contains the origin. Then we have F (G) ⊂ G.
Let g(z) = inf{r ≥ 0, z ∈ rG}, z ∈ Rp , where rG = {rz, z ∈ G}. Then g(z) is well
defined and it can easily be checked that g has the following properties:

(2) f (y)P (z, dy) < 21 (1 + θ)h(z) when ||z|| > r0 .
Using Theorem 4 of [55], we can conclude that {zt } is geometric ergodic.
The next theorem gives the main result for asymptotic stationary of the TARNN
model.
Theorem 3.3. Let E|εt | < ∞ and the PDF of εt is positive everywhere in R, and {εt }
and {zt } are defined as in (6) and (7), respectively. Then if f is a nonlinear neural
network as defined in (4), then {zt } is geometrically ergodic and {εt } is asymptotically
stationary.
Proof. The noise process εt satisfies E|εt | < ∞ by assumption (e.g., Gaussian noise).
It is also important to note that neural network activation functions, more precisely
logistics or tan-hyperbolic activation functions, are continuous compact functions and
have a bounded range. Thus {zt } satisfies all the criteria to be geometrically ergodic
and using Theorem (3.2), one can write that for the ARNN process with Fh ≡ 0 and
Fd ≡ F . Thus, the series {εt } is asymptotically stationary.
Remark 2. Some interpretations and practical implications of the theoretical results
are given below:
• The geometric rate of convergence in Theorem 3.3 implies that the memory
of TARNN process vanishes exponentially fast. This implies that the simplest
version of the proposed model converges to a Wiener process.
• This is important for predictions over larger intervals of time, for example, one
might train the network on an available sample and then use the trained network
to generate new data with similar properties like the training sample. The results

for the asymptotic stationarity can guarantee that the proposed hybrid model
can not have growing variance over time.
• From practitioners point of view, when the data is generated by the irreducible
TARNN process, the estimated weights are not too far from the true weights.
Then, one can draw an indirect conclusion on the statistical nature of the observed data based on the estimated weights.

performance of the models used in this study. Since the number of data points in all

where, yi is the actual value, yˆi is the predicted value, and n denotes the number of
data points. MASE is computed using ‘mase’ function available under the “Metrics”
package in R statistical software. By definition, the lower the value of these performance metrics, the better is the performance of the concerned forecasting model.

In the proposed TARNN model, linear modelling is conducted with Theta model
using ‘thetaf’ function under the “forecast” package in R statistical software.
Nonlinear modelling with ARNN approach is carried out with “caret” package using
‘nnetar’ function in R statistical software. Furthermore, Theta residuals are modelled
with ARNN(p, k) model having a pre-defined Box-Cox transformation set λ = 0 to
ensure the forecast values to stay positive. The values of p and k are obtained by
training the network, which is a data-dependent approach as discussed in Section
2.2. Further, both the linear and nonlinear forecasts are summed up to obtain
the final forecasts. Theta model was fitted to five data sets namely USA, Brazil,
India, UK, and Canada. Theta model residuals for these five countries were trained
using ARNN(15,8), ARNN(21,11), ARNN(25,13), ARNN(24,12), ARNN(12,6), and
ARNN(9,5) models with an average of 500 networks for all five data sets, each of
which is a 15-8-1, 21-11-1, 25-13-1, 24-12-1, 12-6-1, and 9-5-1 networks with 137,
254, 352, 313, 85, and 56 weights and with 5807711, 309816, 20735, 883.6, 209396,
and 59477 estimated σ 2 , respectively. Finally, the predicted results of both Theta
and ARNN models are added together to obtain the estimated forecasts of the proposed TARNN model. Rest of the hybrid models were compared in the similar fashion.

reported in Table 4. The performance of the proposed hybrid Theta-ARNN (TARNN)
model is superior compared to all traditional individual and hybrid models on average.
The theoretically proven asymptotic stationarity of the proposed hybrid model also
suggests that the model cannot have a growing variance over time. The consistency
and adequacy in the experimental results empirically approves the same. Thus, the
efficacy of the proposed methodology of the proposed hybrid model is experimentally
validated. Nevertheless, no model can have dominant advantage and this is related
to no free lunch theorem in statistical learning [20]. Forecast of COVID-19 cases for
March 20-29, 2021 are generated using proposed TARNN model and shown in Figure 3.

model filters linearity using the Theta model and can better explain the linear,
nonlinear, and nonstationary tendencies present in the selected COVID-19 data sets
compared to the traditional single and hybrid models. It also yields better forecast
accuracy than various traditional single and hybrid models for three out of five
countries. The proposal will be useful in decision and policy making for government
officials and policymakers to allocate adequate health care resources for the coming
days in responding to the crisis. Time series of epidemics can oscillate heavily due to
various epidemiological factors and these fluctuations are challenging to be captured
adequately for precise forecasting. This newly developed model can still predict with
better accuracy provided the conditions of asymptotic stationarity of the hybrid
model are satisfied. This method can be used to update real-time forecasts as more
data becomes available. The study covering multiple countries can be utilized without
geographical borders and reflects the impact of social distancing, wearing masks,
lock down, shutdown, quarantine, and sanitizing proper measures implemented by
authorities. Prevalent techniques in literature were unable to completely capture
the nonlinear behavior of stochastic time series containing inherent random shock
components. This new method have significant theoretical (established ergodicity
and stationarity of the proposed TARNN process) as well as practical implications.
Authorities and health care can modify their planning in stockpiles and hospital-beds
depending on these forecasts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Many parameters associated with COVID-19 transmission are still poorly understood. The resulting model uncertainty is not always calculated or reported in a standardized way. Once we can incorporate these variables, we can improve our estimates
and update the TARNN model accordingly. Since purely statistical approaches do not
account for how transmission occurs, they are generally not well suited for long-term
predictions about epidemiological dynamics (such as when the peak will occur and
whether a resurgence will happen) or for inferences about intervention efficacy. Most
forecasting models therefore limit their projections to one week or a few weeks ahead.
Moreover, the problem of using confirmed cases to fit models is further complicated
by the fact that the fraction of cases that are confirmed is spatially heterogeneous and
time-varying. Amid enormous uncertainty about the future of the COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed TARNN model yields quantitative projections that policymakers
may need in the short term to allocate resources or plan interventions. To conclude,
this model can further be easily extended for similar nonlinear and non-Gaussian forecasting problems arising in other applied domains.
