Abstract
Background: To date, several clinical laboratory parameters associated with COVID-19 severity
have been reported. However, these parameters have not been observed consistently across
studies. The aim of this review was to assess clinical laboratory parameters which may serve as
markers or predictors of severe or critical COVID-19 disease
Methods: We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL
and Google Scholar databases from 2019 through April 18, 2020, and reviewed bibliographies of
eligible studies, relevant systematic reviews, and the medRxiv pre-print server. We included
hospital-based observational studies reporting clinical laboratory parameters of confirmed cases
of COVID-19 and excluded studies having large proportions (>10%) of children and pregnant
women. Two authors independently carried out screening of articles, data extraction and quality
assessment. Meta-analyses were done using random effects model. Meta-median difference
(MMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each laboratory parameter.
Results: Forty-five studies in 6 countries were included. Compared to non-severe COVID-19
cases, severe or critical COVID-19 disease was characterised by higher neutrophil count (MMD:
1.23 [95% CI: 0.58 to 1.88] ×109 cells/L), and lower lymphocyte and CD4 counts with MMD
(95% CI) of -0.39 (-0.47, -0.31) ×109 cells/L and -204.9 (-302.6, -107.1) cells/μl, respectively.
Other notable results were observed for C-reactive protein (MMD: 36.97 [95% CI: 27.58, 46.35]
mg/L), interleukin-6 (MMD: 17.37 [95% CI: 4.74, 30.00] pg/ml,), Troponin I (MMD: 0.01 [0.00,
0.02] ng/ml), and D-dimer (MMD: 0.65 [0.45, 0.85] mg/ml).
Conclusions and Relevance: Relative to non-severe COVID-19, severe or critical COVID-19 is
characterised by increased markers of innate immune response, decreased markers of adaptive
immune response, and increased markers of tissue damage and major organ failure. These
markers could be used to recognise severe or critical disease and to monitor clinical course of
COVID-19.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging zoonosis caused by Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1, 2]. Phylogenetically, SARS-CoV-2
sufficiently differs from other zoonotic coronaviruses, such as Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
(MERS-CoV) introduced to humans in the past two decades [1, 3]. Disease resulting from
infection with SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and the virus
rapidly spread to other regions of the world thereafter [4, 5]. Given the scale of the outbreak,
COVID-19 was declared a pandemic on March 12 2020 by the World Health Organization [6].
As of April 19, 2020, there have been 2,394,291 confirmed cases in 185 countries/regions and
164,938 COVID-related deaths [7].

Clinical features of infection with SARS-CoV-2 vary widely and have been classified as mild,
severe or critical, with some persons remaining asymptomatic [8, 9]. Majority of SARS-CoV-2
infected persons display mild symptoms similar to a viral upper respiratory tract infection such
as dry cough, fever, sore throat, nasal congestion, and muscle pain [8-10]. Severe COVID-19 is
characterised by features of severe pneumonia such as dyspnoea, respiratory frequency ≥30
breaths per minute and blood oxygen saturation ≤93%, while critical COVID-19 is characterised
by respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ failure [8, 9]. Severe or critical
COVID-19 is highly associated with mortality [11]. In a single-centre observational study of
critical COVID-19 patients, up to 61% of critical COVID-19 patients and 94% of critical
COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation died within 28 days of admission into the
intensive care unit [12].

Currently, there is no approved cure for infection with SARS-CoV-2 and an effective vaccine is
not yet available. Approximately 18% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases have severe or critical
disease, and about 5% of diagnosed COVID-19 require intensive care management with or
without mechanical ventilation [8, 13]. Consequently, there is substantial pressure on healthcare
systems worldwide, particularly on intensive care units. As healthcare systems become further
stretched by the increasing numbers of cases, identifying clinical laboratory parameters
associated with severe and critical cases is crucial in helping clinicians triage patients

appropriately and optimize use of the limited healthcare resources. Furthermore, as more clinical
trials are being launched to test possible treatments for COVID-19, laboratory parameters
associated with COVID-19 severity can aid in monitoring the clinical evolution of cases on trial
drugs and serve as composite or secondary outcomes for these trials.

To date, changes in several clinical laboratory parameters have been linked to COVID-19
severity [4, 13-16]. However, it is not clear if these changes are observed consistently across
studies. With these considerations in mind, the objective of this systematic review and metaanalysis was to investigate which clinical laboratory parameters may be associated with severe or
critical COVID-19 disease.

Methods
Protocol and registration
We registered our study protocol with the International Prospective Register of Systematic
Reviews (PROSPERO); registration number CRD42020176651 [17]. This review and metaanalysis was conducted and has been reported according to The Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses (PRISMA) statement and Meta-analysis of
Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines [18, 19].
Eligibility criteria
This review and meta-analysis included observational studies reporting clinical laboratory
parameters among patients with confirmed COVID-19. Cases were diagnosed using guidelines
by either the World Health Organization or the China National Commission for Health [20, 21].
The exposure of interest of this review was severe or critical COVID-19 and the comparator was
non-severe COVID-19. According to the criteria defined by China National Health Commission,
severe COVID-19 is characterised by dyspnoea, ≥30 breaths/minute, blood oxygen saturation

≤93%, arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO²/FiO²) ratio <300,
and/or lung infiltrates >50% within 24–48 hours; and critical COVID-19 is characterised by
respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ failure [22]. Non-severe COVID-19 is
defined by no or mild pneumonia [22]. We also considered COVID-19 cases requiring oxygen
therapy, and COVID-19 cases admitted to intensive care units as severe or critical cases.
The outcomes of interest were clinical laboratory parameters. These included hematologic
indices (White blood cells, Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Platelets, Haemoglobin,
CD3, CD4, CD8), biochemical indices (Total bilirubin, Alanine aminotransferase, Aspartate
aminotransferase, Total protein, Albumin, Globulin, Prealbumin, Urea, Creatinine, Glucose,
Creatine kinase muscle-brain, Troponin I, Cholinesterase, Cystatin C, Lactate dehydrogenase, αhydroxybutyric dehydrogenase), infection/inflammation-related indices (C-reactive protein [high
sensitivity and standard], Interleukin-6, Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Procalcitonin, Serum
ferritin), coagulation indices (Prothrombin time, Activated partial thromboplastin, D-dimer) and
electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, Chloride).

We included only hospital-based studies and excluded reviews, opinion articles, and studies that
did not report clinical laboratory parameters stratified by COVID-19 disease severity. Also, as
children and pregnant women have different cut-off values for most clinical laboratory
parameters compared to general adults, we excluded studies that examined populations with
large proportions of children under 11 years of age and pregnant women to reduce clinical
heterogeneity. We considered studies that included children, pregnant women along with the
general adult population as eligible only if the proportion of children or pregnant women
constituted less than 10%.
Search strategy
We conducted a systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Clarivate Analytics Web
of Science Core Collection, EBSCO CINAHL and Google Scholar databases from 2019 through
April 18, 2020. The search strategy used both controlled vocabulary and free text words relevant
to COVID-19 and clinical laboratory parameters (see search strategy in Supplement S1). We also
reviewed bibliographies of eligible studies, relevant systematic reviews to identify additional
papers that were missed by the electronic search. Further, we performed a manual search of the
medRxiv pre-print server to identify latest relevant studies that might still be undergoing peerreview. The search was limited to the years 2019-2020 and there was no limitation regarding
language of publication.
Study selection
Following deduplication of records retrieved during the systematic search, we exported retained
articles into Covidence review manager to facilitate the screening of titles and abstracts, which
was followed by a full text review to determine eligibility [23].
Two authors (JM and PP) independently carried out title and abstract screening and full text
evaluation of all articles using the eligibility criteria listed in the previous section. The
discrepancies in study selection were resolved through adjudication by a third author (KM). To
avoid including data on the same patient populations more than once in the meta-analysis, we
matched studies based on the location of the study (hospital, town) and the period over which
data was collected. For two or more studies conducted at the same location over the same or

overlapping periods, we included only the largest study, unless one of the smaller studies
presented relevant information not included in the larger study.
Data extraction and Data items
Two authors (JM and PP) independently extracted, verified and summarized data from each
study included in the meta-analysis. The information extracted from the selected studies
included: study author(s), study sponsors, date of publication, study period, study location, study
design, sample size, sample characteristics (age, gender, comorbidities), exposure characteristics
(study definition of severity of COVID-19, timing of classification of disease severity [on
admission or otherwise], number of cases with non-severe COVID-19, number of cases with
severe or critical COVID-19), timing of blood sample collection (on admission or otherwise),
clinical laboratory parameters stratified by COVID-19 severity, mean (standard deviation [SD])
and/or median (interquartile range [IQR] or minimum-maximum [total] range) of clinical
laboratory parameters when reported on continuous scales, and numbers (percentages) of cases
above and below cut-off values when reported on categorical scales. Discrepancies in collected
data were resolved by re-checking the primary studies until consensus was reached. For the
studies which had unclear severity classification, the authors were contacted to seek additional
clarification. Studies in the Chinese language were translated into English language by a Chinese
native speaker. The extracted data were exported into R programming software.
Quality assessment
Two authors (AK and MN) independently carried out quality assessment of each article using
National Institutes of Health (NIH) study quality assessment tools for observational cohort and
cross-sectional studies, and for case series studies [24]. These tools were used to evaluate the risk
of bias and to assess the overall validity of reported results. Each study was assessed using all
elements of the relevant tool, and an overall judgement was made by considering the responses
to the various elements. An overall rating of poor quality translates to a high risk of bias, and an
overall rating of good quality translates to a low risk of bias [24]. The final decision for each
study was made through professional judgement and by consensus among the authors. We
evaluated the impact of studies with a high risk of bias by doing sensitivity analysis using the
Leave-One-Out method [25].

Summary measures and data synthesis
Where clinical laboratory parameters were measured on a continuous scale, we pooled median
differences from each study using the quantile estimation method [26]. The result of this analysis
was expressed as a meta-median difference (MMD) accompanied by a corresponding 95 %
confidence interval (CI).

We preferred median differences over mean differences because

clinical laboratory indices are usually skewed, and mean values could be influenced by outlier
values, particularly in small samples. We performed a sensitivity analysis by pooling mean
differences from each study using inverse variance weighting. Where the studies reported only
median (IQR or total range) values, we computed mean (SD) using methods previously
described [27, 28].
Where clinical laboratory parameters were measured on a categorical scale, we computed
prevalence ratios for each study using counts of events in the exposure and comparator group
and calculated meta-prevalence ratios (MPR) and the 95% CIs using the Mantel-Haenszel
method.
Meta-analysis was conducted using random effect models. We assessed clinical heterogeneity
(age distribution, comorbidities criteria of severity) and study methodological heterogeneity
(timing of blood sample collection) and considered the potential impact of these factors on the
meta-analysis results. We assessed statistical heterogeneity using Cochran’s Q test and calculated
the I² statistic, which was interpreted using cut-offs of 25%, 50%, and 75% for low, moderate,
and substantial heterogeneity, respectively. We performed influence analysis using the LeaveOne-Out-method to identify studies that have a high influence on our results [25]. Additional
sensitivity analyses were performed by excluding ‘outlier’ studies. A study-specific estimate was
considered an outlier if its confidence interval did not overlap with the confidence interval of the
meta-estimate [25].
To detect possible publication bias, funnel plots were constructed for the 4 laboratory parameters
with the highest number of individual studies. Egger’s test was carried out to assess statistical
symmetry of the plots.

Results
Study selection
We identified 3,779 studies through database searching and from other sources (Figure 1). After
removing duplicates, 1722 unique records were screened, and of those, 1398 were removed after
title and abstract review. Additional 257 records were excluded due to lack of COVID-19
severity classification, lack of laboratory parameter records or ineligible study design. Of the 67
remaining studies, another 22 were excluded because they used data from the same locations or
covered overlapping periods (see Supplement S2). A total of 45 studies were retained for metaanalyses.
Study characteristics
The characteristics of included studies are detailed in Table 1 and Supplement S3. All studies
included in the meta-analyses were observational and hospital based. The majority of 45 studies
(87%) were from China; and of those, 14 were from Wuhan and 25 from other locations in
China. Two studies were from the USA, and the remaining 4 studies were from France,
Germany, Japan and Singapore. All studies were published in 2020 and the data collection
covered the period from December 25th, 2019 to April 2nd, 2020. The median population size of
the included studies was 97 (IQR: 49 – 221). Data were collected retrospectively in all but one
study [30]. COVID-19 severity was classified using China National Health Commission
guidelines (20 studies), WHO guidelines (4 studies), American Thoracic Society guidelines (2
studies), Berlin criteria (1 study), Complementary and Natural Healthcare council (1 study), or
unspecified guidelines (17 studies). Studies classified severity on admission (22 studies, 49%),
on the ward (11 studies, 24%), or during unspecified periods (12 studies, 27%). Clinical
laboratory tests were done on admission (33 studies, 73%), post-admission (5 studies, 11%) and
at unspecified periods (7 studies, 16%). The highest number of laboratory parameters reported in
a single study was 30 [31] and the lowest number of laboratory parameters reported in a single
study was 2 [32].
The median (or mean) age of patients in the included studies ranged from 35 years to 67 years,
and the proportion of male patients ranged from 30% to 81%. Patients in the included studies had
varying proportions of comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and cancer as detailed in
Table 1 (and Supplement S3).

Synthesis of results
Results of meta-analyses are reported in Table 2, and Forest plots and Leave-One-Out analysis
are displayed in supplement S4.
As pertains to haematological parameters, the majority of studies reported higher white cell
count and higher neutrophil count in severe or critical COVID-19 patients relative to non-severe
COVID-19 patients. Median difference in individual studies ranged from -1.6 to 7.3 (×109
cells/L) for white cell count and from -1.0 to 5.2 (×109 cells/L) for neutrophil count. The MMD
estimates (109 cells/L) were 0.87 (95% CI: 0.35 to 1.40; I2: 80.5%) for white cell count and 1.23
(95% CI 0.58 to 1.88; I2: 90%) for neutrophil count. When the results were expressed in terms
of ratio measures, patients with severe or critical COVID-19 had significantly higher likelihood
of having leucocytosis (MPR: 3.95 [95% CI: 2.35, 6.65], I2: 64%) and neutrophilia (MPR: 4.29
[95% CI: 1.74, 10.64], I2: 86%). All but one of 27 studies reported lower lymphocyte count in
severe or critical COVID-19 patients relative to patients with non-severe disease. Median
difference in individual studies ranged from -0.8 to 0.2 (×109 cells/L).

The MMD for

2

lymphocyte count (×10 cells/L) was -0.39 (95% -0.47, -0.31; I : 78%), and the MPR for
lymphopenia was 2.02 (95% CI: 1.52, 2.69; I2: 92%). Also, severe or critical COVID-19 patients
had relatively lower CD3 count (MMD: -380.8 [-515.3, -246.4], I2: 80%), CD4 count (MMD: 204.9 [-302.6, -107.1], I2: 87%) and CD8 count (MMD: -123.6 [-170.6, – 76.6] I2: 66%); all
differences measured in terms of cells/μl.
All studies that examined data on inflammation indices reported higher CRP, ESR and IL-6 level
in severely or critically ill patients. Median difference in individual studies ranged from 8.1 to
83.3 mg/L for CRP, from 4.7 to 52.4 mm/hr for ESR, and from 1.1 to 101.4 pg/ml for IL-6. The
corresponding MMD (95% CI; I2) estimates were 36.97 (27.58, 46.35; 85%), 21.93 (10.59,
33.28; 88% for ESR, and 17.37 (4.74, 30.00; 95%) for IL-6. The MPR values for elevated CRP,
ESR and IL-6 were 1.50 [95% CI: 1.26, 1.77; I2: 91%), 1.67 (95% CI: 0.67, 4.18; I2: 98%) and
2.15 (95% CI: 0.95, 4.90; I2: 87%), respectively, although the data for the last two parameters
were limited to just three studies. Higher levels of ferritin, a positive acute-phase reactant, were
positively associated with severe or critical COVID-19 (MMD: 451.86 μg/L [95% CI: 212.91,

690.82] I2: 71%), whereas the same association with albumin, a negative acute-phase reactant,
was in the opposite direction (MMD: -4.99 g/L [95% CI: -6.47, -3.51], I2: 87%).
Additional significant differences between patients with severe or critical COVID-19 and their
non-severely ill counterparts were observed for liver enzymes, ALT (MMD: 6.89 U/L [95% CI;
4.69, 9.10], I2: 17%) and AST (MMD: 11.96 U/L [95% CI: 8.56, 15.37] I2: 68%); kidney
function parameters, urea (MMD: 1.04 mmol/l [95% CI: 0.64, 1.45], I2: 48%) and creatinine
(MMD: 4.87 μmol/l [95% CI: 2.40, 7.35], I2: 7%); biomarkers of myocardial function, troponin I
(MMD: 0.01 ng/ml [95% CI: 0.00, 0.02], I2: 0%) and CK-MB (MMD: 1.46 U/L [95% CI:0.22,
2.70], I2: 28%); measures of coagulation, D-dimer (MMD: 0.65 mg/ml [95% CI: 0.45, 0.85], I2:
84%) and platelet count (MMD: -21.48 ×109 cells/L [95% CI: -41.12, -1.83], I2: 92%); and
lactate dehydrogenase, a marker of tissue damage (MMD: 124.26 U/L [95% CI: 92.89, 155.64],
I2: 74%).
Assessment of threats to validity
The threats to validity in this meta-analysis fall into two broad categories: risk of bias in
individual studies, and publication bias across the body of literature. Assessments of these two
categories of threat to validity are presented below.
Using the NIH study quality assessment tools, 28 studies (62.2%) were rated as having a low risk
of bias, 14 studies (31.1%) were rated as having a medium risk of bias, and 3 studies (6.7%)
were rated as having a high risk of bias. The majority of studies had a clearly defined study
objective (97.8%), a well-defined study population (100%), and had comparable subjects
(100%). In contrast, no study provided a sample size calculation or power description. All the
studies were rated as having a high risk of bias for the element assessing a temporal sequence
between the laboratory measure and disease severity, and none of the reported results was
adjusted for potential confounding (Figure 2 and supplement S5). Our results did not markedly
differ in sensitivity analyses after excluding studies with a high risk of bias.
The symmetry of funnel plots obtained from the 4 laboratory parameters with the highest number
of individual studies was assessed using Egger’s test. The symmetrical funnel plots for Creactive protein (p: 0.155) and creatinine (p: 0.415) suggested no evidence of publication bias
whereas asymmetrical funnel plot for white cell count (p: 0.004) and lymphocyte count (p:

0.005) indicated significant influence of smaller studies, which may be indicative of publication
bias (Figure 3). Important to note that Egger’s test may not be robust for C-reactive protein,
white cell count and lymphocyte parameters due to substantial heterogeneity (I2>75%).
Additional analysis
In sensitivity analyses excluding outlier studies, statistical heterogeneity was reduced, and the
meta-estimate of most laboratory parameters were not markedly altered. In sensitivity analysis
using mean differences (supplement S6), there was substantial heterogeneity for most laboratory
parameters, and the associations observed from using median differences persisted.

Discussion
COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving pandemic with significant global morbidity and mortality. The
aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate which clinical laboratory parameters may be
associated with severe or critical COVID-19 disease. Out of the 39 clinical laboratory parameters
evaluated, we found that derangements in 36 clinical laboratory parameters were significantly
associated with severe or critical COVID-19. Whilst some of the observed associations may not
be clinically relevant, certain, more pronounced laboratory abnormalities may have important
clinical implications. Markers of an overactive innate immune system such as markedly elevated
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), IL-6, serum ferritin and C-reactive protein, and markers
of a deficient adaptive immune system such as lymphocytes and CD4 count could help recognise
potential severe infections during triage, while markers of organ failure could be helpful in
monitoring evolution of hospitalised COVID-19 patients.
Following infection with a virus, the innate immune system in activated. This early response is
nonspecific and serves to limit virus multiplication during the acute phase [33]. The adaptive
immune system is activated a few days later and is responsible for a more specific response,
which is immunomodulatory (via engagement of helper T cells and regulatory T cells) and
produces ‘immunological memory’ [33]. Elevated lymphocyte count is commonly found in most
viral infections, and the magnitude and quality of T cell responses may determine the fate of
these infections [34, 35]. Failure to mount an appropriate adaptive immune response means the
innate immune response remains continuously stimulated with deleterious effects on the lungs
and other organs. We found that severe or critical COVID-19 patients had increased markers of
innate immune system activity compared to patients with non-severe disease. This is evidenced
in the significantly higher levels of neutrophils, IL-6, and acute phase reaction markers such as
CRP, ESR and serum ferritin, as well as decreased concentrations of albumin and prealbumin.
Severe or critical COVID-19 patients also exhibited defective adaptive immune response
evidenced by significantly lower levels of lymphocytes and their subsets (CD3, CD4, CD8). CD4
count is currently being used to define severe cases of HIV infection [36]. In the case of HIV, the
virus directly infects CD4 cells using the envelope glycoprotein gp120. Various authors have
suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could deplete lymphocytes directly by infecting T lymphocytes, or
indirectly through lymphocyte apoptosis induced by persistent elevated inflammatory cytokines
[15, 37, 38]. Since severe COVID-19 patients display reduced lymphocyte count, it is likely that

the cytokine release syndrome observed in some patients with severe or critical COVID-19 is
mediated by interferons, TNFs, and cytokines secreted by non-T cell leucocytes such as
macrophages, neutrophils and NK cells which are all key elements of innate immunity to viruses
[39].
These findings could be applied clinically to identify severe or critical COVID-19 patients. For
example, routine monitoring of NLR may provide insight into the functioning of both the innate
and adaptive immune responses and help predict the clinical course of COVID-19. Despite the
45 studies included in this review, only five reported results for NLR; all these five studies found
a significant association between increased NLR and severe or critical COVID-19 disease.
We also found that patients with severe or critical COVID-19 had significantly higher
biomarkers of tissue and organ damage such as LDH, liver enzymes, kidney function parameters
and markers of myocardial function. These observed associations could be explained by 3
mechanisms. First, the virus may cause direct organ damage by attaching to the ACE2 receptors,
which are commonly expressed in the lungs, heart, arteries, kidneys and intestines [40]. The
second, more indirect mechanism is systemic hyperinflammation caused by the cytokine release
syndrome mediated by the innate immune system [40]. Systemic hyperinflammation affects all
organs and could also explain the significantly increased expression of markers of disseminated
intravascular coagulation (high D-dimer and depleted platelet count) in severely or critically ill
patients [41, 42]. The third, also indirect, mechanism by which severe or critical COVID-19
causes multiple organ damage is hypoxia resulting from respiratory failure.
Once the mechanisms of COVID-19 induced organ damage are better understood, markers
reflecting the pathophysiological changes caused by these mechanisms may find their way into
clinical practice. Based on the results of our meta-analysis especially promising may be markers
of immune function such as NLR, IL-6, C-reactive protein, serum ferritin, lymphocytes, CD4
count, and markers of coagulation and organ damage such as D-dimer, LDH, troponin I and liver
enzymes.
The strengths and limitations of this review and meta-analysis need to be considered in the
context of rapidly evolving literature. On the one hand, our study identified some associations
that deserve further consideration and may lead to improvements in the risk stratification,
monitoring and management of COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, it is important to

emphasize that our analyses need to be viewed as hypothesis-generating rather than hypothesistesting. Due to the large number of associations examined simultaneously there is a considerable
likelihood of false-positive findings. This limitation can be addressed in future, more focused,
studies that will take into consideration prior knowledge and reduce the likelihood of falsepositive results through application of Bayesian and empirical-Bayes methods [43]. Our review
is also affected by the limitations of the underlying literature. Of those, perhaps the most
important is the cross-sectional nature of the analyses used in most publications. Although it is
plausible that markers of immune function can be used to predict disease severity, the evidence
would have been stronger if the studies were able to perform laboratory testing of COVID-19
patients before their disease severity was known. In addition, many studies from China reported
on overlapping patient populations. While we tried to exclude studies that relied on the same
data, it is possible that some of the associations examined in this meta-analysis were based on
non-independent observations.

Conclusions
Compared to non-severe COVID-19, severe or critical COVID-19 is associated with increased
markers of innate immune response such as neutrophil count, NLR, IL-6, CRP and serum
ferritin; decreased markers of adaptive immune response such as lymphocyte, CD4 and CD8
counts; and increased markers of tissue damage and major organ failure including D-dimer LDH,
Troponin I, CK-MB, AST, ALT, urea, and creatinine. Based on the results of our meta-analysis,
especially promising markers are NLR, IL-6, serum ferritin, lymphocyte and CD4 counts, Ddimer and troponin I. The clinical value of these markers should be explored further to assess
the risk of severe or critical disease and to monitor the clinical course of COVID-19.
