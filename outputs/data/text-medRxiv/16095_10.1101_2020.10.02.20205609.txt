Abstract
Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with certain
preexisting health conditions and can cause respiratory failure along with other
multi-organ injuries. However, the mechanism of these relationships is unclear, and
prognostic biomarkers for the disease and its systemic complications are lacking. This
study aims to examine the plasma protein profile of COVID-19 patients and evaluate
overlapping protein modules with biomarkers of common comorbidities.
Blood samples were collected from COVID-19 cases (n=307) and negative
controls (n=78) among patients with acute respiratory distress. Proteins were
measured by proximity extension assay utilizing next-generation sequencing
technology. Its associations to COVID-19 disease characteristics were compared to
that of preexisting conditions and established biomarkers for myocardial infarction
(MI), stroke, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and chronic kidney disease.
Several proteins were differentially expressed in COVID-19, including multiple
pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, CXCL10, and CCL7/MCP-3. Elevated
IL-6 was associated with increased severity, while baseline IL1RL1/ST2 levels were
associated with a worse prognosis. Network analysis identified several protein
modules associated with COVID-19 disease characteristics overlapping with
processes of preexisting hypertension and impaired kidney function. BNP and
NTpro-BNP, markers for MI and stroke, increased with disease progression and were
positively associated with severity. MMP12 was similarly elevated and has been
previously linked to smoking and inflammation in emphysema, along with increased
cardiovascular disease risk.
In conclusion, this study provides an overview of the systemic effects of
COVID-19 and candidate biomarkers for clinical assessment of disease progression
and the risk of systemic complications.

Introduction
The recent coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), and since its identification in late
2019, the virus has spread worldwide with over 30 million reported cases1. Clinical
presentation can range from mild flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, and
shortness of breath to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring
mechanical ventilation2-4. Disease severity and mortality rate have been associated
with certain preexisting conditions such as a history of cardiovascular disease,
hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, which corresponds with worse prognosis4-7. These
conditions often accompany older age and likely explain the higher mortality rate
observed among the elderly population4. Recent genetic studies indicate the potential
protective effect of specific blood antigens and possibly polymorphisms within the
ACE2 gene8,9, the primary cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV210.
Although clinical manifestations are mainly respiratory, early clinical reports and
extrapolation from similar coronaviruses11 (e.g., SARS-CoV1 and MERS-CoV) have
detailed the systemic effects of COVID-19, including acute cardiac injury, heart
failure, arrhythmia, gastrointestinal distress, impaired liver function, and acute kidney
injury4,7,11-13. Thromboembolic complications are common among patients with
preexisting cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases, which is likely related to the
systemic inflammation and pro-coagulatory conditions from COVID-19 infection14,15.
Early surveillance studies have also reported neurological manifestations, including
altered mental status and impaired consciousness along with fatigue, pain, and
sensory disturbances (e.g., anosmia, dysgeusia) post-recovery16,17; however, the
long-term complications of COVID-19 remain unclear.
While the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 are continually refined in
real-time, more efficient tools, particularly prognostic markers, are needed to evaluate
disease progression for targeted intervention strategies and better understand the
overlapping systemic pathology between SARS-CoV2 infection and comorbidities.
Using high-sensitivity proximity extension technology, this study examines the blood
proteome of COVID-19 patients for protein markers associated with early infection
and disease prognosis and compares with known biomarkers of common preexisting
conditions and related complications.

Methods
Adult patients (n=384) presenting with acute respiratory distress were
investigated at the Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, USA), of which 306
patients tested positive for COVID-19 while 78 remained as negative controls18. The
descriptive statistics of the cohort are provided in Table 1. Longitudinal blood
sampling was conducted for cases at 3, 7, and 28 days from baseline, if possible.
Preexisting conditions including heart (e.g., coronary artery disease, congestive heart
failure, valvular disease), lung (e.g., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
regular O2 use), and kidney (e.g., chronic kidney disease, baseline creatinine >1.5)
disease were recorded along with any history of diabetes, hypertension, and any
immunocompromising conditions. Characterization of “obese” was defined as a
body-mass index (BMI) of ≥30 kg/m2. The patient's condition was assessed using a
6-point ordinal scale (1=death; 2=intubation and mechanical ventilation; 3=
non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen; 4=hospitalized with supplementary
oxygen; 5=hospitalized without supplementary oxygen; 6=not hospitalized) based on
World Health Organization guidelines19.
Proteins were measured in plasma using a proximity extension assay (PEA), a
high-sensitivity multiplex immunoassay that utilizes paired oligonucleotide antibody
probes for protein identification followed by quantification using qPCR or
next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology20. In this study, samples were analyzed
with the NGS-based Olink Explore product consisting of four 384-plex panels of 1536
assay probes, including 48 controls and three inter-panel quality control markers (IL-6,
IL-8, and TNF)21. The relative concentration for each protein was quantified as log
base-two normalized protein expression (NPX) levels. Internal assay controls were
used to quality check each step of the assay (i.e., incubation, extension, and
amplification), and sample measures with high variability were excluded. Additional
details regarding the method have been described elsewhere20,21.
In summary, 1420 unique proteins were analyzed with the majority having a
call-rate (i.e., measurable levels above the limit of detection) above >80%
(Supplementary Table S1). Measures below 25% (x=160) were excluded, while
those between 25-80% (x=229) remained in the analysis but were interpreted with
precaution. In total, 1260 proteins passed quality control for the analysis.
Differences in protein levels between COVID-19 positive patients and negative
controls were analyzed using a multivariable linear regression model adjusting for age

and preexisting conditions (Table 1). Longitudinal changes in protein concentrations
were analyzed using a paired Student t-test. Preanalytical variation associated with
sample quality was assessed and corrected using previously defined markers of
sample handling (e.g., CD40L)22. Association with severity and prognosis was
assessed using the baseline severity score or maximum-reached severity score within
the 28 day period, respectively. Scores for severity and prognosis were dichotomized
based on the usage of mechanical ventilation or death (severe: 1-2, non-severe, 3-6;
WHO score). Significance after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was set at
P<10-5. All statistical analyses were conducted using R v.4.0.2 (Vienna, Austria).
Modules or clusters of proteins were identified by weighted correlation network
analysis (WGCNA) using a Pearson-based weighted adjacency matrix (signed, β=14)
and average linkage hierarchical clustering23. Modules were evaluated for enriched
biological processes24 and used to compare study associations with the differential
protein profiles of other diseases including myocardial infarction (MI)25-27,
cardiovascular-related death (CVD) / heart failure (HF)27, stroke27,28, hypertension29,
atherosclerosis30, diabetes31, smoking32, kidney function33, and chronic kidney disease
(CKD)33.
Results
Many proteins were differentially expressed among COVID-19 positive patients
compared to negative controls, as shown in Figure 1. Inflammatory cytokines such as
CXCL10, CXCL11, and IFN-γ increased four-fold at initial sampling but then
decreased during the follow-up period. In contrast, lower levels were detected for
CDON, ROR1, and BOC but likewise stabilized and regressed within the first week.
However, several proteins, including ITGA11, continued to decrease over time. A
delayed effect was observed with SDC1, PTN, and SFRP1, which were not associated
initially but increased gradually as the disease progressed. Similarly, levels of ACE2
increased over two folds within the first week but was not elevated at baseline (β=
-0.06, P= 0.65).
Findings were not significantly affected after correcting for sample handling,
although there was a minor improvement in the variability (Supplementary Table S2,
S3). The majority remained significant after correcting for preexisting conditions and
obesity. However, a few proteins, including IL1R2, a protein upregulated in the

adipose tissue of obese patients34, were only associated after stratification by BMI
(normal: β<0.001, P=0.99; obese β=-0.54, P=3.3x10-7; Supplementary Table S4).
Biomarkers associated with disease severity, as defined by mechanical ventilator
use, are illustrated in Figure 2 and compared to the disease-associated markers
identified in Figure 1. Overlapping markers, including EZR, NADK, and KRT19,
may be useful biomarkers for diagnosing infection and monitoring disease severity.
IL-6, which was only slightly elevated among cases (β=0.60, P=0.02), was
significantly correlated with severity. However, the majority of proteins associated
with severity were different from those associated with the disease. Measures such as
DDAH1 and NPM1 were also associated with severity among COVID-19 negative
controls indicating a lack of specificity for specific proteins.
Baseline levels of DCN, S100P, and the cardiac biomarker IL1RL1/ST2 were
associated with maximum-observed severity (i.e., death or requiring ventilation)
within the 28 days, even after correcting for baseline severity (Supplementary Table
S7). Plasma levels of S100P were lower among cases compared to controls (β=-0.48,
P=0.0004), but levels of DCN and IL1RL1 were not effected at baseline. However,
IL1RL1 was associated with baseline severity (β=0.79, P=4.7x10-8). Chemokine
CXCL10 was also correlated with baseline severity and prognosis (β=0.63, P=0.0003;
β=0.90, P=0.0006).
As most cases were over 50 years old, many have preexisting conditions such as
diabetes and hypertension (Table 1). COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to
be obese but had unexpectedly lower rates of lung disease and diabetes, although this
may be due to selection bias among controls. Association between baseline protein
levels and preexisting conditions among cases was examined in Figure 3. Leptin
(LEP), a metabolism-regulating hormone primarily secreted by adipose tissue34, was
the primary protein associated with obesity but was only slightly increased among
cases (β=0.681, P=0.0007). Cardiac biomarkers, NT-proBNP, and its active form
NPPB/BNP, were negatively associated with obesity but positively associated with
preexisting heart disease. Both were under-expressed in COVID-19 at baseline
(β<-1.19, P<2x10-7) but increased significantly during follow up (β>1.1, P<3x10-5).
BMI significantly modified baseline association for both cardiac biomarkers (normal:
β>-0.71, P>0.20; obese: β<-1.82, P<2x10-8). FGF19 was elevated in patients with
hypertension and possibly those with preexisting kidney disease (unadjusted: β=0.73,
P=2x10-5; adjusted: β=0.77, P=0.08).

To determine if specific biological processes overlap between COVID-19 disease
and related comorbidities, modules of intercorrelated proteins were identified and
used to cross-examine associations between disease characteristics, preexisting
conditions, and relevant biomarkers established in previous studies. As illustrated
in Figure 4, several identified modules correspond to over- (green) and under(turquoise/black) expressed proteins among COVID-19 patients. As previously
illustrated, these tend to be different from proteins associated with disease progression
(red/turquoise) and severity (yellow). There was a significant overlap in markers
associated with preexisting kidney disease and hypertension (turquoise), which were
responsive to COVID-19 infection and increased with disease progression. Many
have been previously established as markers of reduced kidney function, based on
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and increased risk of developing chronic
kidney disease.
NPPB and NT-proBNP (left-end turquoise) were associated with myocardial
infarction, heart failure, and ischemic stroke. Its moderately correlated protein,
MMP12, was similarly elevated in both myocardial infarction and stroke. MMP12
was also higher among smokers, being associated with inflammation in emphysema;
therefore, it may be a shared proinflammatory mediator between COVID-19 and
severity-related comorbidities. The protein module associated with disease severity
(yellow) overlapped with biomarkers for increased myocardial infarction risk such as
AGER, CTSL, PARP1, and SOD2. Many severity-related measures were also
associated with preexisting lung disease, although in the opposite direction. Proteins
of the last module (black), which includes ITGA11, continued to decrease throughout
the 28 day observation period. Considering its moderate-overlap with obesity and
diabetes, the module may be related to long-term metabolic dysfunctions.
Discussion
This study provides a broad overview of the systemic effects of COVID-19 measured
through blood, a natural sink for multiple organ systems and an easily accessible
medium for clinical investigation. Findings indicate a significant disruption in the
circulating proteome of infected patients, impacting multiple biological processes
relating to pulmonary inflammation along with cardiac injury and renal dysfunction.
These findings support the observation of multi-organ complications reported in
previous clinical studies4,7,36.

As expected, many pro-inflammatory cytokines were elevated during the early
stages of the disease and may influence overall severity, as shown in the previous
studies3,4. The hyperactive immune response against SARS-CoV2 infection, often
referred to as a cytokine storm, has been hypothesized to be a cause of disease
mortality37,38. IFN-γ-induced chemoattractant CXCL10 was one of the primary
cytokines elevated in cases and was a suggestive marker for disease severity. Previous
studies have also shown increased levels of CXCL10 along with CCL7 (MCP-3) in
COVID-19, and CXCL10 was a suggested biomarker for ARDS with protein
DDX5839,40. As IL-6 blockade has been effective for managing cytokine release
syndrome, IL-6 has also been investigated as a therapeutic target for COVID-1937.
Although not notably elevated among cases in this study, higher levels of IL6 were
associated with increased severity. Findings further support the potential benefits of
such treatment. As IL-6 is also a marker with myocardial infarction and smoking,
treatment efficacy may be modulated by active cigarette smoking or preexisting
cardiovascular disease targeting related disease complications25,27.
Several cardiac biomarkers were influenced by COVID-19, including the
hormone brain natriuretic peptide (BNP/NPPB) and its inactivated-form, N-terminal
pro–BNP (NT-proBNP). Both are known predictors of acute cardiac injury and heart
failure27,41 and have been proposed as measures for increased mortality among
COVID-19 patients42. A retrospective examination of deceased COVID-19 patients
has also shown elevated levels of circulating NT-proBNP during hospitalization4.
Therefore, BNP-related measures may be useful for monitoring cardiac stress and the
risk of thromboembolic complications, particularly among those with obese or
preexisting heart conditions. Another biomarker, IL1RL1, also known as ST2, is
associated with cardiac remodeling, and soluble ST2 has been a marker of acute
myocardial infarction43-45. Elevated levels of ST2 was associated with increased
mortality rate and may be an additional complementing marker of cardiac
complications for COVID-1946.
Other proteins may also indicate cardiac-related injury, including CDON, which
along with its coexpressed partner BOC, were lower among cases. CDON deficiency
in mice has been associated with cardiac remodeling and fibrosis through
hyperactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and may indicate an increased risk of
cardiac injury and heart failure in patients47. CDON levels were also negatively
correlated with severity and, to a lesser extent, disease prognosis. On the other hand,

MMP12, an increased measure associated of cigarette smoking, maybe a mediator of
pulmonary inflammation32,48, in COVID-19 and preexisting lung conditions, and
cardiovascular-related comorbidities.
As the primary entry receptor for SARS-CoV2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2), an essential moderator of blood pressure, has often been examined in the
relationship between COVID-19 and cardiovascular complications. Studies have
suggested that coronavirus infection can affect the expression of ACE2 pathways in
the heart and increase cardiac complication risk associated with localized
inflammation49. ACE inhibitors frequently used to manage hypertension have been
associated with increased risk of kidney injury among COVID-19 patients50.
Furthermore, increased levels of soluble ACE2, as seen among cases in this study,
may

receptor-binding activity, although this requires further clinical investigation51.
Studies have also shown ACE2 expression in kidneys, which may indicate a
direct relationship between SARS-CoV2 infection and renal complications52.
Systematic release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in ARDS may increase the risk of
acute kidney injury, while its resulting accumulation from reduced renal function may,
in turn, exacerbate ARDS53. In this study, several proteins were associated with both
COVID-19 and kidney dysfunction, and maybe possible biomarkers for monitoring
acute injury, particularly among those with hypertension.
The long-term complication of COVID-19 could not be directly assessed in this
study due to the limited follow-up time. However, previous studies have reported
lasting changes in metabolic and sensory functions, particularly among severe
cases17,35. Although levels of proteins like ILTGA11 seemed to show long-term
disruptions from disease, proper longitudinal studies will be required to investigate its
trajectory. Although we focused on circulating proteins in this study, other media such
as sputum may provide more localized measures for COVID-1948. Similarly, urine
and cerebrospinal fluid may be better for assessing renal and neurological
complications. However, blood remains the single most comprehensive source for
assessing systemic effects, and the sensitivity of proximity extension technology
allows the detection of trace proteins from multiple organ systems. Unfortunately,
previous studies have been limited to targeting specific aspects of the blood proteome,
which significantly limits the resolution for comparing overlapping biological

processes. However, the recent incorporation of NGS readout in PEA will likely
provide a more comprehensive disease proteomic profile in future studies.
In summary, this study provides an initial assessment of the overlapping
biological processes associated with COVID-19 and related comorbidities. Cardiac
biomarkers NTpro-BNP, BNP, and ST2, may be useful for monitoring and assessing
the risk of cardiac and cerebrovascular complications while specific measures of
inflammation such as CXCL10, IL6, and MMP12 may be useful for identifying
patient groups responsive to immunosuppressive treatments. However, further
investigations are required to validate the efficacy of these potential biomarkers in
clinical settings.

Frequency and proportion (%) are reported. Differences between cases and controls
were assessed using a chi-square test. WHO-based 6-point ordinal scale was used to
categorize severity of patient condition: 1=death; 2=intubation and mechanical
ventilation; 3=non-invasive ventilation or high-flow oxygen; 4=hospitalized, with
supplementary oxygen; 5, hospitalized, no supplementary oxygen; and 6, not
hospitalized. Severe condition was categorized as WHO score of ≥2.

Figure 1. Proteins associated with COVID-19 and changes in their level during
the disease course.

Differences in log base-two protein levels (NPX) between COVID-19 positive cases
(n=305) and negative controls (n=78) were analyzed using a multivariable linear
regression model adjusting for age, preexisting conditions (see Table 1), and sample
handling. The top one hundred COVID-19 associated markers are labeled in red for
all plots. Changes in protein levels at 3, 7, and 28 days compared to baseline among
cases (bottom panels) were analyzed using a paired Student t-test (n=211, 131, 40,
respectively). Levels relative to baseline are also plotted longitudinally for those
followed till day 28 (n=40) to limit potential survivorship bias.

Figure 2. Proteins associated with COVID-19 severity and 28-day prognosis.

Association between log base-two protein levels (NPX) measured at baseline and
either [A] severity at baseline or [B] prognosis within 28 days was determined using a
multivariable linear regression model adjusting for age, preexisiting conditions,
sample handling, and baseline severity (for prognosis). Both severity and prognosis
was defined as a WHO score of ≥2 (ie. Death or use of mechanical ventilation) at
baseline or within 28 days, respectively.

Figure 3. Proteins associated with preexisting conditions.

Association between log base-two protein levels (NPX) and preexisting conditions
including obesity (>30kg/m2), heart/lung/kidney disease, diabetes, hypertension, and
any immunocompromising conditions are illustrated above (left) and in comparison to
their association with COVID-19 (right; See Figure 1, baseline). Cases with
preexisting conditions were compared to those with no preexisting condition (n=89)
using a multivariable linear regression model adjusting for age and other preexisting
conditions. Details of the analysis are available in Supplementary Tables S8a-g.

Figure 4. Comparison of protein modules associated with COVID-19 and
disease-related preexisting conditions and complications.

Dendrogram and colored bars illustrate intercorrelated protein modules among
COVID-19 positive patients determined by weighted correlation network analysis
(WGCNA). Colors indicate a normalized score (-1, blue; +1, red) of the effect
estimate divided by standard error (SE) with color and intensity corresponding to the
direction and strength of the association, respectively. Scores were normalized within
each study by the 95th percentile of the absolute scores to allow inter-study
comparability and minimize outlier effects. Studies are referenced in the methods by
order. Additional details are provided in Supplementary Table S9.
