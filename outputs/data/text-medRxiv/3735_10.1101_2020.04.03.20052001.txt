Abstract
Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, is
spreading rapidly across the globe, with no proven effective therapy. Fever is seen in most
cases of COVID-19, at least at the initial stages of illness. Although fever is typically treated
(with antipyretics or directly with ice or other mechanical means), increasing data suggest that
fever is a protective adaptive response that facilitates recovery from infectious illness.
Objective: To describe a randomized controlled pilot study of core warming patients with
COVID-19 undergoing mechanical ventilation.
Methods: This prospective single-site randomized controlled pilot study will enroll 20 patients
undergoing mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Patients will be
randomized 1:1 to standard-of-care or to receive core warming via an esophageal heat
exchanger commonly utilized in critical care and surgical patients. The primary outcome is the
severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (as measured by PaO2/FiO2 ratio) at 0, 24, 48,
and 72 hours after initiation of treatment. Secondary outcomes include hospital and intensive
care unit length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, viral load, and 30-day mortality.
Results: Resulting data will provide effect size estimates to guide a definitive multi-center
randomized clinical trial. ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT04426344.

NOTE: This preprint reports new research that has not been certified by peer review and should not be used to guide clinical practice.

Conclusions: With growing data to support clinical benefits of elevated temperature in
infectious illness, this study will provide data to guide further understanding of the role of active
temperature management in COVID-19 treatment and provide effect size estimates to power
larger studies.

Introduction
Traditionally, fever has been treated because its metabolic costs were felt to outweigh its
potential physiologic benefit in an already stressed host.[1] However, increasing data suggest
that fever may be a protective adaptive response that should be allowed to run its course under
most circumstances.[2, 3] Higher early fever is associated with a lower risk of death among
patients with an ICU admission diagnosis of infection.[4, 5] Fever may enhance immune-cell
function,[6, 7] inhibit pathogen growth,[8-10] and increase the activity of antimicrobial drugs.[11]
Fever potentially benefits infected patients via multiple mechanisms; in vitro and animal studies
have shown that elevated temperatures augment immune function, increase production of
protective heat shock proteins, directly inhibit microorganism growth, reduce viral replication,
and enhance antibiotic effectiveness.[3, 12] More rapid recoveries are observed from
chickenpox,[13] malaria,[14] and rhinovirus [15] infections with avoidance of antipyretic
medication, and many innate and adaptive immunological processes are accelerated by
fever.[16-18]

Randomized controlled trials have consistently failed to find benefits to treating fever of
infectious etiology.[16, 19-24] A retrospective cohort study evaluating 1,264 patients requiring
mechanical ventilation found that high fever (≥39.5°C) was associated with increased risk for
mortality in mechanically ventilated patients; however, in patients with sepsis, moderate fever
(38.3°C-39.4°C) was protective, and antipyretic medication was not associated with changes in
outcome.[25] As recently as the 1910’s, the “malaria fever cure” (inducing fever to treat a range
of conditions, an approach known as “pyrotherapy”) was widespread, with the originator of the
idea receiving the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1927.[26, 27] Currently, the UK
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend not using antipyretic
agents “with the sole aim of reducing body temperature in children with fever.”[16, 28] Actively
inducing hyperthermia by directly heating the body has been used in cancer treatment, with
minimal adverse effects.[29-32] Hyperthermia has been found to have positive impacts on the
immune system, causing increased levels of heat-shock proteins,[33, 34] which are directly
related to antigen presentation and cross‐presentation, activation of macrophages and
lymphocytes, and activation and maturation of dendritic cells.[35] A pilot study of external
warming of septic patients (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02706275) has recently been
completed.
Many viruses replicate more robustly at cooler temperatures, such as those found in the nasal
cavity (33–35°C) than at warmer core body temperature (37°C).[36-40] Coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) and its causative virus (SARS-CoV-2) may behave similarly.[41] Simulations

of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 found high flexibility near the binding site,
suggesting that the RBD will have a high entropy penalty upon binding angiotensin-converting
enzyme II (ACE2), and that consequently, the virus may be more temperature-sensitive in terms
of human infection than other coronaviruses.[42] Notably, fever has often abated by the time a
COVID-19 patient requires mechanical ventilation.[43] The aim of this study is to determine the
effect of active core warming patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and undergoing mechanical
ventilation. We hypothesize that active core warming will reduce the severity of acute
respiratory distress syndrome, reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation, and improve
survival compared to standard of care.
Study Objectives
The purpose of the proposed pilot study is to determine if core warming improves respiratory
physiology of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19, allowing earlier weaning from
ventilation, and greater overall survival.
Primary Objective
1. Measure the impact of esophageal core warming on severity of acute respiratory
distress syndrome as measured by PaO2/FiO2 ratio 24 hours after initiation, and
compare this to standard care.
Secondary Objectives
1. Compare the duration of mechanical ventilation of patients treated with core warming to
patients treated with standard care.
2. Compare the length of ICU and hospital stay of patients treated with core warming to
patients treated with standard care.
3. Compare the viral shedding at day 7 and 14 of hospitalization between patients treated
with core warming and patients treated with standard care.
4. Compare the 30-day mortality of patients treated with esophageal core warming to
patients treated with standard care.
Methods
This is a single-center pilot study to evaluate if core warming improves respiratory physiology of
mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19, allowing earlier weaning from ventilation, and
greater overall survival. This prospective, randomized study will include 20 patients diagnosed
with COVID-19, and undergoing mechanical ventilation for the treatment of respiratory failure.
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion with 10 patients (Group A) randomized to undergo
core warming with an esophageal heat transfer device, and the other 10 patients (Group B)
serving as the control group. Patients randomized to Group A will have the esophageal heat
transfer device placed in the ICU or other clinical environment in which they are being treated
after enrollment and provision of informed consent from appropriate surrogate or legally
authorized representative.

Screening
Subjects will be recruited from the ICU or other clinical environment in which they are being
treated (Emergency Department, step-down unit, etc.). Patients will be identified by the PI or
other study investigators/coordinators as available. All patients without a DNR order with a
diagnosis of COVID-19 and meeting inclusion criteria will be eligible for screening for any
exclusion criteria. Written informed consent for the research study will be obtained from
patient’s surrogate or legally authorized representative prior to enrollment.

Study Intervention and Monitoring
Participants who have a signed research study consent form (via surrogate or legally authorized
representative) will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to core warming or to standard of care
(standard temperature management and treatment). The esophageal heat transfer device will
be used according to FDA 510(k) labeling (for patient warming). Patient temperature
measurements will be collected for both the device and standard-of-care arms during the study
period (up to 3 days). Device placement will be performed using standard protocol per
instructions for use. The esophageal heat transfer device will be set to 42°C temperature after
initial placement, and maintained at 42°C for the duration of treatment. All patients will have
usual standard of care labs, vital signs, and imaging for patients in critical condition undergoing
mechanical ventilation in the ICU. Specific parameters to be measured include PaO2 at regular
intervals appropriate for patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, and FiO2 at the time of
obtaining blood gases for PaO2 measurement, to allow calculation of P/F ratio.
Study Endpoints
The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if core warming reduces the severity of acute
respiratory distress syndrome as measured by PaO2/FiO2 ratio 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours after
initiation.

Total Number of Subjects and Sites
This single-site study aims to recruit and randomize 20 patients. It is expected that up to 30
subjects may be consented in order to produce 20 randomized & evaluable subjects.
Core temperature modulation
Core temperature control and warming will be performed with a commercially available
esophageal heat exchange device (ensoETM, Attune Medical, Chicago, IL). This device is
currently used world-wide for various patient temperature management goals, including postcardiac arrest therapeutic hypothermia, [44-47] warming of burn patients,[48] warming general
surgical patients,[49] cooling traumatic brain injury,[50] cooling heat stroke,[51] and the
treatment of central fever.[52, 53] The device is a multi-chambered silicone tube placed in the
esophagus and connected to a heat exchanger to provide heat transfer to or from a patient
(video available at https://vimeo.com/306506411). Modulation and control of the patient’s
temperature is achieved by adjusting setpoint on the external heat exchanger, which in turn
controls the circulating water temperature. Two lumens of the device connect to the external
heat exchanger, while a third central lumen provides stomach access for gastric decompression
or tube feeding. It is a single-use, disposable, non-implantable device with an intended duration
of use of 72 hours or less.
Intervention Regimen
Patients who are randomized to core warming will have the esophageal heat transfer device
placed in the ICU or other treatment area where patient is undergoing mechanical ventilation.
The device will remain in place until the study is completed (24-72 hours). The device will be set
to 42°C for the duration of the study period. It is expected that patient temperature will increase
from baseline by 1°C to 2°C, but due to ongoing heat loss from the patient, the expected
maximum patient temperature is below 39°C. The time course of illness of COVID-19 is such
that most patients no longer have fever by the time of mechanical ventilation.[41] If patient
temperature increases above this range and reaches 40°C, the device will be set to an
operating temperature of 40°C, thereby preventing any further increase in patient temperature.
Patient temperature will be followed at intervals per standard of care in the intensive-care
setting for mechanically ventilated patients (typically hourly).
Blinding
Due to the nature of this study, the physicians will not be blinded to the randomization
assignment, however participants will be blinded. Once a subject is randomized, the research
team will receive the randomization assignment (core warming or standard of care) and proceed
with the procedures per the assignment.

Statistical Plan
Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint of this study will be the change in PaO2/FiO2 ratio 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours
after implementation of core warming of ventilated patients. This endpoint will be compared
between patients receiving core warming and those randomized to undergo standard care
(standard temperature management, typically with antipyretics as needed).
Secondary Endpoints
Secondary endpoints include:
1.
2.
3.

Duration of mechanical ventilation
Duration of ICU and hospital stay
Amount of viral shedding
Patient mortality

Sample Size and Power Determination
Based on a prior study in patients with sepsis, a maximum temperature of 38.3°C to 39.4°C was
associated with survival (aHR 0.61 [95% CI, 0.39-0.99]).[29] However, the effect of warming
specific to COVID-19 patients remains uncertain, and as such, we are unable to accurately
perform a power calculation for this pilot study. We believe that a total of 10 patients for each
group will be required to yield the necessary pilot data to make an appropriate conclusion
regarding the potential utility of core warming in improving pulmonary physiology, reducing
mechanical ventilation duration, and increasing patient survival. It is anticipated that data from
this pilot study can be used for planning future larger studies.

Statistical Methods
We will utilize standard measures to report outcomes and measure differences between groups.
Specifically, we will use descriptive statistics, including mean (standard deviation) and median
(interquartile range). Normality will be assessed using histograms and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov
test. Categorical variables will be compared using the chi-squared test or Fisher exact test.
Continuous variables will be compared using the independent samples t or Mann–Whitney U
test.
Efficacy Analysis
This is a pilot study to determine the potential role of core warming during COVID-19 treatment.

Interim Safety Analysis
All subjects entered into the study and randomized at the baseline timepoint will have detailed
information collected on adverse events for the overall study safety analysis. An interim safety
analysis will be performed after the first 10 subjects are enrolled in the trial. At this time the
safety and tolerability of the study device will be assessed and if deemed safe and appropriate,
enrollment will continue to 20 subjects.
Subject Population for Analysis
All patients enrolled, randomized to a study arm, and completed in the study will be included for
analysis.
Conclusion
We describe, before the initiation of any data collection, our approach to obtaining and
analyzing data from a pilot randomized-controlled trial of core warming patients undergoing
mechanical ventilation due to COVID-19. We anticipate this framework will enhance the utility
of the reported results and provide a solid basis from which to design and execute subsequent
investigations.
