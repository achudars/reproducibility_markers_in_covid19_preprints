Summary
Background
During the Covid19 pandemic, school closure has been mandated in analogy to its known
effect against influenza, but it is unclear whether schools are early amplifiers of Covid19
cases.

Methods
We performed a cross-sectional and prospective cohort study in Italy. We used databases
from the Italian Ministry of Education containing the number of new positive SARS-CoV-2
cases per school from September 20 to November 8, 2020 to calculate incidence among
students and staff. We calculated incidence across each age group using databases from
the Veneto Region system of SARS-CoV-2 cases notification in the period August 26November 24, 2020. We used a database from the Veneto Region system of SARS-CoV-2
secondary cases tracing in Verona province schools to estimate number of tests, the
frequency of secondary infections at school by type of index case and the ratio positive
cases/ number of tests per school institute using an adjusted multivariable generalized linear
regression model. We estimated the reproduction number Rt at the regional level from the
Italian Civil Protection of regional SARS-CoV-2 cases notification database in the period 6
August-2 December 2020.

Findings
From September 12 to November 7 2020, SARS-CoV-2 incidence among students was
lower than that in the general population of all but two Italian regions. Secondary infections
were <1%, and clusters of >2 secondary cases per school were 5-7% in a representative
November week. Incidence among teachers was greater than in the general population.
However, when compared with incidence among similar age groups, the difference was not
significant (P=0.23). Secondary infections among teachers were more frequent when the
index case was a teacher than a student (38% vs. 11%, P=0.007). From August 28 to
October 25 in Veneto where school reopened on September 14, the growth of SARS-CoV2 incidence was lower in school age individuals, maximal in 20-29 and 45-49 years old
individuals. The delay between the different school opening dates in the different Italian

regions and the increase in the regional Covid19 reproduction number Rt was not uniform.
Reciprocally, school closures in two regions where they were implemented before other
measures did not affect the rate of Rt decline.

Interpretation
Our analysis does not support a role for school opening as a driver of the second wave of
SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in Italy, a large European country with high SARS-CoV-2 incidence.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
The role of schools and at large of children as amplifiers of the Covid19 pandemics is
debated. Despite biological and epidemiological evidence that children play a marginal role
in Sars-CoV-2 spread, policies of school closures have been predicated, mostly based on
the temporal coincidence between school reopening in certain countries and Covid19
outbreaks. Whether schools contributed to the so called “second wave” of Covid19 is
uncertain. Italy’s regionalized calendar of school reopening and databases of positivity at
school allows to estimate the impact of schools on the increase of Sars-CoV-2 that occurred
in autumn 2020.
Added value of this study
We found that incidence among students is lower than in the general population and that
whereas incidence among teachers appears higher than that in the general population, it is
comparable to that among individuals of the same age bracket. Moreover, secondary
infections at school are rare and clusters even less common. The index case of a secondary
teacher case is more frequently a teacher than a student. In Veneto, during the first phase
of the second wave incidence among school age individuals was low as opposed to the
sustained incidence among individuals of 45-49 years. Finally, the time lag between school
opening and Rt increase was not uniform across different Italian regions with different school
opening dates, with lag times shorter in regions where schools opened later.
Implications of the available evidence
These findings contribute to indicate that Covid19 infections rarely occur at school and that
transmission from students to teachers is very rare. Moreover, they fail to support a role for
school age individuals and school openings as a driver of the Covid19 second wave. Overall,

Introduction
School closures represent a widespread nonpharmacological intervention (NPI) in the
context of the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid19) pandemic. In Italy, schools have
been closed for more than half of the 2019-2020 school year and during the second Covid19
wave high schools have been closed again, with students switching to “integrated digital
learning” nationwide since November 6, 2020. The rationale for such a NPI has mostly been
drawn from the reported beneficial effect of school closure during influenza pandemics 1,
even if the debate was still open 2. However, while children’s immune system is naïve to
influenza antigens, making them a known reservoir of influenza infection, they do not appear
as affected by Covid19 as adults, representing a small fraction of documented Covid19
cases. Similarly to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 affects less children, where
symptoms are fewer, disease less severe and case-fatality rates much lower 3,45.
Several biological factors might contribute to the reduced Covid19 risk of children: first,
children express significantly fewer ACE2 receptors – the entry point of SARS-CoV-2 into
human cells – compared to adults 6; second, they are commonly exposed to other seasonal
coronaviruses and develop both humoral and cellular cross-immunity 7. Children appear
therefore less susceptible to the infection, and when infected have a preformed arsenal of
neutralizing cross reactive antibodies that might reduce the likelihood of transmitting the
virus. This biological evidence is mirrored in several epidemiological studies. A metaanalysis of 32 studies from different countries suggests that children have a lower
susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with adults

8

. An age-structured

mathematical model applied to epidemic data from China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Canada
and South Korea estimates that individuals younger than 20 years of age display half the
chance of being infected than adults 9. In the context of households (the most common route
of secondary infection) chances of transmission from children to adults are low and the

spread seldom starts from children. In a large study including 15,771 children aged 1 to 18
years living in Germany, almost two-thirds of children living with virus-positive family
members were negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and virus tests, suggesting that
transmission to children is infrequent

10

. In only three families (9.7%) among 31 household

transmission cases that involved children in China, Singapore, USA, Vietnam, and South
Korea the child represented the index case

11

. In a meta-analysis of all contact-tracing

studies up to 16th May 2020, children are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than adults, with
56% lower odds of being an infected contact [Pooled OR=0.44 (95%CI 0.29, 0.69)] 8. In the
Italian town of Vo’ Euganeo, where 70% of the population was screened and 2.6% of the
population resulted positive, no child below 10 years of age was found positive, even if these
12

children lived in the same household with a positive individual

. In a large cohort study on

12 million people in the UK, the risk of infecting and becoming infected with SARS-COV-2
grew with age. In the same study, risk of contracting the virus was not higher than that of
the rest of the population for >9 million adults younger than 65 living with children up to 11
years of age. The risk increased slightly for those who lived with adolescents aged 12 to 18,
but this risk did not correspond to a greater lethality in case of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Indeed, there was no significant effect of the school closure on the trend of the epidemic in
the families analyzed compared to the rest of the population

13

.

Despite evidence supporting a marginal role for children in Covid19 pandemic, school
openings (or re-openings) have been considered an issue. This notion has been based on
modeling studies and systematic reviews showing conflicting results on whether school
closures were efficacious in curtailing the general incidence of infection

14,15

adolescents were reported to be just as likely as adults to spread the virus

. Moreover,

study levels of Sars-CoV-2 genetic material in the upper respiratory tract of children below
5 years with mild to moderate Covid19 was more than in children 6-17 and adults

Furthermore, in a Covid19 outbreak at a summer camp in Georgia, children of all ages were
found to be highly susceptible to infection: 51% of the campers ages 6 to 10 tested positive,
as did 44% of those ages 11 to 17 18. In Israel, schools fully reopened on May 17, 2020 and
ten days later, a major outbreak of coronavirus disease (Covid19) occurred in a high school;
temporal correlation between school openings and the second wave was interpreted as a
causal link

19

. By extension, policymakers (as well as the lay public) attribute to school

openings a key role in amplifying infection rates in the general population. This opinion is
particularly widespread in Italy, where schools remained closed from February 25 in
Northern Italian regions (from March 9 nationwide) until September, when they reopened in
different days across different regions. Despite the implementation of a very strict infection
risk mitigation protocol, school openings have been regarded as a key factor in the
amplification of the second Covid19 wave and their closure has been predicated by several
data analysts. Consequently, high schools nationwide and, in certain regions, the second
and third year of middle schools (the Italian middle school curriculum lasts 3 years) have
been closed since November 6. In other regions (Campania and Apulia), closure of all
schools including elementary and kindergarten has been mandated since October 16 and
30, respectively. In Lombardy, high schools have been closed since October 26. However,
whether school openings played a crucial role in the second wave of Covid19 infections
remains to be ascertained. Italy was in a privileged position to investigate this possibility:
school calendars are regional and starting dates differ among different regions by up to 17
days.
The aims of this study were to investigate the overall incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection
among students and teachers, as well as whether there was an association between the
increase in transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 (measured as reproduction number Rt) and
dates of school openings in different Italian Regions. We also estimated the incidence of

SARS-CoV-2 by age in Veneto and the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positive students,
teachers, and other staff in public and private schools in two weeks between the end of
November and beginning of December in the Italian regions. We calculated the rate of
secondary infections per number of tests and frequency of clusters identified during contact
tracing activity in a large sample of Italian Schools. We also estimated the frequency of
secondary infections in teachers by type of index case (student, teacher or staff).

Methods
Study design
This was a cross-sectional and prospective cohort study. Data collected within the
comprehensive, national reporting system put in place by the Italian Ministry of Education
(Ministero dell’Istruzione - MI) to gather information from school Principals every week for
each comprehensive private and state institute. All institutes are required to inform the
Department of Prevention of the local unit (AULSS) of the National Health System
responsible for tracing and the MI when they suspect or identify a case or outbreak of
Covid19. AULSS then perform a risk assessment and decide on any additional investigation
and infection control measure, based on factors such as the number of new positive
subjects, disease severity, and potential transmission at school. AULSS record each event
within each region in an online national database of public health management. MI and
AULSS have legal permission to process patient confidential information for national
surveillance of communicable diseases.
For outbreaks, direction of transmission from the index case to secondary cases was
inferred based on the date of symptom onset for symptomatic individuals and date of testing
for asymptomatic individuals. We evaluated associations between event measures in
educational settings, regional Covid19 incidence, and other regional characteristics to
identify possible predictors for cases and outbreaks.
We used a database with data collected by MI containing the number of new positive SARSCoV-2 cases per school from September 20 to November 8, 2020. This database reports
the incidence in the first cycle (kindergarten, elementary and middle school) and second
cycle (high school) by region. Data was retrieved from 7,976 public school institutes (97%
of total), accounting for 7,376,698 students, 775,451 teachers and 206,120 staff members.

We also analyzed data of SARS-CoV-2 incidence in schools in the period 23-28 November,
2020 in a sample of 6,827 public institutes (81.6% of the total) and 7,035 private institutes
(55.6% of the total institutes). Furthermore, we analyzed data collected by MI from contact
tracing in the monitored schools (from 23 November to 5 December 2020). Information were
retrieved from 5.971 (45%) institutes in the first week, and 7,035 (55.6%) institutes in the
second week (public and private institutes), accounting for 423.516 and 496,289 students in
the first and second week, respectively.
We calculated regional Covid19 incidence using national SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR data
collated by AULSS for Covid19 surveillance, and regional population estimates from the
Office for National Statistics (Istituto Nazionale di Statistica, ISTAT).
SARS-CoV-2 positive incidence rates were calculated for staff and students attending an
educational setting, irrespective of whether the infection was acquired within or outside the
educational setting. attendance denominators for educational settings were obtained from
the MI open database (https://dati.istruzione.it/opendata/). For event rate and incidence
rates calculations, denominators were drawn from MI enrollment figures.

Statistical methods
Mean, median values, inter-quartile ranges, standard deviations and box-plots for
continuous variables and absolute and relative frequencies for categorical variables are
presented. Differences among groups for continuous variables were tested by means of the
non-parametric Wilcoxon-rank sum test and differences for categorical variables were tested
by means of the Chi-square test.
Incidence rates of secondary infections were defined as number of cases/number of tests
occurring the same week after a SARS-COV-2 positive student or teacher was found.

LSmeans, 95%CI and P-values of rate of secondary infections and number of positive test
per institute and week are estimated with multivariable generalized linear regression model
adjusted for week of test and density of the region, weighted for the number of tests released
in each institute to trace close contacts. Square root transformations were carried out to
achieve normality of residuals of full models.
Incidence rates were calculated as the sum of all new positives in each week, divided by the
size of the population. We work out the cases per 10,000 (a standard epidemiological way
of presenting incidence) by dividing the number of cases by the population in each age group
(estimates are from ISTAT, 2018).
To generate the incidence heatmap, a matrix of the weekly incidence referred to individual
age ranges was calculated. Using Excel, individual cells were color coded in a 3 color scale
(green-beige-red) of increasing weekly incidence rate. To generate the heatmap of distance
between age brackets, the same matrix was fed to the Heatmapper algorithm
(www.heatmapper.ca) and we selected to calculate the distance between rows and columns
using the Euclidean Distance Measurement Method.
Transmissibility was measured by the reproduction number R t, as the average number of
secondary cases caused by an infected individual. We estimated Rt over the months
incorporating uncertainty in the distribution of the serial interval (the time between the onset
of symptoms in a primary case and the onset of symptoms in secondary cases)20. Rt was
computed using EpiEstim 20 with parameters from the first wave in Italy as defined by Merler
and coworkers

21

(serial interval: 6.6, gamma: 4.9). Rt was computed using the number of

new cases/day in each region (physician referral and screening due to local campaigns and
to contact tracing). Data were retrieved from the database of the Italian Civil Protection
(https://github.com/pcm-dpc/Covid19). In all graphs, Rt values are reported as median
values for a 7-day posterior moment with 95% credible intervals. When an NPI was

introduced and school opening occurred, their effect on Rt was referred to the first day of
the corresponding 7-day moment. For example, if schools opened on September 14, their
effect on Rt was introduced from the period September 14-20.
Since previous analyses suffer of ecological bias, we also performed a prospective study on
datasets extracted from the Veneto Region system of SARS-CoV-2 cases notification. We
stratified incidence of newly reported Covid19 cases for age from late August to late October
2020, when overall Covid19 incidence in Veneto increased from ~2/10,000 to ~35/10,000.
We first divided the population into infants (0-4 years of age), students (5-19), young adults
(20-34), adults (35-59), seniors (60-74) and elderly (75+) and calculated daily incidence of
newly reported cases in these age categories. We also extracted information regarding
secondary infections among teachers in 339 schools in Verona and province from November
25 to December 21, by type of index case. Statistical analyses were performed with
Statistical Analysis System Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) or with OriginPro
2021 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA).

Role of the funding source
The Italian Ministry of Health with Ricerca Corrente and 5x1000 funds (to SG) did not support
study design, data collection, data analysis, interpretation, and writing of the report.

Results
School demographics and the 2020-21 school year in Italy
According to the National Statistical Institute (ISTAT), 9,150,518 students attended the
different school cycles in 2019 in Italy. These cycles include kindergarten (scuola
dell'infanzia, attended by 3-5 years old children), elementary (scuola primaria attended by
6-10 years old children), middle (scuola secondaria di primo grado attended by 11-13 years
old children) and high school (scuola secondaria di secondo grado attended by 14-18 years
old children). Education is compulsory from 6 to 16 years of age. Pre-elementary school
education that includes kindergarten as well as nurseries (asili nido, attended by children 02 years old) is not compulsory. On average, students represented 15% of the population of
each of the 20 Italian regions and two autonomous Provinces (range: 10.7%-19%; Table 1).
While kindergartens and nurseries started nationwide on September 1st, the calendarized
opening day of all other schools differed among regions. In most regions, schools started on
September 14; in a second group of regions schools opened on September 24; in two other
regions on September 16 or 22 (Table 2). The Italian Government mandated a protocol to
minimize risk of Covid19 diffusion that followed most of the strictest recommendations

22

.

Measures included temperature control and hand hygiene at the school entrance;
unidirectional flows of students; mask mandate for all personnel and students in common
areas and for high school students also when seated at their desks (and always for teachers,
combined with face-shields in certain settings), compulsory 1m seat to seat distance,
frequent classroom natural ventilation, ban on school sports and music, reduced duration of
school hours and reduced school duration. Moreover, Covid19 positive staff members must
promptly inform the school Principal. Similarly, parents must promptly report any case of
Covid19 positivity in their children to the schools and Principals must coordinate with local
units of the National Health System to perform secondary screenings among staff/students,

or to mandate quarantine for 10 days with a swab to all quarantined students/personnel
before re-admitting them to the school premises. Notwithstanding these rules, school
opening has been accounted as the driver of the second Covid19 wave by the popular press
as well as by opinion makers, calling for a careful analysis of Covid19 diffusion and contact
tracing among children in schools, as well as of the association between dates of school
openings and qualitative changes in the Rt trend direction (1st derivative of Rt), a widely
accepted proxy of epidemic driver.

Incidence of Covid19 among students is lower than in the general population.
To first gain insight into the diffusion of Covid19 in Italian Schools, we analyzed a database
from the Italian Ministry of Education (MI). We used this database to calculate the incidence
of new positives in the period and per week among students, teachers, and non-teaching
staff members of elementary, middle and high schools. We compared these data to the
incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the general population for each region. The incidence
of positives among students was lower than that in the population (overall incidence:
108/10,000), irrespective of whether we analyzed elementary and middle schools
(incidence: 66/10,000), or high schools (incidence: 98/10,000). Incidence of new positives
among elementary and middle school students was on average 38.9% lower than in the
general population in all Italian regions but Lazio (Figure 1A). In the case of high schools,
incidence of new positives among the students was 9% lower to that of the general
population (Figure 1B). In the three regions of Lazio, Marche, and Emilia-Romagna, it was
higher than in the general population. Among teachers and non-teaching staff incidence was
2-fold higher than that observed in the general population (approx. 220/10,000, Figure 1C).
These data indicate that students are largely protected from SARS-CoV-2 infection,
irrespective of their school cycle. Conversely, infection appears to be more widespread

among teachers and staff members of schools than in the general population. It shall be
noted that while teachers share classrooms for several hours with students, staff members
include administrative personnel and janitors who seldom interact with students.
We next used a second database in which the MI collected the number of new cases in the
period 23-28 November in a sample of 6,827 public (81.6% of the total) and 7,035 private
institutes (55.6% of the total). This database offers a snapshot of the distribution of new
cases in a limited timeframe during the peak of the second Covid19 wave. New positive
subjects were found mostly among teachers and staff members: SARS-CoV-2 positives
were 0.32% of students, 1.52% of teachers and 1.96% of staff members (Table 3, Figure
S1). The highest rate was found in Molise and the lowest in Calabria. Incidences of new
cases in kindergarten were 0.21% in pupils and 2.35% among teachers (P<0.001), in
elementary schools were 0.35% among children and 1.83% among teachers (P<0.001). In
middle schools, 0.45% students and 1.60% teachers were found positive (P<0.001, Table 4
and 5). Similar incidence rates were found in private schools (Table S3-S4), except for a
slightly lower rate among staff members (1.67%, Table S1). This database allowed us also
to investigate how often the communication of a positive case elicited quarantine for
students/staff members. A quarantine period was requested for 1.92% of students, 2.30%
of teachers and 2.56% of staff members of the analyzed public schools (Table 6). In private
schools, rates of quarantines were very similar, except for a slightly higher rate for children
(2.65%, Table S4). These data indicate that even during the peak of the second Covid19
wave, students were less infected than adults in school establishments, and that overall, the
quarantine system was widespread, vis-à-vis a very low rate of positivity among students.
Finally, to compare the degree of infection transmission from students and teachers to their
close contacts, we analyzed data collected by the MI from contact tracing in the monitored
schools (from November 23 to December 5, 2020). Information was retrieved from 5,971

(45%) institutes in the first week and 7,035 (55.6%) institutes in the second week (public
and private kindergarten, elementary and middle schools), accounting for 423,516 and
496,289 students in the first and second week, respectively. The Least Square estimates of
the incidence of secondary cases over the number of tests carried out on close contacts of
a positive subjects in school was less than 1% per school and week for teachers and
students, in kindergarten, elementary and middle schools. Estimates of rates when the index
case was a student, or a teacher were not statistically different (Table 7). The number of
tests per institute per week ranged from an average of 7 in kindergarten to 18 in middle
schools (Table 8). Figure 2 shows the box-plot of the numbers of test per school when a
student is the index case and when the index case is a teacher. Twenty-seven schools
carried out more than 100 tests in a week. Clusters, defined as >2 SARS-CoV-2 positive
subjects identified in one week following contact tracing of index cases, were found in 5%
to 7% of schools (Figure S2). On average, 49%-56% of all close contacts of a positive
student or teacher were placed in quarantine for 10 days, with the need of a negative swab
at the end of the period to be readmitted at school. These striking data corroborate the
notion that elementary and middle school students not only are less infected, but also that
the risk of infection at schools is low. Moreover, they indicate that contact tracing results in
a high number of swabs per contacts, especially when the index case is a student, more
than the average of tests for contact tracing in the general population. Altogether, our
analysis of the data collected by the MI indicates that in Italy students are less infected than
the general population and the overall protocols for contact tracing work, questioning
whether schools played a role as amplifiers of the second Covid19 wave.

We reasoned that if school openings had played a role in the second wave of Covid19 in
Italy, the reproduction number Rt shall have increased earlier in the regions where schools
started earlier. We first tested this hypothesis by analyzing the case of the two provinces of
Bolzano, where schools started on September 7, and Trento, where they started on
September 14 (Table 2). Given the similarities between these two alpine territories in terms
of orography, population density (72 inhabitants/km² in Bolzano; 87 in Trento), climate and
lifestyle, they represent a very useful case scenario to investigate the role of schools in the
local spread of Covid19. We computed Rt 21 on the incidence of the positives at a RT-PCR
for Sars-CoV-2 genetic material test from an oro/nasopharyngeal swab (data retrieved on
Dec. 3, 2020 from the repository of the Italian Civil Protection Department
https://github.com/pcm-dpc/Covid19). Notwithstanding that schools in Trento opened 7 days
later than in Bolzano, the increase in Rt (defined as an increase sustained for >3 moments
and leading to Rt >1) occurred from the period 23/9-30/9, whereas in Bolzano Rt started to
increase from the period 29/9-6/10, suggesting that there was no temporal relation between
schools opening and surge in Rt (Figure 3A).
We extended our analyses to different pairs of Regions where schools opened on different
days. We compared the temporal distribution of Rt in Abruzzo and Marche, two bordering
regions of central-eastern Italy. In Marche, schools opened on September 14, in Abruzzo on
September 24. In both regions, Rt started to increase from the 25/9-2/10 period (Figure 3B).
We repeated the same exercise for the pair Sicily-Calabria, where schools started on
September 14 and 24, respectively. Again, we found no difference in the period when Rt
started to increase (Figure 3C). Finally, even in the case of the pair Veneto-Apulia where
schools opened on September 14 and 24 respectively, we did not appreciate any difference
in the period when Rt started to increase (Figure 3D). Altogether, these data indicate that
the increase in SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number in different Italian regions occurred

indeed after school openings, but that at the same time the delay between school opening
and Rt rise was not constant as it would be expected if it were the only driver of Covid19
diffusion. This lag time appeared indeed shorter in regions where schools opened on
September 24, longer in those regions where schools opened on September 14. We further
corroborated this impression by calculating the number of days from the date of the school
opening to the Rt across all Italian regions increase (Figure S3). The average delay from
school opening to Rt increase was 5.7 days (CI75%: 3.75-7.5) in regions where schools
opened on September 22 or 24, 12.4 days (CI75%: 10-16) in regions where schools opened
on September 14 or 16 (Figure 4A, P<0.05 in a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). Conversely, the
average delay between the Rt rise and the national election day held on September 21 was
comparable in all regions: the mean was 8.7 (CI75%: 7-9) in regions where schools opened
on September 22/24 and 5.2 (CI75%: 3-9) in regions where schools opened on September
7 or 14/16 (Figure 4B). In conclusion, we did not find an unequivocal delay between school
opening and Rt rise.

Early increase in Covid19 incidence among adults, not school age individuals during
the second wave in the Veneto region.
Because we did not find a strong temporal relation between school openings and the second
Covid19 wave in Italy, we decided to understand whether SARS-CoV-2 positivity circulated
early in individuals different than children. To this end, we performed a prospective study on
datasets extracted from the Veneto Region system of SARS-CoV-2 cases notification. We
stratified incidence of newly reported Covid19 cases for age from late August to late October
2020, when overall Covid19 incidence in Veneto increased from ~2/10,000 to ~35/10,000.
We first divided the population into infants (0-4 years of age), students (5-19), young adults
(20-34), adults (35-59), seniors (60-74) and elderly (75+) and calculated daily incidence of
19

newly reported cases in these age categories. Demographic details are reported in Table 1.
Interestingly, incidence in young adults and adults increased at the end of August and then
again at the end of September, whereas it remained very close to baseline in all the other
age groups in these two periods (Figure 5A). This result prompted us to increase the
granularity of our analysis. We stratified incidence for the classic demographic brackets (we
used one single group of 75+ years old individuals as we did not find differences in incidence
in groups above age 75). In late August-early September incidence increased among 45 to
49-year-old individuals and albeit less also among the 25 to 39-year-old ones. Conversely,
incidence remained very low in the other analyzed age groups. Incidence increased again
in the last decade of September in the age groups 45-49 and to a lower extent in the age
groups 20-24 and 25-29 (Figure 5B). These data were surprising, as they suggested that at
least in Veneto the earliest increase in SARS-CoV-2 positivity occurred in adults, followed
by younger individuals, but not in adolescents that were often deemed as potential
spreaders because of their high number of social contacts and their presumed laxity in
adhering to the infection risk mitigation protocols. We therefore further inspected the
temporal distribution of incidence among age classes. We generated a heatmap of the
incidence of Covid19 cases in every age group in the 8 weeks under consideration, where
low incidence is in green, intermediate incidence values in beige, high incidence in red.
Visual inspection of this heatmap confirmed that the earliest increase in incidence occurs
not among children or adolescents, but among individuals 20-49 years of age. These
individuals appeared to be the drivers of the second wave, as incidence then propagated to
individuals of other age categories (Figure 5C). Indeed, by applying a Euclidean distance
algorithm to the same matrix used to generate the heatmap, we found that children and
adolescents are ranked as the groups closest to the least affected groups by this second
Covid19 wave (60-64 and 65-69 years of age). Conversely, individuals 20 to 29, and 45 to
49 years old are the most distant from the protected 60-69 years old individuals (Figure S4).

Finally, we compared the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 from September 19 to the October 18
among teachers and among the general population of the age group 25-65 in Veneto. We
selected this age group because teachers’ age is comprised between these two extremes,
given the required tertiary education to be enrolled, and the legal retirement age of teachers.
Interestingly, incidence among teachers starts to increase after the general population of the
same age; moreover, at the end of the period under consideration, incidence among
teachers and among the general population aged 25-65 is not significantly different
(12/10,000 vs. 11.1/10,000, P=0.36, Figure S5). We also investigated the frequency of
secondary infections at schools in Verona and province from November 25 to December 21
on datasets extracted from the Veneto Region system of SARS-CoV-2 cases notification.
We found 380 student, 30 staff and 114 teachers index cases in 339 schools for which
contact tracing was performed. From this contact tracing and testing, a total of 76 secondary
cases were identified (Table 9). The frequency of secondary cases was higher among
students than among teachers and staff (71%, 22.4% and 6.6%, respectively). A secondary
case among teachers was more frequent when the index case was a teacher than when it
was a student (38% vs. 11%, P=0.007). Secondary cases among staff members were
exclusively due to contacts with other staff members.
Altogether, these analyses indicate that in the Italian Veneto region, children and
adolescents were not early drivers of the second wave, which was conversely associated
with an early increase in incidence among 20-29- and 45-49-years old individuals.
Furthermore, teachers were not at greater risk than the age matched general population and
when teachers were infected at school, infections were due mainly to other teachers.

School closures did not alter the rate of Rt decline in Lombardy and Campania

Because we did not find a correlation between school opening and the rise in R t, we wished
to understand whether the opposite, i.e., school closures, impacted on Rt. Again, the
territorial differences in the mandate of different NPI in Italy offers a useful paradigm to
investigate this possibility. We considered here the two cases of Lombardy, where the
Governor mandated closure of high schools from October 26; and Campania, where the
Governor mandated the closure of all school grades (including kindergartens) from October
16. Lombardy and Campania together account for 25% of Italy's population, being the first
and second most populous regions. These school closures occurred before the national
Government implemented a regional risk stratification system to modulate lockdown
according to the local epidemiological and hospital stress status (November 6), but after the
mandate for universal mask wearing outside of home (October 14) and in the case of
Lombardia after the closure of restaurants, cafes, and bars at 6PM with a nationwide curfew
at 10PM (October 23). Because of the stability (i.e., lack of recalculations) of the data
communicated by these two regions, we could compute Rt on the positives at a RT-PCR for
Sars-CoV-2 in swabs prescribed by a physician (sospetto diagnostico, i.e. clinical
indication). Interestingly, Rt decline started well before high school closures in both regions:
in Lombardy in the October 8-15 period (Figure 6A for absolute Rt values and 5B for its first
order derivative); in Campania, in the September 30-October 7 period (Figure 6C for
absolute Rt values and 5D for its first order derivative). Noteworthy, the same pattern was
observed if we analyzed Rt computed over total Sars-CoV-2 positivity, albeit in the case of
Campania Rt decline started only three moments before the implementation of school
closures (Fig. S3, red lines in the plots of Campania and Lombardy). In the case of
Campania, we could also extend our analysis to the overall incidence among students and
general population. We found that while incidence dropped among students, because they
were no longer attending schools and therefore tested, the overall incidence in the general
population continued to increase (Figure S6), reflecting the fact that Rt remained >1 until the

5-11 November period. Altogether, these data indicate that school closures did not impact
on the speed of Rt decline in Lombardy and Campania. Furthermore, the increasing trend
of Covid19 incidence in the general population observed in Campania was not curtailed by
school closures.

Discussion
Whether school reopening contributed to the second wave of Covid19 in Italy was unclear.
Here, by analyzing data from Italian regions and schools, we did not find a significant
association between school opening and rise of infection in the general population. Our
conclusion is based (i) on the finding of lower incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity among
students than in the general population; (ii) on the lack of association between staggered
school reopening in different Italian regions and direction change in reproduction number Rt;
and (iii) on the analysis of the temporal changes in the incidence among different age
classes in the Veneto region between late August and late October 2020.
At variance with influenza, where younger individuals seem to represent a reservoir of virus
and contribute to its propagation to the general population 23-27 SARS-CoV-2 seems to spare
school age children and adolescents: clinically, they are mostly paucisymptomatic 5; from
the epidemiology of infection perspective, they are very rarely accounted for as the index
case

11

, indicating that not only they are largely spared from the clinical consequences of

the infection, but they are also less likely to transmit it. Overall, these data suggest that
spread of Covid19 within school settings may be limited

28,29

. Indeed, our data indicate that

infection incidence is lower in students of any cycles, compared to the general population.
Moreover, at least in the case of elementary school children, contact tracing in schools
confirms that they are less likely to transmit the virus, as evidenced by a 27% reduction in
the number of secondary cases among teachers when the index case is a student (10%)
compared to the number of secondary cases elicited when the index case is a student (37%).
These epidemiological data are in line with the finding that children harbor antibodies against
the common other betacoronaviruses, and that these antibodies are cross reactive and
neutralizing against SARS-CoV-2 7. Our findings are also consistent with several other
reports of very limited spread of Covid19 between children and from children to adults. In

Australia (New South Wales), following Covid19 positivity of 9 students in primary and high
schools and 9 staff members, only 2 of the 735 students, and 0 of the 128 staff members
with whom they had contact were identified as secondary cases. In Ireland, during the first
wave, 6 Covid19 cases were identified in schools (three children and three adults). Among
their 1,155 school contacts, zero infections were recorded

30

. In the Netherlands, ten

Covid19 cases aged <18 had 43 contacts, but nobody was infected, whereas 221 patients
older than 18 were associated with 8.3% of infections

31

.

We found higher rates of incidence in teachers and school staff compared to the general
population. One possible explanation for this finding is that school environments are
meticulously and continuously controlled, confirmed by the number of tests performed for
each positive case. Indeed, in Campania where schools were open for a mere 17 school
days (from September 24 to October 16; school week of 5 days), incidence among teachers
and school staff in the September 12-November 7 period is still higher than that in the
general population. It would be difficult to ascribe this difference to 17 days of school over a
total of 56 days. It cannot be argued that teachers and staff members are more susceptible
to infection than the general population; in fact, this increase in the incidence of test positives
is not mirrored by an increase in mortality-morbidity that would mark a more susceptible
population

32

. Another possibility is that teachers become infected at school. Judging from

contact tracing activity in schools of the populous province of Verona (Veneto), this
occurrence is however quite rare: only 13 teachers were accounted for as secondary cases
from 524 traced index cases.
Decision makers, popular press and public opinion in Italy ascribe the second wave of
Covid19 to school reopening. This is often accompanied by deprecating comments on
“individual behavior” of adolescents especially, who would not follow the strict rules at school
or outside them. However, our data suggest that this common sentiment is not evidence25

based, but perhaps grounded on the temporal correlation between school opening (in
September) and second wave (in October-November). Indeed, our data do not identify an
association between school reopening and rise in Rt analyzed on a regional basis. Because
of the staggered school reopening calendar in Italy, we were well positioned to address
whether there was an association between the date of school opening and the date of
reproduction number increase. We did not find such association that was conversely present
when we analyzed the temporal distance between R t rise and the election day held in Italy
on September 20 (and morning of 21), 2020.
Other reports from across the world are in line with our findings: in Great Britain, staff had
higher incidence than students (27 cases [95% CI 23–32] per 100,000 per day among staff
compared with 18 cases [14–24] in early years students, 6.0 cases [4.3–8.2] in primary
schools students, and 6.8 cases [2.7–14] in secondary school students]) and most cases
linked to outbreaks were in staff members (154 [73%] staff vs 56 [27%] children of 210 total
cases). The median number of secondary cases in outbreaks was one (IQR 1–2) for student
index cases and one (1–5) for staff index cases

33

. In Spain as well, the evolution of the

global incidence does not suggest significant effects of the reopening of schools. In most
cases there was no or a slight increase in pediatric cases, consistent with the diagnostic
efforts in schools

34

. In Germany, data collected from 53,000 schools and daycares in

autumn indicated that only an average of 32 schools one week had more than two positives
35

A different question is whether closing schools is efficacious in curtailing viral spread. In
some Italian regions analyzed here, school closure was mandated by local authorities and
finally in certain regions by the National Government. However, this closure had no effect
on the incidence of Covid19 in the general population or in the decline of Rt, which had
started before the mandated school closure and that continued with the same speed,

irrespective of school closures in Lombardy (partial) and Campania (total). This finding is in
line with a literature review of all available studies (n=16) on the efficacy of school closures
and other social distancing practices in schools in China and Hong Kong, where the rapidly
implemented school closures did not substantially contribute to the control of the spread

15

.

In Australia, by comparing data from 25 schools of different grades with those of the general
population, it was found that students and school staff did not contribute to the spread of the
virus more than the general population

36

. On the other hand, an analysis of the impact of

different NPI on the reproduction number Rt across 131 countries found that at day 28 after
the implementation, school closures alone could reduce Rt by 15% (R ratio: 0.85, 95%CI:
0.66-1.10), whereas school reopening could increase it by 24% (R ratio: 1.24, 95%CI: 1.001.52). However, these estimates are affected by a very large confidence interval, hence are
not statistically significant. Moreover, authors warn on the limitations of their estimates: for
example, they could not consider the different precautions related to the reopening of
schools taken by some countries, such as physical distancing within classrooms and
masking procedures; they did not consider the impact of school holidays and the effect of
reopening different school levels (e.g., elementary and middle schools). Finally, authors
analyze the impact of given NPIs by comparing Rt from two arbitrarily drawn periods before
and after the implementation of the given NPI. While this approach might be more practical
when comparing multiple countries, it is less informative than our analysis performed overall
the Rt curve. Interestingly, we found that Rt started declining even before the implementation
of any NPI, in all the regions analyzed. In certain cases, like the Province of Trento, the
nationally implemented NPI entered in force after R t had declined below the threshold of 1.
These results, while perhaps surprising, are in line with findings from the group of Merler,
who analyzed the impact of the national March-May lockdown on Rt in Italy. While they
concluded that lockdown reduced Rt and brought it below 1, they admitted that the decline
in Rt had started well before the national lockdown was implemented. Visual inspection of

their published Rt curves indeed confirms that this extreme NPI did not affect the slope of Rt
decline 37.
Our study is strengthened by the several sources of data used. Longitudinal data of regional
incidence of SARS-COV-2 positives subjects deposited in the public repository of the Italian
Civil Protection, incidence from the Veneto Region system of Covid19 case notification with
information by age, and incidence in schools from MI with information for students, teachers
and non-teaching staff.
Our study also suffers from some limitations. Information on SARS-CoV-2 positive
individuals in schools are retrieved by school Principals. Second, these data represent the
situation of the whole school, not of the single subjects. Third, data on number of SARSCOV-2 positives subjects deposited in the public repository of the Italian Civil Protection
might suffer from delays in reporting or even worse from differences in reporting criteria by
different regions. It shall be however noted that the nationwide R t computed on the total
positives and that on the cases by diagnostic suspicion are very similar and that their
temporal trends are superimposable, thus reinforcing the strength of the analysis presented
here.
In conclusion, our analysis does not find an association in Italy between dates of school
opening and the increase in SARS-CoV-2 Rt. Reciprocally, school closures did not affect
the rate of Rt decline. Also, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 among students is lower than that
in the general population; In addition, the incidence among teachers is greater than the
incidence in the general population, but comparable to that of recorded in the general
population of the same age. Finally, contact tracing in schools resulted in very low frequency
of secondary infections found per test, and low frequency of clusters despite a high number
of tests every week. Our analysis provides evidence that school openings are not to be
considered as a relevant factor influencing the spread of the Covid19 epidemics and that

school closures did not improve the already occurring decline in the reproduction number of

add further support to the consolidating notion that risks of school closures are not
outweighed by benefits. They moreover suggest that the conclusion that school openings
favored Covid19 spread is correlative at best and hence it does not help in the identification
of the best NPIs to curtail SARS-CoV-2 diffusion.

Figures legends
Figure 1. Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 positives is lower among schoolers than in the
general population.
Bubble graphs of SARS-CoV-2 incidence between September 12 and November 7 for
student in elementary schools (A), middle schools (B) and staff members (teaching and nonteaching, C) in Italian regions and autonomous provinces compared to the incidence in the
general population. Size of bubbles is proportional to the measured incidence in the
analyzed school populations. The 45° line indicates equivalence between general
population and school population incidence. Bubbles are color-coded in a green-yellow-red
gradient of analyzed population/general population ratio.

Figure 2. Box-plots of number of test per week per school.
Boxplots of number of tests performed in the indicated type of school per week in students
and teachers when they are index cases.

Figure 3. Increases in Rt are not univocally correlated with school opening times in
different Italian territories.
Pairwise comparison of median Rt in the indicated 7 days periods (±5-95% Confidence
intervals) in the provinces of Bolzano and Trento (A) and in the indicated regions (B-D). The
dates of the school openings in the respective region or province are marked with a bar of
the same color. The green bars indicate the day of the entry into force of the Presidential
decrees (Decree) detailed in Table 5.

Figure 4. Increases in Rt are univocally correlated with the national election day
across all Italian regions.
Box plots show the indicated quantiles for the days of delay between school openings (A)
and September 20 national election day (B) and Rt increase in Italian regions clustered by
their school opening dates. Date of Rt increase was calculated as the first day of the period
when median Rt started an increase sustained in time (>3 consecutives periods).

Figure 5. During the second Covid19 wave incidence of SARS-CoV-2 rises initially
among young adults and 45-49 years old individuals in Veneto region.
(A, B) Daily incidence and 7 days adjacent average (7DMA) of SARS-CoV-2 positivity
among individuals of the indicated age range. Consistency of the population in each age
bracket was from ISTAT and is detailed in Table 6.
(C) Heatmap of weekly incidence of SarsCoV2 in individuals of the indicated age ranges in
the Veneto region during the indicated timeframe. The color scale goes from green (low
incidence) to beige (medium incidence) and to red (high incidence).

Figure 6. School closures do not affect Rt decrease in Lombardy and Campania.
(A, C) Median Rt in the indicated 7 days periods (±5-95% Confidence intervals) in Lombardy
(A) and Campania (C). Days of school opening and closure are indicated.
(B, D) First order derivative of Rt in Lombardy (B) and Campania (D). Days of school opening
and closure are indicated.

Table 7. Incidence of secondary infections identified during activity of contact tracing
in Italian Schools (from November 23 to December 5, 2020).
Incidence rates of secondary infections are defined as number of cases/number of tests
occurring the same week after a SARS-COV-2 positive student or teacher was found.
LSmeans, 95% Confidence Interval (95%CI) and P-values of rate of secondary infections
per institute and week are estimated with multivariable generalized linear regression model.
P-test indicate differences between incidence rates by type of index case.
