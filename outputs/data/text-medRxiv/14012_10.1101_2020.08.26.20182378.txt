Abstract
Objective
We aim to provide a ‘snapshot’ of the levels of burnout, anxiety, depression and distress among
healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Design, setting, participants
We distributed an online survey via social media in June 2020 that was open to any UK
healthcare worker. The primary outcome measure was symptoms of burnout as measured using
the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI). Secondary outcomes of depression, anxiety and
distress as measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, General Anxiety Scale-7, and
Impact of Events Scale-Revised were recorded along with subjective measures of stress.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with
burnout, depression, anxiety and distress.
Results
Of 539 persons responding to the survey, 90% were female, and 26% were aged 41-50 years,
53% were nurses. Participants with moderate-to-severe burnout were younger (49% [206/424]
versus 33% [38/115] under 40 years, P=0.004), and more likely to have pre-existing
comorbidities (21% versus 12%, P=0.031). They were twice as likely to have been redeployed
from their usual role (22% versus 11%; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.2, 95% confidence interval
[CI] 1.5-3.3, P=0.042), or to work in an area dedicated to COVID-19 patients (50% versus
32%, adjusted OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8, P<0.001), and were almost 4-times more likely to have
previous depression (24% versus 7%; adjusted OR 3.6, 95% CI 2.2-5.9, P=0.012). A supportive
workplace team and male sex protected against burnout reducing the odds by 40% (adjusted
OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.7, P<0.001) and 70% (adjusted OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.5, P=0.003),
respectively.

Conclusion
Independent predictors of burnout were younger staff, redeployment to a new working area,
working with patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, and being female or having a
previous history of depression. Evaluation of existing psychological support interventions is
required with targeted approaches to ensure support is available to those most at risk.

Introduction

Healthcare workers in both the acute and community settings have played a key role in
responding to the global COVID-19 pandemic. As person-to-person transmission was
confirmed (1), healthcare workers were faced with increased risk of exposure to SARS-CoV2 and put under considerable psychological stress with the risk of developing adverse mental
health outcomes (2). Previous investigations have shown that direct contact with highly
infectious patients is associated with stress in healthcare workers (3-5) therefore burnout
among this professional group is of great concern. During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare
staff have been exposed to increased workload, working in unfamiliar areas, returning to
clinical practice from non-frontline roles, pervasive media coverage and concerns about access
to appropriate personal protective equipment, layered on top of concerns for the health of
family and friends - all factors which could contribute to mental stress. As the wellbeing of
health professionals is likely to influence the care they deliver, caring for our staff may also
indirectly impact patient outcomes (6).

As the UK along with many countries around the world emerges from lockdown restrictions,
now is the ideal time to reflect on the health and wellbeing of our healthcare workforce. Should
a wave of cases occur over the winter months and coincide with the annual peak demand on
the health service, we will once again call healthcare workers to the front line. Policy makers
should be using this opportunity to develop effective support mechanisms to ensure healthcare
workers’ mental-wellbeing is prioritised (7).

We aim to provide a ‘snapshot’ of the levels of burnout, anxiety, depression and distress among
healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Identifying factors associated with

increased prevalence of these measures will highlight the need for interventions and identify
staff groups who may be more at risk of adverse psychological outcomes. This will better
inform future government and health board decisions about allocation of resources to staff
wellbeing, and better inform how these resources can be targeted to those with the highest risk
of adverse mental-wellbeing outcomes.

Methods

Study Population
The study was designed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental
wellbeing of those working in healthcare in the United Kingdom. Anybody working in this
sector was eligible for inclusion in the study. Participants were recruited through a non-funded
social-media campaign initiated by the study investigators (1 male and 2 female) using
snowball sampling (sharing of the survey link among networks). All information was collected
anonymously.

Questionnaire design
The questionnaire collected participant demographics (including age, sex, past medical history,
professional role, social living situation and caring responsibilities within the family), concerns
over COVID-19 (exposure to patients with COVID-19, access to personal protective
equipment, and sources of stress), and access to health and wellbeing support (informal team
support, professional support offered by the work place, and external professional support).
Questions were developed by the team who were working in clinical roles during this period
and reviewed by a clinical psychologist working within the National Health Service (NHS) in
Scotland. In addition, validated measures of burnout, depression, anxiety and distress were
used to evaluate the incidence of these factors using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI)
(8), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (9), General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) (10)
and the Impact of Event Scale (IES-R) (11) respectively. These scales have previously been
effective in determining incidence of our chosen outcomes in a healthcare staff population (2,
4, 12, 13). A copy of the questionnaire is available from the authors on request.

Trial Outcomes
The primary outcome of this study was the incidence of either moderate or severe burnout of
healthcare staff. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of either moderate or severe
depression, anxiety and distress. All outcomes were based on self-reported symptoms using
well-validated measures of burnout, depression, anxiety and distress. A score of 50 or greater
on the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory was used as a threshold to indicate moderate or above
burnout (calculated as a mean of the three subscales representing total burnout), whereas scores
of greater than 10 were used as a threshold for moderate or above depression or anxiety on the
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and General Anxiety Disorder-7 scale. A score above 26
indicated at least moderate distress on the Impact of Events scale. A breakdown for how the
scores were calculated is included in the Supplementary Appendix (Table S1). Additional
secondary outcomes included subjective measurement of increased stress during the COVID
pandemic, and the reasons for this, as well as the reasons participants may not have accessed
support services available in the workplace. Emerging data from Singapore and India suggests
that approximately 10% of healthcare professionals managing patients with COVID-19
experience moderate to severe anxiety (14). We estimate that recruitment of 500 participants
into our study will identify at least 50 participants who have at least a moderate level of anxiety.

Ethical Approval
The study was reviewed and approved by the University of Edinburgh ethics review panel
from the school of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences.

Baseline characteristics were summarised for the study population and in groups according to
the presence or absence of moderate-severe burnout, depression, anxiety and distress.
Continuous variables are presented as mean (SD) or median (IQR), as appropriate. Categorical
variables are presented as absolute numbers (%). Group-wise comparisons were performed
using Chi-square, Kruskal Wallis or one-way analysis of variance tests as appropriate.
Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of the
primary outcome, or either secondary outcome and influence of baseline variables. Baseline
variables for the model were selected a priori based on their clinical relevance, including age,
sex, past medical history (including known ischaemic heart disease or coronary artery disease,
diabetes mellitus, or immunocompromise), previous history of mental illness, whether they had
a family member at high-risk of COVID-19, whether they were a carer for another adult, as
well as descriptors of their working environment (including potential exposure to COVID-19
patients, their access to personal protective equipment, and how supported they felt in their
workplace team). All analyses were performed in R (Version 3.5.1).

Results

Population demographics
Between 17th and 24th June 2020, 539 participants completed the study questionnaire (26%
[141/539] aged 41-50 years, 90% [480/533] female, 53% [286/539] nurses). The majority of
participants lived and worked in Scotland (97%, 512/530) Table S2). Accordingly, the
occupation and sex of participants in the study closely reflected the National Health Service
(NHS) workforce (15). Baseline characteristics of the study population are summarised
stratified by the presence or absence of moderate-to-severe burnout (Table 1).
Population with moderate-severe burnout
Burnout was present in the majority of participants in the study (79%, 424/539). Compared to
participants who did not have moderate-to-severe burnout, those who met the Copenhagen
Burnout Inventory criteria tended to be younger (49% [206/424] versus 33% [38/115] under
40 years, P=0.004) and female (92% versus 83%, P=0.004). They were twice as likely to have
pre-existing comorbidities (21% versus 12%, unadjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.9, 95% CI 1.4-2.6,
P=0.031), and were 4-times more likely to have previous mental illness, such as depression
(24% versus 7%, unadjusted OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.6-6.1, P<0.001). After adjusting for other
variables (Table 2), previous depression remained the most powerful independent predictor of
moderate-severe burnout, increasing the odds by more than 3-fold (adjusted OR 3.6, 95% CI
2.2-5.9, P=0.012).
Participant occupation and working environment also had a significant impact on the incidence
of burnout (Table 2). Those with moderate-severe burnout were twice as likely to have been
redeployed from their normal place of work (22% versus 11%, adjusted OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.53.3, P=0.042), and work in an area dedicated to treating patients with confirmed COVID-19

infection (50% versus 32%, adjusted OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.4-1.8, P<0.001). Participants with
burnout also had less frequent access to all of the personal protective equipment required to
work safely (64% versus 75% always having access to personal protective equipment,
P=0.047), however in adjusted models this association was attenuated. A supportive workplace
team and male sex were both powerful independent predictors protecting against burnout,
reducing the odds by 40% (adjusted OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.7, P<0.001) and 70% (adjusted OR
0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.5, P=0.003), respectively.
Secondary outcomes of moderate-severe depression, anxiety, and distress
Baseline characteristics stratified by the presence of moderate-severe depression, anxiety and
distress are summarised in Table S3. In participants with moderate or severe depression, as
classified by the PHQ-9 score, treating patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection (adjusted
OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.4, P=0.023), previous depression (adjusted OR 3.6, 95% CI 2.6-4.9,
P<0.001), and a supportive workplace team (adjusted OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.7-0.8, P=0.001), were
all important independent predictors of the odds of depression. Similar results were seen in
models to predict moderate-severe anxiety (Table S4). Only 5/539 participants scored above
the threshold for moderate distress as classified by IES-R (Table S3).
Stress and workplace staff support
The majority of participants (76%, 408/539) recorded that they had felt stressed during the
COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 1). This was primarily because of concern about their family’s
health (73%, 296/408), or their own risk of contracting COVID-19 (64%, 262/408). Other
reasons for increased stress included concern about access to personal protective equipment
(36% 148/408), their ability to do their job properly (32%, 131/408), and having to cope with
higher patient mortality (35%, 144/408), with nearly one third of participants remarking that
these reasons had caused them concern. Only a minority of participants who reported stress

had accessed local workplace support (23%, 70/306). The most common reason for not doing
so was not feeling a need for support, despite increased stress (48%, 113/236), although 38%
(89/236) felt they needed support but did not have time, whilst 1 in 7 participants felt that they
needed support but they did not want their colleagues to know (14%, 34/236) or that the support
was not relevant to them (15%, 36/236). Dedicated workplace support was not available to 1
in 4 participants (25%, 102/408).

Discussion

Prior to COVID-19, burnout among healthcare workers was already a concern (16, 17) The
concept of burnout is characterised by feelings of stress due to excessive work demands
(exhaustion), a detached attitude towards work and towards those with whom one works
(depersonalisation), and reduced feelings of efficiency and attainment (professional efficacy)
(18). Working in a healthcare profession during the pandemic may exacerbate these feelings
due the unknown nature of the disease, working with a high volume of infected patients, and
personal risk of contracting the virus. Burnout not only has consequences of the individual
health professional, but also for the patient and colleagues due to higher risk of making poor
decisions; possible hostile attitude toward patients; medical errors; and difficult relationships
with co-workers (19). Whilst burnout is recognised as a different construct to anxiety and
depression, there is an association between the conditions (18). It is imperative that we are
aware of these conditions among our workforce for their own personal health, and also their
ability to continue to perform their professional roles should a second wave of COVID-19
occur.

We report that the independent predictors of overall burnout among our sample population are
being younger, female, redeployed to a new working area, particularly where working with
patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, concerns over access to adequate personal
protective equipment, and a prior history of depression.

At the start of a healthcare crisis there is an initial sense of eagerness to contribute to the
healthcare effort and a sense of obligation to work through the pandemic (20). As the usual
services offered by the NHS were paused to concentrate all available resources on COVID-19,

many staff volunteered to work in roles, or were redeployed to roles, that were unfamiliar to
them. These redeployed professionals are at particular risk of burnout therefore health and
wellbeing interventions should be targeted to reach these staff. Interventions can be focused at
the level of the individual or within organisational structures. Organisation directed
interventions (teamwork, leadership, workload, shift rotation) were seen to reduce burnout
more than individual directed interventions in a meta-analytic review investigating burnout in
physicians with De Simone and colleagues concluding that individual directed interventions
must be underpinned by organisational approaches (21). Examples of organisational support in
a pandemic can take the form of prioritising staff safety (access to personal protective
equipment), organising rotas so that teams can stay together, supporting staff to implement
recommendations, and ensuring visibility of managers (22). The inadequacy of personal
protective equipment supplies was heavily reported in the media at the start of the outbreak
and guidance of appropriate personal protective equipment evolved as new knowledge came
to light. Keeping the workforce fully informed of the scientific basis for the chosen personal
protective equipment provision may help staff feel safer. Psychological interventions targeted
at individuals appear to be appreciated by healthcare workers though studies reporting impact
on psychological outcomes or experience of using these interventions was rarely reported.
Telephone helplines are an example of an intervention targeted at the individual and while staff
appreciated the availability of this service, it could also be viewed as too impersonal to be an
effective support mechanism (23).

It is interesting to note that more than three quarters of the workforce surveyed reported feeling
heightened stress levels at work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, fewer than 1 in
4 of those with stress had accessed workplace support. The main reason for not accessing
support was that they felt they did not require support, despite feeling heightened stress levels.

This phenomenon is not unusual amongst healthcare workers with a delay between eventtiming, and reflective practice that allows staff to acknowledge the emotional impact of their
work (23). As not all of those recognising their need for support accessed support, this suggests
that the structure through which the support is being offered may not be meeting the needs of
those it is intended to serve. Not having time to access support, and not wanting colleagues to
know they were seeking support were two of the main barriers to access. The use of digital
platforms has been shown to be effective in delivering psychological treatment (24). Such
platforms may be an option for employers to offer healthcare staff support which can be
accessed discreetly at an appropriate time for that individual. The remaining reason for not
accessing support were that it was ‘not relevant’. It is possible that the support sought by these
individuals related more to organisational structures as described above. These survey results
therefore highlight the need for qualitative studies to explore how employers can better support
staff from an individual and organisational perspective to identify what type of intervention is
desired, what is effective, for whom, and when it is required (23). One of the few factors found
to be protective against burnout, depression and anxiety was feeling supported at work. Peer
supervision and strong teamwork have been previously shown to strengthen workplace
wellbeing (25). Healthcare employers could support service leads, ward managers, senior
nurses, and local supervisors to understand their critical role in supporting their staff.

As well as identifying as a healthcare worker, it has been necessary for many staff to also take
on a new identity in a way that has not been demanded previously. As patients and families
have been unable to be together during critical illness or in the last stages of life, healthcare
staff have adopted the role of surrogate family member in very difficult circumstances needing
to provide strong emotional support to both patients and relatives. Heavy emotional burden has
been previously shown to be a predictor of burnout among healthcare workers (12, 26).

Working in COVID-19 designated areas with a high concentration of critically ill and dying
patients will place an even higher emotional demand on staff which may be a contributing
cause to burnout seen in this staff group. Focusing support interventions in these areas will be
particularly valuable.

As well as a professional identity, healthcare workers also occupy multiple other identities
including that of parents, children, siblings, and friends. The major causes of stress among
those surveyed were fears for personal health and that of the family. Whilst caring for others,
healthcare workers feared putting their own families at risk. Previous studies have reported that
prioritising wellbeing of family members represented a barrier to working during an influenza
pandemic with degree of worry related to intentional absenteeism (20, 27). With burnout
currently present in the majority (79%) of survey participants, employers risk losing staff if not
supported adequately should a second wave occur. The COVID-19 pandemic is having a
profound impact on society at all levels including mental and physical health (28, 29).
Supporting healthcare workers as both individuals and professionals will help optimise
individual and team performance in the long term.

Much effort by the public and NHS employers has aimed to help healthcare staff feel supported
with offers of gifts or discounts from local and national businesses, a national weekly
celebration of their efforts, and relaxation and support hubs in the workplace. As the current
health and wellbeing interventions do not appear to be optimised, employers should aim to
revise the support offered through thorough evaluation with intended service users and target
future interventions to staff groups most at risk. As life in the United Kingdom starts to return
to normal, it may not do so for healthcare professionals as they begin to reflect on the impact

COVID-19 has had on their professional and personal lives. Taking care of healthcare staff is
the only way to ensure their continuing ability to care for our most vulnerable and sick patients.

Limitations
This study has several limitations. The majority of respondents were female, which is perhaps
not unsurprising given than more than half were from the nursing profession where 89% of
the workforce are women (15). We did not collect data on ethnicity of respondents. As it is
now known that black and ethnic minority groups are more adversely affected by COVID-19
this may have an impact on mental health outcomes among these staff groups. However, in
Scotland 96% of the population identify as white (30) therefore it is unlikely we could have
performed analyses stratified by ethnicity in our respondent population. Additionally, it is
possible that a mental health social media survey has captured the responses of those that are
already engaged with the topic and may therefore overestimate the prevalence burnout, anxiety
and depression in the target population.
