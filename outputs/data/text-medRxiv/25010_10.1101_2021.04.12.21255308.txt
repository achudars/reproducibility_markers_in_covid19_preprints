Abstract
Background: CoronaVac, a vaccine containing inactivated SARS-CoV-2, demonstrated efficacy
of 50.39% 14 days or more after the 2nd dose.
The objective of this study is to report the occurrence of symptomatic COVID-19 in a cohort of
HCW vaccinated with CoronaVac and to estimate its effectiveness.
Methods: CoronaVac was given to HCWs inHospital das Clinicas on 18-21 January, 2021 (epi
week 3) (22,402 HCWs), and on 14-16 February, 2021 (epi week 7) (21,652 HCWs). Weekly
cases of symptomatic COVID-19 were evaluated. Using the period from 2020 epi week 24
through 2021 epi week 2 (before vaccination), a Poisson regression was fit to model the
HCWs with COVID-19 of the hospital, and the officially reported cases in the city of São Paulo.
The predicted numbers of cases among HCWs for 2021 epi weeks 3-12 were then compared
to the observed numbers of cases (after vaccination). Effectiveness was estimated for weeks
9-12 (2 to 5 weeks after the 2nd dose). 142 samples after vaccination were evaluated for
SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.
Results: Since the 1st dose there were 380 HCW diagnosed with COVID-19. On visual analysis,
the number of cases of COVID-19 in the city increased sharply in 2021. The number of cases
among the HCW did not follow. The estimated effectiveness 2 and 3 weeks after 2nd dose was
50.7% and 51.8%, respectively, and increased over the next 2 weeks. 67/142 samples (47%)
were variants of concern, mostly P1 (57).
Conclusion: Coronavac is effective in preventing COVID-19.

Introduction
CoronaVac, a vaccine containing inactivated SARS-CoV-2, was well tolerated and induced
humoral responses in phase 1 and 2 studies [1]. Interim analysis of phase 3 clinical trial
conducted in Brazil evaluating 12,607 participants demonstrated efficacy of 50.39% (95%CI:
35.26 – 61.98; p=0.005) when considering 15 days or more after the 2nd dose [2].
Efficacy and effectiveness of vaccines measure the proportion of reduction of a disease
among vaccinated persons. The difference is that efficacy is used during a clinical trial, under
ideal circumstances and effectiveness is used when a study is performed under everyday
conditions, outside of clinical trials [3]. To our knowledge there are no studies on the
effectiveness of CoronaVac.
The objective of this study is to report the occurrence of symptomatic COVID-19 in a cohort of
healthcare workers (HCW) vaccinated with CoronaVac and to estimate its effectiveness.

Methods
Hospital das Clinicas (HC) is a tertiary-care teaching hospital of the University of São Paulo,
Brazil. It is located in the city of São Paulo that has 12,325,232 inhabitants [4]. HC has 2,200
beds distributed over 7 buildings. It was the main reference hospital for severe COVID-19
infections in the State of São Paulo, from 30 March through August 30, 2020, with
approximately 1,000 beds dedicated to COVID-19, of which 300 were in intensive care units
(ICU). During these months HC admitted approximately 4,500 severe COVID-19 cases. After
that period, approximately 25% (555 beds) of HC’s beds, including 200 ICU beds, remained
dedicated to COVID-19, while the rest was used for admission of other severe clinical and
surgical cases that had backed-up during the previous months. Starting on 2021 epi week 10,
the pressing demand led to progressive increases in beds allocated for COVID-19. The work
force in HC is approximately 20,000 HCWs who deliver direct assistance or have other close
contact with patients.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, symptomatic HCWs were directed to specific
HCW health services where they were evaluated by a doctor and received a 3-day leave. On
day 3 of symptoms they collected oro-nasopharyngeal swabs, tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV3

2. If negative and asymptomatic they returned to work. If positive, they received paid leave
for a total of 14 days. No follow-up testing was done once the HCW was found to be positive.
Over 4 days (18-21 January, 2021 - epi week 3), a large vaccination effort led to the
vaccination of 22,402 HCWs with the first dose of CoronaVac. The second dose was delivered
over 3 days (14-16 February, 2021 - during epi week 7) and 21,652 HCWs received the 2nd
dose of the vaccine.
CoronaVac is an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine developed by Sinovac Life Sciences (Beijing,
China). Phase 1/2 studies showed it to be safe and to lead to seroconversion [1]. It was
licenced for use in Brazil on 17 January, 2021. Unpublished efficacy has been reported to be
50.39% [2]. CoronaVac vaccination was studied using 2 doses of 600 SU administered 2 to 4
weeks apart.
Over the period from 23 February, 2020 (2020 epidemiological week 9) through 28 March,
2021 (2021 epi week 12) we recorded the weekly numbers of HCWs in HC who had
symptomatic COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR, evaluated by the hospital’s HCW health
services.
Over the same period we evaluated the weekly number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19
related deaths in the city of São Paulo that is publicly reported [5]; and the index of immobility
[6]. This index is based on the location of cell phones, with data from the 4 mobile phone
companies that cover the city. The cell phones are considered to have “slept” in the location
registered between 10PM to 2AM. After that, displacements of more than 200m from that
point are registered. The index is the proportion of telephones that were not displaced over
24 hours. We presented the average for each epi week.
RT-PCR was done in samples obtained by swabbing of oro-nasopharynx, using a laboratory
developed test based on the Charitè protocol [7]. Part of the positive samples was evaluated
for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concerns (VOC) using a screening protocol [8] that
detects the deletion in the NSP6 gene that is common for the P1, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351
lineages. The samples were also studied using a protocol [9] that is able to distinguish B1.1.7
from P1 and B 1.351 lineages.

Statistical Analysis
A Poisson regression model was used to study the relationship between the weekly number of
COVID-19 cases among HC HCW, taken as dependent variable, and cases recorded for the
general population of São Paulo city. The fit was based on data from the pre-vaccination
period, from 2020 epi week 24 to 2021 epi week 2. Residual analyses were then performed,
showing two influential points. After removal of such values, a final model was obtained and
used to extrapolate the number of cases among HC HCW considering the known values for
the population of São Paulo city in the post-vaccination period (2021 epi week 3 to 12). In
addition, 95% prediction intervals were computed using the bootstrap resampling method.
The observed values of COVID-19 cases among HC HCW were then compared to the predicted
ones for the post-vaccination period. Effectiveness estimates and corresponding 95%
bootstrap confidence intervals were computed assuming the observed number of HC HCW
cases as the vaccinated group and the predicted numbers from the Poisson model as the
unvaccinated group.

Results
The weekly behaviour of symptomatic COVID-19 among the hospital’s HCW, and the publicly
available data on the COVID-19 cases in the city of São Paulo can be seen in Figure 1. The
results of deaths in the city of São Paulo and the immobility index, can be seen in
Supplemental Figure S1.
During the period from 10 March, 2020 through 28 March, 2020 there were 20,187 medical
consultations of suspected cases and follow-up of COVID-19 cases at the HCW health facility;
13,713 RT-PCR tests performed on HCW, of which 3,565 (26%) were positive. The 1st peak of
cases among HC HCWs preceded the peak of cases in the city. However, the curve of deaths in
the city behaved in a similar way to HCW cases. Thus we attributed the difference to sub
notification of cases in the city, as testing was not readily available at the beginning of the
pandemic. Because of this, in the analysis we excluded 2020 epi weeks 9 through 23. On visual
analysis, after HCW vaccination in HC, the number of cases of COVID-19 in the city of São
Paulo increased very sharply. The number of cases among the HCW of HC did not follow this
pattern.

The results from the Poisson regression fit considering period from 2020 epi week 24 to 2021
epi week 2 can be seen in Figure 2. The observed number of cases for HC HCWs for the weeks
3 through 12 post-vaccination period, as well as prediction values and 95% prediction
intervals can be seen in Table 1. The predicted number of cases among HC HCWs can be
thought of as what would be observed if this population had not been vaccinated; therefore,
the differences between the actual number of cases and the predicted ones may be
interpreted as the effect of immunization. None of the prediction intervals includes the
observed values, that were always below the interval inferior limit, reinforcing our findings.
Estimated effectiveness was 50.7% (95% CI: 33.3-62.5%); 51.8% (95%CI: 30.0-66.0%); 68.4%
(95%CI: 51.0-80.8%); and 73.8% (95%CI: 57.0-84.8%) for 2021 epi weeks 9, 10, 11, and 12,
respectively. These weeks correspond to 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks after the 2nd dose of CoronaVac,
respectively. The estimated effectiveness on epi weeks 9 and 10 was somewhat similar to the
efficacy described for this vaccine; and for weeks 11 and 12 it was even greater. Nevertheless,
estimated effectiveness for weeks 10-12 should be interpreted with caution because the
number of cases in the city of São Paulo was superior to the maximum number of cases
(17,566) considered in estimating the Poisson regression used for predictions.
During 2021, there were 9 hospitalizations of HCW in HC due to COVID-19: 6 had not been
vaccinated, 1 had received one dose of CoronaVac, and 2 had received 2 doses. Only one of
these died, who had not been vaccinated.
Among 142 HCW’s respiratory samples randomly evaluated, in 67 (47%) variants of concern
(VOC) were detected: 57 were variant P1, 5 were B.1.1.7, and 5 were other VOC not identified
by our methods.
The index of immobility increased at the beginning of the pandemic reaching a peak of 57%.
Slowly it decreased and has been relatively stable since November 2020, at about 40%
(Supplemental Figure S1).
By 29 March, 2021, 1,255,627 people (10% of the population) in the city of São Paulo had
received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 437,438 (3.5%) had received 2 doses
[10].

Discussion
Despite the studies of efficacy of vaccines against COVID-19, little is known about their
effectiveness, or how they perform in real-life conditions. In a large cohort of HCWs who were
vaccinated in a mass campaign with CoronaVac, an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we
observed an important decrease over time of confirmed symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in
relation to what would have been expected considering the epidemiological situation in the
same community.
The phase 3 trial evaluating CoronaVac included over 12,000 individuals and showed a 50.38%
efficacy [2]. The data are still unpublished.

Following licencing in Brazil, mass vaccination of HC HCWs was done. This gave us an
opportunity to estimate the effectiveness of the vaccine in a large cohort. The preliminary
results suggest that it was effective.
Although efficacy has been studied and varied among the different vaccines, little has been
published on effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, that is their effect in real-world conditions.
An evaluation of 2 FDA approved vaccines (BNT162b2 from Pfizer/BioNTech and mRNA-1273
from Moderna, with efficacies of 95.0% and 94.1%, respectively) in the Mayo Clinic system in
the US, showed that the administration of 2 doses was 88.7% effective in preventing SARSCoV-2 infection at least 36 days after the 1st dose [11]. A study involving 6 locations in the US,
with HCW and first responders, showed an effectiveness of 90% after 2 doses of mRNA
vaccines [12]. A study in Israel, a country that has been highly successful in rapidly vaccinating
its population with BNT162b2, estimated an effectiveness of 66-85% in reducing SARS-CoV-2
positive cases and over 90% in reducing severe hospitalizations [13]. To our knowledge, there
has been no data on the effectiveness of CoronaVac, an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The
estimated effectiveness of CoronaVac in our study was at least 50% starting 2 weeks after the
second dose.
Another interesting finding was the prevalence of variants: almost half of the studied samples.
There has been a concern whether vaccination can lead to an increase in infections caused by
variants because vaccines may not be efficient against them [14]. However, we believe that
this high prevalence, especially of P1, reflects the epidemiological situation in the region. The
variant P1 was described as emerging in the Amazon region in Brazil in November 2020 and
spread rapidly, becoming the predominant strain in 7 weeks, accounting for 87% of cases [15].
It has also dominated the epidemic in several regions of the country. Recently the city of São
Paulo reported 64% of P1 and 7% of B.1.1.7 in samples collected from 16 February to 6 March,
2021 [16]. Thus, our results probably reflect the distribution of variants in the community.
Our study has limitations. In the first place, it is a very preliminary evaluation in which details
of affected patients such as severity of disease and deaths were not taken into account.
Secondly, the peak of cases among HCWs in HC preceded the peak of cases in the city of São
Paulo. We believe that this was due to the lack of diagnosis of mild and moderate cases in the
city. In HC, testing was immediately available to all symptomatic HCWs since the beginning of
the pandemic. In support of our idea, the peak of deaths in the city was similar to the cases in

our HCWs. It has been discussed that deaths are a more reliable surveillance tool in situations
in which testing capacity is limited [17, 18] which was especially true in the beginning of the
pandemic in São Paulo. Considering this situation we chose not to include data from 2020 epi
weeks 9 through 23 when designing our predictive model. As mentioned earlier, the results
for 2021 epi weeks 10-12 should be interpreted with caution, as the numbers of cases in the
city of São Paulo in these weeks were outside the range variation observed during parameter
estimation of the Poisson regression model.
In conclusion, since 2021 epi week 3, when the first dose of CoronaVac was administered to
the HCW of the hospital, COVID-19 cases among our HCWs were lower than expected. São
Paulo started a second wave of COVID-19 soon after the completion of vaccination in HC, that
was not reflected among our HCWs.
