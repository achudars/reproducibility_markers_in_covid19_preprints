Abstract
COVID-19 has laid bare the United States economically and epidemiologically. Decisions must be made
as how and when to reopen industries. Here we quantify economic and health risk tradeoffs of
reopening by industry for each state in the US. To estimate total economic impact, we summed income
loss due to unemployment and profit loss. We assess transmission risk by: (1) workplace size, (2) human
interactions, (3) inability to work from home, and (4) industry size. We found that the industry with the
highest estimated economic impact from COVID-19 was manufacturing in 40 states; the industry with
the largest transmission risk index was accommodation and food services in 41 states, and the industry
with the highest economic impact per unit of transmission risk, interpreted as the value of reopening,
was manufacturing in 37 states. Researchers and decision makers must work together to consider both
health and economics when making tough decisions.

Background
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States was a travel-associated case in Snohomish
County, Washington screened on January 19th, 2020 (1). As of June 6th, the United States has recorded
1,917,080 cases and 109,702 deaths (2). On February 29th, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of
emergency in Washington, soon after which companies began urging employees to work from home if
possible (3). On March 13th, President Trump declared a national emergency (4). On March 23rd, eight
states had statewide stay-at-home orders in place, and by April 7th that had increased to 42 states (5).
Stay-at-home-orders began to expire as early as April for a few states, with most lasting in to May and a
few in to June (5). All 50 states have begun reopening, though approaches to doing so vary(5).
While shutdown measures have been necessary to control the spread of COVID-19, they also take a toll
on the economy: unemployment in the U.S. is over 13%, with the highest rate in Nevada, at more than
24% (6). However, heedlessly reopening the economy could lead not only to drastic increases in COVID19 cases, but also to even greater economic downturn due to added health burden and consumer risk
(7). Part of planning to reopen the economy will be carefully considering which businesses to reopen
and when to do so.
The economic impacts of the shutdown have not been uniform across industries; therefore, reopening
will have differential impacts for different industries. Unemployment has centered on industries that
rely on in-person interactions, specifically those that cannot be done with remote work such as
restaurants and in-person retail. Ideally, leaders will target reopening industries that have experienced
large unemployment or overall economic distress due to COVID-19, however, it is also important to
consider the transmission risks in each industry. Workplaces that require significant close contact with
large numbers of people or utilize work that cannot be done remotely have a higher likelihood of
increased transmission than others. Here, we define reopening of an industry to indicate that should
stay-at-home orders be lifted, employees able to work from home would continue to do so, and safety
interventions such as hand-washing and mask wearing would continue. In this analysis we aim to
quantify the tradeoffs between economic impact and health risks for economic reopening by industry
for each state in the US.

Methods
We aimed to evaluate (1) the economic impact of the shutdown and (2) the relative transmission risk of
reopening industries in each state. Industries were categorized by the North American Industry
Classification System (NAICS) (8). There are many sub-industries and business types within the NAICS
industry groupings with economic impacts and transmission risks that may not be accurately reflected in
industry-level data. The fact that this report reflects only industry-level data is a limitation. For all data
sources referred to below, see Appendix 1 for details. We chose to compare Washington and California
in the examples below, due to the first reported case occurring in Washington state and the relevant
comparison of California due to proximity and large economy.

Economic Impact
To estimate total economic impact by industry (𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑛), we summed income loss due to unemployment
(𝑈𝑛𝑒𝑚𝑝) and profit loss (𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑓) as follows:
𝐸𝑐𝑜𝑛𝐼,𝑆 = 𝑈𝑛𝑒𝑚𝑝𝐼,𝑆 + 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑓𝐼,𝑆
where Econ is the total economic impact in industry I in state S. All costs were converted to 2019 USD.
To estimate income loss due to unemployment by industry and state, 𝑈𝑛𝑒𝑚𝑝𝐼,𝑆 , we used continued
unemployment claims from April 2020 (𝑈𝐼,𝑆 ) to calculate the industry distribution of unemployment due
to COVID-19. Continued unemployment claims are reported for each state by industry once a month,
representing continued claims the week of the 19th, or people who were unemployed the week of the
12thof each month (9). We then applied the industry unemployment proportions to the total
unemployment due to COVID-19 in each state. Total unemployment due to COVID-19 in each state was
calculated as the difference between weekly unemployment percent, 𝜎𝑆 , the week of May 23rd and the
average weekly unemployment percent for all of 2019 (6). This rate was applied to the total civilian
employed population age 16 and older in the state, 𝑁𝑆 (10), and finally average weekly wage in that
industry 𝜔𝑆,𝐼 (11).
𝑈𝑛𝑒𝑚𝑝𝐼,𝑆 =

∑𝑤 𝜎𝑆,𝑦=2019
𝑈𝐼,𝑆
∗ (𝜎𝑆,𝑤=𝑀𝑎𝑦16,𝑦=2020 −
) ∗ 𝑁𝑆 ∗ 𝜔𝑆,𝐼
∑𝐼,𝑆 𝑈
12

To estimate profit loss, 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑓𝐼,𝑆 , we first found the percent decrease in sales likely attributed to Covid-19.
Using SafeGraph weekly mobility data (12), we calculated the percent decrease in customer interactions,
𝜇, in each industry from the week of March 30th, 2020 (the lowest point of mobility) to the equivalent
week in 2019. SafeGraph is a data company that aggregates anonymized location data from numerous
applications in order to provide insights about physical places. To enhance privacy, SafeGraph excludes
census block group information if fewer than five devices visited an establishment in a month (two
devices in a week) from a given census block group. Customer interactions include any interaction
lasting less than four hours (12). We assumed that any job that can be done from home (𝛿𝐼 ) would not
be subject to profit loss (13). For jobs that cannot be done from home (1 − 𝛿𝐼 ), we calculated profit as
the weekly revenue, 𝜌𝐼,𝑆 (14), multiplied by the expected profit margin, 𝜃𝐼 . (15).
𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑓𝐼,𝑆 = (𝜇𝐼,𝑆,𝑤=𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑐ℎ30,𝑦=2020 − 𝜇𝐼,𝑆,𝑤=𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑐ℎ30,𝑦=2019 ) ∗ (1 − 𝛿𝐼 ) ∗ 𝜌𝐼,𝑆 ∗ 𝜃𝐼

Transmission Risk Index
We calculated a transmission risk index (𝑇𝑆,𝐼 ) based on a summation of four factors: (1) workplace size:
average number of employees per individual workplace (𝑃𝑆,𝐼 ), normalized 0-1 with 0 representing the
smallest number of employees per workplace and one representing the largest; (2) human interactions:
expected number of human interactions that would resume if the industry were reopened (𝐻𝑆,𝐼 ),
normalized 0-1; (3) inability to work from home: percent of jobs that cannot be done from home in each
industry (𝛿𝐼 ), normalized 0-1; and (4) industry size: total number of employees in each industry in each
state(𝑁𝑆,𝐼 ), normalized 0-1. The transmission risk index is calculated as follows:
𝑇𝑆,𝐼 =

𝑃𝑆,𝐼 − 𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑃)
𝐻𝑆,𝐼 − 𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝐻)
𝑁𝑆,𝐼 − 𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑁)
+
+ (1 − 𝛿𝐼 ) +
𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑃) − 𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑃) 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝐻) − 𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝐻)
𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑁) − 𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑁)
where 𝐻𝑆,𝐼 = (𝜐𝐼,𝑆,𝑤=𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑐ℎ30,𝑦=2020 − 𝜐𝐼,𝑆,𝑤=𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑐ℎ30,𝑦=2019 )

and where 𝜐𝐼,𝑆,𝑤,𝑦 is the number of human interactions in industry 𝐼, state 𝑆, during week 𝑤 of year 𝑦.
This risk index is intended to quantify potential transmission risk differences between industries. It
cannot be used to directly predict cases or disease burden.
We hypothesized that a workplace building with more employees would be more likely to facilitate
higher levels of transmission. For this factor, we found the mean number of employees per
establishment in each industry in each state and normalized the result from zero to one (16). This data
source does not include the physical size of each workplace (e.g., warehouse workers may have less
frequent physical contact than those in office buildings), which is a limitation of this approach.
In addition to potential interactions between employees, we aimed to quantify a factor for total human
interactions in each industry that have been eliminated due to social distancing and shutdown policies.
These interactions would be expected to restart if the industry were reopened. We used SafeGraph
weekly mobility data to calculate the difference in total interactions 𝜐𝐼,𝑆,𝑤,𝑦 between the week of March
30th, 2020, which was the lowest point of mobility, to the equivalent week in 2019 for each industry, and
we assigned interaction scores on a scale from zero to one, with zero representing the fewest
interactions and one representing the most (12).
Additionally, we included a factor for the percent of jobs that cannot be done from home for each
industry and included a factor for the size of the industry, measured by total number of employees in
each state, normalized from zero to one (10,13). The transmission risk index assumes that if the industry
was reopened, those who can do their job from home would continue to do so.

Results
In California, for example, the top three industries for economic impact due to COVID-19 shutdowns
were (1) manufacturing, (2) healthcare and social assistance, and (3) retail trade, compared to (1)
manufacturing, (2) construction, and (3) healthcare and social assistance in Washington (Figure 1). For
results for all states see Appendix 2 and https://idmodresearch.shinyapps.io/industry_state/.

After summing the four factors of workplace size, human interactions, inability to work from home, and
industry size, in both California and Washington, the industries with the highest transmission risk index
were (1) accommodation and food services, (2) retail trade, and (3) healthcare and social assistance
(Figure 2). For results for all states see Appendix 2 and
https://idmodresearch.shinyapps.io/industry_state/.

Figure 2. Total transmission risk index calculated as a sum of contributions from four factors in California and Washington. The
four factors are: (1) workplace size: normalized number of employees per individual workplace in each industry, (2) interactions:
normalized number of human interactions that would re-start if industry was reopened, (3) inability to work from home: percent
of jobs that cannot be done from home in each industry, and (4) industry size: normalized number of employees in each industry
in Washington. The largest transmission risk index was found in accommodation and food services.

In examining economic impact and transmission risk simultaneously for reopening purposes, we should
target industries for reopening that have a high economic impact and low transmission risk. In terms of
tradeoffs of economic losses from the shutdown versus the health risk of reopening, industries toward
the top left of the Figure 3 would have the most economic gain for minimum health risk. The industry
with the highest economic impact per unit of transmission risk was wholesale trade in California and
manufacturing in Washington (Figure 3).

the largest transmission risk index was accommodation and food services in 41 states; retail trade in five
states (CT, ME, NH, NJ, and UT); healthcare and social assistance in three states (ND, SD, and VT); and
manufacturing and educational services each in one state (IN and IA, respectively) (Figure 4, top right).
Finally, we found that the industry with the highest economic impact per unit of transmission risk was
manufacturing in 37 states; wholesale trade in ten states (AZ, CA, CO, CT, FL, MA, MD, NJ, NY, and RI);
accommodation and food services in two states (HI and NV); and construction and other services each in
one state (AK and DC, respectively) (Figure 4, bottom left). These can be interpreted to have the highest
value of reopening.

Discussion
While reopening states and returning individual livelihoods to the millions of unemployed Americans is
of key importance, it must be done in balance to limit further spread of COVID-19, which has claimed
over 100,000 American lives, sickened nearly 2 million, and ravaged healthcare systems across the US. In
estimating the economic impact due to COVID-19 alongside the relative transmission risk in each
industry by state, we find that the manufacturing industry would be a good target for early reopening in
the majority of states. This is driven by the high economic impact of reopening this industry with

relatively lower COVID-19 transmission risk. However, it is important to note that high reopening value
does not necessarily imply low transmission risk. Indeed, in Nevada, Hawaii, and Indiana, the industry
with the highest value for reopening also has the highest transmission risk index. For this reason, each
state must weigh priorities carefully in establishing reopening strategies.
Use of transmission mitigation strategies will be essential to ensure a safe reopening of the economy
and determine industry reopening readiness. Due to the nature of the industry, accommodation and
food services, for example, presents the highest transmission risk in most states. This risk, however, may
be mitigated though strategies such as capping seating capacity and robust personal hygiene, in which
case restaurants would be a key target for early reopening. Furthermore, the mitigation tactics – and the
ease to which they are implemented and enforced – will need to be thoughtfully considered, as they will
vary significantly between- and within-industries. For instance, within the arts, entertainment, and
recreation industry, social distancing may be appropriate for both movie theaters and indoor concert
venues but it might only be enforceable in the movie theater setting. This may indicate that movie
theaters are a target for early reopening but that concert venues remain closed for the time being.
Similarly, transmission risk is likely lower in large manufacturing facilities where employees have little
interaction with each other or those that take place outdoors compared to smaller or indoor operations.
The healthcare industry has high economic impact and high transmission risk in several states and
should be given careful consideration for several reasons. First, the industry is essential, so it has not
been fully closed. Instead, we consider reopening of the health care industry to mean restarting nonemergent and elective care. We must consider transmission risk more carefully in this population: On
one hand, healthcare settings may have increased transmission risk due to likelihood of interactions
with infected people; on the other, they are best equipped to prevent the spread of infections (both in
training and in personal protective equipment) and have frequent testing and symptom screening of
healthcare employees.
Similarly, we must give careful thought to the education industry. First, for most settings within
education, economic gain may not be the primary goal. This analysis does not incorporate the future
effects of limited or lower quality education due to shelter-in-place policies. Additionally, our analysis is
based on data assuming that teachers can work from home, which may not be the case for effective
education, particularly for young children. We also do not consider the disproportionate effects of
closing schools on marginalized and vulnerable populations independently, or the effects on other
industries of parents having limited childcare options during work hours, which is a limitation of this
approach (17–19). For these reasons, we recommend that education not be directly compared to other
industries, and instead be given special consideration for reopening purposes. Routine COVID-19 testing
(weekly, or even semiweekly) and frequent symptom screening may help schools reopen safely; but
cheaper PCR tests or pooling of specimens may have to be implemented in the face of limited resources
in schools.
This work is meant to inform initial discussions regarding the reopening of industries. While it
illuminates high-level industry economic impacts and transmission risks, there are a host of other
considerations vital to the policymaking processes. Questions remain regarding the social, cultural, and
mental health impacts of industry closures that may outweigh risks of reopening. Data is newly surfacing
on how the shutdown has disproportionately affected communities of varying socio-economic status.
We need to understand this better and ensure that burden relief reaches the most affected. These,

among many other, questions and considerations need to be a part of the process with which
policymakers develop policy and redefine the road back to an open economy. Our work emphasizes that
the reopening of states should not be done in haste, nor should it be motivated by political agenda. We
can and should use data-driven approaches to control this unprecedented public health risk. Lives are at
stake, both due to COVID-19 disease itself and dire economic consequences for millions of Americans.
Researchers and decision makers must work together to consider both health and economics when
making tough decisions.
