Abstract
Background: From the start of the pandemic, health-care workers (HCW) have paid a heavy toll to the
coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak.
Objectives: To describe the dynamics and determinants of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in HCW.
Design: Prospective observational study conducted from February 24th until April 10th, 2020.
Setting: Comparison of a 1,500-bed adult and a 600-bed pediatric setting of a tertiary-care university
hospital located in central Paris.
Participants: All symptomatic HCW screened for SARS-CoV-2 on a nasopharyngeal swab.
Measurements: HCW screened positive were prospectively questioned on their profession, symptoms,
occupational and non-occupational exposures to SARS-CoV-2.
Results: Among 1344 symptomatic HCW tested, 373 were positive (28%) and 336 (90%) corresponding
questionnaires were completed. Three hospitalizations and no death were reported. Most HCW (70%)
had patient-facing occupational activities (22% in COVID-19 dedicated units). The total number of
HCW cases peaked on March 23rd, then decreased slowly, concomitantly with a continuous increase of
compliance to preventive measures (including universal medical masking and personal protective
equipment (PPE) for direct care to COVID-19 patients). Attack rates were of 3.2% and 2.3% in the adult
and pediatric setting, respectively (p=0.0022). In the adult setting, HCW more frequently reported
exposure to COVID-19 patients without PPE (25% versus 15%, p=0.046). Report of contacts with
children attending out-of-home care facilities dramatically decreased over the study period.
Limitations: Lack of COVID-19 negative controls and recall bias.
Conclusion: Universal masking, reinforcement of hand hygiene, and PPE with medical masks for
patients’ care allowed protection of HCW and containment of the outbreak. Residual transmissions were
related to persistent exposures with undiagnosed patients or colleagues and not to contacts with children
attending out-of-home care facilities.

Introduction
From the very start of the pandemic, health-care workers (HCW) have been particularly exposed to
nosocomial transmissions of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of
February 11th, 2020, China reported more than 1,700 infected HCW in Hubei alone (1), contributing to
3.8% of total coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) cases, and at least 23 had died (2). Occupational
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to HCW was lately reported in other countries as in the United Kingdom
(UK)(3,4) and the United States (US) (5).
Front-line HCW already paid a heavy price to previous Coronavirus outbreaks. During the 2003 SARS
epidemic in Singapore, the index patient started off a chain of nosocomial cases resulting in transmission
to 60 HCW, with attack rates of up to 32% for ward-based staff (6). Thus, nosocomial transmissions
have been recognized as an important amplifier in Coronavirus epidemics. Cross-transmissions both
drive a shortage of HCWs who are isolated once infected and raise anxiety and fear among hospital
staff. This cascading effect further contributes to saturation of the health care system.
Protection of HCW is therefore a key concern. As the pandemic declared then accelerated, knowledge
on ways of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also advanced. Epidemiological data and temporal patterns of
viral shedding now suggest that infectiousness starts from two days before symptom onset and declines
quickly within seven days (7), at least in immunocompetent individuals. The virus mainly spreads by
droplets transmission and may survive on surfaces up to 72 hours (8). Most national and international
guidelines recommend that HCW in contact with COVID-19 patients should wear personal protective
equipment (PPE) that includes gowns, gloves, eye protections, medical masks for standard care and
FFP2 during aerosol-generating procedures (9–13).
In France, the first imported case of COVID-19 was detected on January 24th, 2020 in a 31-year-old
Chinese male tourist from Wuhan (14). By February 29th, 2020, a month since the notification of the

for direct care for COVID patients, universal masking was recommended for all hospital employees.

Symptomatic staff were recommended systematic screening for SARS-CoV-2 and prompted to stay
isolated at home for seven days when proven positive. Nevertheless, as of April 20th, 4,180 professionals
were infected in the hospitals of the Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP, the largest French
hospital institution, accounting for about 100,000 employees [http://www.aphp.fr]). Questions raised on
the routes of transmission explaining these persistent contaminations and on the respective role of inhospital and out-hospital exposures. Indeed, targeting effective strategies to curtail the epidemic among
HCW relies on a preliminary assessment of residual sources of transmissions. Here, we describe the
spread of the COVID-19 outbreak among HCW of two settings of the AP-HP (one mainly caring for
children and the other adults) and compared their occupational and non-occupational exposures to
SARS-CoV-2.

Material and method

Setting
The study was conducted in two settings of the 2,100-bed tertiary-care university hospital (AP-HP.
Centre, Université de Paris) located in central Paris, France. Cochin-Broca (“Adult setting”) is a 1,500bed healthcare setting that includes acute care, rehabilitation and long-term units mainly caring for adult
patients, except for a neonatology unit (63 beds) linked to the obstetrical ward. Necker (“Children
setting”) is mainly dedicated to children care (436 beds), and additionally includes five medical wards
(150 beds) caring for immunocompromised adults (hematology, infectious diseases and nephrologykidney-transplantation) along with an obstetrical unit and an intensive care unit (ICU). Both settings
include medical, surgical, obstetrical and intensive care units qualified to provide care to COVID-19
patients. As of March 10th, 2020, 7,916 and 5,362 employees were regularly working in the Adult and
Children setting respectively. Triage and management of COVID-19 patients were comparable in both
settings. All patients with either clinical and/or thoracic computed tomography findings consistent with
a COVID19 infection were screened on a nasopharyngeal swab or a respiratory invasive sample on
admission. Patients screened positive were referred to dedicated wards with dedicated trained personnel.

Participants and interventions
Social distancing strategies were successively implemented by the French Government on March 12th
(school closure) and March 17th (widespread closures, restriction of business and transport). Of note,
schools and nurseries remained opened for children of hospital staff all along the epidemic period.
In health-care settings, from the start of the epidemic in February 2020, PPE was recommended for
HCW caring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. In brief, PPE consisted in gowns, gloves,
eye protections and either medical masks for standard care or FFP2 masks during airway aerosolgenerating procedures. Universal masking with medical masks for all hospital employees was advised
from March 16th in our institutions. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 of symptomatic staff started on February
24th in the Adult setting, and on March 5th in the children setting. In both settings, hospital employees
presenting either with fever (reported or measured >37.8°C), cough, rhinorrhea, muscle pain, shivers,
loss of smell or taste, unusual persistent headaches or severe asthenia, were referred to the two on-site
screening pods. Trained medical doctors or nurses collected a nasopharyngeal swab for each
symptomatic staff member. Test results were communicated within 24 hours via a secured email or by
phone. According to the institution policy, staff with positive results were sent home and able to return
to work after seven days (including two days after resolution of any symptoms) if they felt well enough
to do so.

Data
Shortly thereafter, HCW (all hospital employees) with positive results were prospectively contacted by
phone by the clinical research team and invited to participate to the study. After three unsuccessful
attempts, the participant was considered unreachable. During a phone interview, the following data were
collected on a standardized questionnaire: age, gender, profession, symptoms and date of onset, and
exposure to SARS-CoV-2 within the 10 days preceding symptoms onset. The study was basically
designed to assess sources of exposures of HCW and for confidentiality reasons, we did not collect
precise data on past medical history and comorbidities. Exposures were classified as: in-hospital related
to patients’ care (average number of close contacts per day with COVID-19 patients with and without
PPE, compliance to infection prevention and control [IPC] protocols), in-hospital related to other

activities (contacts with colleagues during meal breaks, meetings etc.) and out-hospital (frequentation
of public transports, contacts with household members, especially children kept outside the household).
A contact at a distance <2 meters for >10 minutes was defined as close contact (14).

Virology methods
SARS-CoV-2 was detected in nasopharyngeal samples by amplification of E, RdRp and N genes using
the Allplex Eurobio® reagent as recommended by the manufacturer or the RealStar® rtPCR kit, a triplex
PCR amplifying the viral genome in the E and S genes and an internal control. The result was considered
positive if three out of the three targets were amplified. A control sample was requested if only one or
two target genes were amplified.

Statistical methods
The number of cases was computed on a daily basis. Continuous variables are presented as medians
(interquartile ranges, IQR) and categorical variables as numbers (percentages). Fischer’s exact tests were
used for comparisons of qualitative variables and Mann Whitney’s tests for quantitative variables. All
tests were two-sided with a 0.05 value for significance. For better clarity, mobile means were calculated
and displayed on the graphs. Statistical analyses were performed using the R software (3.3.2, R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Ethics
This study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee for publications of the Cochin university
Hospital (CLEP) (N°: AAA-2020-08012). According to French policy, a non-opposition statement was
obtained for all participants, meaning that all had received written detailed information on the objectives
of the study and were free to request withdrawal of their consent for participation at any time.

publication.

Results
As early as from February 24th to April 10th, 1,344 symptomatic HCW were tested for SARS-CoV-2
over a total of 13,278 employees in both settings (10%, Adult setting [866/7916, 10.9%], Children
setting [478/5,362, 8.9%]). Overall, 373/1,344 (28%) tested positive (Adult setting [251/866, 29%],
Children setting [122/478, 26%]), leading to an overall attack rate of 2.8% (Adult setting [251/7,916,
3.2%], Children setting [122/5,362, 2.3%] p=0.0022). Figure 1 details daily breakdown of SARS-CoV2 testing in the Adult setting (Figure 1A) and in the pediatric setting (Figure 1B). The total number of
cases peaked on March 23rd, 2020 then decreased slowly until April 10th. Patterns were different between
the two settings, and the outbreak appeared to be more intense in the Adult setting, particularly in the
early phase of the epidemic, with a more rapid increase of number of infected HCW. A residual number
of cases was observed in both settings after the peak with similar paces. Figure 1C illustrates the crude
number of daily consultations in emergency departments for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in Paris
during the study period. The epidemic peaked in the general population in Paris on March 31st.
Overall, 336/373 hospital personnel (90%) answered to the phone interview, two refused and 35 were
unreachable. Main characteristics of the participating HCW and their symptoms are presented in Table
1. In both centers, the large majority were women (265/336, 79%), with direct patient-facing activities
(234/336, 70%). Most were posted outside COVID-19 dedicated wards (261/336, 78%). Employees
were younger in the pediatric setting. The most frequently reported symptoms were asthenia and
headaches and 118/336 (35%) did not report any fever or had a body temperature below 38°C. Patients
reporting measured or subjective fever had a median temperature of 38.5°C (minimal 36.2°C, maximal
41.0°C). Three staff members were hospitalized. No death was reported.
Exposures within 10 days prior to onset of symptoms reported by participants are presented in Table 2.
The majority recalled a contact without PPE with an index case. Iterative contacts with patients without
PPE were more frequently reported by hospital staff from the Adult setting (56/227 [25%] versus 16/109

[15%] in Children setting, p=0.046), whereas contact with index cases in the household or with
colleagues were more frequent in the Children setting. Most employees declared wearing a mask
always/most of the time at hospital, but 65/336 (19%) admitted taking off masks during breaks in the
presence of other colleagues (204/336, 61% during lunch breaks). More than half (201/336, 60%)
reported using public transportation but less than 25% (82/334) wore mask outside home. Mean time
spent in public transports was over one hour per day in 56% (112/201). The large majority reported
performing hand hygiene systematically when returning home (303/336, 90%). Forty-seven (14%) had
children aged 0-4 years and 78 (23%) aged 5-15 years in the household. Sixty (18%) reported having
children kept by child careers outside the family home: 42 at school (70%), 18 at nursery (30%), and 9
(15%) by other persons (grandparents, neighbors). The large majority (54/60, 92%), were in childcare
facilities welcoming more than five children simultaneously. Although not precisely assessed, several
cases were retrospectively linked to clusters of contaminations identified at the Ile de France regional
level among HCW who attended social events that took place before implementation of social distancing
measures.
We carried out a second analysis, focusing on HCW with direct patient facing activities (n=234),
comparing those caring for adults to those caring for pediatric patients, regardless of the geographic
location. Overall, 169 HCW were posted in adult units (either from the Adult setting [n=160] or from
the Children setting [n=9]) and 65 in pediatric units (1 from the neonatology ward of the Adult setting
and 64 from various medical and surgical wards of the Children setting). Results are detailed in the
Supplementary Appendix. The proportion of HCW reporting contacts with COVID-19 patients without
PPE was even higher (35% in adult staff versus 13% in pediatric staff, p=0.00060).
Figure 2 presents the dynamics of various exposures reported by positive hospital personnel over time.
Exposure to COVID-19 patients with PPE increased (Figure 2A), in parallel to the rise of COVID-19
patients’ admissions. The rate of HCW reporting contact with COVID-19 patients without PPE was
relatively stable around 20% over the study period (Figure 2B). The number of patients’ admissions was
higher in the Adult setting, consistent with the number of cases reported in adults compared to children
in the general French population (Supplementary Figure). Concomitantly, compliance with mask
wearing increased (Figure 2 C-D), but at the end of the study period, a residual proportion of staff still

reported contacts without PPE with COVID-19 patients and with colleagues without masks. This was
more marked in the Adult setting, where between April 3-10, eight personnel reported contacts with
COVID-19 patients, including four in the same geriatric ward. Mask wearing outside home increased
but capped around 60% as of April 10th (Figure 2E). Conversely, the proportion reporting childcare
outside home fell dramatically over the study period (Figure 2F).

Discussion
This prospective study, implemented in real-time in two tertiary hospital settings (adult and pediatric)
in central Paris, gives new insights on the dynamics and the sources of exposure of SARS-CoV-2
infections in HCW. Despite a significant number of cases reported, very few had severe clinical
presentations. The outbreak in HCW preceded the community epidemic by about one week, and most
cases were reported at the very early phase of the French epidemic, before implementation of collective
mitigation measures. Control measures (universal masking and PPE for direct care to COVID-19
patients) were rapidly adopted in both hospitals, leading to a decrease of new COVID-19 infections in
HCW by late March 2020, while at the same time, the epidemics was still progressing in the community.
A residual number of contaminations was reported as of April 1st among HCW, mainly driven by
contacts with undiagnosed patients or colleagues without protection. Conversely, children attending
community childcare facilities seemed to play a minor role in residual transmissions to HCW that were
observed during the second phase of the epidemic.

Compared to previous studies in China (1), the US (5) and the UK (3,4) on SARS-CoV-2 infections in
HCW, we did a systematic investigation among all staff members infected with COVID-19 and were
able to confront an adult and a pediatric setting. Epidemic curve among HCW was also compared to
hospitalization needs in the general population. Therefore, our data collected from the early beginning
of the French epidemics give an unprecedentedly reported landscape of HCW infection with COVID19. Hospital workers were infected regardless of their profession category and their unit of work,
suggesting that manifold determinants of transmission are involved. Only three participants had severe
forms of COVID-19 and no death were deplored to date. Symptoms were consistent with literature, a

majority of cases reporting headaches, fever, cough, asthenia, rhinorrhea, muscle pains and loss of smell
or taste.

Preventive measures with implementation of universal masking, reinforcement of hands hygiene and
social distancing were applied from March 16th in our two settings. Seven days later, the epidemic curve
flattened, although HCW were increasingly exposed to COVID-19 patients and the outbreak was
concomitantly at its peak in the region Ile-de-France. This shift is consistent with the SARS-CoV-2
incubation interval (7) and data reported elsewhere (3). Our data suggest that when IPC measures are
correctly applied, working in a COVID-19 unit does not appear to ffavorCOVID-19 infection. In
particular, our results support that medical masks for general patient care (out of aerosol-generating
procedures) were efficient to protect HCW and prevent contaminations, which is consistent with most
current guidelines (10,13). This observation provides additional evidence that SARS-Cov-2 is primarily
transmitted via droplets, despite discussion in the scientific literature on the possibility of airborne
transmission, raised by experimental studies led in laboratory conditions (8). Our results support the key
role of universal masking and hand hygiene to offer protection. Lack of compliance of mask wearing
reported by positive HCW during breaks, together with recent data evidencing viral shedding occurring
before symptoms onset (7), also underscore the crucial importance of maintaining physical distancing
rules between hospital employees, even if asymptomatic, during out-of-duty activities.

The attack rate was significantly lower in the pediatric hospital. More COVID-19 patients were admitted
in the Adult setting, but more importantly, compliance with PPE was higher in the Children setting. One
explanation might be the higher awareness and compliance to IPC measures in pediatric setting where
gowns and droplet precautions with medical masks are routinely recommended even out of a pandemic
context (15). Data obtained by others also suggest that compliance to hands hygiene is better in pediatric
wards than in adult’s ones (16).

The role of children in the current pandemic is still widely questioned (17). Children have been initially
suspected to play a central role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, recent data have been more

balanced and their role remains unclear (18). Although early Chinese data suggested that children were
at a similar risk of infection to general population (19), others showed that attack rates in children may
be lower than in adults (20,21). Moreover, in a well-documented cluster of 12 COVID-19 cases in
French Alps, one child was involved. No COVID-19 secondary case from him emerged, although he
attended three different schools and a ski class while symptomatic and whereas other respiratory viruses
like picornaviruses or influenzae viruses spread within his contacts (22). Due to the lockdown, majority
of schools and childcare facilities were closed since March 12th, but few remained open to welcome
HCWs’ children in small groups. This choice raised questions on the risk of maintaining circulation of
the virus among children of HCW, thus exposing them to the infection. Interestingly in our cohort, the
proportion of COVID-19 positive hospital personnel reporting having a child in an out-of-home care
service dramatically decreased all over the epidemic period. Thus, residual contaminations of HCW
observed at the late phase of the epidemic were unlikely attributable to keeping schools and childcare
services open for HCW. This suggests that in case of second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, keeping
children services available for HCW would be acceptable to help asymptomatic hospital staff stay at
work. However, access to these collective structures were restricted to HCW and limited to a very small
number of children, limiting contacts and therefore the risks of transmissions. Thus, this does not
presume on the impact of wide reopening of schools and nurseries after the lift of containment measures.

The main limitation of our study is the lack of a control group (i.e. inclusion of HCW that were not
infected by SARS-Cov-2) to formally compare exposures and assess their respective role in
transmission. Identification of negative controls is nevertheless difficult. Indeed, sensitivity of the rtPCR on nasopharyngeal swabs is imperfect (23), therefore identification of controls only based on a
negative rt-PCR result is questionable. The gold standard to rule out the diagnosis of COVID-19 is
serologic assessment. Performances of these technics are still under investigation in France before large
implementation among HCW. We chose to rapidly communicate timely data in order to guide decisions
in view of the soon upcoming lift of containment measures. Further investigations are on the way to
identify negative controls by serologic assessment and formally compare their exposures to HCW of our
cohort. Another limitation is the recall bias which is inherent to the use of questionnaires in

epidemiological studies, however infected HCW were interrogated prospectively and shortly after PCR
assessment.

Several conclusions can be drawn from our results: (i) HCW are exposed to emerging viral diseases,
particularly at the early phase of the epidemic, as illustrated by the overall attack rate of 2.8% ; (ii)
compliance to control measures increased over the study period, concomitantly with containment of the
outbreak among hospital staff ; (iii) incidence was lower in HCW of the Children setting, likely related
to a better adherence to IPC measures by the pediatric staff and (iv) residual transmissions observed at
the late phase of the epidemic among HCW were related to persistent exposures with undiagnosed
patients or colleagues and not to contacts with children attending out-of-home care facilities.
