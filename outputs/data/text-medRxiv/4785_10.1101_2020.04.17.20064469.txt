Abstract
Background: Glucocorticoids are widely used in the treatment of various pulmonary
inflammatory diseases, but they are also often accompanied by significant adverse
reactions. Published guidelines point out that low dose and short duration systemic
glucocorticoid therapy may be considered for patients with rapidly progressing
COVID-19 while the evidence is still limited.
Methods: We comprehensively searched electronic databases and supplemented the
screening by conducting a manual search. We included RCTs and cohort studies
evaluating the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoids in children and adults with
COVID-19, SARS and MERS, and conducted meta-analyses of the main indicators
that were identified in the studies.
Results: Our search retrieved 23 studies, including one RCT and 22 cohort studies,
with a total of 13,815 patients. In adults with COVID-19, the use of systemic
glucocorticoid did not reduce mortality (RR=2.00, 95% CI: 0.69 to 5.75, I²=90.9%) or
the duration of lung inflammation (WMD=-1 days, 95% CI: -2.91 to 0.91), while a
significant reduction was found in the duration of fever (WMD=-3.23 days, 95% CI:
-3.56 to -2.90). In patients with SARS, glucocorticoids also did not reduce the
mortality (RR=1.52, 95% CI: 0.89 to 2.60, I²=84.6%), duration of fever (WMD=0.82
days, 95% CI: -2.88 to 4.52, I²=97.9%) or duration of lung inflammation absorption

(WMD=0.95 days, 95% CI: -7.57 to 9.48, I²=94.6%). The use of systemic
glucocorticoid therapy prolonged the duration of hospital stay in all patients
(COVID-19, SARS and MERS).
Conclusions: Glucocorticoid therapy was found to reduce the duration of fever, but not
mortality, duration of hospitalization or lung inflammation absorption. Long-term use
of high-dose glucocorticoids increased the risk of adverse reactions such as
coinfections, so routine use of systemic glucocorticoids for patients with COVID-19
cannot be recommend.

Background
An infectious disease caused by a previously unknown type of coronavirus, the
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged at the end of
December 2019 and has posed a major challenge to the public health worldwide (1).
The World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the disease as Corona Virus
Disease 2019 (COVID-19) on February 11, 2020 (2). On March 11, 2020, the WHO
declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic (3). Globally, as of 2:00am CEST, 12 April
2020, there have been 1,699,595 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 106,138
deaths, reported to WHO (4).
At present, there are no specific drugs for the prevention and treatment of
COVID-19, and symptomatic supportive treatment remains the most effective method
of care. Full-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analyses have indicated
SARS-CoV-2 is a distinct clade of beta-coronaviruses, related to the Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Therefore, the management of COVID-19 can
benefit from experience from the SARS and MERS epidemics (5). Glucocorticoids
were commonly used for the treatment of SARS and MERS especially in critically ill
people (6-7), and are also widely used in the treatment of COVID-19.

There are conflicting opinions about the use of glucocorticoids to treat patients
with COVID-19. It is suggested that current clinical evidence does not support the use
of glucocorticoids, which may cause several side effects (8-9). However, clinicians
who are on the front line of the epidemic have proposed that short-term glucocorticoid
therapy with small or medium dose could be beneficial for patients with severe
conditions (10). The current guidelines on COVID-19 are also inconsistent about the
use of glucocorticoids. Some guidelines suggested trying short-term therapy with
medium or small doses of glucocorticoids for patients with rapid or severe disease
progression, but according to the WHO guidelines glucocorticoids should only be used
under clinical trial conditions (11-13). Effective evidence related to glucocorticoids to
treat COVID-19 is still lacking.
Therefore, the purpose of this study is to systematically retrieve and summarize
the current evidence of the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoid therapy for
patients with COVID-19, aiming to provide the best decision-making basis for the
prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic.

Methods
Search strategy
Two experienced librarians searched the following databases from January 1st, 2003 to
March 31th, 2020: The Cochrane library, MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase, Web of

AND ("adrenal cortex hormones" OR " betamethasone valerate " OR "

platforms (the World Health Organization Clinical Trials Registry Platform, US
National Institutes of Health Trials Register and the International Standard
Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) Register), Google Scholar
(https://scholar.google.nl/) and preprint platforms BioRxiv (https://www.biorxiv.org/),
MedRxiv (https://www.medrxiv.org/) and SSRN (https://www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/).
In addition, we searched the reference lists of the identified systematic reviews to find
further potential studies, and supplemented screening Google Scholar by conducting a
manual search every day before submission. The search strategy was constructed with
the assistance of a specialist in information retrieval (15). The details of the search
strategy can be found in the Supplementary Material 1.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
We included all studies on glucocorticoid therapy for patients diagnosed with
COVID-19, SARS or MERS, without restricting the diagnostic criteria. We included

randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies comparing glucocorticoid
therapy versus placebo or comparing a combination of glucocorticoids and
symptomatic treatment with symptomatic treatment alone. The primary outcome of
interest was mortality, and secondary outcomes included duration of lung inflammation
absorption, duration of hospital stay, duration of fever, and other adverse effects like
coinfections (bacterial or fungal infections), kaliopenia, and osteonecrosis of femoral
head (ONFH).
We excluded conference abstracts, articles written in languages other than English or
Chinese and studies where we could not retrieve the full text or essential data were
missing. All the reasons for exclusion of ineligible studies were recorded, and the
process of study selection was documented using a PRISMA flow diagram (14).
Study selection
After eliminating duplicates, two researchers (S Lu and L Huang) independently
screened the literature in two steps using the EndNote software. In the first step, all
titles and abstracts were screened using pre-defined criteria to exclude irrelevant
articles. In the second step, full-texts of the potentially eligible and unclear studies
were reviewed to decide about final inclusion. Disagreements were discussed or solved
with a third researcher (Q Shi). All the reasons for exclusion of ineligible studies were
recorded, and the process of study selection was documented using a PRISMA flow
diagram (16).

Two researchers (S Lu and Q Zhou) independently extracted the data and information
from all included studies by using a standardized data collection form. Extracted data
included 1) basic information: first author, publication year, and the type of study
design; 2) participants: disease, severity of disease, age distribution, and total number
of patients; 3) details of the intervention and control groups: type, dosage and
treatment course of glucocorticoid therapy; and 4) outcomes: for dichotomous data, we
abstracted the number of events and total number of patients per group; and for
continuous data, we abstracted the means, standard deviations (SD), and the total
number of patients per group. For data that were missing or reported in unusable way,
we reported the findings descriptively.
Risk of bias assessment
Two researchers (S Lu and S Zhao) independently assessed the potential bias in each
included study, and discrepancies were resolved by discussion or consulting a third
researcher (Q Shi). We assessed the risk of bias in RCTs using the Cochrane
risk-of-bias tool (17), which consists of seven domains: random sequence generation,
allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome
assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other bias.
Each domain was graded as “Low”, “Unclear”, or “High”. For cohort studies, we used
the

comparability of cohort based on design or analysis, assessment of outcome events,
adequacy of follow-up time, and completeness of follow-up.
Quality of the evidence
Two researchers (Zhou Q and Shi Q) assessed the quality of evidence independently
using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
(GRADE) tool (19-20). We produced a “Summary of Findings” table using the
GRADEpro software. The quality of evidence can be downgraded based on five
factors (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and
publication bias) and upgraded based on three factors (large magnitude of effect,
dose-response relation and plausible confounders or biases) (21-26). The quality of
evidence of each outcome is then classified as “high”, “moderate”, “low” or “very
low”.
Data synthesis
We conducted meta-analyses by using Stata 14 software (Stata Corp LLC). For
dichotomous data, we calculated risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI);
for continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% CI.
Missing data were dealt with according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions (27). As clinical and methodological heterogeneity in study
design, characteristics of participants, interventions and outcome measures was
expected, we used random-effects models (28). Two-sided P values <0.05 were
considered statistically significant. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed with the I²

statistic, >50% indicating substantial heterogeneity. If we detected heterogeneity, we
performed subgroup analyses by the severity of the disease or the age of patients, and
also considered sensitivity analyses where one study was excluded at a time. Egger test
was used to assess publication bias (14). Each comparison is presented by the name of
the first author and the year of publication.
As COVID-19 is a public health emergency of international concern and the situation
is evolving rapidly, our study was not registered in order to speed up the process.

Results
Basic characteristics
The rapid review identified 2509 publications, of which 23 studies (one RCT and 22
cohort studies) (29-51) met our inclusion criteria and were included. The literature
screening process is shown in Figure 1. One study included adult patients with severe
MERS, 17 studies included patients with SARS, and the remaining five studies were
on patients with COVID-19 (Table 1). Due to the insufficient representativeness and
follow-up time, only three articles scored higher than six out of nine points. The
methodological quality of included cohort studies was poor. The risk of bias of
included RCT was unclear because of unclear risks of selection bias, detection bias and
reporting bias (Table 2, Table 3).

Meta-analyses
Mortality was assessed in thirteen cohort studies (four on COVID-19, eight on SARS,

one on severe MERS) (29-41) with a total of 11,211 patients. The use of systemic
glucocorticoid did not reduce the risk of death in COVID-19 (RR=2.0, 95% CI: 0.7 to
5.8, I²=90.9%) or SARS patients (RR=1.5, 95% CI: 0.9 to 2.6, I²=84.6%). Subgroup
analyses showed that glucocorticoids also did not reduce the risk of death in severe
cases of SARS (RR=1.3, 95% CI: 0.5 to 3.3, I²=67.4%) or in adults (RR=1.1, 95% CI:
0.7 to 1.8, I²=68.7%). In mild cases of SARS glucocorticoids even increased the risk of
death (RR=3.6, 95% CI: 1.9 to 6.9). In adult patients with MERS, the use of
glucocorticoid increased mortality (RR=1.3, 95% CI: 1.1 to 1.5) (Figure 2, Figure 3,
Figure 4).
Five cohort studies with a total of 4709 patients assessed the duration of fever in
COVID-19 (one study) and SARS (four studies) patients (30,32,35,40,42). The
duration of fever was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients who received
glucocorticoid treatment than in patients who received no glucocorticoid treatment
(WMD=-3.2 d, 95% CI: -3.6 to -2.9), while for SARS patients there was no difference
(WMD=0.8 d, 95% CI: -2.9 to 4.5, I²=97.9%). Subgroup analysis showed that
glucocorticoid use did not shorten the duration of fever neither in patients with severe
SARS (WMD=-1.1 d, 95% CI: -4.9 to 2.7, I²=58.3%) nor in patients with mild SARS
(WMD=0.5 d, 95% CI: -4.2 to 5.1, I²=95.1%) (Figure 5, Figure 6).
Three cohort studies assessed the duration of lung inflammation absorption in patients
with COVID-19 (one study) and SARS (two studies) (30,42,43). No difference
between patients who received or did not receive glucocorticoid treatment was found

in neither COVID-19 (WMD=-1.0 d, 95% CI: -2.9 to 0.9) nor SARS (WMD=1.0 d, 95%
CI: -7.6 to 9.5, I²=94.6%) patients. Subgroup analyses showed that using
glucocorticoids did not shorten the absorption time of lung inflammation in patients
with severe SARS regardless of severity (WMD=0.4 d, 95%CI: -4.2 to 5.1, I²=0%), or
with mild SARS (WMD=1.3 d, 95%CI:-8.7 to 11.3, I²=95.5%) (Figure 7, Figure 8).
Five cohort studies (one on COVID-19, three on SARS, one on severe MERS) with a
total of 5872 patients assessed the duration of hospital stay (29,31,35,37,41). Patients
treated with glucocorticoids stayed longer in the hospital than patients who did not
receive glucocorticoids (COVID-19: WMD=2.4 d, 95%CI: 1.4 to 3.4, I²=0.0%; SARS:
WMD=6.8 d, 95%CI: 1.5 to 12.2, I²=94.2%; MERS: WMD=6.3 d, 95%CI: 2.4 to 10.2)
(Figure 9).
Five cohort studies with a total of 5302 patients assessed the adverse outcomes in
patients with SARS (29, 30, 35, 44, 45). Glucocorticoid use increased the risk of
coinfections (bacterial or fungal) (RR=3.5, 95% CI: 2.3 to 5.3, I²=0%), MODS
(RR=3.9, 95% CI: 2.1 to 6.9), and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
(RR=6.1, 95% CI: 3.2 to 11.5), while no significant association on DIC, hypokalemia,
hypocalcemia and ONFH was found (Figure 10).

Quality of evidence
The quality of evidence on the results on mortality in COVID-19 and SARS studies, of
very low quality, and in MERS studies of low quality (Tables 4-6).

Sensitivity Analysis
Heterogeneity among studies on SARS assessing mortality was significant (I²=84.6%).
Heterogeneity in studies of mortality in SARS patients was reduced to 67.4% in the
subgroup analysis of severe cases, and to 68.7% in the subgroup analysis of adults.
Therefore, disease severity and age are probably the main sources of heterogeneity in
the meta-analysis of mortality. We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the on the SARS
mortality by omitting one study at a time. Two studies had a significant impact on the
results of the meta-analysis (34, 35) (Figure 11). The dosing of glucocorticoids was
different in the study by Yam et al than in other studies, so the high heterogeneity in
the meta-analysis on mortality may be at least partly caused by the different dosing
(34).

Publication Bias
We assessed publication bias was for the eight studies on SARS mortality. The Egger
regression test showed that publication bias was unlikely (P=0.619) (Figure 12).

Discussion
Our study identified direct evidence on the clinical efficacy of glucocorticoid therapy
for five difference outcomes in adults with COVID-19. Evidence of low to very
low-quality showed that glucocorticoid therapy significantly reduced the duration of

fever, but not the risk of death and lung inflammation absorption in patients with
COVID-19 or SARS. In addition, glucocorticoid therapy may even prolong the
duration of hospitalization. Long-term use of high-dose glucocorticoids increased the
risk of adverse reactions such as infections and osteonecrosis. We found
moderate-quality evidence that in patients with mild SARS glucocorticoids may be
associated with a more than three-fold increase in the risk of death.
Systemic glucocorticoids are highly effective anti-inflammatory drugs, but their use
against SARS-CoV-2 infection remains controversial. A case series of children with
COVID-19 in Hubei reported that systematic glucocorticoids (dose 2 mg/kg) were
given to both two included critical cases in combination with invasive mechanical
ventilation and intravenous immunoglobulin. In both children, the symptoms on
admission were alleviated, although in one of them only partly (52). A recent cohort
study from JAMA Internal Medicine reported that among COVID-19 patients with
ARDS, treatment with methylprednisolone decreased the risk of death (39). Our results
are compared with published systematic reviews of glucocorticoid therapy for severe
pneumonia. A recent rapid review of COVID-19 treatment showed controversial
evidence on the use of corticosteroids, and could not give any suggestion on the use of
corticosteroids due to the lack of quantitative synthesis (53). A systematic review
covering in vitro studies on SARS, SARS in humans and other diseases such as ARDS,
found that 25 of the 29 included studies were inconclusive, and the remaining four
found glucocorticoids harmful (54). A recent systematic review of influenza

pneumonia showed that glucocorticoid therapy increased the risk of death (RR=1.75,
95% CI: 1.30-2.36), length of ICU stay (RR=2.14 days, 95% CI: 1.17-3.10), and risk
of secondary infections (RR=1.98, 95% CI: 1.04-3.78) (55). A meta-analysis of SARS
in 2017 showed that the incidence of osteonecrosis increased with the dosing of
systemic glucocorticoids, and the summary RR of osteonecrosis was 1.57 (95% CI
1.30–1.89) (56). As retrospective studies have shown that the glucocorticoids were
given for 19% to 26% of patients with COVID-19 (and to 45% of patients with severe
disease), there is a high risk that this therapy is currently misused (57-59). In summary,
the current research evidence does not support the routine use of systemic
glucocorticoids for patients with COVID-19. Because COVID-19 tends to be less
severe in children than in adults (60), the use of systemic glucocorticoids should in
particular not be recommended in children.
Strengths and Limitations
This is to our knowledge the first comprehensive and systematic review of the
effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoid therapy for patients with COVID-19 using
data from the COVID-19 studies, and can be considered at the moment as the best
evidence for decision-making on this topic. We conducted meta-analyses to
quantitatively synthesize the findings of the included studies and objectively evaluate
the current research evidence. Our study had also several limitations. We found only
limited direct evidence of systemic glucocorticoids therapy for COVID-19, and had to

subgroup analyses according to the dose and type of glucocorticoids because of the
small number of studies.

Conclusions
In conclusion, glucocorticoid therapy may increase the risk of death in patients with
coronavirus infections who have mild symptoms. We found no association between
glucocorticoids and mortality in patients with severe symptoms. In the context of
clinical trials, low dose systemic glucocorticoid therapy for a short duration may be
acceptable.
