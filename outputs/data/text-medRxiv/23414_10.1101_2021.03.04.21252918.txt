Abstract

25

26

Background: Recent evidence suggests that willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 has

27

been declining throughout the pandemic and is low among ethnic minority groups.

28

Methods: Observational study using a nationally representative longitudinal sample (N

29

=7,840) from the Understanding America Study (UAS). Changes in the percentage of

30

respondents willing to vaccinate, undecided, or intending to refuse a COVID-19 vaccine were

31

examined over 20 survey waves from April 1 2020 to February 15 2021.

32

Results: After a sharp decline in willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 between April

33

and October 2020 (from 74.0% to 52.7%), willingness to vaccinate increased by 8.1% (p

34

<.001) to 60.8% between October 2020 and February 2021. A significant increase in

35

willingness to vaccinate was observed across all demographic groups examined and Black

36

(15.6% increase) and Hispanic participants (12.1% increase) showed particularly large

37

changes.

38

Conclusions: Willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 increased in the US from October

39

2020 to February 2021.

1. Introduction

49

As of February 28, 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic had led to over 2.6 million deaths

50

worldwide including over half a million deaths in the United States.1 Since the beginning of

51

the pandemic on March 11, 2020, governments across the globe have enacted stringent

52

lockdown and distancing restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. As a result, the

53

pandemic has been linked to adverse societal outcomes including reduced national economic

54

output, declines in population mental health, and disruption to the provision of healthcare.2,3

55

In this context, the rapid development of effective vaccines against COVID-19 offers a path

56

towards population immunity and a return to normal life.

57

Simulation studies suggest three quarters of the population may need to be vaccinated

58

to achieve herd immunity.4 However, recent large-scale reviews indicate that willingness to

59

vaccinate has been declining throughout the pandemic and may be insufficient to ensure

60

widespread vaccination.5,6 For instance, in the U.S. approximately half of adults indicated

61

they were willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in October 2020, down from over

62

70% in April, 2020.7

63

By mid-November 2020, results of the Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 vaccine Phase 3

64

clinical trial were announced suggesting the vaccine was well tolerated and 95% effective

65

against the virus.8 The Pfizer-Biontech vaccine was subsequently approved by the U.S. FDA

66

for emergency use. This was followed by approval of two additional COVID-19 vaccines by

67

companies Moderna and Johnson & Johnson in December 2020 and February 2021

68

respectively.9,10 As of February 28, 2021, nations around the globe were accelerating their

69

vaccination programmes led by Israel where over 90% of the population have received at

70

least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.11

The widely publicized emergence of safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19

71

72

and the high-profile early successes of mass rollout programmes may have prompted an

73

increase in willingness to vaccinate. To evaluate this possibility, this research examined the

74

percentage of the U.S. population willing to vaccinate against COVID-19 across 20 waves of

75

the Understanding America Study (UAS), a nationally representative longitudinal study of

76

U.S. adults tracked continuously throughout the pandemic. Given concerns about high levels

77

of vaccine hesitancy among ethnic minority groups in the U.S. and elsewhere5,12,13 this study

78

also aimed to ascertain whether willingness to vaccinate has increased among Black and

79

Hispanic groups in recent months.

Methods

81
82

2.1. Study design and participants

83

Participants were drawn from the Understanding America Study, a probability-based

84

nationally representative internet-panel of U.S. adults aged 18 and over. The sample was

85

recruited via address-based sampling from the US postal addresses and participants without

86

internet access were provided with internet-connected tablet computers. Details of the UAS

87

survey administration and sampling methodology can found elsewhere .14,15

88

In this study, 8547 eligible UAS participants were invited to take part in biweekly

89

surveys throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 7,840 participants provided 120,903

90

survey responses (15.4 surveys on average) across 20 waves of data collection conducted

91

between April 1 2020 and February 15 2021. Participants were assigned a specific day over

92

the course of each two-week survey period to complete the survey providing a continuous

93

account of willingness to vaccinate over this period. The number of participants included in

94

each survey wave and the dates of data collection can be seen in Table S1. The UAS was

approved by the University of Southern California human subjects committee internal review

board (IRB) and informed consent was obtained from all subjects.

97

2.2.

Measures

99

In each wave of the survey participants were asked how likely they were to get vaccinated

100

against the coronavirus once a vaccine is available. Responses were categorized as either: (1)

101

undecided (responses of ‘unsure’), (2) unwilling to vaccinate (responses of somewhat or very

102

unlikely to vaccinate), or (3) willing to vaccinate (responses of somewhat or very likely to

103

vaccinate). From December 23 2020 participants were asked if they had received a COVID-

104

19 vaccine. Those who indicated they had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine

105

were included in the willing to vaccinate group.

106

107

108

109

Trends in willingness to vaccinate were examined across a set of demographic
subgroups based on participant age (18-39, 40-59, ≥60 years), sex (male, female),
race/ethnicity (White, Hispanic, Black, Other race/ethnicity), college degree (vs. none),
household income (≤$50,00, ≥$50,000 per annum), and chronic health conditions (present vs

110

not present). To assess the presence of chronic health conditions participants indicated

111

whether they had been diagnosed with the following conditions: diabetes, cancer, heart

112

disease, kidney disease, asthma, chronic lung disease, an autoimmune disease.

113

2.3. Statistical analysis

114

National trends in the public’s willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 were examined

115

across 20 waves of the UAS conducted between April 1 2020 and February 15 2021.

116

Multinomial logistic regression analysis with cluster robust standard errors were first

117

conducted. The Stata margins postestimation command was then used to estimate changes in

118

the predicted probabilities that participants were willing to vaccinate, undecided, or unwilling

119

to vaccinate at each time-point. Predicted probabilities were multiplied by 100 to represent

120

percentage point changes.

121

Our initial analyses confirmed that willingness to vaccinate declined from April to

122

October 2020 and increased after this point (see Figure 1). We therefore focused our in-depth

123

analysis of trends in willingness to vaccinate by demographic groups on changes from April

124

1-14 to the September 30-October 13 wave (hereafter October 2020) and between this point

125

and the January 20-February 15 2021 survey wave (hereafter February 2021). All analyses

126

were adjusted for demographic characteristics and incorporated the UAS sampling weights to

127

adjust for unequal probabilities of selection into the survey and align each survey wave with

128

the distribution of demographic characteristics of the US population.16

129

3. Results

130

3.1. Sample characteristics

131

Sample characteristics are displayed in Table 1. The participants were aged 48.8 (SD =16.6)

132

years on average, 51.5% were female and 66% were White, 16.2% Hispanic, 11.9% Black,

133

and 6% Other race/ethnicity and 33.9% reported being diagnosed with a chronic health

134

condition. On average across all time-points examined 59.5% of the sample indicated they

135

were willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine when available, 12.4% of participants

136

indicated they were undecided, and 28.1% indicated they were unwilling accept the vaccine.

137

3.2. National trends in willingness to vaccinate

138

Trends in vaccination intentions between April 2020 and February 2021 are shown in Figure

139

1. There was a large drop in the percentage of participants willing to accept the vaccine from

140

73.8% at the beginning of April to 52.8% October 2020 that was observed in the overall

141

sample and across the demographic subgroups examined (see Table 2). At this point

142

willingness to vaccinate was lowest among Black participants (47.1%). From October 2020

143

willingness to vaccinate increased and 60.9% of adults were willing be vaccinated by

144

February 2021. This group included 10.5% of participants who reported having received at

145

least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by the February 2021 survey wave of the UAS.

146

In February 2021 29% of participants indicated they were unwilling to accept the

147

COVID-19 vaccine and this figure was particularly high among young adults, Black

148

participants, those without chronic conditions and lower income and education groups (see

149

Table 2).

150

3.3. Regression analyses of changes in willingness to vaccinate between April 2020 and

151

February 2021

152

Marginal effects computed from a multinomial logistic regression confirmed that the

153

percentage of participants willing to accept the vaccine declined significantly by 21.3% (95%

154

CI[19.4, 23.3], p<.001) from 74% to 52.7% between April and October 2020. This significant

155

decline was observed across demographic subgroups (see Table 3) and was explained by an

156

increase in the percentage of participants reporting they are undecided (4.7% increase, 95%

157

CI[3.1, 6.3], p<.001) or would refuse the COVID-19 vaccine (16.6% increase, 95% CI[14.8,

158

18.4], p<.001).

159

Intentions to vaccinate increased significantly by 8.1% (95% CI[6.3, 9.9], p<.001)

160

from 52.7% to 60.8% between October 2020 and February 2021 (see Table 3). This was

161

explained by a 4.9% (95% CI[3.5, 6.2], p<.001) decrease in the percentage of participants

162

indicating they were undecided about accepting the COVID-19 vaccine and a 3.2% (95%

163

CI[1.5, 5.0], p<.001) decline in the proportion of the population indicating they would refuse

164

the vaccine from October 2020 to February 2021 (Table 3).

165

Our regression analyses showed statistically significant increases in intentions to

166

vaccinate between October 2020 and February 2021 for all demographic groups examined

167

(Table 3). Over this period the largest increases in willingness to vaccinate were found

168

among Black (15.6% increase, 95% CI[9.6, 21.7], p<.001) and Hispanic participants (12.1%

169

increase, 95% CI[6.2, 17.9], p<.001). Those aged 40-59 years (10.5% increase, 95% CI[7.5,

170

13.4], p<.001), those with chronic health conditions (10.0% increase, 95% CI[7.0, 13.0],

171

p<.001), and females (9.7% increase, 95% CI[7.2, 12.1], p<.001) also showed relatively large

172

increases in willingness to vaccinate, as shown in Table 3.

173

4. Discussion

174

This is the first nationally representative study to show a longitudinal increase in willingness

175

to vaccinate since the emergence of evidence for the safety and efficacy of COVID-19

176

vaccines. After a rapid decline in intentions to vaccinate early in the pandemic,5-7 willingness

177

to vaccinate increased by over eight percentage points from 52.7% to 60.8% among U.S.

178

adults between October 2020 and February 2021. This was driven by a decline in the

179

percentage of participants reporting being undecided about vaccination and a decrease in the

180

percentage reporting they are unwilling to vaccinate. This trend is congruent with the findings

181

of a recent U.S. study that used repeated cross-sectional surveys to show a decline in

182

intentions to refuse the COVID-19 vaccine among priority groups between September and

183

December 2020.17

184

A significant increase in willingness to vaccinate was observed across all

185

demographic groups and was most pronounced among Black (15.6%) and Hispanic (12.1%)

186

participants. This increase is important because COVID-19 vaccine acceptance has been

187

particularly low among Black and Hispanic groups who are known to experience a

188

disproportionate burden of severe illness and death due to COVID-19.5,12,18 As such,

189

achieving a high levels of vaccine uptake among ethnic minority groups is crucial to reduce

190

racial inequalities in disease outcomes due to COVID-19. However, despite the gains seen in

191

recent months vaccine acceptance remained under 50% in Black participants in February

192

2021 and just above 60% in the overall sample. Furthermore, approximately one in three

193

Black participants explicitly reported they will not be vaccinated (vaccine refusal) and this

194

figure was similarly high among other population sub-groups (e.g. young adults, lower

195

income and education groups). For this reason, public health messaging needs to continue to

196

communicate the safety, efficacy and necessity of COVID-19 vaccines and to build trust in

197

vaccines, particularly among Black populations.12,19

198

Understanding the drivers of changes in vaccination acceptance will now be critical in

199

shedding light on beliefs and concerns that could be targeted to promote vaccination uptake

200

and reduce loss of life due to the virus.18 Recent evidence suggests that there has been a

201

decline in concern about the speed at which COVID-19 vaccines have been developed

202

suggesting that the U.S. population has been at least partly assured that the science

203

underpinning the vaccines and the vaccine approval process has not been rushed.17,19

204

However, public concerns about the safety and long-term health effects of the vaccine

205

remain. For this reason, further effort needs to be invested in conveying accurate safety

206

information through trusted sources (e.g. community groups, faith leaders, GPs) and tackling

207

vaccine misinformation.11,19-20

208

The current study adds to the existing literature by examining national trends in

209

willingness to vaccinate in a large-scale nationally representative sample of adults tracked

210

continuously throughout the pandemic. However, the UAS is limited in that the survey is

211

administered to community dwelling adults in English and Spanish only and is accessible

212

only to those willing to engage with online surveys. This study is also limited in its reliance

213

on measures of intentions to vaccinate and reported vaccination behavior.

214

In conclusion, this longitudinal nationally representative study found that willingness

215

to vaccinate against COVID-19 has increased in the US from October 2020 to February 2021

216

and this increase has been largest in Black and Hispanic populations. However, almost 30%

217

of the US population still intend not to be vaccinated and continued efforts to improve

218

vaccine uptake are needed.
