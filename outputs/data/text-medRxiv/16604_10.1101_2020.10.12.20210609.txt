Abstract

24
25

Current commercially available methods for reliably detecting antibodies against

26

SARS-CoV-2 remain expensive and inaccessible due to the need for whole blood

27

collection by highly trained phlebotomists using personal protective equipment (PPE). We

28

evaluated an antibody detection approach utilizing the OraSure® Technologies’ Oral

29

Antibody Collection Device (OACD) and their proprietary SARS-CoV-2 total antibody

30

detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that the OraSure®

31

test for total antibody detection in oral fluid had comparable sensitivity and specificity to

32

serum-based ELISAs while presenting a more affordable and accessible system with the

33

potential for self-collection.

Introduction

37

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on populations and economies

38

worldwide (1). While the relationship between antibodies and their protective role against

39

reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 is under investigation, it has been shown that antibodies

40

consistently develop as part of the immune response against the virus in some, if not

41

most, infected individuals (2). Neutralizing antibodies were effective and sustained for at

42

least two and potentially up to twelve years against SARS-CoV, the first SARS

43

coronavirus, strongly suggesting the potential for significant immunity conferred by

44

antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and prompting extensive studies to identify neutralizing

45

antibodies for therapeutic development (3,4). Further, although residues of the receptor

46

binding domains (RBD) of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 differ by about 55% (18/33), it

47

has been shown that neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV are reactive against

48

SARS-CoV-2. This response indicates overlapping epitopes as the target of these

49

neutralizing antibodies, confirming similarity between antibodies developed against the

50

two SARS-CoVs and supporting the hypothesis of antibody efficacy against re-infection

51

by SARS-CoV-2 (5).

52

Since the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019, individuals infected by the virus

53

have remained immune against re-infection in all but a few sporadic cases. Even in those

54

patients, it is still not clear whether it was a case of re-infection or re-activation of the

55

virus, suggesting that individuals who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 seem to have

56

at least some transient, temporal immunity (6). Given those findings, we have ample

57

reason to believe that the monitoring of antibodies is crucial to understanding global

58

disease spread, immunity against re-infection by the virus, and the effectiveness of

59

potential vaccine candidates.

60

The industry standard for antibody detection relies on the collection and analysis

61

of patient serum, requiring trained phlebotomists to draw the whole blood from a patient

62

following suspected viral infection (7). That process is time-consuming, costly, and

63

potentially hazardous to the phlebotomist. There is also a substantial need to protect

64

phlebotomists with personal protective equipment (PPEs) such as K95 masks, face

65

shields, gloves etc. that have had limited availability during the pandemic (8). In addition

66

to the health concerns, the requirement of a phlebotomist is a bottleneck for patient blood

67

collection which prevents easy antibody testing for widespread monitoring. Thus, a non-

68

invasive technology for self-collection is needed to improve access to antibody testing.

69

We have previously demonstrated that patient saliva, instead of serum, can serve

70

as a sufficient medium for the detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (9). However,

71

given the substantial need for sensitive and specific antibody detection, we did not feel

72

that our method of collection was adequately sensitive for practical manufacturing and

73

mass production for widespread testing. This led us to a collaboration with OraSure®

74

Technologies, who have previously demonstrated the capacity of their Food and Drug

75

Administration-approved OraSure® Oral Antibody Collection Device (OACD) to sample

76

oral fluid antibody against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other pathogens.

77

OraSure® Technologies has adapted the use of this device for better collection of oral

78

specimens and developed an ELISA for detection of antibodies (IgG, IgM, IgA) against

79

SARS-CoV-2 in these specimens (10,11)

Results

82

To determine whether we could adequately detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-

83

2 in oral fluid self-collected under observation using the OraSure® OACD (Schematic 1),

84

we evaluated paired serum and oral fluid from individuals who had undergone SARS-

85

CoV-2 oral fluid molecular RNA testing (Fig. 1A). Participant specimens were collected

86

with informed consent from a diverse population of patients (Fig. 1B). It is important to

87

note that the antibody detection kits presented here do not claim to quantify antibody in

88

the sample but instead aim to provide a binary indicator of antibody presence. Thus, we

89

cannot derive any correlations here between antibody signal and any other factor, but can

90

use the results to determine the presence of an antibody response.

91

From positive participants, serum and oral fluid was collected at least 21 days after

92

the date of reported symptom onset to ensure adequate time for antibody seroconversion

93

(2). We tested participant serum specimens on the EuroImmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (IgG)

94

ELISA (12) to determine whether the participants were expressing antibodies against the

95

virus using previously described methods (9) (Fig. 2A). Paired oral fluid collected using

96

the OraSure® OACD from sixty-nine SARS-CoV-2 RNA- and serum antibody-positive

97

participants and eighty-one SARS-CoV-2 RNA- and serum antibody- negative

98

participants was evaluated on the OraSure® total antibody ELISA. Antibodies were

99

detected in sixty-four (92.8%) of sixty-nine serum antibody positive participant specimens

100

and zero (100% specificity) of eighty-one serum negative participant specimens (Fig. 2B).

101

We further investigated how well the OACD and ELISA performed when monitoring

102

paired specimens collected from the same participants at later time points post-infection.

103

To evaluate this, we selected sixteen out of our original sixty-nine positive participants

104

and collected their paired oral fluid and serum specimens at least 60 days after the original

105

collection date. We found that the oral fluid-based total antibody ELISA from OraSure®

106

Technologies performed with statistical equivelance in comparison to the serum-based

107

IgG antibody ELISA from EuroImmun, with all positive specimens passing the antibody

108

detection cutoff after both 21+ days and 60+ days (Fig 3.)

109

To evaluate the potential time and cost savings of using the OACD for antibody

110

detection instead of traditional serum-based methods, we estimated that a trained

111

phlebotomist operating at a full-capacity drive-thru center can only collect and process

112

blood serum from ~40 patients in a 5-hour period, resulting in collection of one patient

113

specimen per 7.5 minutes. Because oral fluid can potentially be self-collected using the

114

OACD, face-to-face specimen collection time can be eliminated. This dramatically

115

reduces the amount of time needed for each specimen to be collected, leading us to

116

estimate that we can collect devices from ~1,000 patients in a similar drive-thru setting

117

over the same 5-hour period, resulting in collection of one specimen in approximately 0.3

118

minutes. Note that this time does not include the actual time for collection of the sample,

119

which we are assuming individuals would perform while they are waiting in the drive-thru

120

line, thus highlighting the dramatic benefit of self-collected oral samples. This represents

121

approximately a 25-fold increase in sample collection throughput versus traditional blood

122

serum sample collection in the same time frame(Fig. 4).

123

To increase testing capacity and decrease turnaround time for antibody results,

124

we have automated the process for running the OraSure® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total

125

antibody ELISA and will continue evaluating the efficiency and reliability of the test.

Discussion

127

While antibody testing has previously been limited by the requirement of trained

128

personnel for specimen collection, we have evaluated here a technology for non-invasive

129

self-collection which we believe will be able to be scaled up and mass-produced for

130

widespread testing. Based on the test efficacy and time-savings afforded by this method

131

of antibody detection, OraSure® Technologies has developed a more accessible and

132

affordable testing option for patients interested in understanding whether they have been

133

exposed to and developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The simplicity of the OACD

134

allows us to speculate that this will enable specimens to be theoretically self-collected

135

and eliminate the need for a trained medical associate to administer the collection.

136

Oral fluid and mucosal antibodies comprise the first line of defense against a

137

respiratory virus and such antibodies are known to typically contribute to sterilizing

138

immunity by neutralizing the virus prior to infection. This neutralization results in both

139

reduced viral load and impact of subsequent infection(13). The results of this study have

140

demonstrated the persistence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in oral fluid of

141

convalescent humans, indicating the importance of having a widely accessible oral fluid

142

antibody detection system to help determine individual immunity in the population.

143

The OACD, when used with the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody ELISA kit

144

developed by OraSure® Technologies, has achieved sensitivity and specificity which are

145

equivalent to commercially available serum-based ELISAs(9). This represents a unique

146

and highly successful advancement in antibody detection technology. As we move closer

147

to the development and implementation of a successful vaccine against SARS-CoV-2,

148

we need reliable methods for monitoring antibody production on a wide scale and over

time. This antibody detection system allows us to overcome the limitations presented by

150

currently administered serum antibody tests, increasing accessibility to antibody testing

151

and enabling a better understanding of the trends of immune response against this virus

152

over time.

Methods

154

Human serum and oral fluid specimen collection.

155
156

Post-COVID-19 serum and oral fluid specimens

157

Clinical specimens were collected under the UCLA Institutional Review Board (IRB)

158

approved study protocol IRB#20-000703. The UCLA IRB determined the protocol was of

159

minimal risk and that verbal informed consent was sufficient for the research under 45

160

CFR 46.117(c). The study team complied with all UCLA policies and procedures, as well

161

as with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws regarding the protection of human

162

subjects in research as stated in the approved IRB. For this study, we obratined three

163

specimens: oral fluid for viral PCR testing, blood via venipuncture, and one oral fluid

164

specimens for antibody testing.

165
166

Oral fluid swab for viral RNA: This was obtained according to the reported guidelines for

167

Curative’s oral fluid COVID-19 test (14). Briefly, participants coughed hard three times

168

while shielding their cough via mask and/or coughing into the crook of their elbow. They

169

then swabbed the inside of their cheeks, along the top and bottom gums, under the

170

tongue, and finally on the tongue, to gather a sufficient amount of oral fluid. Swabs were

171

placed in a tube containing RNA shield and transported at room temperature before

172

laboratory processing as described. Positive for viral RNA was determined as below 35

173

cycle threshold (CT).

175

Blood sampling: Participants underwent a standard venipuncture procedure. Briefly,

176

licensed phlebotomists collected a maximum of 15ml whole blood into 3 red-top SST

177

tubes (Becton-Dickinson, cat. number 367988). Once collected, the specimen was left at

178

ambient temperature for 30-60 minutes to coagulate and then was centrifuged at 2200-

179

2500 rpm for 15 minutes at room temperature. Specimens were then placed on ice until

180

delivered to the laboratory site where the serum was aliquoted to appropriate volumes for

181

storage at -80 ºC until use.

OraSure® Oral Fluid Specimen Collection: OraSure® Oral Antibody Collection Devices

184

(OACD) (item number 3001-3442-70, OraSure®, USA) were used as instructed(10,15).

185

The pad was brushed briefly on the lower and upper gums and then held between the

186

lower gum and the cheek for 2-5 minutes. The pad was then placed into the storage tube,

187

with the provided storage solution. Specimens were kept on ice until they reached the

188

lab. The specimens were processed as recommended by the manufacturer before being

189

aliquoted and stored at -80°C until use(16).

Serum ELISA

192

EuroImmun’s FDA-approved SARS-CoV-2 (IgG) ELISA for serum (catalog #EI 2606-

193

9620, EuroImmun, New Jersey, USA) targeting spike (S) protein was run according to the

194

manufacturer provided protocol on the Thunderbolt (Gold Standard Diagnostics, Davis,

195

CA) automated instrument (12). Briefly, serum was diluted 1:101 in each well with the

196

provided sample buffer and then incubated at 37ºC for 1 hour. Sample wells were washed

197

three times with a provided wash buffer (10X dilution with ddH2O, 0.35ml per well), before

the provided conjugate solution was added (0.1ml per well) and incubated at 37ºC for 30

199

minutes. After a second wash step, the provided substrate solution was added (0.1ml per

200

well) and incubated at ambient temperature for 30 minutes. The provided stop solution

201

was then added (0.1ml per well) and absorbance of sample wells measured immediately

202

at 450 nm and 630 nm, with output reports generated with optical density (O.D.) at 630nm

203

subtracted from O.D. at 450nm.

204

Data were then analyzed as recommended by the manufacturer and results reported as

205

a ratio (Equation 1). Specimens whose ratio exceeded or was equal to 1.1 were

206

considered positive, while specimens with a ratio greater than 0.8 and less than 1.1 were

207

considered equivocal and specimens with a ratio less than or equal to 0.8 were

208

considered negative. Specimens with ratios in the equivocal range were recommended

209

to be rerun, but this did not apply to any specimens in this study.

serum samples collected from participants who previously tested negative or
positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by an oral-fluid PCR test. The manufacturer
provided positive cutoff value of 1.1 is represented by the dotted line. N.C. =
negative control; P.C. = positive control; S/CO = Specimen/Cutoff Ratio. ROC
analysis of this dataset in serum results in 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity
with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 1. B) Detection of antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2 in paired oral fluid specimens collected using the OraSure®
Technologies OACD from the same participants whose serum was tested. The
manufacturer provided positive cutoff value of 1.0 is represented by the dotted line.
N.C. = negative control; P.C. = positive control; S/CO = Specimen/Cutoff Ratio.
ROC analysis of this dataset in oral fluid reveals 92.75% sensitivity and 100%
specificity with the manufacturer provided cutoff value of 1.0 total antibody units
and an AUC of 0.9965.

Figure 4. Number of antibody specimens which can be
collected in a drive-thru testing center per hour. Oral
fluid specimens (200 per hour) are able to be observed
self-collected using the OraSure® OACD and simply
handed off to a test site employee, while blood serum
specimens (8 per hour) must be collected through direct
contact with a phlebotomist, thus highlighting the
benefit of testing by self-collection.
