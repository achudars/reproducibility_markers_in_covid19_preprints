Abstract:
Background:
An exact correlate of protection (CoP) is not yet known for symptomatic COVID-19.
However, it is still possible to show a new vaccine regimen exceeds an unknown CoP,
provided the regimen shows an equivalent or greater immunological response in all
measured indicators relative to the immunological response elicited by a clinically proven
vaccine regimen. The principle of comparing immunogenicity between regimens is what the
FDA, EMA, and Access Consortium use to authorize modifications to the vaccines for VOC,
without requiring clinical efficacy studies before implementation. It is logical to apply the
same principle to modifying vaccine doses if the data is available to do so. A two dose 30ug
regimen of BNT162b2 has strong clinical evidence of efficacy, as does a single dose 30 ug
regimen. The immunological markers for these regimens have been profiled in detail in
Phase 1 and 2 trial data.
Methods:
The immunological profile (including binding antibodies, viral neutralization, cytokine profiles,
and CD4 and 8 expansion) of the 2 dose 30ug BNT162b2 vaccine is examined, referred to
as a highly conservative CoP estimate. The single dose 30 ug BNT162b2 immunological
profile is also examined, a tenable CoP estimate. Data from the phase 1 and 2 trials are
examined to see if alternate regimens meet or exceed the level of each immune marker
measured, relative to the regimens listed above that have proven clinical efficacy.
Results: For adults aged 19-55, a 2 dose 10ug BNT162b2 regimen elicits a comparable
response to the standard 30 ug dose for each immune indicator, with viral neutralization
nearly an order of magnitude greater than the tenable CoP estimate. Similarly, a single dose
10ug BNT 162b2 regimen or a two dose 1ug BNT 162b2 regimen equals or exceeds the
immunogenicity of a single 30 ug dose.
Conclusion: If it is reasonable for the FDA, EMA, and Access Consortium to approve vaccine
modifications without a clinical trial based on immunogenicity data, three alternate low dose
regimens were identified that meet the requirements of having comparable immunogenicity
relative to a protocol that has proven clinical efficacy. Immediate implementation of these
lower dose regimens should be considered as they have major implications in alleviating
vaccine supply, as well as improving vaccine side effect profile, and lowering total cost of

Background
Vaccine production has been a bottleneck in administering vaccines to increase population
immunity to SARS-Cov-2. Variants of concern (VOC) have also emerged causing both the
vaccine manufacturers and public health organizations to try to prepare for these variants.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicine Agency (EMA), and
ACCESS Consortium have updated their criteria and considerations for authorizing modified
vaccines 123(1, 2, 3). None require further large scale clinical trials as the time taken for such
a study would cause a lengthy delay and undermine the ability to respond to the VOCs.
Instead, all focus on comparable immunogenicity data, especially on ensuring neutralizing
antibody (nAb) and binding antibodies but also acknowledging that cell mediated immunity
may play a role. Authorization is conditional on the fact that the modified vaccines are based
on vaccines on which clinical disease endpoint efficacy study has been conducted. This
authorization process without clinical trials is similar to the process used to authorize annual
influenza vaccines (3).
The two dose efficacy rate of stopping symptomatic COVID was 95% in trial data 4(4), with
reports from Israeli health agencies Maccabi and Cialit reporting similar figures in Israel’s
population 5(5). One dose efficacy of BNT162b2 was 92.6% in the phase 3 clinical trials 14
days after receiving the dose, with multiple sources of data globally confirming a 57-90%
efficacy against symptomatic disease with higher efficacies against severe disease 6789(6, 7,
8, 9). Early data showed lower viral titres in those that do get infected after one dose of
vaccine, which would indicate likely decreased transmission 10(10), and and asymptomatic

infections also appear to be reduced by 4 fold 11(11). Natural immunity post COVID-19 also
appears to be protective against subsequent disease at a 94% efficacy rate 12(12).
Correlates of protection (CoP) for viral immunity can differ based on the virus and can
include binding antibody concentration, viral neutralization titres, a favorable cytokine profile,
a certain level of CD4 or CD8 expansion, immunological memory, or a combination of the
above. The threshold level for protection against asymptomatic infection may be higher that
of symptomatic disease, while the threshold level against severe outcomes may be lower.
An exact correlate of protection (CoP) level is not yet known for any of these outcomes for
SARS-Cov-2. The majority of CoPs for previous diseases protected by vaccines are assays
assessing antibody titres 13(13), so understandably antibody responses have been evaluated
carefully for each vaccine trial. However, raw antibody titres may not be the best correlate of
protection, given that high levels of antibody titres are correlated with severe Covid
presentation 14(14). The type of antibody appears to matter rather than just the overall
amount in response to Covid-19: afucosylated IgG1 antibodies in particular are associated
with severe disease along with Th2 polarization of immune response 15(15). Low antibody
titres are correlated with faster viral clearance (14), perhaps indicating the importance of cell
mediated immunity and Th1 polarization of the immune system. The cytokines elicited by
the mRNA vaccines are most often associated with a polarized Th1 response: IFN gamma,
IL2, and TNF 16(16).
If a specific immune indicator defines a CoP, a new vaccine regimen being evaluated
would need to demonstrate that it exceeds that specific indicator to be effective (antibody
titres being very common). For an undefined CoP, it is still possible to demonstrate a new
vaccine regimen exceeds the CoP, but it would be required to demonstrate an equivalent or
greater immunological response in all the immune indicators considered as candidates in
defining indicator of the unknown CoP, relative to the immunological profile elicited by a
clinically proven vaccine regimen. This is the underlying reason why immunogenicity data is
sometimes used to estimate a CoP when it is not feasible to do the clinical efficacy studies.
In the context of vaccine shortage, fractional low dosing is a strategy used to help
mitigate supply limitations and has been successfully used with a number of vaccines, polio
and yellow fever being two examples. 17(17). Fractional low dosing of vaccines often elicits

an immune response equivalent to a single standard dose, and are most often studied in non
elderly, non-malnourished, healthy subjects. How low of a fractional dose can be given
depends on the vaccine; in the case of yellow fever, doses 50x lower than standard still led
to strong immune protection where doses 100x lower did not. Despite a lower total dose of
vaccine given, the duration of immunity with fractional doses can be comparable to the
standard dose. 18(18)
Methods:
The immunological profile of two vaccine regimens that have proven clinical efficacy data
were evaluated. First, the 2 dose 30ug BNT162b2 profile was examined, including
antibodies, cytokine profiles, and CD4 and 8 expansion. This will be termed a highly
conservative CoP estimate, because the responses seen are nearly an order of magnitude
higher than the single dose profile, which also has shown strong clinical efficacy. The data
was taken from the Phase 1/2 data published in the NEJM (16), a trial based in the USA, as
well as an extended dataset looking at a continuation of antibody response and evaluating
T-cell response, based out of Germany 19(19). The single dose 30 ug BNT162b2
immunological profile was also considered: This will be termed a tenable CoP estimate.
Dosing regimens from the phase 1 and 2 data are examined to see if alternate regimens are
equivalent to the above regimens for each immune marker measured. Only data from the
19-55 year age group was considered.

Results:
Antibody levels and viral neutralization:

Figure 1A shows the extended trial data from Pfizer/BioNTech. The authors noted that
although the S1-antibodies showed a gradual decline (typical post infection or vaccination
after initial proliferation and contraction), the viral neutralization titres stabilized at day 43,
likely indicating selection and affinity maturations for the antibodies (19). The 30ug VNT50 is
comparable to the 10ug titre from days 43 to 85. Both of the 30 ug VNT50s appear to be
larger than 10 ug at day 29, but this is potentially sampling bias, as a similar two fold
difference can be seen between the Germany and USA trials who received 20 ug dosing,
see Fig. 1C.
The S1-specific antibodies are comparable between dosing groups, with Sahin et al
commenting there was “evidence of a dose level-dependent response only between the 1ug
and 10 ug dose levels” and thus not between 10ug and 30ug groups (19). They also
comment that the S1-antibodies strongly correlate with the VNT50. The 30ug and 10 ugs
VNT50s from day 43 to 85 after stabilization appear equivalent. Additionally, the VNT50
levels after 10 and 30 ug doses are nearly an order of magnitude higher than the VNT50 for
a single dose level seen on day 22 for which trial data showed clinical efficacy of 92.6% (4),
which would indicate that even if there could be found a statistically significant difference in
immune markers between at day 29, there is likely to be no clinical significance to that
difference.

Figure 2: Extended trial data from Germany. Neutralization titres are graphed at day 43 to allow for
stabilization of titres. A single dose of BNT162b2 is set as the baseline as a tenable CoP estimate,
with the other data graphed relative to that baseline. The highly conservative CoP estimate is nearly
an order of magnitude higher than the tenable CoP estimate, while convalescent serum levels are in
between. Two doses of 10ug is comparable to the highly conservative CoP estimate, far exceeding
the tenable CoP estimate. A single dose of Pfizer at 10 ug is equivalent to the tenable CoP estimate
and a two dose, 1ug Pfizer regimen exceeds the tenable CoP estimate.

Cytokine profile and Cellular Expansion:
T-cell responses are important to consider as a CoP. The authors comment on the
potential importance of cellular expansion saying “T cells could be relevant in disease control
even in the absence of neutralising antibodies,” as it has been seen that mild and
asymptomatic infection by SARS-Cov-2 have been cleared without seroconversion (19).
There was lots of individual variability when looking at cellular expansion. Sahin et
al. comment that “Seven days after the boost with BNT162b2 at any of the doses, robustly
expanded SARS-CoV-2 S-specific CD4+ T cells were detectable in all 37 participants...for
dose levels ≥10 μg the magnitude of CD4+ T cell responses did not appear to be
dose-dependent” and “the magnitude of the T cell responses varied inter-individually and
showed no clear dose dependency. Even with the lowest dose of 1 μg BNT162b2, most of
the vaccinated participants demonstrated robust expansion of CD4+and CD8+ T cells.” (19)
Despite having lower antibody concentration and viral neutralization titres compared
to 30 ug dosing, 1ug dosing had robust expansion of T-cells. The robustness of T-cell
expansion to low doses was also seen with the closely related BNT162b1, for which the
author’s comment that they “observed no clear dose dependency of the T cell response
strength within the tested dose range (1–50 μg). Even with a dose as low as 1 μg,

mRNA-encoded immunogen stimulation and robust expansion of T cells was accomplished
in most subjects” 20(20).
In summary, the expansion between 10ug and 30ug appears to be equivalent. Cell
expansion with 1ug, if not quite as prominent, is “robust”. It’s important to note that T-cell
responses were not assessed after just one dose of the vaccine for Pfizer. For Moderna, that
data was obtained, and after one dose there is a slight increase of expansion with the
majority of it happening after the second dose 21(21). That is likely the case here as well,
and it would be reasonable to expect that one dose of 30 ug BNT162b2 would have less
T-cell expansion than 2 doses of 1ug, following the trend from Moderna’s data. The T-cell
responses did correlate positively with S1-binding IgG for both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and
the concentration of S1 IgG is higher after two 1ug doses than after a single 30ug dose,
which might be mirrored by cellular expansion (19), see Fig 3.
The cytokine profile for all dosing regimens tested were similar. Expression of IFNg
and IL2 were seen, with barely detectable expression of IL-4: indicating “a TH1 profile and
the absence of a potentially deleterious TH2 immune response” (19).

FDA, EMA, and ACCESS Consortium Requirements for Modified Vaccines:
The FDA and EMA requirements for authorization of vaccine modifications against
VOCs were likely not intended to be used to analyze altered dosing regimens efficacy
against the original virus. Nevertheless, the concepts behind authorization are instructive.
The FDA states that the outlined guidelines were applicable when for the modified
vaccine when “it is not feasible to conduct clinical disease endpoint efficacy studies rapidly
enough to respond to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants that may escape immunity
conferred by prototype vaccines” (1). The modification discussed in this paper is a

modification to dose rather than to structural change. Certainly the original SARS-Cov-2 is a
virus of concern, and the titres elicited by the current vaccine does appear to have good
efficacy against many of the VOC as well, including B117. It is not feasible to repeat another
Phase III trial with the lower dose regimens discussed rapidly enough to respond to the

Reactogenicity and Population Immunity Considerations:
For those aged 19-55, two 10 ug doses appear to equal a highly conservative CoP
estimate, and two 1ug doses appear to exceed the threshold of a tenable CoP estimate.
How that might affect an individual receiving the vaccine and a population vaccinating to
protect against COVID-19 also need to be considered.
On an individual level, it is clear from the safety profile of the data that 10 ug dosing
has a more favorable reactogenicity profile, as illustrated in Fig. 4. In the context of

emerging and spreading VOCs, manufacturers are evaluating boosting with a modified strain
or using a 3rd dose of the original vaccine to help boost immunity. As there is a significant
increase in reactogenicity with the second dose (especially in systemic side effects), it would
be reasonable to expect the reactogenicity of a 3rd dose to be equal or higher than that of
the second dose. The observed decrease in vaccine side effects from using 10 ug doses
instead of 30 ug doses would likely also apply to a 3rd dose, if a 3rd dose will be required.
This is important consideration not only for the individual in the context of missed days of
work after receiving a booster, but also for public health as a unfavorable side effect profile
may increase vaccine hesitancy 22(22).

Figure 4A: A two dose 10ug regimen gives equivalent immunogenicity markers compared to the two
dose 30 ug regimen with an improved side effect profile. All curves are estimates. Vaccine efficacy
against death and hospitalizations appears to be greater than efficacy against symptomatic disease.
4B illustrates a simplified overview of the steps that the immune system takes post vaccination to
prevent disease. Note that the two dose 1ug regimen of BNT162b2 is not plotted on the graph, but
they have an even more favorable reactogenicity curve than 10ug, while inducing robust cellular
expansion with antibody titres just above a single 30 ug dose.

More important than reducing vaccine side effects is protecting the population from
disease. On a population level, using 10ug doses instead of 30ug doses for those aged

19-55 effectively triples the vaccine supply for a large portion of the population. In the
context of vaccine shortage, the effect is enormous, see Fig 5.

Figure 5 shows that tripling the number of vaccine doses by using 10ug doses (instead of 30
ug doses) for adults aged 19-55 would half the time needed to reach maximal population
immunity. Using a two dose 1ug vaccine regimen would speed that process further. For
countries with robust vaccine supply, the administration of vaccine would become the
bottleneck rather than vaccine supply which would limit the gains modelled in Fig. 5. For
countries where scarce vaccine supply is the limit rather than administration, the gains would
be highly significant.

Conclusion:
Fractional dosing of Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 (at 10ug per dose) appear to have
near identical immune stimulation to the higher 30ug standard doses in 19-55 year olds, as
measured by antibodies levels, viral neutralization titres, cytokine release profiles, and CD4
and CD8 expansion. Which one (or multiple) of these markers is the most predictive of
protection and will eventually define the CoP for COVID-19 is unknown, but is not needed to
be known since the 10ug dose appears to be comparable to 30 ug in each of the indicators.
It follows then, that the lower 10ug dose would seem to reach a highly conservative CoP
estimate and pass all of the FDA, EMA, and ACCESS Consortium immunogenicity
requirements for approval for a modified vaccine. Implementation of this dosing regimen
should be considered without further clinical efficacy studies. More antigen being presented

to the immune system does not always equate to higher immunogenicity markers, which
appears to be the case between 10 and 30 ug dosing. This is also seen in COVID-19
recovered patients who increase their VNT50 and antibody titres after one dose of
vaccination, but not after the second 23(23). It is also seen in AstraZeneca’s trial data where
a low dosing regimen led to equivalent if not greater efficacy than standard dosing 24(24).
It may be possible that something beyond what was clinically examined in the trial
data ends up being the CoP, an as of yet unknown mechanism of protection, but it would be
unexpected. The fact that the FDA, EMA, and ACCESS consortium are evaluating
immunogenicity primarily based on viral neutralization and antibody titres as surrogates for
efficacy when considering approving vaccine modifications would indicate that there is no
clear reason to expect an unknown mechanism of protection beyond what has been studied.
Neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses appear to play a role in protection. Non-human
primate (NHP) studies show vaccine elicited nAb titres correlate with protection, and that the
correlation was stronger when combined with diverse Fc functional antibody response
2526
(25, 26). Other studies have shown that mild COVID-19 recovered individuals have low
nAbs, but robust T-cell response with memory T-cells that could protect against future severe
COVID 27(27).
If nAbs are important in preventing COVID-19, they may not have to be initially
present at detectable levels for protection against disease: The immune system is dynamic,
and as long as it has been stimulated and has SARS-Cov-2 specific memory cells, the quick
reactivation and production of antibodies from memory cells may be enough to protect
against disease. This would be similar to protection against Hepatitis B infection: antibodies
are protective, but despite antibodies waning to undetectable levels, efficacy from the
vaccine remains high 28(28). This is not always the case of course, an example being
preventing Hemophilus influenza B (Hib) meningitis: when initial antibody levels are too low,
Hib can still cause disease despite the quick production of antibodies from memory cells29
(29). The single dose regimen of BNT162-b2, with relatively low neutralizing antibodies yet

strong efficacy, may indicate that if nAb are crucial to prevent disease, then memory cells are
able to increase the nAb level quickly enough to prevent disease.
There is historical precedence using an estimated correlates of protection from NHP
studies for human use, rabies vaccine development being one example 30(30). Lower doses
in children are expected to be studied, including half and quarter dose regimens 31(31)
Comments from one of the principal investigators in J and J and Moderna clinical trials 32(32)
as well as from Pfizer’s investigator 33(33) would suggest that clinical vaccine efficacy in
children will be inferred from an estimated CoP rather than observed clinical efficacy data.
Yearly annual influenza vaccines are approved without clinical efficacy trials based on a CoP
34
(34).
There are multiple benefits to using lower dosing in the 19-55 aged population. It
greatly reduces vaccine supply constraint, and as long as administration of the vaccines
allows, it would vastly reduce the time needed to reach a set immunity level, which would
prevent disease as well as reduce the need for lockdowns and other non pharmaceutical
measures.
The reactogenicity profiles are milder for the lower dose regimens, which could
reduce vaccine hesitancy (22). Anecdotally there have been many reports of significant
symptoms after the second dose of vaccine leading to time lost at work. Using lower doses
could significantly minimize these events. This is especially important when considering the
potential need for a 3rd dose of a vaccine as a booster against VOCs: the reactogenicity for
dose 2 is greater than that of dose 1, and is unlikely to decrease with a 3rd dose. This could
be a factor in why Moderna is only trialling 3rd doses as 50ug or less, rather than using a
standard 100ug dose 35(35).
Beside the cost of lost time at work due to vaccine side effects, the cost of the
vaccine itself is an additional benefit to lower dose vaccination regimens. Using vaccine
price of 19.50 USD per vaccine dose for Pfizer 36(36), in using the BNT162b2 at 10ug/dose,
the cost saving per person is 26 USD ($19.50x2doses/3). Using an estimate of 190 million
people in the USA between ages of 19-55, and if 75% are vaccinated with a lower dose
mRNA vaccine regimen at an average saving of $26 per person, a cost saving of 3.7 billion
USD could be saved compared to the standard vaccination series. If a 3rd dose is required
as a booster, the financial savings would further increase.

The above benefits consider implementing a two dose 10ug BNT162b2 regimen,
which equals the immunological profile of an highly conservate CoP estimate. There is little
reason to use the standard 2 dose 30ug regimen’s immunological profile as a CoP estimate
now that there is clear clinical efficacy evidence showing that the lower immunological profile
of single 30ug dose (with neutralization titres nearly an order of magnitude less) still provide
strong clinical efficacy. This single dose immunogenicity profile is a tenable CoP estimate. It
also is likely not the minimum threshold required for protection, but it gives at least a closer
estimate of the levels that will eventually define the CoP compared to the highly conservative
CoP estimate.
Multiple alternate regimens in the Phase 1/2 trials with a lower total vaccine quantity
exceeded the tenable CoP estimate. Of note, the immunologic profile of 1ug doses given 21
days apart is favorable relative to one 30ug dose, showing higher levels of antibody titres
and virus neutralization, with a robust expansion of CD4 and CD8 cells while showing a
favorable cytokine profile. A single 10ug dose also appears to be equal to the tenable CoP.
The benefits to using a two dose 1ug regimen are magnified even more so than
using a two 10ug dose regimen as described above. The side effect profile is even more
favorable at 1ug doses. It would reduce vaccine cost per dose from 19.50 USD to 0.65
USD, making it much more economically feasible for less affluent countries. It would greatly
reduce vaccine supply as a bottleneck for vaccination in most countries. The time it takes
for less affluent countries to access to the vaccine would be shortened further.
One concern about the vaccine efficacy of a single dose 30ug regimen is the
unknown duration of that immunity, and that concern would also apply to the two dose 1ug
vaccine regimen. There has been no indication from countries delaying second doses (like
the UK and Canada) that one dose efficacy has significantly waned, and the two dose 1ug
vaccine would be likely to follow a similar trajectory. If immunity were to wane after a two
dose 1ug regimen then a third dose would be required to optimize protection. Of note, the
potential need for a third dose may also be true for the standard regimen. If T-cell response
is a surrogate for determining the duration of immunity, then the duration of immunity
between 30ug and 1ug dosing regimens might be similar, given they both elicit robust
cellular responses, but if antibody or neutralization is a surrogate for duration of protection,
then the standard dose with its order of magnitude higher antibody and neutralization
response would indicate longer duration of immunity.
Using a single 10ug dose instead of a 2 dose 1ug regimen would have the advantage
of requiring one less inoculation, but the disadvantage to this regimen is that it uses 5 times
the amount of vaccine as the two dose 1ug regimen. As noted in Figure 3, there was no
measurable immune response after a single 1 ug inoculation, so a two dose 1 ug regimen
would be unlikely to have significant protection until 7 days after the second dose. A single
10 ug dose regimen, in contrast, would have some protection as early as 14 days after the
first dose, two weeks earlier than the two dose 1 ug regimen.
Another important consideration is vaccine supply and the capacity to administer the
vaccine. For a region with a robust vaccine supply that is less cost conscious, the capacity
to administer the vaccine might be a bottleneck rather than total vaccine supply. If that is the
case, using a single dose of 10ug, followed by a second 10ug dose if needed, is logical. For
countries that are more cost conscious or where supply is the major limitation to vaccination,
then stretching each dose of vaccine as far as possible with a 2 dose 1ug regimen might be
favored. The equity of vaccine distribution between wealthy and poor countries appears

mostly to be an afterthought in practise 37(37), but it is important to note that the less vaccine
that is required for a vaccine rich country to protect its population should mean that vaccine
poor countries will have access to vaccines sooner. Only once global immunity has
increased will viral replication decrease and the risk of new variants will decrease along with
it.
A similar evaluation of Moderna mRNA-1273 data would show that 50ug per dose
appears equivalent to 100ug dosing 38(38) and by similar reasoning would also equal a
highly conservative CoP estimate. As a single dose of Moderna also showed robust efficacy
in the trial data, a two dose 25ug regimen exceeds a tenable CoP estimate (and it is likely
that even much lower doses than 25ug would meet or exceed a tenable CoP estimate).
In summary, when a CoP is not well defined, it appears using a CoP estimate
appears to be a reasonable approach, based on years of experience doing the same with
other vaccines, like the yearly influenza vaccine (34). It seems generally accepted that it is
reasonable to evaluate the efficacy of modified vaccines tailored to VOCs in a similar
manner, and this will likely be how the SARS-Cov-2 vaccine efficacy will be evaluated in
children. All of these will be implemented without clinical efficacy trials, although the efficacy
of modified vaccine regimens post implementation may be monitored. In the midst of an
ongoing pandemic, evaluating lower dose regimens in the same manner is logical.
The immunological profile of a two dose 10 ug of BNT162b2 regimen appears
equivalent to that of the two dose 30ug regimen, which is itself a highly conservative CoP
estimate. Without clinical efficacy trials, a 10ug dosing should replace the standard 30 ug
dose for all adults aged 19-55, even in the context of robust vaccine supply: while the
immunogenicity appears equivalent, one would gain the benefits of lower vaccine cost and a
favorable reactogenicity profile for the regimen, including a 3rd dose specific to VOC if
needed.
By the same rationale, in the context of vaccine shortage, a two dose 1ug regimen or
a single 10 ug dose should be considered for adults aged 19-55 without clinical efficacy
trials, as the immunological profiles of those regimens equal or exceed a tenable CoP
estimate, further decrease costs and side effects, and most importantly reduce supply
constraints. This would appear to dramatically increase the ability to augment total
population immunity.
The FDA, EMA, and ACCESS consortium are not reckless authorizing vaccine
modifications without clinical efficacy, provided there is comparable immunogenic data.
Considering the context, it is prudent. Failure to apply the same standard in evaluating low
dose vaccine regimens would appear to disregard the years of experience using CoPs with
other vaccines, and would mean losing the tremendous benefits gained by minimising supply
constraints.
