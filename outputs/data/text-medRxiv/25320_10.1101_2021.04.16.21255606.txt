Abstract

Governments around the globe use non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to curb the spread
of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Making decisions under uncertainty, they all face the
same temporal paradox: estimating the impact of NPIs before they have been implemented. Due to
the limited variance of empirical cases, researcher could so far not disentangle effects of individual
NPIs or their impact on different demographic groups. In this paper, we utilize large-scale agentbased simulations in combination with Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) models to
investigate the spread of COVID-19 for some of the most affected federal states in Germany. In
contrast to other studies, we sample agents from a representative survey. Including more realistic demographic attributes that influence agents’ behavior yields accurate predictions of COVID-19
transmissions and allows us to investigate counterfactual ”what-if” scenarios. Results show that quarantining infected people and exploiting industry-specific home office capacities are the most effective
NPIs. Disentangling education-related NPIs reveals that each considered institution (kindergarten,
school, university) has rather small effects on its own, yet, that combined openings would result
in large increases in COVID-19 cases. Representative survey-characteristics of agents also allow
us to estimate NPIs’ effects on different age groups. For instance, re-opening schools would cause
comparatively few infections among the risk-group of people older than 60 years.

Introduction

In 2020, governments tried to curb the spread of COVID-19 without having an appropriate medical
response available. Most governments implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) which affect
societal life in an unseen manner. Although there is initial evidence that NPIs, such as the closure of
educational facilities [7, 26, 27], workplaces [27, 38] and certain businesses [7, 26], the cancellation of
mass gatherings [7, 26, 27], case detection and contact tracing [23, 38], shielding of vulnerable people [24],
wearing masks [36] or specific network intervention strategies [39] are effective in reducing the amount of
new cases, it is also clear that NPIs come with severe side effects, e.g., on the economy [39, 41], labour
markets [11], people’s physical [34] and mental health [8], or concerns on increasing domestic violence
[6]. Thus, decision-maker act under immense pressure to balance public health risks while sustaining
economic activities. In so doing, policy-makers are facing a temporal paradox when it comes to the
implementation of NPIs: they have to decide whether a particular NPI (or a set thereof) is curbing
the spread of COVID-19 without having reliable knowledge about the NPIs’ actual effectiveness. The
best way to evaluate the effectiveness of NPIs would be to measure the empirical correlation between
the implementation of a NPI and the change of the infection rate. However, an empirical estimation is
difficult in many areas due to the unavailability of data. Only few studies exist with a rather narrow
set of scenarios [7, 26, 27] or coarse resolutions [14]. Empirical studies on the effect of NPIs are bydesign limited in scope because they can only measure the impact of what governments implement,
i.e., estimations rest on scenarios which have actually happened. Based on inter-temporal cross-country
data, Brauner et al. [7], for instance, cannot disentangle the effect of school closure and the effect of
university closure, because in most countries these two institutions were closed almost at the same time.
To circumvent one’s reliance on detailed empirical data in order to evaluate a larger variety of scenarios,
simulation methods can be used to create and investigate the effect of NPIs which did not occur in reality
[22, 44].
In addition, there is great need for more detailed knowledge of how NPIs work in the specific context of a country’s or region’s social structure [12, 44]. Preliminary evidence exists that the spread of
COVID-19 cases is starkly influenced by structural circumstances, such as age distributions [13, 17] or
network densities of geographic areas [31]. To reflect social structures and relevant characteristics of
people’s behavior in simulations, agent-based modeling (ABM) have proven to be good complements to
epidemiological differential equation models [18, 19, 39, 44]. Once a model with ’predictive capability’
is established [40], it is possible to create scenarios that differ from empirical scenarios but to apply the
simulation results to reality [22, 44].
Many researcher already exploit the benefits of data-driven agent-based models to investigate NPIs
in the context of a countries’ specific circumstances [9, 10, 20, 24, 30, 35, 38]). ABM exist for the U.S.
[10, 20], Canada [38], Australia [9], France [24], Singapore [30], Iran [35] and the UK [20]. Our model
not only adds (parts of) Germany to this list but uses a innovative method to generate an artificial
population of agents which resembles the real population of a federal state and, hence, important parts
of its social structure. Thus instead of corresponding to a few, rather coarse macro-characteristics of
the target population, our study represents households of survey participants. The micro-level of the
simulation – agents with specific attributes living together with other agents with specific attributes –
therefore reflects important properties of the social structure of a society; much more than synthesizing
the artificial population based on aggregated macro-data on the target populations’s household structure.
Utilizing large-scale agent-based simulations with representative survey data in combination with
SEIR models provides the frame for testing counterfactual ”what-if” scenarios in a quasi-experimental
setup. This allows us to assess the effectiveness of NPIs for a variety of otherwise unobservable scenarios
and deduce the effect of each NPI on its own (cf. ”Methods”4 for details). In addition, the micro-

age is the most important in regard to COVID-19 [17, 37].

Results

To derive the efficacy of NPIs in counterfactual scenarios, the first step is to ensure the predictive
capability of the model by assessing its fit to the actual spread of COVID-19. The proposed model
matches the empirical data of the daily number of cumulative cases for each of the four most affected
federal states in Germany (Figure 1). Our model predicts the rapid rise of COVID-19 cases in the early
stages of the pandemic as well as its subsequent decelerated growth in which the infection numbers
stabilize. The model also simulates accurately the different levels of disease spread in the four states,
which vary considerable by structure (cf. SI Table 3).
After establishing that the model actually predicts the empirical spread of the Corona virus, we can
turn to implementing counterfactual scenarios. We do that by removing each NPI that was at work
in reality (the ”Baseline”-scenario) and measure the effect of its omission in the simulation. Figure 2
reveals that decreasing the urge to quarantine infectious cases and reducing home office hours to regular
percentages would cause the starkest increase across all implemented NPIs. While quarantine is, by a
margin, the most important NPI in the two large territorial states (Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria),
it is a bit less important than increased home-office in the two smaller states. At the other end of the
efficacy spectrum is the scenario in which there was no reduction of work hours in certain economic
sectors due to economic downturns and the partial shutdown of their business. Across all states, it has
almost no effect in our simulation if people would have worked normal hours.

Figure 2: Effect of counterfactual non-implementation of NPIs, by state. Each line represents the effect
that the removal of one specific NPI has on the spread of COVID-19 in our simulation. For instance,
”Normal.Homeoffice” means that the percentage of people working at home is set to the statistical
average, i.e., the value in non-pandemic times.
Which education facilities may be kept running is one of the most controversial topics in Germany,
since it affects the lives of millions of pupils and parents. Turning to education-related NPIs, our
model predicts a large increase of COVID-19 cases if all three types of institutions (kindergartens,
schools, and universities) would re-open. In contrast to previous studies [7], our model also allows us
to inspect the effect of each education facility separately. In the counterfactual scenarios presented in
Figure 2, opening schools would have increased COVID-19 cases by several hundred (per day). Figure
3 disentangles the numbers further. It shows that opening all education-related institutions at the same
time has a considerable effect (third largest overall, 2), however, each institution alone causes much less
infections. Therefore, contagious effects seem at work which can be mostly attributed to the interplay of
kindergarten kids and pupils (”Open.Schools Kinder” in Figure 3). If comparing education-related NPI
individually, we see that the effects of all three types are rather similar. Yet, opening universities has
slightly lower effects than the other two, and opening schools causes the highest average effect in all four
states.
Besides considering NPIs separately, using an ABM with representative survey respondents as agents
allows us to trace infections by age group. Age constitutes one of the main factors to identify risk
groups [17]. In general and for each NPI, the mean age of infected agents decreases over time (Figure 4).
This reflects recent findings using rare empirical data on the age of infected [37]. Furthermore, Figure 4
details how each NPI affects different age groups. It reveals that the counterfactual removal of NPIs drive
COVID-19 numbers through the infection of agents younger than 60. Across all states, the scenarios
in which schools re-open and pre-pandemic home office rates are attained lead to the lowest proportion
among the elderly risk-group. In contrast, re-opening the universities yields a higher proportion of
infections among people older than 60, although the vast majority of infections pertains younger people

Discussion

Overcoming the temporal paradox of deciding whether the implementation of a particular NPI is decreasing the spread of COVID-19 before knowing its actual effect is crucial for policy-makers and researchers
alike. Testing such counterfactual ”what-if” scenarios could improve the basis for decision-making considerably and help to decide which NPIs to implement. Our approach illustrates a way to estimate the
effectiveness of otherwise unobservable scenarios by simulating agents with attributes taken from a large
survey representing about 27 million people. In so doing, our study generates insights on the effectiveness of several widespread NPIs (quarantine, home-office, closing universities, schools, and kindergartens,
reduced work hours) in four federal states in Germany. Going beyond previous studies, our approach
enables us to disentangle the effect of individual NPIs and, hence, provides information for policy makers
who need to balance the trade-off underlining each NPI between individual and economic freedom on
the one side, and prevention of disease spread on the other.
It can be shown that focused quarantining of infected agents and their household members (i.e., close
contacts) is the most effective NPI. Governments should therefore make every effort to increase their
ability of case detection and contact tracing [23, 38]. The second largest effect is the home office scenario.
It can be shown that an increased usage of home office capacities is a very effective measure to reduce
the number of new infections, which is in line with observational studies [3]. This result is particularly
important, because although there was a considerable increase of home office usage in the beginning of
the pandemic [32], both employers and employees still refuse to comprehensively rely on home office in
the long term [29].
The most controversial NPI is the closure of educational facilities. In contrast to many observa-

tional studies [7, 14, 21], we are able to estimate a separate effect for each education-related NPI. Our
simulations suggest that the separate re-opening of each institution yields rather low infection numbers. However, combined openings lead to multiple infections, in particular, re-opening kindergartens
and schools at the same time increase COVID-19 cases considerably. Therefore, alternating periods of
open educational institutions could represent a promising way to maintain low infection numbers while
sustaining institutional functions.
A key characteristic of COVID-19 is its elevated mortality for older people and the subsequent
importance of demographics [17]. Taking into account social structures by using agents with surveycharacteristics and in accordance with a very recent study for the USA [37], our findings reveal that
younger age (less risk-prone) groups sustain the spread of COVID-19 when the fore-mentioned NPIs
are omitted. Furthermore, simulations suggest that the removal of NPIs affect age groups differently.
Considering age adds an important puzzle piece how to select NPIs, i.e., it allows to distinguish the
impact of NPIs in regard to its overall effects and group-specific effects for the people who are most
vulnerable to COVID-19.
Like other simulation studies, our analysis has several limitations. First, our model does not contain a
representation of contacts between households or agents that do no take place in one of the implemented
locations, e.g., contacts with relatives or friends. Second, our model does not contain locations were
people meet during spare time. However, the influence of both points is mitigated because private
contacts and leisure activities were reduced to a minimum in the observed period.
A further limitation is that we do not model changes of people’s behavior. For example, we do
not take into account the change in caution about infection risks in daily life or the obligation to keep
distance and wear masks inside buildings. Also beyond the scope of this paper is the inclusion of external
influences. Instead, we simulate a closed system. After the initial infections at the beginning of a run no

infections occur due to agents coming home from ”outside”, e.g., commuters or tourists.
As many other simulation studies, we had to estimate some parameters due to a lack of empirical
data. However, we conducted a series of robustness checks for the most important of those parameters (cf.
Figures 5-9 in SI). Sensitivity analyses suggest that the results are robust to changes in the parameters
and, hence, to potential errors in assumed values.
Despite those limitations, we provide a reproducible model based on empirical agents which can
be adopted and/or extended (Python code freely available). For instance, the current model including
above NPIs could be readily applied on any states or regions. Researchers would only need to calibrate
the model with subsequent empirical data on COVID-19 cases and survey data. In addition, researcher
could extend the existing model with alternative NPIs which may be relevant for a specific region. The
simulated world can be amplified by many other ”meeting places” in which certain persons come into
contact.
Despite all efforts and (slowly) increasing availability of vaccinations, it appears that COVID-19 will
accompany our societies for some time to come [33]. Thus, the demand for data-driven epidemiological
models including realistic social structures and demography will stay high. Our model is an instance
how to incorporate survey-based populations and test counterfactual scenarios. The development and
improvement of such models and the timely availability of more accurate data was maybe never more
important than in the current global pandemic.

Methods

Creating the population of agents
Each agent-based model consists of 100000 agents living their live during the pandemic.1 They are
spending their time either at home, at an occupation specific work place, at kindergarten, at school, at
university or at a supermarket. Each action depends on the day of week, the time of day and individual
characteristics of each agent. The values of the agents’ characteristics, such as age, gender, occupation,
daily working hours or the time usually spent in the supermarket, are taken from survey data, i.e., each
agent represents a survey respondent in regard to his or her attributes. For that purpose, we use the 2017
German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) [43]. The SOEP is a representative panel survey that includes
entire households of respondents. Table 1 (cf. supplementary information SI) lists all variables used to
set agents’ attributes.
We model the infection on the level of federal states with differing social structures. We chose the
four states in Germany (Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, Hamburg, Saarland) with the highest infection
rate relative to its population size during the first wave of Covid-19 in Germany (March 2020). While
including other states/regions with lower infection numbers is possible, in principle, it is difficult to apply
on our closed system because the disease spread dies most often in early stages without the influx from
outside.
To create a population of agents that represents a given federal state, we first create a subset of
SOEP-respondents who reside in the given state. In a second step, we take a random sample (with
replacement) from the subset until a population size of at least 100000 is reached. The households’ selection probabilities are not equal, but are weighted by the corresponding cross-sectional representativity
weight provided by the SOEP for each household.
Like every survey, SOEP has to deal with missing values. For 3.53% of the sample we replace missing
data on working hours by age- and gender-specific group means. For 3.46% of the sample we replace
missing data on the occupation by a random occupation code in each simulation run. For cases with

missing information about the time spent daily in supermarkets (26,92%) we impute the overall mean
(approximately 1h). Finally, 1.62% of the households are excluded, because the case itself or a member
of the corresponding household has missing data.
To set the agents’ daily routines in the simulation, we classify each agent either as kindergartner,
school student, working, university student, working university student or non-working agent. Therefore,
we use ”empirical agents” to trace the spread of COVID-19.

Building the simulated world
The simulated world consists of different types of locations where agents can stay and between which
agents move. The types of locations implemented in the model are agents’ homes, workplaces, school
classes, kindergartens, universities and supermarkets, in order to simulate the most important NPIs that
had come into effect in each federal state in Germany in Spring 2020. The subsequent NPIs have been
closed schools, kindergartens and universities, increased usage of working from home (yet not at full
scale), quarantine of the household of infected people and reduced working hours due to the economic
shutdown.
For each household of the population a home is created in which all members of the household (taken
from the SOEP) reside. The number of additional location types is adjusted to the characteristics of
the agent population and the respective federal state. Table 1 (cf. SI) shows the parameters we use to
calculate the corresponding number of locations in the simulation model.

Daily routines
During the day, agents engage in various activities. An activity is implemented in the simulation as
staying at a certain place for a certain period of time. The type of activity an agent engages in, when
and for how long, depends on the clock time, the weekday, the agent’s attributes and the NPIs that
are currently in effect. The default activity that every agent exhibits when there is no other activity on
its schedule is being at home. The simulation starts with every agent being at home. Each time step
represents an hour. Every morning at 8 o’clock each agent first decides whether it should stay at home
due to symptoms of an infection or household quarantine. If neither is the case, if the agent’s daily
schedule is not affected by an NPI and if it is a weekday from Monday to Friday, kindergarten kids go to
kindergarten, school kids go to school, university students attend university, and workers go to work. To
account for the possibility of home office in the simulation, working agents change their location to their
workplace only with a certain probability and otherwise start working from home. The probabilities
to work from home are derived from data on the frequency of home office use per NACE-category in
Germany in 2018 [4]. The respective NPI on increased home office usage sets numbers as if the home
office capacity would have been exploited in each NACE-industry [4]. Therefore, the scenario in which
home office is reduced to pre-pandemic times must be interpreted accordingly.
School kids and kindergarten kids return to their homes after 5 hours, university students after 4. If
university students have jobs, they first go to work and after work they go to university. While the dwell
time at kindergarten, school and university are based on assumptions, the daily working hours represent
those of the modeled survey respondents. When agents are at home and do no other activity, there is a
certain probability to go to the supermarket. Every night at 1 a.m. the clock is set forward to 7 a.m. so
that most of the night time is skipped.

Modeling the infection
The biological aspect of the infection, i.e. what happens to an agent after the virus was successfully
transmitted, was implemented in strong orientation to the way the process of infection is implemented in
”Covasim” [28]. It can be considered as an extended S-E-I-R (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered)
infection model [2]. If an infectious agent and a susceptible agent are at the same time in the same place,
there is certain probability of infecting the susceptible agent. At each time step, each infectious agent
randomly selects one agent that is currently in the same location if the infectious agent is currently not
alone in its location. If the agent randomly selected by the infectious agent is susceptible to infection,
its infection status is set to ‘exposed’ by a certain probability of infection. This hourly probability of
infection is a very important, but unknown parameter and is therefore determined by model calibration
to empirical infection data of a given state (cf. section ”Scaling and calibration”). How long each stage
lasts and if the agent develops symptoms or not, is determined individually for each agent based on its
empirical characteristics. For each agent and each stage of infection we draw individual time spans from
a log-normal-distribution following Covasim [28]. In addition, the decision whether an agent develops
symptoms or not is determined by an age-dependent probability, which also resembles Covasim [28].

NPIs and scenarios
The initial goal of the model is to capture the course of the pandemic during its first wave in Germany.
For each state, we simulate 100 days, starting with the day when a state had approximately 50 cases
per 100,000 inhabitants. While this defines the scope of the paper’s results, in future research the model
could also be extended to further waves to come. The main aim is to estimate effects of multiple NPIs
implemented during the first wave in Germany. These effects must be considered in the model in order to
capture the mechanisms of virus spread as close to reality as possible. The changes on the agents’ daily
lives due to NPIs considered in the model are the following: less to no time at school, kindergarten or
university, an increased amount of time working from home, quarantining households of infected agents
and reduced or no work hours due a (partial) shutdown of certain branches of industry.
Most effects of NPIs are implemented as a change in probability of actually leaving the home and
exercising a certain activity. In response to active NPIs, the specific probability reflects whether a certain
location is closed (or to what degree), or that work hours are reduced for a given NACE-category. For
example, a (partially) closed school is implemented as a daily probability that determines for each school
kid separately whether he or she goes to school that day. If schools are completely open, the probability
for school attendance is 1. Complete closure of schools are reflected in a daily probability of school
attendance equal to 0. If an agent shows symptoms of an infection over a certain period of time, the
agent and all household members are quarantined at home for 14 days.
In the baseline model we mimic the course of the lockdown in Germany with its onset at around march
15 and the following 3 months of disease spread. It is important to note that each effect is the change
in the number of cases if a given NPI had not been implemented while all other NPIs remain active
(if not reported differently, e.g., the combined effects of education-related NPIs in the ”School Kinder”scenario).

Scaling and calibration
In each run of the simulation we collect the new infections per day, the cumulative cases on a day and the
age of the infected agents. If the size of the agent population is exactly equal to 100000 cases, frequencies
can be directly interpreted as cases per 100000 inhabitants. Otherwise, the infection frequencies are
calculated by I ∗ 100000/P , where I is the number of infections and P is the actual population size in

the simulation. Therefore, all results can be interpreted as cases per 100000.
Due to the many stochastic elements used in the simulation, each single run of the model returns
different results, even when the same set of parameters is used. Thus, to obtain reliable results for a
given set of parameters we run 60 repetitions of model runs and average the results.
Although the model includes relevant micro-level mechanisms of a pandemic and a representative
agent population, we must perform some iterative fine-tuning as is often done in ABMs, i.e., calibrating
the model to reproduce empirical data [45]. To calibrate the ABMs on infection frequencies in a given
federal state, we determine the values of two parameters: the hourly probability an infected agent
will infect another agent, and the time needed to quarantine a household after the first symptoms of
a household member appear. We performed the calibration using the ”Latin Hypercube Sampling”
algorithm [45], which is implemented in the python package ”Spotpy” [25]. For each model to be
calibrated, we searched for the set of model parameters that generate simulated data with the smallest
deviation to the corresponding daily empirical data on cumulative number of infections (data source:
[42]). We stopped the calibration process when at least one set of parameters was found to generate
simulated data with a fit of a root mean squared error less than 20. Because the calibration of the model
for a single federal state requires at least 180 simulation runs (each consisting itself of 60 internal runs
and one run takes approx. 20 minutes) due to varying parameter sets, each process of calibration was
serialized on 192 cores provided by BW-HPC, a statewide computing and data infrastructure.

Figure 9: Robustness check: maximum number of students per university. Compares the number of
COVID-19 infections in the baseline scenario across different values for the maximum number of students
per university. We used 100,000 in the main analysis, which means that there is only one university per
simulated world.
