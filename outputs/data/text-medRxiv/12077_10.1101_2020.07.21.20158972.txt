Summary
Background:
Superinfections, including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), are well-known
complications of critically ill patients with severe viral pneumonia. Aim of this study was to
evaluate the incidence, risk factors and outcome of IPA in critically ill patients with severe
COVID-19 pneumonia.
Methods:
We prospectively screened 32 critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia for a
time period of 28 days using a standardized study protocol for oberservation of developement
of COVID-19 associated invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). We collected laboratory,
microbiological, virological and clinical parameters at defined timepoints in combination with
galactomannan-antigen-detection from bronchial aspirates. We used logistic regression
analyses to assess if COVID-19 was independently associated with IPA and compared it with
matched controls.
Findings:
CAPA was diagnosed at a median of 4 days after ICU admission in 11/32 (34%) of critically
ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia as compared to 8% in the control cohort.
In the COVID-19 cohort, mean age, APACHE II score and ICU mortality were higher in
patients with CAPA than in patients without CAPA (36% versus 9.5%; p<0.001). ICU stay
(21 versus 17 days; p=0.340) and days of mechanical ventilation (20 versus 15 days; p=0.570)
were not different between both groups. In regression analysis COVID-19 and APACHE II
score were independently associated with IPA.
Interpretation:
CAPA is highly prevalent and associated with a high mortality rate. COVID-19 is
independently associated with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. A standardized screening and
diagnostic approach as presented in our study can help to identify affected patients at an early
stage.
Funding:
None

Introduction

Since the outbreak of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) – associated respiratory disease in December 2019, numerous patients were hospitalized
with viral pneumonia and respiratory insufficiency, which was finally designated as the
clinical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1). Nearly 5% of the affected COVID-19
patients are critically ill, develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and need
intensive care unit management including mechanical ventilation (1, 2).
Along with other uncertainties during an intensive care unit (ICU) stay, superinfections,
including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), are well-known complications of severe
viral pneumonia in critically ill patients. The association between viral pneumonia and IPA
was first reported in a greater cohort during the H1N1 influenza seasons 2009-2011 by
Wauters et al. (3). Surprisingly, not only the rate of IPA was higher than suspetced (incidence
of 23%) but also nearly half of the IPA patients did not fulfill the classical risk factors of the
European organisation for research and tretament of cancer/ mycosis study group
(EORTC/MSG) for IPA developement in this cohort (4). These findings could be confirmed
by the dutch-belgian mycosis study group and resluted not only in the recognition of influenza
as an independent risk factor for IPA devlopement but also in modified definitions and
diagnostic criterias for IPA in critically ill patients (5, 6).
Therefore, with the (modified) AspICU algorithm for critically ill patients adapted diagnostic
criterias for IPA could be established beside the EORTC/MSG criteria (7). However, the new
clinical conditions of COVID-19 patients along with infection control restrictions for
biosampling will make the diagnostic procedures and microbiological interpretation for IPA
in COVID-19 patients more challenging.
In analogy to what has been reported in critically ill patients with severe influenza associated
pneumonia, the aim of our prospective AspCOVID-19 study is to describe the incidence and
outcome of COVID-19 associated invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) in critically ill
patients with severe pneumonia using a standardized screening procedure and assess whether
COVID-19 is independently associated with IPA.

Methods:
Study design and participants
This prospective cohort study was conducted at two tertiary care ICU´s (department of
internal medicine and department of anaesthesiology) of the University Hospital of Technical
University of Munich, Germany.
Patients (18 years of age or older) with confirmed severe COVID-19 pneumonia (clinical
signs, typical laboratory constellation, PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 positive and chest
computed tomography (CT) scan with typical signs) who were admitted to the ICU due to
acute respiratory failure for more than 48 hours with the need for mechanical ventilation were
eligible for study inclusion.
64 COVID-19 negative critically ill patients with ARDS and pneumonia without
immunosuppression were included as a retrospective matched control group. Selection criteria
for the control cohort were ARDS caused by pneumonia with a corresponding Horowitz Index
<150 mmHg as well as comparable sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and acute
physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) scores. Exclusion criteria of the
control cohort were as follows:
-

Patients fulfilling the EORTC/MSG criteria

-

Immunosuppression

-

mycological evidence from only one specimen from lower repiratory tract and no
correlation in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) or standard microbiological findings

A total of 347 ICU patients were screened for the retrospective machted control cohort, 283
were excluded (215 didnot fulfill the selection criteria, 67 met the EORTC/MSG criteria, 1
patient was Aspergillus spp. colonized). Pregnancy, age younger than 18 years, insufficient
available information or lacking written informed consent were general exclusion criterias.
The study was approved by the institutional review board, Klinikum rechts der Isar, TU
München (Ref. 149/20S) and registred as a prospective study at ISRCTN (trial registration
number 38127). Written informed consent was obtained by the patient or their legal
representatives

Screening for aspergillosis of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and control cohort:
Patients of the COVID-19 cohort were prospectively screened in defined time intervals for
developement of Covid-19 associated invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) following the
study protocol (figure 1).

In addition standard microbiological, virological and laboratory tests were performed at time
intervals summarized in the study protocol (at admission tests were also perforemd before
ICU admittance in the emergency department or general ward. If these tests were performed
>1 day before ICU admission all test were repeated at ICU admittance). All patients received
a chest CTscan before ICU admittance. Testing for atypical pneumonia (using PCR from
bronchial aspirates, and pneumococcal antigen from urine) as well as respiratorial syncytial
virus (RSV) - and influenza were performed in all patients.
For safety reasons, diagnostic testing of respiratory specimens was performed in accordance
to the guidelines of the European society of intensive medicine (ESCIM) with bronchial
aspirates (BA) gained by deep bronchial suction with a closed suction system from intubated
patients.
Screening for CAPA ended after extubation for all patients. In patients with positive proof of
aspergillus galactomannan-antigen (GM) a serum GM follow up examination was performed.
Overall observation time for all COVID -19 patients was 28 days.
Results of glactomannan testing from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) examinations were used
in the control group. These patients were screened for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis once
weekly according to our local ICU standard.

Definitions:
The modified AspICU score, developed for the diagnostic assessment of influenza associated
IPA, was adapted on COVID-19 patients and used to classify IPA. Putative IPA was assumed
in one of the following conditions: cultural growth of Aspergillus spp.; GM optical density
index (ODI) >0.5 in serum, GM ODI >1 in lower respiratory tract specimen. Clinical signs
and radiological signs were in line with the modified AspICU score.
When >1 criterion necessary for CAPA diganosis was not met, these cases were classified as
Aspergillus colonization.
Every COVID-19 patient fulfilling the mentioned criteria was discussed by a specialist
(consultant) for microbiology and a specialist for intensive care medicine (consultant) to
ascertain that the criterias for CAPA were appropriate.

Microbiological and virological methods:
Galactomannan (GM) detection (PlateliaT M Aspergilllus Ag, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Munich,
Germany) was performed in serum samples and in bronchial aspirations (BA) samples gained
by deep tracheal suction with a closed suction system from the lower respiratory tract.
Primary aerobic microbiological cultures from BA fluid were performed on columbia agar
and chocolate agar (prepared culture media, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, United States of
America). When growth of Aspergillus spp. could be established, it was then sub-cultured on
sabouraud-dextrose-agar (Oxoid™ Thermo Fisher Scientific™, Waltham, MA, United States
of America) for species identification via macroscopic, microscopic and MALDI-TOF
(Bruker Daltronics GmbH, Leipzig, Germany) analysis.
Phenotypic screening for azol-resistance in Aspergillus spp. was performed routinely using
RPMI (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, United States of America) agar plates supplemented
with voriconazol (2mg/L) and itraconazol (4mg/L) and an antifungal- free agar as growth
control. Azole susceptible isolates were identified by growth on the antifungal- free agar and
absence of growth on plates containing azoles.

Virological testing:
SARS CoV-2 nucleocapsid gene was detected by Taqman RT PCR with the primers 2019nCoV_N1-F-5`-GAC CCC AAA ATC AGC GAA AT-3`, 2019-nCoV_N1-R 5`-TCT GGT
TAC TGC CAG TTG AAT CTG-3 and the probe 2019-nCoV_N1-P 5`-FAM-ACC CCG
TAC GTT TGG TGG ACC-BHQ1-3` (https://www.cdc.gov/). Positive results were
confirmed with another pair of N gene primers and- probe. IgG and IgM antibodies directed at
SARS-CoV were detected with the iFlash 1800Chemiluminescence Immunoassay Analyzer
(YHLO, China).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 25 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois,
USA). Samples were checked for normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Descriptive
data of normally distributed parameters are presented as mean ± standard deviation and as
median and range for non-parametric parameters. The Mann-Whitney-U and Kruskas-Wallis
tests were used to analyze non-parametric variables and the t-test and a one-way analysis of
variances (ANOVA) to analyze variables with normal distribution. To compare qualitative

parameters, chi-square test and in small samples (expected frequency of test variable less than
5) Fisher's exact test was used. Probabilities are displayed as odds ratio (OR) with 95%
confidence interval (CI). All statistical tests were two-sided with a level of significance (pvalue) of 5%. Binary logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors for
aspergillosis. Factors with a p-value below 0.05 in univariate analysis were included in the
regression models. To control the false discovery rate after multiple testing we adjusted the
level of significance to p=0.015 by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for qualitative
parameters in the COVID-19 positive patient cohort.
Based on previous studies, sample size was estimated as follows : Assuming 5% of invasive
pulmonary aspergillosis in an overall patient population and 20% (estimated from influenza
patients) in critically ill COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia, we needed 32 patients in
the COVID-19 cohort and 64 patients in the control cohort to gain a power of 0,786.

Results:
Between March and April 2020, 32 patients with severe COVID-19 associtaed pneumonia
were prospectively included in the AspCOVID-19 study. Influenza and respiriatory syncytial
virus were negative in all included patients.
Basic patient characteristics of the COVID-19 cohort are summarized in table 1. All patients
in the COVID-19 cohort were SARS -CoV-2 PCR positive at ICU admission.

All patients received a chest CT scan before ICU admittance with typical signs for COVID-19
pneumonia but no specific signs for IPA. Results of portable chest x-ray controlls during ICUstay revealed only unspecific infiltrates. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated in all
critically ill patients. Standardized laboratory parameters according to the study protocol
included C reactive protein, procalcitonin, interleukin 6, lactat dehydrogenases, d-Dimer,
leukocyte coount, and lymphocyte count. No statistical significance could be observed
between COVID-19 patients with and without CAPA except for Interleukin-6 (median 259,
range 28-793 versus median 118, range 12-234; p=0.013). Laboratory parameters for CAPA
survivors and non-survivors are listed in table 2.

In total, 11 (34%) of 32 critically ill COVID-19 patients fulfilled the modified invasive
pulmonary aspergillosis definition for putative invasive pulmonray aspergillosis (see above).
Three patients did not meet the modified criteria; these were defined as colonised and
excluded from the study. Median time till diagnosis of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was 4
days (range 1-7) after ICU admission and intubation.
In the COVID-19 Cohort, mean age (mean: 72 versus 60 years; p=0.003), APACHE II score
(mean: 23 versus 17; p= 0.027) and ICU mortality were higher in patients with CAPA than in
patients without CAPA (36% versus 9.5%; p<0.001).
ICU stay (21 days (range 9-28) versus 17 days (range 5-28); p=0.340) and mechanical
ventilation days (20 days (range 8-28) versus 15 days (range 3-28); p=0.570) were not
different between COVID-19 patients with and without CAPA.
Dividing the COVID-19 cohort into patients of CAPA survivors (n=7) and CAPA nonsurvivors (n=4) the following differences could be observed:
SOFA score (mean: 11 versus 14; p= 0.026), intially Horowitz Index and follow up Horrowitz
Index after antimycotic initiation were significantly different for CAPA non survivors as
compared to CAPA survivors (day 1: 77 versus 118; p=0.036; day 3: 91 versus 145; p=0.030;
day 7: 104 versus 190; p=0.048). Mechanical ventilation days (21 days (range 11-25) versus
17 days (range 12-22); p=0.089) were not significantly different.
In 9 (82%) of the 11 patients with IPA, cultural growth of Aspergillus spp. Could be
established revealing Asp. fumigatus in all cases. GM- ODI in all bronchial aspirate (BA)
specimes of CAPA patients was >1 in repeated measurements. Positive serum GM could
only be observed in the CAPA non-survivors group. All patients received antimycotic
therapy. Therapy monitoring using BA GM revealed decreasing GM levels during
observation time in the CAPA survivors but not in the CAPA non survivors (see table 2).
SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive in all CAPA patients at ICU admittance. Mean days of SARS
CoV-2 positivity were significantly shorter in CAPA survivors than in CAPA non survivors
(12 (range 9-20) versus 17 days; p<0.001). None of the CAPA non survivor patients
developed antibodies against SARS CoV-2 in contrast to all CAPA surviors (p<0.001).

After 28 days significantly more patients without CAPA were discharged from the hospital (8
versus 1; p=0.025), no differences could be observed between ICU and general ward stay at
day 28 (see table 1).
In the COVID-19 cohort 11 (34%) were diagnosed with IPA in contrast to 5 (8%) out of 64
patients in the COVID negative control cohort (see table 3).

In the total patient cohort including the negative controls COVID-19 (11/16 versus 21/80,
p=0.001), higher APACHE II score (18.7±3.1 versus 23.0±3.1; p<0.001), higher SOFA score
(median 10, range 4-17 versus median 12, range 10-15; p<0.001) and coronary heart disease
(2/16 versus 32/80, p=0.036) were associated with IPA.
To assess whether COVID-19 was independently associated with IPA, a binary logistic
regression analysis was performed. This analysis confirmed an independent association
between COVID-19 and IPA. Also a higher APACHE II score was independently associated
with IAP (Figure 2A).

Regarding the COVID-19 cohort, none of the univariate significant parameters were
independently associated with IAP in the logistic regression analysis (Figure 2B).

Discussion:
As far as we know, up to know our study is the largest prospective study on incidence, risk
factors and outcome of IPA in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.
Moreover, our study shows, that COVID-19 is an independent risk factor for IPA.
In comparison to our control cohort, COVID-19 increased the risk of developing an IPA from
8% to 34% and CAPA is associated with a mortality rate of 36%. These findings are as high
as previously shown mortality rates, espcially reported from patients with severe influenza
pneumonia.
Although, typical risk factors for COVID-19 e.g. arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus type
2 or coronary heart disease were also significantly more frequent in our COVID-19 cohort,
these risk factors were not associated with an increased risk of developing CAPA (8).
Moreover, none of these patients fulfill the typical EORTC/MSG host factor criteria, and only
a few COVID-19 patients (4/32) had a history of a chronic pulmonary disease prior to the
infection with SARS-CoV-2.
In fact, most patients with COVID-19 presented with mild flu-like symptoms, but up to 15%
of the affected patients required assisted oxygenation and 5% of them deteriorated towards a
severe ARDS as presented in our study cohort (8). Data on intrinsic risk factors which may
predispose to severe ARDS- in COVID-19 patients are sparse. Only small pathological
studies of patients with severe COVID-19 associated ARDS, report a typical diffuse alveolar
damage combined with intra-alveolar neutrophilic infiltration and vascular congestion, which
is interpreted as an acute phase component (9, 10). Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 might trigger an
imbalanced immune response resulting in a ‘cytokine stom’ and extensive pulmonary
inflammation (11). If the proposed mechanism causing lung injury is a consequence of the
described pathological findings or vice versa has to be investigated in further studies. Taken
together, it could be assumed that these findings, similary reported in SARS, may lead to an
impaired mucociliary activity stimulated by immune cell dysfunction and immune system
dysregulation which paves the way for secondary infections (9,11).
It has been shown in several studies including ours, that these super-infections have a negative
impact on the outcome of affected patients. (12, 13). The overall incidence of IPA is in line
with reported rates for critically ill patients varying between 1 and 7% (12, 13). Furthernore

our data increases the awareness of IAP as complication in patients with COVID-19
associated ARDS and helps clinicians to establish standardized screening methods for
invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and to early identify high risk patients.
In this study we used the modified AspICU score for diagnosis of CAPA in combination with
standardized time intervals of screening. As clinical criteria such as ongoing fever, dyspnea or
worsening respiratory insufficiency are also typical of COVID-19 and radiological findings in
non-neutropenic patients in most cases do not allow to discrimante typical mycological
findings from COVID-19, the diagnosis of CAPA is mostly based on mycological criterias
(14).
GM-detection in BAL is a valid test to confirm or rule out IPA with a sensitivity and
specificity of approximatley 90% using an ODI-cut-off of ≥0.8 (15).
Due to safety concerns regarding - aerosolization and surface stability of SARS-CoV-2, only
bronchial aspirates from deep bronchial suction via a closed system were used for diagnostics
as recommend by ESCIM guidelines (16, 17). If the mentioned ODI cut-off for BAL is also
reliable for BA specimenis is still a matter of debate. Moreover, increasing the ODI cut-off
does not necessarily increase the sensitivity and specificity as reported in some studies (18).
Thus, as recommended and used in several studies we used a galactomannan ODI cut-off of
>1 for BA equivalent to BAL specimens. Following these considerations we found putative
IPA in 34% of our critically ill COVID-19 patients, which is nearly a similar rate to what has
been observed in patients with severe influenza pneumonia. Additionally, the median BA GM
ODI of all patients within the CAPA cohort was 5.4 (range 1.8-7.4). Moreover, the cultural
growth of Aspergillus spp. From BA-specimens in 80% of the CAPA patients together with
serum GM-detection with ODI >0.5 in 4 CAPA patients strongly emphazise that CAPA is a
relevant complication in severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Mean timepoint of CAPA diagnosis
was day 4 of ICU stay, which seems early. This may be explained by the fact that all patients
already have had reported severe COVID-19 symptoms for several days prior to hospital
admission. Antimycotic therapy was initiated in all patients with putative IPA according to
recent guidelines (19). The decreasing BA galactomannan levels and increasing Horovitz
indexes during therapy suggest an effect of the specific antmycotics beside general ARDS
management in the CAPA survivors group. Regarding the high observed incidence of CAPA,
the role of antifungal prophylaxis should be further studied.
Nevertheless, there was no difference in median ventilation and ICU days between the
COVID-19 cohort with and without CAPA, which may be explained by the severity of

COVID-19 itself. CAPA patients were significantly older, had a higher APACHE II score and
a higher mortality rate as mentioned above.
However, some findings in the CAPA non survivors group were striking. Increased serum
interleukin-6 and LDH levels could be associated with worse outcome in COVID-19 patients
(20). These findings could be confirmed in the CAPA non-survivors with significantly
elevated serum levels, especially of interleukin 6. Moreover, the role of SARS-CoV-2 not
only in the pathophysiology of lung injury but also in enhancing an ongoing infection have to
be investigated in further studies. In our cohort all CAPA survivors cleared the detectable
SARS-CoV-2 RNA and generated IgG antibodies during their ICU stay in contrast to CAPA
non survivors with virus persistence until death.
Our study had some limitations. First, it is a single center experience and, confounding cannot
be ruled out. However, this is the first prospective study evaluating a standardized screening
tool in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonie in comparison to a retrospective control
cohort.
Secondly, the usage of BA instead of BAL is novel and has not been evaluated in larger
studies. Given the observations in our study cohort, showing that diagnosis was confirmed in
several follow up examinations and by cultures, as well as the special circumstances in
COVID-19 patients, we believe, that BA in mechanical ventilated patients gained through
deep bronchial suction, are a suitable alternative for GM-testing.
Finaly, due to the novelty of COVID-19 there is still limited information about
pathophysiology and clinical characteristics particularly in critically ill patients. Therfore,
further studies are needed to analyse out risk profiles for development of CAPA.
In conclucion, in critically ill COVID-19 patients, Covid-19 associated invasive pulmonary
aspergillosis is highly prevalent and associated with a high mortality rate. COVID-19 and a
high APACHE II score are independently associated with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. A
standardized screening and diagnostic approach as presented in our study can help to identify
out affected patients at an early stage.

Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for articles using the search terms „COVID-19“ and „aspergillosis“.
This search yielded case reports which described invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in critically
ill patients with COVID-19. Yet, a systematic prospective evaluation of the risk of invasive
pulmonary aspergillosis in a critically ill population with COVID-19 is missing. Also, it
remaines to be demonstrated if COVID-19 is independently associated with invasive
aspergillosis.

Added value of this study
This study is to our knowledge the first prospective study performed on the risk for invasive
pulmonary aspergillosis in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. We
compared the COVID-19 cohort with matched controls with severe ARDS for the occurrence
of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. With 34% incidence of COVID-19 asscociated invasive
pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) is higher as in other collectives resulting in an overall ICU
mortality rate of 36% as compared to 9.5% in patients without CAPA.
It is also the first study demonstrating that COVID-19 is an independent risk factor for
invasive pulmonary aspergillosis by comparison to a COVID-19 negative control cohort.

Implications of all the available evidence
The independent association of COVID-19 and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis combined
with a high mortality rate implicates that standardized screening for COVID-19 associated
invasive pulmonary aspergillosis can help to identify patients at risk at an early stage and initiate
antimycotic therapy.
