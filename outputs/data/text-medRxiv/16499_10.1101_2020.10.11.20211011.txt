ABSTRACT:
Background: COVID-19 test sensitivity and specificity have been widely examined and discussed yet

optimal use of these tests will depend on the goals of testing, the population or setting, and the

anticipated underlying disease prevalence. We model various combinations of key variables to identify

and compare a range of effective and practical surveillance strategies for schools and businesses.

Methods: We coupled a simulated data set incorporating actual community prevalence and test

performance characteristics to a susceptible, infectious, removed (SIR) compartmental model,

modeling the impact of base and tunable variables including test sensitivity, testing frequency, results

lag, sample pooling, disease prevalence, externally-acquired infections, and test cost on outcomes

case reduction.

Results: Increasing testing frequency was associated with a non-linear positive effect on cases averted

over 100 days. While precise reductions in cumulative number of infections depended on community

disease prevalence, testing every 3 days versus every 14 days (even with a lower sensitivity test)

reduces the disease burden substantially. Pooling provided cost savings and made a high-frequency

approach practical; one high-performing strategy, testing every 3 days, yielded per person per day

costs as low as $1.32.

Conclusions: A range of practically viable testing strategies emerged for schools and businesses. Key

characteristics of these strategies include high frequency testing with a moderate or high sensitivity

test and minimal results delay. Sample pooling allowed for operational efficiency and cost savings with

minimal loss of model performance.

INTRODUCTION
As schools and businesses re-open and attempt to stay open, promptly detecting people with

infectious COVID-19 is essential, especially as the risk of transmission is expected to increase with

1, 2

colder weather, more time indoors, and closer contact with others.

Recommended actions to

attenuate spread include symptom checking, monitoring underlying community prevalence, and

responsive policy adjustment. In addition to robust public health measures, successful return to

normalcy will be accelerated and hopefully sustained by optimal COVID-19 testing strategies. Despite

being commonly recommended, little guidance suggests the right approach to testing and how best to

balance cost, test selection, results delays, the value of sample pooling, and how changing local

disease prevalence should inform strategy adjustments.

Throughout the pandemic the number and variety of tests for detecting active infection have steadily

3

increased.

Current tests include nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) such as reverse-transcription

or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), template mediated amplification (TMA),

nicking enzyme amplification reaction (NEAR), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), nucleic

acid hybridization, viral metagenomic sequencing, and CRISPR-based assays. Most Food and Drug

Administration (FDA) - Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) tests are approved for symptomatic

patients, but not all are validated in an asymptomatic population. Despite these scientific

advancements, there is scant guidance on how to apply a specific technology in the context of the

underlying population and the goal of testing, such as diagnosis of an individual versus surveillance of

a group. Cost, turnaround time, and convenience in sample collection all play a role in achieving a rate

of testing that achieves a goal of detecting and preventing transmission in a cohort. A testing strategy

is not feasible if the cost per test at the individual level is too high, or the time to obtain results is too

long, resulting in possible transmission while positive test results are in transit or missing an

opportunity to attend work or school if the result is negative. To increase test processing efficiency

and reduce cost, pooling of samples is a potential solution provided there is minimal degradation in

test performance due to dilution, but a strategy should be devised carefully. Successful pooling

strategies rely on a clear understanding of the test’s limit of detection (LOD), sensitivity, specificity,

and the prevalence of disease in the population being tested.

4

Testing in large cohort settings such as schools and businesses that require continued surveillance can

ensure that facilities remain open safely for the greatest number of people. We model various

scenarios of test sensitivity and specificity, testing frequency, cost, and pooling to illustrate the range

of practical and sustainable surveillance strategies.

METHODS
To compare the effects of test sensitivity and specificity, test frequency, and the impact of pooling we

considered a classical epidemiological susceptible, infectious, removed (SIR) compartmental model for

the tested population. To account for the introduction of infections from the surrounding community,

we added a time-dependent term which represents the rate (in people/time) of infections from

outside interactions continuously in time. With frequent testing, this external forcing drives the

behavior of the model (Figure 1). We examine two scenarios for this forcing. The first is a relatively low

and more-or-less constant rate of introduced infections, with data from the 7-day rolling average of

the case count in Fayette County, Pennsylvania for the 100 days beginning March 26, 2020 as reported

5

in the New York Times.

This low-growth profile is reported as panel (a) in Figures 2, 3, and 4. The

second scenario used for high-growth external community prevalence is the seven-day rolling average

of daily case counts in Miami-Dade County, Florida for the 100 days beginning June 16, 2020. This

profile is shown in panel (b) in Figures 2, 3, and 4. In both profiles, we scaled the cases given by the

relative population in our model, which we chose to be 1500. To model pooled testing we solved the

SIR model over

days, with the initial test on day zero. To account for possible delays in receiving test

results, we allowed for a delay parameter,

 . On day   we stopped the model and restarted with

new “initial conditions” which account for the transfer of people who tested positive and are thus

removed from mixing in the model. We adjusted for test sensitivity and applied a linear discount rate

for pooling of 0.00323, consistent with minimal sample dilution or degradation in a nasal or

Other discount rates may be more appropriate in different settings, such as

Our model allows for a varied percent of those that are infected to choose to comply

with isolation protocols; in the scenarios presented we set this tunable assumption to be perfect

compliance. We assume the basic reproduction number R0 is 2.5 and the average period of

8, 9, 10, 11

infectiousness is 9 days.

The initial conditions are chosen from the average of population-

scaled new confirmed cases reported by the New York Times for September 23, 2020 in a sample of

counties scaled by average number of infectious days. This results in a starting value of 1.35 infections

for a population of size 1500. We take the conservative approach of assuming no one in the

population has immunity to the virus based on previous infection. In the tests that follow we vary the

testing frequency ( ), delay in the return of results (

 ), number of samples pooled (), sensitivity of

the test on one sample, and specificity of the test. We computed the cost of each testing strategy at

to complete each round of testing. The complete scientific code is available as a supplementary file. All

12

analysis was done using Julia v1.5.1.

RESULTS
Figure 2 demonstrates scenarios of testing frequency at sensitivities of 98% with a two-day delay in

receiving results during which mixing continues (Figure 2c, d), 98% with no delay in receiving results

(Figure 2e, f), and 60% with no delay (Figure 2g, h) to simulate testing by various technologies such as

PCR with lags between sample collection and centralized laboratory testing, antigen detection, and

LAMP. As there are little data on the performance of some tests in asymptomatic people, we used

13

more conservative sensitivity estimates aligning to published LOD for specific devices from the FDA.

The sawtooth pattern is the result of removal of infected persons from the population.

Any testing strategy is better than none at all, and as expected, tests with increased sensitivities

perform for a given time frequency. At the most lenient frequency considered, every 14 days, the

number of infections is reduced approximately 31-98% (Table 1) compared to no testing at all. Each

scenario can be explored comparatively. For example, at a test sensitivity of 80%, the effect of testing

every day in a population of 1500 compared to testing every 14 days reduced the number of

cumulative infections at day 100 by 364 in the low prevalence community and by 958 in the high

prevalence community. Increased testing frequency results in a nonlinear decrease in cumulative

infections over time, with daily testing resulting in the fewest cumulative infections at 100 days after

implementing the testing strategy at any of the sensitivities shown. Importantly, at sensitivities of 98%

our models predict that a two-day delay in results (by send-out PCR, for example) will result in a just a

59% reduction in infections experienced at a 14-day testing frequency; however, as the testing

frequency is increased, even with the two-day delay, the number of missed infections goes down

rapidly to over a 99% reduction from no testing at all at a daily testing frequency.

Next we looked at testing strategies that incorporate pooling. Figure 3 combines a weekly and every 3

day testing strategy with 98% sensitive tests with varying time delay, and pooling tests in samples of 2,

5, 10, and 30. Pooling potentially reduces the sensitivity of the tests, resulting in more missed

infections. This can be overcome by an increase in test frequency, allowed by the cost savings of

pooling. Figure 4 weighs cost against testing frequency and pooling size, both with confirmatory and

without confirmatory testing of positive pools. Without confirmatory testing, the cost per person

decreases dramatically.

DISCUSSION
Our findings demonstrate that it is not only critical to choose the right test in terms of performance in

asymptomatic individuals, but to use the test in the defined population at the optimal frequency to

reduce the risk of case escalation. Optimization is further enhanced at the population level by

understanding of underlying disease prevalence and utilization of pooling to reduce cost and increase

efficiency. The “ideal” test strategy must be balanced with the practicalities of cost per person to

ensure sustainability. For example, daily testing with a 60% sensitive test attenuates community

spread, but at a cost of $30.10 per person per day with confirmatory testing, or $20.00 without, may

not be possible. Using a 60% sensitive test less frequently reduces expense but sacrifices significant

performance. A 98% sensitive test with no delay in results administered every 3 days with pooling, and

no confirmatory test offered by the institution costs less than $1.50 per person per day, with high

performance. The model demonstrates that frequency of testing, test sensitivity, turn-around time,

and the external community prevalence are all important factors to consider, and there is often more

than one testing strategy to achieve the desired level of performance. The computational code and an

is available in the online supplement and an easy-to-use web-based simulator is to test various

scenarios at https://calculator.unitedinresearch.com/.

With these scenarios in hand, institutions can make an informed operational choice, devise pods or

cohorts to be tested by pooling and potentially isolated if positive, and create clear communication

about a surveillance rationale. Acknowledging a dynamic community prevalence, the model can be re-

run, and the testing strategy can be optimized to maximize benefit at the lost cost and least amount of

disruption.

The frequency of test usage to minimize amplification of infection and allow schools and worksites to

remain open is an important factor. Given the cost of high frequency testing, we demonstrate the

value of pooling of samples to increase efficiency, particularly in areas with lower population

prevalence. As background prevalence increases, the value of pooling diminishes as the likelihood of a

positive pool will rise, but even a pool of two to three samples results in a dramatic reduction in the

need for individual sample analysis. It is worth noting that with an extremely low prevalence, even in

the case of a 99.5% specific test, false positives are much more likely than true positives and

confirmatory testing may be necessary. A 90% specificity test would result in a large number of false

positives over the course of 100 days. As shown in Figure 4, in order to achieve a minimal cost

approach that includes confirmatory testing, one must balance pool size with frequency. Without

confirmatory testing, costs drop dramatically (Figure 4g, h). More sophisticated confirmatory testing

strategies exist that may lower costs but still reduce the likelihood that uninfected individuals are sent

simulating an abbreviated 80-day semester in a highly-residential college-campus-type setting. Across

all scenarios considered, test frequency was more associated with cumulative infection than test

sensitivity. That modeling exercise also suggested that symptom-based screening alone is insufficient

to contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios considered. Using a model for viral loads in

studied surveillance effectiveness using an agent-based modeling

framework which accounts for test sensitivities, frequency, and sample-to-answer reporting time. The

results indicate that frequency of testing and the speed of reporting are the principal contributors to

surveillance effectiveness. The results also show that the impact of high sensitivity on surveillance

effectiveness is, relatively, small.

asymptomatic cases upon entry but missed potential introductions from staff. Random daily testing

was determined to be, overall, an inefficient use of resources. This points to the opportunity for

pooled testing as an effective and efficient COVID-19 surveillance strategy for long-term care facilities

with limited resources.

Since our work focuses on screening and not performing diagnostic testing, the actual sensitivity of the

various available COVID tests for this purpose is not entirely clear. The original testing approaches for

COVID-19 focused on the high sensitivity required for diagnosis by clinicians in all stages of the acute

period of COVID-19 through detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA performed on patients with a high pretest

probability of disease. This paradigm focused on high sensitivity tests with the performance feature of

very low NAAT detectable units/mL (NDU/mL) with a goal of diagnosing patients even if past the

contagious period. These tests were not optimized nor validated in terms of sensitivity for the

detection of infectious individuals that might spread disease in schools, the workplace or other social

situations.

Several studies looking at the ability to culture virus from samples collected from infected individuals

have established that RNA copy numbers of 1,000,000 RNA copies/ml or higher are required for any

18, 19, 20, 21, 22

consistent success in viral culture.

Based on contact tracing, this defined window of

elevated RNA copy numbers starting 2-3 days prior to onset of symptoms and ending 5-9 days after

symptom onset corresponds to most if not all cases of transmission. Studies of asymptomatic

spreading suggests a very similar window of transmissibility during this period of time when RNA copy

11, 23, 24

numbers are 1,000,000 copies/ml or higher.

Given that RT-PCR testing can have a sensitivity or

LOD as low as <1,000 RNA copies/mL (1,000 NDU), there should ample performance in testing

Our work has a number of limitations. The SIR compartmental model provides a simplified

representation of the natural history of the disease. For example, it does not account for the

distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. In addition, the model assumes uniform

mixing of the population being tested and a uniform distribution of likelihood of a positive test. The

model is formulated at a population level; it does not permit the tracking of individuals. In a low

population prevalence, we expect a high number of false positives given assumed specificities of 99.5%

and 90%. Individuals who recover from the disease are granted permanent immunity in our model,

Figure 1. Schematic of the model. The model simulates testing for a common group of people wh
ho

mix continuously in an institution (i.e., in a school or office) and are subject to the introduction off
infection from the surrounding unmonitored community. The framework couples regular testing,
described by a handful of tunable parameters, to a disease model. The disease model is dynamic in
time, and infections may originate both from inside-the-institution mixing and from the surrounding
community at varying rates depending on prevalence.

Figure 2. Impact of testing frequency. Two scenarios for community prevalence corresponding,
relatively, to low and high rates of imported infections (Panels (a) and (b)). Testing with a test with

98% sensitivity with 0-day resulting delay amidst high and low community prevalence (Panels (c) and

(d)). Testing with a test with 98% sensitivity with 2-day resulting delay amidst high and low community

prevalence (Panels (e) and (f)). Testing with a test with 60% sensitivity with 0-day resulting delay

amidst high and low community prevalence (Panels (g) and (h)). Uncropped figures are available in the

supplement. Purple (dash-dot-dot) corresponds to no testing, orange (solid) to testing every two

weeks, green for testing every week (dash-dot), blue (dash) for testing every 3 days, and red (dot) for

daily testing.

Figure 4. Cost comparison map for various pooling and frequency scenarios with and without
confirmatory testing.*

* Use case of a test with 98% sensitivity and 99.5% specificity with a 2-day result delay costing $100
and a 98% sensitive test with 99.5% specificity and a 0 day result delay costing $120. In (c,d, g, h)

every person in a positive pool is retested for confirmation and in (e, f) no confirmatory testing is

done. We assume all confirmatory tests cost $100. Colors correspond to cost per person per day in

dollars.

* Cost calculation assumes a test with a 98% sensitivity and 0-day delay in returning results costs $120, a 98% sensitive test with a 2-day

delay in results costs $100, an 80% sensitive test costs $50, and a 60% sensitive test costs $20. All (true and false) positive tests are

confirmed using a $100 test. The distribution of positive tests among pooled samples is uniform as is consistent with the homogeneous

mixing assumptions of the SIR model, and we assume everyone in a pool that is positive will undergo a confirmatory test.
