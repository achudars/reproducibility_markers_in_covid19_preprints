Abstract (325/350 words)
Background–Chloroquine (CQ) and Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have recently been
suggested as treatment for the current Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
However, despite their long-term use and only few case reports on adverse effects, CQ
and HCQ are listed as a known risk of the lethal ventricular arrhythmia Torsade de Pointes
and their cardiac safety profile is being questioned. Thus, we aimed to investigate the
electrocardiographic and mortality effects of CQ and HCQ in a primary care population.
Methods–We used Danish health care registers and electrocardiograms (ECGs) from
primary care to define three studies. 1) A paired study of subjects with ECGs before and
during use of CQ/HCQ, 2) a matched ECG study of subjects taking CQ/HCQ compared to
controls, and 3) a mortality study on people taking HCQ matched to control. In both
matched studies, we adjusted for connective tissue diseases, use of QT-prolonging drugs,
and cardiac disease. We used the QTc interval as the marker for electrocardiographic
safety. In the mortality study, cases were followed from first claimed prescription until 300
days after estimated completion of the last prescription. 95% confidence intervals follow
estimates in parenthesis.
Results–Use of CQ was associated with a 5.5 (0.7;10) ms increase in QTc in the paired
study (n=10). In the matched study (n=28, controls=280), QTc was insignificantly
increased in subjects taking CQ by 4.7 (-3.4;13) ms.
With a ΔQTc of 1.0 (-5.6;7.5), use of HCQ was not associated with an increased QTc in
the paired study (n=32). In the matched study (n=172, controls=1,720), QTc also was not
different between groups (p=0.5). In the mortality study (n=3,368), use of HCQ was
associated with a hazard ratio of 0.67 (0.43;1.05).
Conclusions–In subjects free of COVID-19, we found a small increase in QTc associated
with use of chloroquine, but not hydroxychloroquine. We found no increased mortality
associated with use of hydroxychloroquine.

Introduction

The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to investigation and use of
chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of COVID-19. CQ and
HCQ are 4-aminoquinilines approved for medical use in 1949 and 1955, respectively, and
both drugs interfere with important physiological mechanisms that may improve the clinical
course of patients with COVID-19. CQ and HCQ are weak bases and accumulate in
lysosomes increasing pH which interferes with virus entry and fusion(1). CQ and HCQ also
inhibit viral gene expression and post translational modification necessary for viral
replication(1). Furthermore, CQ and HCQ have direct anti-inflammatory actions by
inhibition of B- and T-cell receptors and especially by decreasing TNF-α and cytokine
production (interleukin-1 and interleukin-6)(2). The drawback is that CQ and HCQ have
known cardiotoxic effects(3) including vasodilatation, hypotension, hypokalemia, negative
inotropy, and arrhythmias. The risk of arrhythmias may partly be mediated through the
other cardiotoxic effect and partly due to ion channel blockade. Both CQ and HCQ are
known hERG-blockers, but also block a variety of other ion channels including sodium,
calcium, IK1 potassium and pacemaker funny channels(4). Since CQ and HCQ are old
drugs, the approvals were granted long before thorough QT studies were required and
only limited ECG safety data exists. Despite the known hERG block, there is a paucity of
documented Torsades de Pointes ventricular tachycardia (TdP) during treatment,(5) which
may be attributed to the concomitant calcium block protecting against TdP.(6) Only three
cases of TdP have been published(7-9), all in patients with concomitant morbidities as
cirrhosis, heart failure, or preexisting QT-prolongation.

Only limited electrocardiographic information is available of the effect of CQ/HCQ. A study
of 14 healthy subjects receiving 1.5 g of CQ (normal dose in COVID 0.15 g OD(2)) found
significant prolongation of the QT interval around 20 ms(10). With HCQ there does not
exist any studies with comparable ECG data before and after treatment. Since COVID-19
attacks the heart causing heart failure and even shock, it is unknown whether the
arrhythmias seen in COVID-19 patients treated with HCQ/CQ are secondary to the
disease or caused by the HCA/CQ treatment. Thus, an investigation of the
electrocardiographic and mortality risks associated with CQ/HCQ treatment is needed.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of CQ/HCQ on
electrocardiographic parameters in a large primary care population without COVID-19
using Danish health care registers and electronic ECG data.

Methods

ECG

The primary population consisted of 449,584 patients with 978,901 ECGs from the
Copenhagen General Practitioners’ Laboratory (CGPL). CGPL was the core facility that
received referrals from most General Practitioners in the Copenhagen area from 20012015 for blood sampling and ECG examination. Data from CGPL was linked with Danish
registries for a full patient history and follow-up. The Danish Civil Register contains
information on sex, birthday, and emigration/permanent stays abroad. The Danish
Register of Patient Records contains information on all hospital contacts (in-patient and
out-patient). The Register used International Classification of Diseases, eighth revision

(ICD-8) codes until 1993 and ICD-10 codes from 1994. The Danish Register of Medication
Statistics holds information on every claimed prescription from Danish pharmacies. The
Danish Register of Causes of Death contains information on mortality for all Danish
Citizens.

Using the 12SL algorithm version 23 (GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI), we obtained heart
rate, QT interval, QRS duration, JT interval, PR interval, and presence of Right Bundle
Branch Block (RBBB) or Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB). The QT interval was corrected
with Bazett (QTcB) and Framingham (QTcFrh) formulae. Based on the JT interval, JTc
was obtained by linear correction for heart rate (JTc = JT – 119.4108*(RR-1), whereby RR
is the R-to-R interval in seconds and JT is measured in ms).

Studies and populations

From the primary study population, we defined three subsets, each with a CQ and a HCQ
population: 1) Paired study, 2) Matched study, and 3) Mortality study. As an additional
analysis, we conducted a fourth study on connective tissue diseases with three
populations independent of CQ/HCQ prescriptions.

Paired study

The Paired study is comprised of people with an ECG taken during a period of CQ or HCQ
treatment, respectively, and with a prior baseline ECG without HCQ/CQ treatment. Thus,
in this study, the subjects served as their own controls.

Matched study

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.19.20135475; this version posted June 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint
(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
It is made available under a CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license .

The Matched study is a comparison of subjects with an ECG taken during use of CQ or
HCQ, respectively, compared to a matched reference population with no history of CQ and
HCQ usage, respectively. Matching was done 10:1 on sex and age (rounded to integer
years), sampled without replacement.

Mortality study

The Mortality study is a study of subjects with a prescription of HCQ matched 1:1 to sexand age-matched controls with no prescription. Cases and their matched control were
followed from the day of the first prescription until 300 days after predicted exhaustion of
the last claimed prescription of the case. Since HCQ replaced CQ as the preferred drug in
1995 with some but only few CQ prescriptions thereafter, the mortality study was not
performed in the CQ group due to lack of power.

RA/SLE/SS study

The RA/SLE/SS study included subjects with and without rheumatoid arthritis (RA),
systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), and Sjögren’s syndrome (SS), respectively. As in the
Matched study on CQ and HCQ, we identified subjects with a diagnosis of RA, SLE, or SS,
respectively, and matched them 1:1, 3:1, and 2:1 to controls, respectively, on sex and age
(rounded to integer years), sampled without replacement.

Medication and comorbidity

Using Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes, we identified use of CQ and HCQ.
SLE, RA, SS, and ischemic heart disease were defined using the International

Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10). Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and
congestive heart failure were all defined using a combination of ICD-10 and ATC codes at
baseline as done previously.(11) Exact definitions using ICD-10 and ATC codes are given
in the Supplementary Material. Use of QT-prolonging drugs was defined as concomitant
prescription of one of the 63 drugs listed on CredibleMeds.org on April 30th 2020 as having
a known risk of Torsade des Pointes (TdP, a possibly lethal polymorphic form of
ventricular tachycardia) except for CQ and HCQ (see the Supplementary Material for the
full list).

Statistical considerations

For subjects in the paired population, subjects served as their own controls and the results
were thus inherently adjusted for comorbidity, age, and sex. We adjusted for a change in
use of QT-prolonging drugs where appropriate. We used a random-effects regression
model for continuous variables.

For subjects in the matched population, we compared continuous electrocardiographic
variables using linear regression crudely as well as with adjustment for RA, SLE, SS, use
of QT-prolonging drugs, hypertension, ischemic heart disease congestive heart failure, and
diabetes mellitus, as appropriate. Categorical variables were tested using a two-sample
test of proportions.

For subjects in the mortality population, we used Cox regression with full adjustment as
with the matched population, as appropriate. Subjects were censored upon emigration

individually or 300 days after the last claimed prescription for each case/control pair. We
used time-on-study as underlying time variable in the Cox model.

The Danish Data Protection Agency approved the use of de-identified data (2007-58-0015)
on the conditions that the exact number of subjects in groups of < 3 subjects not be
disclosed and that no calculations (including p-values) be reported on groups of < 5
subjects. All estimates were reported along with a 95 % confidence interval indicated as
(lower to upper). Data management and statistical computations were performed in Stata
(version 16), and a p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results

Paired study

We identified ten subjects who had an ECG taken during a treatment of CQ and who had a
prior ECG without treatment of CQ (Table 1, CQ population). Similarly, for treatment with
HCQ, we identified 32 subjects (Table 1, HCQ population).

Compared to their baseline ECG, subjects taking CQ had a significantly longer QTcFrh by
5.5 ms (0.7 to 10, p=0.03). We found no evidence of an increased QTcFrh after use of
HCQ (1.0 ms, -5.6 to 7.5 ms, p=0.8).

Matched study

We identified 28 and 172 subjects with an ECG taken during a period of treatment with CQ
or HCQ, respectively, and matched them 10:1 with controls.

Subjects on CQ (Table 2), compared to controls, were more likely to suffer from ischemic
heart disease, but not hypertension. With full adjustment for RA, SLE, SS, QT-prolonging
drugs, hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, and congestive heart failure,
QTcFrh was 4.7 ms longer in the CQ group compared to control, but with a wide
confidence interval (-3.4 to 13 ms, p=0.3).

Subjects on HCQ (Table 3) more often than controls had RA, SLE or SS, as well as
hypertension, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, and diabetes. In the
unadjusted analysis, we found an increased QTcFrh interval of 5 ms (p=0.002). However,

after adjustment for RA, SLE, SS and QT-prolonging drugs, there was no significant
difference in QTcFrh between cases and controls (3.1 ms, -1.1 to 7.3 ms, p=0.15) and
after additional adjustment for ischemic heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and
congestive heart failure, the difference in QTcFrh was reduced further to 1.3 ms (-2.9 to
5.6, p=0.5). QRS duration followed a similar pattern in the adjusted and unadjusted
analyses, whereas the JT interval also in the unadjusted analysis was comparable
between the groups.

Mortality study

We identified 3,368 subjects with a prescription for HCQ irrespective of an ECG (Table 4).

Subjects on HCQ were more likely to have RA, SLE, SS, hypertension, ischemic heart
disease, and congestive heart failure. In the most crude analysis, adjusted only for sex and
age, mortality was not different between subjects on HCQ and controls (HR=1.20, 0.85 to
1.71, p=0.3). With adjustment for RA, SLE, SS, and use of other QT-prolonging drugs, we
still found no significant difference between Hydroxychloroquine and matched controls
(HR=0.80, 0.51 to 1.26, p=0.3). Further adjustment for ischemic heart disease, diabetes,
hypertension, and congestive heart failure did not change the association materially.
Kaplan-Meier survival curves are shown in Figure 1.

RA/SLE/SS study

In the RA/SLE/SS study we defined three populations of cases and controls with and
without RA, SLE, and SS respectively. We found no difference in crude or adjusted
QTcFrh compared to control in any of the populations (Supplementary Tables 1-3). Heart
rate was significantly higher in subjects with RA and SLE, but lower in subjects with SS.
Crude PR interval was increased in subjects with SS, but not with adjustment for diabetes,
ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and congestive heart failure. In the fully adjusted
adjusted for sex, age, SS, SLE, QT-prolonging drugs, ischemic heart disease, diabetes,
hypertension, and congestive heart failure, patients with RA had a shorter QRS duration
compared to controls.

Discussion

In this real-world study, we found a small, but significant, heart rate-corrected
QT-prolongation of 5 ms with CQ, but no QT prolongation with HCQ. We did not find
increased mortality in subjects taking CQ or HCQ.

Electrocardiographic safety

CQ and HCQ are both listed as known causes of TdP on CredibleMeds.org,(12) and CQ is
recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as prolonging the QT/QTc interval.(5)
However, WHO states that CQ is associated with a low risk of cardiotoxicity based on
PK/PD modelling.(5) In the present study, we found an increase in QTcFrh of 5.5 ms in the

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.19.20135475; this version posted June 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

paired CQ population, and no difference the paired HCQ population. Another study(10)
showed that a 1,500 mg dose of CQ yielded an increase in QTc of 15-30 ms.

Matched on sex and age, subjects receiving HCQ showed a 5 ms increase in QTcFrh.
However, the increased QTc disappeared upon adjustment for use of QT-prolonging
medication and connective tissue diseases. Hence, the increased QTcFrh was likely
caused by rheumatic disease and not HCQ. Thus, in both the matched and the paired
analyses, we were unable to demonstrate any statistically significant increase in QTc
associated with use of HCQ.

Mortality

We did not find that use of HCQ was associated with an increased mortality. This is not
surprising, since the toxicology profile of HCQ is better than that of CQ.(13) WHO reports
that the few deaths associated with use of HCQ were caused by overdosing and chronic
indications for HCQ.(5)

Only three case studies have demonstrated arrhythmic adverse events in association with
use of CQ/HCQ. One study(7) involved a syncope in a patient with SLE and end stage
renal disease and QT prolongation before HCQ initiation. Another study(8) documents TdP
in a patient with SLE, with a history of cirrhosis, HBV-related hepatoma, prior myocardial
infarction, and ventricular septal defect. The third study(9) involved a patient with SLE,
who also suffered from Congestive Heart Failure, Chronic Kidney Disease stage 5, and
Hypertension. All three case studies thus features patients with severe QT-prolonging
comorbidity and chronic rather than episodic use of Hydroxychloroquine. Collectively,

evidence from the present and other studies found little risk of death or arrhythmic events
associated with episodic use of HCQ.

Indication for HCQ

Malaria was and still remains an indication for HCQ in Denmark, although it is no longer
recommended.(14) HCQ is commonly prescribed for connective tissue diseases such as
Rheumatoid Arthritis, Systemic Lupus Erythematous, and Sjögren’s Syndrome. We were
only able to identify the reason for the HCQ treatment in forty to sixty percent of the cases,
likely because milder connective tissue cases were treated in primary care and therefore
never obtained a hospital ICD-10 diagnosis detectable in our registries. Furthermore,
some subjects may have been prescribed HCQ as malaria prophylaxis.

CQ and HCQ for treatment of COVID-19

CQ/HCQ has emerged as a possible treatment for COVID-19.(15) Naturally, given the
known risk of increased QTc, concerns about the safety of the drugs have been raised.(16,
17) We have found different electrocardiographic safety profiles for CQ and HCQ. With
CQ, we have demonstrated an increased QTcFrh of 5.5 ms. With HCQ, we found no
increase in QTcFrh. For use of CQ and HCQ, respectively, we found no increased
mortality.

CQ and HCQ have been used as malaria prophylaxis for decades without raising red flags
and the use of HCQ in higher doses to treat auto-immune diseases also has not been

associated with an increased mortality. The few case studies that exist were associated
with chronic use of HCQ beyond the duration corresponding to a COVID-19 treatment and
with severe QT-prolonging comorbidity.

Arrhythmias are commonly seen in patients with COVID-19 (one study(18) reports 17 %)
independently of treatment with CQ, HCQ, or azithromycin. The virus likely attacks the
myocardium directly due to the high prevalence of angiotensin converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) receptors in the heart.(19) Shi et al. found cardiac lesions (based on highsensitivity Troponin I) in 20 % of COVID-19 patient on admission.(20) There is no solid
evidence for any significant proarrhythmic effects of CQ or HCQ. However, COVID-19 may
play a super additive role in the safety profile of CQ/HCQ, and that can only be assessed
with randomized studies on CQ/HCQ.

The present study found no grounds for concern for HCQ and minor cautions for CQ in
patients free of COVID-19. Saleh et al.(21) in 200 COVID-19 patients treated with
CQ/HCQ plus 60 % azithromycin, found no cases of TdP, although seven patients
discontinued treatment due to QT-prolongation. Mercuro et al.(16) found one case of TdP
in 90 patients treated with HCQ or HCQ+azithromycin. Bessière et al.(17) found no cases
of TdP in 40 patients treated with HCQ plus/minus azithromycin. A limitation of the present
study is that we cannot exclude an interaction between COVID-19 and CQ/HCQ treatment,
and thus further studies – preferably randomized clinical trials – are needed to assess the
cardiac safety of CQ/HCQ in patients with COVID-19.

Using matched and paired studies of subjects free of COVID-19 receiving chloroquine or
hydroxychloroquine, we found that use of chloroquine but not hydroxychloroquine was
associated with a small increase in QTc. We were unable to show increased mortality
associated with hydroxychloroquine.

Jørgen K. Kanters

Supplemental methods

Use of Chloroquine was defined when a prescription for Chloroquine (ATC code:
P01BA01) was claimed.
Use of Hydroxycloroquine was defined in the same way using ATC code P01BA02.
Systemic Lupus Erythematous was defined as any of the ICD-10 codes DM32, DG058A,
DG737C, DI328B, DI398C, DJ991C, or DN085A, or either ICD-8 code 695.4 or 734.1.
Rheumatoid Arthritis was defined as any of the ICD-10 codes DM05 or DM06, or any of
the ICD-8 codes 712.0, 712.1, or 712.3.
Ischemic heart disease was defined as any of the ICD-10 codes I20, I21, I23, I24, I25 or
the ICD-8 code 410.
Diabetes mellitus was defined as any of the ICD-10 codes E10, E11, E12, E13 or E14, or
use of insulin (ATC: A10A) or oral antidiabetics (ATC: A10B), or the ICD-8 code 761.1.
Hypertension was present if any of the ICD-10 codes I10 or I15, or the ICD-8 code 401
was found, or if we found concurrent use of two of these classes of medication: alpha
blockers (ATC: C02A, C02B, C02C), non-loop diuretics (ATC: C02L, C03A, C03B, C03D,
C03E, C03X, C07X, C07C, C07D, C08G, C02DA, C09BA, C09DA, C09XA52),
vasodilators (ATC: C02DB, C02DD, C02DG, C04, C05), beta blockers (ATC: C07),
calcium blockers (ATC: C08, C09BB, C09DB), or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors
(ATC: C09).
Heart failure was present if the ICD-10 codes I42, I50, or J81, or the ICD-8 code 427.0
was found, or if a prescription of loop diuretics (ATC: C03C) was found.
The following drugs and ATC codes were considered QT-prolonging in the present study. The list
was taken from CredibleMeds.org on April 30, 2020 (revision March 19, 2020), and is comprised of
those drugs categorized as having a known risk of Torsade de Pointes (TdP), with the omissions of
Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine.
