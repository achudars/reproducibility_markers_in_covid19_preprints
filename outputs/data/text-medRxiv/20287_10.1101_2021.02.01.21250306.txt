Summary boxes
What is already known on this topic?
•

Rapid scoring systems may be very useful for fast and effective assessment of
COVID-19 patients in the emergency department.

•

The majority of available scores have high risk of bias and lack benefit to
clinical decision making.

•

Derivation and validation studies in low- and middle-income countries,
including Latin America, are scarce.

What this study adds
•

ABC2-SPH employs seven well defined variables, routinely assessed upon
hospital presentation: age, number of comorbidities, blood urea nitrogen, C
reactive protein, Spo2/FiO2 ratio, platelets and heart rate.

•

This easy-to-use risk score identified four categories at increasing risk of death
with a high level of accuracy, and displayed better discrimination ability than
other existing scores.

•

A free web-based calculator is available and may help healthcare practitioners to
estimate the expected risk of mortality for patients at hospital presentation.

Abstract
Objective: To develop and validate a rapid scoring system at hospital admission for
predicting in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 19
(COVID-19), and to compare this score with other existing ones.
Design: Cohort study
Setting: The Brazilian COVID-19 Registry has been conducted in 36 Brazilian
hospitals in 17 cities. Logistic regression analysis was performed to develop a
prediction model for in-hospital mortality, based on the 3978 patients that were
admitted between March-July, 2020. The model was then validated in the 1054 patients
admitted during August-September, as well as in an external cohort of 474 Spanish
patients.
Participants: Consecutive symptomatic patients (≥18 years old) with laboratory
confirmed COVID-19 admitted to participating hospitals. Patients who were transferred
between hospitals and in whom admission data from the first hospital or the last hospital
were not available were excluded, as well those who were admitted for other reasons
and developed COVID-19 symptoms during their stay.
Main outcome measures: In-hospital mortality
Results: Median (25th-75th percentile) age of the model-derivation cohort was 60 (4872) years, 53.8% were men, in-hospital mortality was 20.3%. The validation cohorts
had similar age distribution and in-hospital mortality. From 20 potential predictors,
seven significant variables were included in the in-hospital mortality risk score: age,
blood urea nitrogen, number of comorbidities, C-reactive protein, SpO2/FiO2 ratio,
platelet count and heart rate. The model had high discriminatory value (AUROC 0.844,
95% CI 0.829 to 0.859), which was confirmed in the Brazilian (0.859) and Spanish
(0.899) validation cohorts. Our ABC2-SPH score showed good calibration in both
Brazilian cohorts, but, in the Spanish cohort, mortality was somewhat underestimated in
patients with very high (>25%) risk. The ABC2-SPH score is implemented in a freely
available online risk calculator (https://abc2sph.com/).
Conclusions: We designed and validated an easy-to-use rapid scoring system based on
characteristics of COVID-19 patients commonly available at hospital presentation, for
early stratification for in-hospital mortality risk of patients with COVID-19.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is
still the main global health, social and economic challenge, overwhelming health care
systems in many countries and heavily burdening others, with over 102 million cases
and 2.2 million deaths worldwide.1,2 While some countries have been declining in new
cases, many others have been experiencing a worse surge of the disease than the first
wave. Latin America is currently worst-hit region of COVID-19 cases in the world,
along with Asia.

3,4

Case rates continue to rise, and some hospitals are nearly at their

full capacity of intensive care unit beds. The emergence of the new variants of SARSCoV-2 in England, South Africa and Brazil, with very high viral growth, potentially
more transmissible, less detectable with the RT-PCR technique and an unknown
response to the available vaccines, is currently a cause of huge concern5-7.
Fast and efficient assessment of prognosis of the disease is needed to optimize
the allocation of health care and human resources, to empower early identification and
intervention of patients at higher risk of poor outcome. A proper assessment tool will
guide decision making to develop an appropriate plan of care for each patient8. In this
context, rapid scoring systems, which combine different variables to estimate the risk of
a poor outcome, may be extremely helpful for quick and effective assessment of those
patients in the emergency department9.
Although different scoring systems have been proposed to assess prognosis in
COVID-19 patients, the majority of them lack benefit to clinical decision making, and
there is a lack of reliable prognostic prediction models10,11. Most scores were developed
from small cohorts, at high risk for bias, with selected study samples and relatively few
outcome events, without clear details of model derivation and validation, as well as
unclear reporting on intended use12-16. These issues lead to a high risk of model
overfitting, thus their predictive performance when used in clinical practice may be
different than that reported.11,12 Additionally, clinical characteristics of COVID-19
patients and disease severity vary in different studies in different countries17, and
external validation was rarely done. Derivation and validation studies in low- and
middle-income countries, including Latin America, are scarce11.
In this context, our aim was to develop and validate an easy applicable rapid
scoring system that employs routinely available clinical and laboratory data at hospital
presentation, to predict in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19, able to

discriminate high vs non-high risk patients. Additionally, we aimed to compare this
score with other existing ones.

Methods
This study is part of the Brazilian COVID-19 Registry, an ongoing multicenter
observational study described elsewhere18, and a collaboration with Vall d’Hebron
University Hospital, in Barcelona, Spain, for independent external validation. The
Brazilian COVID-19 Registry is being conducted according to a predefined protocol, in
36 Brazilian hospitals, located in 17 cities, from four Brazilian states. With regards to
the type of hospital, 25 are reference centers for COVID-19 treatment and 19 are
academic hospitals. Eighteen are public hospitals; seven are private; and eleven are
“mixed”, hospitals that provide both public and private services. The median number of
hospital beds was 316 (ranging from 60 to 936), and the median number of ICU beds
for COVID patients was 22 (ranging from 0 to 105).
Model development, validation and reporting followed guidance from the
Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prediction or
Diagnosis (TRIPOD) checklist and Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool
(PROBAST) (Supplementary Material)19,20.

Study subjects
Consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the
participating hospitals from March 1 to September 30, 2020 were enrolled. COVID-19
diagnosis was confirmed according to the World Health Organization guidance21. For
the purpose of the present study, eligible patients were ≥18 years-old and had completed
hospitalization (i.e., discharge or death). Patients who were transferred between
hospitals and admission data from the first hospital (as we aimed to develop a score to
be used in the first assessment) or the last hospital was not available were excluded, as
well those who were admitted for other reasons and developed COVID-19 symptoms
during their stay (as their information from the first assessment would be biased, and
their profile is different from the other patients ) (Figure 1). Those who were admitted
for other reasons were excluded. Although patients who were transferred to another
hospital where we could not get the final outcome were excluded, a comparison of the

clinical characteristics with patients who were included is provided in the Supplemental
Material (Table S1).

Measurement
Demographic information, clinical characteristics, laboratory and outcome data
were collected from the medical records by using a prespecified case report form
applying Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tools22,23 hosted at the Telehealth
Center, University Hospital, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais. Data were
collected by trained hospital staff or interns. A detailed data management plan (DMP)
was developed and provided to all participating centers. An online DMP training was
mandatory before local research personnel were allowed to start collecting study data24.

Data quality assessment
We undertook comprehensive data quality checks to ensure high quality. A code
was developed in R software to identify values likely related to data entry errors for
vital signs and laboratory variables, based on expert-guided rules. Data were sent to
each center for checking and correction. Transfers from one participant hospital to
another were merged and considered as a single visit.

Potential predictors for in-hospital mortality
All variables used to calculate the risk score were obtained at hospital admission.
A set of potential predictor variables for in-hospital mortality was selected a priori, as
recommended19, taking into account the evidence in literature of association with worse
prognosis in patients with COVID-19 or pneumonia, and availability of predictor
measurement at the time the model would be used, i.e., hospital admission. We
considered predictors that would be available in routine practice in most emergency
departments worldwide. It included patient demographic characteristics, pre-existing
comorbid medical conditions, home medications, clinical assessment at admission and
laboratory data

12

. All laboratory tests were performed at the discretion of the treating

physician. Imaging test results were not included, as X-ray and CT scan are not always
performed at patient admission and their interpretation involve subjective judgement.

Candidate predictor variables which were not available for at least two thirds of
patients within the derivation cohort (more than one third of missing data) were
excluded.

Data analysis
Continuous variables were summarized using medians and interquartile ranges
(IQR), whereas we used counts and percentages for categorical variables. We reported
95% confidence intervals, and for all two-tailed-tests performed, a p-value less than
0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed with R
software (version 4.0.2) with the mgcv, finalfit, mice, glmnet, pROC, rms, rmda, and
psfmi packages. Details about how missing data were handled, as well as modelbuilding and model-validation procedures, are described below.

Missing data
Considering missing at random after analyzing missing data patterns, multiple
imputation with chained equations (MICE) was used to handle missing values only on
candidate variables (outcomes were not imputed). Outcome variable was considered as
a predictor only in the derivation dataset. We used predictive mean matching (PMM)
method for continuous predictors and polytomous regression for categorical variables
(two or more unordered levels). The results of 10 imputed datasets, each with 10
iterations, were combined following Rubin’s rules25.

Development of the risk score model
Patients who were admitted before July 31 were included in the development
cohort. First, we conducted predictor selection based on clinical reasoning and literature
review before modeling. Second, generalized additive models (GAM) were used to
examine the relationships between in-hospital mortality and continuous (through
penalized thin plate splines) and categorical (as linear components) predictors. During
this stage, variable selection was based on D1- (multivariate Wald test) and D2-statistic
(pools test statistics from the repeated analyses).
Third, for an easier application of the risk score model at bedside, continuous
variables were categorized based on widely accepted cut points, current evidence and/or

Lastly, we used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic
regression to derive the mortality score by scaling the (L1 penalized) shrunk
coefficients. The penalty parameter λ in LASSO was chosen using 10-fold crossvalidation methods based on mean squared error criterion.
Risk groups were proposed based on predicted probabilities: low risk ( < 6.0%),
intermediate risk (6.0 – 14.9%), high risk (15.0 – 49.9%), and very high risk (≥ 50.0%).
External validation
We performed an external (temporal) validation analysis using patients who
were admitted from August 1 to September 30, 2020. The same investigators collected
those data, and missing data were handle as described above.
Independent external validation was also performed in a cohort of patients from
Vall d’Hebron University Hospital (Vall d’Hebron COVID-19 Prospective Cohort
Study), a 1100-bed public tertiary care hospital with the capacity for more than 60 ICU
beds, in Barcelona, Spain26, part of the public hospital network of the Catalan Health
System. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were the same as the beforementioned ones.
All patients included were followed for at least 28 days.

Performance measures
We evaluated overall performance using Brier score27. Calibration was assessed
graphically by plotting the predicted mortality probabilities against the observed
mortality, testing intercept equals 0 and slope equals 1. The area under the curve for
receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) described model’s discrimination, i.e, its
ability to predict higher risks for individuals who died than for those who were
discharged. Confidence intervals (95% CI) for AUROC were obtained through 2000
bootstrap samples. We also calculated positive and negative predictive values of the
derived risk groups.
Model comparisons
The developed model was compared within the validation cohort with existing
rapid scores systems for in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. These scores were
identified through a literature search of Medline, medRxiv and BioRxiv, with no
language or date restrictions, using the search terms “COVID-19,” “COVID”, “SARSCoV-2,” “coronavirus” combined with “score” and “mortality”. The last search was

performed on November 19, 2020. Two authors independently performed article
selection and data extraction. Additionally, we also included established scores for
pneumonia and sepsis28-32.
From the set of identified scores, we selected those which with predictors were
available within the database and had accessible methods for calculation. Model
comparisons were performed using AUROC and decision curve analysis, which
describes clinical utility across a range of threshold risks, i.e, the relative value of
benefits (if a true positive case is treated) and harms (if a false positive case is treated).

ABC2-SPH risk score calculator
Risk score calculator was developed in Javascipt, using the Svelte framework
while the website was developed in R language (blogdown package).

Ethics
The study protocol conforms to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of
Helsinki. It was approved by the Brazilian National Commission for Research Ethics
(CAAE 30350820.5.1001.0008) Individual informed consent was waived due to the
severity of the situation and the use of deidentified data, based on medical chart review
only. For the independent external validation cohort, it was approved by the and Vall
d’Hebron University Hospital Research Ethics Committee (PR(AG)183/2020). The
institutional review board granted an informed consent waiver if patients were unable to
give oral consent.

Patient and public involvement
This was an urgent public health research study in response to a Public Health
Emergency of International Concern. Patients or the public were not involved in the
design, conduct, interpretation or presentation of results of this research.
Results
The derivation cohort comprehended data from 3978 patients, from 267 cities of
13 states in Brazil (Figure 2). The median age was 60 [IQR, 48-72] years, 2138 (53.8%)
were male, 2789 (70.1%) had at least one comorbidity and 806 (20.3%) died during
hospitalization. The median follow-up time was 7 (4-14) days. Table 1 shows

demographic, clinical characteristics and laboratory findings for the derivation and
validation datasets.

Development of the risk score model
Thirty-six potential predictor variables were identified (Table S2). Number of
comorbidities was created as a composite of ten individual comorbidities shown to have
prognostic impact in COVID-9 (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, coronary
artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation or flutter, cirrhosis, cancer and previous
stroke)33,34, as in other scores35,36. Twelve variables were excluded due to the excessive
number of missing values, two for high collinearity, and one was not recorded within
database. Besides that, inotrope use was combined with blood pressure. Therefore, 20
variables were tested.
Through generalized additive model (GAM), a combination of seven variables
was selected as the best predictor of in hospital mortality (Table S3). For an easier
application to the risk score model at bedside, continuous selected predictors were
categorized for LASSO logistic regression. All categories were defined a priori, as
recommended,20 based on widely accepted cut points, current evidence and/or
categories defined in stablished rapid scoring systems from pneumonia and sepsis, as
follows: advanced age (60-69.9, 70-79.9 and ≥ 80 years), Spo2/Fio2 (SF) ratio (≤ 150.0,
9

150.1 – 235.0, 235.1 – 315.0, > 315.0), platelet count (<100x10 /L, 100-150x10 /L, >

150x109/L), C-reactive protein (≥100mg/L), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (≥42mg/dL),
heart rate (≤ 90, 91-130, ≥ 131 bpm).
All variables were statistically significant predictors for in hospital mortality
(Table S4 and Figure S1). Shrunk coefficients were scaled to provide a prognostic index
and we denoted it as the ABC2-SPH risk score (Table 2). The sum of the prediction
scores ranges between 0 and 20, with a high score indicating higher risk of in-hospital
mortality.
Risk groups were proposed based on predicted probabilities (Table 3): low risk
(0-1 score, observed in hospital mortality 2.0%), intermediate risk (2-4 score, 11.4%),
high risk (5-8 score, 32.0%), and very high risk (≥ 9 score, 69.4%). Subject-specific
risks can be assessed using the developed ABC2-SPH risk score Web-based calculator
(https://abc2sph.com/), freely available to the public.

As well as GAM and LASSO, ABC2-SPH risk score showed good overall
performance (Brier score: 0.114) and good discrimination (AUROC equal 0.842; 95%
CI 0.840–0.843) within the derivation cohort (Table 4).

External validation – Brazilian cohort
A total of 1054 patients were included in the validation cohort. The median age was

62 (interquartile range 48-73) years, 582 (55.2%) were male and 745 (70.7%) had at
least one comorbidity. The median follow-up time was 7 (4-13) days. Two hundred and
eight patients (19.7%) died during hospitalization. The distribution of patients across
range ABC2-SPH Score in derivation and validation cohorts are presented in Figure 3.
We observed good discrimination (AUROC equal 0.859; 95% CI 0.833 to 0.885;
Figure 4), overall performance (Brier = 0.108) and calibration (slope = 1.138, intercept
= 0.114, p-value = 0.184; Figure S2a) of the ABC2-SPH risk score under the validation
cohort (Figure 4). The good performance is also demonstrated in sensitivity analyses
using complete case data (Table S5).
Low, intermediate and high-risk groups showed good negative predictive values
(99.7%, 88.1% and 71.0%, respectively). A positive predictive value of 73.7% was
observed in patients classified as at very high mortality risk.

External validation – Spanish cohort
A second external (geographic) validation was performed within a Spanish
cohort with 474 patients and 82 (17,3%) in hospital mortality. The demographic and
clinical characteristics at admission are listed in Table 1. The median follow-up time
was 21 (IQR, 7-40) days. Only complete cases were included.
ABC2-SPH Score showed high discrimination (AUROC= 0.899, 95% CI 0.864
to 0.934; Figure 4), good overall performance (Brier = 0.093), but an underestimation of
true mortality risk in patients with a predicted probability above 25% (intercept = 0.729,
slope = 1.519, p-value = 0.001; Figure S2b).

Literature review
The literature search identified 39 scores to predict mortality in COVID-19
patients (Table 5). Most of them were still preprints (28%), in 36% the derivation cohort
was from China, 21% from the United States and none from South America.

Multivariate logistic regression and LASSO regression were used in 16 and 10 studies,
respectively, artificial intelligence techniques in seven studies and Cox regression
analysis in 3 studies. Two scores were developed by consensus. The population of the
development cohort was composed by adults-only in 51.3% of the studies, the age range
was not clear in 41.4% and elderly patients in one of them. Thirteen studies developed
points-based scores, three were published as nomograms and all the other ones required
formulas for calculation.
From the 27 (69.2%) developed scores to predict in-hospital mortality, in three
studies the full information required for proper calculation was not available, in five
studies the assay used for D-dimer or troponin was not described to allow proper
comparison, in two studies the variables were not clearly defined (such as “kidney
failure”, “elevated” CPR, and “cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidity”), in two the
variables were not applicable for other populations (such as province and coming from
Wuhan), and in 12 one or more variables required were not in our study protocol.

Comparison with other scores
Based on complete case validation cohort, the ABC2-SPH score achieved better
discrimination (Table 6, Figure 5a) than other prediction scoring systems for COVID19, pneumonia and sepsis (0.85; 95%CI: 0.82 – 0.88). Xie’s and Zhang’s score8,37,38
showed good discrimination, but the number of complete cases and deaths were
relatively small. Considering clinical utility (Figure 5b), ABC2-SPH showed a better
performance compared to the two most discriminating scores for in-hospital mortality
that were tested in more than 700 patients (A-DROP and CURB-6529). COVID-AID-7
and COVID-AID-14 were not included, as they have assessed 7 and 14 day-mortality,
respectively, and not in-hospital).

Discussion
Main findings
ABC2-SPH score is simple, objective, easily available at hospital admission and
easily calculated, employing seven well defined and routinely recordable variables: age,
blood urea nitrogen, number of comorbidities, C-reactive protein, SpO2/FiO2 ratio,
platelet count, heart rate. It has shown to be a reliable tool to estimate in-hospital

mortality in COVID-19 patients, although true mortality risk is somewhat
underestimated in very high risk patients. Model performance compared surpassed other
existing scores.
The pandemic of COVID-19 disease has inflicted a heavy burden on the
healthcare system of numerous countries. Little is known about how long the immune
system will remain protective after vaccination or recovery from infection, and
scientists have been predicting that SARS-CoV-2 “is here for the long haul”39.
Therefore, it is of utmost importance to better identify those patients with higher risk of
mortality, to inform early interventions and the need of more frequent repetitive
assessments, to reduce the risk of death.
Comparison with other studies
The majority of developed scores are limited by methodological bias in
development cohorts.
Our prediction model was developed based on a large sample size of consecutive
adult patients with confirmed COVID-19, from hospitals of different sizes, types and
locations, to minimize the selection bias. Robust models require large sample sizes,
which produce more reliable and accurate results19. It is estimated that 10-15 outcome
events per predictor are required40. Among the models analyzed for comparison, only
30.8% used a sample with more than 1000 patients, 41.0% used a sample with less than
500 patients, and 41.0% were developed and validated in a sample with less than 100
events.
All studies have missing data19, this reality may be due to lack of standardization
of the necessary exams at hospital admission, and differences in resources available in
hospitals for carrying out tests. The approach of excluding the missing data and
performing the analysis with the complete cases can lead to biased results, since the
complete cases may not adequately represent the entire original study sample,
generating a selection bias19. To avoid this type of bias, in our model multiple
imputation with chained equations (MICE) was used to handle missing values on
potential predictors, where the foul was assumed at random. Most of the models we
analyzed for comparison (69.2%) did not perform or did not describe whether
imputation methods were used for the missing data, therefore, there is a high risk of bias
related to the treatment of missing data.

As the accuracy of a prediction model is always high whether the model is
validated on the development cohort used to derive the model only, the assessment of
accuracy in those studies may be overoptimistic. It is important that studies that develop
prediction models use some validation method to quantify any optimism in the
predictive performance of the model developed and adjust the model for overfitting19. In
43.6% of the analyzed studies, external validation of the developed model was not
performed. External validation is highly recommended to assess the performance of a
prediction model on other participant data that was not used for the development of the
model19.
Previous studies have observed the variables included in the ABC2-SPH score as
risk factors for severe COVID-19, what shows that our results are in line with the
available evidence. Age and number of comorbidities were reported as independent risk
factors for developing severe COVID and mortality in several publications10,36,41. The
strong age gradient per decade after 60 years-old is in line with other series10,14. One of
the main causes of death in COVID-19 patients is the unregulated immune response,
with an uncontrolled production and secretion of cytokines. Aging is associated with a
well-known decline in the adaptive and innate immunity, which plays a major role in
the increased susceptibility of infections42. Age-related immune imbalance is also
related to an increased severity in pro-inflammatory response and increased cytokine
production, what is believed to increase patient vulnerability to the unregulated
inflammatory response in COVID-1943. Other authors hypothesize that decreased lung
elasticity, increased end-expiratory and abnormal alveolar integrity related to lung
senescence, which may be associated to kidney senescence play a role in the
predisposition for severe COVID-19 and mortality10.
It is important to highlight the evidence of a decreased antibody production
following immunization in the elderly, as well as shortened duration of protective
immunity43. This might be the case for COVID-19 as well. Therefore, even being a
priority group for the vaccine, this age group will probably remain a major risk factor
for mortality.
The number of comorbidities indicates the importance of pre-existing conditions
to the severity of COVID-19. Even though comorbidities are age-dependent factors, the
number of comorbidities remained as an independent risk factor in the final model.

As we aimed to use variables easily available at ED admission of any institution,
we opted to evaluate the ratio of peripheral oxygen saturation over the inspired fraction
of oxygen (SpO2/FiO2, SF ratio), instead of the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure
over the fraction of inspired oxygen, like the COVID-AID score44. Arterial blood gas
puncture and analysis is an invasive and complex procedure, which may be time
consuming for the team. Additionally, a recent publication highlighted that despite
widespread familiarity with use of PaO2/FiO2 ratio using blood gas analysis, clinical
recognition of acute respiratory distress syndrome remains poor45. The authors assessed
28,758 mechanical SF ratio and PaO2/FiO2 ratio in mechanical ventilated patients, and
observed that PaO2/FiO2 ratios were substantially less available or even unavailable in a
significant proportion of ventilated patients45. SF ratio was already validated as a
substitute for the PaO2/FiO2 ratio in assessing the oxygenation criterion of patients with
acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome46.
COVID-19 associated hyperinflammation and coagulopathy are correlated to
with a wide deviation in various inflammatory markers and hemostasis parameters,
including C-reactive protein, thrombocytopenia, D-dimer and prothrombin time, and
thus these are potential prognostic markers of increased mortality in COVID-1947,48.

The prognostic value of thrombocytopenia in patients with COVID-19 has
shown in a recent meta-analysis53, and it was also included in other scores10,51. The
exact explanation is still unknown, and it is probably multifactorial, related to direct
infection of bone marrow cells by the virus, resulting in abnormal hematopoiesis;
platelet destruction by the immune system; endothelial damage triggering platelet
activation, aggregation and microthrombi in the lung; and abnormal platelet
defragmentation in the lungs53.
A recent meta-analysis of 16 studies, which included 2783 surviving and 697
non-surviving cases, has shown significantly higher levels of D-dimer on admission in
patients who died compared to the ones who were discharged47. This exam was
included as a predictor in different scores13,16,52,54,55. Although D-dimer was collected in

our study, D-dimer assays varied widely among different hospitals. Ideally, the value
has to be determined with the same methodology, preferably from the same
manufacturer, and this information was not available in any of the studies.
A recent publication highlighted confusion and potential for misinformation in
reporting D-dimer data in COVID-1956. The authors emphasized that the considerable
variation in reporting units for D-dimer is potentially under-recognized in various
studies, with at least 28 potential theoretical combinations of measuring units for Ddimer, either D-dimer units (DDU) or fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU), which are
approximately 2× those of DDU. There is also possibility for misreporting of D-dimer
data based on poor or incomplete reporting. The authors provided examples of serious
errors in the reported values and/or units as reported in the literature related to COVID19, even in high impact journals.
Most studies have not reported how they dealt with cases who were transferred
between hospitals. Although SOFA scores tend to be low at hospital admission, Zhou et
al57 observed that age, SOFA score and D-dimer at admission were independent risk
factors for mortality. However, they opted to include those patients, even patients with
late stage COVID-19, using admission data from the second hospital only. It is quite
likely there was a higher chance those patients were already with critical disease57. As
the score is intended to be used at hospital admission, we opted to exclude patients who
were transferred between hospitals and admission data from the first hospital was not
available.
Blood urea nitrogen elevation was a strong predictor for mortality, what is in
line with other scores36,58,59. Kidney disease has been widely described as a risk factor
for in-hospital mortality. Although autopsy studies did not find conclusive evidence of
SARS-CoV2 infection in the kidney, some authors hypothesize that the damage may be
mediated by direct cytopathic effects of SARS-Cov2 on the kidney tissue, immunemediated damage due to virus-induced immune complexes, as well as the effects of the
inflammatory response, hypoxia and shock60-62.
Strengths and limitations
A major strength of this rapid scoring system is its simplicity, the use of
objective parameters, what helps to reduce inter-user variability, easily available at the
emergency department presentation, even in under-resourced settings. A major strength
of this study is that it followed strict methodological criteria, recommended by TRIPOD

checklist and PROBAST20, and was based on robust sample of patients with laboratory
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, from a collaboration among researchers from 36
public, private and mixed hospitals of different sizes in four Brazilian states, to ensure
diversity of the population studied and representativeness of the intended target
population. The majority of published scores were developed in China or the US
(56.4%) and Europe (25.6%), this is the first study in the Latin American population.
Data were obtained by detailed medical chart reviews, and we were able to collect
comprehensive data from a large number of patients and follow 98.5% of the patients
from admission to discharge or death. Decisions about which predictors to retain in the
final model did not rely on potentially biased univariable selection of predictors. They
were based on clinical reasoning, previous evidence from other cohorts and systematic
reviews on prognostic factors for COVID-19 patients and availability of predictor
measurement at hospital admission19.
In a huge country such as Brazil, the development of a score that truly
corresponds to the reality of our population’s characteristic was only possible by the
collaborative work among several hospitals from all the regions of the country. The
COVID-19 cause and requirement for agile answers from the scientific community
motivated the fast and precise teamwork and allowed the achievement of the creation of
a tool to support the daily work in the frontline to combat the pandemic. We believe that
the learning regarding the development of qualified and useful research engaging
several centers could allow us to generate more accurate and faster results to subside
health policies in the future.
Patients who were transferred to other hospitals and thus were lost to follow-up
do not characterize selection bias, as they similar characteristics of the development and
validation cohorts, and a risk similar to those cohorts: of the 77 patients, 53 presented
complete data and had their scores calculated - low risk 30.2%, intermediate 35.8%,
high 22.6%, very high 11.3%.
With regards to study limitations, it was a retrospective analysis subject to the
drawbacks of patient records review. Obesity was not directly measured by body mass
index, but rather clinical defined, gathered from medical records, which may have led to
underreporting. Due to the pragmatic study design, laboratory tests were performed at
the discretion of the treating physician, and we did not have a full dataset on all
laboratory parameters of interest available. Some laboratory parameters, which proved

to be of prognostic relevance in other studies, were not available for at least 2/3 of
patients in our sample. Therefore, we cannot rule out that variables with a higher
proportion of missing data would have had a significant impact on mortality prediction.
Additionally, we were unable to assess the predictive ability of some scores, as some
required variables were not available.
Another bias from the Spanish validation cohort is the fact that the majority of
those patients came from the beginning of the pandemic, and management of the
patients improved during subsequent waves. Data include 28-day mortality, which may
differ from the Brazilian data, although the score was able to show very good
discrimination.

Implications for clinicians and policymakers
ABC2-SPH score may be very useful in a real-world setting, to provide
healthcare practitioners the decision support that is needed to help them better identify
and prioritize the care of patients who have the higher risk of death. Its development and
validation followed strict methodological criteria, and the score fulfils the majority of
the characteristics of an ideal score63. It can be used in all emergency departments,
regardless of the level of resource settings. The results represent the experience of 36
hospitals in 17 cities in Brazil, and one hospital in Spain, and they are highly relevant to
the current pandemic. It can be easily calculated at bedside or could be easily integrated
to the electronic medical records for an automatic computation. It may help clinicians to
identify high-risk patients from the triage phase, as well as to identify those most
appropriate to be enrolled into therapeutic trials, may make possible to expand inclusion
criteria through the early identification of patients who may benefit from therapy64. It
might also be useful to help guiding recommendations for early palliative
consultation65,66.
Different from what has been mistakenly suggested36,67-69, the results from this
study do not suggest that patients from low-risk group may be discharged for home
treatment. No score so far has specifically tested this hypothesis. A recent editorial has
highlighted the importance of taking into account the “treatment paradox”: patients
identified to be at the low risk group were at low risk due to the interventions received
in hospital70. It must not be interpreted as the risk to a patient if no actions are taken.

Sperrin & McMillan counterfactual prediction modelling as a potential solution to
minimize bias from treatment paradox70. More importantly, due to the treatment
paradox, scoring systems developed and validated in in-hospital settings cannot be used
in outpatient settings without further validation, as it has been mistakenly suggested71.

Unanswered questions and future research
We believe that ABC2-SPH score may hold potential generalizability for other
countries. However, prediction models are population specific and may produce
different results in different populations72. Considering that thresholds for admission
may vary, hospitalized COVID-19 population may be different, the outcome events are
different and patient management may be different, further validation (and recalibration) in different health care settings is recommended. In particular, we learned
that our model might underestimate mortality in high-risk individuals.
As we opted to develop the score focusing on information available at
admission, as this would make it more useful for clinicians, other important factors
during hospitalization that may impact prognosis were not included. Further analysis
involving these factors are required.
ABC2-SPH score may help clinicians to make a prompt and reasonable decision
to optimize patient management and potentially reduce mortality. However, further
prospective studies are needed to investigate whether the use of the score in the
emergency department indeed trigger actions that result in reduced complications and
hospital mortality. Additionally, due to the rapidly changing nature of the COVID-19
and the disease management, model performance should be monitored closely over time
and space70.
Future studies may also investigate risk factors for mortality among patients who
develop COVID-19 symptoms during hospital admission due to other conditions.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we developed and validated the ABC2-SPH rapid scoring system
and a web-based risk calculator. This score, based on age, number of comorbidities,
blood urea nitrogen, C-reactive protein, platelet count, peripheral oxygen saturation and
oxygen support at admission is an inexpensive tool, showed to objectively and
accurately predict in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. It may be used at bedside
for earlier identification of in-hospital mortality risk and, thus, inform clinical decisions

complete case analysis.
Small sample size from a single center, no external
validation. Complete case analysis. Authors pointed
out that patients at the highest risk may be deemed
NA
too sick for maximal intervention and may be denied
ICU treatment; predictors and their assigned weights
in the final model.

NA

Risk of selecion bias (only patients wit complete data
were included), unavailability of crucial clinical
information on symptoms, risk factors and clinical
parameters. Less than 100 events. No external
validation

0.82 (95% CI
not reported)

Data were imputed for variables with up to 50%
missing values. Follow up was too short (7 days),
what causes a high risk of bias, as a significant
proportion of patients may die after 7 days. Authors
did not show how to calculate the score.

High risk of selectionbias (20.8% patients with
incomplete data were excluded), modest sample size,
with <100 events. No external validation. Complete
case analysis. Authors did not show how to calculate
the score.
Small sample size, with <100 events. High risk of
selection bias: from 1085 patients, 652 (60.1%) were
excluded due to missing values, and the model was
developed using one 115 patients(10.6%). Data
quality is questionable, as the study is based in open
source database.

Small sample size of both development and
validation samples, with <100 events. Too many
predictors tested for a small number of events. The
authors did not exclude patients transferred from
other hospitals (so the assessment was not the first
hospital assessment in all patients). Single center
study, patients from both derivation and validation
sets were from Tongji Hospital, which is one of the
hospitals with a high level of medical care in China
(the authors reported that some critically ill patients
who recovered there might die in other hospitals with
suboptimal or typical levels of medical care).
