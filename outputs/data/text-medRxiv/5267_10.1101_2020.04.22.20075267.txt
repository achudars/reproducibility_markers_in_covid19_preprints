Abstract
Context: Despite many awareness programs conducted by the governments and other
agencies, there are certain false beliefs among the general public of India towards the
transmission, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19.
Aims: To assess the knowledge and beliefs of the general public of India on COVID-19.
Materials and Methods: A web-based cross-sectional survey was conducted between 20th
March and 15th April 2020. A 17-item questionnaire was developed, validated, and used for
the study. The questionnaire was randomly distributed among the public using Google forms
through social media networks. Descriptive analysis was performed to represent the study
characteristics, Chi-square test for assessing the associations among the study variables, and
logistic regression analysis for identifying the factors influencing the beliefs.
Results: A total of 462 participants with a mean (SD) age of 30.66 (11.31) years were
responded to the questionnaire. Study participants are having fairly good knowledge of the
basic aspects of COVID-19. However, a considerable fraction of participants were having
false beliefs towards the transmission of new coronavirus, and prevention & treatment of
COVID-19. It was observed that the participants who were aged 31-60 years and >60 years,
education level of intermediate or diploma and high school certificate, and occupation as the
unskilled workers had more of false beliefs towards COVID-19 compared to their
counterparts.
Conclusion: Though the overall knowledge on COVID-19 was good enough among the
general public of India, still there is a need for education to avoid false beliefs especially
among the people who are elderly, having a low level of education, and non-professional
workers.

Key-words: COVID-19, India, Knowledge, Belief
Key Messages: A cross-sectional web-based online survey was conducted to assess the
knowledge and beliefs of general public of India on COVID-19. It was identified that the
knowledge among the general public on COVID-19 is fairly good. However, still there are
some false beliefs among the population towards transmission of new coronavirus, and
prevention & treatment of COVID-19, especially among the people who are elderly, having
low level of education, and non-professional workers.

Introduction
Coronaviruses are large family of viruses that are known to cause mild to moderate
respiratory symptoms. However, the epidemics of two beta coronaviruses namely MERS
(Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) has
caused over 10,000 deaths over the past two decades.[1,2] In December 2019, scientists had
found series of cases with symptoms resemble to pneumonia in Wuhan, China and identified
that it was caused by a novel strain of coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Later, on 11th
February 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) has announced COVID-19 (Coronavirus
Disease 2019) as new name of the disease.

[3]

The WHO has announced COIVD-19 as

pandemic on 11th March 2020. [4] As of 19th April 2020, 185 countries/regions were affected
with SARS-Cov-2 with a total of 2,329,651 confirmed cases and 160,721 deaths. [5] Of these
countries, highest number of cases are seen in United States (735,086 cases), followed by
Spain (194,416 cases), Italy (175,925), France (152,978), Germany (143,724) and United
Kingdom (115,314). COVID-19 cases in India increasing gradually, and the number of cases
as of 19th April 2020 are 16,365 including 521 deaths.[6]
Despite general awareness programs conducted by the state and central governments, there
are many false beliefs among the general public of India due to circulation of various
misconceptions in social media and internet about the spread of novel coronavirus, and
prevention & treatment of COVID-19. False beliefs not only misrepresent the situation but
may increase the effects of disasters by compromising the public’s collective effort.[7] An
advocacy group of BBC said around 46% of adults have been seeing fake news or misleading
information about the COVID-19 pandemic and suggested that there is a need to stop the
false posts.[8] In Iran, thinking that alcohol can kill the coronavirus, around 600 people died
and 3000 were hospitalised after drinking methanol,[9] which is a type of alcohol used in
marine, automotive and electricity industries as a renewable energy resource.[10] In a study

conducted by Kok et al., it was identified that majority of participants thought government
and/or media were exaggerating the situation. [11]
India, with 1.39 billion population, is the second largest internet user in the world with over
560 million internet users, and has over 400 million WhatsApp users as of July 2019. [12,13]
According to the article published in India Today, the Maharashtra cyber cell department has
registered 115 cases over spread of fake news since lockdown during COVID-19. [14] Hence,
it is essential to assess the knowledge and beliefs of general public of India towards COVID19 for taking preventive measures in spreading misconceptions and increase awareness. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first Indian study conducted to assess the knowledge
and beliefs of general public of India on COVID-19.

Material and Methods
A cross-sectional web-based online survey was conducted between 20th March and 15th April
2020. A 17-item questionnaire was developed based on WHO myth busters.[15] The
developed questionnaire was validated for relevance, clarity, simplicity and ambiguity by
using four point content validity index. [16] A pilot study was conducted among 15 individuals
to identify further barriers in understanding the questionnaire before disseminating the
questionnaire. Cronbach’s alpha was used to measure the internal consistency of the
questionnaire.[17]
The questionnaire consists of three sections. The first section consists of demographics of
participants such as age, gender, occupation, education and monthly income. The
socioeconomic status of participants were grouped according to modified kuppuswamy
scale.[18] The second section has six knowledge based questions focus on knowledge of
general public of India on COVID-19. Initial five questions were provided with multiple
options with only one correct answer and the last question is about sources of information for

which the respondent can choose multiple options. The scoring was given to first five
questions. Each correct answer was given score “1” and incorrect answer was given “0”. The
third section has 11 questions pertaining to beliefs of people on transmission of new
coronavirus, and prevention & treatment of COVID-19. Each question has three options
(Yes/No/Don’t Know). The responses ‘Yes and Don’t Know’ were considered as false belief
and ‘No’ was considered as correct belief. The correct answer was given score “3”, incorrect
“1” and Don’t Know “2”. For the purpose of identifying the factors influencing the
knowledge and beliefs, participants were grouped into low and high knowledge and belief
score categories based on the cumulative score (≤2 and ≥3 for knowledge, and 11-21 and 2233 for beliefs).
Using Google forms, the questionnaire was randomly distributed among the public of India
including doctors, pharmacists, nurses, medical and engineering students, software
employees, retired persons, etc. through emails and social networking platforms such as
WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Instagram and Facebook. Also, we requested people to circulate the
survey link among their respective family members, friends and colleagues.
This study received an exemption from the Institutional Human Ethics committee of JSS
College of Pharmacy, Mysuru as it was considered as no minimal risk research. However,
participants were asked to give consent before taking part in the survey.
Mean with standard deviation was calculated for continuous variables and number with
percentage was calculated for categorical variables. Chi-square test was used to find the
association between demographic details of people and their beliefs on COVID-19, and the
factors influencing beliefs were identified by using odds ratio with 95% CI. The results were
considered statistically significant with p0.05. All statistical analyses were performed

using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM Corp. Released 2012. IBM SPSS
Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY, USA: IBM Corp).

Results
A total of 462 participants with mean (SD) age of 30.66 (11.31) years were responded to the
questionnaire. The age of participants ranged from 18 – 74 years. More than half of the
responses were received from males (57.58%). Majority of participants were graduates
(58.66%) by education and professionals (44.81%) by occupation. Around 50% of
participants were from upper middle economic class (Table 1).
Overall, the knowledge of participants on COVID-19 is satisfactory. Around 78% of
participants were aware of risk factors of COVID-19. Almost all participants (96.96%) knew
that the new coronavirus will affect lungs. All participants were aware of symptoms of
COVID-19. Majority of participants were aware of modes of transmission of COVID-19 and
precautions to be taken if affected with COVID-19. Social media (WhatsApp, Facebook etc),

Professionals (Doctors, Pharmacists, Nurses etc.) are the major information sources of these
participants. The details of participants responses on knowledge about COVID-19 are
presented in table 2.
Majority of participants agreed to the fact that changes in weather (56.49%), hand dryers
(70.34%) and taking hot water bath (59.3%) can’t kill the new coronavirus. However, only
42.85% of participants knew the fact that garlic will not help in treating or preventing
COVID-19. Majority of participants were aware that the new coronavirus will not spread
through mosquito bites (87.22%) and eating non-vegetarian food (88.74%). However, only
less than half of the participants knew that UV disinfection lamps (46.53%) and swallowing

or gargling warm water or saltwater (41.55%) can’t kill the new coronavirus. Also, majority
of participants (88.09%) were aware that the COVID-19 is not the disease of only elderly
(Table 3).
By conducting the logistic regression analysis, it was identified that the age, educational
status and occupation were the factors influencing the beliefs of participants on COVID-19.
Participants who are aged 31-60 years [OR 1.90 (1.02-3.53); p=0.041] and >60 years [OR
14.67 (4.73-45.50); p<0.001], education level of intermediate or diploma [OR 3.08 (1.088.76); p=0.039] and high school certificate [OR 16.71 (4.83-57.86); p<0.001], and occupation
as unskilled worker [OR 4.50 (1.41-14.31); p=0.018] had more of false beliefs towards
COVID-19 compared to their counterparts (Table 4).

Discussion
This study presented the information on knowledge and beliefs of general public of India on
COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge this is the first Indian on this hypothesis.
Participants from all adult age categories, education, occupation and socioeconomic status
participated in this survey. Despite many educational programmes initiated by the
government and private organizations on prevention of COVID-19, it is noteworthy that the
considerable fraction of participants were unaware of all risk factors and modes of
transmission of new coronavirus. This fraction of participants could be potential vectors for
spread of infection especially in a pandemic like COVID-19. Educating people on survival
time of new coronavirus on various objects would help people to understand the need of
disinfecting the objects. Creating awareness among people on individuals who are at risk of
acquiring COVID-19 will help people to keep themselves in self-quarantine and
simultaneously helps in further spread of infection. Participants were aware of major
symptoms and steps to be taken if they were in contact with COVID-19 patient. From this

study it was identified that almost equal number of participants relied on news channels
followed by healthcare professionals, government websites and social media such as
WhatsApp, Facebook for the information on COVID-19. However, the credibility of
information being received from social media is still debatable.
Regarding beliefs of participants on COVID-19, mixed type of responses were observed in
this section. Although majority of participants were aware of myths and facts on COVID-19,
noticeable number of participants were believing some of these myths. More than 50% of
participants were unaware or not sure if UV disinfection lamps, swallowing or gargling warm
water and eating garlic helps in prevention or treating COVID-19. According to WHO UV
lamps, swallowing or gargling warm or saltwater and consuming garlic will not kill the new
coronavirus.[15] Furthermore, WHO stated that use of UV lamps for sterilizing hands may
cause skin irritation.
Pandemics does not follow the usual pattern as we see in normal infections. There are no
studies conducted stating that changes in temperature or taking hot water bath will kill the
new coronavirus. However, based on the study conducted on one of the strains of coronavirus
i.e SARS, the maximum survival temperature is 56 oC, which is higher than the normal body
temperature (36.5 to 37 oC).[19] The new coronavirus affects the respiratory system of the
healthy individual who inhale the virus contained droplets or contacted the contaminated
surfaces. According to WHO there is no information or studies till date stating that the new
coronavirus can be transmitted through mosquitos.[15] Alcohol and bleach are strong and
effective disinfectants. Alcohol is a highly flammable compound, it is been used to disinfect
small surfaces in ventilated places. However, there is no evidence stating that drinking
alcohol will kill the new coronavirus. Furthermore, excessive consumption of alcohol may
result in serious health complications.[20] Bleach is easily available at low costs. It is effective
against bacteria, fungi and viruses including influenza virus. But it easily reacts with other

chemicals and decomposes in presence of heat and light. Contacting with bleach or spraying
it over the body would irritate the skin and mucous membrane.[20]
This study identified that the people who are aged, having low level of education and nonprofessionals are having more of false belief towards transmission of new coronavirus, and
prevention & treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, it is suggested that the governments or nongovernment organizations should have a special focus on educating these categories of
population. Furthermore, it is not only the duty of government on educating the people, it is
the duty of every citizen of India to educate themselves and others on facts of COVID-19 by
relying on trusted sources.

Conclusion
This study was assessed the knowledge and beliefs of general public of India on COVID-19,
and also the factors which are influencing the beliefs of participants. As per the observations
in this study, the effort of government agencies of providing accurate information on
preventive strategies of COVID 19 has shown a greater impact on the knowledge components
about COVID-19. However, still there is need for combined efforts of governments and nongovernment organizations to educate the people to avoid the false beliefs especially among
the people who are elderly, having low level of education and non-professional workers on
various aspects of COVID-19.
