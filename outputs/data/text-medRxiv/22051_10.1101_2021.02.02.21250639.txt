ABSTRACT
Introduction:
The mental being of healthcare workers with the COVID 19 pandemic is a
determinant of their resilience. We investigated the psychological impact of health workers
during early phase of Covid 19 pandemic in Morocco.

Methods
This was a cross-sectional study based on a survey of health workers of the Rabat
University Hospital Ibn-Sina in Morocco. Data were collected during the first week of health

emergency state –between 23 and 30 march- related to the covid-19 pandemic declaration in
Morocco. Sociodemographic, health characteristics and professional characteristics of each
health worker were collected. We also evaluated the knowledge of health workers concerning
the protective measures against COVID 19. The mental health status of the health workers
was investigated using the Arabic validated version of HADS 14 items, evaluating hospital
anxiety and depression

Results
Two hundred eighty-seven health workers were included.The mean age was
34.4±12.18 year; and 64.5% were female, 54% have been trained regarding protection
procedures, and 94.8% declared that they are aware of individual protection measures. The
incidence of anxiety and depression was respectively 77.4% and 73.9%. High degree of
anxiety and depression was associated with female gender. However, Higher degree of
anxiety was also related to function, specialty of practice , and knowledge of the protective
measures against COVID-19.

Conclusion
We reported the result of the first evaluation of psychological burden of health worker
during early period of COVID-19 pandemic in a developing country. The study showed high
frequency of anxiety and depression among Moroccan health worker in a hospital faced to
COVID-19 patient management.

INTRODUCTION:
Since its emergence in Wuhan China, the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Sars Cov 2) has
become a nationwide health crisis, indeed classified by the World Health Organization
(WHO) as a pandemic since early March 2020(1). To date 27 April 2020, there have been
over 2,99 M confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, and 207 k deaths worldwide. Amongst
reported deaths over 100 healthcare professionals decease have been registered (2), in
Morocco we report overall 4.065 confirmed cases, and 161deaths. With the outbreak of the
COVID-19 in China in December 2019 and in Europe in February 2020, the adaptive capacity
of a health system appears to be more depending on the relevance and precaution of the
preventive measures implemented than on maturity of health care system. On March 19,
health emergency state was declared in Morocco.
Moroccan authorities deployed necessary resource to fight COVID-19. Collectives
preventives measures had started including; containment of population, and barrier measures
(social distancing and

mask wearing in public places) expanded screening of contact; and

isolation of suspected and confirmed cases).

The increasing number of overwhelmed healthcare systems, reported global shortage of
protective equipment, and clinical care challenges during these times, create a state of
uncertainty regarding the situation progression among population in general and health care
workers in particular. All these factors build up to create a high-risk environment to the
physical and mental being of healthcare workers. Healthcare workers are the key resources of
a health system. The mental being of healthcare workers with the COVID 19 pandemic is a
determinant of their resilience. Indeed, we suppose that our global current context may
become a source of psychological distress upon healthcare workers ready to face COVID 19
pandemic. Therefore, we sought to investigate the psychological burden of healthcare
Workers during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic times.
Methods
Study Design and Setting
This was a cross-sectional study based on a survey of healthcare workers of the Rabat
University Hospital Ibn-Sina in Morocco.
Data were collected between 23th to 30th March 2020; the first week of health emergency
state related to the covid-19 pandemic declaration in Morocco. Sociodemographic, health
characteristics and professional characteristics of each health worker were collected. We also
evaluated the knowledge of health workers concerning the protective measures against
COVID 19 through 3 questions: a) Do you know about individual protective measures? ;
b)What kind of individual protective measures do you know? ; c) did you have a training
regarding protection procedures?
Data were collected using face-to-face questionnaires, and by phone calls. The study was
approved by the local ethics committee and informed consent was obtained from all
participants.
INSTRUMENT
The mental health status of the health workers was investigated using the Arabic validated
version of HADS 14 items, evaluating hospital anxiety and depression (3). It is a self-report
rating scale of 14 items on a 4-level scale (range 0–3) evaluating anxiety and depression
(7 items for each subscale). The total score is the sum of the 14 items, and for each subscale
the score is the sum of the respective seven items (ranging from 0–21). Scores of 8 or more on
either subscale are considered to be a significant 'case' of psychological morbidity, and 0–7
are considered 'normal'.
Statistical analysis

Continuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation for variables with a normal
distribution, and as median and interquartile range (IQR) for variables with skewed
distributions. The normality of the distribution was tested by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
with Lilliefors correction. For categorical variables, the percentages of patients in each
category were calculated. Anxiety or depression (defined as a subscale score >7) was the
dependent variable. The univariate analysis was carried out using the students' t-test for the
comparison of two groups. Analysis of variance for comparison of more than two groups and
Pearson correlation for the link between two quantitative variables. A two-tailed P value <
0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS
for Windows (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

RESULTS
Sociodemographic and health characteristics of 287 included health workers were described
in table 1. The incidence of anxiety and depression was respectively 77.4% and 73.9%.
Comparison of anxiety and depression intensity according health worker’s characteristics; and
kknowledge and training about individual protective measures against COVID-19 were
presented in table 1. Figure 1 showed Mean anxiety scale of health workers according to
protective procedures' knowledge.

DISCUSSION
We reported the result of the first evaluation of psychological burden of health worker during
early period of COVID-19 pandemic Africa. The study showed high frequency of anxiety
(77.4%) and depression (73.9%) among Moroccan health worker in a hospital faced to
COVID-19 patient management. High degree of anxiety and depression was associated with
female gender. A previous study in a tertiary infectious disease hospital for COVID-19 in
China, and concluded that female medical staff members were more vulnerable with high
anxiety index (8).
However, High degree of anxiety was also related to function, specialty of practice, and
knowledge of the protective measures against COVID-19. Higher anxiety was noted among
emergency unit staff members, interventional units, laboratory units and surgical units. These
results can be explained by the high risk of exposure proper to each department: direct
manipulation of blood and high proximity to sharp instruments for surgical, laboratory and
interventional units, and to frontline contact with all arriving patients to the hospital with
unknown COVID-19 status regarding emergency units.

Lower knowledge of the protective measures against COVID-19 is the main factors
explaining higher level of anxiety among health workers during early phase of Covid 19
pandemic. These results go in accordance with previous studies evaluating anxiety and
depression among medical staff demonstrating both high anxiety and depression incidence
(8).
