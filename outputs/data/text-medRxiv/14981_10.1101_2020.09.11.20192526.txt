Abstract
OBJECTIVE: Nearly 5 % of the patients with COVID-19 develop an acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS). Extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) is a marker of
pulmonary oedema which is associated with mortality in ARDS. In this study we
evaluate whether EVLWI is higher in patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS as
compared to controls and whether EVLWI has the potential to monitor disease
progression.
METHODS: From the day of intubation, EVLWI, cardiac function were monitored by
transpulmonary thermodilution in n=25 patients with COVID-19 and compared to a
control group of 49 non-COVID-19 ARDS-patients.
RESULTS: EVLWI in COVID-19-patients was noticeably elevated and significantly
higher than in the control group (17 (11-38) vs. 11 (6-26) mL/kg; p<0.001). High
pulmonary vascular permeability index values (2.9 (1.0-5.2) versus 1.9 (1.0-5.2);
p=0.003) suggest inflammatory oedema. By contrast, the cardiac parameters SVI,
GEF and GEDVI were comparable. High EVLWI values were associated with viral
persistence, prolonged intensive care treatment and mortality (23.2±6.7% vs.
30.3±6.0%, p=0.025).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the control group, COVID-19 results in markedly
elevated EVLWI-values in patients with ARDS. EVLWI reflects a non-cardiogenic
pulmonary oedema in COVID-19 associated ARDS and could serve as parameter to
monitor ARDS progression.

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19 is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and
shows a wide clinical spectrum covering asymptomatic cases, mild upper respiratory
affectation, and severe pneumonia.1,2 While a majority of patients have a favorable
outcome, higher age and underlying comorbidities are associated with a poor
prognosis. Typically, patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia suffer from dyspnea,
hypoxemia, massive alveolar damage, progression to acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure.3
The pathogenesis of the COVID-19 is poorly understood. As far as known, onset of
COVID-19 associated ARDS leads to uncontrolled pulmonary inflammation, fluid
accumulation, and progressive fibrosis that severely compromise oxygen and carbon
dioxide exchange.4 Moreover, a complex immune response of the host versus the
SARS-CoV-2 virus is assumed, which result in a liberation of soluble inflammatory
proteins - a so called cytokine storm.5-8
In these most severely ill patients, computed tomography (CT) of the chest
demonstrates an unprecedented, typical pattern which is suggestive to a degree that
it is disease-defining, even if the SARS-CoV-2 PCR is negative.9,10
Regarding the predominantly higher age and a substantial prevalence of circulatory
comorbidities such as coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, arterial
hypertension and diabetes mellitus, the role of cardiogenic implications on pulmonary
oedema has to be further studied. .2,3,5,7
Single indicator transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD) is a commercially available
technology of advanced hemodynamic monitoring. TPTD provides bedside
measurement of extravascular lung water index (EVLWI) which is a marker of
pulmonary oedema. Additionally, crucial hemodynamics such as stroke volume index

(SVI), global ejection fraction (GEF) and the preload marker global end-diastolic
volume index (GEDVI) are derived from TPTD in parallel with EVLWI.11-13
Several studies demonstrated significant and independent association of EVLWI and
its changes over time with mortality.14-19 A recent study in a non-COVID-19 cohort
with ARDS patients suggests an improved and earlier prediction of 28-days-mortality
compared to traditional scores of ARDS severity.20 Furthermore, TPTD-monitoring of
critically ill non-COVID-19 patients was independently associated with a lower
mortality in this study.
To date, in COVID-19-patients, there is a lack of data on hemodynamic key
parameters, especially on EVLWI, generated by bedside TPTD.
Aim of our study is to investigate key hemodynamic and pulmonary parameters
derived from TPTD in mechanically ventilated COVID-19-patients with ARDS
compared to a recent non-COVID-19 cohort with ARDS.

MATERIAL AND METHODS.
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (Ethics committee
of Technical University of Munich; Approval No. 178/20S) as essential part of the
register study CORRECT: COVID Registry REChts der Isar intensive care Trial. The
study was registered at the Clinical Trial Registry (No.

(ISRCTN10077335).

Additional data of the study and control group is reported in supplementary digital
table 1.
All patients or their legal representatives gave written informed consent. The study
was conducted in a COVID-19-ICU of a university hospital with 14 beds.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
In addition to the diagnosis of COVID-19, confirmed by a positive SARS-CoV-2-PCR,
all patients were intubated, mechanically ventilated, and suffered from a documented
ARDS, according to the Berlin definition.21 Patients were excluded, if TPTD was
contra-indicated (lower extremity peripheral artery disease grade II or above
according to the Forestier classification) or not feasible within the first 12 hours after
intubation. Since extracorporeal membrane oxygenation might lead to incorrect
measurement of EVLWI and GEDVI, TPTD measurements during extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were not included.22
According to the local standard TPTD was performed at least once within 24h as
described previously.13,23
In brief a, 5F thermistor-tipped arterial line (PV2025L20, Pulsiocath, Pulsion Medical
Systems, SE Feldkirchen Germany) was inserted into the femoral artery. The
thermistor line and the pressure line of the arterial catheter as well as a second
thermistor on the central venous catheter for measurement of the injectate
temperature were connected to the hemodynamic monitor (PiCCO-2 (8 beds) or

PulsioFlex (6 beds), both Pulsion Medical Systems, SE Feldkirchen Germany). The
TPTD-curve was registered and analyzed after injection of 15 mL icecold 0.9% saline
solution via the central venous catheter (CVC). Each TPTD measurement represents
the mean of three consecutive thermodilution measurements within 5 minutes.
EVLWI was indexed to predicted bodyweight as suggested by the manufacturer.24
To derive EVLWI, GEDVI, SVI, GEF and all other parameters provided by the
PiCCO, we used the most recent software V3.1, which corrects GEDVI for femoral
CVC indicator injection.25 Since this correction does not pertain to pulmonary
vascular permeability index (PVPI), in both cohorts PVPI_fem derived from femoral
indicator injection was corrected as suggested recently.26
Correction is based on two formulas:
PVPI_fem_corrected = PVPI_fem * GEDVI_fem_uncorrected/GEDVI_fem_corrected
and
GEDVI_fem_corrected = 0.539 *GEDVI_fem_uncorrected -15.15 + 24.49 *CI_fem +
2.311*IBW

Comparison of EVLWI in COVID-19-ARDS-patients with a recent non-COVID-19cohort with ARDS.20 The non-COVID-19-cohort comprised 49 consecutive patients
with TPTD-monitoring and ARDS.21 All patients of this cohort were treated in the
same ICU as the COVID-19-patients and had been treated before 2019 (see Clinical
Study Registration No. ISRCTN32938630; Institutional Review Board (Ethics
committee of Technical University of Munich), Approval No. 343/18 S).

Power calculation:
Based on two independent study groups, a continuous endpoint (EVLWI with a mean
of 12.5±4.9mL/kg in the control cohort p-value and an estimated EVLWI of
18±7mL/kg in the COVID-19-cohort, a number of 49 controls and 25 COVID-19patients would result in a statistical power of >90% with a p-value of p<0.05.20

Statistics:
Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 25 (SPSS Inc, Chicago,
Illinois, USA). Samples were checked for normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk
test. Descriptive data of normally distributed parameters were presented as mean ±
standard deviation and as median and range for non-parametric parameters. The
Mann-Whitney-U and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to analyze non-parametric
variables and the t-test and a one-way analysis of variances (ANOVA) to analyze
variables with normal distribution. To compare qualitative parameters, chi-square test
and in small samples (expected frequency of test variable less than 5) Fisher's exact
test was used. All statistical tests were two-sided with a level of significance (p-value)
of 5%. Multivariate linear regression models were used to identify parameters that
are independently associated with higher EVLWI and PVPI values. Factors with a
significant p-value below 0.05 in univariate analysis were included in the regression
models. To control the false discovery rate after multiple testing we adjusted the level
of significance by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.

substantially higher in COVID-19-patients vs. pp-COVID-19-patients (Table 3; Fig. 1
BOXPLOTS).
High PVPI values (≥3) are associated with inflammation and pulmonary origin,
whereas low values are in line with cardiogenic or mixed pulmonary oedema. PVPI is
calculated as a ratio from unindexed extravascular lung water EVLW divided by
pulmonary blood volume PBV. PBV is assumed to be about 25% of unindexed GEDV
(PVPI = EVLW/(0.25*GEDV)).26
PVPI was significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 compared to the controls on
day-1 (Table 2 and Fig. 1).

In univariate analysis, the first EVLWI was associated with COVID-19 (r=0.503;
p<0.001) and correlated with low body mass index (BMI) (r=-0.264; p=0.035), but not
to gender, height, age, heart rate, MAP, SVRI, CVP, GEDVI, dPmax, SVI, CI, CPI
and noradrenalin dosage.
Multivariate regression analysis (r=0.508; R²=0.258) regarding EVLWI including
COVI-19 yes/no and BMI demonstrated that both COVID-19 (p<0.001, T=-4.801) and
BMI (p=0.03, T=-2.214) were independently associated with higher EVLWI values.

PVPI was univariately associated with COVID-19, low BMI (r=-0.338; p=0.003) and
low SVI (r=-0.230; p=0.048), but not with gender, height, age, heart rate, MAP, SVRI,
CVP, dPmax, SVI, GEF, CPI and noradrenalin dosage.
In multivariate analysis (r=0.519; R²=0.269), PVPI was independently associated with
COVID-19 (p=0.001; T=-3.481) and low BMI (p=0.001, T=-3.422), but not with SVI.
GEDVI and EVLWI were not included in the multivariate analysis regarding PVPI,
since PVPI is derived from the ratio of unindexed EVLW divided by 0.25*GEDV.

A significant EVLWI decrease during the first days of mechanical ventilation was
inversely associated with discharge from intensive care unit after less than 14 days
and mortality (EVLWI at day 10 after intubation: 19.2±7.5 vs. 10.0±1.4, p=0.002,
figure 2; mortality: deltaEVLWI 7 (0-22) versus 3 (0-12), p=0.021). Persistence of
positive SARS-CoV-2 samples in COVID-19 patients during the ICU stay was
associated with mortality (17/17 vs. 5/9, p=0.008). The highest EVLWI is associated
with SARS-CoV-2 clearance (29.7±2.5 vs. 24.6±7.4, p=0.046) and mortality
(23.2±6.7 vs. 30.3±6.0, p=0.025). The highest EVLWI was measured 5.2±4.4 days
after intubation in the patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS.

Preload markers GEDVI and CVP
By contrast, the static preload markers GEDVI (761±168 vs. 749±180 mL/m²;
p=0.882; Fig. 3) and CVP (16.4±7.4 vs. 17.9±8.0 mmHg; p=0.446) were not
significantly different between ARDS-patients with and without COVID-19.

Parameters of cardiac function in COVID-19 patients versus controls
Global ejection fraction (GEF) (20.9±6.0 vs. 23.8±7.3 %; p=0.098; Fig. 3) and stroke
volume index (SVI) and dPmax were comparable for patients with and without
COVID-19 on day-1 (table 2 and supplementary table 1).

DISCUSSION
Symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infections range from asymptomatic to severe ARDS.
Similarly, there are patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS that recover within
several days and others that require mechanical ventilation for weeks or do not
recover at all. The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear and it is often hard to

estimate an individual patients’ prognosis. According to published data a high EVLWI
is associated with mortality in patients with ARDS.15-17 A median EVLWI of 17 ml/kg
is not only higher than in our previous non-COVID-19 ARDS cohort, but also
compared to previous studies in patients with ARDS.14,16-19 The absolute, nonindexed EVLW for a 70kg healthy patient would be around 500mL. In non COVID-19
ARDS patients it is 900 mL with the best cut-off to predict increased mortality at
1000mL.27 In COVID-19 patients EVLW reaches up to 2600 mL. Hence, there is no
defined EVLWI cut off for the prediction of mortality as absolute EVLWI values are
not comparable between patients with SARS-CoV-2 induced ARDS and with ARDS
by other causes. While mortality is the same in both groups, EVLWI values differ
significantly. In conclusion, high EVLWI values compared to other patients with
COVID-19 predict mortality. In addition, the course of EVLWI values can help to
monitor respiratory function of COVID-19 patients. Decreasing EVLWI values were
associated with improved respiration and consequently shorter time on ICU. The high
EVLWI values in patients with COVID-19 reflect the extent of pulmonary oedema
caused by this viral pneumonia.
This degree of rapid inflammation is so far only known in severe acute pancreatitis.28
The morphologic correlate of pronounced pulmonary inflammation appears as diffuse
interstitial oedema on CT that can affect large parts of the pulmonary tissue.10 A
recent autopsy study reported pronounced endothelial damage and widespread
capillary microthrombi in COVID-19 ARDS.29 Similar to Sepsis, a massive
inflammatory response might explain this microangiopathy. In combination with
intravascular coagulation and capillary leakage this results in extensive pulmonary
oedema. Lungs of COVID-19-patients with ARDS have a lower weight at autopsy
compared to influenza associated ARDS, which seems contrary to the increased
EVLWI values. However, these two findings might be due to the different time point

when measurements were performed. EVLWI values derived from the first days after
intubation whereas autopsy is carried out later after termination of treatment.
Interestingly, in multivariate regression analysis EVLWI was negatively associated
with BMI, whereas recent reports e.g. from Italy suggest body weight to be
associated with a bad outcome in COVID-19.30 This might be explained by the fact
that EVLWI is indexed to predicted bodyweight. There is data supporting an
indexation to height rather than body weight as height increases EVLWI values and
an EVLW indexed to height predicts FiO2/pO2 more accurately than an EVLW
indexed to ideal body weight.16,24 Increasing height on the other hand results in lower
BMI values which might cause the negative association of BMI and EVLWI.
In addition to the absolute increase in EVLWI, our study gives several hints that this
pulmonary oedema is mainly non-cardiogenic. The PiCCO-device combines TPTD
with pulse contour analysis and provides a number of well-validated parameters of
cardiac function. To facilitate decision support, a number of ratios is calculated,
including PVPI and GEF (GEF = 4*stroke volume divided by GEDV).
PVPI relates EVLWI to preload (PVP = EVLW/(0.25*GEDV)). High values (in
particular above 3) indicate pulmonary origin of the oedema with a normal GEDV. By
contrast, elevated EVLWI-values in the context of a PVPI <2 suggests cardiac
dilatation with an elevated GEDVI. A PVPI of 3.1±1.3 in our COVID-19-cohort is
clearly in line with an inflammatory origin of the pulmonary oedema.
This is further supported by GEF of 21±6%, SVI of 38±17mL/m² and dPmax of
1133±402 mmHg/s. These parameters were comparable between COVID-19- and
non-COVID-19-patients in our study. Mean values of GEF, SVI and dPmax were
slightly below the normal range. However, these normal ranges are given for a
population with a representative age distribution. A recent study demonstrated that

older age (independent decrease of CO of 66mL/min per year).31 Therefore, GEF,
SVI and dPmax might be considered within the age-adjusted normal range.
Repeated CT scans are an alternative diagnostic tool to monitor inflammation and
ARDS progression. But inter-observer agreement depends on experienced staff and
transport of ventilated patient always inherits a risk for the patient.32 As demonstrated
in our study TPTD is a bedside available method to directly measure EVLWI with a
limited invasiveness in the ICU-setting. It has been well validated compared to the
more invasive double-indicator technique.27,33,34 EVLWI has not only the potential to
predict mortality but also to monitor ARDS and the extent of pulmonary oedema
during intensive care treatment.

Limitations of the study:
Due to its design as a mono-center study a selection bias might be discussed.
Slight baseline differences of the biometric data from COVID-19 and control cohorts
can most likely be explained by older age and predominantly male gender in the
COVID-19-cohort.

CONCLUSION
EVLWI values in COVID-19 patients with ARDS are significantly higher than in the
comparable control group. High EVLWI values are associated with increased
mortality in patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS. EVLWI reflects a noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema in COVID-19 associated ARDS and might serve as
parameter to monitor ARDS progression.
