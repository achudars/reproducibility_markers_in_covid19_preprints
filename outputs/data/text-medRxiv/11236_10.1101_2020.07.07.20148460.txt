Abstract
Background:​ Asymptomatic or subclinical SARS-CoV-2 infections are often unreported, which
means that confirmed case counts may not accurately reflect underlying epidemic dynamics.
Understanding the level of ascertainment (the ratio of confirmed symptomatic cases to the true
number of symptomatic individuals) and undetected epidemic progression is crucial to informing
COVID-19 response planning, including the introduction and relaxation of control measures.
Estimating case ascertainment over time allows for accurate estimates of specific outcomes such as
seroprevalence, which is essential for planning control measures.
Methods:​ Using reported data on COVID-19 cases and fatalities globally, we estimated the
proportion of symptomatic cases (i.e. any person with any of fever >= 37.5°C, cough, shortness of
breath, sudden onset of anosmia, ageusia or dysgeusia illness) that were reported in 210 countries and
territories, given those countries had experienced more than ten deaths. We used published estimates
of the baseline case fatality ratio (CFR), which was adjusted for delays and under-ascertainment, then
calculated the ratio of this baseline CFR to an estimated local delay-adjusted CFR to estimate the level
of under-ascertainment in a particular location. We then fit a Bayesian Gaussian process model to
estimate the temporal pattern of under-ascertainment.
Results: ​Based on reported cases and deaths, we estimated that, during March 2020, the median
percentage of symptomatic cases detected across the 84 countries which experienced more than ten
deaths ranged from 2.4% (Bangladesh) to 100% (Chile). Across the ten countries with the highest
number of total confirmed cases as of 6th July 2020, we estimated that the peak number of
symptomatic cases ranged from 1.4 times (Chile) to 18 times (France) larger than reported.
Comparing our model with national and regional seroprevalence data where available, we find that
our estimates are consistent with observed values. Finally, we estimated seroprevalence for each
country. As of the 7th June, our seroprevalence estimates range from 0% (many countries) to 13%
(95% CrI: 5.6% - 24%) (Belgium).
Conclusions:​ We found substantial under-ascertainment of symptomatic cases, particularly at the
peak of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, in many countries. Reported case counts will
therefore likely underestimate the rate of outbreak growth initially and underestimate the decline in
the later stages of an epidemic. Although there was considerable under-reporting in many locations,
our estimates were consistent with emerging serological data, suggesting that the proportion of each
country's population infected with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide is generally low.

Background
The pandemic of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has caused 25.3 million confirmed cases and
​
846,841 deaths as of 31​h August
2020 (1). As a precautionary measure, or in response to locally
detected outbreaks, countries have introduced control measures with varying degrees of stringency
(1)​, including isolation and quarantine; school and workplace closures; bans on social gatherings;
physical distancing and face coverings; and stay-at-home orders ​(2,3)​. Several features of
SARS-CoV-2 make accurate detection during an ongoing epidemic challenging ​(4–6)​, including high
transmissibility ​(3,7,8)​; an incubation period with a long-tailed distribution ​(9)​; pre-symptomatic
transmission ​(10)​; and the existence of asymptomatic infections, which may also contribute to
transmission ​(11)​. These attributes mean that infections can go undetected ​(12)​ and that countries may
only detect and report a fraction of their infections ​(3,13)​.
Understanding the extent of unreported infections in a given country is crucial for situational
awareness. If the true size of the epidemic can be estimated, this enables a more reliable assessment of
how and when non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) should be both introduced, as infections rise,
or relaxed as infections fall ​(3)​. Estimates of infection prevalence are also important for obtaining
accurate measures of transmission: if the proportion of infections reported declines as the epidemic
rises, the number of confirmed cases will grow slower than the actual underlying epidemic. Likewise,
if detection rises as the epidemic declines, it may appear that transmission is not declining as fast as it
is in reality. Underdetection of cases also makes it challenging to estimate at what stage of the
epidemic a particular country is ​(14)​: viewed in isolation, case incidence data could reflect a very
large undetected epidemic, or a smaller, better reported epidemic.
To estimate how the levels of under-ascertainment vary over time, we present a modelling framework
that combines data on reported cases and deaths, and published severity estimates. We apply our
methods to countries that have reported more than ten deaths to date, then use these
under-ascertainment estimates to reconstruct global epidemics in all countries where case and death
time series data are available. We also compare the model estimates for cumulative incidence against
existing seroprevalence results. Finally, we present the adjusted case curves for the ten countries with
the highest confirmed and adjusted case numbers, as well as global prevalence estimates for
SARS-CoV-2.
Methods
As SARS-CoV-2 infections that generate mild symptoms are more likely to be missed than severe
cases, the ratio of cases to deaths, adjusting for delays from report to fatal outcome, can provide
information on the possible extent of undetected symptomatic infections. Using a Bayesian Gaussian
process model, we estimate changes in under-ascertainment over time, as described below.
Adjusting for delay from confirmation to death
In real time, simply dividing deaths to date by cases to date leads to a biased estimate of the case
fatality ratio (CFR), because this naive calculation does not account for delays from confirmation of a
case to death, and under-ascertainment of cases (5,6) and in some circumstances, under-ascertainment
of deaths too. Using the distribution of the delay from hospitalisation to death for cases that are fatal,
we can estimate how many cases so far are expected to have known outcomes (i.e. death or recovery),

and hence adjust the naive estimates of CFR to account for these delays and produce a delay-adjusted
CFR (dCFR). Separately published dCFR estimates for a given country can be used to estimate the
number of symptomatic cases that would be expected for a given dCFR trajectory. Available
estimates for the CFR that adjust for under-reporting typically range from 1–1.7% (7–10). Large
studies in China and South Korea estimate the CFR at 1.38% (95% CrI: 1.23–1.53%) (9) and 1.7%
(95% CrI: 1.1-2.5%) (7) respectively.
Inferring level of under-ascertainment
Assuming a baseline CFR of 1.4% (95% CrI: 1.2% - 1.5%), the ratio of this baseline CFR to our
estimate of the dCFR for a given country can be used to derive a crude estimate of the proportion of
symptomatic cases that go unreported for this country. For each country we calculate the dCFR on
each day and use the ratio of the baseline CFR to the dCFR estimate to produce daily estimates of the
proportion of unreported cases. We then use a Gaussian process (GP) model to fit a time-dependent
under-ascertainment rate for each country. A more detailed description of the methods, including the
mathematical details of the Gaussian process and the different sources of uncertainty present in the
model, can be found in the Supplementary Material.
With the aim of developing a parsimonious and easily transferable analysis framework, we assume the
same baseline CFR for all countries in the main results. Given that CFR varies substantially with age
(5)​, this induces a certain amount of error in our estimates, especially for countries with age
distributions significantly different to China, where the data used to derive the baseline CFR estimates
originated ​(5)​. Therefore, we include a version of all the main results where we compute an indirectly
adjusted baseline CFR, using the underlying age distribution of each country using the wpp2019 R
package ​(15)​ and the age-stratified CFR estimates from ​(5)​ in the supplementary material (Additional
file 1: Figures S5, S6 and S7), where we also include a verbose limitations section discussing at length
the potential errors induced under such assumptions.
Relationship between under-ascertainment and testing
We attempt to characterise the relationship between widespread RT-PCR testing and case
ascertainment using our temporal under-ascertainment estimates and testing data for many countries
from OurWorldInData ​(16)​. We do so by performing a correlation test between the two for all
countries we had both data for. The resulting bivariate scatterplot is included in the supplementary
material (Additional file 1: Figure S3).
Comparison against seroprevalence estimates
We attempted to reconstruct the infection curves by first adjusting the reported case data for
under-ascertainment (Figure 1). We then adjust further these estimated symptomatic case curves so
that they represent all infections. We do so using the assumption that 50% of infections are
asymptomatic overall, with an assumed wide range between 10% - 70% and mean-lagging the time
point to adjust for the delay between onset of symptoms to confirmation ​(17)​. We assume that
serological tests are broadly similar between locations, in order for a tractable and relatively simple
comparison. We include both our estimates, with their 95% credible intervals, and the confidence
intervals of all serological estimates in our comparison (Figure 3).

Results

We estimated substantial variation in the proportion of symptomatic cases detected over time in many
of the countries considered (Figure 1 & Figure S1). For example, during March the median percentage
of symptomatic cases detected across the 84 countries which experienced more than ten deaths ranged
from 2.38% (Bangladesh) to 99.6% (Chile). Also during March, the median percentage of
symptomatic cases detected across Europe ranged from 4.81% (France) to 85.5% (Cyprus).
Countries might expect to detect an increasing proportion of symptomatic cases if they scale up
testing effort in response to the outbreak. To measure this, we compared our estimates for the
proportion of cases detected with the number of tests performed per new case each day, which can
provide an indication of testing effort with a country ​(18)​. Taking a moving average with a 7-day
window, we found that countries that showed high testing effort did not necessarily have high levels
of case ascertainment. For example, in a two-week period in March the United Kingdom performed
80 tests per new case (the mean across Europe during the same period was 27 tests per new case).
However, we estimate that also in the UK only between 3-10% of symptomatic cases were being
detected (Figure 1). Overall, we found a weak positive correlation between testing effort and case
ascertainment (Kendall’s correlation coefficient of 0.16). This suggests that increased testing effort
can help to improve case ascertainment, but on its own is not enough to guarantee low levels of
under-ascertainment.
Using our temporal under-ascertainment trends, we estimate that during March, April, and May the
percentage of symptomatic cases detected in European countries and averaged over time ranged from
4.8% - 86% (France - Cyprus), 5.8% - 100% (France - Belarus) and 11% - 86% (Hungary - Cyprus)
respectively. By comparison, the number of reported tests performed per new confirmed case,
averaged over the month in question, ranged between 2.7 to 76 in March (Belgium - Portugal), 2.7 to
832 in April (Belgium - Slovakia) and 12 to 1334 (Ukraine - Lithuania) in May.

Figure 1: Illustrative examples of temporal variation in under-ascertainment and testing effort.
Nine countries under-ascertainment and testing effort dynamics, where the
under-ascertainment dynamics display a typical U-trend. The solid black line is the estimated
median proportion of symptomatic cases ascertained over time and the shaded blue region is the
95% credible interval of these ascertainment estimates. Dashed line shows the reported testing
effort, which we defined as a 7-day moving average of the number of new tests per new case
reported each day. The illustrative examples chosen in Figure 1 were constrained by the
availability of testing data over a time period comparable to our under-ascertainment estimates.
However, all countries under-ascertainment estimates, with or without testing data, are
presented in Additional file 1: Figure S1.
Adjusting confirmed case data for under-ascertainment to obtain estimated symptomatic case curves,
we found a much larger and more peaked epidemic in the ten countries with the highest total number
of confirmed cases and the ten with the highest number of adjusted cases as of 6th July 2020 (Figure
2, with estimates for other countries shown in Additional file 1: Figure S2). Typically, the estimated
peak of symptomatic cases in these countries ranged from 1.4 times (Chile) to 17.8 times larger
(France) than the peak in the reported case data (Table 1). Moreover, in the five countries of these ten
that had a clear initial peak before the end of May 2020, we estimated that the post-peak decline in the
number of infections was steeper than that implied by the confirmed case curves (Figure 2B).

We also compared the estimated proportion of individuals infected in our model with seroprevalence
studies that measured the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We represent our cumulative
incidence estimates in the same form as the observed serological estimates, as a percentage of the
population. This is either the population of the country or the population of some smaller region or
sub-region, depending on the serological dataset. We found that all but one of the published
seroprevalence estimates fell within the 95% credible interval (CrI) of our estimated cumulative
incidence curves over time, with the one exception being Denmark where we underestimated the
observed seroprevalence (Figure 3).

North West and Yorkshire are aggregated together and London is shown above in Panel B:
After adjusting the reconstructed new cases per day curves for potential asymptomatic
infections and for the delay between onset of symptoms and confirmation, we sum up the cases
and divide by the population in each country or region, to estimate the total percentage infected.
We are then able to directly compare the model estimates to existing seroprevalence results
(black points, with 95% binomial CI above and below). Dashed line shows the end of the
serological testing period, therefore we lag the seroprevalence estimate by the mean delay
between infection-to-seroconversion, which is likely to be around 14 days ​(19)​.
Applying our estimation method to all countries for which case and death time series data are
available, we produced a map of seroprevalence estimates as of 16th June (Figure 4A), suggesting that
most infections by this point had been concentrated in Europe and the US. We estimate that between
0.02% - 15% of populations in Europe have been infected. As of the middle of May, cases were in
Latin America and Africa. For both continents combined, we estimate that between 0.00% - 3.48% of
the population of these two continents had been infected as of 16 June 2020. We also reconstructed
the early progression of the COVID-19 pandemic across Europe (Figure 4B), finding that the
estimated infection prevalence over time was an order of magnitude higher than the confirmed case
numbers suggest, with prevalence growing rapidly in late February and early March in several
countries.

Discussion
The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 mean that a large proportion of
infections may go undetected ​(13,20)​. In the absence of serological data, the ratio between cases and
deaths, adjusted for delays from confirmation-to-outcome, can be used to derive estimates of the
proportion of symptomatic cases reported. Using this approach, we estimated that case ascertainment
dropped substantially in many countries during the peak of their first epidemic wave. Although
serological surveys are beginning to emerge ​(20)​, many countries do not have such data available, or
may only have results from a single cross-sectional survey. The methods and estimates presented here
can therefore provide an ongoing picture of the underlying epidemics, including local level dynamics
as fine-scale surveillance data become available ​(21,22)​.
Our analysis has some limitations. We assumed the age-adjusted baseline CFR was 1.4% (95% CrI:
1.2% - 1.5%) (4), which is broadly consistent with other published estimates ​(5,23,24)​, and we
assumed a range of 10% - 70% of infections were asymptomatic ​(20,25,26)​ with a mean value of 50%
(12)​. Given the uncertainty in these estimates, we propagated the variance in baseline CFR and range
in proportion asymptomatic in the inference process so the final 95% credible interval reported for
under-ascertainment reflects underlying uncertainty in the model parameters. We also assumed that
deaths from COVID-19 are accurately reported. If local testing capacity is limited, or if testing policy
affects attribution of deaths (for example, the evidence for the efficacy of post-mortem swabbing is
lacking), deaths can be misattributed to a cause other than COVID-19. In that case, our model may
underestimate the true burden of infection. For example, in Peru between 1st April and 1st July 2020,
there were excess deaths when compared to confirmed COVID deaths and 3396 reported COVID-19

deaths per 100,000 cases, whereas in the United Kingdom there were 199% excess deaths, and 23,642
reported COVID-19 deaths per 100,000. There have also been reports of data reporting issues for
several countries ​(27)​. Additionally, if a large proportion of transmission is concentrated within
specific age groups, the effective CFR may be higher or lower than the assumed baseline; with better
age-stratified temporal data on cases and deaths, it would be possible to explore the effect of this in
more detail. However, our estimates were in general consistent with published serological data, where
available, providing evidence that our method was robust for these countries at least.
To compare our estimates against seroprevalence studies, and consistent with other simplifying
assumptions across countries in this study, we assume that there is little or no variation between the
accuracy of the various serological studies included. Including the confidence intervals of each
seroprevalence estimate in the comparison allows for some of this variation to be captured
quantitatively, but most will be missed. However, as the comparison is crude for a number of reasons,
we believe the additional error incurred by such an assumption is minimal. Further, given that our
estimates of under-ascertainment in many countries suggest that the numbers of symptomatic
infections at the peak of the outbreak were one or two orders of magnitude larger than reported cases,
even if deaths are under-reported, our estimates are still likely to be much closer to the true burden
than locally reported cases imply.
Our estimates of under-ascertainment over time require a time-series of COVID-19 deaths as an input,
a data source that may also exhibit reporting variation. One notable example of this was Spain during
June 2020 (Supplementary Appendix: Figure S1). However, as our Gaussian process model quantifies
time-varying case ascertainment, it is able to account for positive or negative spikes in reporting ​(13)
(see the Estimating under-ascertainment rates section in the Supplementary Appendix for more
details). Finally, our results are limited by the quality of the input data, which is likely to vary in
accuracy between countries. However, as we find good agreement between the 95% credible intervals
of our estimates and seroprevalence studies, we believe that our model accurately captures some of
this variation.
Since the temporal trend in under-ascertainment does not necessarily reflect trends in reported cases
or testing effort, evidence synthesis methods such as the one presented here can provide additional
insights into whether observed case patterns reflect the underlying epidemic dynamics. In the early
stages of outbreaks, this method can provide an indication of whether a large proportion of cases are
being detected – and hence whether transmission may be containable with targeted measures such as
isolation and contact tracing – or whether transmission is more widespread and a more extensive
response is required. Such estimates can also provide insights in the later stages of an outbreak, as
they can indicate high levels of detection in countries that have achieved control. For example, in
Australia, an adapted version of our model estimated that 80% (95% CrI: 55% - 100%) of cases had
likely been ascertained during the outbreak ​(22)​. By adjusting for under-ascertainment, it is also
possible to reconstruct the temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 internationally. During February and
early March 2020, importations of SARS-CoV-2 into the UK came primarily from Italy, Spain and
France ​(28)​. This is consistent with the inferred progression of infection during this period in our
model; we estimated that Italy, Spain, France and Belgium all had over 6.5% of the population
infected by 31st March 2020 ​(28)​.

Conclusion
Consistent with other studies ​(3,20)​, we estimated that the true numbers of symptomatic cases and
infections are appreciably larger than the number of confirmed cases reported (Figures 1 and 2). We
also estimated that the timing of the peak level of symptomatic cases may be considerably earlier or
later than the raw confirmed case curve suggests (Table 1). Accurate surveillance of an ongoing
outbreak is crucial for estimating key epidemiological values such as the reproduction number, and
hence evaluating the impact of control measures (21). If reported case numbers do not reflect the
shape and magnitude of the underlying epidemic, it may bias estimates of transmission potential and
effectiveness of interventions. If levels of under-ascertainment are increasing, early interventions may
appear to be more effective than they actually are, which could lead to delays in imposing more
stringent measures. Likewise, if ascertainment increases in the declining phase of an epidemic, the
effectiveness of interventions may be underestimated, potentially leading to measures remaining in
place for longer than they would have been had more accurate data been available.

under-reporting for all countries with greater than 10 deaths for more than 50 days. ​Figure S2:
Temporal variation in testing effort for all countries there was data for in the Our World In Data
database (17). ​Figure S3:​ the relationship between case ascertainment and testing effort. We define
testing effort as the 7-day moving average of the number of new tests per new case each day. We plot
the under-ascertainment estimates along with the testing effort estimates for all countries we have
both data for. We then fit, using a loess curve to highlight the positive but weak relationship
(, where is Kendall’s rank coefficient). ​Figure S4:​ Temporal variation in under-ascertainment and
testing effort for the nine countries with the maximum total cases that we have reliable testing effort
estimates for. This figure differs from Figure 1 as the results are computed using the indirectly
age-adjusted baseline CFR for each country. ​Figure S5:​ Confirmed case curves adjusted for temporal
under-ascertainment adjusted indirectly for age. The results are similar to those in Figure 2 but have
been computed using an indirectly age-adjusted baseline CFR for each country. ​Figure S6:​ Estimated
infection prevalence curves compared with observed seroprevalence data. The results are similar to
those in Figure 3 but have been computed using an indirectly age-adjusted baseline CFR for each
country. ​Figure S7:​ Temporal variation in under-reporting for all countries with greater than 10
deaths for more than 50 days. The results are similar to those in Figure S1 but have been computed

Table 1: Comparison between the confirmed and adjusted case numbers at their respective peaks
for ten countries with the highest number of total confirmed cases and ten countries with the
highest number of symptomatic cases after adjusting for under-ascertainment. ​Eight countries are
in both lists, so the total is twelve distinct countries.​ ​We find that the peak of the case curves
shifts when they are adjusted for under-ascertainment. Clearly, Mexico and Brazil haven’t
necessarily peaked yet, given that they are not as far along their epidemic as the other countries.
Therefore, for these countries, we simply report the date and number of the highest number of
cases to-date.
