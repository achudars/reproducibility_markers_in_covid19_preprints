Key messages
1. What is already known about this subject?
Healthcare workers and other keyworkers (workers whose job was considered
essential to societal functioning) had a higher likelihood of testing positive for COVID19 than other workers during the first lockdown in England. Amongst healthcare
workers, those working in inpatient settings had the highest rate of infection.

2. What are the new findings?
Between March and July 2000, the overall risk of COVID-19 sickness absence in
National Health Service staff in England was lower at older ages, higher in non-white
staff, and (in comparison with administrative and clerical staff) more than doubled in
registered nurses and among workers such as healthcare assistants providing support
to health professionals. Risk in health care scientists was little different from that in
administrative and clerical occupations

3. How might this impact on policy or clinical practice in the foreseeable future?
Our results suggest that the risk reduction strategies that were in place for healthcare
scientists were effective. However, the protection for nursing and supporting health
professionals was insufficient. In the event of a further ‘wave’ of infections resulting in
high hospital admissions, attention should be paid to ensuring that risk reduction
strategies for nurses and supporting health professionals are improved.

Abstract
Objective
To quantify occupational risks of Covid-19 among healthcare staff during the first wave of the
pandemic in England

Methods
Using pseudonymised data on 902,813 individuals continuously employed by 191 National
Health Service trusts during 1.1.19 to 31.7.20, we explored demographic and occupational
risk factors for sickness absence ascribed to Covid-19 during 9.3.20 to 31.7.20 (n = 92,880).
We estimated odds ratios (ORs) by multivariable logistic regression.

Results
With adjustment for employing trust, demographic characteristics, and previous frequency of
sickness absence, risk relative to administrative/clerical occupations was highest in
additional clinical services (including care assistants) (OR 2.31 [2.25-2.37]), registered
nursing and midwifery professionals (OR 2.28 [2.23-2.34]) and allied health professionals
(OR 1.94 [1.88-2.01]), and intermediate in doctors and dentists (OR 1.55 [1.50-1.61]).
Differences in risk were higher after the employing trust had started to care for documented
Covid-19 patients, and were reduced, but not eliminated, following additional adjustment for
exposure to infected patients or materials, assessed by a job-exposure matrix. For
prolonged Covid-19 sickness absence (episodes lasting >14 days), the variation in risk by
staff group was somewhat greater.

Conclusions
After allowance for possible bias and confounding by non-occupational exposures, we
estimated that relative risks for Covid-19 among most patient-facing occupations were
between 1.5 and 2.5. The highest risks were in those working in additional clinical services,
nursing and midwifery and in allied health professions. Better protective measures for these
staff groups should be a priority. Covid-19 may meet criteria for compensation as an
occupational disease in some healthcare occupations.

Introduction
Covid-19, like many communicable diseases, poses an occupational hazard to healthcare
workers. When the first wave of the pandemic hit the UK early in March 2020, precautions
were implemented to reduce transmission to healthcare staff, including identification and
segregation of infected patients, and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). In the
early weeks, however, these measures were far from ideal. Adequate PPE often was in
short supply and much of the UK’s pandemic stockpile contained equipment suitable for an
influenza outbreak, but not for more infectious diseases (1). Additionally, a lack of capacity
meant that testing of patients who might be carrying SARS-CoV-2 was insufficient (2).
Cases of occupationally-acquired disease were therefore to be expected. However, the level
of risk has been uncertain, as has the extent to which it varied between different healthcare
occupations. Better understanding would help in prioritisation of preventive strategies during
further waves of the pandemic, and in the management of similar infectious diseases. It is
also needed to inform decisions on possible compensation for Covid-19 as an occupational
disease in healthcare workers.

Evidence to date has indicated that male healthcare workers (taken as a group), nurses,
nursing assistants and auxiliaries of both sexes have had higher age-adjusted mortality from
Covid-19 in England and Wales compared with the general population (3). Several studies
have found that patient-facing healthcare workers were infected with COVID-19 at
substantially higher rates than non-healthcare workers during the first wave (March–July
2020), although studies differ in their findings as to which groups had been at greatest risk
. Mortality, however, depends not only on risk of contracting Covid-19, but also on

(4-6)

personal vulnerability when infection occurs, which may vary importantly between
occupations. Furthermore, differences in the incidence of infection by occupation may be
driven not only by exposures in the workplace (through proximity to infected colleagues as
well as contact with patients and infected materials), but also away from work. For example,
rates of infection have been higher among people living in large, crowded households (7)

To get further insight regarding occupational risks of Covid-19 in healthcare workers, we
analysed data on sickness absence among employees of National Health Service (NHS)
trusts in England, before and after they started to care for patients known to have the
disease.

With approval by the NHS Health Research Authority (reference 20/SC/0282), we were
allowed access to two pseudonymised databases prepared by the NHS Electronic Staff
Record (ESR) Central Team. They contained information on demographic and occupational
characteristics of all staff continuously employed by NHS trusts in England from 01.01.2019
to 31.07.2020, and on all their absences from work during that period, other than for annual
leave. The latter included the reason for absence, and the start and end date of each
episode.

Supplementary File A describes the methods by which we used the two databases to create
a file for statistical analysis. We first checked for missing and inconsistent data, and
corrected clear anomalies in a small minority of records by imputation according to a
standard set of rules. We also reclassified some variables into aggregated categories that
would facilitate more meaningful analysis. We then generated a file with one record for each
individual, which included the variables listed in Table 1, and also the start and end dates of
all absences during 01.01.2019 to 31.07.2020, with the reason for absence.

**exposure categories are based on the constructed job-exposure matrix (JEM). For more
information see Supplementary file A.

Staff group was assigned to 10 categories, according to a classification used in the ESR
records (Supplementary File A – Table A1). The ESR system also held more detailed
occupational data but to protect privacy that could not be released. Instead, four members of
the team (an occupational hygienist and three occupational physicians with experience in the
NHS) compiled a job-exposure matrix (JEM), which the ESR Management Team then used
to reclassify detailed occupational categories (n=659) to the eight exposure categories listed
in Table 1.

Within the ESR database, the reason for any type of absence was described by four
variables (Supplementary File A). The 192 different combinations were collapsed into 60
categories, of which 32 were related to sickness absence. Using the information on absence
episodes, we defined a variable which for each individual represented the number of new
episodes of sickness absence (for any cause) that had started during 2019 (classified as 0,
1, 2-3 and >3). This was intended as a marker for long-term propensity to take sickness
absence, which can vary importantly between individuals independently of morbidity (8). In
addition, we distinguished episodes of Covid-19 sickness absence, which we defined as
being for any of five categories of sickness (cough/flu, chest/respiratory, infectious diseases,
other or unknown) with Covid-19 recorded as a related reason. Such episodes were classed
as prolonged if their duration exceeded 14 days (see Supplementary File B).

Data on the date by which each trust was known to have admitted at least three Covid-19
cases were obtained from an NHS COVID-19 daily situation report published on 12.11.2020
(9). We took 09.03.2020 as the date from which Covid-19 sickness absence could
reasonably be assumed to reflect coronavirus infection. That was at least 10 days before
most hospitals started to admit documented Covid-19 cases (see Supplementary File B for
further justification).

Two collaborating trusts provided data on antibody tests that had been carried out on staff
members before 07.08.2020. Individuals were identified by an encrypted code number that
had been assigned by the ESR Management Team, allowing anonymised linkage with the
other records to which we had access.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out with R (version 4.0.4) software. We first generated
descriptive statistics summarising the distributions of the main variables. We then fitted two
multivariable logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence
intervals (95%CIs) for the start of any episode of Covid-19 sickness absence from
09.03.2020 to 31.07.2020. Model 1 included sex, age group, ethnicity, episodes of sickness
absence in 2019 and staff group, while in model 2 the exposure category variable was
additionally included to help understand the extent to which associations with staff group
reflected patient-related exposures.

Next, the analysis was repeated, distinguishing between onset of the Covid-19 sickness
absence before and after the employing trust had first cared for at least three documented
Covid-19 cases. Our aim was to distinguish periods when acquisition of Covid-19 through
transmission from patients was less and more likely; we incorporated a lag of four days to
allow for an interval between exposure to infection and development of symptoms.

Further logistic regression models were used to explore risk factors for prolonged Covid-19
sickness absence starting during 09.03.2020 16.07.2020 (because records were complete
only up to 31.07.2020, we could not be confident of accurately distinguishing prolonged
episodes that started after 16.07.2020).

Finally, to check on the reliability of Covid-19 sickness absence as a marker for the disease,
we used data from two collaborating trusts to compare the prevalence of positive antibody
tests in employees who underwent testing before 07.08.2020, according to their history of
Covid-19 sickness absence.

As sensitivity analyses, we excluded individuals in whom one or more of the age, sex or
ethnicity variables was imputed because of inconsistencies, individuals with multiple jobs or
whose job changed over the study period, or individuals with missing or imputed end date of
an absence.

Results
After exclusion of 21,775 employees who were absent from work continuously from
09.03.2020 to 31.07.2020 (mainly because of maternity or study leave), and 56,543 at nine
trusts which never coded whether sickness absence was related to Covid-19, analysis was
based on 902,813 individuals (77% female) from 191 trusts. Most (89%) were aged between
25 and 60 years, and 76% were of white ethnicity. A total of 92,880 (10%) had one or more
episodes of Covid-19 sickness absence during the study period, including 20,988 (2.3%) in
whom at least one episode was prolonged. Table 1 gives further information about the
distribution of risk factors in the study sample, and the cumulative prevalence of Covid-19
sickness absence over the study period, according to those risk factors.

Table 2 shows associations of Covid-19 sickness absence at any time during the study
period with the main risk factors of interest. After adjustment for other covariates, risk was
similar in men and women, and in age groups below 55 years, but lower at older ages (OR
for age >60 relative to <30 years in fully adjusted model: 0.76). Risk was generally higher for
non-white relative to white ethnicity, and particularly for those of Asian origin (ORs 1.43 and
1.73 in fully adjusted model). Frequency of sickness absence during 2019 was a further risk
factor, with an OR of 2.41 for >3 relative to 0 episodes in the fully adjusted model.

Table 2. Associations of risk factors at baseline with start of any Covid-19 sickness absence
during 9 March to 31 July 2020
Risk estimates were derived from two logistic regression models that included all of the
variables for which results are presented, together with trust (191 categories).

With no adjustment for exposure category, ORs varied more than twofold across the ten staff
groups, the lowest risk being in administrative and clerical jobs (the reference for other risk
estimates), and the highest in additional clinical services (OR 2.31), registered nursing and
midwifery professionals (OR 2.28), allied health professionals (OR 1.94) and students (OR
1.87). Risk in doctors and dentists was intermediate (OR 1.55), while that in health care
scientists was little different from administrative and clerical occupations (OR 1.17).

Exposure category showed an expected gradient of risk, with the highest ORs (relative to no
patient care and only occasionally in patient areas) for hands-on or face-to-face care of
patients likely to have a higher prevalence of Covid-19 than the general population (ORs
1.48 and 1.43). After adjustment for exposure category, the risk estimates for other staff
groups relative to administrative and clerical jobs were all reduced. However, Covid-19
sickness absence was still notably more frequent among those working in additional clinical
services (OR 1.63) and in registered nursing and midwifery professionals (OR 1.57). Reanalysis excluding individuals with imputed or missing data gave similar results
(Supplementary File C – Table C1).

Most (75%) of the 191 trusts had cared for at least three documented Covid-19 patients by
12 April 2020, but 25 (12.5%) had still not done so by 31.07.2020. The latter were mainly
mental health and specialist (e.g. orthopaedic) trusts. Before trusts had cared for three
documented Covid-19 patients, ORs for Covid-19 sickness absence relative to
administrative and clerical workers were highest in additional clinical services (1.85),
registered nurses and midwives (1.81), doctors and dentists (1.66) and allied health
professionals (1.62) (Table 3). After trusts had started to care for Covid-19 patients, the
ranking of risks by staff group was broadly similar, but the divergence of ORs was greater
(2.71 for additional clinical services and 2.70 for registered nurses and midwives). For
doctors and dentists, the OR was somewhat reduced (1.45).

Table 4 presents an analysis similar to that in Table 2, but with prolonged Covid-19 sickness
absence as the outcome. Individuals with only shorter durations of Covid19 sickness
absence were excluded, and risk estimates are relative to no Covid-19 sickness absence.
Notable differences from the findings for all Covid-19 sickness absence were a progressive
increase in risk across age bands (OR for age >60 vs.<30 years 2.15 in fully adjusted
model), higher ORs for non-white vs. white ethnicity, higher risk estimates for additional
clinical services and registered nurses and midwives (ORs of 2.88 and 2.59 respectively,
reducing to 1.88 and 1.60 after adjustment for exposure category), and lower risk estimates

At the two collaborating trusts, results from antibody tests performed by 7 August 2020 were
available for 11,050 staff members. The overall prevalence of positive results among those
who had taken Covid-19 sickness absence (37.0%) was 3.3 times that in those who had not
(11.1%). There were no differences in this ratio by staff group that could not easily be
attributable to random sampling variation (Table 5).

Discussion
After allowance for employing trust, demographic characteristics, and previous frequency of
sickness absence, we found more than twofold variation in the risk of Covid-19 sickness
absence across major NHS staff groups in England. Differences were reduced, but not
eliminated, following adjustment for potential exposure to infected patients or materials,
assessed by a JEM. For prolonged Covid-19 sickness absence, the variation in risk was
greater.

The analysis benefitted from a large sample size, giving high statistical power, and from its
use of data collected prospectively in a standardised format. Information about employing
trust, sex, age, staff group and frequency of earlier sickness absence should all have been
highly reliable, and we would not expect serious misclassification between the specified
categories of ethnicity. A limitation was that staff group distinguished only broad categories
of work. Ideally, analysis would have discriminated between occupations in finer detail, but
access to that level of information was precluded by data protection rules. We therefore
constructed a JEM to group the 659 occupations in the ESR database to eight exposure
categories.

As an indicator of occupational exposure to infection from patients, the JEM should have
been superior to staff group. For example, within medical and dental personnel, it
distinguished specialists in intensive care, expected to have high exposure to patients with
Covid-19, from orthopaedic surgeons, whose patients would be expected to have lower
prevalence of the disease. However, even in the detailed occupational classification to which
the JEM was applied, some job categories were heterogeneous (e.g. nurses in medical
wards could not be distinguished from those working in surgery). Moreover, it did not allow
for changes in duties during the epidemic, or for use of PPE and its effectiveness. In early
April 2020, workers with a long-term condition such as asthma, were advised by
Government that they should ‘shield’ and either work from home or not work at all. The
health-related characteristics that prompted advice to shield are associated with higher risk
of severe outcomes (vulnerability) should an individual contract Covid-19, but not with a
higher risk of contracting infection. To bias associations of staff group with sickness absence
for Covid-19 importantly, shielding would need to have been substantially more prevalent in
some occupational groups than others. This seems unlikely, but if anything, redeployment
out of patient-facing roles would be expected to reduce risk estimates for patient-facing
occupations.
Thus, the observed associations with the two highest JEM categories, even after adjustment
for staff group, support its validity. However, the varying specificity of occupational
15

categories in the JEM complicates interpretation of numerical estimates of risk for exposure
levels. Also, the heterogeneous mix of occupations in individual exposure categories, makes
it harder to assess the potential for confounding by non-occupational exposures. For these
reasons, we focused principally on risk by staff group (a well-established classification of
jobs), and used exposure category to help understand the extent to which associations with
staff group reflected patient-related exposures. .

The other major limitation was the incomplete validity of sickness absence as a marker for
Covid-19. Early in the epidemic, diagnostic tests were not widely available, and clinical
diagnoses may not have been accurate. Nevertheless, at the trusts which provided data,
antibody tests were more than three times as likely to be positive among individuals who had
taken Covid-19 sickness absence.

In assessing relative risks by staff group, we adjusted for demographic variables, for trust
and for frequency of sickness absence in 2019. The latter was intended as a marker of
individual propensity to take sickness absence when ill and showed an expected association
with Covid-19 sickness absence. Adjustment for trust was important because rates of
infection were known to have varied geographically (10). Moreover, there may have been
systematic differences between trusts in the ascertainment and coding of reasons for
absence.

In all analyses, we took administrative and clerical workers as the reference for risks in other
staff groups. Making up 21.5% of the study sample, they encompassed a range of
occupations, including senior managers as well as middle-grade administrative occupations,
clerical workers and receptionists. Most will have been office-based, with little or no direct
patient contact, and during the epidemic, some may have worked partially or totally from
home. Their work may have entailed social contact with colleagues, but not at a level higher
than in many occupations outside healthcare. Furthermore, their socio-economic
circumstances will have been neither exceptionally good nor poor. Thus, within the
demographic strata that we distinguished, their exposures to SARS-CoV-2 should have been
representative of the wider working population in their local area.

An indication of differences in risk between staff groups for reasons other than patient-care
comes from analysis restricted to the period before each trust began to care for documented
Covid-19 cases (Table 3). During that phase, much of the observed variation in risk might be
expected to reflect exposure to infection away from work, or through proximity to infected
colleagues. However, the highest ORs (between 1.6 and 1.9) were all in patient-facing
16

occupations, suggesting that there may also have been some unrecognised contact with
infected patients.

Once trusts were known to be caring for Covid-19 patients, the ORs for most of these
occupations were higher, excess relative risks (estimated as OR-1) increasing by 0.6-0.9
(Table 3). An exception were doctors and dentists, in whom ORs were lower when trusts
were known to be caring for Covid-19 patients. This may have been because in the early
phase of the epidemic, some doctors contracted infection from undiagnosed patients, but
that risk of was reduced once testing became more widely available.

Another clue to the impact of patient-related exposures on differences in risk between staff
groups is the effect of adjusting risk estimates for exposure category (Table 2). ORs reduced
for all staff groups, as expected given a partial correlation between staff group and exposure
category. However, the reductions were greatest for patient-facing occupations. For
example, the OR for additional clinical services (a group that included care assistants) fell
from 2.31 to 1.63, and that for registered nurses and midwives from 2.28 to 1.57. Such
changes point strongly to an important contribution from patient-related exposures, but
because of the limitations of the JEM, may not have captured them fully.

When allowance is made for the inaccuracy of sickness absence as a marker for disease,
and the possibility of a small occupational risk in the reference group of administrative and
clerical workers, the results in Tables 2 and 3 suggest that occupational exposures
increased the risk of contracting Covid-19 in additional clinical services, registered nurses
and midwives, and allied health professionals by a factor of between 1.5 and 2.5. The
average relative risk in doctors and dentists appears to have been somewhat lower, but still
elevated. Few studies have explored infection rates of Covid-19 in healthcare staff by
occupational group during the first wave of infection in England. Zheng, in a study of 1045
staff at a London hospital tested in March/April 2020, found a higher than expected rate of
Covid-19 positivity and correspondingly high Covid-19 sickness absence episodes in
medical and dental, nursing, midwifery and additional clinical services staff (2). In a study of
11,500 staff at Oxford University Hospitals, tested between March and early June, porters
and cleaners had the highest rates of Covid-19 positivity (3).

In our study, it is notable that risk among laboratory scientists was little higher than in
administrative and clerical occupations. This suggests that even early in the epidemic,
precautions against transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through the handling of clinical samples
were effective.

While our main outcome measure was cumulative prevalence of any Covid-19 sickness
absence, we also explored risk factors for longer episodes, expecting that prolonged
absence might have higher specificity as a marker for Covid-19. Moreover, it would tend to
reflect more disabling disease of the type most likely to be considered for compensation. A
complication is that it will have depended not only the risk of contracting infection, but also
on personal vulnerability once infection occurred. Thus, while risk of any Covid-19 sickness
absence was lowest in the oldest age group, that of prolonged absence increased with age
(a major determinant of vulnerability (11)). Similarly, the higher risk of prolonged Covid-19
sickness absence among non-white ethnic groups may have been a consequence of higher
vulnerability (11). This will be explored further in a separate report.

For most staff groups, ORs were higher for prolonged than for any Covid-19 sickness
absence (Table 4), reinforcing the case for a relative risk in the order of two from
occupational exposures. The occupational hazard in medical and dental personnel may have
been obscured by relatively low vulnerability to severe disease.

Our analysis suggests that during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in England,
occupationally-attributable relative risks for Covid-19 among most patient-facing occupations
in healthcare workers were in the order of 1.5 to 2.5. For medical and dental personnel,
relative risks were a little lower, but still elevated. Better protective measures for these
groups should be a priority in the future. Whether relative risks are sufficient to warrant
compensation for Covid-19 as an occupational disease in healthcare workers will depend on
the regulatory framework, and the required confidence of occupational attribution.
