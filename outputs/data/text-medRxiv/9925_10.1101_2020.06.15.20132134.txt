Abstract

A significant fraction of people who test positive for COVID-19 have chemosensory
deficits. However, the reported prevalence of these deficits in smell and/or taste varies
widely, and the reason for the differences between studies is unclear. We determined
the pooled prevalence of such chemosensory deficits in a systematic review. We
searched the COVID-19 portfolio of the National Institutes of Health for all studies that
reported the prevalence of smell and/or taste deficits in patients diagnosed with COVID19. Forty-two studies reporting on 23,353 patients qualified and were subjected to a
systematic review and meta-analysis. Estimated random prevalence of olfactory
dysfunction was 38.5%, of taste dysfunction was 30.4% and of overall chemosensory
dysfunction was 50.2%. We examined the effects of age, disease severity, and ethnicity
on chemosensory dysfunction. The effect of age did not reach significance, but
anosmia/hypogeusia decreased with disease severity, and ethnicity was highly
significant: Caucasians had a 3-6 times higher prevalence of chemosensory deficits
than East Asians. The finding of ethnic differences points to genetic, ethnicity-specific
differences of the virus-binding entry proteins in the olfactory epithelium and taste buds
as the most likely explanation, with major implications for infectivity, diagnosis and
management of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction

The first reports of disturbances of smell and taste in COVID-19 patients emerged in
February and March of 2020. Initially, these reports were anecdotal, but soon articles
consistently described an increased prevalence of chemosensory deficits. Many of the
earliest studies were compiled in six recent reviews (da Costa et al., 2020; Passarelli et
al., 2020; Pellegrino et al., 2020; Printza and Constantinidis, 2020; Sedaghat et al.,
2020; Tong et al., 2020). Two of these reviews (Passarelli et al., 2020; Tong et al.,
2020) conducted a meta-analysis of 6 and 10 studies, respectively, the other four were
narrative reviews (da Costa et al., 2020; Pellegrino et al., 2020; Printza and
Constantinidis, 2020; Sedaghat et al., 2020). Studies reported prevalence of
chemosensory dysfunction with wide ranges, between 5% and 98% for anosmia, and
between 6% and 93% for taste dysfunctions (Tong et al., 2020). The reasons for
differences in the prevalence reported in different studies were thought to be due to
differences in the age of patients, in assessment methods, or in the severity of the
disease. In addition, patient selection was thought to play a role ‚Äì since some data were
from hospitalized patients, others from clinic visits, and cohorts were from different
countries, and data obtained with different study designs. Most studies relied on the
patients‚Äô subjective impressions about sensation of smell or taste.
To gain a more comprehensive and conclusive account of the prevalence of
chemosensory deficits in COVID-19, we conducted a systematic review and metaanalysis of 42 studies that reported on the chemosensory function of 23,353 patients
diagnosed with COVID-19. We included preprints of not yet peer-reviewed studies, up
to the posting on June 10, 2020. Because we considered a larger number of studies
and larger cohort numbers than previous reviews, we provide a clearer picture of the
true prevalence, and, importantly, we stratified and examined confounding variables
such as age, methodology, disease severity, and ethnicity. We report that ethnicity is a
significant factor. The finding of ethnic differences has important implications for the
diagnosis of COVID-19, and for the management of the pandemic in countries with
different ethnic populations.

Results
We adhered to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses
(PRISMA), as shown in the flowchart (Fig. 1). Our search strategy retrieved 42 studies
that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, reporting on 46 distinct cohorts, with prevalence
information on a total of 23,353 patients from 18 different countries. Studies are from
multiple countries (Lechien et al., 2020a; Qiu et al., 2020), from Italy (Giacomelli et al.,
2020; Vaira et al., 2020b; Spinato et al., 2020; Vaira et al., 2020c; Gelardi et al., 2020;
Meini et al., 2020; Boscolo-Rizzo et al., 2020), Germany (Streeck, 2020; Luers et al.,
2020; Bertlich et al., 2020; Hornuss et al., 2020; Haehner et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020),
France (Klopfenstein et al., 2020; Lechien et al., 2020b; Zayet et al., 2020; Tudrej et al.,
2020; Qiu et al., 2020), Spain (Beltran-Corbellini et al., 2020; Borobia et al., 2020;
Abalo-Lojo et al., 2020; Romero-Sanchez et al., 2020), USA (Yan et al., 2020a; Yan et
al., 2020b; Kaye et al., 2020; Menni et al., 2020), China (Mao et al., 2020; Qiu et al.,
2020), Korea (Rabin, 2020; Lee et al., 2020), Singapore (Wee et al., 2020; Kai Chua et
al., 2020), UK (Patel et al., 2020; Menni et al., 2020), Canada (Carignan et al., 2020;
Lee et al., 2020), Iceland (Gudbjartsson et al., 2020), Israel (Levinson et al., 2020), Iran
(Moein et al. 2020), Holland (Tostmann et al., 2020), Switzerland (Speth et al., 2020),
Belgium (Lechien et al., 2020c), Greece (Tsivgoulis et al., 2020), and Japan
(Komagamine and Yabuki , 2020). The included studies are listed chronologically and
by geographic region (East Asia vs Europe/ Middle East/ North America) in Table 1.
Whether some patients had both, smell and taste dysfunction was stated explicitly only
in a fraction of studies or was apparent from the numbers given (19/46 cohorts, Table
1).
The overall estimated random prevalence of smell loss among COVID-19 patients,
calculated from a total of 38 cohorts containing 12,154 persons, was 38.48% [95%
confidence interval (CI), 28.33-49.74%]. The meta-analysis indicated that betweenstudy variability in prevalence of smell loss was high (ùúè2 = 1.99; heterogeneity I2 = 98.9%
with Q = 3363.4, df = 37 and p = 0.999; Higgins and Thompson, 2002) and examination
of the funnel plots, as expected, showed evidence of publication bias (Fig. 2A). The 30
cohorts with information on taste loss contained a total of 9,589 patients. The overall

estimated random prevalence of taste loss among COVID-19 patients was 30.37%
[95% CI, 20.07-43.11%]; the analysis indicated that between-study variability was high
(ùúè2 = 2.2449; heterogeneity I2 = 98.8% with Q = 2341.1, df = 29 and p = 0.999; Fig. 2B).
When smell and taste loss were combined, the overall estimated random prevalence
obtained from 23,353 patients in 46 cohorts was 50.20% [95% CI, 41.51-58.88%]; the
analysis showed high heterogeneity with some publication bias (Fig. 2C).

There was a significant difference between countries with majority East Asians and
countries with majority Caucasians in the prevalence of smell, taste and any
chemosensory dysfunction. Ethnicity was tested for all three subgroups (loss of smell,
loss of taste, and loss of smell and/or taste) and was highly significant in all three
categories with p ‚â§ 0.0006 (Figs. 3A-C). There were 33 studies available on smell loss
in Caucasians and five studies on East Asians. Ethnicity of participants explained a
significant amount of heterogeneity in smell loss (Q = 11.9, df = 1, p = 0.0006; Fig. 3A).
The estimated random prevalence of smell loss was 43.2% [95% CI, 31.9-55.3%] for
Caucasians and 15.1% [95% CI, 8.3-25.7%] for East Asians (Fig. 3A). The estimated
prevalence of patients with loss of taste was 38.3% [95% CI, 27.0-51.0%] among
Caucasians and significantly lower, only 6.4% [95% CI, 5.7-51.0%], among East Asians
(Q = 65.87, df = 1, p < 0.0001; Fig. 3B). Overall estimates of chemosensory deficits
were nearly three times higher for Caucasians than East Asians and also showed high
heterogeneity and evidence of publication bias (Figs. 2C and 3C). Differences in
chemosensory deficits between East Asians and Caucasians are further illustrated in
Figure 4, with the prevalence shown in a world heat map, with the cohort size indicated
by the size of the circles, and in the bar graphs in Figure 5.

Disease severity. As a measure of disease severity, we used information about
hospitalization rates within cohorts. The weighted regression analyses showed a
significant negative influence of the percent of the cohort that was hospitalized during
data collection on the proportion of patients with loss of smell, taste, and loss of smell
and/or taste (Fig. 6). The beta coefficients for the effect of disease severity on loss of
smell (b = -0.0261, p = 0.0018) and taste (b = -0.0262, p = 0.0035) showed that both

were reported less frequently in cohorts as the number of individuals in the cohort who
were hospitalized increased. This result was even more highly significant when loss of
smell and taste were combined (b = -0.0216, p < 0.0001; Fig. 6, Table 2). Accordingly,
patients with severe COVID-19 report fewer smell/taste dysfunctions.
Age. The subgroup tests for the effect of cohort age on smell loss showed some
indication of a negative association (b = -0.0562, p = 0.0568), while tests for the effect
of cohort age on taste showed none (b = -0.0076, p = 0.8336; Table 2), and a significant
negative association was found when loss of smell and taste were combined (b = 0.0532, p = 0.0148) suggesting that increasing age may result in a lower reporting of
loss of sensory deficits in general.
Methodology. The subgroup test to compare studies that used subjective or objective
measures for loss of sensory function was possible only for Caucasians (there were too
few studies for East Asians), and it showed no significant differences (in all cases p ‚â•
0.1564). For loss of smell, studies that used objective measures had an estimated random
prevalence of 59.66% [95% CI, 27.16-85.43%] while those that used subjective measures
had a prevalence of 42.22% [95%CI, 30.54-54.84%]. For loss of taste, the prevalence
among the studies with objective measures was no different than among those with
subjective measures (q = 2.01, p = 0.1564), with an estimated random prevalence of
25.99% [95% CI, 12.52-46.29%] and 43.12% [CI 95%, 29.99-57.28%], for objective vs.
subjective

measures.

When

the

endpoints

were

combined,

the resulting prevalence for objective measures was 69.68% [95%CI, 44.95-86.61%],
which again was not significantly different from that of subjective measures (56.85%
[95%CI, 48.41-64.91%]; q = 1.00, p = 0.3168). Sample sizes were as follows: smell:
objective measures = 6, subjective measures = 25; taste: objective measures = 4,
subjective measures = 20; smell and/or taste: objective measures = 6, subjective
measures = 31.
Nasal congestion/rhinorrhea. If the anosmia was caused by nasal congestion, as is
common in cases of viral infection, then most, if not all COVID-19 patients with anosmia
would be expected to have nasal congestion/rhinorrhea. However, our data shows that

a weighted mean of 58.6% of COVID-19 patients with anosmia did not have nasal
congestion/ obstruction or rhinorrhea, based on n= 17 studies with a total cohort size of
4,121, consistent with the conclusion of a previous report (Lechien et al., 2020d).
Duration of chemosensory dysfunction. Based on the studies that provided such
information, the average duration of smell dysfunction was 9.03 days ¬± 1.32 (SEM, n= 9
studies with a total cohort number of 2,826), and 12.64 ¬± 2.51 days for taste dysfunction
(n=4 studies with total cohort number of 293). Duration of smell dysfunction appears
shorter, but duration of taste dysfunction is based on a small number of studies (n=4).
Possibility of bias. The majority of the studies are cross-sectional, retrospective
observational studies, and therefore, recollection bias may be present. Most studies are
similar to those previously graded as ‚Äúmoderate risk of bias‚Äù (Tong et al., 2020; see also
da Costa et al., 2020). Potential weaknesses are that measures mostly were not
validated (Pellegrino et al., 2020), but it has to be considered that data were collected
during an unprecedented pandemic when using more time-consuming assessment tools
was not possible due to increased risk of virus spreading. The sample size for East
Asian studies was small, but with n ‚â• 4, it was sufficient for each of the reported
comparisons (Fu et al., 2011).

Discussion
The literature on the prevalence of chemosensory dysfunctions in COVID-19 has been
evolving at a rapid pace. In the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic, such
deficits were considered a rare occurrence (Chen et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020; Mao et
al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; reviewed in da Costa et al., 2020). The first report of smell
and taste dysfunction that recognized this condition as a much more prevalent symptom
(66.7% of COVID-19 patients) was on March 16th, 2020 by a German virologist
(Streeck, 2020). The majority of subsequent studies have confirmed such a high
prevalence outside of East Asia (Table 1; Fig. 3).
Compared with previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses (da Costa et al.,
2020; Passarelli et al., 2020; Pellegrino et al., 2020; Printza and Constantinidis, 2020;
Sedaghat et al., 2020; Tong et al., 2020), our review considers a much larger number of
studies and cohort numbers. We did not include the study by Bagheri et al. (2020),
because subjects in this cohort did not have COVID-19 diagnoses and therefore did not
meet the inclusion criteria, although many of the cases likely were related to COVID-19
(Gane et al., 2020). The study by Bagheri et al. (2020) also failed the inclusion criteria of
the meta-analysis by Passarelli et al., 2020, but was erroneously included in their
analysis.
Why are chemosensory deficits rare in East Asians with COVID-19 compared to
Caucasians?
Some researchers have commented on a possible difference in the frequency of
chemosensory deficits between East Asians and Caucasians with COVID-19 (Lechien
et al., 2020a; Lavato et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020). With the much more extensive
datasets considered in our review (16,817 Caucasians and 6,536 East Asians), we
show that there indeed is a significant difference in prevalence between these two
populations: 3-fold higher for smell, 6-fold higher for taste, and 3-fold higher for smell
and/or taste impairment in Caucasians (Fig. 5). Why is there such a difference? It is
unlikely that such differences are due to the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself.
Studies have failed to identify recent virus mutations that increase viral transmission/

infectivity (van Dorp et al., 2020). As pointed out by Lechien et al., 2020a, the
differences in the prevalence of chemosensory dysfunction may be due to ethnic
differences in the frequency of variants of the ACE2 virus entry protein. Variations in the
ACE2 protein can change virus binding by up to 20-fold (Li et al., 2005), and
glycosylation sites relevant to the binding may be tissue-specific (Bilinska et al., 2020).
ACE2 variants are genetically determined and they are known to differ in frequency
between Europeans and East Asians (Benetti et al., 2020; Cao et al., 2020; Strafella et
al., 2020; Williams et al., 2020). If Caucasians have more often an ACE2 variant
expressed in the olfactory epithelium (presumably in the sustentacular cells of the
olfactory epithelium, Bilinska et al., 2020; Butowt and von Bartheld, submitted), then
these cells may bind SARS-CoV-2 with higher affinity, resulting in anosmia, whereas
East Asians may have less of these ACE2 variants, and therefore will more rarely have
anosmia as part of the COVID-19 symptoms.
Since the nasal epithelium has a larger viral load than respiratory epithelium (Zou
et al., 2020) ‚Äì and the nasal epithelium has increased expression of entry proteins for
the virus (Bilinska et al., 2020) ‚Äì this ethnic difference has potentially far-reaching
implications for infectivity, spread of the virus (frequency of asymptomatic superspreaders, Oran and Topol, 2020), and therefore for successful management of the
pandemic. The frequency of ACE2 variants may make it more difficult in some
ethnicities to control the pandemic, and easier in other ethnicities. The presence of
different ACE2 variants in the nose may, in part, explain the more rapid spread of
COVID-19 in Caucasians and Hispanics, as compared to East Asians, in addition to the
well-known cultural differences in strategies of containment and attitudes about social
distancing and the use of protective measures such as face masks.
Technical aspects and confounding variables
Methodology. Most studies rely on the subject telling the researcher about their
subjective impressions. A relatively small number of studies (7/42) used objective tests
to assess chemosensory dysfunction (Moein et al., 2020; Vaira et al., 2020c; Qiu et al.,
2020; Bertlich et al., 2020; Hornuss et al., 2020; Lechien et al., 2020c; Tsivgoulis et al.,
2020). When smell and taste was objectively tested, the percentage of subjects with
10

dysfunction increased in some of those studies (Moein et al., 2020; Pellegrino et al.,
2020), but in one of these studies, 38% of subjective olfactory loss could not be
objectively confirmed (Lechien et al., 2020c). In our analysis, the difference in
prevalence between studies with objective vs subjective measures did not reach
significance, however, the number of studies using objective measures was small. Self‚Äê
reporting of anosmia is thought to be relatively accurate (90%, Wehling et al., 2011), so
using subjective recall to obtain data on chemosensory deficits appears to be a valid
approach, and, in many instances, it is the only feasible way of data collection during a
raging pandemic.
Olfaction vs. taste. Some of the studies reporting on smell and taste impairment did not
examine taste dysfunction separately from smell dysfunction, but rather asked patients
about ‚Äûsmell and/or taste dysfunction.‚Äù The pooled prevalence of chemosensory
dysfunction that we report is likely an underestimate, because many studies reported
only how many patients had smell deficits and how many had taste deficits, but they did
not report on the potential overlap (there were patients who had both types of
chemosensory dysfunction in at least 19/46 cohorts). Those cases were listed in our
review conservatively, meaning that we did not simply add all cases with smell
dysfunction to those with taste dysfunction, because we know that there is overlap in a
substantial fraction of patients (Table 1). Nevertheless, there is no doubt that a large
fraction of COVID-19 patients (including otherwise asymptomatic carriers) have
chemosensory deficits. Olfaction is used for tasting food (culinary experience) and it can
be difficult to subjectively separate the two modalities (Pellegrino et al., 2020). Since
most studies asked about changes to chemosensory perception, subjects with preexisting loss of smell or taste would not have been included and would not have given
false positives; some studies actively excluded patients with a history of pre-existing
anosmia or ageusia.
Age. Previous investigators have noted that smell and taste dysfunctions appeared to
be more frequent in the younger age groups of COVID-19 patients (e.g., Giacomelli et
al., 2020). Our results are consistent with this finding, although significance was
reached only for the category ‚Äúsmell and/or taste.‚Äù Reduction of smell with age is a well11

known phenomenon (Doty and Kamath, 2014), but the sudden loss of function
coincident with COVID-19 would still be noticeable in the older population.
Duration: Our pooled analysis, based on 9 studies, revealed that the mean duration of
the anosmia is 9 days. This relatively short time has implications for the pathogenetic
mechanism: It seems too short for a functional recovery if such a recovery involved
death and regeneration of olfactory neurons, since their replacement by stem cells
alone takes 9-10 days (Schwob et al., 1995; Schwob, 2002). Alternative mechanisms,
not requiring neuron death, that may explain the transient anosmia include a supportcell mediated dysfunction of the olfactory epithelium (Heydel et al., 2013) or a virusinduced short-lasting immune response (Butowt and Bilinska, 2020), although the extent
of inflammation in the olfactory epithelium in response to SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear
(Vaira et al., 2020b; Torabi et al., 2020).

Methods
We followed the PRISMA guidelines for systematic searches and meta-analyses (Moher
et al., 2009). We searched the COVID-19 Portfolio of the National Institutes of Health
(https://icite.od.nih.gov/covid19/search/) with the key words ‚Äûanosmia‚Äù, ‚Äûsmell,‚Äù or ‚Äûtaste‚Äù
on and before June 10, 2020, resulting in 1,103 records, including preprints posted prior
to peer review. We also examined and included any relevant references within, and
citations of, screened records. Inclusion criteria were that the paper was a novel report
of the prevalence of smell and/or taste impairment in patients verified to have COVID19. We accepted all studies that reported original and quantitative data on prevalence of
chemosensory deficits in human subjects, either obtained by questioning the subjects,
by chart review, or by objective chemosensory testing. We excluded from our
quantitative analysis case reports, reports that did not provide exact quantitative
information, reviews only, and reports of cohorts in which a COVID-19 diagnosis was
not confirmed clinically or by lab tests. We also excluded studies that targeted any
patients with chemosensory deficits, regardless of cause, because they would fail to
provide a true prevalence among COVID-19 (Bagheri et al., 2020; Parma et al., 2020).
We kept data on the two senses, olfaction and taste, separate, when the study reported
them separately. The most common way of reporting in studies was ‚Äûsmell deficit,‚Äù
‚Äútaste deficit,‚Äù or ‚Äûsmell and/or taste deficit,‚Äù and those data were separately compiled
and compared. For this reason, the cohort number for olfactory deficits and gustatory
deficits differs from that of the combined (smell and/or taste) category.
A pooled analysis was performed for prevalence, and significance and
confidence intervals were calculated in the software ‚ÄûR‚Äù. We used R Studio, version
1.2.1335, for statistical analyses (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria). To calculate estimates of pooled prevalence and 95% confidence intervals, we
used the R-meta package, version 4.9-5, and the metaprop function. We used random
effects models with the inverse variance method for pooling and the logit transformation
for proportions (DerSimonian and Laird, 1986). For ease of interpretation, we back
transformed and rescaled proportions to events per 100 observations. Analysis of the
heterogeneity across studies was done using the Maximum-likelihood estimator,

Higgin‚Äôs I2 and Cochran‚Äôs Q method (DerSimonian and Laird, 1986; Higgins and
Thompson, 2002). Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots
(Egger et al., 1997). In all cases, significance was defined at ÔÅ° = 0.05. Subgroup
analysis was conducted by ethnicity, age, hospitalization rate, and methodology.
Ethnicity was coded as a categorical variable with two levels: Caucasian and East
Asian, because of suspected heterogeneity (Lechien et al., 2020a; Lavato et al., 2020;
Qiu et al., 2020) and because these two ethnicities are the only ones for which such
data are currently available. All other subgroup tests used continuous variables and the
metareg function to adjust the overall meta-analysis for the subgroup. The subgroup
age was a created variable that uses the center of the sample, either the mean or the
median, to mark the center of the age distribution. Hospitalization rate was the
percentage of subjects in the sample that were hospitalized for COVID-19.
