Abstract
To examine innate immune responses in early SARS-CoV-2 infection that may change clinical outcomes, we
compared nasopharyngeal swab data from 20 virus-positive and 20 virus-negative individuals. Multiple innate
immune-related and ACE-2 transcripts increased with infection and were strongly associated with increasing
viral load. We found widespread discrepancies between transcription and translation. Interferon proteins were
unchanged or decreased in infected samples suggesting virally-induced shut-off of host anti-viral protein
responses. However, IP-10 and several interferon-stimulated gene proteins increased with viral load. Older age
was associated with modifications of some effects. Our findings may characterize the disrupted immune
landscape of early disease.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
coronavirus-(CoV)-2 infection has afflicted millions following first reports of a novel viral pneumonia on 31
December 2019 in Wuhan, China.1 Rapid publication of molecular characterization of the virus2–4 enabled
multiple instances of successful detection, tracking and containment using public health measures.5–10 In most
localities, however, viral spread has been rapid, widespread and devastating, facilitated by high rates of
transmission often before the appearance of symptoms and followed by elevated rates of morbidity and
mortality.
Silent infection with rapid viral replication allows asymptomatic person-to-person infection.5–7,11
Nasopharyngeal viral loads peak when upper airway symptoms appear,5,12 and the size of the initial viral
innoculum may determine the rapidity of onset and severity of the subsequent clinical syndrome.13 Over days,
sometimes weeks, the infection may extend locally to involve the lower respiratory tract. For a substantial
portion of infected patients, initial fever, dry cough, myalgias and anosmia progress to dyspnea, hypoxemic
respiratory failure and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).14–17
Pathophysiological disturbances of infection are multi-faceted and can be severe. Some of the laboratory
findings include neutrophilia, lymphopenia, decreased T helper and suppressor cells, abnormal platelet function
and coagulation cascade derangements. Substantial numbers of patients progress to clinically severe
vasculitides, thromboembolic disorders, pneumonia or ARDS.18,19
In patients who develop ARDS, dysfunctional innate immune and systemic inflammatory responses
include marked elevations in systemic inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-(IL)-6 and tumor necrosis
factor-(TNF)-α in both serum and airway secretions as well as seemingly insufficient anti-viral interferon (IFN)
responses, all of which have been described as a cytokine storm.20–24 Disruptions in human biochemical marker
responses begin early in disease, as recent evaluations of immunoglobulins and other markers of immune
responses in serum demonstrate.25 Nevertheless, much remains unexplored, particularly in the airway
compartment, the initial site of infection.

Part of the challenge to developing a treatment or prevention response is to elucidate the range of innate
immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection that may precede the cytokine storm seen in severe disease.24,26
Evaluations in ARDS, especially due to severe respiratory viral infections such as Influenza A,23,27,28 Middle
Eastern Respiratory Syndrome,29–31 SARS-CoV32–37 and other highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as Human
CoV-(HCoV)-Erasmus Medical Center (HcoV-EMC)38–40 highlight the broad collection of biomarkers that may
potentially be useful in SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially prior to fulminant disease, uncontrolled systemic
inflammation and ARDS.
Coronaviruses that cause severe human disease are remarkable for their ability to evade innate immune
defenses and to promote dysfunctional responses that appear before cytokine storm.41,42 For example, IFN
responses are critically important for anti-viral defense,43 yet there is no detectable native human IFN response
to SARS-CoV.38 No fewer than 11 of 28 known SARS-CoV proteins interfere with signaling cascades that
produce IFN proteins after endosomal or cytoplasmic viral detection.44 In vitro studies of various human cell
types show that SARS-CoV efficiently suppresses transcription of IFN genes but selectively allows expression
and translation of other genes.45–47 Bronchoalveolar lavage studies of epithelial cells obtained from severely ill
patients following SARS-CoV-2 infection suggest a pathophysiology more consistent with HCoV-EMC or
MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV.21 However both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 stimulate inflammatory signals via
nuclear factor κB (NFκB)44 that recruit polymorphonuclear neutrophils and other immune effector cells to the
lung, releasing proteases that may dramatically further increase viral cell entry.48–50 IFN-α and IFN-β treatments
that bypass some evasion strategies21 have been proposed to counter both SARS-CoV viruses.51–53 However, we
lack efficacy and safety trials free of observer bias,54 and no published human data exists for IFN-λ therapy.
To supplement the growing information on responses early in infection, we undertook an observational
study of deidentified nasopharyngeal swab samples from patients presenting at drive-through testing centers for
evaluation of symptoms potentially due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We selected proteins involved in different
steps of human cellular responses to viral invasion for quantitative measurements by multiple methods to
understand the impact of targeting by viral evasion activities.29,42,44 We selected and measured factors important

for understanding viral entry, intracellular detection of viral invasion, production of pro-inflammatory signals,
systemic inflammatory agents and multiple IFN and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) responses relative to viral loads
to better understand the immune landscape of patients with early disease.

Results
Study Population
We evaluated 40 samples from individuals, evenly divided into 20 positive and 20 negative detection results for
SARS-CoV-2. Samples were deidentified but annotated by age (median 46.5 years, range 11-90) and sex (17
females, 42.5%). Older patients were more likely to be male and negative for SARS-CoV-2 detection
(Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1a and 1b). This limited demographic information suggested
that further evaluation of statistical relationships in our sample set required testing adjustments for age, sex or
both to avoid confounding.
Samples included in our study were randomly selected from those collected from April-June of 2020
from patients who may have come from nine states within the Mountain West of the United States. During this
period, positive results were reported for about 9-10% of tested patients. Among the positive test patients, about
10% eventually required hospitalization for COVID-19 with less than 50% of those hospitalized suffering
respiratory failure, ARDS or succumbing to severe disease. While we know this context for our samples, the
specific outcomes for individual patients in our study are unknown.

Viral Load
Using RT-PCR results, we estimated fold-change in mRNA expression of SARS-CoV-2 small envelope protein
E1 (Odds Ratio [OR] = 10.8 × 106, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 8.37 × 105-1.40 × 108, p < 0.001) and
nucleocapsid protein N1 (OR = 5.1 × 107, CI = 4.5 × 106-5.9 × 108, p < 0.001) relative to expression in patients
without infection. We selected primers55 for E1 originally from Charité, Germany4 and N1 from the US CDC.56

Both E1 and N1 mRNA fold changes gave virtually total discrimination between patients with and without
infection diagnosed by clinical testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection using qualitative RT-PCR.

Viral Entry
We measured two human protein transcripts important for understanding SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, angiotensin
converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), which is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV,48,57 and
transmembrane protease, serine-2 (TMPRSS-2) which enhances cell entry up to a thousand-fold.48,49 ACE-2
mRNA was increased three-fold in patients with infection, and the fold-change results were strongly associated
with viral load. TMPRSS-2 mRNA expression, however, was not associated with infection nor viral load (Figure
1).

Viral Detection Signaling
We examined transcription signals for two genes in the signaling pathway downstream of viral detection
important for IFN responses, TNF-associated factor-binding kinase-1 associated with inhibitor of NFκB (TBK1) and Stimulator of IFN genes-(STING)-1 for six patients with positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 and six
patients with negative detection. The mRNA expressions of TBK-1 and STING-1 were not associated with
infection (Supplementary Figure 2).

Inflammatory Responses to SARS-CoV-2 Infection
We found increased mRNA expression of IL-8, IFN-γ-induced protein-(IP)-10 and TNF-α in SARS-CoV-2infected individuals (Figure 2a-c). Moreover, we found that there was a strong association between viral load
and the level of mRNA expression of these innate immune effector moleculesI agonized (Figure 2f-h).
Viral entry, detection and signaling may lead to a systemic inflammatory response via NFκB activity
which may potentially be augmented by TNF receptor-associated factor-(TRAF)-1 activity.58,59 We found a large
reduction in TRAF-1 mRNA (Figure 2d). The reduction in TRAF-1 was inversely associated with expression of

both viral protein E1 mRNA (OR = 0.945, CI = 0.906-0.986, p = 0.025) and N1 mRNA (OR = 0.947, CI =
0.907-0.989, p = 0.034, Figure 2e). We found NFκB-1 and NFκB-2 mRNA transcripts were not significantly
changed compared to uninfected status (Table 1a). Other downstream immune effectors, granulocytemacrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-6 and IL-10 mRNA were not increased (Table 1a).
Protein measurements using bead-based multiplex immunoassays (BioLegend) for systemic
inflammatory markers matching many of the mRNAs measured (plus IL-1b and IL-12p70) revealed no
significant changes with infection and no significant associations with viral load with one exception. IP-10
protein was increased nearly four fold above measured control values (Table 1b), and the log of concentration
was strongly associated with viral load (OR = 1.09 per unit of log unit of viral N1 mRNA fold-change, CI =
1.06-1.12, p < 0.001).

IFN Responses to Infection
We found five to six-fold increases in expression of both IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2 mRNA among patients with
detection of SARS-CoV-2 (n=20) compared to patients without detection of virus (n=20) (Table 2a, Figure 3a
and 3c). There were no other significant increases in IFN mRNA. The increases in IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2 mRNA
production were strongly associated with viral load (Figure 3e and 3f).
Despite increased mRNA expression for some of the IFNs, protein measurements showed reductions in
IFN-α2, IFN-γ and IFN-λ2,3 in patients with viral infection that averaged 66%, 49% and 40%, respectively,
relative to control patients (Table 2c).

ISG Responses to Infection
We prospectively selected four ISGs to evaluate because of their importance in defense against RNA viruses60:
GTP-binding Myxovirus protein (MX-1),61–65 IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT),66 IFNinduced transmembrane protein (IFITM)66,67 and Tetherin (BST-2).68,69 MX-1 and Tetherin mRNA were both
increased in infected patients with moderate statistical significance while two IFIT mRNAs were greatly and

significantly increased (Table 2d). Focused proteomic examination of proteins extracted from samples using
data independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry detected an association between positive clinical testing
for SARS-CoV-2 and IFIT-1, IFIT-3 and Tetherin proteins with a borderline finding for MX-1 protein (Table
2e). Proteomic examination using data dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry, which has less
sensitivity but better specificity and precision, detected only a large increase in IFIT-3 protein that was
associated with clinical infection detection and increasing viral N1 mRNA (Figure 4). Transcript and proteome
results are based on the same six positive and six negative samples for which we had sufficient mRNA
remaining after other studies.

Model Adjustments with Older Age
The increase in IP-10 mRNA with infection was lower in older individuals (Figure 2i). All other things being
equal, 10 additional years in age were associated with an approximately overall 70% reduction in IP-10 mRNA
compared to controls while 25 additional years in age were associated with an overall 90% reduction, producing
a remarkable counter effect to infection itself.
We found a borderline significant effect for IFN-λ2,3. Patients with older ages have slightly lower IFNλ2,3 per additional year of age with SARS-CoV-2 infection. This small per year effect was associated with a
10% lower IFN-λ2,3 on average for every additional 10 years of age and about 23% lower IFN-λ2,3 for an
additional 25 years of age in addition to the approximately 40% reduction associated with SARS-CoV-2
infection (Table 2c).

Correlations between IFN, Inflammatory and ISG Measurements
We found no strong and significant correlations between any protein and its transcript suggesting widespread
translation blockade or rapid protein degradation with one exception. Both IP-10 mRNA and protein were
directly associated with viral load (N1 protein mRNA), and the correlation between mRNA and protein was
moderate with strong significance, p < 0.001 (Supplementary Table 2b). In contrast, we found strong

correlations within IFN and inflammatory proteins (Supplementary Table 2a) and within IFN gene,
inflammatory signaling gene and ISG transcripts (Supplementary Table 2c). Correlations within IFN types, for
example, among IFN-λ sub types were exceptionally strong which corresponds to the biology of the IFNs.

Sensitivity Testing
We performed sensitivity testing for all significant associations between IFN, inflammatory and ISG
measurements with viral load (N1 protein mRNA) by re-examining the relationships after exclusion of patients
without infection by SARS-CoV-2. In every case, we found similar relationships between each biomarker and
viral load, increasing the confidence in our findings.
Because of the high degree of correlation between some biomarkers (Supplementary Table 2), for
example between IFN-β1 and IFNα2 transcripts (Spearman correlation coefficient = 1.00, p < 0.001), we
examined the effect of adding a second biomarker as an adjustment to the relationship between each significant
biomarker (p < 0.05) with the clinical diagnosis of infection (Tables 1a, 1b, 2a, 2c and 2d) or with viral load
(Tables 2b and individually reported results for ACE2 mRNA, IP-10 mRNA and IP-10 protein). In every case,
we found similar results for the association between the biomarkers reported and infection status or viral load. A
number of the biomarker measurements tested as adjustment variables appeared to have independent significant
effects suggesting that significant and independent multivariable associations exist, however, our study is too
small to report those results with confidence.

Discussion
Our results show large increases in transcription of multiple genes involved in innate immune and inflammatory
responses soon after SARS-CoV-2 infection and the development of viral-like symptoms (Tables 1 and 2 and
Figures 2 and 3). However, there was a broad-based discrepancy in translation response relative to increased
transcription signals similar to the host shut off patterns seen with multiple viruses, including human CoVs such
as SARS-CoV that have been reported by many and reviewed by others,70–74 and that is just beginning to be

described in SARS-CoV-2.75,76 An alternative possibility is that proteins are rapidly degraded after translation,
however, either possibility is detrimental to a fully functional innate immune response.
Among the IFNs that we evaluated, several had large increases in transcription that were also strongly
associated with viral load (Table 2a and 2b), but protein production was either unchanged or decreased when
comparing samples from symptomatic infected patients to uninfected controls (Table 2c). For pro-inflammatory
cytokines, there were similar large increases in transcription (Table 1a) but no change in measured protein
production except for IP-10 alone (Table 1b). Considering that our samples were collected soon after initial
symptoms from ambulatory patients, the protein production result may indicate that IP-10 is among the first
inflammatory proteins to increase early in infection.
The discrepancies between transcription and translation did not fully extend to the ISGs. We selected to
evaluate these molecules because of their importance for anti-viral defense.60–68 Observed enormous increases in
transcription (Table 2d) were accompanied by several large but uncorrelated (Supplemental Table 2) increases
in protein production (Table 2e). Three antiviral ISGs had increased transcription and translation: IFIT-3 most
strongly (Figure 4), IFIT-1 and Tetherin, and there was an additional borderline finding for MX-1 (Table 2e).
In SARS, suppression of anti-viral proteins occurred late in clinical disease,77 however, our results
suggest that with SARS-CoV-2, it occurs near the beginning of symptoms. Host translation suppression in
SARS is associated with spike protein and non-structural protein 1 (NSP1) interactions with eukaryotic
initiation factor-(eIF)-3 which is required for protein translation.72 Two recent publications investigating
mechanisms involving Nsp1 for SARS-CoV-2 showed similar interference with eIF-3.75,76 Our results add to the
in vitro work by demonstrating supportive evidence from early in the clinical course of human infection.
Because viruses depend on host mechanisms for translation of viral proteins that are required for assembly of
new infectious particles, our observation of continuing transcription and suppressed translation of human
proteins may help explain persistent RT-PCR detection of viral RNA but marked decreases in infectious viral
particle production soon after the appearance of symptoms. These tentative hypotheses await further
development and testing.

ACE-2 mRNA was increased among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The finding indicates at least
two possible causal relationships. SARS-CoV-2 may selectively infect people with existing high levels of ACE2 transcription, or infection itself may increase transcription of ACE-2 above normal. In either case, increased
transcription leading to increased protein expression of ACE-2 likely would increase viral entry and thus help
amplify viral replication.
We measured transcripts for three intracellular proteins important in pathways leading to IFN production
and initiation of NFκB-related inflammation. Transcription of TBK-1 and STING-1 were unchanged while there
was a decrease in TRAF-1 mRNA. TRAF-1 is involved in several distinct inflammation-related pathways, but a
reduction is most likely associated with increased NFκB activity and subsequently increased systemic
inflammation.58 The other two proteins, TBK-1 and STING-1, are important for transmitting detection of viral
invasion to processes that produce anti-viral IFNs.41 There was no increase in transcription of STING-1 and
TBK-1, however, IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2 transcripts were markedly elevated (Table 2a and Figure 3). The increases
in these transcripts were closely associated with viral load. These findings suggest that detection of viral
invasion is successful in generating a signal to increase both systemic inflammation and IFN production.
Massive and strongly significant increases in IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2 mRNA (Table 2a) may indicate the critical
importance of Type III IFNs in SARS-CoV-278–80 even if protein production was decoupled from high levels of
gene transcription by the time our samples were collected.
IP-10 was the sole inflammatory cytokine detected with higher protein concentrations in our samples
from infected patients (Table 1b). IP-10 promotes inflammation in Human Immunodeficiency Virus,81 H5N1
Influenza A,82,28 Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome virus83 and SARS-CoV33 infections, thus its prominence
early in SARS-CoV-2 infection, while unsurprising, may be important for understanding evolution of disease
from initial mildly symptomatic to severe and sometimes fatal. Nevertheless, we found a moderately strong
inverse relationship with age such that 10 or 25 additional years of age seemed to be associated with dampening
of increases in IP-10 (see Results). This inverse association is at odds with the clinical observation of worsening
disease severity associated with older ages and generates questions about the nature of previously observed

detrimental effects of IP-1014–17 on morbidity and mortality with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Older individuals with
COVID-19, for example, may be more sensitive to suppression of anti-viral defenses while younger individuals
are more sensitive to excessive inflammation. The observations and questions show that abnormal transcript and
protein responses to infection cannot be fully interpreted without clinical context drawn from evaluation of a
larger study population.
In contrast to limited but interesting results with adjustments for age, adjustments for sex were
uninformative. The lack of significant findings may be due to survivor biases. Ill and severely ill patients are
less likely to be female,15 but the susceptibility to infection associated with sex is unknown. Among patients
who develop symptoms, innate immune responses may be similar regardless of sex.
Our study is limited by its cross-sectional design, small size and the nature of the nasopharyngeal swab
samples. Due to the urgency of need, we obtained deidentified samples quickly in exchange for giving up
detailed clinical annotation. We do not yet have sufficient information to interpret observed abnormalities in
IFN and systemic inflammation to seek out associations with clinical outcomes such as respiratory failure or
death. However, because a random sample of the population visiting our drive-through diagnosis centers will
contain predominantly survivors of infection who never require hospitalization, the measurements we report
should roughly represent patients who generally suffer non-severe disease.
The small size of the study limits our ability to generalize our interpretations and conclusions.
Sensitivity analyses, however, increase our confidence in the stability of our findings and suggest that there are
additional multivariable associations between biomarkers, infection status and viral load that may be explored,
further strengthening the impression that additional study of more individuals is needed to better understand the
extent of innate immune disruptions due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Nasopharyngeal swab samples necessarily retrieve a variety of cell types and may retrieve secreted
substances that originate elsewhere than the upper airway. Because samples were frozen prior to evaluation,
characterization of cell types by cell counting or flow cytometry was not possible. Prospective human study
with immediate processing to allow better assessments of cell types present is possible, but full characterization

of secreted molecules will require carefully designed cell culture models to prevent inclusion of molecules
produced elsewhere and transported to the nasopharynx. Despite the limitations, our study provides information
highlighting several areas of IFN and inflammatory biology that deserve future investigation.
Although our study identifies strong IFN and systemic inflammatory signal transcription responses to
infection, only a larger prospective study incorporating careful annotation of patient characteristics, analysis of
serial samples with disease progression and reporting of outcomes can fully assess the clinical implications of
these initial findings. Our results overall, even with a small study size, emphasize that there are remarkable
disruptions early in disease in the immune landscape. Further study is likely to be both fruitful and illuminating.

Methods
Samples and Study Population
Our project was reviewed at the University of Utah by both the Institutional Review Board and the Biosafety
Committee. An exemption from informed consent was allowed because patient samples were de-identified. All
samples were handled in a biosafety level (BSL) 2 capable hood (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA) using BSL 3 procedures until virus inactivation and were handled with BSL 2 procedures thereafter.
Randomly selected and completely deidentified, residual nasopharyngeal swab samples from patients
presenting for diagnosis of symptoms consistent with COVID-19 during the period of late April through early
June of 2020 were enrolled in the study. Clinical testing involved use of a portion of each sample to test with
automated, FDA Emergency Use Authorized RT-PCR or transcription-mediated amplification tests for
qualitative presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We received sample remainders annotated with age, sex and
qualitative nucleic acid amplification-detection results after being frozen at -80 °C for approximately one
month.

Initial Extraction of Human RNA and Proteins
We extracted RNA using Chemagic reagents and Chemagic MSM I extraction platform (Perkin-Elmer,
Billerica, MA, USA) from part of each sample remainder producing sufficient RNA to allow real-time
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) measurement of reference gene Pol2A (mean CT = 32.22, SD = 4.86). For
all other mRNA measurements, we used the Pol2A CT as the reference point for each individual to calculate fold
change (see Methods for CT definition and usage).
Protease inhibitor cocktail and equal volume of Hank’s Balanced Salt solution (Sigma Aldrich) were
added to the final portion of the thawed patient samples prior to centrifugation (20,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C).
We carefully aspirated the supernatant for Bead Based Multiplex Immunoassays. Pellets from centrifugation
were extracted using All-Prep Micro kits (Qiagen) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions,
producing additional RNA suitable for RT-PCR and a final protein-containing pellet for Mass Spectrometry.

Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction of viral and human mRNA
For most mRNAs, we had sufficient sample to study all 40 patients; for selected mRNAs, we were able to study
6 samples with and 6 samples without SARS-CoV-2 detection. All specific mRNA measurements were based on
RT-PCR employing RNA from a single extraction method to avoid technical sources of noise.
An equal volume of RNA was taken for first strand cDNA reverse transcription (ABI High Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit) and specific amplification in a StepOnePlus (ABI, ThermoFisher Scientific).
Gene specific primers were designed using the Roche Applied Science Universal Probe Library Assay Design
Center. All amplifications were performed using a 2-step amplification protocol with ABI PowerUp SYBR
Green Master Mix as follows: 1 cycle at 50° C for 2 minutes to activate UDG, 1 cycle at 95° C for 2 minutes to
release the DNA polymerase then 40-50 cycles with a 3 second denaturing at 95° C followed by 30 second
annealing and denaturing at 60° C.
A melt curve (dissociation) was performed for every primer to ensure the above amplification conditions
resulted in the amplification of a single peak. All of the designed primers gave a single peak upon dissociation

after amplification suggesting no non-specific binding to other genes. Amplification of genomic DNA was
prevented by using primers that spanned an intron. The IFN-α2 gene and IFITM-1 and IFITM-3 ISGs do not
have introns. The primers did, however, give a single peak upon dissociation. All other primers including IFN-λ
spanned an intron.

Bead Based Multiplex Immunoassays
Cytokine analyses of patient samples were performed using a commercially available enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (LEGENDplex Human Anti-Virus Response Panel 13-Plex with Filter Plate, BioLegend,
San Diego, CA). This bead-based multiplex assay allowed for the simultaneous quantification of interleukins
(IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 [or CXCL8], IL-10, IL-12p70); interferons (IFN-α2, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2,3), TNFα, IP-10, and GM-CSF in patient samples using a flow cytometric approach. All standards and samples were
assayed in duplicate using manufacturer recommended protocols. Incubation steps were conducted at room
temperature with constant agitation (500 rpm), and shielded from exposure to light. Performing the assay in
standard 96-well filter plates facilitated thorough washing of samples and required the use of a MultiScreen
Vacuum Manifold (EMD Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA) alongside a uniform vacuum source. Following
the final wash of combined sample and biotinylated detection antibodies, bound proteins of interest were resuspended in 0.008% final concentration of EM-grade glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield,
PA, USA, Cat #16216) for 48 hours at 4° C to inactivate SARS-CoV-2, adapting a protocol previously
investigated for SARS-CoV.84 Following incubation, samples were washed a final time and transferred to a
polystyrene 96-well plate with a conical bottom. Flow cytometric analysis of cytokines was performed using a
BD FACSCanto II system (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) at the University of Utah Flow Cytometry Core (Salt
Lake City, UT) and analyzed using LEGENDplex software (BioLegend).

Mass Spectrometry
Preparation of proteins prior to mass spectrometry. Proteins were reduced with 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)
at 60° C for 45 minutes, followed by alkylation with 10 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) at room temperature for 30
minutes in the dark. Excess IAA was neutralized by addition of 5 mM DTT. A trypsin/LysC mixture (Promega;
Madison, WI) was added to the proteins in a 1:100 ratio and the proteins were digested overnight at 38° C. The
digestion was quenched by acidification of the solution with the addition of 1% formic acid to a pH of 2-3.
Initially, the pelleted proteins from the COVID-19 patients would not completely dissolve in the 50 mM
ammonium bicarbonate. However, after the trypsin/LysC digestion all of the samples were completely dissolved
in solution. The final concentration of the peptides was determined using a peptide colorimetric assay and the
use of a Nanodrop One (ThermoFisher Scientific) spectrophotometer.
DDA nanoLC-MS/MS. Peptides (1 μg on column) were loaded using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano
system (ThermoFisher Scientific) onto a PharmaFluidics μPAC micro-chip based trapping column and
separated using a 50 cm equivalent PharmaFluidics μPAC micro-chip based column (PharmaFluidics, Ghent,
Belgium). Chromatography was performed using ultrapure water with 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and
acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid (solvent B). Elution was carried out with an initial mobile phase
concentration of 5% for 4 minutes followed by a ramp to 45% over 76 minutes then a second ramp to 95% B in
5 minutes. This was held for 10 minutes followed by ramping down to 5% B over two minutes and reequilibration for 10 minutes. Flow rate was 0.5 mL/min. A QExactive HF (ThermoFisher Scientific) coupled to
a Flex nano spray source was employed with the following settings for MS1; resolution 60, AGC target 3e6,
maximum IT 100 ms, scan range 375-1650 m/z. MS2 settings were; resolution 15,000, AGC target 2e5,
maximum IT 25 ms, isolation window 1.4 m/z. Top 15 DDA analysis was performed with NCE set to 27.
DIA nanoLC-MS/MS. Staggered window DIA analysis was carried out using the methods described by Pino
et. al.85 A peptide centric gas phase retention time library was generated by pooling equal amounts of each
sample and analyzing this using six narrow window DIA experiments with the following settings for MS1:
resolution 60,000, AGC target 1e6, maximum IT 55, with 6 separate analyses in the following mass ranges 39517

505 m/z, 495-605 m/z, 595-705 m/z, 695-805 m/z, 795-905 m/z, and 895-1005 m/z. MS2 analysis used the
following settings: resolution 30,000, AGC target 1e6, loop count 25, default charge 3, NCE 27 with 4 m/z
staggered DIA windows. NanoLC-MS/MS analysis was carried out identically to DDA analysis described
above.
DDA data processing. The Proteome Discover version 2.4 (ThermoFisher Scientific) precursor-based
quantification processing workflow was employed. SequestHT with multiple peptide search and percolator
validation was employed to extract protein data. The following search options were employed, Homo sapiens
fasta file, trypsin digestion, 2 missed cleavages, minimum peptide length 6, precursor mass tolerance 10 ppm,
fragment mass tolerance 0.02 Da, carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a peptide static modification, N-terminal
acetylation, N-terminal Met-loss and methionine oxidation as protein dynamic modifications.
DIA data processing. Thermo .RAW files were demultiplexed and converted to mzML files using
MSConvert.86 The Walnut functionality of EnclopeDIA87 was employed for peptide centric library creation.
Peptides were identified using the same variables as DDA described above. Quantitation was performed using
Skyline.88

Calculations and Statistical Analysis
For all mRNA, we calculated fold-change for each sample (FCsample) after measuring the fractional number of
polymerase chain reaction doubling cycles required so that SYBR Green fluorescence exceeded the threshold
for detection (CT). We used the following formula:

FCsample=2−( ΔC

T

sample− ΔC T median)

,

where ΔCTsample was the number of doubling cycles to detect each mRNA minus the number of doubling
cycles to detect mRNA from the Pol2A reference gene for each sample, and the ΔCTmedian was the median
ΔCTsample for samples without detection of SARS-CoV-2. The incorporation of CT for Pol2A mRNA in the

calculation indexes the measurement so that samples with different efficiencies of recovery of mRNA
containing cells between testing individuals are standardized.
For IFIT-3 fold change values from DDA mass spectrometry, FCsample was calculated:
FCsample=

AUC IFIT 3
,
median( AUC virus negative IFIT 3 )

where AUCIFIT3 is the area under the curve (AUC) for peptides identified as part of IFIT-3, and median(AUCvirus
negative IFIT3

) is the median AUC for IFIT-3 from samples without detection of SARS-CoV-2. The other pre-

specified ISG proteins were undetectable by DDA mass spectrometry, and thus no fold-change calculation was
possible.
We calculated summary statistics. We examined associations between different biomarker measurements
by calculating Spearman’s rank correlation statistic to better understand potential dependencies. We used log
transformations of all mRNA and protein measurements in our statistical calculations because of the log-normal
nature of our results. Others using the methods that we employed, however, often report results using either
natural or base 2 logs. Because the bulk of our results are commonly reported using natural log values, we
standardized on those for reporting. The effect is to slightly change results normally reported using base 2 logs
by a proportion equal to natural log of 2 (or 0.698). This usage has no effect on interpretations of results.
Using SARS-CoV-2 infection status as the independent variable, we performed linear regression with
natural log(FC) of each pre-specified mRNA or natural log(FCIFIT3) as the dependent variable because we seek
to understand the biological effects of infection. Each univariable model was adjusted with age and sex with
backward selection to understand the impacts on model fits. We performed univariable linear regression with
natural log(FC) or natural log(protein concentration [pg/ml]) as the dependent variables and natural log(FCviral N1
) as the independent variable to understand associations with viral load, adjusting with age and sex as

protein mRNA

above.
We performed sensitivity analyses of significant associations reported in Tables 1 and 2. For each
dependent biomarker with significant associations with infection status or viral load, we selected all other

biomarkers reported to have significant correlations in Supplementary Table 2 as additional adjustment
variables. Using these adjustment biomarkers one at a time, we assessed the impact on the estimates for
infection status and viral load for each significant association reported in Tables 1 and 2.
We assigned 50 as the CT value for undetectable mRNA. For undetectable proteins by bead based
multiplex immunoassay, we assigned the minimum detection value. These assignments enable quantitative
analysis without treating the values as missing. Results were similar when analysis was restricted to raw data
derived from the 6 infected and 6 uninfected samples with the highest recovery of RNA. All calculations and
statistical modeling were performed using the R statistical system.89

Figure Legends
Figure 1. Association of ACE2 but not TMPRSS2 Expression with SARS-CoV-2 Infection. a. ACE-2
mRNA is increased approximately three-fold in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection over ACE-2 mRNA
expression in patients without infection, and b. the increase in expression is associated with viral load (OR =
1.16, CI = 1.1-1.23, p < 0.001). However, the expression of TMPRSS-2 is c. neither increased nor decreased
with infection and d. is not associated with viral load. Adjustments for age and sex were not significant for
either molecule. In each panel, a and c, there are six infected and six non-infected status patients.

Figure 2. Transcripts for Genes Associated with Inflammation. Transcription of a. IL-8, b. IP-10, c. TNF-α
mRNA are all increase approximately 6-fold while transcription of d. TRAF-1 is reduced. When assessed for
relationship with viral load, decreasing e. TRAF-1 mRNA is associated with increasing viral N1 protein mRNA
while increasing mRNA for f. IL-8, g. TNF-α (less strongly) and h. IP-10 are associated with increasing viral
N1 protein mRNA. In contrast, decreasing i. IP-10 mRNA is associated with increasing age. Similar
relationships are seen with viral E1 protein transcripts (not shown). In each panel, a-c, there are 20 infected and
20 non-infected status patients. In panel d, there are 6 infected and 6 non-infected.

Figure 3. Transcripts for Genes Associated with Interferons. Transcription of a. IFN-λ1 is increased nearly
6-fold although b. IFN-λ1 protein is unchanged with infection. Transcription of c. IFN-λ2 is increased about 3fold but d. IFN-λ2 protein is decreased even if the combined measurement of IFN-λ2 and IFN-λ3 proteins are
attributed solely to IFN-λ2. The mRNA fold changes for e. IFN-λ1 and f. IFN-λ2 are directly associated with
increasing viral N1 protein mRNA. For g. IFN-λ1 protein there is no association with viral N1 protein mRNA,
but for h. combined IFN-λ2 and IFN-λ3 protein measurement, there is an inverse relationship with viral N1
protein mRNA. For e.-h., substitution of viral E1 mRNA produced similar relationships and figures. In each
panel, a-d, there are 20 infected and 20 non-infected status patients.

Figure 4. Transcripts for Pre-selected ISGs. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with increased a. MX1, b. IFIT-1, c. IFIT-3 and d. Tetherin (BST-2) mRNAs. There were significant associations between increasing
e. IFIT-3 mRNA and f. IFIT-3 protein fold changes and increasing viral N1 protein mRNA. Protein fold-change
for IFIT-3 were measured using DDA mass spectrometry. Similar relationships were seen using viral E1 protein
mRNA as in e. and f. In each panel, a-d, there are six infected and six non-infected status patients.
