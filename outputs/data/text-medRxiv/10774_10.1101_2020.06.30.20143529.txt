ABSTRACT
Background: Infection with SARS-CoV-2, associated with severe respiratory symptoms,
currently called COVID-19, represents one of the greatest health challenges of this century.
Health professionals, as well as hospital workers, are the most vulnerable population for
acquiring SARS-CoV-2 due to their greater proximity to sick patients, especially in specialized
hospitals for the treatment of these patients.

Study Design: We ran a questionnaire by all the employees of a Public Service Hospital
specialised in COVID-19 treatment (1307 employees), in the municipality of Santos, São
Paulo, Brazil, who presented some symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and positive
results by RT-PCR, in Oropharynx Swab collection. The questionnaire collected sociodemographic information, as well as data related to the work areas where they were
divided into two groups: Employees at higher risk or those who directly deal with patients
(914 employees or 69.9%) and lower risk for employees in the administrative area (393
employees or 30.1%).
Results: 211 (16.1%) of the Hospital's employees had to stop their work-related activities
due to presenting positive RT-PCR. There were 39 (9.9%) positives in low risk areas and
172 (18.8%) positives in employees in high risk areas. Within the latter group, Nurses,
Nursing Assistants and Doctors were the most frequently infected professionals.
Regarding the symptoms of professionals positively diagnosed based on RT-PCR, the
most frequent symptoms were body pain (83.4%); headache (80.6%); fever (57.8%) and
dry cough (53.1%).
Conclusion: A high proportion of workers in COVID-19 specialized hospitals was
infected by the virus, despite all the protective measures adopted, showing the high

transmission capacity of this virus. Stricter individual protection measures among
employees must be adopted.

1.Introduction
The first reports from the virus started with the identification of patients with an atypical
respiratory syndrome in Wuhan, in the Chinese province of Hubei, in early December
(Yan et al. 2020; Shi et al. 2020). On December 27th, 2019, the Chinese Disease Control
Center (CDC) notified atypical pneumonia cases with unusual evolution and a few days
later, on December 31st, Wuhan's epidemiological surveillance issued an alert to the
Chinese CDC , which promptly started investigating the cases, their etiology and their
probable origin. A day later, on January 1st, 2020, CDC investigators related the cases to
the Huanan fish market, which was promptly closed (Zhou et al. 2020); the causative
agent of the disease was identified and initially called the new Coronavirus - (nCoV2019), being later renamed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2, (SARSCoV-2) and the disease later named - Coronavirus 2019 Disease (COVID-19) (Zhu et al.
2020), see figure 1.

Figure 1. Timeline with the most relevant facts associated with the emergence of Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome by Coronavirus 2, (SARS-CoV2 / COVD-19)
The current number of people infected confirmed in the world as of 06 June 2020 is
7,936,874 and 433,959 deaths. In Brazil, there are 867,624 cases and 43,332 reported
deaths. The municipality of Santos is located in the coastal region of the State of São
Paulo. It is the locus of the largest port in Latin America and it has a current population
of 443,000 inhabitants. In the municipality of Santos, the first reported case was described
retrospectively dating back to 05 Feb 2020; and currently the number of confirmed
patients is 6354 and 222 deaths.
2. Aims
To determine the prevalence of positive RT-PCR-SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare
workers at Hospital Guilherme Álvaro, Santos, SP / Brazil and their sociodemographic
and clinical characteristics.

3. Study Design
We analyzed all employees of Hospital Guilherme Álvaro who were removed from their
work activities from February to June 2020, as a result of being diagnosed with COVID19, using an Oropharynx Swab. They were stratified according to sociodemographic
characteristics, reported symptoms, work areas, second or minor contact with patients
(Assistance Area and Administrative Area / Service) and type of healthcare professional.
RT-PCR tests were performed using the Charité protocol (Corman et al. 2020); based on
reverse transcription followed by real-time Polymerase chain reaction of the three
Coronavirus -SARS-CoV-2 genes (Gene E, RdRP and N). All data were collected through
a semi-structured questionnaire and sent out via Google Forms® platform. The data was
initially condensed in an Excel-Microsoft® spreadsheet, and later analyzed by the SPSSIBM® statistical package - version 25, 2017.
The data was presented in tables, including absolute numbers and relative proportions for
the different variables, using Fisher's ex(Corman et al. 2020)act test. This study was
submitted to the Ethics and Research Committee of Hospital Guilherme Álvaro, and
approved under protocol number 4.045.803.
4. Results
From a total of 1307 healthcare workers in the different areas of the hospital, 211 (16.1%)
of hospital employees had to remain on leave for at least 14 days due to the diagnosis of
COVID-19, graph 1.

Discussion
This study represents the first step in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in
determining the prevalence of Hospital employees in different areas of work. 211 of 1307
(16.1%) employees were removed from their usual activities, due to the presence of
symptoms and positive diagnosis based on oropharynx swab for RT-PCR detection. The
prevalence of infection among workers in the high-risk clinical care area was 18.8%
(172/393) and in the administrative and services area, where there is less contact with
patients, therefore were considered low risk, we found 9.9% (39/393); with an OR of 2.1
(1.4 - 3.0 - 95% CI) for individuals in the high risk area compared to the low risk. Other
studies using similar methodology, carried out through the collection of RT-PCR, showed
an infection rate close to ours. In the United Kingdom, among 1533 symptomatic
healthcare workers studied in a tertiary hospital 282 (18%) tested positive (Keeley et al.
2020); these authors also concluded that early identification in symptomatic patients is of
fundamental importance to avoid the transmission of the disease.
Results of studies using antibody tests through serology have shown inferior results
among these same professionals; Korth in Germany in a study among healthcare

professionals found a 1.6% prevalence among 316 workers, and after stratifying the cases
by areas of high risk, thes prevalence rose to 5.4% (Korth et al. 2020); in Santa Clara,
USA, a study with approximately 3,500 healthcare workers, the prevalence was 1.5%
(Zwald et al. 2020). There was no statistically significant difference in positive diagnosis
in relation to gender, however, there was a statistically significant difference between
workers aged 60 years or less (table 3); this certainly reflects the hospital's policy of
removing the most vulnerable professionals from the areas at greatest risk (Giannis et al.
2020).When comparing the characteristics of individuals who had a positive Swab RTPCR test, in relation to the health professional's role according to their workplace, a higher
OR was observed in workers from higher risk areas (table 3); thus the odds ratio was
larger than one for healthcare professionals with greater contact with patients, such as a
nursing technician - OR-3,4; nursing assistant - OR = 2.9; nurses - OR-2.5;
physiotherapists - OR-2,4 and clinicians - OR-1,7; all statistically significant. Among
health professionals with positive diagnoses who were promptly removed from their work
activities at the hospital, we investigated the main symptoms reported, and what draws
attention is the fact that, even though most studies show the occurrence of fever and cough
as predominant symptoms (Guan et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2020; Lescure et al. 2020), in
symptomatic patients in the present study, the predominant symptom was muscle pain
followed by headache (table 4); fever was only the third symptom reported in 57.8% of
patients, showing to some extent the uselessness of temperature measurement in many
locations as a measure of early detection of patients with COVID-19. In our view,
symptoms such as muscle pain and headache, even if isolated, should raise the suspicion
of infection, at least in this pandemic period. In addition, asymptomatic infections were
observed in other studies in up to 50% of cases (Day 2020; Mizumoto et al. 2020; Shim
et al. 2020), with the transmissibility period occurring even before the onset of symptoms
(He et al. 2020). Therefore, we have reviewed the measures of patient evaluation as
possible symptoms that could lead to sick leave.
In conclusion, the prevalence of COVID-19 among healthcare professionals in a tertiary
hospital in the municipality of Santos, SP, Brazil was 16.1%. Despite the implementation
of training for all health professionals regarding measures and adequate handling of
personal protective equipment, continued training measures for healthcare professionals
in areas of treatment of patients with COVID-19 must be adopted, as well as removal of
the most vulnerable professionals from the areas of greatest risk. The next stage of this
study will be carrying out serology in all professionals employed by the hospital, with a
follow-up study of seroconversion among the negative and a drop in antibody titers
among the positive, every three months for 2 years.
