Objectives: To assess the apprehensions amongst HCWs about COVID-19 and to
document accessibility, adherence and side effects related to HCQ prophylaxis in HCWs.
Methods: A longitudinal follow up study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital. HCQ
was given in the dose of 400 mg twice on day one, and then 400 mg weekly for seven
weeks. 391 HCWs were interviewed using semi structured questionnaire.
Results: 62.2% HCWs expressed perceived danger posted by COVID-19 infection.
Doctors (54%) showed least acceptance and paramedics (88%) showed highest
acceptance to chemoprophylaxis. 17.5% participants developed at least one of the side
effects to HCQ. Females and nursing profession were significantly associated with adverse
effects. Common side effects were gastro-intestinal symptoms, headache and abnormal
mood change. Most of these were mild, not requiring any intervention. Gender, professions
and perceived threat of COVID-19 were significantly associated with acceptance and
adherence to HCQ prophylaxis.
Conclusion: Two third of HCWs had perceived danger due to COVID-19. Three fourth of
the HCWs accepted chemoprophylaxis and four out of five who accepted had complete
adherence to prophylaxis schedule. One out of five had developed at least one of side
effects; however, most of these were mild not requiring any intervention.

Introduction
The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is called COVID-19. It was first described in Wuhan
province of China in December 2019,1,2 and since then it is spreading rapidly. Scientists
are searching for specific anti-viral drug or vaccine against this disease.3 However there
are conflicting results that a few drugs are showing promising results.4,5 Health care
workers exposed to confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 are at high risk of getting
infected with COVID-19.6 In view of this, National task force for COVID-19 constituted by
Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) under Government of India (GOI) has
recommended hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for adults in a dosage of 400 mg twice a day on
first day followed by 400 mg once a week for 7 weeks for chemoprophylaxis for COVID-19
for all health care workers (HCWs) involved in the care of suspected or confirmed cases of
COVID-19, and also for household contacts of laboratory confirmed cases.7
There are apprehensions amongst healthcare workers (HCWs) about COVID-19 as well as
about taking HCQ8–11 as chemoprophylaxis because of possible side effects.12-17 There is
currently limited experience related to administration of HCQ as chemoprophylaxis for
COVID-19 as the general guidance is based on a small sample of data. This limitation may
translate into its low acceptability in HCWs. There are a few clinical trials presently going
on in the context of chemoprophylaxis with HCQ in COVID-19.13 Also, there have been a
few reports of severe side-effects to HCQ in medical journals.12-17 These reports may lead
to apprehensions in the target population while scaling up this chemoprophylaxis. Hence, it
is felt that a study should explore and document experiences in large scale administration
of HCQ chemoprophylaxis for COVID-19 in HCWs and also their attitude and confidence
level before and after taking chemoprophylaxis. The well documented side effects of HCQ

include gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, vomiting, gastritis, diarrhoea, allergic
reactions like itching/rashes, eye problems like loss or decrease in accommodation,
burning sensation, abnormal mood changes, giddiness and change in cardiac rhythm.12-17
However, adverse effects of HCQ during its application chemoprophylaxis for COVID-19 in
the recommended dosages should also be explored. This study was conceived when HCQ
chemoprophylaxis administration was initiated for being given to HCWs of our hospital for
COVID-19 in response to Indian Council of Medical Research, Government of India
guidance on the same.7
Materials and Methods
Study Design and setting:
A longitudinal follow up study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in Delhi. The
hospital is a teaching institute with 400 beds, and is providing outpatient care for an
average 200 patients a day. The hospital has a total of 689 employees which includes
doctors, nurses, paramedic staffs and other supporting staffs.
Study Procedure:
Following the guidance issued by Government of India, recommending the use of HCQ for
prophylaxis of COVID-19, HCQ chemoprophylaxis has been offered to all the healthcare
staffs of the institute since 28th March 2020. As a part of capacity building they were made
aware on various aspects of HCQ prophylaxis, such as, available evidence, rationale, its
side effects and asked to report if they developed any symptom for prompt management of
the same. Subsequently, the current study was undertaken to assess different modalities
associated with administration of this intervention. All the HCWs were invited to participate

in the study, and consent was obtained from all of them who were willing to participate. A
trained team of HCWs interviewed the participants with semi structured questionnaire,
which included details about socio-demographic details, co-morbidities, perceived threat
from COVID-19, source of knowledge regarding HCQ prophylaxis. All participants were
followed up to assess the development of side effects (self-reported) and adherence to
prophylaxis. All participants who developed the side effects were referred to physician for
confirmation and further management of side effects. The data were captured using digital
data entry form.
Statistical methods:
Data were extracted in Microsoft Excel and analysed in Statistical Package for Social
Science version 22. Continuous variables were expressed with mean with standard
deviation (SD). Categorical variables were expressed with proportions. Proportion of
HCWs accepted prophylaxis, proportion with poor adherence, and who developed side
effects were expressed as percentages with 95% Confidence interval (95% CI). Chi square
test was used to test the statistical significance. p value less than 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Ethical Approval:
This study protocol was approved by the institutional ethics committee.

Results
Overall 391 health care workers with mean age of 34±8 years were included in the study.
Around 229 (59%) of the participants were males and 147 (38%) were working as nurse.

Around 86 (22%) were very scared, 84 (21%) were minimally scared and 99 (26%) did not
express any opinion on perceived danger that was posed by COVID 19. Details on
characteristics of study participants are given in table 1.
In total, 297 (75.9%, 95% CI 71.7% - 80.2%) of study participants opted for
hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis, among them 254 (85.5%, 95% CI 81.5% - 89.5%) had
taken doses as per schedule. The acceptance of hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis was high
among males (80%) and also among participants aged less than 30 years (78%) which
gradually decreases as age increase, but it was not statistically significant. Among different
professions, doctors (54%) showed least acceptance to HCQ prophylaxis and paramedics
(88%) showed the highest acceptance and it was statistically significant (p value <0.0001).
Details on factors associated with acceptance of hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis are given
in table 2. Gender (p value 0.012), profession of study participants (0.003) and perceived
danger due to COVID 19 (<0.0001) were significantly associated with compliance to
prophylaxis (table 2). Reasons given for not taking prophylaxis are shown in table 3.
Among the participants not accepted the prophylaxis, 22 (23.4%) did so for fear of side
effects, 12 (12.8%) were taking other medications and 10 (10.6%) felt that there is no clear
evidence supporting the efficacy of prophylaxis in preventing COVID 19. Among study
participants who missed the dose or discontinued the prophylaxis, 6 (23%) forgot to take
medication, 4 (15%) discontinued after developing adverse effects and 4 (8%) felt there is
no clear evidence supporting the efficacy of prophylaxis in preventing COVID 19. Details
on reasons for poor compliance to prophylaxis are given in table 3a.
Among the 297 participants taking hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis, 52 (17.5%, 95% CI
13.2% - 21.8%) developed adverse effects due to hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis. Of the

297 participants taking HCQ prophylaxis, 29 (9.8%) reported gastrointestinal adverse
effects, 12 (4%) reported mild allergic reactions, 11 (3.7%) developed head ache and 9
(3%) participants reported abnormal mood change. Other side effects reported by study
participants are shown in table 4. Females and nursing profession were significantly
associated with adverse effects due to prophylaxis (table 5).

Discussion
The present study was aimed to assess the acceptance, adherence and adverse effects
related to HCQ chemoprophylaxis to prevent COVID-19 among health care workers. The
present study is the first one to study the acceptance and adherence of HCQ prophylaxis
for COVID-19. The study found that around 76% of the HCWs had accepted the
prophylaxis and taken HCQ at least once as a part of prophylaxis. The finding is
comparable with findings of the studies conducted among travellers to assess the
acceptance to chloroquine/ mefloquine prophylaxis for malaria, which shows 52% to 89%
acceptance rate.18-21 However, as the present study was conducted among health workers,
we could expect a higher acceptance among our study population. As expressed by study
participants, common reasons for not taking prophylaxis were fear of side effects, already
on other medication and no existing clear evidence on effectiveness of chemoprophylaxis
to prevent COVID-19.22-30 In particular fear of side effects could be attributed to several
reports of side effects. These kinds of advices were not issued by reputed health
organisations when chloroquine was considered as prophylaxis for malaria. Also, there is
no clear evidence of effectiveness of prophylaxis against COVID-19 as it is against
malaria. HCWs are well aware of these factors which lead to relatively lesser acceptance

of prophylaxis. These findings further justified by significantly lower acceptance among
doctors followed by nurse and higher acceptance among other supporting staff. Doctors
were high likely to have knowledge on effectiveness and safety of prophylaxis. In the
current era of evidence based medical practice, they are likely to reject prophylaxis due to
even negligible uncertainty. Study also shows that the perceived threat due to COVID-19 is
very less among doctors compared to other professions (details provided in supplementary
table 1) and this may hamper the motivation to take chemoprophylaxis.
Among participants who had accepted the prophylaxis, 85% had shown complete
adherence. Females found to have poor adherence compared to males and it is similar to
findings reported in systematic review conducted by Ahluwalia et al to assess the factors
affecting adherence of chloroquine chemoprophylaxis against malaria.18 The study also
reported that as the severity of perceived threat due to COVID-19 increases, adherence
level also increase. This may be due to effect of perceived threat on motivation to adhere
to prophylaxis. Fear of getting infected by SARS-CoV-2, could have motivated them to
strictly adhere to the prophylaxis. Study participants in nursing category had poor
adherence, which may be due side effects (relatively higher proportion of nursing officers
reported side effects, compared to others). Common reasons given for poor adherence to
prophylaxis were forgetting to take drug and development of side effects and these
findings were similar to the literature.18 Fear of side effects, no clear evidence and no clear
knowledge about schedule of prophylaxis were other reasons for poor adherence. These
findings suggest the need for awareness activities on safety, effectiveness and schedule of
prophylaxis.

The study also found that around 18% of the study participants developed adverse effects
related to prophylaxis. Common adverse effects were gastro intestinal related followed by
allergic reactions and headache. Carme B et al reported that around 12% of people who
had taken chloroquine prophylaxis to prevent malaria, had developed adverse effects
which is comparable to our findings.30 Literature also shows that gastrointestinal adverse
effects and head ache are the common adverse reactions of HCQ, which is similar to our
study.12-14,30
Overall our study found that there is moderately good acceptance for the prophylaxis with
good adherence. However still significant number of study participants had expressed fear
of side effects and lack of clear evidence on effectiveness of prophylaxis, which should be
addressed while giving mass advice. Also clear instructions need to be given to the people
about when to stop prophylaxis if they develop adverse effects.
Strength of the present study are: 1) interview was conducted by trained HCWs in
research, and data were entered in digital data entry form which would have minimised the
error while collecting the data, and 2) all study participants were closely followed up
regularly to assess development of any side effects by research team. The study has a few
limitations like, 1) participation was entirely voluntary basis which may lead to selection
bias, and 2) adherence to chemoprophylaxis was self-reported which may be slightly
higher than actual adherence.
Conclusion
Three fourth of the health care workers accepted chemoprophylaxis to prevent COVID 19
and four out of five accepted chemoprophylaxis had complete adherence to prophylaxis

schedule. Gender, profession and perceived threats were significantly associated with
acceptance and adherence. One out of five had developed at least one of the side effects
with higher rate among females. However, side-effects were largely mild in nature, with
less than 2% of the participants requiring to discontinue HCQ prophylaxis due to side
effects.
