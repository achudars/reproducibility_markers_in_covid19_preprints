INTRODUCTION
An already strained US critical care system was overwhelmed during the
peak of the pandemic, as anticipated by experts based on experience
from China and Italy(1). Initial reports from China suggested that
approximately

5%

of

proven

COVID-19

infections

required

intensive

care(2); however, in the United States, as per the CDC report in March
2020, the hospitalization rate was 20.7-31.4% with 4.9-11.5% requiring
intensive care(3,4). As New York City became the epicenter of the
COVID-19

pandemic

in

March

2020,

all

hospitals

faced

unprecedented stresses to ramp up capacity. With the surge of positive

and

Hospitals (NYC H+H) system is the largest provider of health services
to the low-income and minority populations in the city. With these
communities being disproportionately affected by the pandemic, the NYC
H+H

faced

a

unique

challenge.

The

rapidly

evolving

clinical,

operational needs across the eleven-hospital system were recognized,
and

efforts

to

capacity

and

resources

were

implemented.

Critical care capacity was expanded system wide, with an increase from
300 bed ICU capacity at baseline to over 1000 beds. This was possible

The

placed

a

also

significant strain on staffing, especially ICU staffing across H+H. In
addition to the redeployment of staff from suspended services like
ambulatory care, a tiered staffing structure using intensivists and
ICU nurses guided the non-ICU trained providers and increased ability
to provide high-quality critical care. The system partnered with the
US Department of Defense and engaged volunteers and private staffing
agencies

to

help

meet

the

While traditional ICUs managed by intensivists have been well known to

we

examined

the

of

clinical

features and outcomes of severe/critical COVID-19 patients requiring
intensive care admitted to the traditional and “Flex” ICUs during the

RESULTS
Of the 1074 patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection
between March 1ST-May 1st, 394 patients required invasive mechanical
ventilation. Our study included 312 patients with positive SARS-CoV2
PCR who required mechanical ventilation (Figure 1), of which 111 (36
%) were admitted to the Traditional Intensive Care Unit and 201 (64%)
to “FLEX” intensive units (figure 1).

DISCUSSION
It is well established that critically ill patients have decreased
mortality and length of stay when managed by trained intensivists(14–
16). Due to the unprecedented demand for critical care services at the
peak of the pandemic, hospitalists and surgeons stepped up to provide
intensive care in the designated “Flex” ICUs. Our study presents the
comparison of patient outcomes between a traditional ICU and Flex ICU.
While both groups were comparable, it was not surprising that the
survival outcomes were better in the traditional ICUs with shorter
lengths of stay. Notably, the Flex ICUs managed a higher proportion of
patients older than 80 years and those admitted with critical COVID-19
infection

between the two groups were comparable, the Flex ICUS managed more CKD
patients than the traditional ICUs. While unadjusted outcomes in the
traditional ICUs were significantly better than the Flex units, the
risk was reduced to become almost comparable on the adjustment model.

NYC’s public health system, NYC Health +Hospital, expanded capacity
across its eleven acute care facilities and added three new field
hospitals in response to the surge of COVID-19 infection in the city.
As per the direction of the senior administration of the system, all
of the system hospitals with their 4000 total beds joined and prepared
to become a single large intensive care unit(5,17). As part of this
response our hospital, increased capacity from a 34 bed ICU capacity
to 195 beds by innovatively repurposing nontraditional hospital space
and equipment with staff support from the US Department of Defense,
private staffing agencies, and volunteer medical staff from all over
the

country.

The differences in mortality could thus be explained by a multitude of
system and patient-related factors.
The rapid influx of patients with different stages of severity of the
disease, evolving knowledge, and evidence-based clinical therapeutics,
the challenge of reducing transmission of this infection over time,
plus an unequal distribution of the human resource and supply chain
played an essential role in outcomes.
