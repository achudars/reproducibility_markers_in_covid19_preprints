ABSTRACT
As essential personnel, United States farmworkers have continued working in-person throughout
the COVID-19 pandemic. We undertook prospective surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection and
antibody prevalence among farmworkers in California’s Salinas Valley from 15 June to 30
November, 2020. Over this period, we observed 22.1% (1514/6864) positivity for current SARSCoV-2 by nucleic acid detection among farmworkers tested at federally-qualified migrant and
community health clinics, as compared to 17.2% (1255/7305) among other adults from the same
communities (risk ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-1.37). In a nested study enrolling
1,115 farmworkers, prevalence of current infection was 27.7% among farmworkers reporting ≥1
potential COVID-19 symptom, and 7.2% among farmworkers without symptoms (adjusted odds
ratio 4.17; 2.86-6.09). Prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies increased from 10.5%
(6.0-18.4%) between 16 July-31 August to 21.2% (16.6-27.4%) between 1-30 November. The
high observed prevalence of infection among farmworkers underscores the need for vaccination
and other preventive interventions.

INTRODUCTION
In response to the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the United
States and other countries have implemented broad interventions aiming to mitigate community
transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1). Workers in
food production and other industries deemed essential to continuity of public health and safety
have continued in-person work (2). While COVID-19 outbreaks have been reported among
various essential workforce groups, including employees in food processing facilities (3, 4), to
date no studies have prospectively assessed risk of infection among essential workers involved in
food production.
Agriculture and related food production industries comprise one of the lowest-paid
sectors of the US economy, with 29% of full-time workers earning an annual income below
$12,760 as individuals or $26,200 for a family of four (5). Agriculture in particular draws on a
predominantly Latino immigrant workforce (6), who in comparison to their US-born
counterparts work longer hours, receive lower wages, and experience higher levels of household
poverty (7). An estimated 54% of immigrant farmworkers are undocumented, and thus have
reduced access to federal benefits under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act
(8). These circumstances have compounded pre-existing legal and economic challenges faced by
farmworkers during the COVID-19 pandemic (9, 10).
We initiated surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection among farmworkers in California’s
Salinas Valley to monitor the epidemic. We have previously described impacts of the pandemic
on economic well-being, mental health, and food insecurity within this population (11). Here we
report on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals tested in farmworker-

serving clinics from June to November, 2020, as well as symptoms and antibody responses
within a subset of these farmworkers enrolled in a cross-sectional study.

METHODS

Study setting
The Salinas Valley is a 90-mile stretch of agricultural land within Monterey County,
California; prominent farmed crops include leafy greens, berries, broccoli, artichokes, and wine
grapes. The agricultural workforce comprises ~50,000 resident farmworkers, with an additional
40,000 seasonal workers supporting the peak summer and fall seasons (12). The population is
75% Latino, and 30-60% of workers are believed to be undocumented (13). Severe
overcrowding and household disrepair are common among farmworkers (14), with many living
in multi-generational households (15) as well as labor camps, vehicles, and informal dwellings
(16). Many farmworkers travel long distances to work, often in shared trucks or buses, and may
work in close proximity to one another. These circumstances have led to concern about difficulty
preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission among farmworkers and in their communities (17).
We undertook this study in partnership with Clínica de Salud del Valle de Salinas
(CSVS), a federally-qualified community and migrant health center in Monterey County. As the
main healthcare provider for the region’s farmworkers and their families, CSVS operates a
network of 12 comprehensive primary care centers serving 52,000 low-income, primarily
Spanish-speaking patients.

SARS-CoV-2 testing

Testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection at CSVS clinics began 15 June, 2020, and was offered
to all individuals at clinics during weekday business hours. Medical personnel collected
oropharyngeal specimens for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via the qualitative Hologic
(Marlborough, Massachusetts) Aptima nucleic acid transcription-mediated amplification (TMA)
assay. All patients receiving care from CSVS for any reason were encouraged by their healthcare
providers to receive SARS-CoV-2 testing, regardless of symptoms; testing was also made
available to individuals who were not CSVS patients. No-cost testing for individuals without
insurance was supported by funding from the Health Resources and Services Administration.
Additionally, CSVS conducted outreach testing via mobile testing facilities at community sites
including low-income and employer-provided housing, agricultural fields, homeless shelters,
food banks, and CSVS-run health fairs where free SARS-CoV-2 testing was offered alongside
seasonal influenza vaccination and food donations.

Clinical surveillance study
We sought to compare the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 TMA tests yielding positive
results among farmworkers against that among other adults tested by CSVS. As part of routine
clinical intake, all patients ages ≥18 years were asked about employment. We considered
farmworkers to include all persons engaged in work in agriculture, including but not limited to
crop, nursery, and greenhouse laborers; agricultural equipment operators; workers in packing
sheds and other food processing facilities; and farm and ranch animal workers and breeders.

Cross-sectional study

Enrollment: To better understand the distribution, dynamics, and clinical profile of infection in
this population, we invited farmworkers who were receiving a SARS-CoV-2 TMA test at CSVS
to participate in a more in-depth cross-sectional study further entailing anti-SARS-CoV-2
antibody testing and a detailed questionnaire. To advertise the study, fliers were distributed in the
community and to area growers and were hung in clinics describing the opportunity to receive
free SARS-CoV-2 testing from CSVS and participate in the study. The study team was stationed
at CSVS testing facilities and aimed to approach all patients receiving SARS-CoV-2 TMA tests
to screen for study eligibility and invite participation in the cross-sectional study. When time
allowed, study personnel called patients with scheduled SARS-CoV-2 testing appointments at
CSVS on the day before their visit to advertise the study and screen for eligibility. Participants in
an ongoing longitudinal study of farmworker families (13) and those living in housing for
farmworkers were also invited to participate and to bring other farmworkers.
Eligible participants were non-pregnant adult farmworkers ages ≥18 years receiving
SARS-CoV-2 TMA testing at CSVS who had conducted farm work ≤14 days before their testing
date, who had not previously participated, and who spoke sufficient English or Spanish to give
consent and complete study procedures. To accommodate the end of the growing season, from 5
October onward we enrolled individuals who had engaged in farm work any time since March
2020.
Study procedures: The study team obtained a blood sample by venipuncture and measured
participants’ height and weight using large-print tape measures adhered to a post or wall and
digital scales. Within 48 hours before (for pre-consented participants) or after the enrollment
visit, and before SARS-CoV-2 testing results were available, the study team administered a 45minute computer-guided questionnaire by telephone in Spanish or English. Questionnaire items

addressed participant demographics, socio-economic status, symptoms since December 2019 and
in the two weeks preceding enrollment, COVID-19 risk factors and exposures, and impacts of
the pandemic on daily life and wellbeing (11). Following completion of all components of the
study, the study team loaded a $50 incentive onto VISA gift cards handed out to participants at
the enrollment visit.
Blood specimens were stored immediately at 4-7ºC and centrifuged ≤48 hours after
collection. Following separation, plasma aliquots were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes
and stored at –80ºC, then used for assessment of immunoglobulin G (IgG) reactivity against the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein via in-house enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) (18).
Briefly, recombinant full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (John Pak, Chan Zuckerberg
Biohub) was coated on Nunc Maxisorp ELISA plates (Themofisher) at 1.5µg/mL. Plates were
blocked with 2.5% non-fat dry milk in 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 2 hours at 37°C.
Plates were then washed 3 times in 1X PBS. Plasma samples, diluted 1:100 in 1% non-fat dry
milk in 1X PBS, were added to the plate in duplicate wells. After a 1-hour incubation at 37°C,
plates were washed 5 times in 1X PBS + 0.05% Tween-20. Bound anti-spike IgG was detected
using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-human IgG antibody (Fisher Scientific). The
plate was developed using a 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution, and the reaction
was stopped with 2M H2SO4 after 6 minutes. Prior assay validation was performed using
convalescent (≥8 days post-onset) serum samples from 60 hospitalized, PCR-confirmed COVID19 cases; 57 mild or subclinical PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases; and 131 unexposed
individuals (pre-2020 serum samples). Specimens were considered to be positive for anti-SARSCoV-2 spike IgG if the ELISA optical density (OD) value was >0.096. This cutoff maximized
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, yielding 94.02% sensitivity and 98.47%

specificity. All specimens were processed in duplicate; reflex testing was conducted if ≥1 OD
measurement fell in the borderline range of 0.07-0.3 or if the coefficient of variation between
replicates was ≥30% and ≥1 OD measure was ≥0.07. All specimens considered positive by the
spike ELISA were confirmed by presence of IgG against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (John Pak, Chan-Zuckerberg Biohub), using the protocol described
above, substituting the coating antigen with RBD at 3ug/mL. Specimens were considered
positive if RBD ELISA OD values were >0.205, determined via a similar validation process as
described above for spike protein.

Statistical analyses
Clinical surveillance study: We aggregated test results from all adult (≥18 years old) patients
tested at CSVS from 15 June through 30 November, 2020. We examined the number with
positive SARS-CoV-2 TMA test results by age, sex, and farmworker status. We also computed
2-week moving averages in the daily proportion of tests yielding positive results as well as
estimates of the final proportion of tests yielding positive results by patient age, sex, and
farmworker status. We used the Beta distribution to define 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles for the
proportion positive.
Cross-sectional study: We measured associations of symptoms experienced in the last two weeks
with current TMA-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection via the relative odds of reporting solicited
symptoms (any symptoms, and each symptom individually) among individuals with positive or
negative results; we obtained adjusted odds ratios (aORs) via logistic regression models that
further accounted for age group (18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, or ≥60 years), sex, and recruitment
venue (clinic-based or outreach). We used the same logistic regression framework to estimate

aOR of experiencing each symptom since December 2019 or in the two weeks preceding
enrollment with prior infection; for these analyses, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody OD measures
(continuous) provided the exposure.
We next sought to estimate prevalence of current SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as
seropositivity among farmworkers over the study period. Here we assumed individuals recruited
via outreach testing represented the general farmworker population in the community in terms of
symptoms, infection prevalence, and serostatus. We estimated stabilized sampling weights (19)
to correct for differences in the population enrolled in the study over time. To generate weights
for each recruitment period (16 July-31 August, 1-30 September, 1-31 October, or 1-30
November), we fit a multinomial logistic regression model which included all exposures listed in
Table 1, the number of symptoms participants reported in the preceding two weeks, and the
recruitment venue as predictors.
We estimated period-specific prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and of seropositivity,
accounting for inverse sampling weights, using a generalized linear model with a log-binomial
link function. Models accounted for the four recruitment periods above, presence of any
symptoms, and recruitment venue. We used the model parameter estimates to summarize periodspecific prevalence of TMA-positive and seropositive status for individuals with and without
symptoms, whom we would have expected to reach via community outreach. To account for
missing data (1.1% of observations across all outcome and predictor variables), we sampled
estimates from five independent iterations of the analysis carried out on multiply-imputed
datasets. Analyses were conducted in R (version 4.0.3); we used the Amelia II package (20) for
multiple imputation and fit the multinomial logistic model using the nnet package (21).

RESULTS

Clinical surveillance study
Between 15 June and 30 November, CSVS administered 14,169 SARS-CoV-2 TMA tests
to adults, including 6,864 tests among farmworkers and 7,305 among other adults living in the
same communities (Figure 1A). In total, 1,514 tests among farmworkers (22.1%) had positive
results, as compared to 1,255 (17.2%) among other adults, corresponding to a 28.5% (95%
confidence interval: 20.1-37.4%) higher probability of positive test results among farmworkers
(Figure 1B-C). The test-positive fraction was similarly higher among men than among women
both among farmworkers (23.7%, men vs. 20.5%, women; risk ratio: 1.16, 1.06-1.27) and nonfarmworkers (21.7%, men vs. 18.8%, women; risk ratio: 1.15, 1.09-1.23). Point estimates of the
test-positive fraction were consistent with equal or higher prevalence of infection among
farmworkers across all age and sex strata (Figure 1D-E).
Among farmworkers, multiple peaks in the proportion of TMA tests yielding positive
results were evident, with the moving average of the test-positive fraction reaching 32.0% (27.237.0%) and 30.4% (27.0-34.0%) over the two-week periods surrounding 30 June and 14 August,
respectively (Figure 1C). After declining from mid-September to early October, both the
number of tests and the proportion yielding positive results increased through the remainder of
the study period; from 10 October to 23 November, the two-week moving average of the number
of tests conducted daily increased from 35.5 to 69.5 among farmworkers and from 38.7 to 104.5
among other adults; the proportion positive increased from 15.4% (12.2-18.8%) to 22.7% (20.025.5%) among farmworkers and from 12.1% (9.4-15.1%) to 19.9% (17.9-22.1%) among other
adults. This increase in case volume among non-farmworker adults in November, without a

commensurate rise among farmworkers, coincided with the annual migration of many Salinas
Valley farmworkers to Yuma, Arizona and elsewhere (22).

Cross-sectional study
Our cross-sectional study recruited 1,115 farmworkers, including 565 who were tested at
clinics and 550 tested via outreach. SARS-CoV-2 TMA test results were obtained for 1,111
(99.6%) of these individuals, and ELISAs were conducted for 1,058 (94.9%; Table 1). Most of
the farmworkers in this study were born in Mexico, spoke Spanish at home, had primary schoollevel education or less, earned <$25,000 per year, and worked in the fields; 36.3% lived in
crowded housing. Most (81.8%) were overweight or obese, and only 4.4% were current smokers.
In comparison to farmworkers recruited via outreach, farmworkers recruited at clinics had lower
levels of educational attainment and a shorter length of stay in the US; a higher proportion spoke
indigenous languages at home (14.9% vs. 4.7%) and reported contact with an individual
experiencing respiratory symptoms (17.9% vs. 3.3%).
Overall, 27.2% of participants reported symptoms potentially related to COVID-19 in the
last two weeks and 41.2% reported symptoms since the start of the pandemic. A higher
proportion of farmworkers recruited via the clinic compared to those recruited via outreach
reported at least one symptom potentially attributable to COVID-19 in either the two weeks
before testing (35.8% vs. 18.4%; Table 1) or the period since December 2019 (47.7% vs.
34.7%). A total of 12.7% of all farmworkers tested TMA-positive for current SARS-CoV-2
infection, including 18.7% of farmworkers tested at clinics and 6.6% of those tested via outreach
(Table 1). In contrast, 19.0% of farmworkers tested via ELISA were found to have antibody

evidence of prior infection, with similar prevalence among those tested in the clinics (18.4%) and
via outreach (19.4%).
Of all farmworkers who tested TMA-positive, 58.9% reported symptoms in the preceding
two weeks, including 64.8% among those recruited from the clinic and 41.7% of those recruited
via outreach (Table 3). Overall, 27.2% of those who had any potential COVID-19 symptoms in
the two weeks prior to enrollment had current TMA-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection. Prevalence
of current infection among farmworkers recruited in the clinic was 34.2% and 10.1% for those
reporting any symptoms and no symptoms, respectively (Table 2). Among farmworkers
recruited from outreach testing, current TMA-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in
14.9% and 4.7% of those reporting any symptoms and no symptoms, respectively. Following
adjustment for age, sex, and recruitment setting, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of a TMApositive SARS-CoV-2 test result was 4.17 (2.86-6.09) among farmworkers reporting any of the
solicited symptoms of COVID-19 relative to those reporting no symptoms (Table 3). Symptoms
most strongly associated with current SARS-CoV-2 infection included shortness of breath (aOR:
23.97; 8.15-73.27), loss of smell (aOR: 13.97; 6.29-31.41), loss of taste (aOR: 12.23; 5.6726.59), and self-reported fever (aOR: 9.55; 5.30-17.22). Each of these symptoms, however, was
reported by <25% of individuals with current SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most commonly
reported symptoms among individuals testing positive, headache (32.6%) and myalgia (31.2%),
were associated with 3.57- (2.34-5.46) and 6.15- (3.83-9.86) fold higher adjusted odds of SARSCoV-2 RNA detection, respectively.
Individuals who recalled experiencing a blocked nose, sweating, chills, headache, a
tickling sensation in the throat, a feeling of pain or pressure in the sinuses, loss of appetite,
shortness of breath, fatigue, a loss of taste, a loss of smell since December 2019 had higher

antibody reactivity, on average, than individuals who did not recall experiencing such symptoms
(Figure 2A). We also identified higher antibody reactivity among individuals experiencing
wheeze or loss of taste in the preceding two weeks, as well as suggestive associations of higher
antibody measurements with chest pain and loss of smell in the preceding two weeks (Figure
2B). Quantitative antibody reactivity measures were not found to differ significantly among
individuals who were or were not currently infected with SARS-CoV-2 (p=0.3), suggesting
associations of antibody reactivity with recent symptoms were not attributable to current
infection.
Last, we sought to estimate community prevalence of infection and seropositivity,
reweighting the sample to adjust for differences in the population tested over time. We estimated
the prevalence of current, TMA-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection was 5.6% (2.9-10.6%), 7.4%
(4.4-12.4%), 4.5% (2.6-7.5%), and 8.0% (5.5-11.7%) over the periods of 16 July to 31 August,
1-30 September, 1-31 October, and 1-30 November, respectively (Figure 3A). These results
closely tracked patterns in the proportion of tests yielding positive results among all farmworkers
tested by CSVS (Figure 1C). Over this period, we estimated between 2.0% (0.9-4.4%) and 6.4%
(4.0-10.2%) prevalence of current SARS-CoV-2 infection among asymptomatic persons in the
community, and between 7.7% (3.7-15.8%) and 17.4% (10.4-29.3%) prevalence of current
SARS-CoV-2 infection among individuals in the community experiencing ≥1 symptom.
Estimated seroprevalence increased from 10.5% (6.0-18.4%) to 21.2% (16.6-27.4%) over the
duration of the study, with similar results among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals
during each period (Figure 3B).

Among all adults tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by clinics serving the Monterey
County farmworker population, test positivity was 28% higher for farmworkers than for nonfarmworkers from the same communities. In comparison to the 6.1% overall test-positive
fraction observed in Monterey County over the same period (23), test-positivity was 362%
higher among farmworkers tested by CSVS. Within the cross-sectional study subpopulation, we
identified sustained, high prevalence of infection, with TMA-positive results among 6.6% of
individuals tested in the community and 18.7% of those tested in clinics. We estimated that
roughly 10% of the farmworker population became infected over a 3-month period during the
study, yielding ~21% seroprevalence by November, 2020. This seroprevalence is well above the
5% seroprevalence noted among California adults in a large-scale assessment of blood specimens
submitted for routine clinical screening or clinical management in September (24). A previous
study in San Francisco likewise identified elevated infection risk in an urban, low-income and
predominantly Latino population, with 6.0% prevalence of current infection among frontline
workers and. 7.7% seroprevalence as of late April (25). Our findings demonstrate high infection
risk among farmworkers during the ongoing pandemic.
We identified a diverse array of symptoms, including gastrointestinal and other nonrespiratory symptoms, associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, 41% of individuals
found to be TMA-positive for current SARS-CoV-2 infection in our study did not report
experiencing any symptoms. This figure is likely higher than the true fraction of asymptomatic
infections, as individuals could have been pre-symptomatic at the time of their interview (26),
the estimated 2-6% prevalence of infection among individuals without symptoms in the
community suggests substantial risk of exposure to clinically-inapparent cases. Guidance issued
for growers to screen farmworkers for fever or other COVID-19 symptoms is thus likely

inadequate to prevent workplace infections (27). We also identified associations of higher
antibody reactivity with current symptoms including loss of taste and smell, chest pain, and
wheeze. Participants in our study likely experienced these symptoms in a persisting manner
beyond the acute infectious stage, as seroconversion typically occurs 8-14 days following initial
symptoms (28). While the clinical profile of “long COVID” remains to be fully clarified, these
same symptoms have been identified as prominent complaints in prior studies along with fatigue,
joint pain, and headache (29–31).
Our study has limitations. We cannot verify how well our sample represents the
farmworker population, many of whom are “hidden” from population statistical measures (32).
As we excluded individuals who did not speak Spanish or English sufficiently well to participate
in the cross-sectional study, our study likely under-represents indigenous populations (estimated
at 13% of Salinas Valley farmworkers (12)). Roughly half of our cross-sectional study
participants were enrolled in clinic-based testing, among whom infection prevalence could be
expected to be higher; nonetheless, many of these individuals did not experience COVID-19
symptoms, and our statistical framework accounted for differences between clinic-based and
outreach samples. Last, waning antibody titers from infections acquired early in the pandemic
may have contributed to under-estimation of seroprevalence, in particular for individuals who
experienced mild or asymptomatic infection (33).
While Phase 1 vaccination programs have prioritized residents of long-term care facilities
and healthcare workers, at the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices (34), prioritization of differing essential workforce groups among Phase 2 recipients
will be determined by states. Our study demonstrates high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and

Figure 2: Anti-spike IgG antibody reactivity and association with recalled symptoms. We plot
distributions of antibody reactivity (optical density, OD) among individuals who (A) reported
experiencing or did not report experiencing various symptoms potentially associated with
COVID-19 since December, 2019; (B) reported experiencing or did not report experiencing
various symptoms in the two weeks before enrollment; and (C) had a positive or negative SARSCoV-2 TMA test result at the enrollment visit; and. Reported p-values are measured in logistic
