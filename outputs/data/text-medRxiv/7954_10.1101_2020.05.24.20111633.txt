Abstract
In this paper, we investigate briefly the appropriateness of the widely used logistic growth curve
modeling with focus on COVID-19 spread, from a data-driven perspective. Specifically, we suggest the
Gumbel growth model for behaviour of COVID-19 cases in European countries in addition to the United
States of America (US), for better detecting the growth and prediction. We provide a suitable fit and
predict the growth of cases for some selected countries as illustration. Our contribution will stimulate
the correct growth spread modeling for this pandemic outbreak.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, the Coronavirus pandemic, known as COVID-19, caused by a novel pathogen named Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), has shown that in early stages of infection,
symptoms of severe acute respiratory infection can occur and it is rapidly spreading across the globe.
Since we have limited knowledge about COVID-19, epidemiological modeling is still under development
and modeling the ecological growth based on the population demographic information is feasible for
reporting. It is to support the shaping of decisions around different non-pharmaceutical interventions.

The logistic function/curve is commonly used for dynamic modeling in many branches of science
including chemistry, physics, material science, forestry, disease progression, sociology, etc. But, the
question is whether it is also suitable for COVID-19 spread modeling from the available data viewpoint.
The principle of exponential growth can be applied to the transmission of COVID-19 (see [1] for a web
based dashboard). It is known that the exponential model is adequate to describe for a short period and
in general it will quickly deviate from actual numbers as time passes. The logistic growth curve was
successful in modeling some epidemics (see [2], [3], [4], [5] and [6]). Our primary goal is to see
whether the logistic function can suitably predict the spread. Some endeavours have been made to
predict and forecast the future trajectory of the COVID-19 outbreak. We refer to [7], [8], [9], [10],
[11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16] and [17] to mention a few related studies.

In none of the above mentioned studies, the Gumbel function is applied for predicting the growth of
COVID-19. Hence, in this contribution, a dynamic Gumbel model is used to track the coronavirus
COVID-19 outbreak. We organize the rest of this work as follows. In the forthcoming section, we
provide the source of data and software used for comparison and fitting purposes. Section 2 includes

the analysis of logistic modeling, outlines the shortcomings, proposes the Gumbel model as the suitable
candidate; followed by comparison with the Logistic model. Section 3 illustrates the potential of the
Gumbel model with the analysis of the COVID-19 data for selected countries. We conclude our
contribution in Section 4. The highlights of this paper can be summarised as follows:

•

Exploring logistic curve modeling for COVID-19 data and illustrating the shortcomings.

•

Proposing the modeling of COVID-19 spread with the Gumbel growth curve.

•

Fitting of COVID-19 data from different countries to strongly support the Gumbel model choice.

1.1. Experimental data
There are a number of sources on the web that provide data on COVID-19 cases. One such site is “The
Humanitarian Data Exchange” and one can find daily cumulative cases of COVID-19 per country.
https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases has a downloadable
“time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv” starting from 2020-01-22, and for some countries, it even
has the data broken down into different states or provinces. In order to perform the desired analysis,
daily cases for each country had to be obtained, but some countries, such as the US and Australia, had
the data broken down to state or provincial level. Since the focus of this research was per country, R
open source software was used to sum along the unique values of Country, appropriately transforming
the data for our analysis, then and non-linear regression was performed using the nls function.

2. Methodology and Results

2.1. Preliminary insight by using the logistic growth model
In this section, we conduct data analysis using the commonly used logistic curve modeling. A logistic
function is a common sigmoid curve with the following functional form for the dynamic model of
population at time 𝑡𝑡
𝑃𝑃(𝑡𝑡) =

𝐿𝐿
,
1+𝑒𝑒 −𝛼𝛼(𝑡𝑡−𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑜)

with initial condition 𝑃𝑃(𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑜 ) = 𝑃𝑃𝑜𝑜 , 𝐿𝐿 is the carrying capacity, the maximum capacity of the environment

here, 𝛼𝛼 > 0. Here, Eq. (1) divided by 𝐿𝐿 corresponds to the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a

logistic distribution at point 𝑡𝑡. The probability density function (PDF) is simply obtained by differentiating

the latter with respect to 𝑡𝑡.

This is useful because the difference of two Gumbel-distributed random variables has a logistic
distribution. The seemingly exponential growth of COVID-19 cases across the globe is typically the lower
half of a logistic curve during the early stage.

2.1.1. Results and discussion-Logistic model
The analysis is data-driven, and therefore, the focus of the paper is not from an epidemiological
perspective. Nevertheless, the parameter estimates are relatable to the real world. 𝐿𝐿 represents how

many cases we expect to see in the end, 𝛼𝛼 is how quickly the virus has spread/cleared and 𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑜 is where

the peak increase in cases was observed. To illustrate the failing of the logistic model, the US data was
the focus here.

Modeling the US cases, based on data until 28 March, the following results were obtained for regression.
The model was highly significant with a p-value less than 0.0001 and this is shown in the plot as well,
where the actual US data and the model are almost indistinguishable. This data suggests the total
number of COVID-19 cases will be approximately between 226,000 and 265,000. The number of
cases for the next 7 weeks was forecasted using these estimates. However, when data until 4 April is
subsequently used, parameter 𝐿𝐿, which represents the final number of cases (477922) is far beyond

what was predicted using data until the previous week (upper bound for the confidence limit of a was
265206). The slope parameter, 𝛼𝛼, decreased while the location parameter, 𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑜 increased. (See Fig 1and
Fig 2.).

Using data until 2020-04-25, the new estimate for 𝐿𝐿 once again exceeds what was predicted using

previous data and the slope parameter, 𝛼𝛼, decreased while the location parameter, 𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑜 increased. (See
Fig 3.)

Modelling the cumulative cases can be viewed as trying to model the forest as a whole, as opposed to
looking at each tree. Even if a particular tree is twice as tall as most other trees in the forest, it will not
make a big impact on the whole when all the heights are summed up. Therefore, to introduce more

variability to the data, the next approach was to analyse the daily new cases instead, by taking the
difference of the cumulative data. This way, the magnitude of daily cases will not be reduced as more
data is acquired, and it will capture the effect of large spikes. In other words, we are zooming into the
data to give more weight to the daily number of cases.

The parameter estimates below are based on the same data as the one above. The p-value for the
model was still <0.0001, suggesting that its significance was not lost in the new approach. One
observation was lost in the process of taking the difference, but by looking at the daily cases and trying
to fit a PDF instead of a CDF, we can get a much detailed view of the situation, and it has increased the
estimate for the total number of cases. See Fig 4; the view by focusing on daily case modelling using
the first derivative of the logistic function.

2.1.2. Shortcomings
In using a sigmoid function to model the data, an implicit assumption was made that it will take the
same length of time for the spread of virus to “rise” as it will to “fall.” This comes from the fact that the
Logistic function is symmetrical about the inflection point. The bar charts (see Fig. 5) show the daily
new cases for Spain, Italy and the US. Just looking at the charts below is enough to question whether
trying to fit a symmetrical shaped curve will provide a good fit or predictability. Hence the next step was
to find a distribution whose CDF appears to have the general “S” shape which has the characteristics of
a sigmoid function, yet possesses some skewness built into it such that when modelling the daily new
cases, it fits the asymmetrical data well. After looking at numerous distributions that meet all criteria,
the Gumbel distribution seemed to possess promising properties.

Fig 6 suggests how easily our eyes can deceive us. The red lines (CDF and PDF) are the Logistic
distribution and the blue lines (CDF and PDF) are the Gumbel distribution. (The dashed lines are the
PDF and the solid lines are the CDF.) If we were to just view the CDFs in isolation, there is no way that
a human will be able to tell whether the curve is symmetric or not. Even with the x and y axis drawn,
merely shifting the Gumbel CDF to the left slightly will be enough to fool the viewer that the distribution
is convincingly symmetric. On the other hand, detecting symmetry (or lack thereof) using a PDF is

visually clear, and it does not require an expert to determine that while the dashed red curve (of the
Logistic function) is symmetric, the dashed blue curve (of Gumbel) is not. Hence looking at the daily
data and detecting this skewness was crucial in suggesting an alternative model.

2.2. Gumbel growth modeling
The Gumbel distribution has been frequently used for practical probabilistic modeling. Gumbel ([18],
[19], [20] and [21]) presents a model as an extension of the exponential distribution with the feature
that it can be used to fit extreme datasets. A Gumbel dynamic model of population at time 𝑡𝑡 is defined

by

𝑃𝑃(𝑡𝑡) = 𝐴𝐴𝑒𝑒

−𝑒𝑒

𝑡𝑡−𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑜
−
𝛽𝛽

,

(2)

with initial condition 𝑃𝑃(𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑜 ) = 𝑃𝑃𝑜𝑜 , 𝐴𝐴 is the carrying capacity, the maximum capacity of the environment

here, 𝛽𝛽 > 0. Here, Eq. (2) divided by 𝐿𝐿 corresponds to the CDF of the Gumbel distribution at point 𝑡𝑡.

The PDF is simply obtained by differentiating the latter with respect to 𝑡𝑡.

Overall, the same process as the logistic function was performed with the Gumbel distribution’s PDF and
CDF. The results indicate that using Gumbel is strongly preferred over the logistic, regardless of whether
the Gumbel PDF (daily) or CDF (cumulative) is used. The parameter estimates for the total number of

cases are no longer caught up within a week and even visually, the trajectory of the graph suggests
paths for each country that are smoother and more accommodating towards future outcomes.

Regarding the parameter estimates, while the roles of "𝐴𝐴" and “𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑜 ” are analogous to those of “𝐿𝐿” and

“𝑡𝑡𝑜𝑜 ” from the logistic function, respectively, the parameter “beta” plays a somewhat different role- as a
slope/duration dual-function parameter which shrinks or stretches the curve. The Gumbel model

incorporates some level of skewness which allows it to pick up broader variation in the data. Note that
the standard errors are larger for the PDF based estimates, which is to be expected since it uses the
volatile daily data as opposed to rather-stable cumulative data .(See Table 5, Table 6 and Fig.7.)

2.3 Comparison and discussion
The following plots (Fig 8.) summarise the key difference in using Gumbel distribution over Logistic
distribution for the modelling of COVID-19 infection cases. The data used here is the number of cases in
the US until 2020-04-25, where the circles represent the number of cumulative cases. The left panel
shows the different models based on the Logistic function and the right panel shows the different
models based on the Gumbel distribution’s CDF. The different lines indicate how many weeks’ worth of
observations have been left out to simulate the results that were obtained in the past. On the left
panel, it is clear that the Logistic model fails to capture an important trait in the data, hence it fails to
keep up with the data. This is, as argued above, due to the asymmetric nature of the data. On the right
panel, however, the Gumbel model is much more robust in picking up such trends. Though the
prediction from 3 weeks ago has overestimated the number of cases, thereafter the estimates have
remained rather stable and appear to be converging for the past 2 weeks.

4. Conclusions
In this paper, we have investigated the logistic growth model. The shortcomings were shown. We
guided the reader to the solution of the use of the Gumbel model as an appropriate choice and
completed the prediction for several countries. As [22] pointed out one model cannot answer all the
questions. We hope this contribution can be a part of the set of solutions. The authors hope that this
model will be of assistance for decision makers. This paper is part of an ongoing project related to
modeling and prediction of the COVID-19 spread.
