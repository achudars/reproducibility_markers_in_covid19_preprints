Abstract
Backgrounds: An ongoing outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (Covid-19) hit Wuhan

and hundreds of cities, 29 territories in global. We present a method for scale estimation in

dynamic while most of the researchers used static parameters.

Methods: We use historical data and SEIR model for important parameters assumption.

And according to the time line, we use dynamic parameters for infection topology network

building. Also, the migration data is used for Non-Wuhan area estimation which can be

cross validated for Wuhan model. All data are from public.

Results: The estimated number of infections is 61,596 (95%CI: 58,344.02-64,847.98) by

25 Jan in Wuhan. And the estimation number of the imported cases from Wuhan of

Guangzhou was 170 (95%CI: 161.27-179.26), infections scale in Guangzhou is 315

(95%CI: 109.20-520.79), while the imported cases is 168 and the infections scale is 339

published by authority.

Conclusions: Using dynamic network model and dynamic parameters for different time

Introduction
Multiple similar pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology were identified by authority in

Wuhan, China

(Tan et al.,2020). According

to the report, the first case was appeared on 1

December, 2019. By Jan 2, 2020, there were total 41 patients who had been identified as

one of the four most important railway stations in China, which catalyzed the wide spread

However, the estimation of these studies basically focused on merely one time point and

In this article, we propose an estimation model base on topological network and try to

make estimation of infection scale of Wuhan. The quarantined factor is included into

consideration within different time lines. Further more, We also use data of a Non-Hubei

city, Guangzhou, for cross validation estimated by migration scale.

December 8 and there was no history of contact with the Huanan Seafood Market.

Therefore, based on the average incubation stage of 5.2 days (the incubation stage for 95%

of confirmed patients is about 12.5 days), the situation of human-to-human transmission

took place from mid-December. The specific time can not be estimated. As a result, we

assume that the outbreak started on December 10. At present, no satisfactory parameter

evidence has been found with respect to the confirmed rate œÅ of suspected cases. Based

on the historical data of new suspected cases on the t day and new confirmed cases on

the t + 1 day (it takes 10-12 hours for the current detection technology to get results), and

based on the Yang‚Äôs retrospect study of 8,866 cases, the confirmed rate of suspected

cases is about 46%

(Yang et al.,2020).

With reference to the historical data of SARS

(Chowell et al.,2020), Tg is 8.4 days. Based on the assumption above, R0 can be calculated.

Topology network
Many complex systems in the real world can be represented in the form of networks. For

example, if a person is regarded as a node in the network, then the connection between

people can be considered as an edge connecting nodes. That is a way which a social

relationship network can be constructed in. Similarly, in epidemiology, individuals are

nodes, and the contacts of individuals can be seen as edges. Moreover, the state of

individual (such as susceptibility, exposure, and infection) can be added to nodes as

additional information. As a result, an epidemiological network topology graph can be

constructed with these elements.

One of the most important parameters is the probability of contact between people. For

example, a person living in the city (work, transportation, dining) may need to contact

dozens of people in close range, and indirectly contact hundreds or even thousands (such

as in the subway environment) in one day. If we assume that an individual contacts 1,000

people in Guangzhou every day, therefore, the probability of contact is 10/1.5√ó107. This

contact probability can be regarded as the generation probability of edges between nodes.

population isolation caused by quarantine measures for epidemic control are very similar

with it. Therefore, we can generate a network topology graph based on the timeline of the

epidemic in subsequent simulations by considering the contact situation of the crowd,

which can reflect different situations more realistically.

Time line
According to the existing data, the overall time line of the NCP epidemic situation is sorted

out. The purpose of that is to re-evaluate the important parameters of the model in

different periods of time, so as to simulate the real situation as much as possible and

make the prediction model more accurate. There are two important parameters that will be

adjusted in different periods. The first one is contact rate(C). The second one is the

propagation risk which could be directly adjusted by using the beta value mentioned

above.

there may be a certain concentration in the hospital area, the contact rate may be higher

than other areas.

Result
Scale estimation in Wuhan
1. Early breakout, development and spread stage in Wuhan
An important parameter which should be taken into consideration is that how many

actually infected people were at the start of the outbreak on December 10. According to

Li ‚Äôstudy, the number of confirmed cases as of December 10 was 7, while the number of

confirmed cases as of December 31 was 47. If the maximum incubation period was 14

days, the actual number of infected cases on December 15 was close to 50. Besides, we

assume that the contact rate C is 0.0001 as baseline, and infectivity was not excluded

within the incubation period, and other parameters are the same with the analysis above.

The estimation (Figure 3) shows that the number of infections experienced an increase

since the end of December, and the number of new exposed had been accumulating until

January

to

considering the Spring Festival travel, this simulation is more in line with the argument that

the "golden window period" of controlling the epidemic situation is before January 10. And

after 18th the infection scale underwent a

sharp increase. The number of infections

estimated on January 25 is showed as follows. The overall infection rate is about 0.684%

and the 95% CI is 0.648%-0.721%. Because of the overall population of Wuhan during the

Spring Festival is in a dynamic state, 9 million population as baseline is assumed. The

number of infections is about 61,596, and the 95% CI is from 58,344.02 to 64,847.98.

2. Phrase A and B in Wuhan
During the 1st week after the closure of the city in Wuhan, relative shortage of medical

resources and crowd shopping for supplies may induce gathering and cross-infection.

Therefore, the contact rate in Phrase A could be considered to be adjusted to 1/15 of the

baseline, while the contagious probability is adjusted to 0.5 times the baseline. However,

these situations would be relieved after the comprehensive aid and response, so the

contact rate between people might drop to 1/30 of the baseline in phrase B, even lower.

Nevertheless, under the strict control of the confirmed cases and suspected cases, the

transmission efficiency could be going down in further. We assumed 70% confirmed

cases and suspected cases were quarantined, and probability of infection also reduced to

25% of baseline by the personal protection. As a result, by the model‚Äôs calculation, there

would be about 3,375 new infections during phrase A and phrase B in Wuhan. The 95%

CI is 2,611.31-4,138.69.

From the estimations in different time periods showed above, the total infection scale in

Wuhan is 64971, 95%CI 60,955.33-68,986.67.

Scale estimation in Guangzhou
It‚Äôs known that most of the confirmed cases in Non-Wuhan area had exposure history of

Wuhan city, and new year migration had accelerated the spreading. We combine the

migration data with the model and use Guangzhou city (provincial capital of Guangdong)

as an example to: 1. Evaluate the estimation effect of combine model for Non-Wuhan area;

2. Make a cross validation for Wuhan estimation model, because Wuhan estimation

results are used as baseline for combine model.

According to Baidu migration data (Baidu's Migration Index) analysis, combined with

Wuhan January 10, 2020 - January 24, 2020 migration index (city was blockaded on 23rd,

but there were still people moving out of Wuhan according to the migration index even on

24th), and the report that the number of people moved out before the 24th is about 5 million

people, we can estimate the number of people moving out daily as Table 2. From January

10, 2020 to January 24, 2020, 24,893 people imported to Guangzhou from Wuhan. Based

on

is

approximately 170, and 95% CI is 161.27-179.26.

Also, according to Baidu's migration index, Guangzhou's exported population was about

11.26 million from Jan 10. Guangzhou‚Äôs population is 18 million with 9 million resident

and

(Xiao

et

al.,2018). Therefore, the population base of Guangzhou after January 24 was about 7

million.

According to the timeline, Guangzhou launched level 1 public health response on Jan 23,

entered a tight control period and used various protective measures to block transmission.

We assume that the contact rate is about 1/10 of the usual (baseline). After Guangzhou

started a level 1 public health response, people from Wuhan are checked and asked for

self-isolation. In other words, the maximum free movement time of the imported infected

cases is 14 days, the minimum is 0 day. By accumulating the free movement time, we

could come to the result that the average time window of the activity of the imported

infected people is less than 8 days (Table 2). With the assumption above, the total number

of infections in Guangzhou after Jan 24 was 315, and 95% CI was 109.20-520.79.

Because of the tight control and strict self-quarantine, 315 could be the total infection

number.

Furthermore, migration data are also used to estimate the area outside Wuhan

(Guangzhou is selected here) which could also be regarded as cross-validation materials.

The model reproduces a relative comprehensive progression of the infection development

in Wuhan, which shows the ‚Äúgolden control window‚Äù and a sharp rising of infection scale

with time points. And the model also performs well on scale estimation especially in
