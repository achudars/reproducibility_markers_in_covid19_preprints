Abstract
Objectives: To observe outbreak of COVID-19 in Henan province caused by the output population
from Wuhan, and high-grade control measures were proformed in Henan province, to study the
phase of development and change of the epidemic in Henan province, and to make appropriate
inferences about the influence of prevention and control measures and the phase of development of
the epidemic.

Methods: Linear regression analysis were used to establish a linear regression model with the
number of

Wuhan roaming people as the dependent variable and the cumulative number of

COVID-19 cases in Henan province as the dependent variable, and to calculate and plot the regional
distribution of the number of cases in 18 cities in Henan province in accordance with the criteria of
whether the number of cases exceeded the expected number.

Results: There was a linear correlation between the number of people Wuhan roaming and the
number of cases, and the linear regression model equation was statistically significant. The cities

these cities were roughly in the 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock directions in Nanyang, and in terms of time
period, the first phase (10 days), the cities that exceeded the expected number of cases changed
almost daily. In the second phase (5 days), cities that exceeded the expected number of cases were
moderated, and in the third phase (15 days), cities that exceeded the expected number of cases
entered the stabilization phase.

Conclusions: The priority cities for COVID-19 prevention and control in Henan province should
pay special attention to the cities that have exceeded the expected number of COVID-19 cases, and
the implementation of high-level control measures can effectively control the spread of COVID-19
within 2-4 weeks during the early stage of the epidemic.

Background

From the COVID-19 epidemic area of Wuhan output, the number of people flowing into Henan
province, abbreviated as Wuhan roaming. A mobile phone operator has aggregated anonymous data
from Wuhan on 22 January 2020 Beijing time (similarly hereinafter),

[1,2]

which was the earlier

available information on the movement of people from Wuhan into Henan province. There are three
base operators in China with a known proportion of subscriber distribution,[3] and assuming a
consistent incidence of Wuhan roaming, the results of using Wuhan roaming data from one operator
alone, or from all operators, would not affect the linear regression model's estimate of the expected
number of incidences. At the end of 2018, the population of Henan province was 9,605 million, [4]
and Xinyang was the closest city in Henan province to Wuhan, with a distance of about 200 km
from Xinyang to Wuhan.

For those departing from Wuhan, it takes only 2-4 hours to enter Henan province. [5] On January 25,
2020, Henan province announced the initiation of a Level 1 response to a major public health
emergency

[6]

and began taking the highest level of preventive and control measures.

[7]

As of

February 23, 2020, a total of 1,271 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in Henan province,

of which 19 were deaths. [8] And from 0000 hours on March 19, 2020, the emergency response level
of major public health emergencies in Henan province was lowered from one to two. [9] We observed
the incidence in Henan under Wuhan roaming and high-grade prevention and control measures,
using linear regression analysis to classify whether the incidence exceeded the expected number of
cases, combined with the cumulative incidence distribution, to study the main phases of
development and change of the epidemic in Henan province, and to make appropriate inferences
about the impact of prevention and control measures and the phase of development and change of
the epidemic.

Statistical analysis software: R software, version 3.6.3.

Methods
The linear regression model is Y=α+βX, whose estimation model is Ŷ = a + bX, with Wuhan
roaming as the dependent variable X, and the cumulative daily number of cases in 18 cities in Henan
province from DAY 1 to DAY 30 as the dependent variable Y. DAY 1 to DAY 30 corresponds to the
cumulative number of cases in Henan province from January 25 to February 23, 2020. [11-40]

Take X as the horizontal coordinate, and Y as the vertical coordinate to draw a scatterplot.

Statistical mapping is carried out using the criteria of whether the actual number of cases exceeded
the expected number of cases.

The days is used as the horizontal coordinate, and the number of cumulative cases in the city is used
as the vertical coordinate to draw a line graph of cumulative cases.

Results
Scatter plots and linear regression models

Linear regression analysis was performed using DAY 1 as an example, and the linear analysis and
plotting from DAY 2 to DAY 30 in the same way as DAY 1.

Using X as the horizontal coordinate and Y = DAY 1 as the vertical coordinate, a scatterplot was
drawn, see Figure 1(a). The outliers were removed (Zhengzhou cumulative number of cases), and a
scatterplot was made again, see Figure 1(b), to build a linear regression model with the data after
removed the outliers.

Figures 2: Standaridized residual plots of linear regression models. Figure 2(a) was
standaridized residual plots of 18 cities in Henan, and Figure 2(b) was standaridized residual
plots of 17 cities in Henan. Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b) show that the scatter was evenly
distributed above and below the zero reference line, mostly between ±2 times the standard
deviation, and the model fited well.

The correlation coefficient of the linear regression model = 0.945, decision coefficient = 0.893,
adjusted decision coefficient = 0.886, F-value = 125.6, P-value = 1.096e-08. The model equation
was statistically significant. The regression equation model was: Ŷ = -0.6645+0.0007X, the value
of X was substituted into the above equation, the expected number of cases was calculated, and the
expected number of cases was used to calculate the ratio of expected cases, exceeded the expected
number of cases. The calculation results were shown in Table 1.

Nine cities (city code: 16, 8, 11, 1, 6, 18, 9, 13, and 2) exceed the expected number of cases, while
the remaining nine cities did not exceed the expected number of cases. The statistical map was
drawn according to the criteria of whether the cumulative number of cases in 18 cities in Henan
province exceeded the expected number of cases on the same day. DAY 2 - DAY 30 was
calculated and plotted in the same way as DAY 1. Data on the number of COVID-19 cases in
Henan in 30 days (Table 2), and data on the exceeded expected number of COVID-19 cases in
Henan in 30 days (Table 3). Statistical map see Figure 3.

There were three main phases of disease development in terms of time distribution, with DAY 1 DAY10 as the first phase, DAY 11 - DAY 15 as the second phase, and DAY 16 - DAY 30 as the
third phase.

The geographical distribution of the disease was mainly as follows: cities with more than the
expected number of cases were mainly distributed in the 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock directions with
Nanyang as the midpoint. The 1 o'clock direction covered six cities, including Nanyang,
Pingdingshan, Zhengzhou, Xinxiang, Hebi, and Anyang. The 2 o'clock direction covers four cities,
including Zhumadian, Luohe, Zhoukou, and Shangqiu.

Figure 4(b). Expected number of cases for 30 days.
Figure 4: Line plot of cumulative and expected number of cases. Figure 4(a) showed that after
three phases of development, the elevation angle of the cumulative onset curve gradually
shifted from upward to downward pressure and tended to level out. Figure 4(b) showed that
after three phases of development, most urban morbidity curves have shifted from dramatic
fluctuations to smooth and from clutter to order.

As can be seen from Figure 3 and Figure 4, the list of cities that exceeded the expected number of
cases in the first phase (DAY 1 - DAY 10, 10 days) changed daily, and the incidence curve was
highly volatile and chaotic, with a faster increase in the cumulative incidence curve and more
dramatic changes in the outbreak. In the second phase (DAY 11 - DAY 15, 5 days), the cities that
exceeded the expected number of cases were fixed in 8 cities, including Zhengzhou, Nanyang,
Zhumadian, Shangqiu, Pingdingshan, Anyang, Xinxiang, and Xuchang (cities code: 16, 8, 18, 12,
9, 1, 13, and 15). The incidence curve showed that it entered the combing phase, the elevation angle
of the cumulative incidence curve was downwardly pressed, and the level of incidence was generally
suppressed, showing a certain relief. After 10 days of strict intervention, the epidemic was
effectively suppressed, after which it entered the combing phase five days later and, after minor

Conclusions

This study showed that during the outbreak or initial epidemic phase of COVID-19, from the
perspective of the preventive and control personnel, or that was called emergency period, it was
possible to control the COVID-19 epidemic within a short period of time by immediately taking
active and strict control measures, such as necessary quarantine measures to control the source of
infection, cut off the route of transmission, and protect susceptible people, so as to achieve early
prevention, early detection, early quarantine, and early treatment. The science and effectiveness of
strict control measures during emergency periods were also supported by other research theories
and practical evidence.[41-51] At present, relying on factors of temperature and vaccines to control
the COVID-19 epidemic will also face many uncertainties, including viral variation,[52] and
indecision and oscillation between different vaccination policies may miss the boat and have
profound implications for other countries or regions. Different countries or regions may face
different levels of epidemics, and their respective processes of passing through the emergency
period into the normalized prevention and control period will not be synchronized. It is wise to take
active and stringent control measures to intervene in the epidemic according to their own conditions,
to quickly pass the emergency period of the epidemic, and to avoid fighting a protracted war during
the emergency period.
