Abstract

2

Background: In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infected

3

pneumonia (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, China. Diagnostic test based on

4

real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (qRT-PCR) was the

5

main means of confirmation, and sample collection was mostly throat swabs, which

6

was easy to miss the diagnosis. It is necessary to seek specimen types with higher

7

detection efficiency and accuracy.

8

Methods: Paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum were obtained from 54 cases,

9

and RNA was extracted and tested for 2019-nCoV (equated with SARS-CoV-2) by

10

qRT-PCR assay.

11

Results: The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens and throat swabs

12

were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. Sputum specimens showed a significantly

13

higher positive rate than throat swabs in detecting viral nucleic acid using qRT-PCR

14

assay (P=0.001).

15

Conclusions: The detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens are

16

significantly higher than throat swabs. We suggest that sputum would benefit for the

17

detection of 2019-nCoV in patients who produce sputum. The results can facilitate the

18

selection of specimens and increase the accuracy of diagnosis.

Introduction

21

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, since named severe acute respiratory

22

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China[1],

23

causing an acute febrile illness with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),

24

which the World Health Organization (WHO) has named 2019 novel coronavirus

25

disease (COVID-19).[2-4] The type of pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel

26

coronavirus (2019-nCoV, equated with SARS-CoV-2) is a highly infectious disease,

27

and the WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international

28

concern on January 30, 2020.[5] As of February 20, 2020, a total of 74679 clinically

29

diagnosed and laboratory confirmed cases had been reported in China, including 2122

1

cases of death, and more than one thousand exported cases were reported in 26

2

countries spanning Asia, Europe, Oceania, and North America. The rapid global

3

expansion and rising fatalities raised concerns about global spread.

4

Full-genome sequencing and phylogenic analysis indicated that 2019-nCoV was

5

a distinct clade from the beta-coronaviruses associated with human severe acute

6

respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).[2] The

7

2019-nCoV is close similar to bat coronaviruses, with homology of 85-96% to a bat

8

SARS-like coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZC45) at the whole genome level[6], and it has

9

been postulated that bats are the primary source. However, the origin of 2019-nCoV is

10

still under investigation, current evidence suggested that animal-to-human

11

transmission via wild animals illegally sold in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale

12

Market.[7]

13

A study in The Lancet by Huang et al[3] firstly reported 41 cases of COVID-19 in

14

which most patients had a history of exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.

15

The clinical manifestations of patients included fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia,

16

fatigue, normal or decreased leukocyte counts, and radiographic evidence of

17

pneumonia. Organ dysfunction (such as shock, ARDS, acute cardiac injury and acute

18

kidney injury) and death can occur in severe cases.[3] Signs of infection are highly

19

nonspecific, thus, diagnostic test based on detection of the viral sequence by real-time

20

reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (qRT-PCR) is the main means

21

of confirmation.

22

Appropriate specimen selection is important for the diagnosis of respiratory viral

23

infections.[8] We collected paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum for the first

24

time. The objective of this study was to compare the positive rates of 2019-nCoV

25

between throat swabs and sputum specimens in the detection of viral nucleic acid by

26

qRT-PCR. This facilitates the selection of specimens for detection of 2019-nCoV, and

27

improve the efficiency of diagnosis for patients suspected of having COVID-19.

For this retrospective, single center study, we recruited 52 patients suspected of

2

having COVID-19 from February 7 to February 16, 2020, at Jinyintan Hospital,

3

which located in Wuhan, Hubei Province, the endemic areas of COVID-19. Suspected

4

patients were diagnosed according to World Health Organization interim guidance.[9]

5

All patients enrolled in this study received detection of viral nucleic acid assays

6

(qRT-PCR) in both throat swabs and sputum specimens at the same time to make a

7

definite diagnosis. Jinyintan Hospital is a hospital for adults (ie, aged ≥ 14 years)

8

specialising in infectious diseases, and as well the first designated hospital for

9

COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. The study was approved by Jinyintan Hospital Ethics

10

Committee and oral consent was obtained from patients involved before enrolment

11

when data were collected retrospectively.

qRT-PCR Assay for SARS-CoV-2

14

Throat swabs and sputum specimens were collected for extracting 2019-nCoV

15

RNA from patients suspected of having 2019-nCoV infection. After collection, the

16

throat swabs were placed into a sterile test tube with 1 ml sterile saline, the sputum

17

specimens were added equal volume of acetylcysteine (10g/L) and shaken at room

18

temperature for 30 min to be fully liquefied, and total RNA was extracted using the

19

nucleic acid extraction kit (QIAamp viral RNA mini kit). In brief, 40μL of cell lysates

20

were transferred into a collection tube followed by vortex for 10 seconds. After

21

standing at room temperature for 10 minutes, the collection tube was centrifugated at

22

1000 rpm/min for 5 minutes. The suspension was used for qRT-PCR assay of

23

2019-nCoV RNA. Then, n*19 μL mixed reagent of fluorescence PCR detection and

24

n*1 μL RT-PCR enzyme (n was the number of reaction tubes) were mixed and

25

vortexed for a few seconds. The above mixture of 20 μL was put into the PCR

26

reaction tube respectively, after that the extracted sample by 5 μL was added.

27

qRT-PCR analysis was conducted using the ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System. The

28

PCR parameters were 45 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 45 cycles of

29

95 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and a single fluorescence detection point at 58°C. Two

Presenting Characteristics

19

The study population included 52 hospitalized patients suspected of having

20

COVID-19. The average age was 57.3 years (SD, 12.5; range, 34-84 years), and 27

21

(51.9%) were men. All patients received qRT-PCR assays in both throat swabs and

22

sputum specimens. (Table 1)

Comparison of throat swabs and sputum specimens

25

The viral nucleic acid by qRT-PCR showed that 23 cases (44.2%) of throat swabs

26

were positive while 29 cases (55.8%) were negative, and 40 cases (76.9%) of sputum

27

specimens were positive while 12 cases (23.1%) were negative (Figure 1). The

28

positive rate of sputum specimens was almost 2-fold that of throat swabs.

29

Most of the patients (51.9%) had the same results of qRT-PCR assay on throat

30

swabs and sputum specimens, 36.5% with both positive and 15.4 % with both

negative. However, quite a few patients (40.4%) showed positive sputum specimens

2

and negative throat swabs, while only a tiny minority of patients (7.7%) showed

3

negative sputum specimens and positive throat swabs. The findings showed that

4

positive rates displayed a significant statistical difference (P=0.001) between throat

5

swabs and sputum specimens. (Table 2)

Discussion

8

Adequate specimen collection is important for the diagnosis of respiratory viral

9

infections.[8] At present, the sample collection for viral nucleic acid detection of

10

suspected patients with COVID-19 is mostly upper respiratory tract samples (mainly

11

throat swabs).[10] The collection of throat swabs is not standardized and it is easy to

12

miss the diagnosis. The collection process is extremely risky for medical staff.

13

Sputum is representative of the lower respiratory tract but is rarely used for viral

14

testing. The aim of this study was to compare the detection rates of 2019-nCoV RNA

15

from throat swabs and sputum specimens using the qRT-PCR assay.

16

In our research, most of the patients were middle-aged and elderly men, which

17

was similar to previous studies.[3,4] Paired specimens of throat swabs and sputum were

18

obtained from 52 subjects. The positive rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens

19

and throat swabs were 76.9% and 44.2%, respectively. The present study found that

20

the overall positive rate from sputum specimens in adults was significantly higher

21

than that from throat swabs using qRT-PCR assay. This finding was consistent with

22

the result of a previous study that sputum showed a significantly higher positive rate

23

than nasopharyngeal swabs in detecting respiratory viruses.[8] Falsey et al[11] also

24

proved that sputum samples showed higher diagnostic yields than nose–throat swabs

25

in adults.

26

The detection rate of 2019-nCoV from sputum samples was higher than that

27

from throat swabs, which may be related to novel coronavirus's main invasion and

28

infection of lower respiratory tract cells , resulting in clinical manifestations such as

29

cough and pneumonia. In addition, several studies have shown that respiratory viruses

30

were increasingly recognized as the cause of lower respiratory tract infections.[8] In

1

these cases, specimens of the lower respiratory tract should be collected for detection

2

of 2019-nCoV. And caution should be taken when using the negative result of viral

3

nucleic acid from throat swabs as the criterion for the exclusion of infection and

4

conformation of cure.

5

It should be noted that the high viscosity of sputum can make it difficult to

6

extract nucleic acid. Therefore, pre-treatment of sputum samples is required, but

7

currently no standardized pre-treatment procedure is available for virus detection. In

8

our study, acetylcysteine was used for the digestion of sputum, which may cause

9

substantial loss of RNA due to the washing and pipetting steps in the procedures.

10

Therefore, thoroughly mixing and homogenization of sputum samples might be

11

important factors to obtain reliable test results.[8]

12

This study has several limitations. First, only 52 patients with suspected

13

COVID-19 were included, and further studies were needed to investigate the

14

observation in a larger group of patients. Second, our study only involved throat

15

swabs and sputum samples, and expand discussions of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid

16

and blood samples are necessary in the future. Although sputum is more sensitive than

17

throat swabs for 2019-nCoV detection, the use of sputum may be limited because not

18

all patients with COVID-19 produce sputum, especially elderly patients. Therefore, if

19

a sputum sample is available, it might be a rather reliable specimen for nucleic acid

20

detection of 2019-nCoV.

21

In conclusion, the detection rates of 2019-nCoV from sputum specimens are

22

significantly higher than those from throat swabs using the qRT-PCR assay. We

23

suggest that sputum would benefit for the detection of novel coronavirus in patients

24

who produce sputum. The results can facilitate the selection of specimens and

25

increase the accuracy of diagnosis of COVID-19.
