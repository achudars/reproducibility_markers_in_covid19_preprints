Abstract

44

Background: The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) control has now become a critical

45

issue for public health. Many ecological factors are proven to influence the transmission and

46

survival of the virus. In this study, we aim to determine the association of different climate

47

factors with the spread and mortality due to COVID-19.

48

Methods: The climate indicators included in the study were duration of sunshine, average

49

minimum temperature and average maximum temperature, with cumulative confirmed cases,

50

deceased and recovered cases. The data was performed for 138 different countries of the

51

world, between January 2020 to May 2020. Both univariate and multivariate was performed

52

for cumulative and month-wise analysis using SPSS software.

53

Results: The average maximum temperature, and sunshine duration was significantly

54

associated with COVID-19 confirmed cases, deceased and recovered. For every one degree

55

increase in mean average temperature, the confirmed, deceased and recovered cases

56

decreased by 2047(p=0.03), 157(p=0.016), 743 (p=0.005) individuals. The association

57

remained significant even after adjusting for environmental such as sunshine duration as well

58

as non-environmental variables. Average sunshine duration was inveserly correlated with

59

increase in daily new cases (ρ= -2261) and deaths (ρ= -0.2985).

60

Conclusion: Higher average temperature and longer sunshine duration was strongly

61

associated with COVID-19 cases and deaths in 138 countries. Hence the temperature is an

62

important factor in SARS CoV-2 survival and this study will help in formulating better

63

preventive measures to combat COVID-19 based on their climatic conditions.

Introduction

68

In December 2019, a novel virus with pneumonia-like illness was reported in a cluster of

69

patients at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China1. The new member of the Coronavirus

70

family known as ‘SARS-CoV-2 (2019) with unknown etiology increased rapidly resulting in

71

an outbreak associated with seafood markets in the city of Wuhan2. Since then it has spread

72

almost all over the globe infecting ~ 4.5M people in more than 200 countries and territories3.

73

The rate of infection is very rapid that first it was declared as a public health emergency of

74

international concern on January 31, 2020, and later its status was upgraded to pandemic.

75

Climate conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiation exposure,

76

population density, and medical care quality are many factors that affect the transmission of

77

the virus4. For the control and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the understanding of

78

the characteristics of a geographical region with the spreading of COVID-19 is important. We

79

assume that the climate conditions might also contribute to the infectivity of COVID-19.

80

The United States of America and the European Region have reported the maximum number

81

of confirmed cases and deaths related to COVID-19, whereas the African region has reported

82

the minimum number of confirmed cases and deaths3. It is a noticeable fact that the WHO-

83

South-East Asian region (SEAR) comprises approximately 23% of the world’s population but

84

accounts for only 2.9% of the COVID-19 cases worldwide, However, second most populated

85

country such as India is at the seventh position in the WHO list ofconfirmed cases with

86

mortality rates between 2.5-2.9%5.

87

In the case of the Influenza virus study, the survival and transmission rate shows significant

88

correlations with absolute humidity6. With the increase in the warm weather, a gradual

89

decrease was seen in the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome(SARS) cases in

90

Guangdong and complete resolve at the end of July 20037. Absolute humidity affects the

91

seasonal outbreak of influenza according to the epidemiological model conducted in the

92

United States8. Notably in the current pandemic of COVID-19, the role of environmental

93

factors play an important role as suggested by data of epidemiology laboratory9. Change in

94

climate conditions governs the Spatio-temporal spread of the virus10. Studies from Spain and

95

Finland show 95% of infection worldwide falls in a dry region with temperature between

96

~2°C -10◦°C11. The association between temperature and rate of infection is also seen in the

97

case of COVID-19. With the mean temperature below 3°C , there is an increase in 4.861 daily

98

confirmed case 12. A positive association and negative association is reported by Ma et al. in

99

March 202013 between daily death by COVID-19, diurnal temperature, and relative humidity

100

respectively but that only from Wuhan, China. In the warmer region, the spreading of

101

COVID -19 was less in China indicated by showing the correlation between humidity,

102

temperature, and COVID-19 outbreak4. Human movement, age, gender, comorbidities of

103

individuals and ability to socialise play an important role in transmission of the virus14. The

104

SARS-CoV-2 virus has shown a better stability at low temperature and low

105

humidity15.Another study suggested exposure of SARS-COV to 56°C temperature for 90

106

minutes can deactivate the virus indicating survival difficulty of the virus at higher

107

temperatures16. However, many other contradictory studies are reporting no association

108

between the meteorological conditions and spread of COVID-19 17,18. There is uncertainity in

109

the association between the environmental factors and transmission susceptibility of the virus.

110

Till date, there is no study that has studied the association between the sunshine duration and

111

temperature from such large cohort of population, as a proof of concept. Hence, our aim of

112

the present study, was to assess the effect of temperature, sunshine duration on confirmed,

113

recovered and deceased cases between January 2020 to May 2020. There is an urgent need

114

for better planning, regulation for preventive measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic

115

and our study will pave way for better understanding and may help the government in

116

formulating better preventive measures based on climatic conditions of the region.

Methods

118

Data Collection: In silico, we collected the data of confirmed, recovered, and death cases of

119

COVID-19 from an open-source compiled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for

120

Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) https://data.humdata.org/dataset from 22nd

121

January 2020 till 17th May 202019 from all the countries, taking into account the range of

122

countries with maximum - minimum average daily new cases and death in COVID-19. The

123

data related to the maximum and minimum temperature for all the countries were retrieved

124

from Accuweather online for the five months from January 2020 to May 2020 20. However,

125

it was difficult to gather information on all the locations in a particular country, we restricted

126

ourselves to the capital cities of each country under consideration. Hence, we collected the

127

data on maximum and minimum temperature and sunshine duration information only for the

128

capital city and considered it to be representative of the entire country. The various variables

129

that can be the potential confounders in the association between temperature and transmission

130

of COVID-19 like Population, the median age of the country, Global Health Security (GHS)

131

Rank, were also considered in the analysis. The data related to population and the median

132

age was downloaded from https://ourworldindata.org/grapher21. GHS score and GHS rank

transmission and cause of COVID-19 death and temperature or sunshine duration, we

136

assumed that countries having more than 300 cases are either having a cluster of cases or

137

community transmission and hence excluded countries having less than 300 cases. We also

138

excluded Diamond Princess from the analysis as it was a cruise ship and not a country as a

139

whole.

Data Analysis: All the data were analyzed using the SPSS software version 22 software

142

between temperature and confirmed, recovered and death cases of COVID-19. Followed by

143

correlation analysis, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses. We assumed that the

144

exposure and the outcome variable are following normal distribution and are having a linear

145

relationship for simplicity. We checked the other assumptions for linear regression and

146

failing to fulfill them, we used a robust option for further analysis. We prepared various

147

multivariate models for the analysis to understand the association better. The first model

148

included another environmental variable: Sun-shine duration.

149

included other non-environmental variables which potentially can affect the association like

150

GHS score, the median age of the population, total population per 1,00,000 individuals.

United States of America (USA), Russian Federation, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Brazil,

167

Germany, Turkey, France, and Iran account for more than 70% of the burden of the

168

confirmed cases. Moreover, the majority of COVID-19 related deaths are majorly contributed

169

by the USA, Italy, France, The United Kingdom and Spain whereas the maximum recovery

170

have been observed in countries like the USA, Germany, Spain, Italy, and Turkey. These

171

statistics indicate countries that are highly under impact of COVID-19 cases and mortality

172

are also showing a speedy recovery. Further, these could be an influence due to

environmental factors like temperature and sunshine duration.

We performed the anlaysis with 138 countries, having more than 300 confirmed cases of

177

SARS-COV-2. The overall Spearman’s rank correlation analysis between average

178

temperature (maximum and minimum) for five months and confirmed positive cases, dead

179

strong correlation (~0.87) was observed between confirmed, recovered cases, and deaths for

182

five months (Table 2). We also performed a similar correlation analysis for the five months

183

separately (Supplementary 1). The number of confirmed cases represented a significant

184

association with recovered and deceased cases each month separately, however, the

correlation became stronger with an increased number of confirmed cases, i.e, from January

Discussion

226

The spread and transmission of COVID-19 pandemic is a global emergency issue that is

227

challenging for everyone. Our finding suggests the significant association between the

228

temperature and sunshine duration with daily new cases and deaths of COVID-19. We

229

anlaysed the data from January 22, 2020, to May 17, 2020, from 138 countries. Wuhan

230

Province in China being the epicenter of the outbreak, occupies

231

American and Europen countries are at the top of the list. Most of the Asian countries are not

232

available on the list of WHOhighly affected countries by novelcoronavirus. This unexpected

233

distribution of data can be due to many reasons such as the genetics of the host, the

234

immunization against different viral strains, mode of transmission of the virus, and climate

235

conditions24.

236

This is a unique study which is addressing the association of temperature and sunshine

237

duration with COVID-19 transmission after adjusting for non-environmental factors. The

238

study also performed the cumulative as well as month-wise analysis.

239

In the correlation analysis confirmed cases, death, and recovered cases were found to be

240

significantly correlated with average minimum,maximum temperature and sunshine duration

241

(<0.05). Our study suggested a weak and negative correlation of temperature with the

242

cumulative confirmed cases, cumulative deaths, and cumulative recoveries. Moreoverever,

243

the average sunshine duration was also found to be significantly correlated with cumulative

244

confirmed cases, cumulative deaths, and cumulative recoveries . Our results were found to be

245

not coinciding with a similar study25 as the Yales study has taken data until the months of

246

March whereas the present study has taken data till May 2020.

247

The univariate analysis suggested that the cumulative confirmed cases, recovered cases, and

248

deaths due to COVID -19 were found to be significantly associated with mean maximum

249

temperature and mean minimum temperature (<0.05). For every one-degree increase in mean

250

average temperature, the confirmed cases, deaths, recovered cases decreased by 2047, 157,

251

743 individuals respectively. Though the results seems to be obvious, the decline in

252

recovered cases can be attributable to the other factors such as an increasing burden on the

253

health care system which we have not to addressed in our study.

254

After adjusting for environmental factors like sunshine duration, the association was found to

255

be significant between mean maximum temp and cumulative confirmed cases, death, and

256

recovered cases. However, the model had a weak R2 ranging from 2.40% to 3.97%. The

257

association was still found to be significant with a p-value <0.05. After adjusting for non-

258

environmental factors like GHS score, median age of the population, total population per

259

1,00,000 individuals, the R2 also improved and now ranges from 11.38% to 19.57%. A

260

reduction of 1031 confirmed cases, 32 deaths, and 378 recovered cases were observed after

adjusting for environmental and non-environmental factors. The decline in recovered cases

262

can be attributable to other factors such as an increasing burden on the health care system.

263

Though our study is a unique study but there are several limitations in our study. The lacune

264

of this study is that we assumed normal distribution of the outcome variable and linear

265

relationship between exposure and outcome variable. However, the study was not able to

266

address some kind of non-linearity in the analysis. Moreover, the data collected for the

267

temperature and sunshine duration was only retrieved for the capital city and was assumed to

268

be representative of the entire country and in reality it may not be the actual scenario. Since

269

this study was retrospective, data for various variables was not available eg. humidity,

270

airspeed, and most importantly the lockdown of human movement which is adopted by many

271

countries. The total number of cases across the globe is difficult to predict due to the

272

uncertainty of data collected by different countries. Hence, further evaluations are needed for

273

a better understanding of the role of environmental and non environmental factors influencing

274

the transmission of this pandemic. In conclusion, our study showed a possible association

275

between environmental conditions and COVID-19 infection.
