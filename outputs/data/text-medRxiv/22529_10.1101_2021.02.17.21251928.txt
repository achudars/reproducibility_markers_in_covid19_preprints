Abstract
Objectives: To confirm the incidence of perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated
mortality after surgery.

Design and setting: Analysis of routine electronic health record data from National Health
Service (NHS) hospitals in England.

Methods: We extracted data from Hospital Episode Statistics in England describing adult
patients undergoing surgery between 1

st

January 2020 and 31

st

October 2020. The

exposure was SARS-CoV-2 infection defined by ICD-10 codes. The primary outcome
measure was 90-day in-hospital mortality. Data were analysed using multivariable logistic
regression adjusted for age, sex, Charlson co-morbidity index, index of multiple
deprivation, presence of cancer, surgical procedure type and admission acuity. Results are
presented as n (%) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.

Results: We identified 1,972,153 patients undergoing surgery of whom 11,940 (0.6%) had
SARS-CoV-2. In total, 19,100 (1.0%) patients died in hospital. SARS-CoV-2 infection was
associated with a much greater risk of death (SARS-CoV-2: 2,618/11,940 [21.9%] vs No
SARS-CoV-2: 16,482/1,960,213 [0.8%]; OR: 5.8 [5.5 – 6.1]; p<0.001). Amongst patients
undergoing elective surgery 1,030/1,374,985 (0.1%) had SARS-CoV-2 of whom 83/1,030
(8.1%) died, compared with 1,092/1,373,955 (0.1%) patients without SARS-CoV-2 (OR: 29.0
[22.5 - 37.3]; p<0.001). Amongst patients undergoing emergency surgery 9,742/437,891
(2.2%) patients had SARS-CoV-2, of whom 2,466/9,742 (25.3%) died compared with
14,817/428,149 (3.5%) patients without SARS-CoV-2 (OR: 5.7 [5.4 – 6.0]; p<0.001).

Conclusions: The low incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHS surgical pathways suggests
current infection prevention and control policies are highly effective. However, the high
mortality amongst patients with SARS-CoV-2 suggests these precautions cannot be safely
relaxed.

Summary boxes
What is already known on this topic:
•

High mortality rates have been reported amongst surgical patients who develop
COVID-19 but we don’t know how this compares to the concurrent surgical population
unaffected by COVID-19.

•

Strict infection prevention and control procedures have substantially reduced the
capacity of surgical treatment pathways in many hospitals.

•

The very large backlog in delayed and cancelled surgical procedures is a growing public
health concern.

What this study adds:
•

Fewer than 1 in 100 surgical patients are affected by COVID-19 in the English National
Health Service.

•

Elective surgical patients who do develop COVID-19 are 30 times more likely to die
while in hospital.

•

Infection prevention and control procedures in NHS surgical pathways are highly
effective but cannot be safely relaxed.

Introduction
Surgery is an essential treatment modality with more than 330 million surgical procedures
performed worldwide every year.

1-3

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to substantial

reductions in the volume of surgery performed.

4, 5

Recent estimates suggest that half of the

4.5 million expected surgical procedures in the English National Health Service (NHS) were
cancelled or postponed in 2020. This is partly driven by reallocation of resources to care for
4

patients with COVID-19, but also by strict infection prevention and control procedures
implemented to prevent patients becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 whilst in hospital.

6

Patient self-isolation before surgery, pre-operative testing for SARS-CoV-2, creation of
separate ‘green zones’ in hospitals to isolate non-infected patients, and personal protective
equipment procedures all contribute to reductions in the efficiency of surgical care
pathways, and substantial reductions in the volume of patients treated.

7

Early reports have suggested that patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who undergo surgery
are at much greater risk of postoperative pulmonary complications and death.

8,9

The

COVIDSurg collaborative undertook a large international study of outcomes for surgical
patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and reported mortality rates as high as 24% at the peak
of the pandemic. However, more recent data suggest the mortality risk for surgical patients
8

with SARS-CoV-2 may be lower than originally thought, especially for minor surgery in
9

younger patients.

10

It remains unclear how SARS-CoV-2 infection affects outcomes after

surgery, and whether high mortality rates reported in some studies relate to a change in
surgical casemix during the pandemic, or to SARS-CoV-2 infection itself. At present there are
no large studies describing surgical outcomes for contemporaneous patient groups with and
without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Given the extensive disruption to surgical services and the
likely excess mortality due to untreated cancer and other surgical diseases, the NHS is under
significant pressure to relax infection prevention and control procedures to increase the
volume of patients who can undergo surgery.
We used routine NHS electronic health record data to report the rate of SARS-CoV-2
infection amongst surgical patients during the pandemic, and the associated mortality and
hospital stay.

Methods
Study design
Population-wide epidemiological study using routinely collected electronic health record
data.

Setting
NHS hospitals in England.

Participants
All patients aged 18 years or older who underwent a surgical procedure between 1 January
st

and 31 October 2020.
st

Data source
We used pseudonymised record level Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) to identify eligible
patients. This data source provides detailed data describing every episode of hospital care in
England. Surgical procedures were identified using Office for Population Censuses Surveys
version 4 (OPCS4) codes.

2,4

Individuals entered the cohort on the date of their first operative

procedure and were followed until the point of hospital discharge. Hospital discharge date
was determined based on the discharge from continuous in-patient spells, which were
constructed by mapping continuous in-patient episodes.

11

For patients remaining in

hospital, their discharge rate was right censored to the 31 October 2020. The analysis was
st

approved by the Health Research Authority (20/HRA/3121) and the NHS Digital Independent
Group Advising on the Release of Data (DARS-NIC-375669-J7M7F).

Exposure
The exposure of interest was a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection defined using the
following ICD-10 codes: U07.1 (Virus identified), U07.2 (Virus not identified) or B97.2 (Other
coronavirus as the cause of diseases classified elsewhere). Patients with SARS-CoV-2 were
categorised as symptomatic if they had ICD-10 codes for concomitant respiratory illness or
OPCS-4 codes indicating respiratory support (Supplementary table 1). Patients with SARSCoV-2 were categorised as not symptomatic if there were no associated ICD-10 codes for

respiratory illness or OPCS-4 codes for respiratory support. We divided the exposure into
three time points: Preoperative if SARS-CoV-2 codes were first recorded in an episode that
finished with the 30 days prior to the index operation; Perioperative if a code was first
recorded in the same episode as the index operation; and Postoperative if a code was first
recorded in a subsequent healthcare episode prior to discharge within 30 days after the
index operation.

Outcomes
The primary outcome was in-hospital death, censored at 90 days for patients remaining in
hospital beyond this point. The secondary outcome was length of hospital stay, calculated as
the number of days between initial operation date and discharge date of their continuous
in-patient spell, censored at 90 days.

Derivation of variables
Age was defined as that recorded on the start date of the hospital episode including the first
operative procedure. Charlson co-morbidity index was derived according to the Royal
College of Surgeons mapping which includes a one-year look back file to capture prior
admissions.

12

Classification of the type of surgical procedure was based on the first

operative code. Where multiple operative codes were associated with surgery on a single
4

day, the highest ranked code was considered the principal surgical procedure.
Socioeconomic deprivation was defined according to lower super-output areas using the
Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD).

13

Statistical methods
The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients undergoing surgery was calculated by
dividing the number of patients with an ICD-10 code indicating SARS-CoV-2 infection by the
total number of patients in the cohort. Age-adjusted incidence was calculated using deciles
of age. To test for associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection and in-hospital mortality we
14

used multivariable logistic regression analysis including the following covariates: age, sex,
Charlson co-morbidity index, IMD, presence of cancer, surgical procedure type and
admission acuity.

Results are presented as n (%), mean (SD), median (IQR) or as odds

ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals and p-values. The threshold for statistical

significance was p<0.05. We undertook two pre-specified sub-group analyses. First, we
assessed the risk of mortality among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection stratified by
urgency of surgery (elective surgery or emergency surgery). Second, we compared the risk
of mortality among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection between patients with and without
respiratory symptoms. Analyses were conducted using Python (version 3.7.5) and graphs
made in R (V4.0.2, R-project, Vienna).

Sensitivity analysis using laboratory data from NHS Wales
To check the completeness of ICD-10 coding for a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, we
compared reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection using ICD-10 codes to the integrated
central laboratory records system describing all SARS-CoV-2 test results in Wales, which
includes results of tests conducted for Welsh residents from both NHS and private
laboratories. This analysis used pseudonymised record level Patient Episode Database in
Wales (PEDW) to identify eligible patients. The project was approved by the Secure
Anonymised Information Linkage Databank (SAIL) independent Information Governance
Review Panel (Project number: 0911).

Sample size calculation
This was a population-wide cohort study including all patients that underwent surgery in
England during the study period. A sample size of 2 million patients, with an allocation ratio
of 0.01, and an alpha of 0.05 would give a 100% power to detect a 10% difference in the
relative risk of mortality among patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Results
Participants
There were 3,813,678 surgical procedures among 2,159,952 patients in England between 1

st

January and 31 October 2020. After predefined exclusions, 1,972,153 patients undergoing
st

were included in the primary analysis (Figure 1). Demographic data are presented in Table 1.
Data are presented according to surgical specialty in Table 2.

Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 among surgical patients
Among 1,972,153 adult patients who underwent surgery, 11,940 (0.6%) had SARS-CoV-2
(Table 1 and Figure 2). 8,151/12,482 (65.3%) surgical patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection had
respiratory symptoms. The age-adjusted incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among surgical
patients was 527 infections per 100,000 head of population (496-559).

Patient outcomes
19,100/1,972,153 (1.0%) patients who underwent a surgical procedure died. 2,618/11,940
(21.9%) surgical patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection died compared to 16,482/1,960,213
(0.8%) patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 3). The adjusted odds of death among
surgical patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to surgical patients without infection
is 5.8 (5.5- 6.1; p<0.001) (Table 4). Length of hospital stay among patients with and without
SARS-CoV-2 infection is presented in Table 3.

Urgency of surgery
Amongst patients undergoing elective surgery 1,030/1,373,995 (0.1%) had SARS-CoV-2
infection, of whom 83/1,030 (8.1%) died compared to 1,092/1,373,955 (0.1%) patients
without SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 3). Therefore, the incidence of death from SARS-CoV-2
infection among elective surgical patients was 83/1,373,995 (0.006% or 1 in 16556). The
adjusted odds of death among patients undergoing elective surgery with SARS-CoV-2
around the time of surgery is 29.0 (22.5-37.3; p <0.001) (Supplementary table 2). Amongst
patients undergoing emergency surgery 9,742/437,891 (2.2%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection, of
whom 2,466/9,742 (25.3%) died compared with 14,817/428,149 (3.5%) patients without
SARS-CoV-2 infection. The adjusted odds of death among patients undergoing emergency

surgery with SARS-CoV-2 around the time of surgery is 5.7 (5.4-6.0; p<0.001)
(Supplementary table 3).

Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection
Among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and respiratory symptoms 2,274/7,769 (29.3%)
died compared to 344/4,171 (8.2%) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection but no respiratory
symptoms recorded (OR 3.7 [3.3–4.3]; p < 0.001) (Supplementary tables 4 and 5).

Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among surgical patients in Wales
We identified 86,866 patients undergoing their first surgical procedure in Wales between 1

st

January and 31 October 2020. Using ICD-10 codes, 730/86,866 (0.8%) surgical patients had
st

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Adding positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test
resulted in a marginally increased the incidence of 814/86,866 (0.9%). (Supplementary table
6).

Discussion
The principal finding of this population-wide epidemiological study is that the national
incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among NHS surgical patients in England is 0.6%. However,
where perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection does occur, it is associated with more than a fivefold increase in risk of in-hospital mortality. Meanwhile, the very low risk of in-hospital
death (one in 1000) among patients undergoing elective surgery who have not been
infected with SARS-CoV-2 suggests that infection prevention and control procedures to
create COVID-19-free ‘green’ surgical pathways have been highly effective during the
pandemic.

20,21

Surgical patients with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection were almost four

times more likely to die compared to infected patients without respiratory symptoms.
The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent deaths reported in this study
represent the measured population incidences rather than an estimate from a population
sample. Our findings are consistent with previous estimates of perioperative mortality
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

22-27

The largest of these is the COVIDSurg

international multicentre observational cohort study of 1,128 surgical patients with
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was conducted during the first quarter of 2020. It
8

reported a 30-day mortality rate of 23.8%. However, the cohort consisted of only patients
with confirmed SARS-CoV-2, so it was not possible to infer the relative risk of mortality
associated with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to a contemporaneous noninfected comparator. Our data contextualises these findings from early in the pandemic by
reporting the population risk of mortality among surgical patients with SARS-CoV-2 in
England using a cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection that is more than ten times
larger. Since we included all patients undergoing surgery in England, we were able to
compare the risk of mortality among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection to patients without
infection to provide an estimate of the relative risk of death associated with SARS-CoV-2
infection. This important finding, which until now was unknown, could inform shared
decision making about surgical care of patients with SARS-CoV-2.
The volume of surgical activity during the pandemic was greatly reduced for three main
reasons.

4-6,28,29

First, the reduced capacity for elective surgery as a result of reallocation of

10

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.17.21251928; this version posted February 20, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

staff and resources to the care of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Second,
30

the reorganisation of care pathways and the introduction of necessary, but onerous,
infection control procedures have slowed down the delivery of care and patient
throughput.

21,31

Third, the reluctance of some clinicians to operate on patients at high-risk

of complications should they suffer a nosocomial infection with SARS-CoV-2.

5,32

This is

coupled with a reluctance of some patients to undergo surgery due to fears of acquiring
SARS-CoV-2 in hospital at the time of surgery. Our data confirm that the volume of surgical
activity during 2020 is about 25% lower than expected compared to previous years.

1,2

However, patients and clinicians should be reassured that the population incidence of SARSCoV-2 among surgical patients is low and the overall risk of death from SARS-CoV-2 for a
patient undergoing elective surgery in a ‘green’ pathway is less than one in 16500.

20

The

predicted delays to surgical treatments as a result of the pandemic are substantial, with an
estimated five million cases outstanding by March 2021. Although the morbidity and
4

mortality associated with cancelled or postponed surgery is unknown, it is clearly not
desirable to have a large and rapidly expanding waiting list for treatments.

5,31

Our data

confirm that while it is possible to undertake surgery safely during the pandemic, the risk of
mortality among surgical patients with SARS-CoV-2 is substantial and all efforts should be
made to prevent nosocomial infection.
This study has several strengths. We included data from all patients undergoing surgery in
England during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in England, thus our results
represent the true population incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated mortality.
We were able to include data from almost two million surgical patients, which represents
one of the largest observational cohorts of surgical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.
These data will be generalisable to other high-income countries. A major strength of our
analysis is that we controlled for changing surgical casemix during the pandemic, as well as
potential factors that could confound association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and
mortality. We used the contemporaneous comparator of patients undergoing surgery
during the pandemic who did not have SARS-CoV-2 infection. This allowed us to control for
unexpected changes in surgical casemix associated with changes in population behaviour
and healthcare delivery. We explored the potential for misclassification of SARS-CoV-2
status using a sample of patients from Wales with detailed SARS-CoV-2 testing data. The

incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in this cohort was very similar to the overall incidence across the
whole study, suggesting coding of SARS-CoV-2 using ICD-10 is accurate. Our analysis also has
some limitations. It possible that our data underestimate the true incidence of SARS-CoV-2
infection among surgical patients, particularly amongst those undergoing day case
procedures, which would lead to under-representation of asymptomatic patients who are
less likely to die. However, we only included in-hospital deaths, and our findings will
therefore underestimate the true mortality risk.
In conclusion, we have shown that the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among surgical
patients is low and the risk of postoperative mortality among patients without SARS-CoV-2
infection is very small. However, where it occurs, SARS-CoV-2 infection among surgical
patients is associated with a very high risk of death.
