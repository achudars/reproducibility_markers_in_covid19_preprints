Summary
Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection results in
a spectrum of clinical presentations. The effect of co-infection with parasites on the clinical
features of COVID-19 is unknown.
Methods: We prospectively enrolled consecutive COVID-19 patients and screened them for
intestinal parasitic infections. Patients were followed during hospitalization for clinical outcomes.
Patients with parasitic co-infection were compared to those without parasitic co-infection. The
primary outcome was the proportion of COVID-19 patients who developed severe disease.
Factors associated with the development of severe disease were determined by logistic
regression.
Results: A total of 515 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened for
intestinal parasites, of whom 267 (51.8%) were co-infected with one or more parasites. Parasitic
co-infection correlated inversely with COVID-19 severity. Severe COVID-19 was significantly
higher in patients without parasites [47/248 (19.0%, CI: 14.52-24.35)] than in those with parasites
[21/267 (7.9%, CI: 5.17-11.79)]; p<0.0001. There was a significantly higher proportion of patients
who developed severe COVID-19 in the non-protozoa group [56/369 (15.2%, CI: 11.85-19.23)] as

compared to the protozoa group [12/146 (8.2%, CI: 4.70-14.00)]; p=0.036. Significant higher
proportion of the patients presented at baseline with severe COVID-19 in the helminth negative
group [57/341 (16.7%, CI: 13.10 – 21.08)] than in the group with pre-existing helminth infection
[11/174 (6.3%, CI: 3.51 – 11.11)]; p=0.001. In addition, after adjustment for age and presence of
comorbidities, COVID-19 patients with any parasite co-infection [aOR 0.41 (95% CI: 0.22–0.77);
p=0.006], or with protozoa co-infection [aOR 0.45 (95% CI: 0.21–0.98); p=0.044] as well as those
with helminth co-infection [aOR 0.37 (95% CI: 0.17–0.80); p=0.011] had lower probability of
developing severe COVID-19 compared with those without parasite, protozoa or helminth coinfection.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that co-infection with parasitic co-infection appears to be
associated with reduced COVID-19 severity. The results suggest that parasite-driven
immunomodulatory responses may mute hyperinflammation associated with severe COVID-19.

Introduction
Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) results in a
spectrum of clinical presentations. Whereas most people with COVID-19 develop only
asymptomatic or mild illness, at-risk patients can develop severe disease requiring hospitalization
and respiratory [1-3]. In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, multi-organ failure, including acute kidney
injury and cardiac injury [2-4]. Older age and underlying comorbidities due to non-communicable
diseases (NCDs) such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, have been reported
as risk factors for disease severity and death [4-8].
Underlying conditions in the setting of low and medium-income countries (LMICs) are different
from those in high-income countries (HICs). In LMICs, infectious diseases are highly prevalent
than NCDs. One such infectious diseases are neglected infectious disease (NIDs). Most notably,
parasitic infections affect more than 2 billion people throughout the world, with
disproportionately high prevalence rates in resource-poor settings [9, 10]. Multicellular and
highly complex parasites such as Ascaris, hook worm, Trichuris, Enterobius and Schistosoma, as
well as unicellular organisms including Entamoeba, Giardia, Toxoplasma, Cyclospora and
Cryptosporidia are among the major organisms that contribute to the global intestinal parasitic
disease burden [9, 10]. The distribution of parasitic infections varies widely in the different parts
of the world.
Chronic and persistent parasitic infection is common in LIMCs, and chronic parasitic infections,
possibly in part through direct modulation of the host’s immune responses, have been shown to
alter clinical outcomes to other infections [11, 12]. Pre-existing parasitic infections may also
modify the host’s immune response to infection with SARS-CoV-2 with possible beneficial or

detrimental effects [13-19]. Recent reports demonstrated an inverse correlation between the
incidence of COVID-19 and with soil-transmitted helminths, schistosomiasis or malaria [20]. To
the best of our knowledge, however, there have been no studies to date that have assessed the
effect of co-infection with parasites on the severity of COVID-19. In this study, therefore, we
compared the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with or without parasitic co-infection.
Methods
Study design and participants
We identified individuals recruited to the Profile-CoV study who had been screened for parasitic
infections. Profile-CoV project (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04473365) is a prospective observational
cohort study being undertaken in two sites in Ethiopia, with the aim of profiling of immunological
response to SARS-CoV-2 in the context of persistent immune activation in Sub-Saharan Africa.
All patients suspected of having SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection
with a nasopharyngeal real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All patients with confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted into Kuyha Isolation Hospital run by Mekelle University
College of Health Sciences, Mekelle, Northern part of Ethiopia for isolation and treatment.
Patients were admitted irrespective of the clinical severity status. Admitted patients receive
supportive therapy according to clinical need. Patients with severe disease receive high-flow
oxygen via nasal cannula or intubation as well as dexamethasone. All COVID-19 cases confirmed
by PCR test result between July and October 2020 were included in this study.
Sociodemographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected using standardized Case Record
Forms (CRFs) adapted from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection
Consortium’s (ISARIC) CRFs for emerging severe acute respiratory infections [21]. Patient’s
clinical status was stratified following WHO criteria as asymptomatic, mild/moderate, severe
(with dyspnea, respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths per minute, O 2 saturation ≤ 93%, lung infiltrates ≥
50% of the lung fields within 24-48 hours), and critical (with respiratory failure, septic s hock,
and/or multiple organ failure) [22]. All data were then entered onto electronic medical records.
Laboratory analysis:
SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by RT-PCR on samples obtained from nasopharyngeal
swabs, according to WHO guidelines. Fresh stool sample specimens were obtained for
examination for ova and parasites. Analysis included direct microscopic examination and
modified Ritchie concentration method [23]. In addition, the intensity of infection was
determined using Kato-Katz method and was calculated and reported as individuals’ eggs per
gram of feces (EPG), as described previously [23, 24] and recommended by the WHO [25].
Helminth-positive individuals were stratified into three infection intensity categories: (i) light (1–
99 EPG), (ii) moderate (100–399 EPG), and (iii) heavy (≥400 EPG).
Ethical considerations:
Patients enrolled provided written consent to participate in to the Profile-CoV study. The study
protocol was reviewed and approved by the Health Research Ethics Review Committee (HRERC)

of Mekelle University College of Health Sciences (#ERC 1769/2020). All individual identifiers were
de-linked from the original sources.
Statistical analysis:
The primary outcome for this study was the proportion of COVID-19 patients who developed
severe disease among patients with and without a parasitic co-infection. Asymptomatic and
mild/moderate cases were classified as non-severe cases and both severe and critical were
classified as severe cases. Baseline characteristics for continuous variables were expressed as the
median with interquartile range (IQR), and for categorical variables as proportions. Whereas
categorical variables were compared using χ² test or Fisher’s exact test, categorical variables were
compared by Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis tests, as appropriate. The association between
parasitic co-infection and COVID-19 severity was determined by logistic regression analysis.
Independent variables, including age, sex, comorbidity, parasite infection (overall and disaggregated by parasite type into protozoa and helminths), were included in the initial univariate
analysis. Then a multivariate regression analyses [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)] were calculated
(with backward stepwise elimination) by including all variables that were p<0.20 by univariate
analysis. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Data was analyzed using STATA
(Statistical package v. 14.0, StataCorp, Texas, USA).

Results
Baseline socio-demographic data of the study participants is summarized in Table 1. The majority
of our study population were male (62.5%). The median age of the cohort was 32 (IQR 26–43)
years, the majority (60.7%) being in the age range 24 to 44 years. Most notably, 86.8% the cohort
population were either asymptomatic or had mild/moderate symptoms at the time of diagnosis.
The remaining (13.2%) had either severe disease or required admission to intensive care unit
(ICU). COVID-19 patients with severe disease tended to be older and had had significantly higher
symptoms, including cough (82.4% vs. 21.9%), dyspnea (70.6% vs. 2.9%), fever (61.8% vs. 13.9%),
head ache (41.2% vs. 15.4%), chest pain (25.0% vs. 1.1%), myalgia (25.0% vs. 3.1%), sore throat
(20.6% vs. 4.3%), hemoptysis (13.2% vs. 1.6%) and diarrhea (5.9% vs. 1.3%), when compared to
those presenting with non-severe form of COVID-19.
Of the total 515 individuals enrolled in the study, 267 (51.8%) harbored one or more intestinal
parasites (Table 2). Protozoa and helminth infections comprised 28.4% and 33.8%, respectively.
The most common protozoa infections were Entamoeba spp. (23.5%) and Giardia (4.6%). Among
helminths, the most common infections were H. nana (21.2%), S. mansoni (6.2%), and A.
lumbricoides (4.9%). There was no difference in gender and age distribution when those with
parasites were compared with those without parasites (Table 2). However, those without
parasite co-infection presented with significant higher proportion of fever (25.0% vs. 15.7%),
head ache (24.2% vs. 13.9%), dyspnea (18.2% vs 6.0%) and hemoptysis (5.7% vs. 0.8%) than those
with parasite co-infection. In addition, the proportion of comorbid conditions, in particular NCDs,

were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients without parasitic co-infection when compared to
those with parasitic co-infection (Table 1).
The proportion of COVID-19 patients with parasitic infection decreased with increasing
categories of disease severity, in particular for any parasitic and helminthic infections (Figure 1).
In addition, clinical outcomes were considerably worse in COVID-19 patients without parasites
(Table 1). Of all COVID-19 patients, a higher proportion of patients without parasitic co-infection
were admitted to ICU and required supplemental oxygen compared to those with parasitic coinfection (Table 1). Severe COVID-19 was significantly higher in patients without parasites
[47/248 (19.0%, CI: 14.52-24.35)] than in those with parasites [21/267 (7.9%, CI: 5.17-11.79)];
p<0.0001. There was a significantly higher proportion of patients who developed severe COVID19 in the non-protozoa group [56/369 (15.2%, CI: 11.85-19.23)] as compared to the protozoa
group [12/146 (8.2%, CI: 4.70-14.00)]; p=0.036. Significant higher proportion of the patients
presented at baseline with severe COVID-19 in the helminth negative group [57/341 (16.7%, CI:
13.10 – 21.08)] than in the group with pre-existing helminth infection [11/174 (6.3%, CI: 3.51 –
11.11)]; p=0.001. However, we did not observe any correlation between helminth egg-load with
COVID-19 severity.
In univariate analysis, older age, diabetes, hypertension, cardio-vascular diseases, chronic
obstructive lung diseases, chronic liver disease, and chronic kidney disease were all associated
with increased likelihood of COVID-19 severity (Table 3). In the contrary, having any parasite,
protozoal infection and helminth infections were all associated with reduced probability of
severe COVID-19. In multivariate analysis, older age, hypertension and chronic kidney diseases
were associated with the odds of COVID-19 severity. In addition, after adjustment for age and
presence of comorbidities, COVID-19 patients with any parasite co-infection [aOR 0.41 (95% CI:
0.22–0.77); p=0.006; Table 3], or with protozoa co-infection [aOR 0.45 (95% CI: 0.21–0.98);
p=0.044] as well as those with helminth co-infection [aOR 0.37 (95% CI: 0.17–0.80); p=0.011] had
lower probability of developing severe COVID-19 compared with those without parasite,
protozoa or helminth co-infection. Interestingly, we noted that the odds of having a NCD was
significantly lower in COVID-19 patients having co-infection with parasites (OR: 0.52 95% CI: 0.3090.2, p=0.020), or helminths (OR 0.26 95% CI: 0.12-0.56; p=0.001).

Discussion
This study demonstrated that co-infection with enteric parasites, both protozoa and helminths,
was associated with lower probability of developing severe COVID-19. To the best of our
knowledge, the findings represent the first report regarding an association between parasites
and COVID-19 severity. Notably, the association was maintained even after adjusting for age and
presence of comorbid conditions, factors commonly associated with COVID-19 severity.
In addition, previous reports have demonstrated that helminthic infection reduces the risk of
development of diabetes and metabolic syndrome in humans [26-34]. This is in line with our

finding that pre-existing chronic co-infection with parasites/helminths in our cohort was
associated with a significant lower proportion and reduced risk of NCDs. This may suggest that
the observed decreased COVID-19 severity in our cohort might be attributed through decreased
NCD risk.
The pathogenesis of severe disease in COVID-19 has been linked to the phenomenon of immune
hyperactivation [35, 36], that resembles that of chronic inflammatory condition, such as
hypertension, obesity, diabetes and inflammatory bowel diseases [37-41]. It is possible,
therefore, that parasites mute COVID-19 severity through their effects in modulating systemic
immune response. Parasitic infections modulate human’s immune systems , in such a way that
the T-helper (TH) responses are augmented along with predominant regulatory (Treg) responses
[11]. This parasite-driven TH2 response, in turn, may counterbalances TH1 responses, responsible
for the hyperinflammation associated with severe COVID-19 [11]. In addition, parasite-driven gut
microbiome changes may modulate the host’s immune response [12]. Thus, it is possible that
parasitic infections may affect pathogenesis both through direct modulation of the immune
system as well as through parasite-driven microbiome balance. Indeed, it has been demonstrated
in animal models that enteric helminth protect against pulmonary viral infections through
interaction with microbiota [42].
The strengths of the current study include the prospective nature of the study design. However,
our study has some limitations. First, stool samples were not able to be collected for every
consecutive patient which may have resulted in a potential selection bias. Second, stool
examination was determined by microscopy only. The presence of very low intensity parasite
infection determined by PCR, though shown to be superior to microscopy with increased
sensitivity and specificity [43], might indeed preclude the effects on immune modulation to have
any significant effect. Third, the effect of individual parasite species on COVID-19 severity could
not be ascertained in the current study because of the small sample size in groups with different
parasite species. Finally, the inclusion of smaller proportion of severe cases as compared to nonsevere cases in our cohort may potentially bias the results.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time that pre-existing parasitic infection, both
with protozoa and helminths, may provide some sort of protection from the pathology linked
with severe COVID-19. This is corroborated by the observed low fatality rate of COVID-19 in LMICs
settings where parasitic infections are endemic [15, 18, 20, 44]. We also recommend to expand
the study to other LMICs and also include the effect of the interplay between parasitemicrobiome on COVID-19 severity. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying severe COVID-19
offers avenues for novel preventive and therapeutic interventions.
