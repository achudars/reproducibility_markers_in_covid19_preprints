Abstract
Background: To investigate the prevalence and outcomes of acute gastrointestinal
injury (AGI) in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Methods: In this clinical retrospective study, demographic data, laboratory
parameters, AGI grades, clinical severity and outcomes were collected. The primary
endpoints were AGI incidence and 28-day mortality, the secondary endpoints were
organ dysfunction and septic shock incidence.
Results: From February 10 to March 10 2020, 83 critically ill patients of 1314
patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Seventy-two (86.7%) patients had AGI during
hospital stay, of them, 30 had AGI grade I, 35 had AGI grade II, 5 had AGI grade III,
and 2 had AGI grade IV. The incidence of AGI grade II and above was 50.6%. As of
March 16, 40 (48.2%) patients died within 28 days of admission, the median hospital
stay was 12.0 days, ranging from 3 days to 27 days. Multiple organ dysfunction
syndrome developed in 58 (69.9%) patients, septic shock in 16 (19.3%) patients.
Patients with worse AGI grades had worse clinical variables, higher septic shock
incidence and 28-day mortality. Sequential organ failure assessment scores (SOFA)
(95% CI, 1.374-2.860; P <0.001), white blood cell (WBC) counts (95% CI,
1.037-1.379; P =0.014), duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) (95% CI,
1.020-1.340; P =0.025) were risk factors for the development of AGI grade II and
above. Non-survivors were accompanied by higher incidence of AGI grade III to IV
than survivors (17.5% vs. 0.0%, P =0.004).
Conclusions: The AGI incidence was 86.7%, and hospital mortality was 48.2% in
critically ill patients with COVID-19. SOFA scores, WBC counts, and duration of
MV were risk factors for the development of AGI grade II and above. Patients with
worse AGI grades had worse clinical severity variables, higher septic shock incidence
and 28-day mortality.

Introduction
In December 2019, clusters of acute pneumonia cases of unclear etiology were
identified in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in China(1-3). The pathogen was
reported as a novel coronavirus that was named severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The World Health Organization (WHO) has made the
assessment that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be characterized as a
pandemic because the disease is spreading rapidly around the world (4). As of March
02, a total of 80151 cases (2943 deaths) were confirmed in China, including 49426
cases (2251 deaths) in Wuhan (5).
The National Health Commission of China has issued a series of diagnosis and
treatment recommendations and suggested classifying the disease into four grades:
mild, moderate, severe and critical(5). Recent studies have reported the clinical
characteristics and prognosis of COVID-19 with varied severity(1, 2, 6-8). Most of
the critically ill patients had organs injury, including acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), cardiac injury, or liver dysfunction(9).
During our clinical work against the epidemic of COVID-19 in Wuhan, we observed
that numerous patients had gastrointestinal symptoms during the course of disease
development. It is known that gastrointestinal dysfunction is closely related to adverse
outcomes in common critically ill patients. However, few literatures on acute
gastrointestinal injury (AGI) were reported in critically ill patients with COVID-19. In
this study, we investigated the prevalence and outcomes of AGI in critically ill
patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to Guanggu District of Wuhan Tongji
Hospital.

Methods
Patients
From February 10 to March 10 2020, adult patients (age ≥18 years) with
confirmed COVID-19 admitted to our specialized isolation units and intensive care
unit (ICU), Guanggu District of Wuhan Tongji hospital were enrolled in this clinical
retrospective study. Patients with chronic organ dysfunction (e.g., hepatic or renal

dysfunction), immunodeficiency, terminal cancer, and patients with a history of
long-term use of hormones were excluded. The written informed consent was waived
by our institutional review board because this was a retrospective study for emerging
infectious disease.. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was according to WHO interim
guidance and recommendations of National Health Commission of China(4, 5), and
identified by RNA detection of the SARS-CoV-2 in clinical laboratory of Tongji
hospital. The clinical outcomes (e.g., mortality, AGI incidence) were monitored up to
March 16, 2020.

Definitions
A identified case of COVID-19 was defined as a positive finding on real-time
reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and
pharyngeal swab specimens(4, 5, 7). Only laboratory-confirmed cases were enrolled
in the analysis. The clinical classification of critical COVID-19 was in accordance
with the Chinese recommendations(5): Meeting any of the following, I, respiratory
failure with mechanical ventilation (MV); II, shock; III, multiple organs failure
requiring ICU treatment. AGI was defined as a malfunction of the gastrointestinal
tract due to acute illness and was categorized into four grades according to its
severity(10). This AGI grading system was based mainly on gastrointestinal
symptoms, intra-abdominal pressure, feeding tolerance or not. AGI grade I was
defined as an increased risk of developing gastrointestinal dysfunction or failure (a
self-limiting condition); AGI grade II was defined as gastrointestinal dysfunction (a
condition that requires interventions); AGI grade III was defined as gastrointestinal
failure (GI function cannot be restored with interventions); AGI grade IV was defined
as dramatically manifesting gastrointestinal failure (a condition that is immediately
life-threatening)(10). Sepsis was defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused
by a dysregulated host response to infection, septic shock was defined as a subset of
sepsis with circulatory and cellular/metabolic dysfunction associated with a higher
risk of mortality(11). The diagnostic criteria of ARDS were in accordance with the
Berlin definitions(12). The definitions of AKI were based on the 2012 Kidney

Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines(13). Cardiac injury was defined if
serum levels of cardiac biomarkers (e.g., troponin I) were above the 99th percentile
reference upper limit or new abnormalities were found in electrocardiography and
echocardiography(2). Liver injury was defined if serum levels of hepatic biomarkers
(e.g., alanine aminotransferase) were above than twice of the reference upper limit or
disproportionate elevation of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase
levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels(14). Multiple organ dysfunction
syndrome (MODS) was defined as the combined dysfunction of two or more organs.

Data collection
The baseline clinical characteristics, including sex, age, days from onset to
admission, initial symptoms or signs, body mass index (BMI) were collected from
electronic medical and nursing records, and all laboratory tests were performed
according to the clinical needs of patients. The acute physiology and chronic health
evaluation (APACHE) II score, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score,
serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, white blood cells (WBC) count,
lymphocyte count, procalcitonin (PCT), and blood lactate within 24 hours of
admission were recorded. The RT-PCR assay of viral RNA was performed by a
commercial kit (Tianlong, Xi’an, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
All the laboratory parameters were detected by clinical laboratory of Tongji hospital.
Moreover, The numbers of patients with AGI (grades), ARDS, AKI, cardiac injury,
liver injury, septic shock, MODS, and patients receiving MV or continuous renal
replacement therapy (CRRT) during hospital stay were also recorded. The primary
endpoints were AGI incidence and 28-day mortality. The secondary endpoints were
MODS and septic shock incidence.

Statistical analysis
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was first performed to test the normal distribution
of the data. Normally distributed data were expressed as the means ± standard
deviation and were compared by t tests. Abnormally distributed data were expressed
as the medians (interquartile ranges, IQR) and were compared by the Mann-Whitney

U test or the Kruskal-Wallis test. Categorical variables were presented as absolute
numbers or percentages and were analyzed using the χ2 test or Fisher’s exact test. To
take into account the repeated nature of the variables, analysis of variance (ANOVA)
for repeated measurements of the general linear model was implemented. Pearson test
was used to analyze the correlation between two variables. To determine the risk
factors associated with AGI grade II and above, we performed a series of several
univariate logistic regression analyses using the above-mentioned variables. Variables
with P <0.1 in univariate analyses were tested in further multivariate logistic
regression analyses. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to
evaluate the associations between AGI and MODS, septic shock, and 28-day
mortality. Survival curves for up to 28 days after admission and 60 days from disease
onset were generated using the Kaplan–Meier method and were compared by the
log-rank test. IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, version 22.0,
NY, USA) software was used for statistical analysis, and P <0.05 was considered
statistically significant. The statistical methods of this study were reviewed by Qiao
Liu, a biostatistician from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Jiangsu
Province in China.

Results
As shown in Figure 1, a total of 83 critically ill patients with confirmed
COVID-19 were enrolled in this clinical retrospective study. The median age was 70
(IQR, 60-79) years, and most patients were male 59 (71.1%). Fever (33/83, 39.8%)
and cough (18/83, 21.7%) were the main initial symptoms. Seventy-two (86.7%)
patients had AGI during hospital stay, of them, 30 had AGI grade I, 35 had AGI grade
II, 5 had AGI grade III, 2 had AGI grade IV. The incidence of AGI grade II and above
was 50.6% (42/83). The detailed clinical data of the patients were presented in Table
1. As of March 16, 40 (48.2%) patients died within 28 days of admission, the median
hospital stay of them was 12.0 (IQR, 8.0-17.8) days, ranging from 3 days to 27 days.
The median duration from disease onset to death was 22.0 (IQR, 15.3-33.0) days,
ranging from 8 days to 44 days. ARDS developed in the most patients (77/83, 92.8%),

and 5 patients received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. MODS developed in
58 (69.9%) patients, septic shock in 16 (19.3%) patients.

AGI grades and clinical variables
We divided patients into four groups based on the AGI grades: No AGI (n =11),
AGI grade I (n =30), AGI grade II (n =35), and AGI grade III to IV (n =7). As shown
in Table 2, significant differences in APACHEII scores, SOFA scores, WBC counts,
and D-dimer levels were found among the four groups (P <0.05). Statistical
differences in CRP (P =0.024) and PCT (P =0.033) were only found between group
AGI grade I and grade III to IV. Significant differences in lactate levels were found
between group no AGI and AGI grade II (P =0.027) or grade III to IV (P =0.009).
Statistical differences in lymphocyte counts were found between group no AGI and
AGI grade I (P =0.028) or grade II (P =0.007). No differences in BMI were found
among the four groups (P >0.05).
Patients without AGI had longer hospital stay than those with AGI grade I (P
=0.002), II (P =0.022), and III to IV (P =0.012). Patients with AGI grade III to IV had
longer days of MV and CRRT than those without AGI (P =0.011, 0.013) and with
AGI grade I (P =0.009, 0.007). No differences in days from onset to admission were
found among the four groups (P >0.05).
Correlation analysis showed that the AGI grades were positively correlated with
MV days (R =0.377, P <0.001), APACHEII (R =0.590, P <0.001) and SOFA scores
(R =0.662, P <0.001), WBC counts (R =0.433, P <0.001), CRP (R =0.261, P =0.017)
and D-dimer levels (R =0.425, P <0.001).

AGI grades and clinical outcomes
As shown in Table 2, patients with AGI grade III to IV had higher septic shock
incidence than those without AGI (P =0.002) and with AGI grade I (P =0.001) and II
(P =0.031). Significant differences in 28-day mortality were found among the four
groups (P <0.05) except for group AGI grade I and II (P =0.540). No differences in
MODS incidence were found among the four groups (P >0.05). Non-survivors were
accompanied by higher incidence of AGI grade III to IV than survivors (17.5% vs.

0.0%, P =0.004) (Table 3). Whereas survivors had higher incidence of no AGI than
non-survivors (25.6% vs. 0.0%, P <0.001) (Table 3).
To determine the risk factors associated with AGI grade II and above, univariate
logistic regression was performed using the above-mentioned variables (sex, age, days
from onset to admission, BMI, APACHEII scores, SOFA scores, CRP, D-dimer,
WBC counts, lymphocyte counts, PCT, blood lactate, MV days, CRRT days, and
hospital stay). Variables with P <0.1 in univariate analyses were tested in further
multivariate logistic regression analyses. As shown in Table 4, three variables (SOFA
scores, WBC counts, MV days) were established as independent risk factors for the
development of AGI grade II and above.
The ROC curves were performed to evaluate the associations between AGI and
clinical outcome variables. The area under curves (AUCs) of MODS, septic shock,
and 28-day mortality were 0.659 (P =0.022), 0.793 (P <0.001), and 0.716 (P =0.001),
respectively (Figure 2). Significant differences in 28-day mortality after admission (P
=0.002) and 60-day mortality after disease onset (P =0.003) were found between
group no AGI (n =11) and AGI (n =72). As shown in Figure 3, statistical differences
in the 28-day mortality (P =0.037) and the 60-day mortality (P =0.049) were also
found between group AGI grade I to below (n =41) and AGI grade II to IV (n =42).

Discussion
This clinical retrospective study investigated the prevalence and outcomes of
AGI in critically ill patients with COVID-19. 86.7% of the patients had AGI, and
50.6% had AGI grade II and above during hospital stay. We found that patients with
worse AGI grades had worse clinical severity variables, higher septic shock incidence,
higher 28-day mortality after admission and 60-day mortality after disease onset.
SOFA scores, WBC counts, duration of MV were risk factors for the development of
AGI grade II and above. The 28-day mortality, MODS incidence, and septic shock
incidence of critically ill patients were 48.2%, 69.9%, and 19.3%, respectively.
Non-survivors were accompanied by higher incidence of AGI grade III to IV than
survivors.

Most of the critically ill patients with COVID-19 had organs injury, including
ARDS and AKI(9). However, few literatures on gastrointestinal injury were reported
in patients with COVID-19. Gastrointestinal dysfunction is common and closely
related to adverse outcomes in general critically ill patients(10, 15-17). In 2012, the
Working Group on Abdominal Problems (WGAP) of the European Society of
Intensive Care Medicine developed the definitions and a grading system for AGI in
intensive care patients(10). This expert opinion-based AGI grading system had been
proven to be a predictor of all-cause mortality (16). To our knowledge, this is the first
study to investigate AGI in critically ill patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Our results
showed that AGI incidence was very high in critically ill patients with COVID-19.
AGI was also correlated with clinical severity and outcomes of this novel disease. A
recent meta-analysis showed that the incidence of AGI was about 40% and the
mortality was 33% in critically ill patients(15). The corresponding data of this study
were higher than those of the previous reports. This phenomenon indicated that
SARS-CoV-2 was more virulent than SARS-CoV, and gastrointestinal tract was also
a vital target organ of the virus. However, the underlying mechanisms of
SARS-CoV-2 causing organs dysfunction were unknown yet.
Gastrointestinal injury was often caused by an inflammatory reaction, infection
or sepsis, severe trauma, shock, pancreatitis, and other critical diseases(10, 15, 16). As
the receptor for SARS-CoV, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was suggested
to be also the receptor for SARS-CoV-2(18). ACE2 was expressed in endothelial cells
and smooth muscle cells of almost all organs, especially in lung alveolar cells(18).
That's why the COVID-19 patients were susceptible to ARDS and even MODS. Our
findings also showed that ARDS incidence was very high (92.8%), and AGI grades
were significantly positive correlated with MV days. Liang et al. reported that ACE2
was highly expressed in small intestine, especially in proximal and distal
enterocytes(19). ACE2 expression in the epithelial cells was required for maintaining
antimicrobial peptide expression, amino acid homeostasis, and the ecology of gut
microbiome in intestine(20). Therefore, gastrointestinal symptoms were also reported
in previous studies on COVID-19(7, 8). We believed that these gastrointestinal

symptoms were the early manifestations of AGI and should be taken seriously in
clinical treatment.
In this study, we found that AGI grades were correlated with APACHEII and
SOFA scores, WBC counts, CRP and D-dimer levels. Moreover, SOFA scores, WBC
counts, and duration of MV were risk factors for the development of AGI grade II and
above. These results indicated that patients with worse AGI grades had more serious
virus infection and severe inflammatory response, which may lead to a vicious circle
between systemic infection and intestinal barrier damage. D-dimer, a fibrin
degradation product, was also considered to be associated with adverse outcomes of
COVID-19(21). The abnormal elevation of D-dimer indicated microcirculation
disturbance, including microthrombotic formation of intestinal mucosa(21). During
our clinical work against the epidemic of COVID-19 in Wuhan, we observed that
gastrointestinal hemorrhage developed in several severe patients. We speculated that
stress ulcer and intestinal microcirculation disturbance may be causes of the disorder.
Yang et al.(9) reported that ARDS developed in 67%, AKI in 29%, cardiac
injury in 23%, and liver dysfunction in 29% of critically ill patients with
SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Zhou’s study (21) presented that septic shock developed in
20%, ARDS in 31%, AKI in 15%, and cardiac injury in 17% of total patients with
COVID-19. Our results showed that ARDS developed in 92.8%, AKI in 36.1%,
cardiac injury in 44.6%, and liver injury in 18.1% of the critically ill patients with
COVID-19. The incidences of organ injury in this study were higher than those of
previous studies, which may suggest that patients with AGI had worse clinical
outcomes. The high MODS incidence (69.9%) and hospital mortality (48.2%) of
critically ill patients in this study also confirmed this conclusion. Moreover, we found
that the hospital days of patients without AGI were significantly longer than that of
patients with AGI. It could be explained by the high 28-d mortality in patients with
AGI, because the median hospital stay of non-survivors was only 12.0 (IQR, 8.0-17.8)
days, ranging from 3 days to 27 days.
Some limitations of the study should be discussed. Because of our single-center
retrospective design and small sample size, the results might be inconclusive, and the

accuracy should be confirmed by large-scale clinical prospective studies. Moreover,
because the study was not based on pathophysiological models, the results were
hypothesis generating, the exact mechanisms of AGI in COVID-19 should be tested
by more basic experiments. In addition, patients were sometimes transferred late in
their illness to our hospital. Lack of effective antivirals and inadequate adherence to
standard supportive therapy might have contributed to the poor clinical outcomes in
some patients.

Conclusions
To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate AGI in critically ill patients
with COVID-19. The AGI incidence was 86.7%, and hospital mortality was 48.2% in
critically ill patients. SOFA scores, WBC counts, and duration of MV were risk
factors for the development of AGI grade II and above. Patients with worse AGI
grades had worse clinical severity variables, higher septic shock incidence, and higher
hospital mortality.

Figure 2 The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of multiple
organ dysfunction syndrome (Fig 3A), septic shock (Fig 3B), and 28-day mortality
(Fig 3C) were 0.659 (P =0.022), 0.793 (P <0.001), and 0.716 (P =0.001),
respectively.

Figure 3 Significant differences in 28-day mortality after admission (P =0.037) and
60-day mortality after disease onset (P =0.049) were found between group AGI grade
I to below (n =41) and AGI grade II to IV (n =42).
