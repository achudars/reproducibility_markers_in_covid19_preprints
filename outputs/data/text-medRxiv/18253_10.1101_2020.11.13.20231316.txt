Abstract
Background
Rapid antigen tests (Ag-RDT) are emerging as new diagnostic tools for COVID-19 and realworld evaluations are needed to establish their performance characteristics.
Main objective
To evaluate the accuracy of the Panbio™ Ag-RDT at primary health care (PHC) centers and test
sites in symptomatic patients and close contacts, using the Reverse-Transcription Polymerase
Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test as the gold standard.
Methods
This was a prospective diagnostic study conducted in four PHC centers and two test sites in
Mallorca, Spain. Consecutive patients older than 18 years, attending the sites for RT-PCR
testing either for suggestive symptoms of infection or a close contact, were included. Two
nasopharyngeal samples were collected, one for RT-PCR and the other was processed on-site
using the Panbio™ rapid antigen test kit for SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivity and specificity were
calculated using RT-PCR as the reference, and the predictive values using the pretest probability
results for each analyzed group.
Results
A total of 1369 participants were included; mean age 42.5 ± 14.9 years and 54.3% women. The
overall prevalence was 10.2%. Most participants (70.6%) presented within 5 days of the onset
of symptoms or close contact, and more than 70% had high viral loads. The overall sensitivity
was of 71.4% (95% CI: 63.1%, 78.7%), the specificity of 99.8% (95% CI: 99.4%, 99.9%), the
positive predictive value of 98.0% (95% CI: 93.0%, 99.7%) and a negative predictive value of
96.8% (95% CI: 95.7%, 97.7%). The sensitivity was higher in symptomatic patients, in those
arriving within 5 days since symptom onset and in those with high viral load.
Conclusion
Ag-RDT had relatively good performance characteristics in suspected symptomatic patients
within five days since the onset of symptoms. However, our results concludes that a negative
Ag-RDT in these settings must be considered as presumptive.

Background
The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant challenge to the populations and health-care systems
of countries throughout the world. The early detection of infected persons using massive and
accurate testing, contact tracing, and rapid isolation are effective in slowing virus transmission.
A Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) is currently the gold standard
for diagnosis, but it has certain inconveniences, such as limited access to disposables and
reagents in some regions, high cost, long processing time, and a need for specialized
laboratories and trained personnel.
Rapid antigen detection tests (Ag-RDTs) were available soon after the COVID-19 pandemic
began. These simple and inexpensive tests use lateral flow assays to detect proteins from the
SARS-CoV-2 active infection. Nevertheless, research conducted early during the COVID-19
pandemic reported they had unsatisfactory diagnostic performance(1), especially a low
sensitivity (2). A Cochrane systematic review of 8 studies of 5 different antigen tests reported
an average sensitivity of 56.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29.5%, 79.8%) and a mean
specificity of 99.5% (95% CI: 98.1%, 99.9%)(3).
More recent studies have reported improved accuracy of Ag-RDTs, especially for patients with
high viral loads, i.e. patients who present within 5 days since symptom onset(2). On 11
September, the World Health Organization (WHO) published an interim guidance that
recommended use of an Ag-RDT for diagnosis of COVID-19 when the RT-PCR test is not
available. The WHO recommended that an Ag-RDT test must have a sensitivity of at least 80%
and a sensitivity of at least 97%, based on the gold-standard RT-PCR test (4). A patient with a
positive Ag-RDT result within 5 days of symptom onset can be considered to have a SARSCoV-2 infection because these individuals are more likely to have high viral loads. However, a
negative result should be interpreted with caution, especially in patients with high pretest
probability and confirmatory RT-PCR test following a negative Ag-RDT test is
recommended(5).
Ag-RDTs are promising point-of-care alternatives because they can be produced at low cost in
high volume, are easy to use, and provide results within 15 minutes, thus allowing quicker
clinical decisions. However, the RT-PCR test remains the gold standard for diagnosis because
prospective and real-world data on the performance of Ag-RDTs are currently limited (4).
Nevertheless, for low- and middle-income countries that lack the resources to implement
national RT-PCR testing strategies, the WHO has announced the availability of 120 million AgRDT kits (6). Moreover, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation executed separate volume
guarantee agreements with Abbott and SD Biosensor for production of an Ag-RDT.

Europe is currently experiencing a second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and there is a
greater demand for diagnostic testing. Fast diagnostic testing using an inexpensive, point-ofcare, easy-to-use, and rapid technique might help alleviate the burdens experienced by testing
laboratories and caregivers in primary healthcare (PHC) centers and COVID-19 test sites (7).
The increased demand for RT-PCR tests can cause delays in reporting of positive results and
lead to delays in contact tracing, and thus have negative consequences for control of the
COVID-19 pandemic.
Most previous studies that evaluated Ag-RDTs for COVID-19 examined symptomatic patients,
were conducted in the setting of hospital emergency services, and examined patients who
presented with moderate or severe symptoms of COVID-19. Thus, rigorous studies are needed
before Ag-RDTs can be used for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in the setting of PHC centers or
in the community.
The Panbio™ rapid antigen test kit for SARS-CoV-2 (Abbott Diagnostic GmbH, Jena,
Germany) is a qualitative test using specimens from nasopharyngeal swabs. The manufacturer
reported that the sensitivity for symptomatic patients was 93.3% overall and 98.2% in those RTPCR cycle threshold (Ct) ≤33, and that the specificity was 99.4% (8).
The main aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of the Panbio™ Ag-RDT at PHC
centers and test sites in symptomatic patients and close contacts, using the RT-PCR test as the
gold standard.

Methods
Design and setting
This prospective diagnostic study was conducted in Mallorca (Balearic Islands, Spain) from
October 2–25, 2020. Two testing locations (COVID-EXPRESS) that cover the city of Palma
and 4 PHC centers (Santa Ponça, Alcudia, Inca, and Coll d’en Rebassa) were included.
Study population
Individuals were invited to participate if they were older than 18 years, were not previously
diagnosed with COVID-19, attended one of the above-named settings for RT-PCR testing, had
symptoms suggestive of infection with referral by a general practitioner (GP), or had a close
contact with another patient with an RT-PCR-confirmed infection.
All potentially eligible participants were asked to sign an informed consent document and to
answer a short questionnaire that asked about the reasons for RT-PCR testing (referral by a GP

due to symptoms, close contact, others); socio-demographic information (sex and age); and the
presence of symptoms, type of symptoms, and number of days since symptom onset or close
contact to a positive SAR-CoV-2 patient.
SARS-CoV-2 testing
Trained nurses collected two consecutive nasopharyngeal sample swabs for the RT-PCR test
and the Ag-RDT and interpreted the results of the AG-RDT on-site.
RT-PCR
Within 24 h of collection, one nasopharyngeal swab was sent for processing to Son Espases
University Hospital, Microbiology Service without any additional information of the
participants. RNA extraction was performed using the MagMAX™ Viral/Pathogen Nucleic
Acid Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher) and amplification was performed using the TaqPath™
COVID-19 CE-IVD RT-PCR Kit and QuantStudio™ (ThermoFisher). The viral load was
expressed as Ct for three genes (ORF, N, and S).
Ag-RDT
The other nasopharyngeal swab was processed on-site using the Panbio™ Ag-RDT (Abbott
Diagnostic GmbH, Jena, Germany) and the results were interpreted within 15 min following the
manufacturer’s instructions. This kit detects the presence of the nucleocapsid (N) protein on a
membrane-based immunochromatography assay. For a positive result with the Abbot Panbio™
test, a test line must form in the result window. A visible control line is required to indicate a
test result is valid. The sample from the swab is mixed with approximately 300 μl of buffer, and
then 5 drops are dispensed into the device. Neither the test line nor the control line are visible in
the result window prior to the specimen dispensation on the device

Statistical analysis
To evaluate the accuracy of the Panbio™ Ag-RDT, the initial prevalence of COVID-19 was
estimated as 15%, the marginal error as 5%, and the sensitivity as 90%. Thus, it was necessary
to test 927 participants.
The sensitivity, specificity, and their 95% CIs were calculated using RT-PCR as the reference.
Sensitivity analysis was stratified by the declared reason for performing the RT-PCR test,
symptoms, days since symptom onset or exposure, and Ct-value. Predictive values and 95% CIs
were estimated using the pretest probability results for each analyzed group. Means and
standard deviations were used to describe population characteristics and for descriptive analysis.

All statistical calculations were performed using Stata 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX,
USA) with the Stata DIAGT module.
Ethics and funding
This study was conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the
Balearic Research Ethics Committee (IB 4350/20 PI on 30/09/2020) and by the Mallorca
Primary Care Research Commission. Each participant was asked to sign an informed consent
agreement before inclusion. This study was promoted by the Balearic Public Health Service and
no external funding was received.
Patient and public involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research question and we did not seek public
engagement in the design of the laboratory aspects of the study, nor were they involved in
developing plans for the design of the study. No patients were asked to advise on interpretation
or writing up of
results.

Results
Enrollment and characteristics of patients
We initially identified 1412 potentially eligible subjects visited consecutively in multiple PHC
centers in Mallorca (Figure 1). Twenty-seven individuals (1.9%) declined participation, mostly
because of a lack of time or anticipation of discomfort from sample collection, and we were
unable to retrieve Ag-RDT results for another 16 participants. The final sample consisted of
1369 participants, their mean age was 42.5 ± 14.9 years, and 54.3% were women. The overall
prevalence of COVID-19 was 10.2%, and there were 140 positive RT-PCR tests and 102
positive Ag-RDTs. We excluded 7 RT-PCR results from Panbio performance characteristics
analysis (3 because of incorrect labeling that could not be recovered and 4 because of
inconclusive results).
We analyzed the characteristics of all participants (Table 1). Most appointments for RT-PCR
testing were because of close contact with a confirmed positive COVID-19 individual (54.8%)
or because of symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and referral by a PHC professional (36.7%);
the other 116 individuals (8.5%) were considered as unknown, because there were referred by
PHC professionals without declaring the reason.
Almost half of the subjects (49.7%) reported symptoms within 7 days prior to testing, and the
most frequently reported symptoms were headache (24.9%), sore throat (22.6%), cough

(18.4%), and tiredness (18.3%). Most participants (70.6%) presented within 5 days of the onset
of symptoms or close contact, although these data were unavailable for 13.6% of the
participants. The SARS-CoV-2 N gene viral load was not obtained for 6, 7 for S gene and 8 for
ORF gene, out of 140 patients with positive RT-PCR results due to sample mislabeling. The
mean viral load values of the other 134 positive RT-PCR results Ct values below 25 (indicating
high viral load) for all three genes (N: 20.3±6.5, S: 21.9±6.5, ORF: 21.0±6.7). We considered
a Ct of 25 to 29.9 as moderate viral load and a Ct above 30 as low viral load. More than 70% of
the analyzed participants (n = 98) with available Ct values had high viral loads for the N gene.
Overall test accuracy
Our analysis of the overall performance of the Panbio™ test (Table 2) indicated a pretest
prevalence of 10.2%, a sensitivity of 71.4% (95% CI: 63.1%, 78.7%), and a specificity of 99.8%
(95% CI: 99.4%, 99.9%). This corresponded to a positive predictive value (PPV) of 98.0%
(95% CI: 93.0%, 99.7%) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 96.8% (95% CI: 95.7%,
97.7%).
Comparison of individuals referred by their GPs due to symptoms with individuals who had
close contact with another patient indicated better test sensitivity (80.0%, 95% CI: 67.0%,
89.5% vs. 69.7%, 95% CI: 58.1%, 79.7%) and specificity (100%, 95% CI: 99.1%, 100% vs.
99.7%, 95% CI: 98.9%, 99.9%) in the former group. The test sensitivity was particularly poor
(33.3%, 95% CI: 7.4%, 70.0%) in individuals with unknown reasons for testing. Considering all
the participants reporting symptoms, the test sensitivity was similar to those with symptoms and
referral by a GP (80.4%, 95% CI: 70.5%, 88.1%), but was considerably lower in asymptomatic
subjects (56.6%, 95% CI: 42.3%, 70.1%). Notably, the test specificity was above 99.6% in all
analyzed groups.
Test accuracy based on days since symptom onset or close contact
As noted above, most patients (n = 963) received tests within 5 days since symptom onset or
since the close contact (Table 3). Nevertheless, the overall test sensitivity for these patients was
only 77.2% (95% CI: 67.6%, 84.7%), below the minimal sensitivity recommended by WHO for
Ag-RDTs (80%). However, the test sensitivity was acceptable for patients who reported
symptoms (n = 556; 83.1%, 95% CI: 71.9%, 90.5%) and for patients referred by their GPs for
symptoms (n = 418; 86.0%, 95% CI: 71.3%, 94.2%).
The test sensitivity was also unacceptable for patients tested within 5 days since the close
contact, reporting symptoms (n = 117; 77.7%, 95% CI: 57.2%, 90.6%) or not at the moment of
testing (n = 390; 65.5%, 95% CI: 45.6%, 82.0%). These general trends in test sensitivity and
specificity were similar when the time period was prolonged from 5 to 7 days (Supplementary

Table S1). Analysis of test sensitivity according to patients’ symptoms are provided in
Supplementary Table S2.
Effect of viral load on test sensitivity
We assessed the sensitivity according to the viral gene load (Figure 2). The overall test
sensitivity for patients with high viral loads of the N gene (n = 134; Ct < 25) was 87.7% (95%
CI: 79.5%, 93.5%). Analysis of separate categories of patients with high viral loads indicated
the test sensitivity was above 80% even in asymptomatic patients (86.2%, 95% CI: 68.3%,
96.1%). Notably, test sensitivity decreased considerably for patients with higher Ct values
(lower viral loads). Analysis of S and ORF gene viral loads also indicated acceptable sensitivity
of the test for patients with high viral loads, but not for patients with low viral loads
(Supplementary Table S2).
False-negative and false-positive results
There were false-negative Ag-RDT results in 40 of the 140 patients (28.6%) who had positive
RT-PCR results. These individuals were mostly between 21 and 40 years-old (52.5%) and half
of them were women. Among these 40 patients, the main reason for testing was for being in
close contact with a SARS-CoV-2 confirmed patient within 5 days; 23 patients (57.3%)
reported no symptoms when arriving at the testing site. Among those for whom data on N gene
viral load were available (n = 36), 12 patients had high viral loads, 16 had moderate viral loads,
and 8 had low viral loads.
There were false-positive Ag-RDT results in 2 of the 1222 patients (0.1%) who had negative
RT-PCR results. Both of these patients were women, between 41 and 50 years-old, were tested
because of close contact with a known patient, and had symptoms during the previous 5 days
(headache, tiredness, and/or cough).
Inter-observer agreement
Two independent and blinded observers, one of whom was an expert evaluator, performed
visual interpretations of 68 Ag-RDT results. The interobserver agreement was 100%
(Supplementary Table 4).

No side effects were reported when collecting the nasopharyngeal swabs.

This study was an evaluation of the Panbio Ag-RDT for SARS-CoV-2 in real-life PHC settings
and test sites. Most patients visit PHC centers when they have mild or moderate symptoms of
COVID-19 or after contact tracing. We found that the overall test sensitivity was 71.4% (95%
CI: 63.1%, 78.7%), the sensitivity for symptomatic patients was 80.4% (95% CI: 70.5%,
88.1%), and the sensitivity for patients who reported symptoms within the previous 5 days was
83.1% (95% CI: 71.9%, 90.5%). The overall specificity was 99.8% (95% CI: 99.4%, 99.9%).
Based on a prevalence of 10.2%, the PPV was 98.0% (95% CI: 93.0%, 99.7%) and the NPV
was 96.8% (95% CI: 95.7%, 97.7%).
We found that test sensitivity was higher in samples that had high viral loads (Ct < 25), even in
patients who were asymptomatic at the moment of testing (86.2%, 95% CI: 68.3%, 96.1%).
This is an important finding because some asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2
infections (i.e., “super spreaders”) might have a substantial impact on the spreading of this virus
19 (9). The Ag-RDT provides fast results, thus facilitating early identification, rapid isolation of
the patient, and early contact tracing of highly contagious cases (10,11).

Strengths and limitations
The present study is the largest evaluation of the Panbio Ag-RDT in samples from symptomatic
and asymptomatic patients in real-world context. This is a strength of our study because this is
the setting where the majority of the patients with mild symptoms (up to 75%)(12) and close
contacts are visited and followed-up. We incorporated COVID-19 testing into the usual care
and management of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection and less than 2% of
participants denied taking part in the study.
Our study has several limitations. We only assessed one type of Ag-RDT that targeted the
SARS-CoV-2 N (nucleocapsid) protein, although other tests are available. Also, we only
examined two types of testing scenarios —referral by a GP based on symptoms and close
contact with a confirmed case — and therefore cannot make inferences about the applicability
of this test in other scenarios (screening of nursing-homes, workplaces, etc.). Additional
rigorous studies are needed to establish the optimal performance characteristics for Ag-RDTs
that have different protein targets, are employed in different specific settings, and that have
different pretest probabilities.
There is no standardized method to establishing the infectiousness of a patient with confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 based on viral load. Ct values can vary among studies according to the type of
test and target gene. We considered low viral load as a Ct value above 30 in patients with
positive RT-PCR results (13), and assumed that such individuals can be considered non-

infectious. However, our results reinforce the presence of positive relationships between a
positive Ag-RDT result and high viral load in all three analyzed genes (N, S, and ORF).

Comparation with other studies
The test sensitivity in our patients was lower than that provided by the manufacturer (93.3%
overall and 98.2% in those with Ct≤33), but in line with previous studies. Two studies
conducted in Spain that included symptomatic patients who attended a PHC center and hospital
emergency wards reported the overall test sensitivity was 79.6% and the sensitivity was 86.5%
in those with high viral loads (14,15). Other studies of symptomatic patients in the Netherlands
and Switzerland found similar test sensitivity (85.4%, 81.0%, and 72.6%) and a positive
correlation between Ag-RDT positivity and SARS-CoV-2 viral load (16,17). A study in France
that examined positive and negative frozen RT-PCR samples reported a much lower overall
sensitivity of only 35.3% (18); however, test sensitivity was greater in samples collected within
3 days since the onset of the symptoms and in samples from patients with high viral loads. Two
preprints (non peer-reviewed studies) reported test sensitivities of 91.7% (19) and 97.1% (10).
An evaluation report in Spain performed in symptomatic patients who visited hospital
emergency rooms reported a sensitivity of 98.2% (20). All these previous studies reported
excellent test specificity.

Policy implications
Our results support the use of the Ag-RDT for symptomatic patients within 5 days since the
onset of the symptoms in PHC setting. A positive Ag-RDT result may be considered as an
active COVID-19 infection based on high specificity and PPV data. Even though the interim
WHO guideline recommends use of the Ag-RDT for testing in low-income countries or when
RT-PCR testing is not available, several European countries have included this new diagnostic
tool as part of their national testing strategy (Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, and
others) (21). Validation reports and pilot studies are being conducted to establish the diagnostic
performance of these tests, and this may lead to future changes in the indications for the AgRDT (16,18).
Our data do not support the sole use of the Ag-RDT in asymptomatic individuals, as a negative
result does not exclude the disease. We obtained an overall NPV of 96.8% in a population that
had a prevalence of 10.2%, so at least 3 of 100 persons were potentially missed. Moreover, the
false-negative Ag-RDT results obtained in our sample were mostly individuals who had close
contact with a COVID-19 confirmed patient, were asymptomatic and most important, 12/36
participants with negative Ag-RDT result but positive RT-PCR, had high viral loads. Several
other studies found that the Ag-RDT missed diagnoses in some patients with high viral loads

(14,16,22). This might have a substantial impact from a public health point of view, because a
negative Ag-RDT result especially in individuals with high pretest probabilities must be
interpreted cautiously, and a confirmatory test should be considered(5).
There are several new approaches used to overcome the low sensitivity of the Ag-RDT, in an
effort to incorporate this test as a reliable diagnostic tool for massive testing to be used for
monitoring and controlling outbreaks. One approach is the complementary use of the Ag-RDT
with clinical diagnostic evaluations and another approach is the use of repeated testing (23). A
recent study using the enhanced epidemiological SIDHRE-Q model concluded that frequent AgRDT testing overcame the limitation of low test sensitivity, suggesting this might be an
effective method to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission (24). However, future research must
confirm these findings in real-world settings, as not all diagnostic tests are useful for
screening(25).
Our results show that a point-of-care Ag-RDT has good performance characteristics in
suspected symptomatic patients within five days since the onset of symptoms in PHC. However,
a negative Ag-RDT result must be considered presumptive when the pretest probability is high,
and a confirmatory test might be required. Further studies are needed to examine the accuracy of
the Ag-RDT in different settings with lower pretest probabilities.
