ABSTRACT:
Background: Changes in autonomic nervous system function, characterized by heart
rate variability (HRV), have been associated with and observed prior to the clinical
identification of infection. We performed an evaluation of this metric collected by
wearable devices, to identify and predict Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its
related symptoms.
Methods: Health care workers in the Mount Sinai Health System were prospectively
followed in an ongoing observational study using the custom Warrior Watch Study App
which was downloaded to their smartphones. Participants wore an Apple Watch for the
duration of the study measuring HRV throughout the follow up period. Survey’s
assessing infection and symptom related questions were obtained daily.
Findings: Using a mixed-effect COSINOR model the mean amplitude of the circadian
pattern of the standard deviation of the interbeat interval of normal sinus beats (SDNN),
a HRV metric, differed between subjects with and without COVID-19 (p=0.006). The
mean amplitude of this circadian pattern differed between individuals during the 7 days
before and the 7 days after a COVID-19 diagnosis compared to this metric during
uninfected time periods (p=0.01). Significant changes in the mean MESOR and
amplitude of the circadian pattern of the SDNN was observed between the first day of
reporting a COVID-19 related symptom compared to all other symptom free days
(p=0.01).
Interpretation: Longitudinally collected HRV metrics from a commonly worn commercial
wearable device (Apple Watch) can identify the diagnosis of COVID-19 and COVID-19
related symptoms. Prior to the diagnosis of COVID-19 by nasal PCR, significant
changes in HRV were observed demonstrating its predictive ability to identify COVID-19
infection.

INTRODUCTION

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in over 41 million infections and
more than 1.1 million deaths.1 A prolonged incubation period and variable
symptomatology has facilitated disease spread, with approximately 30-45% of
individuals having asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections, and testing generally limited
to only symptomatic individuals.2-4 Health care workers (HCWs), characterized as any
type of worker in a health care system, represent a vulnerable population with a
threefold increased risk of infection compared to the general population.5 This increased
risk of transmission is important in healthcare settings, where asymptomatic or presymptomatic HCWs can shed the virus contributing to transmission within healthcare
facilities and their households.6

Digital health technology offers an opportunity to address the limitations of traditional
public health strategies aimed at curbing COVID-19 spread.7 Smart phone Apps are
effective in using symptoms to identify those possibly infected with SARS-CoV-2, but
they rely on ongoing participant compliance and self-reported symptoms.8 Wearable
devices are commonly used for remote sensing and provide a means to objectively
quantify physiological parameters including heart rate, sleep, activity and measures of
autonomic nervous system (ANS) function (e.g., heart rate variability [HRV]).9 The
addition of physiological data from wearable devices to symptom tracking Apps has
been shown to increase the ability to identify those infected with SARS-CoV-2.10

HRV is a physiological metric providing insight into the interplay between the
parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system which modulate cardiac contractility
and cause variability in the beat-to-beat intervals.11 It exhibits a 24 hour circadian
pattern with relative sympathetic tone during the day and parasympathetic activity at
night.12-14 Changes in this circadian pattern can be leveraged to identify different
physiological states. Several studies have demonstrated that lower HRV, indicating
increased sympathetic balance, is a reliable predictor of infection onset.15,16 However,
HRV and its dynamic changes over time have not been evaluated as a marker or

predictor of COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic we launched The
Warrior Watch Study™, employing a novel smartphone App to remotely enroll and
monitor HCWs throughout the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, a site of
initial case surge. This digital platform enables remote survey delivery to Apple iPhones
and passive collection of Apple Watch data, including HRV. The aim of this study is to
determine if SARS-CoV-2 infections can be identified and predicted prior to a positive
test result using the longitudinal changes in HRV metrics derived from the Apple Watch.

METHODS

Study Design

The primary aim of the study was to determine whether changes in HRV can
differentiate participants infected or not infected with SARS-CoV-2. The secondary aim
was to see if changes in HRV can predict the development of a SARS-CoV-2 infection
prior to diagnosis by a SARS-CoV-2 nasal PCR. Exploratory aims were (1) to determine
whether changes in HRV can identify the presence of COVID-19 related symptoms; (2)
to determine whether changes in HRV can predict the development of COVID-19
related symptoms; and (3) to evaluate how HRV changed throughout the infection and
symptom period.

HCWs in the Mount Sinai Health System were enrolled in an ongoing prospective
observational cohort study. Eligible participants were ≥18 years of age, current
employees in the Mount Sinai Health System, had an iPhone Series 6 or higher, and
had or were willing to wear an Apple Watch Series 4 or higher. Participants were
excluded if they had an underlying autoimmune disease or were on medications known
to interfere with ANS function. A positive COVID-19 diagnosis was defined as a positive
SARS-CoV-2 nasal PCR swab reported by the participant. Daily symptoms were
collected including fevers/chills, tired/weak, body aches, dry cough, sneezing, runny
nose, diarrhea, sore throat, headache, shortness of breath, loss of smell or taste, itchy

eyes, none, or other. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at The
Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

Study Procedures

Participants downloaded the custom Warrior Watch App to complete eligibility
questionnaires and sign an electronic consent form. Participants completed an Appbased baseline assessment collecting demographic information, prior COVID-19
diagnosis history, occupation, and medical history and were then followed prospectively
through the App. Daily survey questionnaires captured COVID-19 related symptoms,
symptom severity, SARS-CoV-2 nasal PCR results, serum SARS-CoV-2 antibody test
results, and daily patient care related exposure (Supplementary Table 1). Participants
carried out their normal activities throughout the study and were instructed to wear the
Apple Watch for a minimum duration of 8 hours per day.

Wearable Monitoring Device and Autonomic Nervous System Assessment

HRV was measured via the Apple Watch Series 4 or 5, which are commercially
available wearable devices. Participants wore the device on the wrist and connected it
via Bluetooth to their iPhone. The Watch is equipped with an enhanced
photoplethysmogram (PPG) optical heart sensor that combines a green LED light paired
with a light sensitive photodiode generating time series peaks that correlate with the
magnitude of change in the green light generated from each heartbeat. 17 Data are
filtered for ectopic beats and artifact. The time difference between heartbeats is
classified as the Interbeat Interval (IBI) from which HRV is calculated. The Apple Watch
and the Apple Health app automatically calculate HRV using the standard deviation of
the IBI of normal sinus beats (SDNN), measured in milliseconds (ms). This time domain
index reflects both sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity and is
calculated by the Apple Watch during ultra-short-term recording periods of
approximately 60 seconds.11 The Apple Watch generates several HRV measurements
throughout a 24-hour period. HRV metrics are stored in a locally encrypted database

accessible through the iPhone Health app which is retrieved through our custom Warrior
Watch App. Data is transferred from the iPhone and Apple Watch upon completion of
the e-consent and any survey in the App. Wearable data is stored locally allowing
retrieval during the days when surveys are not completed by participants.

Statistical Analysis

Heart Rate Variability Modelling

The HRV data collected through the Apple Watch was characterized by a circadian
pattern, a sparse sampling over a 24-hour period, and a non-uniform timing across days
and participants. These characteristics bias easily derived features including mean,
maximum and minimum creating the need to derive methods that model the circadian
rhythm of HRV. A COSINOR model was used to model daily circadian rhythm over a 24
hour period with the non-linear function Y(t) = M+𝐴𝑐𝑜𝑠(2𝜋t/𝜏 + 𝜙) + ei(t) [equation 1],
where τ is the period (𝜏 =24h), M is the Midline Statistic of Rhythm (MESOR), a rhythmadjusted mean, A is the amplitude, a measure of half the extent of variation within a day
and Φ is the Acrophase, a measure of the time of overall high values recurring in each
day (Supplementary Figure 1). This non-linear model with 3 parameters has the
advantage of being easily transformed into a linear model by recoding time (t) into two
new variables x and z as 𝑥 = sin(2𝜋t/𝜏), 𝑧 = sin(2𝜋t/𝜏). HRV can then be written as
Y(t)=M+𝛽xt + 𝛾zt + ei(t) [equation 2], where the linear coefficients 𝛽, 𝛾 of the linear
model in equation 2 are related to the non-linear parameters of the non-linear model in
equation 1 by 𝛽 = 𝐴𝑐𝑜𝑠(𝜙) 𝛾 = −𝐴𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝜙). One can estimate the linear parameters 𝛽, 𝛾
and then obtain the A and 𝜙 as:

We took advantage of the longitudinal structure of the data to identify a participant
specific daily pattern and then measured departures from this pattern as a function of
COVID-19 diagnosis or other relevant covariates. In order to do so we used a mixed-

effect COSINOR model, where the HRV measure of participant i at time t can be written
as HRVit = (M+𝛽.xit + 𝛾.zit ) + 𝑊𝑖𝑡 . 𝜃𝑖 + ei(t), ei(t)~N(0,s), and where M, 𝛽 and 𝛾 are the
population parameters (fixed-effects) and 𝜃i is a vector of random effects and assumed
to follow a multivariate normal distribution 𝜃 i~N(0,Σ). In this context the introduction of
random effects intrinsically model the correlation due to the longitudinal sampling. To
measure the impact of any covariate C on the participants’ daily curve, we can introduce
such covariates as fixed-effects as its interactions with x and z: HRVit = M+𝑎oCi+(𝛽 +
𝑎2Ci).xit + (𝛾 + 𝑎 3Ci. )zit + 𝑊𝑖𝑡 . 𝜃𝑖 + ei(t) [equation 3]. Model parameters and the standard
errors of equation 3 can be estimated via maximum likelihood or reweighted least
squares (REWL) and hypothesis testing can be carried out for any comparison that can
be written as a linear function of 𝑎′ 𝑠, 𝛽 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝛾 parameters.

However, to test if the COSINOR curve, defined by the non-linear parameters M, A and
𝜙 in equation 1 differs between the populations defined by the covariate C, we
proposed the following bootstrapping procedure where for each resampling iteration we:
(1) Fit a linear mixed-effect model using REWL; (2) Estimated the marginal means
obtaining the linear parameters for each group defined by covariate C; (3) Used the
inverse relationship to estimate marginal means M, A and 𝜙 for each group defined by
C; and (4) Defined the bootstrapping statistics as the pairwise differences of M, A and 𝜙
between groups defined by C. For such iterations, the confidence intervals for the nonlinear parameter was defined using standard bootstrap techniques, as well deriving the
p-values for the differences of each non-linear parameter between groups defined by Ci.
Age and sex were included as a covariate in HRV analyses and admitted invariant and
time-variant covariates.

Association and Prediction of COVID-19 Diagnosis and Symptoms

The relationship between a COVID-19 diagnosis and change in HRV curves were
evaluated. To test this association, we defined the time variant covariate Cit for
participant i at time t as:

HRV metrics for the 14 days following the time of first positive SARS-CoV-2 nasal PCR
test were used to define the positive SARS-CoV-2 infection window. To evaluate the
predictive ability of changes in HRV prior to a COVID-19 diagnosis and to explore its
changes during the infection period, the time variant covariate was used to characterize
the following 4 groups: healthy uninfected individuals [t<t0-7], 7 days before COVID-19
diagnosis [t≥t0-7, t<t0], the first 7 days post COVID-19 diagnosis [t0≤t<t0+7] and the 714 days post diagnosis [t0+7≤t<t0+14].

To determine the association between COVID-19 symptoms and changes in HRV
metrics, we defined being symptomatic as the 1st day of a reported symptom and
compared this to all other days. To evaluate the predictive ability of HRV to identify
upcoming symptom days and to explore its changes over time the time variant covariate
was used to characterize the following 4 groups: healthy asymptomatic individuals for
t<t0-1, one day before COVID-19 symptoms [t≥t0-1, t<t0], the first day of COVID-19
symptoms [t0≤t<t0+1] and one day post COVID-19 symptom development [t0+1≤t<t0+2].

samples (range 1-129) were obtained per participant. Study compliance over the follow
up period, defined as participants answering over 50% of daily surveys, was 70.4%.

Identification and Prediction of COVID-19 Diagnosis

Thirteen participants reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 nasal PCR during the follow up
period. The mean MESOR, acrophase and amplitude of the circadian SDNN pattern in
participants diagnosed with and without COVID-19 are described in Table 2. A
significant difference in the circadian pattern of SDNN was observed in participants
diagnosed with COVID-19 compared to those without COVID-19. There was a
significant difference (p=0.006) between the mean amplitude of SDNNs circadian
pattern in those with (1.23 ms, 95% CI -1.94- 3.11) and without COVID-19 (5.30 ms,
95% CI 4.97-5.65). No difference was observed between the MESOR (p=0.46) or
acrophase (p=0.80) in these two infection states (Figure 1a-c).

The mean MESOR, acrophase and amplitude of the circadian SDNN pattern for those
without COVID-19, those during the 7 days prior to a COVID-19 diagnosis, participants
during the 7 days after a COVID-19 diagnosis and those during the 7-14 days after a
COVID-19 diagnosis are described in Table 3. Significant changes in the circadian
pattern of SDNN were observed in participants during the 7 days prior and the 7 days
after a diagnosis of COVID-19 when compared to uninfected participants. There was a
significant difference between the amplitude of the SDNN circadian rhythm between
uninfected participants (5.31 ms, 95% CI 4.95-5.67) compared to individuals during the
7 day period prior to a COVID-19 diagnosis (0.29 ms, 95% CI -4.68-1.73; p=0.01) and
participants during the 7 days after a COVID-19 diagnosis (1.22 ms, 95% CI -2.60-3.25;
p=0.01). There were no other significant differences between the MESOR, amplitude,
and acrophase of SDNNs circadian rhythm observed between healthy individuals,
individuals 7 days before a COVID-19 diagnosis, individuals 7 days after a COVID-19
diagnosis, and individuals 7-14 days after infection (Figure 1d-e).

Symptoms were frequently reported during the follow up period with the greatest
number of participants reporting feeling tired or weak (n=87), followed by headaches
(n= 82) and sore throat (n=60) (Table 4). Evaluating the days when participants
experienced symptoms, we found that loss of smell or taste were reported the most with
a mean of 138 days. This was followed by feeling tired or weak, reported a mean of 25
days and runny nose, reported a mean of 19.5 days (Figure 2). The mean MESOR,
acrophase and amplitude observed in the circadian SDNN pattern in participants on the
first day a symptom and on all other days of follow up are reported in Table 5. There
was a significant difference in the circadian SDNN pattern between participants on the
first day a symptom was reported compared to all other days of follow up. Specifically,
there was a significant difference (p=0.01) between the mean MESOR of SDNNs
circadian pattern on the first day of symptoms (46.01 ms, 95% CI 43.37-48.77)
compared to all other days (43.48 ms, 95% CI 41.77-45.27). Similarly, there was a
significant difference (p=0.01) between the mean amplitude of SDNNs circadian pattern
on the first day of symptoms (2.58 ms, 95% CI 0.26-5.00) compared to all other days
(5.30 ms, 95% CI 4.95-5.66) (Figure 3a-c).

The mean MESOR, acrophase and amplitude observed in the circadian SDNN pattern
in participants on the day before symptoms develop, on the first day of the symptom, on
the day following the first day of the symptom and on all other days are reported in
Table 6. Significant changes in the circadian pattern of SDNN were observed,
specifically in the mean amplitude (p=0.04) when comparing participants on the first day
of the symptom (3.07 ms, 95% CI 0.88-5.22) to all other days (5.32 ms, 95% CI 4.995.66). Excluded from this analysis was the day prior and day after the first symptomatic
day. Changes in SDNN characteristics trended toward significance prior to the
development of symptoms. Specifically, the differences in the mean amplitude of
SDNNs circadian pattern trended toward significance when comparing the day prior to
symptom development (2.92 ms, 95% CI 0.50-5.33) with all other days (5.32, 95% CI
4.99-5.66; p=0.056). Again, excluded from the analysis was the first day of the symptom
and the day after the first symptomatic day. Additionally, there was trend toward

significance when comparing the amplitude of the SDNN circadian pattern between
participants during the first day of the symptom (3.07 ms, 95% CI 0.88-5.22) with the
one day after the first symptom was reported (5.47 ms, 95% CI 3.16-7.76; p=0.56).
Excluded from the analysis was the day prior to symptom development and all other
days. There were no other significant differences between the MESOR, amplitude, and
acrophase of SDNNs circadian rhythm when comparing participants on the day before
symptoms develop, on the first day of the symptom, on the day following the first day of
the symptom and on all other days (Figure 3d-e).

DISCUSSION

In this prospective study, longitudinally evaluated HRV metrics were found to be
associated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and COVID-19 symptoms. Significant
changes in these metrics were observed 7 days prior to the diagnosis of COVID-19. To
the best of our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate that physiological metrics
derived from a commonly worn wearable device (Apple Watch) can identify and predict
SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to diagnosis with a SARS-CoV-2 nasal PCR swab. These
preliminary results identify a novel easily measured physiological metric which may aid
in the tracking and identification of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Current means to control COVID-19 spread rely on case isolation and contact tracing,
which have played a major role in the successful containment of prior infectious disease
outbreaks.18-20 However, the variable incubation period, high percentage of
asymptomatic carriers, and infectivity during the pre-symptomatic period of COVID-19
have made containment challenging.21 This has further limited the utility of systematic
screening technologies reliant on vital sign assessment or self-reporting of symptoms.7
Advances in digital health provide a unique opportunity to enhance disease
containment. Wearable devices are commonly used and well accepted for health
monitoring.9,22 Commercially available devices are able to continually collect several
physiological parameters. Unlike App-based platforms, wearable devices have the
advantage of not requiring users to actively participate aside from regular use of the

device. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, population level data from the Fitbit wearable
device demonstrated effectiveness at real-time geographic surveillance of influenza-like
illnesses through the assessment of physiological parameters.23 This concept was
recently expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic by Quer and colleagues who
demonstrated that the combination of symptom-based data with resting heart rate and
sleep data from wearable devices was superior to relying on symptom-based data alone
to identify COVID-19 infections.10

HRV has been shown to be altered during illnesses with several small studies
demonstrating changes in HRV associated with and predictive of the development of
infection.24 Ahmad and colleagues followed 21 subjects undergoing bone marrow
transplant finding a significant reduction in root mean square successive difference
metrics prior to the clinical diagnosis of infection. Furthermore, wavelet HRV was noted
to decrease by 25% on average 35 hours prior to a diagnosis of sepsis in 14 patients.16
In another study in 100 infants, significant HRV changes were noted 3-4 days preceding
sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome with the largest increase being
seen 24 hours prior to development.15 Building on these observations demonstrating
that ANS changes accompany or precede infection, our team launched the Warrior
Watch Study.

We demonstrated that significant changes in the circadian pattern of HRV, specifically
SDNN’s amplitude, was associated with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. Interestingly,
when we compared these changes over the seven days preceding the diagnosis of
COVID-19 we continued to see significant alterations in amplitude when compared to
individuals without COVID-19. This demonstrates the predictive ability of this metric to
identify infection. Interestingly when we follow individuals 7-14 days after diagnosis with
COVID-19, we find that the circadian HRV pattern starts to normalize and is no longer
statistically different from an uninfected pattern. As an exploratory analysis we
evaluated how HRV was impacted by symptoms associated with a COVID-19
diagnosis, since individuals may not be tested despite symptoms. We found significant
changes in the amplitude of the circadian HRV pattern on the first day of symptoms,

with a trend toward statistical significance on the day before and after symptoms are
reported. Taken together, these findings highlight the possible use of HRV collected via
wearable devices to identify and predict COVID-19 infections.

There are several limitations to our study. First, there was a small number of
participants who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in our cohort limiting our ability to
determine how predictive HRV can be of infection. However, these preliminary findings
support the further evaluation of HRV as a metric to identify and predict COVID-19 and
warrant further study. An additional limitation is the sporadic collection of HRV by the
Apple Watch. While our statistical modelling was able to account for this a denser
dataset would allow for expanded evaluation of the relationship between this metric and
infections/symptoms. The Apple Watch also only provides HRV in one time-domain
(SDNN), limiting assessment of the relationship between other HRV parameters with
COVID-19 outcomes. Lastly, an additional limitation is that we relied on self-reported
data in this study, precluding independent verification of COVID-19 diagnosis.

In summary, we demonstrated a relationship between longitudinally collected HRV
acquired from a commonly used wearable device and SARS-CoV-2 infection. These
preliminary results support the further evaluation of HRV as a biomarker of SARS-CoV2 infection by remote sensing means. While further study is needed, this may allow for
the identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pre-symptomatic period, in
asymptomatic carriers and prior to diagnosis by a SARS-CoV-2 nasal PCR tests. These
findings warrant further evaluation of this approach to track and identify COVID-19
infections and possibly other type of infections.

Figure 3: Relationship between HRV circadian rhythm and symptom onset.
Timeline (A) illustrates timing of symptom onset, HRV profiles of the first-symptom day
(red) were compared to all other days (green). Daily HRV rhythm (B) on day of first
symptom (red) and non/late-symptom (green) days, time (hours) is indicated by the xaxis and HRV (ms) is indicated by the y-axis. Plots (C) showing Mean and 95%CI for
the parameters defining the circadian rhythm: Acrophase, Amplitude and MESOR on
first symptom (red) and non/late-symptom (green) days. Daily HRV pattern (D) for
non/late-symptomatic days (green), the day before first symptom (red), day of first
symptom (orange) and day after first symptom (light green), time (hours) is indicated by
the x-axis while HRV (ms) is indicated by the y-axis. Mean and 95% CI for the
Acrophase, Amplitude and MESOR of the HRV measured on non/late-symptomatic
days (green), the day before first symptom (red), day of first symptom (orange) and day
after first symptom (light green),

Supplementary Figure 1. Locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (loess) curve showing
a daily circadian pattern on HRV measures. Such pattern can be represented by the
COSINOR model using 3 parameters: the rhythm-adjusted mean (MESOR), half the
extent of variation within a day (Amplitude) and the time of overall high values recurring
in each day (acrophase). Red and green dots represent hypothetical sampling times
though the day from two subjects that have the same daily curve, showing that features
like maximum, range, or CV will be easily biased by the sampling time.
