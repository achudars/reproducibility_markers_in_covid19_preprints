Ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease has become a global
health concern. Since a patient with pneumonia of unknown etiology were firstly reported in
the city of Wuhan on 30th of Dec, 2019., Subsequently, epidemiological, clinical, radiological,

laboratory and genomic findings of this virus gradually revealed by the Chinese and 00
experts around the globe [1]. At current stage, however, two topics emerged as things that needed
to
be
addressed.
Firstly,
according
to
latest
diagnostic
criteria,
reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays are recommended as the
standard diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-infection. Despite, present studies found that some patients
had typical imaging findings, including ground-glass opacity, but negative RT-PCR testing [2].
The false-negative RT-PCR results may cause by many reasons, especially insufficient detection
sensitivity in a low viral load scenario [2]. Secondly, although, by using metagenome sequencing,
the complete genome sequence, taxonomic position, potential intermediate hosts, and evolutionary
history of SARS-CoV-2 have been already reported [3-6], it is more important to monitor the virus
mutation and its influence on disease severity and progression. Necessitating the full-length of
SARS-CoV-2 genome, metagenome sequencing technology is the latest and most comprehensive
approach but still costly. Moreover, in metagenome sequencing library, there are human (host)
nucleic acid contamination cannot be eliminated. Inevitably, the carrier RNA introduced by
commercial RNA extraction kits presented as contamination in library preparation stage, which
indeed impairs the amount of viral sequence readout.
In the context, we developed a set of SARS-CoV-2 enrichment probes, by utilizing
hybridization capture technology, to increase the sensitivity of sequence-based virus detection and
characterization. This method was first used to enrich sequence targets from the human genome [7]

and then from vertebrate virome [8]. The enrichment probe set contains 502 ssDNA
biotin-labelled probes at 2X tiling designed based on all available SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences,
downloaded from the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data;
https://www.gisaid.org/) on 2/1/2020, and it can be used to enrich for SARS-CoV-2 sequences
without prior knowledge of type or subtype. Additionally, the probes for human housekeeping
genes (GAPDH, PCBP1, EIF3L, POLR2A, EIF3A, TGOLN2, TCEB3, CDK12, and BTBD7)
were spiked in the probe set as internal controls for studying viral expression.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus isolation and culturing was reported previously, which followed the
CDC guidelines and good practice in laboratory health and safety requirement. Experiments were
performed with approvals of W96-027B framework. Therefore, a SARS-CoV-2 virus strain
(20SF014) was cultured in Vero-E6 cell, and RNA preparation performed using the QIAamp Viral
RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The cell culture media was collected and tested for
viral RNA using the RT-PCR amplicons of partial ORF1ab with Ct value 36, and N gene regions
with Ct value 33, respectively.
We divided the total RNA sample into six samples (with following slightly different
experimental conditions) (Table 1). Control is RNase free water. Six samples were
reverse-transcribed into cDNA, followed by the second-strand synthesis. Utilization of the
synthetic double-stranded DNA, six DNA libraries were constructed through DNA fragmentation,
end-repair, adaptor-ligation, and PCR amplification. Subsequently, library hybridization capture
was performed by using the SARS-CoV-2 enrichment probe set. The enriched libraries were
qualified with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit and equivalent
double-stranded DNA libraries were pooled and transformed into a single-stranded circular DNA
library through DNA-denaturation and circularisation. DNA nanoballs were generated from
single-stranded circular DNA by rolling circle amplification, then qualified with Qubit 2.0 and
loaded onto the flow cell and sequenced with PE100 on the MGI-2000 platform (MGI, Shenzhen,
China). Detailed experimental protocol in the Chinese and English version is presented in the
Supplementary Data 1.
The cutadapt (version 2.7) and trimmonmatic (version 0.38) software was used for clipping
adaptors and trimming low-quality reads. After removing adaptor, low-quality, and
low-complexity reads, high-quality reads were first filtered against the human reference genome
(hg 38) using Burrows-Wheeler Alignment (MEM). The remaining non-human reads were then
realigned
to
the
SARS-COV-2
reference
(MN908947.3,
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947) using bowtie2 (version 2.3.4.1) and filtered
reads according to mapping quality (-q 30) by samtools (version 1.10). The variant was called by
samtools and varscan (version 2.3.9, parameter: --strand-filter 0 --min-avg-qual 30 --min-reads2
15 --min-coverage 15). Finally, the sample consensus sequence was created by samtools and
bcftools (version 1.9) according to the variants called above.
The results illustrated in Table 6, for library 1-6, 4,797,881-199,421,414 unique reads were
obtained. Among them, 4,412,665-192,545,532 reads were mapped to SARS-CoV-2 reference
sequence (MN908947.3). The fraction of SARS-CoV-2 endogenous DNA from these enrichment
libraries were found to be between 90.07% and 96.58%, demonstrating that the numbers of
mapped reads to SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence significantly increased, compared to
metagenomic sequencing technology, following SARS-CoV-2 probe enrichment. The library
complexity is evaluated by Cluster Factor, which is defined by “the number of raw reads divided

by the number of reads after removing duplicates”. In our six enrichment libraries, the Cluster
Factor is about 1.1. The closer to 1, the better the library construction is. Notably, when adding the
PCR cycle numbers of library amplification from 15 to 17, the library quality gets better.
Collectively, merging the data from six enrichment libraries, a total of 371,981,580 reads were
obtained, among which 358,112,573 reads were mapped to SARS-CoV-2 reference. Using these
unique SARS-CoV-2 fragments, we reconstructed six SARS-CoV-2 genomes (mean depth being
186,869× and minimum coverage 13,816×). Only the merged sequence (coverage 1,121,217×)
was used for further analysis. There are five variants called from merged data, including one
homozygous variant at SNP (T23569C), and four heterozygotic variants (three SNPs: C4534T,
A5522T, C23525T, and one deletion: CT16779C). The phenomenon of heterozygosity had also
been reported in previous studies [6,10], but we propose that this heterogeneity could be caused by
the mutations that occur during viral cultivation or the infection by multi-strain of coronavirus.
We collected the variations information (gff3 files) of hig-quality samples from The Genome
Variation Map (GVM) (ftp://download.big.ac.cn/GVM/Coronavirus/gff3/) (on 2020/03/22).
According to the quality criteria for 2019-nCoV delivered by National Genomics Data Center
(2019nCoVR, https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov) (Zhao, 2020), we enrolled the 597 samples with 45
SNVs at first and second levels (with MAF>0.01 and no dense variation regions, see
https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov/variation/annotation) in the following analysis. The information of raw
variations in gff3 file is recoded into binary format as an input file for Network analysis (Network
version 5, www.fluxus-engineering.com) (Supplementary Table S1). Five clades could be
identified and labelled, corresponding to the Full genome tree delivered by GISAID (see Figure 1).
Except for three main larger clades [named: S:ORF8-L84S (defined by SNP: 28144), G: S-D614G
(SNP: 23403), V:NS3-G251V(SNP: 26144)], we defined a new clade I: orf1ab-V378I (segregating
at position 1397). The haplotype of the reference genome (MN908947) is in the centre clade
(yellow circle), and our sample studied here is also in this clade with only one homozygous

→

variant at position 23569 (T C).
In Figure 2, we found two peaks in genome sequencing depths, one covering the 5’UTR
region (MN908947.3:1-256) and another covering the N region (MN908947.3:28274-29533),
which may be associated with the high expression in these two regions during replication of
coronavirus [11-12]. For high sequencing depths in 5’UTR region, a reasonable explanation is that
5'UTRs before ORF1a is necessary for the discontinuous synthesis of sub genomic RNAs in the
beta coronaviruses and contains the cis-acting sequences necessary for viral replication [11].
Clinically, N gene RT-PCR assay was found to be more sensitive than other genes in SARS-CoV-2
detection, which is consistent with our finding of high sequencing depths in N region. This can be
explained as the structural composition of coronavirus, also the difference in expression regulation
in the host cells regarding sub genomic mRNA [12-14]
In the current study, we, based on the available SARS-CoV-2 virus sequences, designed a set
of SARS-CoV-2 enrichment probes. We made six enrichment libraries from one cultured
SARS-CoV-2 virus strain to test the enrichment effects and sequenced them on MGI-2000
platform. Overall, the SARS-CoV-2 enrichment probe set-up described in this study showed
significance in SARS-CoV-2-specific enrichment. This high specific probe rate with RNA
carrier-free approach can function as a useful tool for the SARS-CoV-2 research community,
especially in detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in low amounts and monitoring the virus evolution
