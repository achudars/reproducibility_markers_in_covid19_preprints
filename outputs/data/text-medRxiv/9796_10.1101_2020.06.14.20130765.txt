Abstract
Background

Little is known about the risk factors for critical-ill events (intensive

care, invasive ventilation, or death) in patients with COVID-19.

Methods

Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the Wuhan

Leishenshan Hospital from February 13 to March 14 was retrospectively analyzed.

Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values at baseline, comorbidities,

treatments and clinical outcomes were extracted from electronic medical records

and compared between patients with and without critical-ill events. The least

absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate logistic

regression models were developed to explore the risk factors for critical-ill events. A

risk nomogram was established to predict the probability for the critical-ill events.

Survival analysis of patients with critical-ill events was performed by the

Kaplan-Meier method.

Results

463 COVID-19 patients were included in this study, of whom 397 were

non-critically ill and 66 were critically ill (all from the intensive care unit). The LASSO

regression identified four variables (hypersensitive cardiac troponin I, blood urea

nitrogen , haemoglobin, and interleukin-6) contributing to the critical-ill events.

Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital critical-ill events

associated with hypersensitive cTnI greater than 0.04 ng/mL (OR 20.98,95% CI

3.51-125.31), blood urea nitrogen greater than 7.6 mmol/L (OR 5.22, 95% CI

1.52-17.81, decreased haemoglobin (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.04-1.10), and higher

interleukin-6 (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.08) on admission.

Conclusions

Hypersensitive cTnI greater than 0.04 ng/mL, blood urea nitrogen

greater than 7.6 mmol/L, decreased haemoglobin, and high IL-6 were risk factors of

critical-ill events in patients with COVID-19.

Introduction
An ongoing outbreak of the novel corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia

associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), started in

December, 2019, in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly around the world [1]. As of

June 4, 2020, the total number of patients has risen sharply to 6.6 million around the

world, with more than 380,000 deceased.

The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 pneumonia ranges from mild to critically ill

cases. It is well established that patients with mild disease have fever along with

respiratory signs and symptoms, such as dry cough [2]. Sepsis, respiratory failure,

acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and septic shock are commonly

observed in critically ill patients [3]. Epidemiological features, clinical presentation,

and clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 have been well documented [4-7].

However, risk factors for critical-ill events (intensive care, invasive ventilation, or

death) has not yet been well delineated. In this retrospective cohort study, we

identified the risk factors associated with the critical-ill events among patients with

confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to Wuhan Leishenshan

Hospital. In addition, a prediction model of probability for the critical-ill events was

established.

Methods
Study design and participants
This retrospective cohort study included two cohorts (non-critically ill and critically ill)

of adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with COVID-19 from Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital.

All patients who received intensive care or died or were discharged between

February 13 and March 14, 2020, were included in this study. For patients who were

alive by March 14, 2020, their living status was followed up and confirmed on March

28, 2020. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Commission of Zhongnan

Hospital of Wuhan University.

Data collection
Demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were extracted from

electronic medical records using a standardised data collection form. All data were

checked by two physicians (SY, LM) and a third researcher (RC) adjudicated any

difference in interpretation between the two primary reviewers.

Laboratory procedures
Methods for laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described

elsewhere [2]. Routine blood examinations were complete blood count, coagulation

profile, serum biochemical tests (including renal and liver function, and electrolytes),

myocardial enzymes, interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein and procalcitonin.

Definitions
Critically ill patients were defined as those admitted to the ICU who required

mechanical ventilation or had a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of at least 60% or

more [8]. Fever was defined as axillary temperature of at least 37.3°C. ARDS was

diagnosed according to the Berlin Definition [9]. Sepsis and septic shock were

defined according to the 2016 Third International Consensus Definition for Sepsis

and Septic Shock [10]. Acute cardiac injury was diagnosed if serum level of high

sensitivity cardiac troponin I (cTnI) exceeded upper reference limit set by Wuhan

Leishenshan Hospital, or if new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography

and echocardiography. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was diagnosed according to the

Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines [11].

Acute liver injury was defined as elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or

aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and treatment was given determined by the

treating physician. Hypoproteinaemia was defined as blood albumin of less than 40

g/L set by Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital. The disease severity status of COVID-19 was

defined according to the Chinese management guideline for COVID-19 (version 7.0)

[12].

Statistical analysis
Continuous and categorical variables were presented as median (IQR) and n (%),

respectively. Mann-Whitney U test, χ² test, or Fisher’s exact test were utilized to

compare differences between patients with and without critical-ill events where

appropriate. To explore the risk factors associated with critical-ill events (intensive

care, invasive ventilation, or death), LASSO and binary logistic regression models

were used. The LASSO regression is a machine learning method that suitable for the

reduction of high-dimensional data and collinearity. The LASSO regression model

analysis was performed using the

glmnet package of R. The receiver operating

characteristic (ROC) with area under the curve (AUC) was used to determine

accuracy of the LASSO. The prediction model that incorporated the independent risk

factors was developed and presented as the nomogram. Nomogram was obtained

using the

rms and regplot packages of R. We used a Kaplan-Meier plot for survival

data. Tests were two-sided with significance set at α less than 0.05. The Stata/SE

15.1 software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) and R software 3.5.1 were

applied for all analyses.

Results
463 adult patients hospitalised in Wuhan Leishenshan Hospital with

laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. 397 were non-critically

ill and 66 were critically ill. 27 patients died during hospitalisation (all from the ICU)

at 35 days. The median age of the 463 patients was 60.0 years (IQR 50.0-69.0) (Table

1). Hypertension was the most common comorbidity, followed by diabetes, and

cardiovascular disease (Table 1). The most common symptoms on admission were

dry cough and fatigue, followed by chest tightness, shortness of breath, myalgia, and

fever (Table 1). Lymphocytopenia occurred in 36.1% (131/463) patients. Moderate to

severe anemia occurred in 13.4 % (63/463) patients. The median time from illness

onset to hospital admission was 10.0 days (IQR 5.0-17.0) and the median time from

admission to death or discharge was 19.0 days (IQR 13.0-37.0) (Table 1).

Patients who were non-critically ill received much more antiviral treatment

(83.9%

vs 45.5%) and Traditional Chinese medicine (84.4% vs 9.1%) than critically ill

patients, whereas the critically ill patients received much more antibiotics,

systematic corticosteroids, human serum albumin, renal replacement therapy, and

convalescent plasma transfusion than non-critically ill patients (Table 2). 36 critically

ill patients in ICU required invasive mechanical ventilation, of whom 20 (55.6%) died.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was used in four critically ill patients

and two survived. Among critically ill patients, respiratory failure was the most

frequently observed life- threatening complication, followed by acute cardiac injury,

acute kidney injury, ARDS, and septic shock (Table 2).

Previous studies have shown male, older age, Sequential Organ Failure

Assessment (SOFA) score, d-dimer, and the comorbidities such as hypertension,

diabetes, and cardiovascular disease were associated with higher odds of critical

events (intensive care or death)[3, 13-15]. In LASSO regression, we divided the full

dataset (n=463, 66 with critical-ill events and 397 without) in a 7:3 ratio into training

set (n=324) and validation set (n=139). A total of 19 variables (age, gender,

comorbidities and laboratory data) were inputted and four variables (haemoglobin,

criteria. The mean square error (MSE) was plotted verse Log (λ). Red dots represent average MSE for

each model with a given λ, and vertical bars through the red dots show the upper and lower values of

the MSE. The dotted vertical lines represent the optimal values of λ. When the optimal λ value of

indicating that this feature selection model was of goodness of fit.

Based on the LASSO feature selection, the above four variables were included in

the binary logistic regression, and we found that hypersensitive cTnI greater than

0.04 ng/mL (OR 20.98, 95% CI 3.51-135.31;

(OR 5.22, 95% CI 1.52-17.81;

1.04-1.10, per 1 unit decrease (g/L);

p<0.0001), and higher interleukin (IL)-6 (OR 1.05,

95%CI 1.02-1.08, per 1 unit increase (pg/ml);

p= 0.001) at admission were

significantly associated with increased risk of critical-ill events (Table 3). When

adjusting for other confounders (CURB-65 score was excluded because itself

included BUN), our model was validated as robust, because the four variables

(haemoglobin, cTnI, BUN, and IL-6) were again selected as the risk factors

contributing to the critical-ill events (see Supplementary Figure 2).

Based on the selected risk factors, we established a risk model for evaluating the

development of critical-ill events via nomogram (see Supplementary Figure 3).

Calibration was employed with bootstrapping to decrease the bias of over-fitting in

both training set and validation set. The internal-bootstrapped calibration plots for

the probability of critical-ill events in training set and validation set showed an

optimal agreement between prediction by nomogram (see Supplementary Figure 4).

For the death outcome, among 66 critically ill patients with COVID-19, 27 (40.9%)

patients had died at 35 days, and the median duration from ICU admission to death

was 14.5 (IQR 7.3-21.8) days (Figure 2). We further performed survival analyses

stratified by cTnI, BUN, haemoglobin, and IL-6. High levels of cTnI, BUN, IL-6, and

decreased level of haemoglobin were associated with poor survival probability (see

Supplementary Figure 5).

with increasing odds of in-hospital critical-ill events. Although the risk factors for

mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 has been identified by a retrospective

cohort study [3], the authors did not include some important factors (eg. IL-6 and

procalcitonin) in multivariate logistic regression due to concern of the overfitting. In

our study, these four risk factors were verified by LASSO and multivariate logistic

regression models. Additionally, we developed and validated a prediction tool based

on the selected four variables to evaluate the risk for critical-ill events for patients

with COVID-19, which might aid in delivering timely treatment.

In COVID-19 patients with elevated inflammatory cytokines, postmortem

pathology has revealed tissue necrosis and interstitial macrophage and monocyte

infiltrations in the lung, heart and gastrointestinal mucosa [16]. In addition,

exhausted lymphocytes with hyperactivated proinflammatory T cells [16] and

decreased regulatory T cells [17] is commonly seen in critically ill patients, suggesting

dysregulated immune responses. Among the excessive cytokines produced by

activated macrophages, IL-6 is one of the key cytokines that closely related to the

cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which may play a major role in the pathology of

COVID-19. Elevated IL-6 levels were observed in patients with SARS coronavirus

(SARS-CoV, a close counterpart of SARS-CoV-2) and were correlated with disease

severity [18]. However, the elevated IL-6 levels were also observed in COVID-19 [2, 5,

19, 20] and might serve as a predictive biomarker for disease severity [21, 22]. In

addition, maximal interleukin-6 levels (>80 pg/ml) before intubation showed the

strongest association with the need of mechanical ventilation [23]. A prospective

study regarding the tocilizumab (a monoclonal antibody that targets the interleukin

6 receptor) for the treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia with

hyperinflammatory syndrome and acute respiratory failure showed significant

clinical improvement [24]. In our study, IL-6 levels in critically ill patients were far

more higher than that observed in non-critically ill patients. Extreme high IL-6 levels

(>5,000 ng/mL) were found in two critically ill patients who were on ECMO and died

due to CRS, coagulopathy, and respiratory failure.

Decline of hemoglobin was observed in 51% of 99 patients with SARS-CoV-2

infection reported by Wuhan Jin Yin-tan Hospital [5]. In the study of 1099 patients

with COVID-19, the hemoglobin level of patients who reached composite endpoint

(admission to ICU, requirement of invasive ventilation, and death) was lower than in

those who did not (125.0 g/L (IQR 105.0-140.0)

vs 134.0 g/L (120.0-148.0)) [25].

Inflammatory changes caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection might interfere with

erythropoiesis, resulting in a decrease in hemoglobin. The low incidence of moderate

or severe anemia in COVID-19 may attribute to the long life span of erythrocyte and

the compensatory proliferation of erythrocyte induced by pneumonia associated

hypoxia. In our study, among 66 critically ill patients, 41 (62.1%) had moderate to

severe anemia (hemoglobin<90 g/L), 24 (36.4%) patients’ peripheral oxygen

saturation was less than 93% without inhaling oxygen, and 36 (54.5%) patients

received invasive mechanical ventilation. We speculated that, in critically ill

circumstances, excessive inflammation could suppress the erythropoiesis, thereby

hindering proliferation of erythrocyte induced by pneumonia associated hypoxia.

Thus, the reduced hemoglobin levels might be an indicator of disease progression,

and it would be more worthy of clinical attention.

AKI occurs frequently among patients with COVID-19. It occurs early and in

temporal association with respiratory failure and is associated with a poor prognosis.

Early reports from China found the rate of AKI in COVID-19 patients to range widely

from 0.5-29% [2-6, 14]. Data from the New York hospital revealed that AKI

developed in 36.6% (1,993/5,449) patients admitted with COVID-19 [26]. However,

in critically ill or decreased patients, the incidence of AKI was much higher, up to

37.5-50% [3, 4]. In our study, 19 (28.8%) critically ill patients developed AKI and 9

(13.6%) patients received renal replacement therapy. BUN, the main component of

azotemia caused by the AKI, has been listed as a risk factor associated with

developing critical illness [27, 28]. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that

elevated baseline BUN was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death (hazard

ratio [HR] 3.97, 95%CI 2.57-6.14) [29].

Previous evidence substantiates the presence of acute cardiac injury in patients

with COVID-19, which mainly manifested as an increase in high sensitivity cTnI levels

(>0.028 ng/mL) [2]. However, acute cardiac injury might result in worsening

arrhythmia, myocardial infarction or even cardiac arrest. It is notable that a

observational study on 138 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 found that 7.2% of

patients developed acute cardiac injury, and patients who received care in the ICU

were more likely to have cardiac injury (22.2%) than non-ICU patients [6].

Consistently, our study found 39.4% of critically ill patients with cardiac injury. A

large cohort study showed that patients with cardiac injury suffered more

complications (including ARDS, AKI, electrolyte disturbances, hypoproteinemia, and

coagulation disorders) and had higher mortality than those without cardiac injury

(HR 3.41, 95%CI 1.62-7.16) [30]. The mechanism of acute myocardial injury might be

related to the SARS-CoV-2 direct attack and the CRS. It is well established that

SARS-CoV-2 binds with high affinity to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2

(ACE2) which is used as an entry receptor to invade target cells [31]. ACE2 is widely

expressed in both lungs and cardiovascular system [32] and, therefore, ACE2-related

signalling pathways might play a role in heart injury. Other proposed mechanisms of

myocardial injury include a CRS triggered by an imbalanced response by type 1 and

type 2 T helper cells [33], and hypoxaemia caused by COVID-19 pneumonia, resulting

in damage to myocardial cells.

Our study has certain strengths. To our knowledge, this is by far the largest

respective cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with a focus on risk factors

for the critical-ill events. In order to increase the reliability of the results, the LASSO

with training and validation settings was utilized. Moreover, we constructed a risk

nomogram with good calibration, which might help clinicians with early

identification of patients who will progress to critically ill COVID-19 and enable

better centralized management and early treatment of severe disease. However,

some limitations existed in our study. First, due to the retrospective nature of the

study, not all laboratory tests (including serum ferritin, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α

and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) were done in all patients, especially in

non-critically ill patients. Thus, their roles might be underestimated in predicting

critical-ill events. Second, lack of effective antiviral drugs and late transfer from other

community hospitals might have contributed to the development of critical-ill events

in some patients, which may bias our results. Third, regarding the survival analyses,

the

p values for cTnI, haemoglobin, and IL-6 did not reach the statistical significance

might due to inadequate follow-up and small samples. Further prospective study

with large sample is warranted.

In summary, our data suggested that hypersensitive cTnI greater than 0.04

ng/mL, BUN greater than 7.6 mmol/L, decreased haemoglobin, and high IL-6 were

risk factors of critical-ill events in patients with COVID-19.
