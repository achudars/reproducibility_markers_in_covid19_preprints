ABSTRACT
The well-recognized genome editing ability of the CRISPR-Cas system has triggered significant advances
in CRISPR diagnostics. This has prompted an interest in developing new biosensing applications for nucleic
acid detection. Recently, such applications have been engineered for detection of SARS-CoV-2. Increased
demand for testing and consumables of RT-qPCR assays has led to the use of alternate testing options in
some cases. Here we evaluate the accuracy and performance of a novel fluorescence based assay that
received EUA authorization from the FDA for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. The Specific
High-Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing (SHERLOCK) technology forms the basis of the
Sherlock CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit using the CRISPR-Cas13a system. Our experimental strategy included
selection of COVID-19 patient samples from previously validated RT-qPCR assays. Positive samples were
selected based on a broad range of cycle thresholds. A total of 50 COVID-19 patient samples were correctly
diagnosed with 100% accuracy (relative fluorescence ratios: N gene 95% CI 23.2-36.3, ORF1ab gene 95%
CI 27.6- 45.4). All controls, including RNase P, showed expected findings. Overall ratios were robustly
distinct between positive and negative cases relative to the pre-established 5-fold change in fluorescence
read output. We have evaluated the accuracy of detecting conserved targets of SARS-CoV-2 across a range
of viral loads using the SHERLOCK CRISPR collateral detection reaction in a clinical setting. These
findings demonstrate encouraging results, especially at a time when COVID-19 clinical diagnosis is in high
demand; often with limited resources. This approach highlights new thinking in infectious disease

Introduction
The novel infectious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) emerged in
Wuhan, China in late 2019 and has since become a global pandemic1. From reports of the initial set of
infected patients2–4, emerging evidence continues to reflect that some individuals experienced severe
conditions requiring intensive care and hospitalization with a significant number succumbing to the virus.
In the majority of patients, the clinical course typically ranged from marked fever, myalgia, pneumonia to
dyspnea and respiratory distress2–4. As we learned more about the disease course, it became apparent that
most individuals present with mild symptoms, but more importantly, asymptomatic or low-level infected
individuals can become carriers who further potentiate the spread of the COVID-19 disease 5,6.
Mitigating the spread of the virus clearly involves accurate, efficient and increased testing with a
simultaneous public health surveillance effort. The gold standard test uses quantitative reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach. RT-PCR based approaches for SARS-CoV-2 typically
require detection of multiple targets. For this, several pre-requisites need to be in place such as having
hydrolysis sequence-specific probes that need to be labeled with a distinct fluorescent dye and an appropriate
quencher moiety. The emission maxima of the dyes must not overlap with each other and reactions need to
be carried out on an appropriate real-time cycler that supports multiplex analysis. Further, for downstream
quantification, standard curves are necessary for analysis and the efficiency of the method may vary between
runs and reactions. Taken together, although PCR is very effective in optimized scenarios, these prerequisites can limit the use of PCR testing in locations outside central laboratories. Therefore, frequent,
rapid, and portable testing is necessary; especially with the already limited resources for RT-PCR based
reagents and consumables. This has prompted new strategies for viral RNA detection of SARS-CoV-2.
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) can complement RT-PCR testing and
provide comparable sensitivity and high specificity. This approach uses guide RNA enzymes from the Cas

family (i.e. Cas12, Cas13) that are engineered with a programmable spacer sequence and nucleotide binding
domains that can cleave the nucleic acid target of interest7,8.
In the current study, we employ the Specific High Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing
(SHERLOCK) technology that was initially described as a means to rapidly detect nuclei acids in human
health applications. In particular, this was applied to instances where different strains of the Zika and
Dengue viruses as well as other pathogenic bacteria needed to be distinguished 9,10 It has since been used to
identify mutations in cell-free tumor DNA in the background of genomic DNA and has broad applications
in genotyping human DNA9. The current approach naturally leverages SHERLOCK as a CRISPR-based
diagnostic platform to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. The main principal behind SHERLOCK is that in
the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA , a Cas13 enzyme complexed with a virus targeting RNA will be
activated and will cleave the viral RNA resulting in a collateral RNase activity7,11.
The sensitivity of the assay to detect synthetic SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was determined by Sherlock
Biosciences as part of its emergency use authorization (EUA) and was successfully submitted to the FDA
(https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/sars-cov-2-referencepanel-comparative-data). Each viral RNA target (N, O) was tested in triplicate over a range of 10 dilutions.
The estimated limit of detection for the N and O target was determined to be 0.9 and 4.5 copies/µL of viral
transport media (VTM). The analytical sensitivity was confirmed by testing at 1.5x the estimated limit of
detection, which was determined to be 6.75 copies/µL of VTM from 19 out of 20 samples with a 95%
detection rate (https://www.fda.gov/media/137747/download). Here we extend this work and present a
clinical evaluation of the SHERLOCK approach in a CLIA-certified molecular diagnostics laboratory
performing high complexity testing for detection of SARS-CoV-2.

Results
Clinical specimen testing
For our SHERLOCK experimental design, we utilized anonymized clinical patient samples
previously tested using the SARS-CoV-2 CDC assay on the Applied Biosystems 7500Fast Dx instrument
implemented near the start of the pandemic by our molecular laboratory

12

. These patient sample results

were also subsequently confirmed using orthogonal technologies from Abbott (m2000 real-time system)
and ChromaCode (HDPCR™ SARS-CoV-2 real-time PCR assay). Samples within three ranges of cycle
threshold (Ct) values (low positive: 30-36; mid positive: 15-30; high positive: 5-15) were included in the
analysis where the Ct value is inversely proportional to the viral copy number. A total of 33 positive (SARSCoV-2 detected) and 17 negative samples were analyzed (n = 50 total) using the SHERLOCK Cas13
technology.
SHERLOCK assay performance
The SHERLOCK assay correctly confirmed all 50 previous clinical sample results with 100%
sensitivity (Table 1, Figure 1) and 100% positive-negative predicative agreement (Table 2). A series of
pooled positive samples that were tested in triplicate also showed consistent results and reproducibility of
the assay. The raw signal output graph on the BioTek Gen5 software clearly demarcated a positive result
relative to a negative one with a marked increase in relative fluorescence (Figure 2). Ratios calculated from
the raw fluorescence values at t10min for test samples were nearly 45 to 55 fold higher for the Nucleocapsid
(“N”) and Open Reading Frame (ORF1ab, “O”) gene targets (ratios > 5) respectively for a positive Cas13
detection relative to a negative finding. This further suggests that the collateral cleavage activity of the
CRISPR complex is robust at differentiating infected from non-infected patients in our cohort with high
accuracy. All positive, negative and internal template controls, RNase P POP7 gene (“RP”), performed as
expected with normalized fluorescence ratios well below a 3-fold increase cut-off (Table 1).

Potential for scale-up
In terms of sample set-up and processing, we have currently observed optimal detection in a 384
well plate system, given the volumes of the Cas13 detection reaction used as part of the experimental design.
This small diameter of the sample vessels in which the CRISPR reactions commence maximally retains
fluorescence and promotes favorable molecular collisions during the SHERLOCK step. However,
increasing the Cas detection volume may allow for comparable detection using a 96-well format. We can
accommodate approximately 200 samples on one plate if every other well in a 384-well column
configuration is omitted to pre-emptively minimize any risk for contamination. On a Hamilton STAR
system or similar 13, both a 384 and a 96 probe head with rocket tips can potentially process up to 5 plates
for an output of approximately 1000 samples in an eight-hour shift.

Discussion
We have successfully demonstrated the diagnostic potential of SHERLOCK CRISPR-Cas13
enzymology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 50 previously tested patient samples. In this proof of
principal study, all samples subjected to this approach were in keeping with results reported for detecting
SARS-CoV-2. A major advantage of CRISPR based diagnostics is that it is highly specific, because the
Cas13a RNase remains dormant until it binds to its specific programmed RNA target

14

. In addition, this

assay has the potential to be scaled up for higher throughput testing capacity.
CRISPR-Cas13 as well as Cas12 have also shown efficacy in detecting other viral diseases besides
COVID-19 15. Similarly, SHERLOCK methods have exploited CRISPR-mediated detection of SARS-CoV2 with comparable sensitivity to RT-PCR16. These tests, and earlier versions of this technology, have rapidly
detected nuclei acids in human health applications10. The SHERLOCK approach, in particular, has been
compatible not only with fluorescence read outputs but also lateral-flow assays10,16. Moreover, flexibility
in constructing crRNAs and other RNA sequences continue to push the detection limit and turnaround time

for CRISPR diagnostics. Of note, a limit of detection of 12 copies/µL and a 45 minute run time has been
reported for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection using the Cas12 system17. This assay, termed DETECTR was
given EUA status, and examines the N2 portion of the N gene. The Sherlock CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit
corroborates these findings and expands the repertoire of viral genomic analyses to the Cas13 CRISPR-Cas
effector family using fluorescence-based detection. By contrast to the DETECTR assay, the SHERLOCK
approach used in the current study examined two SARS-CoV-2 gene targets (N and ORF1ab). Overall
Sherlock’s CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit exhibited a limit of detection down to 6.75 copies/µL, as mentioned
above, and had an approximate process time of 50 minutes.
As advances in COVID-19 diagnostics emerge, CRISPR testing, because of its many advantages,
will be at the forefront. 11,14. This is further underscored by the 2020 Nobel prize recently awarded towards
this disruptive technology that has made scientific history18,19.

In the context of the current work,

SHERLOCK technology is also poised to rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA from other sample matrices.
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated CRISPR diagnostics and we are only at the beginning of
this revolution. One of the unique features of the SHERLOCK approach applied here is that viral RNA can
be directly detected with high accuracy and the CRISPR-Cas13 enzyme is rapidly programmable to detect
any RNA based target. From a public health and governance perspective, the development of fast, accurate
and a portable point of care diagnostic tests is critical for imminent infectious diseases outbreaks and
surveillance20,21. A test such as the one deployed in our clinical setting will be indispensable in the current
pandemic as it does not require large equipment and obviates the need for in-demand PCR consumables.

Methods
Overview of experimental protocol
The Sherlock CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit has two main steps and was completed in under 2 hours
from a brief reverse transcriptase loop-mediated amplification (RT-LAMP)22 step to direct CRISPR

detection of the RNA targets in 10 minutes. In the first step, SARS-CoV-2 RNA is reverse transcribed to
DNA and the DNA is amplified by a strand displacing DNA polymerase. The second step initiates
transcription of the DNA and activates collateral cleavage activity of CRISPR complex programmed to
the target RNA sequence (i.e. programmable crRNA)11. As Cas13 cleaves the reporter RNA molecules,
separating the two ends, a fluorescent signal is detected on a standard plate reader (Figure 3). SHERLOCK
technology was designed to detect fragments of the N and the O genes of SARS-CoV-2. A third target, the
human RP gene, acted as an internal extraction control. Of note, and unlike most molecular assays,
SHERLOCK identifies SARS-CoV-2 RNA rather than cDNA providing increased target specificity. In
the current experimental protocol, upper respiratory specimens mainly from nasopharyngeal swabs were
tested.

Specimen collection and preparation
All sample collection and preparation steps were performed in accordance with CDC interim
guidelines

(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/).

The

extraction

of

RNA

from

nasopharyngeal swabs placed into VTM was carried out using the QIAGEN EZ1 virus mini v 2.0 kit on
the EZ1 advanced XL instrument. Samples were eluted in a final volume of 120µL. A total of 8 µL of the
extracted RNA was used in a given CRISPR reaction and the remaining stored in aliquots at -80oC for
subsequent use. The RT-LAMP master mix (IDT, catalog # 10006968) was prepared separately with
primer pairs (10x concentrate) targeting the N, O, and the RP gene as an internal quality control step. A
no template or NTC control along with a SARS-CoV-2 positive control (BEI; Catalog # NR-52285) was
also included in final reaction volumes of 20µL, the latter diluted to a stock concentration of 4800
copies/µL.

CRISPR Cas preparation and detection

The Cas master mix reaction with the “N” “O” and “RP” specific guide RNAs (crRNA), reporter
reagent, and LwaCas13a enzyme was prepared according to manufacturer’s instructions (IDT, Sherlock™
CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit). This mixture was distributed into separate reaction strip tubes of 20 µL
aliquots. To each respective 20 µL Cas13 mix, 5 uL of RT-LAMP reaction containing the test sample and
appropriate controls was added and the reaction mixture vortexed for ~10 seconds. A final volume of 20
µL of the mixture was transferred, based on a pre-designated layout indicating the spot location of each
sample, to a 384-well flat low-volume clear bottom assay plate (Corning, catalog # 3540). This step was
performed in an air clean system to avoid cross-contaminants. The plate was protected with a microamp
optical adhesive film (Applied Biosystems, catalog # 4311971), prior to loading onto a pre-warmed
multimode plate reader (BioTek Synergy NEO2). All steps was performed in a unidirectional workflow.

Data processing and analysis
The specific plate reader configuration settings for initiating the analysis are provided in Figure 4.
Following the 10 minute sample analysis protocol, raw fluorescence data from each well of the assay plate
was transferred into an excel document. The raw data were then normalized by dividing target reaction
fluorescence accumulated at time point 10 minutes (t10 min) of the test sample to that of the NTC reaction,
also measured at the same time point interval. This generated a quantitative result in the form of a ratio.
Briefly a result was considered “detected” if a given SARS-CoV-2 target reaction produced a fluorescence
ratio that was greater than or equal to a 5-fold increase in florescence measured at 10 minutes for the test
sample over the corresponding NTC reaction control. And if this ratio calculated less than a 5-fold increase
in reaction fluorescence, the result was considered as “not detected” for SARS-CoV-2. Additional specifics
to the ratio calculation and interpretative outputs are tabulated in Table 3.

Figure 1

Reaction fluorescence ratios across a range of SARS-CoV-2 samples detected with the SHERLOCK
CRISPR-Cas13 system. The Y axis depicts the relative fluorescence units (RFU) calculated from the
raw fluorescence detected for each sample (X-axis) normalized to the no template control. The final values
spanning over a 10-minute interval were used in these calculations. In scenarios where RFU from the N or
ORF1ab SARS-CoV-2 gene target is not detected, the RNAseP extraction control was consistently present
(ratio > 5) in each clinical sample. Negative specimens are marked by an absence of a discernable green
or blue bar (RFU ratio < 5), where as a positive specimen revealed a prominent signal well above a RFU
ratio of 5.

Table 2. Summary of RT-qPCR results compared to Sherlock SARS-CoV-2 kit detecting positive and
negative nasopharyngeal clinical samples (n =50). No false positive or negative results were noted and the
sensitivity/specificity along with positive-negative predicative value was at 100% (N gene: 95% CI 23.2 to
36.3; ORF1ab gene: 95% CI 27.6 to 45.4).

Figure 2

Raw fluorescence (Y-axis) shown as a function of time (X-axis in minutes) from representative
samples processed on a standard multimode plate reader. (a) N – gene target not detected in this clinical
specimen whereas (b) a prominent spike in fluorescence is noted from a separate clinical sample in which
the N – gene target is robustly detected. A similar pattern is shown in the bottom two panels where the
ORF1ab target is not detected (panel c) versus detected (panel d). Of note, the Y-axis values are an order
of magnitude higher between the two scenarios (e.g. detected/not detected) due to the collateral activity of
the CRISPR Cas13 guide RNAs to cleave and release fluorescence in the presence of SARS-CoV-2.

Figure 3

Basic workflow of CRISPR-Cas13 detection of SARS-CoV-2 as it relates to pre-processing,
analytical and post-analytical steps. (a) Upon collection of nasopharyngeal swab and nucleic acid
extraction, the purified RNA is subjected to an (b) isothermal amplification (green depicts the reverse
transcriptase enzyme). (c) The amplified target upon being bound by the Cas13 enzyme (yellow), with its
guide RNA (purple-red) cleaves the reporter (blue). A standard output generated on a plate reader is shown
form which data export into an excel format is performed. All sequence of events are shown in succession
left to right in panels a-c.

Table 3. List of ratio combinations and interpretation for reporting SARS-CoV-2 results on clinical
samples. Three targets are listed, including the RNAse P POP7 gene which serves as a control for the
extraction of the clinical sample in the absence of a positive SARS-CoV-2 result. Note the experiment
should also be considered invalid if the NTC (not shown in table) shows a ratio >5.
