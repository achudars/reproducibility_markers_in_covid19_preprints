Abstract

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected front line health care workers
(HCW) and first responders (FR). The infection risk from SARS CoV-2, the high mortality of
hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the duration of the pandemic have created sustained and
often traumatic stressors affecting HCW and FR.
Objectives: To assess the relationship of COVID-19 stressor frequency scores to psychiatric
rating scale scores amongst HCW and FR. To determine if psychiatric rating scale scores
mediate stressor effects on perceived work function and likelihood of remaining in current
occupation.
Design: Observational, self-report in a convenience sample.
Participants: 118 HCW and FR caring for COVID-19 patients in the United States.
Main Measure: COVID-19 related stressor frequencies were assessed using a 17-item
questionnaire. Psychiatric symptoms were assessed with the PTSD Checklist 5 (PCL5), the
Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (for depression) (PHQ9), the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and
the General Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD7).
Key Results: Stressor frequency scores correlated significantly with PCL5 scores (R=.57, p<1e8), PHQ scores (R=.35, P<.001), ISI scores (R=.38, p<1e-4), and GAD7 scores (R=.39,
p<.001), likelihood of staying in current occupation (R=-.39,p<1e-4), and trouble doing usual
work (R=.33,p<.001). 51% of HCW and 44% of FR indicated decreased likelihood of staying in
their current occupation. PCL5 scores substantially mediated the association between stress
frequency scores and work function impairment.
Conclusions: These results direct attention to recognizing potentially treatable psychiatric
symptoms, particularly those of PTSD, in HCW and FR experiencing COVID-19 related

Introduction

The impact of prolonged physical and emotional stress on health care workers (HCW) and first
responders (FR) working during the Covid-19 pandemic has attracted significant attention in the
media and popular press1,2. These discussions have chronicled the impact of pandemic-related
occupational stressors on HCW/FR as individuals, and have also brought up the potential
significance for the healthcare system more broadly. These concerns are consistent with
previous research that has found the physical and emotional stressors among HCW/FR can be
associated with significant personal distress3–8 as well as decreased professional longevity and
poorer patient care9,10. There remain significant knowledge gaps, however, in understanding the
likely impact of working during the conditions experienced during the Covid-19 pandemic on
both the short and long term mental health of HCW/FR, and on professional functioning and
retention.

Significant attention has been paid to the direct effects of working during a pandemic on the
mental health of HCW. HCW and FR working during a pandemic are often exposed to multiple
types of acute and sustained stressors, including fear for their own safety and that of their
colleagues and family, repeated exposure to death and suffering, extended separations from
family, and prolonged periods of exhaustion and vigilance. Depending on the context, they may
also experience forms of moral injury11 related to their perception of systemic or community
support for their work, and the extent to which their contributions feel effective.

High rates of psychiatric symptoms in HCW working during the Covid-19 pandemic, including
symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD, are well documented3–8. Less

information is available regarding the specificity of these symptoms for those with specific
exposure to pandemic-related workload or risks, although the available evidence suggests that
exposure to pandemic stressors such as quarantine procedures, isolation from social support
systems, stigmatization, and risk of infection are associated with a higher incidence of
psychiatric symptoms6,7,12,13.

Far less is known about the potential for increased workplace attrition and impaired workplace
functioning due to COVID-19 related occupational stressors. An unpublished but publicly
released survey of clinicians carried out by the Larry A Green center and the Primary Care
Collaboration reported that 19% of survey respondents reported that clinicians in their practice
had retired early because of COVID-19 or were planning on it14, and a study of neurosurgeons
reported 20% of those surveyed experienced burnout attributed to COVID-19, and were less
likely to pursue their career again if given the choice15. A study of nurses in South Korea that
used a validated questionnaire to assess nurses’ intention to remain in their current career
found that those who had worked with COVID-19 patients or in a COVID-19 division reported
numerically lower intention to remain in their field than those who had not, but the results were
not statistically significant16. Little is known, however about the impact on HCW more broadly,
which aspects of pandemic-related occupational stress exposure or associated psychiatric
symptoms are associated with expected professional retention, or whether they are associated
with self-reported functional impairment.

Finally, first responders, such as police service members, firefighters, and emergency medical
technicians (EMTs) are exposed to many of the same pandemic-related stressors as hospitalor clinic-based HCW, in even less controlled environments, and with less information about the

risk of any given encounter. However, comparatively little information is available regarding the
impact of pandemic-related stressors on this population. A review of medical leave in New York
City firefighters and emergency medical services (EMS) workers during the early part of the
Covid-19 pandemic found increased use of medical leave, leading to decreased workforce
availability17. A survey of HCW and EMS workers in Italy during the Covid-19 pandemic found
that while both groups experienced high levels of distress, FR experienced greater anger and
regret, increased intrusiveness related to trauma, and a decreased perception of self-efficacy18.
However, little or no information is available addressing the exposure to pandemic-related
workload in first responders, nor the long-term mental health effects of frontline exposure in
these positions.

The existing literature leaves a number of important gaps that impede the ability of the health
care system to most effectively address the impact of pandemic-related stressors on its
workforce. First, the impact of pandemic related occupational stressors on self-reported
functional impairment and likelihood of leaving one’s field, both directly and via the emergence
of different types of psychiatric symptoms, is poorly understood. Additional information about
these relationships would allow improved targeting of interventions designed to protect HCW
and the health care system. Additionally, the focus on traditionally-defined HCW, to the
exclusion of FR groups, means little information is available about the needs of or risks to this
population.

In this study, we address these existing gaps in the literature in several ways. We assess rate of
depression, anxiety, insomnia and PTSD symptoms in both traditionally-defined HCW, as well
as in FR (including police, firefighters and EMTs) working during the Covid-19 pandemic. Using

an assessment of exposure to occupational stress designed specifically for health care workers
and first responders working during the Covid-19 pandemic, we assess the relationship of these
symptoms to pandemic-related occupational stressors. Finally, we assess self-reported
likelihood of leaving one’s current field and functional impairment when working, and the
relationship of these outcomes to both occupational exposure to Covid-19 related stressors, and
associated psychiatric symptoms.

Methods
1. Participants
Participants were a convenience sample recruited through targeted outreach and paid
advertising on Facebook. Survey responses were completed between September 15 and Nov
24, 2020. Participants were asked to self-attest that they were between the ages of 18-75; that
they were a physician (MD or DO), nurse or physician assistant (RN, LPN, ARNP, PA), or first
responder (EMT, firefighter, police service member); and that they were or expected to be
providing professional services affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. The study was approved by
the VA Puget Sound Health Care System Human Subjects Committee. Prior to enrollment, all
participants were provided with an electronic-format information statement that detailed the
purpose, risks, benefits, and alternatives to participation.

2. Procedures
All assessments were self-report, entered electronically using a FEDRamp-adherent
implementation of the commercial survey system Qualtrics. Surveys were implemented so as to
be responded to on either a computer or any smartphone with a web browser installed. To

encourage broad and representative participation despite the sensitive nature of the topic,
participants were not required to provide their legal name and were able to skip questions,
although a pop-up window notified them of unmarked items and asked if they wished to
complete the missing items or continue. Participants were required to provide an email at which
they could be contacted for follow up surveys (data not included in this publication). Participants
were not compensated for participation.

3. Measures
Demographic information collected included age and occupation. Symptoms of depression,
anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD were assessed using standard measures: the Patient Health
Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ9)19, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD7)20, the
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)21, and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL5)22, respectively.

Self-reported functional impairment was assessed using the two work-related items from the
PROMIS Short Form v2.0 Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities 8a measure23,
modified to focus on occupational work: “I have trouble doing all of my usual work” and “I have
trouble doing all of the work that is really important to me”, with answers on a 5-point Likert
scale. Likelihood of leaving one’s current profession was assessed with two items: “How likely
do you think it is that you will still be working in your current field in 5-10 years?”, with answer
choices “not at all likely”, ”a little likely”, “moderately likely”, and “highly likely”; and, “How have
your experiences providing care during the Covid-19 pandemic affected your interest,
willingness, or ability to continue working in your current field?” with answer choices
“significantly decreased”, “somewhat decreased”, “no change”, “somewhat increased”, and
“significantly increased”.

Exposure to Covid-19 related professional stressors was assessed using a Covid-19
occupational exposure assessment (CEA) survey designed for this study by a cooperative team
of physicians working in New York City hospitals and emergency rooms in March and April 2020
and researchers (see Supplemental Table 1). This instrument asks a series of 4 yes/no
questions about personal experiences of and loss due to covid-19 infection (scored as 0 or 1),
followed by 13 questions addressing the frequency of caring for individuals with Covid-19,
perceiving increased risk to self or family due to occupational exposure to Covid-19,
experiences of patient suffering related to the impacts of Covid-19, inadequate support or
protection related to Covid-19, and feeling unable to provide effective or adequate care due to
Covid-19. The 13 frequency questions were asked regarding either the past 2 weeks, if that
represented the period of most intense exposure, or retrospectively regarding the period of
greatest exposure, with responses “Not at all”, ”Several days”, “More than half the days”, and
“Nearly every day” (scored as 0-3). The scores were summed to provide a total Covid-19
Exposure Index (CEI).

4. Data analysis
Data analyzed using R and RStudio. Correlation coefficients were implemented using the
stat_cor function from the ggpubr package. Pearson’s R was used for variables representing
scale totals, while Spearman’s correlation coefficients were used when one or more of the
variables represented a single ordinal item. Mediation analyses were implemented using the
mediation package, with statistical significance assessed via bootstrapping using 10,000
simulations. Figures used ggplot2. Responses with missing data were excluded from analyses

using those data, but included where data was present for all analyzed measures. For all
analyses presented, CEI score was based on period of highest exposure.

Results
1. Participants:
A baseline questionnaire was completed by 118 participants, with 98% completing all insomnia
questions, 86% completing all PTSD questions, 90% completing the exposure questionnaire,
and 97% completing the occupation and demographics questions. 87 participants were health
care workers (42 physicians, 42 RN or LPN, 4 PA or ARNP; some respondents were in more
than one category), while 27 participants were first responders (12 police, 6 firefighters, 11
EMT). Age ranged from 24 to 61 years, with a mean ± standard deviation of 41±9.1.

2. Exposure to Covid-19 related occupational stressors
104 participants completed the covid-19 occupational exposure assessment (Table 1). Of these,
31% reported they had been ill with known or likely Covid-19 (27% of HCW and 44% of FR),
19% reported a close family member had been ill with known or likely Covid-19 (36% of FR),
12% reported the death of a family member or close colleague to Covid-19, and 30% indicated
they had medical condition which placed them at increased risk from Covid-19. Mean responses
to the 13 Likert scale items for the two weeks of highest exposure (total range per item: 0-3)
ranged from 0.79±1.05 to 2.19±0.95.

3. Impact on psychiatric symptoms

Symptoms of psychiatric disorders that are common after a traumatic stress were quantified
using the PCL5 (for PTSD), PHQ9 (for depression), GAD7 (for anxiety) and ISI (for insomnia).
26% of participants had a total PCL5 score of 31 or higher to indicate PTSD symptoms likely to
benefit from treatment; 60% had a total PHQ9 score above the standard threshold for at least
mild depression, 28% had an ISI score above the threshold for at least moderate insomnia, and
67% had a GAD7 score above the threshold for at least mild anxiety (Table 2).

To assess the relationship of psychiatric symptoms to covid-19 related stressors, the
relationship of each total symptom score to the CEI was quantified using a Pearson’s correlation
coefficient (Figures 1 and S1). Among health care workers specifically, the PCL5 was the most
strongly associated with CEI, with an R of .56 (p=4e-7); PHQ9, ISI and GAD7 were related to
CEI with R values of .29, .38 and .31 respectively (all p<.05). For first responders (N=23), PCL5,
PHQ9, ISI and GAD7 were all strongly associated with CEI (R values of .62, .56, .61 and .58
respectively, all p<.01).

4. Impact on self-reported work functioning and likelihood of continuing in current field
Impact on work functioning and likelihood of continuing in one’s current field were captured with
four questions (Figure 2). Responses from HCW and FR were similar, with a majority of each
group responding they were either “highly likely” or “moderately likely” to be working in their
current field in 5-10 years, while approximately a quarter reported this was not at all likely. When
asked how their experiences providing care during the Covid-19 pandemic had affected their
interest, willingness or ability to continue working in their current field, 11% of HCW and 4% FR
reported it had somewhat or significantly increased, 38% of HCW and 52% of FR reported no
change, and 51% of HCW and 44% of FR reported it had decreased (20% and 12%,

respectively, reporting significantly decreased). 53% of HCW and 44% of FR reported they were
sometimes, usually or always unable to do all of their usual work (for HCW, 10% usually and 5%
always). Similar or higher numbers reported being unable to “all the work that is really important
to me”.

The relationship of functional impact questions to CEI was assessed via Spearman’s correlation
(Figures 3 and S2). Across all participants, likelihood of remaining in one’s current field was
rated lower for those with higher CEI, while frequency of being unable to complete one’s usual
work was higher. When analyzed for the groups individually, these relationships were
statistically significant for the HCW group, but less consistent and not statistically significant for
the FR group alone.

The role of psychiatric symptom clusters in mediating self-reported functional impairment or
likelihood of leaving one’s current field was also assessed (Figure 4); for this analysis, the
results were corrected using a Bonferroni correction for n=16 multiple comparisons. A small but
statistically significant mediation by insomnia symptoms was identified in relating CEI to
likelihood of staying in field. A stronger and more consistent effect was seen relating psychiatric
symptoms to inability to complete usual work: PTSD symptoms (PCL5 total) was found to be a
highly significant (p<.001 after correction) mediator for both questions regarding work,
accounting for the majority of the effect, with insomnia symptoms (ISI total) showing smaller but
statistically significant mediation for both work-related items (p<.05 and p<.001, after correction,
for ability to complete usual work and important work, respectively).

Consistent with previous work, health care workers reported high levels of psychiatric symptoms
after working during the covid-19 pandemic3–8. Here, we build on this work by providing an
assessment of the relationship of these symptoms to covid-19 related occupational stressors,
their presence in FR, and the consequences of these experiences for occupational retention
and functioning.

We found that these symptoms were strongly related to a quantitative measure of covid-19
related occupational stress, suggesting they are unlikely to represent baseline rates of
psychiatric symptoms in this population during this time period, and are instead more
specifically related to experiences working during the pandemic. Although the total number of
first responder participants remains low at this time, the available responses showed very
similar degrees of distress and were also strongly related to the index of covid-19 related
occupational stress. These results suggest that the experiences of first responders should be
considered in future work addressing the impact of pandemic related occupational stressors on
our society in general and health and safety related systems in particular.

A substantial proportion of both groups reported their likelihood of staying in their current field
had been somewhat or significantly decreased by their experiences working during the Covid-19
pandemic, and that they at least sometimes have trouble completing all of their usual or
important work. In both cases, these findings were strongly related to the index of occupational
exposure. Surprisingly, however, the relationship of participants’ self-reported likelihood of
leaving their current field to covid-19 related occupational exposure was only minimally
mediated by psychiatric symptoms. This may mean that the impact of occupational stress due to
working during the covid-19 pandemic on retention in health care and related fields will not be
effectively addressed by either preventing or treating psychiatric symptoms related to stressful

experiences, but will instead require what are likely to be system-level changes in order to alter
individuals’ experiences working in these fields – such as the availability of PPE, workplace
support, sense of efficacy in caring for patients during such periods, or total exposure.

The finding of increased likelihood of leaving one’s current field in HCW with increased COVID19 related occupational stress is consistent with and builds upon findings from previous
pandemics. Almost a tenth of HCW surveyed in a SARS-affected hospital felt reluctance to work
or had considered resigning24. Another assessment of workplace behavior in healthcare workers
who had provided hospital care during a SARS outbreak found decreased total work hours,
increased numbers of missed work shifts, and decreased patient contact25.

In contrast to the findings related to expected retention in one’s current field, participants’ selfreported work-related functioning was strongly related to PTSD symptom burden, with an
additional significant relationship to insomnia symptoms. This suggests that prioritizing the
prevention and/or treatment of insomnia and particularly PTSD symptoms may be important for
protecting workplace functioning during such periods of prolonged occupational stress.

The prominence of sleep-related symptoms and their relationship to both current function and
likelihood of staying in field is also consistent with prior research. Insomnia symptoms were
identified in a study of medical staff caring for patients with COVID-19 in China as related to
social support with anxiety, stress and self-efficacy as mediating variables12. Sleep disruption or
insomnia during or immediately following a traumatic stressor has been identified as a
significant risk factor for the development of chronic PTSD symptoms26,27, and it is hypothesized

that this disruption may play a significant and causal role in the development of PTSD over
time28.

Studies of the impact of working during previous pandemics also underscores the need for
longitudinal follow up of the affected workforce. After the SARS outbreak, meta-analysis found
that nearly a quarter of HCW met criteria for clinically significant posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) during the acute phase of the outbreak29, with half that percentage still reporting PTSS
over 12 months after the outbreak subsided. HCW in Toronto experienced more long-term
adverse psychiatric outcomes following a 2003 SARS outbreak than their counterparts in
hospitals not treating SARS patients25. Further work following the trajectory of the outcome
measure in the current work over time will be important, including to identify forms of pandemicrelated occupational stressors that most acutely increase long term risk, and to identify
individuals most likely to benefit from directed intervention or longer term support.

The current work has significant limitations. The number of first responders included is low, and
replication in a larger sampling will be required. Additionally, the use of targeted outreach and
paid advertising targeting regions with high rates of Covid-19 cases for recruitment, rather than
systematic sampling of a defined population, means that the absolute rates of exposure to
pandemic-related occupational stressors and of psychiatric symptoms reported in the population
sampled should not be presumed to reflect rates in all health care workers, nationally or
internationally.

In addition, the assessment of covid-19 related occupational stress used in this study has not
been validated. It is expected that future work, using a larger total number of respondents, will

be able to provide psychometric validation of the exposure questionnaire. Particularly important
will be the completion of a factor analysis, and an assessment of which aspects of pandemicrelated occupational stressors are most closely related to both psychiatric symptoms and selfreported functional impairment and likelihood of leaving one’s current field. Such additional
information could guide more targeted interventions to change health care workers’ and first
responders’ experiences during such period of increased stress.

Finally, although insomnia and particularly PTSD symptoms were found to mediate the
relationship between occupational exposure and self-reported functional impairment, suggesting
that prevention and/or treatment of insomnia and PTSD symptoms in particular may be able to
improve self-reported functioning, this hypothesis will need to be tested in a prospective trial.

The impact of the covid-19 pandemic on our health care and first responder systems has been
nearly unprecedented in its breadth and duration. As our work and others have shown, many
HCW/FR have experienced significant psychiatric distress during this period. Here, we have
shown a close connection between the intensity of covid-19 related occupational stressors and
not just psychiatric symptoms experienced but also self-reported functional impairment and
increased likelihood of leaving one’s current field. We found that PTSD symptoms in particular
strongly mediated the relationship between these stressors and functional impairment,
suggesting that the assessment and treatment of PTSD symptoms may be particularly important
for workers exposed to covid-19 related occupational stressors, but that psychiatric symptoms
played a smaller role in mediating the relationship between these stressors and decreased
expectations of remaining in one’s current field. Finally, we found that these effects impacted
the health care and first responder work force broadly, including groups that have previously
received less attention than medical professionals. Future work focused on clarifying these

Figure 1. COVID-19 related occupational exposure is strongly related to increased burden
of psychiatric symptoms. Covid-19 exposure index (CEI) represents the sum of all responses
to the Covid-19 occupational exposure assessment questionnaire. R values represent the
Pearson’s coefficient relating the CEI to PTSD symptoms (A), depression symptoms (B),
insomnia symptoms (C) and anxiety symptoms (D).

Supplementary figure 1. COVID-19 related occupational exposure is strongly related to
increased burden of psychiatric symptoms across both HCW and FR, whether the groups
are analyzed together or independently. Covid-19 exposure index (CEI) represents the sum
of all responses to the Covid-19 occupational exposure assessment questionnaire. R values
represent the Pearson’s coefficient relating the CEI to PTSD symptoms (A-C), depression

Supplementary figure 2. Covid-19 related occupational exposure is strongly related to
self-reported likelihood of leaving one’s current field and self-reported impairments in
work functioning in HCW and when HCW and FR are analyzed together, but many of
these relationships are not maintained in the FR group when analyzed alone. Covid-19
exposure index (CEI) represents the sum of all responses to the Covid-19 occupational

Appendix A. COVID-19 Occupational Exposure Assessment (CEA) for health care
workers and first responders
1) Binary questions, asked without reference to a specific time period:
At any point, have you experienced the following? (Yes, No)
1. Had a known or strongly suspected infection with COVID-19
2. Had a family member that you live with or see regularly had a known or
strongly suspected infection with COVID-19
3. Experienced the death of family member or close colleague from known
or suspected COVID-19
4. Do you have medical conditions (not age alone) that put you at higher risk
from COVID-19? (Yes, No)

2) Likert scale questions, asked with reference to the 2 week period with the greatest
degree of distress, disruption or risk related to COVID-19, or the past 2 weeks if this
represents the most intense period of exposure:
In the following questions, we will ask about your work-related experiences
with individuals known or strongly suspected to have COVID-19.
Please apply these questions to your own work experiences as a health care worker
or first responder. For example, if a question asks about "caring for patients" and you
are a first responder, please include any experiences you have responding to calls,
even if you would not normally use the word "patient".
How often did you experience the following:
(0=Not at all, Several Days, More than half the days, 3=Nearly every day)
5. Caring for someone with mild symptoms related to COVID-19
6. Caring for someone critically ill with COVID-19
7. Working longer hours than usual in order to provide assistance or care
to individuals with COVID-19
8. Witnessing or responding to a death related to COVID-19, or losing a
patient you had been caring for to COVID-19
9. Caring for patients who have died without family physically present
due to COVID-19 precautions
10. Caring for patients with known or suspected COVID-19 when you were
not able to utilize appropriate PPE for the situation
11. Feeling your care for patients with COVID-19 has been futile or unhelpful
12. Feeling unable to provide high quality care to all patients
13. Feeling at increased risk for contracting COVID-19 due to your work
14. Feeling your family was at increased risk for contracting COVID-19 due to
your work
15. Feeling unsupported by your workplace
16. Maintaining separation from a member of your household in order to
reduce the risk to those you live with
17. Being expected to do things professionally that unnecessarily increase
your risk of exposure to COVID-19?
