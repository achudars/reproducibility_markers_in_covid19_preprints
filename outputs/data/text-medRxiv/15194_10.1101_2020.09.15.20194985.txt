Abstract
Background: COVID-19, the clinical syndrome caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2, has
been associated with deranged liver biochemistry in studies from China, Italy and the USA.
However, the clinical utility of liver biochemistry as a prognostic marker of outcome for
COVID-19 is currently debated.

Methods: We extracted routinely collected clinical data from a large teaching hospital in the
UK, matching 585 hospitalised SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients to 1165 hospitalised
SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-negative patients for age, gender, ethnicity and pre-existing
comorbidities. Liver biochemistry was compared between groups over time to determine
whether derangement was associated with outcome.

Results: 26.8% (157/585) of COVID-19 patients died, compared to 11.9% (139/1165) in the
non-COVID-19 group (p<0.001). At presentation, a significantly higher proportion of the
COVID-19 group had elevated alanine aminotransferase (20.7% vs. 14.6%, p=0.004) and
hypoalbuminaemia (58.7% vs. 35.0%, p<0.001), compared to the non-COVID-19 group.
Within the COVID-19 group, those with hypoalbuminaemia at presentation had 1.83-fold
increased hazards of death compared to those with normal albumin (adjusted hazard ratio
[HR] 1.83, 95% CI 1.25-2.67), whilst the hazard of death was ~4-fold higher in those aged

≥75 years (adjusted HR 3.96, 95% CI 2.59-6.04) and ~3-fold higher in those with preexisting liver disease (adjusted HR 3.37, 95% CI 1.58-7.16). In the COVID-19 group, alkaline
phosphatase increased (R=0.192, p<0.0001) and albumin declined (R=-0.123, p=0.0004)
over time in patients who died. We did not find a significant association between other liver
biochemistry and death.

Conclusion: In this UK population, liver biochemistry is commonly deranged in patients with
COVID-19 but only baseline low albumin and a rising alkaline phosphatase over time are
prognostic markers for death.

Key Points:
•

Age ≥ 75 years and low albumin at the time of a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test
can predict poor clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients.

•

Liver biochemistry is more likely to be abnormal in patients with COVID-19 than in
patients without COVID-19.

•

Patients with COVID-19 who died showed a greater decline in albumin and a greater
increase in alkaline phosphatase over time, compared to those who survived.

•

Patients with pre-existing liver disease and COVID-19 had an increased mortality.

Lay Summary:
We used routinely collected hospital data from a large UK teaching hospital to compare liver
biochemistry (markers of liver inflammation or damage) between 585 patients with COVID19 and 1165 patients of the same age and sex admitted to hospital but without COVID-19.
Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to die than those without COVID-19, and deaths
were significantly higher in those aged ≥75 years. We found that patients with COVID-19
were more likely to have abnormal liver biochemistry. Low albumin (a blood protein) at the
time of being diagnosed with COVID-19 was associated with an increased chance of death.

Introduction
Over 28 million confirmed cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) infection and 922,252 deaths have been reported globally as of 14th
September 2020; and the UK is one of the worst affected countries with 368,508 confirmed
cases and 41,628 deaths reported (1). The clinical syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2 is
COVID-19, which primarily affects the respiratory system, but other organs, including the
heart, gastrointestinal tract and liver may be affected, and a systemic sepsis syndrome may
develop (2).

Existing data on liver biochemistry in COVID-19 patients have been reported from China, the
USA and Italy.. These studies report that 37-69% of patients with COVID-19 had at least one
abnormal liver biochemistry on hospital admission (3-6) while 93% had at least one
abnormal liver biochemistry over the course of disease (6). Specially, the prevalence
estimates of elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
and bilirubin (BR) in COVID-19 patients are 9%-28%, 14%-35% and 6%-23%, respectively
(3-9). Some studies reported that liver biochemistry abnormalities are associated with longer
hospital stay (4), or clinical severity (3, 10), whereas other studies have not found a
relationship between liver biochemistry and severity (7, 9). The set of liver biochemistry
reported for COVID-19 patients varies: ALT, AST, and total BR are typically included with
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and, Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) less frequently
reported.

Albumin is a non-specific marker of liver function, and has been less consistently assessed;
it is typically reported as one parameter of patients’ baseline characteristics, with limited
investigation of its impact as a prognostic marker. A recent meta-analysis of 20 retrospective
studies from China revealed that patients with severe COVID-19 had lower albumin level
compared to mild cases, but there was significant heterogeneity between studies (11).
Another meta-analysis showed that hypoalbuminaemia could be included in prognostic
machine learning models to predict severe COVID-19 or mortality (12).

Several studies have investigated potential associations between liver biochemistry and
death in COVID-19 patients (6-8), or included liver biochemistry in the development of
predictive models (13-16). A report from Italy showed that ALP >150 U/L at admission
(without adjusting for relevant confounders) was associated with clinical deterioration in 292
COVID-19 patients (7), and another study from the USA reported that peak ALT >5 times
upper limit of normal (ULN) during admission was associated with death in a cohort of 2,273

COVID-19 patients (8). However, another USA study reported that elevations in ALT and
AST elevation on admission were associated with length of stay, ICU admission and
intubation but not death (6). Studies from Wuhan, China did not find associations of ALT (13,
14) or AST (14) elevation on admission with death in COVID-19 patients, whilst several
studies have reported associations of elevated total bilirubin (14) and low albumin on
admission (14-16) with risk of death have been reported. Given these variable associations
between liver biochemistry and COVID-19 outcomes, the prognostic value of liver
biochemistry derangement in COVID-19 needs further evaluation.

Having established a clinical data pipeline through the National Institute for Health Research
(NIHR) Health Informatics Collaborative (HIC) (17, 18), our tertiary referral hospital in the UK
is strongly placed to undertake analyses using electronic health data from hospitalised
patients. Using this resource, we aimed to determine the prevalence of deranged liver
biochemistry at baseline and over the disease course in COVID-19 patients, with
comparison to a matched group of non-COVID-19 patients admitted during the same period.
We also aimed to determine whether baseline liver biochemistry derangement was
associated with risk of death in COVID-19 patients, and to compare longitudinal changes in
liver biochemistries between COVID-19 patients who died and who survived.

Methods
Data collection
We used routinely collected clinical data from Oxford University Hospitals (OUH) NHS
Foundation Trust, a large teaching hospital trust in the South East of the UK, with ~1000 inpatient beds. The data is collected by the local NIHR HIC team in Oxford, being drawn
automatically from operational systems into a data warehouse and linked to produce a
comprehensive record for each patient, as previously described (17). All of the data used for
this studied were provided in anonymised form by OUH NHS Foundation Trust, with the prior
approval of the Trust Information Governance Team, following the satisfactory completion of
a Data Protection Impact Assessment. The management of the dataset is governed by the
NIHR HIC Data Sharing Framework. Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained for
the database and associated activity: IRAS ID 174658; REC reference 15/SC/0523.

The data extracted for this study included detailed information on demographics, body mass
index (BMI), emergency admissions, blood test results, diagnostic codes, procedures,
intensive care unit admission, prescriptions, medicines administration, and discharge

destination/outcome for all patients admitted to OUH between 1st January 2020 and 21st
August 2020.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
To select eligible data for adults with/without COVID-19, the inclusion criteria were: (a) at
least one RT-PCR nose/throat swab having been undertaken (COVID-19 patients were
defined by at least one positive result; COVID-19-negative patients were defined by the
absence of a positive result); (b) age ≥ 18 years when tested; (c) hospitalised patients; and
(d) at least one episode of liver biochemistry recorded at the time of receiving RT-PCR test
or after RT-PCR test (the set of liver biochemistry routinely tested by OUH clinical
biochemistry laboratory comprises ALT, ALP, albumin, and BR; AST and GGT are not
routinely tested). Exclusion criteria were: (a) SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results reported as
invalid; (b) missing age; and (c) pregnancy (antenatal/delivery/post-partum).

Definitions
We defined baseline as the date of the first positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test for a COVID19 patient and the date of the first negative test for a patient without COVID-19. The end of
follow-up was defined as the date of last available electronic patient record data for a
patient.

The normal ranges set by the hospital biochemistry lab are: ALT: 10-45 IU/L; ALP: 30-130
IU/L; BR: 0-21 umol/L; Albumin: 32-50 g/L. The reference ranges for other blood tests are
provided in Table S1. We defined baseline liver biochemistry (ALT, ALP, BR, or albumin) as
the liver biochemistry measured within 7 days of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test and baseline
derangement as at least one abnormal result at this time point. We defined peak/nadir liver
biochemistry derangement as at least one abnormal value at any point during follow-up. We
defined liver biochemistry recovery as normalisation following derangement. The primary
outcome was death during follow-up, and secondary outcomes included ICU admission and
invasive ventilation.

Pre-existing comorbidities were defined by a historical diagnosis of a disease before
baseline, and diagnosis codes retrieved were provided in Table S2. A full list of prescribed
drugs searched for data extraction is provided in Table S3.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using R version 4.0.2. All significance tests performed
were two-sided. p values <0.05 were deemed statistically significant.

Propensity Score Matching
We selected eligible subjects, and conducted propensity score matching process to ensure
the COVID-19 group was comparable to the non-COVID-19 group in terms of demographics
and pre-existing conditions. We used the following variables to calculate propensity scores:
age, gender, ethnicity, and pre-existing comorbidities (liver disease, diabetes mellitus (DM),
hypertension (HTN), coronary heart disease (CHD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and
cancer). We performed propensity score matching using the package MatchIt, with the
nearest-neighbour method applied, the matching ratio and calliper size set as 1:2 and 0.1
respectively, and without replacement.

Comparison of COVID-19 and matched non-COVID-19 patients
For continuous variables, we calculated median and interquartile range (IQR), or mean and
standard deviation (SD), and used Wilcoxon test or t-test for comparison. For categorical
variables, we computed number and percentage, and used chi-square or Fisher’s exact test
for comparison. We used the Shapiro-Wilk test and graphical methods for normality check.

Investigation on whether liver biochemistry predict outcomes in COVID-19 patients
We compared the presence of clinical outcomes in the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19
groups. We also performed Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis to compare the survival probability
over time in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups. Within the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19
groups, we compared demographics, BMI, comorbidities, baseline and peak/nadir liver
biochemistry between those who died vs. survived. We then performed K-M analysis to
compare the survival probabilities over time between subgroups with and without deranged
baseline liver biochemistry. We used univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards
models to investigate whether liver biochemistry predicted death, reporting hazard ratios
(HRs) and 95% confidential intervals (CIs). To investigate associations of additional patient
characteristics with risk of death, and the robustness of HRs to adjustment for additional
confounders, we performed sensitivity/subset analysis whereby associations were
investigated in a subset of patients who were not missing data for confounders.

Longitudinal analysis of liver biochemistry in COVID-19 patients
We compared liver biochemistry between COVID-19 group and non-COVID-19 group at
each time point (to examine difference between groups), as well as investigating liver
biochemistry changes over time by comparing liver biochemistry at subsequent time points
to their baseline within each group (to examine longitudinal changes). Within the COVID-19
group, we performed longitudinal analysis of liver biochemistry in subgroups of patients who
died and survived by fitting linear regression lines with 95% CIs, and reporting Pearson’s
correlation coefficients and linear regression significance.

Results
Identification, demographics, and outcomes of COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19
groups
We identified 6311 eligible patients (585 adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection and 5726
without) according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria (Figure S1). Based on our 585 COVID19-positive patients, we matched a cohort of 1165 COVID-19-negative patients. After
matching, there were no significant differences in demographics and pre-existing
comorbidities between the two groups (Table 1; Table S4). Median duration of follow-up
was 58 [IQR: 14-104] days in the COVID-19 group and 50 [IQR: 20-78] days in the matched
non-COVID-19 group, with no difference in the monitoring duration of liver biochemistry
(Table 1). The distribution of admitting specialties (Table S5) and prescribed antiviral
therapy did not differ significantly between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups (Table
S6).

Assessment of liver biochemistry in the COVID-19 compared to non-COVID-19 group
Baseline liver biochemistry was available in 492 COVID-19 patients and 974 non-COVID-19
patients; patients with deranged peak liver biochemistry were less likely to have missing
baseline liver biochemistry data (Table S7). The median time interval between consecutive
liver biochemistry measurements was 1 [IQR: 1-4] day and 2 [IQR: 1-7] days, for COVID-19
and non-COVID-19 groups respectively.

At baseline, the COVID-19 group had a significantly higher median ALT value (25 IU/L vs.
19 IU/L, p<0.001) and a higher proportion of patients with ALT >ULN (20.7% vs.14.6%,
p=0.004) than the non-COVID-19 group. The COVID-19 group also had a lower median
albumin (30 g/L vs. 34 g/L, p<0.001), lower platelets (216 x10*9/L vs. 245 x10*9/L, p<0.001),
lower lymphocytes (0.9 x10*9/L vs. 1.2 x10*9/L, p<0.001) and a significantly higher CRP (78
mg/L vs. 20 mg/L, p<0.001), as compared to the non-COVID-19 group. Activated partial
thromboplastin time (APPT) and baseline vital signs were also more deranged in the
COVID-19 group, whilst renal function was preserved (Table 1). Overall, the COVID-19
group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with ≥1 deranged liver biochemistry at
baseline compared to the non-COVID-19 group (72.6% vs. 55.5%, p<0.001) (Table S8).

Over follow-up, the COVID-19 group also had more deranged liver biochemistry, with a
higher median peak ALT (34 IU/L vs. 26 IU/L, p<0.001), a higher proportion with peak ALT

lower median nadir albumin (26 g/L vs. 29 g/L,

p<0.001), and a higher prevalence of hypoalbuminaemia (79.0% vs. 59.5%, p<0.001)
compared to the non-COVID-19 group (Table S8). COVID-19 patients also had significantly
higher median ALT and lower median albumin values at all time points throughout follow-up
(7, 14, 21, and 28 days), compared to the non-COVID-19 group (all p<0.05) (Figure 2A-B).
In the COVID-19 group, median ALT increased at 7 and 14 days, compared to baseline
(both p<0.05) (Figure 2C), and median albumin decreased at 7 days of follow-up compared
to baseline (p<0.0001) and maintained at low levels at subsequent time points (Figure 2D).
We did not identify differences in ALP and bilirubin over time between these groups, other
than at baseline or at 7 days (Figure S2).

Demographics, comorbidities and liver biochemical characteristics associated with
mortality in COVID-19 patients
In the COVID-19 group, patients who died were significantly older than those who survived
(median age 82 years vs. 66 years respectively), significantly more likely to have preexisting comorbidities including liver disease, DM, CHD and cancer (Table 2), significantly
more likely to have baseline hypoalbuminaemia (72.6% vs. 52.9%, p<0.001) and low nadir

Survival curves and logrank tests (unadjusted for relevant confounders) within the COVID-19
group displayed that surviving probability over time was significantly lower in patients with
hypoalbuminaemia at baseline than those with normal baseline albumin (Figure 3A), a
higher surviving probability in patients with elevated baseline ALT as compared to normal
baseline ALT (Figure 3B), while elevated ALP or bilirubin at baseline were not significantly
associated with a lower survival probability over time (Figure 3C-D). In addition, for the
subset of COVID-19 patients who had prothrombin time (PT) and international normalised
ratio (INR), elevation of these parameters at baseline were significantly associated with a
lower survival probability (Figure S3).

positive for SARS-CoV-2: (A) normal and low baseline albumin; (B) normal and elevated baseline
ALT; (C) normal and elevated baseline ALP; (D) normal and elevated baseline bilirubin. K-M, KaplanMeier. p-values were based on the logrank test. One patient has missing death date.

In multivariate analysis (fully adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, and prescribed drug
use before baseline) for the COVID-19 group, those with hypoalbuminaemia at baseline had
a 1.83-fold-increased hazards of death compared to those with normal baseline albumin
(adjusted HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.25-2.67), those aged ≥75 years had a ~4-fold-increased
hazards of death compared to those aged <75 years (adjusted HR 3.96, 95% CI 2.59-6.04),
and those with pre-existing liver disease had a ~3-fold-increased hazards of death than
those without pre-existing liver disease (adjust HR 3.37, 95% CI 1.58-7.16) (Table 3). More
specifically, a one unit (1 g/L) decrease in albumin at baseline was associated with a 5%
increase in hazards of death (adjusted HR 1.05, 95%CI 1.02-1.09), while age increased by
10 years was associated with 82% increase in hazards of death (adjusted HR 1.82, 95% CI
1.56-2.13) (Table S11). Similarly, a one unit decrease in nadir albumin during follow-up was
associated with a 7% increase in hazards of death (adjusted HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.04-1.10)
(Table S12). In the COVID-19 group baseline albumin was significantly negatively correlated

For the subset of COVID-19 patients who had BMI data (survived vs. died, 246 vs. 96), HRs
did not change materially after additional adjustment for BMI in the multivariate analysis
(Table S13). Baseline albumin was weakly correlated with BMI both in those who died and

Longitudinal assessment of liver biochemistry patterns in patients who died with

Within the COVID-19 group, patients who died during follow-up had significantly lower
median values of albumin at baseline, 7 and 14 days after a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR,
compared to the patients who survived (all p<0.001) (Figure 4A). There was no significant
difference in ALT at any time point other than 7 days between those who died and survived

In the COVID-19 group, ALT increased during the first two weeks and remained elevated
during follow-up in patients who died, whilst in patients who survived ALT decreased from 7
days onward with a trend to normalisation (Figure 5A-B). ALP increased over time in both
subgroups, with a greater increase in those who died (Figure 5C-D). BR decreased
throughout follow-up in both subgroups (Figure 5E-F). Albumin decreased significantly in
both groups during the first 7 days and continued to decline in patients who died, but in
patients who survived had an upward trend especially for those had been followed up longer
than one month (Figure 5G-H).
Among COVID-19 patients who had ≥2 longitudinal data points for ALT, ALP, BR and
albumin, 468 had at least one liver biochemistry derangement during follow-up. Among them
26.9% (126/468) had normalised by the end of follow-up, while the remaining 73.1% still had
at ≥1 abnormal liver biochemistry at the end of follow-up. The information of each liver

Discussion
Novelty and key findings
To our knowledge this is the first study to: i) comprehensively conduct longitudinal analyses
of liver biochemistry patterns over time in COVID-19 patients compared to a matched
general patient cohort, and ii) analyse longitudinal liver biochemistry patterns in COVID-19
patients who have died and survived. We have gathered a large cohort through an automatic
approach, and account for missing data in the analysis.

The COVID-19 group exhibited ~2-fold higher death rate, with significantly lower survival
probability compared to the non-COVID-19 group. Among the COVID-19 group, a higher
proportion of patients had at least one abnormal liver biochemistry (ALT, ALP, BR or
albumin) at baseline and during follow-up, compared to the matched non-COVID-19 group.
Patients with COVID-19 who died showed a decline in albumin and a greater increase in
ALP over time compared to those who survived, and baseline hypoalbuminaemia was a
significant predictor of death in COVID-19 patients on multivariate analysis with adjusting for
relevant confounders.

Comparison to previous studies
In our study, rates of baseline and peak ALT derangement between COVID-19 and nonCOVID-19 groups were significantly different, consistent with findings from a large USA
cohort (8). The increase in ALT between baseline and at 14 days follow-up in the COVID-19
group is also consistent with previous research (6).

Patients with pre-existing liver disease were found to have an increased risk of mortality in
COVID-19 which is consistent with the findings of previous studies (19, 20) however there is
only a small number of patients with the pre-existing liver disease in our study. Because
some COVID-19 patients in our cohort were admitted to hospital for non-COVID-19 we
analysed baseline liver biochemistry at the time of the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR rather than
date of admission. This may partially explain differences between our study and previous
studies which analysed liver biochemistry measured on hospital admission (3-6). Variable
patterns of drug use between cohorts may also account for differences.

Although baseline hypoalbuminaemia was significantly associated with hazards of death in
COVID-19, ALT, ALP, and BR were not. Recent findings from two multi-centre studies
support the prognostic association of albumin with death in COVID-19 (16, 21). However,
other studies aiming to explore whether liver biochemistry derangement is associated with
death in COVID-19 did not investigate albumin (6-8). Interestingly, a previous study found
that hypoalbuminemia is a strong predictor of 30-day all-cause mortality in acutely admitted
medical patients (22). As albumin is a cheap and widely available test, it can be usefully
employed as a prognostic biomarker.

Due to variable population settings in previous studies (e.g., demographics, comorbidities), it
is important to understand the populations in which prognostic models are developed (12) to
ensure such models are externally valid. For example, a study from the US (8) reported a
positive association of ALT >5 times ULN with death, however we were unable to replicate

this investigation as only a small number of participants had ALT elevated to this level;
furthermore, the prevalence of comorbid disease and BMI >35kg/m2 in the US study
population was much higher compared to our cohort. Similarly, a large primary care cohort
study (23) reported that BMI >40kg/m2 was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19related death, but we were underpowered to replicate this analysis.

COVID-19 and liver biochemistry derangement
Although derangements in liver biochemistry are common in COVID-19 patients, the
reasons for the liver injury remain unclear, but may include direct viral damage, druginduced liver injury, hypoxia, immune-mediated injury, sepsis, or cytokine release (24, 25).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (26) is
found abundantly in the gastrointestinal tract and liver, in addition to presenting in alveolar
type 2 cells (the major SARS-CoV-2 targeting cell type in lung). A recent study observed a
higher expression of ACE2 in cholangiocytes (59.7% of cells) compared to hepatocytes
(2.6%) (27). Given the hepatic distribution of the ACE2 receptor, SARS-CoV-2 may well
cause damage of both bile ducts and liver (28, 29). Alternatively, the liver may be a
bystander, with deranged liver biochemistry reflecting systemic disease (30).

Caveats and limitations
Routinely collected liver biochemistry is not consistent between settings, and therefore the
definitions of liver biochemistry derangement may vary across studies. Although AST and
GGT have been investigated in previous studies, these parameters are not available for our
population. We recognise that analysis can be influenced by missing data, but we report
missing values and investigating peak/nadir values as well as baseline. We also undertook
sensitivity analysis in a subset of patients with complete BMI measurements to investigate
its association with death. Our cohort in the South East of the UK may not be representative
of populations elsewhere, especially in terms of ethnic diversity, so caution should be
applied in extrapolation of results.

Future studies
Further longitudinal studies of COVID-19 outcomes in diverse patient groups, including
those with pre-existing liver disease are needed. The NIHR HIC program will continue to
benefit the field of COVID-19 research, as data accumulated for further large teaching
hospitals can be used to expand this analysis, resulting in a more generalizable study
population and increased statistical power.

Liver biochemistry derangement is common in COVID-19 patients at the time of a SARSCoV-2 RT-PCR test and during the clinical course of disease. Baseline and nadir albumin
are valuable prognostic factors that are associated with death in COVID-19 patients.

COVID-19 group vs. non-COVID-19 group had data of all the liver biochemistry available at baseline.
†
For ALT, ALP, bilirubin, we investigated the peak values while nadir values for albumin. For
categorical variables, Fisher exact test was performed for comparison on cells with small counts (<5),
otherwise Chi-square test was used. For continuous variables, Wilcoxon test was used for
comparison due to non-normality. ALT, Alanine transaminase; ALP, Alkaline phosphatase;LLN, Lower
limit of normal; ULN, Upper limit of normal.

Table S11. Associations of baseline liver biochemistries with death among patients with
COVID-19, investigated with Cox proportional-hazards modelling. † To make it more
interpretable, we transfer the baseline albumin values to negative values. NB. Analyses were
performed on the 492 COVID-19 patients with baseline liver biochemistry data available (survived vs.
died: 346 vs. 146); variables (except for demographics, comorbidities) with p<0.1 in univariate
analysis were included for multivariate analysis; in the multivariate analysis, HRs were fully adjusted
for drugs use before baseline (including antiviral drugs, antibiotics, anticoagulants, acetaminophen,
immunosuppressants, statins) to reduce confounding effects. ALT, Alanine transaminase; ALP,

non-COVID-19 group at each time point and the longitudinal changes of liver biochemistry
(ALP, bilirubin) over time within each group: (A) ALP comparison at baseline, 7, 14, 21, 28 days;
(B) ALP changes over time; (C) Bilirubin comparison at baseline, 7, 14, 21, 28 days; (D) Bilirubin
changes over time. ALP, Alkaline phosphatase. Green dash-dotted lines indicate the lower limits of
normal and the upper limits of normal. * p-value <0.05, ** p-value <0.01, *** p-value <0.001, **** pvalue <0.0001.

Figure S3. K-M curves for comparisons of time from testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 to death
for subgroups stratified by: (A) Normal and abnormal high baseline PT; (B) normal and abnormal
high baseline INR. K-M, Kaplan-Meier; PT, Prothrombin time; INR, International normalised ratio. A
subset of the COVID-19 group (n=430 vs. n=429) had data on PT and INR at baseline. p-values were
based on the logrank test.
