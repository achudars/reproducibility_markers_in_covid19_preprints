Severe-acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for
COVID-19, has spread rapidly causing significant global morbidity and mortality 1. The United
States has now emerged as the global epicenter. As states move to lift intervention measures, it
becomes more important to estimate the rate at which the epidemic is growing using the realtime effective reproductive number, Rt. Using a collated time series of daily state-wise positive
case counts from the COVID Tracking Project 2, we estimate Rt to provide a baseline estimate of
the impact of all combined non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) at the state level and for the
entire country. We present the results for each state and the whole country in a user-friendly web
interface updated daily at https://covid19-realtimereproductionnumber.shinyapps.io/ShinyAPP/. We
calculate Rt using two complementary methods, the Wallinga and Teunis (WT) method 3 which
is forward-looking and the Cori method 4 which is backward-looking. We also present two daily
test metrics: test utilization per capita and the positive tests per capita 2 alongside Rt for each
state (See Figure 1 with Utah and the U.S. as examples). The results for all 50 states and the U.S.
are provided as supplementary materials.

Figure 1: Estimates of the real time effective reproductive number, Rt, for Utah and the
U.S. from March 19 until May 7, 2020. Top Panel: Estimates of R using two methods, WT (red)
t

and Cori (blue) for Utah (left) and the U.S. (right), respectively. The generation time distribution
is assumed to follow Gamma distribution with mean 6.5 and standard deviation 4 for both
methods. Bottom Panel: Daily test utilization per 100,000 people (grey bars) and daily positive
tests per 100,000 people (blue line) for Utah (left) and the U.S. (right), respectively.

The overall downward trend indicates that most states have been able to reduce the reproductive
w
number of SARS-CoV-2. However, few states have demonstrated an ability to maintain Rt below
one in a statistically significant manner. An uptick of Rt around the beginning of May might
indicate that political protests or exhaustion for social distancing may be impacting our ability to
control COVID-19. While we find that both methods show a drop in Rt, we find a significant
difference in the timing of Rt<1. As noted in Lipsitch et al. 2020 5, the difference is
consequential enough to impact policy decision making, highlighting the importance of method
o
selection for Rt estimation. We find that the median difference in timing of Rt<1 between the two
methods is approximately one week.
Although data quality issues plagued early estimates of Rt, we believe our estimates of Rt are
beneficial for tracking the impacts of lifting restrictions on social activity and reducing NPIs.
Given the utility of Rt, we plan to continue hosting and managing the web interface throughout
the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe this product is crucial to help policy makers track the
progress of current policies and modulate future risk levels.
