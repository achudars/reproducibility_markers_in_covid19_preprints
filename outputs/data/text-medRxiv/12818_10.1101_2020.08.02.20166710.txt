Abstract

： The outbreak of COVID-19 has become a global health

Background and objective

concern. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness and safety of convalescent
plasma therapy in patients with severe and critically ill COVID-19.
Methods

：

Sixteen COVID-19 patients received transfusion of anti-COVID-19

antibody-positive convalescent plasma. The main outcome was time for viral nucleic
acid amplification (NAA) test turning negative. Clinical laboratory parameters were
measured at the baseline (d0) before plasma transfusion, and day 1 (d1), day 3 (d3)
after transfusion as well.
Results: Among the 16 patients, 10 of them had a consistently positive result of viral
NAA test before convalescent plasma transfusion. Eight patients (8/10) became
negative from day 2 to day 8 after transfusion. Severe patients showed a shorter time
for NAA test turning negative after transfusion (mean rank 2.17 vs 5·90, P = 0.036).
Two critically ill patients transfused plasma with lower antibody level remained a
positive result of NAA test. CRP level demonstrated a decline 1 day after
convalescent plasma treatment, compared with the baseline (P = 0.017). No adverse
events were observed during convalescent plasma transfusion.
Conclusions: Viral NAA test of most patients with COVID-19 who received
convalescent plasma transfusion turned negative on the 2nd to 8th days after
transfusion, and the negative time of severe patients was shorter than that of critically
ill patients.

Introduction
An outbreak of viral pneumonia has been reported in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, P.
R. China since December 2019. The disease was subsequently confirmed to be an
infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus infection which is now named as
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 1, and WHO names
the disease induced by SARS-CoV-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 2.
COVID-19 has spread rapidly globally3-6 and a total of 82,880 confirmed cases and
4,633 deaths were reported in China before May 3, 2020, with a fatality rate of 5.59%
7

. A retrospective study of 52 critically ill COVID-19 patients in Wuhan Jin Yin-tan

Hospital showed that mortality rate of critically ill cases was as high as 51·2%
(32/52)8. Under the strict and comprehensive measures to control the source of
infection and cut off the route of transmission, the number of new cases of COVID-19
in China has decreased significantly. The management of COVID-19 is now focusing
on the treatment of severe and critically ill patients.

There are currently no specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19, the clinical effects
of some drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine phosphate, and abidol still need
further validation in clinical trials although they have been included in the guideline
published by National Health Commission of P. R. China

. Convalescent plasma

transfusion has been used for clinical treatment of acute viral infectious diseases for a
long time, and it has been used in the Spanish influenza pneumonia more than 100
years ago. A meta-analysis shows that patients with Spanish influenza pneumonia
transfusion with influenza-convalescent human blood products reduced the risk for

death 11. Moreover, convalescent plasma has also been used in the treatment of severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS),
H1N1 influenza, and Ebola disease12-15. The 4th edition of COVID-19 and the later
updated clinical diagnosis and treatment scheme by National Health Commission of P.
R. China also mentioned that convalescent plasma transfusion can be recommended to
treat severe and critically ill patients under the symptomatic treatment, respiratory
support, and circulatory support treatment10,16,17.

In this study, we analyzed 16 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 who received
convalescent plasma in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University and
Henan Provincial People’s Hospital to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of
convalescent plasma in COVID-19.

Methods

This case series study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Scientific Research
and Clinical Trials of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University and the
Henan Provincial People’s Hospital, respectively. The approval number is
2020-KY-060. Patients diagnosed as COVID-19 by the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid
amplification (NAA) test were given the convalescent plasma treatment if they
fulfilled the following criteria: Rapidly progressed, severe or critically ill patient10,
with a written informed consent given by the patient or next-of-kin. Patients were
excluded if they were hypersensitive to plasma or plasma products, were known to
have immunoglobulin A deficiency. Patients received a transfusion of convalescent

plasma according to the ABO-compatible principle, 200-400 mL convalescent plasma
was transfused each time, and could be repeated transfused 2-3 times if necessary.
Adverse events were closely observed during transfusion. Conventional treatment
including supportive treatment, antiviral treatment, antibacterial treatment, traditional
Chinese medicine treatment, and respiratory circulation support treatment, etc. were
carried out according to the clinical diagnosis and treatment scheme of COVID-1910.

The primary outcome is the time for viral NAA test turning negative (two
consecutive negative tests for viral nucleic acid with an interval time not less than 24
hours) after convalescent plasma transfusion. Laboratory parameters at baseline (d0),
one day (d1), and three days (d3) after transfusion were recorded, including white
blood cell (WBC) counts, neutrophil (NEU) counts, lymphocyte (LYM) counts,
C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase
(CK), creatine kinase isoenzyme (CKMB), hypersensitive troponin T (cTnT), and
lactic acid (Lac). The ratios of d1/d0, and d3/d0 were calculated to describe the
change. Clinical information such as invasive ventilation, application of
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), comorbidities were also recorded.

All plasma donors has diagnosed as COVID-19 by NAA test and recovered from
infection, continued the quarantine for 2 weeks after discharge. The donors should
also meet the following criteria: recovered patients aged 18-55 years old, with the
weight more than 50Kg for males and 45Kg for females, no blood-borne diseases,

assessed by a clinician to be able to donate plasma, and gave a written informed
consent by the donor. The apheresis plasma machine was used to collect the plasma of
donors at Henan Red Cross Blood Center (Zhengzhou, China). After the plasma was
collected, pathogens were detected and the plasma was stored by the blood station in
accordance with the relevant operating procedures. Qualified samples will be sent to
the medical institution for detection of plasma antibody level using the method of
magnetic particle chemiluminescence.

All data were tested for distribution of normality. Data met the normal
distribution were expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and compared using the t
test. Data did not meet the normal distribution were expressed as median (minimum,
maximum value), and compared using a non-parametric test (Wilcoxon or
Mann-Whitney U test). SPSS (version 21.0; SPSS) was used for statistical
computation. A P value of 0.05 was considered to represent significant difference.
Results
A total of 16 patients, including 5 female and 11 male patients, received convalescent
plasma treatment (Table 1). Patients were aged 30-90 years , with an average age of
(65 ± 19) years. Among the enrolled patients, 5 of them (31.25%, 5/16) were in a
severe illness, and 11 (68.75%, 11/16) were critically illness; 62.50% (10/16) of the
patients had comorbidities; the rates of invasive ventilation and use of extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in critically ill patients were 90.91% (10/11) and
45.46% (5/11) respectively. The convalescent plasma transfusion in this study started
on the 12th to 36th days of the onset of symptoms, with an average (23 ± 7) days. The

plasma transfusion volume ranged from 200 to 1200 mL, with the majority being 200
mL. Upon donation, 200 to 400 mL of convalescent plasma was obtained from 30
donors by apheresis, a cumulative donation of 11.4 L plasma were collected.

This study recorded the time for viral NAA test turning negative after
convalescent plasma transfusion (Table 2). Viral NAA test of 10 patients were
consistently positive before convalescent plasma transfusion. Two critically ill
patients remained a positive result of NAA test and were died on the 3rd and 6th day
after the transfusion respectively. Eight patients became negative from day 2 to day 8
after transfusion, including 5 critically ill and 3 severe patients. Subgroup analysis
demonstrated that severe patients showed a shorter time for NAA test turning negative
after transfusion (Mann-Whitney U test, mean rank 2.17 vs 5.90, P = 0.036).

The convalescent plasma antibody level in this study was ranged from 10.93 to
114.7 AU/mL, with an average value of (56.44 ± 39.4) AU/mL. The average plasma
antibody level and accumulated dose of antibody before NAA turned negative were
calculated (Table 2). In 10 severe and critically ill patients, plasma antibody level and
accumulated dose showed a similar trend, and the median antibody level of the two
consistently positive patients was the lowest (Figure 1A, 1B). We then excluded 3
severe patients due to the differences in the time of viral NAA test turning negative
between severe and critically ill patients. In 7 critically ill patients, a possible
correlation trend was observed between the median plasma antibody level (or
accumulated dose) and time of viral NAA test turning negative after convalescent

plasma application (Figure 1C, 1D). However, this trend was not sufficient to be
statistically significant due to the limitation of the number of enrolled patients.

For laboratory parameters (Table 3, 4), CRP level demonstrated a decline 1 day
after convalescent plasma treatment with the median ratio of 0.63, compared with the
baseline (Figure 2, 3 P = 0.017). WBC (P=0.014) and NEU ratio (P=0.009) at d1/d0
also showed a decline. No significance was found in the ratio of d3/d0 (Table S1, S2

in appendix; P 0.05). No adverse events were found during convalescent plasma
transfusion in 16 patients.
Discussion
This study analyzed and summarized the basic characteristics and laboratory
parameters of patients with convalescent plasma transfusion in provincial medical
institutions in Henan province, China. More than 1,000 COVID-19 patients have been
diagnosed in the area. Not only in China, COVID-19 epidemic has become an
international public concern and affected more than 90,000 people worldwide18,19. We
preliminary evaluated some of the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma
treatment. Shortening viral carrying time is particularly important for the treatment
and control of COVID-19. In our study, time for viral NAA test negation is an
important observational parameter for evaluating the effectiveness of convalescent
plasma in this study. We found that the time of viral negativity was 2-8 days after
transfusion for most enrolled patients (8/10), in addition, this time was even shorter in
severe patients than in critically ill patients.

As a sensitive indicator of inflammation, CRP is widely used in the evaluation of
various infectious diseases alone or in combination with other indicators20,21.
Increased CRP level was observed in 93.75% (15/16) of the patients in the baseline,
and the average CRP level of patients was observed to drop to about 0.63 of the
baseline level, suggesting convalescent plasma transfusion may play a role in
reducing the body’s inflammatory response rapidly. In addition, in this study, a
decrease in the counts of WBC and neutrophils was observed one day after plasma
transfusion. The original data showed the WBC count of 12 patients (75%) were
within the normal range in the baseline, and WBC counts of most patients fluctuated
within the normal range. Therefore, we believe that the changes of WBC and
neutrophils we observed are not clinically significant in evaluating the effectiveness
in convalescent plasma.

It is worth noting that 2 patients (2/10) remained positive in virus NAA test after
convalescent plasma transfusion, and the disease progressed rapidly and finally
caused death in a short period of time, indicating the function of convalescent plasma
in some patients may be very limited. In order to make sure the safety of plasma
samples, all plasma donors has recovered from infection and continued the quarantine
for 2 weeks after discharge. As fewer new cases with severe or critically illness in our
province were reported in our province, early use of convalescent plasma is limited,
most of the patients received convalescent plasma treatment in this study were
critically ill patients who had a history of ventilator and ECMO applications, which
may attenuate the effects of convalescent plasma. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza

epidemic, 20 patients has enrolled in a convalescent plasma clinical trial reported by
Hung et al. In their study, the plasma neutralizing antibody titer (NAT) was greater
than 1: 160, and the enrolled patients were admitted to the ICU within 7 days of the
onset of the disease, convalescent plasma transfusion was performed on the 2nd day
on average. Hung et al. concluded that convalescent plasma therapy can reduce
mortality in patients with H1N1 infection (20.0% vs 54.8%; P=0.01)22. In another
multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, 18 patients were treated with
hyperimmune IV immunoglobulin (H-IVIG, product from convalescent plasma)
within 5 days of the onset of symptoms with H1N1 infection, which could also reduce
the viral load and death of patients rate23 . Therefore, early use of convalescent plasma
therapy is recommend in COVID-19 patients. However, there is also a study for Ebola
disease showed that two consecutive transfusions of convalescent plasma for a dose of
200-250 mL within 2 days of onset did not improve disease survival13.

In addition to the early application of convalescent plasma therapy, concentration
of antibody in convalescent plasma may be another factor closely associated with
effectiveness. Two patients died with a persistently positive viral NAA test after
plasma transfusion in the study, the plasma (200 mL for each) they transfused came
from a same donor with an low antibody concentration of 16.79 AU/mL. Our small
sample study found that there may be a correlation between the plasma antibody
concentration and the time for viral turning negative in critically ill patients, patients
transfused plasma with a higher antibody level may have a shorter time for viral test
negation. In the above-mentioned paper, convalescent plasma treatment showed a

negative conclusion in Ebola disease, we noticed the researchers did not detect and
screen the antibody level in the plasma13. Brown J F et al. proposed that convalescent
plasma with higher anti-Ebola antibody levels may have a greater impact on the Ebola
virus load in patients with Ebola disease24. Therefore, the level of specific antibody in
convalescent plasma may be an important determinant of the efficacy of plasma
therapy. Testing and screening plasma with high level of antibody, and applying in
severe or critically ill patients with early stage are expected to improve the efficacy of
convalescent plasma.

Conclusions
Viral NAA test of most patients with COVID-19 who transfused convalescent plasma
turned negative on the 2nd to 8th days after transfusion, and the negative time of
severe patients was shorter than that of critically ill patients. More clinical trials with
larger participants are needed to validate the effectiveness of convalescent plasma.
