Abstract
We develop a new method for estimating the effective reproduction number
of an infectious disease (R) and apply it to track the dynamics of COVID-19.
The method is based on the fact that in the SIR model, R is linearly related to
the growth rate of the number of infected individuals. This time-varying growth
rate is estimated using the Kalman filter from data on new cases. The method is
easy to implement in standard statistical software, and it performs well even when
the number of infected individuals is imperfectly measured, or the infection does
not follow the SIR model. Our estimates of R for COVID-19 for 124 countries
across the world are provided in an interactive online dashboard, and they are used
to assess the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions in a sample of 14
European countries.

Introduction

The effective reproduction number (R) plays a central role in the epidemiology of infectious diseases. R is defined as the average number of secondary cases produced by
a primary case (Wallinga and Teunis, 2004; Nishiura and Chowell, 2009; Cori et al.,
2013). The effective reproduction number varies over time, due to the depletion of
susceptible individuals as well as changes in other factors, including control measures,
contact rates, and climatic conditions. The basic reproduction number, denoted by R0 ,
measures the average number of secondary cases produced by a primary case when the
population is fully susceptible (Dietz, 1993; Chowell and Brauer, 2009). Analogously
to the effective reproduction number, the basic reproduction number is also affected by
multiple variables (Delamater et al., 2019).
In standard models, the number of infected individuals increases as long as R > 1.
Real-time estimates of R are therefore essential for public policy decisions during a
pandemic (Atkeson, 2020; Leung, 2020). Such estimates can be used to study the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), or assess what fraction of the population needs to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity (Chinazzi et al., 2020; Kucharski
et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). Some social scientists have argued that R < 1 should
be viewed as a fundamental constraint on public policy during the current COVID-19
pandemic (Budish, 2020).
In this paper we develop a new method to estimate R in real time. The method
exploits the fact that in the benchmark SIR model, R is linearly related to the growth
rate of the number of infected individuals (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927). Our estimation procedure consists of three steps. First, we use data on new cases to construct
a time series of how many individuals are infected at a given point in time. Then, we
estimate the growth rate of this time series with the Kalman filter. In the final step,
we leverage the theoretical relationship given by the SIR model to obtain R from the
estimated growth rate. We show theoretically that the estimates are not sensitive to potential model misspecification, and they are fairly accurate even when new cases are
imperfectly measured.
We apply our methodology to estimate the R of COVID-19 in real-time. Our estimates for 124 countries across the world are provided in an online dashboard and can
be explored interactively (link to dashboard). In empirical applications, we use these
estimates to calculate the basic reproduction number (R0 ) and evaluate the effects of
NPIs in reducing R for a sample of 14 European countries.
Under our baseline assumption that the serial interval for COVID-19 is seven days,
we estimate the basic reproduction number (R0 ) to be 2.66 (95% CI: 1.98–3.38). Next,

we find that lockdowns, measures of self-isolation, and social distancing all have a
statistically significant effect on reducing R. However, we also demonstrate the importance of accounting for voluntary changes in behavior. In particular, we document
that most of the decline in mobility in our sample happened before the introduction of
lockdowns. Failing to account for voluntary changes in behavior leads to substantially
over-estimated effects of NPIs.

Related Literature
There are two broad classes of methods that can be used to estimate R in real time
(Chowell and Brauer, 2009; Nishiura and Chowell, 2009; Gostic et al., 2020). First,
one can estimate a fully-specified epidemiological model and then construct a modelimplied time series for R (Chowell et al., 2007; Cazelles et al., 2018; Dehning et al.,
2020; Kucharski et al., 2020). Second, one may use approaches that leverage information on the serial interval of a disease (i.e., time between onset of symptoms in a case and
onset of symptoms in his/her secondary cases (Wallinga and Teunis, 2004; Wallinga and
Lipsitch, 2007; Cori et al., 2013)). For example, imagine a disease with a fixed serial
interval of, say, three days. In that case, we could estimate R by simply dividing the
number of new cases today by the number of new cases three days ago. Cori et al. (2013)
exploit this idea to develop a Bayesian estimator that accounts for the randomness in the
onset of infections as well as variation in the serial interval; see also Thompson et al.
(2019). This method is implemented in a popular R package EpiEstim.
The method proposed in this paper attempts to strike a balance between the two approaches mentioned above. Although our estimator is derived from standard epidemiological theory, we use the smallest amount of theoretical structure that is necessary to
obtain our estimator. In particular, the theoretical relationship used to derive our estimator is exactly valid not only in the standard SIR model with constant parameters,
but also in the SIS model and a generalized SIR model with time-varying parameters
and stochastic shocks. Relative to the existing literature, our estimator does not need
any statistical tuning parameters, and it does not require parametric assumptions on the
distribution of new cases (such as assuming that new cases are Poisson distributed). For
example, the method of Cori et al. (2013) assumes that R is constant over fixed windows of duration τ ; τ effectively becomes a tuning parameter that needs to be chosen
by the user. Our approach and its mathematical derivation share some similarities with
the estimator proposed by Bettencourt and Ribeiro (2008).
A key advantage of using the Kalman filter for estimating R is that valid confidence
bounds are readily obtained. Explicitly accounting for the dynamics in R via the state

equation ensures that the estimated effective reproduction numbers are not excessively
volatile, with the optimal amount of filtering estimated from the data. In addition, the
Kalman smoother allows the researcher to use full-sample information efficiently when
estimating R. Finally, our method can be used with both classical and Bayesian techniques, as we demonstrate in the empirical application.

A Real-Time Estimator

We now derive our estimator for the SIR model (Kermack and McKendrick, 1927).
In the Appendix, we show that we can obtain the same estimator from an SIS model
(Appendix A.1), and an SIR model with stochastic shocks (Appendix A.2).

2.1 Deriving the Estimator
The standard SIR model in discrete time describes the evolution of susceptible (St ),
infected (It ), and recovered (Rt ) individuals by the following equations (Allen and Van
Den Driessche, 2008; Stock, 2020):
St−1
N
St−1
It = It−1 + βt It−1
− γIt−1
N
Rt = Rt−1 + γIt−1
St = St−1 − βt It−1

(1)

The model is stated at a daily frequency. Here, N ≡ St + It + Rt is the population
size, βt is the daily transmission rate, and γ is the daily transition rate from infected to
recovered. The recovered group consists of individuals who have either died or fully
recovered. We allow the transmission rate βt to vary over time. For example, individuals
may choose to to reduce their social interactions voluntarily, or they could be subject to
government policy restrictions.
(t)
(t)
The basic reproduction number, R0 , is defined as R0 ≡ βt /γ, and it gives the
average number of individuals infected by a single infected individual when everyone
else is susceptible. Since the transmission rate βt varies over time, the basic reproduction number is generally time varying as well. The effective reproduction number, Rt ,
(t)
is defined as Rt = R0 × (St−1 /N ), and it equals the average number of individuals infected by a single infected individual when a fraction (St−1 /N ) of individuals is
susceptible.

R̂t = 1 + gr(I

(3)

For the estimator to be feasible, we need to (i) calibrate the transition rate from
infectious to recovered, γ; and (ii) estimate the growth rate of It . There are two potential
strategies for choosing γ. First, we can use external medical evidence given that γ −1 is
the average infectious period. Second, information on the serial interval of the disease
can be employed, given that the serial interval in the SIR model also equals γ −1 (Ma,
2020).
To estimate the growth rate of It empirically, we first construct a time series for It
from data on new cases. The SIR model in Eq. (1) implies that
It = (1 − γ)It−1 + new casest .

(4)

We initialize It by I0 = C0 where C0 is the total number of infectious cases at some
initial date, and then construct subsequent values of It recursively.
Given the time series for It , we use standard Kalman-filtering tools to smooth the
observed growth rate of It . In particular, we specify the following state-space model for
the growth rate of It :
gr(It ) = γ(Rt − 1) + εt , εt ∼ i.i.d. N (0, σε2 )
Rt = Rt−1 + ηt ,

ηt ∼ i.i.d. N (0, ση2 )

(5)

We estimate Rt by the Kalman smoother (see Durbin and Koopman, 2012, Chapter 2).
The Kalman smoother provides optimal estimates of Rt (in the sense of minimizing
mean-squared error) given the full-sample information on gr(It ), provided that the data
are generated by the model in Eq. (5).
To estimate the unknown parameters σε2 and ση2 in Eq. (5), both classical and Bayesian
methods can be used. However, sample sizes are usually limited in practice, especially early on in the epidemic. Hence, incorporating prior knowledge generally leads
to better-behaved estimates. The state-space model above—also known as the locallevel model—can also be thought as a model-based version of exponentially-weighted

moving-average smoothing (Muth, 1960).
The state-space model in Eq. (5) can be viewed as a reduced-form time-series specification. The local-level model can capture fairly rich dynamic patterns in the data
(Commandeur and Koopman, 2007; Durbin and Koopman, 2012). In addition, in Appendix A.3, we provide a theoretical rationale for the local-level specification. In particular, Eq. (5) arises naturally in the SIR model (in the early stages of an epidemic) when
the transmission rate βt follows a random walk.
From Eq. (4), the growth rate gr(It ) is bounded below by (−γ). Hence, for any estimator of gr(It ) that is some weighted average of the observed growth rates, the point
estimate of Rt is automatically non-negative. To ensure that lower confidence bounds
are positive as well, we estimate the q-th quantile of Rt by max{0, 1 + γ −1 ĝq }, where
ĝq is an estimate of the q-th quantile of gr(It ). In addition (see Appendix A.4), our empirical estimates remain similar when we use a modified version of the Carter and Kohn
(1994) algorithm which discards random draws violating the non-negativity constraint.
Alternatively, it is possible to avoid this type of truncation by using non-linear filtering
methods (Creal, 2012).

2.2 Sensitivity to Model Misspecification and Data Problems
Tracking the evolution of Rt is notoriously difficult. Human-contact dynamics, testing,
and changes in case definitions affect the flow and quality of the available information.
In this section, we test the sensitivity of our estimator to two notable issues: (i) model
misspecification; and (ii) data problems (such as reporting delays or imperfect detection
of infectious individuals).
For the first issue, model misspecification, a natural concern is whether the true dynamics of the disease are well captured by the benchmark SIR model. We address this
issue in two ways. First, we show that our estimator remains exactly valid in the SIS
model in which individuals do not obtain immunity (Appendix A.1) and a generalized
SIR model with stochastic shocks (Appendix A.2). In addition, provided that the average duration of infectiousness is correctly specified, we find that our estimator yields
accurate results even when the true model is SEIR rather than SIR (Appendix A.5). Second, we note that the error term εt in the state-space model described by Eq. (5) can be
interpreted as model error. Therefore, our estimates as well as their confidence intervals
explicitly account for (some amount of) potential misspecification.
The second issue relates to data reliability. For COVID-19, testing constraints and
high asymptomatic prevalence (Arons et al., 2020; Nishiura et al., 2020a; Streeck et al.,
2020), in particular, make it challenging to identify all infectious individuals. The sim6

plicity of our estimator allows us to analytically characterize the effects of potential
measurement error (see Appendix A.6). Furthermore, we use these results to investigate the quantitative performance of the estimator in a number of empirically relevant
underdetection scenarios using Monte Carlo simulations. Overall, we conclude that our
method provides accurate estimates in all cases that we analyze.

Estimates for COVID-19

We now use data from the John Hopkins CSSE repository to obtain real-time estimates
of Rt for COVID-19 (Dong et al., 2020). In our estimations, we include all countries for
which we have at least 20 daily observations after the cumulative number of confirmed
COVID-19 cases reaches 100. Our sample period starts on 2020-01-23 and finishes on
2020-05-06. Appendix A.7 describes the details of the estimation procedure. Table A.5
in the Appendix contains the GATHER checklist (Stevens et al., 2016), summarizing
the details of the analysis.
For the baseline estimates, we assume that people are infectious for γ −1 = 7 days
on average, similarly to Maier and Brockmann (2020) and Prem et al. (2020). This
assumption is consistent with the evidence on the serial interval of COVID-19. For
example, Flaxman et al. (2020) use an average serial interval of 6.5 days. Recent studies
find that estimates of the serial interval for COVID-19 generally range between 4 and
9 days (Nishiura et al., 2020b; Park et al., 2020; Sanche et al., 2020). In addition, we
document that γ −1 = 7 leads to estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0 ) that
are in line with the recent estimates in the literature (Liu et al., 2020). However, we also
investigate the effects of different choices for γ on our results. In general, by virtue of
Eq. (3), changing γ tilts the estimates of Rt around one, with higher values of the serial
interval pushing the estimates away from one and lower values pushing the estimates
towards one. For example, if R̂t = 1.5 for γ −1 = 7 days, increasing the serial interval
to 8 days increases the estimate to R̂t ≈ 1.57. Conversely, if R̂t = 0.5 for γ −1 = 7
days, increasing the serial interval to 8 days decreases the estimate to R̂t ≈ 0.43.
In Appendix A.8, we perform two empirical validation exercises of our estimates.
First, we document that our estimates of Rt are predictive of future deaths. Given that
deaths are arguably more accurately measured, this finding alleviates concerns regarding potential data reliability issues that could contaminate our estimates. Second, we
find that past mobility data is predictive of future values of Rt . In Appendix A.10, we
additionally compare our estimates to those obtained using the method of Cori et al.
(2013). We find that our estimates are highly correlated to the estimates produced by
the Cori et al method, with the average correlation coefficient across different countries

equal to 0.80 (median: 0.89). Jointly, these exercises suggest that our estimates contain
valuable information on the dynamics of COVID-19.

3.1 Estimated Effective Reproduction Numbers
Our estimates of Rt for selected countries are shown in Figure 1. Estimates for the
remaining countries can be found in the associated online dashboard.
The top panel of Figure 1 plots the estimated effective reproduction numbers for
China, Italy, and the US. In the Appendix (Figure A.7), we also provide a graph of the
raw data on the growth rate of the number of infected individuals that is used for estimating Rt . For all three countries, the estimated Rt is initially above 3. For China,
the estimated Rt declined rapidly, falling below one around the third week of February. According to our estimates, Rt in China fell below one 24 days after the beginning of the epidemic in the country (with the start of the epidemic defined as reaching
100 cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19). However, the estimated Rt in China
drifted up towards one during late March and early April, potentially caused by a wave
of imported cases. Note that there is an upwards jump in the estimated Rt for China
around the second week of February. This jump was caused by a temporary change in
COVID-19 case definitions in the Hubei province in China; the new definition included
clinically-diagnosed COVID-19 cases (Tsang et al., 2020).
In Italy, the estimated Rt fell steadily since March but at a slower rate than previously
observed in China, with the point estimate for Italy falling below one in early April.
Our estimates indicate that it took 36 days for Rt to fall below one after the start of the
epidemic in Italy. In the US, the point estimates of Rt were fairly flat in the first two
weeks of the epidemic, hovering around 3.5. We note, however, that it is likely that the
fraction of non-detected cases in the US went down substantially in this period, inflating
the estimates of Rt upward (see Appendix A.6). In particular, the daily number of tests
conducted in the U.S went up dramatically during this period, increasing by a factor of
45 between March 8, 2020 and March 25, 2020 (Our World in Data, 2020). It took 52
days for the estimated Rt to fall below one for the first time in the US after the start of
the epidemic, or more than twice as long as in China. The point estimate of Rt in the
US at the end of the sample is below one and equal to 0.92 (95% CI: 0.17–1.66).
The bottom panel of Figure 1 plots the estimated effective reproduction numbers
for Brazil, India, and Germany. The pattern observed in Germany is similar to that
previously seen in Italy and the United States. The estimated Rt in Germany falls below
one 37 days after the beginning of the pandemic, almost identically to Italy. In Brazil
and India, the point estimates of Rt are lower at the beginning of the pandemic than in

the other countries plotted here. The effective reproduction numbers at the beginning of
the epidemic are estimated to be 2.13 (95% CI: 0.81–3.04) in Brazil, and 1.78 (95% CI:
0.92–2.41) in India. In contrast, for example, Rt is estimated to be 2.86 (95% CI: 1.91–
3.81) in Germany at the beginning of the pandemic. We emphasize that the estimated
confidence bounds are wide, indicating substantial uncertainty about the true values of
Rt . Hence, substantial caution must be exercised when comparing the estimates of Rt
across countries and over time.
A natural concern with any estimator of Rt applied to COVID-19 is that the estimator may be biased if only a fraction of all COVID-19 cases is detected. In the Appendix
(Appendix A.6), we study the performance of our estimator under various assumptions
on the reporting of COVID-19 cases. We show analytically that our estimator remains
exactly valid even when only a fraction of all cases is detected (e.g., 10% of all cases
are detected), provided that the fraction of all cases detected is constant over time. The
estimates are also accurate under some other cases of misreporting. However, if the
fraction of detected COVID-19 cases changes a lot over short windows of time, the
estimator is biased. Finally, we investigate the performance of our estimator in a number of additional cases of imperfect reporting (such as a ramp-up in testing) that may
be important in practice using Monte Carlo simulations. Overall, we conclude that our
estimator is robust to potential mismeasurement of COVID-19 cases in a number of
empirically-relevant scenarios.
In the Appendix (Figure A.8), we illustrate the difference between estimates of Rt
for China obtained by the Kalman smoother—as in our baseline estimation—and the
Kalman filter. Intuitively, the Kalman smoother uses information from the full sample
when estimating Rt , while the Kalman filter only uses information up to and including time t (Durbin and Koopman, 2012). As seen in the graph, while the two sets of
estimates are fairly similar, the filtered estimates are substantially more volatile. In addition, the filtered estimates generally have wider credible bounds. As should be the
case, the filtered and smoothed estimates are identical at the endpoint of the sample.
From the perspective of epidemiological theory, the Kalman filter essentially produces
what Fraser (2007) refers to as the instantaneous reproduction number, while the Kalman
smoother yields the case reproduction number. The estimator proposed in the present
paper therefore allows researchers to estimate the two types of reproduction numbers in
a single unified framework.
In Figure A.8 in the Appendix, we also demonstrate the difference between our
Bayesian estimates of Rt and classical estimates obtained via maximum likelihood. For
China, the two sets of estimates are virtually indistinguishable, indicating that the chosen priors have a small effect on the estimates. Of course, for other some countries in

Notes: Estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0 ) for a sample of 14 European countries. The countries included in the sample are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands,
Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom. The basic reproduction number

epidemic, where the start of the epidemic is defined as the day when the cumulative number of cases
reaches 100.

our sample, the data are less informative, and hence the priors have a more pronounced
effect.

3.2 Basic Reproduction Number
We now use our estimates of Rt to measure the basic reproduction number (R0 ), i.e.,
the average number of individuals infected by a single infectious individual when the
population is fully susceptible. We estimate R0 by the average value of Rt in the first
week of the epidemic.
Table 1 shows the results for a sample of 14 European countries (Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom), as in Flaxman et al. (2020). Under our baseline
assumption that the individuals are infectious for 7 days on average (γ = 1/7), we obtain
an estimate of R0 = 2.66 (95% CI: 1.98–3.38). For COVID-19, a recent meta-study
has estimated a median R0 of 2.79 (Liu et al., 2020), suggesting that our results are
consistent with the current consensus estimates.
Table 1 also provides the estimated R0 under different assumptions on the duration
of infectiousness (or, equivalently in the SIR model, the average serial interval). As
expected, the median estimate is sensitive to the choice of γ; we find an additional day
of infectiousness increases R0 by around 0.3.

3.3 Assessing Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions
Finally, we use our estimates to assess the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions
(NPIs) in the same sample of 14 European countries as in Section 3.2. We study a total of

five NPIs: (i) lockdowns; (ii) bans of public events; (iii) school closures; (iv) mandated
self-isolation when exhibiting symptoms; and (e) social distancing measures. We adopt
the definitions of NPIs and their introduction dates provided by Flaxman et al. (2020).
We first perform an event-study exercise, inspired by event studies commonly used
in economics and finance (MacKinlay, 1997). In this exercise, we compare the dynamics
of the effective reproduction number before and after the introduction of a particular
control measure. If the control measure is effective, we expect to observe a difference
in the behavior of Rt after its introduction. The difference may appear as either a change
in levels (“jump”) or a change in trends (“kink”); the latter possibility is more likely in
the present empirical context. This simple before-versus-after comparison is not free
of potential bias. In particular, the comparison implicitly assumes that the behavior of
Rt before the intervention provides a good counterfactual for the (unobserved) future
behavior of Rt in the absence of the intervention. Nevertheless, we find this exercise
instructive as a preliminary step in our analysis.
Figure 2a plots the estimated values of Rt one week before and three weeks after
the introduction of a lockdown. Since Sweden did not have a lockdown in the sample
period considered, the figure is constructed using data from 13 countries. Rt declines
substantially after a lockdown is introduced, going from 2.11 (95% CI: 1.84–2.38) on
the day of the intervention to 0.99 (95% CI: 0.87–1.11) three weeks later. However, Rt
is decreasing before the lockdown as well. In particular, there is no visually detectible
break in the slope of Rt in the three-week period after the introduction of the lockdown
(i.e., no “kink”). In the Appendix, we show that other NPIs follow a similar pattern.
In particular, we document the behavior of Rt around the introduction of public-event
bans (Figure A.10), case-based measures (such as self-isolation whenever feeling ill and
experiencing fever; Figure A.11), school closures (Figure A.12), and social-distancing
measures (Figure A.13). Except for school closures and public-event bans, there is no
visually apparent break in the trend of Rt around the date of the policy intervention.
To further investigate the behavior of Rt in the four-week window around lockdowns, we use mobility data from Google’s “COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports”
(Google, 2020). Google uses smartphone location data to measure changes in mobility
(relative to pre-pandemic levels) for six six types of places: (i) groceries and pharmacies; (ii) parks; (iii) transit stations; (iv) retail and recreation; (v) residential; and (vi)
workplaces. Since these measures are strongly correlated, we take the first principal
component of the six time series to construct an overall mobility index. The first principal component explains 83.03% of the total variation in Google’s mobility data.
Figure 2b shows that most of the decline in mobility occurs before the imposition of
the lockdown, and remains low thereafter. This finding shows a clear change in people’s

behavior in the early days of the pandemic. Shifting habits before the introduction of
NPIs is consistent with the existence of private motives that can induce a reduction in
mobility as people avoid becoming infected (Farboodi et al., 2020; Guerrieri et al., 2020;
Krüger et al., 2020). Our results are also consistent with empirical evidence for the U.S
and anecdotal reports from Sweden (Farboodi et al., 2020; The New York Times, 2020).
The documented relationship between Rt and mobility does not necessarily constitute
evidence against the effectiveness of lockdowns. On the contrary, it is possible that
lockdowns reinforce attitudes towards disease-awareness and self-isolation, helping to
ensure lower values of Rt in the long run.
A potential concern with the evidence in Figure 2a is that our estimates of Rt use information from the full sample. Hence, estimates of Rt before the lockdown implicitly
depend on the estimates of Rt after the lockdown. This feature of the estimation procedure may result in low statistical power to detect any effects of NPIs. To investigate
this possibility, we conduct a power analysis (Appendix A.9). Given our empirical estimates of signal-to-noise ratios, we find that the statistical procedure appears sufficiently
powerful to detect moderate changes in Rt .
To assess the effects of NPIs more formally, we employ the following fixed-effect
regressions (Table 2). Specifically, we regress Rt on a set of indicator variables capturing interventions and different types of fixed effects:
log(Ri,t ) = (fixed effects) +

5
X

(j)

βi NPIi,t + ui,t ,

j=1
(j)

where ui,t denotes the stochastic error term of the regression. The NPIi,t is an indicator
variable that equals 1 after the j-th NPI is introduced, and zero before its introduction.
The index i denotes countries, and t stands for the number of days since the outbreak of
the epidemic.
Column (1) of Table 2 provides estimated effects of NPIs when only country fixed effects are included. We observe a strong negative effect of lockdowns, social distancing,
and measures of self isolation. Taken at face value, the estimates suggest that lockdowns
reduce Rt by 65%. School closures are not statistically significant in this specification.
These regressions as well the point estimates are similar to the statistical analysis performed by Flaxman et al. (2020).
The regression with country fixed effects only, however, is likely misspecified. Implicitly, such a specification assumes that the only reason Rt can fall is because of introduction of NPIs. However, Rt would likely trend downwards even in the absence of any
public policy interventions. First, Rt tends to fall during an epidemic as the number of

Notes: Results of panel-data regressions of the (log of) effective reproduction number (Rt ) on indicator
variables that are equal to 1 after the introduction of a non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) and 0 before the introduction. The sample consists of 14 European countries studied by Flaxman et al. (2020).
Regressions always include country fixed effects; regressions in columns (2)–(4) also include days-sinceoutbreak fixed effects. Outbreak is defined as the date on which 100 cases of COVID-19 are reached.
The regression with mobility controls in (3) includes the one- and two-week lags of the mobility index,
constructed from Google (2020); see Appendix A.8 for details. The regression with testing controls in (4)
controls for the change in the number of daily tests per capita conducted in the country. To allow for reasonably precise estimation of days-since-outbreak fixed effects, we only consider days after the outbreak
for which we have data for at least 5 countries. Heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors in parentheses.

susceptibles is depleted. Second, people may adjust their behavior even in the absence
of any policy measures. Failing to control for the dynamics of Rt in the absence of NPIs
therefore likely leads to an over-estimation of the effects of NPIs.
We acknowledge that obtaining credible counterfactuals in the present empirical

context is extremely challenging. However, we can exploit the panel structure of the
dataset to reduce the potential issues in the previous specification. We do so by including days-since-outbreak fixed effects. Intuitively, with such fixed effects we are
comparing Rt ’s in two countries (e.g., country A and country B) that are both five days
from the outbreak (say), with a school closure in country A but not in country B.
The results from the regression with days-since-outbreak fixed effects are shown in
column (2). The coefficient for lockdowns becomes substantially smaller in absolute
value and less statistically significant. The coefficients for self-isolation and socialdistancing measures are also reduced and lose some of their statistical significance. The
coefficient for public events is highly statistically significant but positive rather than
negative. A naïve interpretation would suggest that banning public events has a positive effect on Rt . More likely, however, is that the positive coefficient is due to countries
where Rt is declining more slowly being faster to ban public events. In the Appendix
(Table A.4), we show that the results remain similar when the NPIs are included separately, reducing concerns about potential multicollinearity problems between the different NPI variables.
In column (3), we also include lagged mobility variables as additional controls. With
mobility controls, the coefficient on lockdowns is further reduced. School closures and
social-distancing measures are estimated to have a statistically-significant negative effect on Rt , with reducing Rt by 18% and 11%, respectively.
A potential concern is that countries may introduce NPIs and simultaneously increase the number of tests for COVID-19 that they perform. To help alleviate this concern, in column (4) we add the change in the daily number of tests per capita as an additional explanatory variable. The data on daily tests per capita comes from Our World in
Data (Our World in Data, 2020). With testing controls, most coefficients are no longer
statistically significant. Note, however, that the sample size is reduced significantly as
we do not have testing data for all countries in the sample.
We caution readers against over-interpreting the results of this section. Obtaining
unbiased estimates of the true causal impact of NPIs is exceptionally challenging. As
a result, even our best estimates might still suffer from statistical issues such as unobservable confounding variables or simultaneity bias. In particular, the timing of NPIs
is not random. Countries that introduced NPIs earlier likely did so because they had
previously observed a stubbornly high Rt . In that case, the dependent and independent
variables would be simultaneously determined, yielding biased estimates. Moreover,
since we cannot directly observe peoples’ attitudes towards COVID-19 or government
policies, we cannot control for other variables affecting human behavior. These potential issues notwithstanding, we find that people adjusted their mobility patterns before

the introduction of lockdowns. We believe that these findings bolster the importance of
accounting for changes in human behavior when evaluating the effects of NPIs.

Conclusions and Limitations

In this paper we develop a new way to estimate the effective reproduction number of an
infectious disease (R). Our estimation method exploits a structural mapping between
R and the growth rate of the number of infected individuals derived from the basic SIR
model. The new methodology is straightforward to apply in practice, and according to
our simulation checks, it yields accurate estimates. We use the new method to track R of
COVID-19 around the world, and assess the effectiveness of public policy interventions
in a sample of European countries.
The current paper faces several limitations. First, a local-level specification for the
growth rate implicitly assumes that the growth rate of the number of infected individuals
remains forever in flux. However, in the long-run, this growth rate must converge to
zero. Since our model does not capture this feature, it seems likely that our estimated
confidence bounds are overly conservative in the late stages of an epidemic. Second,
when applying the model to cross-country data, one may achieve important gains in
statistical efficiency if the model is estimated jointly for all countries (for example, by
estimating a multivariate local-level model). Finally, for assessing the effects of NPIs
more accurately, it would be desirable to collect data for a larger sample of countries.
Our estimates of R for COVID-19 are based on a structural relationship derived from
the SIR model. By using the SIR model, we omit some features of the disease that are
likely important when modeling its spread. In particular, the SIR model abstracts away
from incubation periods as well as transmission during the incubation period. Nevertheless, we prefer the SIR specification, for two reasons. First, in simulations, we find that
our estimator produces accurate estimates even when the true model is SEIR rather than
SIR (Appendix A.5). Second, we believe that the SIR model is likely to produce more
reliable estimates in practice. To use the SEIR model, we would have to estimate the
number of currently exposed individuals. Doing so would triple the number of model
parameters. In particular, we would have to calibrate the (i) average duration of the
incubation period (κ−1 ); and (ii) relative infectiousness of exposed and infectious individuals (ϵ); see Appendix A.5 for details. While κ is arguably constant across countries,
ϵ is unlikely to be fixed over countries and over time. For example, greater mask usage
is likely to reduce ϵ by differentially affecting transmission by symptomatic and pre- or
asymptomatic individuals. Allowing for such time variation in ϵ, in addition to timevarying transmission rates (βt ), is challenging. That said, it is possible to extend this

paper’s ideas to models that are richer than the SIR model. Doing so may be an exciting
avenue for future research.
Relative to existing methods for estimating R, we combine basic epidemiological
theory with standard time-series filtering techniques, particularly Kalman filtering. This
approach leads to a transparent closed-form estimator. The simplicity of the estimator
allows us to study some of its properties analytically (e.g., the effects of potential data
problems). Differently from most existing approaches, our method can be applied using
both Bayesian and frequentist techniques, and it does not require any tuning parameters
beyond specifying the average serial interval. On the other hand, relative to less structural approaches such as that of Cori et al. (2013), our estimator may be more sensitive to
potential model misspecification. Empirically, we find that our estimates and estimates
obtained by the Cori et al. (2013) method are highly positively correlated (average correlation: 0.80). However, the correlations are not perfect, suggesting that there is value in
combining both estimators when tracking infectious diseases. Hence, our methodology
brings an additional instrument to the researcher’s toolbox.
In our empirical application, we find that lockdowns, measures of self-isolation,
and social distancing all have statistically significant effects on reducing R of COVID19. However, we also demonstrate the importance of accounting for voluntary changes
in behavior. In particular, most of the decline in mobility in our sample took place
before lockdowns were introduced. This finding suggests that people respond to the
risk of contracting the virus by changing their mobility patterns and reducing social
interactions. Failing to account for such voluntary changes in behavior yields estimated
effects of NPIs that are arguably too large.
Given that even our best estimates may still be biased, it is important to interpret
these results cautiously. However, from an economic perspective, these findings point
to large private incentives to avoid infection. These incentives can induce a contraction
in economic activity as people voluntarily choose to self-isolate (Farboodi et al., 2020;
Guerrieri et al., 2020; Krüger et al., 2020). As a result, even if countries lift the NPIs
that are currently in place, it is not clear whether people would voluntarily return to their
pre-pandemic mobility and consumption patterns. Our real-time estimator may be used
to track the dynamics of COVID-19 as the current restrictions are relaxed.

Appendix A

Supplementary Methods and Materials

A.1 SIS Model
We now show that the estimator in Eq. (3) can also be obtained when the dynamics of
the disease follow the SIS model. The SIS model, again in discrete time, is given by
St−1
+ γIt−1
N
St−1
− γIt−1
It = It−1 + βt It−1
N

St = St−1 − βt It−1

The only difference from the SIR model in Eq. (1) is that formerly infected individuals
do not obtain immunity after recovery and instead again join the pool of susceptibles.
As is well known, the basic reproduction number in the SIS model is the same as in the
(t)
SIR model (e.g., Chowell and Brauer, 2009) and given by R0 = βt /γ. Since the law
of motion for It in the SIS model is the same as in the SIR model, we can repeat the
same steps as in the benchmark analysis to arrive at Eq. (3).

A.2 Generalized SIR Model
In this section, we show that we can also obtain the estimator in Eq. (3) from a generalized version of the SIR model with stochastic shocks. Specifically, we consider the
following generalized SIR model:
St−1
− v1,t
N
St−1
It = It−1 + βt It−1
− γIt−1 + v1,t − v2,t
N
Rt = Rt−1 + γIt−1 + v2,t
St = St−1 − βt It−1

Differently from the baseline model, we introduce random shocks v1,t and v2,t . The
shocks are i.i.d., and the time-varying support of v1,t is [0, St−1 − βt It−1 /N ], while the
support of v2,t is [0, It−1 + βt It−1 St−1 /N ]. We also assume that Et−1 [v1,t − v2,t ] = 0,
so that the conditional expectation Et−1 [It ] coincides with the value for It given by the
noiseless SIR model. With these modifications, the model can capture rich patterns
of infectious disease dynamics. For example, “super spreader events” can be modeled
either as v1,t shocks or as a spike in βt . The model can also capture richer forms of
population structures than the baseline SIR model. For example, if individuals who are
more infectious (e.g., those with more connections in a network model) are more likely
to become infected first, that can be captured by assuming that βt becomes lower over

time.
(t)
Defining the time-varying basic reproduction number as R0 = βt /γ, and Rt ≡
(t)
R0 St−1 /N , we obtain that
gr(It ) = γ(Rt − 1) + vt ,
where vt ≡ (v1,t − v2,t )/It−1 . Taking expectations on both sides of the equation, we
arrive at
1
E[Rt ] = 1 + E[gr(It )].
γ
Hence, the generalized SIR model of the present section leads to the same estimator as
the baseline SIR model in Eq. (1).
Finally, we note that if γ varies deterministically over time, the equation above remains essentially unchanged, the only difference being that γ is replaced by γt . If γt
follows a non-degenerate stochastic process, then the estimator for E[Rt ] would need to
correct for the covariance between γt and Rt .

A.3 Foundation for the Local-Level Model
When estimating Rt , we use a local-level specification for the growth rate of the number of infected individuals. In this section, we show that the local-level model arises
naturally in the SIR model in the early stages of an epidemic when the transmission rate
follows a random walk.
Specifically, consider the generalized SIR model in Appendix A.2. We now specialize the process for the transmission rate βt to be a random walk:
βt = βt−1 + ηt , ηt ∼ i.i.d. N (0, ση2 ),
with a given initial value β0 > 0. We calculate that

gr(It ) =

St−1
N


βt − γ + vt ≈ βt − γ + vt

in the early stages of the epidemic when St ≈ N . Defining the effective reproduction
number early on in the epidemic as Rt = βt /γ, we therefore have directly that the
growth rate of It follows a local-level model with
gr(It ) = γ(Rt − 1) + vt
Rt = Rt−1 + η˜t

where η˜t ≡ ηt /γ. Provided that the distribution of vt can be approximated with a normal
distribution, we directly obtain the specification in Eq. (5). Alternatively, to obtain an
exact normal local-level model, we could assume that v1,t = v2,t = 0 (no shocks in
the original model, just as in Eq. (1)) but that instead of observing the true growth rate
gr(It ), we only observe gr(It ) + εt where εt is i.i.d. normally distributed mean-zero
measurement error.

A.4 Gibbs-Sampling Algorithm
In this section we discuss how the parameters of the state-space model in Eq. (5) can be
estimated with a Gibbs-sampling algorithm à la Carter and Kohn (1994). Besides being
a natural robustness check to our methodology, this algorithm uses a different approach
to ensure the non-negativity of Rt .
To use the Kalman filter, we need to estimate σϵ2 and ση2 . For the Gibbs sampler, we
break the model down into conditional densities from which we can sample iteratively.
The algorithm is the following:
1. Conditional on σε2 and ση2 , use the Kalman filter to infer the state vector Rt ;
2. Conditional on the sequence of Rt computed in the previous step, take samples
of σε2 and ση2 from their prior distributions;
3. Conditional on the new draws of σε2 and ση2 , estimate Rt ;
4. Verify that each element of Rt is positive. If yes, store the draws of σε2 and ση2 . If
not, discard the draws and repeat step 2;
5. Compute the Kalman smoother;
6. Iterate forward for as many replications as needed.
Finally, we contrast the estimates of Rt obtained with the Gibbs sampler to our
baseline estimates. We obtain a correlation of 0.85 between the two sets of estimates.
Credible intervals are highly correlated as well. Overall, we conclude that our estimates
are similar across different statistical estimation approaches.

A.5 SEIR Model: Monte Carlo Simulation
Our estimation method uses a structural mapping between Rt and gr(It ) derived from
the basic SIR model. While we can generalize the baseline SIR model to include stochastic shocks (Appendix A.2), and the estimator remains valid when the disease follows an
SIS model (Appendix A.1), the model is nevertheless restrictive. In particular, it ignores
incubation periods as well as transmission during the incubation period. These features
are likely especially important when modeling COVID-19.

We now perform a simulation exercise to see how our estimator of Rt performs in
a richer model that accounts for these additional features. Specifically, we consider an
SEIR model in which the exposed are infectious:
St−1
St−1
− βϵEt−1
N
N
St−1
St−1
Et = Et−1 + βIt−1
+ βϵEt−1
− κEt−1
N
N
It = It−1 + κEt−1 − γIt−1
St = St−1 − βIt−1

(6)

Rt = Rt−1 + γIt−1
Here, Et denotes the number of individuals that are exposed at day t, κ is the daily
transition rate from exposed to infected, and ϵ ∈ [0, 1] measures the degree to which the
exposed are less infectious than the infected. If ϵ = 0, the exposed are not infectious at
all, and we obtain the benchmark SEIR model. If ϵ = 1, the exposed are as infectious
as the infected, and the model is isomorphic to the standard SIR model.
We calibrate the parameters following Wang et al. (2020) who apply the benchmark
SEIR model (with ϵ = 0) to study the dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan. In particular,
we use κ = 1/5.2 and γ = 1/18 as in Wang et al. (2020). Then, we set ϵ = 2/3,
following Ferguson et al. (2020) who assume that symptomatic individuals are 50%
more infectious than the asymptomatic (that is, ϵ−1 = 1.5). Finally, we choose β by
targeting a basic reproduction number of R0 = 2.6, again as in Wang et al. (2020). In
the model above, R0 is given by R0 = β/γ + βϵ/κ, implying β = R0 γκ/(γϵ + κ). The
formula yields β ≈ 0.12. Finally, we set S0 = 11 × 106 (approximating the population
size of Wuhan), E0 = R0 = 0, and I0 = 1.
The Monte Carlo design is as follows. First, we simulate the deterministic system
in Eq. (6) using the parameters above. Then, we calculate the growth rate in the true
number of infected individuals, i.e., gr(It ) = It /It−1 − 1. However, instead of knowing
the true growth rate, the statistician is assumed to observe a noisy version of it given by
e t ) = gr(It ) + εt . Here, ε is an i.i.d. normal disturbance with mean zero and standard
gr(I
deviation of 0.10. The standard deviation of the disturbances is roughly equal to the
range of the true growth rates. Hence, the amount of noise used in the simulation is
fairly large. For each realization of the disturbances, we estimate Rt using our method.
As in our empirical application, only data after 100 total cases have been reached is
used.
We investigate two values for γest. that are used when estimating Rt via Eq. (3). First,
we consider a situation in which the statistician uses the correct time that individuals are
infected, given by γest. = (γ −1 + κ−1 )−1 where γ and κ are the true parameter values

Days Since 100 Total Cases
Notes: Estimates of the effective reproduction number (Rt ) when the true dynamics of the disease follow
an SEIR model. We investigate two values for γest. , the transition rate from infected to recovered, that are
used when estimating Rt . First, we use the correct value of γest. = (γ −1 + κ−1 )−1 ≈ 0.043. Second,
we use a misspecified values of γest. = 1/10. Average values from 10,000 Monte Carlo replications are
shown. See text for more details.

of the SEIR model. Second, we investigate a case in which the statistician incorrectly
thinks that individuals are infectious only for ten days (γest. = 1/10). We repeat the
process for 10,000 Monte Carlo replications.
The results of the Monte Carlo simulation are shown in Figure A.1. When the statistician uses the correct number of days that an individual is infectious (that is, taking into
account the incubation time), the estimates of Rt from our method are very close to their
true theoretical values. That is in spite of the fact that our estimator for Rt is derived
assuming that the dynamics of the disease are described by an SIR model. However,
we also show that if the statistician misspecifies the number of days than an individual
is infectious (assuming 10 days instead of the true number of 23.2 days), the estimates
of Rt are substantially biased, especially in the early stages of the epidemic. As is to be
expected from Eq. (3), underestimating the number of days that an individual is infectious leads to a downwards bias in the estimates of Rt early on in the epidemic (when
Rt > 1), and upwards bias when the true Rt falls below one. Overall, the results imply

that the new method performs well when estimating Rt even when the true dynamics
of the disease do not follow the SIR model, provided that the duration of infectiousness
used in the estimation is sufficiently accurate.

A.6 Effects of Potential Data Issues
We now discuss the effects of various data issues on the performance of our estimator.
Reporting delays. In practice, data may be subject to significant reporting delays.
For example, suppose that due to testing constraints there is a lag of ℓ days between the
date that an individual becomes infected and the date on which the case is registered.
In this case, the estimates of Rt would also be subject to delay of ℓ days. If there are
significant reporting delays, one may first obtain, say, one-week-ahead forecasts of new
cases, and then use these forecasts to construct a time series for It .
Imperfect detection. A natural worry with any estimator of Rt is that it may be
substantially biased if not all of infected individuals are detected. Given the simplicity
of our estimator, we can analytically assess the effects of imperfect detection.
Suppose that the true numbers of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals are
given by St∗ , It∗ , and Rt , respectively. Their evolution is the same as in Eq. (1). However,
we only observe It = αt It∗ , where αt ≡ It /It∗ is the detection rate. In practice, α is
typically less than one, although the mathematical calculation below does not require
this.
With this notation, we have that
gr(It ) = gr(αt )[1 + gr(It∗ )] + gr(It∗ ) ≈ gr(αt ) + gr(It∗ ),
since gr(αt ) × gr(It∗ ) ≈ 0 at a daily frequency; the approximation is exact in continuous
time. Using the approximation above and Eq. (2), we therefore obtain that the bias of
the estimator under imperfect detection is given by
R̂t − Rt ≈

1
gr(αt ).
γ

We now discuss several cases of practical importance:
• Constant detection rate (αt = α). If the detection rate is constant over time,
then our estimator is unbiased, and R̂t = Rt . Hence, for example, even if we
only detect 10% of the infectives (but the fraction detected remains constant over
time), the estimator remains unbiased. Note that if the number of tests increases
over time, that is not inconsistent with αt = α given that the number of infected
29

individuals is likely to be growing at the same time.
• Constant growth in the detection rate (gr(αt ) = gα ). If the growth rate of αt
is constant over time, then our estimate of Rt is biased upwards if gα > 0 and
downwards if gα < 0. Note, however, that we are often mostly interested in
the trend of Rt over time and whether the trend is affected by various policy
interventions. The trend in Rt is estimated accurately even if gα ̸= 0. Intuitively,
constant growth in the detection rate leads to a level bias, but the slope is still
estimated correctly.
• Detection rate converges over time (αt → α). The final case of interest occurs
when the detection rate converges to a constant over time. For example, if everyone is detected towards the end of the epidemic, we would have αt → 1. Since
our method uses Kalman-filtering techniques to estimate the growth rate of It ,
transient fluctuations in αt would have a limited effect on the estimates of Rt
later on in the sample. Given that we are often precisely interested in the behavior of Rt in the later stages of the epidemic (when the detection rate is likely fairly
constant), our method would still yield reliable estimates.
To provide a quantitative illustration, we perform a small-scale Monte Carlo study.
We choose the parameters of the simulation to match our empirical estimates. First,
we use our empirical estimates of R for the world as a whole for the first 50 days of
the sample as the true values of R. From these values of R, we calculate the true (but
unobserved) values of the growth rate of the number of infected individuals as µt ≡
gr(It∗ ) = γ(Rt − 1), using γ = 1/7. Finally, the observed growth rate—as seen by the
statistician—is generated as gr(It ) = gr(αt )(1 + µt ) + µt + εt . We use the empirical
estimate of σε2 to simulate εt shocks (i.i.d. draws from a normal distribution with mean
zero). We then apply our estimator to the generated data on gr(It ), using the same value
of γ = 1/7 to back out R.
In the simulation we consider three underdetection scenarios:
• Constant underdetection. Given our analytical results, it is immaterial what percentage of cases is detected, as long as that percentage is constant over time.
• Ramp-up in testing. Next, we consider a situation in which—due to an increase
in the number of tests performed—the fraction of detected infected individuals
goes up from α0 = 0.10 to α14 = 0.15 (an increase of 50%) over a period of two
weeks. After the two weeks, the detection probability remains constant at 0.15.
Again, the precise values of α0 and α14 are irrelevant, and what matters is the
growth rate in the detection rate.
• Stochastic underdetection. Finally, we suppose that the detection rate satisfies

Notes: Estimates of the effective reproduction number (Rt ) when the true number of infected individuals
is measured with error. The true values for Rt are given by our empirical estimates of Rt for the world as
a whole in the first 50 days of the sample, and the standard deviation of the irregular component is chosen
to match our empirical estimates. Constant Underdetection: A constant fraction of infected individuals
is detected. Testing Ramp-Up: The fraction of detected individuals increases by 50% in the first two
weeks of the sample. Stochastic Underdetection: The fraction of detected individuals is stochastic, and
its growth rate follows an AR(1) process. Average values from 1,000 Monte Carlo replications are shown.

gr(αt ) = ϕ gr(αt−1 ) + νt where νt is an i.i.d. normally distributed shock. Intuitively, the detection rate is assumed to be unconditionally constant, but its growth
rate is stochastic and follows an AR(1) process. We set the persistence parameter
to ϕ = 0.75 in order to allow for fairly long-lasting deviations from the average
detection rate. To ensure that the variance of gr(It ) remains constant across simulations (to ensure an apples-to-apples comparison), we suppose that 50% of the
noise in the observed growth rate comes from variation in αt , with the other 50%
coming from the εt shocks. (Here, by “noise” we refer to the variation in gr(It )
that is not solely due to the variation in µt , namely, gr(αt )(1 + µt ) + εt .) Denoting our estimates of the variance of the growth rate by σ̂µ2 and the variance of the
irregular component by σ̂ε2 , we therefore set Var[νt ] = (1 − ϕ2 )σ̂ε2 /[2(1 + σ̂µ2 )]
and Var[εt ] = σ̂ε2 /2. We draw the initial value for gr(α0 ) from its unconditional
distribution.
The results of the Monte Carlo simulation are summarized in Figure A.2. As seen
in the top panel, the estimated average effective reproduction numbers are fairly close
to their theoretical values in all three scenarios. In the Testing Ramp-Up scenario, the
estimates are biased upwards at the beginning of the sample, but the amount of bias is
quantitatively relatively small. In addition, the estimates converge to those in the other
two scenarios quite quickly. In all three scenarios, the estimates are able to pick up the
reversal in the trend of R that happens at around time 30. The bottom panel of the figure
plots the average absolute error of the estimates. As expected, the estimates are least
accurate in the Stochastic Undertesting case, and mostly within 0.25–0.30 of the true R
in the Constant Underdetection and Testing Ramp-Up scenarios.
Finally, in Figure A.3 we provide Monte Carlo estimates of the coverage frequency
of credible intervals obtained by our estimation procedure. As seen in the graph, the
credible intervals in the Constant Undertesting and Testing Ramp-Up scenarios have
good coverage properties, with conservative confidence bounds. The credible bounds
are narrower in the Stochastic Underdetection scenario, resulting in lower than nominal
coverage frequency. However, the size distortion appears not too severe, especially
considering the small sample size.
Imported cases. Our estimates may be biased if the fraction of cases that is imported
changes over time (the previous results on imperfect detection apply to misclassification
because of imported cases, too). If the source of infections is known, it is possible to
correct for the issue by simply not including imported cases when constructing the time
series for It .

A.7 Estimation Details
To estimate Rt of COVID-19, we use Bayesian filtering methods. We employ the following strategy to calibrate the prior distributions. First, we estimate a local-level model
for gr(It ) using a frequentist Kalman filter with diffuse initial conditions. In particular,

33

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.19.20071886; this version posted November 17, 2020. The copyright holder for this

we estimate the following model:
gr(It ) = µt + εt ,

εt ∼ i.i.d. N (0, σε2 )

µt = µt−1 + ηt , ηt ∼ i.i.d. N (0, ση2 )

(7)

The model is the same as in Eq. (5), except for a slight simplification in notation.
The procedure yields maximum likelihood estimates of σε2 (variance of the irregular component) and the signal-to-noise ratio q ≡ ση2 /σε2 for each country in the sample
(with ση2 denoting the variance of the level component). We then use the distribution of
σ̂ε2 and q̂ across countries to calibrate the priors for the precision of the irregular component (1/σε2 ) and the signal-to-noise ratio (q). To ensure that the priors are not too
“dogmatic,” we inflate the variance of the estimates by a factor of 3 when calibrating
the prior distributions. We use a gamma prior for both the signal-to-noise ratio and the
precision of the irregular component, and we calibrate the parameters of the gamma distribution by matching the expected value and variance of the gamma-distributed random
variables to their sample counterparts. Finally, we use a fairly uninformative normal
prior for the initial value of the smoothed growth rate. The resulting priors are given in
Table A.1.
Intuitively, these priors shrink the estimates of the precision and signal-to-noise ratio
for each country towards their grand mean (average across countries). Such Bayesian
shrinkage ensures that the parameter estimates are well behaved even though the sample
size for many countries is fairly small, and the data are often noisy. We use the Stan programming language (Gelman, Lee and Guo, 2015) to specify and estimate the Bayesian
model. In particular, we use the pystan interface to call Stan from Python.

A.8 Empirical Validation
In this section, we perform two empirical validation exercises to check the performance
of our estimates in practice.
Since our estimates are based on data on new cases, they may be misleading if new
cases are subject to significant measurement problems. To help assuage this concern, we
now perform the following exercise. We ask whether current values of Rt help predict
future growth in deaths. Since deaths are likely to be measured more accurately, this
exercise provides a test of whether our estimates contain meaningful information and
are not contaminated by data problems.
Formally, we consider the following regression:
gr(di,t+1 ) = αi + β(R̂i,t − 1) + ui,t ,

Notes: Relationship between current estimates of the effective reproduction number (Rt ) and the growth
rate of the number of new deaths in one week. The data is aggregated to a weekly frequency. Both
variables are residualized to subtract country fixed effects by performing the within transformation. Only
data after the cumulative number of deaths reaches 50 is included in the scatter plot. We include all
countries in the John Hopkins database for which we have at least 20 observations after the outbreak. We
remove data for the week of 2020-04-13–2020-04-19 in China that contain a large number of deaths that
were previously unrecognized.

where i denotes a particular country, and t indexes calendar weeks. Although our original data is daily, we aggregate to a weekly frequency; otherwise, measures of the growth
rate of new deaths are too noisy. In addition, we only include weeks after the cumulative number of COVID-19 deaths has reached 50.After imposing these sample restrictions, we are left with 270 country-week observations across 68 countries. Given
that we have panel data, we can include country fixed effects αi to account for timeinvariant unobserved heterogeneity (such as differences in average age—a key correlate
of COVID-19 mortality (Verity et al., 2020)—or family structures). The relationship
given above is predicted by the baseline SIR model. Specifically, consider Eq. (2). Letting CFR = dt /It−ℓ denote the case fatality rate (assumed to be constant over time),
with ℓ standing for the average time between becoming infected and death, we have that
gr(dt ) = gr(It−ℓ ), yielding the regression equation above.

Mobility Index Two Weeks Ago
Notes: Relationship between current estimates of the effective reproduction number (Rt ) and value of
the movement index two weeks ago (first principal component of the six movement categories in Google
(2020)). The data is aggregated to a weekly frequency. Both variables are residualized to subtract country
fixed effects by performing the within transformation. We include all countries in the John Hopkins
database for which we have at least 20 observations after the outbreak.

The relationship is shown in Figure A.4. In the scatter plot, both variables are residualized to remove country fixed effects. We observe a strong positive relationship between the value of Rt this week and the growth in deaths one week later (corr. = 0.61).
In Supplementary Figure (Figure A.9), we demonstrate that there is also positive correlation (corr. = 0.48) between Rt and deaths two weeks later. We note that while the
average medical duration from the onset of symptoms to death for COVID-19 is longer
than two weeks (around 18 days, see Verity et al., 2020), the duration from reported
cases to deaths is likely to substantially shorter because of reporting delays. For example, Hortaçsu, Liu and Schwieg (2020) assume that new cases of COVID-19 are reported
with a lag of 8 days in their baseline calculations (5 days for symptoms to appear, consistent with the evidence from Lauer et al. (2020) and Park et al. (2020), as people are
unlikely to be tested without exhibiting symptoms, and an additional 3 days to capture
delays in obtaining test results, based on andecdotal reports from the US). Since deaths
are likely reported in a timely manner, if new cases are reported with a lag of 8 days, we

would expect an average duration of around 10 days (≈1.43 weeks) between reported
cases and reported deaths.
As a second validation check, we ask whether our estimates of Rt are correlated
with past movement data, as it should be if the estimates are meaningful. For information on movement, we use aggregated smartphone location data collected by Google and
published in their “COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports” (Google, 2020). Google
provides data on percentage changes in movement for six types of places: (i) groceries
and pharmacies; (ii) parks; (iii) transit stations; (iv) retail and recreation; (v) residential; and (vi) workplaces. Since the six categories are strongly correlated, we take the
first principal component of the six categories (the first principal component explains
83.03% of the total variance in the data). We refer to the first principal component as
the “Mobility Index.” As before, we only consider weeks after the cumulative number
of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country reaches 100. After imposing these restrictions, we are left with 792 country-week observations over 100 countries. Note that the
number of countries is less than 124 because Google does not provide mobility data for
all countries in our original sample. As shown in Figure A.5, current estimates of Rt are
strongly correlated with the value of the mobility index two weeks ago (corr. = 0.63).
For both validation exercises performed in the present section, we include all countries for which we have at least 20 observations after the onset of the epidemic (100
cumulative cases of COVID-19 reached) and satisfy any additional sample restrictions,
as outlined above. If we narrow the sample down to countries with more and higherquality data—such as the sample of European countries analyzed in Section 3.3—the
correlations generally become substantially stronger. Hence, we consider the tests of
the present section to be conservative.

A.9 Power Analysis
In this section, we study the statistical power of the empirical analysis in Section 3.3
using a Monte Carlo simulation.
We now describe the design of the power study. Intuitively, we simulate data using a
stochastic process that is calibrated to match the properties of the observed data. We then
simulate a sharp drop in the effective reproduction number—say, because of a lockdown.
We apply our estimator to the simulated data and ask how often this abrupt change is
detected by the estimation procedure.
To simplify the notation, we use the parametrization in Eq. (7). Optimal nowcasts
from the local-level model in the steady state can be written as (Muth, 1960; Shephard,

where we denote yt ≡ gr(It ), µt ≡ γ(Rt − 1), mt ≡ Et [µt ], q ≡ ση2 /σε2 is the signalto-noise ratio, and ω is the steady-state Kalman gain. Hence, nowcast errors, mt − µt ,
follow an AR(1) process with
mt − µt = (1 − ω)(mt−1 − µt−1 ) + {ωεt − (1 − ω)ηt }.

The design of the power analysis is as follows:
1. We set γ = 1/7, and calibrate the remaining parameters of the data-generating
process (q and σε2 ) using the median values of the empirical estimates from Section 3.3. The resulting parameter values are given in Table A.2.
2. We simulate µt = γ(Rt − 1). We initially set µ0 = 1/7, implying an effective
reproduction number of 2. At time 1, we simulate an abrupt decline in Rt by
setting µ1 = 1/14, yielding a new effective reproduction number of 1.5, or a
decline of 25%. For 2 ≤ t ≤ 14, we simulate µt as a random walk, as in Eq. (7).
3. We simulate the observed growth rate of the number of infected individuals, yt =
gr(It ), as yt = µt + εt where εt is an i.i.d. normal random variable with mean
zero and variance σε2 .
4. We simulate the nowcasts mt . We draw the initial nowcast m0 from a normal
distribution with mean 1/7 and variance given in Eq. (9), and simulate further

Days After Change in R
Notes: Power study of the statistical analysis of Section 3.3 (effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions
on Rt , the effective reproduction number). We simulate an abrupt change in Rt from 2.0 to 1.5 using a
data-generating process that is calibrated to match our empirical estimates in Section 3.3. We then apply
the estimator of Eq. (3) to the simulated data and ask how often the change is detected by the estimation
procedure. The solid line gives the average estimate of Rt , while the shaded lines denote 65% and and
95% of simulations (in particular, the shaded area for 65% of simulations is given by the 17.5 and 82.5
percentiles of the estimated Rt across simulations, and the shaded area for 95% of simulations is given
by the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the estimated Rt ’s). 10,000 Monte Carlo replications used.

values of mt by the recursion in Eq. (8). The estimated value of Rt is then given
by the estimator in Eq. (3).
5. We repeat steps 2–4 for 14 times, to simulate data for 14 “countries”, as in the
empirical application, and obtain estimates of the effective reproduction number
by averaging across the 14 “countries”.
6. We repeat steps 2–5 for 10,000 Monte Carlo replications.
The results of the power analysis are shown in Figure A.6. We observe that in 95%
of the simulations, the change in Rt is detected as soon as two days after the drop in
Rt . Hence, the analysis in Section 3.3 appears sufficiently powerful to detect moderate
changes in Rt . The key reason why the analysis has high statistical power, even though
the signal-to-noise ratio is quite low (see Table A.2) is that data from multiple countries

are used to obtain cross-country averages. This feature of the estimation procedure
reduces estimation error substantially. While the signal-to-noise ratio is fairly low, we
also note that the weight placed on data is that are more than one-week old is only
(1 − ω)7 ≈ 15.2%. Hence, one week after the change in Rt , the estimates of Rt are
based primarily on data received after the change in Rt .
The power analysis in the current section is arguably conservative. Specifically, we
assume that after the abrupt decline, Rt follows a random walk rather than staying fixed
at the new level. As a result, as time goes on, the estimates of Rt become more “spread
out” across simulations, as is visible towards the end of Figure A.6.

A.10 Comparison With EpiEstim Estimates
In this section, we compare our estimates of R for COVID-19 with estimates obtained
using the method of Cori et al. (2013); see also Thompson et al. (2019). The method
proposed by Cori et al. (2013)—arguably the most widely used approach to estimating
the effective reproduction number of an infectious disease—is implemented in a popular
R package EpiEstim.
First, we download estimates of R obtained using EpiEstim provided by Xihong
Lin’s Group in the Department of Biostatistics at the Harvard Chan School of Public
Health (http://metrics.covid19-analysis.org/). These estimates, just as in our case, are
obtained using data from the John Hopkins CSSE repository. The parametrization used
in the EpiEstim estimation assumes a time window of 7 days, and a gamma-distributed
serial interval with a mean of 5.2 days and a standard deviation of 5.1 days. Next, we
merge these estimates to our full sample of estimates. We restrict attention to countries
for which we have at least 20 contemporaneous estimates from each of the two different
methods. That leaves us with 108 countries and, on average, 42.14 time-series observa40

tions per country. Finally, we calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the
two estimates of R for each country.
The results of this exercise are given in Table A.3. The two sets of estimates are
highly correlated, with the average correlation coefficient equal to 0.80 (median: 0.89).
The interquartile range is 0.78–0.95. These findings suggest that the two estimates are
highly consistent with each other, despite very different estimation methods and underlying assumptions.

Notes: The graph plots the estimated effective reproduction number (Rt ) one week before and three
weeks after public events are banned in a country. The original sample consists of 14 European countries
studied by Flaxman et al. (2020). For the event-study graph, we restrict the sample to countries for which
data on Rt is available for the whole event window. Heteroskedasticity-robust confidence bounds are
shown by the shaded areas.

Notes: Results of panel-data regressions of the (log of) effective reproduction number (Rt ) on indicator
variables that are equal to 1 after the introduction of a non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) and 0 before
the introduction. The regressions are similar to those in Table 2 except that the intervention variables are
included separately (one-at-a-time). See Table 2 for more details.

4

Specify the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Identify all adhoc exclusions.

7

5

Provide information on all included data sources and their
main characteristics. For each data source used, report reference information or contact name/institution, population
represented, data collection method, year(s) of data collection, sex and age range, diagnostic criteria or measurement
method, and sample size, as relevant.

Describe and give sources for any other data inputs.

11

For all data inputs:

8

Provide all data inputs in a file format from which data can
be efficiently extracted (e.g., a spreadsheet rather than a
PDF), including all relevant meta�data listed in item 5. For
any data inputs that cannot be shared because of ethical or
legal reasons, such as third�party ownership, provide a contact name or the name of the institution that retains the right
to the data.
