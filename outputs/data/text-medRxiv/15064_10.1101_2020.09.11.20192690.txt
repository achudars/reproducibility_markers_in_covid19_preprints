Abstract:

37

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by the novel severe acute

38

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). While detection of SARS-CoV-2 by

39

polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) is currently used to diagnose

40

acute COVID-19 infection, serological assays are needed to study the humoral immune response

41

to SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 IgG/A/M antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and

42

its receptor-binding domain (RBD) were characterized using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent

43

assay (ELISA) and assessed for their ability to neutralize live SARS-CoV-2 virus in recovered

44

subjects who were RT-PCR-positive (n=153), RT-PCR-negative (n=55), and control samples

45

collected pre-COVID-19 (n=520). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 90.9% of

46

resolved subjects up to 180 days post-symptom onset. Anti-S protein and anti-RBD IgG titers

47

correlated (r= 0.5157 and r = 0.6010, respectively) with viral neutralization. Of the RT-PCR-

48

positive subjects, 22 (14.3%) did not have anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies; and of those, 17 had

49

RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values >27, raising the possibility that these indeterminate results

50

are from individuals who were not infected, or had mild infection that failed to elicit an antibody

51

response. This study highlights the importance of serological surveys to determine population-

52

level immunity based on infection numbers as determined by RT-PCR.

Introduction:
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory

58

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. Asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic virus

59

transmission is one of the biggest challenges with the global pandemic [2]. It is estimated up to

60

80% of people infected with COVID-19 have none or mild symptoms and asymptomatic

61

transmission accounts for half of all COVID-19 infections [3-5]. Approximately 20% of

62

symptomatic infections are severe, disproportionately impacting the elderly and patients with

63

underlying health conditions [6, 7].

64

Laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 is made using polymerase chain reaction with reverse

65

transcription (RT-PCR) to detect viral mRNA from nasal or throat swabs [8-11]. Viral RNA is

66

detectable as early as the first day of symptom onset and peaks within the first week of symptom

67

onset [9]. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, specifically the receptor-binding domain (RBD),

68

facilitates viral entry into the cell via the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor on

69

host cells [12-15]. Most people with a confirmed RT-PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection

70

develop IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies against S protein within 1–2 weeks of symptom onset and

71

continue to circulate after initial viral clearance [16-21].

72

Serological studies have shown IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S protein and RBD are

73

detected in the circulation of greater than 90% of infected subjects by 10–11 days post-symptom

74

onset [16, 18, 20, 22]. Virus-specific neutralizing antibodies, either induced through infection or

75

vaccination, can block viral infection [23]. Although antibodies may be generated against

76

multiple domains within the S protein, most neutralizing antibodies and highly potent

77

monoclonal antibodies target the RBD [15, 24]. In this report, we profile the IgG, IgA, and IgM

78

responses to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and RBD in a cross-sectional serological study

Study Design

84

Subjects who recovered from COVID-19 infection were identified by treating physicians, public

85

health officials and through hospital discharge databases that included hospitals in Hamilton,

86

Ontario, Canada (Hamilton General Hospital, Juravinski Hospital, McMaster University Medical

87

Centre, and St. Joseph’s Healthcare). The study inclusion criteria were 18 years of age, either

88

testing positive or negative for COVID-19 in the RT-PCR, with no exclusion criteria.

89

Participants with RT-PCR-positive results for SARS-CoV-2 and had since recovered (resolved

90

RT-PCR-positive, n=153), and subjects who experienced symptoms but tested negative by RT-

91

PCR (RT-PCR-negative, n=55) were included. Participants were interviewed by phone and self-

92

reported their age, sex, symptom onset date and RT-PCR test date and result. Pre-COVID-19

93

control samples were selected from healthy donors (n=37) and samples sent for the ITP Registry

94

biobank from the McMaster Platelet Immunology Laboratory drawn prior to November 2019

95

(pre-COVID-19, n=483) before documented local community transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

96

Serum was collected by venipuncture and cryopreserved until use. This study was approved by

97

the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (HIREB) and written informed consent was

98

obtained from all participants.

102

Measuring SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

103

Microtitre well plates (384 wells, Nunc Maxisorp, Rochester, NY, USA) were coated with

104

25L/well of S protein (5g/mL) or RBD (2g/mL) suspended in 50 mM carbonate-bicarbonate

105

buffer (pH 9.6). The plates were then blocked with 100µL/well of 3% skim milk prepared in

106

phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 0.05% Tween 20 at room temperature for 2-hours. The

107

blocking solution was removed, and diluted serum samples (1/100 prepared in 1% skim milk in

108

PBS/0.05% Tween 20) in technical duplicates were added to the plates and incubated for 1-hour

109

at room temperature. The plates were washed twice with PBS/0.05% Tween 20 and thrice with

110

PBS. Bound human antibodies (IgG, IgA, or IgM) were detected with 25L/well of alkaline

111

phosphatase conjugated goat anti-human IgG (-chain-specific, 1/2000, Jackson

112

ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc, Westgrove, PA, USA), goat anti-human IgA (-chain-

were washed as before and followed with the addition of 50µL substrate (4-

117

nitrophenylphosphate disodium salt hexahydrate in diethanolamine (MilliporeSigma, St. Louis,

Detecting neutralizing antibodies for SARS-CoV-2

130

Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) were seeded at a density of 2.5x104 cells per well in opaque 96

131

well flat-bottom plates (Costar) in complete DMEM (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-

132

glutamine, 100U/ml penicillin-streptomycin). After 24-hours of incubation, serum (resolved and

133

RT-PCR-negative subjects) was inactivated by incubating at 56ºC for 30 minutes, then diluted

134

1:10 in low serum DMEM (supplemented with 2% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 100U/mL penicillin-

135

streptomycin), followed by a 1:2 dilution series in 96 well U-bottom plates resulting in a final

136

volume of 55L diluted serum per well. An equal volume of SARS-CoV-2/SB3-TYAGNC

137

consisting of 330 PFU per well was then added to the diluted serum and the serum-virus mixture

138

was incubated at 37ºC for 1-hour. Next, the Vero E6 culture media was then replaced with 100

139

L of the serum-virus mixture and was incubated at 37ºC for 72-hours. The plates were read by

140

removing 50L of culture supernatant and adding 50L of CellTiter-Glo 2.0 Reagent (Promega,

141

G9243) to each well. The plates were then shaken at 282cpm at 3 mm diameter for 2-minutes,

142

incubated for 5-minutes at room temperature and luminescence was read using a BioTek

143

Synergy H1 microplate reader with a gain of 135 and an integration time of 1-second. Results are

144

expressed as geometric microneutralization titers at 50% (MNT50).

Statistical Analyses

146

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the IgG, IgA, and IgM binding to S protein and

147

RBD as measured by mean OD across antigen and technical replicates. Differences between data

148

were tested for statistical significance using the paired or unpaired t-test and the Mann-Whitney

149

test. P-values are reported as 2-tailed. Correlations were calculated using standard Pearson

150

correlation. All statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism (version 7.0a,

Study Demographics

155

Resolved (RT-PCR-positive, n=153) samples were collected between 7-211 days post-symptom

156

onset. Median age of the resolved RT-PCR-positive subjects was 49 years (range: 18 – 82) and

157

95 subjects (62.1%) were female. COVID-19 negative subjects (RT-PCR-negative, n=55)

158

samples were collected between 7-246 days post-symptoms (Table 1). The median age of the

159

RT-PCR-negative subjects was 49 years (range: 20 – 89) and 39 (70.9%) were female (Table 1).

160

Eleven (7.2%) of the RT-PCR-positive resolved subjects and 37 (67.3%) of the RT-PCR-

161

negative subjects were asymptomatic before testing.

162

Detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in resolved COVID-19 subjects

163

To study the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, we tested for IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies to

164

the S protein and RBD in pre-COVID-19 controls (n=520), resolved COVID-19 subjects

165

(n=153), and RT-PCR-negative subjects (n=55). Pre-COVID-19 controls (n=520) were used to

166

determine the background reactivity to the S protein and RBD using samples from individuals

167

drawn before COVID-19 (pre-November 2019). The cut-off was determined as the mean plus

168

3SD of the OD readings in the pre-COVID-19 control population. Most pre-COVID-19 controls

169

had only background reactivity for both the full-length S protein and RBD (IgG = 98.9%, n=

170

514/520 and 98.5%, n = 512/520 below established cut-off, respectively). Each antigen and

171

antibody class had a few pre-COVID-19 controls that tested positive for the antibodies based on

172

the determined cut-off. The majority of pre-COVID-19 controls that tested positive within the

173

groups had IgM against both S protein and RBD, 1.5% (n = 8/520 testing antibody-positive) and

174

2.1% (n= 11/520 antibody-positive), respectively. Some control samples were positive in the S

175

protein- and RBD-specific IgA assays: 1.3% (n = 7/520 antibody-positive) and 1.0% (n = 5/520

176

antibody-positive), respectively. Antigen concentration of S protein and RBD and serum

177

dilutions were optimized by testing known COVID-19-positive and pre-COVID-19 samples (see

178

Supplemental data).

179

Of the 153 resolved COVID-19 subjects tested, 131 (85.6%) tested positive for antibodies

180

against SARS-CoV-2 (IgG, IgA, or IgM antibodies against the S protein or RBD, Table 2) and

181

22 (14.4%) did not have detectable antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Of the 55 RT-PCR-negative

182

subjects, three had reactivity to the SARS-CoV-2 antigens (5.5%, Table 2). Most resolved

183

subjects tested positive for anti-S protein and anti-RBD IgG (n=130/153 testing positive (85.0%)

184

and n=119/153 testing positive (77.8%), respectively, Supplemental data). In addition, some of

185

the same resolved subjects also tested positive for anti-S protein IgA (60.1%, 92/153 antibody-

186

positive), anti-S protein IgM (35.3%, 54/153 antibody-positive), and anti-RBD IgA (24.2%,

187

37/153 antibody-positive) and IgM (19.6%, 30/153 antibody-positive).

189

To further understand RT-PCR-positive COVID-19 subjects that tested negative for anti-SARS-

190

CoV-2 antibodies, 22/153 (14.4%) resolved subjects were further investigated. The Ct values

191

from the initial RT-PCR test were obtained for 54/153 (35.3%) of the resolved participants,

192

including 18/22 (81.8%) who were RT-PCR-positive but antibody-negative. The Ct values for

193

the RT-PCR-positive/antibody-negative subjects (n=18) ranged from 16.00 to 37.38, with a

194

mean of 32.29  4.647, whereas the mean of the subjects who were RT-PCR-positive/antibody-

195

positive was 22.92  5.177 (range = 14.99 – 34.94, n=36, Figure 1A, 1B). Sera from 13 of 18

196

resolved subjects who tested RT-PCR-positive/antibody-negative were collected within 60 days

197

after initial RT-PCR test, within the reported optimal time for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

198

(Figure 1C) [18, 20, 21, 26].

199

During assay validation, 14 resolved subjects (9 antibody-positive and 5 antibody-negative) were

200

tested in the commercially available EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA and the Ortho

201

Clinical Diagnostics COVID-19 IgG Antibody Test. There was 100% correlation between the

202

commercial reference assays and our in-house developed assays. Three of the 14 in validation

203

testing were RT-PCR-positive/antibody-negative and had high Ct value samples and were

204

confirmed to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the commercial reference assays

205

(Supplemental data).

206

Persistence of anti-S protein and anti-RBD antibodies in resolved subjects

207

IgG antibodies against S protein and RBD were detected in samples collected >120 days from

208

symptom onset (Figure 2A)[5, 16, 18, 20]. Anti-S protein IgG was found in all resolved

209

participants collected between 60 and 120 days (23/153 resolved subjects). In the resolved

210

patients collected between 120 and 180 days from symptom onset, there was a decrease in the

211

percentage of antibody-positive samples when compared to the previous time bin (55/60

212

samples, 91.7%). Of the resolved subjects tested >180 days of symptom onset (n=11), 90.9% had

213

an anti-S protein IgG antibody. However, IgG levels against RBD demonstrated a 14.8%

214

decrease in subjects who were antibody-positive between 120-180 days when compared to the

215

groups before 120 days, and a 30% decrease in subjects with antibody after 180 days (Figure

216

2A). In contrast, IgA and IgM to both antigens were much less sustained (IgA - Figure 2B, IgM

217

– Figure 2C). After reaching a maximum in the 0–60 days bin, there was a clear and continuous

218

decline throughout the time series such that after 180 days, the anti-S protein and anti-RBD IgA

219

levels in subject groups declined by 30% and 80% respectively, while IgM levels for both

220

antigens declined by 90% (IgA - Figure 2B, IgM – Figure 2C).

221

Investigation of neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

222

Neutralization potency was measured using a microneutralization assay with live SARS-CoV-2

223

virus. In all resolved subjects, the presence of high titers of anti-S protein and anti-RBD IgG

224

moderately correlated with higher titers of neutralizing antibodies (Figure 3A, 3B, r=0.5157,

225

p<0.0001 anti-S protein IgG and r=0.601, p<0.0001 anti-RBD IgG). Weaker correlations were

226

found between neutralizing antibody titers and anti-S protein IgA (r=0.4507), IgM (r=0.4443),

227

and anti-RBD IgA (r=0.3055), IgM (r=0.3365). Geometric MNT50s ranged from below

228

detection limit (MNT50 = 5) to MNT50=1280. Resolved subjects who were only antibody-

229

positive for anti-S protein IgG but not antibody-positive for anti-RBD IgG antibodies (n=11)

230

either had lower neutralizing antibody levels (mean MNT50 = 19.5, range 5 - 80) or were

231

undetectable. No temporal trends were observed based on this cross-sectional study of resolved

232

subjects, however neutralizing antibodies in resolved subjects were detected as far as 180 days

233

post-symptom onset (Figure 3C). After 180 days, 3/11 (27.3%) of subjects tested for neutralizing

234

antibodies had a level above MNT50=160.

RBD and anti-S protein IgG, and anti-S protein IgA antibodies in their serum (Figure 4A and

240

4B). The levels of anti-S protein and anti-RBD IgG (mean OD405 ratio) in resolved subjects who

241

were hospitalized were significantly higher than the non-hospitalized resolved population (anti-S

242

protein IgG; 5.6670.065 vs. 3.8361.831, p<0.001; anti-RBD IgG 5.2400.8483 vs.

243

2.7581.730, p<0.001). All other antigen and antibody classes were not significantly different

244

between hospitalized and non-hospitalized resolved subjects. When compared to resolved

245

hospitalized subjects (range: 3.209 – 5.831), there was a larger spread in antibody levels in the

246

non-hospitalized population (range: 0.1508 – 5.828; Figure 4).

247

Of the resolved COVID-19 study participants collected, 11 (7.2%) were asymptomatic. Six of

248

the 11 (54.5%) asymptomatic subjects did not produce any anti-S protein or anti-RBD antibodies

249

(Figure 4). Six of the asymptomatic subjects were in the category of RT-PCR-positive/antibody-

250

negative with a high Ct value.

Discussion:

253

Understanding the characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will inform on the

254

seroprevalence in communities and portions of the COVID-19 immune response. We describe

255

initial cross-sectional results of our longitudinal study of quantitative and functional SARS-CoV-

256

2 antibodies in resolved subjects. The expression of IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies reactive to the

257

immunogenic S protein and the RBD varied based on infection of SARS-CoV-2, severity of the

258

disease, and time delay from onset of symptoms to blood draw. We also observed temporal and

259

functional differences in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies based on Ig classes and antigen.

260

Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were found in 131/153 (85.6%) subjects who tested positive

261

in the RT-PCR. In 22 of 153 (14.4%) resolved subjects who tested RT-PCR-positive, no

262

antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected, which prompted further investigation using Ct

263

values. Of 18 samples of whom Ct values were available, 17 had high Ct values (32.29  4.647,

264

range = 16.00 to 37.38, Figure 1D). The variation in antibody response in RT-PCR-positive

265

subjects may be due to multiple contributing factors including the size of the viral inoculum, the

266

genetic background of patients, and the presence of concomitant pathological conditions [27].

267

Studies have reported that after COVID-19 infection in some subjects, no antibodies can be

268

detected in circulation either because they have waned quickly, or that their immune response is

269

dependent on T cell responses [28-30]. Another factor is disease severity in the detection of

270

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Strong neutralizing antibody responses may require more extensive

271

affinity maturation, which is detected more in COVID-19 patients with severe disease symptoms

272

[27, 31, 32]. Therefore, it is possible that the inability to detect antibodies in RT-PCR-positive

273

subjects may be due to an infection insufficient of magnitude or durability [33]. Another

274

possibility can be that the RT-PCR-positive/antibody-negative subjects had high Ct values at the

275

limit of detection for the assay and did not actually contract the SARS-CoV-2 virus. One study

276

showed there is reduced probability of cultivable viral cultures from samples with a Ct > 24 or

277

when samples are obtained >8 days after symptom onset [34], and another study showed Ct

278

values above 33-34 were not associated with cell culture viral recovery [35]. The developed

279

ELISA for all Ig classes against S protein and RBD antigens has a sensitivity of 97.1% after

280

removal of these 17 subjects with indeterminate test results from analysis.

281

Two subjects enrolled in this study were categorized as RT-PCR-negative based on a

282

second RT-PCR test. Their initial RT-PCR test was positive, but retested RT-PCR-negative

283

within 1-2 days after the first result due to the initial test having a high Ct value positive result

284

without any symptoms or contact history. It is possible that some of the RT-PCR-

285

positive/antibody-negative subjects with high Ct values, would have tested negative in a repeated

286

RT-PCR test as well. A study showing repeat testing of the same subjects describes 6.8% of

287

participants who initially test positive, tested negative in a follow-up RT-PCR test [36].

288

Repeating tests can reduce false-positive results, especially in those who have minimal indicators

289

for having been infected. Another way to distinguish possible false-positive results in the RT-

290

PCR is to use a combination of RT-PCR testing and antibody testing to improve the accuracy of

291

COVID-19 diagnosis. One study utilizing rapid antigen diagnostic tests in combination with

292

IgM/IgG detection, identified more subjects with COVID-19 admitted in an emergency

293

department than when the assays are performed separately [37].

294

Conversely, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in three (5.5%) subjects in the cohort

295

who tested RT-PCR-negative. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in these samples may be a

296

result of cross-reactivity of the antibodies with seasonal coronaviruses from previous infections

297

[38, 39]. In the pre-COVID-19 samples (n=520), 11 (2.1%) had cross-reactivity to the SARS-

298

CoV-2 antigens. Additionally, one of the three subjects who was RT-PCR-negative and positive

299

for SARS-CoV-2 antibody was tested in the RT-PCR 113 days after initial symptom onset,

300

which is later than the optimal timing since symptom onset for RT-PCR testing, possibly being

301

the reason for a false-negative RT-PCR test. Taking into account the RT-PCR-negative cohort of

302

subjects, we calculate the overall specificity of the in-house ELISA to be 96.7%.

303

Antibody kinetics reported previously in SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects suggest that

304

titers of the virus-specific IgG and IgM antibodies increase 21 days post symptom onset [18, 40].

305

However, other studies indicate conflicting evidence on whether IgG and neutralizing antibody

306

levels persist or begin to decline in a high proportion of recovered subjects within 2-3 months

307

after infection [18]. Our study found that IgM positivity was lower than that of IgG after

308

infection [18, 38, 41, 42]. Minimal differences were also observed in the percentage of anti-S

309

protein and anti-RBD present in participants drawn at various times over a 3-month period.

310

Furthermore, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could be found in the circulation of some resolved

311

subjects 200 days post-symptom onset. Resolved subjects who were asymptomatic but RT-PCR-

312

positive, had the lowest titre of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

313

Our study used whole live SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the neutralization assay which was

314

able to determine the functional inhibitory capacity of antibodies against all antigens of SARS-

315

CoV-2. Neutralizing antibody titres have recently been shown to wane fairly rapidly in some

316

studies and levels were found to be variable in recovered subjects [19, 21, 43-45]. The U.S. Food

317

and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that the titer of neutralizing antibodies in

318

convalescent plasma should be at least 1/160, but a 1/80 titer is acceptable in the absence of a

319

better match for use in convalescent plasma therapy [46]. Most resolved COVID-19 subjects

320

were found to have developed levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies similar to

321

other cross-sectional studies [19, 44, 45]. Neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies correlated best

322

with a positive anti-RBD IgG (r = 0.5157) and anti-S protein IgG antibody (r = 0.6010) result.

323

However, at this time we do not know what relevant thresholds of neutralizing antibodies confer

324

protection from infection. Of interest, it has been shown that although Fc-dependent effector

325

functions are required for optimal protection, these are often mediated by non-neutralizing

326

antibodies [47]. Neutralization assays are performed with serum, and thus it is not possible to

327

define the relative contribution of each antibody class to neutralizing activity.

328

This study has limitations. Recall bias of dates and symptoms by the study participants

329

may affect the interpretation of timing of virus detection in relation to symptom onset. For

330

asymptomatic cases, the time when infection was acquired is not known. In conclusion, our

331

study suggests that there is a variable antibody response in resolved subjects and a variable

332

reduction in antibody positivity over time. The negative antibody results found in the SARS-

333

CoV-2 ELISA in RT-PCR-positive samples may suggest a varied immune response that warrants

334

further studies. Although serologic tests cannot be used as the primary diagnostic test, they may

335

be used to support diagnosis of COVID-19 for persons who are tested later, outside the optimal

336

RT-PCR window. The resolved subjects collected for this study are part of a larger longitudinal

337

study that will provide further insight on antibody prevalence over time. Further studies with this

338

longitudinal cohort will be critical in characterizing the nature and kinetics of SARS-CoV-2

339

antibodies and their ability to confer long-term immunity.
