Abstract
It is known that severe COVID-19 cases in small children are rare. If a childhood-related infection would be
protective against severe course of COVID-19, it would be expected that adults with intensive and regular
contact to small children also may have a mild course of COVID-19 more frequently. To test this hypothesis, a
survey among 4,010 recovered COVID-19 patients was conducted in Germany. 1,186 complete answers were
collected. 6.9% of these patients reported frequent and regular job-related contact to children below 10 years
of age and 23.2% had own small children, which is higher than expected. In the relatively small subgroup with
intensive care treatment (n=19), patients without contact to small children were overrepresented. These
findings are not well explained by age, gender or BMI distribution of those patients and should be validated in
other settings.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide. In contrast to
many other infectious diseases, children have diagnostic findings similar to adults, but fewer children seem to
have developed severe pneumonia [1]. At present, this phenomenon is not well understood. One of several
explanations might be that infections which are frequent in childhood are protective against severe course of
COVID-19.
There are recent reports about cross reactivity regarding COVID-19. For instance, it was shown that T cell
reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes is also detected in non-exposed individuals [2]. In principal, cross reactivity
might contribute to the heterogeneity of COVID-19 infections: The majority of patients can be treated in an
outpatient setting, but some patients require long-term intensive care.
If a childhood-related infection would be protective against severe course of COVID-19, it would be expected
that adults with intensive and regular contact to small children also may have a mild course of COVID-19 more
frequently, because these adults are more exposed to those childhood-related infections. To test this
hypothesis, a survey among recovered COVID-19 patients was conducted.

Methods
In the context of the Coronaplasma Project (local ethic committee approval: AZ 2020-220-f-S) at the
University Hospital of Münster, Germany, an online-survey of 4,010 persons who recovered from a confirmed
COVID-19 infection was performed. This cohort volunteered to donate plasma with antibodies against COVID19. Most of these persons live in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany. Because only few cases
with severe course of disease are contained in this cohort, an additional group of 9 COVID-19 patients
requiring intensive care therapy at the University Hospital in Münster were included in this survey.
The main question was: Did You have frequent and regular contact to children below 10 years?
Answer options were: Yes, due to my job (in particular kindergarten, primary school, pediatric practice); Yes,
due to my own children; No.
These data were combined with basic demographic data (age, gender), body mass index (BMI) and type of
COVID-19 treatment (outpatient only; inpatient; inpatient with intensive care).

Results
2,112 answers were collected with the online survey (response rate 52.7%). 1,186 records (effective response
rate 29.6%) contained all required data items and were further analyzed. Median age of participants was 46
years (range 17 - 77). 56% were females, 44% males. Median body mass index was 24.7. 82 persons (6.9%)
reported frequent and regular contact to children below 10 years due to their job. 276 persons (23.2%)
answered frequent and regular contact to their own children below 10 years of age. 59 (5.0%) reported
inpatient treatment, 19 (1.6%) were admitted to intensive care units (ICU). 18 of 19 (95%) ICU patients were
males.
Age in the group with regular contact to children (n=358, "child group") was lower compared to the group
without this type of contact (n=828, "nochild group"): median 41 versus 49 years (p=0.002). BMI was slightly
higher in the child group (median 25.2 versus 24.6). The proportion of females was 60% in the child group and
54% in the nochild group. Regarding inpatient treatment there was no difference between both groups: 19
(5.0%) in the child group, 40 (4.8%) in the nochild group. Of note, intensive care treatment was reported by 3
of 19 (16%) inpatients in the child group and by 16 of 40 inpatients (40%) in the nochild group (p=0.056, exact
Fisher test, one-sided). Median age of ICU patients in the child group was 55, in the nochild group 59.5 years.

Discussion
Two findings of this survey are noteworthy: First, 6.9% of a large cohort with predominantly mild course of
COVID-19 (no fatalities, only 1.6% with intensive care treatment) reported frequent and regular job-related
contact to children below 10 years of age. According to the German national statistics agency, there are
approximately 650.000 kindergarten teachers, 230.000 primary school teachers and 15.000 pediatricians for a
country with 83 million people [3,4,5], i.e. approximately 1% of the population has frequent job-related
contact to small children. Our COVID-19 cohort is not a representative sample of the general population, but
the rate of job-related contacts to small children seems to be elevated, which is not well explained by age,
gender or BMI distribution of this cohort. Altogether, approximately 30% of our cohort report frequent
contact to small children, which is higher than in the general population.
Second, in the relatively small subgroup with intensive care treatment, patients without contact to small
children were overrepresented. Again, this is not well explained only by age, gender or BMI distribution for
this subgroup.
This survey has important limitations: Our cohort is not a representative sample of the general population.
Like in many surveys, the response rate is limited and evaluable data was only available for about 30% of the
contacted persons. Data were provided by laypersons and are not validated by medical professionals. And
importantly, association is not causation.
What can be concluded from this survey and what are possible next steps? It is known that severe COVID-19
cases in small children are rare. There seems to be an association of contact to small children with mild course
of COVID-19 in adults. This finding needs to be validated in other settings. An obvious hypothesis derived from
this data is that certain childhood infections might provide partial immunity against COVID-19 and thereby
potentially could reduce the need for ICU therapy in adults. To test this hypothesis, laboratory tests for
suitable pathogens should be performed, preferably with biomaterial collected before the COVID-19 infection.
Candidates for such pathogens include endemic coronaviruses like HCoV-NL63 and -229E, which are
commonly found in children. From a public health perspective, specific biomarkers to predict the course of
COVID-19 before an infection would be highly valuable to identify patients at risk, because even healthy young
and middle-aged adults can die from COVID-19. If cross reactivity with relatively harmless pathogens like
endemic coronaviruses would be demonstrated, this might even become a vaccination strategy - like
vaccination with cow pox helped to eradicate smallpox in the last century.
