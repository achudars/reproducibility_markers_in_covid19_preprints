ABSTRACT

28

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has seen an unprecedented increase in the demand for

29

rapid and reliable diagnostic tools, leaving many laboratories scrambling for resources. We

30

present a fast and simple method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs.

31

The method is based on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) and S protein (SP)

32

via time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) with donor- and acceptor-

33

labeled polyclonal anti-NP and -SP antibodies. Using recombinant proteins and cell culture-

34

grown SARS-CoV-2 the limits of detection were established as 25 pg of NP or 20 infectious

35

viral units (i.u.), and 875 pg of SP or 625 i.u. of SARS-CoV-2. Testing RT-PCR positive (n=48,

36

with cycle threshold [Ct] values from 11 to 30) or negative (n=96) nasopharyngeal swabs, we

37

showed that the assay yields positive results for all samples with Ct values of <25 and a single

38

RT-PCR negative sample. We determined the presence of infectious virus in the RT-PCR-

39

positive nasopharyngeal swabs by virus isolation, and observed a strong association between

40

the presence of infectious virus and a positive antigen test result. The NP-based assay showed

41

97.4% (37/38) sensitivity and 100% (10/10) specificity in comparison with virus isolation, and

42

77.1% (37/48) and 99.0% (95/96) in comparison with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. The assay is

43

performed in a buffer that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and is relatively simple to set

44

up as an “in-house” test. The assay principle as such is applicable to other viral infections, and

45

could also be readily adapted to a massively high throughput testing format.

INTRODUCTION

47

The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has by December 2020

48

claimed almost one and a half million lives globally, with over 60 million confirmed infections.

49

To manage the disease, accurate diagnostic tools are of key importance. Detection of the

50

causative agent, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or its

51

parts is the cornerstone of diagnosis, as the disease presentation is often indistinguishable from

52

other respiratory infections. The mainstay of COVID-19 diagnosis is RT-PCR testing, done

53

typically from a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), while also oropharyngeal or mid-turbinate swab

54

as well as salivary samples are in use. Alternatively, the less labour-intensive antigen detection

55

tests are also increasingly deployed. Antigen tests tend to be specific, but analytically less

56

sensitive than RT-PCR. RT-PCR can detect viral nucleic acid even after the infectious virus

57

has waned, with the individual at this time unlikely posing a transmission risk1-3. Evidence

58

suggests that antigen testing may correlate with recovery of infectious virus better than a binary

59

RT-PCR4. Frequent antigen testing has been proposed as an alternative approach in reducing

60

community transmission of SARS-CoV-25.

61

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped (+)ssRNA virus of genus Betacoronavirus in family

62

Coronaviridae of the Nidovirales order. It contains four structural proteins: the nucleoprotein

63

(NP) forms a ribonucleoprotein complex with the 30 kb non-segmented viral genome. The

64

envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins are embedded in the envelope, as is the spike protein

65

(SP), protruding from the virion surface and generating large surface projections termed the

66

corona. The SP undergoes processing to yield S1, which contains the receptor-binding domain

67

(RBD) initially attaching the virus to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) on the host

68

cell membrane, and S2 that mediates virus-cell fusion. In response to the pandemic, dozens of

69

commercial SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests are available, predominantly of lateral flow or enzyme

70

immunoassay type. Most target NP as analyte6. Of the seven antigen tests having by December

71

2020 received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug

72

Administration (FDA), six target N and one S7.

73

Over the past few years, we have actively employed time-resolved Förster resonance energy

74

transfer (TR-FRET) as basis of rapid homogeneous “mix and read” immunoassays for antibody

75

detection8-14. FRET occurs when a donor and an acceptor fluorophore are in close proximity,

76

whereby the excited donor transfers energy to the acceptor, which then emits a photon at a

77

distinct wavelength. The closer the donor and acceptor are, the more frequent is the energy

78

transfer, with a 50% efficiency typically achieved at a distance of 15 to 60 Å. Chelated

79

lanthanide donor-enabled TR-FRET allows for measurement from autofluorescent biological

80

samples.

81

Herein, we describe a rapid TR-FRET -based method for detection of SARS-CoV-2 NP and

82

SP. In the assay polyclonal anti-NP and anti-RBD rabbit antibodies, each labeled with either a

83

donor or an acceptor fluorophore, are combined at equimolar ratio and mixed with the clinical

84

sample. The antigen, if present, binds the labeled antibodies and brings the fluorophores to

85

close proximity. This results in a TR-FRET signal upon excitation, indicating presence of the

86

antigen. We initially demonstrate the limits of detection for recombinant NP and SP as well as

87

cell culture-grown SARS-CoV-2. We then evaluate the assay performance among 48 RT-PCR

88

positive and 96 negative clinical NPS samples, and compare the antigen detection results to

89

those of RT-PCR and virus cultivation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

91

Patient samples and reference results

92

The evaluation of the SARS-CoV-2 TR-FRET assay was conducted by using

93

nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens collected in saline. The specimens were retrieved from

94

patients with a clinically suspected COVID-19 and they were originally sent to HUS Diagnostic

95

Center, HUSLAB for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing. The specimens were subsequently stored

96

at -20°C.

97

The SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was based on a laboratory-developed test (LDT). The details

98

and performance of the test in our laboratory setting have been described previously15. In this

99

method (based on the N-gene, modified from Corman et al.16), the specimens were inactivated

100

by combining 250 μl of MagNA Pure Lysis/Binding Buffer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH,

101

Mannheim, Germany) and 250 μl of the specimen. Nucleic acid extraction was done from 450

102

μl specimen lysate with the MagNA Pure Viral NA SV 2.0 Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH,

103

Mannheim, Germany). RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step

104

qRT-PCR Kit with 600 nM of the forward primer CACATTGGCACCCGCAATC, 800 nM of

105

the reverse primer GAGGAACGAGAAGAGGCTTG and 200 nM of the probe FAM-

106

ACTTCCTCAAGGAACAACATTGCCA-BBQ3.

107

The SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive panel comprised 48 specimens with cycle threshold

108

(Ct) values ranging linearly between 11.42 and 29.98 in the LDT. The SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR

109

negative panel comprised 96 samples negative in the LDT. Patient data were collected and

110

samples handled according to research permit approved by the local review board, permit

111

HUS/32/2018 (Helsinki University Hospital, Finland).

112

Cell lines, virus isolation and propagation

113

Vero E6 cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing human Transmembrane

114

serine protease 2, TMPRSS2, transcript variant 2 cDNA (NM_005656.4) and as selection

marker blasticidin. Specifically, 1 ml of 0.22 µm filtered (Millipore) infectious supernatant of

116

HEK293T cells transfected on a 10-cm plate 48 h earlier using 30 µg polyethylenimine with 5

117

µg pLenti6.3/V5-DEST TMPRSS2 (obtained from Biomedicum Functional Genomics Unit,

118

University of Helsinki), and 5 µg p8.9NDSB17 plus 2-5 µg of pMD2.G (a gift from Didier

119

Trono, Addgene plasmid #12259; https://n2t.net/addgene:12259; RRID:Addgene_12259) was

120

added on Vero E6 cells seeded onto 6-well plates. Following 2 days of selection with 15 µg/ml

121

of Blasticidin S HCl (Invitrogen), the cells were allowed to expand until confluency, and were

122

subcultured three times. Once confirmed p24 negative, a clonal population of Vero E6-

123

TMPRSS2 cells was obtained by limiting dilution. The obtained clones (N=5) were analyzed

124

for TMPRSS2 expression by immunoblotting with V5 antibody (Invitrogen). The clone

125

expressing the highest amount of TMPRSS2, VE6-TMPRSS2-H10, was selected for use.

126

SARS-CoV-2 isolation from clinical samples (stored at -20°C since the day of collection,

127

not subjected to freeze-thaw) was attempted on both Vero E6 and VE6-TMPRSS2-H10 cells.

128

Both cell lines were cultivated in Minimal Essential Medium Eagle (MEM, Sigma)

129

supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 100 IU penicillin and 100 µg/ml

130

streptomycin (Sigma), and 2 mM L-glutamine (Sigma). For isolation, the cells were grown on

131

12-well plates until approximately 90% confluent, the growth medium replaced with 400 µl of

132

MEM-2% (as above but with 2% FBS), followed by addition of 50 µl of the NPS sample (under

133

biosafety level 3 conditions), and 1 h incubation at 37°C 5% CO2. After two washes with MEM-

134

2%, cultures were kept in 1 ml fresh MEM-2% for 4 days at 37°C (5% CO2), the medium

135

collected and clarified by centrifugation (3,000 x rcf, 5 min), and the cells fixed for 15 min at

136

room temperature by 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by PBS

137

wash and UV inactivation (5,000 x100 mJ, UV Crosslinker, CL-1000, Jena Analytik). The

138

fixed cells were Crystal violet stained, and the extent of cytopathic effect (CPE) scored from 0

139

to 3 (from non-observable to extensive cell death). To confirm infection, RNA was extracted

of each cell culture supernatant, and the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 analyzed by RT-

142

PCR targeting the RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) gene as described16.

143

For TR-FRET antigen detection experiments, we produced a stock of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero

144

E6 cells18. Briefly, 90-95% confluent Vero E6 cells were inoculated with 500 µl of 1:100

145

diluted SARS-CoV-2 containing supernatant (passage 7, approximately 5 × 107 tissue culture

146

infectious dose 50, TCID50, per ml). After 1 h of virus adsorption, the medium was replaced

147

with MEM-2%, and after 2 days at 37°C 5% CO2, the supernatant collected and clarified by

148

centrifugation (3,000 x rcf, 5 min), and stored in aliquots at -80°C. UV inactivation of culture

149

supernatants was done as described above.

150

Human coronavirus 229E (hCoV-229E, kindly provided by Dr. Sisko Tauriainen,

151

University of Turku, Turku, Finland) and NL63 (hCoV-NL63, kindly provided by Lia van der

152

Hoek, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands) served as controls for estimating

153

cross-reactivity of the assay. The hCoV-229E stock was produced by inoculating rhesus

154

macaque kidney cells, LLC-MK2 (from ATCC), with 500 µl of 1:1000 diluted cell culture

155

supernatant (approximately 5 × 109 TCID50/ml) 1 h at 37°C 5% CO2. After virus adsorption,

156

the medium was changed into MEM-2%, the cells grown for 5 d (37°C, 5% CO2), the

157

supernatant collected, centrifuged (3,000 x rcf, 5 min), and stored in aliquots at -80°C. The

158

hCoV-NL63 stock was produced by inoculating human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5, from ATCC)

159

with 500 µl of 1:100 diluted cell culture supernatants (approximately 1 × 106 TCID50/ml) for

160

1 h at 37°C 5% CO2. After virus adsorption, the media were replaced with MEM-2%, the cells

161

grown for 7 d (until appearance of definitive CPE), supernatants collected, centrifuged (3,000

162

166

Antigens and antibodies

167

The production and purification of SARS-CoV-2 NP and SP antigens, followed a described

168

protocol14,19,20. The RBD of the SP was produced in Expi293F cells as described19,20. Rabbit

169

antisera against RBD and NP were generated at BioGenes GmbH (Berlin, Germany): day 0

170

initial dose 150 µg, day 7 booster 75 µg, day 14 booster 75 µg, day 28 booster 150 µg, and day

171

42 final bleed. For affinity purification, RBD and NP were coupled to CNBr-Sepharose 4B

172

(Cytiva) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The respective antisera were passed through

173

coupled Sepharoses packed into Poly-Prep Chromatography Columns (Bio-Rad), washed with

174

20 column volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), eluted (0.1 M glycine, 150 mM NaCl,

175

pH 2.5) with 2 M Tris, pH 9.0, concentrated using Amicon Ultra 15 ml 100 kDa-NMWL

176

Centrifugal Filter (Millipore/Merck), and dialyzed against PBS using Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis

177

Cassettes (Thermo Scientific).

178

Labelling

179

We labelled the affinity-purified antibodies, 250 µg/reaction, with donor (europium, Eu)

180

and acceptor (Alexa Fluor 647, AF647) respectively using QuickAllAssay Eu-chelated protein

181

labeling kit (BN Products and Services Oy) and Alexa Fluor™ 647 NHS Ester (Thermo

182

Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Disposable PD-10 Desalting Column

183

with Sephadex G-25 resin (Cytiva) served to remove non-reacted fluorophores, and Amicon

184

Ultra 0.5 ml 50 kDa-NMWL Centrifugal Filter (Millipore/Merck) for concentrating the

185

labelled antibodies, which were then stored aliquoted at -80°C until use.

TR-FRET assays

First, we set up TR-FRET assays for SARS-CoV-2 SP and NP antigens, by using the

188

anti-NP antibodies. The assay principle and workflow are depicted in Fig. 1. Briefly, antibody

190

mixes with equimolar concentrations of Eu- and AF-labeled anti-RBD and anti-NP antibody

191

concentrations were prepared in RIPA buffer. For setting up the assay, a pool of four SARS-

192

CoV-2 negative NPS samples was divided in aliquots and spiked with either NP or SP proteins

193

at various concentrations. 10 µl of antibody mix was pipetted on a 384-well microplate

194

(ProxiPlate 384 Plus F, Black 384-shallow well microplate, PerkinElmer, USA), followed by

195

10 µl of the antigen-spiked sample. TR-FRET signal was measured directly thereafter and at

196

time points 7, 15, 22, 30, 45, 60 and 90 minutes after the first measurement with a Hidex Sense

197

microplate reader (Hidex Oy, Finland). FRET donor excitation was done at 330 nm and after a

198

delay of 70 µs the donor and acceptor signals were measured for 100 µs at 616 and 665 nm,

199

respectively. TR-FRET signals were expressed as HTRF ratios, calculated as follows: HTRF

200

ratio = emission at 616 nm / emission at 665 nm x 10000. Thereafter, the HTRF ratios measured

201

from the antigen-spiked samples were compared with those measured from a non-spiked

202

sample in the same run to calculate the fold increase in HTRF ratio. Antibody plate

203

concentrations ranging from 5 to 500 nM (half Eu- and half AF-labeled) were cross-titrated

204

with antigen plate concentrations ranging from 5 nM to 500 nM.

205

The ranges of antigen concentrations detectable by TR-FRET (at Eu- and AF-labeled anti-

206

NP/-RBD concentrations of 6 + 6 nM) were then assessed by performing the assay as described

207

above using N and S plate concentrations of 5 fM to 5 nM.

208

To assess the assay performance with samples containing virions, cell culture supernatants

209

containing roughly 107 TCID50/ml of SARS-CoV-2 were used. For initial experiments (carried

210

out in BSL-3 laboratory) infectious cell culture supernatant (undiluted, 1:10, 1:25, 1:50, and

211

1:100 diluted in RIPA) was used. After verifying that UV inactivated virus produced similar

212

results, the negative NPS sample matrix was spiked with UV-inactivated virus-containing cell

213

culture supernatant to yield a dilution series from 1:10 to 1:20480. The samples were tested in

the TR-FRET assays performed as above at Eu- and AF-labeled anti-NP/-RBD concentrations

of 6 + 6 nM.

216

The NPS sample analysis was done by mixing 10 µl of the sample with 10 µl of the antibody

217

mixes (Eu- and AF-labeled anti-NP/-RBD concentrations of 6 + 6 nM). The TR-FRET assays

218

with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive NPS samples were carried out in BSL-3 laboratory and

219

RT-PCR negative samples in BSL-2 laboratory. The signals produced by hCoV-229E and

220

hCoV-NL63 were evaluated by mixing 10 µl (undiluted, 1:10, 1:25, 1:50, and 1:100 diluted in

221

RIPA) of the cell culture supernatant with 10 µl of the antibody mixes (at Eu- and AF-labeled

RESULTS

224

Proof-of-concept for the homogeneous antigen detection assay

225

We hypothesized that homogenous i.e. in solution detection of antigens could be achieved

226

utilizing a polyclonal antibody separately labelled with fluorophores forming a FRET pair. To

227

test the hypothesis and assay principle presented in Fig. 1, we generated antisera against SARS-

228

CoV-2 NP and the RBD of SP, titers >204,800 based on NP and SP ELISA respectively.

229

Following affinity purification, the antibodies were labelled with chelated europium (Eu,

230

donor) and AlexaFluor 647 (AF647, acceptor). In the first experiments, we tested the assay

231

principle by mixing recombinant NP and SP with 1 µM (500 nM nM Eu labelled + 500 nM

232

AF647 labelled) anti-NP and anti-RBD antibody mixtures in the presence of increasing bovine

233

serum albumin (BSA) concentrations. Addition of BSA increased the signal-to-noise ratio,

234

encouraging us to evaluate the assay performances further utilizing infectious SARS-CoV-2

235

containing cell culture supernatants and different buffer compositions. The assay with 1 µM

236

antibody concentrations produced respectable signal-to-noise ratios in detergent-containing

237

RIPA (radioimmunoprecipitation assay) buffer (Fig. S1). RIPA buffer (refer to materials and

238

methods for the full recipe) used here contained 1% NP-40 and 0.1% SDS, both shown to

239

effectively inactivate the enveloped SARS-CoV-221,22, which is why we to employ RIPA for

240

the subsequent analyses.

241

Assay optimization using recombinant antigens and SARS-CoV-2

242

To optimize the assay performance, we mixed the labelled antibodies at equimolar ratio with

known amounts of recombinant NP and SP, and recorded the produced TR-FRET signals (as

244

HTRF, homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence, values) as a function of time. The results

245

showed the assays to produce the highest HTRF values when the concentration of labeled

246

antibodies equalled the concentrations of the purified respective antigens (Fig. S2). Higher

247

antibody concentrations shortened the time required for reaching the signal peak (fold increase

249

2.5 nM of AF647-labeled) it took ~60 min for the signal to peak for both NP and SP, whereas

250

in an antibody concentration of 500 nM, the NP signal peak occurred in 7 min and the SP signal

251

peaked in ~30 minutes. We also tested the assay performances with Eu- and AF-labeled

252

antibodies mixed at the unequal proportions of 1:2 and 2:1, but this did not increase the signal

253

to background ratio (Table S1).

254

We then evaluated the assay performance at 50, 25, 12, and 6 nM total antibody

255

concentrations using SARS-CoV-2 containing cell culture supernatants at different dilutions.

256

We included a UV-inactivated cell culture supernatant to find out whether UV inactivation

257

would affect the analysis. The results concurred with the findings using recombinant antigens,

258

and showed the dependence of the TR-FRET signal kinetics on the antigen concentration (Fig.

259

S3). The results further indicated that 12 nM total antibody concentration enables measurement

260

of antigens over a broad range of virus concentrations, and that infectious and UV-inactivated

261

SARS-CoV-2 produce similar results.

262

Limits of detection

263

To assess the limits of detection (LOD) for the assays at 12 nM total antibody concentration,

264

we spiked a pool of NPS samples with either purified antigens or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 at

265

different dilutions. With purified antigens, the lowest concentrations producing readily

266

detectable signals were 0.05 nM for NP and 0.5 nM for SP (Fig. S4, a-b). With UV-inactivated

267

SARS-CoV-2, dilutions of the supernatant up to 1:5120 and 1:160 produced reliably

268

measurable signals with anti-NP and anti-RBD antibodies, respectively (Fig. S4, c-d). With the

269

10 µl sample volume, the detection limit of the assay for recombinant NP was ~25 pg (using

270

molecular weight of 50 kDa) and 875 pg for the SP (using molecular weight of 175 kDa).

271

Correspondingly, the NP assay could detect approximately 15 and the RBD assay

272

approximately 420 plaque-forming units (converted by using 0.7 x TCID50/ml=pfu/ml) per

273

reaction.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens in NPS samples

275

After setting up the assay conditions using recombinant proteins and cell culture grown

276

virus, we tested the assays in detection of viral antigen in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive NPS

277

samples. We had 48 NPS samples with RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values linearly ranging

278

from ~12 to 30 (Fig. S5), and employed total antibody concentrations of 50, 25, 12, and 6 nM.

279

We observed that samples with Ct values of ≤25 yielded a signal in the NP assay (Fig. S6). By

280

using the optimized conditions with 12 nM total labeled antibodies, the sensitivity of NP TR-

281

FRET assay in comparison with RT-PCR was 77.1% (37/48). The SP assay showed greater

282

diversity; most samples with Ct values ≤15 yielded a positive result (Fig. S6). We also

283

performed an immunoblot to detect NP and SP in NPS samples covering the Ct value range of

284

12.8 to 26.2, and could detect SP and NP in samples with Ct value <22 (Fig. S7).

285

Association between infectious virus and antigen detection

286

To determine to what extent the antigen assays correspond to the amounts of infectious virus

287

in the sample, we subjected the 48 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive NPS samples to virus

288

isolation. Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) has been reported to function in

289

priming the SARS-CoV-2 spike for entry23, and we thus chose to use both wild-type and a

290

clonal population of TMPRSS2 expressing (VE6-TMPRSS2-H10) Vero E6 cells (Fig. S8). As

291

indicated by cytopathic effects as well as RT-PCR from the cell culture supernatants, SARS-

292

CoV-2 was isolated from 35/48 and 38/48 NPS samples with Vero E6 and VE6-TMPRSS2-

293

H10 cells, respectively. Interestingly, the cell culture supernatants from VE6-TMPRSS2-H10

294

cells yielded a positive result 3 to 5 cycles earlier than did the supernatants from Vero E6 cells,

295

pointing to ~10-40 times more efficient virus production (Fig. S9). Altogether, infectious

296

SARS-CoV-2 was recovered from all samples showing Ct values ≤24.5. We then compared

297

the antigen assay to virus isolation from the respective samples, and observed all of the samples

298

with Ct values ≤24.5 to be positive in the NP assay (Fig. 2a). Of the samples with Ct values

299

>24.5 all produced a negative result in the TR-FRET NP assay, and SARS-CoV-2 was

300

recovered from only one (Ct 24.87). By using the optimized conditions with 12 nM total labeled

301

antibodies, the sensitivity of NP assay in comparison with virus isolation was 97.4% (37/38).

302

The performance of the SP assay was poorer; only 8/38 samples with recoverable SARS-CoV-

303

2 yielded a positive result (Fig. 2b).

304

False positivity and cross-reactivity

305

After finding a total antibody concentration of 12 nM ideal for the assay performance, we

306

were interested in knowing the rate of false positive results. To that end, we tested in the TR-

307

FRET antigen assays 96 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative NPS samples. In parallel, we studied

308

the potential cross-reactivity of cell culture grown seasonal common cold coronaviruses hCoV-

309

229E and hCoV-NL63 in the TR-FRET assays. Among the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative

310

NPS samples, only one produced a positive HTRF signal. We reanalyzed this sample with

311

another RT-PCR assay (Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2, Cepheid), confirming the negative result.

312

To assess the antigen-specificity of the signal, we also analyzed this sample using mismatching

313

combinations of the labeled anti-NP and anti-RBD antibodies. All of the combinations yielded

314

a positive result, suggesting that something other than the antigens bring the labeled antibodies

315

together. By using the optimized conditions with 12 nM total labeled antibodies, the specificity

316

of NP and SP TR-FRET assays in comparison with RT-PCR were 99.0% (95/96) and in

317

comparison with virus isolation 100% (10/10). We then set as cutoffs for the TR-FRET assays

318

the average plus four standard deviations of the signals from the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR

319

negative NPS samples (excluding the single outlier). Using these cutoffs neither hCoV-229E

320

nor hCoV-NL63 yielded a significant TR-FRET signal in either NP or SP assay (Fig. 3). The

321

results with the cutoff values selected using the negative NPS samples concurred with those by

322

the arbitrary cutoffs utilized earlier, and are summarized in Fig. 2.

DISCUSSION

324

The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that began in China late 2019 quickly evolved into pandemic

325

in the spring of 2020. After an initial lag in ramping up the testing capacity, RT-PCR quickly

326

became the gold standard of acute SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. While RT-PCR is very sensitive

327

in picking up individuals with acute infection, the downside is that patients recovering from

328

COVID-19 can remain RT-PCR positive over a long period. Antigen testing on the other hand

329

is somewhat less sensitive for detecting the patients with acute infection; however, there

330

appears to be a better correlation between presence of antigen and infectious virus in the NPS

331

samples. In this manuscript, we describe a laboratory-developed test for the detection of SARS-

332

CoV-2 antigen in NPS samples and compare the test’s performance against virus isolation and

333

RT-PCR. The assay is quick and very easy to use, furthermore the assay is rather uncomplicated

334

to set up provided that specific antibodies against the structural proteins of the virus are

335

available. While we employ polyclonal antibodies in the assay, it likely could be set up using

336

monoclonals. The fluorophores (chelated Eu and AlexaFluor 647) are readily available, and

337

the results can be read on any microplate reader capable of measuring time-resolved

338

fluorescence. Notably, we set up the assay in detergent-containing RIPA buffer, which contains

339

1% NP-40 and 0.1% SDS, both of which inactivate SARS-CoV-221,22. Thus collecting the NPS

340

samples directly into this matrix would significantly increasing the end user safety.

341

We set up the assay for the detection of both NP and SP of SARS-CoV-2 but observed a

342

clear difference between the LODs of the two assays with NP being detected at approximately

343

35 times lower concentration. This is likely explained by the fact that we employed an antibody

344

directed against the RBD, which constitutes only about one sixth of SP. The fact that the

345

antibody in use recognizes only a single domain could make it sterically impossible for two

346

antibody molecules to bind a single SP molecule, and thus we speculate the obtained signal to

347

come from SP trimers i.e. spikes. NP is more abundant in both virions and infected cells (refer

348

to Fig. S7), which additionally contributed to the higher sensitivity of NP detection in cell

349

culture supernatants and NPS samples.

350

Performance analysis of the antigen assay using NPS samples from 48 SARS-CoV-2 RT-

351

PCR positive and 96 negative individuals revealed that the NP assay correctly identified 37 of

352

the positive samples, and all but one of the negatives. All the 37 true positives had a Ct value

353

<25 cycles in the diagnostic RT-PCR. Similar to other studies, we observed a strong association

354

between the sample infectivity and positive antigen test result; of the 38 samples that yielded

355

an isolate 37 produced a positive result in the NP assay. We used 50 µl for the virus isolation

356

while the antigen assay only takes 10 µl, which could explain why one of the samples with

357

infectious virus was not picked up. We intentionally selected NPS samples over a broad range

358

of Ct values in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR to obtain an estimate of the detection limit as compared

359

to RT-PCR. The fact that we analyzed samples that were not collected fresh and had been

360

subjected to at least one freeze-thaw cycle may have negatively affected the assay sensitivity.

361

In any case, our test could detect 97.4% of the NPS samples with infectious virus.

362

Because both NP and SP antigen assays gave a positive result for a single SARS-CoV-2 RT-

363

PCR negative sample, we re-analyzed it using a different RT-PCR with a negative result. We

364

also attempted virus isolation from the sample but without success. It is possible that the false

365

positive result is a result of cross-reactivity to a human coronavirus, hCoV, infection. Of the

366

hCoVs only hCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV use the same receptor as SARS-CoV-2, i.e. the

367

angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)24,25. Thus it would be most logical that the reactivity

368

of this sample would be due to hCoV-NL63 because both SP (based on RBD) and NP assays

369

gave a positive result. We did however test the two assays using cell culture -grown hCoV-

370

229E and hCoV-NL63, yet with negative results. It appears that the sample yielding a false

371

positive reaction contained an interfering substance, which caused the immunoglobulins to

372

aggregate, because also labeled antibodies against different antigens yielded a TR-FRET

373

signal. The use of miss-matching antibodies could be in the future serve to discern true and

374

false positives in the TR-FRET assay.

375

In conclusion, we report the development of a rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen test based on

376

simultaneous binding of two or more fluorophore-labeled antibody molecules to the antigen.

377

The TR-FRET –based antigen test is rapid to perform, and its results correlate well with the

378

presence of infectious virus in clinical sample. The assay is easy to set up, if a suitable antibody

379

against SARS-CoV-2 NP and a plate reader enabling TR-FRET measurement are available.

380

We estimate that a single plate reader and an experienced technician could manually analyze

381

hundreds of specimens per hour, ideally with a 30-minute turn-around time from sample arrival

382

to results (see supplementary information for details). The assay throughput could significantly

383

be up scaled by using automation, and alike RT-PCR the sample collection would represent the

384

major limiting factor. The NPS sampling directly to a detergent-containing buffer increases the

385

assay’s user-safety. We envision that the assay could be applied widely in the field, e.g.

386

hospitals, retirement homes, airports and train stations, and in schools to identify people likely

387

to spread the virus.

24 nM and the volume 10 µl. The arrows indicate addition of the sample material, in our set up
either 10 µl of purified recombinant protein or 10 µl of NPS sample. The top right side shows
schematically the antigen-antibody complexes formed following addition of sample containing
the antigen, reaction volume at this stage in our set up is 10 µl. The bottom right side
schematically demonstrates that the labelled antibodies do not form TR-FRET active
complexes in absence of the antigen.

Anti-NP assay results. b) Anti-RBD assay results. The y-axis (log scale) indicates a fold
increase in HTRF ratio (HTRFsample/HTRFbuffer) measured directly after pipetting the samples
on plate. The x-axis shows the Ct value measured in the diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR.
The horizontal black line is the antigen test positivity cutoff, corresponding to the average plus
four standard deviations of the signals induced by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR negative samples.
The vertical black line separates SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive (n = 48) and negative (n = 96)
NPS samples. The coloring in the graphs indicates presence (red) or absence (blue) of
cytopathic effect (CPE) following inoculation of VE6-TMPRSS2-H10 cells with 50 µl of the
NPS sample, black = not cultured. TR-FRET = time-resolved Förster resonance energy
transfer, NP = nucleoprotein, RBD = receptor-binding domain, HTRF = homogeneous timeresolved fluorescence.

Assay throughput estimate

500

Using 384-well plates, 192 samples can be measured in duplicate on one plate. Pipetting the

501

reagent mixes and samples manually on plate with a multichannel pipette is estimated to require

502

10 minutes for a full plate (2-2.5 minutes for reagent mixes and 7.5-8 minutes for samples,

503

longer for the latter due to tip change between samples). Measuring the HTRF ratio in triplicate

504

takes approximately 18 min for a full 384-well plate using Hidex Sense (Hidex Oy, Finland).

505

HTRF ratios are calculated automatically and the results can be exported as e.g. an Excel file.

506

While the measurement takes place, the next plate can be prepared. With measurement intervals

507

of 20 minutes, a single machine and one operator could ideally measure 576 samples/hour that

508

would correspond to 13 824 samples/24 hours, assuming shift work. The throughput could be

509

increased by including automation and additional staff to aid with sample preparation and the

510

transfer of results to a laboratory information management system.

Figure S7. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens in selected NPS samples by immunoblotting.
The NPS samples selected based on the Ct values in the diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR
were separated on SDS-PAGE (4-15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Protein Gel, deep well,
Bio-RAD), approximately 40 µl of NPS sample/well, using standard protocol but under nonreducing conditions. The proteins transferred (standard wet blotting protocol) onto
nitrocellulose membrane (Nitrocellulose Blotting Membrane, Amersham Protran 0.45 µm NC,
GE Healthcare) were following blocking (30 min at room temperature, blocking buffer: 3%
skimmed milk powder in 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) first probed with antiRBD antiserum (1:3000 diluted in blocking buffer), and the binding detected using IRDye
800CW Donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (LI-COR Biosciences), 1:10000 dilution
in blocking buffer. The membrane was then probed with anti-NP antiserum (1:4000 diluted in
blocking buffer), and the same secondary antibody was used for the detection. The results were
recorded using Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). a) The result of antiRBD (detects S protein under non-reducing conditions) staining. The wells are labeled by the
diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR values of the NPS samples. A band migrating at
approximately 170 kDa (indicated by an arrow) represents the unprocessed SP and it is detected
in some of the samples. b) The result of anti-NP staining. The labeling of wells as in a. A band
