Abstract:
In-person schooling has proved contentious and difficult to study throughout the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic. Data from a massive online survey in the United States indicates an increased risk of
COVID-19-related outcomes among respondents living with a child attending school in-person.
School-based mitigation measures are associated with significant reductions in risk, particularly
daily symptoms screens, teacher masking, and closure of extra-curricular activities. With seven
or more mitigation measures, the association between in-person schooling and COVID-19related outcomes all but disappears. Teachers working outside the home were more likely to
report COVID-19-related outcomes, but this association is similar to other occupations (e.g.,
healthcare, office work). In-person schooling is associated with household COVID-19 risk, but
this risk can likely be controlled with properly implemented school-based mitigation measures.
One sentence summary:
Living with children attending in-person school is linked to a higher risk of COVID-19 outcomes,
which school-based interventions can mitigate.

Main Text:
The role of schools in transmission, and the value of school closure, has been one of the most
contentious issues over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is ongoing debate about
exactly how much SARS-CoV-2 risk is posed to individuals and communities by in-person
schooling. While there is general consensus that it should be possible to open schools safely
with adequate mitigation measures, there is little data and even less agreement as to what level
of mitigation is needed.

Many ecological studies have shown an association between in-person schooling and the speed
and extent of community SARS-CoV-2 transmission (1–3), though these results have been far
from uniform (4). While there have been numerous outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 in schools and
school-like settings (5–7), studies conducted outside of outbreak settings have suggested that,
when mitigation measures are in place, transmission within schools is limited and infection rates
mirror that of the surrounding community (8, 9).

However, the ways in which in-person schooling influences community SARS-CoV-2 incidence
are complex. Schools play a unique role in the social fabric of the United States and other
countries, and often create potential transmission connections between otherwise disparate
communities. Even if transmission in classrooms is rare, activities surrounding in-person
schooling, such as student pick-up and drop-off, teacher interactions, and broader changes to
behavior when school is in session could lead to increases in community transmission.

There is also a growing body of evidence that younger children (e.g., those less than 10 years
of age) are less susceptible to infection when exposed (10), though it is unclear if they are less
likely to pass on the virus once infected (11, 12), or if this reduced susceptibility is offset by the

increased number of contacts students make when in school (13). Even when students are
infected, the risk of severe disease and death among teenagers and young children is low (14).
This means that one of the main reasons for a focus on schools is not the risk to students, but
the risk that in-person schooling poses to teachers and family members, as well as its impact on
the trajectory of the overall epidemic. Yet, few studies have focused on the risk in-person school
poses to household members (15).
Different interpretations of the evidence and local politics have led to massive heterogeneity in
approaches to schooling across the United States during the 2020-21 school year (16), running
the gambit from complete cessation of in-person learning to opening completely with no
mitigation measures in place. Most schools that have opened have made some efforts to
mitigate transmission, but there is much diversity in the approaches adopted.

This hodgepodge of approaches to schooling creates a massive natural experiment from which
we can learn about what does, and does not, work for controlling school associated SARS-CoV2 spread. However, there is no central repository for the measures taken across the over
130,000 schools in the United States, nor is there a central repository for health outcomes in
these schools, making studies difficult. Where data are available they are often restricted to
traditional public school systems, though 28% of Pre-K through 12th grade students are in
private or charter schools, and rarely can it be linked with individual- or household-level
outcomes.

The COVID-19 Symptom Survey provides a unique opportunity to collect and analyze data on
schooling behaviors and SARS-CoV-2 related outcomes from households throughout the United
States. This survey is administered through the Facebook platform in partnership with Carnegie
Mellon University and yields approximately 500,000 survey responses in the United States each

We analyzed data collected over two time periods during the 2020-2021 school year (Nov. 24,
2020-Dec. 23, 2020 and Jan. 11 2021-Feb. 10, 2021). Of 2,142,887 total respondents in the 50
US states and Washington DC during this period, 576,051 (26.9%) reported at least one child in
Pre-K through high school living in their household (Table S1-S2, Fig. 1A). Forty-nine percent
(284,789/576,051) of these respondents reported a child living in the household engaged in
either full- (68.8%) or part-time (46.0%) in-person schooling, with substantial variation both
within and between states (Fig. 1, Table S3). Overall, in-person schooling increased between
the two periods from 48% to 52%, though decreases were observed in some states (e.g.,
Arizona) (Fig. S1, Table S3).

After adjusting for county-level incidence and other individual- and county-level factors (but not
school-based mitigation measures; Tables S1-S2, Fig. S2), living in a household with a child
engaged in full-time in-person schooling is associated with a substantial increase in the odds
(adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.38, 95% CI 1.30-1.47) of reporting COVID-19 like illness (CLI,
fever of at least 100 °F, along with cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing), loss of
taste or smell (aOR 1.21, 95% CI 1.16-1.27), and report of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result
within the previous 14 days (aOR 1.30, 95% CI 1.24-1.35) (Fig. 2A, Table S4).

When stratifying by grade level (restricted to households reporting a child/children in a single
grade strata), we find that the strength of the associations increase with grade level, from no
association in households with only Pre-K and Kindergarten students (Fig. 2A, Table S4) to a
substantial positive association in households with only high school aged students.

The association between COVID-19 outcomes and reporting a child in the household engaged
in part-time in-person schooling is attenuated but still statistically significant for CLI (aOR 1.21,

95% CI 1.13-1.29), loss of taste and smell (aOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.13-1.24) and reporting a
positive test (aOR 1.09, 95% CI, 1.03-1.14). Among those reporting part-time schooling the
association between grade and COVID-19-related outcomes is less clear (Fig. 2A, Table S4).

measures) indicating that the strength of the association increases with grade level. (B) Distribution of
mitigation measures by grade level and full- versus part-time in-person status across all grades.
For those students engaged in any form of in-person learning, the most common mitigation
measure reported was student mask mandates (88%), followed by teacher mask mandates
(80%), restricted entry (66%) and extra space between desks (63%) (Table S5). The distribution
of mitigation measures reported was similar between those reporting full- and part-time inperson schooling, though most measures were slightly more likely to be reported in the parttime setting (Fig. 2B). Overall, respondents reporting a household child engaged in in-person
school reported a mean of 6.7 (IQR 4-9) mitigation measures in place at any school attended by
a household child. Those reporting only children in part-time schooling reported more mitigation
measures (mean 7.3, IQR 5-10) than those reporting only children in full-time schooling (mean
6.4, IQR 4-9). There is substantial geographic heterogeneity in the number of mitigation
measures reported (Fig. 1D, Fig. S3, Tables S5-S6), with households in South Dakota reporting
the least (mean 4.6, IQR 2-7), and households in Vermont reporting the most (mean 8.9, IQR 811) mitigation measures.

We find a clear association with the number of mitigation measures implemented and the risk of
COVID-19 outcomes among adult household members responding to the survey after
adjustment for individual and county level factors. Each measure implemented is associated
with a 9% decrease in the odds of CLI (aOR 0.91, 95% CI 0.89-0.92), a 8% decrease in the
odds of loss of taste or smell (aOR 0.92, 95% CI 0.91-0.93) and an 7% decrease in the odds of
a recent positive SARS-CoV-2 test (aOR 0.93, 95% CI 0.92-0.94) (Table S7). Regression
treating each individual mitigation measure as having an independent effect show that report of
daily symptom screening is clearly associated with greater risk reductions than the average
measures (Fig. 3, Table S8), with some evidence that teacher mask mandates and cancelling

extra-curricular activities are also associated with larger reductions than average. In contrast,
closing cafeterias, playgrounds and use of desk shields are associated with lower risk
reductions (or even risk increases); however this may reflect saturation effects as these are
typically reported along with a high number of other measures. Notably, part-time in-person
schooling is not associated with a decrease in the risk of COVID-19-related outcomes compared
to full-time in-person schooling once we account for other mitigation measures.

To explore what, if any, levels of mitigation are associated with elimination of the excess risk

group to schools with 0, 1-3, 4-6, 7-9 and 10 or more mitigation measures in turn (Fig. 4, Fig.
S4, Tables S9-S10). We found that when we limited the in-person group to cases where 7 or
more mitigation measures were in place the risks associated with in-person schooling had
largely disappeared, with complete absence of increased risk with 10 or more mitigation
measures. Among those reporting 7 or more mitigation measures, over 80% reported student
and teacher mask mandates, restricted entry, extra space between desks and no supply
sharing, and over 50% reported student cohorting, reduced class size and daily symptom
screening.

The results presented here show a clear association between in-person schooling and the risk
of COVID-19-related outcomes in adult household members, as well as evidence that
implementation of a moderate number of school-based mitigation measures is adequate to
eliminate this risk. However, in-person schooling and mitigation measures are not distributed at
random in the population (Fig. 1, Tables S1-S3, S5-S6, S9-S10). For instance, households with
a student attending in-person schooling tend to be in counties that are a higher percentage
white (Fig. S2), and contain survey respondents who are more likely to have recently eaten out
or gone to a bar (Table S2). Despite our best efforts to adjust for local incidence, individual
behavior and other potential confounders, it is possible that unmeasured factors are responsible
for the observed associations.

area), (B) quintile of incidence (Q1 is lowest, Q5 is highest) and (C) propensity to report in-person
schooling (Q5 most likely to have in-person schooling, Q1 least likely). Horizontal dashed and dotted
lines show overall point estimates for full-time and part-time in-person instruction, respectively.

To address the possibility that the association with in-person schooling could be the result of
differences between urban, suburban and rural counties, local patterns of incidence, or other
differences between those more and less likely to send children to school in-person we
performed several stratified analyses (Fig. 5). When stratifying by counties classified by size
and metro status, incidence and propensity to avoid in-person schooling, we found few
systematic or statistically significant deviations from the overall estimate of the relative risk
associated with full- and part-time in-person schooling. The notable exception is an apparent
increase in the risk associated with in-person schooling in households with the highest
propensity to have children attending in-person classes (Fig. 5C).

While we were not able to specifically look at the relationship between in-person schooling,
mitigation measures and risk to teachers, we were able to look at the risk associated with
reporting paid work outside the home among those reporting teaching pre-K through high school
as their current occupation. Teachers working outside the home work were more likely to report
COVID-19-related outcomes (e.g., Test positive aOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.5-2.2; Fig. S5, Table S11),
but increased risk was commensurate with the risk of working outside the home in other groups,
such as those working in healthcare (aOR 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-1.9) and office work (aOR 1.6, 95%
CI 1.5-1.7).

The results presented here provide strong evidence that in-person schooling poses a real risk to
those living in the households of students, but that risk can be managed through commonly

implemented school-based mitigation measures. However, much still remains unknown. We
were unable to measure the risk posed by in-person schooling to the students themselves, nor
were we able to specifically assess how different policies impact teachers and other school
staff. This study also provides limited insight into the mechanisms by which in-person schooling
increases risk, and it remains possible that classroom transmission plays a minor role, and other
school related activities drive risk.

Furthermore, despite its size, this internet-based survey is cross-sectional, necessarily short
and subject to response biases; though its size and robustness of the results allay some of
these concerns. We were unable to evaluate compliance with or investment in reported
mitigation measures. Though we adjust for several county-level measures of socioeconomic
status and these data were not available at the individual level, such factors are known to be
associated with COVID-19 risk and attitudes about in-person schooling. Additional, more formal,
studies that span schools with multiple policies and approaches are critical to finding definitive
answers to these questions. However, our results were robust when we looked with strata of
urbanization, background COVID-19 risk, and propensity for in-person schooling (Table 5), and
when we examined alternative measures of individual and household COVID-19 occurrence
(Fig. S6-S8).

The debate around in-person schooling in the United States has been intense, and has
exacerbated differences in approach between independent school systems and individual
families nationally. The lack of coordination has provided an opportunity to learn about the risks
of in-person schooling, and the degree to which mitigation measures may reduce risk. While
online surveys have their unique limitations, the wide reach of the Facebook COVID-19
Symptom Survey has allowed us to gather data from households engaged in heterogeneous

schooling activities throughout the country in a way few other study designs could. In analyzing
these data, we find further support for the idea that in-person schooling carries with it increased
COVID-19 risk to household members; but also suggests common, low cost, mitigation
measures can greatly reduce this risk.

The Facebook Symptom Survey:
The US COVID-19 Symptom Survey is a cross-sectional survey conducted daily by Carnegie
Mellon University, where Facebook provides its application as a platform to recruit participants.
Each day, selected users get an invitation to participate in the survey at the top of their
Facebook News Feed. The survey instrument asks various questions related to health
symptoms, testing, schooling, mental health, and several preventive behaviors in the context of
the ongoing pandemic. It was developed by public health and survey experts, and was reviewed
and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of both the University of Maryland and
Carnegie Mellon University. To provide adequate geographic coverage, stratified random
sampling within US states is used. To account both for systematic demographic differences
between the sampling frame of Facebook users (i.e. the Facebook Active User Base (FAUB)
aged 18+ living in the US) and the United States population, and for bias related to nonresponse and coverage, Facebook employs a two-stage weighting process ((18). In the first
stage, inverse propensity score weighting is used to adjust for non-response bias by making the
sample more representative of the FAUB. The covariates used in this step are obtained from
internal Facebook data, including self-reported age, gender, geographical variables, and other
Facebook user characteristics that they found to correlate well with survey responses in the
past. In the second stage, post-stratification is used to balance the state-level distribution of age
and gender among the Facebook population based on the Current Population Survey 2018
March Supplement March Supplement.
The resulting weights are provided as part of the microdata and can be used to adjust estimates
so that the survey population is representative of the US population -- adjusting both for the
differences between the US population and US Facebook users, and for the propensity of a
Facebook user to take the survey in the first place.
Each time Facebook links a user to the survey instrument, it generates a unique, noninformative random ID number and sends it back to CMU. If the user completes the survey (i.e.
provides valid answers to a given basic set of survey questions), CMU sends back the
corresponding ID number back to Facebook, and in return receives the weight whose
computation was described above. Throughout the entire process, Facebook has no access to
individual survey responses to weight the data, and CMU doe s not receive any information
linking the survey respondents to their Facebook information (18, 19)
There had been eight waves of the COVID-19 Symptom Survey conducted, with changes to the
instrument in each wave including the addition or deletion of questions (19, 20). Our period of
study encompasses Waves 5 to 8. Wave 5 took place from November 24 to December 18,
2020. Wave 6 took place from December 19, 2020 to January 11, 2021. From this round we
excluded observations between December 24, 2020 and January 10, 2021, corresponding with
the typical winter school holidays. Wave 7 took place from January 12 to February 7, 2021.
Finally Wave 8 began on February 8, 2021. We include data up to February 10, 2021.

Case Data:
Case data were obtained from data compiled by the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science
and Engineering (JHU-CSSE) COVID-19 Dashboard (21) . Relevant county-level attack rates
were calculated as the average 2-week incidence from 2020-11-15 to 2020-12-27 for period one
and 2020-12-27 to 2021-01-31 for period two. Attack rates were calculated by dividing reported
cases by estimated 2020 county populations obtained from the US Census bureau using the
tidycensus package (https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidycensus). Adjustment for attack
rates was done based on the log base 2 cases per thousands (i.e., log2([average biweekly
attack rate per 1000]+1)).
County Level Covariates:
In addition to county level attack rates, multiple county-level measures of socioeconomic status
were included in adjusted analyses. These variables were derived from the 2014-2018
American Community Survey, obtained using the tidycensus package. The county level
variables included in these analyses are:
- Total population
- Total population per square mile
- Percent of population that is white
- Percent of population that is Black
- Percent of households with income level under the appropriate poverty threshold
- Percent of households with computer
- Percent of households with broadband internet subscription
- Percent of population without health insurance
- Percent of population employed as essential workers (in agriculture, construction,
wholesale, transportation, education or health)
- GINI index of income inequality
- County type (metropolitan, metropolitan-adjacent, or non-metropolitan, by county size)
- County urban-rural classification
Outcomes and Covariates:
Due to varying relationships between the timeframe of reported behaviours and other exposures
and the potential for resulting biases (e.g., a reported behaviour being the result of receiving a
positive COVID-19 test, not the other way around), we considered multiple COVID-19-related
outcomes. We considered three primary outcomes, as reported and experienced by the survey
respondent:
- COVID-19 like illness (CLI), defined as a fever of at least 100 °F, along with cough,
shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing in the past 24 hours.
- Experience of loss of taste or smell within the last 24 hours.
- Report of a positive COVID-19 test within the past 14 days.
We also considered the following secondary outcomes, as reported by the survey respondent,
to consider household-level risk and motivation for testing:

Any member in the household experiencing COVID-19 like illness, defined as fever of at
least 100 °F, along with cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing, in the past 24
hours
Direct contact in the last 24 hours by the survey respondent with a household member
who recently tested positive for COVID-19. A “direct contact” was defined as a
conversation lasting more than 5 minutes with someone closer than 6 feet away or
physical contact.
Report of a positive COVID-19 test result for survey respondent within the past 14 days
when testing was indicated (due to either illness or contact with someone who was ill or
tested positive for COVID-19)
Report of a positive COVID-19 test result for survey respondent within the past 14 days
when testing was not indicated (testing was required by an employer, school, or while
receiving other medical care and the individual was not ill and had not been in contact
with someone who was ill or tested positive for COVID-19).

We considered the adjusted associations between each of these outcomes with reported inperson schooling practices, including reported mitigation measures in place. Responses for inperson schooling practices were provided at the household level (e.g., “Is any child in the
household going to in-person classes?”). Respondents were asked whether each of the
following mitigation measures was in place where their child(ren) attended in-person classes:
- Mandatory mask-wearing for students
- Mandatory mask-wearing for teachers
- Student is with the same teacher all day
- Student is with the same students all day
- Some or all outdoor instruction
- Restricted entry into school (e.g. no parents or caregivers)
- Reduced class sizes
- Closed cafeteria
- Closed playground
- Use of separators or “desk shields” in classrooms
- Extra space between desks in classrooms
- No school-based extracurricular activities (e.g. sports, clubs, after school care)
- No sharing of books and/or supplies (e.g. each student has their own set at their desk)
- Daily symptom screening for those going onto campus
Various other individual- and household-level variables were collected in the survey and used in
adjusted analyses. Several variables were re-coded to account for out of range and nonsensical
responses and to aid in interpretability. The survey variables used in these analyses are:
- State and zip code of residence. County of residence is derived from reported zip code;
both state and county are used to match to county-level covariates. That is, if the
reported county was not within the reported state, county-level covariates were marked
as missing (n=4,362 among households with >=1 reported school-aged child).
- Age of survey respondent, categorized as 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, or 65+
years of age

Gender, re-coded to whether the survey respondent identified as male or not, due to
small number of non-binary or other respondents.
Employment status of the survey respondent in the last 4 weeks
Primary occupation of the survey respondent in the last 4 weeks, where occupations
reported by less than 10,000 people (50,000 in the teacher sub-analysis) were collapsed
into the “Other” category.
Indicator for whether the respondent’s employment required paid work outside of the
home in the last four weeks.
Number of kids, adults, and people 65 years or older in the household. Negative,
non-integer and extreme (≥100) values were recorded as missing. The number of kids
re-coded into eight categories (0,1,2,...,6,7+), and the number of adults, people over 65
years, and total household members were re-coded into 11 categories (0,1,2,...,10+).
Variables for number of known sick contacts, number of people encountered in recent
social gatherings, and the number encountered during shopping were not considered
due to high levels of missingness.
Grade indicators for whether there is one or more child in the household in prekindergarten or kindergarten; in grades 1 - 5 (elementary school, classically); in grades 6
to 8 (middle school); or in grades 9 - 12 (high school). Only households with at least one
school-aged child are included in analyses of household risk.
Masking level, indicating self-reported frequency of mask or facial covering use in
public in the last 5 days. Responses were categorized as never, rarely, sometimes,
mostly, or always wearing a mask in public, or no reported time spent in public in the
past 5 days.
Indicator for whether the survey respondent reported any out-of-state travel in the past
5 days
Indicators for whether survey respondent reported various activities in the past 24
hours, including going to work or school outside place of residence; going to a market,
grocery store, or pharmacy; going to a bar, restaurant, or cafe; going to an event with
more than 10 people; spending time with someone not currently staying with the survey
respondent; and using public transit.
Covid testing indicator for whether the survey respondent received a COVID-19 test in
the past 14 days. Missing values were treated as a negative response (i.e., no test
received). Only the subset of individuals who received a test in the past 14 days were
used in analyses of positive COVID-19 test outcomes among survey respondents.

We also assessed the reported risk of COVID-19-related outcomes associated with education
professions among all survey respondents in the two time periods (that is, not restricted to
households with school-aged children). In this analysis, individuals who reported their primary
occupation as “Education” were divided into two separate categories: “K-12 educator”, for
respondents who reported being a preschool, kindergarten, elementary, middle, or secondary
school teacher; and “Other educator”, for those who reported being a postsecondary teacher, a
teacher assistant, other teacher or instructor including special education, or librarian.

Analysis:
All analyses were conducted using quasibinomial regression accounting for survey weights
described above using the srvyr package (https://cran.r-project.org/package=srvyr) in the R
statistical language.
Analyses of the risk of in-person schooling were restricted to households with at least one
school-aged child. Analyses of the effect of individual in-school mitigation measures and the
number of mitigation measures were restricted to households with at least one school-aged
child engaged in any in-person schooling. Analyses of the odds of a reported positive test for
the survey respondent were further restricted to include only households in which the
respondent had been tested for any reason in the last 14 days. Estimates of the risk of inperson schooling and the impact of individual mitigation measures were adjusted by respondent
age, gender, occupation, masking behaviors, out-of-state travel, and whether they reported a
visit to a bar/restaurant/cafe, to an event with more than 10 people, or whether they used public
transit; by household size and number of children; and county 2-week average attack rate,
population, percent white population, percent households in poverty, GINI index of income
inequality, and metropolitan type.
Propensity scores were used to explore possible confounding in the relationship between inperson schooling and risk of COVID-19-related outcomes. Random forests with 500
classification trees were used to generate propensity scores for a household reporting any child
engaged in in-person schooling, using the ranger package (22) in the R statistical language.
Variables included for classification were: respondent age, gender, occupation, masking
behaviors, out-of-state travel, reported activities outside of house; household size, number of
children, and indicators for child grade level; and county 2-week average attack rate, population,
population per square mile, percent white and Black population, percent without health
insurance, percent essential workers, percent households in poverty, percent households with
computer, percent households with broadband internet subscription, GINI index of income
inequality, urban-rural classification and metropolitan type. Variable importance was calculated
using the GINI index for classification, or the mean decrease in node impurity (Fig. S9).
Analyses of the risk of COVID-19-related outcome among educational professionals were
conducted among all respondents with non-missing occupation. An interaction term between
occupation type, including K-12 educator, and an indicator for any paid work outside the home
in the last four weeks was used to evaluate the baseline risk associated with each occupation,
with extra-household work, and with extra-household work within each occupation. These
models were adjusted with the same variable set included in models of risk of in-person
schooling, excluding the number of children in the household due to missingness.

Figure S4. Distribution of selected county-level factors among participants reporting ≧1 schoolaged child in the household attending in-person school (part-time or full-time) by the number of
reported mitigation measures in the school; outlier values are excluded. Results are shown for
county population size (A), percentage of county population that is white (B), percentage with
income level under the appropriate poverty threshold (C) Gini index of income inequality (D) and
average biweekly SARS-CoV-2 attack rate per 1000 persons (E).

Figure S5. Odds ratio of COVID-19-related outcomes, contrasting office workers not reporting
extra-household work for pay to those in other employment categories not reporting work for
pay outside the home (top), and to those reporting work for pay outside the home (bottom). The
middle row shows the odds ratio (i.e., increased risk) within each category associated with
working outside the home compared to no work outside the home.

Figure S8. Odds ratio of secondary COVID-19-related outcomes associated with in-person fulltime and part-time schooling by number of mitigation measures implemented, adjusted for
individual and county-level covariates. An outlier value for the odds ratio of non-indicated
positive test result among part-time in-person schooling with zero mitigation measures, for
which the sample size was <30, is excluded.
