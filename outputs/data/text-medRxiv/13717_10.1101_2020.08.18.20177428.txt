Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is having a devastating effect on human lives. Individuals who are
symptomatic/asymptomatic or have recovered are reported to have/will have serious health
complications in the future, which is going to be huge economic burden globally. Given the
wide-spread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 it is almost impossible to test each and every
individual for the same and isolate them. Recent reports have shown that sewage can be used
as a holistic approach to estimate the epidemiology of the virus. Here we have estimated the
spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the city of Hyderabad, India which is populated with nearly 10
million people. The sewage samples were collected from all the major sewage treatment
plants (STPs) and were processed for detecting the viral genome using the standard RT-PCR
method. Based on the average viral particle shedding per individual, the total number of
individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (in a window of 35 days) is about 6.6% of the
population, which clearly indicates the rate of community transmission and asymptomatic
carriers is higher than the number of reported cases. It is important to note here that the
samples collected from the inlet of STPs were positive for SARS-CoV-2, while the outlets
were negative indicating the efficient treatment of sewage at STPs. These studies are going to
be essential to manage the pandemic better and also to assess the effectiveness of control
measure.

1. Introduction

The surveillance of disease prevalence during pandemic like Corona Virus Disease-19
(COVID-19) is a crucial task considering the spreading rate and high population in different
parts of the world. The massive testing of the population to contain the spread of the virus is a
challenge to any nation in the present scenario. Moreover, a majority of Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected population is asymptomatic.
Emerging studies have shown the after effects of COVID-19, which is going to be huge
economic burden globally and therefore pressing the importance of not only managing the
infected individuals but also to keep the spread to minimum (McKibbin et al., 2020).
Considering the present testing capacity and cost incurred, it is impractical to test all the
individuals. Thus, there is a need for alternative strategies to assess the disease spread and
therefore efficiently allocate resources for disease management.
Even though SARS-CoV-2 is majorly a respiratory pathogen, the persistence and replication
of virus in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and shedding through faeces is established (Wang et
al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Young et al., 2020; Woelfel et al., 2020).
Different independent studies highlighted the presence and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in GI
tract and the prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 viral material through faeces during and
after active infectious stage (Holshue et al., 2020, Woelfel et al., 2020, Kitajima et al., 2020,
Cai et al., 2020, Ling et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2020, La Rosa et al., 2020a; Xiao et al., 2020;
Ahmed et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Wurtzer et al., 2020; La Rosa et al., 2020b; Medema et
al., 2020).
In this scenario, wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) studies are suitable to understand
and estimate the virus spread in a given population for effective disease surveillance. WBE
was earlier used to detect and manage viral diseases such as polio, rotavirus, etc. (Lodder et
al., 2012; Lodder et al., 2013; Ahmed et al., 2020). Recent reports employed WBE-based
approaches to detect SARS-CoV-2 in sewage water and estimated the percentage of infected
individuals in a given population (Ahmed et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Wurtzer et al., 2020;
La Rosa et al., 2020b; Medema et al., 2020). The monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater
could quantify the scale of infection prevailing among the community with a benefit of
detecting virus from symptomatic, asymptomatic, or pre-symptomatic cases which manifest
as an early-warning sign (Lodder et al., 2020; Medema et al., 2020; Mallapaty et al., 2020).

WBE approach will help to minimize the outbreak spread and also serve for future epidemic
surveillance (Daughton 2018; Mao et al., 2020).
Here we have studied the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hyderabad, which is one of the
major and densely populated metropolitan cities of India. The wastewater infrastructure of
the city was used as an effective resource to access and estimate the spread of SARS-CoV-2
across the city of Hyderabad. Here we have simplified the sample processing method for viral
detection by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and based on the
RNA titter the number of infected individuals were estimated.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Sampling sites
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in domestic sewage was performed by
collecting samples from different sewage treatment plants (STPs) in Hyderabad Metropolitan
City, India. Hyderabad (17.37°N 78.48°E) is fifth-largest urban economy in India and is a
capital for Telangana state occupies ~625 square kilometers. It is the fourth-most
populous city in India with 10 million residents in the metropolitan region. The raw sewage
samples were collected from inlet and outlet points from the STPs with a total coverage of
712 million litres per day (MLD), that receive wastewater from all parts of the city (80%
coverage of the existing STPs).

2.2 Sampling procedure
The sewage samples were collected from 7th July 2020 to 8th August 2020 taking all the
safety measures as per the standard operating procedure (SOP) designed for this purpose
(Supplementary Table 1). Sampling was performed in the day time, on the days with no
report of rainfall during last 24 hours. A total of 30 samples were collected from 14 inlets and
14 treated outlets of 10 STPs and 2 samples from a gated community. A 10 MLD STP was
selected for a time course study to understand the weekly variation in the viral load.

Figure 1: Schematic of sample collection and processing: The sewage samples are
collected from STPs in bottles containing Hypo (0.1-4%) followed by shipping to the
COVID-19 testing laboratory and stored at 4 °C until further processing. The samples are
initially filtered using blotting paper followed by 0.22 μm filter. These filtered samples are
further concentrated using 30 kDa centricon filters. The concentrates are used for RNA
isolation, the isolated RNA is subjected to RT-PCR using COVID-19 specific primers and
probes.
2.3 Optimization of disinfectant concentration
Optimum concentration of sodium hypochlorite (5%; Qualigens) addition during sampling
was optimized by collecting samples in various initial concentrations of hypochlorite (0.1%,
0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3% and 4%) using samples collected from 10 MLD STP. Grab samples were
collected from the inlet point of 10 MLD STP in disposable plastic bottles containing 20 ml
of the above mentioned concentrations of sodium hypochlorite. Collected samples were
sealed to avoid leakage and wrapped in plastic covers in two layers and transferred to the
laboratory immediately and stored at 4oC. Samples were processed within 24 h of sampling
for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

2.4. Processing of Samples

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.18.20177428; this version posted August 21, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint
(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Collected samples were subjected to gravity filtration with 1 mm thick blotting sheets to
remove the larger particles followed by filtration using 0.2 µm filtration units (Nalgene®
vacuum filtration system; Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) to remove bacteria and other
debris. The filtrate was collected in 1000 mL sterile wide-mouth bottles (Borosil, India). 100
mL of the total filtrate was concentrated to ~600 µl using 30 kDa Amicon® Ultra-15 (Merck
Millipore, USA) by centrifuging at 4000 rpm at 4 °C. The concentrated samples were further
processed for RNA isolation. Sample filtration, concentration and processing till detection
were performed in Biosafety level 2 (BSL-2). All the materials after use were discarded in
biosafety bags followed by decontamination.

2.5. RNA extraction and RT-PCR
The RNA extraction from 300 µl of concentrate was performed using QIAamp Viral RNA
isolation kit (Qiagen, Germany) by following manufacturer’s protocol. The isolated RNA
samples were tested for presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using Fosun COVID-19 RT-PCR
Detection Kit (Shanghai Fosun Long March Medical Science Co., Ltd, China). The kit
detects Envelope (E; ROX labelled), Nucleocapsid (N; JOE labelled) and open reading
frame1ab (ORF1ab; FAM labelled) genes of SARS-CoV-2 and the RT-PCR was performed
as per manufacturer recommendation. A CT value of 32 corresponds to 300 copies per mL
when using this kit (https://www.fda.gov/media/137120/download). The samples were tested
either in duplicates or triplicates.

2.6. Calculation of number of infected people in a population
We followed two different methods to calculate the number of infected individuals in a given
population based on the average number of RNA copies present in the sewage water.

Number of RNA copies excreted per mL of faeces = 107
Volume of faeces excreted = 120 mL (calculated by considering the density of human faeces
is 1.07g/mL, (Foladori et al., 2020)). Total RNA copies excreted per person = 1.2×109 copies.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1 Optimization of Disinfection Concentration
Sodium hypochlorite was used to disinfect the wastewater collected from the STPs. In order
to find the least concentration of sodium hypochlorite that result in identifying maximum
number of RNA copies using RT-PCR, we performed an optimisation step. We collected 1 L
of wastewater in the presence of 20 mL of six different initial concentrations of sodium
hypochlorite (Table 1) from the 10 MLD STP. Among the tested concentrations, samples
collected with 20 ml of 0.1% hypochlorite resulted in better detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It was also observed that the final concentration of ≥0.04% (initial concentration of ≥2%) did
not yield any result for the same set of samples, indicating a possible complete inactivation of
viral materials by hypo (Table 1; Figure 2). Hence, we used 20 mL of 0.1% sodium
hypochlorite per litre of wastewater for all further sample collections.

3.2 Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in various STPs and residential community
RT-PCR based detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was used for screening the inlet water in the
Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) that cover about 80% of Hyderabad’s STP capacity i.e.
603.5 MLD. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the inlets of all the tested STPs (Table 2),
indicating that the infection is widespread. We observed that the level of viral RNA in the
STPs was dynamic, as implied by the changes in CT values of the samples collected on
different days (Table 2). We also surveyed samples collected from a gated residential

community where confirmed positive cases were reported during the sample collection period
and observed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the samples in trace amounts (Table 3).
As a testimony of efficient wastewater treatment, no viral RNA copies were detected in the
outlet of the STPs that we sampled (Table 2).

3.3 Long Term viral load monitoring
One of the STPs (10 MLD), was sampled at different time to assess the dynamics of disease
spread with time. We observed a highly fluctuating pattern of viral RNA presence with time,
from as low as 30818 copies per L wastewater to as high as 266360 copies per L wastewater
(Table 4). The reason for variations could be sampling time, number of actually infected
people and the amount of viral shedding by infected individuals, and temporal presence of
other compounds (such as surfactants) that could affect the viral material stability in the
domestic sewage.

3.5. Calculation of number of infected people
We used two previously published methods for calculating the number of infected people
from the number of RNA copies in the wastewater samples (Ahmed et al., 2020, Hellmér et
al., 2014). These methods take into account the number of RNA copies present in the
wastewater and the number of RNA copies present in the faecal matter of infected individuals
(Section 2.6). Previous studies have established these numbers and we used them for
calculating the number of infected individuals (Table 5). Our data indicates that
approximately 6.57% of Hyderabad’s population is infected during the window of our study
period (Table 6). Existing reports suggest that an infected person shed viral material in faeces
for up to 47 days since the symptom onset and remains infectious till 14 days since symptom

onset (Wu et al., 2020; Foladori et al., 2020). This suggests that for approximately 35 days, a
person sheds viral material while not being infectious. This indicates that 2 in 5 infected
people are infectious at any given point of time during the 35 days window. We used this fact
to calculate the number of infected people in the active phase of infection (Table 5). Our
calculation indicates that approximately 2.6% of the total population of Hyderabad are
potentially infectious during the study period.

4. Conclusion

Our study provides a concrete evidence for the application of WBE as a potential method for
disease surveillance. Here we performed an extensive survey of the STPs in Hyderabad for
the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genome traces in wastewater. As a result, we observed the
presence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in all the studied STPs and calculated the extent of
spread by estimating the number of infected people and possible number of active cases.
These results will be of immense resource for the healthcare and associated departments to
vigilantly allocate the necessary resources to manage existing cases as well as to carefully
contain the disease spread. Hence, sewage-based surveillance provides a holistic approach to
manage the pandemic and also to monitor for future outbreaks, if any. The current study also
offers a framework to monitor other pathogens which may be useful managing future
epidemics.

Supplementary Table 1: Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for sampling of
wastewater for the detection of viral genome and wastewater-based epidemiological
studies

o The actual sampling site should be visited and accessed in the presence of the local
responsible personnel.
o Proper training and written protocols for sampling should be clearly provided to the
personnel collecting the samples. Complete care should be taken by wearing PPE, shoes
and using disinfectants. Personnel must be aware of hazards that exist during sampling
and the associated risks, safe working procedures, and emergency preparedness.
o Grab method is preferred for sampling water/wastewater wherein raw wastewater/water
will be collected at a selected sampling site, either at one point in time or at different
time intervals. Grab sample volume of one litre is generally recommended at one time.
Three replicates of grab sample are preferred in flowing water for a specified period.
o The sample should be collected either in clean glass (borosilicate) or plastic 1 litre bottle
containing disinfectant (20 ml of 0.1% hypochlorite/lit) to inactivate the pathogens. The
bottle should be sealed in secondary sealing bags (multi-layered) that are suitable for
cold transportation of the samples.
o The

Before packaging, the samples should be

properly labelled with collection site information and date. The properly labelled
samples should be transported and stored at 2-8°C until further processing.
o After the collection, inactivation, and packaging of the samples, the personnel can
remove PPE by following standard procedure safely. The personnel involved in
collection and transportation of the samples should follow recommended hygienic
practices to ensure bio-safety.
o All utilities should be placed in a sealed bio-hazard bag for later sterilization and
disposal activities. The unused sample and materials should be properly discarded after
inactivation/disinfection.
o The laboratory should be notified in advance about the sample collection and be made
aware of the sample storage and processing protocol.
