Abstract

19
20

Portugal has been portrayed as a relatively successful case in the control of the COVID-19’s March 2020

21

outbreak in Europe due to the timely confinement measures taken. As other European Union member states,

22

Portugal is now preparing the phased loosening of the confinement measures, starting in the beginning of

23

May. Even so, the current data, albeit showing at least a reduction in infection rates, renders difficult to

24

forecast scenarios in the imminent future. Using South Korea data as scaffold, which is becoming a

25

paradigmatic case of recovery following a high number of infected people, we fitted Portuguese data to

26

biphasic models using non-linear regression and compared the two countries. The results, which suggest

27

good fit, show that recovery in Portugal can be much slower than anticipated, with a very high percentage

28

of active cases (over 50%) remaining still active even months after the projected end of mitigation measures.

29

This, together with the unknown number of asymptomatic carriers, may increase the risk of a much slower

30

recovery if not of new outbreaks. Europe and elsewhere must consider this contingency when planning the

31

relief of containment measures.

38

The first documented case of COVID-19 infection in Portugal dates March 2, 2020. Motivated by the rapid

39

progression in other countries, especially in neighbouring Spain (see Kinross et al., 2020; Spiteri et al.,

40

2020), the country moved swiftly to control dissemination by shutting down many public services and

41

imposing strict confinement measures (see for instance Mahase, 2020). These date from mid-March and,

42

by the time the present work is prepared, the Portuguese government and competent health authorities are

43

planning the phased cessation of these measures, in alignment with the European Union. It has been

44

consensual that the spreading of COVID-19 in Portugal, with respect to number of infected people, fatalities

45

and ICU internments, is reaching a plateau, making it a potential case of success, as by mid-April fatalities

46

were kept below 1,000 and the healthcare system did not attain saturation. Now is a crucial time to know

47

what to expect from the progression of the disease in the country and how safe it is to begin the relief of

48

confinement measures. However, the available data is still insufficient to draw solid forecasts even on short-

49

term. Indeed, at this stage, epidemiological SIR (‘susceptible’, ‘infected’ and ‘recovered’) models are

50

difficult to produce in Portugal and elsewhere.

51
52

Lessons can be learned from the few countries already clearing the pandemic. The Republic of Korea is a

53

key case study not just due to the overall positive progress but also because the country implemented strict

54

confinement measures, imposed timely limitations to in-bound travelling and closed public services like

55

schools. Also, South Korea endured a high number of total infections (which offers statistical significance),

56

albeit a relatively low mortality rate, estimated at 0.9% by mid-March, when cases totalled almost 8,000,

57

according to the Republic of Korea COVID-19 National Emergency Response Center (2020). Still, the

58

basic reproduction number (R0) has been estimated at 1.5 ± 0.1 (Shim et al., 2020), therefore within the

59

magnitude of the influenza outbreak in 1918 (Ferguson et al., 2006). Consequently, there are significant

60

similarities between countries albeit likely differences in public behaviour, awareness or susceptibility. We

61

therefore aimed at modelling the progression of active cases in Portugal (up to April 19) by means of non-

62

linear regression using Korean data as scaffold.

63
64

We used a four-parameter log-logistic model to estimate the maximum number of infections in Portugal,

65

which, according to the current data, will surpass 25,500. The same model yielded a maximum of about

66

1,000 daily fatalities by day 116 (June 24) since the first cases were reported (March 2), a date that

67

landmarks the beginning of the outbreak in Portugal (Fig. 1A). The current mortality rate is 3.5 % (as per

68

April 19), well below Italy, with over 10% (Rubino et al., 2020). One of the most positive signs for COVID-

69

19 control in Portugal has been considered the reduced percentage of daily cases (Fig. 1B). This information

70

must, nonetheless, be interpreted with caution as reported new cases are highly variable, in part due to

71

increased testing. Active cases were then fitted to a five-parameter log-Gaussian distribution, as described

72

by Martin-Betancor et al. (2015), a biphasic asymmetric model. In fact, the recovery rates in Portugal are

73

low (only 610 cases by April 19), seemingly accordant to reports from elsewhere. At this stage, Portugal as

74

yet to reach the peak of active cases, which means that data cannon be fitted to the descending phase of the

75

curve. Still, the fit was nearly perfect to the ascending phase (Fig. 1C). Moreover, Korean data also fitted

76

the same model perfectly, yielding, as expected, slower recovery than infection rates (Fig. 1D). By

77

juxtaposing the two models and expanding them to a full-year timeframe, the differences between the two

78

countries become evident (Fig. 1E). At day 50, South Korea reported 3591 active cases whereas the model

79

estimated 3653 cases (half of the 7307 projected maximum), with the real maximum being 7293, which,

80

again, shows the good fit of the model. Portugal may only reach 50% of recoveries after 140 days. The

81

different shapes of curves, reflected in differential parametrization of models (Table 1) should reflect not

82

only the number of cases but also different rates of recovery.

83
84

Even though Korean data validates the model, caution is mandatory when interpreting the Portuguese

85

model, as data are incomplete and model parameters are sure to change in time, either accelerating or

86

slowing recovery, depending on the success of mitigation measures and on how the loosing of confinement

87

policies, projected to begin in May, will proceed. It is clear, though, that recovery will be long. With 50%

88

cases still active by July, the risks of new peaks are high, furthermore considering the high percentage of

89

untraced asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 (Yu et al., 2020). To this we must add the fact that persistence

90

of the virus increases the odds of mutation.

D) Active cases reported in the Republic of Korea between February 15 and April 19 fitted to log-Gaussian

Model, as previous. The South Korean scenario already has sufficient data to fit both growth and decrease

already surpassed the estimate (as day 50 corresponds to April 4), in Portugal, day 140 means July 17. The
