Summary
Background
As vaccination campaigns are deployed worldwide, addressing vaccine hesitancy is of critical importance to ensure sufficient immunization coverage. We analyzed COVID-19 vaccine acceptance
across 15 samples covering ten low- and middle- income countries (LMICs) in Asia, Africa, and
South America, and two higher income countries (Russia and the United States).
Methods
Standardized survey responses were collected from ‘45,928 individuals between June 2020 and
January 2021. We estimate vaccine acceptance with robust standard errors clustered at the study
level. We analyze stated reasons for vaccine acceptance and hesitancy, and the most trusted sources
for advice on vaccination, and we disaggregate acceptance rates by gender, age, and education
level.
Findings
We document willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine across LMIC samples, ranging from 67%
(Burkina Faso) to 97% (Nepal). Willingness was considerably higher in LMICs (80%) than in
the United States (65%) and Russia (30%). Vaccine acceptance was primarily explained by an
interest in personal protection against the disease (91%). Concern about side effects (40%) was
the most common reason for reluctance. Health workers were considered the most trusted sources
of information about COVID-19 vaccines.
Interpretation
Given high levels of stated willingness to accept a COVID-19 vaccine across LMIC samples, our
study suggests that prioritizing efficient and equitable vaccine distribution to LMICs will yield
high returns in promoting immunization on a global scale. Messaging and other community-level
interventions in these contexts should be designed to help translate intentions into uptake, and
emphasize safety and efficacy. Trusted health workers are ideally positioned to deliver these messages.

Introduction
A safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 is a critical tool to control the pandemic. As of
March 2, 2021, there were 76 vaccines in clinical development and 16 had advanced to Stage 3
clinical trials.1 Following clinical trials, several vaccines have been approved in multiple countries
and are being distributed across the globe. At present, global vaccine distribution remains highly
unequal, with much of the current supply directed toward high-income countries.2
While effective and equitable distribution of the vaccines is a key policy priority, ensuring the
population’s acceptance is equally important. Acceptance of vaccines and trust in the institutions
that administer them are likely key determinants of the success of any vaccination campaign.3 Several studies investigate high-income country residents’ willingness to take a potential COVID-19
vaccine.4,5 Little is known about acceptance rates in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs),
however, where the majority of the world’s population resides.
Acceptance of childhood vaccination for common diseases —such as measles (MCV), Bacille
Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP)—is generally high in LMICs,
providing reasons for optimism about future uptake of COVID-19 vaccines. Table 1 summarizes
general vaccine acceptance and uptake of common childhood vaccines for the countries included
in our study. Still, existing studies on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance document large variation,
both across and within countries, including in settings where overall vaccination rates are high.4
These studies highlight concerns about COVID-19 vaccine safety, and particularly concerns about
the speed of vaccine development, as reasons for hesitancy in higher income settings. Similar
concerns may apply in LMICs.
Additional reasons for hesitancy may feature more prominently in LMIC settings. Reported
COVID-19 mortality rates have consistently been lower in LMICs relative to higher income
countries.6 If individuals in LMICs feel the risk of disease is less serious, they may be less
inclined to accept perceived risks associated with taking a recently-developed vaccine. Previous
studies have also highlighted factors such as concerns about healthcare quality,7 negative historical
experiences,8 weak support from traditional leaders,9 and mistrust in government10 as barriers to
healthcare utilization in LMICs.
Understanding factors that may lead people in LMICs to reject COVID-19 vaccination is of global
concern, since a lag in vaccination in the developing world could facilitate the spread of new
variants of the virus to other countries.
In order to effectively promote the vaccine and devise messaging strategies, we need to know if
people are willing to take it, the reasons why they are willing or unwilling to do so, and the factors
influencing their decision-making. For this purpose, we developed and deployed a common set of
questions across 15 studies in ten LMICs in Africa (Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda,
Sierra Leone, Uganda), Asia (India, Nepal, Pakistan), and Latin America (Colombia). We compare
these findings in LMICs to those from two higher income countries (Russia and the United States).

Methods
Survey questions and sample construction
Survey data were collected between June 2020 and January 2021. Our main outcome measure
is vaccine acceptance. Across studies, we asked respondents, “If a COVID-19 vaccine becomes
available in [your country], would you take it?”. If the respondent answered yes to this question,
we followed up with the question, “Why would you take it? [the COVID-19 vaccine]”. If the
respondent said they would not be willing to take the vaccine, we followed up with the question,
“Why would you not take it? [the COVID-19 vaccine]”. Finally, regardless of their expressed willingness to take the vaccine, we asked about actors and institutions who would be influential in their
decision. The question was worded in the following way: “Which of the following people would
you trust MOST to help you decide whether you would get a COVID-19 vaccine, if one becomes
available?”. To examine heterogeneity across demographic strata, we collected information about
the gender, age, and education level of each respondent. Slight variations in questions wording and
answer options across studies are documented in Appendix B.
Studies vary in terms of geographic scope, sampling methodology, and survey modality. Seven
were national or nearly-national in scope. Among these, studies from Burkina Faso, Colombia,
Rwanda, and Sierra Leone (“Sierra Leone 1”) used nationally-representative samples of active
mobile phone numbers reached through Random Digit Dialing (RDD). Studies in the USA and
Russia were conducted online using quota samples obtained from private survey companies.
The remaining eight studies targeted sub-national populations. One study from Pakistan (“Pakistan
2”) used RDD to reach a representative sample of active mobile phone users in Punjab province.
Respondents in Mozambique, Nigeria, “Pakistan 1”, “Uganda 1”,“Uganda 2”, India, Nepal and
“Sierra Leone 2” were drawn from pre-existing studies to which COVID-19 vaccine questions
were subsequently added. For example, “Sierra Leone 2” has national coverage from a study on
access to electricity and “Uganda 1” sampled female caregivers of households in rural and semirural villages as part of a large ongoing cluster-RCT implemented across 13 districts.
Table 2 summarizes the geographic scope, sampling methodologies and survey modalities of all
15 studies. A detailed description of each study is included in Appendix D.
All LMIC surveys were conducted via telephone to minimize in-person contact and comply with
local government social distancing guidelines. Interviews were conducted by local staff in each
country in local language(s). Surveying by phone made rapid, large-scale data collection possible.
Surveys lasted approximately 15 to 40 minutes.
Taken together, we have data from 21,844 individuals from LMICs and 24,084 from the USA and
Russia, for a total of 45,928 respondents.

Statistical Analysis
Vaccine acceptance was defined as the percentage of respondents who answered “yes” to the question, “If a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available in [country], would you take it?”. This was

calculated combining all other answer options (“No”, “Don’t Know” and “Refuse”) into a single
reference category. We estimated this outcome for each study with robust standard errors and
employed sampling weights where available.
In addition to study-level estimates, we combined data from all studies other than the USA and
Russia to calculate an aggregate estimate for all LMIC studies. For these analyses, each included
study received equal weight and standard errors were clustered at the study level. Averages in the
“All LMICs” group then reflect the expected share across studies. In this combined analysis we
also estimated the underlying heterogeneity of vaccine acceptance across studies using the between
studies variance estimator τ 2 from a random effects model.
We also conducted subgroup analyses by gender, age and education level and reported differences
between groups. For the “All LMICs” analyses we calculated the average of differences between
subgroups within studies with standard errors clustered at the study level.
We additionally examined reported reasons for COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy, as
well as the types of actors respondents would trust when making the decision about whether to
take a COVID-19 vaccine. Among respondents who expressed willingness to take the vaccine, we
asked about several possible reasons why they would take it. For respondents unwilling to take the
vaccine, we asked about several possible reasons why they would not take it. Finally, we asked all
respondents, regardless of their answers to other questions, whom they would trust most to help
them decide whether to get a COVID-19 vaccine. We report estimates of agreement with reasons
for vaccine acceptance/hesitance and trust in actors for individual studies and for the “All LMICs”
group.

Results
Our main results are shown in Figure 1 and reproduced as Table 4 in Appendix A. The first column
provides overall acceptance rates in each study, while the remaining columns show acceptance
rates disaggregated by respondent characteristics. The “All LMICs” row reports averages for LMIC
countries only (and so excludes Russia and the US).
We document meaningful variation in vaccine acceptance across and within LMICs, but generally
high levels of acceptance in LMICs overall. The average acceptance across studies is 80.3% (95%

CI 74.9–85.6), with a median of 78, a range of 30.1 percent points and an interquartile range of
9.7. Our estimate of τ 2 is 0.007 which implies a standard deviation over country averages of 0.084.
The acceptance rate in every LMIC sample is higher than in USA (64.6%, 61.8–67.3) and Russia
(30.4%, 29.1–31.7).
We find limited evidence of variation across demographic subgroups in LMICs, as shown in Table
8. Women are generally less willing to accept the vaccine (average difference about 4.3 points, significant at p < .01). Younger respondents (defined as aged <55 given younger-skewing populations
in LMICs) are marginally more willing to take the vaccine, but this difference is not statistically
significant. Less educated people were on average more willing to take the vaccine in LMICs, but
this difference is not significant.
To better understand the reasoning behind vaccine acceptance, we asked those who were willing
to take the vaccine why they would take it. We summarize in Table 3, with more details in Table 5.
The most common reason given for vaccine acceptance was personal protection against COVID-19
infection. The average across LMICs is 91% (86–96). In every individual study, it ranks as the
first reason. In distant second place, LMIC respondents reported willingness to take the COVID19 vaccine in order to protect their families. The average across LMICs is 36% (28–43). In
comparison to self-protection, protecting the community did not feature prominently in the stated
reasons at all.
Self-protection also ranked as the most commonly expressed reason for taking the vaccine in Russia (76%, 74–78) and the USA (94%, 92–95).
This evidence contrasts with appeals to altruistic behavior and prosocial motivations in order to
promote vaccine acceptance.11 The risks and benefits to personal well-being feature much more
prominently in people’s stated reasons for vaccine acceptance.
Figure 2 summarizes the reasons given among respondents who said they were not willing to take
a Covid vaccine.
The most common reason expressed for reluctance to take the vaccine in LMIC studies was concern
about side effects. For studies Uganda 1 (85.1% 80.7–89.6), Sierra Leone 2 (57.9%, 50.1–65.7),
Sierra Leone 1 (53.5% 47.1–59.9) and Uganda 2 (47.3% 42.2–52.5), more than half of those respondents unwilling to take the vaccine mentioned this reason. Respondents in Russia (36.8%,
35.2–38.4) and the USA (79.3%, 74.6–84), reported high levels of this same concern.
While serious adverse events that are life-threatening or require hospitalization are very rare, with
only .6% of respondents reporting at least one side effect in the Pfizer vaccine trial,12 one potential
explanation for the outsized concern about side effects could be the lack of widespread information
about features of the vaccine at the time of data collection. Media coverage of the few cases of
serious adverse events and spread of fake news may contribute as well.13
Concerns about side effects could also be due to a concern about mild side effects from experiences
with other vaccines. In the case of available COVID-19 vaccines, we now know that mild side
effects are common but transient. These include fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain and headache,
which were severe in fewer than 10% of people in the clinical trials of tens of thousands. Severe
fever occurred in fewer than 2% of them.14

Allergic reactions from the COVID-19 vaccine seem to be extremely rare. Data from trials of the
Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines shows that anaphylaxis after reported administration occurs at a rate of
11.1 cases per million vaccine doses administered.15 Our data reflects this – no more than 6% of
respondents expressed concern about allergies in any of our LMIC studies.
Other concerns that make many respondents unwilling to take the vaccine could be countered
by accurately presenting the scientific data to the public. Studies Uganda 2 (31%, 25.9–36.2),
Mozambique (29.7%, 18.6–40.8) and Pakistan 1 (26%, 18–34) showed relatively high levels of
skepticism about vaccine effectiveness. This is also true for respondents in Russia (29.6%, 28.1–
31.1) and the USA (46.8%, 41–52.6). Recent clinical trials reveal very high rates of vaccine
efficacy,16,17 so clearly communicating these results to the public is a high priority, given the
skepticism we observe in our data. In contrast, conspiracy theories were rarely mentioned by
respondents in any of our study samples, in spite of widespread popular discourse about antivaxxer movements and theories in higher-income countries.18
Finally, respondents in some studies downplayed the seriousness of this disease, and listed this as
a reason not to be vaccinated. Studies USA (39.3% 33.5–45), Pakistan 1 (29.4%, 20.9–37.9) and
Nepal (20.4% 6.7–34.1) report high rates of lack of concern about getting seriously ill from the
disease.
The analysis above identifies the nature of the information gaps that any vaccine messaging should
focus on, while in Figure 3 we try to identify the actors who are best placed to deliver those
messages. We asked respondents about their most trusted source of information during the process
of deciding whether to take the vaccine, because these sources are vital to disease control strategies
during public health emergencies.19 Results from Figure 3 are reproduced as Table 7 in Appendix
A.
We find striking consistency across countries. In all but one study, respondents identified the health
system as the most trustworthy source to help them decide whether or not to take the COVID-19
vaccine (with the exception of Rwanda, where the government in general was identified as the
most trusted source, with the health system a close second). Family and friends were the next
most important reference points in most samples. Across samples, women were 3 percentage
points more likely to rely on family and friends than male respondents though this difference is not
significant at conventional levels (Figure 4 in Appendix D). By contrast, endorsements by religious
leaders or celebrity figures were not seen as important sources of influence in any sample other than
Nepal.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study documenting rates of expressed COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy in a large set of LMICs. Our findings show variable but broadly high levels of
prospective COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across LMICs using data from 45,928 respondents in
13 original household surveys from Africa (Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra
Leone, Uganda), Asia (Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan), and Latin America (Colombia). Acceptance across LMIC averages 80.3, ranging between 66.5 and 96.6. We document considerably
lower levels of acceptance in Russia and the United States.

Patterns of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy are not well predicted by existing measures of concerns
about the safety of other vaccines (e.g., the Wellcome Global Monitor shown in Table 1). Compared with other vaccines, COVID-19 vaccine acceptance is lower and more variable across LMIC
samples. This suggests that concerns may apply specifically to COVID-19 vaccines rather than to
vaccination more broadly.
Our study also documents reasons why respondents express intentions to take (or not take) a
COVID-19 vaccine. The main reason expressed for willingness to take such a vaccine was to
protect oneself. The most common reasons offered by those unwilling to take the vaccine were
concerns about safety (side effects) and efficacy. Across all contexts, health care workers were the
most trusted source of information about vaccines.
Our study samples offer an important window into the motivations underlying COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in LMICs, but our data are not fully nationally representative. Random digit dial
samples and follow-up phone surveys, while necessary during a global pandemic, do not include
individuals who reside outside coverage areas, who do not own or cannot operate cell phones,
or who choose not to respond to telephone surveys. Care should also be taken in any attempt to
extrapolate to the population level from the samples representative of narrow subpopulations.
If intentions reported in our LMIC samples translated into actual vaccination uptake, the rates
would far exceed the range of what would be required for COVID-19 herd immunity (40-67% in
recent estimates).20,21 However, reported intent may not materialize into actual vaccine adoption.22
The high salience of COVID-19 due to extensive media coverage and government mitigation
efforts and excitement around vaccine release may have increased reported intention.23 Results
from the first COVID-19 vaccine Phase 3 clinical trial were announced before some surveys were
fielded; during others, subsequent approvals were granted. The fast-moving information environment may change people’s perceptions about vaccines by the time they are widely available in
LMICs.
Nonetheless, our findings provide some specific guidance on how to design messaging to boost
COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and uptake in LMICs. Our data have implications for both what
the content of the message should be, and who should deliver the message.
First, high levels of trust in the advice of health workers and governments on COVID-19 vaccine
decision-making suggest that social and behavioral change communication (SBCC) strategies that
engage local health workers may be particularly effective tools to encourage timely and complete
vaccine uptake, and to combat remaining vaccine hesitancy. The literature has explored messaging
strategies to promote welfare-improving behaviors, with considerable attention paid to celebrity
endorsements.24 Our data strongly support the view25 that those with the most relevant expertise as opposed to celebrities or general opinion leaders - are most trusted on this specific topic and are
therefore best positioned to deliver the message.
Second, the average COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate across our LMIC samples is high, approximately 80.3%. Given such positive intentions, there may be high returns to investing in
straightforward “last-mile” nudges that help citizens convert intentions into actions. Reminder
messages from healthcare providers and messages alerting patients that vaccines have been reserved for them at an upcoming appointment may provide a low-cost encouragement to initiate
and complete two-dose COVID-19 vaccinations, as was found in two recent large-scale studies in

the United States.26,27 Similarly, childhood vaccination reminders plus cash incentives in Kenya
substantially increased full immunization,28 and cash and in-kind incentive programs in Nigeria
and India have also proven effective.29,30
Third, high coverage rates of existing vaccines, coupled with respondents’ reliance on friends and
family as information sources, suggest that the general pro-vaccination stance of many citizens
could be leveraged to convert intent to uptake. Social learning strategies and norm-setting are
powerful drivers of information diffusion and behavior change in many related sectors.31 Social
signalling of positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines may also help shift social norms toward
even greater immunization acceptance and two-dose completion in the community at large.32
Finally, our findings offer guidance on the specific content of vaccine messaging that is likely to
be most persuasive. Messaging should highlight the high efficacy rates of the COVID-19 vaccines
currently on the market in reducing or eliminating disease, hospitalizations and death. Alluding
to clinical data that addresses people’s concerns about potential side effects should be prioritized.
Messaging should also emphasize the direct protective benefits of the vaccine to the adopter.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
COVID-19 vaccine acceptance has been widely studied in high-income countries. Much less evidence exists for LMICs, and data that are available33,34 systematically exclude the estimated 66%
of individuals in LMICs who do not use the internet.35 Searches of PubMed and the Cochrane
Database of Systematic Reviews using the terms “vaccine hesitancy”, “low- and middle-income
countries”, “trust in vaccines”, “immunization campaign”, “vaccination incentives” and “vaccination policy” to select studies investigating the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine uptake and
policy-led actions to increase it and restricted to studies published between Jan 1, 2020 and Jan
31, 2021 identified two studies addressing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in LMICs, and no any
studies comparing uptake for the COVID-19 vaccine with general attitudes toward vaccines.
Added value of this study
This study documents COVID-19 vaccine acceptance across ten LMICs and identifies key sociodemographic predictors, combining analyses of data from 15 distinct studies that cover a total of
45,928 individuals. To date, no comparable quantitative mapping of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance
in LMICs has been released. By extending the analysis to attitudes toward vaccinations in general,
and by asking respondents to specify reasons for their acceptance or refusal, our study offers novel
insights that may help inform country-specific policies to smooth the path to vaccine acceptance
in LMICs.
Implications of all the available evidence
As mass immunization campaigns are deployed across the world, our analysis offers cause for
optimism regarding potential uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in LMICs. Our findings suggest
that policies to encourage widespread uptake should focus on converting intentions to take the
vaccine into action. Our analysis of reasons for hesitancy and most trusted sources for advice
about vaccination suggests that communication campaigns focusing on vaccine safety and efficacy
delivered through trusted health workers may be particularly effective in persuading those who are
still hesitant. While acceptance of COVID-19 vaccinations is high across our sample of LMICs,
acceptance of vaccines in general is even higher, highlighting opportunities to leverage existing
pro-vaccine attitudes and norms to encourage uptake and address remaining hesitancy. Social
signaling of vaccination status may also be effective in demonstrating local acceptance of safety
and efficacy claims.

Figure 1 presents average acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine across studies and subgroups within studies. For each study, we summarize sampling
information in parentheses in the following way: First, we indicate whether the geographic coverage of the sample is national or subnational. If the
coverage is subnational we provide further details. Second, we list the number of observations included in the study. In the plot, points represent
the estimated percentage of individuals who would take the vaccine. “No”, “Don’t know” and “Refuse” are taken as a single reference category.
Bars around each point indicate a 95% confidence interval for the estimate. An estimate of average acceptance for all studies in LMICs (excluding
USA and Russia) is also shown.

Table 7 shows percentage of respondents that mention actors who they would trust the most to help them decide whether to get a COVID-19 vaccine. For all countries
the questions was asked regardless if respondent would take a vaccine, would not take it, does not know or does not respond. For India respondents were able to mention
more than one actor, for the rest of countries only one actor was allowed. While rows should sum to 100%, rounding makes number slightly above or below. A 95%
confidence interval is shown between parentheses.

• Number of confirmed cases: 65,693 as of November 18, 2020
• Number of deaths: 1,163 as of November 18, 2020
Target Population: Christian and Muslim men and women, age 18 and above, living in Kaduna
state, Nigeria.
Original Study Design: Initial data was collected from a subset of the sample in December 2019
(in person survey) and July - Aug 2020 (phone survey) as part of an experiment testing the effects
of a brief radio program on inter-religious animus. A random walk procedure and random sampling
were used within households to recruit a representative sample of adults in Kaduna town. The rest
of the sample was recruited for the study in Aug 2020 by purchasing phone lists for residents of
Kaduna State.
Intervention: The study examines the effects of a radio program and a TV drama on inter-religious
animus. The subset of the sample in the radio study was randomly assigned to listen to a brief
radio program on one of the following topics: (1) an inter-religious storyline, (2) an intra-religious
storyline, and (3) a message about maintaining safe health practices. All respondents in the sample
participated in a study examining the effect of viewing an inter-religious storyline unfolding over
a full season of a popular TV drama, Dadin Kowa. The season aired from Aug - Oct 2020. A
third of the sample were encouraged to watch Dadin Kowa, a third were encouraged to watch
the TV station Africa Magic Hausa at the same time Dadin Kowa aired, and a third were in the
treatment-as-usual group. All participants received a weekly incentivized SMS quiz from Aug Oct 2020.
COVID-19 Survey Design: This survey is not primarily about COVID-19, but was designed as an
endline survey to follow the TV drama intervention described above. The goal of this survey is to
measure a range of attitudinal outcomes related to Christian-Muslim relations (including prejudice,
intergroup threat perceptions, dehumanization, and support for the use of violence, among others).
We included nine of the standardized COVID-19 vaccine-related questions collected specifically
for this vaccine acceptance study in the final module of the endline survey.
Sampling Frame: 950 respondents in the sample were recruited in person through a random sampling procedure in the Kaduna metropolitan area (pre-COVID). The remaining 1,700 respondents
were recruited into the study over the phone from lists of phone numbers of Kaduna state residents
that were purchased from a private vendor.
Survey Dates: November 18 - December 18, 2020.
Sample size, tracking and attrition: All 1,834 individuals who completed the endline survey are
included.

Tyumen, Ulyanovsk, Chelyabinsk, Yaroslavl. Other: Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Khanty-Mansiysk
Autonomous Okrug – Ugra. The remaining 24 federal subjects were excluded from the study
due to inability to enroll sample size with desired characteristics (sample size, age, gender and
education group composition).
Original Study Design: N/A
COVID-19 Survey Design: The study was designed to measure the impact of pandemics on
Russians, mostly those who live in cities with more than 100,000 residents. It contains a number of
questions on the personal experience, norms and values, trust in government institutions, provision
of social services, and mass media use. Region and geolocality of every respondent are recorded.
Sampling Frame: In total 25,558 respondents received the module on vaccine acceptance. The
sample was enrolled from the pool of Russian online survey company OMI (Online Market Intelligence). The sampling was specifically targeted at having a minimum of 150 respondents in
each of the 61 regions and including respondents from all the main age and gender groups within
each region. Respondents were also selected so that at least 40% of respondents did not have
higher education, in accordance with higher education rates in Russia. Out of 25,558 recruited
respondents, 22,125 completed the survey. Among 22,125 respondents who completed the survey,
20,821 were enrolled from the general pull of the survey company respondents, while the remaining 1,304 respondents were enrolled among residents of cities with populations below 100,000 and
rural areas.
Survey Dates: November 6 - December 1, 2020
Sample size, tracking and attrition: 22,125 respondents who completed the survey with the vaccine
acceptance module included.
Sampling Weights: Post-stratification weights are computed to match marginal population distributions of age, gender and education with target proportions coming from the 2019 Yearbook and
2015 Microcensus released by Russian Federal Bureau of National Statistics (Rosstat).
IRB Approval: This study was approved via Columbia University IRB Protocol IRB-AAAT4453.

Target Population: Households in 195 rural towns across all 14 districts of Sierra Leone. Of
these, 97 villages were selected to benefit from an electrification program.
Original Study Design: Initial baseline data was collected during late 2019 and early 2020 as part
of a study to assess the impact of Rural Electrification in rural towns in Sierra Leone.
Intervention: The Government of Sierra Leone (GoSL) in collaboration with the United Nations
Office for Project Services (UNOPS) and international donors is implementing the Rural Renewable Energy Project (RREP). In its first wave, during 2017, the project provided stand-alone solar
photovoltaic powered mini-grids to 54 communities across the country. Construction of mini-grids
in a further 43 towns is ongoing. In RREP communities, engineers construct 6kW–36kW power

mini-grids that provide reliable power year-round. Electricity is free for schools and clinics. Residential and commercial users can acquire connections from commercial operators.
Village Sampling Frame: Household data was collected in 195 towns across all 12 districts of
Sierra Leone. The GoSL selected 97 towns with (planned) mini-grids. We used Propensity Score
Matching to select 98 control communities. Within communities, respondents were randomly
selected from a census roster stratified by occupation status of farmers, business owners and other
occupations [47 percent, 47 percent and 7 percent]. In each village, the intended sample was
43 households (20 farmers, 20 businesses, 3 others). Data was collected during June–July (108
communities) and November–December 2019 (87 communities). If a household on the sampling
list was not available on the village visit day, we had a randomly sampled list of replacement
households to survey. The replacement household would be the same occupation as the sampled
household would have been so the sample ratio of 20-20-3 still held in each community.
COVID-19 Survey Design: The goal was to assess households’ degree of economic vulnerability
in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sampling Frame: The COVID-19 survey data comprises 2,110 respondents from 186 towns from
the original baseline survey. Phone surveys were attempted to all 195 rural communities from the
baseline survey. The total baseline household sample comprised 7047 respondents. We recontacted
all baseline respondents that listed a phone number (4,594 respondents) and obtained informed
consent for the phone survey. We implemented several waves of the phone survey, recontracting a
respondent about every month. In wave 7, we added questions related to Vaccine Acceptability.4 .
Survey Dates: October 7, 2020 and January 20, 2021 (earlier rounds included Wave 1: April 29May 15; Wave 2: May 15-June 4; Wave 3: June 5-June 17; Wave 4: June 17-June 30; Wave 5:
July 1-August 8; Wave 6: August 19-October 1). The median survey time was 33 minutes.
Sample size, tracking and attrition: Data collection took place between October 7 and January 20,
2021with 2,110 respondents, in 186 towns for a tracking rate of 46 percent.
Sampling Weights: None
IRB Approval: Approval was secured from Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Committee
(SLERC 2904202) and Wageningen University (24062020).

Uganda Subnational sample, International Growth Center, Trinity College Dublin, Stockholm School of Economics and Misum, Institute for International Economic Studies, Stockholm University Target Population: Women from semi-rural and rural villages across 13 districts in Uganda (Iganga, Kayunga, Mbale, Mityana, Apac, Dokolo, Gulu, Adjumani, Koboko,
Maracha, Nebbi, Soroti, Kumi).
Original Study Design: Initial baseline data was collected in 2016 as part of a large cluster randomized controlled trial, with the aim of selecting households likely to have children during the
study period. Four criterias for selection were thus used, in descending order of importance: the
household has a woman that is currently pregnant, or aged 16-30 years old, with a young child less
than three years old, and/or married (formally or informally). In each household, the respondent
was chosen as the female household head or the primary female health care giver of the household
if the household head could not be found.
COVID-19 Survey Design: The data was collected through multiple rounds of phone surveys.
The variable measuring age was constructed by approximation, using the baseline data from 2016
and adding 4 years to the 2016 measure. When the baseline respondent was replaced, the initial
age information was deleted.
Sampling Frame: Households were selected within 500 clusters (the village of the household).
Survey Dates: September 21 to December 06, 2020.
Sample size, tracking and attrition: Out of 2,743 respondents, 1752 were included, provided that
they answered the main question about vaccine uptake.
Sampling Weights: None.

Target Population: All residents of Kampala who are Ugandan citizens, above the age of 18, and
agree in principle to attend a short citizen consultative meeting.
Original Study Design: Baseline data was collected between July and October 2019 for an intervention that randomized citizen attendance to a set of 188 consultative meetings organized across
Kampala. The meetings were organized to collect citizen preferences for the design of a forthcoming municipal citizen charter. The study also aimed to assess patterns of political inequality in meeting participation, dynamics, and outcomes, as well as study the subsequent effects on
prosociality of being incorporated in this participatory process. 1/3 of the sample was randomly
allocated to control, while 2/3 of respondents were invited to attend a consultative meeting. The
consultations took place between November 2019 and February 2020 across Kampala divisions.
Intervention: The intervention consisted of attendance at the consultative meeting organized a
few months after baseline data collection. A further randomization allocated ½ of the invited
participants to a meeting moderated by a local bureaucrat, while the remaining ones attended a
meeting moderated by a neutral discussion leader.
COVID-19 Survey Design: The COVID-19 survey sample comprises the 2,189 respondents to the
baseline who were selected on the basis of their residence in the city. Having received permission

to re-contact these individuals, we coordinated a 3-wave panel throughout the summer and fall
of 2020, with respondents contacted via phone. The goal was to assess households’ degree of
economic vulnerability in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and respondents’ evaluations of
performance of political actors in tackling the pandemic.
Sampling Frame: The 2,189 respondents to the baseline were randomly selected from a sampling
frame of all buildings in Kampala, for which information about their geographical coordinates was
available. After randomly selecting a set of candidate structures, interviewers sampled respondents
from the subset of structures that were residential.
Survey Dates: Wave 1: June 18–July 23. Wave 2: September 4–29. Wave 3: November 23–
December 12.
Sample size, tracking and attrition: Of the 2,189 respondents which we aimed to contact, we were
able to reach 1,333 in Wave 1, 1,289 in Wave 2, and 1,366 in Wave 3. Wave 3 contained the
COVID-19 vaccine module presented in this analysis.
Sampling Weights: None.
