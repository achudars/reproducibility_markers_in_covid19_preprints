Abstract

36

Background: With a rapidly changing evidence base, high-quality clinical management guidelines

37

(CMGs) are key tools for aiding clinical decision making and increasing access to best available

38

evidence-based care. A rapid review of COVID-19 CMGs found that most lacked methodological

39

rigour, overlooked many at-risk populations, and had variations in treatment recommendations.

40

Furthermore, social science literature highlights the complexity of implementing guidelines in local

41

contexts where they were not developed and the resulting potential to compound health inequities.

42

The aim of this study was to evaluate access to, inclusivity of, and implementation of Covid-19 CMGs

43

in different settings.

44

Methods: A cross-sectional survey of clinicians worldwide from 15 June to 20 July 2020, to explore

45

access to and implementation of Covid-19 CMGs and treatment and supportive care

46

recommendations provided. Data on accessibility, inclusivity, and implementation of CMGs. were

47

analyzed by geographic location.

48

Results: Seventy-six clinicians, from 27 countries responded, 82% from high-income countries, 17%

49

from low-middle income countries. Most respondents reported access to Covid-19 CMG and

50

confidence in implementation of these. However, many respondents, particularly from LMICs

51

reported barriers to implementation, including limited access to treatments and equipment. Only

52

20% of respondents reported having access to CMGs covering care for children, 25% for pregnant

53

women and 50% for older adults (>65 years). Themes emerging were for CMGs to include

54

recommendations for different at-risk populations, and settings, include supportive care guidance,

55

be readily updated as evidence emerges, and CMG implementation supported by training, and

56

access to treatments recommended.

57

Conclusion: Our findings highlight important gaps in Covid-19 CMG development and

58

implementation challenges during a pandemic, particularly affecting different at-risk populations

59

and lower resourced settings., to improve access in evidence-based care recommendations during

60

an emergency. The findings identifies an urgent need for an improved framework for CMG

Introduction

72

The Covid-19 pandemic is a global health emergency, with over 120 million cases and more than 2.7

73

million deaths worldwide (as of 30 March 2021) (1). Amidst considerable uncertainty, particularly at

74

the beginning of the pandemic, clinicians looked toward national and international organisations,

75

such as the World Health Organization (WHO), for clinical management guidance. For emerging

76

infections, the main treatment early on is supportive care, such as oxygen, fluids, electrolyte balance

77

and management of complications. To this end, expert bodies have produced evidence-based

78

recommendations and clinical management guidelines (CMGs), for use by frontline clinicians.

79

Developing evidence-based CMGs is resource intensive, and past studies show that in practice, many

80

clinicians across the world may use CMGs produced by international organisations rather than local

81

CMGs. However, recommendations produced in one context may not be directly applicable to other

82

settings, with different risk factors, and available resources. (2,3)

83
84

CMGs are defined as “systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient

85

decisions about appropriate healthcare for specific clinical circumstances.” (4) In practice, the

86

implementation of CMGs aims to standardise best available evidence-based care and improve

87

quality, effectiveness, and outcomes (5,6). In specific cases, evidence suggests that guidelines have

88

measurable impacts on improving patient outcomes, morbidity, and mortality (7,8). However,

89

literature also highlights the complexity of guideline implementation, some studies indicating

90

disappointingly low adherence to guideline recommendations, and others highlighting how

91

guidelines may also add to inequities experienced by disadvantaged groups (9–11). To be effective

92

and context-appropriate, CMGs need to be evidence-based, accessible, high-quality, inclusive of the

93

whole population, and their recommendations applicable to local context and resources. Recent

94

studies highlight that CMGs produced during public health emergencies often fall short of the gold

95

standard of guideline development (12,13).

97

A rapid review of Covid-19 guidelines in the early stages of the pandemic found that these CMGs

98

were limited in their methodological rigour and lacked coverage of at-risk populations, including

99

those with lower immune response due to age, illness, or medication (2). There were also wide

100

variations in recommendations for empirical antimicrobial, antiviral, and experimental treatment.

101

The majority of Covid-19 CMGs identified were produced in upper-middle and higher income

102

countries, there were no Covid-19 CMG identified from lower income countries (LMICs) (2).

103
104

The knowledge of implementation of high consequence infectious diseases during public health

105

emergencies in different resource settings is limited. The aim of this study is to address these gaps.

106

his study is to our knowledge the first study presenting data on clinician’s experience of accessibility,

107

inclusivity, and challenges in implementing Covid-19 CMGs including recommendations on

108

treatment and supportive care early in the pandemic.

109
110

Methodology

111

Study design

112

We conducted a cross-sectional survey of frontline clinicians in primary and secondary care settings

113

globally. The survey was open from 15 June to 20 July 2020.

114

The survey explored clinicians’ perception and experiences, including access to and challenges in

115

implementation, of Covid-19 CMGs. Survey questions focused on clinicians’ confidence and recent

116

experiences, including availability, quality, inclusivity, and implementation of Covid-19 CMGs.

117
118

Data collection

119

The survey was developed by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians, epidemiologists, clinical and

120

social science researchers with experience in outbreak research and response.

121

Using convenience sampling, we disseminated the survey to a range of clinicians in different

122

countries via clinical networks, including the Platform for European Preparedness Against (Re-)

123

emerging Epidemics (PREPARE) (14), the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging

124

Infection Consortium (ISARIC) (15), and through informal clinical networks, in order to capture

125

diverse experiences, priorities, and different context that may influence the use and perception of

126

different guidelines and to gain a geographically representative sample. The survey was

127

programmed onto the REDCap database (16,17), hosted at the University of Oxford, and circulated

128

as an online link with two follow-up reminders to non-responders. The survey was disseminated via

129

direct e-mails, newsletters, and social media for wide reach and inclusivity. The survey was designed

130

to be brief to facilitate uptake by frontline clinicians, during the pandemic (Supplemental File 1).

131
132

Data analysis

133

Most answers were structured as a seven point Likert scale response. Positive Likert scale responses

134

(either agree or strongly agree) were coded as 1, and non-responses or negative responses (neither

135

agree nor disagree, disagree, or strongly disagree) were coded as 0. Dichotomous responses of yes

136

or no were coded as 1 or 0, respectively. Proportions were calculated whereby a total acceptability

137

score was estimated as a percentage of interviewees providing a positive response (18). All analysis

138

was conducted in R version 3.4.2. The data is presented in a narrative form. Income classifications

139

are based on World Bank income brackets (19).

140
141

Public and Patient Involvement

142

This study is part of a wider project to assess availability, quality, and inclusivity of CMGs for high

143

consequence infectious diseases, including systematic reviews of Covid-19 CMGs. The study

144

protocols and interpretations of the findings have been informed by patient groups.

Ethics

150

Responses were anonymized, all participants consented to sharing of their anonymized data. This

151

research was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and was given an exemption

152

from ethical review by the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OXTREC) on 16 April 2020.

153
154

Results

155

Of the 76 respondents (51% male), caring for patients in 27 different countries, across six continents

156

(Fig.1), most were doctors and 87% worked in a hospital, of which 18% worked in an intensive care

157

unit (Table 1). Fifty-three percent of respondents reported having taken on more responsibility

158

during the pandemic and 40% that they had to work in a different clinical role to support the Covid-

159

19 response, with most supporting Covid-19 care, with some supporting research, public health or

160

diagnostics, and 20% reported stepping up into a more senior clinical role.

161
162

Accessibility and implementation of CMGs

163

Most of the respondents (67%) reported having used a Covid-19 CMG to guide clinical decision-

164

making within the last two weeks. A majority of the respondents, 87% (44/51) used a local or

165

national CMG, and 27% (14/51) also the WHO CMG to guide clinical decision making. About a third

166

(38%, 27/73) reported a need for additional or updated CMGs, particularly for critically ill people in

167

hospital (96%), people treated at home (73%), children and for pregnant women. Just over half

168

(57%, 40/70) of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they had received sufficient training in

169

caring for Covid-19 patients and 77% (43/65) that they felt confident in implementing the

170

recommendations in the available Covid-19 CMGs, but only 58% (41/71) to having access to the

171

treatment and equipment needed to implement the recommendations. This proportion was higher

172

amongst respondents based in LMICs, reporting limited access to oxygen, ventilators, observational,

173

specimen collection and personal protective equipment (Fig 3).

175

Inclusivity of CMGs

176

The responses show good access to CMGs providing recommendations for adults, but limited access

177

to evidence-based recommendations for other risk groups, with only 20% (15/76) of respondents

178

reporting having access to CMGs that covered guidance on treatment decisions for children, 25% for

179

pregnant women, 32% for people who are immunosuppressed and 50% for older adults (>65) years

180

presenting with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. None of the respondents from LMIC reported

181

having access to CMGs for care of children or pregnant women with Covid-19 (Fig.4).

182
183

Recommendations on improvements of CMG development

184

Themes that were identified from the respondents were a need to harmonize international CMG

185

development, to use resources effectively, minimize guidelines variations, and during uncertainty

186

and limited evidence, formulate recommendations through international consensus. Guideline

187

transparency was recommended, highlighting where the evidence base is limited or uncertain.

188

Many respondents called for CMGs to include recommendations for different at-risk groups, such as

189

children, and to be applicable to lower resourced settings. There were also calls for supportive care

190

and treatment recommendations to be more comprehensive, and cover follow up care.

191

Importantly, implementation of CMGs needs to be supported with sufficient training, access to

192

recommended treatment as well as personal protective equipment for staff. Moreover, to facilitate

193

implementation, CMGs should be brief and supported with clear flowcharts. Some respondents

194

reported that the available CMGs were out of date, a living guideline approach, for readily updating

195

CMGs as new evidence emerges was recommended.

196
197

Discussion

198

These findings highlight crucial areas for improvement when developing infectious disease CMGs for

199

emerging pathogens during public health emergencies. Our data shows that despite good access to

200

CMGs for COVID-19, there were gaps in scope, applicability and inclusivity, including limited access

201

to CMGs containing recommendations for children, pregnant women and older people. For COVID-

202

19 and other infectious diseases, these groups may present different risks regarding epidemiology,

203

severity and complications, and may present with different symptomatology, which must be

204

considered for timely identification and diagnosis and optimal management and treatment

205

strategies. Similar gaps in scope and inclusivity have been identified in systematic reviews of CMGs

206

for other viral infectious diseases. These vulnerable risk groups may be disproportionately affected

207

in health crises (20), and require care appropriate to their needs throughout the response to

208

safeguard against potentially avoidable deaths (11). Further, this survey identified that limited

209

access to evidence based recommended medical treatments and equipment was a critical barrier to

210

the implementation of available COVID-19 CMGs, especially affecting LMIC settings. This highlights

211

the discordance between guideline development, often undertaken by stakeholders in HICs (2), and

212

clinical practice in varied contexts subject to suboptimal resource availability. Further, the lack of

213

attention to considering the realities of guideline implementation, especially in low resource

214

contexts.

215
216

Our data also highlights that during an emergency frontline staff may have to task-shift, support

217

other specialties and step up to take on new responsibilities. Clinicians rely on CMGS to turn the best

218

available evidence into clinical practice to improve patient outcomes. To do so requires ready access

219

to high-quality guidelines applicable to relevant patient groups and contexts. In emergencies, where

220

time and evidence are limited, strict guideline development standards may seem inflexible and

221

unnecessary. Nevertheless, clinicians must trust that available CMGs are evidence-based, as well as

222

relevant to implementation in their local context. Our data demonstrate that directly transferring

223

CMGs between contexts, specifically those developed in HICs to LMICs, may not always be

224

appropriate or effective. The COVID-19 pandemic has generated new evidence at unprecedented

225

speed, highlighting that CMG developers need to consider tools for rapidly updating and re-

226

disseminating CMGs as new evidence emerges.

227
228

Whilst there is a definite role for leadership bodies that can widely disseminate guidelines, well-

229

resourced organisations such as WHO need to engage diverse stakeholders from different resourced

230

settings to ensure that CMGs address the needs of different risk populations. A previous study

231

showed that fewer guidelines and less locally-relevant trial evidence are produced in LMICs (3).

232

Other studies have shown that local guidelines developed in collaboration with local stakeholders

233

are more likely to be effectively implemented, as these better account for available resources,

234

specialist skills, and cultural influences; thus promoting ownership and focusing on specific

235

contextual needs (3,21). As Atkins et al. (22) put it: “Evidence does not form recommendations on its

236

own.” Guideline development requires multiple inputs beyond scientific evidence, including expert

237

opinion and previous experiences, especially for new emerging diseases like COVID-19 where

238

evidence is limited. Social science literature further emphasises the interaction of these aspects, and

239

the importance of understanding the social processes of how guideline development committees

240

with different backgrounds and priorities interact and communicate, influencing how evidence is

241

considered (23).

242
243

De novo guideline development is resource-intensive and all setting may not have the resources to

244

develop CMGs during a novel epidemic or pandemic, yet more adaptable approaches require

245

existing CMGs to be high-quality and up-to-date (24). Following Dagens et al. (2), a ‘living guidelines’

246

approach as recently adopted by WHO may better adapt to rapidly evolving emerging outbreaks

247

(25,26). This should include a flexible tiered approach, with recommendations tailored to different

248

resourced health systems, enabling sites to switch between tiers as resources becomes available or

249

depleted. Local prioritisation processes in the form of rapid research needs appraisals could also

250

identify key contextual areas to update (27,28).

252

Whilst the survey was disseminated widely, the response rate was limited by the ongoing pandemic

253

response. Despite these limitations, the responses represent a wide range of settings globally, and

254

identifies critical gaps and a unique cross-sectional insight into the access, inclusivity, and

255

implementation of CMGs early on during a pandemic response.

256
257

This study highlights gaps in inclusivity of and access to COVID-19 CMGs for different resourced

258

settings and populations, and challenges in implementation during an emergency. The findings

259

highlight a need for a new evidence-based framework for infectious diseases CMG development.

260

This framework should include stakeholders from different resourced settings, to ensure locally

261

relevant challenges and priorities are addressed. CMGs needs to be flexible, and adaptable to new

262

emerging evidence and situations, considering implementation support for different settings. A living

263

review framework addressing implementation facilitators were recommended. A failure to invest in

264

an updated framework for infectious disease CMG development risks widening health inequalities.
