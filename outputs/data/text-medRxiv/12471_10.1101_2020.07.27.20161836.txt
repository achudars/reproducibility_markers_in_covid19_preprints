Abstract
In the last few months, there has been a global catastrophic outbreak of severe acute
respiratory syndrome disease caused by the novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2 affecting
millions of people worldwide. Early diagnosis and isolation is key to contain the rapid spread
of the virus. Towards this goal, we report a simple, sensitive and rapid method to detect the
virus using a targeted mass spectrometric approach, which can directly detect the presence of
virus from naso-oropharyngeal swabs. Using a multiple reaction monitoring we can detect the
presence of two peptides specific to SARS-CoV-2 in a 2.3 minute gradient run with 100%
specificity and 90.4 % sensitivity when compared to RT-PCR. Importantly, we further show
that these peptides could be detected even in the patients who have recovered from the
symptoms and have tested negative for the virus by RT-PCR highlighting the sensitivity of
the technique. This method has the translational potential of in terms of the rapid diagnostics
of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 and can augment current methods available for
diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction:
The world is in the midst of a pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona
virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). More than 15 million individuals from 200 countries have been
infected with this virus, which resulted in over 600,000 deaths [1]. Disconcertingly, even after
seven months from the first reported case in Wuhan, China, in December, 2019 [2], the
number of cases are on the rise with more than 200,000 new cases being reported daily
[1].One of the way to reduce the disease propagation is early diagnosis and isolating people
infected with the virus. For this, mass testing is the need of the hour. At such a scale, it is
critical to innovatively leverage existing infrastructure to build surge capacity and investigate
low cost, high throughput methods.

Among the various methods available or developed recently, for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2,
RT-PCR is still the gold standard. Despite RT-PCR being well established and widely
available, many problems have emerged in actual performance, ranging from suboptimal
sensitivity, especially as the virus mutates, to low throughput due to many intermediate steps
and long reaction times[3]. Additionally, specialized reagents are necessary for RT-PCR,
which increases the cost of the test. Apart from this, rapid antigen tests are also being
extensively used in various countries for preliminary screening. These tests are based on
detection of antigens from the nasopharyngeal swab using antibodies. A positive test confirms
the presence of the virus, but a negative test is inconclusive since the sensitivity of the antigen
testis between 34-80% [4]. Thus, a highly sensitive method is required to directly detect the
virus from the nasopharyngeal swab to facilitate rapid screening. Mass spectrometer with
high accuracy and sensitivity can be an ideal platform to identify viral peptides with medium
to high throughput.
Mass spectrometry (MS) based viral peptide detection have earlier been used for detection of
viral proteins [5-7].Identification of SARS-CoV-2 specific peptides from nasopharyngeal
swab have also been reported recently [8-10]. Gouveia et al. [8] used SARS-CoV-2 infected
cell lysate to identify 2 peptides and validated these peptides in nasopharyngeal swab only in
5 samples with 60% sensitivity. Ihling et al. [9] used gargle solution of 3 infected patients and
report the identification of 1 peptide from nucleoprotein using a 180 minute gradient.

Cardozo et al. [10] have reported the detection of three peptides using a 10.5 min run time
with 83% sensitivity and 96% specificity.
In this study, we report a simple and rapid method that could detect two peptides,
QIAPGQTGK and AIVSTIQRKYK, from structural spike glycoprotein and replicase
polyprotein 1ab respectively in 2.3 minute gradient with a sensitivity of 90.4% and specificity
of 100%. Using follow up samples of patients who have symptomatically recovered and also
tested negative for RT-PCR analyses, we show that these peptides are present in these
samples indicating the potential of asymptomatic diagnosis of COVID-19 in patients.
Methods:
Clinical sample collection:
Upper respiratory tract sample (nasopharyngeal swab and oropharyngeal swab) were
collected in virus transport medium and samples were analyzed using COBAS 6800
automated system (Roche, Basel)according to the manufacturers guidelines[11]. This study
was approved by institutional ethics committees of National Centre for Disease Control, New
Delhi and CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Delhi.
Sample preparation:
Naso and oropharyngeal swab collected in viral transport media (VTM) were inactivated by
incubation of samples with lysis buffer (25% guanidinium thiocyanate and 5% SDS) for 20
min at room temperature [12]. To this, 100 µl sodium deoxycholate (0.15% w/v) per ml of
sample was added and was incubated for 10 min at room temperature followed by addition of
20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for protein precipitation. The samples were then
centrifuged at 15,000g for 15 min at 4ºC. Pellets were washed three times with pre-chilled
acetone and protein pellets were resuspended in 100 mM Tris-HCl with 8 M urea (pH-8.5).

Identification of SARS-CoV-2 proteins using high-resolution mass spectrometry

Proteins extracted from the nasopharyngeal swab of eight RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19
patients were pooled and 300 µg of protein was reduced with 25mM dithiothreitol for 25
minutes at 56°C, followed by alkylation using 55mM iodoacetamide (IAA) at room
temperature for 20 minutes in dark. This sample was subjected to trypsin digestion

(sequencing grade, Promega) using an enzyme-substrate ratio of 1:10 for 18 hours at 37°C
and dried under vacuum. The digested peptides were then fractionated into 8 fractions using
cation exchange chromatography using a SCX Cartridge (5 micron, 300 Å bead from AB
Sciex, USA).A step-gradient of increasing concentration of ammonium formate buffer (35
mM, 50 mM, 75 mM, 100 mM, 125 mM, 150 mM, 250 mM and 350 mM ammonium
formate, 30% v/v acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid; pH = 2.9) was used to elute the peptides.

1. (b).LC-MS/MS data acquisition:
The fractionated peptides were analyzed on a quadrupole-TOF hybrid mass spectrometer
(TripleTOF 6600, Sciex, USA) coupled to a nano-LC system (Eksigent NanoLC-425) in data
dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. Peptides from each fractions were cleaned using C18
Ziptip (Merck, USA) and 4 µg of these peptides were loaded on a trap-column (ChromXP
C18CL 5µm 120Å, Eksigent) where desalting was performed with a flow rate of 10 µl per
minutes for 10 minutes. Peptides were separated on a reverse phase C18 analytical column
(ChromXP C18, 3µm 120 Å, Eksigent) at a flow rate of 5 µl/minute using buffer A (water
with 0.1 % formic acid) and buffer B (acetonitrile with 0.1 % formic acid) with following
gradient: buffer B was increased gradually from 3% to 25% in first 38 minutes. It was
increased to 32% solvent B in next 5 minutes, in the next 2 minutes buffer B was ramped up
to 80% and 90% in further 0.5 min. It was held at the same concentration for next 2.5
minutes. Buffer B was brought to initial 3% concentration in next 1 minute and column was
reconditioned for 8 minutes before next run.
Ion source parameters were set to 5.5 kV for the ion spray voltage, 25 psi for the
curtain gas, 15 psi for the nebulizer gas and 250°C as temperature. For DDA, a 1.8 s
instrument cycle was repeated in high sensitivity mode throughout the whole gradient,
consisting of a full scan MS spectrum (400–1250 m/z) with accumulation time of 0.25 s,
followed by 30 MS/MS experiments (100–1500 m/z) with 0.050 s accumulation time each, on
MS precursors with charge state 2+ to 5+ exceeding a 150 cps threshold. Rolling collision
energy was used and former target ions were excluded for 15 s.

1.(c).Database search:
For viral protein identification, a merged search for 8 DDA runs was performed in Protein
Pilot software v5.0.1 (Sciex, USA) with paragon algorithm.. The parameters used were as
follows: Cysteine alkylation—IAA, digestion—trypsin and 2 missed cleavages were allowed.
The search effort was set to ‘Thorough ID’ and false discovery rate (FDR) analysis was
enabled. Proteins identified with 1% global FDR were considered. The search was carried out
against a UniProt database containing thirteenSARS-CoV-2 proteins.

2. Selection of peptides for validation phase:
2. (a). Protein BLAST search:
Protein BLAST search was performed for each of the identified peptide with non-redundant
protein sequences (nr) database using NCBI blastp suite by using default parameters for short
sequence search.

2.(b). Peptide variability analysis:
To check whether the identified peptides fall in the invariable region of proteins in SARSCoV-2, their sequence homology was checked with protein sequences of around 54,000
SARS-CoV-2 strains submitted in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data
(GISAID) in FASTA format (version 01July2020).Different protein sequences were
segregated and aligned, to observe the variability of the identified peptides amongst different
strains. JalView tool was used for viewing the consensus of peptides over all the strains [13].
3. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific proteins:
3. i. Method standardization:
A short scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM) method, with a retention time
window of 20 seconds was developed with the unique viral peptides identified in DDA runs,
with multiple transitions for each of the peptides. Sample preparation was performed as
described above and data acquisition was performed using a triple quadrupole hybrid ion trap
mass spectrometer (QTrap 6500+, Sciex) coupled with a Sciex ExionLC UHPLC system.

Tryptic peptides were loaded on an Acquity CSH C18 column (1.7µm 2.1x100mm, Waters)
and separated using a binary gradient with buffer A (0.1% formic acid in water) and buffer B
(0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). Peptides were loaded on column with a flow-rate of 600
µL per minute and 98% buffer A. Buffer B concentration was increased from initial 2% to
10% in 0.2minutes and to 50% in 1.1minutes. Buffer B concentration was ramped-up to 90%
in another 0.2minute and held at the same gradient for 0.1 minute and then brought to initial
2% in the next 0.1minute and held at the same concentration for 0.6. The total gradient was
for 2.3 minutes. Peak review was performed using MultiQuant 3.0(Sciex).
3. ii. Serology test for detection of antibody against SARS-CoV-2
To check if the individuals had developed antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, we collected
blood samples (5 ml) in vacutainer tubes from individuals and separated the plasma by
centrifugation. Presence of antibodies was detected using Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 on
Cobas e411, Roche.

Mass

Spectrometry:
We initially performed a data dependent acquisition of a pool of eight symptomatic RT-PCR
confirmed patients using high resolution mass spectrometer as mentioned in the methods
section. We identified 22 peptides from 4 proteins of SARS-CoV-2with 1% False discovery
rate (FDR). We identified three structural proteins-spike glycoprotein (spike), nucleoprotein
(NP) and envelope small membrane protein (ENV) and a protein replicase polyprotein 1ab
(Rep) from non-structural part (Supplementary Table 1)-Among these, eight peptides from 3
proteins (Rep, Spike and NP), that were unique and un-modified was selected for generation
of an in-house sMRM method for SARS-CoV-2 specific protein detection in patients (Table
1).

4.2(a). Protein BLAST search:
We also performed Protein BLAST searches with non-redundant protein sequences (nr)
database using NCBI blastp suite. The search revealed that seven of the eight peptides were

unique to SARS-CoV-2. They were AIVSTIQRKYK and MDGSIIQFPN of Rep,
QIAPGQTGK, LIANQFNSAIGK, AHFPREGVFVSNGTHWFVTQR and STNLVKNK of
Spike and ADETQALPQR of NP.
4.2(b). Peptides in conserved regions
Sequences for more than 54,000 strains of SARS-CoV-2 have been documented in GISAID
up to July 1, 2020. This gave us an opportunity to check if the peptides selected were in the
invariant region. Screening through protein sequences of all these strains we found these
peptides to be completely conserved among different SARS-CoV2 strains and showed no
variability in the peptide sequences (Supplementary Figure 1). Few strain sequences in the
GISAID database show gaps and variations, probably due to low sequence quality or host
editing.
4.3. (a)Detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific proteins:
For diagnostic purposes, it is important to obtain the desired results in the shortest possible
time. Keeping this in mind, we developed a short scheduled multiple reaction monitoring
(sMRM) method of 2.3minutes with multiple transitions for each of the identified peptides.
Based on the consistency and quality of the peaks in the ion chromatogram we included two
peptides- AIVSTIQRKYK from Rep and QIAPGQTGK from spike in the sMRM method
(Figure 1). Apart from that, we also included an additional peptide of serum albumin as an
internal control for protein amount (Figure 1). The optimized parameters used for the MRM
method, to detect SARS-CoV-2 proteins in patient samples are provided in Supplementary
Table 2.We considered a sample to be positive for SARS-CoV-2, if overlapping transitions
were present with an intensity of greater than 1.5x103 and a signal to noise ratio of greater
than 10for either of the two selected peptides.
4.3(b) Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in naso-oropharyngeal swab samples:
We analyzed 102 samples using the sMRM method developed in two different sample sets.
The first set consisted of 20 samples (including follow up) from 14 patients for whom we had
follow up RT-PCR data (Table 2). Interestingly, although most of the patients had recovered
as was evident from their being RT-PCR negative and being free of symptoms, we found that
they continue to retain the peptides even after 14 days (Sample 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 in Table 2) of
initial infection. In 2 of the patients (sample 1 and 14), RT-PCR was found to be negative
while the patients had symptoms. One of these patients (sample 14) was found to be negative

on the 1st day but was found positive on the second day while we found peptide peaks to be
present on both the days, clearly indicating the sensitivity of the sMRM method.
In the second set we analyzed 82 case control samples. Among these 63 were RT-PCR
positive and considered as patients. For controls, we considered 19 individuals who had
negative RT-PCR and did not have any antibodies as evident from negative serology test
indicating the absence of IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Mass spectrometric analysis
revealed that in all the 19 negative samples, peptides were not detected. Of the 63 positive
samples, 57 were found to be positive using our method. Thus, our method has a sensitivity of
90.4% and specificity of 100% with respect to RT-PCR positive samples and true controls
(serologically negative, RT-PCR negative).
Discussion:
The objective of the study was to develop a simple and rapid targeted mass spectrometric
method (sMRM) to identify peptides specific to SARS-CoV-2. For this, we initially analyzed
samples in high resolution mass spectrometer and identified eight unique and unmodified
peptides from three proteins of SARS-CoV-2. These peptides were unique to SARS-CoV-2
and most importantly lay in the invariant region as revealed by analysis of more than 54,000
SARS-CoV-2 strains sequences submitted in GSAID up to 1st July 2020. This indicates that
even if there are mutations in the virus, it should not affect the sequence of the peptides
chosen. Using these peptides, we developed a short, 2.3 minutes, gradient for the sMRM
method and selected two peptides AIVSTIQRKYK from Replicase and QIAPGQTGK from
Spike protein of SARS CoV-2 based on the consistency and quality of the spectra. Apart from
these two peptides, we also included one peptide of human serum albumin AEFAEVSK as a
control for protein amount. This was important since in a few samples we found that the
intensities of albumin transitions were very low indicating low protein concentration and if
the viral load is low in such samples it could result in false negative results. These samples
were thus not considered.
Using this method we analyzed 102 naso-oropharyngeal samples in two sets. In the first set,
we included 20 samples from 14 patients for which RT-PCR data of two or more time points
was available. Interestingly, peptide peaks were detected in patients who recovered from the
symptoms and were RT-PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, peptide peaks were
observed in two symptomatic patients who tested negative with RT-PCR of which one was
tested positive in subsequent RT-PCR indicating false negative RT-PCR in the first instance.

Thus, the data indicates high sensitivity of the current method and can be used for initial
diagnosis including diagnosis of asymptomatic cases.
In the second set, we analyzed case control samples. As discussed previously, patients who
have recovered, and were RT-PCR negative also show peptide peaks. For this, we considered
healthy individuals with no exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus as revealed by serology tests for
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2and RT-PCR. These are the true controls since they neither
have any active infection, nor had been infected by the virus, previously. We considered a
sample to be positive for SARS-CoV-2, if overlapping transitions were present with an
intensity of greater than 1.5x103 and a signal to noise ratio of greater than 10 for either of the
two selected peptides. This value was chosen since there will be residual peaks from carryover of the previous sample and it was observed that the median values of the peaks in blank
due to carry over were 2x102-4.5x102 depending on the transition with a maximum intensity.
Thus, to negate the carry over effect we only considered peaks with intensity more than three
times of this (1.5 x103).Using this criterion; we could distinguish SARS-CoV-2 virus infected
individuals from uninfected ones with high specificity (100%) and sensitivity (90.4%) when
compared with the RT-PCR.
There are several advantages of using mass spectrometer for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.
The swab samples can be directly collected in vials containing inactivation buffer ensuring
safe transport and handling of the samples. The major advantage of our method is its short run
time with a 2.3 minute gradient which is the fastest reported till date for detection of SARSCoV-2 peptides. Cardozo et al. (2020) reported a MRM with a gradient of 10.5 minutes that
could detect SARS-CoV-2 peptides with a sensitivity of 83%. Interestingly, they used fully
automated sample preparation protocol using robotic liquid handler and turbulent flow
chromatography, multiplexed for online sample clean-up and UPLC separation that enabled
them to run 4 samples within the 10.5 min. run. However, this kind of setup will only be
available in state-of-the-art laboratories and hence cannot be used for regular diagnostic
purpose. In contrast, our method can be used in any laboratory equipped with a triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer.
One of the perceived disadvantages of using mass spectrometry based diagnostics is the cost
of the equipment, however, the per sample assay cost (less than $3 per sample) is
considerably lower when compared to other methods like RT-PCR. We thus, propose that
targeted mass spectrometry should currently be explored for screening and diagnostic
purpose, which can augment the number of tests that are currently being carried out to detect
