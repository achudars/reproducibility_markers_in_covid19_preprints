Abstract
Background: A wide range of evidence has shown that healthcare workers, currently on the
frontlines in the fight against COVID-19, are not spared from the psychological and mental
health-related consequences of the pandemic. Studies synthesizing the role of coping behaviours,
psychological resilience, and social support in safeguarding the mental health of HCWs during
the pandemic is largely unknown.
Aim (s): To appraise and synthesize studies examining psychological resilience, coping
behaviours, and social support among healthcare workers (HWCs) during the coronavirus
pandemic.
Design: This is a systematic review with a narrative synthesis.
Method: Using articles from PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS, MEDLINE and PsychINFO, a total
of 31 articles were included in the review. Reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses statement guidelines.
Results: Healthcare workers were found to have moderate to high levels of psychological
resilience and utilized both problem-centred coping (e.g., use of social support, praying) and

emotion-centred coping (e.g., use of diversionary activities) to manage the stress-associated with
the coronavirus pandemic. Coping behaviours, psychological resilience, and social support were
associated with positive mental and psychological health outcomes.
Conclusion: Substantial evidence supports the effectiveness of coping behaviours, psychological
resilience, and social support to preserve psychological and mental health among HCWs during
the COVID-19 pandemic.
Relevance to Practice: In order to safeguard the mental health and well-being of HCWs during
the pandemic, hospital and nursing administrators should focus on building coping skills,
psychological resilience, and social support in HWCs through innovative and theory-based
interventions, supportive leadership, and fostering a resilient work environment.

COVID-19
Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is an urgent health concern worldwide that greatly affects the
mental health, well-being, and possibly work effectiveness of healthcare workers (HCWs). The
pandemic has placed increased demands on healthcare workers due to an influx of COVID-19
patients, a shortage of trained healthcare professionals, and limited hospital resources (McMahon
et al., 2020). These factors could potentially affect their mental, emotional, and psychological
health and well-being (Alharbi et al., 2020). Hospital administrators should pay attention to the
mental well-being of HCWs as poorer mental health may put them at greater risk for PTSD and
even suicide (Reger et al., 2020).

Mounting evidence indicates that HCWs have suffered a deterioration in their mental and
psychological health during the coronavirus pandemic, with reports from individual and review
studies showing higher prevalence rates of anxiety, burnout, depression, PTSD, and
psychological distress among HCWs compared to the general public (Chew et al., 2020;
Shechter et al., 2020). In a systematic meta-analysis by Serrano-Ripoll et al., (2020) the pooled
prevalence rate of stress among HCWs during the pandemic was 40%; furthermore, 30% of
HCWs in the pooled analysis had anxiety, 28% experienced burnout, 24% had depression, and
13% had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Factors known to contribute to poorer mental
health were categorized into sociodemographic factors and organizational factors.
Sociodemographic factors included younger age (Serrano-Ripoll et al., 2020), female sex (Sahin
et al., 2020; Serrano-Ripoll et al., 2020), being in the nursing profession (Vizhen et al., 2020;
Shaukat et al., 2020), a history of psychiatric illness, and a history of requiring psychiatric
support (Sahin et al., 2020). Organizational factors that contributed to poorer mental health
included assignment in high-risk units or wards, absence of structured trainings or updates
related to coronavirus, and inadequate supplies and equipment needed to protect against the
infection (Vizhen et al., 2020; Alshekaili et al., 2020).
Coping behaviours and psychological resilience have been identified as important
strategies to facilitate an individual’s ability to positively rebound and adapt to stressful
situations, hardship, traumatic events, and adversity in order to maintain optimal mental and
psychological health (Hart, Brannan, & De Chesnay, 2014). Evidence suggests that during
stressful events (including disasters, calamities, and disease outbreak), individuals are more
likely to suffer adverse mental and psychological consequences when they are not equipped with
sufficient levels of resilience and coping abilities (Labrague et al., 2018; Duncan, 2020). Support

from peers, colleagues, family, and friends has also been shown to help individuals sustain
emotional balance in the face of threats and stress-inducing events (Langford et al., 1997). A
wide range of studies have reported an association between higher social support and improved
health and well-being among nurses and other healthcare workers during emergency situations
and other disaster events (Labrague et al., 2018). Earlier studies conducted during other
infectious disease outbreaks such as SARS, Ebola, and MERS-CoV identified a protective role
for psychological resilience, coping behaviours, and social support in HCWs against the
psychological and mental health burden of caring for infected patients (Bloom et al., Baduge et
al., 2018). Meanwhile, studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic have shown a similar
pattern: psychological resilience, coping behaviours, and social support safeguard mental health
and well-being among healthcare workers who are on the frontlines of the fights against this
deadly virus (Labrague & De los Santos, 2020; Blanco-Donoso et al., 2020; Chew et al., 2020).
Despite the abundance of empirical studies on the topic, no studies have systematically
synthesized and integrated the results. A broader perspective on the topic of protective factors for
psychological and mental health among HCWs is vital for the formulation of effective
organizational strategies to better support the mental health of HCWs on the frontlines of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, this systematic review was conducted to synthesize and integrate
evidence pertaining to healthcare workers’ psychological resilience, coping behaviours, and
social support during the coronavirus pandemic.

Methods
Design
This is a systematic review with a narrative synthesis with results reported according to
the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol.
Data Sources and Search Strategies
Relevant studies were identified through electronic database searches using PubMed,
CINAHL, SCOPUS, MEDLINE, and PsychINFO from August 2020 to October 2020. The
following MeSH and search terms (‘psychological resilience’, ‘psychological adaptation’ OR
‘coping’, ‘mental health’, ‘health personnel’ OR ‘healthcare workers’, ‘social support’, and
‘2019-nCoV’ OR ‘COVID-19’ OR ‘SARS-CoV-2’ OR ‘severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2’) were used individually and in combination using Boolean operators (AND, OR
and NOT). In addition, cited literature in the articles reviewed were also checked for potentially
relevant studies (Figure 1).
Inclusion Criteria
This review included primary studies assessing psychological resilience, coping, and
social support among healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The inclusion
criteria were as follows: study participants were healthcare workers, study was peer-reviewed,
published since the onset of the pandemic, and published in the English language. In this review,
healthcare workers are defined as people who work in healthcare settings to provide healthcare
services to patients – including doctors, nurses, midwives, nursing assistants, radiologists,
physiotherapists, pharmacists, healthcare assistants, and psychologists. Only studies with

quantitative designs were included in this review to facilitate homogeneity of the included
papers.
Search Outcomes
The initial search yielded 478 articles. One hundred eighteen articles remained after
screening titles and abstracts based on the inclusion criteria. After full text reading of the articles,
a total of 31 articles were deemed relevant to the review (Figure 1).
Appraisal of Methodological Quality
Two independent researchers appraised the quality of the articles using the Joanna Briggs
Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal for Analytical Cross-Sectional Studies in order to avoid
selection bias. The JBI appraisal checklist consisted of eight items examining inclusion criteria,
subjects and settings, measurement exposure, use of objective and standard criteria for
measurement conditions, confounding variables, management of confounding variables,
outcomes measurement, and data analysis. Studies that fulfilled at least five assessment criteria
were included in the review. After quality appraisal, thirty-one studies were included in this
review.
Data Extraction and Synthesis
Extraction and appraisal of data was completed by two independent researchers. Using a
data matrix template, the following data were extracted from the studies: authors, year of
publication, country, research approach, samples, measures, key findings, and quality score
(Table 1). Due to heterogeneity in the scales used and in the findings of the included studies,
statistical pooling was not possible. As such, we used a narrative synthesis to describe the

findings. In particular, constant comparison analysis (Miles & Huberman, 1994) was performed
to compare findings across studies and to identify patterns and commonalities between studies.
Study Characteristics
Thirty-one articles were included in the review. A majority of studies were conducted in
China (14), with the remaining studies conducted in Italy (5), Philippines (2), the United States
(2), Turkey (2), Spain (2), Israel (1), Palestine (1), Pakistan (1), and Egypt (1). Sample sizes
ranged from 10 to 4,618 participants. Most of the HCWs included in the studies were nurses,
doctors, nursing assistants, midwives, radiologists, physiotherapists, pharmacists, healthcare
assistants, or psychologists.
Most studies had a cross-sectional research design (n = 30), mostly using online surveys,
and one study had longitudinal research design. Most studies utilized standardized scales to
measure psychological resilience, coping skills, and social support in HCWs. Six studies utilized
research-designed questionnaires/items to identify coping skills in HCWs. The Cronbach’s
alphas ranged from 0.81 to 0.96 in studies that reported internal consistency.
Methodological Quality Score
Using the JBI critical appraisal checklist, the majority of the studies were rated as
moderate in quality (26/31) and five were rated high. Issues related to identification of potential
confounding variables and how these confounders were managed and controlled were common
in the included articles.

Major Findings
Study results were classified into the following categories: (1) levels of resilience and
coping, (2) specific coping skills, (3) coping in relation to mental health, (4) resilience in relation
to mental health, and (5) social support in relation to mental health.
Levels of Psychological Resilience and Coping
Six studies reported data on level of psychological resilience (Bozdag & Ergun, 2020;
Huang et al., 2020a; Huang et al., 2020b; Khalaf et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2020; Labrague & De
los Santos, 2020a) and three studies described level of coping behaviours in HCWs (Lin et al.,
2020; Nie et al., 2020; Mi et al., 2020). High levels of psychological resilience were reported in
three studies (Bozdag & Ergun, 2020; Huang et al., 2020a; Lin et al., 2020) and moderate levels
of psychological resilience were reported in four studies (Luceno-Moreno et al., 2020; Huang et
al., 2020b; Khalaf et al., 2020; Labrague & De los Santos, 2020a). In one cross-sectional study
of HCWs assigned to radiology units in China, online survey data indicated that 83.8% of
participants reported higher psychological resilience (Huang et al., 2020a). Similarly, a study by
Lin et al. (2020) reported high levels of resilience in Chinese HCWs; however, among them,
nurses were found to have lower resilience when compared to doctors and other medical staff. In
a study from Turkey, HCWs scored 18.43 points out of a possible 30 points on the brief
resilience scale (BRS), indicating a greater capability to rebound from the adversity associated
with the coronavirus pandemic. On the other hand, four cross-sectional studies reported moderate
levels of psychological resilience among physicians (Khalaf et al., 2020), medical staff (Huang
et al., 2020b), and hospital nurses (Labrague & De los Santos, 2020a) who were on the frontlines
during the pandemic. In another study, HCWs in Spain obtained a mean score of 3.02 on the

Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), indicating a moderate capacity to bounce back to a healthy state in
the face of adversity (Luceno-Moreno et al., 2020).
With regards to coping mechanisms, three studies measured ways of coping among
HCWs using the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (Lin et al., 2020; Nie et al., 2020) and a
researcher-designed coping behaviour scale (Mi et al., 2020). The three studies reported higher
scores for positive vs. negative coping mechanisms, suggesting that when confronted with stressinducing events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, HCWs are able to utilize positive coping
mechanisms.
Specific Coping Skills
Fourteen studies identified specific coping mechanisms employed by HCWs during the
pandemic (Blanco-Donoso et al., 2020; Cai, 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Chew et al., 2020; Dong et
al., 2020; Giusti et al., 2020; Labrague & De los Santos, 2020; Maraqa et al., 2020; Mi et al.,
2020; Nie et al., 2020; Salman et al., 2020; Shechter et al., 2020; Vagni et al., 2020; Xiao et al.,
2020). During the pandemic, HCWs utilized both negative and positive coping styles to manage
stress.
Among these ten studies reporting specific coping styles among HCWs during the
pandemic, eleven quantitative studies (Cai, 2020; Blanco-Donoso et al., 2020; Chew et al., 2020;
Dong et al., 2020; Giusti et al., 2020; Labrague & De los Santos, 2020; Nie et al., 2020; Xiao et
al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Maraqa et al., 2020; Vagni et al., 2020) indicated that HCWs use
support from and communication with family, friends, and colleagues as their primary coping
mechanisms to manage the adverse mental health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Religious coping mechanisms such as praying were reported as an important coping mechanism

in three cross-sectional studies. For instance, in two separate studies involving HCWs in Pakistan
(Salman et al., 2020) and Palestine (Maraqa et al., 2020), praying and other religious activities
were the highest-ranked coping mechanisms. In the United States, where prevalence of COVID19 is highest, frontline emergency healthcare workers identified religious coping mechanisms
such as praying as one of the most important ways to combat the mental and psychological
burden of the pandemic (Shechter et al., 2020).
Involvement in distraction activities (such as engaging in sports, exercise, music, yoga, or
meditation) were also identified as an important coping mechanisms utilized by HCWs during
the height of the pandemic (Shechter et al., 2020; Maraqa et al., 2020; Mi et al., 2020; Chen et
al., 2020; Dong et al., 2020). Other coping mechanisms identified by HCWs included learning
about COVID-19 and its prevention (Chen et al., 2020; Cai, 2020) and adherence to infection
control guidelines (Dong et al., 2020; Cai 2020; Maraqa et al., 2020).
Coping in Relation to Mental Health
Nine studies described the interaction between coping skills and mental health in HCWs
during the COVID-19 pandemic (Baboe et al., 2020; Chew et al., 2020; Di Monte et al., 2020;
Hou et al., 2020; Maiorano et al., 2020; Mi et al., 2020; Nie et al., 2020; Vagni et al., 2020; Zhu
et al., 2020;). The use of positive coping mechanisms such as seeking social support, positive
thinking, and problem solving were associated with lower levels of traumatic stress, stigma
(Chew et al., 2020), psychological distress (Baboe et al., 2020), stress symptoms (Nie et al.,
2020), anxiety, and depression (Zhu et al., 2020; Mi et al., 2020). On the other hand, utilization
of negative coping skills, such as avoidance, were strongly linked with increased levels of
emotional stress (Chew et al., 2020), PTSD symptoms (Hou et al., 2020), psychological distress
(Nei et al., 2020; Baboe et al., 2020), and fatigue (Hou et al., 2020). In one study, the use of
10

emotion-centred and avoidant coping styles were associated with increased levels of emotional
exhaustion, while problem-centred coping styles were strongly associated with decreased scores
on the depersonalization subscale and increased scores on the personal accomplishment subscale
of the MBI (Di Monte et al., 2020). Interestingly, unlike previous studies, a two separate studies
in Italy found that the use of a negative coping style – specifically, the blocking of unpleasant
emotions and thoughts – was found to effectively reduce psychological distress (Vagni et al.,
2020) and PTSD (Maiorano et al., 2020). Vagni et al. (2020) and Maiorano et al., (2020) both
argued that by blocking negative emotions, HCWs are able to continue their work and
experience lower perceived levels of stress.
Resilience in Relation to Mental Health
A number of papers examined the effects of psychological resilience on the mental health
of HCWs (12/31) (Di Monte et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020a; Khalaf et al., 2020; Labrague &
De los Santos, 2020a; Labrague & De los Santos, 2020b; Li et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2020;
Lucero-Moreno et al., 2020; Maiorano et al., 2020; Mohave et al., 2020; Tam et al., 2020; Yoruk
& Guler, 2020). Of these, eight studies reported a protective role of psychological resilience
against coronavirus-related anxiety. Increased psychological resilience in HCWs was associated
with lower incidence of pandemic-related anxiety among nurses working in hospitals (Labrague
& De los Santos, 2020a) and public health centres (Labrague & De los Santos, 2020b). Results
obtained from Israel and Egypt showed a similar pattern in which lower levels of coronavirusrelated anxiety were associated with higher levels of resilience (Mosheva et al., 2020; Khalaf et
al., 2020). In two separate studies from China, HCWs with higher scores on psychological
resilience measures reported significantly lower levels of anxiety than those who obtained lower
scores on psychological resilience measures (Huang et al., 2020a; Lin et al., 2020). In a study

involving 720 healthcare workers in the United States, resilient participants were more likely
than non-resilient participants to report reduced levels of anxiety, stress, fatigue, and insomnia
(Huffman et al., 2020).
Four studies reported a strong link between personal resilience and depression (LucenoMoreno et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2020; Khalaf et al., 2020; Yoruk & Guler, 2020), suggesting that
interventions to enhance resilience among HCWs may help prevent or reduce the occurrence of
depression in this population during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to depression and
anxiety, a few more studies confirmed the protective role of psychological resilience against
psychological stress (Tam et al., 2020; Luceno-Moreno et al., 2020; Khalaf et al., 2020),
emotional exhaustion (Di Monte et al., 2020), and PTSD symptoms (Maiorano et al., 2020;
Lucero-Moreno et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). In one study, resilience partially mediated the
association between institutional support and coronavirus-related distress (Tam et al., 2020).
Social Support in Relation to Mental Health
Seven studies explored the causal relationship between social support and mental health
outcomes in HCWs during the pandemic (Blanco-Donoso et al., 2020; Chew et al., 2020; Dong
et al., 2020; Giusti et al., 2020; Labrague & De los Santos, 2020; Nie et al., 2020; Xiao et al.,
2020). Mental health outcomes examined in relation to social support included traumatic stress,
emotional distress, psychological distress, burnout, anxiety, and stress. Adequate managerial and
supervisorial support and support extended by colleagues, peers, friends, and family were
associated with reduced levels of traumatic stress (Blanco-Donoso et al., 2020; Chew et al.,
2020) and emotional distress (Dong et al., 2020).

In an online cross-sectional study involving nurses in China, higher perceptions of social
support explained significant variance in the psychological distress measure (Nie et al., 2020),
while in Italy, HCWs who perceived greater support from family and friends reported a
significant reduction in burnout symptoms (Giusti et al., 2020). A study involving Filipino
nurses showed a similar pattern: Frontline nurses who perceived higher social support were less
likely to demonstrate dysfunctional anxiety related to the coronavirus (Labrague & De los
Santos, 2020). In addition, adequate social support for HCWs was associated with a significant
reduction in stress and an improvement in self-efficacy during the pandemic (Xiao et al., 2020).
Discussion
This systematic review is the first to examine psychological resilience, social support,
and coping behaviours among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic and their effects on
mental and psychological health. Thirty-one quantitative studies were included in this review. It
is worth noting that most of the studies included in this review were conducted in China (n = 14),
where the coronavirus originated, while very few studies involving HCWs from other countries
were identified. With COVID-19 affecting all healthcare systems around the world, it is vital that
more research be conducted to understand how HCWs from other parts of the world are able to
cope with and adapt to the stress and demands of the pandemic. While cross-sectional research
designs using online surveys may be the most practical way to collect data during the pandemic
(given restrictions and social distancing protocols), future longitudinal studies will be vital to
determining how mental health in HCWs changes over time. Coping and psychological
resilience are both dynamic constructs which change, develop, and deteriorate with time (Hart,
Brannan, & De Chesnay, 2014; Lazarus & Folkman 1987).

Despite the gap identified in the articles reviewed, this review found moderate to high
levels of resilience among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological resilience –
that is, an individual’s ability to rebound from stressful situations like an emergency, disaster, or
infectious disease outbreak – is critically important because it helps individuals effectively
endure the adverse mental health consequences of stress-provoking events (Hart, Brannan, & De
Chesnay, 2014). The protective role of psychological resilience in HCWs against various
disaster/emergency-associated adverse mental health consequences has been well established in
previous studies (Labrague et al., 2018; Duncan, 2020).
It was evident in this review that HCWs utilized both positive (e.g., use of social support
and praying) and negative (e.g., use of distraction activities) coping strategies to effectively
manage the stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Seeking social support as a means
of coping with adversity has been categorized as a problem-focused coping strategy (Lazarus &
Folkman, 1987) and has been found to effectively reduce stress. Mounting evidence suggests that
social support is an effective way to promote long-term reductions in the stress and anxiety
caused by stressful events (Folkman & Lazarus, 1988). The use of religious coping mechanisms
– such as reading the Bible for Christians or reciting the Quran for Muslims – has been identified
as an effective strategy to reduce stress, anxiety, and their adverse effects. As a coping strategy,
prayer provides context, social connection, and inner strength, making an individual capable of
managing stress more effectively. A substantial amount of studies have established a positive
link between religious coping mechanisms and reduced anxiety, aggression, psychological
distress, and depressive symptoms as well as enhanced optimism, hope, quality of life, and
psychological health (Cain, 2019; Ramlee et al., 2016; Connor 2016; Achour et al., 2019). The
use of distraction activities such as engaging in sports, exercise, music, yoga, and meditation (all

of which are categorized as emotion-focused coping strategies) only provides short-term stressrelief because doesn’t address the main source of stress but rather reduces stress-associated
symptoms and behavioural manifestations (Folkman & Lazarus, 1988).
In this review, psychological resilience, coping behaviours, and social support were
demonstrated to protect HCWs against the adverse mental health consequences of the COVID-19
pandemic. This result provided additional support for the value of positive coping mechanisms
and the need for adequate resilience and social support to protect HCWs against the adverse
impacts of threatening and demanding situations like the COVID-19 pandemic.
Support from peers, colleagues, managers, families, and friends is regarded as a vital
resource for HCWs to adequately cope with various stressors in the workplace. During the
pandemic, when stress and anxiety is elevated, the provision of adequate social support may help
HCWs maintain healthy emotional states. Mounting evidence has strongly linked adequate
support from managers, co-workers, family, and friends with positive mental health outcomes for
both healthcare and non-healthcare professionals during stressful and traumatic events such as
calamities, accidents, disasters, and disease outbreaks (Baduge et al., 2018; Labrague et al.,
2018). This result confirms results from earlier studies in which lower levels of depression,
anxiety, and stress were reported in healthcare workers who had greater perceived social support,
suggesting that measures to foster increased social support may reduce negative psychological
symptoms in HCWs (Hou et al., 2020).
Psychological resilience, like social support, has long been considered a protective factor
against the adverse psychological effects of stressful or traumatic situations (Hart, Brannan, &
De Chesnay, 2014). In the context of pandemic, a wide range of evidence has demonstrated that
resilient HCWs are more likely to rebound effectively and endure the pandemic-associated

psychological burden than non-resilient HCWs (Foster et al., 2020). The role of psychological
resilience in protecting individuals against the mental health consequences of an emergency or
disaster situation has also been confirmed in previous studies (Labrague et al., 2018; Duncan,
2020). Our finding also add support to earlier research conducted prior to the pandemic in which
higher resilience in HCWs was strongly linked to reduced burnout, compassion fatigue, anxiety,
depression, and psychological distress (Mealer, Jones, & Meek, 2017).
Coping strategies – that is, mechanisms that an individual can employ to manage the
impacts of potential threats– has been long considered an important personal resource to
effectively reduce the impact of stress and its accompanying adverse consequences (Lazarus &
Folkman 1987). During the pandemic, in which stress levels among HCWs are expected to rise,
employing positive coping behaviours could relieve stress and safeguard mental health and wellbeing. Reports prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic have demonstrated the benefit of
positive coping skills to combat stress and prevent psychological issues (e.g., loneliness, anxiety,
depression and stress) (Ye et al., 2020; Tull et al., 2020). Furthermore, positive coping strategies
were associated with increased self confidence, reduced sleep disturbances, and decreased
psychological and traumatic stress in nurses who were on the frontlines during the coronavirus
pandemic (Xiao et al., Yu et al., 2020).
Implications for Practice
This review suggests that building resilience and increasing coping skills and social
support among HCWs may protect them against the adverse mental and psychological health
consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. As such, hospital administrators should foster
psychological resilience and reinforce positive coping strategies among HCWs by implementing
theory-tested interventions or programs. Due to restrictions including social distancing and

lockdown measures, these interventions could be delivered in innovative ways, such as webinars,
online workshops, and on-demand videos. Interprofessional, web-based nightly debriefing
programs (Azizoddin et al., 2020) and online cognitive behavioural therapy (Weiner et al., 2020)
have been demonstrated to enhance resilience and morale in HCWs and improve clinical
processes for quality patient care. Furthermore, increasing social support may provide a sense of
greater emotional security among HCWs, thereby reducing their apprehensions and anxiety so
they can function effectively during the pandemic. If HCWs are encouraged to express their
feelings and concerns and openly discuss their experiences and challenges in the care and
management of COVID-19 patients, their morale will improve and their mental health will be
sustained.
As positive coping strategies were seen to improve mental health in HCWs, providing
training in the development of self-efficacy and effective coping skills may help HCWs better
manage the increased work pressures that have accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospital
administrators should consider increasing HCWs’ access to mental health professionals during
the pandemic in to support their mental health needs. Furthermore, providing psychosocial
support and clear information about COVID-19 may further reduce anxiety and other adverse
pandemic-associated emotional consequences among HCWs.
Conclusions
The review findings suggest that HCWs manage their stress during the height of the
COVID-19 pandemic by utilizing both problem focused (e.g., use of social support and
religious practice) and emotion focused (e.g., use of diversionary activities) coping strategies.
Furthermore, this review found substantial evidence on the value and effectiveness of coping
mechanisms, psychological resilience, and social support in preserving the mental health and

psychological well-being of HCWs during disease outbreaks such as the coronavirus pandemic.
Considering the global extent of the pandemic, this review is of interest to international readers –
particularly hospital administrators. Organizational measures to sustain the healthcare workforce
in the midst of the pandemic must include interventions to improve coping skills, psychological
resilience, and social support.

stress measure was explained by lack of staff and
supervisor support.
Lower levels of support from co-workers amplify
the negative effect of social pressure from work on
traumatic stress.
Social pressure from work, high doses of exposure
to suffering, lack of personnel and personal
protective equipment, and minimal supervisor
support were significant in explaining traumatic
stress.
Mean scale score in the BRS was 18.43 out of 30.
Higher levels of quality of sleep, positive affective
state, age and life satisfaction raised the level of
psychological resilience.
Higher negative affective state and being a doctor
meant lower psychological resilience level.
Lower positive attitude, higher social support,
working with COVID-19 patients and higher
avoidance strategies predicted higher levels of
distress.
Coping strategies utilized by HCWs used strict
protective measures, knowledge of virus
prevention and transmission, social isolation
measures, and positive self-attitude.
The following provided psychological benefit in
HCWs: the availability of strict infection control
guidelines, specialized equipment, recognition of
their efforts by hospital management and the
government.
Stress was positively predicted by the use of
avoidance as a coping strategy.
Stress was negatively predicted by the use of
positive thinking.

support as coping strategies were negative and
positive predictors of traumatic stress.
HCWs utilized the following adaptation
approaches: communication with family, learning
about the disease, communication with colleagues
and teamwork.
Least influential coping were as follows: lack of
support and understanding from family and
relatives; lack of protective supplies; lack of social
support and recognition for medical workers and
unfamiliar with special work environments,
working routine and use of equipment.
Medical staff without emotional problems were
significantly more likely to cope by “adhering to
infection control procedures,” “just accepting the
risks,” “keeping a positive mind-set,” “keeping a
healthy lifestyle,” “avoiding thinking about the
risks,” “avoiding traveling,” and less “taking
vitamins, herbs, or other complementary
substances”.
Family relationships had a direct negative effect
on emotional-distress levels.
Emotional exhaustion was positively correlated
with emotion-oriented coping and negatively with
task-oriented coping.
Depersonalization correlated positively with
emotion-oriented coping and avoidance-oriented
coping and negatively with task-oriented coping.
Personal Accomplishment scale was correlated
negatively with emotion-oriented coping and
positively with task-oriented coping.
Resilience had a significant positive correlation
with the personal accomplishment subscale and a
negative correlation with emotional exhaustion
and Depersonalization subscales.

health measures than public health nurses.
Personal resilience predicted dysfunctional anxiety
related to coronavirus.
HCWs had a high level of resilience (67.04).
Active coping (26.61) score was higher than the
score of passive coping (10.32).
Nurses obtained a lower resilience score compared
to other professions.
Moreover, active coping, depression, anxiety and
mental health training were significant predictors
of resilience.
Resilience is associated in a negative and
significant way with post-traumatic stress, anxiety,
depression.
The mean scale score of the BRS was 3.02 out of a
possible score of 6.
Nurses with PTSD had a significantly lower
resilience than those without PTSD.
An increase of CDRISC score was associated
with a decrease in PTSD.
An increase of CDRISC score was associated
with decreased PTSD symptoms.
Psychological resilience was negatively associated
with anxiety in HCWs.
The following coping approaches were identified
by HCWs: prayers, sports, and exercise as the
most common (80.5%); having clear guidelines for
infection prevention (64.7%); availability of PPE
(57.3%); and the support of colleagues.

Coping was negatively related to depression and
anxiety.
The mean score of positive coping style and
negative coping style among all frontline nurses
was 1.68 and 0.97respectively.
Positive coping style and negative coping style
were the risk factors of COVID19 related stress
symptoms.
Seven factors associated with the presence of
psychological distress: working in ED, concern for
family, being treated differently , the impact of the
event, negative coping style, perceived social
support, precautionary measures effective.
Most frequently adopted coping strategy was
religious coping followed by acceptance and
coping planning.
Females were observed to have significantly
higher scores for behavioural disengagement,
venting and religious/spiritual coping than male
respondents.
Respondents belonging to 26-30 years’ age group
reported significantly less substance use than those
from 31-35 years of age.
Nurses had significantly higher coping style scores
on denial, substance use and behavioural
disengagement than doctors.
Physical activity/exercise was the most commonly
endorsed behaviour (59%), followed by engaging
with faith-based religion and/or spirituality (23%),
yoga (25%), and/or meditation (23%), engaging
with talk therapy (26%) and virtual provider
support groups (16%).
HCWs who screened positive for acute stress
reported engaging in more coping behaviours than
those who screened negative.

between institutional support and psychological
distress.
HCWs utilized focused problem solving and
support as coping strategies.
Blocking unpleasant emotions and thoughts
strategy had a significant impact on the stress
levels and the components of secondary trauma,
unlike the problem-focused and social support
strategies.
Social support correlated significantly with anxiety
and sleep.
Social support negatively affected anxiety and
stress levels, and positively affected their selfefficacy.
High psychological resilience was found to be
protective against depression risk.
The total score of positive coping was negatively
correlated with the total score of anxiety and
depression.
