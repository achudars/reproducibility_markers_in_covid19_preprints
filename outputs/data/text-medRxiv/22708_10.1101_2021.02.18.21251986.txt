ABSTRACT

30

Introduction: The purpose of this study was to describe the reported incidence of COVID-19 in

31

Wisconsin high school athletes in September 2020, and to investigate the relationship of

32

COVID-19 incidence with sport and face mask use.

33

Methods: Surveys were sent to athletic directors of all Wisconsin high schools regarding sports

34

during September 2020. The association between reported case rates in athletes in each county

35

and the county general population were evaluated with a weighted linear model. Multivariable

36

negative binomial regression models evaluated the associations between COVID-19 incidence

37

and sport type and face mask use by players, adjusting for the county COVID-19 incidence for

38

each school.

39

Results: 207 schools that had reinitiated sport reported 270 COVID-19 cases among 30,074

40

players, for case and incidence rates of 809 cases per 100,000 players and 32.6 cases per 100,000

41

player-days, respectively. The case rates for athletes in each county were positively correlated

42

with the case rates for the county’s general population (β=1.14±0.20, r=0.60, p<0.001). One

43

hundred fifteen (55%) of cases were attributed to household contact, 85 (41%) to contact outside

44

sport or school, 5 (2.4%) to school contact, and 1 (0.5%) to sport contact. No difference was

45

identified between team and individual sports (incidence rate ratio (IRR)=1.03 [95% CI=0.49-

46

2.2], p=0.93) or between non-contact and contact sports (IRR=0.53 [0.23-1.3], p=0.14), although

47

the difference between outdoor and indoor sports approached statistical significance (IRR=0.52

48

[0.26-1.1], p=0.07). 84% of schools required face masks while playing. For those sports with

49

>50 participating schools, there were no significant associations between COVID-19 incidence

50

and face mask use in cross country (IRR=0.71 [0.2-2.2], p=0.52), football (IRR=1.6 [0.6-5.1],

52

p=0.64).

53

Conclusions: Incidence of reported COVID-19 among athletes was related to background

54

county incidence and most cases were attributed to household and community contact. Although

55

not statistically significant, reported COVID-19 incidence may be lower in outdoor sports. Face

56

mask use did not have a significant benefit, which may be due to relatively low rates of COVID-

57

19 and the small number of schools that did not report using face masks.

INTRODUCTION
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented changes to the daily lives of people

62

of all ages globally. Sports throughout the country have been shut down or altered in varying

63

ways depending on the local county or state ordinances. In Wisconsin, youth sports were

64

effectively canceled by the Safer At Home order in March 2020.1 With the order overturned by

65

the Wisconsin Supreme Court in May 2020, counties throughout the state instituted their own

66

restrictions.2,3 Youth sports were restarted in certain counties around the state during the summer

67

of 2020, while others did not reinitiate.4

68

There has been a dearth of information regarding the risk of COVID-19 infection and

69

sport participation. However, it is widely accepted that transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus

70

that causes COVID-19 is related to direct exposure to respiratory droplets and airborne

71

transmission.5,6 Longer periods of time in close proximity to infected individuals may increase

72

transmission risk, and high intensity exercise may potentiate the spread of respiratory droplets,

73

according to the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).5 National,

74

state, and local regulations have all suggested an associated higher transmission risk with contact

75

sports, indoor sports and team sport participation.7 Little direct evidence from sports exists to

76

support this. Media reports of COVID-19 transmission within youth sports are a cause for

77

concern, although it is often unclear whether the risk is due to sport participation or gatherings

78

peripheral to or separate from the sports arena.8,9 A recent study in a soccer club from

79

Washington state found physically distanced youth soccer training to be safe and did not

80

contribute to COVID-19 spread among child and adolescent participants.10 Another preprint

81

publication regarding club soccer players nationwide found no difference in reported COVID-19

82

incidence among athletes participating in contact versus non-contact soccer.11 Finally, a third

83

preprint study of data collected from high school athletic directors nationwide found that,

84

although COVID-19 incidence was higher among indoor sports, very few cases of COVID-19

85

were reportedly attributable to sport contact and the overwhelming majority were attributed to

86

household and community contacts.12

87

Several recommendations to minimize COVID-19 risk in youth sports have been

88

published since the onset of the pandemic by various academic organizations, public health

89

agencies, and national sport governing bodies.7,13,14,15,16 However, because little data is directly

90

available for sport contexts, these recommendations are largely based on inpatient COVID-19

91

data, case studies, and expert opinion. Risk mitigation recommendations vary widely and the

92

debate around facemask use while playing sports continues.17 The CDC and American Academy

93

of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend against the use of facemasks during play if they inhibit

94

breathing, become wet, or become a choking hazard, but strongly recommend the use of

95

facemasks any time while not in the act of playing a sport.14,18 Therefore, the purpose of this

96

study is to describe the incidence of reported COVID-19 in high school sports in Wisconsin and

97

to understand the associations between COVID-19 incidence and sport type as well as face mask

98

use among athletes.

Study Design

102

All procedures performed in this study were deemed exempt from by the Institutional

103

Review Board of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In collaboration with the Wisconsin

104

Interscholastic Athletics Association (WIAA), surveys were distributed to all high school athletic

105

directors on October 1, 2020. In addition to school name and location, athletic directors were

106

asked whether they had restarted participation in sports since the initial COVID-19 restrictions in

107

the spring of 2020. Those schools that reported reinitiating sports were asked to provide the

108

specific sports and the date of restarting, number of athletes, number of practices and games, and

109

number of COVID-19 cases among athletes within each sport, as well as the reported sources of

110

infections (if known) during the month of September 2020. Schools were asked about their type

111

of instruction during September (virtual or in-person) and whether they required the use of face

112

masks for players while playing. Schools were included if they had any sport that had restarted

113

participation during September 2020.

114

Statistical Analysis

115

Data were initially evaluated using descriptive statistics, including estimates of central

116

tendency (mean, median) and variability (standard deviation, interquartile range, range) for

117

continuous variables, and counts and percentages for categorical variables. Reported COVID-19

118

case rates were expressed as the number of reported cases per 100,000 players (cases / total

119

number of players * 100,000) overall and for each sport. Duration of participation for each sport

120

at each school was determined as the difference in days between the date of restarting and

121

October 1, 2020, and player-days was determined as the product of the number of participating

122

players and duration. Reported COVID-19 incidence rates were expressed as the number of

123

reported cases per 100,000 player-days (cases / total number of player-days * 100,000) overall

124

and for each sport, with confidence intervals calculated using an exact method.

125

In addition, the number of cases, total population, case rate and incidence rate during

126

September were determined for each county in which a respondent high school was located from

127

publicly available online information from the local health authority. In order to determine

128

whether background county COVID-19 case rates were associated with reported COVID-19 case

129

rates among high school athletes, the total number of athletes and reported COVID-19 cases

130

were aggregated by county. For those counties with >100 athletes, the relationship between

131

COVID-19 case rates among high school athletes and the general population were evaluated with

132

a linear model weighted for the total population of each county.

133

For those sports with data from 50 or more schools, the relative risk of each sport was

134

evaluated using a mixed effects negative binomial regression model to predict the number of

135

COVID-19 cases for each team with local incidence, instructional delivery type, and sport as

136

fixed effects, the log of player-days as an offset, and school as a random effect, yielding an

137

incidence rate ratio (IRR) with “Cheer / Dance” as the reference (since this represented the

138

median unadjusted incidence rate). To evaluate the relationship between reported COVID-19

139

incidence and sport characteristics, a multivariable negative binomial regression model was

140

developed to predict the number of cases, with local incidence, sport location (indoor, outdoor),

141

sport contact (contact, non-contact), sport type (team, individual), and school instructional

142

delivery type as covariates, and the log of player-days as an offset.

143

To evaluate the association between overall COVID-19 incidence and reported face mask

144

use, incidence rates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated within each sport with greater

145

than 50 reporting schools for those reporting face mask use or not. Separate multivariable

146

negative binomial regression models were then developed to predict the number of cases, with

147

local incidence, instructional delivery type, and face mask use (yes/no) as covariates, and the log

148

of player-days as an offset. Coefficients from the models were exponentiated to represent IRRs

149

for binary variables and Wald confidence intervals were generated. Significance level was

150

determined a priori at the 0.05 level and all tests were 2-tailed. All statistical analyses were

151

performed in R.

RESULTS
Two hundred forty-four schools submitted complete survey responses, of which 207 had

154

155

restarted a fall sport. These schools represented 30,074 student-athletes that had participated in

156

16,898 practices and 4,378 games. One hundred eighty-seven schools (90.3%) reported utilizing

157

in-person instruction during September 2020. Among the schools that had restarted participation,

158

270 cases of COVID-19 were reported, yielding a case rate of 892 cases per 100,000 athletes and

159

an incidence rate of 32.6 (95% CI = 28.9-36.8) cases per 100,000 player-days. From September 6

160

to October 4, 2020, 2390 cases of COVID-19 were reported among 14-17 year-olds in

161

Wisconsin, for a case rate of 1067 cases per 100,000 people and an incidence of 38.1 cases per

162

100,000 person-days.19 Of the cases with a reported known source, 115 (55%) were attributed to

163

household contact followed by community contact outside sport or school (85, 41%), school

164

contact (5, 2.4%), sport contact (1, 0.5%) and other (3, 1.4%). For those sports with greater than

165

50 participating schools, the incidence rate ranged from 13.3 (Tennis – Girls) to 45.2 cases per

166

100,000 player-days (Football), as shown in Figure 1 (full data available in Supplemental Table

167

1).

168

When aggregated by county, the case rates for athletes in each county were significantly

169

and positively correlated with the case rates for their respective county’s general population

170

(β=1.14±0.20, r=0.60, p<0.001; see Figure 2). The IRRs for specific sports, adjusted for state

171

COVID-19 incidence, instruction delivery type and school repeated measures are shown in

172

Figure 3. The IRRs for school instructional delivery and sport characteristics are shown in Table

173

1. One hundred seventy-three schools (84%) reported face mask use by players while playing

174

sports. Unadjusted incidence for teams with and without reported face mask use within each

175

sport with greater than 50 respondent schools are shown in Figure 4. After adjusting for local

176

county COVID-19 incidence and school instructional delivery, face mask use was not associated

177

with a decreased COVID-19 incidence in football, girls’ volleyball, boys’ soccer or cross country

178

(Table 2).

179

180

181

DISCUSSION
In this statewide survey study of high school athletes, we did not identify a statistically

182

significant association between COVID-19 incidence and sport type after adjusting for local

183

virus incidence and school instructional delivery. Girls’ tennis, girls’ golf and cross country

184

reported the lowest adjusted incidence rates of COVID-19, while football reported the highest.

185

Nonetheless, the confidence intervals around these estimates were wide, perhaps due to the

186

relatively low incidence of COVID-19 in Wisconsin during this period. There were no

187

independent, statistically significant differences in reported COVID-19 incidence between indoor

188

versus outdoor sports, contact versus non-contact sports, or individual versus team sports.

189

However, indoor and contact sport classification approached significance, suggesting that this

190

relationship may become clearer with a larger sample during a period of higher COVID-19

191

incidence. In fact, a recent preprint publication among high school athletes nationwide

192

demonstrated this relationship over a longer time period when background COVID-19 rates were

193

higher throughout the country.12

194

We found that case rates of reported COVID-19 in high school athletes were significantly

195

related to the case rates of their respective county’s general population, and very similar to the

196

overall COVID-19 incidence rate among 14-17 year olds in Wisconsin during roughly the same

197

time frame. In addition, 96% of the cases among athletes had a reported source of infection from

10

198

household and community contacts, and only 1 (0.5%) from a known sport contact. This may

199

suggest that the background, local COVID-19 incidence may have a greater effect on overall

200

COVID-19 incidence among high school athletes than participation in a specific sport or type of

201

sport.

202

Reported face mask use among the sports with the largest number of respondent schools

203

(football, girls’ volleyball, boys’ soccer, and cross country) did not have a significant

204

relationship with COVID-19 incidence. While this is similar to the findings among outdoor

205

sports in a recent nationwide sample of high school athletes, it is in contrast to the finding from

206

that study that facemask use was associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence among indoor

207

sports.12 The overwhelming majority of the respondent schools in the present study (84%)

208

reported facemask use while on the field or court. Together with the relatively low background

209

COVID-19 incidence rates during September, this may have limited our ability to identify a true

210

relationship between mask use and reported COVID-19 incidence.

211

Similarly, we did not find a relationship between COVID-19 incidence and type of

212

instructional delivery (in-person, virtual). Of the cases with a reported known source, only 2.5%

213

were attributed to a school contact. This is consistent with prior reports that schools have not

214

been significant contributors to the spread of COVID-19.20 However, 90% of our respondent

215

schools reported in-person instruction, making it difficult to fully evaluate the role of in-person

216

school instruction in COVID-19 incidence among high school athletes. Nonetheless, we included

217

school instruction type within our adjusted models in order to account for this as a potential

218

confounder. Importantly, it should be recognized that this study cannot account for transmission

219

or incidence of COVID-19 among attendees at high school sporting events beyond the

220

participants. This represents an important potential contributor to community COVID-19 risk,

221

and risk mitigation procedures should continue to be prioritized to protect both athletes and

222

attendees.

223

224

225

Limitations
This study has several limitations. We are unable to verify the information provided by

226

athletic directors through a separate independent source. Local, county-level daily COVID-19

227

case data was often not available for adolescents or children, so our adjusted models could only

228

account for the population-level background incidence from each county. Nonetheless, we found

229

that reported case rates from our sample and the case rates from the county general populations

230

were highly related. It is difficult to fully interpret comparisons of COVID-19 cases reported by

231

athletic directors and those collected by public health agencies, but we have included public

232

health data to add context for our findings and to adjust our incidence models. As mentioned

233

above, the incidence of COVID-19 was relatively low during September 2020 in Wisconsin, and

234

this may have limited our ability to detect statistically significant associations in some cases.

235

Reported sources of infection were provided by the schools themselves and it is unknown

236

whether these represent the results of formal contact tracing by local health authorities. Finally,

237

this data represents information regarding athletes from a single state and may not be

238

generalizable to other populations.

239

240

241

Conclusions
After adjusting for local county COVID-19 incidence, no statistically significant

242

differences in reported COVID-19 incidence were identified between sports or sport types

243

among Wisconsin high school athletes during September 2020. Reported COVID-19 case rates

244

among athletes were highly correlated with case rates for the general population for their

245

respective counties, and incidence rates among athletes were very similar to those of 14-17 year

246

olds in Wisconsin in general. Most cases among athletes were attributed to household and

247

community contact with very few attributed to school or sport contacts. Further research is

248

warranted to better define the risk factors for COVID-19 transmission during adolescent sport

249

participation and the relative benefits of different risk mitigation strategies.
