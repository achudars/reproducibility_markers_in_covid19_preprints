Calibrating an Epidemic Compartment Model to Seroprevalence Survey Data

Abstract
To date, the Covid-19 epidemic has produced tremendous cost and harm. However, to
date, many epidemic models are not calibrated to seroprevalence survey(s). This paper
calibrates a relatively simple, SIR plus confirmed cases ("SIRX") model against
seroprevalence survey data released by the State of New York. The intention of this
paper is to demonstrate a potentially new technique of calibration for epidemic models
used by scientists, public health officials and governments. The technique can then be
incorporated in other more complex models. Open source code is included to assist
model developers.
Keywords: Seroprevalence, model, calibration, SIR, compartment, epidemiology

Introduction
The intention of this paper is to provide a calibration technique, applied to a relatively simple SIR plus
cases model ("SIRX") using seroprevalence data. This paper is an attempt to communicate to
epidemiologists and other modelers within a timeframe that is useful to managing the current epidemic.
Numerous simplifications are made to concentrate this communication. Hence additional detail and
accuracy are explicitly beyond the scope of this paper.
All code and data are available at [1]. This calibration technique was independently developed by the
author. An extensive search for other similar techniques which may have existed in the literature was
beyond the time scope of this paper. Such techniques will be credited in subsequent revisions of this paper
as they come to the attention of the author.
Generalizing an Antibody Test
As will be explained in detail below, in this paper the New York State "Wadsworth" Antibody
Seroprevalence Survey will be used to calibrate a SIRX model.
In the attached appendix, a simplified antibody test is used to demonstrate via linear algebraic
manipulations how both sensitivity and specificity would interact with different (perfectly) known
seroprevalence time series, assuming that the test is sampled at a fixed time relative to the time series
independent variable t. Antibody test sensitivity and specificity curves were rounded from the
Wadsworth test in the Appendix so that the arithmetic can be checked by inspection. In the Appendix,
and summarized in Figures 1, 2, and 3 below, three different assumed time series are put forward as
examples: Figure 1: a cumulative infection growth rate doubling every 3 days (newly infected doubling
every 3.64 days), representing an epidemic’s typical exponential growth before the introduction of social
distancing measures; Figure 2: a flat (constant) infection rate per day; and Figure 3: an exponential
decrease in the number of new infections at the same 3.64 halving rate as Figure 1, created by "playing
backwards time" from the example Figure 1.

The three different types of new infected time series are shown above.
In each time series chart, the X's connected with the black line represent the number of new infected each
day t. The bars represent the cumulative infected. Of note is that once infected, in the time series
members of the subpopulation are always counted as positive whether they remain infectious, or have
recovered or died and are no longer infectious. The cumulative infected total represents the true total
percentage of the tested population who are positive for the condition of ever having been infected.
Given a known true infected time series, using algebra and arithmetic the test results have been computed
and presented in Table 1 as the ratio of Test Positive to True Positive. (Please see the Appendix for the
calculations.) In the time series charts, these ratios are expressed as the red horizontal line, and compared

to a "perfect" test in the blue horizontal lines. The charts y axis are logarithmic -- and understate the true
significance of the undercount. The results clearly show that the ratio of test positive (test infected) to
total infected is significantly reduced, in the exponential growth and the flat examples, compared to both
(a) the actual number of infected using an accurate calculation; and (b) the naively computed number of
infected using a single final sensitivity. This is because the Wadsworth Test, like most antibody tests,
increases in sensitivity as the immune system responds to the infection over time. Therefore, if an
analysis uses only an antibody test's peak sensitivity (measured three or more weeks after infection), it
would significantly underestimate the true infected rate. Further, there is a risk, particularly in test results
that do not have their adjustments published, that public health officials, government executives, or the
general public will assume naively that seroprevalence test results presented in summary form at press
conferences represent an unbiased estimated of the population's true cumulative infection percentage,
when instead it is likely significantly higher. Therefore it is clear that care must be taken by the modeler
in using test results, particularly those without published detail as to their calculation method or
sensitivity and specificity.
The SIRX Model
This paper will use a modified SIR model to demonstrate calibration. The model utilized for this example
is a simplification of the SIR-X model of Maier and Brockmann [2], itself a generalization of the SIR
model. In addition to the three basic SIR compartments of S (susceptible), I (infected), and R (recovered
or deceased), there is an additional compartment X (confirmed and reported cases), which allows the
model to connect to the confirmed cases reported by public health authorities.3
The model is defined by the following differential equations describing the flow between the
compartments:
𝑑𝑆/𝑑𝑡 = −𝛽𝐼 𝑆/𝑁

Eq. 1

𝑑𝐼/𝑑𝑡 = 𝛽𝐼 𝑆/𝑁 − 𝛾𝐼 − 𝑘-. 𝐼

Eq. 2

𝑑𝑋/𝑑𝑡 = 𝑘-. 𝐼

Eq. 3

𝑑𝑅/𝑑𝑡 = 𝛾𝐼

Eq. 4

𝑁 = 𝑆 + 𝐼 + 𝑅 + 𝑋

Eq. 5

With the constraint:
With definitions:
S, I, R º Susceptible, Infected, or Recovered4 Population
X º Confirmed Cases Population5 (assumed quarantined and thus unable to infect Susceptible
Population)
N º Total Population
β º Transition rate from the Susceptible to the Infected compartment
γ º Transition rate from the Infected to the Recovered compartment
𝑘-. º Transition rate from the Infected to Confirmed Cases compartment
3

Note that Maier and Brockmann provide for a direct transition between the S and the R compartment to explain
subexponential growth. This S to R transition is not used in this paper's model.
4
Note that the Recovered Population includes those who have died. This population had been infected but is no
longer infectious.
5
Similarly the (Confirmed) Case Population includes those who had been confirmed as positive but subsequently
died or have recovered, so that they are no longer infectious to the Susceptible population.

t º Time, in units of days for convenience
This model is a SIR model [3] with an extra compartment for the Confirmed cases and where the
Confirmed cases are isolated until no longer infectious.
Because this paper's purpose is to demonstrate calibration, for brevity the inherent weaknesses in the SIR
model are immaterial and therefore ignored. Regardless, the calibration technique can be applied to more
accurate and more complex models, including SEIR models, models that use gamma distributions for
compartment distributions vs time, models that use or incorporate directly mortality, models that network
individual infections, and so on. Examples include the Imperial College Model [4] and the IHME Model
[5]. However, all models would benefit from more accurate calibration with seroprevalence data of which
this simplified SIRX model is a mere example.
To simplify this example the γ transition factor has not been calibrated, but is simply assumed to be a
constant of 1/8 representing an 8 day mean infectious period. 1/γ is equivalent to the mean time (in this
case 8 days) in an exponential distribution for an infected individual to pass from the Infected
compartment to the Recovered compartment (which included mortalities which are assumed to be no
longer infectious). The 8 day mean time is both reasonable and sufficient to illustrate calibration to
seroprevalence.
Within the SIRX model, as pointed out by Maier and Brockmann, the probability 𝑄3456 of a case ending
up in the X Confirmed Cases compartment instead of the R compartment is:
𝑄3456 = 𝑘-. /(𝑘-. + 𝛾 )

Eq. 6

This is roughly equivalent but not the same as the ascertainment fraction, i.e. the ratio of confirmed cases
to total infected plus recovered -- differing because of the delay of the infected from entering the
Confirmed or Recovered compartments. Regardless, by adjusting 𝑄3456 (or equivalently 𝑘-. through the
linear relationship in Equation 6 above, the model may be calibrated to match seroprevalence as
determined by survey.
The Example Case Data
Daily Confirmed Case data was originally obtained from the New York City Department of Health by
manually typing in the data in the daily reports [6], but that has been subsequently discontinued and does
not make corrections for past reported data. NYC updated to a time series file [7] which has the advantage
that past data are added as delayed reports are processed. The date used in the new NYC time series is the
"date of diagnosis" which is presumably the same or slightly delayed from the date of a positive (PCR
type) test being received by the medical practitioner. These data are then corroborated against data from
the New York State Department of Health [8] by adding up the cases in the 5 counties comprising New
York City (Kings, Queens, New York, Bronx, and Staten Island). Of note is that the NYS data's date is
"the date the test result was processed by the NYS Clinical Laboratory Reporting System". All three case
data sets are contained in the online code and data files for convenience. Visual observation shows that
the NYS data are generally one day delayed from the NYC data; and that the NYC data have a larger
weekly periodicity "noise" likely due to a relative lack of PCR testing or processing on Saturday and
Sunday. The regression technique used in this paper largely averages out such noise, although a more
sophisticated technique, based on either day of the week or tests on a day, could correct for the periodic
weekly noise. The population for NYC was rounded to 8.623 mm from [9].

The Computational Model
The model was built in the R Programming Language[10]. The SIRX model is encapsulated in a function
sirX3() which when given initial conditions of 𝑁, 𝐼: ; :< , 𝑑𝐼/𝑑𝑡 (𝑎𝑡 𝑡 = 𝑡0), 𝑘-. , 𝛽, and 𝛾, will solve the
differential equations (1) through (4) computationally for any number of days going forward using the
Dormond-Prince Runge-Kutta 4th order method R method from the package deSolve as described in
Soetaert et al [11]. This computational solution was checked by using a discrete numerical integration
where each day is broken into 500 (arbitrarily small) timesteps (i.e. Euler's method) as inspired by
Anastassopoulou et al [12]).
The sirX3() function has an optional parameter which linearly changes the initial 𝛽< by a multiplicative
change factor 𝐹CD (i.e. 0.5) over the fit interval from t < to t F:
𝛽(𝑡) = (𝑡 − 𝑡< )/(𝑡F − 𝑡< ) 𝐹𝛽𝛥 𝛽0

Eq. 7

This is useful in fitting the data when a public health policy may have changed social distancing and selfisolation behavior as will be seen below.
Fitting Case Data to Model
A relatively simplistic and (usually) stable method of fitting data is the least squares method. While there
are essentially closed form solutions that produce an exact answer for linear models, non-linear models
like SIRX cannot be solved using a linear regression. The problem is compounded when when 𝑆/𝑁 is
significantly less than 1 or when a non-constant susceptible to infection transition rate (i.e. 𝛽) is assumed.
(A changing 𝛽 is equivalent to a changing effective reproduction number, 𝑅HII because 𝑅HII = 𝛽/𝛾 in
the SIR framework, and must be fit computationally by an algorithm).
Fortunately, Elzhov et al [13] has created within R an excellent Levenberg-Marquant least square fitting
within the package minpack.lm called thru the nlsLM() function. The author has been iteratively
improving the code algorithmically utilizing these functions for several weeks and has thus experienced
and debugged multiple edge cases. In the interest of brevity, the code has been distilled down to a
minimum example based around a calling function, runSIRX2, called from the command line.6 An
example of running the code is contained in the function genFiguresAndTables() which will generate the
figures and tables used in this paper.
In fitting the data, the algorithm fits the error of the model's estimate against the logarithm of the total
cases. This has some desirable computational properties: 1) same weighting of percentage error on large
case count data points vs small case counts, i.e. 10,000 vs 500; 2) reducing to the common log-linear least
square regression solution if S/N =1. The author has shown (but it is beyond the scope of this paper) that
a regression of
𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑋 − 𝑋< ) = 𝑟 𝑡 + 𝑐< + 𝜖

Eq. 8

An example of running the code is contained in the function genFiguresAndTables() which will generate the
figures and tables used in this paper.

is the general "closed form" symbolic solution when S/N = 1 thereby giving the more complex SIRX
non-linear least squares optimizer a computationally "nearby" starting set of parameters to bootstrap the
regression. Where:
r º the log linear regression's coefficient on t, equivalent to the exponential growth rate
𝑐< º the log linear regression's constant
𝜖 º the log linear regression's residual error term
𝑋< º the number of cases at t=0 in the regression.
If 𝑋< is approximately known, for example in the initial growth phase of an epidemic as 1, Equation 8's
log-linear regression will produce a reasonable result. However, if 𝑋< is unknown, for example when an
epidemic's new cases are declining exponentially, the regression cannot be formulated in a (log) linear
form. In that event, to solve for the parameters 𝑋< , 𝐴 and 𝑟, Equation 8 must be rearranged to a non-linear
regression.7
𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑋) = 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑋< + 𝐴 𝑒 4(: U :V) ) + 𝜖

Eq. 9

After this non-linear regression, with X0, A, and r estimated, the run on the SIRX model has good starting
parameters and will normally converge to a solution.
The essential functional flow of the algorithm is:
1) Fetch the data;
2) Use simpler linear models (with S/N = 1 leaving purely exponential results) to guess initial
parameters for the non-linear nlsLM model that will not result in a gradient singularity, thereby
causing the model to fail;
3) As desired by the modeler, either use explicit inputs for 𝑘-. (equivalent to setting 𝑄3456 ) and the beta
Change Factor to find the best fit for the current beta from the subset of the data.
4) If the modeler should so desire, the algorithm can find the best fit for 𝑘-. and/or the Beta Change
Factor 𝐹CX in addition to 𝛽 or 𝛽< (the latter if using the Beta Change Factor 𝐹CX ).
Of note is that the constants 𝛽 and 𝑘-. are not constant in the real world over relatively long time periods.
This is because social distancing behavior changes the interaction rate between the infected and the
susceptible, and hence changes 𝛽; and because changes in screening behavior, contact tracing, or
reticence to seek healthcare behavior also change with time. This changing of the 𝛽 and 𝑘-. "constants"
favors regression over shorter time periods. However, as was shown by the 3 examples based on a realworld seroprevalence test (like the Wadsworth test), a longer period is needed to take into account very
significant changes in the test sensitivity. For the purposes of this calibration demonstration, this paper is
essentially forced to use at least 30 days preceding the seroprevalence survey. A more accurate model
could use more frequent seroprevalence sampling, and perhaps fatality data, to allow a piecewise
approximation of the 𝛽 and 𝑘-. regression parameters. This is beyond the scope of this paper.
An example of a calibration model run is in the Calibrating the SIRX to the Seroprevalence Survey
section that will follow.

The reader may note that 𝑡< is not known. It is set by convenience as the start of the data's interval to be analyzed,
noting that the regression solved non-linear regression A, and r constants can compensate for any choice of 𝑡<
because 𝑒 U4 :V is also a constant.

The NYS Seroprevalence Data
The seroprevalence data for the example is taken from the Governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo's,
press conference prepared slides [14, 15, 16]. The final data used from this paper is taken from the slides
(contained in the YouTubes in the references) which differ due to rounding from the Governor's transcript
remarks. The data is summarized below:
Table 2 - New York Antibody Survey Results
Date
Total NYS Surveyed

NYC Percent of Total

22 April
2,933
21.2%

27 April
7,397
24.7%
43%

1 May
15,103
19.9%
Not Stated, Assumed 43%

Of note is that the 22 April data, released on 23 April is stated as being "collected over two days". It is
assumed it was collected on 20-21 April. The 1 May data, released first on 2 May, is assumed collected
29-30 April. As it is unlikely that the NYC percentage positive test fraction could have declined by 4.8%
(from 24.7% to 19.9%) in approximately doubling the sample size over 4 days, it is more likely that there
was some unpublished adjustment to the serological survey data8. Further, the 2 May press conference
indicated that the data was collected "over the past two weeks".
Assuming a constant rate of collection, this paper will use the midpoint, 25 April, for calibration.
However, a more accurate estimate could be obtained using the actual collections on each day for the
calibration with some type of least squares fit to the data as will be described below. The survey
administrator (i.e. a government public health authority), would have available any ex-post corrections
made in the unpublished data. This author recommends that government and private survey collectors
fully publish all data.

8

27 April data: 7,397 x 24.7% x 43%= 786 positive. 1 May data: 15,103 x 19.9% x 43% = 1,292 positive.
Therefore, during the 4 day period from 27 April to 1 May, there would only be 1,292 - 786 = 506 new positives out
of 43% x (15,103 - 7,397) = 3,314 new tests or 506/3,314=15.3% positives, a decline of 24.7-15.3=9.4% in six
days. This is statistically unlikely in such a sample size if the population and test were uniform, and therefore
indicates a likely undisclosed adjustment to the data. This paper will use the 19.9% midpoint number is throughout.

column. If the model used was a "SEIR" type model (compartments: Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious,
and Recovered), where onset was being used as a proxy for infectious, this could be adjusted directly.
Alternatively an additional compartment could be added if infectiousness begins before symptom onset
but after infection, i.e. a SEIOR model (compartments: Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Onset of
symptoms, and Recovered). Additionally, if the model has direct access to the testing results, additional
granularity would be available.
The NYS Wadsworth EUA provided sensitivity curve is clearly non-linear between 11 and 20 days after
onset. While this could be smoothed out with a curve fitting, if the model has direct access to the
underlying data, a more accurate sensitivity curve could be constructed. Such accuracy and confidence
interval information is beyond the time scope of this paper.
The specificity data (i.e. 100% less the false positive percentage) are given on page 7 of the EUA for a
variety of sample sera and are reasonably assumed by the EUA to not vary with time since infection with
SARS-Cov-2. In calibration, the total true positives for all 433 samples in the clinical specificity table
(Table 5 of the EUA [18]) is used to calculate an average specificity for all 433 samples: 100% - 5/433 =
98.85%. Taking sensitivity and specificity together, these are used to make a "test calibration table"
which is input into the R computational model:

Table 5 - Wadsworth Calibration Test Sensitivity and Specificity
Test Calibration Sample Bias
As an additional caveat, please note that the Wadsworth Test clinical sensitivity tables are calibrated
using 753 subjects from "several US clinical collection sites", and using108 samples from Westchester
County, collected at undisclosed times in March and April 2020. As the samples were taken from clinical
PCR tests at a time when, due to rationing, PCR tests were generally limited to symptomatic individuals
who sought out medical care presumably due to severity of illness, and where asymptomatic or mild cases
would have difficulty in obtaining a PCR test; it is likely there is a calibration selection bias which
increases the relative number of severe cases in the sample. Further, as the age distribution for those with
severe disease is clearly biased older as seen in [20] than the general NYC population (seen in [9]), the
Wadsworth Test calibration samples are likely biased older. If the model has direct access to the
calibration population data, this bias can be eliminated.
Using a SIRX run to Estimate a Seroprevalence Test Result
For a given SIRX model run, a table is generated of the true positives, that is the infected plus recovered
in the general population that is being sampled in the NYS seroprevalence survey. For a given model run

tested positive, each such day has a certain number of newly infected on a given date in that population
that can be calculated10 as:

𝐶Z35[ (𝑡) = 𝐼(𝑡) + 𝑅(𝑡)

Eq. 10

𝐶Z35[ (𝑡) = 𝑁 − 𝑆(𝑡) − 𝑋(𝑡)

Eq. 11

where the function at time notation 𝐼(𝑡) indicates the value is a time series taken from the SIRX model
and
𝐶Z\]^ (𝑡) ≡ the cumulative total infected at time t in the non "Confirmed-Case" population
Then, a careful application of Equation 33A from the Appendix11 yields the percentage that is tested
positive and presumably reported by the Governor during the press conference. This is done by assuming
that the entire non-Case Confirmed population is tested at the test date, so that

𝑁`5`. = 𝑁 − 𝑋:;aHb:

Eq. 12

is used as the denominator in Equation 33A. While 𝑋𝑡=𝑇𝑒𝑠𝑡 is typically a small fraction of the total
population 𝑁, it is somewhat significant. Therefore, Equation 33A becomes:
:klm

𝜃Z = [ 1/𝑁`5`. g (𝑝: + 𝑞 − 1)𝐶:Z ] + (1 − 𝑞)

Eq. 13

:;<

The 𝜃Z is thus the fraction that would test positive if the survey encompassed the entire non-Confirmed
Population and the test performed precisely as specified in Table 5. Of course, the actual test is a sample
and the test is statistically described to have confidence intervals, so that statistical methods could be
applied to derive a confidence interval on the test results. The fitting of the case data (using the least
squares technique on a limited sample set) is itself subject to statistical estimation errors. But again, this
paper is simply demonstrating the technique to derive a mean "point estimate" and the estimation of
statistical error is beyond its (already lengthy) scope.
Calibrating the SIRX to the Seroprevalence Survey
As a final step, the modeler flips a switch to get the runSIRX2() algorithm to calculate the seroprevalence;
asking the model to adjust inputs for 𝑘-. (i.e. 𝑄3456 ) and the Beta Change Factor 𝐹CX ; or alternatively
asking the non-linear least squares algorithm to find a best fit to a seroprevalence that matches the survey
data simultaneously with finding the best fit for the daily new cases X and the change in daily new cases
Δ𝑋. To do this in a single non-linear "regression" the weighting factor is increased for the
seroprevalence target least squares error so that it is large enough to act as a constraint -- forcing the least
squares algorithm to converge to a solution with seroprevalence very near (within 0.1%) of the survey
This estimate may be slightly inaccurate as some of the 𝑋(𝑡) may have a different time series distribution vs. the
𝐼(𝑡) + 𝑅(𝑡) distribution -- because 𝑅(𝑡) and 𝑋(𝑡) are delayed compared to 𝐼(𝑡). This in turn is due to the fact that
the SIRX population must flow thru I to get to R and X compartments. However, to the extent that the ratio of
𝑋(𝑡)/[𝐼(𝑡) + 𝑅(𝑡)] is small and the percentage variation between ∆X(t)/X(t) is essentially by definition similar to
∆𝑅(𝑡)/𝑅(t) (because ∆𝑋(𝑡) is proportion to 𝐼(𝑡), as is ∆𝑅(𝑡)), this effect is likely to be small. Calculation of this
value is beyond the time scope of this paper.

result target. This yields a minimum least squares fit to the case data while simultaneously fitting the
seroprevalence data, thereby calibrating the model. An example of this calibration is shown in Figure 4
below.

Figure 4 - Calibrated to 19.9% Seroprevalence Survey SIRX using NYC Case Data
The black lines are the actual data with the upper black line (the O's) being the reported cases in the data
set (in this case NYC's data from [7]), and the lower black line (the X's) is the daily change in cases. The
blue lines are the calibrated fit to the data. The red line is the 𝑆/𝑁, i.e. the percentage still susceptible in
the population reusing the 1 to 100 scale on the left Y axis.
The calibration needs additional inputs: 1) The mean "effective" date the seroprevalence data are
collected (April 25th, the black vertical line), 2) the range of data for which to do the calibration
(represented by the vertical blue lines from March 7th to May 16th) -- a section of time for which the data
appear to be clean except for the weekly periodic (7 day) variation in tests12; and 3) the range of data for
which 𝛽 (𝑡) is adjusted as per Equation 7 being also from March 7th and running until March 23rd (16
days = ∆𝑡wxy from the start of the calibration range). This 𝛽(𝑡) range brackets the Governor's "lockdown"
12
The daily data in this NYC test are "by date of diagnosis" which is presumably closer to the date the test is taken
than the original (older) NYC data series (total confirmed by NYC DOH as of a certain date), or the NYS data series
(total reported to the NYS system as of the date). New York State has total number of PCR tests by County which
could be used to adjust the reported NYC data as if testing was done at a constant rate, but this adjustment is beyond
the scope of this tutorial.

social distancing order (March 20th). By manually varying ∆𝑡wxy in integer units, starting at the
lockdown date, the minimum residual standard error may be found, so that the optimal ∆𝑡wxy is that date
that has the minimum residual error. This may be done algorithmically, but is beyond the time scope of
the code development associated with this paper.
Note that there may be timing differences of a few days between reporting of the PCR Swab Test data
represented by the NYC times series data (the black lines) and the seroprevalence test dates which
reported in the during the Governor's press conferences. Also note that the change in 𝛽(𝑡) is fit as if it is
linear in the ∆𝑡wxy time interval and that this is an approximation to the hidden underlying process.
Additional code could add a start date immediately before and after the lockdown date.
What can be seen is that 1) the SIRX model visually does a good job of fitting both the daily change in
cases (lower blue line) and the cumulative daily cases (the upper blue line); and 2) the percent still
susceptible is around 70% compared with the serological survey showing around 80%. The actual
numbers can be seen in Table 6 below.
The model text output in Table 6 shows that a perfect seroprevalence test would show 28% positive13 in
the total population on April 25th, and with 163,000 PCR reported infected (about 2%, presumed not in
the seroprevalence survey) there are only about 71% remaining susceptible in the population. This
continues to decrease slowly to around 67%.

These figures in this paragraph are arbitrarily rounded to 1%. Also note that the precise calculation of a perfect
seroprevalence test requires both the numerator and denominator be adjusted, i.e. (Σ𝐼 − 𝑋) / (N − X) where Σ𝐼 is
the total cumulative infected. 𝑆 = 𝑆[w: N and Σ𝐼 = 𝑁 − 𝑆. For NYC 𝑁 ≅ 8,623,000. In numbers carrying extra
precision to make the arithmetic clear (Σ𝐼 − 𝑋) / (N − X) ≅ 2599527/8468394 ≅ 28% for April 25th.

Discussion and Conclusion
Why is the model's estimate of true infected plus recovered 40% higher than in the reported data?
The difference is due to a calibration with the FDA's published sensitivity table from the NYS Wadsworth
Lab test against a modelled slowly growing total number of infected plus recovered in the general
population. While it is not known if this seroprevalence data were already calibrated (i.e. adjusted to
present the population true infected plus recovered percentage) when presented by the New York
Governor, it is important for modelers to ask the question. It is important to ask for full disclosure of the
method of calibrating the test. If the test was not calibrated, a large underestimation of the seroprevalence
would result, and hence getting to and achieving so called herd immunity would appear to be a more
difficult task that must be more slowly approached.
Further, this implies that the infection fatality ratio (the IFR) may be overestimated by a similar factor of
around 40% if the calibration is accurate. It is important for our public health leadership to have such
information to make accurate estimates of the effects of various strategies. As other models use IFR as an
input together with mortality data to estimate the current state and future evolution of the epidemic, it is
important to estimate more accurately these data, suitably adjusted for delayed sensitivity, so as to draw
more accurate conclusions from those models.
This paper does not purport to be an accurate estimate of seroprevalence, true cumulative infected or IFR.
It serves to technically assist other modelers who may incorporate its techniques to understand the
epidemiological situation. This paper's seroprevalence calibration technique, especially after refinement,
checking for inaccuracies, and integration into more advanced models, is applicable in cities, smaller
states, and smaller countries where seroprevalence data is available, and where the epidemiological
parameters like social interaction are fairly uniform. Epidemiologically heterogenous geographic units
would necessarily need to be subdivided into more homogenous subunits for analysis.
As of the date of this writing, in the opinion of the author, it is of utmost urgency to continue
seroprevalence survey collection and to use it for model calibration, so that we can better understand,
collectively, where we are now, and where the epidemic will likely take us.
Weaknesses
1) Instability of 𝑘-. and 𝛽 over time.
2) There is bias in the sample used to produce the seropositivity test compared to the survey population.
3) Too many degrees of freedom in the regression may require additional seroprevalence data points, or
incorporation of mortality data to determine both 𝑘-. and 𝛽.
4) Inaccurate estimation of sensitivity and specificity increases error.
5) Non-uniform subpopulations would need to be subdivided into multiple uniform analyses.
6) Noise in the case data, for example from different rates of testing, needs to be mitigated further
7) Lack of confidence intervals would allow naive application of this model to draw significantly
inaccurate conclusions.
8) This paper was written by one person and published without peer review -- there may be significant
errors.
9) This paper should not be used directly to support any epidemiological conclusion without
professional review. It is designed to be an element that can be incorporated into other
professional models.

Calculating Test Results from the 3 S's: Seropositivity, Sensitivity and Specificity
Let
𝑁 ≡ Total number tested
𝑥 ≡ Number of tested positives that are condition positive (true positives)
𝑦 ≡ Number of tested negatives that are condition negative (true negatives)
𝑥′ ≡ Number of tested positive that are condition negative (false positives)
𝑦′ ≡ Number of tested negative that are condition positive (false negatives)
𝑝 ≡ Sensitivity of the test
𝑞 ≡ Specificity of the test
𝑇Z ≡ Total number tested positive (regardless of the true condition)
𝑇U ≡ Total number tested negative (regardless of the true condition)
𝑆Z ≡ Fraction of tested who are (true condition) seropositive
𝐶Z ≡ number of tested who are condition positive (regardless of the test result)
𝐶U ≡ number of tested who are condition negative (regardless of the test result)
By definition:

𝑇Z = 𝑥 + 𝑥′

Eq. 1A

𝑇U = 𝑦 + 𝑦′

Eq. 2A

𝐶Z = 𝑥 + 𝑦′

Eq. 3A

𝐶U = 𝑦 + 𝑥′

Eq. 4A

𝑝 = 𝑥/𝐶Z

Eq. 5A

𝑞 = 𝑦/𝐶U

Eq. 6A

𝑁 = 𝑥 + 𝑦 + 𝑥′ + 𝑦′ = 𝑇Z + 𝑇U = 𝐶Z + 𝐶U

Eq. 7A

Combining the definitions in Eq. 3A and 4A with 5A and 6A:

(𝑥 + 𝑦′) 𝑝 = 𝑥

Eq. 8A

(1 − 𝑝) 𝑥 = 𝑝 𝑦′

Eq. 9A

(𝑥 + 𝑦′) 𝑝 = 𝑦

Eq. 10A

(1 − 𝑞) 𝑦 = 𝑞 𝑥′

Eq. 11A

Combining Eq. 2A and 9A; and 1A and 11A respectively:

𝑇U = 𝑦 + (1/𝑝 − 1) 𝑥

Eq. 12A

𝑇Z = 𝑥 + (1/𝑞 − 1) 𝑦

Eq. 13A

𝑦 = 𝑇U + (1 − 1/𝑝) 𝑥

Eq. 14A

Rearranging Eq. 12A:
Substituting Eq. 14A into 13A and then expanding, simplifying, rearranging and solving for x:

𝑇Z = 𝑥 + (1/𝑞 − 1) [ 𝑇U + (1 − 1/𝑝) 𝑥 ]

Eq. 15A

𝑇Z = 𝑥 + (1/𝑞 − 1)(1 − 1/𝑝) 𝑥 + (1/𝑞 − 1) 𝑇U

Eq. 16A

𝑥 + (1/𝑞 + 1/𝑝 − 1/𝑝𝑞 − 1) 𝑥 = 𝑇Z + (1 − 1/𝑞) 𝑇U

Eq. 17A

(1/𝑞 + 1/𝑝 − 1/𝑝𝑞) 𝑥 = 𝑇Z + (1 − 1/𝑞) 𝑇U

Eq. 18A

𝑥 = [𝑇Z + (1 − 1/𝑞) 𝑇U ] / (1/𝑝 + 1/𝑞 − 1/𝑝𝑞)

Eq. 19A

𝑦 = [𝑇U + (1 − 1/𝑝) 𝑇Z ] / (1/𝑝 + 1/𝑞 − 1/𝑝𝑞)

Eq. 20A

By symmetry:
Eq. 21A
By rearranging Eq. 9A to solve for y' and substituting the definition of 𝐶Z from Eq. 3A, and then
simplifying:

𝐶Z = 𝑥 + (1/𝑝 − 1) 𝑥

Eq. 22A

𝐶Z = 𝑥/𝑝

Eq. 23A

Substituting Eq. 19A into 23A and multiplying through by 1/p:
𝐶Z = [𝑇Z + (1 − 1/𝑞) 𝑇U ] / (1 + 𝑝/𝑞 − 1/𝑞)

Eq. 24A

Noting the definition of 𝑁 = 𝑇Z + 𝑇U and rearrange the definition to substitute for T+ in Eq, 24A :
Eq. 25A
𝐶Z = [𝑁 − 𝑇− + (1 − 1/𝑞) 𝑇− ] / (1 + 𝑝/𝑞 − 1/𝑞)

𝐶Z = (𝑁 − 𝑇− /𝑞) / (1 + 𝑝/𝑞 − 1/𝑞)

Eq. 26A

Using again the definition 𝑁 = TZ + TU and substituting for 𝑇U :

𝐶Z = [𝑁 − (𝑁 − 𝑇+ ) /𝑞] / (1 + 𝑝/𝑞 − 1/𝑞)

Eq. 27A

Simplifying and then solving for 𝑇Z

𝐶Z = [ 𝑇+ + 𝑁(𝑞 − 1)] / (𝑞 + 𝑝 − 1)

Eq. 28A

𝐶Z (𝑞 + 𝑝 − 1) = 𝑇+ + 𝑁(𝑞 − 1)]

Eq. 29A

𝑇Z = (𝑝 + 𝑞 − 1)𝐶+ + 𝑁(1 − 𝑞)]

Eq. 30A

Thus, if one knows with certainty the specificity and sensitivity for any test population and the number
who have been tested and are actually positive, the number that are tested positive are known15.
This can be used to illustrate the difference between naively taking the positive antibody percentage of a
test as an estimate of the true positive antibody percentage of the same test population. It can also be
compared to the assumption of a single sensitivity against an actual calibrated test that has increasing
sensitivity dependent on the number of days since infection.
Note that if the sum of the sensitivity and specificity is less than 1 (i.e. their sum is less than 100%), the
antibody test is unusable (i.e. bad) as the coefficient on 𝐶Z is negative, so that a higher condition positive
result would impossibly create a lower test positive result. This corresponds to a receiver operating

15
For purposes of this paper, which is an example demonstration of the effects of known sensitivity and specificity
on the naive results, no calculation is made of the inaccuracy due to small sample size (i.e. confidence interval or
distribution); and no adjustments are made for the known spread or distribution of specificity or sensitivity
measurements. They exist and can be statistically computed if the information is available at the cost of added
complexity.

characteristic (ROC) point in the lower right hand half of the plot that is worse than a random guess [21],
i.e. more wrong than right.
Also note if the specificity is a perfect 100% Eq. 30A reduces to simplified forms:

𝑇Z = 𝑝 𝐶Z

Eq. 31A

Equation 31A is occasionally useful, but for example in the cases where specificity is even just 5% below
100% (i.e. 95%), this simplified equation yields significant errors.
A simple example will show how this information can be used to calculate the test results from known
seropositivity:
Assumption: Specificity is known precisely as 0.99 and does not vary with time. Sensitivity is exactly

Table 7A - Simplified (Rounded) Sensitivity Table
This is a rounded to the nearest 10% version of the NY Wadsworth Test (see this paper's Table 5 Wadsworth Calibration Test Sensitivity and Specificity). When the tested subjects consists of a pool with
different infection dates, Equation 30A cannot be used to compute the tested positive for the test in
aggregate. Instead, each "vintage" of infection must be used to individually calculate the tested positive
for that vintage, with the total of tested positive for each vintage then summed up to get the total tested
positive for the survey. Additionally, the false positives must be included for the cohort of the test that
has never been infected. Let
𝜃Z ≡ The percentage of the entire test population that is test positive (of all vintages)
𝑆Z ≡ The percentage of the entire test population that is condition (truly) positive (of all vintages)
By definition

𝜃Z = 1/𝑁 g 𝑇:Z

Or by substitution of Eq. 30A into Eq. 32, and then expanding and simplifying:
:klm

𝜃Z = [ 1/𝑁 g (𝑝: + 𝑞 − 1)𝐶:Z ] + (1 − 𝑞)

Eq. 33A

:;<

The formula in 33A is easy to apply. 1) Use a model to estimate the true infected at each time (in days)
𝐶:Z . i.e. at the 25 day vintage say there are 4 infected. 2) Multiply that by the coefficient which is the
sum of the sensitivity 𝑝: for that 25 day vintage, plus the specificity, less 1. 3) Sum that up for all

vintages. Note that for those beyond the maximum (in the table above, 30 or more days), they can be
included all together. 4) Divide that sum by the total number of tested (regardless of test result or true
infected or not infected state. 5) Add to the result 1 minus the specificity (which is assumed to be the
same at all vintages. The result is the percentage of the entire test population that is expected to test
positive assuming the specificity and sensitivity is exactly correct.
In the following examples, it will be convenient computationally to split 𝑇Z in Eq. 30A into a left and right
half, i.e.
𝑇Z = 𝑇Z•HI: + 𝑇Z‚ƒyx:

Eq. 34A

𝑇Z•HI: = (𝑝 + 𝑞 − 1)𝐶+

Eq. 35A

𝑇Z‚ƒyx: = 𝑁(1 − 𝑞)

Eq. 36A

By inspection one can see that 𝑇Z•HI: is the component of the positive tests due to actual condition
positive, and that 𝑇Z‚ƒyx: is the component of the positive tests due to (imperfect) specificity without
regard for condition.
Similarly, it is convenient to split the percentage test results in Equation 33A into left and right
component:
𝜃Z = 𝜃Z•HI: + 𝜃Z‚ƒyx:

Table 8 - Infections Doubling Every 3 Days Example

As can be noted, the calculated total test positives 𝜃Z is only 20.89%, whereas the total true positives
is 100%. This ratio, of approximate 5x the true positives to test positives is exaggerated because 1) the
number of infections is rapidly growing; and 2) in the end 100% of this hypothetical test population is
infected.

Table 9 - Flat New Cases Example
In this example, daily new infections are constant with the exception of the final day, where they are
reduced from 244 to 240 to make the example equal exactly 10,000 for the period. Note that the
percentage infected detected by the test 𝜃Z is half the true infected rate.

Table 10 - Infections Decreasing at 3 days Half-Life Example
Even in an example where infections are decreasing at an exponential rate, with a 100% true infection
rate, the antibody test only gets an 88% total tested positives. However, the amount of underestimation is
only 100-88=12% in this case, vs. 100-21=79% in the growing case or 100-50=50%% in the flat case.
This stark difference in underestimation of the true infected percentage depending on the growth or
decline of the true infected population time series demonstrates that calibration requires an estimation of
the rate of growth or the decline in growth of the true infected time series.
