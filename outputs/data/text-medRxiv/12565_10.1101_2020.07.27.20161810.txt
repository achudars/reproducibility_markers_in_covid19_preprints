ABSTRACT
Background: Identification of risk factors for COVID-19-associated hospitalization is needed to
guide prevention and clinical care.
Objective: To examine if age, sex, race/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions is
independently associated with COVID-19-associated hospitalizations.
Design: Cross-sectional.
Setting: 70 counties within 12 states participating in the Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated
Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) and a population-based sample of nonhospitalized adults residing in the COVID-NET catchment area from the Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System.
Participants: U.S. community-dwelling adults (≥18 years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID19-associated hospitalizations, March 1- June 23, 2020.
Measurements: Adjusted rate ratios (aRR) of hospitalization by age, sex, race/ethnicity and
underlying medical conditions (hypertension, coronary artery disease, history of stroke, diabetes,
obesity [BMI ≥30 kg/m2], severe obesity [BMI≥40 kg/m2], chronic kidney disease, asthma, and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
Results: Our sample included 5,416 adults with COVID-19-associated hospitalizations. Adults
with (versus without) severe obesity (aRR:4.4; 95%CI: 3.4, 5.7), chronic kidney disease
(aRR:4.0; 95%CI: 3.0, 5.2), diabetes (aRR:3.2; 95%CI: 2.5, 4.1), obesity (aRR:2.9; 95%CI: 2.3,
3.5), hypertension (aRR:2.8; 95%CI: 2.3, 3.4), and asthma (aRR:1.4; 95%CI: 1.1, 1.7) had higher
rates of hospitalization, after adjusting for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. In models adjusting for
the presence of an individual underlying medical condition, higher hospitalization rates were
observed for adults ≥65 years, 45-64 years (versus 18-44 years), males (versus females), and
non-Hispanic black and other race/ethnicities (versus non-Hispanic whites).

INTRODUCTION
As of June 26, 2020, over 9 million cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the
disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, have been reported worldwide (1); over 2 million cases,
including >120,000 deaths, have been reported in the United States (2). Older age and underlying
medical conditions are prevalent among cases (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13). Based on
preliminary estimates, approximately 30% of U.S. laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were
among adults aged ≥65 years (7, 8) and about one third had underlying medical conditions (9).
Among U.S. hospitalized cases, diabetes mellitus (8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14), hypertension (10, 11,
12, 13, 14), cardiovascular disease (8, 9, 10, 14) obesity (10, 11, 13, 14), and chronic lung
disease (8, 9, 10) were common. However, the risk of hospitalization imparted by underlying
medical conditions is not clear; many of these conditions, e.g., obesity (15), hypertension (16),
and diabetes (17), are also prevalent in the general U.S. population.
Similarly, the risk of hospitalization related to sex and race/ethnicity is unclear. An
estimated 60% of New York patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were male (11); however, other
studies have found the male-female distribution among COVID-19 hospitalizations to be similar
to the general U.S. population (50%) (10,18). Non-Hispanic black adults comprised a greater
proportion of hospitalized COVID-19 cases compared to the community population in 14 states
(10) and to overall hospitalizations in Georgia (18).
Two studies of communities served by single health care systems in Louisiana (19) and in
New York City and Long Island (20) assessed the independent risk for hospitalization among
adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (19, 20); however these studies did not account for
the underlying distribution of age, sex, race/ethnicity and underlying medical conditions in these
communities.
To better understand the independent association of age, sex, race/ethnicity, and
underlying medical conditions with COVID-19-associated hospitalization relative to the non-

hospitalized community-dwelling population, we calculated rate ratios for adults with and
without select underlying medical conditions, adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, using data
from the Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVIDNET) and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), two large multi-state
surveillance systems.

METHODS
Surveillance data sources and definition of cases
COVID-NET is an all age population-based surveillance system of laboratory-confirmed
COVID-19-associated hospitalizations. To be included as a case, patients must have a positive
SARS-CoV-2 test no more than 14 days before admission or during hospitalization; be a resident
of the pre-identified surveillance catchment area; and be admitted to a hospital where residents of
the surveillance catchment area receive care. Medical chart abstractions using a standard case
report form are performed by trained surveillance officers to collect additional data such as
patient demographics, underlying medical conditions, clinical course, and outcomes data.
Additional COVID-NET details are described elsewhere (10, 21). This study includes 70
counties in 12 participating states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland,
Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, and Utah).
The BRFSS is a nationwide cross-sectional telephone survey that collects state-based
data on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services
from more than 400,000 community-dwelling adults (≥18 years) each year (22). The BRFSS was
used to provide estimates of the non-hospitalized population in the 70 COVID-NET counties
included in this study, herein referred to as the COVID-NET catchment area. The percentage of
adults with the select underlying medical conditions of interest by demographic subgroup (sex,
age group, race/ethnicity group) were calculated from BRFSS respondents residing in the

COVID-NET catchment area. These responses were then weighted to the total population at risk
for hospitalization residing in the catchment area using an iterative proportional fitting method,
which includes categories of age by gender, race and ethnicity groups, education levels, marital
status, regions within states, gender by race and ethnicity, telephone source, renter or owner
status, and age groups by race and ethnicity to improve the degree and extent to which the
BRFSS sample properly reflects the sociodemographic make-up of our geographic area of
interest (22). Weights also accounted for survey design, probability of selection, nonresponse
bias, and non-coverage error (22). To understand if the prevalence of underlying medical
conditions in the COVID-NET catchment area was different from national estimates, nationwide
BRFSS data were used. All weighted population estimates were calculated using 2018 BRFSS
data for each characteristic and underlying medical condition except hypertension; 2017 was the
most recent year of available BRFSS data that included hypertension questions.
To match the population captured by BRFSS, this analysis was restricted to communitydwelling adults (≥ 18 years) residing in the 70 COVID-NET counties in 12 states with available
data on underlying medical conditions (Figure 1). As of June 23, 2020, there were a total of
5,715 adult COVID-19-associated hospitalizations eligible for inclusion in our analysis; 5,416
adults had underlying medical condition data and composed the analytic population for this
study.
Variable definitions
In COVID-NET, the presence of underlying medical conditions was ascertained if the
condition (hypertension; history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, coronary
artery bypass grafting; stroke; diabetes mellitus; chronic kidney disease; asthma; chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) was present in the patient’s medical chart that detailed
their COVID-19-associated hospitalization. In BRFSS, underlying medical conditions were

based on self-report to the question: “Has a doctor, nurse, or other health professional ever told
you that you had… ” (high blood pressure; heart attack also called myocardial infarction, angina
or coronary heart disease; stroke; diabetes, chronic kidney disease; asthma; COPD, emphysema,
or chronic bronchitis).
Histories of myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, and coronary artery bypass
grafting (only available in COVID-NET) were categorized as coronary artery disease. In BRFSS,
adults who self-reported having high blood pressure and answered “yes” to the subsequent
question “are you currently taking medication for your high blood pressure?” were categorized
as having hypertension. In COVID-NET data, body mass index (BMI) was calculated using
height and weight listed in medical charts; if these data were not available, recorded BMI was
used. In BRFSS, self-reported height and weight were used to calculate BMI. BMI was then
categorized as obese (≥30 kg/m2) or severely obese (≥40 kg/m2).
For both COVID-NET and BRFSS data, we created an “any condition” variable (which
included presence of history of coronary artery disease; stroke; diabetes; obesity; severe obesity;
chronic kidney disease; asthma; COPD) and “number of conditions” variable (0; 1; 2; 3+).
Hypertension was not included in the “any condition” or “number of conditions” variables
because COVID-NET catchment estimates for hypertension were derived from 2017 BRFSS
estimates and could not be integrated with the other 2018 estimates of underlying medical
conditions. Although hypertension is not included in these composite variables, in 2017, 14% of
adults with treated hypertension also had at least one other underlying medical condition
examined in this analysis. Additional details are available in Supplemental Table 1. The
following categories were defined for age (18-44; 45-64; ≥65 years), sex (male; female), and
race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white; non-Hispanic black; other). Other races and ethnicities
besides non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic were aggregated due to small cell sizes from the

COVID-NET catchment area once these data were stratified by age, sex and underlying medical
conditions.
Statistical analysis
Demographic characteristics were tabulated among hospitalized COVID-19 cases overall
and by underlying medical condition. The prevalence of select underlying medical conditions
was calculated among COVID-19-associated hospitalizations, the COVID-NET catchment area,
and nationwide. Unadjusted rate ratios were calculated to compare the relative rates of
hospitalization by demographic subgroup or presence of each underlying medical condition. The
numerator for each rate was the number of hospitalized adults in each demographic subgroup
with or without each underlying medical condition estimated from COVID-NET. The
denominator for each rate was the number of adults in each demographic subgroup with or
without each underlying medical condition derived from BRFSS estimates for the COVID-NET
catchment area. Generalized Poisson regression models with a scaled deviance term to account
for overdispersion were used to calculate unadjusted and adjusted rate ratios and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) associated with hospitalization. Multivariable models included an individual
underlying medical condition, age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Model goodness of fit was assessed
by evaluating standardized deviance residual plots. Rate ratios with 95% CIs that excluded 1
were considered statistically significant. We also assessed the prevalence of co-occurring
conditions in hospitalized cases (Supplemental Table 2); however, due to the analytic design of
this study and small cell counts of BRFSS estimates from the COVID-NET catchment area, we
were unable to account for combinations of underlying medical conditions in our adjusted
models. Weighted population estimates from BRFSS were calculated using SAS-callable
SUDAAN. All other analyses were performed using SAS v.9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
No personal identifiers were included in either COVID-NET or BRFSS data submitted to
CDC. This analysis was exempt from CDC’s Institutional Review Board, as it was considered

part of public health surveillance and emergency response. Participating sites obtained approval
for the COVID-NET surveillance protocol from their respective state and local IRBs, as
required.

RESULTS
Of 5,416 community-dwelling adults with COVID-19-associated hospitalization, 30%
were aged 18-44 years, 40% were aged 45-64 years and 31% were aged 65+ years; 53% were
male; 34% were non-Hispanic White, 32% were non-Hispanic Black and 34% were of other
races/ethnicities (Table 1). Overall, 55% had obesity, 49% had hypertension, 33% had diabetes,
16% had severe obesity, 13% had asthma, 12% had chronic kidney disease, 9% had a history of
coronary artery disease, 6% had COPD, and 4% had a history of stroke. Excluding hypertension,
73% of hospitalized cases had at least one underlying medical condition. Co-occurring
underlying medical conditions were common among hospitalized cases (e.g., most adults with
coronary artery disease, stroke, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or COPD also had
hypertension) (Supplemental Table 2).
Among hospitalized cases, the prevalence of underlying medical conditions was greatest
among adults aged 65+ years except for obesity, severe obesity, and asthma (Table 1). The
prevalence of obesity (63%) and severe obesity (25%) was greatest among adults aged 18-44
years. The prevalence of asthma was similar across all age groups. Males and females had
similar prevalences of history of stroke, diabetes, and COPD. The prevalence of underlying
medical conditions was highest among non-Hispanic black adults, except for coronary artery
disease and COPD.
The overall prevalence of selected underlying medical conditions was greater among
hospitalized cases compared to the COVID-NET catchment area population (Figure 2). COVIDNET catchment area estimates were similar or slightly lower than nationwide estimates:

hypertension (21% vs. 25%), coronary artery disease (5% vs. 7% ), history of stroke (3% vs.
3%), diabetes (9% vs. 11%), obesity (28% vs. 31%), severe obesity (4% vs 5%), chronic kidney
disease (2% vs. 3%), asthma (10% vs. 9%), and COPD (5% vs. 7%).
Unadjusted rate ratios for COVID-19-associated hospitalizations of adults 45-64 years of
age and 65 years and older, versus 18-44 years, were 2.0 (95%CI: 1.8, 2.1) and 2.7 (95%CI: 2.5,
2.9), respectively (Table 2). The unadjusted rate ratio for hospitalization comparing males to
females was 1.2 (95%CI: 1.1, 1.3) and for non-Hispanic black to non-Hispanic white adults was
3.9 (95%CI: 3.7, 4.2). Adults with, versus without, specified underlying medical conditions had
higher rates of hospitalization; unadjusted rate ratios ranged from 1.2 (95%CI: 0.4, 3.8) for
COPD to 5.3 (95%CI: 2.4, 12.1) for chronic kidney disease.
The rate ratios for underlying medical conditions attenuated after adjustment for age, sex,
and race/ethnicity; except for the rate ratios for severe obesity and asthma which remained stable
(Table 2). In descending order of magnitude, the adjusted rate ratios (aRR) for hospitalization by
underlying medical condition were as follows: severe obesity (aRR:4.4; 95%CI: 3.4, 5.7),
chronic kidney disease (aRR:4.0; 95%CI: 3.0, 5.2), diabetes (aRR:3.2; 95%CI: 2.5, 4.1), obesity
(aRR:2.9; 95%CI: 2.3, 3.5), hypertension (aRR:2.8; 95%CI: 2.3, 3.4), asthma (aRR:1.4; 95%CI:
1.1, 1.7), coronary artery disease (aRR:1.3; 95%CI:0.99, 1.8), COPD (aRR: 0.9; 95%CI: 0.7,
1.4), stroke (aRR: 0.9; 95%CI: 0.6, 1.4) (Table 2; Figure 3). After adjustment for age, sex, and
race/ethnicity, rate ratios for hospitalization increased with the number of conditions (versus no
conditions), with the greatest rate ratio for adults with 3+ conditions (aRR: 5.0; 95%CI:3.9, 6.3)
(Supplemental Table 3).
Across individual underlying medical condition models, the adjusted rate ratio of
hospitalization was significantly higher for adults ≥65 years and 45-64 years (versus 18-44
years), males (versus females), and non-Hispanic black and other race/ethnicities (versus nonHispanic whites) (Table 2). For example, in the severe obesity model, adults ≥65 years (aRR:

4.6; 95%CI: 3.6, 5.9), 45-64 years (aRR: 2.7; 95%CI 2.1, 3.4) versus18-44 years; males versus
females (aRR: 1.4; 95%CI: 1.1, 1.7); and non-Hispanic blacks (aRR: 4.7; 95%CI: 3.8, 5.9) and
other race/ethnicities (aRR: 3.5; 95%: 2.8, 4.3) versus non-Hispanic whites had higher
hospitalization rates. These associations were similar in models adjusting for any condition
(Table 2) and number of conditions (Supplemental Table 3).

DISCUSSION
In this study utilizing two large multi-state surveillance systems to compare hospitalized
cases with the community at risk, we found that increasing age, male sex, non-Hispanic black
race/ethnicity, other race/ethnicities, and select underlying medical conditions were associated
with a significantly greater risk for COVID-19-associated hospitalization relative to the nonhospitalized community-dwelling adult population. Among the underlying medical conditions
studied, the magnitude of risk was greatest for severe obesity, chronic kidney disease, diabetes,
obesity, and hypertension; each of these conditions was independently associated with
approximately 3 or more times the risk of hospitalization after accounting for age, sex, and
race/ethnicity. Among adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and sought care at health
systems in Louisiana (19) and in New York City and Long Island (20), chronic kidney disease
(20), obesity (19, 20), diabetes (20), and hypertension (20) were also found to be associated with
increased odds of hospitalization (adjusted odds ratios ranging from 1.4 to 2.4) after accounting
for age, sex, race/ethnicity (19, 20), and either the Charlson comorbidity index (19) or other
select medical conditions (20). Our study extends the literature by quantifying the independent
association of underlying medical conditions with hospitalization relative to the community
population at risk.
Similar to other studies (10, 11, 12, 13, 14), we found that hypertension, obesity, and
diabetes were common among COVID-19-associated hospitalizations. In our study, prevalences

of all select underlying medical conditions was greatest among hospitalized COVID-19 patients
compared to the COVID-NET catchment area and nationwide. Similar to nationwide estimates
(16, 17), hypertension and diabetes were more common in middle and older aged adults with
COVID-19-associated hospitalizations. Obesity was greatest in those 18-44 years old with
COVID-19-associated hospitalizations, unlike nationwide estimates of obesity which are
relatively similar across age groups (15). The prevalence of chronic kidney disease among adults
with COVID-19-associated hospitalizations was similar to national estimates of chronic kidney
disease calculated from albuminuria or serum creatinine measures (23). However, these
estimates were higher than self-reported estimates from the COVID-NET catchment area and
nationwide derived estimates from BRFSS. This difference may be in part due to medical
abstraction vs. self-report ascertainment; an estimated 90% of adults with chronic kidney disease
do not know they have it (23).
The magnitude of risk for COVID-19-associated hospitalization was lower for coronary
artery disease, stroke, asthma, and COPD than for other medical conditions (e.g., hypertension)
in our analysis. Our prevalence estimates of asthma and/or COPD (18%) was similar to a study
among adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (15%), which found that asthma or COPD
was not independently associated with risk for hospitalization (20). However, among
hospitalized patients, coronary artery disease and COPD have both been found to be associated
with intensive care unit admission, need for mechanical ventilation (24,25) and mortality (24, 25,
26).
We found that ages 45-64 years and 65+ years were independently associated with
increased risk of hospitalization compared to ages 18-44 years after accounting for underlying
medical conditions, sex, and race/ethnicity. Further, the magnitude of risk for hospitalization was
greatest among adults 65 years and older, similar to other studies (19, 20). It is important to note

that the additional risk of age 65 years and older, and of age 45-64 years, is relative to younger
age (18-44 years) and should not be interpreted as absolute risk.
Males were 30% more likely to be hospitalized than females after accounting for age,
race/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions, similar to another study (20). Non-biological
factors may lead to a greater proportion of males being hospitalized (e.g., increased exposure or
delays in care seeking). Biological factors could include immune function suppression by
testosterone compared to estrogen (27) or lower expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2,
a receptor that allows entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells, due to estrogen, potentially
inhibiting severe clinical progression in females compared to males (28).
Over-representation of non-Hispanic black adults among hospitalized COVID-19 patients
has been hypothesized to be due to the higher prevalence of underlying medical conditions (10,
19) such as hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease among the non-Hispanic
black population (15, 16, 17, 23). While these conditions contributed to the total risk, we found
that after accounting for underlying medical conditions, age, and sex, non-Hispanic black adults
had four times greater risk of hospitalization than non-Hispanic white adults. Additionally, the
magnitude of risk was similar across underlying medical conditions (aRR range: 4.0 to 4.7),
suggesting that non-Hispanic black adults experience excess risk regardless of select underlying
medical conditions. This association was also observed when controlling for the presence of any
condition or the number of conditions. Black race was similarly associated with 3 times the risk
of hospitalization in an Atlanta-based study (29). It has been suggested that non-Hispanic black
adults might be more likely to be hospitalized due to increased exposures (e.g., related to
occupation or housing) that could lead to increased incidence or more severe illness; differences
in health care access or utilization; or systemic social inequities, including racism and
discrimination (30, 31, 32). However, we were unable to assess these factors with our data.

These factors may also explain similar findings of increased risk for hospitalization among other
race/ethnicities.
Overall, these results have implications for clinical practice, as they identify high-risk
patients who require closer monitoring and management of their chronic conditions during the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While specific underlying medical conditions studied imparted
higher risk of hospitalization, we were unable to account for the duration of each condition or the
degree to which each condition was controlled (e.g., glycemic control in diabetic patients).
Nevertheless, clinicians might prioritize more aggressive control of underlying conditions with
available treatments and encourage their patients to remain engaged in care for management of
their chronic conditions while practicing preventive measures, such as wearing a cloth face
covering and social distancing. These groups may also benefit from targeted preventative and
therapeutic interventions.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, this analysis is based on data as of June 23, 2020
from COVID-NET, a surveillance system designed first to provide hospitalization rates.
Additional data such as underlying medical conditions is reliant on medical chart abstraction;
approximately 60% of the total hospitalized cases have yet to be abstracted for underlying
medical condition. Thus, included cases represent a convenience sample of hospitalizations with
underlying medical conditions, which may have resulted in biased estimates of risk. However,
bi-weekly updates of this analysis over a 2-month period with the most recently available
COVID-NET data (i.e., additional chart abstractions) suggests consistent estimates of the
frequency and distribution of underlying conditions and resulting rate ratios. Second, these data
did not include institutionalized adults. Third, estimates of risk are restricted to the COVID-NET
catchment area; the interpretation of rate ratios as risk in this analysis assumes that risk of SARSCoV-2 infection is consistent across all groups. Fourth, we were unable to assess the association

of more granular race/ethnicity categories or co-occurring underlying health conditions due to
small cell sizes from the COVID-NET catchment area; further investigation on both aspects is
important. Fifth, COVID-NET likely under-ascertains COVID-19 cases as testing for SARSCoV-2 is performed at treating health care providers’ discretion and is subject to clinician bias as
well as variability in testing practices and capabilities across providers and facilities. However,
this probably had minimal impact on our findings as hospitalized individuals are more likely to
be tested than those in the community. Finally, we used BRFSS to obtain estimates for
underlying medical conditions in the COVID-NET catchment area. As the ascertainment of
underlying medical conditions was different across the two data systems (self-report vs. medical
chart abstraction), we may have introduced bias in the rate ratio estimation. Self-reported
diabetes (33) and hypertension (34) have high correlation with medical examination estimates.
Self-report has been found to underestimate prevalence of chronic kidney disease (23) and
obesity (34); thus, our rate ratios for these conditions may be overestimated.

CONCLUSION
This analysis quantifies associations of age, sex, race/ethnicity, and underlying medical
conditions with risk of COVID-19 hospitalization relative to the non-hospitalized communitydwelling population. These data may aid clinicians in identifying individuals at higher risk for
hospitalization who may require more vigilant care and monitoring, and groups that may benefit
from preventive and therapeutic interventions.

†Catchment population estimates from direct Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System estimates of underlying medical conditions aggregated from
counties participating in COVID-NET, providing community level data on underlying health conditions, 2018; error bars represent 95% confidence
interval surrounding estimates
‡Nationwide estimates from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 2018; error bars represent 95% confidence interval surrounding
estimates
§Estimates for hypertension from COVID-NET Catchment Area and Nationwide BRFSS estimates are from 2017, the latest year of available data.
