Abstract
The relative isolation of many island communities provides some protection from the COVID-19

28

pandemic, as imported cases can be limited and traced effectively. Until recently, this was true

29

for the population of the French overseas department, Reunion Island, where only limited

30

numbers of autochthonous cases were observed prior to August 2020. Since the report of the first

31

case of COVID-19, contact tracing has been carried out for each new case identified in Reunion

32

Island to identify transmission and clusters. To contribute to the public health response and

33

understand the diffusion of SARS-Cov-2 strains in Reunion Island, we established in-house

34

genome sequencing capability in Reunion using Oxford nanopore technology (MinION) as an

35

inexpensive option for genomic typing of SARS-CoV-2 lineages on the island, and cross-

36

validated typing results between viral isolation methods and different sequencing technologies.

37

The results of our work during the early phase of the epidemics are presented herein.

Introduction:
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified as

40

the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China in December 2019 after

41

its emergence from wild animal populations[1]. Since, it has infected more than 45,000,000

42

individuals with 1.2 million deaths worldwide (at the time of writing). Its transmission has been

43

rapid and widespread despite global intervention measures (such as quarantine and travel

44

restrictions) due largely to the fact that viral transmission can occur from asymptomatic

45

individuals and pre-symptomatic individuals[2]. This coupled with its relatively high case

46

fatality rate[3] means that SARS-CoV-2 remains a public health emergency of unprecedented

47

scale.

48

The response to this pandemic has also been of an unprecedented scale. Governments

49

have restructured healthcare systems to accommodate increased testing capacity for improved

50

contact tracing, and genomics has played an important role in improving our understanding of

51

COVID-19 transmission pathways and outbreaks[4,5]. As the number of acquired mutations in

52

the SARS-CoV-2 genome has been relatively low over the course of the pandemic, whole

53

genome sequencing has been essential to allow accurate strain typing, which in turn allows cases

54

to be associated based on genetic similarity of the infecting strains. One study from Australia

55

estimated that the use of genomic typing in conjunction with classical epidemiological tracing

56

improved the case assignment rate by as much as 16%[6]. Next generation sequencing has

57

therefore been of great importance during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and emerging

58

technologies such as Oxford Nanopore sequencing have made genomic approaches more

59

accessible: To date, there have been more than 100,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in the

60

Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database[7].

61

Reunion Island is an overseas department of France situated in the Indian Ocean and is

62

largely subject to the same regulations concerning COVID-19-related practices as mainland

63

France and the other French overseas departments. Reunion Island has a population of

64

approximately 850,000 people who live mainly in coastal regions. The population is relatively

65

young, with people 65 years or over representing 8.1 % fewer of the population than in mainland

66

France (2020 institute of national statistics data, www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques). The first case of

67

COVID-19 was reported in Reunion on 11th March 2020, four days before French regulations

68

imposed strict lockdown measures which significantly reduced mobility across the country[8].

69

Prior to this in February, all direct commercial flights between Reunion and China had been

70

suspended. In addition, lockdown measures provided effective protection for the Reunion

71

population, meaning that numbers of cases remained low and were mainly imported as local

72

inhabitants returned from areas of active SARS-CoV-2 circulation. Importantly, during this time

73

most inbound flights were canceled, returning passengers were obliged to undergo a 14-day

74

confinement period upon arrival, and all returning individuals were closely monitored by

75

regional health authorities. Limited local virus circulation occurred in Reunion at this time, with

76

approximately 70 % imported cases and 30 % autochthonous cases (defined as most likely local

77

transmission with no history of travel), with a limited severity [9]. Subsequently, Reunion

78

avoided the first pandemic wave that swept through Europe and placed the European population

79

at the epicenter of the pandemic from March to April 2020. A timeline of reported cases and

80

important events in the epidemiology of COVID-19 on Reunion Island is presented in Figure 1.

81

Here we isolated and provided genomic data of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating during the early

82

phase of the epidemics on Reunion Island.

85

Methodology:
Patients and samples
Nasopharyngeal specimens were recovered either from patients admitted to CHU

86

Reunion or from outpatients, all with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. Before use, we

87

ascertained the presence of viral genomic ARN in each specimen swab by real time RT-qPCR

88

(described below). Samples were handled and stored at -80°C in a biosecurity level three

89

virology laboratory. Consent was obtained from each patient, classified as non-opposition, at the

90

time of entry to the hospital.

91
92

RNA Extraction and RT-qPCR
Nucleic acids were extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia,

93

California, USA) and eluted in 60 μL of AVE buffer. Reverse transcription was performed on 10

94

μL of RNA using the ProtoScript II Reverse Transcriptase and Random Primer 6 (New England

95

BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) as previously described[10]. cDNAs were tested for the presence

96

of the N and Nsp14 genes using the PCR protocol published by The University of Hong Kong

97

(https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/molecular-assays-to-diagnose-covid-19-summary-

98

table-of-available-protocols). PCR were performed with the QuantiNova Probe RT-PCR Kit

99

(QIAGEN, Valencia, California, USA) and 5 µL of cDNA in a CFX96 Touch™ Real-Time PCR

100

Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).

101
102

Viral isolation and production
SARS-CoV-2 strains were isolated in the African green monkey kidney cell line, Vero

103

E6. Briefly, cells were cultured in a 25 cm2 flask containing 5 ml of Eagle medium (MEM:

104

Gibco/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine

105

serum (FBS), 2 mmol/L L-Glutamine, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL of penicillin, 100

106

µg/mL of streptomycin and 0.5 µg/mL of Amphotericin B (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany),

107

at 37°C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. When cell density reached approximately 80%, cells were

108

rinsed once with MEM medium supplemented with 2% FBS, then 50 to 100 µl of SARS-CoV-2-

109

positive swab specimen was mixed with 2 mL MEM 2% FBS and layered on the Vero cell

110

monolayer. After 2 h of incubation the inoculum was removed, cells were rinsed once and 6 mL

111

of fresh MEM 2% FBS medium was added. Flasks were incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2

112

atmosphere. Cultured were checked daily. Cell lines demonstrated a cytopathic effect 3 to 5 days

113

post-infection. Supernatants of positive cultures were recovered, centrifuged at 400 X g for 5 min

114

at 4°C, then aliquoted and stored at -80°C until used.

115

For viral production, a total of 100 µl supernatant of positive culture was used to infect a

116

monolayer of Vero cells grown in 75 cm2 flask as above. After three days, cytopathic effect was

117

visible and the supernatant was recovered, cleared by centrifugation, aliquoted and stored at -

118

80°C.

119
120

Viral titration
Titration was performed by plaque-forming assay. Vero cells (cultured as above) were

121

seeded in 6-well culture plates. Tenfold dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 solution were made in MEM

122

2% FBS culture medium and 500 µl of each dilution was added to the cells in duplicate. After an

123

incubation of 2 h at 37°C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere, unabsorbed viral particles were removed

124

and 2 ml of culture medium supplemented with 0,8% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC; Sigma-

125

Aldrich, Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France) was added to each well and incubation was extended

126

for 5 days. The CMC overlay was carefully removed, and the cells were fixed with 2 mL of 3.7

127

% paraformaldehyde in PBS. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 20 min. The cells were then

128

rinsed once with PBS and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% ethanol. Plaques were visually

129

counted and expressed as plaque-forming units per mL (PFU/mL).

131

Nanopore (MinION) Sequencing and Analysis:
Genomes were sequenced from viruses originally infecting four independent patients.

132

Two samples (RUN-PIMIT1 and RUN-PIMIT2) were from couple of travelers returning from

133

France mainland. Sample RUN-PIMIT8 was obtained from a tourist originating from Greece

134

whereas sample RUN-PIMIT20 was quoted as real autochthonous case with unidentified contact

135

with an imported case. We combined different sequencing technologies to cross-validate the

136

sequences generated by different protocols. We also re-sequenced the same isolates from

137

different passage histories to examine whether cell-line isolation may result in the accumulation

138

of mutations.

139

In total, ten SARS-COV2 genomes were sequenced on a single Oxford Nanopore

140

Technologies FLO-MIN106D (R9.4.1) flowcell using the Artic Network’s overlapping amplicon

141

protocol[11,12]. Following first-strand cDNA synthesis (as above), all sample preparation

142

methods followed the nCoV-2019 sequencing protocol version 2

143

(https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bdp7i5rn). Briefly, genomic material was amplified in

144

two independent PCR reactions using version 3 primer pools obtained from of the Artic network

145

website (https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019). PCR products were pooled, dA-tailed

146

using the NEBNext® Ultra™ II End Repair/dA-Tailing Module then barcoded using the

147

Nanopore Native Barcoding Expansion kit (EXP-NBD104). Barcoded amplicons were then

148

purified using a 0.4x volume of AMPure-XP SPRI beads, washing the beads with an excess

149

volume of Nanopore’s small fragment buffer (SFB) to ensure that un-ligated barcode molecules

150

were removed. Purified amplicons were then pooled in equimolar proportions before adapter

151

ligation and sequencing.

152

The sequencing run was left for 24 hours and stopped when predicted coverage exceeded

153

1000-fold for each genome. Basecalling and demultiplexing were performed using guppy

154

(v4.0.11). Basecalling used default parameters in accurate mode, and demultiplexing was

155

performed using the “--require_barcodes_both_ends” parameter to minimize sample crosstalk.

156

Reads were then assembled using Medaka v1.0.3 (https://nanoporetech.github.io/medaka/) as

157

part of the Artic network bioinformatics standard operating procedure

158

(https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html), subsampling amplicon

159

coverage to 400x and using genome accession MN908947.3 for read mapping. Geneious

160

v9.1.8[13] was used to inspect and curate mapped sequence data. Consensus base-calling

161

required a minimum of 30-fold coverage.

162
163

Illumina Sequencing and Analysis:
Four of the SARS-CoV-2 samples (2 isolates and 2 swabs) that were sequenced using the

164

ONT amplicon protocol were additionally sequenced using an Illumina shotgun method from

165

unamplified cDNA in order to complete genomic loci that were poorly amplified by the tiling

166

PCR and to allow cross validation of the ONT sequencing methodology against the Illumina gold

167

standard.

168

Briefly, sequencing libraries were generated from 10 ng of cDNA using the Celero™

169

PCR Workflow with Enzymatic fragmentation (DNA-Seq) following the manufacturer’s

170

instructions. Sequencing was performed on the MiSeq platform, with 1 * 170 bp single end

171

reads. Demultiplexed sequences were provided by the sequencing company (Biofidal, Lyon,

172

France). Sequences were quality trimmed and adapters removed using Trimmomatic v0.39.

173

Trimmed reads were mapped to reference sequence MN908947.3 using minimap2 v.2.17-

174

r941[14]. Geneious v9.1.8[13] was used to inspect and curate mapped sequence data and

175

consensus sequences.

176
177

Genome typing:
Assembled genomes were assigned to global major lineages using pangolin v.2.0.5[15] to

178

compare to the pangoLEARN database (version from 20th July 2020), default parameters were

179

used for quality control filtering and probability scores for lineage calling.

180
181

Results and Discussion:
MinION sequencing generated complete genomic data sets for six of the eight sequenced

182

isolates and for one swab out of two (Table 1). The remaining three samples (two isolates and

183

one swab) demonstrated high Ct values when detecting viral cDNA by qPCR, suggesting that the

184

concentrations of virus in these samples were low. PCR amplification was not uniform in these

185

samples and genomic assemblies had short gaps where 30-fold coverage was not achieved. The

186

primers used in the tiling protocol are unable to target the 3’ and 5’ extremities of the virus, and

187

therefore all assemblies were missing 54 bases from the 5’ extremity and 67 bases from the 3’

188

extremity.

189

Illumina shotgun sequencing produced near-complete genome assemblies for four of the

190

samples (two isolates and two swabs), again only excluding 5’ and 3’ extremities of the genome,

191

which had limited coverage that varied between isolates. By combining Illumina and MinION

192

data mapped to the same reference strain we were able to improve the genomic assemblies for

193

these four genome sequences. Furthermore, in genomic regions that were successfully sequenced

194

by both approaches, no disagreements were observed in consensus sequences generated by

195

MinION and Illumina sequencing. However, MinION assemblies had a slightly higher

196

proportion of ambiguous base calls.

197

Sequencing data are summarized in Table 1.

198

Resequencing of isolated passage variants produced identical sequence variants to the

199

parental strain in each instance (Table 2), suggesting that the process of viral isolation and

200

passaging (in this case in Vero E6 cells) does not select for mutant variants.

201

Typing assigned all genomes to pangolin lineage B.1, either belonging to GISAID

202

lineage G, or GH (Table 2) which (along with lineage GR) are the prevailing lineages circulating

203

globally at the time of writing [16]. Phylogenetic analysis identified three different sequence

204

variants, which differed from each other by a maximum of seven mutations (Figure 2).

205
206

Conclusion:
Our findings provide support that MinION sequencing can be successfully applied for

207

rapid sequencing and generation of genomic data in remote locations, such as on Reunion Island.

208

Paired comparison with genomes obtained with Illumina sequencing further highlight that the

209

quality of the generated sequences can be used confidently in molecular epidemiology and

210

phylodynamic studies.

211

Additionally, we observed that viral isolation, limited passaging and production in Vero

212

E6 cell lines were not associated with the selection of mutations that could bias genomic typing

213

results. This is important due to the strong genetic similarity between prevailing SARS-CoV-2

214

lineages and because cell-line based viral amplification is a useful method for extracting

215

increased quantities of viral material when direct sequencing of swabs with low viral loads may

216

provide incomplete genomic data.

217
218

At the time of writing, Reunion Island is facing its first wave of COVID-19 infection,
with more than 400 cases of COVID-19 reported weekly[17]. As has been demonstrated

219

elsewhere, genomic data can be used to significantly improve the case assignment rate and

220

contact tracing measures that help to mitigate future disease[6]. Phylodynamic investigations

221

based on these data can also inform the timing and origin of viral introduction, as well as their

222

local transmission dynamics and epidemiological characteristics. Thus, the capacity to perform

223

in-house, rapid and comparatively cheap genomic typing of SARS-CoV-2 isolates will hopefully

224

play an important role in improving Reunion Island’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

225

These analyses are intended to continue on a larger local scale in Reunion Island in order to

226

understand the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 during the current, largely autochthonous, COVID-

227

19 epidemic wave.

* Genomes are regarded as complete if <2.5 % of the genome is missing from the 3’ and 5’ ends of the genome. Any genome containing consecutive ambiguities outside of the 3’ and 5’ regions is considered as incomplete.
** MinION coverage is calculated by mapping in Medaka after subsampling sequence coverage to a maximum of 400x per primer pair. Overlapping regions increase average coverage.
***Genomic sequences were considered as identical if no polymorphisms were present. Base calls in Illumina data versus ambiguous calls in MinION data are not considered to be contradictory (unless the ambiguity code o
the base call in the Illumina sequence).
+ For cultured isolates, cell lines are indicated. For isolates that are resequenced from previous passages, corresponding parental strain is indicated.
