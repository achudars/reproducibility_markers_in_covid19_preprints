Abstract

16

The rapid spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), initially reported in the city

17

of Wuhan in China, and quickly transmitted to the entire nation and beyond, has become

18

an international public health emergency. Estimating the final number of infection cases

19

and the turning point (time with the fastest spreading rate) is crucial to assessing and

20

improving the national and international control measures currently being applied. In

21

this paper we develop a simple model based on infectious growth with a time-varying

22

infection rate, and estimate the final number of infections and the turning point using

23

data updated daily from 3 February 2020, when China escalated its initial public health

24

measures, to 10 February. Our model provides an extremely good fit to the existing data

25

and therefore a reasonable estimate of the time-varying infection rate that has largely

26

captured the transmission pattern of this epidemic outbreak. Our estimation suggests

27

that (i) the final number of infections in China could reach 78,000 with an upper 95%

28

confidence limit of 88,880; (ii) the turning point of the fastest spread was on the 4th or

29

the 5th of February; and (iii) the projected period for the end of the outbreak (i.e., when

with an upper 95% confidence limit on the 19th of March. This suggests that the current

32

control measures in China are excellent, and more than sufficient to contain the spread

33

of this highly infectious novel coronavirus, and that the application of such measures

34

could be considered internationally for the global control of this outbreak.

Introduction

37

The Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) possibly originated from bats1 and caused the

38

current pneumonia outbreak, raging since December 2019. As the COVID-19 has an

39

excessively high human-to-human transmission capability, and the early outbreak stage

40

coincided with the travel rush of the Chinese Spring Festival, the pandemic has been

41

spreading rapidly2. According to reports by the National Health Commission of China

42

(NHCC), the first confirmed case was reported in Wuhan (Hubei Province) on 8

43

December 2019; the following day there were also confirmed cases in the major Chinese

44

cities of Beijing and Shanghai, as well as in the neighbouring countries of Japan, Thailand

45

and South Korea; as of 25 January, a total of all 31 Chinese provinces, as well as Hong

46

Kong, Macau, Taiwan, the United States, France and Australia reported pandemic cases of

47

COVID-19. It is apparent that the pandemic is still ongoing both in China and

48

internationally.

49

In the meantime, Chinese authorities have taken prompt public health measures to

50

control this outbreak. Medical teams and supplies from all over the country flooded into

51

Wuhan. All major cities in Hubei Province were sealed off to contain the spread of the

52

virus, with quarantine imposed on all people exposed to the virus. China has striven to

53

limit the spread of the virus through prohibiting human traffic and movement at an

54

unprecedented level. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also taken a series of

55

measures to consolidate global scientific research, quarantine, and surveillance efforts to

56

help fight the pandemic. At present, WHO is working with partner agencies to enhance

57

the global diagnostic capabilities of COVID-19, improve surveillance and the tracking of

58

disease transmission, along with mobilizing global powers to coordinate research on

59

vaccines, therapies and diagnostic technologies for the virus.

60

For effective monitoring and containment of the pandemic, it is therefore crucial to

61

predict and estimate the spreading dynamics of this novel infectious disease from a

62

modelling point of view. Much has been done using the traditional SIR epidemiological

63

models3-5. However, such models often suffer from unreliable model structure and

64

parameterization; these problems are especially pronounced in this case when the

65

pathology and the transmission pathways of the virus remain unclear, making rapid,

66

accurate forecasting impossible. Here we propose a population ecology model with a

67

time-varying infection rate that does not rely on the detailed pathology of the disease

68

but could accurately capture the spreading dynamics of the virus. This model allows us

69

to estimate and predict the spreading dynamics of the COVID-19 with reliable accuracy,

70

given the current healthcare measures in place.

71
72

Materials and Methods

73

We first develop a simple population dynamic model with a time-varying parameter. Let

74

𝑁(𝑡) be the number of infected cases, with its temporal dynamics following an ordinary

75

differential equation, 𝑑𝑁(𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 = 𝑟(𝑡)𝑁(𝑡), where 𝑟(𝑡) is the time-dependent

76

infection rate. This model applies when the susceptible population is large but the

77

outbreak is limited and temporary so that the demographic dynamics of the entire

78

population remain unchanged (i.e., the additional death and recovery rates caused by

79

the infection among all residents of the Hubei Province are negligible). With this simple

80

model, we can estimate the turning point as the moment when the number of infected

81

cases increases at the fastest speed, happening when 𝑑2 𝑁(𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 2 = 0. That is, the

82

turning point is the solution to the equation 𝑑𝑟(𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 + 𝑟(𝑡)2 = 0. Notably, 𝑑𝑟(𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 <

83

0 is necessary condition for existing turning point. In practice, the infection rate can be

84

estimated as 𝑟(𝑡 + 1/2) = ln(𝑁(𝑡 + 1)) − ln(𝑁(𝑡)), where 𝑡 is measured in days.

85

We compiled the daily numbers of diagnosed COVID-19 infections from 10 January

86

to 10 February 2020 in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, and the whole of China from the

87

website of the NHCC (www.nhc.gov.cn) and the Health Commission of Hubei Province

88

(wjw.hubei.gov.cn). This allowed us to analyse the data at four levels: Wuhan city, Hubei

89

Province, the rest of China, and the whole of China. As there were two large-scale control

90

measures implemented on 26 January and 2 February, we fitted the time-dependent

91

infection rate 𝑟(𝑡) with exponential functions for two periods: from 27 January to 2

92

February, and from 3 February to 10 February. We estimated the trajectories of the

93

cumulative number of infected cases using the fitted infection rate according to the

94

difference equation, 𝑁(𝑡 + 𝜏) = exp(𝑟(𝑡 + 𝜏/2)𝜏)𝑁(𝑡), with 𝜏 = 0.05 (day). The daily

95

increase of infected cases can be calculated as (𝑁(𝑡 + 𝜏) − 𝑁(𝑡))/𝜏, and the turning

96

point can be identified according to the condition 𝑑𝑟(𝑡)/𝑑𝑡 + 𝑟(𝑡)2 = 0.

Results and Discussions

99

Since 26 January when China implemented strict nationwide control measures, a clear

100

pattern of transmission has emerged. Albeit minor declines can be observed, the time-

101

varying rate of infection has dropped exponentially for the whole of China and Hubei

102

Province, although the rate still increases in Wuhan city (red lines in Fig.1). This means

103

that the first nationwide control measure (implemented on 26 January) failed to contain

104

the outbreak and the spread remained out of control.

105

According to the data from 3 February to 10 February, the infection rates of Wuhan

106

city, Hubei Province and the whole of China were all declining at largely the same rate (a

107

decrement of 0.16-0.18 per day; the slope of blue lines in Fig.1), similar to the rate of

108

decline in the rest of China when the Wuhan and Hubei cases were excluded (the slope of

109

the blue curve in Fig.1). It is worth pointing out that the infection rate has declined at a

110

steady pace for areas outside Hubei Province. This suggests that the second nationwide

111

control measure (implemented on 2 February) was effective. The fitted model from 3

112

February to 10 February can accurately predict the daily and accumulated infection

113

numbers on 11 February. However, on 12 February, Hubei Province changed its clinical

114

diagnostic approach, leading to a sharp rise of diagnosed cases and a reported daily

115

increase of 15,151 infections; this unforeseeable change made the number of reported

116

cases much greater than model predictions. Nevertheless, the reports after 12 February

117

suggest that the change of clinical diagnostic approach did not affect the transmission

118

pattern, and the daily infection rate reverted to our model prediction (black crosses in

119

Fig.1). As such, we have estimated the spreading dynamics after 13 February according

120

to our fitted model (from 3 February to 10 February). Our results show that the total

121

numbers of infections in Wuhan city, Hubei province, and the whole of China, are 48,530,

122

64,640 and 77,990 respectively (Table 1). By subtraction, this means a total number of

123

13,350 for the rest of China excluding Hubei Province, which is highly consistent with

124

the model prediction of 13,660 (see Table 1).

125

Our model also suggests that the spreading dynamics follow a typical S-shaped

126

logistic curve. This means that there is a turning point when the rate of infection has

127

reached its peak. Transmission accelerates when approaching the turning point, then

128

decelerates after the turning point. Our model indicates a turning point around the 4th to

129

the 5th of February (Fig.1 & 2). The duration of the outbreak, for reaching 95% of the

130

final predicted number of infection from 10 January, was estimated to last 46 days in

131

Wuhan city, 43 days in Hubei and the whole of China, and 37 days when Hubei was

132

excluded (Table 1); it was estimated the outbreak would subside at the end of February

133

in China.

134

Our model assumed an infinite size of a susceptible population trivially affected by

135

infection, recovery and control. This makes our model different from the traditional SIR

136

or SEIR epidemiological models, where the rise of infection cases is due to the large

137

susceptible population, while the decline of infection cases is due to the depletion of the

138

susceptible population. Such typical pattern of epidemiological models is obviously

139

unsuitable for the spread of COVID-19 in China with susceptible populations of such

140

massive size (e.g., >11 million residents in Wuhan alone and ~60 million residents in

141

Hubei). Epidemiological models could be more suitable for modelling the spread of

142

COVID-19 among the 3,400 passengers and crew members on the Diamond Princess

143

cruise ship currently docked in Japan’s Yokohama harbour for quarantine.

144

Our simple model captured the dynamic nature of the infection rate, which can be

145

adjusted flexibly according to updated data. This allows us to predict short-term

146

spreading dynamics with accuracy, which is essential for the live monitoring of the

147

epidemic. According to the time dependency of the infection rate, we could also assess

148

the effectiveness of implemented control measures and provide modelling support to

149

adjust any public health measures. Our results showed three stages of the COVID-19

150

spreading: (1) the early stage with no clear dynamic patterns, due largely to lack of

151

awareness and diagnostic capability; (2) from 27 January to 2 February there were

152

nationwide control measures but with no clear effect on the control of the disease,

153

especially in Wuhan city; (3) since 2 February another coordinated nationwide control

154

measure was implemented, with the clear effects of containing the spread of the virus,

155

decelerating and eventually reducing the epidemic. Lessons learnt from these

156

nationwide control measures applied after 2 February should be communicated to the

157

WHO, to help contain the spread of COVID-19 worldwide.
