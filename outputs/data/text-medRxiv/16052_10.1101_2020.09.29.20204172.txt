Summary

36

Ever since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new coronavirus disease 2019

37

(COVID-19) as a pandemic, there has been a public health debate concerning medical resources

38

and supplies including hospital beds, intensive care units (ICU), ventilators, and Protective

39

Personal Equipment (PPE). Forecasting COVID-19 dissemination has played a key role in

40

informing healthcare professionals and governments on how to manage overburdened healthcare

41

systems. However, forecasting during the pandemic remained challenging and sometimes highly

42

controversial. Here, we highlight this challenge by performing a comparative evaluation for the

43

estimations obtained from three COVID-19 surge calculators under different social distancing

44

approaches, taking Lebanon as a case study. Despite discrepancies in estimations, the three surge

45

calculators used herein agree that there will be a relative shortage in the capacity of medical

46

resources and a significant surge in PPE demand as the social distancing policy is removed. Our

47

results underscore the importance of implementing containment interventions including social

48

distancing in alleviating the demand for medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic in the

49

absence of any medication or vaccine. It is said that “All models are wrong, but some are

50

useful,” in this paper we highlight that it is even more useful to employ several models.

Introduction

53

The outbreak of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute

54

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), started in Wuhan City, China, and has

55

rapidly spread all over the world. The newly identified coronavirus has 96% homology with the

56

genetic sequence of β-coronaviruses; which include SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory

57

syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV)1,2.. Despite similarities, SARS-CoV infection was limited to

58

specific geographic areas, while COVID-19 has been declared as a global pandemic by the WHO

59

on 11 March 2020. As of 17 September 2020, there are 29,737,453 COVID-19 confirmed cases,

60

937,391deaths, and around 213 countries or territories affected with cases around the world3.

61

COVID-19 has not only caused mortality but has put tremendous pressure on healthcare systems

62

and led to shortages in Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

63

Africa Region (MENA) countries including Lebanon, the COVID-19 pandemic is leading to a

64

health crisis and worsening the spike in demand on healthcare resources and supplies 6. To monitor

65

the strain on healthcare systems in each country, it is essential to closely follow the demand for

66

hospital beds, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and ventilators 7. Therefore, a growing number of

67

models have been established around the world to aid in forecasting COVID-19 deaths, cases, and

68

the demand for medical supply (including ventilators, hospital beds, and ICU beds, the timing of

69

patient surges, and more)8–10. While simple models apply the user’s inputs on the local population

70

and current status of COVID-19, more sophisticated models permit the user to modify other

71

parameters (e.g., social distancing changes) that affect the trends. Some of the models match

72

projected cases to existing capacity to project when and where a caseload surge will surpass

73

capacity11. Data-driven modeling approaches have also appeared for the COVID-19 pandemic, in

74

which statistical and machine learning models are used for projecting cases, hospitalization,

4,5

. In the Middle East and North

75

deaths, and the impact of social distancing12 Unfortunately, forecasting what is most likely to occur

76

in the upcoming weeks during the COVID-19 pandemic is not available for all countries including

77

some European countries or few states in the USA 8. Where available, different models are

78

providing widely varying numbers of needed medical resources and/or supplies which often lead

79

to an incorrect distribution of what is available due to inconsistency in numbers. For example, the

80

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that COVID-19 outbreaks in parts of the

81

USA have resulted in surges in hospitalizations and ICU patients 13. However, providing accurate

82

predictions of the healthcare system capacity peak demand is controversial due to the scarcity

83

and/or unreliability of data in addition to challenges associated with forecasting the effects of the

84

rapid changes in mitigation policies

85

outbreak’s trajectory for the upcoming days are limited due to variabilities in assumptions and

86

parameters including social distancing14–16. Accordingly, the use of a single forecasting model

87

may not precisely predict how the pandemic evolves 17.

88

Regardless of all the challenges, COVID-19 has put forecasting at the top of global public

89

policymaking and developing effective preventive strategies 18,19. Since there is no “gold standard”

90

for predicting thresholds, the reasonable evaluation of the outputs of various forecasting models

91

has remained an open question

92

projected demand for medical resources and supplies from three surge calculators for COVID-19

93

taking Lebanon as our case study. To this end, we adapted an available statistical model for

94

estimating the daily impact of COVID-19 on hospital services based on the COVID-19 Hospital

95

Impact Model for Epidemics (CHIME). The model was modified to incorporate longer projection

96

periods and different social distancing policies (%). We then compared the hospital beds, ICU

97

beds, and PPE demand over 200 days projected by the three surge calculators a) CHIME PPE

99

our own developed American University of Beirut Medical Center (COVID-19 AUBMC Surge

100

needs) calculator. The results of these calculators differ depending on the parameters and

101

assumptions implemented within to generate the forecasted data. Despite the discrepancies in

102

estimations, the three surge calculators used herein consistently agree on trends demonstrating that

103

social distancing policy can help reduce the demand for medical resources and supplies amid the

104

COVID-19 pandemic.

105

Methods

106

Data collection

107

Case counts, population and hospital capacity data

108

We used the WHO and the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) websites to identify data

109

on the estimated Lebanese population in 2020 (6,825,000) and confirmed COVID-19 infected

110

individuals and death cases respectively. Data on inpatient beds, ICU capacity, and mechanical

111

ventilators were obtained from the Lebanese MoPH website (Table 1). The data for the COVID-

112

19 AUBMC calculator regarding PPE demand were collected based on historical and current data

113

estimates from the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC), presuming these

114

data as a nationwide reference. In most of the calculations, numbers derived from Lebanon were

115

used where available.

118

Our estimations were based on the CHIME model that was initially developed by the Predictive

119

Health at Penn Medicine in the USA21, which permits healthcare systems to enter data about their

120

population and modify the assumptions about the COVID-19 spread and behavior21. The tool runs

121

a modified Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, a traditional epidemiological forecasting

122

technique, to estimate the number of new COVID-19 hospital admissions per day. The SIR model

123

calculates the theoretical number of people infected with an infectious disease over a period of

124

time in a closed population with the Kermack-McKendrick model being the simplest of all SIR

125

models22,23. The CHIME model was built to help hospital systems to accurately project the needed

126

resources during the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators 24. The

127

model accounts for four main parameter categories: 1) the hospital parameters, 2) spread and

128

contact parameter, 3) severity parameters, and 4) display parameters. The model allows integrating

129

some information about social distancing policies that are emplaced by governments 24.

130

In this study, we have introduced some modifications to the CHIME application to make it

131

compatible with the input parameters available for the projections in Lebanon.

132

The modifications were twofold:

133

1. Automate the data projection process:

134

The application was updated allowing the user to enter the input parameters into an “Excel

135

workbook” and obtain the generated census compiled together in the same workbook. This

136

alleviates the data processing part where the user needs to obtain each projection separately. It also

137

enables faster simulations for different input parameters and most importantly different social

138

distancing measures (Table 2).

139

2. Allow projections over a longer period:

6

140

The application initially allowed for a maximum 30-day projection period. Our contribution

141

enables for longer periods such as 200 days, as seen herein. This provides analysts and healthcare

142

workers with longer forecasts, thus giving them more time to prepare for periods of peak demand.

143

The CHIME projects the daily and cumulative number hospitalized, ICU, ventilated, and newly

144

admitted COVID-19 cases, with social distancing policy percentage being the variable.

145

3. Provide simultaneous known cases (per day) as output

146

The modification allows us to study the number of daily infected individuals after deducting the

147

number of recovered cases. The number reflects the confirmed cases and does not consider

148

possible infected individuals that are not confirmed yet. The aim behind this modification is to

149

provide these numbers as inputs to the calculators, especially COVID-19 AUBMC and WHO

150

COVID-19 ESFT calculators.

151
152

Our projections were based on three social distancing policy scenarios (0%, 30%, and 50%)

153

based on the National Health Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19

154

pandemic lock-down management and exit strategy implemented by the Lebanese Government 6.

155

We also simulated the strict social distancing policy (92%) based on the Wuhan-style

156

containment 25. The latter was performed to assess how strict “lock-down” could help better

157

contain the COVID-19 outbreak and maintain the demand for hospital beds, ICU beds,

158

ventilators, and PPE. Although Lebanon started re-opening gradually with limited capacity as of

159

May 4, 2020, the country went again into a complete four-day lockdown starting May 14.

160

Therefore, we ran our estimations on May 14, 2020 (Day 0) assuming the four social distancing

161

policy scenarios. The other social distancing policy scenarios and the mitigation dates below

162

were chosen as the per five-step re-opening plan implemented by the Lebanese Government 6

163

(Table 2).

164

PPE calculators

165

We have used the WHO COVID-19 ESFT calculator (WHO 2020a) and the COVID-19

166

AUBMC surge Needs calculator, to estimate daily and total hospital beds, ICU beds, ventilators,

167

and PPE demand. Results obtained from the CHIME PPE calculator were then compared to

168

those derived from the WHO COVID-19 ESFT and COVID-19 AUBMC calculators. As the

169

COVID-19 AUBMC calculator was developed by our team, we chose the CHIME PPE

170

calculator because it is compatible with the CHIME model, and the WHO COVID-19 ESFT

171

calculator because it is widely used as a worldwide reference to estimate medical resources and

172

supplies to respond to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Also, the CHIME and COVID-19 ESFT

173

calculators are freely available online for use by governments, stakeholders, and healthcare

174

centers.

175

The CHIME PPE calculator

176

The CHIME PPE calculator was generated to work in parallel with CHIME-generated

177

projections. The calculator uses forecasted patient censuses to output daily and cumulative

178

projections for each type of PPE (including N95 masks, surgical masks, gloves, gown, and eye

179

disposable protection) quantities per day, and computes the cumulative PPE predictions 26. This

180

tool also permits users to input their custom scenarios (standard, crisis, contingency, and

181

custom), tailored to the specific situations relevant to their hospital or healthcare system 26. In

182

our study, we chose the values for the standard scenario assuming we do not have exact publicly

183

available data estimates of the exact number of staff and HCW (healthcare workers) in Lebanon.

184

As social distancing policies and gradual lifting of restrictions are always the keep factors being

185

debated in the intervention strategies, our estimations were based on the four social distancing

186

policy scenarios mentioned above (Table 2). For each scenario, the projected hospitalized, ICU,

187

and ventilated censuses are inserted into the CHIME PPE calculator in addition to the daily

188

admissions. This data is obtained from the Penn CHIME application model. Based on the

189

provided data the calculator outputs the PPE predictions per day in addition to the total

190

cumulative predictions over the chosen period of 200 days. Since other calculators do not

191

forecast the daily PPE demand, we compared the average daily PPE demand from this calculator

192

with the predictions of other calculators.

193

WHO COVID-19 ESTF Calculator

194

The 2020 WHO COVID-19 ESTF calculator is developed to aid countries in estimating potential

195

needs and supplies to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic 27. The tool is not meant to be used as

196

an epidemiological model, yet it has simple exponential growth and Susceptible-Infectious-

197

Removed (SIR) case forecast options built-in 28. The calculator is a supply forecasting tool that

198

helps in estimating potential requirements for essential supplies including PPE (e.g. surgical

199

masks, gloves, gowns, goggles, respirators, and face shields), biomedical equipment for case

200

management (e.g. mechanical ventilators and oxygen concentrators), drugs for supportive

201

treatment, hygiene, and IPC commodities, diagnostics, and consumable medical supplies. The

202

calculator also estimates the weekly number of COVID-19 patients classified according to

203

severity as follows: mild, moderate, severe, and critical. Severe and critical cases are admitted to

204

ICU and require oxygen and ventilation respectively. Inpatient beds in this calculator refer to

205

ICU beds occupied by the critical and severe COVID-19 cases per week and not day. Therefore,

206

the estimated peak for inpatient and ICU beds will be the same throughout the chosen period.

207

Although the tool is suited for projections over a short period (12 weeks), it offers an option to

208

enter data manually and make projections over longer periods. COVID-19-ESFT does not

209

quantify or account for resources already available locally or those pending delivery. The

210

calculator projects the PPE quantity per person per day for inpatient care, cases in isolation,

211

screening, and laboratory, and the total daily costs (USD) of items over 28 weeks. Then, it adds

212

the total quantity for each per day. In this study, we use the default input parameters set by the

213

WHO COVID-19 ESFT calculator for Lebanon, including the population estimate, patients case

214

sensitivity, healthcare workers, and staff. To maintain consistency across the different

215

calculators, we manually input the cumulative projected COVID-19 cases as obtained from the

216

CHIME model application. The data is compiled in a weekly form (up to 28 weeks) to be

217

compatible with the COVID-19 ESTF calculator. This approach guarantees that all calculators

218

are using the same numbers for infections and the focus would be on the

219

discrepancies/agreements between the models on the estimates of resource demand.

220

The COVID-19 AUBMC surge needs calculator

221

The AUBMC calculator (https://www.aub.edu.lb/fm/vmp/Pages/calculators.aspx) was developed

222

by our team based on AUBMC and MoPH data and is implemented as an excel file that predicts

223

the average total of PPE needs (e.g., gloves, surgical face masks, face shields, and N95 masks)

224

per day. The estimations are based on the average number of patients admitted and tested

225

individuals per day using actual PPE demand data collected from AUBMC. Note that we assume

226

AUBMC policies of PPE use (such as wearing surgical masks over N95 masks, replacing

227

surgical masks per patient, and replacing N95 masks per shift) are representative of policies at

228

the national level. The average number of admitted patients is calculated from the Penn CHIME

229

model application projections over the whole pandemic period (200 days) using the
10

230

hospitalization percentage of simultaneously infected individuals. The average number of tested

231

individuals is calculated by dividing the total number of tests done as indicated in

232

(https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/?#countries) by the number of pandemic days. The

233

PPE estimations in this calculator are based on average values as compared to daily/weekly

234

projections used in the other two calculators. This calculator also projects the total number of

235

ventilators, hospital beds, and ICU beds occupied during the COVID-19 pandemic using the

236

same inputs of the CHIME application. The beds and ventilators calculations are designed to

237

estimate the availability during peak periods of the pandemic. The calculator takes as input the

238

currently available ventilators and beds dedicated to COVID-19 patients as declared by MoPH in

239

addition to the peak simultaneous infections and admissions as projected by the Penn CHIME

240

model application. This information helps in forecasting possible shortages in beds or ventilators

241

and the dates when these shortages would occur (Table 3).

243

Results

244

Based on MoPH data, from March 29, 2020, Lebanon is estimated to have 2308 ICU beds and

245

11794 inpatient (hospital) beds. We assume that 32 % of ICU beds and 20% of hospital beds at

246

the national level are currently occupied by non-COVID-19 patients (Table 4). However, this

247

occupancy number is, in reality, higher due to the casualties from the devastating port explosion

248

in Beirut on August 4, 2020. Also, there has been a surge in cases nationally. One reason behind

249

this surge is that many people have been unable to follow precautionary measures, such as social

250

distancing, during the relief efforts in Beirut. Also, some of the major hospitals have been

251

partially or heavily damaged as a result of the huge blast at Beirut’s port. MoPH reported that

252

almost all COVID-19 beds are full and hospitals are running out of space for new patients by the

253

time of writing this work. This incident highlights the challenge of planning during a pandemic,

254

particularly when coupled with unexpected disasters.

255

In one scenario and based on our data, assuming strict social distancing policy or the Wuhan-

256

style (92%), the modified CHIME model estimates that out of the remaining 9435 hospital beds,

257

a peak of 67 inpatient beds is needed by the COVID-19 cases or 0.7 % of the available hospital

258

beds. Of the remaining available 1569 ICU beds and 687 ventilators, the model estimates a peak

259

of 15 (1%) ICU beds, and 10 ventilators (1.5%) are needed by COVID-19 patients respectively,

260

with a decreasing pattern in the estimated COVID-19 infected patients over the projected period.

261

Assuming the same scenario, the COVID-19 ESFT calculator estimates a weekly peak of 11

262

inpatient beds (0.1%), 17 ICU beds (1.1%), and 9 ventilators (1.3%) are occupied. The COVID-

263

19 AUBMC calculator estimates a different peak of 71 inpatient beds (0.8%), 18 ICU beds

264

(1.1%), and 11 ventilators (1.6 %) (Figs. 1.A, 2, and 3). Upon relaxing social distancing

265

measures to 50 %, the CHIME model estimates the same peak capacity for the available inpatient
12

266

beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. Still, the COVID-19 AUBMC calculator differentially estimates

267

that the peak of daily occupied inpatient beds increases to 94 (1%), while ICU beds and

268

ventilators increase to 23, representing 1.47% and 3.35% of the available ICU beds and

269

ventilators respectively. On the other hand, the COVID-19 ESFT estimates an increase in the

270

weekly peak demand of inpatient bed capacity to 1279 (13.75%), the ICU beds to 58 (3.7%), and

271

the ventilators to 16 (1.31%) (Figs. 1.B, 2, and 3).

272

When the social distancing policy is reduced to 30 %, all the surge calculators variably show that

273

the capacity of the daily peak of hospital beds and ventilators occupied by COVID-19 patients

274

significantly increases. The CHIME estimates a daily peak of 4016 inpatient beds (43%), 912

275

ICU beds (58%), and 602 ventilators (88%) to be occupied. With a higher occupancy rate, the

276

COVID-19 AUBMC calculator estimates a peak of 4896 inpatient beds (52%), 1224 ICU beds

277

(78%), and 1224 ventilators. The latter indicates a shortage of 537 ventilators for COVID-19

278

patients in this scenario. On the contrary, the ESFT calculator estimates a marked increase in the

279

weekly peak of inpatient beds (2665) and ventilators (266) but a shortage of 1096 ICU beds

280

(Figs. 1.C, 2, and 3). To evaluate to which extent removing social distancing practices strain

281

hospital capacity, we ran our estimations assuming 0 % social distancing. Our results show that

282

in addition to the variability in projections, all calculators estimated that there will be a shortage

283

in inpatient and ICU bed capacity during the 200 days. Yet, only ESFT calculator estimates that

284

ventilators available can accommodate the critical COVID-19 patients needing ventilation. The

285

CHIME model estimates that the daily peak capacity significantly increases to 113356 inpatient

286

beds, 25528 ICU beds, and 17003 ventilators. Similarly, this increase was marked by the

287

COVID-19 AUBMC calculator that estimated a peak daily capacity of 124658 inpatient beds,

33696 ICU beds, and 36834 ventilators. The ESFT calculator forecasted a daily peak capacity of

289

11876 inpatient beds, 11876 ICU beds, and 657 ventilators (Figs. 1.D, 2, and 3).

290

We also compared the projected demand for different PPE types (including N95, surgical masks,

291

gloves, gowns, disposable eye protection/goggles, and face shield) by the three surge calculators

292

over 200 days assuming the same social distancing policy scenarios (%). The CHIME calculator

293

estimates a minimum average daily demand of various PPE types when Wuhan style (92%)

294

policy is applied. The projected outputs include an average daily demand of 689 N95 masks,

295

1239 surgical masks, and 13086 gloves, gowns, and disposable eye protection. When compared

296

to the CHIME projections, the COVID-19 AUBMC calculator estimates a slightly more daily

297

average demand of 817 N95 masks, however, it estimates an average daily peak demand of

298

11516 surgical masks, 57842 gloves, and 11811 gowns, and 11429 face shields. Interestingly, the

299

ESFT calculator estimates a significantly higher average daily demand values for all PPE types.

300

The estimated average daily demand includes 75082 surgical masks, 159488 gloves, 42331

301

gowns, 36941 goggles, and160 face shields (Fig.4A). The estimated average daily demand for

302

gloves in the ESFT calculator refers to the sum of gloves used for surgery, examination, and

303

heavy-duty. When social distancing policy changes to 50%, the forecasted average daily demand

304

for all PPE types increases gradually to 12023 N95 masks, 216411 surgical masks, 228434

305

gloves, gowns, and disposable eye protection. This increase in the projected average daily PPE

306

demand was also observed with the COVID-19 AUBMC and ESFT calculators. The COVID-19

307

AUBMC estimates 883 N95 masks, 13201 surgical masks, 72317 gloves, 14274 gowns, and

308

11796 face shields. The ESFT estimates an average daily demand of 269432 surgical masks,

309

926610 gloves, 78503 gowns, 71158 goggles, and 280 face shields (Fig. 4B). The projected

310

average daily demand for all PPE types by the three surge calculators was still revealing a spike

311

in values with the 30 % social distancing policy. The CHIME calculated a total average daily

312

demand of 84761 N95 masks, 1525695 surgical masks, 1610456 gloves, 1610456 gowns, and

313

1610456 disposable eye protection. AUBMC estimates 1716 N95 masks, 34705 surgical masks,

314

257035 gloves, 45709 gowns, and 16472 face shields. A significant surge in the average daily

315

demand was also obtained with the COVID-19 ESFT calculator with an estimation of 2786405

316

surgical masks, 210525007 gloves, 535175 gowns, 510030 goggles, and 8201 face shields (Fig.

317

4C). On the other hand, the variability in projections was more emphasized when we applied the

318

0% social distancing policy. The CHIME projected estimated an average daily demand of

319

2701804 N95, 48632478 surgical masks, and 51334282 for gloves, gowns, and disposable eye

320

protection. AUBMC estimated an average daily demand of 34517 N95 masks, 881405 surgical

321

masks, 7530079 gloves, 1283394 gowns, and 200594 face shields. This trend was also obtained

322

with COVID-19 ESFT, estimating an average daily need of 26385273 surgical masks, 45233595

323

gloves, 1982045gowns, 1248759 goggles, and 15433 face shields (Fig.4D).

324

We then compared the change in the forecasted PPE fold-demand from other scenarios with the

325

Wuhan Style scenario (92%) since we have the least contact rate, minimum COVID-19 cases,

326

and minimal projected hospital utilization and PPE demands. So, when we changed social policy

327

to 50%, the CHIME estimated an average of a 17-fold increase in the daily demand for all the

328

PPE types. However, the COVID-19 AUBMC and ESFT reveal a minimum of a 1- and 4-fold

329

increase in the average PPE demand per day. This difference in PPE demand projections

330

becomes more apparent as social distancing policy decreases to 30% where the ESFT and the

331

CHIME estimate up to 46 and 100-fold increase in the average daily demand for all PPE types

332

respectively. Although the COVID-19 AUBMC calculator projected a substantial increase in the

333

average daily demand for all PPE types, this pattern in fold increase was not observed. The

334

calculator, however, estimates only a 4-fold increase in the average daily demand for all PPE

335

types. The difference in estimations was more obvious with the relaxed social distancing

336

scenario (0%). While the CHIME estimates a significant increase in the average daily demand to

337

3000 folds for all PPE types, the COVID-19 AUBMC and ESFT forecast of around 100- and

338

200-fold increase in the average daily demand for all PPE types respectively (Fig. 5).

339

Discussion

340

As the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic sweeps across the Middle East and the world, with

341

evidence of a second wave emerging in some countries, the strain placed on the health system

342

services including hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators continues to escalate. To support the

343

preparedness for a pandemic outbreak, the capability to forecast the potential spread of a disease

344

is an utmost need for applying public health interventions and effectively allocating resources29.

345

Particularly, this is critical for low- and middle-income countries, as they often unevenly bear the

346

infectious diseases burden and are hindered by limitations in resources available to tackle them

347

29

348

of forecasting in the better planning ahead and reducing the impact of the infectious disease

349

outbreaks including healthcare capacity, deaths, and the economic burden experienced,

350

comparing forecasts at the national level remains challenging 17,29,30. The latter can potentially

351

limit the development and use of forecasting 17.

352

In this study, we highlight this challenge by comparing the projected incremental demands of

353

medical resources and supplies by three surge calculators (CHIME, WHO COVID-19 ESFT, and

354

COVID-19 AUBMC) for a single 200-day COVID-19 wave taking Lebanon as our case study;

355

assuming different social distancing policy scenarios. Our results indicate that there is a

356

discrepancy in the forecasted data between the three surge calculators despite the use of identical

, often relying heavily on an increasingly restricted foreign supply-chain. Despite the efficacy

16

357

input data. Yet, the three surge calculators used consistently show that relaxing social distancing

358

policy and mitigation measures can dramatically overwhelm hospital capacity and lead to a

359

dramatic surge in the daily PPE demands during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results are

360

congruent with recommendations for implementing initiatives to “flatten the curve” and avoid

361

healthcare systems from being overwhelmed through the exponential growth of the disease31 .

362

Since prompting social distancing policy measures have helped in reducing the pandemic’s

363

spread as shown by COVID-19 mathematical models 32,33, our comparison was more based on

364

testing the efficacy of this approach on the healthcare infrastructure capacity and PPE demand

365

using the three aforementioned surge calculators.

366

When assuming the strict social distancing measures (Wuhan-style), the three surge calculators

367

projected an unpronounced daily demand for hospital beds, ventilators, and PPE during the

368

pandemic. The variability in estimations between the calculators revealed the least margins of

369

error given this scenario. When relaxing the social distancing measures to 50%, the calculators

370

forecasted that the available hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators are enough to accommodate

371

the projected COVID-19 cases, yet with a very noticeable increase in the average daily PPE

372

demand. By decreasing the social distancing policy to 30%, the calculators estimate that there is

373

a substantial surge in the demand for PPE and hospital utilization. At this stage, the difference

374

becomes more apparent between the forecasted data. However, when the simulated social

375

distancing measures are completely removed, all calculators show to some extent that the

376

COVID-19 pandemic will put unprecedented strain on inpatient beds, ICU beds, ventilators, and

377

there will be a drastic increase in the average daily PPE demands. This underscores the urgency

378

of implementing social distancing to help in limiting COVID-19 community transmission by

379

reducing the circle of social contacts and the contact rate 34. Our results are similar to those of the

17

380

IHME team and Murray who forecasted that the healthcare system’s capacity will be stressed in

381

the USA and Europe during the COVID-19 pandemic and proposed some measures to increase

382

the supply of key products and services8,9. Interestingly, our data indicate that the output

383

predictions of all used surge calculators vary very widely upon relaxing the social distancing

384

policy measures leading to a rise in the margins of agreement.

385

The discrepancy in the obtained results could be related to several reasons. For PPE, some of the

386

items are subdivided into different categories such as the types of gloves, gowns, and masks used

387

by patients and staff as in the WHO COVID-19 ESFT calculator. Also, the ESFT calculator

388

gives a more detailed quantification for PPE, for example, the estimation for gloves refers to the

389

sum of those used for surgery, examination, and heavy duties. In the CHIME and COVID-19

390

AUBMC calculators, some of these categories are missing, which indicates that the PPE types

391

are not being included in the calculated demand. In the COVID-19 AUBMC calculator, the N95

392

masks are considered to be used only in intubations. However, the ESFT calculator does not

393

even give estimates for N95 masks. Moreover, the CHIME and ESFT calculators include PPE

394

needs for testing staff and HCW, which adds to the demand in its estimations. Considering the

395

need for PPE in healthcare departments related to non- COVID-19 patients and used for

396

additional precaution could also increase the calculated demand. Varying results across the three

397

calculators are also evident in the inpatient beds, ICU beds, and ventilators needed during the

398

peak demand period. This can be related to the way each calculator assesses the severity of the

399

cases. According to the COVID-19 AUBMC calculator, each ICU patient is assumed to require

400

ventilation. However, the WHO ESFT calculator assumes that only severe and critical COVID-

401

19 cases are admitted to the hospital and assumes that only the critical cases in ICU require

402

ventilation, while the rest need oxygen tubes. As for the CHIME, it classifies the hospital

18

403

admitted COVID-19 into three categories including hospitalized, ICU, and ventilated. Since

404

there is no absolute truth that we can compare to assess the accuracy, we only resort to the

405

relative comparison. Nevertheless, this wide variability in estimations can add more uncertainty

406

to the forecasted hospital utilization and PPE demand and highlights the importance of

407

maintaining social distancing in the absence of pharmaceutical intervention for COVID-19. To

408

be able to evaluate the surge calculators objectively, the results produced should be compared

409

with their real known values. However, parameters used in models for forecasting the

410

dissemination of infectious diseases are prone to uncertainties and limitations 29. Besides,

411

enhancing the current model forecasting abilities is directly proportional to the accuracy of the

412

data provided 29. In our case, we input the cumulative projected COVID-19 cases as obtained

413

from the modified CHIME model application into all calculators to maintain consistency. Yet, in

414

addition to using already built models, we still lack accuracy as we do not have tangible data in

415

Lebanon on PPE consumption and the capacity of healthcare system infrastructure. Also, we are

416

not very sure how much our input data are up-to-date and reliable especially that the healthcare

417

capacity is subjected to change throughout an outbreak 29.

418

The results of this study were based on showing the differences in estimations done by three

419

surge calculators for COVID-19 and a modified version of the CHIME model to measure needs

420

for different health system resources based on the total of predicted simultaneously active cases.

421

These calculations were carried out based on three important assets receiving significant

422

attention worldwide: inpatient beds, ICU beds, ventilators, and PPE 35,36. Other items and human

423

resources required in the diagnostic and treatment chain can be forecasted including staff and

424

HCW in the frontline of COVID-19 response, and therapeutics for supportive treatment. We

425

believe that one of the major limitations for forecasting COVID-19 is based on the limited

19

426

evidence since neither the magnitude nor duration of the COVID-19 wave is known with

427

certainty. Another limitation is that we did not factor in PPE re-use measures such as sterilization

428

of used N95 masks. Therefore, the adequate management of medical resources (including PPE,

429

beds, ventilators, and health care providers) is highly recommended at this stage as some

430

countries have started to experience a resurgence of COVID-19 cases as the pandemic continues

431

to accelerate. Experience from several countries including China, South Korea, and Singapore in

432

addition to mathematical modeling has revealed that the pandemic can be contained even in the

433

exponential growth phase using a combination of interventions34,37. The latter mainly includes

434

social and physical distancing, public awareness, and wearing masks 34.

435

In conclusion, the surge calculators used here, regardless of the variability in outputs, can be

436

powerful tools for measuring the impact of social distancing policy through highlighting the

437

dangers of scaling down non-pharmaceutical public and social health measures in the absence of

438

any vaccine or therapy against COVID-19. Characterizing forecasting uncertainty can be

439

improved by some promising avenues including methodological advances in model comparison

440

and averaging 29. Therefore, the use of more than one model is recommended to generate more

441

accurate and better predictions of the pandemic’s evolution 38. In other words, policymakers can

442

use these calculators interconnected with each other based on the available data for each country

443

to understand the pandemic from all its angles to be able to generate policymaking frameworks.

444

This urges the need for a clear methodology that allows policymakers to decide which model is

445

more applicable or adaptable for their context 17, and underscores the necessity of enabling

446

calculators to be adopted to local policies and behaviors beyond social distancing. Although gaps

447

in the present data streams provide a challenge for the current epidemic forecasting, recent

448

breakthroughs in this field afford the possibility for refining future predictive models 29. Since

449

the most essential piece of the puzzle in forecasting is data or the quality of data source, we

450

suggest that should the data be more accurate, one can provide pandemic forecasting with fewer

451

constraints.
