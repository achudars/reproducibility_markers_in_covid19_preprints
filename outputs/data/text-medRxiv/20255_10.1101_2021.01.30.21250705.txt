ABSTRACT

Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) related
diagnoses, hospitalizations, and deaths have disproportionately affected disadvantaged
communities across the United States. Few studies have sought to understand how risk
perceptions related to social interaction and essential activities during the COVID-19 pandemic
vary by sociodemographic factors, information that could inform targeted interventions to reduce
inequities in access to care and information.

Methods: We conducted a nationally representative online survey of 1,592 adults in the United
States to understand risk perceptions related to transmission of COVID-19 for various social and
essential activities. We assessed relationships for each activity, after weighting to adjust for the
survey design, using bivariate comparisons and multivariable logistic regression modeling,
between responses of safe and unsafe, and participant characteristics, including age, gender, race,
education, income, and political affiliation.

Results: Half of participants were younger than 45 years (n=844, 53.0%), female (n=800,
50.3%), and White/Caucasian (n=685, 43.0%), Black/African American (n=410, 25.8%), or
Hispanic/Latino (n=382, 24.0%). Risk perceptions of unsafe for 13 activities ranged from 29.2%
to 73.5%. Large gatherings, indoor dining, and visits with elderly relatives had the highest
proportion of unsafe responses (>58%) while activities outdoor, visiting the doctor or dentist,
and going to the grocery store had the lowest (<36%). Older respondents were more likely to
view social gatherings and indoor activities as unsafe, yet more likely to view activities such as

going to the grocery store, participating in outdoor activities, visiting elderly relatives, and
visiting the doctor or emergency room as safe. Compared to White/Caucasian respondents,
Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino respondents were more likely to view activities
such as dining and visiting friends outdoor as unsafe. Generally, men vs. women, Republicans
vs. Democrats and independents, and individuals with higher vs. lower income were more likely
to view activities as safe.

Conclusions: These findings suggest the importance of sociodemographic differences in risk
perception, health behaviors, and access to information and health care when implementing
efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research should address how evidence-based
interventions can be tailored considering these differences with a goal of increased health equity
in the pandemic response.

INTRODUCTION
As of January 2021, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus
that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has infected more than 23 million people and
contributed to over 390,000 deaths in the United States.1 The negative health and social
consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic – including morbidity and mortality; decreased access
to health care; and lost jobs and economic hardships – have not been experienced equally, and
instead have impacted certain communities in greater numbers and with increased severity. For
example, COVID-19 related diagnoses, hospitalizations, and deaths have disproportionately
affected Black communities2 and those in poverty,3 demonstrating the impact of structural racism
and health disparities in disadvantaged populations.4

Numerous COVID-19 pandemic, tracking, mapping, and monitoring tools have emerged,
covering a wide array of indicators from testing capacity to daily case counts and deaths to
policy interventions.5,6 While data collected from these trackers provide critical insights into the
COVID-19 pandemic trajectory and public health response measures, they rarely address
upstream socio-behavioral aspects, such as risk perceptions, knowledge and access to
information, spread of misinformation, and agency and stigma. Yet access to information and
health literacy vary by age, gender, and race and other characteristics with important
implications for risk perceptions, behaviors, and health outcomes, including COVID-19 infection
and mortality.7

Few studies have sought to estimate prevalence of risk perceptions related to social interaction or
essential activities during the COVID-19 pandemic or explore associations between these

perceptions and sociodemographic factors.8,9 Differences in risk perceptions could provide
insights into the determinants of risk perception and health knowledge and subsequent behaviors
related to the COVID-19 pandemic, while also helping to inform development of targeted
communication campaigns and preventive interventions.10,11

The National Pandemic Pulse is a United States-population representative, internet
phone/computer survey designed to obtain data on preventive behaviors, risk perceptions, agency
and stigma, and misinformation related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic across census
regions.12 Our aim is to examine relationships between these issues and sociodemographic
factors to understand how systematic racism and inequity impact health and wellbeing in the
context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here we present findings from the first national Pandemic
Pulse Survey to understand racial and sociodemographic differences in risk perceptions of social
interaction and essential activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS
Study population
We conducted a cross-sectional online survey of adults currently living in the U.S. ages 18 and
older from September 1st to 7th, 2020. The sample was selected from an online panel to represent
the U.S. Census population using pre-specified demographic quotas for age, gender, race, census
region, and income. Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino respondents were oversampled by approximately 385 individuals per group to increase power for analyses comparing
risk perceptions by ethnicity/race groups. This sample allowed for detection of a 10% difference
in proportions between White, Black, and Hispanic ethnicity/race groups assuming power of

80%, type I error rate of 0.05, and a baseline prevalence of 40%-60%. Dynata – a market
research firm (https://www.dynata.com) that maintains a large first-party global data platform,
including 62 million panelists with accompanying demographic information – selected a random
sample from their database to match the U.S. Census estimates. Dynata sent invitations by email
to 16,904 panelists matching the required demographic targets of the survey until each quota was
filled. The survey response rate was 10.0% and completion rate among eligible respondents was
95.3%. Survey responses were excluded for the following reasons: age less than 18 (n=47),
residence outside United States (n=3), ethnicity/race for which sample quota was already filled
(n=171), refusal of consent (n=72), and partial interview (n=77). Security and data quality
checks utilized included digital fingerprinting and spot-checking via third-party verification to
confirm the identity of the respondents and prevent duplication. Participants received a small
compensation for survey completion.

Questionnaire
A team of experts at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health collated COVID-19
questions from existing surveys and created new questions to address existing gaps in the
literature. In a module on risk perception, the focus of this analysis, participants were presented
with a series of thirteen activities related to social and essential activities and asked to respond to
the question: “How safe or unsafe do you think the following activities are in terms of your
getting COVID-19 or giving it to someone else?” Allowed responses included extremely safe,
somewhat safe, somewhat unsafe, extremely unsafe, unsure, and prefer not to say. For the
purpose of this analysis, we collapsed extremely and somewhat categories into perceptions of
‘safe’ and ‘unsafe’.

Statistical analysis
All analyses were adjusted for the study design using survey weights for race by Census region
generated using the 2010 U.S. Census estimates. We assessed bivariate relationships between
responses of safe, unsafe, and unsure and participant characteristics for each activity presenting
percent change (absolute) and assessing significance using Pearson’s chi-squared tests. We used
multivariable logistic regression models to calculate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (OR and
aOR) of perceiving each activity as unsafe and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Participant demographic and socioeconomic characteristics included in multivariable models
were age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, income, census region, and political affiliation. To
assess differences in risk perceptions by age and race, we presented relationships overall and
stratified by White/Caucasian, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino groups.
Multivariable logistic regression models were also extended to include interaction terms for age
and race and assessed for significance using Wald tests (p<0.05). Statistical analyses were
conducted in Stata 16.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).

Ethical approval
Participants provided electronic consent to participate by responding to a question on the survey.
The study received ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board at Johns Hopkins
Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, USA.

Complete responses from 1,592 respondents were included in this analysis. Roughly half of
respondents were less than 45 years old (52.2%) and female (49.5%) (weighted percentages;
Table 1). Participants were 60.0% White/Caucasian, 12.4% Black/African American, and 18.4%
Hispanic/Latino. Risk perceptions of unsafe for the 13 activities ranged from 29.6% to 73.5%
and unsure from 3.7% to 11.6% (Figure 1). Large gatherings (of 10, 100, and church), indoor
dining, and visits with elderly relatives had the highest proportion of unsafe responses (>58%)
while activities outdoor (dining, visiting friends), visiting the doctor or dentist, and going to the
grocery store had the lowest (<36%).

Large gatherings and activities in public
Perceptions of unsafe increased by >15% from the lowest to highest age categories for gathering
of 10, gathering of 100, and going to church (all p<0.001), but decreased by a similar amount for
going to the grocery store (p=0.015) (Figure 2). Males were less likely to perceive these
activities as unsafe, with significant differences (p<0.05), ranging from -3.3% to 7.4%, except
gathering of 10. Perceptions differed by race only for gatherings of 10, highest among
Hispanic/Latino (67.5%) and Asian/Pacific Islander respondents (67.1%) (p=0.011).
Respondents with high education were less likely to perceive gathering of 100 as unsafe
(p=0.024). Perceptions of unsafe decreased with increasing income (p<0.05), with differences
between <$20,000 and ≥$100,000 categories ranging from -3.2% to -10.2%. Democrats and
independents were more likely to perceive activities as unsafe for all variables compared to
Republicans (p<0.001).

In multivariable models (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 1) perception of unsafe increased
with age for gathering of 10 (aOR=1.24 (95% CI: 1.14, 1.35)), gathering of 100 (aOR=1.38
(95% CI: 1.25, 1.52)), and going to church (aOR=1.18 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.28)) and decreased for
going to the grocery store (aOR= 0.89 (95% CI: 0.82, 0.96)). Men were less likely to perceive
activities as unsafe. Across income groups, there was a significant decrease in perception of
unsafe with increasing income for gathering of 10 (aOR=0.86 (95% CI: 0.77, 0.96)) and going to
the grocery store (aOR=0.83 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.92)). Democrats and independents were more
likely to report activities as unsafe relative to Republicans.

Indoor and outdoor dining and visits with relatives
Perceptions of unsafe increased between lowest and highest age categories by >10% for dining
indoor (p<0.001) and visiting friends indoor (p=0.001), and decreased, ranging from -3.1% to 10.1%, for visiting elderly relatives (p=0.039), visiting friends outdoor (p=0.001), and dining
outdoor (p=0.006). Men were less likely to perceive activities as unsafe, with significant
differences (p<0.05), ranging from -3.3% to -10.3%, except for visiting friends outdoor.
Activities in this category varied by race, with White/Caucasian respondents generally less likely
to perceive them as unsafe. Respondents with higher education were less likely to perceive
dining outdoor as unsafe (p=0.040). Perceptions of unsafe decreased with increasing income
(p<0.05) for most of these activities, ranging from -3.8% to -11.8%, except for visiting friends
indoor. Democrats and independents were more likely to report activities as unsafe relative to
Republicans (p<0.001).

In multivariable models (Figure 4), risk perception across age groups increased significantly for
dining indoor (aOR=1.12 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.21)) and visiting friends indoor (aOR=1.15 (95% CI:
1.07, 1.24)). Men relative to women had lower odds of viewing these activities as unsafe, but this
was only significant for visiting friends indoor. There was a significant decreasing trend across
income groups for dining indoor (aOR=0.87 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.97)) and dining outdoor
(aOR=0.87 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.96)) but not visiting friends in either setting. Compared to
White/Caucasian respondents, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino respondents were
more likely to view dining outdoor and visiting friends outdoor as unsafe (Supplementary Figure
1). Democrats were more likely to view these activities as unsafe relative to Republicans. There
was a statistically significant interaction between age and race for visiting an elderly relative
(p=0.061) (Supplementary Table 2). The change in odds of perceiving visiting an elderly relative
as unsafe for each 10-year increase in age was non-significant among White/Caucasian
respondents (aOR=0.99 (95% CI: 0.89, 1.10)) and Hispanic/Latino respondents (aOR=1.11 (95%
CI: 0.96, 1.29)) but significant among Black/African American respondents (aOR=1.35 (95% CI:
1.15, 1.58)).

Medical visits and returning to work
Perceptions of unsafe decreased (-16.2% and -6.3%, respectively) between the lowest and
highest age categories for doctor visits (p<0.001) and going to the emergency room (p=0.006),
and increased (4.2%) for returning to work (p<0.001). Men were less likely to perceive these
activities as unsafe, with significant differences (p<0.05) ranging from -5.9% to -10.5%. Dentist
visits were the only activity for which risk perception significantly differed by race (p<0.001).
Respondents with lower education were more likely to respond “unsure” relative to those with

higher education, with differences (p<0.05) between lowest and highest categories ranging from
-5.2% to -6.9%. Respondents with higher income were less likely to perceive these activities as
unsafe with a range of difference between the lowest and highest categories of -4.3% and -12.5%
(p<0.05). Democrats and independents were more likely to report activities as unsafe relative to
Republicans (p<0.001).

In multivariable models (Figure 5), a risk perception of unsafe across age groups decreased
significantly for going to the doctor (aOR=0.84 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.91)) and emergency room
(aOR=0.90 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.97)). Males were less likely to view going to the doctor, emergency
room, and returning to work as unsafe. Compared to White/Caucasian respondents,
Hispanic/Latino respondents were more likely to view going to the dentist or emergency room as
unsafe. Respondents with higher income were less likely to view these activities as unsafe;
trends across income groups were statistically significant for going to the doctor (aOR=0.84
(95% CI: 0.75, 0.94)), dentist (aOR=0.87 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.97)), and emergency room
(aOR=0.86 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.96)). Democrats and independents were more likely to view
activities as unsafe. There was a statistically significant interaction between age and race for
returning to work (p=0.039). The change in odds of perceiving returning to work as unsafe for
each 10-year increase in age was smallest for White/Caucasian respondents (aOR=1.13 (95% CI:
1.00, 1.27)) followed by Hispanic/Latino respondents (aOR=1.21 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.42)) and
Black/African American respondents (aOR=1.31 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.52)).

Differences between census regions in bivariate comparisons included higher proportions of
respondents considering activities as unsafe in the west vs. north (gathering of 10, gathering of
100, grocery store, church, and dentist) and south vs. north (dining indoor). Census region was
only predictive of risk perception in multivariable models for three activities (dining indoor:
Midwest vs. Northeast: aOR=0.66 (95% CI: 0.44, 0.98); visiting friends indoor: Midwest vs.
Northeast: aOR=0.68 (95% CI: 0.46, 1.00); and dining outdoor: South vs. Northeast aOR=1.44
(95% CI: 1.01, 2.06)).

DISCUSSION
We conducted a nationally representative survey of the U.S. population to understand risk
perceptions related to transmission of COVID-19 for social interaction and essential activities.
Overall, risk perceptions ranged widely, but were higher for activities which have been shown to
present increased risk for COVID-19 infection, particularly large gatherings and indoor
activities, suggesting effective information dissemination to the public risk regarding COVID-19
risk factors.13 Our results suggest that risk perceptions for age and race vary by the type of
activity. Men were more likely to view activities as safe compared to women, a similar finding to
a large survey in eight countries that found that women were more likely to perceive COVID-19
as a serious health problem and agree and comply with restrictive public policy interventions.14
Individuals with higher income in our survey were more likely to view activities as safe, perhaps
a result of facing fewer barriers to physical distancing.15 This could also reflect wealth
differentials in the experience of the pandemic, with increased COVID-19 transmission and case
volumes in low-income and minority populations.16 There were few differences by education.
Nearly universally, Democrats and independents were more likely than Republicans to view

activities as unsafe, potentially a reflection of the highly polarized U.S. climate in which
information about COVID-19 has been influenced by politics.

Previous studies about perceived health and economic risks associated with COVID-19 have
shown significant differences in risk perception by age, gender, education, and other
sociodemographic factors. A cross-sectional survey of U.S. adults conducted in March 2020
found lower risk perceptions, but higher prevalence of social distancing behaviors, among older
adults.17 Other studies have shown mixed results by age, with some reporting higher risk
perceptions for older adults18 and others lower.19 Our study showed that older respondents were
more likely to view social gatherings with many people and indoor activities as unsafe, yet more
likely to view activities such as going to the grocery store, participating in outdoor activities,
visiting elderly relatives, and visiting the doctor or emergency room as safe.

Studies have found lower perceived risk of COVID-19 infection and mortality among
Black/African American persons.17 Another study reported higher risk perceptions concerning
COVID-19 in Native American/Alaska Native and Asian groups relative to Black/African
American persons.18 Associations between respondent race/ethnicity and risk perceptions in our
study varied by activity; for some, such as attending gatherings, visiting grocery stores, and
attending church, there were no significant differences between groups. However, Black/African
American and, especially, Hispanic/Latino respondents were more likely to view several
activities, such as dining and visiting friends outdoor, as unsafe compared to White/Caucasian
respondents. Evidence suggests that Black and Hispanic groups have higher rates of infection
and mortality from COVID-19.20 This raises questions as to how structural racism and

socioeconomic and health disparities influence access to information and trust in health services
and authorities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Authors of a qualitative study in a
rural Latino community suggested that risk perceptions and concerns were linked to stress of loss
of employment.21 Responsibility rests with politicians, health authorities, and community leaders
to communicate evidence-based information in a manner that is honest and clear, easily
accessible, and culturally appropriate. Respondents in the study of perceptions in the rural Latino
community suggested, for example, a personalized approach to deliver information, by utilizing
email or text messages from nearby universities, their medical providers, or the local health
department.9,21

Perceived risks of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality have not necessarily aligned with actual
behaviors.17 While some studies have shown close correlation between perceived disease
severity and preventive behaviors, others studies have reported discrepancies between perceived
disease risk and adherence to prevention behaviors; this suggests that efforts to change risk
perceptions alone may be inappropriate and inadequate.22,23 Examining how sociodemographic
factors influence risk perceptions and behaviors could identify how inequities lead to increased
health risks in specific disadvantaged groups. Further, risk perceptions are likely to vary by
location, local COVID-19 incidence, and over time as more information becomes available,
factors such as ‘pandemic fatigue’ increase in prevalence, and more recent experiences exert a
stronger influence on how people view the pandemic. In the U.S., many published studies to date
were conducted during the early phases of the pandemic and focused on perceived risks of
infection or mortality and health behaviors, often without detailed information on
race/ethnicity.22,24 Our findings supplement this body of evidence by providing insights into

perceived risks for specific activities, sufficient sample size to explore associations by
race/ethnicity, and status of these perceptions during a later stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study had limitations. Selection bias associated with online surveys is well established, for
example, underrepresenting individuals who are older, without internet access, have lower
income, and have less formal education; this effect is difficult to quantify, in either direction or
magnitude, and may limit the generalizability of our results. However, the digital divide in
internet access has shrunk over time.25 Despite our large sample size, samples for strata of
important participant characteristics, including certain racial and ethnic minorities, were too
small to provide sufficient statistical power for our analyses; still, we had sufficient statistical
power to examine racial and ethnic differences between Black/African American,
Hispanic/Latino, and White/Caucasian groups, which very few studies have done. Our
questionnaire did not collect data on some characteristics that could affect risk perceptions,
including presence of underlying health conditions, type of employment, or whether the
respondent knew someone who had been infected with COVID-19.

CONCLUSION
We found significant variations in perceived risk of COVID-19 transmission for social
interaction and essential activities by age, gender, political affiliation, and race/ethnicity. These
findings suggest the importance of socioeconomic differences, health disparities, and structural
racism for efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic, including preventive behaviors, care
seeking for testing and treatment, and vaccination strategies. Further research should address
