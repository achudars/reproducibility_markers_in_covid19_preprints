Abstract
In this paper, a data-driven adaptive model for infection of COVID-19 is formulated to predict the confirmed total cases and active cases of an area over 4 weeks.
The parameter of the model is always updated based on daily observations. It
is found that the short term prediction of up to 3-4 weeks can be possible with
good accuracy. Detailed analysis of predicted value and the actual value of
confirmed total cases and active cases for India from 1st June to 3rd July is provided. Prediction over 7, 14, 21, 28 days has the accuracy about 0.73 % ± 1.97 %,
1.92 % ± 2.95 % , 4.34 % ± 3.91 %, 6.40 % ± 9.26 % of the actual value of confirmed total cases. Similarly, the 7, 14, 21, 28 days prediction has the accuracy
about 1.24 % ± 6.57 %, 3.04 % ± 10.00 %, 6.33 % ± 16.12 %, 10.20 % ± 24.14 %
of the actual value of confirmed active cases.

1. Introduction
The accurate predictions of the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)
are essential for planning and management of medical resources as well as lockdown strategy. A good prediction can avoid the shortage of critical medical re5

sources, economical loss associated with unnecessary lockdowns. Mathematical
modelling of infectious disease is generally performed by classifying the population into different compartments such as Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered,
Deceased. Various classical compartmental model reported in literature such as

SIR, SIS, SIRD, MSIR, SEIR, SEIS, MSEIR, MSEIRS. In order to model the
10

spreading of corona virus, various modification of the SIR model is proposed
in literature to include travel information [1], behavioural changes [2], various
intervention measures such as quarantine, strict social distancing, tracing and
isolation [3],[4], [5]. The model parameters are generally obtained for a specific
area as there can be huge variation in these parameters based on the government

15

policies, economical factors, adoption of social distancing measures. Prediction
for the Spread of COVID-19 for a specific country is developed such for India
[6, 7], China [8, 9, 10], South Korea-Italy [1], Iran [11],Korea [2], UK [12].
The estimation of spread of COVID-19 is made based on the assumption
on rate of growth of total cumulative cases following a certain pattern such as

20

gaussian [13], Verhulst equation [14], Lotka-Volterra dynamic model[15], Gompertz equation [16]. Estimation for Greece, Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Spain,
France, United Kingdom and United States is developed using Gaussian fitting
hypothesis based on the assumptions that evolutions of infected cases are of
Gaussian in nature [13]. In [17], estimations for COVID-19 is performed from

25

the fatality data for India under the assumption that the growth of infected
cases is exponential. In [15], Lotka-Volterra dynamic model is used to represent the growth rate and the model coefficients are derived using the Extended
Kalman filter techniques. In [18], Kalman filter-based techniques are used for
short term prediction model.

30

Time-invariant SIR model is not effective to predict the spread of corona
virus[19], considering the fact the large variation in the transmission dynamics. Also, it is difficult to fit a single model in different areas. So, Prediction
models are developed based on the time series analysis of the reported data,
where the model parameters c are estimated based on the previous observations

35

of the confirmed cases. Data-driven estimation methods using long short-term
memory (LSTM) and curve fitting is used for prediction of COVID-19 cases for
India in 30 days ahead [20]. Deceased cases of COVID-19 prediction for one
month is developed using a hybrid model using discrete wavelet decomposition
and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models [21]. In [22],

Autoregressive Integrated moving average model is used to predict the daily
number of COVID-9 cases up to 4 weeks. A mathematical model for prediction is developed using power series polynomials, where the coefficients of the
polynomials are obtained using the least square approximations.
Generally, it is observed that it is difficult to predict in the long term due

45

to the various uncertainties involved in the government decision-making process, social distancing measured followed by the people, availability of medical
resources. There is a time lag between the time of infection and the time of reporting of infection. So in short term prediction has less uncertainty compared
to the long term. A good general prediction model should use information about

50

the local state as less as possible.
In this paper, a short term prediction model is proposed based on the concept
of SIR model, where the parameters are updated continuously based on the
observations using weighted least square techniques. It is observed that the
spread of COVID-19, recovery and deceased rate can be approximated using

55

time-varying polynomials. The proposed model is validated by comparing the
true and actual value of June for India over the past predictions on time different
time windows such as 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, and 28 days. In case of 2 days
time window, It is found that error in prediction is within 6.40 % ± 9.26 % and
10.22 % ± 24.14 % for the prediction of total cases and active cases.

60

The rest of the paper is described as follows. The basic model is described
in Section 2. The model parameters are estimated in Section 3. The proposed
model is validated with COVID-19 statistics of India in Section 5. Expected
total and active cases for a month are predicted in Section 7. The prediction
results are discussed and concluded in Discussions and Conclusions Sections

65

respectively.

2. Model formulation
The total number of people who have been infected with the virus can be
classified as active, recovered or deceased cases. Few cases will be unreported

due to non-development of symptoms in the infected person. In Fig. 1, different
categories of different cases are shown.

We will consider the population as

Figure 1

70

susceptible (S), Infectious (I), and Removed (as shown in Fig. 2). Infectious
cases are divided into two categories, active cases(A) and active unreported
cases Aur . Similarly, recovered and deceased cases are also classified as those
who are reported and unreported cases. So, if N is the total population,then,
S + A + Aur + R + Rur + D + Dur = N
75

where, R, Rur are the reported recovered and unreported recovered cases respectively. Similarly, D, Dur are the reported and unreported deceased cases

3. Parameter estimation
The different parameter of the above model is estimated from the observed
85

data and dynamically adjusted using the daily observations. The active cases,
recovered and deceased from the reported cases are readily available; whereas,
the similar statistics for the unreported cases need to be estimated from random
antibody tests or serological tests. The confirmed active cases at each day are
obtained by the following equation
A=T −R−D

The rate of growth of total cases are obtained by taking derivative of the
95

variable T. T can be represented by different functions. In the case of India, it
is observed that T can be approximated using a fourth-order polynomial. Let
consider T be,
T = aT t4 + bT t3 + cT t2 + dT t + eT

(13)

The coefficients (aT , bT , cT , dT , eT ) of the function T is obtained using the
weighted least squares method by minimizing the error between the predicted
100

value and the observed daily values. The weighted least squares method is used
to provide more weightage on the recent values which in turn reflects the status
of lockdown, social distancing measured followed by the citizens. The following
cost function is used.

where yt is the observed cumulative total cases, T is expressed as T = Xζ,

and ζ are the coefficients of the polynomial. The weights (wt are selected from
the previous observations as 1(last 7 days), 0.9 (last 7-14 days), 0.8 (last 14-21
days), 0.5 (last 21-28 days) and 0.2 for further previous days.
The weights need to be selected properly for an area considering the lockdown/unlock period. The optimum values of ζ are calculated from the equation

Prediction values are updated based on the current observations. The data
of total cases recovered cases, and deceased cases from 14th March to 3rd
July for India is considered in the analysis. The data is collected from the
“https://api.covid19india.org/” website, where the daily COVID-19 updates of
various states and central government’s of India are recorded. The variation of

120

total cases, cumulative recovered cases, cumulative deceased cases, and corresponding active cases on daily basis are plotted in Figure 3a, Figure 3b, Figure
3c, Figure 3d respectively. Based on the observations till 3rd July, the prediction for the next 14 days is shown in Figure 4a and Figure 4b. The variation of
coefficients of the prediction curve of the total cases is tabulated in Table 1.

5. Model Validation
5.1. Total case prediction validation
The difference between the predicted value and the actual value is compared
to check the efficiency of the prediction algorithm. The predicted value on the
7th , 14th , 21th and 28th days back is considered for comparison. The predictions

130

from June 1st to July 3rd are considered for detailed analysis. The total case
prediction over a 7 days time window and the corresponding actual value is
shown in Table 2. In 26th June, the total cases prediction for 3rd July was
61130 and the actual value reported is 627065. So, the error in prediction is
2.54 % of the actual value of 627065. From Table 2, over the complete duration

135

of June 1st to July 3rd , the error between the actual and predicted value is
0.73 % ± 1.97 % of the actual value.
The predicted and actual values over a 14 days prediction window from
June 1st is tabulated in Table 3. As per Table 3 In case of prediction on 14
days duration, the error between the actual and the predicted value is found to

140

be 1.92 % ± 2.95 % of the actual value. Similary, prediction over 21 days and 28
days time window are tabulated in 4 and 5. The error between the predicted
value and the actual value over 21 days and 28 days is 4.34 % ± 3.91 % and
6.40 % ± 9.26 % of the actual value respectively.
The error in prediction from mid-April to July 3rd is plotted in Figure 5a. In

145

Figure5a, magenta points show the predicted value on 7 days back and the black
points are the predicted value on that day. At each day, the difference between
the black and magenta point is the difference in predicted and the actual value.
Similar plots for the prediction window of 14 days, 21 days, and 28 days are
plotted in the Figure 5b, Figure 5c, and Figure 5d respectively.

5.2. Active case prediction validation
The prediction results in case of active cases are compared with the actual
value of the active cases. The prediction values and the error in prediction of
active cases over 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, 28 days time duration are tabulated in
Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, and Table 9 respectively. The difference between the

155

predicted active case and the actual active case is found to be 1.24 % ± 6.57 %,
3.04 % ± 10.00 %, 6.33 % ± 16.12 %, 10.20 % ± 24.14 % for the prediction window of 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, 28 days respectively. The error in active case
prediction from mid April to July 3rd over different time window is plotted in
Figure 6a, Figure 6b, Figure 6c, and Figure 6d.

6. Discussions
The prediction is good in the smaller time window and error between the
actual and predicted case grows with larger time window prediction. The prediction error from June 1st to 3rd July is tabulated in Table 10. The prediction
is better in case of total cases compared to active cases. The reason behind the

165

higher value of error bound could be the frequent change in discharge policy by
the various state governments to adjust the growth of active patients in hospitals, which in turn affected the recovery rates. Also sometimes the deceased
cases are adjusted in a single day after detailed accounting which caused a high

jump in the deceased curve. Discharge policy by the governments and reporting
170

of deceased cases have caused the large variation in the actual value of active
cases over daily-basis. However, the reporting of the total case is smooth (Figure
3a); therefore, the bound of prediction error is also less.

7. Future prediction
Future predictions of total cases of India from the proposed algorithm over
175

different time windows are provided in Table 11, Table 12, Table 13, and Table
14. We will compare this table in future to further validate our algorithm.
Similar predictions for the active cases are tabulated in Table 15, Table 16,
Table 17, and Table 18. The prediction for next 28 days based on the upto date
observations are also included in Table 19 for reference.

8. Conclusions
In this paper, a data-driven prediction model is proposed to predict the total
cases and active cases of an area. The model can apply to an area. It is observed
that the error between the actual value and predicted value is 4.34 % ± 3.91 %
and 6.33 % ± 16.12 % for total cases and active cases respectively over the pre-

185

diction window of 21 days. We have also provided the prediction for the next
28 days from today for further validation of the proposed algorithm. The short
term prediction can be used in the allocation of scar medical resources among
different units, optimal lockdown planning.
