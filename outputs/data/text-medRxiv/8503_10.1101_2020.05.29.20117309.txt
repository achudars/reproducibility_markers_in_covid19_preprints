Abstract
Observational studies have suggested that having coronary artery disease increases the risk
of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) susceptibility and severity, but it remains unclear
if this association is causal. Inferring causation is critical to facilitate the development of
appropriate policies and/or individual decisions to reduce the incidence and burden of COVID19. We applied Two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis and found that genetically
predicted CAD was significantly associated with higher risk of COVID-19: the odds ratio was
1.29 (95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.49; P = 0.001) per unit higher log odds of having CAD.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. Specific risk factors
such as coronary artery disease (CAD)

1

have been reported to be related to COVID-19

susceptibility and severity through conventional observational studies. However, findings from
conventional observational studies are susceptible to selection bias, unmeasured confounding,
and reverse causation. With these limitations, it is very challenging to establish the causality of
reported associations in observational studies. Inferring causation is critical to facilitate the
development of appropriate policies and/or individual decisions to reduce the incidence and
burden of COVID-19. Here we show that the Mendelian Randomization (MR) design, similar
to a “genetic randomized controlled trial”, can be adopted to decipher the causality of the
association between CAD and COVID-19 2.

Methods
Genetic association datasets for COVID-19 susceptibility
For evaluation of associations with COVID-19 risk, we used summary statistics data of the most
recent version of genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses from The COVID-19 host
genetics initiative (released on May 17, 2020) 3. Detailed information on participating studies,
quality control and analyses has been provided on the COVID-19 host genetics initiative website
(https://www.covid19hg.org/results/). In brief, data from approximately 1,678 affected cases and
674,635 uninfected controls from studies of BioMe, FinnGen, Genes & Health, LifeLines Global
Screening Array, LifeLines CytoSNP, Netherlands Twin Register, Partners Healthcare Biobank,
and UK Biobank were used. The majority of the included subjects are Europeans, with a small

proportion of other ethnic groups. Only variants with imputation quality > 0.6 were retained.
Meta-analysis of individual studies was performed with inverse variance weighting.

Instrumental variables for CAD risk
We extracted genetic instruments for CAD risk based on a comprehensive GWAS of ~185,000
CAD cases and controls by Nikpay et al 4. In this study, a majority of the participants (77%)
were of European ancestry, and 19% were of Asian ancestry. We selected single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) associated at P<5×10-8 and only retained independent variants from each
other (r2 < 0.001). For correlated SNPs, the SNP with the lowest p-value was selected.

MR analysis
We applied the widely-used inverse variance weighted (IVW) method

5

to estimate the overall

causal association of CAD on COVID-19 susceptibility. To account for potential violations of
valid instrumental variable assumptions, we conducted sensitive analyses by applying several
methods that are robust to horizontal pleiotropy at the cost of reduced statistical power. These
include weighted median MR, MR-Egger regression, and MR-PRESSO test, and leave-one-out
analysis. Results are presented as odds ratios per unit higher log odds of CAD.

Results
For MR analysis, we used 38 independent variants as the instrument for CAD (data not shown)
with an estimated F-statistic of 62. Genetically predicted CAD was significantly associated with
higher risk of COVID-19. The odds ratio was 1.29 (95% confidence interval 1.11 to 1.49; P =
0.001) per unit higher log odds of having CAD (Figure 1). The association remained robust in

weighted median MR (Figure 1) and leave one out analyses (Figure 2). There was limited
evidence of horizontal pleiotropy and heterogeneity based on the MR-Egger intercept test
(P=0.83) and MR-PRESSO (P=0.26).

Discussion
In an MR analysis, we observed evidence supporting a potential causal association between CAD
and COVID-19. Such a link may be explained by changes of viscosity during febrile illnesses,
heightened coagulation systems, endothelial cell dysfunction, or proinflammatory effects 6. This
is the first study to characterize potential causality of suspected risk factors for COVID-19
susceptibility using a MR design. Limitations of the current study include 1) the overlap of
relatively small samples in both GWAS of CAD and COVID-19; and 2) mixed population
composition in both GWAS of CAD and COVID-19. Because BioMe only contributed a
relatively small sample size to the COVID-19 GWAS: 20 (1.1%) cases and 10,169 (1.5%)
controls, the potential influence of this on the MR estimate should be small. In both GWAS of
CAD and COVID-19, a majority of the subjects are Europeans. In summary, an MR study could
potentially avoid many biases and confounding issues existing in conventional observational
studies and thus help to identify causally related risk factors. Using MR design, we found
evidence that having CAD is associated with a higher risk of COVID-19. Therefore, particular
attention should be given to individuals with CAD during this pandemic and we expect that this
finding will facilitate appropriate policymaking and individual decisions to reduce COVID-19
burden.
