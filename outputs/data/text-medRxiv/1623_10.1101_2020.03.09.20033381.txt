Abstract
Background: During the first week of March, the surge of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) cases reached over 100 countries with more than 100,000 cases. Healthcare
authorities have already initiated awareness and preparedness activities beyond borders. A
poor understanding of the disease among healthcare workers (HCWs) may result in delayed
treatment and the rapid spread of infection. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge
and perceptions of HCWs about COVID-19.
Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about COVID19 during the first week of March 2020. A 23-item survey instrument was developed and
distributed randomly to HCWs using social media; it required 5 minutes to complete. A chisquare test was used to investigate the level of association among variables at the significance
level of p<0.05.
Results: Of 529 participants, a total of 453 HCWs completed the survey (response rate:
85.6%); 51.6% were males, 32.1% were aged 25-34 years, and most were doctors (30.2%)
and medical students (29.6%). Regarding COVID-19, most of the participants used social
media to obtain information (61%), and a significant proportion of HCWs had poor
knowledge of its transmission (61%) and symptom onset (63.6%) and showed positive
perceptions of COVID-19 prevention and control. Factors such as age and profession were
associated with inadequate knowledge and poor perception of COVID-19.
Conclusion: As the global threat of COVID-19 continues to emerge, it is critical to improve
the knowledge and perceptions of HCWs. Educational interventions are urgently needed to
reach HCWs beyond borders, and further studies are warranted.
Keywords: Coronavirus, outbreak, COVID-19, knowledge, perceptions, healthcare,

Introduction
Coronavirus (CoV) infections are emerging respiratory viruses and are known to cause illness
ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1]. CoV is a
zoonotic pathogen that can be transmitted via animal-to-human and human-to-human
interaction [2]. Multiple epidemic outbreaks occurred during 2002 (SARS), with ~800 deaths,
and 2012 (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome: MERS-CoV), with 860 deaths [2,3].
Approximately eight years after the MERS-CoV epidemic, the current outbreak of novel
coronavirus (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, has emerged as a global
outbreak and significant public health issue [4]. On 30 January 2020, the World Health
Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern
(PHEIC) [5]. Astonishingly, in the first week of March, a devastating number of new cases
were reported globally, and COVID-19 emerged as a pandemic. As of 12 March 2020, more
than 125,000 confirmed cases across 118 countries and more than 4600 deaths had been
reported [6].
COVID-19 is spread by human-to-human transmission through droplet, feco-oral, and direct
contact and has an incubation period of 2-14 days [6]. To date, no antiviral treatment or
vaccine has been explicitly recommended for COVID-19. Therefore, applying preventive
measures to control COVID-19 infection is the most critical intervention. Healthcare workers
(HCWs) are the primary sector in contact with patients and are an important source of
exposure to infected cases in healthcare settings; thus, HCWs are expected to be at high risk
of infection. By the end of January, the WHO and Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) had published recommendations for the prevention and control of COVID19 for HCWs [8,9]. The WHO also initiated several online training sessions and materials on
COVID-19 in various languages to strengthen preventive strategies, including raising
awareness and training HCWs in preparedness activities [10]. In several instances,

misunderstandings among HCWs have delayed controlling efforts to provide necessary
treatment [11], led to the rapid spread of infection in hospitals [12,13], and put patients' lives
at risk. In this regard, the COVID-19 epidemic offers a unique opportunity to investigate the
level of knowledge and perceptions of HCWs during this global health crisis. In addition, we
aim to explore the role of different information sources in shaping HCWs’ knowledge and
perceptions of COVID-19 during this peak period.
Methods
A prospective Web-based cross-sectional study was conducted using a survey instrument to
obtain responses from HCWs globally during the first week of March 2020.
A 23-item survey instrument was developed using WHO course materials on emerging
respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 [14]. The survey covered the domains of HCW
characteristics, awareness, information sources, knowledge and perceptions related to
COVID-19. The developed draft survey instrument was distributed to ten randomly selected
faculty members to assess its readability and validity before pretesting among 20 randomly
selected HCWs for clarity, relevance, and acceptability. Refinements were made as required
to facilitate better comprehension and to organize the questions before the final survey was
distributed to the study population.
Content of the study tool
The survey instrument comprised 23 closed-ended questions and took approximately 3
minutes to complete. The 23-item questionnaire was divided into three parts, including
participant characteristics (3 items), awareness of COVID-19 (2 items), source of information
(4 statements/4-point Likert scale), knowledge about symptoms of COVID-19-affected
patients (2 items), different modes of transmission (2 items), precautions and risk prevention
(3 items) and perceptions of COVID-19 (7 items/true or false questions) [Supplementary file

1]. Sufficient time was given to participants to read, comprehend, and answer all the
questions.
Ethical considerations
Confidentiality of the study participants' information was maintained throughout the study by
making the participants' information anonymous and asking the participants to provide honest
answers. Eligible HCWs’ participation in this survey was voluntary and was not
compensated. Informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to participation.
The study was performed following the Helsinki Declaration as revised in 2013. The study
was conducted following the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys
(CHERRIES) guidelines [15] [Supplementary file 2].
Data analysis
The obtained data were coded, validated, and analyzed using SPSS version 24 (IBM,
Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive analysis was applied to calculate the frequencies and
proportions. The chi-square test was used to investigate the level of association among
variables. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 529 HCWs participated, 453 of whom completed the study questionnaire (85.6%
response rate), including 234 (51.6%) men and 219 (48.3%) women; most of the participants
were below 44 years of age (82.4%). The majority of participants were doctors (n=137,
30.2%) or medical students (n=134, 29.6%) and were from Asia (68%). Table 1 shows the
sociodemographic characteristics of the participants. Almost all participants agreed that they
had heard about COVID-19 (97.8%), but only 44.1% of them had the opportunity to attend
lectures/discussions about COVID-19.

Source of information
When we asked about the participants’ source for reliable information about COVID-19, the
primary sources of information about COVID-19 were official government websites and
social media (Figure 1). Approximately 30% of the participants reported that they used news
media (TV/video, magazines, newspapers, and radio) and social media (Facebook, Twitter,
Whatsapp, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat) to obtain information about COVID-19.
Moreover, nearly 40% of the participants sometimes discussed COVID-19-related topics with
family and friends.
Knowledge about COVID-19
Table 2 shows the knowledge about COVID-19 among HCWs. We identified significant
knowledge gaps between doctors and other HCWs. For instance, approximately two-thirds of
doctors and half of allied health workers thought that the origin of COVID-19 was bats
(65.7% vs. 55.7%, p<0.05). A high majority of the HCWs (85.6%) agreed that maintaining
hand hygiene, covering the nose and mouth while coughing, and avoiding sick patients could
help to prevent COVID-19 transmission. A majority of the doctors agreed that COVID-19
could lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, and death (84%, p<0.05) and that supportive
care is the only treatment option that is currently available (83.2%, p<0.05). However, the
participants' knowledge about questions related to the mode of transmission and incubation
period of COVID-19 was poor (p<0.05).
Perceptions about COVID-19
Over 78% of the HCWs exhibited a positive perception of COVID-19. A high majority of the
HCWs knew that sick patients should share their recent travel history (92.7%), that flu
vaccination is not sufficient to prevent COVID-19 (90.7%), and that COVID-19 is not fatal
(88.5%). In addition, 87% felt that washing hands with soap and water could help to prevent

COVID-19 transmission; 84.3% knew that symptoms appear in 2-14 days; and 85.6% agreed
that all equipment used in wet markets should be cleaned every day. However, approximately
20% of HCWs were not clear about eating well-cooked meat during the outbreak [Table 3].
Items related to COVID-19-related perceptions among HCWs in the study were analyzed
separately using the chi-square test to examine their association with age and sex and across
different categories of people [Table 4].
Nearly 90% of the youngest participants (<25 years) and 92% of the doctors believed that the
symptoms of COVID-19 appeared as early as 2 to 14 days; the differences among the
respondent groups were statistically significant (p<0.05). Moreover, a significant proportion
of the doctors perceived eating well-cooked/handled meat to be safe (83.2%) (p<0.05).
Medical students were found to have the perception that flu vaccination is not sufficient to
prevent COVID-19 transmission (88%, p<0.05). A large number of allied health workers
incorrectly believed that it is not safe to eat well-processed meat during the COVID-19
outbreak (25.3%, p<0.05), that COVID-19 is fatal (21.5%), that there is a delay in symptoms
(19.8%), and that flu vaccination is sufficient (19.8%; p<0.05) compared with other
participants in the respective groups.
Discussion
Currently, COVID-19 is a global topic of discussion in the media and among the public,
especially among HCWs and patients. With the currently mounting COVID-19 transmission
raising tensions for everyone, including health officials and health systems, an important
question arises regarding how we manage information to help frontline HCWs in times of
public health crisis. For this reason, we investigated HCWs’ knowledge and perceptions of
the prevention and control of COVID-19 during a global epidemic.

Knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19 varied across different categories of HCWs. Our
study revealed that HCWs have insufficient knowledge about COVID-19 but showed positive
perceptions of the prevention of COVID-19 transmission. We also found that more than 33%
of the HCWs used official government websites as a primary source of information about
COVID-19. This indicates that the COVID-19-related updates posted online by official
government health authorities had positive implications for improving HCWs’ knowledge
levels. Relying on authentic sources is a key factor in believing transparent information about
the emerging COVID-19 infection and is essential for HCWs’ preparedness and response.
However, a finding of considerable concern is that 60% of HCWs used social media as a
source of information. Currently, the vast diversity of information available through the
Internet, including unverified malicious information, can spread quickly and can misguide
HCWs. In particular, health authorities and scientists have warned that widespread
misinformation about COVID-19 is a serious concern causing xenophobia worldwide [4,1619]. In this regard, HCWs should carefully evaluate COVID-19-related information and
should use scientific and authentic content as information sources.
The findings of this study suggest significant knowledge gaps between the amount of
information available about COVID-19 and the depth of knowledge among HCWs,
particularly about the mode of transmission and incubation period of COVID-19.
Additionally, many allied health workers had inaccurate knowledge that COVID-19 can be
treated with antivirals and that there is a vaccine available. This is unfortunate because the
surge of COVID-19 is globally devastating, and a large number of resources are provided by
healthcare authorities to educate HCWs and improve their knowledge about COVID-19.
Therefore, our findings were disappointing. Greater encouragement from health authorities is
needed to assimilate COVID-19-related knowledge among HCWs, including doctors.

Generally, most participants had a positive perception of the prevention and control of
COVID-19. However, discrepancies were identified in the perceptions of different categories
of HCWs. For instance, only half (52%) of the HCWs aged 45-65 years believed that the
symptoms of COVID-19 appeared as early as 2 to 14 days (p<0.05), and more than a quarter
of the medical students thought that eating meat during the outbreak was unsafe.
Approximately 20% of allied health workers believed that the flu vaccine is sufficient for
COVID-19 prevention. Finally, a vast majority of HCWs strongly agreed that maintaining
hygiene activities, reporting recent travel history when individuals are sick, and cleaning the
equipment used in wet markets are strongly recommended.
Limitations
We used WHO training material for the detection, prevention, response, and control of
COVID-19 to develop a validated questionnaire. The developed questionnaire was pilot
tested, and open-ended questions were limited to reduce information bias.
However, this study has some limitations that should be considered. This is a cross-sectional
study conducted online among HCWs during alarming cases reported globally in the first
week of March 2020. In addition, the data presented in this study are self-reported and partly
dependent on the participants' honesty and recall ability; thus, they may be subject to recall
bias. Finally, due to the four-week closure of higher educational institutions in the UAE
during the COVID-19 outbreak [16], the institutional review board was not approached.
Despite these limitations, our findings provide valuable information about the knowledge and
perceptions of HCWs during a peak period of COVID-19.
Conclusion
We identified a significant gap in the source of information, poor knowledge levels, and
discrepancies in perceptions of COVID-19 among our study participants. As the global threat
