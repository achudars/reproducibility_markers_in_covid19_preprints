Abstract. A person clinically diagnosed with COVID 19 can infect others for several days
before and after the onset of symptoms. At the epidemiological level, this information on how
infectious someone is lies embedded implicitly in the serial interval data. Other clinical
indicators of infectiousness based on the temporal kinetics of the viral shedding from the
nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum show the former decaying weeks sooner than the latter.
In this work, we attempt to provide a better quantitative estimate for the temporal
infectiousness profile using serial interval data from a combined 1251 individuals reported in
the literature. We show that the infectiousness profile which we calculate correlates well with
the viral shedding kinetics from nasopharyngeal swabs (r=0.97, p=0.00) and culturability
(r=0.83, p=0.01). The profile suggests that a 68.4% (95% CI: 67.0-69.7%) of the infections are
caused by infections before the symptoms appear, which is a much stronger pre-symptomatic
influence than what was predicted in the literature 44% (95% CI: 25-69%) using serial data
from 77 individuals.

Introduction.
The epidemiological parameter R-naught (R0) signifies how many new infections are caused
on average by an infected person. The R0 of COVID-19, for which some of the estimates have
been around 2.2 to 2.5,1,2 is a regularly monitored parameter to see if the spread of the
infection is contained. Going one step further into understanding the origins of R0, the spread
of infections depends on the physical contact between the infected and the susceptible
individuals, as well as on how long an infected person can infect others. A substantial amount
of infections of COVID-19 are transmitted through asymptomatic individuals,3 and their
infectiousness profiles are harder to track. Here we specifically focus on the data from the
symptomatic individuals to quantify their temporal infectiousness profile during the course
of their personal history of infection.
On the clinical side, the viral load of the SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharyngeal swab,
oropharyngeal swab, sputum, blood, urine and stool specimens of the COVID-19 patients can
be estimated using PCR with reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR). The cycle threshold (Ct) values
from RT-PCR are converted to RNA copy numbers in the sample and interpreted. Several
studies followed the temporal history of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding profiles in individuals for
many weeks after the onset of symtpoms.4-7 Some of these studies showed that peak viral

loads were higher for older individuals,6 whereas, others on a larger cohort showed no
significant differences in viral shedding with sex, age group, and the severity of the disease.7
Despite this apparent commonality across the patient demographics, the viral shedding
patterns from the different specimens show varying kinetics. While some reports show that
the viral load from the nasal swabs showed much faster decay within about a week after the
symptoms, compared to throat swabs,4 other reports found no discernible differences.8
Further, using sputum or stool analysis a significant number of patients are considered
positive for 3 to 4 weeks,8,9 but this period is about 1 to 2 weeks using a serum or swab
analysis.8,9 The primary reason for the apparent conflict comes from the fact that the RNA
load inferred from RT-PCR does not clarify what fraction of it is culturable or infectious.
To develop insights into the temporal infectiousness profile, which is important from the
public health point of view, one must know which data to focus on. In this sense, it is
important to juxtapose the clinically measured viral loads against epidemiological data to find
a consistent interpretation. The serial interval data, which is the time between the infectee
and the infected showing clinical symptoms, from 77 patient histories was used to infer the
infectiousness profile.7 The viral load data was not used to predict this serial interval, and no
direct comparison of the inferred infectiousness profile with the viral shedding was made.7
In this work, we combine the serial interval data of 1251 individuals from three different
works: 689 patients from Ma et al.,11 485 patients from Du et al.,10 and 77 patients from He
et al.7, to form a larger dataset that is likely to capture the underlying distribution better.
Results and Discussion.
Epidemiologically, serial interval is constructed from knowing the days when the symptoms
appear in the infectee and the infected. To estimate it, however, one should implicitly know
the incubation times (f) of both as well as the infectiousness or the transmissibility of the
infection (g) on the day infectee transmits to the infected (Supplementary Figure 1). Using
the data from 181 patients, the incubation time distribution was approximated12 a Weibull
distribution with parameters l=6.258, k=2.453 and other reports13 agree with this estimate.
We thus use the serial interval data from the 1251 individuals, and this incubation estimate
to solve the inverse problem of estimating the infectiousness profile, starting from the day an
individual is infected (Methods). The criterion used for accepting the estimate was that it
maximizes the R2 between the predicted and the observed serial interval. The best estimate
for the serial interval is shown in Figure 1, and the serial interval that was used for obtaining
this prediction was a Weibull distribution with a median of 3.1 days and is shown in Figure
2A. The peak of infectiousness is at 2 days after the infection, and it decreases after it. The
effect of the incubation period was averaged over, and the infectiousness profile relative to
the day of the onset of the symptoms was obtained (Figure 2B). The infectiousness profile
shows that a large part of the infectiousness (68.4%) finishes before the onset of the
symptoms. The 95% confidence interval on this estimate was obtained using bootstrapping
(Methods) as (67.0-69.7%). A sensitivity analysis performed with (l=5.2,k=2.0) and
(l=7.0,k=1.5) resulted in consistent estimates for the presymptomatic infections: 65.04%
(95% CI: 64.5-65.5%) and 69% (95% CI: 67.8-71.1%) respectively. The average value of the
pre-symptomatic infectiousness is much higher than the prediction in the literature 44% (95%
CI: 25-69%).7 The smaller variation is possibly from the larger data set we have used as well

as their use of the incubation data from a smaller set of 10 out of the 425 patients studied by
Li et al.1
In order to develop a comprehensive picture of the infectiousness, we compare the profile
we estimated to the two clinical laboratory markers: the viral shedding kinetics and
culturability. Such relations have been developed earlier for influenza14 and HIN1.15,16 Figure
3 shows that the infectiousness profile we estimate in Figure 2B has similar kinetics to the
viral shedding kinetics from the nasopharyngeal swab samples. Only the data from the
longitudinal studies on individuals was used for this comparison. The chance of obtaining a
positive culture decreases with time and its kinetics is also consistent with the viral shedding
and infectiousness (Figure 3). In addition to this kinetics, we also study the correlations
between the infectiousness we estimate and the average viral shedding (Figure 4A) and the
chance of obtaining a positive culture (Figure 4B) that was calculated by combining data from
two different works.8,17 Both these correlations are very strong, with correlation coefficients
0.83 and 0.97, respectively and high significance.
Clearly, the kinetics of the samples from sputum show a much slower decay (Supplementary
Figure 2). Which means that if one uses the sputum samples as a criterion for understanding
the infectiousness, the Ct threshold will be much higher, comparing both the observed
culturability and the infectiousness we estimate.
Conclusions.
By using combined serial interval data from several sources, we could estimate the temporal
infectiousness profile which suggests with high confidence that about 68% of the infections
are likely to be caused before the onset of symptoms. The kinetics of the viral shedding,
culturability and the infectiousness were all found to be consistent which suggests the
possibility of using them as surrogates for one another.
Methods.
Infectiousness estimation.
The serial interval is illustrated in Supplementary Figure 1. The serial interval of (t + t2- t1)
days arises from infectiousness at t, and the incubation times t1, t2 of the infectee and the
infected. The serial interval distribution h(t) is given as
h(t) = ∫∫ f(t1). f(t2). g(t + t1- t2) dt1 dt2
where f(t) is the incubation distribution and g(t) is the infectiousness profile t days after the
infectee gets infected. f(t) and g(t) were both assumed to follow Weibull distributions. The
parameters l=6.258, k=2.453 were used for f(t). A 10 x 10 grid was used to scan through the
parameters l, k for g(t). Corresponding to each choice of the parameters, the predicted serial
interval was plotted against the observed serial interval data. The R2 of the linear regression
between the predictions and the observations was maximized and the l and k were
identified.
Bootstrapping.
To estimate the confidence intervals, bootstrapping with 1,000 replicates was used. From the
serial interval data of 1251 individuals, 1000 independent sample sets each of size 300 were

randomly selected by replacing the numbers each time. The calculations for infectiousness
estimation were repeated as mentioned above with a 10 x 10 grid for scanning over l and k.
Using the best estimates for the serial interval in each replicate, the distribution of the
infectiousness before symptoms was obtained. This distribution was used to obtain the 95%
confidence interval.

assuming an incubation period from Lauer et al.16 The serial interval predicted using this
