Summary

23

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a severe shortage of personal

24

protective equipment (PPE), especially N95 respirators. Efficient, effective and

25

economically feasible methods for large-scale PPE decontamination are urgently

26

needed. Aims: (1) to develop protocols for effectively decontaminating PPE using

27

vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP); (2) to develop novel approaches that decrease set

28

up and take down time while also increasing decontamination capacity (3) to test

29

decontamination efficiency for N95 respirators heavily contaminated by makeup or

30

moisturizers. Methods: We converted a decommissioned Biosafety Level 3 laboratory

31

into a facility that could be used to decontaminate N95 respirators. N95 respirators were

32

hung on metal racks, stacked in piles, placed in paper bags or covered with makeup or

33

moisturizer. A VHP® VICTORYTM unit from STERIS was used to inject VHP into the

34

facility. Biological and chemical indicators were used to validate the decontamination

35

process. Findings: N95 respirators individually hung on metal racks were successfully

36

decontaminated using VHP. N95 respirators were also successfully decontaminated

37

when placed in closed paper bags or if stacked in piles of up to six. Stacking reduced

38

the time needed to arrange N95 respirators for decontamination by approximately two-

39

thirds while almost tripling facility capacity. Makeup and moisturizer creams did not

40

interfere with the decontamination process. Conclusions: Respirator stacking can

41

reduce the hands-on time and increase decontamination capacity. When

42

personalization is needed, respirators can be decontaminated in labeled paper bags.

43

Make up or moisturizers do not appear to interfere with VHP decontamination.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic, has infected

47

almost 17 million people and caused more than 680,000 deaths worldwide through July

48

2020 [1]. Healthcare workers (HCWs) can be exposed to high viral loads of SARS-CoV2

49

by inhaling droplets or aerosolized viral particles originating from patients under their

50

care [2]. SARS-Cov-2 can survive in aerosols for more than 3 hours and the virus can

51

be efficiently transmitted in this form [3,4]. In China, more than 3,000 HCWs were

52

infected during the Covid-19 pandemic, and more than 10,600 workers were infected in

53

Italy [5,6]. Shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) can increase the risk of

54

infection [2,7] and there is an increasing need to expand the manufacturing capability of

55

PPE and to improve the supply chain [8]. Decontamination and reuse of PPE provides

56

another means of increasing PPE availability. Several studies have validated the use of

57

vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) to decontaminate N95 respirators of bacteria,

58

mycobacteria, viruses and importantly, SARS-CoV-2 [9,10]. An advantage of using VHP

59

as a decontaminant is that it is degraded into oxygen and water eliminating concerns of

60

toxic byproducts.

61

Here, we provide a detailed protocol for using VHP to effectively decontaminate

62

N95 respirators and demonstrate that this protocol is effective even with N95 respirators

63

that are heavily covered with makeup and moisturizers as might occur during day to day

64

activities. Further, we describe and validate simple but novel modifications to this

65

approach that can substantially increase the number of N95 respirators that can be

66

decontaminated in a typical facility while simultaneously improving workflow and

67

dramatically saving time and personnel efforts.

Methods

69

Operation Design: The Medical Science Building (MSB) located in the Newark

70

campus of Rutgers University, holds a decommissioned Biosafety Level Three (BSL3)

71

facility with a dedicated exhaust system making it possible to isolate and regulate

72

airflow in this facility. This facility was also designed to maintain each room under

73

negative pressure, in accordance with BSL3 design standards. These features enabled

74

us to convert this facility into one that can be easily used to decontaminate N95

75

respirators. The facility has a 2,400 ft3 common room and three 1,200 ft3 modules. The

76

common room was repurposed for N95 respirator decontamination and the three

77

modules were partially sealed to contain VHP leakage. N95 respirators were hung on

78

stainless racks using fifty metal hooks per shelf with five shelves per rack (Figure 1a).

79

The hooks were secured to the racks using pliers. In other experiments N95 respirators

80

were positioned in piles (Figures 1b and 1c) or inside paper bags (Figure 1d). To

81

optimize exposure to VHP, N95 respirators were hung so that they did not touch each

82

other. Seventeen metal racks were located along the walls of the common room leaving

83

space available for additional racks if needed. Based on this design, the capacity for this

84

operation was 4,250 N95 respirators per run using only the common room and the total

85

capacity could be increased to 7,250 N95 respirators per run if racks were also located

86

in the three modules.

87

Decontamination protocol: SARS CoV2 can survive prolonged periods on solid

88

surfaces, and it is eliminated from cardboard after 24 hours [4]. As a result, multiple

89

groups have recommended letting disposable N95 respirators ‘rest’ for at least 24 hours

90

between uses [11]. All N95 respirators were kept in sealed boxes in a secure area for at

91

least 48 hours before being hung for decontamination. Personnel wore PPE consisting

92

of disposable Tyvek with booties and hoods, cover shoes, double gloves, aprons, P100

93

respirators and safety glasses to enter the facility and hang N95 respirators. It took a

94

single individual an average of 30 minutes to hang 250 N95 respirators on one of our

95

decontamination racks.

96

N95 respirators were then decontaminated with VHP using a VHP® VICTORYTM

97

unit (Steris Life Sciences, Mentor, OH) filled with a 35% aqueous hydrogen peroxide

98

solution (Vaprox@). The VICTORYTM unit uses heat to vaporize hydrogen peroxide while

99

maintaining the concentration below the dew point to keep hydrogen peroxide in a

100

gaseous state thereby avoiding condensation. The concentration of VHP in the room

101

was monitored using a VHP TS1000 Tri-Scale Sensor. If needed, a VHP AR12000

102

Aerator could be used to remove VHP from the room. The VICTORYTM unit was

103

remotely controlled by a computer using SmartPhaseTM software technology that

104

automatically adjusted VHP injection rates based on room temperature, relative

105

humidity, and VHP concentration. The program automatically calculated bioburden

106

reduction and VHP saturation in real-time to maintain the concentration of VHP close to

107

the setting point and to maintain the vapor state, respectfully.

108

Four fans were positioned in different areas of the common room to ensure a

109

uniform distribution of VHP. Since VHP is more dense than air, fans were oriented to

110

blow air toward the ceiling to facilitate the dispersion of VHP in the higher regions. The

111

locations of the fans were marked on the ground using masking tape to ensure that they

112

maintained positions during each decontamination run.

113

Decontamination was performed in four phases: conditioning, gassing, gassing-

114

dwell and aeration. Based on the temperature, humidity and volume of the facility, the

115

condition and gassing phases lasted approximately 90 minutes. During these phases,

116

VHP was injected at a rate between 5 to 40 g/min to keep a target concentration of 400

117

ppm. The actual concentration varied between 400 and 800 ppm. The concentration of

118

VHP was remotely monitored using the VNC Viewer software on a portable computer.

119

The dwelling phase was maintained for 3 hours with no additional VHP injected during

120

this time. Supply and exhaust fans were switched back on at the end of the dwelling

121

phase to facilitate the removal of the VHP. The aeriation phase was kept overnight for

122

approximately 15-18 hours. The following morning, the residual concentration of VHP in

123

the facility was measured using a Dräger x-Am 5100 (Dräger, Telford, PA) to ensure

124

that the VHP concentration was below the safe level of 1 ppm.

125

Five validation runs were conducted on approximately 1,250 N95 respirators of

126

different models. A rack with 250 control N95 respirators was decontaminated with

127

every cycle to determine the effect of multiple sterilization cycles on the integrity of the

128

N95 respirators. Biological indicators (BIs) (Spordex® VHP Biological Indicator Discs,

129

Steris Life Sciences, Mentor, OH) and chemical indicators (CIs) (Steraffin® VHP Type 4

130

Process Indicator, Steris Life Sciences, Mentor, OH) were positioned in different parts of

131

the room. Some indicators were also placed within closed control N95 respirators to

132

validate that the all areas were exposed to the correct concentration of VHP. After

133

decontamination, CIs were inspected visually to observe if it had changed from violet to

134

yellow indicating that VHP had successfully contacted the area. BIs containing

135

Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores were aseptically transferred into Tryptic Soy

Broth and incubated for 7 days at 37 C. Results were read at 24 hours and 7 days post

137

inoculation. Positive and negative controls were included in every run to represent BI

138

viability and media sterility.

139

N95 respirators: Respirator models 3M 9210, 3M 1870, 3M 1870+, 3M 1860S,

140

and 3M 1860 (3M, St. Paul, MN; Cardinal Health, Dublin, OH, Gerson, Middleboro, MA);

141

Cardinal Health S and M/L (Cardinal Health, Dublin, OH), Gerson 2130 and Gerson

142

1730; (Gerson, Middleboro, MA), Halyard Fluidshield 46727 and 46827; (O&M Halyard,

143

Inc., Alpharetta, GA) were tested in this study. These are the models most frequently

144

used by HCWs at University Hospital (UH, Newark NJ).

145

Quality control: At the end of each decontamination cycle, the N95 respirators

146

were inspected to verify that there was no physical damage or loss of integrity. N95

147

respirators in the control rack underwent twelve decontamination cycles and were

148

inspected after each run to determine if there was loss in respirator integrity, the results

149

of the respirator integrity checks are described in a separate study submitted at bioRxiv

150

(Levine et al.).

151

Improving workflow using N95 respirator piles. Trials were conducted to

152

identify ways to increase the number of N95 respirators that could be decontaminated at

153

the same time in our facility by replacing the tedious N95 respirator hanging process

154

with a faster method. For this purpose, five N95 models (Table I) were piled in stacks of

155

four, six, eight, ten and twelve units (Figure 1b). BIs and CIs were inserted into the

156

middle of each pile to determine which pile configuration remained consistent with full

157

N95 respirator decontamination.

158

Improving workflow by decontaminating N95 respirators in paper bags.

159

HCWs at UH collected their N95 respirators in paper bags. Each bag was labelled with

160

the user’s name and contained either one or two N95 respirators. When the N95

161

respirators were received at the decontamination site, they were removed from the bag

162

and hung on metal racks. This made it difficult to return N95 respirators to their original

163

owners. Decontaminating N95 respirators without removing them from the paper bags

164

could improve workflow and simplify the process needed to return N95 respirators to

165

their original users. To test the safety of this procedure modification, a sample of five

166

N95 respirators (Halyard Fluidshield 46727/46827) were put inside five different paper

167

bags (Figure 1d), the N95 respirators were closed with tape to mimic a worst case

168

scenario where a N95 respirator was completely folded, and the bag was closed (in a

169

normal operation the bags would be left open to facilitate the dispersion of VHP). BIs

170

and CIs were inserted inside closed N95 respirators within the paper bags. The trial was

171

repeated in five different decontamination runs.

172

Effect of makeup and moisturizer creams on decontamination efficacy.

173

Several N95 respirators received from UH for decontamination had extensive traces of

174

makeup or moisturizer creams. To determine if a layer of makeup or moisturizer cream

175

could interfere with the decontamination process, N95 respirators (Halyard Fluidshield

176

46727/46827) were covered with makeup (Maybelline Fit Me Matte + Poreless

177

Foundation, L’Oreal, New York, NY), lip stick (Maybelline Lipstick, L’Oreal, New York,

178

NY), or moisturizer cream (Oil Free Moisturizer, Beauty 360, CVS Woonsocket, RI) or a

179

combination of makeup and moisturizer cream, BIs and CIs were placed inside the N95

180

respirator, and the N95 respirator was then folded and closed using tape. Halyard

181

Fluidshield (model 46727/46827) N95 respirators were selected for this study since they

182

can be folded. The trial was repeated in five different decontamination runs.

183

Results

184

Facility Decontamination: An example of the decontamination cycle is reported

185

in the supplement Figure S2. On average, it took 90 minutes for VHP concentrations to

186

reach a level reported to reduce microorganisms by 12-logs based on calculations from

187

the SmartPhaseTM software. The concentration of VHP fell below 1 ppm approximately

188

5 to 6 hours after turning on supply and exhaust fans. Visual inspection of CIs after the

189

decontamination cycle and the BIs 7 days post inoculation, validated successful

190

decontamination at all locations within the facility. Additionally, CIs located inside control

191

N95 respirators turned yellow and all BIs were negative for growth after 7 days post

192

inoculation, indicating that all surfaces of the N95 respirators were decontaminated

193

even when folded.

194

Improving workflow using N95 respirator piles. One to four piles containing

195

stacks of four, six, eight, ten or twelve N95 respirators per pile were decontaminated for

196

each of five N95 respirator models (Table I). The results of the BIs and CIs that had

197

been inserted into the middle of the piles were used to determine whether effective

198

decontamination had occurred. Our results showed that all N95 respirator models were

199

decontaminated when stacked in piles of eight or fewer. However, the 3M 1860S (TC-

200

84A-0006) N95 respirators were not decontaminated when piled in stacks of ten or

201

twelve. All other N95 respirator models were decontaminated even when piled in stacks

202

of ten or twelve. Four additional decontamination experiments were then performed on

203

piles of four and six N95 respirators using all five N95 respirator models. In these follow

204

up experiments, both four and six N95 respirator piles and all five models were

205

decontaminated according to both the BI and CI indicators.

206

On each shelf we were able to place 24 piles of six N95 respirators (Figure 1c),

207

for a total of 720 units per rack. When we hung N95 respirators, we were able to place

208

50 units per shelf, for a total of 250 per rack. In our operation we used 17 racks. Based

209

on this design, we would have been able to increase our decontamination capacity from

210

4,250 to 12,240 units per run when N95 respirators were arranged in piles instead of

211

hanging them.

212

Placing the N95 respirators in piles also saved time in the setting up and taking

213

down process. It took approximately 8 minutes to fill a rack with piles of N95 respirators,

214

compared to 30 minutes when they were hung. Based on our operation design, it took in

215

total 2 hours and 20 minutes to arrange the N95 respirators in the 17 racks compared to

216

8 hours and 30 minutes when they were hung. It took a similar time to remove the N95

217

respirators from the shelves after the decontamination.

218

N95 respirators in paper bags. Three replicates of N95 respirators folded up

219

inside paper bags were tested in five separate experiments. BIs and CIs inserted in

folded and closed N95 respirators inside the closed paper bags were used to test for

221

decontamination. Our results showed that effective decontamination for all N95

229

Discussion

230

We have described how to decontaminate thousands of N95 respirators using a

231

relatively small 2,400 ft3 facility. The entire decontamination process, from hanging the

232

N95 respirators to the end of the sterilization cycle, took an entire day using a

233

conventional mask hanging protocol. We hung N95 respirators as the first task of the

234

morning and then started the sterilization cycle later in the morning. The aeration cycle

235

to remove VHP from the decontamination facility was then started in the late afternoon,

236

and we went inside the facility the following morning when the VHP concentration was

237

close to 0 ppm. Toward the end of the project, we hung N95 respirators the day before

238

running a decontamination cycle to facilitate the process. Since the N95 respirators

239

were kept in a BSL3 facility that is under negative pressure and locked, there was no

240

risk of exposure to people outside the facility. When we ran decontamination cycles

241

daily, we observed that the concentration of VHP would not fall below 1 ppm on the

242

following day. It is possible that the walls, ceiling and floors of the facility became

243

saturated with VHP when the decontamination cycle was run daily since the situation

244

did not change even when there were less than one hundred N95 respirators in the

245

facility. Thus, we recommend every other day sterilization in facilities where this

246

problem occurs. Some HCWs wear makeup or use moisturizer creams that can leave

247

traces on N95 respirators, even ones destined for decontamination and reuse. Here we

248

demonstrated that makeup or moisturizer creams are unlikely to interfere with the

249

decontamination process when VHP is used. Our study describes a more efficient way

250

to perform the decontamination process. We have also confirmed that most but not all

251

models of N95 respirators will continue to fit and function properly for at least six

252

decontamination cycles in a separate publication submitted at bioRxiv (Levine et al.).

253

This has also been confirmed by others using a single N95 respirator model [12].

254

Two of the goals of our study were to find ways simplify the process of preparing

255

N95 respirators for decontamination and to increase the overall number of N95

256

respirators that could be decontaminated in a single day. We tested the possibility of

257

piling N95 respirators on top of each other in small stacks instead of hanging them. In

258

these trials, we tested respirators from several brands to determine if this process could

259

be valid for different N95 respirator models. For one model, piles of ten or twelve N95

260

respirators were not always completely decontaminated. However, we observed in

261

repeated tests that all respirator models could be decontaminated in piles of four, six or

262

eight. Based on these results, it seems likely that N95 respirators can be consistently

263

decontaminated in pile sizes of up to six units, but each facility should validate this

264

process.

265

Piling N95 respirators will speed up the preparation process and significantly

266

increase the capacity of a decontamination facility. It took 30 minutes for a single

267

individual to hang 250 N95 respirators on one rack. In contrast, it took 8 minutes to pile

268

the same number of N95 respirators on a rack. This means that it would take 8.5 hours

269

for a single individual to hang 4,250 N95 respirators compared 2.5 hours if N95

270

respirators were piled as we have described. Furthermore, piles take up substantially

271

less space than hung N95 respirators. It follows that using a six-stack piling strategy

272

would increase the capacity of a facility such as ours from 4,250 to 12,240 units. Piling

racks. Hooks can tear the PPE of personal hanging respirators; thus, eliminating hooks

275

would improve the overall safety of the procedure.

276

We also looked at ways to improve the sorting process of N95 respirators after

277

decontamination. Our experience is that HCWs prefer to receive their own originally

278

worn N95 respirators put in paper bags marked with their name. For this reason, we

279

decontaminated N95 respirators kept in paper bags, but we replicated the worse

280

possible scenario sealing the bags and inserting CIs and BIs inside N95 respirators that

281

were closed. We found that it is possible to decontaminate N95 respirators under the

282

conditions tested. Leaving N95 respirators in paper bags would also speed up and

283

facilitate the sorting of N95 respirators after the decontamination process and will not

284

significantly decrease the capacity of the facility. We estimated that we could hang 50

285

N95 respirators per shelf or put up to 20 paper bags containing one or two N95

286

respirator per shelf.

287

Conclusion

288

In this project, we were able to design an inexpensive reproducible operation for

289

the decontamination of N95 respirators using VHP. Some advantages of this operation

290

were that it required a small facility and that the N95 respirator capacity could be easily

291

increased by our modified procedures. We also reported possible ways to speed up the

292

process of preparing N95 respirators for decontamination by arranging them in piles of

293

four or six instead on hanging. Finally, we validated the potential to keep N95

294

respirators as they were received, in paper bags, during the decontamination process
