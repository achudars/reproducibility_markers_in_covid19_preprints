SUMMARY
To explore whether the expression levels of viral-entry associated genes might contribute
to the milder symptoms in children, we analyzed the expression of these genes in both
children and adults’ lung tissues by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and
immunohistochemistry (IHC). Both scRNA-seq and IHC analyses showed comparable
levels of the key genes for SARS-CoV-2 entry in children and adults, including ACE2,
TMPRSS2 and FURIN, suggesting that instead of lower virus intrusion rate, other
factors are more likely to be the key reasons for the milder symptoms of SARS-CoV-2
infected children.

INTRODUCTION
Since December 2019, a novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly1 and posed a severe threat to global public
health2. As of 31 August 2020, this disease, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), had
cumulatively caused nearly 25 million confirmed cases and around 800,000 deaths globally,
indicating SARS-CoV-2 as a highly contagious virus3.
Accumulating data have suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is relatively
rare and less severe compared to that in adults4-6. Meanwhile, recent reports highlight a clinical
syndrome in children related to SARS-CoV-2 which is multisystem inflammatory syndrome in
children (MIS-C) comprising multiorgan dysfunction and systemic inflammation7. However, a
recent study pointed out that children are just as likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 as adults
when exposed to similar environment. Among all children under 10 who had close contact with
confirmed cases, the infection rate was 7.4%, which is comparable to that of the whole population
average (7.9%)8. The latest guidelines also state that all individuals, including children, are
generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 9. In the meantime, the low incidence of critical illness in
children has been reported repeatedly and accepted widely while the underlying mechanism
remains to be elucidated.
Currently there are two major speculations regarding why children display milder symptoms
during the infection: relatively lower expression of viral-entry associated genes compared to adults

and immune-related factors10. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a type I membrane
protein expressed in various types of organs, has been proven to be the key receptor of
SARS-CoV-2 for cellular entry via its interaction with the spike (S) protein11 of the virus, which is
cleaved by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)12. But it is worth noting that
simultaneously blocking the activity of TMPRSS2 and the cysteine proteases CATHEPSIN B/L
cannot completely inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, suggesting the possible involvement
of additional proteases in the priming of SARS-CoV-212. A FURIN cleavage site has been
identified at S1/S2 boundary in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein13, which is suggested to be potentially
cleaved by FURIN14 as an additional possible mechanism for the priming of the virus. Therefore,
in the present study, the expression levels of viral-entry associated genes (i.e., ACE2, TMPRSS2
and FURIN) in both children and adults’ lung tissues were analyzed by single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to explore whether the expression
levels of these genes might contribute to the milder symptoms in children.

RESULTS
Comparable expression of the key genes for SARS-Cov-2 entry by scRNA-seq
Non-affected lung tissues from ten children with congenital heart disease combined with lung
diseases requiring lobectomies were collected (Fig. 1A, Supplementary Table S1), and the
transcriptome of totally 125,955 cells were analyzed via scRNA-seq. The cells were clustered and
annotated into 15 cell types with major cell types known to exist in lung identified (Fig. 1B).
When compared to a public dataset (GSE122960) of eight adult lung donors (totally 42,843
cells)15, although fewer cells were obtained from children’s lung tissues, the cell subtypes in
children were the same as those in adults (Fig. 1B). Consistent with previous analyses16,17, AT2
cells (and proliferating AT2 cells) were the major cell type expressing ACE2. Other
lung/bronchiolar epithelial cells, such as club cells in adults and AT1 cells in children also showed
notable expression of ACE2. Similarly, the AT2, AT1 and club cells were the major cell types with
relatively high expression of TMPRSS2 in both adults and children. The expression pattern of
FURIN, however, slightly differed from ACE2 and TMPRSS2, with vascular EC cells and
monocyte being the major expressing cell types in adults but AT1 and AT2 cells in children (Fig.
1D). In general, no significant changes were observed in the expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2

and FURIN between adults and children, although the percentage of cells expressing TMPRSS2
and FURIN were higher in adults than children (Fig. 1C).
Comparable expression of the key genes for SARS-Cov-2 entry by IHC
To further verify the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and FURIN at the protein level, IHC
was performed in the lung biopsy specimens from children and adults in two independent cohorts
(Supplementary Table S2). Consistent with the scRNA-seq analysis, the overall expression levels
of ACE2 in children and adults were comparable in both cohorts, with a very small portion of the
lung cells expressing ACE2. However, TMPRSS2 and FURIN both showed higher levels in
children compared to adults, although the former did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 2A and
2B). The underlying reasons for the partial discrepancy between the results from scRNA-seq and
IHC

could

be

the

complicated

processes

of

transcription

including

post-transcriptional, translational and degradation regulations16. Meanwhile, the semi-quantitative
characteristics of IHC and its limitation in identifying cell types may also contribute to such
discrepancies, which further emphasize the necessity to combine these methods for an impartial
interpretation of the results. Besides, in accordance with the previous report, the staining patterns
of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and FURIN were consistent in the same types of tissue regardless of the
pathological condition of the patient18.

DISCUSSION
Different coronaviruses employ distinct domains within the S1 subunit of S protein to
recognize unique entry receptors. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 interact directly with ACE2 via S
domain B to enter the target cells13,19, while MERS-CoV utilizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) as
its cellular receptor via S domain A20. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV use TMPRSS2 and
CATHEPSIN B/L during the priming process. In addition, MERS-CoV S protein can be activated
by proprotein convertases and FURIN depending on the host cell and tissue types21,22. Although
the S proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share 76% sequence identity23, SARS-CoV-2 S
protein harbors a FURIN cleavage site that is absent in SARS-CoV, suggesting its potential
cleavage by FURIN14.
ACE2 is enriched in the heart, kidney and testis, and is also broadly distributed in the lung,
liver, intestine and brain24. It is well accepted that the lung is the primary target organ of

SARS-CoV-2 infection25,26. An analysis of the scRNA-seq data obtained from 43,134 human lung
cells showed that ACE2 was expressed in 0.64 % of all cells in lungs and 83% of the ACE2
expression was found in AT2 cells, indicating that AT2 is the primary target of SARS-CoV-2 in the
lungs27, which is consistent with our results. Although children of all ages are susceptible to
COVID-19, accumulating clinical data indicated better clinical outcomes in children compared to
adults. However, the expression and the activity of ACE2 during the development of children and
teenagers are largely unclear25,28. Data from animal models remain controversial so far. ACE2
expression in the lungs was reported to decrease during aging in a study performed in aged rats29
and another study using sheep as model revealed significantly lower expression of ACE2 in the
neonatal sheep comparing to that in the adult ones30. It has also been shown that higher expression
of ACE2 was observed in the pulmonary alveolar epithelial barrier, cardiomyocytes, and vascular
endothelial cells in the aged old non-human primates31.
The present study showed comparable expression levels of ACE2, as well as other factors
involved in SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry, in children and adults, suggesting that the expression
level of viral-entry associated genes is unlikely to be the key reason for milder symptoms in
children. Instead, other factors such as unique features in children immunity may play a more
important role. Children have a distinct immune profile during infections because their immune
system is still under development. It has been shown that compared to adults, decreased
mononuclear and polymorphonuclear chemotaxis is found in children and such decrease remains
significant until the age of 1632. In the meantime, frequent exposure to a plethora of other
pathogens, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), would repeatedly challenge the innate
immunity including the age dependent maturation of the interferon response33-36, possibly leading
to an enhanced innate immune function which is one feature of trained immunity10,37. Taken
together, unique features in children immunity could be a possible explanation for the milder
symptoms and lower mortality rate in children SARS-CoV-2 infections.
In summary, the present study, for the first time, described the features of children’s lungs by
scRNA-seq. Both scRNA-seq and IHC analyses showed comparable, if not higher, expression of
the key genes for SARS-Cov-2 entry, including ACE2, TMPRSS2 and FURIN, suggesting that
instead of lower virus intrusion rate, other factors are more likely to be the key reasons for the
milder symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infected children, which awaits further investigation.

the patient number indicated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human subjects and specimens
Normal lung tissues from children and adults undergoing biopsies or surgeries for various reasons
were collected for scRNA-seq and IHC (Supplementary Table 1). The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board and the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Children’s Medical Center
(SCMCIRB-K2020034), and written informed consent was obtained from (the parents of) each
patient.
Tissue dissociation and single cell suspension preparation
Fresh tissue samples were collected and immediately stored in the GEXSCOPETM Tissue
Preservation Solution (Singleron Biotechnologies) at 4 °C. Prior to tissue dissociation, the
specimens were washed with Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) for three times and minced
into 1–2 mm pieces. The tissue pieces were digested in 2 ml GEXSCOPE Tissue Dissociation
Solution (Singleron Biotechnologies) at 37 °C for 15 min in a 15 ml centrifuge tube with
continuous agitation. After digestion, a 40-micron sterile strainer (Corning) was used to separate
cells from cell debris and other impurities. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 1000 rpm, 4 °C
for 5 min and the cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml PBS (HyClone). To remove red blood
cells, 2 ml GEXSCOPE Red Blood Cell Lysis Buer (Singleron Biotechnologies) was added to
the cell suspension and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. The mixture was then centrifuged at 1000
rpm for 5 min and the cell pellet was resuspended in PBS. The cells were counted with TC20
automated cell counter (Bio-Rad) before further process.
Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) library preparation
Single-cell suspension was adjusted to a concentration of 1×105 cells/ml in PBS, and was then
loaded onto a microfluidic chip. The scRNA-seq libraries were constructed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Singleron GEXSCOPETM Single Cell RNA-seq Library Kit,
Singleron Biotechnologies, www.singleronbio.com), and were then sequenced on an Illumina
HiSeq X Ten instrument with 150 bp paired end reads. The average sequencing depth per library
is around 61 thousand reads per cell.
Primary analysis of scRNA-seq raw sequencing data

Raw reads were processed to generate gene expression matrices by scopetools (e). Briefly, FastQC
(V0.11.7), fastp (1), STAR aligner (2.5.3a) and featureCounts (1.6.2) were used for quality
evaluation, trimming, alignment and transcript counting, respectively. Reads without poly(T) tails
at the intended positions were filtered out, and cell barcode as well as unique molecular identifier
(UMI) for each read were extracted. Adapters and poly(A) tails were trimmed before aligning read
2 to GRCh38 with Ensembl 92 annotation. Reads with the same cell barcode, UMI and gene were
grouped together to generate the number of UMIs per gene per cell. Cell number was then
determined based on the inflection point of the number of UMI versus sorted cell barcode curve.
The scRNA-seq data have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible
through GEO series accession number GSE155900.
Integrated analysis of children lung data with public adult lung data
The public data of 8 healthy adults were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus
(GSE122960).

(https://github.com/satijalab/seurat) was used to integrate the adults and children’s datasets. First,
cells with less than 200 and more than 5000 genes identified as well as those with less than 30000
UMIs were filtered out. Cells with percentage of mitochondrial genes greater than 20% were also
removed. 2000 highly variable genes were used for principal component analysis (PCA) and the
first 20 PCs were selected for the subsequent analysis. Resolution 1.25 was used for the clustering
analysis to obtain 32 clusters, which were assigned to 15 major cell types based on their canonical
marker genes.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Sections (4 μm) of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung tissues were subjected to
standard IHC protocols to analyze the expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and FURIN. After
deparaffinization, antigen retrieval and blocking, the slides were stained using the Leica Bond
(Leica Biosystems) automated staining system with the following primary antibodies for 60 min at
room temperature: anti-ACE2 antibody (rabbit, ab108252 from Abcam, 1:100) and
anti-TMPRSS2 antibody (rabbit, ab92323 from Abcam, 1:2000) for cohort 1; anti-ACE2 antibody
(mouse, 66699-1-Ig, Proteintech, 1:1200) and anti-FURIN antibody (rabbit, 18413-1-AP,
Proteintech, 1:1200) for cohort 2. After three washes, the slides were then incubated with
HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (cohort 1) or biotin-conjugated anti-mouse/rabbit

secondary antibody (cohort 2) for 15-30 min at room temperature. After DAB staining, the slides
were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted. Staining intensities for each
antibody were evaluated in a semiquantitative, five-tier manner (negative = 0, partial weak
positive = 1, diffused weak positive = 2, partial strong positive = 3, diffused strong positive = 4)
by two pathologists independently. The inconsistent scores were determined after consultation by
the two pathologists.
Statistical analysis and data visualization
UMAP (Uniform manifold approximation and projection) visualization of an integrated
scRNA-seq dataset consists of data from GSE122960 and sequencing results from ten children
lung specimens. 15 clustered and annotated cell types are color-coded, while cells from adults and
children are distinguished with blue dots representing cells from adults and red dots representing
cells from children. T-test was applied to compare the expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and
FURIN between children and adults determined by scRNA-seq. The comparison was performed
based on library size normalized counts. The normalization was done using NormalizeData
function in Seurat V3. The R package ggpubr was used to perform t-tests and boxplot
visualization. The dot plot was generated using Seurat V3 DotPlot function. Dot color represents
the Z-score normalized average gene expression within each particular cell type. Dot size
represents the percentage of cells expressing the respective genes within each cell type. Statistical
analyses of IHC scores were performed in GraphPad Prism 8 using Mann-Whitney test with an
exact p value computed. Figures were also generated in GraphPad Prism 8. A p value less than
0.05 is considered statistically significant.
