Simulating the Impacts of Interregional Mobility Restriction on
the Spatial Spread of COVID-19 in Japan
Keisuke Kondo *
RIETI

Abstract
This study develops a spatial Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Recovered (SEIR) model that
analyzes the effect of interregional mobility on the spatial spread of the coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Japan. National and local governments have requested that
residents refrain from traveling between 47 prefectures during the state of emergency.
However, the extent to which restricting the interregional mobility prevents infection
expansion has not been elucidated. Our spatial SEIR model describes the spatial spread
pattern of COVID-19 when people commute to a prefecture where they work or study during
the daytime and return to their residential prefecture at night. We assume that people are
exposed to infection risk during their daytime activities. According to our simulation results,
interregional mobility restriction can prevent geographical expansion of the infection.
However, in prefectures with many infectious individuals, residents are exposed to higher
infection risk when their mobility is restricted. Our simulation results also show that
interregional mobility restriction plays a limited role in reducing the national total number
of infected individuals.

1. Introduction
Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), which are public health measures for the
prevention and control of infection, have played a key role in combating the coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.1–3 To reduce the spatial spread of severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), national and local governments have enforced not only
personal NPIs such as hand washing and mask-wearing, but also strict NPIs such as restricted
movements, events, and travel, school closures, and quarantine.4,5 Among the strictest NPIs
are lockdowns, which restrict our social and economic activities and trigger severe economic
downturns.2
National and local governments in Japan have requested that residents refrain from
traveling between 47 prefectures during the state of emergency, which was declared on April 7
of 2020.5,6 Although the interregional mobility restriction can be relaxed to include some
outings after the state of emergency, the low level of lockdown restriction (i.e., voluntary
compliance without penalties) was the first such experience in Japan.7,8 Therefore, how
interregional mobility restriction limits the expansion of infection in Japan’s context is largely
unknown, although many previous studies have emphasized the importance of understanding
the spatial dynamics of spread.9–16 Effective control measures that prevent spatial spread of
SARS-CoV-2 are urgently demanded, and how NPIs such as travel restrictions and social
distancing mitigate the epidemic must be investigated.17–27 The present study aims to provide
meaningful implications for combating the COVID-19 pandemic through interregional mobility
restrictions.
To analyze how interregional mobility affects the spatial spread of SARS-CoV-2, we
developed a spatial Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Recovered (SEIR) model. As the virus
spreads through face-to-face contact, a spatial network of contagion was built by introducing
interregional mobility into the standard SEIR model. The model assumes that people commute
to a region of work or study in the daytime and return to their residential region at night. It
further assumes that people are exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection risk during their daytime
activities, meaning that residents in one region are exposed to heterogeneous infection risks of
SARS-CoV-2.
To simplify the spatial network analysis, the interregional mobility is mathematically
treated as an origin–destination (OD) matrix. We demonstrate that our spatial SEIR model
reduces to the standard SEIR model when the off-diagonal elements of the OD matrix are zero

(i.e., when people remain in their residential regions). Therefore, our spatial SEIR model can
be viewed as a generalized version of the standard SEIR model.
The developed approach can be also viewed as a spatial version of the social interaction
approach. The social interaction approach constructs a contact matrix across various classes,
such as age and gender.19,25,27–29 Similarly, face-to-face interactions across different regions are
incorporated into the OD matrix.
The daily OD matrix is constructed from the interregional mobility data obtained by
geospatial information technology, namely, from the locational information of mobile phone
users. These data capture the specific situations of individuals, such as commuting to work on
weekdays and remaining in the residential region or traveling to another region during the
weekends. By tracking the interregional mobility on each month, day, and time of day
throughout one year, we successfully captured the daily interregional mobility flows in the
counterfactual situation.
This study aims to implicate effective control measures based on a simulation analysis.
Because mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is an urgent priority, an epidemic model that
guides the planning of efficient control measures is essential when few ideal data are
available.30–32 The spatial SEIR model assumes that the past interregional mobility trend will
continue in future, regardless of how the COVID-19 pandemic evolves. Comparing those
simulated from the SEIR model under the free mobility assumption with those simulated under
the strict interregional mobility restriction, this study evaluates how restricting movement
mitigates the spatial infection spread.

2. Methods
2.1. SEIR model without Interregional Mobility
In the absence of interregional mobility, the SEIR model assumes that infection in one region
is independent of infection in all other regions. In other words, infection expansion in one
region does not affect the infection dynamics in other regions. Later, this baseline model will
incorporate interregional mobility as a source of the spatial infection expansion.
Suppose that there are 𝑚𝑚 regions and that region 𝑖𝑖 has population 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 . The total national

population is expressed as 𝑁𝑁 = ∑𝑚𝑚
𝑖𝑖=1 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 . The birth and death rates are excluded from the model,
meaning that the national total population is fixed over time. The regional population

distribution is also fixed because residential change is forbidden in this model. The daily

mobility (e.g., commuting and travel) is similarly forbidden in the baseline SEIR model, but
this assumption will be relaxed later.
Let 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡), 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) , and 𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) denote the number of susceptible, infectious, and recovered

residents, respectively, in region 𝑖𝑖 at date 𝑡𝑡 . Let 𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) denote the number of residents in

region 𝑖𝑖 at date 𝑡𝑡 who have been exposed to the COVID-19 infection, but who are in the

latent period and not yet infectious. In the SEIR model without a spatial network, the epidemic
dynamics are expressed as follows:

𝑘𝑘=1

where 𝛽𝛽 is the transmission rate parameter, 𝜀𝜀 is the incubation rate, and 𝛾𝛾 is the

recovery rate.

The SEIR model without interregional mobility gives the baseline results for comparison
with the extended model. From this comparison, we can observe how interregional mobility
changes the results. A main distinguishing feature of the spatial SEIR model is the force
of infection 𝜆𝜆(𝑡𝑡) , which measures the rate at which susceptible individuals contract the

infection. This term in the standard SEIR model 𝛽𝛽𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡)/𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 is independent of infection in all

other regions. We highlight how relaxing the assumption of interregional mobility changes the
specified force of infection.

2.2. SEIR model with Interregional Mobility
This study introduces interregional mobility as a spatial network of contagion into the standard
SEIR model. The basic assumptions are those of the above-mentioned baseline setting. As an
additional assumption, interregional mobility causes geographical infection expansion through

person-to-person contact.
Individuals are assumed to be exposed to infection risk only in the region they occupy in
the daytime. For example, suppose that an individual lives in one region and commutes to
another region during the daytime. This interregional mobility provides two possible
transmission channels: transfer of the disease from the region occupied by the commuting
individual to the residential region and spread of the disease from the residential region to the
region occupied by the commuting individual. Thus, interregional mobility spreads the
infection disease across spatial domains.
The interregional mobility can be modeled by spatial network analysis. Let 𝝅𝝅(𝑡𝑡) denote

the OD probability matrix across regions on date 𝑡𝑡:
𝜋𝜋1,1 (𝑡𝑡)
𝜋𝜋 (𝑡𝑡)
𝝅𝝅(𝑡𝑡) = ⎛ 2,1

𝜋𝜋2𝑚𝑚 (𝑡𝑡) ⎞
,
⋮
𝜋𝜋𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 (𝑡𝑡)⎠

(2)

where 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) represents the individual’s probability of traveling from region 𝑖𝑖 to region 𝑗𝑗 on
date 𝑡𝑡. The elements of 𝝅𝝅(𝑡𝑡) along a row must sum to one by the definition of probability.

To simplify the calculation, we assume that this probability matrix is independent of the
infection conditions over time (i.e., is not endogenous). However, the model admits exogenous
seasonal variations or NPIs such as interregional mobility restriction.
In terms of the OD matrix, we can calculate the expected mobility flow from region 𝑖𝑖 to

region 𝑗𝑗 and the expected daytime population in each region. The mobility flow from region
𝑖𝑖 to region 𝑗𝑗 is calculated as

𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) = 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡)𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 .

𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) = 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡)𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡), and 𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) = 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡)𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡). During the daytime, the expected numbers

of susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered individuals are respectively expressed as

Note that the OD probability matrix is assumed to be common between the susceptible,
exposed, infectious, and recovered individuals.

Importantly, the spatial distribution of infectious individuals in the daytime affects the
infection risk in each region. During nighttime, the infectious individuals return to their
residential regions. Therefore, we count cases of the infection within the residential regions.
When residents in region 𝑖𝑖 are exposed to heterogeneous infection risk in each region that
they occupy during the daytime, the infection dynamics in region 𝑖𝑖 is given by

region 𝑖𝑖 and staying in region 𝑗𝑗 during the daytime become infected, and the sum of
them in terms of region 𝑗𝑗 represents the transition in the residential region 𝑖𝑖.

Consider residents in region 𝑖𝑖 who remain in region 𝑖𝑖 . The infection dynamics is expressed

as follows:

When the interregional mobility is restricted, the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the
OD matrix 𝝅𝝅(𝑡𝑡) take values 1 and 0, respectively. Under this assumption, we see that

�𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) = 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) ,
𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) = 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) = 𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) = 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) = 𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) = 0 for all 𝑗𝑗(≠ 𝑖𝑖) and that 𝑁𝑁

model with interregional mobility reduces to the baseline SEIR model. The developed spatial
SEIR model with interregional mobility can thus be viewed as a generalized version of the
SEIR model.

2.3. Simulation Setting
The study objective was to evaluate how interregional mobility restrictions arrest the spatial
spread of the COVID-19 infection. For this purpose, we compared the simulation results of the
spatial SEIR model with and without interregional mobility. The difference between the two
sets of results revealed the impact of interregional mobility on the spread of COVID-19
infection.

To uncover the condition under which restricting the interregional mobility
effectively prevents spatial infection spread, we also considered another type of NPI
implemented. The degree of the NPIs (scaling factor of transmission) is defined as 𝛼𝛼(𝑡𝑡) ∈

(0, 1), and the time-varying transmission rate is given by 𝛽𝛽(𝑡𝑡) = 𝛼𝛼(𝑡𝑡)𝛽𝛽. Note that we

do not consider heterogeneous degree of the NPIs in each region, because we focus only on how
the heterogeneous contact rates through the interregional mobility affect the spatial infection
expansion.
Table 1 presents the parameters settings of the simulation analysis. We assume that average
incubation and infectious periods ℓ𝜀𝜀 and ℓ𝛾𝛾 were assumed as 5 days and 10 days,

respectively.2,33–35, The infectiousness probability of an exposed individual was given as 𝜀𝜀 =

1/ℓ𝜀𝜀 , and the recovery probability of an infected individual was given by 𝛾𝛾 = 1/ℓ𝛾𝛾 . The

transmission rate was determined as 𝛽𝛽 = 𝑅𝑅0 𝛾𝛾 based on the standard SEIR model. The basic

reproduction number ℛ0 was set to 2.6,33 close to that obtained by other studies in Japan.36,37

These parameter settings were common to all simulation scenarios except the intervention
degree 𝛼𝛼(𝑡𝑡).

In this study, the degree of NPIs was exogenously given by the parameter 𝛼𝛼(𝑡𝑡) as a future

policy target parameter, and two case scenarios were simulated: modest convergence,
and worsening cases. Figure 1 shows the intervention degree in both scenarios.
Although the values were arbitrarily set for future scenarios, we attempted to predict
their potential ranges from the estimated effective reproduction numbers.38,31 For
example, when declaring a state of emergency on April 7 of 2020, the Government requested
that person-to-person contact be reduced by 70% at least, meaning that the intervention degree
in Figure 1 was 0.3. For the basic reproduction number ℛ0 in the baseline SEIR model, the

intervention degree must be lower than 1/ℛ0 in the convergence scenario (i.e., the effective
reproduction number must be lower than 1), and 1/ℛ0 or higher in most months of the
worsening case scenario.

The simulation was started on November 4 of 2020, the approximate date before the onset
of the third wave of the pandemic. In the Supplemental Material, we provide additional
simulation results. As a robustness check, we also evaluated how the starting date influenced
the simulation results (e.g., April 7 of 2020 and August 17 of 2020). In addition, we evaluated
the effect of the interregional mobility restriction only for Tokyo.

2.4. Data
Positive COVID-19 cases in each prefecture of Japan are reported by the prefectural
government and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW). This study collected
the daily and cumulative numbers of positive tests reported by each prefectural government
until November 25 of 2020. The slight differences between the numbers reported by the
prefectural governments and the MHLW did not affect the qualitative results.
Figure 2 is a snapshot of the geographical distribution of the numbers of positive cases on
August 17 of 2020 and November 10 of 2020. The COVID-19 infection numbers were highest
in Tokyo (161 and 293 patients testing positive, respectively), followed by Osaka. Although the
infection tended to expand in prefectures with large cities, such as Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya,
Sapporo, Yokohama, and Saitama, other prefectures occasionally experienced a sudden rise in
infection numbers.

of days in the incubation and infectious periods (ℓ𝜀𝜀 and ℓ𝛾𝛾 , respectively), the variables in
the SEIR model were constructed as follows:

𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) = 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 �𝑡𝑡 − ℓ𝛾𝛾 �,

𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) = 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) − 𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡),

𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) = 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡 + ℓ𝜀𝜀 ) − 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡),

(10)

𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) = 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 − 𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) − 𝐼𝐼𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) − 𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡)

where 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 (𝑡𝑡) represents the cumulative number of positive tests reported in prefecture 𝑖𝑖 at

date 𝑡𝑡. The total population in each prefecture 𝑖𝑖 was based on October 2019 data and was

fixed over time (i.e., no migration was assumed across prefectures).

These variables were calculated from the observed data before the simulation start
date, and were predicted by the spatial SEIR model after the simulation start date.
The theoretical part of the model was based on the probabilistic mobility of individuals,
but the OD probability matrix in the empirical part was estimated from the observed data on
interregional mobility, which were derived from the locational information of mobile phone

users. The Regional Economy and Society Analyzing System (RESAS), a web application
developed by the Headquarters for Overcoming Population Decline and Vitalizing Local
Economy in Japan at the Prime Minister's Office, was released on April 21 of 2015.39 The
RESAS app visualizes many types of data in Japan, including a dynamic map of the intermunicipal human flows (the From–To Analysis) based on the Mobile Spatial Statistics of NTT
DOCOMO.40 The detailed information of inter-municipal flows are available by gender, age,
year, month, day of the week (weekdays and weekends), and time of day (4 am, 10 am, 2 pm,
8 pm).
This study applied the monthly data of interregional flows from September of 2015 to
August of 2016 by day of week (weekday or weekend). Although the interregional flow data is
visualized on the RESAS app until 2020, the application programming interface can download
the original data only within a restricted period (from September of 2015 to August of 2016).
The daytime population in each prefecture was estimated from the inter-municipal flows
observed at 2 pm. The inter-municipal flows were aggregated into inter-prefectural flows to
match the observational unit of the COVID-19 infection data. In each scenario, the daily
pattern of interregional mobility from September 2015 to August 2016 was assumed from the
start date of the simulation to December 31 of 2023; that is, the same mobility pattern was
repeated on the same day of each year.
From the data, we calculated the share of inter-prefectural mobility that matched the
probability of interregional mobility. Let 𝑪𝑪(𝑡𝑡) denote the OD matrix across the 47 prefectures

This weight matrix corresponds to the probabilistic OD matrix in the theoretical model.
Figure 3 shows the inter-prefectural OD matrices at 2 pm on weekdays and weekends in
April of 2016. The color strengths in the tile plots represent the flow share. Panel (a) shows
that most of the residents remained in their home prefectures. Panel (b) focuses on the OD
matrix in the Greater Tokyo area (Saitama, Chiba, Tokyo, and Kanagawa). More than 10
percent of the residents in the neighboring prefectures of Tokyo were in Tokyo at 2 pm on the
weekdays of April 2016, but residents tended to remain in their home prefectures on weekends.
This mobility trend affected the inter- and intra-prefectural spread of the infection in the
Greater Tokyo area. Panels (b) of Figure 3 shows the OD matrices in the Greater Osaka areas.
Although the inflows into Osaka from neighboring prefectures were smaller than in the Greater
Tokyo area, Osaka also attracted people from neighboring prefectures.
Figure 4 shows the ratio of daytime and nighttime populations by day of the week
(weekdays versus weekends). As shown in Panel (a), people residing in the neighboring
prefectures of Tokyo and Osaka tended to concentrate in Tokyo and Osaka, respectively, during
the daytime. However, Panel (b) of Figure 4 shows that the spatial distribution of the
population diverged across the country on weekends. From the interregional mobility data
based on the locational information of mobile phone users, we could precisely predict the
spatial spread of infection through interregional commuting and travel on weekends, and the
seasonal trend of the interregional mobility.

The simulations in this paper predicted the numbers of infectious individuals. All estimation
results are available on the web application.
Figure 5 shows the simulation results in the modest convergence scenario. The simulated
numbers of infectious individuals from the spatial SEIR model with and without interregional
mobility (red and green lines, respectively), are compared with the observed number of

The gap between the red and green lines captures the influence of interregional mobility on
the spatial infection spread of COVID-19. This gap tended to be large in rural areas with lower
numbers of infectious individuals at the starting date of the simulation, such as Iwate, Akita,

Wakayama, Shimane, Hiroshima, Yamaguchi, Tokushima, Kagawa, Ehime, Kochi, Nagasaki,
Oita, and Miyazaki. When interregional mobility was included, the numbers of infectious
individuals predicted by the spatial SEIR model were more than twice those predicted without
interregional mobility, implying that interregional mobility caused the infection expiation in
those prefectures.
In prefectures with large cities, such as Tokyo, Aichi, and Osaka, the spatial SEIR model
with interregional mobility predicted lower numbers of infectious individuals than the model
without interregional mobility. To understand why the interregional mobility generated these
results, we calculated the ratios of the daytime and nighttime forces of infection in the Greater
Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka areas.
Figure 6 plots the obtained ratios in the modest convergence case scenarios. Note that the
ratio becomes one in the spatial SEIR model without interregional mobility, because the spatial
population distributions during the daytime and nighttime are identical. As shown in Figure
6, the ratios in Tokyo, Aichi, and Osaka were lower than one and gradually converged to one.

Although large cities generally attract more external people than smaller cities and towns, the

Osaka also decreased the daytime force of infection in those cities. That is, the ratios in the
neighboring prefectures of Tokyo, Aichi, and Osaka were higher than one and gradually
converged to one. Therefore, susceptible residents in Tokyo, Aichi, and Osaka were exposed to
lower infection risk in the daytime than in the nighttime. Continuous interregional mobility

gradually equalized the daytime and nighttime forces of infections within the Greater Tokyo,
Nagoya, and Osaka areas.
Importantly, the national total numbers of infectious individuals were almost identical in
the SEIR models with and without interregional mobility although those simulated from the
SEIR without interregional mobility were always lower than those simulated from the SEIR
with interregional mobility. In other words, restricting the interregional mobility slowed the
speed of the infection spread but did not effectively reduce the infection expansion in the
modest convergence scenario.
Figure 7 shows the simulation results in the worsening case scenario. Relative to the modest
convergence scenario, restricting the interregional mobility widened the gap between the
national total numbers of infectious individuals predicted by the SEIR models in the long term.
This finding implies that restricting the interregional mobility lowered the growth rate of
numbers of infectious individuals when the effective reproduction number exceeded one.
Another important result was that interregional mobility accelerated the expansion of the
COVID-19 infection in the short term in the rural areas, such as Iwate, Akita, Yamagata,
Fukushima, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Niigata, Toyama, Fukui, Nagano, Gifu, Mie, Wakayama,

of infectious individuals between the SEIR models with and without interregional mobility,
such as, Aomori, Okayama, Kumamoto, and Kagoshima.

Our spatial SEIR model with interregional mobility revealed the effect of interregional mobility
on the geographical infection spread of COVID-19. The simulation relies on the past

interregional mobility data obtained from the locational information of mobile phone users. By
analyzing these data, we could evaluate the differences in interregional mobility by season, day
of the week, and period of the day. The government of Japan has recognized the effectiveness
of high-frequency and real-time mobility data in mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic.41 In this
study, the interregional mobility data were constructed into a daily OD matrix, showing the
applicability of recent geospatial information technology in epidemic models.
From the simulation results of both scenarios, we can understand two important aspects of
control measures. The first aspect involves the spatial spread of COVID-19. As expected,
restricting the interregional mobility prevented the wide geographical spreading of the infection.
This control measure is especially important for rural regions with scarce healthcare resources.
Consistent with our simulation results, college student travel during the spring break has
contributed to local infection transmission in the U.S.21
Surprisingly, in prefectures with large cities that attract outside workers (such as Tokyo
and Osaka), the number of infections increased after restricting the interregional mobility.
Although restricting mobility has reduced the total number of COVID-19 cases per capita in
some U.S. cities,20 our simulation results from the spatial SEIR model suggest that the
interregional mobility restriction has heterogeneous impacts on the infection expansion across
regions. For example, an influx of uninfected persons from outside, and an outflux of infectious
persons from regions with many infections, such as Tokyo and Osaka, will reduce the infection
risk in the daytime in those regions. Therefore, restricting the interregional mobility without
restricting intra-regional mobility will result in an increase in the infection risk to residents in
large cities. To prevent further expansion of the infection in regions with many infections,
additional strong NPIs should accompany the restrictions on interregional mobility. For
example, contact restriction may be an effective control measure.17
The second aspect of control measures is whether the interregional mobility restriction can
reduce the national total number of infections. Distinguishing between the short- and long
term control measures is important, and the fundamental goal should be toward reducing the
overall epidemic size.18
According to our simulation results, restricting the interregional mobility had a limited
effect on reducing the national total number of infectious individuals. Imposing the mobility
restriction cut the growth rate in national total number of infectious individuals only when the
effective reproduction number was one or higher. Moreover, it was pointed out that regional
lockdowns effectively reduced the overall epidemic size only when the transmission rate

remained persistently low.18 These results imply that the efficacy of imposing the mobility
restriction (in terms of reducing the overall epidemic size) is very sensitive to the timing of the
restriction. In the Supplemental Material, we also evaluated other case scenarios (e.g., the
effects of the timing of the mobility restriction and regional lockdown in Tokyo).
In conclusion, the interregional mobility restriction dominantly affected the spatial pattern
and the speed of the infection spread and played a limited role in reducing the national total
number of infections. The most important implication of restricting the interregional mobility
is the avoidance of an epidemic peak that overwhelms the existing healthcare services,
especially in rural regions where healthcare resources are typically scarce in Japan.42 In that
sense, the mobility restriction is an effective control measure.
