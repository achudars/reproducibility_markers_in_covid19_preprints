Abstract/Introduction
A wide clinical spectrum has become a hallmark of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, although
its immunologic underpinnings remain to be defined. We have performed deep characterization of B cell
responses through high-dimensional flow cytometry to reveal substantial heterogeneity in both effector and
immature populations. More notably, critically ill patients displayed hallmarks of extrafollicular B cell activation
as previously described in autoimmune settings. Extrafollicular activation correlated strongly with large
antibody secreting cell expansion and early production of high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Yet,
these patients fared poorly with elevated inflammatory biomarkers, multi-organ failure, and death. Combined,
the findings strongly indicate a major pathogenic role for immune activation in subsets of COVID-19 patients.
Our study suggests that, as in autoimmunity, targeted immunomodulatory therapy may be beneficial in specific
patient subpopulations that can be identified by careful immune profiling.

Main Text
As efforts intensify to identify treatment options and develop effective vaccination strategies against
COVID-19 infection 1, 2, 3, 4, there is an urgent need for accurate characterization of protective and nonprotective B-cell responses. The identification of new human B cell subsets 5, 6, 7, 8, and their integration in a
coherent classification 8, enable the application of high-dimensional flow cytometry to accurately identify B cell
profiles while providing functional context in order to understand infection response course. To this end, we
studied 17 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection with flow panels that: 1. Accurately identify B cell
populations; 2. Assess activation status; and 3. Indicate homing potential through integrin and chemokine
receptor modulation (Supplemental table 1). Of the COVID-19 cohort, 10 were critically ill requiring ICU
admission (Severe COVID-19; ICU-C) and 4 of the 10 patients died (Supplementary table 2). This group was
compared to milder outpatients (Outpatient COVID; OUT-C) and healthy donors (HD).
Despite reports of lymphocytopenia 9, patients with COVID-19 displayed elevated numbers of
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, with CD19+ B cells significantly increased relative to HD (Supplemental fig
1). B cell profiling identified primary populations (transitional [Tr], naive [N], double negative [DN], memory [M],
and antibody secreting cells [ASCs]), that could be then fractionated into 14 non-redundant, secondary B cell
populations of established significance (supplemental Table 3) 10. As illustrated in Fig 1a-f, the three clinical

groups display characteristic B cell profiles characterized by either expansions of ASC and DN2 cells (ICU-C)
or transitional cells (OUT-C) (Figs 1-3).
To further guide exploration of the cohort, a UMAP algorithm for dimensionality reduction 11 was applied
to a cohort composite sample for all assessed parameters, and cells from the composite were mapped in 2dimensional Cartesian space (Fig 1h). This approach reveals clear phenotypic B cell separation in the 3 clinical
groups (Fig 1h). Thus, three major cell clusters were apparent in the projection. Cluster 1 is highly diverse,
predominantly composed of transitional, naive, and IgM+ memory subsets. (Fig 1h). If note, while IgD-only
memory (dM) is relatively rare in HD (Fig 1f), its diverse in surface phenotype resulted in a wide distribution
across Cluster 1 (Fig 1h). Cluster 2 is more homogenous, consisting of DN populations 1-3, and the switch
memory (sM) compartment. Importantly, sM B cells neatly overlay the DN1 population confirming our previous
report of their close phenotypic association 6 while DN2 B cells formed a distinct cluster within the larger DN
density (Fig 1i). ASC populations split by CD138 expression pattern defined cluster 3 (Fig 1i)
By overlaying disease states onto the composite and subtracting overlapping densities, differential
cellular signatures become visually apparent (Fig 2a), with three main regions of interest distinguishing ICU-C
and OUT-C patients both from each other, and from HD. Region 1 highlights an area of high CD11c
expression by the ICU-C cohort demarcating activated-naive (aN) and DN2 populations (Fig 1i, Fig 2b), which
are significantly enriched in ICU-C (Fig 2c-d). In accordance with previous studies defining their participation in
EF responses 8 (Supplemental figure 2), both aN and DN2 cells express the highest levels of CD11c and of the
IFNÎ³-inducible transcription factor T-bet (Fig 2e-f). Consistent with a critical role of similar B cells in
autoimmunity and viral clearance in mice 12, 13, 14, our findings provide original evidence for the triggering of
these B cells in human acute viral infection and in particular, in the early stages of COVID-19 infection. Region
2 is comprised of ASCs, a population whose expansion is a major correlate of protection in vaccine responses
15

. In contrast, in COVID-19 infection, high levels of ASC formation instead portended negative disease

outcomes with ICU-C patients presenting with significantly higher levels of ASCs than other groups (Fig 2g-h).
These findings are consistent with a proposed immunopathogenic role of plasmablasts or circulating ASC
expansions in acute Dengue infection 16. Similar to some vaccine responses 17, an unusually high ASC
fraction expressed the plasma cell maturation marker CD138 (Fig 2i-j). This feature is likely to reflect the
intensity and inflammatory milieu of the ASC response in ICU-C patients. Finally, region 3 maps neatly to the

CD21lo Tr subset (Fig 1h, Fig 2a), which is significantly increased in OUT-C patients. Transitional cells in
general comprise up to 25% of the overall B cell compartment in OUT-C patients with CD21lo cells making up
more than half of the overall frequency gain (Fig 2k-l). Notably, while OUT-C CD21lo Tr cells express similar
levels of developmental markers such as CD10 and CD24 as HD (Fig 2m), they diverge in the expression of
CD138 expression. Their correlation with milder COVID-19 disease is consistent with a protective role possibly
played through regulatory functions 18. Alternatively, their higher expression of CD138 might be consistent with
effector conversion into ASC as it has been recently described 19 (Fig 2m). Whether CD21lo Tr cells play a
protective role through regulatory functions or the production of protective anti-viral antibodies should be
elucidated in future studies.
The use of secondary population frequencies as features for the hierarchical clustering of COVID-19
patients, demonstrates a distinct separation between outpatient and ICU-admitted patients with COVID-19,
driven primarily by a coordinated increase in the more severe group of both aN and DN2 populations, both EF
pathway constituents (Fig 3a). A novel DN population (DN3), previously unreported in other conditions and
defined by the absence of both CD21 and CD11c, consistently fell alongside aN and DN2 populations. While
the function and significance of DN3 cells remain to be fully elucidated, these cells contain a CD38+ subset
that is expanded in some patients, and correspond to the early pre-ASCs we previously identified in vaccine
responses 20 (Supplemental Figure 2a). Their expansion in the ICU-C cohort, association with other EF
populations, and reduced expression of CXCR5 suggests relevance to this effector pathway (Fig 3a,
Supplemental Figure 2b-c). Expression of all three of these populations was highly correlated with the ASC
expansion described above (Fig 2a, 3a), forming a clear EF population cluster that defined the responses
within the critically ill. This was not a reflection of infection duration as both EF-high (CoV-A) and EF-low (CoVB) clusters were sampled at similar times post symptom onset (Fig 3b).
The combination of T-bet driven effector development and high frequency of ASC in ICU-C patients is
highly similar to previous studies of the activation of the EF B cell pathway in patients with highly active SLE6.
In those studies, activation of the B cell EF pathway resulted in expansions in the ASC, aN, and DN2
compartments with concordant reductions in DN1 cells and unswitched memory populations 6, 21, 22. As in our
ICU cohort, this phenotype highly correlated with disease severity and is preferentially observed in African

American patients, a population disproportionally represented in severe COVID-19 in general and in our ICU in
particular.
Direct comparison of the CoV-A cluster to patients with active, EF-driven SLE revealed strikingly similar
features within the DN compartment (Fig 3c). DN composition, a key indicator of EF response activation, is
clearly skewed towards the ASC-associated DN2 subset in the CoV-A group, and was similar to patients with
active SLE (Fig 3d-e). Thus, DN2:DN1 ratios, a reflection of EF to follicular response dynamics, are
significantly higher in this group (Fig 3f). Of additional interest, the EF-dominated phenotype is associated with
a contraction of unswitched memory cells, a feature consistently observed in SLE and other autoimmune
diseases 21, 23, 24 (Fig 3g). Chemokine receptor analysis of EF populations in patients with COVID-19 shows a
decrease in follicular homing predisposition through CXCR5 (Fig 3h). Instead, CXCR3 expression, in
conjunction with expression the chemokine CXCL10 (IP-10) is suggestive of peripheral homing to inflamed
tissue sites such as the lung as previously described in human influenza infection 25 (Fig 3h).
The EF response characterization has identified the pathway as peripherally focused, inflammatory,
and highly associated with IL-6 and IP-10 22, 26, 27. Both of these factors have now been identified as
biomarkers of poor prognosis in the COVID-19 literature 28 and could be identified at increased levels in the
CoV-A cluster (Fig 3i-j). In keeping with those studies, the four patients with the highest levels of IL-6 did not
survive (Fig 3j). CRP, an acute phase reactant in the IL-6 pathway, has been increasingly used as a biomarker
of COVID-19 severity and was also increased in ICU-C (Fig 3k). Expression of IL-6 and IP-10 were both
correlated with CRP in patients with COVID-19 (Fig 3l-m). Importantly, DN2 prevalence within the DN
compartment was also significantly associated with CRP levels, indicating that the extent of EF activation is a
correlate of disease severity (Fig 3n).
The expansion of ASCs in the ICU-C group raises important questions about their function and
specificity. Antigen specific responses against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein were higher in the severe vs. mild groups (Fig 4a). This observation could represent non-neutralizing
responses to control the high degree of viral replication, and highlights the possibility of antibody mediated
enhancement of disease or pathogenic antibody responses. In turn, pathogenic ASC function could result in
autoantibody production29, 30 or pro-inflammatory cytokines 31.

This high Ag-specific responsiveness is broad with participation of IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies (Fig
4a). Importantly, ICU-C responses are higher than outpatient responses and occur very early in the infection
course with significantly elevated titers by day 5 post symptom onset (Fig 4b). In accordance with these data,
single cell VDJ repertoire sequencing of ASCs from a critically ill patient (Fig 3a) reveal that these responses
utilized a balanced IgM, IgG1, and IgA1 signature (Fig 4c-d). Moreover, more than 3% of all of the lineages
identified this patient displayed active contemporaneous connection between IgM, and IgG1 or IgA1, thereby
demonstrating ongoing isotype switch consistent with guided maturation of the immune response (Fig 4d).
Also consistent with ongoing maturation and antigen-selection, the ASC VDJ repertoire was characterized by
the presence of clonal expansions with numerous clones contributing more than 0.1% of the entire repertoire
and multiple clones representing 1-8% â a finding confirmed by bulk VDJ sequencing of two additional ICU-C
patients (Fig 4e). In addition, single cell sequencing identified individual multimember clonal lineages with
complex branching patterns, class switching, and broad ranges of somatic hypermutation indicative of robust
antigen selection (Fig 4f). Nevertheless, a majority of the lineages identified had remarkably low mutation
frequencies â especially lineages comprising the IgA1 and IgG1 compartments (Fig 4g). Indeed, more than half
of the lineages obtained expressed germline VH genes. This pattern is consistent with the presence of newly
recruited EF clones as previously reported by our group in the SLE EF responses 21 (Fig 4h). By analogy with
the SLE response where unmutated, switched ASC displayed a high degree of autoreactivity, it is possible that
in severe COVID-19 these clones might represent viral responders, a feature that will require further analysis.
A hallmark of SLE is defective tolerance resulting in increased levels of disease-specific IgHV 4-34 B cells and
autoantibodies with established intrinsic autoreactivity determined by a hydrophobic patch encoded in the
germline framework 132. This patch is selected against in healthy individuals to allow the expression of nonautoreactive, protective IgHV 4-34 antibodies 33. In contrast, this germline patch could be readily observed in
the repertoire dataset with 34 of 40 VH4-34 expressing lineages even in expanded clones (9/34) and in those
with significant levels of overall VH mutation (Fig 4h). In all, while the relatively low frequency of IgHV 4-34
clones argues against the expansion of SLE-related autoantibodies in severe COVID-19, the high frequency of
IgHV 4-34 retaining germline determinants of autoreactivity could be indicative of tolerance breakdown. Further
studies to understand the autoreactivity of COVID-19 ASC will be critical to understand their contribution to the
extensive immunopathology now well documented in these patients34.

COVID-19 has vexed clinicians across the globe with its spectrum of illness severity and seemingly
maladaptive immune response. Through careful humoral immunophenotyping, the current study offers three
important observations in severe illness: 1. While ASCs are robustly expanded in serious infection, their
presence cannot be considered a correlate of productive or protective immunity. Indeed, the opposite is true.
Robust, antigen-specific humoral immunity early in the disease course carries an ominous prognosis in our
dataset. 2. Serious COVID-19 illness is highly associated with active extrafollicular B cell responses
reminiscent of active SLE and other autoimmune disorders. 3. Due to disease heterogeneity,
immunomodulatory therapy, including IL-6 inhibition may have discordant effects on different patient groups.
Finally, it will be critical to determine if, as in SLE, pre-disposition towards extrafollicular B-cell activation may
be compounding with socio-economic factors to result in the poor infection outcomes observed in the African
American population.

Methods
Human Subjects
All research was approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board (Emory IRB
numbers IRB00058507, IRB00057983, and IRB00058271) and was performed in accordance with all
relevant guidelines and regulations. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or, if
they were unable to provide informed consent, obtained from designated healthcare surrogates.
Healthy donors (n = 36) were recruited using promotional materials approved by the Emory University
Institutional Review Board. Subjects with COVID-19 (n = 19) were recruited from Emory University
Hospital, Emory University Hospital Midtown and Emory St. Josephâs Hospital, all in Atlanta, GA, USA.
All non-healthy donor subjects were diagnosed with COVID-19 by PCR amplification of SARS-CoV-2
viral RNA obtained from nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs. Subjects with COVID-19 were
included in the study if they were 18 to 80 years of age, not immunocompromised, and had not been
given oral or intravenous corticosteroids within the preceding 14 days. Peripheral blood was collected in
either heparin sodium tubes (PBMCs) (BD Diagnostic Systems) or serum tubes (serum) (BD Diagnostic
Systems). Baseline subject demographics are included in Supplemental Table 2. Study data were
collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at Emory University35
Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell Isolation and Plasma Collection
Peripheral blood samples were collected in heparin sodium tubes and processed within 6 hours of
collection. PBMCs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation at 1000 x g for 10 minutes. Aliquots from
the plasma layer were collected and stored at -80C until use. PBMCs were washed 2 times with RPMI at 500 x
g for 5 minutes. Viability was assessed using trypan blue exclusion and live cells were counted using an
automated hemocytometer.
Flow cytometry
2 million isolated PBMCs were centrifuged and resuspended in 75ul FACS buffer (PBS + 2% FBS) +
5ul Fc receptor block (Biolegend Cat# 422302) for 5 min RT. For samples stained with anti-IgG, it was
observed that Fc block inappropriately interfered with staining, so a pre-incubation step of the anti-IgG alone
for 5 min at RT was added prior to the addition of the block. 25ul of Ab cocktail was added (100ul staining
reaction), and samples were incubated for 20min at 4 degrees. Cells were washed in PBS, and resuspended in

a PBS dilution of Zombie NIR fixable viability dye (Biolegend Cat# 423106). Cells were washed, and fixed at
0.8% PFA for 10 min at RT in the dark before a final wash and resuspension for analysis.
For intracellular staining, the 0.8% PFA fix step was omitted, and an additional wash was added
following viability staining. Fixation and permeabilization of the cells was carried out as per manufacturerâs
instructions using the True-Nuclearâ¢ Transcription Factor Buffer Set (Biolegend Cat# 424401). Following
permeabilization, cells were stained with ICS-directed antibodies diluted in permeabilization buffer as listed.

Cells were analyzed on a Cytek Aurora flow cytometer using Cytek SpectroFlo software. Up to 3 x 106
cells were analyzed using FlowJo v10 (Treestar) software. For UMAP projections, all samples stained with
panel 2 were downsampled using the DownSample plugin (V3.3) available on the FlowJo Exchange. All
samples were concatenated to create a single composite, and a UMAP algorithm for dimensionality reduction
was applied using the UMAP plugin (V3.1) available on the FlowJo Exchange. The composite sample was regated for all primary and secondary populations to aid in visual overlays in exploration of the UMAP
projections.
Analysis software
Computational analysis was carried out in R, version 3.6.2 (release 12.12.2019). Heatmaps were
generated using the pheatmap library (version 1.0.12), with data pre-normalized (log-transformed z-scores
calculated per feature) prior to plotting. Clustering was carried out using Wardâs method. Custom plotting such
as Ag-specific response curves was performed using the ggplot2 library for base analysis, and then postprocessed in Adobe Illustrator. Circos plotting was carried out using Circos software, version 0.69-9. Lineage
trees were claculated using GLaMST (Grow Lineages along Minimum Spanning Tree) software36, run on
matlab, and then visualized in R using the iGraph package, version 1.2.4.2. Exported trees were then postprocessed in Adobe Illustrator. Statistical analyses were performed directly in R, or in Graphpad Prism, version
8.2.1.
Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting of B Cell Subsets
Frozen cell suspensions were thawed at 37Â°C in RPMI + 10% FCS and then washed and resuspended
in FACS buffer [PBS + 2% FCS]. The cells were incubated with a mix of fluorophore-conjugated antibodies for
30 min on ice. The cells were washed in PBS and then incubated with the Live/Dead Fixable Aqua Dead Cell
Stain (Thermofisher) for 10 min at room temperature. After a final wash in FACS buffer, the cells were
resuspended in FACS buffer at a concentration of 107 cells/ml for cell sorting on a three-laser BD FACS (BD
Biosciences). ASCs were gated as CD3âCD14â CD16âCD19+CD38+CD27+ single live cells whereas naÃ¯ve B
cells were gated as CD3âCD14â CD16âIgD19+CD27-IgD+CD38+ single live cells.
For bulk sequencing preparations, B cells were enriched StemCell's Human Pan-B Cell Enrichment Kit
(Catalog #19554; negative selection of CD2, CD3, CD14, CD16, CD36, CD42b, CD56, CD66b, CD123).

CD138+ ASCs were further enriched using CD138+ selection beads according to the manufacturerâs
instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat# 130-051-301).
Library preparation and sequencing
Cells were immediately counted using a hemocytometer and adjusted to 1000 cells/ÂµL to capture
10,000 single cells/sample loaded in the 10x-Genomics Chromium according to the manufacturerâs standard
protocol (Chromium Next GEM Single Cell V(D)J Reagent Kits v1.1). The 10x-Genomics v2 libraries were
prepared using the 10Ã Genomics Chromium Single Cell 5â² Library Construction Kit as per the manufacturerâs
instructions. Libraries were sequenced, on an Illumina NovaSeq (paired-end; 2X 150 bp ; read 1: 26 cycles; i7
index: 8 cycles, i5 index: 0 cycles; read 2: 98 cycles) such that more than 70% saturation can be achieved with
sequence depth of 5000 reads per cell.
Cytokine Immunoassays
Plasma levels of IL-6 was carried out by ELISA using a Human IL-6 Quantikine ELISA Kit according to
the manufacturerâs instructions (R+D Biosystems, Cat # HS600C). CRP was measured in a singleplex
immunoassay (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA) in a Luminex-200 platform following manufacturerâs protocol
(25 uL of 1:40,000 dilution in duplicates).
Carbodiimide coupling of microspheres to SARS-CoV-2 antigens.
Two SARS-CoV-2 proteins were coupled to MagPlexÂ® Microspheres of different regions (Luminex;
Austin, TX, USA). Nucleocapsid (N) protein expressed from E. coli (N-terminal His6) was obtained from
Raybiotech (230-01104-100) and the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of Spike protein expressed from
HEK293 was obtained from the laboratory of Dr. Jens Wrammert37. Coupling was carried out at room
temperature following standard carbodiimide coupling procedures. Concentrations of coupled microspheres
were confirmed by Bio-rad T20 Cell Counter.
Luminex proteomic assays for measurement of anti-antigen antibody.
Fifty ÂµL coupled microsphere mix was added to each well of clear bottom 96-well black
polystyrene microplates (Greiner Bio-One) at a concentration of 1000 microspheres per region per well. All
wash steps and dilutions were accomplished using 1% BSA, 1X PBS assay buffer. Serum was assayed at
1:500 dilution and surveyed for antibodies against N and RBD. After a one-hour incubation in the dark on a
plate shaker at 800 rpm, wells were washed five times in 100 ÂµL of assay buffer, using a BioTek 405 TS plate

washer, then applied with 3 Âµg/mL PE-conjugated Goat Anti-Human IgA, IgG and/or IgM (Southern Biotech;
Birmingham, AL, USA). After 30 minutes of incubation at 800 rpm in the dark, wells were washed three times in
100 ÂµL of assay buffer, resuspended in 100 ÂµL of assay buffer, and analyzed using a Luminex FLEXMAP 3DÂ®
instrument (Luminex; Austin, TX, USA) running xPonent 4.3 software. Median Fluorescent Intensity (MFI)
using combined or individual detection antibodies (anti-IgA/anti-IgG/anti-IgM) was measured using the Luminex
xPONENT software. The background value of assay buffer was subtracted from each serum sample result to
obtain Median Fluorescent Intensity minus Background (MFI-B; Net MFI).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using Prism statistical analysis software. For each experiment, the
type of statistical testing, summary statistics, and levels of significance can be found in the figures and
corresponding figure legends
