Abstract
During the current COVID-19 pandemic, it has been suggested that BAME background
patients may be disproportionately affected compared to White but few detailed data are
available. We took advantage of near real-time hospital data access and analysis pipelines
to look at the impact of ethnicity in 1200 consecutive patients admitted between 1st March
2020 and 12th May 2020 to King’s College Hospital NHS Trust in London (UK).
Our key findings are firstly that BAME patients are significantly younger and have different
co-morbidity profiles than White individuals. Secondly, there is no significant independent
effect of ethnicity on severe outcomes (death or ITU admission) within 14-days of symptom
onset, after adjustment for age, sex and comorbidities.

Introduction
As the Covid-19 pandemic extends from ethnically homogeneous countries in East Asia to
multicultural populations in Europe and North America, anecdotal reports suggest a higher
disease burden in Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups 1. Early UK audit data on
COVID-19 indicate a higher proportion of BAME patients on critical care units than previous
years but do not establish whether disease outcome is worse than in White patients or the
factors underlying any disparity2.

Methods
This project operated under London South East Research Ethics Committee approval
(reference 18/LO/2048) granted to the King’s Electronic Records Research Interface
(KERRI). Specific work on COVID19 research was reviewed with expert patient input on a
virtual committee with Caldicott Guardian oversight.

We evaluated the effect of ethnicity on disease outcomes in a consecutive cohort of 1200
patients admitted with COVID-19 disease to King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust
from 1st March 2020 to 12th May 2020. This multi-site tertiary centre in South East London
serves an ethnically diverse population: approximately 30% of residents identify as BAME in
the immediate vicinity of the largest site (boroughs of Southwark and Lambeth) and ~12%
near the Bromley site3.

We used an informatics pipeline previously described for evaluating ACE-inhibitor risk in
patients with COVID-19 disease4. The primary endpoint was death (WHO-COVID-19
Outcomes Scale 8) or admission to critical care (WHO-COVID-19 Outcomes Scale 6-7) by

14 days after symptom onset. Self-assigned ethnicity is reported according to UK census
categories.

Results
The distribution of self-identified ethnicity among patients is shown in Table 1. 30.7% of
patients were BAME. BAME patients (84% Black) had a significantly higher prevalence of
diabetes and hypertension but were significantly younger than White patients (Table 2,
Figure 1). The prevalence of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and heart failure tended to be
lower in BAME compared to White patients. The incidence of the primary end-point by 21
days after symptom onset and Kaplan-Meier curves were similar between White and BAME
patients (Figure 2).

We tested whether BAME ethnicity was independently associated with the incidence of the
primary outcome but did not find a significant statistical association in a series of multivariate
logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes,
ischaemic heart disease/ heart failure) - Table 3. Increasing age and male sex were
associated with an increased likelihood of the primary outcome.

This study in a series of 1200 patients hospitalised with COVID-19 disease in London
(United Kingdom) indicates large ethnicity-related differences in age and comorbidities.
Patients of BAME origin who require admission for COVID-19 are significantly younger than
White patients from the same geographical area and have a significant higher burden of
diabetes and hypertension. We did not identify an independent impact of ethnicity on the
severity of in-hospital outcome after admission. Our BAME patients were predominantly
Black and the results may not apply to other ethnicities. Further studies are required to
establish the reasons underlying the ethnicity-related differences in number and profile of
patients who require hospitalisation for COVID-19 disease.
