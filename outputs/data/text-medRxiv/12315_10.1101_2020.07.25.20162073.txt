Abstract
Many recent studies have investigated the role of either Chloroquine (CQ) alone,
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) alone, or CQ/HCQ in combination with azithromycin (AZM) in
management of the emerging coronavirus. This systematic review and meta-analysis of either
published or preprint observational or interventional studies were conducted to assess the cure
rate, duration of hospital stay, radiological progression, clinical worsening, need for mechanical
ventilation, the occurrence of side effects, and mortality. A search of the online database through
June 2020 was performed and examined the reference lists of pertinent articles for in-vivo
studies only. Pooled relative risks (RRs), standard mean, of 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were
calculated with the random-effects model. Results: The duration of hospital stay was shorter in
the standard care in comparison with HCQ group, the standard mean of hospital stay was 0.57,
95% CI, and 0.20-0.94. Overall virological cure, or more specifically at day 4, 10, and 14 among
patients exposed to HCQ did not differ significantly from the standard care [(RR=0.92, 95% CI
0.78-1.15), (RR=1.11, 95% CI 0.74-1.65), (RR=1.21, 95%CI 0.70-2.01), and (RR=0.98, 95% CI,
0.76-1.27)] respectively. Radiological improvement or clinical worsening was not statistically

different between HCQ and standard care [(RR=1.11, 95% CI 0.64-1.65) and (RR=1.28, 95% CI
0.33-4.99)]. The need for mechanical ventilation (MV) was not significant between the HCQ
group and the standard care (RR= 1.5, 95%CI 0.78-2.89). Side effects were more reported in the
HCQ group than the standard care (RR=3.14, 95% CI 1.58- 6.24). Mortality among HCQ was
not affected by receiving HCQ (RR=3.14, 95% CI 1.58-6.24), meta-regression analysis revealed
that country is a strong predictor of mortality. The duration of hospital stay among the HCQ and
AZM didn’t differ significantly from the standard care (standard mean= 0.77, 95% CI 0.461.08). Despite virological cure and need for MV did not differ significantly [(RR= 3.23, 95% CI
0.70-14.97) and (RR=1.27, 95%CI 0.7-2.13)] respectively. Mortality among the HCQ+AZM was
more significantly higher than among the standard care (RR= 1.8, 95% CI 1.19-2.27).
Conclusion: Despite the scarcity of published data of good quality, the effectiveness and safety
of either HCQ alone or in combination with AZM in treating the pandemic of COVID-19 can’t
be assured. Future randomized control trials need to be carried out to verify this conclusion.

BACKGROUND
Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a serious health problem caused by the novel
Coronavirus (nCOV) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)(1).
SARS-COV-2 is a member of the Coronavirus family, a family which was previously
responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012.(2)
COVID-19 was emerged by the end of 2019 at Wuhan City in China and was notified by
WHO to be a pandemic in March 2020. (3) Till the 19th of July, 2020, 14,444,995 COVID-19
cases and 605,225 deaths were reported worldwide. (4)
Till now, there is no effective treatment for COVID-19. (5) Chloroquine (CQ) was
initially reported to be effective against SARS-COV-2 and then Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)
followed. (6) SARS-COV-2 is known to bind to human cells via the Angiotensin-Converting
Enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptor. (7, 8) In-vitro studies showed that CQ and HCQ cause glycosylation
of ACE2 receptor making cells to be refractory to SARS-COV-2 infection. (8) This makes the
drugs possible players in the treatment and even the prophylaxis against COVID-19.
Both drugs have also shown to have immunomodulatory effects. (9) HCQ is now broadly
used in autoimmune diseases such as Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis. (9) This makes both drugs
potentially effective in reducing the severity of COVID-19 through suppressing the immune
system response to SARS-COV-2, which is now thought to be at least partly responsible for the
severe forms of the disease. (8)
The safety of both drugs is also an important issue. Although both drugs are generally
well-tolerated, high doses can be associated with severe side effects like myopathy, neuropathy,
and cardiomyopathy. (10) Retinopathy is a well-known side effect that is related to prolonged use.
(9)

Usage of CQ or HCQ in critically ill patients can carry a higher risk of side effects, especially

when combined with other drugs that carry a risk of QT interval prolongation increasing the risk
of torsade’s de points. (11, 12)
In-vivo studies showed contradictory results regarding CQ and HCQ in COVID-19.
Firstly, Chinese researchers reported the efficacy of CQ against COVID-19. (13) Then, a French
group reported the efficacy of HCQ added to Azithromycin (AZM) in decreasing viral load. (14)

After that, many studies were reported showing no benefit or even harmful effects.(12) Here, we
conducted an in-vivo meta-analysis of efficacy and safety of CQ and HCQ in COVID-19.

Radiological Progression
The radiological progression here includes the number of patients who show progression
in their radiological CT results during the period of a study.
Clinical Worsening
By clinical worsening, we mean deterioration of the case during the study’s period, or
development of complications such as severity progression, or worsening of clinical symptoms.
Need for Mechanical Ventilation (MV)
We mean by the need for MV the percentage of patients who needed respiratory support
through MV during a study.
The Occurrence of Side Effects
This includes any side effect that happens from using the studied treatment during a study.
Mortality
Mortality in this study is the percentage of deaths that occur during a study period.
QT Prolongation
In this study, we target specifically the effect of HCQ/CQ/AZ on QT prolongation during
a study period.
Data Extraction
A computer literature searches of (PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane, Scopus, Web of
Science, Segle, VLH, COVID-Inato, COVID-Trial- Clinical Trial.gov) was conducted till June

ncov disease OR COV OR Coronavirus). (Eight independent authors screened the literature
search results for relevant studies according to the pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria.
All records were collected into an Endnote library to find and delete the duplicates using
the “remove duplicating function” with two options is mandatory. All references that had (1)
same title and author and published in the same year, and (2) same title and author, and
published in the same journal, would be deleted. References remaining after this step were
exported to a Microsoft Excel file with essential information for screening. These include the
authors’ names, publication year, journal, DOI, URL link, and abstract.
The title and abstract screening were done by seven independent reviewers to select
papers based on inclusion criteria. Each article was checked by two independent reviewers. Any
disagreement was solved by the first author (RG). During the full-text screening phase, all
selected articles were downloaded, and the full text was reviewed by two independent reviewers.
The decision to include or exclude articles for qualitative and quantitative analysis should be
agreed by the two reviewers to pass through. If any disagreement was noticed, the first author
was asked to give his decision. The completed data were then thoroughly checked by two
reviewers (RMG, AK)
We applied three methods to do manual searching. Firstly, we searched the reference lists
of the included articles. Secondly, we performed what is known as citation tracking in which the
reviewers track all the articles that cite each one of the included articles. This might involve the
electronic searching of databases. Thirdly, similar to the citation tracking, we followed all
“related to” or “similar “articles. All excluded records were given exclusion reasons. Manually
added research included preprint, and unpublished data if fulfilling the inclusion criteria.

During the data extraction and the quality assessment, in a Microsoft Excel sheet, two
reviewers extracted data related to patient characteristics and outcomes (authors, year of
publication, country of patients, inclusion or exclusion criteria, when the study was conducted,
study’s design, sample size, treatment option, dosage and duration, adverse events, primary and
secondary outcome). All collected articles and data extracted can be found here (Supplementary
Data 1).
Data Analysis
Method of Data Analysis
Data were analyzed using Review Manager Software V5.3 for Windows. For the
continuous variables, data were pooled using the mean difference. For the categorical variables,
data were pooled using Risk Ratio (RR) with the perspective of 95% Confidence Interval (CI) in
the meta-analysis model. In the case of zero frequency, the correction value of 0.1 was used. In
the case of significant heterogeneity, we used the random effect model, otherwise, the fixedeffect model was used. Meta-regression analysis was done to examine the impact of age
difference on HCQ regimen group mortality RR.
Heterogeneity
Heterogeneity was assessed by the Chi-Square test (X2) and measured by the I-Square
test. I-Square (I2) statistic was used for heterogeneity evaluation. Following Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 10, I2 was interpreted as follows: “0% to 40%: might not
be important; 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity; 50% to 90%: may represent
substantial heterogeneity; 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity. The importance of the
observed value of I2 depends on (i) magnitude and direction of effects, and (ii) strength of
evidence for heterogeneity (e.g. P-value from the chi-squared test, or a confidence interval for

I2). In the case of heterogeneity, DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models were applied to
pool the outcomes. Otherwise, the inverse variance fixed-effect model was used. In the case of
missing standard deviation (SD), we calculated it from the corresponding 95% confidence
interval or the standard error (17). Forest plots were presented to visualize the degree of variation
between studies. In the case of the absence of mean and standard deviation, authors were emailed
and asked for the required data, or they were calculated according to the formula mentioned in
this research (18).
Quality Assessment
Quality assessment (QA) of the research depended on the study design. The risk of bias
in the individual studies included for meta-analysis was assessed using the Cochrane risk
assessment tool in cases of Randomized Control Trials (RCT) (19), study quality assessment tools
for observational study (20), and Robins-1 for Non-Randomized control trial (21). The assessment
was performed by two independent reviewers (AA, AK, SH) and further checked by two
additional reviewers (RG, RS). The risk of bias for non-randomized control trial and
observational study is found in the following link (Supplementary Data 2).
Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis is known to be an essential part in systematic reviews with metaanalyses to determine the robustness of the obtained outcomes to the assumptions made in the
data analysis (23). We conducted leave ne sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of studies that
greatly influence the result, especially by their weight through excluding them from the metaanalysis.

RESULTS
Study Selection Process
A total of 4730 articles were found after searching for 12 different databases. Of this
number, 1151 duplicates found by Endnote X8, and 472 were published before 2019. So, they
were excluded. Title and abstract included for 3107 papers resulted in the exclusion of irrelevant
papers (2394), retracted articles (15), and manually found duplicates (586). Eligibility screening
included 112 articles. Finally, 23 papers were eligible, in addition to, 12 papers added manually
of which (14) entered in meta-analysis. Figure 1 shows the PRISMA flowchart of the selection
process.
Study Characteristics
Out of the fourteen studies entered into the meta-analysis, (2) studies were RCT (1) and
non-RCT (3) case-control, and (8) retro or prospective cohort, of which, HCQ arms of the
comparative studies have been combined with observational studies for effect size meta-analysis.
The studies’ sample size ranged from (30 to 1438) participants. Characteristics of studies entered
into the systematic review presented in Table 1.
Quality Assessment
Results of quality assessment for studies entered into a meta-analysis using Jadad,
ROBINS-I, and NOS checklists were reported in the summary of the risk of bias has presented in
Figure 2.
Publication Bias
Publication bias assessment was conducted by visual inspection of the funnel plot. (22)

Hydroxychloroquine Versus Standard Care
Fever
A total of three studies that evaluated body temperature normalization after HCQ therapy;
Huang et al,(3) reported that body temperature returned normal after a geometric mean
(coefficient variation), 1.2 (53.5) among HCQ group versus 1.9 (110.0) among non HCQ (P=
0.0029), while J.chen et al, (13) reported that patients’ temperatures returned to normal at
approximately the same rate in both groups. (Median 1, IQR 0-2 for HCQ and Median 1, IQR 03 for no-HQR). Z. Chen et al,(27) reported that the duration of fever was shorter in the HCQ
group (mean 2.0±0.2) than in the non-HCQ group (mean 3.1±1.5).
Cough
Z. Chen et al, (27) reported that 15 of 31 (48.39%) of the control patients and 22 of 31
(70.97%) intervention patients had reported cough resolution. This difference was statistically
significant P= 0.0016
Laboratory Test Improvement
Two studies evaluated the change in laboratory test after exposure to HCQ, first Mallat et
al,(44) reported that median lymphocyte count at day 7 was 1870 (1115-2625) compared to its
baseline 1890 (1430-2230) in the control group, while it was 1650 (980-1950) at day 7 in the
intervention group compared to its baseline level 1650(980-1950). Additionally, median serum
ferritin level day 7 was 398 (52-1030) compared to its baseline 292 (33-1085) in the control
group, while it was 249 (130-614) at day 7 in the intervention group compared to its baseline
level 165 (63-320). Barbosa et al,(43) reported that change in Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio
was higher in HCQ (9.55±21.5) versus standard care (1.58±6.26) but this increase was not

significant. Similarly, the change in absolute lymphocyte count was not statistically significant
between both groups (-0.61±0.52 of HCQ group vs -0.61±0.38 standard care).
Hospital Stay
The duration of the hospital stay of patients of the standard care group was significantly
shorter than in the HCQ/CQ group (summary std. mean difference was 0.57, CI, 0.20-0.94). Of
the four included studies, three studies favored the standard care with std. mean difference
ranging from (0.50-1.19). The heterogeneity of the included studies was as follows (I2=92%, p
<0.01). (Figure 3). In the sensitivity analysis, M. Huang, 2020 contributed most to heterogeneity.
Excluding this study made the overall effect relatively higher (Z=12.33, P<0.000) and the test of
heterogeneity was not significant (P = 0.54, I2=0%) (Figure 4)

there were no significant differences between the HCQ group and the standard care group in
terms of the time for PCR to turn negative (RR: 0.05, 95% CI, -1.32-1.42). The measured
heterogeneity was statistically significant I2=98%, P < 0.01. (Figure 5). Sensitivity analysis
revealed that M. Huang, 2020 contributed most to heterogeneity. By the Exclusion of this study,
the heterogeneity between the rest of the studies was insignificant (P=0.45, I2= 48%). Moreover,
pooled std. mean turned to be significantly shorter in standard care groups (Z=2.32, P=0.02)
(Figure 6).

Virological cure rate. To get more insight over the virological cure, we were able to find
two studies that analyzed the virological cure rate on day 4, two studies analyzed it on day 10,
and three analyzed it on day 14. There were no differences between the HCQ group and the
standard care group [(RR: 1.11, 95% CI, 0.26-4.69), (RR: 1.21, 95% CI, 0.70-2.10), and (RR:

Worsening of Clinical Symptoms
Five studies evaluated the differences between the HCQ or CQ group and the standard care
group in terms of clinical worsening. The meta-analysis showed there were no differences between
the HCQ group and the standard care group regarding the worsening of clinical symptoms (RR:

Need for Mechanical Ventilation
The need for MV was reported in five studies in both the HCQ group (118/1395) and the
standard care group (156/1617). Two studies reported more need for mechanical ventilation
among the standard care group, (rang of individual RR is 1.03-18.17, 95% CI). In the analysis,
there was no significant difference between both groups (summary RR = 1.50, 95% CI, 0.782.89) as shown in (Figure 17). The test of heterogeneity was statistically significant I2=81%,

QT Prolongation
Many studies have evaluated the effect of HCQ in inducing QT prolongation; Chong et al.
demonstrated that 45.5% of patients exposed to HCQ developed QT prolongation. On the same
vein, Broek et al, (37) noticed that 23% of CQ patients developed significant QT prolongation
(˃500msec). Voisin et al, (38) reported that of 50 patients treated with HCQ+AZM; 6 patients
stopped the treatment due to significant QT prolongation, and 8 patients and 38 patients (76 %)
presented short term modifications of QTc duration (meaning > 30 ms). The same figure was
reported by Ramireddy et al. (42) and Saleh et al.,(55) who reported that there is no difference
regarding QT prolongation between patients treated with CQ or HCQ. Moreover, combination
with AZM increased the risk of QT prolongation as (470.4±45.0 ms) versus monotherapy
(453.3±37.0 ms), P=0.004. This increase in QT prolongation was incriminated in discontinuation
of treatment in 3.5% of the studied patients. On the other hand, Rosenberg et al,(35) reported a
lower incidence of QT prolongation among patients treated with a combination of HCQ+AZM
versus HCQ alone (11.0% vs 14.4%) respectively. Finally, Chang et al., (57)reported that 17.9%
of patients treated with HCQ± AZN had QT prolongation ˃ 500 m-second. The prolongation of
QT after administration of HCQ+AZM or HCQ alone was not significantly different.
Mortality
Mortality was addressed in 8 studies and controversial results were seen. B. Yu et al,(39)
FJ and Membrillo et al (51) showed that there is more mortality in the standard care groups in
comparison to the HCQ. While, Rosenberg et al and Magagnoli et al,(41) showed that there was
more mortality in those who did receive HCQ. It is worthy to mention that, `among the 20
patients included in the study of Guatret et al, (14) 6 patients were on AZM In the analysis there
was no significant difference between the two groups with RR of 0.99, 95% CI 0.61, 1.59 as

shown in Figure 20. Leave one out sensitivity analysis revealed a considerable heterogeneity at
all stages of the studies. All studies nearly equally contributed to the overall heterogeneity.
Hence, meta-regression was needed to underline the possible effect of covariates. The risk of
mortality was regressed considering mean or median age, country, percentage of male patients,
and severity of illness as regressors. Age was not a significant predictor (P=0.323) as the mean or
median age was above 60 years across all selected studies except for P. Gautret, et al., study (14)
in which the median age of the participant was 45 years. Moreover, the severity of illness was
not significant (P=0.105) as the patients in almost all selected studies were hospitalized with
varied clinical status except for B. Yu, et al,(39) in which the patients were all critically ill.
Interestingly, the country of the study was a significant predictor for the risk of mortality at two
levels (France and USA) setting for China (B. Yu, 2020) as a reference country. Switching from
Chinese to French studies increases the relative risk of mortality in HCQ groups by 7.28 times
(P=0.001) concerning SC groups. Similarly, switching from Chinese to American studies
increased the relative risk of mortality in HCQ groups by 4.29 times (P=0.005). By Metaregression, the overall heterogeneity of selected studies was not significant (0.243, I2=22%).

Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin Combination Versus Standard Care
Duration of Hospital Stay
The duration of hospital stay in case of treatment with (HCQ + AZM) combination versus
standard care was reported in two studies. In the analysis, we found a significant difference
between both groups where the (HCQ + AZM) combination group had the longer mean hospital
stay among COVID 19 treated patients. The pooled Std. mean was 0.77, 95% CI, 0.46-1.08). The
heterogeneity was statistically significant, P < 0.01, I2=92% (Figure 22).

DISCUSSION
Based on the finding of this meta-analysis, the treatment of COVID-19 patients with
HCQ was associated with a longer duration of hospital stay, whether or not AZM was included
in the treatment regimen. Regarding the difference in viral clearance between HCQ and standard
care, time to negative conversion was not statistically different between the two groups (HCQ
and standard care). Similarly, virological cure at either day 4, day 10, or day 14 was not different
between both groups. It is worthy to mention that adding AZM to HCQ did not affect the cure
rate versus standard care. Generally, exposure to HCQ alone or in combination with AZM
wasn’t associated with the need for mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, neither clinical
worsening nor radiological improvement of the studied patients was changed concurrently with
exposure to HCQ. Side effects were more encountered if patients were exposed to HCQ, finally,
the mortality of the HCQ group was not different from that of standard care. The country of
residency was a significant predictor of mortality outcomes. The alarming finding was that the
standard care had reported lower numbers of mortalities if they were compared to the AZM and
HCQ combination group.
Fever and Cough
Resolution of respiratory symptoms and fever is one of the symptoms-based indicators of
disease recovery. In this study, we evaluated the recovery of these two symptoms after exposure
to HCQ. (58) Huang et al, and Z. Chen et al demonstrated that patients treated with CQ recover
from fever faster than those on standard care, however, J.Chen did not report any significant
difference between both groups in the resolution of fever. Z. Chen et al reported a more
significant resolution of cough among patients exposed to HCQ. Due to insufficient data, we did
not conduct a meta-analysis.

QT Prolongation
Abnormal myocardial repolarization results in QT interval prolongation. The normal QT
interval is 470 ms in females, and 450 ms in males. )59( Among patients treated with HCQ, QT

prolongation was identified in 23%-45.5%. (28, 37) . About 12% of patients on AZM and HCQ
stopped treatment due to significant QT prolongation. It is important to notice that there is no
difference in the incidence of drug-induced QT prolongation by CQ or HCQ. A combination of
HCQ and AZM increases the risk, however, Rosenberg et al, reported a lower occurrence of QT
among patients received this combination versus standard care. (35)
Duration of Hospital Stay of HCQ ± AZM versus Standard Care
Adoption of either CQ/HCQ alone or in combination with AZM did not significantly
shorten the duration of hospital stay. Patients on the standard care stay shorter in the hospital
either if they compared to patient received CQ/HCQ (standard mean difference 0.54, 95%
C10.20-0.94) or HCQ+AZM (standard mean difference 0.77, 95%CI 0.46-1.08) the reported
heterogeneity of the CQ/HCQ study was 92% that dropped to 0% if the study of Huang was
removed. While the heterogeneity of HCQ+AZM analysis was 81%
Virological Cure Rate of CQ/HCQ ±AZM Versus Standard Care
In the current research, the achieved cure rate of HCQ (day 4, 10, and 14), and time to
negative conversion among the HCQ group were not statistically different from the standard
care. It is worthy to mention that, the term standard care was not firmly defined in each study,
this may represent a source of prescription bias. Another important finding was that the pooled
standard mean difference included the paper published by Huang et al, (3) this research resulted in
significant heterogeneity in many outcomes especially time till virological cure. When we
adopted the leave one sensitivity analysis the time to negative conversion became significantly
shorter in the control arm.

Similarly, the virological cure rate of HCQ and AZM combination did not significantly
differ from the cure rate of the standard care. This finding is similar to the result reported by
Shamshirian et al,.(60) In this study they included the study conducted by Maganogli et al, (41) in
evaluating the effectiveness of HCQ+AZM combination. By reviewing this article, we found that
the authors did not address the effectiveness of this combination versus standard care. (41).
Radiological Improvement and Clinical Worsening
Treatment with HCQ did not provide any additional benefit in terms of radiological
improvement or clinical worsening versus the standard care. We included three published articles
in this analysis of the impact of HCQ on radiological improvement and five articles evaluating
the effect of CQ/HCQ on clinical worsening. The heterogeneity of both analyses was 45% and
54% respectively.
Need for Mechanical Ventilation of AZM+HCQ versus Standard Care
The need for mechanical ventilation was evaluated in our study in case of treatment with
HCQ and (HCQ+AZM) combination compared to the standard treatment group. In our study, we
included 5 studies in the comparison between HCQ and standard care, we analyzed the effect of
(HCQ +AZM) combination in 4 studies and in both analyses no significant difference was found
indicating that the use HCQ either alone or in combination with AZM for treatment of COVID
19 did not reduce the need for MV. Our results are in agreement with Shamshirian et al. (60) who
published an MA of two studies addressing the need for MV among HCQ and standard care.
Side Effects
In this meta-analysis, we included three published pieces of research that address the
reported side effects of HCQ treatment. Patients on HCQ treatment had a higher risk of

experiencing side effects, (pooled RR=3.14, 95% CI 1.58-6.24) with I2 of 0%. The reported side
effects were diarrhea, headache, rash, elevated transaminases, fatigue, and anemia.
Mortality HCQ and AZM
In the current research, the Mortality rate of HCQ alone did not significantly differ from
the cure rate of standard care. This was similar to what is reported by Shamshirian et al, (60)who
almost included the same studies in his meta-analysis. The heterogeneity of this analysis was
high so we conducted a sensitivity analysis to identify the source of heterogeneity. All studies
contributed nearly equal to the reported heterogeneity, so we carried out meta-regression
analysis. In Meta-regression analysis, the heterogeneity dropped to 22% and we identified that
country was a strong predictor of mortality. One of the alarming findings was that the mortality
of the HCQ and AZM was significantly higher than the standard care (pooled RR= 1.81, 95% CI
1.19-2.77). The heterogeneity of this analysis was (I2= 71%).
Limitation
Our analysis must be interpreted in the context of the limitations of the available data;
despite the huge number of published articles during the COVID-19 pandemic, many of these
studies lack a good quality and may contain inconsistent results. In fact, there is an urgent need
for high-quality randomized control trials that address the issue of HCQ treatment.
Consequently, we depended on our analysis of the few published or even cited preprints.
Moreover, we included many observational studies due to the scarcity of randomized control
trials. It is well established that observational studies cannot discover causality. This fact also
contributed to the highly found heterogeneity of analysis especially for the study of Haung
(2020). (3) After leaving one sensitivity analysis the heterogeneity drops to acceptable value in
many outcomes. Another important source of bias in patient selection bias; as some studies did

not classify patients according to their disease’s severity. This source of bias may significantly
affect the course of illness. Differences in HCQ and AZM in dose, duration of treatment, and
route of administration may also affect the consistency of our results.
Conclusion
HCQ prolonged the duration of hospital stay and did not increase the overall virological
cure or more specifically on days 4, 10, or 14. In addition, it did not affect duration till
conversion to negative PCR, need for MV, radiological progression, clinical worsening of the
disease, or death. Furthermore, treatment with AZM and HCQ did not affect the virological
cure, the need for MV. However, it increased the duration of hospital stay and mortality. Future
randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm these conclusions.
