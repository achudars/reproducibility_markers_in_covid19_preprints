Abstract
Background: Isolation space must be expanded during pandemics involving airborne transmission.
Little to no work has been done to establish optimal design strategies and implementation plans to
ease surge capacity and expand isolation capacity over long periods in congregate living facilities.
The COVID-19 pandemic has an airborne transmission component and requires isolation, which
is difficult to accomplish in skilled nursing facilities.
Purpose: In this study we designed, implemented, and validated an isolation space at a skilled
nursing facility in Lancaster, PA. The overall goal was to minimize disease transmission between
residents and staff within the facility.
Basic Procedures: We created an isolation space by modifying an existing HVAC system of the
SNF. We measured pressure on-site and performed computational fluid dynamics and Lagrangian
particle-based modeling to test containment and possible transmission extent given the isolation
space is considered negative rather than individual rooms.
Main Findings: Pressure data shows the isolation space maintained an average hourly value of
(standard deviation) -2.3 Pa (0.12 Pa) pressure differential between it and the external hallway
connected to the rest of the facility. No transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between residents isolated
to the space occurred, nor did any transmission to the staff or other residents occur. The isolation
space was successfully implemented and, as of writing, continues to be operational through the
pandemic.

Background
It was estimated that in the US there were 15,600 nursing homes in 2016 and 1.3 million residents
(NCHS 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on skilled nursing
facilities (SNFs): about 20% of the US virus deaths are linked to SNFs to date. Some states have
experienced, and continue to have, significant outbreaks in SNFs (McMichael et al. 2020). An
outbreak in Washington demonstrated that much of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the
facility was likely due to asymptomatic cases (Aarons et al. 2020). On March 23, it was reported
that there were at least 146 nursing homes across 27 states with confirmed Coronavirus cases
(CMS 2020); a week later, on March 30, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
had reported more than 400 facilities with infected residents. The CDC recently released guidelines
for preparing for COVID-19 in long-term care facilities and nursing homes (CDC 2020a). In this
guidance, it is recommended that a cohort space in the facility be identified to care for residents
with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2.
The two main routes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are contact with contaminated surfaces and
inhalation of airborne virus-containing respiratory particles. The virus has been detected by PCR
in the air and on surfaces in several healthcare environments (Chia et al. 2020; Ding et al. 2020,
Guo et al. 2020; Jiang et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020; Lednicky et al. 2020). A study from Wuhan
reported that SARS-CoV-2 contaminated surfaces including floors and air in an intensive care unit
and a general ward of a hospital (Guo et al. 2020). Virus-laden aerosols were concentrated near
and downstream from patients at up to 4 m. Lednicky et al. collected positive air samples from
more than 2 m away from the nearest patients in a student healthcare center (Lednicky et al. 2020).
Outbreaks have also been reported at restaurants, fitness gyms, churches, and festivals (Lu et al.
2020; Nishiura et al. 2020; Pung et al. 2020).
The risk due to airborne transmission necessitates additional controls. Negative pressure isolation
spaces are a well-established approach to reduce airborne transmission and guidelines for design
and operation have been provided (ASHRAE 2008; Facility Guidelines Institute 2014). Airborne
infection isolation rooms are commonly used for obligate airborne infectious disease containment
such as tuberculosis. Considering the scale of COVID-19 outbreak, establishing and maintaining
effective negative pressure spaces within congregate healthcare facilities to handle surges of
patients form a critical piece for healthcare operations and outbreak management. Recent
recommendations from the CDC for infection prevention and control for COVID-19 patients in
healthcare settings include isolation recommendations and airborne isolation room use for patients
undergoing aerosol-generating procedures (CDC 2020b).
Prior work on surge capacity included a demonstration that converted a 30-bed hospital ward to
an airborne infection isolation area, in anticipation of a flu pandemic (Miller et al. 2017). This
demonstration showed that -30 Pa could be achieved and maintained for 24 hours and the anteroom
could be rapidly established; the workers on the ward however had to wear personal protective

equipment due to the change in airflow and pressures within the ward. Additional guidelines for
creating temporary negative-pressure or other protective environments have been summarized
(Rebmann 2005).
To reduce airborne infection risk, the approach from Miller et al. (2017) was applied to a SNF in
Lancaster, PA. In this paper, we describe the design and outcomes of establishing this negative
pressure isolation space in one ward of the SNF. Systematic modifications were made to existing
building HVAC units. These modifications were not resource intensive and were rapidly
established. Continuous pressure differential measurements and computational modeling were
used to validate the isolation space performance with respect to containment of airborne particles.
With a simple anteroom set-up and quick HVAC unit modifications, we were able to maintain
continuous negative pressure and contained airflow for a period of 14 days, and the negative
pressure area continues to operate.

Materials and Methods
Study Area
The study was conducted at a Life Plan Community located on a knoll at an elevation of 146 m in
Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Residential living, personal care, and skilled nursing care units
are located within the community. The total campus census at the beginning of the study was 349
residents and 320 staff. The SNF had 114 beds and represented 96 of these residents. One hall
was the subject of this study. This hall was on the bottom floor of a wing of a larger building
containing administrative offices and the SNF with two floors, each consisting of four wings
totaling eight skilled nursing halls. This building adjoined personal care and apartment residential
units. The hall selected for conversion into a negative pressure isolation space previously
functioned as a short-term rehabilitation area adjacent to a nursing station. Positioned on the
facility’s rear, this hall’s advantageous design eased resident relocation and included a series of
fire doors separating it from other interior parts of the larger building. The hall is oriented northsouth, with external doors on the north end and a nursing station at the south end. Winds
predominate from the west. Recorded outdoor wind speeds average 16 kph, but do not typically
exceed 48 kph as recorded from the facility's weather station.

Baseline Hall Configuration
The hall used in this study consisted of 13 beds within 7 rooms, six double occupancy rooms (32.537.2 m2) and one single occupancy room (27.0 m2). The architectural design of the isolation hall
is presented in Figure 1 (left panel). Each room had a single bathroom. The single occupancy
room included an anteroom containing a separate sink and medical cabinet. Rooms had a sealed
solid glass window facing the hall (100 cm tall x 50 cm wide) and an exterior window (1.85 m tall
x 1.35 m wide). Heating and cooling were self-contained in each room with designated units, fans,
and air ducts. During normal operations, vents (10.2 cm x 10.2 cm) located in the bathrooms

handled exhaust, which fed into ducting centered over the hall and conducted air toward the
extremity of the hall to an Energy Recovery Ventilator (ERV) in a mechanical room. Incoming
outdoor ventilation passed across the hall-designated ERV located in a mechanical room. This
incoming air crossed a preconditioning unit followed by heating and cooling coils before passing
down the hall to be distributed by vents located centrally along the hall (10.2 cm x10.2 cm) and
above the door of each room (29.2 cm x 8.9 cm). The duct handling the incoming outdoor
ventilation contained three 15-watt germicidal RCI ultraviolet (UV) Hg cells covering up to 189
m2. This HVAC design was similar in all halls of the building during normal operations.

isolation space (top view), with all patient rooms and entryways clearly identified. Vent locations are
identified using square markers in appropriate locations. Left panel outlines the modified air handling
system operating at 100% exhaust mode, showing how each blower connects to the vents in the isolation
space.

HVAC Modifications to Create Isolation Space
The HVAC and plastic barrier modifications were begun on April 2 and completed four days later
on April 6. An overview of the modified air handling operations is presented in Figure 1 (right
panel). Modifications were made to enhance the normal exhaust pattern by adding two new 0.43
m3/s (920 CFM) blowers within the ERV. Incoming outdoor ventilation fan was turned off using
a breaker. A 0.51-m 2.12 m3/s (4500 CFM) exhaust fan was mounted to the outside of the intake
grate on the east side of the building traditionally reserved for incoming outdoor ventilation, thus
reversing the flow of air and converting the hall to 100% exhaust. To increase the exhausting of
air within the hall, the preconditioning unit of the ERV was removed and the fire damper, located
above the fire door, was closed within the ventilation system. Originally, HEPA filters were placed
in the ERV, but due to restricted air flow these units proved prohibitive. The solution was to use
Minimum Efficiency Reporting 8 filters and cordon off a 15.2-m radius around the exhaust vent

on the east side. A long-term solution to purchase a germicidal UV light to be fitted into the ERV
or mount HEPA filters to the exhausting air flows had yet to be completed.

Anteroom Design
Located at the front of the hall and across the double fire doors, two sets of 3-sheet plastic barriers
were installed constructing a temporary anteroom. The anteroom measured 2.4 m x 4.5 m in length.
The fire door remained operational through the duration of this study. The barriers consisted of
three overlapping sections of 152-micron plastic measuring 1.5 m x 2.5 m attached to the wall and
ceiling using wood lathe. The barriers were rolled at the bottom just above carpet level and taped
at the sides to identify separations for HCP access. The anteroom contained a 240 clean-airdelivery rate high-efficiency-particulate-air purifier fitted with 0.1-m ductwork to exhaust air into
the hallway and toward the extremity of the wing (see for ref. Figure 1, left panel). A cascade of
negative pressure zones with respect to both the isolation space (treatment hall), anteroom and the
rest of the SNF was thus created.
Housekeeping staff was isolated from the hall with deliveries of linens being made to the anteroom.
All housekeeping materials (i.e. vacuum, cleaning materials) were designated to the isolation wing
and were not transported outside of negative isolation space. These items were stored within a
laundering room located within the negative isolation space. The nursing staff was responsible for
housekeeping tasks. A large waste collection container located outside the stairwell exit serviced
the isolation wing so materials would not be transported through the building. Waste and laundry
were both double bagged. Laundry was double bagged in dissolvable bags and removed from the
anteroom daily. Donning and doffing of nursing personal protective equipment was done just
outside the anteroom on the isolation side due to the need to reuse and clean PPE thus keeping the
anteroom clean space. Pressure measurement equipment was located in an attached mechanical
room within and adjacent to the anteroom.
During the initial testing of the system, winds were clocked by the onsite weather station at 33.8
kph. This data was supported by a national weather service automated observing station at a local
airport. These winds had a significant effect on the exhaust fans and the overall ability to maintain
negative pressure. Because of the capacity of this wind to generate a compromising positive
pressure within the hall, a stairwell was selected for all resident entrances and exits from the wing.
The design of the stairwell allowed the use of two separate doors, one to the outside and one to the
hall in an air-lock type arrangement. This stairwell later served as an anteroom for donning and
doffing PPE for visitors prior to entering the hall upon admission. Thus, patients and visitors could
be admitted through the stairwell rear entrance to the negative pressure space. This designated
entrance decreased the possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure of the broader facility.

Pressure Measurements
Continuous measurement of pressure differentials was conducted through dates 05/14-05/21 using
an Energy Conservatory (TEC) DG-700 dual-channel differential pressure instrument. Primary

pressure differential measurements were taken: (a) between the anteroom interior and a nursing
station located outside the anteroom away from the isolation space; and (b) between a location
inside the isolation space close to anteroom entry and the anteroom interior. A set of secondary
pressure differential measurements were included in the study in form of periodic spot-checks,
where pressure differential was recorded between the anteroom and a location outside the building.
The measurements during the study period were supplemented with an additional set of
measurements spanning a 72-hour period during 05/23-05/25, where pressure differential was
recorded between the nursing station outside the isolation space, and outside the building.

Computational Fluid Dynamics Modeling
A computational fluid dynamics model was set up for evaluating air flow and negative pressure
generation based on the HVAC modifications. The model was based on the finite volume method,
using the cloud-based software suite SimScale (https://www.simscale.com). Full scale computer
solid model of the entire isolation space ward was created using the web based CAD package
OnShape (https://www.onshape.com), which was further discretized into a hex-dominant
numerical grid. Based on built in SimScale modules, a steady compressible flow solver was setup using the k-omega model for turbulence, to model the flow of air throughout the isolation space.
Air handling vents in the patient rooms and along the hallway were modeled using velocity outlet
boundary conditions. All vent boundary conditions were derived using reduced order volumetric
flow distribution calculations (see supplementary material). Narrow slits were included at the
anteroom entry, and the stairwell doors opposite the mechanical room, which were also modeled
as pressure inlet boundary conditions. Lastly, a set of pressure inflow boundary conditions were
assigned to each patient room window, modelled also as narrow slits, to account for infiltration
airflow. Resultant fluid flow velocity and pressure field data were then used to drive a Lagrangian
particle-based model for simulating viral particle dynamics within the isolation ward. A fixed
number concentration of viral particles was released at various locations in the isolation space, and
their trajectories and final locations over a 4-5-minute window were computed. Additional details
regarding aspects of the computational methodology are included in supplementary materials.

Results
Measured Pressure Differentials Showed Sustained Negative Pressure
The measured pressure differentials between: (a) anteroom and outside the isolation space; as well
as (b) between inside the isolation space and the anteroom; reveal sustained continuous negative
pressures into the isolation space across the anteroom throughout the duration of the study. Hourly
median values for pressure differentials (a) an (b) above centered around -1.27 Pa (std. dev.: 0.1
Pa) and -1.05 Pa (std. dev.: 0.16 Pa) respectively. Figure 2 illustrates the measured pressure
differential across the anteroom entry into the isolation space. The bottom panel represents an
hourly max-min envelope for one of the observation dates (May 21). Specifically, the median
values of all observations within one hour are represented using the solid line, while the shaded

region presents the upper and lower bounds. Median hourly pressure differentials for each
observation date for both (a) and (b) above are presented on Figure 2 top panels. These exclude
the spot-check measurements of pressure differentials as described in the Methods. All median
pressure differentials are negative, implying the isolation space is at a lower pressure than the
anteroom, thereby preventing any air flow out from the isolation space towards the anteroom and
rest of the facility. Sporadic positive pressure differentials were observed during the study, which
explains the upper bound in Figure 2, bottom panel, being positive for certain hours during the
day. This is likely due to movement of healthcare workers and staff across the anteroom and
opening/closing of anteroom entry for access into the isolation space. These measurements are
further supported by on-site observations that the anteroom plastic sheet entryway remained
continuously curved inwards into the isolation space, indicating pressure on the anteroom side to
be higher than on the isolation space side.

Computational Model Validated Measured Negative Pressure
A pressure differential was computed from the CFD simulation data with reference to the pressure
at the anteroom entry, based on measured pressure data across the isolation space. Spatial variation
of this computed pressure differential throughout the isolation space is visualized in Figure 3, along
a slice taken midway through the height of the isolation space, viewed from the top. The data
presented here assumed that all patient room doors were open, but the anteroom entryway was
operational (as described earlier), and the stairwell doors at the end of the hallway as well as all
windows were closed. Values of the computed pressure differential are also presented in Figure 3
(bottom) along a line spanning the entire length of the isolation space hallway (colored based on
flow velocity magnitudes). Since the pressure measurement probe inside the isolation space was
placed close to the anteroom entry, we used the obtained pressure differential values close to the
anteroom entry for cross-validation with measured data. The computed pressure differential values
show excellent agreement with measured pressure differential values as shown in Figure 2 (top
right panel) in form of distribution of hourly median pressure differential measurements for each
of the observation dates. It is also observed from Figure 3 that the pressure distribution has
significant variations spatially across the isolation space. However, so long as the pressure
differential across the anteroom entry into the isolation space remains negative, the airflow remains
unidirectional into (and not out of) the isolation space, creating effective containment.

integration convolution (LIC), which clearly shows flow velocity magnitudes (in the range 0.1-0.5 m/s)
as well as local circulation patterns. Flow is visualized along the same mid-section as in Figure 3.

Modeling Further Elucidated Air Flow and Viral Particle Transport Patterns
Results from computational modeling provided additional insights into the air flow pattern within
the isolation space and indicated possible modes of viral particle transport across the rooms and
hallway. Figure 4 presents the flow velocity magnitudes and local circulation patterns across the
slice taken midway through the height of the isolation space (same as in Figure 3), for the scenario
where all room doors are open. The flow pattern is visualized using line integration convolution
(LIC), which concurrently illustrates flow magnitudes as well as local vortex cores. Slow flow
velocities in the order of 0.1-0.5 m/s span the entire hallway with local circulatory flow regions
influenced by the layout of the isolation space, the operation of air handling and HVAC systems,
and infiltration from the windows. Figure 5 shows results from two sets of numerical experiments
on viral particle transport. For the first experiment (Case A), particles are released in three of the
patient rooms, and for the second experiment (Case B), particles are released at two locations along
the hallway. With all patient room doors kept open, these experiments show the extent to which
released particles can spread in the isolation space - from one room into another, as well as from
the rooms into the hallway and vice versa. Results shown in Figure 5 illustrate that when patient
room doors are open, viral particles may spread from room to room, as well as into the hallway –
possibly affecting other patients and healthcare workers. Additionally, viral particles shed in the
hallway may infiltrate into patient rooms. These observations indicate that despite establishment
of isolation space via sustained negative pressures, careful observation of protective measures
within the isolation space (as conducted in this study) remains critical to prevent viral transmission
amongst healthcare workers. We note that here we have not accounted for detailed and coupled
flow through the ductways. Consequently, any particle that exits from the vent into the ductway
are considered to be ‘removed’ from the simulation. In future studies we intend to resolve this
further to improve accuracy of viral particle transmission estimates.

space. Case A (left panel) shows scenarios where particles are released within patient rooms. Case B
(right panel) shows scenarios where particles are released in the hallway. Release locations are marked

Isolation Space Was Successful in Preventing Any Form of Transmission
The negative pressure isolation space was established April 6, 2020. Experimentation and data
collection began May 14, 2020. Census data during our study showed between 2-4 known SARSCoV-2 patients resided within the isolation space for the duration of the study. A designated team
of healthcare workers were assigned to task the negative pressure space. The workers consisted
of nursing staff (RNs, LPNs, CNAs), physical therapy staff, a respiratory therapist, and a nurse
practitioner. While some of the nursing staff exclusively worked in the isolation space, they did
have significant contact at shared nursing stations outside of the space with those working off the
unit. The therapy staff and nurse practitioner worked throughout the facility. The nurse practitioner
conducted the SARS-CoV-2 testing. Staff entering the negative pressure space were provided PPE
training in donning and doffing directed by the respiratory therapist and completed over two days.
Goggles, N95 masks, and gowns were issued to staff entering the isolation space. Nursing care of
these residents ranged from vital signs q4h through asymptomatic. Over the study admissions and
discharges occurred. The facility received its first known positive COVID-19 patient as a hospital
transfer on April 8. From that date onward, and over the course of this study, the facility acquired
no known positive results within its own population. None of the healthcare workers assigned to
work the isolation space while treating or in proximity to COVID-19 patients presented with
symptoms or tested positive thereafter.
According to the Pennsylvania Department of Health, as of June 23, 2020, of the 80,810 reported
cases in Pennsylvania 17,394 resident cases and 3,103 worker cases were reported with 4467
deaths in 671 facilities. Facilities consisted of both personal care and long-term care communities.
The total number of cases in Lancaster County on June 23 was 988 resident and 286 worker cases
with 251 deaths (2020, June 23). As of June 23, the isolation space has consistently maintained a
population of known COVID-19 residents ranging from between 2 and 6 individuals. Residents
are routinely treated and discharged from the isolation space after negative test results are acquired.
As of June 23, 14 confirmed (PCR testing) SARS-CoV-2 residents had been treated in the negative
isolation space established in this study, and the facility had utilized the isolation space for a total
of 21 individuals. These additional individuals had been quarantined prior to the widespread
availability and access to testing, in the isolation space as suspected cases. At the time, these
individuals represented a possible transmission to the facility due to external exposure at another
facility such as a hospital. None of the quarantined individuals transferred from the isolation space,
with stays lasting between 2-14 days, later tested positive or presented symptoms. One individual
that was suspected and placed in isolation space quarantine tested positive on day 10. According
to the PA DOH this individual was not considered as facility onset. The PA-HAN-509 Facilityonset SARS-CoV-2 does not include infections in residents with known exposure outside of the
nursing home or those that become positive within 14 days after admission, when placed into
Transmission-Based Precautions. The placement of this individual into transmission-based
precautions, which in this study included the negative isolation space, represented a significant
role the isolation space played in mitigating possible transmission of the virus within the facility.

Discussion
Skilled Nursing Facilities offer available surge capacity under pandemic scenarios. Elderly
patients require significant and disproportionate health services within a regional health network
(Institute of Medicine, 2008). In addition, treating nursing home residents in place offers
considerable advantages due to the risk/benefit decisions surrounding transfer and admission to
emergency departments (EDs). The transition of older adults from a nursing home setting to the
hospital involves significant challenges surrounding structured communication between nursing
homes and EDs. These issues involve, but are not limited to, cognitive impairment, missing
documentation involving baseline cognition, and goals of care (Levine, 2020; Hustey, 2010). The
implementation of a negative pressure isolation space within a SNF alleviates hospital admissions
and staffing loads, thus generating surge capacity without jeopardizing healthcare standards
associated with transfers. Previous studies in nursing homes during outbreaks have identified
lower culture confirmed influenza A (H3N2) cases where unique ventilation and increased space
per resident exists (Drinka 1996).
Nursing home providers often have access to knowledgeable professionals including respiratory
therapists available to direct and train staff in effective PPE procedures. Beyond the availability of
skilled nursing staff familiar with resident behaviors and treatments, many existing SNFs are
architecturally designed according to hospital models with rooms branching off central, hospitallike corridors with corresponding HVAC systems. As such, we predict that an in-house
modification to an established HVAC system will be able to sustain negative pressures that meet
or exceed CDC guidelines as previously reported in hospital modifications (Miller et al. 2017).
Modifications to existing infrastructure can typically be less resource-intensive and can be rapidly
conducted with existing expertise and promptly utilized. Full-scale computational modeling can
be used to evaluate efficacy of such modifications, and validate sustained negative pressures, as
demonstrated here.
Within the negative pressure area that we designed the staff will need to wear PPE, due to the
possibility of positive pressures within rooms and hallways. Additional design and testing is
needed to address this concern and strategies include increasing exhaust airflow from the
bathrooms to maintain a negative pressure within the bathroom and patient room, install upperroom germicidal ultraviolet lights within the area to inactivate any airborne virus, and use of air
purifiers to exhaust air from each room to the outdoors.

Conclusions
We implemented a negative pressure isolation space within a SNF to contain SARS-CoV-2
transmission, by modifying existing HVAC systems. Our modifications were able to achieve and
sustain negative pressures generating an ideal isolation unit for the residents with confirmed
COVID-19 disease within the nursing facility. Consistency between both on-site measurements

and modeling simulations confirm the efficacy of planned modifications to the HVAC system to
sustain negative pressures that meet or exceed CDC guidelines. Furthermore, the community
benefited from the expansion of available health services and decreased community spread in
facilities that lacked sufficient mitigation strategies. Residents avoided the stress associated with
transfers to and from emergency facilities. Thus, the resulting isolation space operated successfully
through the ongoing pandemic.
