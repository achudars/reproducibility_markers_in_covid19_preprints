Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), has currently infected over 6.5 million people worldwide. In response
to the pandemic, numerous studies have tried to identify causes and symptoms of the disease.
Emerging evidence supports recently acquired anosmia (complete loss of smell) and hyposmia
(partial loss of smell) as symptoms of COVID-19, but studies of olfactory dysfunction show a
wide range of prevalence, from 5% to 98%. We undertook a search of Pubmed/Medline and
Google Scholar with the keywords “COVID-19,” “smell,” and/or “olfaction.” We included any
study that quantified olfactory loss as a symptom of COVID-19. Studies were grouped and
compared based on the type of method used to measure smell loss—subjective measures such as
self-reported smell loss versus objective measures using rated stimuli—to determine if
prevalence rate differed by method type. For each study, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were
calculated from point estimates of olfactory disturbance rates. We identified 34 articles
quantifying anosmia as a symptom of COVID-19, collected from cases identified from January
16 to April 30, 2020. The pooled prevalence estimate of smell loss was 77% when assessed
through objective measurements (95% CI of 61.4-89.2%) and 45% with subjective
measurements (95% CI of 31.1-58.5%). Objective measures are a more sensitive method to
identify smell loss as a result of infection with SARS-CoV-2; the use of subjective measures,
while expedient during the early stages of the pandemic, underestimates the true prevalence of
smell loss.

Objective vs subjective
Introduction
In December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease, coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that
originated in Wuhan, China, rapidly spread to almost every country worldwide. As of June 5,
2020, over 6.5 million cases have been identified and over 387,155 deaths have been attributed
to the virus (1). The most common symptoms of infection include fever, dry cough, and fatigue
(1). Other accepted symptoms include difficulty breathing, sore throat, headache, nasal
congestion, diarrhea, skin rash, and body aches and pains (1, 2). However, as knowledge about
the virus increased with more confirmed cases, reports of loss of smell and/or taste started to
arise. Other the past few months, COVID-19 research has investigated olfactory and taste
disturbances as potential symptoms of COVID-19 (3-5). Many of these disturbances include the
immediate onset of a complete loss of smell (anosmia) and/or taste (ageusia); other studies report
hyposmia, a reduction in perceived odor intensity. Therefore, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention and the World Health Organization officially included losses of smell and taste as
symptoms of COVID-19, though less prevalent than some other symptoms (1).
While olfactory loss is a common symptom of numerous viral respiratory infections (6),
recent reports suggest its prevalence rate might be higher with SARs-CoV-2 infection (7).
However, there is a wide reported range of olfactory disturbance prevalence, from 5% (8) to 98%
(9). Thus, there is a need to better quantify smell loss during the COVID-19 pandemic (10).
Differences in the reported values may be attributed to different recruiting and sampling
methodologies, the range of symptom severity across patients, and the amount of information
about COVID-19 available at the time of data collection (e.g., symptom recognition).

Objective vs subjective
However, different data collection techniques used by researchers and health care
professionals might also account for the different prevalence rates reported. There are two
general types of methods to measure smell loss: objective and subjective. Objective measures of
smell encompass psychophysical testing designed to measure and quantify human responses to
physical stimuli. Though sparsely used in COVID-19 research to date, current psychophysical
techniques encompass odor threshold tests to determine the lowest concentration of an odor that
can be detected, odor discrimination tests to measure the ability to differentiate between odors,
and odor identification tests, assessing the ability to correctly name odor qualities. When
possible, these tests are performed repeatedly over several days to measure changes in a patient's
smell abilities over time. Historically, these objective tests are often executed in a laboratory
setting, under surveillance of a researcher or health care professional, to ensure proper
completion. Examples of odor threshold tests in a COVID-19 population involve the use of
butanol or phenylethyl alcohol at different concentrations (11-13). The Sniffin’ Sticks test, an
odor discrimination and threshold test, is another method to quantify human olfactory
performance (14) used now in COVID-19 patients (15, 16). However, due to the global presence
of stay-at-home orders, many researchers have adapted these objective methods to enable testing
at home, by patients themselves, with common household odorants (5, 11).
A more common technique employed to quantify smell loss in the COVID-19 population
uses subjective methods, self-report through patient questionnaires or interview or the extraction
of symptomatic information from a patient's electronic health records (8, 17, 18). However,
collecting information from records can be prone to underestimation of smell loss due to an
initial lack of awareness that it is a symptom of COVID-19. Other subjective methods directly
ask patients about their own perceived sense of smell through an online questionnaire (7, 19),

over the phone (18), or in person with a doctor (20, 21). However, retrospective assessments
through self-report measures are often prone to recall bias (22). The present review provides a
comprehensive assessment of methodologies currently employed to quantify smell loss in
COVID-19–positive patients and examines whether method type affects reported prevalence of
smell loss in COVID-19 patients. Another recent systematic review examined the prevalence of
olfactory loss as a symptom in COVID-19; however, it contained data collected up until April
19, 2020, encompassed different inclusion criteria, included only 10 papers in its analysis, and
additionally examined gustatory dysfunction (23). Building on that prior meta-analysis, we
sought to compare differences in prevalence rates of smell loss collected via objective versus
subjective methods. We included any study that quantified smell loss as a symptom of COVID19, summarizing reports available up until June 5, 2020.
Methods
Article Selection: This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the PRISMA
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines (24). Figure 1
outlines the steps taken to select articles for inclusion in the meta-analysis. First,
Pubmed/Medline and Google Scholar were used to retrieve literature with the keyword “COVID19” plus “smell” and/or “olfaction” on May 15, 2020, and manual search of relevant articles via
Google Scholar was also performed on June 4, 2020, yielding a total of 78 articles.
Titles and abstracts were then screened for their relevance to the topic. Thirty-two articles
were initially excluded during the screening test if they were not about smell loss and COVID19,
did not report cases or percentage of patients with smell loss, or if they were not written In the
English language. If an abstract referenced a measure of prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in
COVID-19–positive patients, it was included in the pool of articles (n = 43). Full texts were then

Objective vs subjective
screened to confirm positive identification of COVID-19 in patients via a nasopharyngeal swab,
throat swab, RT-PCR–confirmed laboratory test, or a clinical assessment by medical
professional. Five articles were excluded because patients had not tested positive for COVID-19
by one of these methods (25-29). Three articles were excluded due to population bias, with
patients recruited for a specific symptom alone (e.g., olfactory disorders) (30-32). The exact data
needed for our analysis were not reported in three articles, which were thus excluded (15, 33,
34). Lastly, one article was excluded (4) because of potential data overlap with another report by
the same author (35). A total of 34 papers were included in the meta-analysis.
Prevalence rate of olfactory loss in COVID-19 patients was then extracted as the number
of reported cases with olfactory loss divided by the total population of COVID-19 patients
surveyed. An exception was made for articles that reported taste and/or smell dysfunction when
anosmia or hyposmia were not specifically reported. Articles were also labeled as using either
objective or subjective methods to measure smell loss. Studies having patients smell a substance,
including both household items being self-administered in their own home and smelling items in
a laboratory setting, were classified as objective measures. All other methods, for example, selfreports of overall smell loss, were considered subjective measures.
Due to differences in how data were specifically collected across the studies, further
inclusion restrictions regarding how smell loss was reported were established. When smell loss
was reported in tandem with taste loss (e.g., “loss of taste or smell”), this value was extracted. If
smell and taste loss were reported together as well as separately, both values of positive cases
with smell loss symptoms were summed to represent all patients presenting smell loss; these
values did not include overlapping patients. If smell and taste loss were reported separately,
smell-loss-only values were included.

Objective vs subjective
Three authors (RDH, AKT, and VAR) performed the initial screen and data extraction,
and two additional authors (MEH and SJL) validated and resolved disagreements in the data
extracted from the articles.
Risk-of-Bias Assessment: Quality of the articles selected was analyzed with a risk-ofbias assessment checklist adapted from Hoy et al (36). Risk-of-bias assessment was completed
by two authors (RDH and SJL) using an assessment tool outlined by Hoy et al. (36), as described
and adapted by Tong et al (23). Any differences were resolved by two additional authors (VAR
and AKT). The nine criteria are detailed in Supplementary Table S1. Specific questions were
scored as 0 (No) or 1 (Yes) for each item, with summary scores of low (0-3), moderate (4-6), and
high (7-9) risk of bias for the entire study. Supplementary Table S1 contains the full risk-of-bias
assessment for each article.
Statistical Analysis. All statistical analyses were performed using R 3.6.0 (37) and
RStudio 1.2.1564 (38). Point estimates of the prevalence rate of olfactory dysfunction were made
by dividing the proportion of cases of olfactory loss by the total number of subjects included in
the study. Studies were categorized into two subgroups based on the methodologies employed
(objective versus subjective) for additional analysis. A 95% CI was calculated using the Wilson
score estimate of the confidence interval, a robust method that is reliable across small and large
sample sizes (39).
Three sets of pooled prevalence rates were then computed and reported for both a fixedeffect model and a random-effect model. In the fixed-effect model, we assume that there is one
true effect size that underlies all the studies in this analysis and that all differences in observed
effects are due to sampling error. In the random-effects model, we allow that the true effect size
might differ among studies. An overall pooled prevalence rate was computed for all 34 studies to

determine overall prevalence of smell loss in COVID-19 patients, and pooled prevalence rates
for the two subgroups: objective methodologies (N=6 studies) and subjective methodologies
(N=28 studies). Pooled prevalence rates were calculated using the meta package in R (40). An
inverse variance approach was used to approximate the weighting scheme between studies, and
the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation was used in calculating the weighting scheme.
Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran’s Q and I2. Tests for heterogeneity were cut off at
Cochran Q-values that were significant (p < 0.05) and I2 > 50%, because an I2 of 30-50% was
suggested as a cutoff for moderate heterogeneity by Higgins and Thompson (41). A randomeffects model was used to account for instances of high heterogeneity between studies and to
provide a conservative prevalence estimate. The R scripts and compiled data used for this
analysis are available without restriction on GitHub (https://github.com/vramirez4/COVID19OlfactoryLoss).
Results
Study characteristics. Thirty-four studies were included in this meta-analysis,
encompassing data collected from January 16, 2020, to April 30, 2020. Table 1 summarizes
relevant details from the articles. Figure 2 lists n/N-values (events/total) for each study. All
studies examined COVID-19–positive patients, though the levels of symptom severity, settings
(hospitalized or home quarantine), and dates of infection differed across the studies and were not
controlled in this meta-analysis. Furthermore, data were collected from around the world, which
could increase heterogeneity across the studies. Six studies were classified as using objective
methodologies: they measured smell loss in COVID-19 patients by calculating their odor
threshold sensitivity, odor discrimination ability and/or odor identification ability with actual

odorants, either at home or in hospital settings. Twenty-eight studies were classified as using
subjective methodologies: they measured smell loss via questionnaires, surveys, and interviews.
Risk-of-Bias Assessment. Among the 34 studies included in this meta-analysis, none had
a high risk of bias: 14 were categorized as low risk, and 20 as moderate risk. The risk-of-bias
scores ranged from 2 to 6 across these studies, with an average risk of 3.79, indicating low to
moderate risk of bias in our overall assessment.
Prevalence of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 patients. Among the 34 studies,
sample sizes ranged from 15 to 7,178 patients with positive verification of COVID-19. The
number of cases of smell loss per study ranged from 2 to 4,668, with prevalence estimates
ranging from 5% to 98.3%. Collectively, a total of 19,746 patients who tested positive for
COVID-19 were included in this meta-analysis. Of these, 11,090 evidenced some form of
olfactory dysfunction after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Meta-analysis for the pooled prevalence
rate across all studies (N=34) yielded a significant Cochran’s Q (Q=8612.12, df=34, p<0.001)
and I2 estimate of 99.6%. The pooled estimate for the prevalence rate for the overall cohort was
50.2% with a 95% CI of 37.7-62.6% (Figure 2).
Effect of methodology on prevalence rate. Objective methods were used to assess
olfactory loss in six studies, comprising 571 COVID-19 patients, with 412 reported cases of
smell loss. Per study, the prevalence of olfactory loss ranged from 52% to 98.3% among
COVID-19–positive patients. Pooled estimates of the prevalence rate were 73.9% and 76.7%
under the fixed- and random-effect models, respectively. A significant Cochran’s Q,
approximated from the chi-square distribution (Q=53.78, df=5, p<0.001), and I2 of 90.7% were
obtained, confirming the heterogeneity of the data collected. When pooled across studies that

Objective vs subjective
utilized objective measurement tools, the average prevalence rate of olfactory loss is 76.7%, with
a 95% CI of 61.4-89.2% (Figure 2).
A total of 28 studies were classified as using subjective methods (questionnaire,
interview, etc.), comprising 19,175 subjects, with 10,678 cases of smell loss. The reported
prevalence of olfactory loss ranged from 5% to 93% per study, a larger range than for studies
classified as using objective methods. The pooled estimates of the prevalence rate were 56.49%
and 44.58% under the fixed- and random-effect models, respectively. Similar to the objective
subgroup, Cochran’s Q was significant (Q=8487.92, df=28, p<0.001), and the I2 value was
99.7%, confirming the heterogeneity of the meta-analysis across the subjective studies. To
account for the observed heterogeneity, we report the prevalence rate of 44.6% estimated by the
random-effects model, with a 95% CI of 31.1-58.5% (Figure 2).
Discussion
This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that olfactory dysfunction is a
prominent symptom of COVID-19. Meta-analysis using the random-effects model computed an
overall prevalence rate of 50.2% (95% CI: 37.7-62.6%), which is very similar to, although
slightly lower than, the previously reported value of 53% in a meta-analysis of olfactory
dysfunction in 10 studies (23). Both meta-analyses confirm that olfactory dysfunction, regardless
of the measurement methodology, is identified in about half of the patients infected with SARSCoV-2.
Methodological differences in smell loss measurement tools impact reported
prevalence rate of olfactory loss in COVID-19 patients. We further examined whether there
were differences in prevalence of olfactory loss based on the type of method used to gather such
information. Most studies (28 of 34) included in this meta-analysis were classified as using

Objective vs subjective
subjective methods (self-report) to quantify the prevalence of smell loss; 6 studies used objective
methods (e.g., odor threshold tests). The reliance on self-report was expedient due to the
pandemic conditions and global stay-at-home orders. However, our analysis revealed a stark
difference in prevalence between the two subgroups; studies using objective methods reported
around 77% prevalence overall, whereas those using subjective methods reported around 45%.
There are inherent pros and cons regarding each type of methodology. Objective methods
quantify smell loss and can limit any confounds because they are often conducted in a controlled
environment with standardized procedures. Objective methods rely on true perception of a
stimuli when presented, diminishing response and measurement bias. In contrast, subjective
methods naturally encompass more variability due to a lack of standardization in how and what
questions were asked. Additionally, subjective methods are often prone to recall bias. However,
they are an easy and cost-efficient way to collect information quickly from the intended
population, as demonstrated by the numerous studies in our meta-analysis that used this type of
method. Objective methods have higher time and cost requirements than do subjective methods.
The higher overall reported prevalence of olfactory loss in studies using objective
methods (77%) compared to those using subjective methods (45%) suggests that subjective
methodologies miss crucial information and might consistently underestimate true smell loss in
COVID-19 patients. One major difference between the two types of methods is the number of
variables assessed in each study. Often in the studies using subjective methods the researchers
were interested in numerous aspects of COVID-19 symptoms, not just smell loss alone, whereas
the studies using objective methods focused solely on sensory loss, using numerous stimuli to get
a sensitive measurement of the patient’s smell loss. Our findings align with a prior meta-analysis
by Tong et al. (23) that found that non-standardized methods (which were all subjective methods

Objective vs subjective
by our criteria) severely underestimated olfactory prevalence (estimated at ~37%) compared to
standardized methods (which included both subjective and objective methods), which indicated
around 87% prevalence. Standardized methods outlined in the Tong et al. study consisted of both
objective and subjective measures—because a method is subjective does not mean that the
method is not standardized or validated. Validated subjective methods for collecting information
on olfactory dysfunction in our pool of studies include a version of the Questionnaire of
Olfactory Dysfunction, and the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (42, 43).
Overall, however, objective methods have been found to be more sensitive in detecting
anosmia and hyposmia than subjective self-reports in a COVID-19 patient population (16).
Additionally, among patients who initially self-reported no smell loss, objective analysis showed
mild hyposmia in 30%, again pointing to underreporting by subjective methods (13). On the
other hand, in a COVID-19 patient population recruited due to suspected olfactory loss, 38% of
patients with self-reported olfactory dysfunction had normal olfactory performance using the
Sniffin’ Sticks test, an objective method (15). This overreporting could be due to the biased and
specific recruitment (patients with suspected olfactory loss) compared to the general COVID-19
patient population recruited for studies in our meta-analysis.
The higher reported prevalence of olfactory loss when using objective as compared to
subjective methods to measure olfactory loss calls for further examination of the consequences
of the methodologies employed. Researchers might be missing a critical symptom of COVID-19
through the use of unstandardized, subjective methods to measure smell loss, as demonstrated by
the lower prevalence rate we found in studies classified as using subjective methods. However,
objective methods are costly and time-consuming to conduct in standardized laboratory settings.

Objective vs subjective
Many researchers have adapted objective methods to evaluate smell loss to enable use in
a home setting. Varia et al found no significant difference in patient smell loss ratings when
conducted with an objective method during hospitalization (standardized setting) versus during
home quarantine (13). Irvani et al. used an app to track smell loss in COVID-19 patients over
time, which revealed moderate test-retest reliability across sessions among users showing no
symptoms, and significant reduction in olfactory function for those who tested positive for
COVID-19 compared to those who tested negative (5). The accessibility and adaptability of these
objective approaches make them a resource-efficient strategy to obtain an accurate measure of
olfactory loss in COVID-19 patients.
Anosmia is frequently reported to be one of the first presenting symptoms of COVID-19
(23, 44, 45). In a cohort specifically of patients complaining of smell loss, researchers found that
83% of people reported anosmia as their first symptom of COVID-19 (32). The actual
mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 may inhibit and disrupt smell perception is currently
unknown; however, many potential theories about the cause of smell loss have been proposed.
Reports suggest that, different from other coronaviruses, such as those that cause the common
cold, SARS-CoV-2 can cause smell loss even in the absence of symptoms such as blockage of
the nose, postnasal drip, or a runny nose, which are typical co-occurring manifestations of smell
loss from other respiratory viruses (46). The lack of nasal blockage suggests COVID-19 might
be a neurotropic and neuroinvasive disease (47). Furthermore, it is now commonly known that
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus binds to ACE2 receptors, allowing the virus to enter and infect cells.
ACE2 receptors are expressed in nasal epithelium cells (48), specifically the structures that
support olfactory neurons, leading to a theory that infection of these supporting cells might cause
additional damage to the olfactory epithelium, resulting anosmia or hyposmia (49).

Objective vs subjective
Though olfactory dysfunction occurs in high prevalence rates in patients positive for
COVID-19, time to recovery varies across the studies. Several studies mention significant
improvements quickly after symptom onset, e.g., (7). Other studies reported that many patients
still had not returned to normal sense of smell more than 2 weeks after initial onset of smell loss
(16). Altogether, our meta-analysis demonstrates a prevalence of identified smell loss in about
half of the COVID-19 patients, supporting the need to understand the mechanism of infection,
onset of symptoms, and recovery from olfactory loss due to a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Limitations and Future Research. Due to the nature of data collection amidst an
evolving global pandemic, there are inherent limitations to the present meta-analysis, many of
which were driving factors of the observed high heterogeneity across studies. Disease severity of
the recruited study population (COVID-19–positive patients) was not controlled for, which could
add to selection bias. A wide range of measurement methods were employed within both
objective and subjective categories, which naturally creates measurement bias. Often recall bias
occurs in subjective methodologies, as self-recognition may occur only in severe cases and is
often forgotten in prolonged, more subtle cases (47). Furthermore, there is lack of awareness
regarding chemosensory function in subjects—many researchers combined the “loss of taste or
smell” in their symptomatic findings, even though they are two completely different perceptions
that would be impacted differently by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, there remains a lack of
comprehensive testing of chemesthetic sensations (e.g., burn from capsaicin or cooling from
menthol compounds) (50).
Assessment of olfactory function in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19
diagnosis may become standard practice by clinicians. Despite the limitations inherit in
subjective measures, at a minimum, patients need to be interviewed about their sense of smell as

a first-line assessment. Given the interrelationship between smell and taste, during clinical
assessments patients may report changes in taste rather than changes in smell. For patients who
report changes in smell and taste function during screening questionnaires, full testing should be
performed using objective standardized chemosensory assessment tools. Considering that
psychophysical testing may not be possible for all patients and the current social distancing
regulations, regular olfactory and gustatory self-assessment at home may be an initial
recommendation. Although regular self-assessment may give information about chemosensory
function during the trajectory of the disease, the results should be interpreted with caution. In
addition, longitudinal assessments of chemosensory function may help identify those patients
with continued impairment who may need further treatment and non-pharmacological
interventions (e.g., olfactory training).
More research is needed to better establish procedures to estimate prevalence rates of
sensory loss. Our meta-analysis results reveal underestimates when using subjective techniques,
supporting the value of adapting objective methods to estimate smell loss. As information
regarding COVID-19 is constantly evolving and is being crowd-sourced, more than ever
researchers need to come together on methods to best assess smell loss.

A
Questions were scored as 0 = no, 1 = yes and comprised the following:
Q1: Was the study’s target population a close representation of the national population in relation to relevant variables, e.g., age, sex, occupation?
Q2: Was the sampling frame a true or close representation of the target population?
Q3: Was some form of random selection used to select the sample, or was a census undertaken?
Q4: Was the likelihood of nonresponse bias minimal?
Q5: Were data collected directly from the subjects (as opposed to a proxy)?
Q6: Was an acceptable case definition used in the study?
Q7: Was the study instrument that measured the parameter of interest (e.g., prevalence of low back pain) shown to have reliability and validity (if
necessary)?
Q8: Was the same mode of data collection used for all subjects?
Q9: Were the numerator(s) and denominator(s) for the parameter of interest appropriate?
B

Risk-of-bias categories were as follows: 0–3, low; 4-6, moderate; 7-9, high.
The cases of olfactory loss were obtained from the lead authors on the paper
