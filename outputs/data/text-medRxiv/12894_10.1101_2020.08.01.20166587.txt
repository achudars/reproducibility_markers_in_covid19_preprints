SUMMARY

A better understanding of the innate and adaptive cells in the COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus is a necessity for the development of effective treatment methods and vaccines. We studied
phenotypic features of innate and adaptive immune cells, oxidative burst, phagocytosis and apoptosis. One
hundred and three patients with COVID-19 grouped according to their clinical features as mild (35%),
moderate (40.8%), and severe (24.3%) were included in the study. Monocytes from all COVID-19 patients
were CD16+ pro-inflammatory monocytes. Neutrophils were mature and functional. No defect has been
found in ROS production of monocytes and neutrophils as well as no defect in their apoptosis. As bridging
cells of the innate and adaptive immune system; the percentage of NK cells was in normal range whereas the
percentages of CD3-CD8+CD56+ innate lymphoid and CD3+CD56+ NK like T cells were found to be high
in the severe cases of COVID-19. Although absolute numbers of all lymphocyte subsets were low and
showed a tendency for a gradual decrease in accord with the disease progression, in all COVID-19 patients,
the lymphocyte subset with the most decreased absolute number was B lymphocytes, followed by CD4 + T
cells in the severe cases. The percentages of suppressive, CD3+CD4-CD8-; HLA-DR +CD3+ and CD28-CD8+
cells were found to be significantly increased. Importantly, we demonstrated spontaneous caspase-3
activation and increased lymphocyte apoptosis. Altogether our data suggest that SARS-CoV- 2 primarily
affects lymphocytes not innate cells. So that, it may interrupt the cross-talk between adaptive and innate
immune systems.

INTRODUCTION
The SARS-CoV-2 virus, originating from Wuhan, China since December 2019, causing a worldwide
pandemic is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus (1, 2). The disease caused was called Coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although the disease predominantly causes pneumonia, the first identified route
of uptake into the cell is through ACE-2 receptors (3, 4). Other organ involvement is possible since the
ACE-2 receptor is commonly found in the body(5).
Indeed, as clinical experience has accumulated, it has been shown to affect other organs and tissues in
COVID-19 disease(6). Although the Coronavirus family to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs has similarities
with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
viruses, it has also been shown to have higher virulence and stronger attachment to the ACE-2 receptor(4).
COVID-19 disease can progress mildly (81%), moderate to severe (14%) according to pulmonary
involvement, and critical (5%) with multiple organ failure(7). The recent mortality rate has reached 6.3%,
although it varies with age, gender, occupational group, and the presence of comorbidities such as diabetes,
hypertension (8-10).
First-line defense against intracellular invaders such as viruses starts with innate immune cells including
monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils. Activation of monocytes, macrophages, and bystanders, bridging
dendritic cells by pattern recognition receptors results in releasing of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL1, IL-18, IL-33, and IL-6. Those cytokines activate Natural Killer (NK) cells as well as producing a positive
feedback loop for innate cells and also for adaptive immune cells. NK activation is critical for viral defense
because of both their cellular cytotoxic function as well as their cytokine release in particular interferongamma that activates both B and T cells(11). On the other hand, adaptive activation is a requirement for
both eliminating invaders, constructing a proper immune memory, and also for limiting innate activation.
Studies in T cell and RAG-1 deficient mice demonstrated that lack of lymphocytes resulted in cytokine
storm syndrome and death (12). Crosstalk between natural and adaptive immune systems constitutes our
entire immune system, but every fine-tuned interaction is a target point for invaders.
The vicious circle of cytokine storm syndrome and hyperinflammation in COVID-19 deteriorate patients
rapidly and mortality rate increases in this group due to respiratory failure (13). One of the main reasons for
the rapid deterioration of COVID-19 patients is hyper inflammation and cytokine storm syndrome. Both

start with increased interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-1B by activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome(14,
15). Although the viral protein that activates the NLRP3 inflammasome in SARS-COV2 is unknown, the
SARS-COV virus is known to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome through the viroporin 3 protein and
causes high levels of IL-1B release (15). Studies show that SARS-COV2, like other coronaviruses, use only
the NfKB signaling pathway that activates innate cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-a. More, it uses
strategies to inhibit the interferon signaling pathway (16).
Although what is known about immune pathogenesis of the disease is very limited, lymphopenia, the change
of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio in favor of neutrophils, increased level of LDH, CRP and ferritin vary in
proportion with the severity of the disease and are used in the follow-up of the disease (17-19). In the
autopsies of the individuals who died due to Covid-19, neutrophil, and monocyte/macrophage infiltration
and few helper T cells were detected in their lungs (20, 21). It is noteworthy that the natural killer (NK) and
CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, which are of primary importance in the fight against viral infection, are not present
in the field (22). Considering lymphopenia, it brings the suspicion that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may attach
other surface and cytoplasmic molecules other than ACE-2, and may also target the lymphoid system
apoptosis similar to SARS-CoV virus 7a protein which induces apoptosis by competing to bind antiapoptotic member of Bcl-2 family, Bcl-XL (23). Immune profiles of individuals with Covid-19 disease
should be examined and be informed more to establish explanatory immune hypotheses on this disease.
Indeed, it has been shown that a low number of CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes, NK cells as well as B
lymphocytes (24, 25). Functions of T lymphocytes measured by interferon-γ release following stimulation
has been found to be in the normal range (25). In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to examine and
compare peripheral innate and adaptive cells, burst and phagocytosis functions of monocyte and neutrophils
and lymphocyte apoptosis of patients with COVID-19 disease in mild, moderate and severe disease courses.
The data compared against the normal values of the individuals used as a healthy control group in previous
studies of the group or the defined normal values of the subgroups. Delineation of the phenotypic and
functional impairments created by the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the cells of the innate and adaptive immune
systems will help to better recognize the virus and develop treatment and prevention strategies.

PATIENTS and METHODS

morial
Patients: A total of 103 patients infected with the new Coronavirus-2019, who applied to Istanbul Memo

Şişli Hospital and Marmara University Pendik Training and Research Hospital with various symptomss and
signs from sore throat to shortness of breath were included in the study [52 female, 51 male with the mean
m
age of 53,9 ± 15 (25-88)]. Covid-19 RT-PCR positivity was the inclusion criterion in the study (tested
ted by
Covid-19 kit, Bioeksen R&D Istanbul, Turkey). However, a group of patients was diagnosed by compu

were applied when required.

Mean fluorescence intensities (MFIs) of CD10 and CD16 antigens on

neutrophils and MFIs of CD16 and HLA-DR on monocytes were also evaluated as an indication of
activation/exhaustion criterion.
Oxidative Burst and Phagocytosis: White blood cells from 13 patients in moderate clinical course and 5
healthy controls were isolated from their heparinized peripheral blood samples and simultaneously tested for
oxidative burst and phagocytosis functions of their neutrophils and monocytes by applying instructions of a
standard kit (PhagoBurst Test, Becton Dickinson Inc, San Jose, CA, USA). Percentage results were
evaluated by using the test's standard values and, also by comparing to controls. Moreover, the mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI) of each PMA-stimulated sample was divided into that of its non-stimulated
sample. Thus, the folds increases in DHR123 fluorescence following PMA stimulation were calculated for
neutrophils and monocytes and compared between patients with COVID-19 and the controls.
Apoptosis and Cell Death: White blood cells from 13 patients in moderate clinical course and 5 healthy
controls were isolated from their heparinized peripheral blood samples. A cell-permeable fluorogenic
caspase-3 substrate, Phi-Philux.G1D2 (OncoImmunin Inc, Kensington, MD), and propidium iodide (PI)
were used to evaluate early, late apoptosis and cell death. Briefly, cells (1x105/ml) were resuspended in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) and one tube was stimulated for
apoptosis using 100 ng/ml of PMA at 370C for 1 hour, while other was incubated at the same temperature
without stimulation, as a control. Then 9 mM Phi-Philux.G1D2 was added to the tubes and samples were
incubated for an additional one hour at the same conditions. Following the incubation, PI (20mg/ml in PBS)
was added to evaluate cell death simultaneously. Then the cells were immediately acquired by flow
cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson Inc, San Jose, CA, USA) using CellQuest software, where at
least 40,000 cells were acquired. PhiPhilux stained only cells were evaluated as early apoptosis or
activation; PhiPhilux+PI stained cells as late apoptosis; and PI stained only cells as cell death. All were
assessed in lymphocyte, monocyte, and neutrophil gates. Initial MFI values of PhiPhilux fluorescence in
unstimulated samples that demonstrate the spontaneous activation status of the cells were measured and
compared.
Statistical analysis: The statistical software package SPSS version 25.0 was used for all statistical analyses.
Values were presented as percentages and absolute numbers ± standard deviation of the mean. Statistical

significance of differences between the groups was calculated using with an analysis of variance (ANOVA)
and followed by Bonferonni test as post-hoc. The significance of differences in pre-after measurements was
calculated using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. Mann-Whitney U test was used for non-parametric
comparisons in small groups. Values of p<0.05 were regarded as significant.

Leucocyte counts and percentages
WBC counts, and percentages of lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils and their absolute number

patients with COVID-19 were summarized in Table 3. Accordingly, there was no difference in total WBC

numbers between the groups. The lymphocyte percentage was found to be significantly lower in the
moderate and severe groups compared to the mild group (p<0.01, Table 3). Absolute lymphocyte count
nt was
lower in the moderate and severe group compared to the mild group, but it reached statistical significa

only between the mild and severe group (p=0.02, Table 3). The percentage of monocytes was higher inn m

Phenotypic features of monocytes, neutrophils, NK and NK-like innate lymphoid cells and, oxidative burst,
phagocytosis and apoptosis of monocyte and neutrophils were assessed.
Pro-inflammatory monocytes with decreased HLA-DR expression in patients with COVID-19: As antigenpresenting cells, monocytes constitutively express HLA-DR. In our study, the mean percentage of HLA-DR
expression on monocytes was 86.2%±10.4 in the mild; 85.7%±10.7 in the moderate and 85.3%±8.8 in
severe groups of patients. That was 94.5 %±3.6 in the healthy control group and HLA-DR expression on
monocytes of all three groups was significantly lower in comparison to healthy controls (p<0.01; Fig 1a).
Although there was no difference in the percentages of HLA-DR among the patients' groups, Mean
Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) of HLA-DR, which is a relative indicator of the number of molecules per unit
cell, was 521 ± 293 in the mild; 299 ± 200 in the moderate and 294 ± 192 in the severe group of patients
with COVID-19 (Fig 1b). Mild group MFI values were significantly higher in comparison to that of
moderate and severe patients (p=0.02, p=0.05 respectively). HLA-DR MFI on monocytes of the healthy
population was 752 ± 352 significantly different from all patients group (p=0.02 for mild, p<0.01 for both
moderate and severe patients; Fig 1b). The gradual decrease of HLA-DR expression on monocytes of
patients with COVID-19 can be considered as a gradual exhaustion of monocytes while disease progresses.
The expression of CD16 defines a subgroup of monocytes which is called intermediate, non-classical
monocytes. It has been shown before that they were pro-inflammatory monocytes (42). We demonstrated
that monocytes of all groups of COVID-19 expressed CD16 whereas that expression was very low in the
healthy control group (69%±23 in the mild; 57.7% ± 27 in the moderate; 52.6% ± 32 in the severe group of
patients versus 8.7%±6 in controls, p<0.01 Fig 1c, d). That difference was also significant between the mild
and severe cases (p<0.05), Monocytes from patients with COVID-19 tended to lose their CD16 during
disease progression and that the mean percentage of CD16 on monocytes was negatively correlated with the
clinical course (CC: -0.24; p = 0.03) has been shown. In the severe cases, that decrease might be a second
proof of that monocytes have been exhausted, similar to losing their HLA-DR on their surfaces when the
disease becomes serious.
Expressions of CD10 and CD16 on neutrophils from COVID-19 patients: As the markers of mature
neutrophils, expression of CD10, and CD16 were measured on neutrophils. That CD10 expression 95.7%± 4
in the mild; 88%± 18 in the moderate; 74.9%± 29.5 in the severe group patients with COVID-19, and

92.8%± 13 in the controls have been found. CD10 expression was found to be significantly low in the severe
group compared to the others (p<0.02; Fig 1e). When MFI of CD10 was measured; a consistent decrease has
been found in all three groups (267±154 in mild patients, 174.5±110 in moderate, 114±70 in the severe
group). But, the statistical difference has only been found in comparison to controls (773±356, p<0.01; Fig
1f). The mean percentage of CD16 on neutrophils from patients with COVID-19 was; 96.9%±2.8 in mild;
94%±11 in the moderate, and 96%±5 in the severe group of patients. No difference has been found between
the groups even in comparison to controls (96%±5.5; p>0.05). MFI values for CD16 expression were
571±272 in the mild group, 385±210 in the moderate group and 536±248 in the severe group versus
1093±454. No difference was found among the groups. However, all was low in comparison to controls
(p<0.01; Fig 1g, h). Therefore, we demonstrated that neutrophils of all patients with COVID-19 were
phenotypically mature. The tendency to shed surface CD10 and CD16 could be a hallmark for their
activation status.
Full competency in ROS production and phagocytosis of neutrophils and monocytes in patients with
COVID-19: The oxidative burst (OB) of neutrophils and monocytes is measured as a percentage value, as a
result of the conversion of nonfluorescent dihydrorhodamine (DHR123) to fluorescent rhodamine 123
oxidized by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in the stimulated cells. Percentage of OB in both
monocytes and neutrophils of Covid-19 patients was greater than 95% similar to the control group indicating
that no defect in ROS production of monocytes and neutrophils of COVID-19 patients (Fig 2). Similar
results were obtained from the phagocytosis of fluorescent-labeled E.coli (>%90 in both monocytes and
neutrophils). In addition to percentage results, the folds increase was calculated by dividing the MFI values
from each stimulated sample to samples’ own initial MFIs. The folds increase in ROS production in the OB
experiments was not different between the patients and controls (2.3±0.2 fold for neutrophil OB; 2.1±0.1
fold for monocyte OB in both groups). But, the folds increase in phagocytosis has found to be slighty low in
patients with COVID-19 (2.07±0.1fold in the patient group vs 2.3 ±0.17 fold in the controls for neutrophils;
2.09±0.08 fold in the patient group vs 2.3±0.08 fold in the controls for monocytes; p=0.02). This decrease
may be due to the fact that neutrophils are busy due to viral infections and its consequences such as
clearance of necrotic and apoptotic cells. Thus, neutrophils and monocytes of patients with COVID-19 were
shown to be fully competent in ROS production.

Apoptosis of monocytes and neutrophils: No statistical significance has been found in early and late
apoptosis of monocytes and neutrophils between the patients with COVID-19 and controls (data not shown).
CD3-CD8+CD56+ NK like innate lymphoid cells: While evaluating CD3 vs CD8 plots during lymphocyte
subset analysis, it has been noticed that there was an increase in CD3- CD8+ quadrant. Then, it was shown
that this population was CD56+ (Figure 3a, b). The percentages of CD3- CD56+cells gated on CD8+ cells
were calculated in all patient groups and controls. This was 18.2% ±10 in the control group, 33.8%±14 in
the mild; 33.8%±22 in the moderate and, 41%±19 in the severe group (Fig 3c). Thus, we demonstrated that
the percentage of CD3-CD8+CD56+ NK like innate lymphoid cells were significantly high in patients with
COVID-19 (p<0.001).
NK cells: As bridging cells between innate and adaptive immune systems, the percentages and absolute
numbers of NK cells (CD3-CD16+CD56+) were analyzed. Results for all three groups of patients with
COVID-19 and controls were given in Table 4. Although there was an elevation tendency in NK cells in the
severe group and, remarkably high percentage of NK cells was observed in some of the severe cases, no
statistical difference has been found among the groups (Figure 4c). The absolute number of NK cells was
found to be low in all groups of patients in comparison to healthy controls (p<0.03, Table 4) Thus, it was
shown that the percentage of NK cells was in the normal range but, their absolute numbers in all groups of
COVID-19 patients were as low as approximately 50% of controls.
In the evaluation of phenotypic and functional features of the innate immune system in COVID-19
demonstrated that the presence of fully functional and active monocytes and neutrophils, and the normal or
an increased percentage of bridging cells such as NK and NK like innate immune cells, respectively.
However, the decreased absolute number of NK cells was not accorded with their percentage values.
Phenotypic features of adaptive immune system cells in COVID-19
A representative figure for flow cytometric evaluation of lymphocyte subsets was shown in Figure 4. All
percentages and the absolute numbers of lymphocyte subsets was given in Table 4.
The percentage and the absolute number of B lymphocytes were extremely low in all groups of COVID19 patients: The percentage of B lymphocytes evaluated by surface CD19 was low in all COVID-19
patients compared to control (p <0.01, Figure 4b, Table 4). There was no difference among patient groups.
Furthermore, when the absolute B lymphocyte counts were examined, the number of B lymphocytes was

number of B lymphocytes decreased up to approximately one-fifth of the control. CD19 and CD138 were
w
stained in a few patients with the thought that the reason for this extreme reduction may be the result of the
differentiation of B lymphocytes into plasma cells. However, no CD138 positive cells were found in the
periphery.
The absolute number of T cells gradually decreased according to the severity of the disease: A signific

A normal number of T cytotoxic/suppressor cells with an increased percentage in the mild group
decreased with the disease severity: The percentage of CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic/suppressor T cells was found
to be elevated in the mild group in comparison to severe patients (p<0.03) and controls, as well (p<0.01;
Table 4, Figure 4e). Thus, it was shown that the reason for the increase in the percentage of CD3+T cells in
the mild group was due to the increase of CD8 + T cells. The absolute number of CD3+CD8+ T cells was in
the normal range in the mild group. But, this was significantly decreased in the moderate and severe groups
in comparison to the mild group and healthy controls (p<0.01, Table 4).
When the CD4 +CD8+ double-positive cells and the ratio of CD4/CD8 were examined among all the groups,
no difference was detected.
Spontaneously activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in COVID-19
We studied CD69 expression on T lymphocytes without any stimulation to measure spontaneous activation.
In the severe group of patients with COVID-19, a significant increase has been found in the expression of
CD69 on CD4+ (3.7% ±4.9 in the mild; 3.6% ±4 in the moderate; 9.4% ±6.8 in the severe group ; p<0.01
with severe group; Fig 5a, b) and on CD8+ cells (13.3% ±12.4; 30% ±35; 45% ±34.5 in the mild, moderate
and severe groups respectively (p=0.01 between mild and severe group; Fig 5c, d).
An increase in NK like T cells (NKT; CD3+CD56+) in patients with COVID-19
Although CD3 positivity is accepted as a marker of adaptive T cells, CD3+CD56+ T cells represent a
heterogeneous group of innate cells with their expression of restricted range of T cell receptor (TCR) that
play roles in the immune response to tumors and pathogens(26, 27). In our study, the percentage of
CD3+CD56+ population was found to be high in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (6.7%±4.3 vs
1.9%±2; p<0.01, Figure 6) No difference was found among patients.
Interestingly, we found that CD25 expression of T cells was very low (CD25 <15% on T cells) in all
COVID-19 patients (data not shown).
Suppressive lymphocte subset in COVID-19
It has been known that CD3+CD4-CD8- double-negative T cells are suppressive T cells (28) The percentage
of CD3+CD4-CD8- was 3.6%±3.4 in the mild group; 4.5%±3.6 in the moderate group;5.4%±4.5 in the
severe group and 2.1%±1 in controls. No difference has been found between controls and mild group,

however a significant difference was observed between controls and both moderate and severe groups
(p<0.01; Fig 7a, b, c).
As an activation related suppression marker, HLA-DR on T lymphocytes was examined. CD3+ HLA-DR+
cells was elevated in all Covid-19 patients in comparison to controls in general (16%±11 vs 5.9%±4.6
respectively; p<0.01) This was 13%±8 in the mild; 19%±11 in the moderate and, 17%±14 in the severe
group. (p<0.01; Fig 7d, e, f). No difference has been found among patients’ groups.
CD8+CD28- T cells are a subset of regulatory T cells which has suppressive effect on CD4+ T cells (29, 30).
In our study, the percentage of CD8+CD28-, suppressor T cells were found to be significantly increased in
all groups of COVID-19 patients [17% ±8.9 ( 17%±7.6 in the mild, 16%±9 in the moderate 18.5%±10 in the
severe group) vs 11.5% ±6.7 in the control group; p<0.03; Figure 7g, h, i)
Lymphocyte apoptosis in the periphery depends on spontaneous activation of caspase-3 in patients with
Covid-19: A special attention was focused on the lymphocyte population. Lymphocyte early
apoptosis/activation rate (PhiPhilux only) following PMA stimulation was 36%±14.8 in patients with Covid19 while that was 16.6%±6.2 in the control group (p=0.02; Fig 8a). Lymphocyte late apoptosis
(PhiPhulux+PI stained cells) rate was 19.8%±11 in patients’ group; 9.6%±7.7 in the control group. Although
Covid-19 patients showed higher late apoptosis on average, this difference did not reach statistical
significance (Fig 8a). There was no difference between the two groups in the measurement of cell death,
which was evaluated with PI stained only cells (20.5%±8.5 vs 16.8%±15.6; p>0.05). However, unlike
controls, we observed that the relative number of PMA-induced lymphocytes in Covid-19 patients decreased
significantly compared to their initial samples indicating spontaneous cell death. However, due to the small
number of samples, we did not perform statistical analysis for this.
Total cell death was calculated by summing percentages of late apoptotic cells (PhiPhilux+PI) and cell death
(PI only). This was significantly high in lymphocytes of Covid-19 patients (42%±14.5 vs 22.6%±12.3 in
controls; p<0.05; Fig 8a). In addition to percentage increases, folds increases have been calculated by
dividing PMA stimulated MFI value to the MFI value of the unstimulated sample for each
sample. Interestingly, COVID-19 patients showed significantly lower fold increase than controls (2.3 ± 1.8
in Covid-19 patients, 6.7 ± 4.2 in controls; p <0.01; Fig 8b). It was an intriguing question of how come they
have significantly low stimulation response in folds increase assessments while the percentage of

lymphocyte early apoptosis following PMA stimulation was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients. To
find an answer, we compared initial activation levels in unstimulated samples from both control and patient
groups. In patients with COVID-19, initial fluorochrome conversion value for caspase-3 was significantly
higher that indicated spontaneous activation of caspase-3 (17%±8 versus 6.3%±4.6; p=0.01; Fig 8c).
Therefore, we thought that spontaneous caspase 3 activation could make COVID-19 lymphocytes more
fragile to cell death. Thus, one of the causes of lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients might be elevated basal
caspase-3 activation of peripheral lymphocytes for an unknown reason.

DISCUSSION
The success for the immune system is a complex process that includes of innate at first followed by adaptive
immune system activation in which controls innate system not to harm own cells with sustained reactions
while producing specific, focused responses for eradicating the microorganism in the shortest time. At the
same time it keeps memory cells while highly activated self cells are destroyed to avoid prolonged
activation. Therefore, proper immune response against microorganisms including viruses depends on a fine
tuned balance between innate and adaptive immune systems (11, 12, 31).
As a part of innate immune system cells, monocytes, as antigen-presenting cells, constitutively express
Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Antigen Class II, HLA-DR. This expression is a requirement for
the communication between innate and adaptive immune systems. The peptides that were processed from
microorganisms are presented by antigen-presenting cells to the T cells in the context of MHC molecules to
activate adaptive T lymphocytes. The decrease in the expression of HLA-DR on monocytes is generally
accepted as a marker of immune paralysis (20). In our study, we found decreased expression of HLA-DR on
monocytes in all clinical courses of the patients with COVID-19 in comparison to healthy control. However,
since we do not have a diseased control group, we did not have an idea of monocyte HLA-DR expression in
viral diseases. A recent study showed that COVID-19 patients exhibited a less pronounced decrease in
HLA-DR expression on monocytes in comparison to bacterial septic shock patients (13). On the other hand,
CD16+ monocytes are a well-defined group known as intermediate and/or non-classical monocytes. They
constitute 2-8% and 2-11% respectively of circulating monocytes under normal conditions (43). While
CD16- monocytes secrete high levels of IL-6, CD16+ monocytes release high levels of IL-1β and TNF and
are considered as pro-inflammatory monocytes (6). In our group of patients, we demonstrated more than
50% of monocytes of COVID-19 patients were CD16+ proinflammatory monocytes indicating that
monocytes of COVID-19 patients actively contributed to the inflammatory process.
Neutrophils have critical roles in acute inflammation. Their functions are not limited to phagocytosis and
oxidative burst, but also generates neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and modulate adaptive and innate
immune responses (32, 33) Various neutrophil subgroups has also been defined according to their surface
molecule profiles (34). One of the neutrophil surface molecules, CD10 (CALLA), is a neutral endopeptidase
and cuts inflammatory peptides such as substance-P, met-enkephalin, fMLP. Those peptides play role in

acute inflammation (35). Mature neutrophils are CD10 positive, immature ones are CD10 negative. Each has
different effects on T lymphocytes. CD10 positive neutrophils inhibit interferon-γ release and proliferation
of T lymphocytes, while CD10 negatives help T cell survival (36). CD16 is Fc gamma receptor III and is a
necessary molecule for neutrophil phagocytosis (37). Following activation and apoptosis, neutrophil CD16
is cut by ADAM17 metalloprotease and it sheds from membrane(38). Thus, CD16 shedding is a marker for
neutrophil activation and apoptosis. In our group of patients, CD10 and CD16 positive mature neutrophils
were slightly decreased in the severe group. This reduction can be evaluated as leaving their place to
immature neutrophils, in line with the severity of inflammation. Our finding that CD16 expression is not
different from controls as a percentage can be considered as an indication that COVID-19 disease does not
cause neutrophil apoptosis and neutrophils remain competent. Supporting this hypothesis, no defect in ROS
production of neutrophils and monocytes has been found. A slight decrease in phagocytosis as MFI may
indicate that neutrophils and monocytes of the patients with COVID-19 are busy. Our finding that early, late
apoptosis and cell death in monocytes, especially in neutrophils, are not different from controls. Together
with our all data on the innate cells, we consider that COVID-19 does not target the monocytes and
neutrophils of innate immune system cells.

The percentage of NK cells was found to be normal even in the severe group of patients in contrast to the
previous study (24, 25). A decrease was observed in the number of NK cells, but this reduction was not as
excessive as in B cells. Based on the knowledge that SARS-CoV affects interferon pathways, NK functions
may be considered to be decreased, but we could not perform functional studies for NK cells (39, 40).
According to a previous study, NK functions measured by IFN-gamma release were found to be within
normal limits (25). Future studies on direct cytotoxicity or antibody-mediated cytotoxicity of NK cells will
help us to interpret this issue better. We identified a significant increase in CD3-CD8+CD56+ innate
lymphoid cells and CD3+CD56+ NK like innate T cells in all COVID-19 patients. CD3-CD8+CD56+, innate
lymphoid cells similar to NK cells are potent cytotoxic and have strong capacity to release IFN-γ (41-44).
We suggest that the increase of CD3-CD8+CD56+ cells with their possible capacities of both cytotoxicity
and releasing IFN-γ might demonstrate the cytotoxic/killer cells that try to respond rapidly to SARS-CoV-2
in COVID-19 patients. Increased expression of CD56 which is an adhesion molecule, may provide a

privilege to these CD8+ cells to rapidly navigate between the periphery and the inflammation. It might be
considered that the decreased number of NK cells could be compensated by increased innate lymphoid cells.
The fact that we detected a innate NK, T cell dominant immune profile maybe because we have a trained
innate immune system as a result of having a national compulsory vaccination program including BCG and
measles vaccines. Our limitation was that we could not have measured cytokine release from isolated cell
populations from patients. This issue requires further functional studies.
In our group of patients, we have found that the absolute number of B lymphocytes was extremely reduced.
Obviously, we should not expect proper immunoglobulin secretion from plasma cells in COVID-19 with
that low number of B lymphocytes. It has already been shown that there was no peripheral B cell memory in
Severe Acute Respiratory syndrom in six years follow-up (17, 45). In our study, we considered that this
decrease might have been related to plasma cell differentiation. However, we demonstrated that no plasma
cells have found in the periphery. A second reason might be the migration of B lymphocytes to the
inflammation site. But, histopathological studies did not support this hypothesis. In addition, there is no
finding such as lymphadenopathy. Furthermore, it has been shown that there are no lymphocytes in lymph
node and spleen (46) Another possibility is that, as a member of the adaptive immune system, B
lymphocytes may be one of the targets that directly excluded by SARS-CoV-2. As a part of imbalanced
immune behavior, imbalanced cytokine release caused by SARS-CoV-2 may not permit proper involvement
of B lymphocytes. More studies on B lymphocytes are require.
The significant increase in the percentages of CD3+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes with their normal ranged
absolute numbers in the mild patients can be considered as a sign of a strong immune response at the
beginning. In the mild group, while the absolute number of CD4+ T cells are still within normal limits, this
decrease in both NK and B cell populations suggests that a careful phenotypic follow-up can be used to
predict disease progression from the beginning. While the decrease in the absolute numbers of NK and B
cell remained the same throughout the disease progression in all patient groups, a sharper decrease in CD4
and CD8 T lymphocytes in the moderate group is noteworthy, and this decline continues as the disease
becomes severe. Even that decrease in the number of CD4+ T cells in the severe group approaches the
decrease in B lymphocytes.

One of the regulatory T cell populations, CD3+CD4-CD8-T cells constitute 1% of peripheral T cells (47). It
has been previously shown that they have a strong suppressive effect on CD4+ and CD8+ cells, (28). Our
finding that increased CD3+CD4-CD8 T cells especially in moderate and severe groups suggests that the
activation control of the adaptive immune system is strong in COVID-19 even if it is not required. HLA-DR
expression on T lymphocyte has long been known to down-regulate T cells that have already activated and
to represent an important homeostatic regulatory mechanism(48). CD8+CD28- T cells represent another
group of regulatory T cells that inhibit CD4+ T cell proliferation(29, 30). In our study, the increase of CD3+
HLA-DR+ and CD8+ CD28- T lymphocytes also indicate the presence of a tight adaptive immune downregulation in COVID-19.
Our finding that early apoptosis or apoptotic activation in lymphocytes, which we measured with the
conversion of a non-fluorescent substrate into fluorescence when is cut by active Caspase 3, indicates that
the virus leads a process that initiates caspase 3 activation in lymphocytes although we do not know the
interacting molecules yet. Indeed, a recent sophisticated study demonstrated that 332 human SARS-Cov-2
interacting proteins have been defined (31). Our finding that folds increase upon stimulus in caspase 3
activation was low in the patient group in contrast to controls suggests that COVID-19 patients have preactivated/tired and busy lymphocytes. Caspase-3, which was already active at the basal level, cannot be
activated further by stimulation. But even with this tired activation level, it is able to double the total
lymphocyte death rate compared to the controls. This data can be interpreted as an indication that SARSCov-2 is destructive for peripheral lymphocytes. Already, an increase in LDH in patients is a sign of active
destruction.
In conclusion, this study, in which we examine partially the phenotypic and functional characteristics of the
innate and adaptive immune system cells, shows that the innate immune system functions in COVID-19 are
complete and competent, and the remaining a low number of lymphocytes is half-dead trying to respond to
viral infection with a suppressive profile in COVID-19. It supports our hypothesis that innate-adaptive
immune system communication is impaired in COVID-19. In this context, it will be very important to focus
on additional functional studies related to apoptotic targets in explaining immune pathogenesis.

FIGURE 1. Comparisons of phenotypic features of monocytes and neutrophils in patients with
COVID-19 and controls a) HLA-DR expression on monocytes from Covid-19 patients from all clinical
courses is significantly low compared to controls. *: p<0.01 b) MFI values of HLA-DR on monocytes from
Covid-19 patients with the mild clinical course is significantly different from the patients with moderate and
severe disease course (*: p=0.02; **: p=0.05 respectively). All patients’ groups have decreased HLA-DR
MFI compared to the control group (#: p=0.02 for mild patients; ##: p<0.01 for moderate and severe
patients). c) A representative plot showing gate for monocytes on FSC vs SSC and an overlaid histogram
demonstrating CD16 expression on monocytes from a patient with COVID 19 and healthy control. d) The
expression of CD16 on monocytes gradually decreases depending on the disease course (*:p=0.05 between
the mild and severe groups). But, all were significantly high in comparison to controls (#: p<0.01). e) The
expression of CD10 on neutrophils is significantly low in COVID-19 patients with the severe course (*:
p<0.02). f) MFI values of CD10 on neutrophils in patients with COVID-19 are low compared to controls. (*:
p<0.01) g) A representative plot showing gate for neutrophils on FSC vs SSC and an histogram
demonstrating CD16 expression on neutrophils from a patient with COVID 19 and healthy control. h)
CD16 MFI values of neutrophils from patients with COVID-19 with the different clinical course were
decreased in comparison to controls (*: p<0.01)
