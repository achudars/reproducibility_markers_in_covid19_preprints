ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND:
Despite limited and conflicting data on the use of hydroxychloroquine in patients with Covid-19,
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the emergency use of this drug when
clinical trials are unavailable or infeasible. Hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with
azithromycin, is being widely used in Covid-19 therapy based on anecdotal and limited
observational evidence.

METHODS:
We performed a retrospective analysis of data from patients hospitalized with confirmed SARSCoV-2 infection in all United States Veterans Health Administration medical centers until April
11, 2020. Patients were categorized based on their exposure to hydroxychloroquine alone (HC)
or with azithromycin (HC+AZ) as treatments in addition to standard supportive management for
Covid-19. The two primary outcomes were death and the need for mechanical ventilation. We
determined the association between treatment and the primary outcomes using competing risk
hazard regression adjusting for clinical characteristics via propensity scores. Discharge and death
were taken into account as competing risks and subdistribution hazard ratios are presented.

RESULTS:
A total of 368 patients were evaluated (HC, n=97; HC+AZ, n=113; no HC, n=158). Rates of
death in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups were 27.8%, 22.1%, 11.4%, respectively. Rates of
ventilation in the HC, HC+AZ, and no HC groups were 13.3%, 6.9%, 14.1%, respectively.

Compared to the no HC group, the risk of death from any cause was higher in the HC group
(adjusted hazard ratio, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.10 to 6.17; P=0.03) but not in the HC+AZ group
(adjusted hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.56 to 2.32; P=0.72). The risk of ventilation was similar in
the HC group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.53 to 3.79; P=0.48) and in the HC+AZ
group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.16 to 1.12; P=0.09), compared to the no HC group.

CONCLUSIONS:
In this study, we found no evidence that use of hydroxychloroquine, either with or without
azithromycin, reduced the risk of mechanical ventilation in patients hospitalized with Covid-19.
An association of increased overall mortality was identified in patients treated with
hydroxychloroquine alone. These findings highlight the importance of awaiting the results of
ongoing prospective, randomized, controlled studies before widespread adoption of these drugs.

The rapidity of the Covid-19 pandemic has exerted inordinate pressure on clinicians and drug
regulatory agencies throughout the world to expedite development, approval, and deployment of
both experimental drugs and repurposing of existing therapeutics. Among the myriad
therapeutics advanced as potential repurposing candidates for Covid-19, the antimalarial and
immunomodulatory drug hydroxychloroquine has captured great attention following an openlabel, non-randomized, single treatment center study that reported efficacy of
hydroxychloroquine and a potential synergistic effect with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin,
in improving viral clearance in Covid-19 patients.1 The resulting spotlight and public interest has
led to its soaring utilization in Covid-19, drug shortages impacting its use in labeled indications,
and stockpiling by countries.

Subsequent studies have not identified a similar benefit of hydroxychloroquine in Covid-192-5
and concerns have been raised about the original positive study.6,7 Nevertheless, the United
States Food and Drug Administration used its emergency authority for only the second time ever
to permit the use of a drug for an unapproved indication8 in the case of hydroxychloroquine for
Covid-19 in situations where clinical trials are unavailable or infeasible.9

Multiple prospective, randomized trials of hydroxychloroquine are now underway and will, in
due course, provide valuable information about safety and efficacy. However, given its
increasingly widespread use, not only as therapy but also as prophylaxis for Covid-19, there is a
great and immediate need to obtain insights into the clinical outcomes among patients currently
treated with hydroxychloroquine, particularly because of the non-negligible toxicities associated
with its use.

Therefore, we conducted a retrospective analysis of patients hospitalized with Covid-19 in all the
Veterans Health Administration medical centers across the United States to analyze the
associations between hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin use and clinical outcomes. The
findings of this nationwide study of one of the most complete national datasets in the United
States can accelerate our understanding of the outcomes of these drugs in Covid-19 while we
await the results of the ongoing prospective trials.

METHODS

STUDY DESIGN
This national retrospective cohort study evaluated information on hospitalized patients with
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection using data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
Data were extracted from the Veterans Affairs Informatics and Computing Infrastructure
(VINCI), which includes inpatient, outpatient data (coded with International Classification of
diseases (ICD) revision 9-CM, revision 10-CM), laboratory, and pharmacy claims. The
completeness, utility, accuracy, validity, and access methods are described on the VA website,
http://www.virec.research.va.gov. This study was conducted in compliance with the Department
of Veterans Affairs requirements, received VA Institutional Review Board, and VA Research &
Development approval.

STUDY POPULATION
We developed a cohort comprising patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in
an inpatient setting. SARS-CoV-2 status was classified by laboratory results that were extracted
from VA laboratory data. A text search for SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests was used to query VA
lab results. The study index date was defined as the date of a hospitalization with a positive
SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test. Index dates range from March 9, 2020 to April 11, 2020, and
patients were followed from index until hospital discharge or death. The period prior to index is
designated as the baseline period and on or after index is designated the follow-up period.
Patients were included in the study if their information included 1) a body mass index, 2) vital

signs during an encounter (temperature, heart rate and blood pressure), and 3) discharge
disposition status available for the hospitalization.

OUTCOMES AND EXPOSURE CODING
The study outcomes are the result of the hospitalization (discharge or death), whether ventilation
was required, and the result of hospitalization among patients requiring ventilation. Ventilator
usage was coded using HCPCS/CPT codes (31500, 94003, 94002, E0463) and ICD-10-PCS
codes (5A0955, 5A0945, 5A0935, 5A1522F, 5A1522G, 5A1522H). The results of the
hospitalization were coded from the discharge disposition status on the inpatient
record. Hospitalization data were taken from the VA inpatient hospitalization data.

Patients were assigned to one of three cohorts based on medication exposure to
hydroxychloroquine (HC) and azithromycin (AZ): 1) HC-treated; 2) HC- and AZ-treated; or 3)
HC-untreated. Patients were exposed to hydroxychloroquine if they had a dispensed drug from
the VA bar code medication administration (BCMA) data file during their hospitalization.
Similarly, if patients received azithromycin with hydroxychloroquine during their
hospitalization they were categorized HC- and AZ-treated. Patients with no hydroxychloroquine
exposure were coded as HC unexposed. To examine the association with ventilation, the time of
hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin dispense was coded dynamically, before or after ventilator
support.

At baseline (date of admission), for each patient, we extracted demographic, comorbid, clinical
(vital sign) and pharmacy data including information associated with increasing severity of
Covid-19.10,11 Demographic and clinical characteristics included age, sex, race, and body mass
index (BMI). For comorbid conditions, we utilized ICD-10-CM codes and calculated the
Charlson comorbidity index from relevant patient data. Vital sign data include heart rate, pulse
oximetry, respirations, temperature, and blood pressure (BP). All vital sign data were collected at
the first set of vital results during the patient’s hospitalization and all were prior to ventilation if
applicable. Laboratory data during hospitalization were also evaluated for each patient and
consisted of liver function tests, albumin, bilirubin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, erythrocytes,
hematocrit, platelets, white blood cells, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, troponin, and
erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The statistical analysis for this study was conducted in multiple steps. First, we generated
summaries of the baseline demographic, comorbid, and clinical characteristics for each cohort
treatment group (HC, HC+AZ, and no HC). To summarize differences across treatment groups,
continuous variables were analyzed with the ANOVA F-test and categorical variables with the
chi-square test. Second, we compared the frequencies of patients who required ventilation, died
or were discharged from the hospital by treatment status using the chi-square test. Third, to
assess the association between treatment status and the study outcomes we estimated the Fine
and Gray competing risk proportional hazards model.12,13 Models analyzing the outcome of death
took into account the competing risk of discharge. Models analyzing the outcome of ventilation
took into account the competing risks of discharge and death prior to ventilation. Using the Fine

and Gray proportional hazards model we estimated the subdistribution hazard ratio, which
represents the instantaneous event rate in patients who have not experienced the event or
experienced a competing event.12 The proportional hazards assumption was tested as previously
described14 using the implementation within the R package goftte.15 No violations of the
proportional hazard assumption were identified. To account for non-randomized assignment to
the treatment groups, we utilized propensity score adjustment. For the outcomes of death and
death after ventilation, we created propensity scores for hydroxychloroquine use alone and
hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin use during the hospital stay. For the ventilation outcome,
we created propensity scores for hydroxychloroquine use alone prior to ventilation and
hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin use prior to ventilation. Both sets of propensity scores
were estimated via multinomial logistic regression of treatment group. All baseline covariates
were included in the propensity score models. The propensity scores were entered into the
outcome models with restricted cubic splines.16 Statistical analyses were performed with the use
of SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute) and R software, version 3.6.1 (the R project
[http://r-project.org]).

RESULTS

We identified all 385 patients who were hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at
Veterans Health Administration medical centers across the United States and either died or were
discharged as of April 11, 2020. Because the number of female patients in this cohort (17) was
too small to permit robust statistical analyses, we evaluated the remaining 368 male patients in
this study. Patients were categorized into three different groups: those treated with
hydroxychloroquine (HC, n=97), treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (HC+AZ,
n=113), or unexposed to hydroxychloroquine (no HC, n=158) (Table 1). All patients received
standard supportive management. There were significant differences among the three groups in
baseline demographic characteristics, selected vital signs, laboratory tests, prescription drug use,
and comorbidities (Table 2).

There were 27 deaths (27.8%) in the HC group, 25 deaths (22.1%) in the HC+AZ group, and 18
deaths (11.4%) in the no HC group (Table 3). Mechanical ventilation occurred in 13.3% of the
HC group, 6.9% of the HC+AZ group, and 14.1% of the no HC group (Table 4).

We analyzed the association of HC or HC+AZ use with the risk of overall death and the risk of
ventilation as the primary outcomes. As baseline characteristics corresponding to clinical
severity varied across the three groups of patients and could have influenced the non-randomized
utilization of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, we computed propensity scores for HC use
and HC+AZ use based on all baseline characteristics. Models analyzing the outcome of death
took into account the competing risk of discharge. Models analyzing the outcome of ventilation

took into account the competing risks of discharge and death prior to ventilation. The risks of
these outcomes were estimated using subdistribution hazard regression.

Compared to the no HC group, there was a higher risk of death from any cause in the HC group
(adjusted HR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.10 to 6.17; P=0.03) but not in the HC+AZ group (adjusted HR,
1.14; 95% CI, 0.56 to 2.32; P=0.72) (Table 5). We did not observe a significant difference in the
risk of ventilation in either the HC group (adjusted HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.53 to 3.79; P=0.48) or
the HC+AZ group (adjusted HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.16 to 1.12; P=0.09), compared to the no HC
group (Table 5).

We then analyzed a secondary outcome of death among patients who required mechanical
ventilation (Table 1). No significant difference was observed in the risk of death after ventilation
in either the HC group (adjusted HR, 4.08; 95% CI, 0.77 to 21.70; P=0.10) or the HC+AZ group
(adjusted HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.25 to 5.77; P=0.82), compared to the no HC group (Table 5).

DISCUSSION

No effective therapy for Covid-19 has yet been identified. Given the longer development, testing,
and approval times for novel chemical entities, repurposing drugs already approved for other
indications is a promising approach to rapidly identify an effective therapy. Hydroxychloroquine
is at the forefront of drug repurposing candidates Although ongoing randomized, controlled
studies are expected to provide more informative evidence about hydroxychloroquine in the
coming months, the outcomes observed in our study represent the best available data. This
nationwide retrospective study of the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States
provides the largest dataset yet reported of the outcomes of Covid-19 patients treated with
hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, anywhere in the world. Specifically,
hydroxychloroquine use with or without co-administration of azithromycin did not improve
mortality or reduce the need for mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients. On the contrary,
hydroxychloroquine use alone was associated with an increased risk of mortality compared to
standard care alone.

Baseline demographic and comorbidity characteristics were comparable across the three
treatment groups. However, hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, was more likely
to be prescribed to patients with more severe disease, as assessed by baseline ventilatory status
and metabolic and hematologic parameters. Thus, as expected, increased mortality was observed
in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine, both with and without azithromycin. Nevertheless,
the increased risk of overall mortality in the hydroxychloroquine-only group persisted after
adjusting for the propensity of being treated with the drug. That there was no increased risk of

ventilation in the hydroxychloroquine-only group suggests that mortality in this group might be
attributable to drug effects on or dysfunction in non-respiratory vital organ systems. Indeed,
hydroxychloroquine use in Covid-19 patients has been associated with cardiac toxicity.4

Hydroxychloroquine has been reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro with a 50%
maximal effective concentration (EC50) ranging from 4.5 μM to 17 μM.17 However, the approved
dosing regimens for hydroxychloroquine in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or lupus generate
substantially lower peak serum drug concentrations (~1 μM).18,19 Administering higher doses of
hydroxychloroquine to achieve presumed antiviral concentrations might increase the risk of
adverse events. Interestingly, a randomized, controlled trial of high-dose chloroquine, the parent
compound of hydroxychloroquine that also has been reported to have in vitro antiviral activity
against SARS-CoV-217 and similar peak serum concentrations in humans, was halted
prematurely due to cardiac toxicity and higher fatality rates in the high-dose chloroquine-treated
Covid-19 patients.20

Our study has certain limitations including those inherent to all retrospective analyses
such as non-randomization of treatments. We did, however adjust for a large number of Covid19-relevant confounders including comorbidities, medications, clinical and laboratory
abnormalities. Despite propensity score adjustment for a large number of relevant confounders,
we cannot rule out the possibility of selection bias or residual confounding. Our study cohort
comprised only men whose median age was over 65 years. Therefore, the results may not
necessarily reflect outcomes in women or in younger hospitalized populations, nor can they be
extrapolated to pediatric patients. Our findings may also be influenced by the demographic

composition of patients in our cohort, the majority of whom were black. Disproportionately
higher rates of Covid-19-related hospitalization among the black population have also been
reported in the United States as a whole.21

Our study also has certain strengths. Because we studied data from a comprehensive
electronic medical record rather than from an administrative health insurance claims database,
we used rigorously identified covariates and outcomes. We studied patients in an integrated
national healthcare system; therefore, the data are less susceptible to biases of single-center or
regional studies.

Data from ongoing, randomized controlled studies will prove informative when they
emerge. Until then, the findings from this retrospective study suggest caution in using
hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized Covid-19 patients, particularly when not combined with
azithromycin.
