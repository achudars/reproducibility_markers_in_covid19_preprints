Abstract
A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has now spread to all
countries of the world, including Iran. Although new anti-coronavirus antibodies in patients may be
identified by immunological methods with sufficient sensitivity and specificity, the conclusive
diagnosis of the disease is by the molecular RT-PCR process. We used a population-based
seroepidemiological survey to quantify the proportion of the exposed population with SARS-CoV-2
antibodies and evaluated whether the antibodies are a marker of total or partial immunity to the
proportion of the population that remains susceptible to the virus. This cross-sectional study was
conducted to investigate the seroprevalence of CoVID-19 in Tehran, the capital of Iran, between April
and end of October 2020. Specimens of clotted and heparinized blood (2ml) were collected from the
patients. The serum and plasma were separated and stored at −80°C until use. We examined serum
anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies from 1375 in-patients admitted to our hospitals using
ELISA kits. In total, 1375 participants were enrolled in this study, and SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies were
detected using IgM‐IgG antibody assay in 291 patients. Among the seropositive patients studied, 187
were men (64.3%), and 104 were women (35.7%) (P<0.05). The mean age of the patients was 49±8.4
years; the majority (27%) were in age group 31-40 years. Also, the lowest frequency of cases was
reported in the age group of 1-10 years (P <0.05). We determined the seroprevalence of SARS‐CoV‐2
for IgM or IgG antibodies to be 21.2%. Diabetes mellitus was the most common underlying disease
among SARS‐CoV‐2 patients [P=0.05; Odd Ratio=1.61(0.90-2.91)]. Conventional serological assays
in SARS‐CoV‐2 cases, such as the enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) for specific IgM and IgG
antibodies, have a high-throughput advantage and minimize false-negative rates that occur with the
RT-PCR method. This study determined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to be 21%.
Control of diabetes among other cases factors shall play important role in management and control of
COVID-19.

Introduction
Since emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) in
Wuhan, China, on 12 December 2019, it spread quickly across the world and developed into a
pandemic[1]. Iran is one of the Middle East countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The
first report of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Iran was reported in the city of Qom on 19 February 2020[2].
COVID-19 disease presentation is highly variable; it ranges from asymptomatic to mild respiratory
pneumonia and even severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Asymptomatic or subclinical
infections are one of the most important public health challenges of COVID-19 because they spread
the infection and remain undetected in the community. Therefore, vigilant control measures are
necessary at every stage of the COVID‐19 epidemic to avoid spread and resurgence of cases. Among
other variables, age has been identified as a risk factor for a more severe course of the disease;
younger people tend to have moderate or even asymptomatic presentations and therefore play
important role in spreading the infection[3]. Accordingly, one study revealed

that 51% of the

confirmed cases, including 10 ship crew and 308 passengers, were asymptomatic [4]. Although the
definitive diagnosis of the disease requires real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR),
immunological and serological tests can detect coronavirus antibodies with appropriate sensitivity and
specificity in patients within the range of presentation (asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and severe) [5].
Combined detection of IgM and IgG is of great value to improve the sensitivity of early diagnosis of
COVID‐19 [6]. These immunoglobulins, which usually appear in the blood of patients 8 to 10 days
after the initial symptoms, can be promptly detected by immunological and serological tests with
acceptable sensitivity and specificity, and thus can be an important tool for early detection of
asymptomatic carriers in an attempt to control spread of the infection [7-9]. Tehran is the capital and
the largest city in the country. It is the most densely populated and reportedly has the largest number
of coronavirus cases. However, the incidence rate per 100,000 people is not as high as that of less
densely populated provinces of Semnan, Qom, Markazi, Yazd, Mazandaran, Qazvin, Guilan, Alborz,
and Isfahan. Thus, public health awareness campaigns in large and densely populated cities - where
most sensitive jobs are located - is of economic and social importance because increasing cases in

these cities can impact on other cities in the country. [2]. The proportion of the population that has
SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can be quantified by a population-based seroepidemiological survey. The
survey can provide information on proportion of the exposed population; the population that remains
susceptible to the virus; and whether the antibodies are a marker of total or partial immunity [10]. This
study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and the risk factors
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Tehran to provide valid decision-grounds for healthcare
professionals to effectively prevent, control, and treat the infection.
Materials and methods

Study design and samples
This cross-sectional study was conducted at Valiasr, Sajad and Ghaem hospitals, Tehran, the capital of
Iran from April to the end of October 2020 to investigate the seroprevalence of COVID-19. The
hospitals are the referral centers for patients within and outside Tehran. With their written consent, we
included 1375 COVID-19-suspected patients according to the Helsinki Declaration. Blood samples of
patients were collected according to the hospital’s infection control guidelines along with adequate
personal protective equipment. During sample collection, we administered questionnaires to collected
patient’s information, such as age, gender, occupation, underlying disease, and other essential
information from the patient’s records.

ELISA assay
Both clotted and heparinized blood (2ml each) were collected from the patients. The serum and plasma
were separated and stored at −80°C until use. We examined for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM
antibodies in serum samples from 1375 participants using ELISA kits (IDEAL TASHKHIS Co, IR.
Iran). For detection of IgM, 100 µL of diluted serum (1:50) was added into the 96-well microplate
(coated with N protein) and then incubated for 30 min at 37°C. After washing, 100 µL of enzyme
conjugate was added into the wells and then incubated for another 30 minutes at 37°C. Following the
second wash cycle, 100 µL of substrate was added into the wells and incubated for 15 minutes under
25°C. Finally, a stop solution was added to the wells to terminate the reaction. The optical density

(OD) of each well was determined by a microplate reader at 450 nm within 30 minutes. For detection
of IgG, the dilution factor was changed (1:100). According to the protocol, the sensitivity of the test
was about 61% for IgM antibodies between days 7 and 14 of infection and 82% for IgG antibodies
between days 11 and 15. The performance of the kit was confirmed on 20 samples of PCR-negative
volunteers (Negative control) and 20 patients with definitive coronavirus (PCR positive) (Positive
control).

Statistical analyses
We analyzed the obtained data using SPSS Ver.22.0 software employing statistical tests such as ChiSquare, and Fisher's Exact Test. P-value <0.05 was considered significant.
Results
In total, 1375 participants were enrolled in this study, and SARS‐CoV‐2 was detected in 291 patients
using IgM‐IgG antibody tests. Out of 1375 participants studied, 954 were men (69.4%), and 421
women (30.6%) (P<0.05). The mean age of the patients was 49±8.4 years; the majority (27%) fall
within 31-40 years. Also, the lowest cases were reported in the age group of 1-10 years (2%) (P
<0.05). Among all participants, 291 patients (21.2%) were positive for either IgM or IgG antibodies,
indicating past or present infection (P <0.05). Among 291 seropositive patients, 187 (64.3%) were
men and 104 (35.7%) were women (P<0.05). The summary of our serological findings are shown in
Table 1. A significant difference was observed between age over 60 years (as a risk factor) and other
age groups [P <0.05; Odd Ratio = 2.72 (1.7-4.35)]. (Table 2).
Clinical and laboratory data of the patients were collected and analyzed. Fifty-seven patients (4%) had
underlying diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune disorders, respiratory
diseases, etc. Diabetes mellitus was the most common underlying disease among SARS‐CoV‐2
patients [P=0.05; Odd Ratio=1.61(0.90-2.91)]. Twenty-eight percent of the participants were
government employees, and the rest were self-employed, or unemployed. A comparison of the
monthly incidence of new cases of coronavirus in government employees and other occupations is
shown in Figure 1. Daily new cases and death from COVID-19 in Iran at 6 December 2020 have been

shown in Figure 2. Among the seropositive patients, 66 (22.7%) were in the group of government
employees and 225 (77.3%) were among the others [P <0.05; Odd Ratio = 0.79 (0.6-0.98)] (Figure 3).
Discussion
COVID-19 emerged as a global threat, affecting 73,809,570 people worldwide and causing about
1,642,000 deaths as of 16 December, 2020. According to WHO reports, the overall mortality rate for
COVID-19 was 2.3%. With more than 1,123,000 confirmed cases and more than 52,000 deaths by
December 16, Iran remains one of severely affected countries in the Middle East. Individuals with
undocumented illnesses, either as asymptomatic and do not seek medical treatment, or those that are
infectious throughout the incubation phase pose the greatest risk of transmission[3]. The proportion of
asymptomatic infections reported in different studies varies greatly, ranging from 4% to 41%[11]. This
finding reinforces the importance of aggressive measures to identify, treat, or isolate individuals with
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and their contacts to halt the spread of the epidemic. Despite the
definitive diagnosis of the disease by molecular RT-PCR, immunological and serological tests can
detect coronavirus antibodies (immunoglobulins) in patients at different stages of the infection with
acceptable sensitivity and specificity. A serological survey is a powerful tool to determine the spread
of infectious diseases, particularly in the presence of asymptomatic cases or incomplete ascertainment
of those with symptoms[10]. From the current study, the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in
Tehran was 21.2%. Our result corroborates that reported in the study conducted at Guilan province[4].
However, the result is much higher than the seroprevalence estimated in California, USA, which was
between 2.49% and 4.16%[12]. Besides, if we want to compare the outcome of serological methods
with that of molecular tests (RT-PCR) in Iran, the results of molecular tests have reported a lower
prevalence of 12% - according to the report of the Ministry of Health of Iran by the end of October,
4,599,554 tests were performed, of which 545,286 were positive [13]. The reasons for this discrepancy
include the ease of access to antibody testing, low cost, and the desire of clients for cheaper and more
accessible methods and false-negative results in molecular testing [14, 15]. Statistically, a comparison
of monthly incidence from the beginning of May to the end of October, the general frequency of cases
was ascending (P <0.05), but the frequency of monthly incidence in government employees after

attaining a peak in July and August, it started decreasing and among the unemployed or selfemployed, it was still rising (Figure 1). The mandate to follow health protocols among government
employees can be one of the reasons for this downward trend after August [P<0.05; Odd
Ratio=0.79(0.6-0.98)]. These results indicate successful commitment by government employees to
adhere to health protocols through a unified and coordinated management system. However, the lack
access by non-employed and self-employed to the government’s imposed and coordinated
management system, impacted the prevalence of the disease; making it higher. In our study, men were
more affected than women (P <0.05) (Table 1), and this may be related to their exposure. Due to the
special culture of Iranians, men are more likely than women to work outside the home, more at risk
than women and even the mortality rate in women is lower than men. In our study, the mean age of the
patients was 49±8.4 years; the majority (27%) were at 31-40 years. Also, the lowest case frequency
was reported in the age group of 1-10 years (2%) (P <0.05). These results are in line with the results of
a study conducted in Spain, and one of the possible causes of these results is that the age groups 21 to
50 years are active occupational groups, and the incidence of these occupational groups is higher than
other age groups. However, the intragroup comparison of people over 60 years old showed that out of
79 patients, 32 (41%) had coronavirus infection, compared to other groups with high relative risk of
infection [ P <0.05; Odd Ratio = 2.72 (1.7-4.35)] (Table 2). This pronounces the needs for more
effective planning specifically tailored to the elderly. According to the statistical results, failure to
observe health protocols increases the prevalence of the disease. General measures to prevent the
spread of COVID-19 include effective quarantine and isolation of infected cases, close monitoring of
primary contacts, travel restrictions, and personal safety measures. Besides, extension of health
protocols to specific occupational groups and individuals with underlying conditions should be done
by the authorities [16-19].
Conclusions
This study determined the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies of 21% in Tehran. We also
demonstrated that the conventional serological assays, such as the enzyme-linked immunoassay
(ELISA) for specific IgM and IgG antibodies, have a high-throughput advantage and minimizes the

false-negative cases that occur with the RT-PCR method. It is hoped that the current findings could
provide valid decision-grounds for healthcare professionals to effectively prevent, control, and treat
SARS-CoV-2 infections amid the current pandemic. Control of diabetes among other factors shall play
important role in management and control of COVID-19.
