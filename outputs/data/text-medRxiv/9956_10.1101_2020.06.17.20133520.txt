Abstract

20

Objective: In late January 2020, the Japanese government carried out three evacuations

21

by aircraft from Wuhan, China, to avoid further cases of coronavirus disease 2019

22

(COVID-19) among Wuhan‚Äôs Japanese residents. Evacuation by aircraft may be an

23

effective countermeasure against outbreaks of infectious diseases, but evidence of its

24

effect is scarce. This study estimated how many COVID-19 cases were prevented

25

among the Japanese residents of Wuhan by the evacuation countermeasure.

26

Results: Eleven imported COVID-19 cases were reported on Feb 1 from among the

27

total 566 evacuees who returned to Japan. In the case of no evacuations being made, the

28

cumulative number of COVID-19 cases among Wuhan‚Äôs Japanese residents was

29

estimated to reach 25 (95% CI [20, 29]) on Feb 8 and 34 (95% CI [28, 40]) on Feb

30

15. A 1-week delay in the evacuation might be led to 14 additional cases and a 2-week

31

delay to 23 additional cases. Evacuation by aircraft can contribute substantially to

32

reducing the number of infected cases in the initial stage of the outbreak.

Introduction

35

Starting at the end of December 2019, Wuhan city in China reported an increasing

36

number of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) infection [1, 2]. Japan‚Äôs

37

Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) decided to deploy charter flights to

38

evacuate Japanese residents of Wuhan over 3 consecutive days, on Jan 29, 30, and 31

39

[3]. This marked the first time that the Japanese government has carried out evacuations

40

as a countermeasure against an infectious disease outbreak. Evacuation by aircraft may

41

be an effective countermeasure to reduce the number of infected cases during an

42

outbreak, but there is little quantitative evidence of its effect. Thus, the main objective

43

of this study was to elucidate the effect of such intervention quantitatively.

Data sources

47

For this modelling study, we used data on the number of COVID-19 cases confirmed in

48

Hubei Province for the period Jan 10-19, 2020 from a report by Wu et al. [4] and for the

49

period Jan 20-Feb 16, 2020 from the World Health Organization (WHO) situation

50

reports [2]. We excluded data after Feb 17 due to a change in case definition.

51

We collected pharyngeal swab specimens to determine the number of

COVID-19 cases among the Japanese evacuees who returned on the chartered flights.

53

The 536 evacuees answered a questionnaire about their symptoms and contact history

54

and provided the pharyngeal swab specimens for PCR testing at that time.

Model structure

57

We applied the following

58

susceptible-exposed-moderate-asymptomatic-infectious-recovered (SEMAIR) model to

59

simulate the epidemic in Hubei Province:

60

We created the model based on the assumptions that a substantial proportion of patients

61

are asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic (as suggested by the clinical characteristics of

62

COVID-19) [5‚Äì7] and that transmission may be possible in mild cases (which include

63

asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic ones) as well as moderate cases) [5, 8, 9], but

only some cases become critically ill. Hence we additionally introduced ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù

65

compartment  and ‚Äúasymptomatic‚Äù compartment  into the standard

66

susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model [10, 11] to create the

67

abovementioned SEMAIR structure. The model structure is shown in Figure 1 and

72

In the early phase of an outbreak when it is not yet recognised as such, the

73

diagnosis rate is considered to be small and not all cases are detectable [4, 12‚Äì14]. The

74

diagnosis rate will increase over the course of a pandemic, so we introduce

75

time-dependent function $ to represent each day‚Äôs ascertainment rate, which

76

reflects people‚Äôs awareness of COVID-19. Here we assume that $ is a logarithmic

77

growth curve and that the number of reported cases % is given by

Results
Parameter values were randomly generated based on the estimated parameter

88

values and their 95% CIs, and 10,000 numerical simulations were carried out to obtain

89

the upper and lower bounds for the total number of COVID-19 patients in Hubei

90

Province. The estimated parameter values are shown in Table 1.

analysis and the Hubei population-based analysis and the 95% CI was wider for the

100

former than the latter, but the estimated total number of COVID-19 patients agreed well

101

between them.

102

Incidence rates in the Wuhan and Hubei populations were estimated as

103

612,475/1.1 + 10‡¨ª  and 590,873/5.9 + 10‡¨ª , respectively, and the estimated

104

numbers of cases [95% CI] among Japanese evacuees as of Feb 1 were 31 (20, 42)

105

and 6 (5, 7), respectively, which give bounds for over- and underestimation of Japanese

106

evacuee cases. The actual number of cases among Japanese evacuees was 11, which lies

107

between these estimates. The incidence rate among Japanese evacuees was 0.0195 

108

11/564. By applying this rate to the Wuhan and Hubei population-based estimations,

109

cumulative numbers of COVID-19 cases among Wuhan‚Äôs Japanese residents of were

110

estimated as 25 (16, 33) and 25 (20, 29) on Feb 8 and as 34 (22, 46) and 34 (28, 40)

111

on Feb 15, respectively, if the evacuation had not been carried out. As of Feb 1, there

112

were 11 diagnosed cases among the evacuees, so a 1-week delay in the evacuation is

113

estimated to lead to 14 additional cases and a 2-week delay to 23 additional cases. The

114

details of estimated number of cases among Wuhan‚Äôs Japanese residents are shown in

115

the right panel of Figure 2.

We conducted sensitivity analyses for fixed parameters to reflect uncertainty. The mean

values always stayed within 30 to 40 cases and details are shown in Appendix.

Discussion

124

To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effect of evacuation by

125

aircraft as a countermeasure against an emerging infectious disease outbreak. Our

126

results showed that evacuation by aircraft can contribute substantially in the short term

127

to reducing the total cumulative number of patients.

128

One of the strengths of this study is that we could use all test results from the

129

evacuees, including actual prevalence. It is noteworthy that six of 11 PCR-positive cases

130

were asymptomatic. Furthermore, most of these 11 cases had no obvious contact history

131

with patients with COVID-19 or influenza-like illness. These characteristics are

132

compatible with the long duration of comparatively mild illnesses and a large number of

133

unreported cases [5, 7, 8, 14‚Äì19]. Given this information, we modified the existing

134

SEIR model to a SEMAIR model in order to reflect the characteristics of COVID-19.

135

In conclusion, evacuation by aircraft might be an effective countermeasure

136

against an emerging infectious disease outbreak. However, further investigation is

137

needed to assess the impact of this countermeasure more precisely.

138
139

Limitations

140

We recognise several limitations of our analysis. First, we assumed homogeneity

141

between Wuhan‚Äôs Japanese and Chinese residents, but presumably the two populations

142

have some differences in lifestyle and behaviour and if that is the case, frequency of

143

effective contact would be different. A previous study showed that Japanese have more

144

frequent social contact than people in European countries [20, 21], but there is no

145

evidence on social contact in China in the literature. Accordingly, both overestimation

146

and underestimation should be considered when interpreting our results. Second, we

147

fixed some of the parameters in accordance with a previous modelling study. Because

148

these parameter values vary due to each model‚Äôs assumption, it is not clear whether

149

fixed parameter values appropriately reflect reality or not. Nevertheless, the results of

150

the sensitivity analyses indicate the validity of our analyses. Third, it is difficult to

151

assess true ‚Äúeffectiveness‚Äù of evacuation as a countermeasure against a COVID-19

152

outbreak. While the number of cases averted by the intervention can be estimated, the

153

impact of the intervention on public health is still not apparent. In addition, the Japanese

154

government restricted the movement of evacuees after their check-up at National Center

155

for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM), and this is thought to have prevented the

156

spread of COVID-19 inside Japan. Restriction of movement is another effect of

157

evacuation, but our estimation did not take it into consideration. This might be another

158

topic appropriate for modelling studies in the future.
