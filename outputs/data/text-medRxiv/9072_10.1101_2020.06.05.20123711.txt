Abstract
After weeks under lockdown, metropolitan areas fighting the spread of COVID-19 aim
to balance public health goals with social and economic standards for well-being.
Mathematical models of disease transmission seeking to evaluate mitigation strategies
must assess the possible impacts of social distancing, economic lockdowns and other
measures. However, obscure relations between model parameters and real-world
phenomena complicate such analyses. Here, we use a high-resolution metapopulation
model of Guadalajara (GDL, Western Mexico) to represent daily mobility patterns
driven by economic activities and their relation to epidemic growth. Given the
prominence of essential activities in the city’s economy, we find that strategies aiming to
mitigate the risk of out-of-home interactions are insufficient to stop the catastrophic
spread of COVID-19. Using baseline reproduction numbers R0 = [2.5, 3.0] in the
absence of interventions, our simulations suggest that household transmission alone can
make Rt ∼ 1, and is estimated to drive 70 ±15% of current epidemic growth. This sets
an upper bound for the impact of mobility-based interventions, which are unlikely to
lower Rt below 1.3 and must be complemented with aggressive campaigns for early case
detection and isolation. As laboratory testing and health services become insufficient to
meet demand in GDL and most other cities, we propose that cities facilitate guidelines
and equipment to help people curb spreading within their own homes. Postponing these
actions will increase their economic cost and decrease their potential returns.

findings suggest that viral exposure within households accounts for 70±15% of the
epidemic’s current growth rate. This highlights the importance of early case detection
and isolation as necessary measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 between
strangers and close contacts alike.

Introduction

1

Metropolitan areas around the world have implemented containment and mitigation
measures against the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, non-essential activities have been
interrupted to limit the number of people exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus in schools,
retail stores, offices, and other places of interest. However, the economic burden exacted
by these measures has overwhelmed societies, leading to massive economic losses that
further complicate the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Carefully validated
models of pandemic spread that incorporate realistic population mixing patterns could
help restart the economy while limiting the spread of the virus.
Recent studies have emphasized the potential benefits of aggressive testing
campaigns aimed to find and isolate symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers [1–5], but
these measures require a significant amount of resources, present logistical challenges,
and become increasingly unattainable in developing nations as incidence soars across
metropolitan areas. Although mathematical models of disease transmission can help
assess the potential effects of mitigation strategies, the interpretation and
communication of simulation results to the broader public is far from trivial [6, 7]. In
most models, public health interventions and reactive behavior are represented by
time-dependent variables that are related to the epidemic’s reproduction number Rt ,
defined as the number of secondary cases caused by a single patient who becomes
infective at time t [8, 9]. However, without a realistic integration of city-specific
demographics and mixing patterns, mathematical models can only assume the relations
between mitigation strategies and epidemic growth [10].
In this letter, we develop and evaluate a metapopulation model that incorporates
high-resolution census and economic data to replicate economic lockdowns and their
relations to COVID-19 transmission in metropolitan areas. Using the Guadalajara
Metropolitan Area (GDL, 2020 population estimated at 4.9 million inhabitants) as an
example, we find that mitigation strategies that aim to prevent disease spreading in
worksites, schools, and public spaces are unlikely to lower Rt below 1.3. However, we
estimate that infections within residential settings can explain more than 55% of
epidemic growth during economic lockdowns. This suggests that catastrophic spread of
COVID-19 can only be avoided with mixed strategies that aim to prevent disease
transmission within households and public spaces. As hospital demand soars throughout
the world’s cities and the majority of patients go untested, we recommend that
governments strive to isolate all symptomatic patients even without laboratory
confirmation. Authorities unable to setup designated areas for case isolation must then
provide citizens with equipment and guidelines for effective self-isolation at home.

As of June 2, official data indicate that people in the state of Jalisco (∼ 60% of whom
live in GDL) have received a total of 23,019 PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 (2.8 tests per
1000 inhabitants, ssj.jalisco.gob.mx/prensa/noticia/9075). With 3,088 confirmed cases
to date and 1292 that remain unresolved (13.4% positivity rate), the state of Jalisco is
thought to have a disproportionately low incidence despite its social, cultural and

economic prominence in Mexico. Although confirmed case counts can produce
misleading comparisons between outbreaks in different regions due to differences in
testing rates, daily series of COVID-19 deaths comprise 100 deaths in GDL (2.3 deaths
per 100,000 people) out of 10,637 deaths nationwide (8.4 deaths per 100,000 people).
The first case of COVID-19 in Jalisco was confirmed on March 11; the next day,
non-pharmaceutical measures to curb the spread of COVID-19 began in GDL, when all
large public events were cancelled (www.jalisco.gob.mx/es/prensa/noticias/102580).
The Jalisco State Government later shut the city’s schools and universities on March 17
and issued shelter-in-place orders on March 20, bringing non-essential activities to a
partial halt. Furthermore, the use of facemasks in public spaces was made mandatory
on April 20. A partial lift of shelter-in-place orders is set to begin on June 1 as
worksites adopt social distancing measures to prevent spreading among their customers
and employees.

Our model uses 2010 Census data [11] to distribute N = 4.3 million inhabitants across
1580 triangular neighborhoods describing the city region [12]. Each neighborhood Ωj
defines a metapopulation of size nj and is characterized by demographic and economic
variables used to infer the daily mobility habits of its residents (Fig. 1.a). People in
each metapopulation are distributed throughout nine epidemiological compartments to
keep track of the natural history of COVID-19 (Fig. 1.b, Table S1) such that
nj = Sj (t) + Ej1 (t) + Ej2 (t) + Aj (t) + Ijn (t) + Ijs (t) + Hj (t) + Rj (t) + Dj (t).

Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in our model occurs through one of two mechanisms
described in Equation (2). The first term nβjl Sj Φj uses a weighted sum Φj (Eq. 6) of
the number of residents in Ωj within each infective stage of COVID-19 and represents
homogeneous mixing within each neighborhood. Thus, the transmission potential βl
controls the frequency of infection within households and between neighbors.

Remote transmission of COVID-19 at places of interest is represented by the second
term in the right hand side of Equation 2. Under the formalism of distributed
contacts [13, 14], this term uses origin-destination matrices Pjk (t) to estimate people’s
likely travel habits. Given this information, a weighted sum Ψk (t) (Eq. 7) of the
number of infectives visiting locations Ωk at time t represents the risk of infection for
susceptibles traveling to this area. Lastly, the effective number Sj Pjk (t)Ψk (t) of
susceptible-infective pairs at Ωk is divided by the total number of visitors vk (t) and
multiplied by the transmission potential of remote interactions βV . To investigate how
each term in Equation 2 contributes to epidemic growth, we can calculate their separate

individual worksites and schools [12], we can use businesses’ NAICS (North American
Industrial Classification System) activity codes to represent economic lockdowns
targeting specific sectors of the city’s economy (Fig. 2.a).

Reductions in urban mobility and school closure have been key components for the
design of COVID-19 intervention strategies have been noted as a key parameter to
quantify the severity of intervention strategies during this outbreak [15–17]. Our model
represents changes in the number of daily trips using Equation (4), which uses
c
sector-specific activity levels ac (t) to weigh the contributions Pjk
made by each activity
sector c in the absence of interventions (Table 1, see Supplementary Information).
Assuming that the city’s baseline status is ac (t) = 1, economic lockdowns can be
represented by values ac (t) < 1, thus reducing the magnitude of Pjk (t) and subsequent
rates of contact in places of interest. Furthermore, because activity sectors are unevenly
distributed throughout the city (Fig. 2.a), different values of ac (t) can also transform
the topology of contact networks between the city’s neighborhoods.

Baseline mobility patterns Pjk
in each sector were inferred using the gravity model
in Equation (5). This approach uses the Trip Attraction Strength (T ASkc ) of
establishments in each sector to weigh the gravity model of Gonzalez et al. [18]. T ASkc
was formulated by Jakimavicius and Burinskiene [19] and is an estimate of the daily
number of visitors attracted to Ωk by activities in sector c. It is calculated as a
weighted sum of the number of jobs and enrolled students in each neighborhood, which
was obtained from the 2014 Economic Census [20] and the 2018 National School
Directory [21]. A map of the individual contributions of registered worksites to T ASkc is
shown in Figure 2.b.

Overall, the gravity model of Equation (5) describes travellers who seek to minimize
the distance ∆rjk between their place of residence Ωj and the places they visit Ωk .
However, they’re willing to travel far given the right incentive (areas with higher T ASkc ).
Coefficients dcj incorporate demographic information that describes the involvement of
metapopulations nj in sector c. For example, d1j is the fraction of people in Ωj who are
enrolled in educational programs and was obtained from census data, while dcj , c 6= 1 is a
function of the percentage of residents in Ωj who are economically active. By using
demographic information to refine inferred mobility patterns Pjk (t), our framework for
disease transmission at places of interest (Eq. 2) can explicitly represent the impacts of
economic lockdowns and school closure as they first change mobility patterns.
Mobility
patterns used in our model are calibrated so that the number of people
P
c
who visit a neighborhood Ωk in simulations matches the census estimate
vkc = j nj Pjk
T ASkc (Fig. 2). Because the mean of ratios vkc /T ASkc is within 0.05 of 1 for all sectors,
we consider that our representation of daily mobility can truthfully represent the
relative roles of each activity sector in the city’s transportation
network. Notice that
P
activity sectors make contributions to daily mobility k T ASkc that are
disproportionate to number of people that they employ (Table 1). This is caused by
secondary visitors like students, customers and suppliers whose presence is necessary to
sustain activities in each sector [19]. This implies that business closure in each sector
will come at its own economic cost but also yield different public health impacts. For
example, the closure of industrial activities in our model is least efficient in our model,
as it can affect up to 13% of jobs but only prevent 6% of daily trips.

Activity levels ac (t) in our simulations were set using Google COVID-19 Mobility
reports (www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) for the state of Jalisco between March 5
and May 21 (Fig. 3.a). ”Grocery & Pharmacy” data from Google were used to set
activity levels in c = 2, while ”Retail & Recreation” represent c = 3 and Google’s
”Workplaces” category sets c = 4, 5. Mobility scenarios used after May 21 are
assumptions based on current policy. Simulations were initialized by the introduction of
1/(1 − ρa ) people into exposed groups for each one of the 66 confirmed cases that were
identified as imported from other countries into the State of Jalisco. Imported cases on
their dates of arrival to the state of Jalisco, and transmission potentials βl , βV were
calibrated to reproduce weekly mortality data and produce a baseline reproduction
number 2.5 ≤ R0 ≤ 3.0 before interventions (Fig. 3). The infection fatality rate (IFR)
was set to 0.7%, meaning that 7 out of every 1000 people exposed to SARS-CoV-2 in
our simulations die, while the rest recover 1/κ1 + 1/κ2 + 1/γ1 = 12 days after exposure
(all model parameters are shown in Table S1). Starting on April 20, we assume that the

Fig 3. Model simulations of COVID-19 spread in GDL use activity levels ac (t) from
Google’s mobility reports (a) to infer temporal changes in the reproduction number Rt
(b, Eq. 3). As mobility restrictions become more severe, epidemic growth is increasingly
driven by residential transmission (c). Starting on April 20, we represent the mandatory
use of face covering in public spaces through a 50% reduction in the corresponding
transmission potential βV . The combination of reduced activity levels ac (t) and a
reduced βV set Rt ∼ 1.4 and suffice to reproduce weekly mortality data in panel d.
These results suggest that, under current conditions, more than two thirds of COVID-19
transmission occurs within households and between neighbors (c).
Notice that increases in the basic reproduction number R0 must be compensated by
changes in the percentage of infections that occur within households and between
neighbors (Fig. 3.c). For example, changing R0 from 2.5 to 2.9 requires that local
transmission (βl ) represents 35% (instead of 50%) of epidemic growth in the absence of
an intervention. This happens because increasing the value of βV relative to βl amplifies
the effects of mobility-based interventions ac (t), allowing each simulation to match
observed growth rates.
While economic lockdowns and the use of face covering have helped curb the spread
of COVID-19 through interactions in GDL’s activity hubs, policy and, social
communication have not targeted viral exposure within households. Thus, we assume

that βl has not changed significantly since the beginning of this outbreak and estimate
that residential routes of transmission can explain more than 55% of current epidemic
growth (Fig. 3.c). We now use βV = 0.318, βl = 0.172 (R0 ∼ 2.9) to demonstrate the
potential benefits of public health campaigns that aim to prevent COVID-19
transmission within households.

We now use the disease transmission scheme in Equation (2) to simulate alternate
scenarios where mobility-based (ac (t)-based) interventions are combined with aggressive
strategies of case isolation (CI). Our model represents improved CI by changing the
values of ρs and α, which were respectively set at ρs = 0.1 d−1 and α = 1/3 d−1 in our
calibration runs (Fig. 3). Campaigns simulated below expand CI to reach 40% or 80%
(ρs = 0.4 , 0.8) of symptomatic patients only 1/α = 2 days after symptom onset. While
isolated in group Hj , symptomatic patients make reduced contributions to residential
(30% of baseline value) and remote (3% of baseline value) disease spreading.
To assess the urgency of CI strategies, we evaluated the effects of deploying such
campaigns on June 1, July 1 and August 1. Likewise, and considering that economic
lockdowns are bound to be relaxed soon, we tested two alternate scenarios for urban
mobility. In the fast scenario (Fig. 4.a,c), gradual reopening of the economy occurs
between June 1 and August 1, when economic activities reach their baseline values (Fig.
S1.a). The slow scenario (Fig. 4.b,c) extends partial economic lockdowns until
September 1 and keeps schools closed through mid-August (Fig. S1.b), while basic
education sets a1 (t) = 0.6 between June 1 and July 17 in the fast scenario.
Simulation results of daily new cases in Figure 4 suggest that an extended economic
lockdown (Figs. 4.b,d) can delay disease spreading after June 1, but will only curb it
significantly when combined with widespread CI. Even with 28% CI starting on June 1,
the extended lockdown described by activity levels in Figure S1 could sustain more than
30,000 new daily infections for roughly 40 days starting in September (Fig. 4.b).
Meanwhile, a fast reopening of economic activities would produce similar infection rates
3 weeks earlier (Fig. 4.a). In contrast, the early adoption of stricter campaigns with
56% CI and extended school closure can produce constant growth (Rt ∼ 1, Figs 4.c,d).
Postponing these measures by only one month could cause a two-fold increase in health
care demands throughout June, July and August (Fig. 5).

We used a high resolution metapopulation model of GDL to represent the spread of
COVID-19 under various intervention scenarios (Figs. 3, 4). The disease transmission
scheme in Equation (2) represents spreading as the result of both residential (βl ) and
remote (βV ) interactions. Non-local spreading follows time-dependent mixing patterns
produced by origin-destination matrices inferred from economic and educational
records [12] under a distributed-contacts framework [13, 14]. By using explicit
representations of business and school closures (Eqs. 4, 5, Fig. 2), our simple approach
provides realistic estimates of disease spreading under an economic lockdown. Our
simulations illustrate that mobility-based interventions are insufficient to stop epidemic
growth, as severe COVID-19 outbreaks can be largely fueled by household transmission
(Figs. 3.b,c, 6).
COVID-19 strategies in GDL and countless other cities have focused on reducing
daily mobility to suppress disease spreading in public spaces, schools, and workplaces.

Fig 4. Comparing economic lockdowns and widespread case isolation as COVID-19
mitigation strategies. Differences between the left (a,c) and right (b,d) panels are
caused by activity levels ac (t) describing fast and slow paths to reopen the city’s
economy (Fig. S1). Simulation ensembles illustrate the effects of improving CI
strategies to isolate 28% (a,b) or 56% (c,d) of all people exposed to SARS-CoV-2 on
three different dates. Patients are isolated two days after symptoms begin, thus
reducing patients’ residential and remote transmission potentials to 10% and 2% their
baseline values respectively (qH = 0.1, cH = 0.2). Gray shading shows periods when all
schools are closed.

Fig 5. Spatial dependence of the percentage of the population exposed to SARS-CoV-2
by September 1 according to simulations in Figure 4.d. These experiments assume that
activity levels follow a slow reopening of the economy (Fig. S1) and that, after
improved CI strategies begin, 80% of symptomatic patients (56% CI) are isolated within
2 days of symptom onset.

Fig 6. Contributions (see Supplementary Information) to the reproduction number Rt
made by residential transmission (βl ) and different economic sectors (βV , Table 1).
Estimates were made using βV = 0.318 and βl = 0.172 for a fully-susceptible population
in the absence of interventions (ac (t) = 1, left) and during an economic lockdown
(ac (t) = [0.1, 0.8, 0.45, 0.45, 0.45], right).
All such measures are reflected on the second term of Equation (2) but don’t tackle
contagious interactions that occur between household members and other close contacts
(first term in Equation 2), which contribute as much as 80% of estimated transmission
under lockdown (Fig. 3). This is visualized in Figure 6, which separates the
contributions made to Rt by residential transmission and activity sectors with and
without an economic lockdown when βV = 0.318, βl = 0.172.
By reducing the remote transmission potential βV , the mandatory use of facemasks
in public spaces [22] can further reduce the contribution of remote interactions (Fig.
3.b). However, notice that essential activities account for roughly 29% of daily mobility
in GDL and cannot be fully suspended during an intervention. This sets an upper
bound for the effect of mobility-based strategies that, along with high rates of
residential transmission, makes contention unlikely without addressing the mechanisms
responsible for disease spreading within households. While lockdowns and social
distancing measures as implemented in Wuhan and Shanghai are thought to have
stopped the spread of COVID-19 [23], differences in public awareness and compliance,
as well as higher rates of case detection and isolation [24] may explain this difference.
Wang and coauthors highlight the use of facemasks and frequent disinfection within the
households of suspected and confirmed patients [25] as an effective complementary
measure to mobility-based interventions.
As financial pressure pushes cities to lift shelter-in-place orders and reopen their
economies, we propose the prevention of COVID-19 transmission within residential
settings as a necessary complementary measure for successful mitigation. Widespread
case isolation (CI) as proposed by many studies [2, 3] is unlikely to occur in GDL, as
current testing capacity in Mexico is increasingly being reserved for heavily symptomatic
patients. Thus, we consider that campaigns must aim to build public awareness about
the symptoms of COVID-19 for people to self-diagnose and self-isolate when they’re
symptomatic or have interacted with someone who was. Likewise, guidelines for

effective self-isolation at home [25] must be heavily publicized and made readily
available to everyone, as a majority of cases in developing countries is likely to go
undetected and many people still doubt that COVID-19 threatens their own health [26].
We conclude that urgent action is necessary to prevent COVID-19 transmission
within households in GDL and other cities within the early stages of this outbreak. As
of June 1, we estimate that 0.5-0.9% of the city’s inhabitants have been exposed to
SARS-CoV-2, but such low levels of incidence can give the wrong impression that public
health strategies used to date are sufficient to contain the epidemic. However, early
adoption of widespread CI and other mitigation strategies that prevent disease
spreading within residential settings can amplify the effects of mobility-based strategies
and social distancing in public spaces (Fig. 5).
The reality of COVID-19 in urban areas is one of drastic inequality in access to
healthcare and the ability to self-isolate. Our simulations don’t account for all such
heterogeneities, which can largely impact the evolution of an infectious outbreak [27–29].
While our estimates of the reproduction number Rt (Fig. 3.b) are sensible to numerous
model parameters and the introduction of imported cases, the conclusion that household
transmission is playing an increasing role in epidemic growth (Fig. 4.c) follows from the
fact that current policy in GDL only targets spreading in public spaces.
Billions around the world committed to stay home over the past months, and social
distancing measures have largely helped slow the spread of COVID-19 in schools,
worksites and other places of interest. Nonetheless, as the epidemic progresses and
household transmission plays an increasing role in spreading disease, communication
campaigns must bring attention to guidelines for the early assessment of symptoms and
successful self-isolation at home. This is specially crucial in developing and
impoverished countries like Mexico, where diagnosis, treatment and clinical isolation are
increasingly unattainable. COVID-19 continues to seed infectious clusters throughout
metropolitan areas worldwide, many of which will likely grow into regional-scale
outbreaks unless we flatten the curve both inside and outside our homes.
