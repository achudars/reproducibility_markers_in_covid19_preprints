Abstract
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented shock throughout the world which
leads to generate a massive social, human, and economic crisis. However, there is a lack of
research on geographic modeling of COVID-19 as well as identification of contributory factors
affecting the COVID-19 in the context of developing countries. To fulfill the gap, this study
aimed to identify the potential factors affecting the COVID-19 incidence rates at the districtlevel in Bangladesh using spatial regression model (SRM). Therefore, data related to 32
demographic, economic, weather, built environment, health, and facilities related factors were
collected and analyzed to explain the spatial variability of this disease incidence. Three global
(Ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial lag model (SLM) and spatial error model (SEM)) and one
local (geographically weighted regression (GWR)) SRMs were developed in this study. The
results of the models showed that four factors significantly affected the COVID-19 incidence
rates in Bangladesh. Those four factors are urban population percentage, monthly consumption,
number of health workers, and distance from the capital. Among the four developed models, the
GWR model performed the best in explaining the variation of COVID-19 incidence rates across
Bangladesh with a R2 value of 78.6%. Findings from this research offer a better insight into the
COVID-19 situation and would help to develop policies aimed to prevent the future epidemic
crisis.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a very infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2
virus. The first human cases of COVID-19 were reported in Wuhan City, China, in December
2019 (WHO, 2020a). Within some weeks, the outbreak of COVID-19 spread globally; as a
result, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this as a public health emergency of
international concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 (WHO, 2020b) and a pandemic on 11 March
2020 (WHO, 2020c). As of 2:46 pm CEST, 9 August 2020, there have been 19,462,112 reported
cases resulting 722,285 deaths (WHO, 2020d). According to the World Bank, COVID-19 has
triggered a global crisis like no other, as well as this is leading to the deepest global recession
since the Second World War. The baseline forecast envisions a 5.2% contraction in the global
GDP in 2020— the deepest global recession in the previous eight decades, despite unprecedented
policy support (WorldBank, 2020). About 1.6 billion informal workers having little to no savings
and no access to social protection, lost 60% of their income. This pandemic will push 40-60
million people into extreme poverty (UN, 2020).
In Bangladesh, on 8 March 2020, the first three coronavirus cases were confirmed by the
Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IECDR, 2020). Affected persons were
returned from Italy for joining their family in their native place (Daily Sun, 2020). On 18 March,
Bangladesh reported its first coronavirus death (NewAge, 2020). Thereafter, the virus
transmitted from capital city, Dhaka, to other major administrative areas of Bangladesh rapidly.
To hold the spread of the disease, the government declared nationwide ‘lockdown’ form 26
March to 30 May (IMF, 2020). As of 9 August 2020, 257,600 cases have been reported resulting
in 3,399 death (Figure 1) (IECDR, 2020). Like most of the other developing nations, the

outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented shock to Bangladesh in terms of
social, human, and economic crisis.

Disadvantaged demographic pattern, economic, environmental, and health condition
have been established as potential determinants of infectious diseases in general (KhalatbariSoltani, Cumming, Delpierre, & Kelly-Irving, 2020). A brief overview of the literature suggested
that socio-economic and demographic factors had a significant association with the efficacy of
vaccination for Tuberculosis in Germany (Bluhm & Pinkovskiy, 2020), for Salmonella infections
in USA (Varga et al., 2013), for HIV (Bärnighausen, Hosegood, Timaeus, & Newell, 2007), for

Pertussis in Australia (Huang et al., 2017), for Pneumonia and Influenza (Farr, Bartlett,
Wadsworth, & Miller, 2000). To be specific, areas with low population density and population
with older age group (>= 65+ years) had a high percentage of H1N1 deaths (Ponnambalam,
Samavedham, Lee, & Ho, 2012). In addition, population density and medical staff density had a
positive influence on SARS (Fang et al., 2009), educational status and living condition had a
positive impact on H1N1 influenza rate (Lowcock, Rosella, Foisy, McGeer, & Crowcroft, 2012),
economic activity type and educational institutions location had an impact on the incidence of
Hand-foot-mouth disease in China (Huang et al., 2017), household-level sanitation infrastructure
had impact on avian influenza in Vietnam (Spencer et al.,2020), and the urban land area had
direct impact on influenza mortality rate in 1918-20 (Mamelund, 2011). These findings suggest
that similar results can be obtainable for the newly emerged coronavirus disease. Identification of
possible demographic, economic, weather, built environment, health, and service facilities
related factors are crucial at each phase of the epidemic to effectively interrupt human to human
transmission chains as well as preventing further spread through appropriate interventions
(Khalatbari-Soltani et al., 2020).
However, the impact of these indicators on the COVID-19 transmission and their
magnitude is yet under scrutiny and investigation. So far, there has been attempt to identify
contributing factors, i.e., social (Corburn et al., 2020; Khalatbari-Soltani et al., 2020), economic
(Atkeson, 2020), health (Zhao et al., 2020), demographic (Hamidi, Sabouri, & Ewing, 2020;
Sannigrahi, Pilla, Basu, & Basu, 2020), environmental (Liu et al., 2020; Mollalo, Vahedi, &
Rivera, 2020; Qi et al., 2020) which might affect the spread, morbidity rate, and mortality rate of
the COVID-19 disease. Though several studies conducted for identifying factors influencing the
COVID-19 pandemic, more studies need to be conducted in different contexts as well as

considering a wide variety of factors to get a complete scenario. Country contexts are very
important as developing countries have major issues like high population, lack of local
infrastructure, social equality, variety of employment, and inefficacy of public health measures,
which might bring disparate outcome in terms of virus incidence rates compared to developed
countries (Khalatbari-Soltani et al., 2020). Bangladesh, a highly dense developing country, is a
perfect study unit for understanding the impact of contributing determinants on the COVID-19
outbreak. In addition, a large number of factors (i.e., built environment, service facilities related
factors and others) were not considered in the previous studies, which need to be explored to get
a comprehensive knowledge about the pandemic.
Geographic information system (GIS) is an essential tool which can assist in the process
of combating a pandemic as well as improve the quality of care through examining the spatial
distribution of infectious diseases (Lovett et al., 2014; Mollalo, Mao, Rashidi, & Glass, 2019;
Mollalo et al., 2018). A limited number of literatures have been published since the outbreak of
COVID-19, where GIS has been used for identification of early spread of COVID-19 (Guan et
al., 2020), distribution of active cases (Chen et al., 2020), mapping (Dong, Du, & Gardner,
2020), comparing spatio-temporal patterns (Zhang, Rao, Wu, Huang, & Dai, 2020), the
effectiveness of containment measure (Orea & Álvarez, 2020), and identification of virus risk
factors (Mollalo et al., 2020). The use of geospatial and statistical tools is critical to explore the
association between COVID-19 incidence and its contributing factors as it is a process which
occurs in geographical space (Gross et al., 2020; Mollalo et al., 2019). Traditional statistical
approaches used in epidemiological studies, i.e., factor analysis (Meigs, 2000), principal
component analysis (Varraso et al., 2012), cluster analysis (Merlo et al., 2006), regression
analysis (Blyth, Kincaid, Craigen, & Bennet, 2001) fail to take account the spatial dependency

and autocorrelation in parameters estimation. To address this functional lag, spatial regression
model (SRM), i.e., spatial lag model (SLM), spatial error model (SEM), and geographically
weighted regression (GWR) has been widely used in epidemiological studies (Sannigrahi et al.,
2020). For the COVID-19 pandemic, until now, there are few studies available which used SRM
to find out the determinants of incidence rates of this virus. Therefore, this study aimed to
identify potential demographic, social, economic, weather, built environment, health, and
facilities related determinants of the COVID-19 incidence rates at district-level across
Bangladesh using SRMs. The objective of the study was: (1) to identify the key explanatory
factors which have significant impact on the COVID-19 incidence rates and (2) to quantify the
spatial relationships between contributing factors and the COVID-19 incidence rates. Findings
from this study would help the developing countries to prepare equitable public health
prevention measures and guidelines for any future pandemic situation.

2. Data and methods
2.1 Data collection and preparation
Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) has been monitoring
the spread of the pandemic and updating the database of COVID-19 daily basis at district and
city level across Bangladesh. For this study, number of positive COVID-19 cases data at districtlevel across Bangladesh were considered from March 8, 2020 (first known cases in Bangladesh)
to July 28, 2020, retrieved from the IECDR data portal (https://iedcr.gov.bd/). COVID-19 cases
per 10,000 population per district was considered as the dependent variable for modeling and
interpretation purpose and termed as COVID-19 incidence rates in this study.

A total of 32 demographic, economic, weather, built environment, health facilities, and
community facilities related factors were considered as explanatory variables for the model
development. Most of the data of relevant factors were compiled from different database of the
government of Bangladesh, i.e., Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) (http://www.bbs.gov.bd/)
which is the centralized official bureau in Bangladesh for collecting statistics on demography,
economy, and other facts of the country; Bangladesh Metrological Department (BMD)
(http://www.bmd.gov.bd/) which is the national meteorological organization of Bangladesh. Few
factors were derived through spatial interpolation and analysis using ArcGIS Pro 2.4 software.
Detail description of the variables and their sources are showed in Table 1. After data collection
and preparation, district-level information was joined with the corresponding district in ArcGIS.
Data of considering explanatory variables of interest in this study are inherently spatial in
nature. Hence, it is plausible that data would be positively spatially dependent which means areas
located nearby tend to be more similar than those separated by great distances (Wheeler & Páez,
2010). Therefore, both local and global regression models were used to determine how well they
could explain the variation of COVID-19 incidence rates at district-level of Bangladesh. The
global models included OLS, SLM, SEM; whereas, local model included GWR.

2.2 Global models
2.2.1 Ordinary least squares (OLS)
Ordinary least squares regression is a statistical method that estimates the relationship
between a set of explanatory or independent variables and a dependent variable with the
fundamental assumption of homogeneity and spatial non-variability (Oshan, Li, Kang, Wolf, &
Fotheringham, 2019; Ward & Gleditsch, 2018). The form of the OLS model used in this
research:

error term.
The fundamental function of OLS is to optimize the regression coefficients (β) by
minimizing the sum of the squares in the difference between the observed and predicted values
of the dependent variable configured as a straight line (Anselin & Arribas-Bel, 2013; Mollalo et
al., 2020; Oshan et al., 2019). Two implicit assumptions of OLS method: (1) the observations are
independent and homogenous across the study area; (2) error terms are not correlated (Anselin &
Arribas-Bel, 2013; Oshan et al., 2019), lead to bias in regression coefficient estimation when the
errors are heterogeneous and spatially correlated (Goodchild, Parks, & Steyaert, 1993; Yang &
Jin, 2010). In the case of COVID-19 incidence, possible explanatory variables used in this
research are spatially correlated, which denote that an explanatory variable could be influenced
by another explanatory variable in the neighboring district (as observed from the SEM, SLM
results). As OLS failed to capture these interactions, we used SEM and SLM, which take spatial
dependence into account, but model it differently (Anselin, 2003; Ward & Gleditsch, 2018).
2.2.2 Spatial lag model (SLM)
The SLM can accommodate the spatial dependency between the dependent variable and
explanatory variables by incorporating a “spatially-lagged dependent variable” in the regression
model (Anselin, 2003; Mollalo et al., 2019; Mollalo et al., 2020; Ward & Gleditsch, 2018). SLM

weights which specifies how features are related to each other/ The weight matrix (W) specifies
how the neighbors at district i and connects one independent variable to the explanatory variables
at that location (Anselin & Arribas-Bel, 2013). A spatial lag is a variable that averages the
neighboring values of a location (Sannigrahi et al., 2020). The SLM accounts for autocorrelation
in the model with the weight matrix.
2.2.3 Spatial error model (SEM)
The SEM model assumes that OLS residuals or error terms have spatial dependence or
spatially correlated (Anselin & Arribas-Bel, 2013). Hence, residuals are decomposed into two
terms-error terms and a random error term (Mollalo et al., 2020; Sannigrahi et al., 2020), where
the general form of the model is:

2.3 Local model
2.3.1 Geographically weighted regression (GWR)
The GWR is a local form of linear regression as it is used to model the spatially varying
association between a dependent and independent variable (Brunsdon, Fotheringham, &
Charlton, 1996). The global regression model, i.e., OLS, SEM, and SLM method have one
prominent limitation while it is applied to a spatial dataset (Deilami, Kamruzzaman, & Hayes,
2016; Mollalo et al., 2020; Sannigrahi et al., 2020). This model cannot account for a spatial nonstationarity issue which explains the relationship between the dependent and independent
variables might vary over space (Brunsdon et al., 1996; Sannigrahi et al., 2020). Thus, global
regression estimates parameters that are average of the entire area of interest rather than specific
locations within an area (Deilami & Kamruzzaman, 2017; Deilami et al., 2016). The GWR
model overcomes this limitation by increasing the local effectiveness of the model by
incorporating geographic context where parameters are derived for each location separately
(Oshan et al., 2019). Mathematically, the general form of the GWR model is (Deilami et al.,
2016; Mollalo et al., 2020):

variable 1 to variable p; ௜௞ = value of Kth independent variable; ௜௞ = local regression
coefficient for Kth independent variable; ௜଴ = intercept parameter, and ௜ = random disturbance.
The GWR model is sensitive to kernel type and kernel bandwidth which together define a
moving window to determine the parameters, i.e., R2, coefficients in the mode (Deilami et al.,
2016; McMillen, 2004). Among two types of the kernel, a fixed kernel uses a constant distance

while the adaptive kernel uses the varying distance from place to place. In terms of bandwidth,
Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), Cross-Validation (CV), and bandwidth-parameter are
mostly used (Fotheringham, Brunsdon, & Charlton, 2003; Páez, Farber, & Wheeler, 2011). The
rationale behind using each of these options is discussed in (Fotheringham et al. (2003)) and not
presented here.
2.4 Models development
To identify the potential explanatory variables for developing multivariate models from
the collected data of a large number of factors, univariate analysis was conducted through OLS
model to identify the impact of each variable on the COVID-19 incidence rates individually.
OLS models were developed in ArcGIS software. Factors that were found to be insignificant in
this analysis were not considered further as explanatory variables. Then, Pearson's correlation
analysis was conducted to examine the correlations between the factors which were significant in
univariate analysis. Subsequently, several highly related factors were eliminated to avoid
multicollinearity in the models. The rest of the factors were considered as explanatory variables
and inputted for developing an overall global multivariate OLS model. The final OLS model was
developed through trial and error procedure. For detecting multicollinearity in the model,
Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) was used. After that, SLM, SEM, and GWR were developed
using the explanatory variables of the final OLS model. Two global models (SLM and SEM)
were developed in GeoDa 1.14 software (geodacenter.github.io). Based on first-order Queen’s
contiguity, the weight matrix was generated for the SLM and SEM. On the other hand, local

were used to compare the performances of the models in explaining COVID-19 incidence rates
across Bangladesh.

3. Results
Results of the univariate analysis are presented in Table 2. Among the 32 considering
factors, 17 factors were found statistically significant and considered as explanatory variables for
developing a multivariate model later. All the demographic factors were found significant;
whereas, not a single variable was found significant from weather related factors. From Table 2,
it is also clear that demographic and health related most of the factors have comparatively higher
R2 values which mean these factors could explain a good portion of the variation in the COVID19 incidence rates across Bangladesh. On the other hand, relatively lower R2 was found for other
factors. Therefore, variation in COVID-19 incidence rates could mostly describe by demographic
and health related factors.

For developing an overall global multivariate OLS model, correlation analysis was
conducted to address multicollinearity issue among the explanatory variables (Figure 2). Several
factors, had high R2 and was found strongly significant in univariate analysis, were not
considered for the model development to diminish multicollinearity in the model. Those factors
were: total population, population density, rented tenancy percentage, internal migrant
population, and number of economic unit. Several OLS models were developed through trial and
error procedure using rest of the explanatory variables. Among them, a final model was selected
based on having the highest R2 value. This final global OLS model included only four factors.
These factors are urban population percentage, monthly consumption, number of health workers,
and distance from the capital (Table 3). The model has relatively low multicollinearity since the
highest VIF value among the four factors (VIF= 2.9) is far less than the threshold of 7.5. In
addition, only distance from the capital factor was negatively associated with the COVID-19
incidence rates. This association was found positive for the rest of the three factors. This model
was found to be statistically significant and have a R2 value of 0.673. This value means that
about 67.3% of the COVID-19 incidence rates across Bangladesh are caused by these four
factors of the model. Rest of the 32.7% incidence rates are caused by unknown factors to the
model and probably for the local variations which could not captured by the global OLS model.

To improve the performance of the overall OLS model by incorporating spatial
dependence, SLM and SEM were developed (Table 4). Both autoregressive lag coefficients
(Rho and Lamda) of the models were found to be strongly statistically significant at 99%
confidence level. Both SLM and SEM have higher R2 values and lower AICc values than the
OLS model (Table 5). Therefore, it can be said that the SLM and SEM performed better than the
OLS model. However, the performance of modeling the COVID-19 incidence rates in
Bangladesh might be improved more if the model developed in local scale instead of global
scale.

GWR was used to model the COVID-19 incidence rates in local scale. From Table 5, R2
value was found the highest for SEM model among the global models. This value increased from
0.722 in the SEM to 0.786 in the GWR model. Therefore, it is clear that GWR model could
explain 78.6% of the variations of COVID-19 incidence rates across Bangladesh. In addition,
AICc value was also found the lowest in the GWR model (AICc= 340.49) compared to the others
global models, indicating GWR model is the most parsimonious model.
The spatial distributions of the coefficient values of GWR model are presented in Figure
3. As seen in Figure 3, monthly consumption and number of health workers factors
demonstrated nearly similar patterns; opposite pattern was found for urban population
percentage. For eastern and southern parts of Bangladesh, monthly consumption and number of
health workers were found as influential factors and urban population percentage was found as
weak factor in explaining the COVID-19 incidence rates. On the other hand, for the western and
northern parts of the country, opposite findings were observed. Furthermore, distance from the
capital was found as an influential factor in the central parts of the country. It was less influential
in the south-eastern parts of the country.

The results of mapping local R2 values of the GWR model are demonstrated in Figure 4.
Though decent local R2 values were found for all districts, districts located in the southern parts
of the country have comparatively lower local R2 values than northern parts of the country,
indicating a decent prediction of the model across the country especially in northern districts.

4. Discussion
This study aimed to examine which factors have significant impact and substantial
explanatory power to explain the COVID-19 incidence rates at district-level across Bangladesh
with SRMs in GIS environment. These factors were grouped under six major themes:
demographic, economic, weather, built environment, health, and community facilities. Results of
the study showed that models with four variables– urban population percentage, monthly
consumption, number of health workers, and distance from the capital– could explain relatively
higher variation in the COVID-19 incidence rates in Bangladesh. Among the used four models,
local SRM (GWR) was found to better explain the variation in COVID-19 incidence rates.
Urban population percentage was found to be proportionally related to COVID-19
incidence rates which implies urbanization paves the way to increase the likelihood of
transmission of COVID-19. High urban population leads to increase movement and activities of
people in high-density urban area (Hamidi et al., 2020; Ramírez-Aldana, Gomez-Verjan, &
Bello-Chavolla, 2020). The higher the population density is, the more likelihood to come in
proximate contact between an infector and infectee (You, Wu, & Guo, 2020). To be mentioned
here, in this study, population density was also found strongly significant in univariate analysis
and was not considered for developing overall model due to multicollinearity issue.
Households having higher monthly consumption have a tendency to purchase goods from
commercially vibrant places which increases the potential of being affected by COVID-19 (You
et al., 2020). Furthermore, higher consumption is associated with higher income level, lower
poverty, as well as higher employment rates. Therefore, income and employment related

activities trigger frequent travel and physical contact with people which could increase the risk of
transmission of COVID-19 (Ehlert, 2020; Wheaton & Kinsella Thompson, 2020).
Number of health workers had a positive influence on the COVID-19 incidence rates as
hospital acts as the hotspots of COVID-19 circulation. This result was found to be consistent
with the findings of Mollalo et al. (2020). There was a severe shortage of personal protection
equipment (PPE) in Bangladesh at the beginning of the pandemic. Therefore, a significant
percentage (25%) of frontline health workers are obliged to tackle COVID-19 without any
protection and thereby, a large number of health workers become infected by COVID-19
(Mahmud, 2020).
Distance from the capital was found inversely related to COVID-19 incidence rates.
Dhaka, the capital and a megacity of Bangladesh, is the epicenter of pandemic in the country and
has the most number of infected populations (Figure 1). In addition, Dhaka is the main
commercial and administrative hub of the country; hence, it has a huge transport demand from
different parts of the country. As, during this pandemic, public transport was under restriction
across the country, districts in closer proximity to Dhaka, somehow, could manage to travel to
this district more frequently than districts located further. These might be the reasons behind the
result: the lower the distance of a district from the capital, the higher would be the likelihood of
transmission of COVID-19.
Our study demonstrates that weather indicators had no significant influence on the
occurrence rates of COVID-19. In literature, there are confounding findings regarding the
influence of weather indicators on COVID-19 incidence: one group of researchers finds
association between temperature or humidity and COVID-19 incidence (Ahmadi, Sharifi,
Dorosti, Ghoushchi, & Ghanbari, 2020; Gupta, Raghuwanshi, & Chanda, 2020; Liu et al., 2020;

Ma et al., 2020) while another finds no significance in this regard (Jüni et al., 2020; Mollalo et
al., 2020; Xie & Zhu, 2020). There is a scope of rigorous and detailed study to understand the
impact of weather related indicators on the occurrence of COVID-19.
This study showed that the impact of most of the community facilities, i.e., primary
school, secondary school, college, growth center, rural market, religious establishment on
COVID-19 incidence rates was insignificant as these facilities were shut down at the initial stage
of COVID-19 pandemic. However, results of the univariate analysis shows that number of transit
station and number of police station factors had profound influence to increase COVID-19
incidence. Though transit stations were also controlled through lockdown measures, stringent
control was not implemented during festive and sudden opening and again closing decision of
garments (Mamun, 2020). In addition, emergency activities, i.e., health care, food delivery,
regular necessary goods marketing etc. were out of the scope of lockdown measures which also
leaded to use transit stations. As a result, transit stations might become crowded which paved the
way to transmit COVID-19. In addition, police had the responsibility to implement lockdown
and social distancing in the field level during the pandemic. However, enough protection
equipment was not available for the police officers to carry out their responsibility safely. In
addition, overcrowding travel of police officers in a single police van made them more
vulnerable to the virus (Javed, 2020).
One of the limitations of our study was data availability. Due to unavailability of
individual or community level data, it is not logical to draw inferences at individual or
community level. Another instance, weather data for 64 districts were interpolated from 28
station data in this study. The detailed weather related data availability might change the findings
of the model. Another reservation is that spatial availability of COVID-19 testing center: in

Bangladesh, there are few opportunities to test COVID-19 for people living in the remote area.
Besides, there is a tendency among people not to test COVID-19 even though they have
symptoms. Therefore, there might be an underestimation of COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, the
influence of lockdown and other containment measures on COVID-19 incidence rates was not
considered in this study. There is obvious to have variations in lockdown related policies and
their implementation efficiency within a district. It might play an important role in the districtlevel to control the COVID-19 incidence rates but analyzing this influence would be out of the
scope of this research.

5. Conclusion
Identification of possible determinants of virus transmission and spread is crucial,
especially for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which brought unprecedented shock globally.
This study aimed to identify potential factors affecting the COVID-19 incidence rates at districtlevel across Bangladesh. To fulfill the aim, three global (OLS, SLM, and SEM) and one local
(GWR) spatial models were developed in this study to identify potential demographic, economic,
weather, built environment, health, and facilities related factors affecting the COVID-19
incidence rates.
First, univariate OLS models were developed where 17 factors were found statistically
significant among the 32 considering factors. After that, a global multivariate OLS model was
developed. The results of the model showed that four factors– urban population percentage,
monthly consumption, number of health workers, and distance from the capital– were found to
be statistically significant and had a R2 value of 0.673. To address the issue of spatial
dependency, SLM and SEM were further employed which resulted in increasing the R2 values.
Finally, a GWR model was developed to examine the spatial non-stationarity issue. The GWR

model results showed improvement of model performance as explanatory powers increased to
78.6 % with the lowest AICc value (AICc= 340.49) compared to other models. Local R2 values
showed that model factors could better explain the COVID-19 incidence better in districts
located northern part of the country compared to the southern regions. Theoretical investigations
and empirical observations from this research offer an alternate view for the joint importance of
the health and non-health determinants, which will help to develop policies aimed at preventing
future epidemic crises.
