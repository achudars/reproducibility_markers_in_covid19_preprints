Abstract
Permanent supportive housing (PSH) enrolls highly vulnerable homeless adults who experience
early onset of geriatric conditions and require in-home support. Thus, there is potentially a high
risk for COVID-19 within PSH, which may necessitate tenants to take protective measures. This
study reports on survey results collected from 532 PSH tenants in Los Angeles, California during
the 4th week of March in 2020. Results show that nearly all tenants were aware of COVID-19,
and 65% considered it to be a very serious health threat. The latter characteristic was a strong
predictor of taking protective measures (i.e., handwashing and social distancing). Tenants in
units with shared bathroom facilities had lower odds of social distancing than those in studio
apartments. Tenants with mental health diagnoses had lower odds of consistent handwashing.
Lack of access to food, hygiene items, and medication delivery were commonly reported barriers
to sheltering in place.
Key words: COVID-19, permanent supportive housing, homelessness.

More than half a million adults are homeless in the United States,1 and these individuals
constitute a high-risk group for the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Living in
shelters or on the streets makes protective measures including social distancing and handwashing
difficult. In addition, high rates of underlying health conditions in the homeless population,2
including obstructive lung disease,3 increase vulnerability.4 An estimated 21,000 people
experiencing homelessness in the United States could require hospitalization at a peak infection
rate of 40% among this population.5 As a matter of policy, the most vulnerable homeless adults
are prioritized for Housing First programs,6 which means they receive immediate access to
independent living situations coupled with support services—also known as permanent
supportive housing (PSH).7 In 2019, the United States had more than 369,000 PSH units1
capable of providing opportunities for social distancing. Older units such as single-room
occupancy (SRO) facilities with shared bathroom facilities, however, may make social
distancing more challenging.
Whether PSH tenants are aware of COVID-19 and are taking protective measures is
largely unknown. Among the general population, engagement in social distancing and
handwashing was most strongly predicted by the perceived likelihood of being infected.8 Based
on surveys conducted during the first official week of the pandemic (March 11-16, 2020) among
the general public regarding perceptions and responses to the novel coronavirus epidemic, most
of the general population considers the current outbreak to be serious and is taking protective
actions including increased handwashing and social distancing. However, only about half of
respondents who experience symptoms of the virus (e.g. fever or chills and shortness of breath)
take steps to stay away from other people.9 Also concerning, the surveys demonstrated that there
are subgroups that are largely disengaged, unaware, and not practicing protective behaviors.8
This study reports on survey results collected from PSH tenants in the Skid Row and
downtown areas of Los Angeles during the week (March 20–27, 2020) after California’s
governor issued a statewide shelter-in-place order.10 This area represents a concentrated area of
homelessness where the risk of exposure and spread is high due to close contact of people living
on the streets and lack of sanitation. In this study we examine tenants’ knowledge of COVID-19,
perceived risk, pre-existing condition risk factors, consistency of handwashing and social
distancing since the outbreak began, recent experiences of flu-like symptoms, and tenants’ ability
to shelter in place. A better understanding of these COVID-19-related factors among PSH

tenants will serve to inform policies and interventions to be implemented by service providers in
order to protect this vulnerable population.
Methods
Staff members from one of the largest providers of PSH in Los Angeles conducted phone
surveys of tenants who lived in either a studio apartment or an SRO with shared bathroom
facilities. Tenant responses were entered into a survey tool and analyzed to guide programmatic
response to tenant needs. For this report, tenant responses were merged with demographic
characteristics from existing administration records, deidentified, and analyzed for research
purposes. Approximately half of all tenants were surveyed (n=766), with PSH staff reporting no
refusals. Of these, 532 were successfully matched to complete demographic data and included
for analysis; respondents in our analytic sample were on average 1.5 years older than tenants
with demographic data who did not respond (p =.02). The study was approved as exempt by the
first author’s University Institutional Review Board.
Measures
Surveys began by asking residents if they had “heard of the coronavirus/COVID-19
outbreak (yes; no),” and they were provided information about it if not. The following questions
concerned how they viewed the health risk posed by COVID-19 (“Do you view this outbreak as
a serious risk to your health? [not at all; not very seriously; somewhat seriously; very
seriously]”); whether they had a pre-existing condition that puts them in a high risk group for
COVID-19 (“Are you in a category considered to be at serious risk for coronavirus/COVID-19?
[I have a preexisting condition; I am over 60 years old; I’m not sure; no]”); whether they had
consistently been engaging in preventive handwashing (“have you been washing your hands
more since the outbreak began? [no; yes, once in while; yes, sometimes; yes, all the time]”) and
social distancing (“have you been social distancing, or staying away from others and limiting
social gatherings, to avoid spreading the virus? [no; yes, once in while; yes, sometimes; yes, all
the time]”); and whether they had experienced flu-like symptoms in the prior 30 days (“Have
you been sick in the past 30 days with cold or flu-like symptoms? [no; yes – cold only; yes – flu
only; yes – both]”). Tenants were also asked whether they could shelter in place for 14 days if
necessary (“Are you able to shelter in place (i.e. not leave your home and practice social
distancing at all times) for 14 days? [no; maybe; yes]”), and those who answered “no” or

“maybe” were asked, “If not, what would you need so that you can shelter in place that you are
not able to secure for yourself? [select all that apply: delivery of food; hygiene products;
medications; someone to check in with; something to do; other].” Matched administrative data
provided basic demographic and health information about respondents (age, gender, race,
ethnicity, and presence of a mental health condition [yes; no]).
Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample, and chi-square, Fisher’sexact, and t-tests were applied to identify significant differences by unit type (SRO vs. studio).
Three separate multiple logistic regression models were used to examine predictors of perceiving
risk posed by COVID-19 “very seriously” (versus less than very seriously) and engaging in
handwashing and social distancing behaviors “all the time” (versus less than all the time).
Covariates included age in years and bivariate indicators of increased risk due to a pre-existing
condition, male gender, Black or African American race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, presence
of a mental health condition, and living in an SRO (as opposed to a studio). Models predicting
engagement in preventive behaviors additionally controlled for whether participants viewed
COVID-19 health risk “very seriously.” All analyses were conducted using Stata/SE for Mac,
version 16.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Results
As noted in Table 1, 216 of 532 respondents with matched demographic data (41%) lived
in SROs. Our sample was 56 years old on average (SD = 10.6), 73% male, and 61% Black or
African American. Only 1% (n = 6) indicated that they were not aware of COVID-19 and 65% (n
= 346) regarded it as a very serious risk to their health. Compared with those in SROs, a greater
proportion of studio residents reported flu-like symptoms in the prior 30 days (6% vs. 1%, p =
.01), increased risk due to a preexisting condition (43% vs. 32%, p = .01), or had a mental health
diagnosis (64% vs. 53%, p = .01). About three quarters of tenants in both studios (76%) and
SROs (75%) reported consistent handwashing, but significantly fewer SRO residents reported
consistent social distancing (63% vs. 75%, p = .002). Fifty-five percent of participants said they
could shelter in place for 14 days if needed. Among the 45% (n = 238) overall who said that they
could not, significantly more studio residents reported lack of food (95% vs. 86% p = .013),

Regression results detailed in Table 2 indicate that older age and preexisting conditions
were associated with one to two times the odds of perceiving COVID-19 to be a very serious
health risk (p = .02 and p = .005, respectively). Men had significantly lower odds of perceiving
risk very seriously than women (OR = 0.56, p = .008) Perceiving COVID-19 as a very serious
health risk was associated with three to four times the odds of engaging in consistent
handwashing and social distancing (p < .001). Those living in SROs and those with mental
health conditions had about half the odds of reporting consistent social distancing (p = .005) and
handwashing (p = .004) than those in studios.

Discussion
The results of our survey suggest PSH tenants are aware of the COVID-19 pandemic and
many consider it to be a very serious health threat. Such awareness and perception were found to
be strong predictors of taking protective measures (as is the case in the general population7).
Although the majority of tenants reported taking protective measures, many reported not doing
so. Our findings indicate that targeted outreach may be needed to reduce risk. For example, we
found that male tenants had lower odds of perceiving COVID-19 as a serious health threat,
which is consistent with prior literature.11 We also found that tenants with a mental health

diagnosis, in particular, had lower odds of washing their hands consistently, which may indicate
the need for increased mental health support and interventions that target daily functioning.
While our results are limited by reporting bias and chronological bias—attitudes and
behaviors may be changing rapidly as the pandemic continues to unfold—the findings from this
study also demonstrate how structural factors may influence preventive behavior. Tenants in
SROs that have shared bathroom facilities had lower odds than others of social distancing. A
lack of access to food, hygiene products, and medication delivery, especially among those living
in studio apartments versus SROs, were common barriers to sheltering in place. While this
suggests that having shared facilities may provide access to more resources, it may also reflect
the higher rate of predisposing health conditions in studio residents resulting in increased need
and risk of contracting the illness. This may also explain the higher reported rates of flu-like
symptoms in studio residents. Regardless, PSH providers may need to plan for the delivery of
supplies such as food, hygiene products, and medication in a more systematic and sustained way.
While lack of viral testing capacity may result in PSH programs only testing residents
who are displaying active symptoms, a recent report from a shelter setting demonstrates that
universal testing would be required to identify the high proportion of mild, pre-symptomatic, and
asymptomatic cases,12 which are suspected to play a major role in COVID-19 transmission.13
The fact that PSH tenants exhibit premature aging, early onset of geriatric conditions, and require
in-home supports13 suggests that risk of transmission within PSH may be elevated. This is
particularly of concern in single-site programs, in which all tenants in the same building receive
support services, as opposed to scatter-site programs, in which units are located in the
community and operated by private landlords.15 Applying lessons learned from vulnerabilities
found in nursing homes that have been described as “ground zero” for the COVID-19
pandemic,16 prevention and containment of outbreaks within single-site PSH will require
proactive screening efforts, education of tenants and support staff (e.g., hand washing and social
distancing), isolation of infected tenants, effective and nonpunitive sick leave policies for staff,
and access to personal protective equipment (PPE) for in-home visits.16
In order to continue supportive services while maintaining social distance, PSH providers
should consider options such as telehealth, which has been shown to be feasible in PSH,17 in
addition to resources such as food delivery. Given that the duration of this pandemic is unknown,
housing options including PSH will be critical to slowing the spread of the COVID-19 among

those experiencing homelessness5 but will require ongoing disease surveillance and proactive
protective measures.
In addition to possible reporting bias referenced above, limitations of this study include
lack of information about how tenants first learned of COVID-19, whether they had accurate
information about pre-existing conditions that puts them at risk or flu-like symptoms (as well as
lack of specific mental health diagnoses), or whether they are exposed to updated information as
knowledge of the pandemic increases. It is also unclear the extent to which the sample is
representative of most tenants in supportive housing. While the average age and gender of our
sample is similar to national estimates of the target population, the majority of our sample
identified as Black or African American, which is higher than national and local estimates.1 Still,
the fact that African Americans are disproportionately impacted by homelessness and COVID1918 underlines the importance of research that can inform policies and interventions to be
implemented by service providers in order to protect this vulnerable population.
