Epidemiologic risk factors for incident SARS-CoV-2 infection are best characterized via
prospective cohort studies, complementing case-based surveillance and cross-sectional
seroprevalence studies. In March 2020, we launched the CHASING COVID Cohort Study, a
national, community-based prospective cohort study of 6,745 U.S. adults who underwent athome specimen collection for repeat serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We identify
and quantify several policy-sensitive risk factors for recent SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion,
highlight persistent racial/ethnic disparities in incidence, document continued elevated risk
among essential workers, and call attention to major gaps in the coverage of public health
interventions aimed at testing, isolation, and contact tracing. We conclude that modifiable risk
factors and poor reach of public health strategies drive SARS-CoV-2 transmission and inequities
across the U.S.

Background
Epidemiologic risk factors for incident SARS-CoV-2 infection are best characterized via
prospective cohort studies, complementing case-based surveillance and cross-sectional
seroprevalence studies.
Methods
We estimated the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and incidence rates of
seroconversion in a national prospective online cohort of 6,745 U.S. adults, enrolled March-July
2020. A subset (n=4,459) underwent serologic testing (Bio-Rad Platelia Total Ab,
IgA/IgM/IgG), offered initially May-September 2020 and again November 2020-January 2021.
Results
A total of 303 of 4,459 individuals showed serologic evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection
(cumulative incidence of 6.8%; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 6.1%-7.6% [6.3%, 95% CI 5.7%7.1% adjusting for laboratory test error]). Among 3,280 initially seronegative participants with a
subsequent serologic test, we observed 145 seroconversions during 1,562 person years of followup (incidence rate of 9.3 per 100 person-years [95% CI 17.9-11.0]). Racial/ethnic disparities in
crude incidence rates were apparent through January 2021 (rate ratio [RRHispanic vs Whites]=2.1;
95% CI 1.4-3.1; RRnon-Hispanic Blacks vs Whites=1.8; 95% CI 0.96-3.1). Incidence was higher in the
southern (RRSouth vs Northeast=1.7; 95% CI 1.1-2.8) and midwestern (RRMidwest vs Northeast=1.6; 95%
CI 0.98-2.7) regions, in rural vs urban areas (RR=1.5; 95% CI 1.0-2.2), and among essential
workers (RR=1.7; 95% CI 1.1-2.5). Household crowding (RR=1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.3), dining
indoors at restaurants/bars (RR=2.0; 95% CI 1.4-2.8), visiting places of worship (RR=2.0; 95%
CI 1.3-2.9), wearing masks sometimes vs always while grocery shopping (RR=2.5; 95% CI 1.34.4), indoor visits with people outside the household with masks (RRalways mask vs no visit=2.6; 95%
CI 1.6-4.4) and without masks (RRsometimes mask vs no visit=3.5; 95% CI 2.7-5.7; RRnever mask vs no
visit=5.3; 95% CI 3.1-8.9); working indoors at a place of employment with masks (RRalways mask vs
no in-person=2.0, 95% CI 1.4-2.8) and without masks (RRsometimes mask vs no in-person= 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-

mask vs no salon/gym=1.7 (95% CI 1.1-2.4), gathering indoors and outdoors in groups of >10 (RR=1.9,
95% CI 1.2-2.0); and air travel during the pandemic (RR=1.7; 95% CI 1.1-2.6) were also
associated with higher incidence rates. Among 303 seropositive individuals, 27.4% had
asymptomatic infection, and 32% reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test or provider
diagnosis of COVID-19. In this group, there were major gaps in the coverage of public health
interventions aimed at isolation (31% isolated) and contact tracing (asked about contacts [18%];
told about exposure to a confirmed case [7.6%]).
Conclusions
Modifiable risk factors and low reach of public health strategies drive SARS-CoV-2 transmission
across the U.S. It is critical to address inequities in incidence, reduce risk factors, and improve
the reach of public health strategies in the vaccine era.

INTRODUCTION

93

As of this writing, about one year after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States

94

(U.S.), there have been more than 25 million SARS-CoV-2 cases diagnosed, 435,000 deaths

95

recorded, and 23.5 million vaccine doses administered.1 As compared to diagnoses, the true

96

number of infections to date in the U.S. is unknown, but national estimates in the general

97

population as measured by seroprevalence have put the cumulative incidence at 10% in

98

September 20202 and 14% as of November 2020.3 One recent study in a nationally

99

representative sample of U.S. adults found that 4.6% had a history of undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2

100
101

as of July 2020: about 5 undiagnosed infections for every diagnosed case.4
A major challenge of controlling community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is that the virus’

102

infectious period allows for onward spread prior to recognition of infection, by the substantial

103

proportion of people with asymptomatic infection, and during the pre-symptomatic period among

104

those who go on to develop symptoms.4,5

105

While SARS-CoV-2 is understood to be transmitted from person-to-person via droplet and

106

airborne spread, to date, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and risk factors for incident

107

infection have not been well-characterized by routine case-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2

108

diagnoses or by cross-sectional seroprevalence studies.1–3 As the pandemic progresses through

109

different seasons and stages, it is critical to continue to characterize COVID-19’s evolving

110

epidemiology and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, the uptake and impact of non-

111

pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)6, and the reach of public health strategies aimed at

112

controlling community transmission, including testing, quarantine, isolation, contact tracing, and

113

vaccination.

114

Researchers and public health practitioners have called for prospective cohort studies to

115

describe incidence rates and how they are influenced by NPI implementation and uptake,

116

sociodemographics, knowledge and behaviors, and other potential risk factors.7 Yet, both the

117

frequency with which many risk factors occur in community samples, as well as the SARS-CoV-

118

2 risk that could be attached to them, still have not been systematically assessed and

119

epidemiologically linked to outcomes like seroconversion. Globally, few prospective

120

epidemiologic studies of SARS-CoV-2 have been published to date. One recent global

121

systematic review of observational studies of SARS-CoV-2 that employed serologic or PCR

122

testing found 18 prospective studies.8 Most were focused on healthcare workers or other

123

occupational groups, individuals in congregate settings, evacuees, or cruise ships; none were

124

community-based (i.e., focused on risk factors in communities vs other higher risk

125

populations/settings).8 A greater understanding of SARS-CoV-2 incidence and risk factors in

126

community samples can substantially complement routine case-based surveillance of new SARS-

127

CoV-2 diagnoses and cross-sectional serosurveys, serving to inform aspects of implementation

128

of the public health response and policies.

129

In late March 2020, we launched the national, prospective Communities, Households and

130

SARS-CoV-2 Epidemiology (CHASING) COVID Cohort.9 We describe the cumulative

131

incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, risk factors for recent SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion, and,

132

for those with serologic evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, the reach and uptake of public

133

health strategies.

134
135

METHODS

136

We used internet-based strategies10–12 to recruit a geographically and socio-demographically

137

diverse cohort of adults in the U.S. and U.S. territories into longitudinal follow-up with at-home

138

specimen collection. To be eligible for inclusion in the cohort, individuals had to: 1) reside in the

139

U.S. or a U.S. territory; 2) be aged 18 years or older; 3) provide a valid email address for follow-

140

up; and 4) demonstrate early engagement in study activities (provided a baseline specimen or

141

completed >1 recruitment/enrollment visits). Details of the study design and recruitment

142

procedures have been described previously.9

143
144

Study measurements

145

Participant interviews. Measures included on the cohort screening, enrollment and follow-up

146

questionnaires were derived from published research10, BRFSS13, 2009 H1N1 influenza

147

studies14,15, and other COVID-19 studies.16 Measures were also developed de novo. Cohort

148

recruitment and enrollment visits were completed between March 28-August 21, 2020, during

149

which multiple rounds of interviews took place. Essential worker status was defined as working

150

in law enforcement, emergency management, delivery, transportation, construction or healthcare

151

at study enrollment. We separated healthcare workers from other essential workers and treated

152

them as distinct categories in our analyses. From follow-up interviews we obtained repeated

153

measurements of symptoms, testing, hospitalizations, quarantine, isolation, contact tracing

154

encounters, and other time-varying factors.

155

At-home specimen collection for serologic testing. As part of study assessments during

156

May-August 2020 (Period 1) and November 2020-January 2021 (Period 2), participants were

157

invited to participate in serologic testing using an at-home self-collected dried blood spot (DBS)

158

specimen collection kit. Consenting participants were mailed a specimen collection kit, which

159

included written instructions and a QR code for an instructional video. DBS cards were sent from
m

160

and returned to the study laboratory (Molecular Testing Laboratories [MTL], Vancouver,

161

Washington) via the U.S. Postal Service (self-addressed, stamped envelope containing a

162

biohazard bag™).

163

Serologic testing. All DBS specimens were tested by the study laboratory for total

164

antibodies (Total Ab) using the Bio-Rad Platelia test for IgA, IgM, and IgG which targets the

165

SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (manufacturer sensitivity 98.0%, specificity 99.3%).17

166

Specimens that were reactive on the Total Ab test were tested further using the Euroimmun IgG

167

test which targets the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (manufacturer sensitivity 100%; specificity

168

99%).17 Both assays received Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug

169

Administration and were further validated for use with DBS by the study laboratory using

170

confirmed, true positive and negative patient specimens. In these local validations, both assays

171

were found to have 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity (MTL, personal communication).

172

Cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Among participants who underwent

173

serologic testing, we estimated the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 as the proportion of

174

individuals with a positive Total Ab test in either of the two time periods (i.e., number of

175

participants ever-positive) divided by the total number of persons with one or more Total Ab

176

tests (i.e., number of participants ever tested). We adjusted cumulative incidence estimates for

177

laboratory test error as reported by the kit manufacturer. Crude cumulative incidence estimates

178

are presented alongside adjusted estimates in supplemental tables. Unless otherwise specified, all

179

cumulative incidence estimates presented are adjusted for laboratory test error using the

180

following formula18:

182

Observed SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion and seroreversion. Among those individuals with

183

two Total Ab tests, an observed seroconversion was defined as a negative Total Ab test in Period

184

1 followed by a positive Total Ab test in Period 2. We estimated the rate of seroconversion per

185

100 person years of follow-up using the collection dates for each specimen. Person-time at risk

186

began at the time of dried blood spot sample collection for the first serologic test or date the lab

187

received the sample if collection date was missing. The seroconversion date was assigned as the

188

midpoint between the first and second sample collection dates. Observed seroreversion was

189

defined as a positive Total Ab test in Period 1 followed by a negative Total Ab test in Period 2.

190
191

Statistical analysis

192

Cumulative incidence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were stratified by

193

enrollment characteristics and risk factors acertained prior to specimen collection. Incidence

194

proportions (observed seroconversions) were also stratified by risk factors measured prior to the

195

date of specimen collection in Period 2. All data were cleaned and analyzed in R (version 4.0.3)

196

and SAS (V9.4). Data were geocoded based on a self-reported ZIP code, and maps were created

197

in ArcGIS 10.7. For categorical variables with missing data frequency <5%, we imputed missing

198

data for participants using the most common value among all participants for a given variable.

199

Ethical Approval

201

The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the City University of

202

RESULTS

205

The characteristics of the cohort are shown in Table 1, which includes participants from all 50

206

U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam (see Fig. S1). Of the 6,745

207

participants enrolled in the cohort, 4,459 (66%) had at least one serologic test (Table 1).

208

Compared with the entire cohort, those who underwent any serologic testing were older and

209

more likely to be non-Hispanic White, college educated, and less likely to be healthcare workers

210

or essential workers. 4,235 persons underwent serologic testing in Period 1, and 3,615 persons

211

tested in Period 2. A total of 3,339 persons tested at both time points, including 3,280 who were

212

seronegative on their antibody test in Period 1 and who could be followed prospectively for the

infection through the end of observation (January 31, 2021) were 6.8% (95% CI 6.1%-7.6%) and
nd

222

6.3% (95% CI 5.5%-7.1%), respectively (Table S2). Cumulative incidence rates declined in

223

dose-response fashion with increasing age, with substantially lower incidence in those aged 60

224

years and older (Figure 1). Higher cumulative incidence estimates were observed among males

225

(7.8%, 95% CI 6.6%-9.0%), Hispanics 10.2% (95% CI 7.8%-12.6%), non-Hispanic Blacks

226

(7.9%, 95% CI 5%-10.8%), those with a high school education (9.1%, 95% CI 0.9-20.9) or less

227

(8.0%, 95% CI 5.2-10.9%), and those in the Northeast (7.8%, 95% CI 6.3%-9.4%). Lower

228

cumulative incidence estimates were observed among persons aged 60 years and over (3.8%,

229

95% CI 2.5%-5.2%), those whose gender identity was non-binary (2.5%, 95% CI 0.4%-5.5%),

and those who were retired (3.4%, 95% CI 1.7%-4.9%).

245

People living with HIV had the highest cumulative incidence among those with comorbidities

246

(8.8%, 95% CI 5.5%-13.6%) over the entire study period, however, those with diabetes had the

247

highest cumulative incidence in Period 2 (Table S3). In terms of other potential risk factors,

248

those who reported recently drinking more than 6 alcoholic drinks on one occasion (9.9%, 95%

CI 6.6%-14.3%) and those who used public transportation (8.6%, 95% CI 5.7%-12.6%) had

250

higher cumulative incidence (Fig. 2, Table S3). Lower cumulative incidence was observed

initially seronegative persons who had a subsequent serologic test during November 2020-

262

January 2021 (Fig. S2), stratified by risk factors that were present prior to or between serologic

263

tests. There were 145 observed seroconversions over 1,562 person years of follow-up among thee

264

3,280 participants, for an overall incidence rate of 9.3 per 100 person years (PY) (95% CI 7.9-

267

(RR 1.79, 95% CI 0.96-3.13) compared with non-Hispanic Whites. In contrast to cumulative

268

incidence estimates, incidence rates reflecting more recent seroconversions were higher among

269

those in rural versus urban areas (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.04-2.22), those in the Midwest (RR 1.62,

2.2) compared to the Northeast. Of note, essential workers had higher incidence than non-

272

essential workers (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.09--2.46).

Clinical and public health outcomes among persons with serologic evidence of SARS-CoV-

300

2 infection

301

Among the 303 individuals who were positive for Total Ab during the study, only 121 (39.9%)

302

were aware that they had a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table S6). A substantial proportion of

303

the 303 (27.4%) recalled no symptoms of COVID-like illness (i.e., were asymptomatic cases).

304

Among the 145 more recent seroconverters in Period 2, the proportion reporting no symptoms

305

was 25.5%, and another 60% reported milder symptoms that did not result in seeking care.

306

In terms of public health outcomes, 64.4% (195/303) said that they were tested for SARS-

307

CoV-2 outside the study (Table S6), half of them (32% of total) reported having a positive

308

SARS-CoV-2 test. However, only 30.7% of all 303 seropositives said that they had isolated

309

themselves from people outside their household because of their infection, and, among those

310

who did not live alone, even fewer (13.5% overall) said they isolated themselves from others

311

within their household. In terms of contact tracing, 17.8% of all seropositives were asked about

312

contacts following diagnosis and only 12.2% of all seropositives had been informed by a contact

313

tracer that they may have had contact with someone confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2. Only 5.3%

314

of those diagnosed (3.3% of all seropositives) were told by a contact tracer to stay home for a

315

period of time because they had COVID-19.

316
317

Repeat serologic testing outcomes

318

A total of 303 persons who were ever seropositive by the Total Ab test contributed 392

319

seropositive Total Ab test results over the course of the study (Table S7). This included 134

320

persons with a positive Total Ab test in Period 1 and 258 in Period 2. Of the 258 Total Ab

321

positives in Period 2, 145 were recent seroconverters. There were 20 individuals who were Total

322

Ab positive in Period 1 but Total Ab negative in Period 2 (i.e., seroreverters and/or false

323

positives). Specifically, of 134 persons who tested Total Ab positive in Period 1 and had a

324

second test in Period 2, only 114 (85%) were still seropositive in Period 2. The median time

325

between specimen collection for these 20 individuals was 197 days (IQR 187-201 days). Of the

326

392 specimens that were positive on the Total Ab test from Period 1 or 2, 361 had sufficient

327

specimen quantity for further testing. Of these, 63.4% (201/361) were also positive on the spike

328

protein-based IgG test, including 65.7% (88/127) in Period 1, and 42.1% (113/234) in Period 2

329

(Table S7).

DISCUSSION
We report findings from one of the first community-based prospective epidemiologic studies

333

of SARS-CoV-2 incidence and risk factors, globally. We have prospectively characterized the

334

risk of incident SARS-CoV-2 infection in relation to a range of modifiable risk factors in the

335

U.S., using information on both past infection and recent seroconversion. With a well-

336

characterized sample of participants with evidence of prior infection, our study suggests that

337

public health strategies being widely used with the aim of reducing onward transmission

338

(quarantine, testing, isolation, and contact tracing) do not have high enough coverage during the

339

infectious period of SARS-CoV-2 to be effective at controlling community spread.

340

These are among the principal reasons why the U.S. has seen unmitigated increases in

341

community transmission, hospitalizations, and deaths from COVID-19. Unless and until herd

342

immunity can be achieved through a combination of natural infection and vaccine-induced

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.12.21251659; this version posted February 16, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

343

immunity, more nuanced understanding of the actual contribution of these factors over time is

344

needed. This in turn will facilitate more effective government and community public health

345

policies, actions and implementation strategies to control community spread, which is key to

346

preventing avoidable hospitalizations and deaths, and ultimately maximizing the impact of

347

vaccines. In areas where there is not an enforced lock down, our findings provide an evidence-

348

base for federal, state, and local policy focus on risk factors that appear to be potential drivers of

349

late-phase pandemic spread, such as indoor dining, mass gatherings, or not wearing masks when

350

outside the home.

351

Data on more recent seroconversions occurring between May 2020 and January 2021 in our

352

cohort suggest that elevated risk among essential workers, observed early in the U.S. pandemic,

353

has persisted. Essential workers risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2 not only in their workplace(s),

354

but also in their communities and as part of their commutes to and from work if they need to use

355

public transportation. The increased burden of risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in essential

356

workers is then shared with their household members, among whom transmission is very

357

efficient.19 Along with this comes a higher burden of stress and anxiety among essential

358

workers.20 The most immediate action that governments can take to help keep essential workers

359

safe is to minimize community transmission so that they are less likely to be exposed in the

360

workplace or as part of their commutes. Policies and other strategies should be considered and

361

implemented to ensure workplace safety (high quality masks, distancing, ventilation, paid sick

362

leave for those that cannot afford to miss work) and the safety of public transportation. Any

363

strategies should include prioritized access to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for essential workers and,

364

until or in the absence of vaccination, rapid testing for essential workers and members of their

365

households. FDA-approved fully at-home rapid testing options are becoming more readily

366

available with or without a prescription, and past research has indicated an overall increase in the

367

uptake of testing with the addition of at-home testing options,21,22 making them a potentially

368

important strategy to increase early identification of new infections and subsequent interventions

369

to prevent onward transmission. In this later phase of the pandemic, healthcare workers in our

370

cohort had borderline elevated risk. Healthcare workers in the U.S. could be expected to have

371

lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in the workplace due to focused efforts to mitigate risk via

372

improved access to personal protective equipment and engineering controls. However, healthcare

373

workers also have ongoing community exposure, including possibly during their commutes to

374

and from work, that could put them at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and acquisition.

375

Our study provides epidemiologic evidence of increased risk for a number of key exposures.

376

Living in more crowded households, defined as living in a multi-unit (i.e., apartment) building

377

with 4 or more household members, was associated with a 60% higher incidence of SARS-CoV-

378

2 infection compared with those living in less crowded households. Household transmission of

379

SARS-CoV-2 occurs with very high attack rates, and may also increase the risk of more severe

380

COVID-19 disease, requiring hospitalization.23 Household crowding, more than population

381

density, was shown to be a characteristic of community transmission ‘hotspots’ in a recent

382

ecological analysis from the early phase of the pandemic.24 When there are possible or confirmed

383

cases of SARS-CoV-2 among household members, when background community transmission is

384

substantial, or when the possibility of exposure outside the household is high (e.g., essential

385

workers), our study and others25 suggest mask use in the household should be considered,

386

especially when it is otherwise not possible to limit potential exposure and spread in the

387

household by isolating or sequestering away from others. As the vaccine rollout continues, this is

388

particularly important to protect unvaccinated household members who may be at high risk for a

389

severe COVID-19 outcome.

390

We characterized the potential contribution of several other key risk factors, some of which

391

have been, or could be, the focus of state and federal policies, including dining indoors at a

392

restaurant/bar, visiting a place of worship, inconsistent mask use while grocery shopping or

393

visiting non-household members indoors (especially without masks), visiting a salon/gym,

394

gathering indoors in groups of 10 or more, and recent travel by airplane during the pandemic.

395

Working indoors, even while always masking but especially while never wearing a mask, was

396

strongly associated with higher infection rates. In addition to being potential individual policy

397

focus areas, we note that all of these risks can be mitigated by social distancing, workplace

398

safety, increased mask use, use of more effective masks (e.g., KN95), and use of more than one

399

mask.26–28

400

Finally, detailed examination of 303 individuals with serologic evidence of past SARS-CoV-

401

2 infection showed major gaps in the reach of public health interventions aimed at testing, self-

402

isolation, and contact tracing for people with SARS-CoV-2 (and their contacts). Indeed, many

403

with evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection did not report a prior positive PCR test, and a

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.12.21251659; this version posted February 16, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

404

substantial proportion were asymptomatic, both greatly hindering the ability of public health

405

efforts to control spread. Furthermore, few people who had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2

406

infection in our study reported having been reached by contact tracers. When considering the

407

large proportion of people with SARS-CoV-2 who have asymptomatic infection, undiagnosed

408

infection (with or without symptoms), the low likelihood of diagnosis during the pre-

409

symptomatic phase, the high number of new daily diagnoses and the often long delay between

410

testing and return of results, contact tracing (a strategy that requires rapid response and action

411

with high coverage early in the infectious period) is likely not a feasible strategy to control

412

community spread in the U.S.. Limited public health resources may be better spent instead on

413

messaging that emphasizes the importance of self-isolation after symptom onset or a positive

414

test. Verbal, written and electronic (SMS text, email) messaging should occur at the time of the

415

test, rather than after results are returned. In the event of a positive result, messaging at the time

416

of testing should also include instructions to notify close contacts, including in workplaces, that

417

they should quarantine and, if symptoms develop, self-isolate.

418

A shift in emphasis and resources away from contact tracing as a strategy to control

419

community spread would provide much needed resources at the state and local level to facilitate

420

more rapid and targeted delivery of vaccination, which has faltered in many areas to date. Many

421

in our cohort, as across the U.S., are not yet vaccinated, not yet eligible for or are not currently

422

willing to undergo vaccination29, and will remain at risk for months to come. Accelerating

423

vaccine rollout, especially among those at high risk for a severe SARS-CoV-2 outcome and

424

essential workers, has the potential to save tens of thousands of lives.

425

All of the potential risk factors described in our study and the low uptake of public health

426

strategies conspire to create a perpetually disparate burden of risk among Hispanic and non-

427

Hispanic Black persons and essential workers, as well as their household members and their

428

communities. Our study suggests these inequalities have not been addressed to date in the U.S.,

429

and the ultimate drivers, which relate to structural racism and possibly other factors, need to be

430

unpacked by health departments and researchers.30 There has been much research focused on

431

comorbid medical conditions and other biologic factors that may increase the risk of SARS-

432

CoV-2 acquisition or severity.31–33 However, non-biological structural factors are the major

433

drivers of COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes, and the inequities by race/ethnicity,

434

occupation, geography, and income. These non-biological structural factors, such as household

435

crowding, the need to go to work to avoid income loss, and inequitable access to SARS-CoV-2

436

testing34, create a disparate burden of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and incidence.35 To date, no

437

targeted strategies or policies have been deployed that aim to protect those who cannot afford

438

missing work, including, but not only, essential workers. These disparities in SARS-CoV-2

439

exposure, incidence, hospitalization and death will likely be perpetuated and likely exacerbated

440

by differential uptake of the COVID-19 vaccines, driven by potentially flawed implementation

441

strategies that prevent equitable access to vaccination. It is incumbent upon public health leaders,

442

decision makers, and policy makers to anticipate and proactively design pandemic response

443

implementation strategies, including metrics, that account for and counteract the fundamental

444

and prevailing structural forces that without fail will otherwise create, perpetuate, or exacerbate

445

inequities in safety, health and well-being.36–39

446

Strengths of our cohort study include its prospective design, allowing direct observation of

447

seroconversions and incident COVID-19 infection among those who had no serologic evidence

448

of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, with and without risk factors. Our cohort is also geographically

449

and sociodemographically diverse, facilitating assessment of geographic differences and

450

racial/ethnic disparities. We also measured and were able to estimate incidence rates associated

451

with a range of relevant epidemiologic risk factors.

452

Our study also has limitations worth noting. Most research studies deployed in the middle of

453

a pandemic, including ours, may produce biased estimates since they may not include complete

454

information on participants who died from COVID-19, or were too sick or otherwise too busy to

455

participate in the research activities, or enrolled but became lost to follow-up. Moreover, it is

456

possible that those who thought they had SARS-CoV-2 or were tested outside the study may

457

have been more or less likely to participate in follow-up serologic testing, which would lead our

458

seroincidence estimates to be biased in either direction. However, there was no systematic

459

difference between those who tested in Period 1 and Period 2 (Table S1). Separately, while we

460

have corrected our cumulative incidence estimates for laboratory test error18, the observed

461

cumulative incidence in our cohort may be lower than the true cumulative incidence in our

462

cohort because of waning of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Recent studies suggest waning of

463

antibodies to both nucleocapsid and spike proteins2, which combined with the timing of

464

specimen collection relative to infection for many participants in our cohort (median of 190

465

days)9, could mean that we have underestimated the true cumulative incidence. Next, as with any

466

observational cohort study, estimated associations between SARS-CoV-2 risk factors and

467

incidence are subject to confounding. The crude associations we presented could be over- or

468

underestimated, and also may vary by setting. For example, the effect of indoor dining may be

different in areas of lower versus higher levels of community transmission. Our study also had

470

limited statistical power due to our sample size and the relatively short duration of follow-up.

471

Finally, while our study is well-suited to characterize the risks related to SARS-CoV-2

472

acquisition, it is less well-suited to examine factors related to onward transmission from

473

participants who had SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, in lieu of this, we have endeavored to

474

describe the coverage of public health-related outreach to persons in our cohort who had

475

evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection and identified some areas in need of improvement, such

476

as the need for improvements in the uptake of testing and self-isolation.

477
478

Conclusion

479

Modifiable risk factors and poor reach of public health strategies continue to drive transmission

480

of SARS-CoV-2 across the U.S.. It is critical to address inequities in incidence, reduce risk

481

factors, and improve the reach of public health strategies of testing and self-isolation in the

482

vaccine era. Given the properties of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including the substantial

483

asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic phases during the SARS-CoV-2 infectious period, the

484

magnitude of cases and the need to act quickly, contact tracing is not a viable public health

485

strategy to control the spread of the pandemic in the U.S.. Our cumulative incidence estimates

486

suggest that many in our cohort remain at risk for SARS-CoV-2, including those with risk factors

487

for infection and severe disease. While SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will likely reduce the risk of

488

COVID-19 disease and possibly SARS-CoV-2 acquisition substantially for this group, this will

489

likely take some time due to both the pace of the vaccine rollout and vaccine hesitancy. The

490

CHASING COVID Cohort Study will continue to monitor SARS-CoV-2 outcomes, including

491

vaccine uptake, through December 2021.
