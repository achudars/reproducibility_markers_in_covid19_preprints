Abstract
Background: The early COVID-19 pandemic has been characterized by rapid global spread. In the
United States National Capital Region, over 2,000 cases were reported within three weeks of its first
detection in March 2020. We aimed to use genomic sequencing to understand the initial spread of
SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the region. By correlating genetic information to
disease phenotype, we also aimed to gain insight into any correlation between viral genotype and
case severity or transmissibility.
Methods: ​We performed whole genome sequencing of clinical SARS-CoV-2 samples collected in
March 2020 by the Johns Hopkins Health System. We analyzed these regional SARS-CoV-2
genomes alongside detailed clinical metadata and the global phylogeny to understand early
establishment of the virus within the region.
Results: ​We analyzed 620 samples from the Johns Hopkins Health System collected between March
11–31, 2020, comprising 37.3% of the total cases in Maryland during this period. We selected 143 of
these samples for sequencing, generating 114 complete viral genomes. These genomes belong to all
five major Nextstrain-defined clades, suggesting multiple introductions into the region and
underscoring the diversity of the regional epidemic. We also found that clinically severe cases had
genomes belonging to all of these clades.
Conclusions: ​We established a pipeline for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing within the Johns Hopkins Health
system, which enabled us to capture the significant viral diversity present in the region as early as
March 2020. ​Efforts to control local spread of the virus were likely confounded by the number of
introductions into the region early in the epidemic and interconnectedness of the region as a
whole.

Introduction
Within two months of its emergence in Wuhan, China in early 2020, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that
causes COVID-19, had established itself worldwide​1​: as of July 30, 2020, over 10 million confirmed
COVID-19 cases and 650,000 deaths have been reported​2​. The enormous health and economic
impacts of this virus have led to considerable interest into understanding its origin, spread, and
evolution. Generation and analysis of pathogen genomic data has been a key component of this
research​3–8 and promises to provide critical insights into not only the emergence and spread of
SARS-CoV-2, but the dynamics of emerging infections in general.
In the United States, diagnostic capacity for SARS-CoV-2 was limited until early March 2020 due to
regulatory challenges associated with limited Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for
laboratory-developed testing. Retrospective analyses of patient samples using genomic and
serological methods now suggests that community transmission was occuring in major US cities in
late January and early February of that year​9–11​. Ongoing work has continued to deepen our
understanding of SARS-CoV-2, including use of pathogen sequence data to help reconstruct the
transmission of the virus into and around the United States​12​.
Coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, possess an RNA polymerase with proofreading activity that
limits genetic variability 13​
​ . This genome replication feature, combined with rapid spread and limited or
no host immunity during the early phase of the pandemic, has likely limited evolutionary pressure and
contributed to the limited genetic diversity observed in SARS-CoV-2 sequences. Efforts to describe
this diversity during the early phase of the pandemic have resulted in multiple clade designation
systems including those used by the Global Information Sharing of All Influenza Data (GISAID), the
NextStrain platform, and COVID-19 Genomics UK consortium (COG-UK)​14–16​. These approaches are
intended to be dynamic, and are updated as new diversity is observed in the global sequence data.
For example, NextStrain clade designations are broadly separated by viruses that originated in China
in 2019 (Clade 19) and those that were later introduced into Europe early 2020 (Clade 20)​15​.
Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 clade designations are only intended to identify subgroups of virus
sequences that share common genetic features, and further ​in vitro or clinical characterization is
required to identify functional differences between clades.
Using sequence data to investigate relationships between virus genetics and patient clinical outcome
often relies on specimen repositories or agreements with sample collection facilities that provide
limited access to patient demographic and clinical information. Limited access is due to both logistical
challenges in obtaining this data and ethical concerns around patient privacy​17​. Therefore, while
research efforts have produced copious amounts of valuable genetic data and insights into viral
circulation 12,18​
​
, studies linking pathogen genetics to demographics, disease severity, and other clinical
outcomes are less frequent. By leveraging existing internal networks and established research
protocols, research groups within large health systems can fill this gap by rapidly creating and
analyzing datasets that link pathogen genomics with clinical and demographic outcomes.
To gain insight into regional viral spread and potential associations between pathogen genetics and
clinical outcomes, we performed rapid whole genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from
clinical samples in the Johns Hopkins Health System (JHHS). For this work we used the Oxford

Nanopore sequencing platform, which has been increasingly used during early outbreak investigations
to understand emerging pathogens​19,20​. In the process of establishing SARS-CoV-2 sequencing
capacity within the JHHS, we developed a number of data analysis improvements that increase
confidence in identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms from Oxford Nanopore sequencing data.
Here, we explore the relationship between local sequences and those from the broader national and
global epidemic, and look for possible associations between clade structure and clinical outcomes.

The Maryland, District of Columbia (DC), and Virginia area is designated as the United States
National Capital Region — an area of high domestic and international transit as well as geopolitical
importance. The Johns Hopkins Health System (JHHS) is spread throughout the region, including 39
hospitals and clinics throughout Maryland and DC, with a patient population that also includes
residents of Northern Virginia. The first detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the region was reported on March
5, 2020 by the Maryland Department of Health, and a State of Emergency was immediately declared

in Maryland 21​
​ . Two days later cases were reported by the Public Health Departments in Virginia and
Washington DC. On March 23​rd​, the Maryland state government instituted regional closure of
non-essential businesses, and a stay at home order followed on March 30​th​ (​Fig 1A​).
Molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 at the Johns Hopkins Hospital Medical Microbiology laboratory
began March 11th using the RealStar SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR kit from Altona Diagnostics, which was
granted Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) after analytical
validation​22​. The Altona test targets both lineage B betacoronavirus E genes and the SARS-CoV-2 S
gene. In the last week of March, the laboratory also began the use of the Cepheid Xpert Xpress
SARS-CoV-2 assay granted FDA EUA, which targets the E and N2 genes. The laboratory evaluated a
total of 5,913 nasopharyngeal swabs and confirmed 620 COVID-19 positive between March
11–March 31, 2020 (10.4% overall positivity rate) (​Table S1​). In total, 603 positive diagnoses were
made with the Altona assay in this time period, and 17 positive diagnoses were made with the
Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. This represented 37.3% of the 1660 confirmed COVID-19
cases in Maryland during this period (​Fig 1A​).
We found that the cycle threshold (C​T​) value of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing was associated with
self-reported days from symptom onset (Spearman correlation: ⍴=0.35) (​Fig 1B​). The majority of
patients diagnosed were older than 30 years (85%; ​Fig 1C)​. Gender distribution was roughly equal
within the patient population (49% female, 51% male; ​Table S2​). Patient home residence was
captured for 592/620 positive tests, with 82% (n=485) indicating a home address in Maryland, 14%
(n=80) in DC, and 1% (n=≤5) in Virginia. The first three digits of patient home zip codes were used to
understand the geographic distribution of patients from the National Capital Region (​Fig S1​). The
remaining 23 patients (4%) listed primary residences in 11 different states.
Sequenced Samples and Characteristics of the Virus
We selected 143 samples for whole genome sequencing based on the availability of residual RNA
following the diagnostic PCR. Samples were sequenced in two phases, with the first phase enriched
for patients admitted to the ICU (55 samples collected March 11-21​st​, containing 14 patients admitted
to the ICU), and the second a convenience sample that captured as many samples as possible for
sequencing, irrespective of disease severity (88 samples collected March 13-31​st​, containing 10
patients admitted to the ICU).
We performed multiplexed pooled amplicon sequencing as described by the ARTIC network​23 on
Oxford Nanopore instruments (GridION, MinION).We generated 114 complete genomes from the 143
attempted (76%), defined as those that have at least 27,000 (out of 29,903) unambiguous nucleotides
(see ​Methods​). For validation purposes, a subset of 31 samples were also sequenced on an Illumina
MiSeq from the same amplicons (​Table S3​). Sequenced samples ranged in C​T from 14 to 38 and
samples with C​T values less than 30 produced a larger proportion of complete genomes (86%) than
samples with higher C​T values
(39%) (​Fig 2A​). This is consistent with other SARS-CoV-2 sequencing
​
studies using the Oxford Nanopore platform​3,24​. We found no bias in our ability to generate complete
genomes across key metadata categories, such as patient age, patient sex, and sample collection
date (​Fig 2B-D​).

The 114 complete genomes correspond to approximately ~18% of JHHS-confirmed cases in March.
Incomplete genomes were primarily due to ​amplicon dropout (26/34 failed samples), leading to
stretches of ambiguous basecalls across the genome (​Fig 2E​). Despite these ambiguities,
SARS-CoV-2 sequences can be grouped into clusters (or phylogenetic clades) based on a small
number of variant sites in high quality regions (​Table S4​).

The 114 sequences were on average 98.6% complete, and we identified a total of 153 unique,

non-synonymous variants, 8 noncoding variants) compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2
reference genome (accession: MN908947.3) with a range of 2–14 variants per genome. In some
samples, we also observed a previously-identified cluster of three nucleotide mutations starting at

position 28,881 that always occur together, resulting in two amino acid changes. Within the 114
complete genomes, 20 had one or two mixed sites (25-75% alternate allele frequency), which we
replaced with IUPAC ambiguity codes​25​. 12/21 of these non-N ambiguities were at putative C-to-T
mutations. We identified 5 clusters of sequences based on their polymorphisms, which correspond to
phylogenetic clades (​Fig 2E​). Over half of the sequences (52%) share 5 variants (​Fig 2F​), which
corresponds to the phylogenetic clade 20C​15 (​Table S3​). Within the established clades, we identified 7
small groups of sequences from our National Capital Region dataset (3-14 sequences per group) that
share two or more additional single nucleotide variants (​Fig S2​, ​Table S3​).
The amplicon dropout we observed in our incomplete sequences also occurred​, to a lesser extent, in
our complete sequences — shown as stretches of ambiguous nucleotide calls (​Fig 2E​). In addition to
amplicon dropout, evidence of contamination and a high proportion of mixed sites also prevented
inclusion of genomes in our final dataset. We observed a small number of sequences (3) that had five
or more mixed positions (alternate allele frequency 25-75%, see ​Methods​), which required further
validation and were not included in the 114 complete genomes used in subsequent analyses. And,
despite establishing controlled laboratory workspaces to avoid cross-contamination, we occasionally
observed amplification from specific primer sets in negative control samples on a subset of
sequencing runs, which caused us to discard the entire sequencing run from analysis. In a small
number of cases (5), lack of original specimen availability prevented resequencing and complete
genome generation.
To validate our variant calls, we used multiple sequencing approaches, resequencing 31 of the 114
complete genomes on the Illumina platform. We independently called variants from each platform and
observed that all Oxford Nanopore variants above 25% allele frequency were also detected using
Illumina, and vice versa (​Fig S3A​). We also examined variant sites where resulting in differing
consensus nucleotides across the two platforms (due to ambiguity in one consensus and a variant call
in the other). Of 280 variant calls made using Oxford Nanopore sequencing, 251 (90%) had the same
consensus nucleotide when using Illumina. Of the 29 positions where the consensus calls differed, all
but three were due to artificially low Oxford Nanopore allele frequencies at homopolymer sites (with
over half occurring at position 3,037) (​Fig S3B​, ​Fig S4A​).
Oxford Nanopore sequencing has known difficulties basecalling in homopolymeric regions​26​, so we
were able to correct homopolymer-induced ambiguities in variant sites in our analysis pipeline, thus
increasing our confidence in variant calls made on the Oxford Nanopore platform. We also note that
the ambiguous basecalls observed in most of our samples at positions 1001, 24981, and 24982 are
due to similar issues in homopolymeric regions, but we were only able to systematically correct this
issue at variant sites (​Fig 2E​, dark blue). We further validated Oxford Nanopore variants by comparing
the results from multiple variant callers. We found Nanopolish to be most reliable for SARS-CoV-2
data, though our pipeline automatically calls variants with multiple callers and reports any
discrepancies between them (see ​Methods​)27​
​ .
In addition to basecalling issues in homopolymeric regions, we also observed a strand-specific bias to
Oxford Nanopore sequencing at some sites (​Fig S4B​). This bias can occur when the sequence

context is more difficult to basecall in one direction, and is corrected in our pipeline by requiring that
putative variant alleles are found on reads in both directions.

reviews captured patient data including comorbidities, symptoms, and disease severity (​Table S2​).
We also looked for likely local transmission events, identified by the absence of reported travel in the
three weeks prior to diagnosis, as well as likely travel-related importations from locations with known
outbreaks in the same time period. In total, 32 (22%) had potential travel exposure from locations with
early outbreaks, including England, California, Colorado, New York, and Idaho (Travel history; ​Fig
3B​), and 66 (46%) of patients reported having been exposed in a high risk scenario (Known COVID
contact; ​Fig 3B​). The 111 (78%) individuals that contracted the virus without reported travel history
suggest that community transmission was occuring at this early stage of the pandemic.
Similar to larger studies​24​, we observed a broad distribution of patient outcomes across the full
diversity of SARS-CoV-2 mutations. We observed that severe cases, defined as admission to the ICU
(including patients requiring ventilator support), had viral genomes belonging to all five major
phylogenetic clades (​Fig 3A​). Similarly, patient phenotypes including sex, race, recent travel,
symptoms, and comorbidities were represented across all five major phylogenetic clades, suggesting
that susceptbility was independent of clade (​Fig 3B​).
The widely-examined mutation in the viral spike protein (D614G)​28–30 is one of the key mutations
differentiating the 19 and 20 clades. Notably, we see severe cases in both of these clades, though our
dataset is underpowered to show significant correlations between viral genome mutations and disease
severity. The diversity of virus genetics, clinical symptoms, and patient outcomes suggests that viral
mutations are not the main driver of clinical presentation​31,32​.
Evaluation of Regional and Global SARS-CoV-2 Genetic Diversity
We compared sequences from the National Capital Region to others from around the world to better
understand how the virus entered and spread within the region early in the outbreak. We performed
phylogenetic analysis using JHHS-generated sequences and a globally-representative reference
dataset containing all published sequences collected in Maryland, DC, and Virginia through the end of
March 2020 (​Fig 4A​). We see that all major viral clades were represented in the region during this
period, suggesting five or more separate introductions, though most sequences belong to clade 20C.
Within each clade, we see groups of highly similar or even identical sequences (​Fig 2E​), suggesting
that community transmission followed the initial introductions. We also note the presence of a 19B
sub-clade containing especially divergent sequences from Maryland and elsewhere. Further studies
will be required to understand if the mutation rate is higher in the 19B sub-clade, or if the long branch
length to this group is due to biased sampling in global sequence databases.
We also looked specifically at viral genetic diversity within the National Capital Region, as compared
to the total genetic diversity observed in other regions in the US and around the world. We found that
the average pairwise viral diversity observed between sequences in the JHHS Maryland dataset is
comparable to that of global sequences, concordant with our observation that regional sequences
belong to all five major clades (​Fig 4B​, ​Fig S5​). This observation may reflect the national and
international connectivity of the entire National Capital Region, as well as the travel patterns of
individuals in this region, which includes two major metropolitan areas and three international airports.

We also observed higher mean pairwise genetic distance in the JHHS dataset from Maryland
(JHHS-MD) than other data from this state (MD other). Other published sequences from Maryland
were submitted by public health laboratories, and lower genetic distances may reflect sequencing of
connected clusters of cases during outbreak investigation. The average pairwise genetic distance is

lower in other parts of the region (DC and Virginia) than in Maryland, though it is clear that there are
sequences from multiple clades present in both locations. It is unclear if the lower observed average
distance in both JHHS and other sequences from DC is a reflection of movement patterns of
individuals within that nearby area or simply lower sample size (only 32 sequences from DC are in our
dataset, compared to 82 total sequences from Maryland). Published sequences collected in Virginia
suggest its genetic diversity falls between that of Maryland and DC, but Virginia is a large state, and
without more detailed location information for these sequences it is difficult to determine if the
sequences truly represent the diversity circulating in the state as a whole (​Fig 4B​,​ Fig S5​).
We also analyzed datasets containing sequences from other US states that experienced outbreaks
early in the epidemic. We see that the distribution of viral diversity in the National Capital Region looks
very different from diversity in states such as Louisiana and Idaho, which show very low mean genetic
diversity during the early epidemic. This could be due to sampling of specific clusters of cases as
described above (e.g., cases from the ski resort outbreak in Idaho 33​
​ ), or could occur if early cases in
these states were seeded by a single source. This stands in contrast to the outbreaks in Washington
and New York, for which sequence data clearly shows multiple introductions 5​​ . As expected, the
diversity of the viral population (the full distribution of pairwise genetic distances) in New York appears
to be similar to that of the National Capital Region, as the outbreaks in both regions were seeded
multiple times and contain sequences predominantly belonging to the 2020 (20A, 20B, 20C) clades
(​Fig 4A–B​,​ Fig S5​).
Finally, we examined viral genetic diversity within and across the National Capital Region, separating
this area into sub-regions defined by the first 3 digits of their ZIP code (ZIP3 area). We found that
three ZIP3 locations with the highest number of cases in Maryland and DC each had sequences from
4 or 5 of the major clades, and that all but one ZIP3 location had sequences from more than one clade
(​Fig 4C​). We do not observe distinct segregation of viral lineages to particular locations within the
region, which highlights both the rapid spread of the virus early in the pandemic and the
interconnectedness of this region.

Discussion
Our genomic dataset from the National Capital Region revealed diversity rivaling that of the worldwide
phylogeny, even in an early phase of the epidemic. Sequences from the region belonged to all five
major phylogenetic clades, suggesting multiple and diverse introductions from regional or international
locations. We also observe minimal diversity within each of these specific clades, suggesting
transmission of the virus within local communities after an initial introduction. This pattern of diversity
highlights the connectedness of the region to both the national and global epidemic, and the
challenges that would likely confront any control strategy predicated on low rates of introduction.
The diversity we observe within the region is also visible on smaller geographic scales, with multiple
clades represented within each ZIP3 region in Maryland and in DC. This suggests significant
movement of viral lineages within the National Capital Region before regional closures were
implemented at the end of March, likely due to local transport and a large number of commuters
between Maryland and DC. Further research on more recent COVID-19 cases will be needed to
understand how national, state and city-based regulations limiting travel and implementing physical

distancing recommendations affected these patterns of spread, as well as the impact of subsequent
easing of these restrictions.
The diversity of sequences within this region, combined with detailed clinical metadata obtained
through the Johns Hopkins Health System, allowed us to explore the relationship between the
SARS-CoV-2 virus and patient presentation and outcome. Specifically, we looked for viral genotypes
that demonstrated a connection to disease severity, comorbidities, or patient demographics such as
gender and race. We found no clear correlation, but were limited by sample size. It will be important to
continue to analyze genomic data alongside clinical metadata as the number of available viral
genomes increases to look for potentially subtle associations between the viral genome and patient
characteristics​32​.
The analyses described above rely on complete and accurate SARS-CoV-2 sequences. We used a
tiled amplicon sequencing approach on the Oxford Nanopore platform to generate sequencing data
and found that we were able to achieve complete genomes for a substantial portion of samples
attempted. As in previous studies 24​
​ , we found that samples with higher virus titer (low C​T value) more
reliably produce complete genomes, and these values can be used to triage samples for sequencing
when resources are limited. We also observed some correlation between days from symptom onset
and C​T value, suggesting that epidemiological surveillance may be most effective if patients are
captured early in their course of infection.
We also performed validation on our sequences by using multiple variant callers to detect variants,
and by sequencing a subset of samples on the Illumina platform. We found that amplicon-based
sequencing with Oxford Nanopore generates correct consensus genome sequences (as compared to
Illumina sequences), but with some added ambiguities in specific problematic regions, especially
homopolymers. We have developed a pipeline that corrects and flags these issues, and it is our hope
that highlighting them in this paper contributes to the overall quality of SARS-CoV-2 sequences
generated with this widely-used platform that enables rapid sequencing in a variety of settings.
Moving forward, the pipelines established here will be critical to using genomic surveillance to inform
the COVID-19 public health response. When confronting a new disease, the first genomes are the
hardest to generate, as they require establishment of laboratory protocols and bioinformatic pipelines
that can provide accurate and timely information. Both at Johns Hopkins and elsewhere, this has
occurred in record time during the COVID-19 pandemic; and the methods and results presented here
will serve as the foundation of continued molecular surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 within the JHHS. This
ongoing work should allow us to answer critical questions not only about the evolution of the virus, but
on the fundamental mechanisms by which control measures affected its epidemic spread. These
efforts complement the information provided by the rapidly growing public databases of SARS-COV-2
sequences by focusing collection of genomic data in settings where we can access extensive current
and past clinical data to investigate fundamental questions about this evolving virus’s changing
relationship with human health.

Materials and Methods
Specimens and patient data
Clinical specimens used for genetic characterization were remnant nasopharyngeal swabs available at the
completion of standard of care testing at the Johns Hopkins Hospital clinical virology laboratory. In total,
143 samples were selected for analysis based on their distribution throughout March 2020 and
representation of the range of disease severity observed during this period. During this period, automated
patient metadata extraction was limited to the date a sample was confirmed positive; all other data required
patient chart reviews. Samples were sequenced in two phases, with the first phase enriched for patients
admitted to the ICU (14/55 samples collected March 11-21​st​), and the second a convenience sample that
captured as many samples as possible for sequencing, irrespective of disease severity or ICU admission
(10/88 samples collected March 13-31​st​). All research was conducted under Johns Hopkins IRB protocol
IRB00221396.
Clinical data analysis
Data including patient demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, COVID-19 exposure, recent travel history,
and results of chest imaging at presentation were abstracted from the electronic medical record (EMR).
COVID-19 treatment (medication, supplemental oxygen and invasive mechanical ventilation) and
outcomes (home observation without inpatient admission, discharge after admission, ongoing admission,
and death) were also abstracted from the EMR. Race as self-reported by the patient and documented in
the EMR was collected in pre-specified categories. Patients who reported i) contact with an individual
known to be COVID 19 infected or ii) high risk exposure (e.g., healthcare worker) were classified as
COVID-19 exposed. Comorbidities were assessed based on diagnoses in the EMR (i.e. Diabetes, Obesity
or Alcohol Use Disorder) and further categorized for lung disease (e.g. asthma, COPD), cardiac disease
(e.g. valvular heart disease, arrhythmias, hypertension) and immunocompromised (e.g., HIV positive,
hematologic malignancy, solid organ transplant).
Nucleic acid extraction
Automated nucleic acid extraction was performed using either the NucliSENS easyMag or eMAG
instruments (bioMérieux) using software version 2.1.0.1. Two mL of easyMag or eMAG lysis buffer was
added to 500µL of aliquoted viral transport media in a biosafety cabinet in either BSL-3 facility or BSL-2
using BSL-3 biosafety measures. Specimens were incubated for ten minutes in the lysis buffer prior to
automated nucleic acid extraction following the off-board lysis bioMérieux protocol, with an RNA elution
volume of 50uL.
Diagnostic RT-PCR
The Altona Diagnostics RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit 1.0 (Hamburg, Germany) was the primary
assay used for molecular diagnosis. A subset of SARS-CoV-2 positives were identified using the Cepheid
Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 GeneXpert platform per manufacturer instructions. All samples were processed
within 24 hours of collection.
The RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit 1.0 total reaction volume was 30µL (10µL extracted sample and
20µL Master Mix). The kit contains two premade master mixes, A and B, which contain PCR buffer,
magnesium salt, primers and probes, reverse transcriptase, and DNA polymerase. The detectors used are

Cy5 (SARS-CoV-2; S gene), FAM (B-βCoV; E gene) and JOE (Internal Control). C​T values for the S gene
target (Cy5) are reported in ​Table S2​. Taqman RT- PCR was performed using the Prism 7500 Sequence
Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) at the following cycling conditions: 1 cycle at
55.0°C for 20 minutes, 1 cycle at 95.0 °C for 2 minutes and 45 cycles at 95.0°C for 15 seconds, 55.0°C for
45 seconds then 72.0 °C for 15 seconds. Validation of this assay was performed as described in 22​
​ .
Testing on the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 GeneXpert platform was performed in accordance with
manufacturers instructions 34​
​ .
Genome sequencing with ARTIC tiled amplicons
Whole genome amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was performed using the ARTIC network
protocol with the V3 primer set 23​
​ . Briefly, cDNA was generated from previously extracted RNA remaining
after the initial diagnostic RT-PCR assay. Unlike the written protocol, no sample dilution was performed to
normalize samples by C​T value ranges, as this data was often incomplete at the time of sample
processing. A two-step reverse transcriptase PCR was performed using random hexamer cDNA synthesis
using SuperScript IV (Thermo Fisher, 18091), followed by multiplexed PCR in two non-overlapping pools
using Q5 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, M0491). For Oxford Nanopore sequencing, amplicon
pools were indexed using the Native Barcoding reagent set (Oxford Nanopore, EXP-NBD104). Indexed
sample sets of 11 were then pooled, and 20ng of the resulting library was used for sequencing on Oxford
Nanopore GridION instruments using R9.4.1 flowcells and high-accuracy basecalling (Guppy v3.5.2).
For Illumina sequencing, the New England Biolabs NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina
reagent set was used for library generation from the same starting amplicons as used for Oxford Nanopore
library preparation. Sequencing adapters were diluted 10 fold to optimize for our input range of 5-100ng of
DNA. Adapter-ligated DNA was cleaned up without size selection and underwent 8 cycles of PCR at the
amplification step. Samples were sequenced on a MiSeq using a 600bp v3 cartridge.
Genome assembly and variant validation
Reference-based genome assembly was performed using the ARTIC network bioinformatics pipeline
v1.0.0 for COVID-19 (​https://artic.network/ncov-2019​) with modifications. Briefly, basecalled reads were
demultiplexed with Guppy v3.5.2. Reads were mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 reference (GenBank accession
MN908947.3) with minimap2 v2.17 35
​ and coverage was normalized across the genome using a custom
normalization pipeline (​https://github.com/mkirsche/CoverageNormalization​) with coverage_threshold 150
and parameters --even_strand and --qual_sort. Primer binding regions were masked and variant calling
was performed with Nanopolish v0.13.2 with a minimum candidate allele frequency of 0.15 36​
​ . Consensus
37
genomes were generated with bcftools v1.9 ​ by mapping called variants to the reference genome, and all
sites with less than 20x coverage were masked as ‘N’.
A custom pipeline was used to validate called variants (​https://github.com/timplab/jhu-covid-pipeline​). This
pipeline made use of the negative control (NTC) on each sequencing run. Amplicon regions with one or
more positions with read depth less than two times the 95% quantile of average amplicon depth in the NTC
(minimum threshold = 20) were masked as ‘N’, and any variants also present in the NTC were masked
unless the coverage at that variant position was more than five times the NTC coverage at that position.
Additionally, any sequencing runs with high coverage in the NTC (>50x depth threshold) were ignored and
all samples rerun.

Variants in samples or regions without evidence of contamination were validated by two other variant
callers: medaka v0.11.5 (implemented by re-running the ARTIC bioinformatics pipeline) and a naïve
samtools 37
​ variant caller, both with a minimum candidate allele frequency of 0.15. All positions with variant
caller disagreements or high minor allele frequencies (mixed variants; variant allele frequency 25-75%)
were manually inspected in Integrated Genome Viewer 38​
​ . Mixed variants found only on one sequencing
strand were ignored (called as reference base), and mixed variants due to deletions in clear homopolymer
regions were called as the alternate allele in the consensus genome. For the purposes of creating a
consensus genome, candidate variants at <25% allele frequency were called as the reference base, and
variants >75% frequency were called as the alternate allele.
When available, Illumina data was used to confirm or invalidate variants with disagreements. The same
normalization process was applied to Illumina reads, and variant calling was performed with FreeBayes
v0.9.21 39​
​ , iVar v1.0 40​
​ , and samtools. Mixed variants that could not be confirmed with Illumina data or
(in)validated due to strand bias or homopolymer deletions were replaced with ambiguity codes. Final
variants were annotated with SnpEff 41​
​ .
Genomes were considered complete if they had at least 27,000 non-N nucleotide calls (specific IUPAC
ambiguity codes such as Y or R contributed to reaching the 27,000 threshold). We also required that the
sequence had fewer than 5 mixed variants, as the cause of highly mixed samples (perhaps due to
contamination, co-infection, or within-host variation) requires further research.
Genomic analyses were performed on the SciScerver science platform ​42​. Complete assemblies and all
raw sequencing data were submitted to NCBI under bioproject ​PRJNA650037 (accessions available in
Table S3​)​.
Selecting a genomic background dataset
For phylogenetic analyses, full length viral genome sequences with collection dates before April 1, 2020
were downloaded from Genbank 43
​ and GISAID 18
​ on June 3, 2020. Multiple sequence alignment was
44
performed using MAFFT v7.458 ​ using parameters --reorder --anysymbol --nomemsave --adjustdirection.
Sequences with fewer than 75% unambiguous bases were excluded, as were duplicate sequences defined
as having identical nucleotide composition and having been collected on the same date and in the same
country. The resulting dataset was trimmed at the 5’ and 3’ ends resulting in a multi-sequence alignment
with 29805 nucleotides. This dataset was subjected to multiple iterations of phylogeny reconstruction using
IQ-TREE multicore software version v1.6.12 45
​ with parameters -m GTR+G -nt 50, and exclusion of outlier
sequences whose genetic divergence and sampling date were incongruent using TempEst 46​
​ , resulting in a
dataset with 19,565 sequences.
For computational efficiency, we downsampled this dataset homogeneously through time and space, by
randomly selecting 7 and 34 sequences per month, to obtain global datasets with 1168 (hereafter referred
to as Global 1K) and 3113 (hereafter referred to as Global 3K) sequences from around the world,
respectively. We preferentially selected longer sequences with the fewest number of gaps in the 5’ and 3’
ends and those that had complete dates and the fewest number of ambiguous bases. We used the
high-performance computational capabilities of the Biowulf Linux cluster at the National Institutes of Health
(Bethesda, MD, USA) (​http://biowulf.nih.gov​) to perform these downsampling analyses. After
downsampling, we removed any sequences with fewer than <27,000 unambiguous bases and any
remaining sequences deemed GenBank/GISAID duplicates.

In order to study regional epidemics within the United States, sequences from Washington (WA), California
(CA), Idaho (ID), Louisiana (LA) and New York (NY) were excluded from the Global 1K and 3K datasets.
Data from the National Capital region (Maryland, DC, Virginia) were also removed from these global
datasets, resulting in final global datasets of 886 (Global 1K) and 2593 (Global 3K) sequences (​Table S5,
Table S6​).
Comparison of evolutionary divergence
We estimated the evolutionary divergence of several sequence datasets from each of the locations
selected for regional analysis. Each regional dataset consisted of sequences removed from the Global 3K
data. For Maryland and DC, we supplemented these to include all 114 JHHS sequences. We then
subsetted these sequences based on whether they were generated as part of this study (JHHS-MD and
JHHS-DC) or from other laboratories (MD other, DC other). For Virginia, we supplemented the removed
sequences to include all Virginia sequences in the pre-downsampled global dataset. The final regional
datasets were as follows: JHHS-DC (n = 31); DC other (n = 6); DC = JHHS-DC + DC other (n = 37);
JHHS-MD (n = 83); MD other (n = 8); MD = JHHS-MD + MD other (n = 91); VA (n = 50); LA (n = 34); ID (n
= 32); NY (n = 35); CA (n = 53); WA (n = 61) (​Table S6​).
To estimate evolutionary divergence, we calculated the pairwise divergence (in base substitutions per site)
between all pairs of sequences within and between each geographical group. We conducted the analyses
through the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis software version 10 (MEGA X) 47,48
​
and applied the
maximum composite likelihood mode ​49​. The rate variation among sites was modeled with a gamma
distribution (shape parameter = 4), and the differences in the composition bias among sequences were
considered in evolutionary comparisons 50​
​ . We included 1st+2nd+3rd+non-coding codon positions, and all
with less than 50% site coverage, due to alignment gaps, missing data, and ambiguous bases, were
eliminated (partial deletion option).
We included the Global 1K and 3K datasets in this analysis to determine the appropriate global reference
dataset (out of over 60,000 global SARS-CoV-2 sequences published at the time of analysis) for our
phylogenetic analyses. Despite the significant difference in number of sequences, the Global 1K and 3K
datasets we tested have comparable mean pairwise genetic distances, indicating that the smaller 1K
dataset is representative of global diversity and is an appropriate selection of sequences to use as the
background for our phylogenetic inference (​Fig S5​, ​Table S5​, ​Table S6​).
Phylogenetic analysis
We used a customized Nextstrain snakemake pipeline 12
​ using augur v9.0.0 on the final dataset, which
included the 886 Global 1K dataset plus all removed regional groups (including all 114 JHHS sequences
and all published Virginia sequences), resulting in 1279 sequences used in our phylogenetic analysis. We
computed the phylogeny with IQ-TREE v1.6.12 45,51
​
with parameters -me 0.05 -nt 4 -m GTR -n 4. Trees
were rooted on the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome in FigTree 52
​ and visualized using ggtree 53
​ in R ​54​.
Finally, clades were assigned to sequences using Nextstrain 15​
​ and Pangolin 14​
​ , see ​Table S3.

Supplemental Figures and Tables

Supplemental Figure 1. Positive diagnoses by first three digits of zip code. Outlined regions correspond to
areas sharing the first three digits of their zip code (Washington DC outlined in black, all others grey). Each
region is shaded by the number of patients with positive COVID-19 diagnoses in March 2020 (from the Johns
Hopkins Health System) reporting home residence in that region. Regions with 1–5 positive diagnoses are
shown as 5.

Supplemental Figure 2. Single nucleotide polymorphisms present in three or more JHHS sequences.
Rows = samples sequenced as part of this study (114), sorted by Nextstrain clade. Columns = positions with
consensus variants in three or more sequences. Black cells = variant present; grey cells = ambiguity present.
Columns are clustered using complete linkage hierarchical clustering. JHHS subclades are additional subclades
of Nextstrain clades in which two or more variants are shared between three or more JHHS sequences. Some
JHHS-specific clades are captured by Pangolin nomenclature, some are not.

Supplemental Figure 3. Illumina and Oxford Nanopore allele frequency comparison. (​A​) Variant
frequencies from tiled amplicons sequenced on the Oxford Nanopore (ONT) and Illumina platforms. All variants
at >0.02 allele frequency are shown. Uncalled variants are those not present in the consensus sequences from
these samples. Grey shaded regions represent frequency threshold (25%) used to automatically reject
candidate variants. Almost all discrepancies in frequency occur within homopolymer regions (red symbols). (​B​)
Difference between allele frequencies across the two sequencing platforms. Position 3,037 (within a
T-homopolymer) accounts for most large discrepancies in frequency.

Supplemental Figure 4. Common Oxford Nanopore sequencing issues. ​(​A​) Example of a T-homopolymer
region in the SARS-CoV-2 genome (sample MDHP-00028). A large number of reads have deletions, resulting in
a mixed alternate allele frequency. (​B​) Example of strand bias in Oxford Nanopore sequencing reads (sample
MDHP-00028). A mutation only occurs in minus strand reads.
