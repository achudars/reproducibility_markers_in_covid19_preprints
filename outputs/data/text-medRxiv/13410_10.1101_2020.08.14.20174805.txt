Abstract

18

Objective: Early identification of the basic reproduction number (BRN) is imperative to political decision

19

making during an epidemic. In this study, we estimated the BRN 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after societal

20

lockdown of Denmark during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic.

21

Method: We implemented the SEIR dynamical system for disease spread without vital dynamics. The BRN

22

was modulated using a sigmoid function. Model parameters were estimated on number of admitted

23

patients, number of patients in intensive care and cumulative number of deaths using the simulated

24

annealing Monte Carlo algorithm. Results are presented with 95% prediction intervals (PI).

25

Results: We were unable to determine any reliable estimate of the BRN at 7 days following lockdown. The

26

BRN had stabilised at day 14 throughout day 28, with the estimate ranging from 0.95 (95% PI: 0.92-0.98) at

27

day 7 to 0.92 (95% PI: 0.92-0.93) at day 28. We estimated the BRN prior to lockdown to be 3.32 (95% PI:

28

3.31-3.33). The effect of the lockdown was occurring over a period of a few days centred at March 18th

29

(95% PI: 17th-18th) 2020.

30

Conclusion: We believe our model provides a valuable tool for decision makers to reliably estimate the

31

effect of a politically determined lockdown during an epidemic.

Introduction

39

The SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread rapidly and have already had a dramatic impact on health care systems

40

and societies globally[1,2]. Moreover, the disease, which is often referred to as the corona virus disease

41

2019 (COVID-19), has so far caused more than 250.000 deaths worldwide and has had major socio-

42

economic implications in the affected countries[3]. In Denmark the disease has caused more than 500

43

deaths at the time of drafting, with the first case confirmed on February 27th 2020[4].

44

Efforts to reduce or avoid strain on the health care system seen in other countries have been imposed by

45

the Danish government[5]. These efforts have included: home isolation of confirmed cases, closing of

46

schools, non-essential businesses and public workplaces, closing of country borders and restriction of

47

gatherings to no more than 10 individuals. Although case isolation was imposed initially, most of these

48

actions were not presented to the Danish population before March 12th 2020 and invoked in the

49

subsequent days, with the final regulations taking effect on March 18th.

50

So far not much is known about the disease and many of the reported characteristics are based on

51

simplified models[1,6â€“10], while other studies focuses mainly on viral load[11] and cell biology including

52

pathogenesis[12,13]. The amount of disease spread during an epidemic is measured by the basic

53

reproduction number (BRN), however, this number depends on human behaviour and may therefore be

54

different in various cultures and it may change as policy makers impose restrictions on social

55

gatherings[14]. The BRN have previously been estimated in studies on a Chinese population[7,15],

56

nevertheless, only one study appears to have investigated the dynamics of the BRN[15]. To our knowledge,

57

no one has yet investigated how early an effect of a political intervention on the BRN can be detected.

58

Hence, the aim of the current study was to determine the time from a political strategy have been enforced

59

until the effect can be accurately estimated. In addition, we aimed to estimate characteristics of the COVID-

60

19 epidemic, such as fraction of infected individuals that are symptomatic and the average infection period.

61

Method

62

Model

63

We implemented the so-called SEIR[16,17] model without vital dynamics. This dynamical system simulates

64

number of susceptible S, exposed E, infectious I and recovered persons R, and is based on the SIR model by

65

Kermack and McKendrick[18,19], but with an additional equation for modelling the incubation period until

66

cases becomes infectious. In this time period, cases are referred to as exposed, hence, the additional E in

67

SEIR. From number of susceptible, infectious and recovered persons, we calculated daily numbers of

68

hospitalised patients, number of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and cumulative number

69

of deaths following viral infection of SARS-CoV-2. These counts were calculated on national level using the

70

parameterisation described below. Model parameters were estimated from individual level patient data

71

when possible, while a few parameters, such as incubation time, were obtained from current literature. We

72

inferred the remaining parameters from number of hospitalised patients, number of patients admitted to

73

an ICU and cumulative number of deaths using a Monte Carlo algorithm.

74

Data sources

75

The Danish National Health Authority provided data on actual numbers of in-patients, ICU patients and

76

cumulative number of deaths in Denmark from March 16th 2020 to April 13th 2020, both dates included. In

77

Denmark, COVID-19 mortality is reported as infection fatality[4]. Information on age distribution of the

78

Danish population as of January 2020 was obtained from Statistics Denmark, while the North Denmark and

79

Central Denmark regions (1.92 million individuals corresponding to 32.9% of the total Danish population)

80

provided individual level data on their resident patients hospitalised and tested positive with COVID-19.

84

the time of intervention. The model assumes that the BRN decreases over time, otherwise,  is the BRN

85

prior to intervention and    is the BRN after intervention.

86

Parameters obtained from individual patient data

87

Individual level patient data contained information on time of hospital admission, ICU admission, hospital

88

discharge, ICU discharge and death. From these data, we estimated average length of hospital stay and ICU

89

care as well as average time from hospital admission to ICU admission and hospital admission to death.

90

Parameters obtained from current literature

91

We assumed the incubation time to be 5.2 days[20], however, the incubation time is usually defined as

92

time from exposure to symptom onset, while our model relies on the time from exposure to becoming

93

infectious, which is assumed to occur 12 hours prior to symptom onset[2]. Hence, we defined the exposure

94

timeframe to 4.7 days.

95

The age-stratified proportions of symptomatic cases in need of hospitalisation and intensive care, and age-

96

stratified infection fatality ratios were obtained from the report by Ferguson et al[2].

97

Parameters obtained by Monte Carlo sampling

98

We estimated the proportion of cases who are symptomatic, the average time from start of infectious

99

period to hospitalisation, the date of origin of the epidemic, the number of persons initially exposed and

100

the parameters of the BRN function describe above. The date of origin is defined as the date at which the

101

initial person or persons became exposed in Denmark.

102

The mean generation time, which by definition is equal to the mean infectious period[20], were likewise

103

inferred using the Monte Carlo approach. Finally, we added a parameter describing the ratio of

104

symptomatic cases in need of intensive care compared to those estimated on an external population[2].

105

Statistical analysis

106

Initially, we calculated parameters based on individual level patient data. We estimated average length of

107

hospital stay and ICU care as area under the curve using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, while average time

108

from hospital admission to ICU admission and hospital admission to death was estimated, conditioned on

109

patients admitted to the ICU as well as patients who eventually died, respectively. All four parameters were

110

presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

111

Thereafter, we conducted four separate Monte Carlo searches using simulated annealing (SA) with the

112

initial 7, 14, 21 and 28 days of the available data. From here on we will refer to these searches as models 1

113

through 4, respectively. We assumed normally distributed number of in-patient beds, ICU beds and

114

cumulative number of death, with a standard deviation of one. The SA factor was varied from an initial

115

value of 200 to a final value of 40. The search was split on 32 threads using a 16-core Xeon(R) CPU E5-2630

116

v3 @ 2.40GHz hyperthreaded machine. The model parameters with the maximum log-likelihood were

117

chosen as the final model.

118

Finally, we implemented a second Monte Carlo search for each of the four models using the Metropolis

119

Hastings algorithm. The purpose of this search was to estimate prediction intervals (PI), thus, the algorithm

120

was initiated using the parameters of the best fit, of each of the four models from the prior search. Again,

121

we employed normally distributed number of in-patient beds, ICU beds and cumulative number of deaths,

122

but with a Poisson-like standard deviation. Relevant model parameters as well as projected number of in-

123

patient beds, ICU beds and cumulative number of deaths are presented with 95% PI.

124

Initial statistical analysis were conducted using Stata 14 (StataCorp. 2015. Stata Statistical Software: Release

125

14. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP), while we employed Python version 2.7 (Python Software Foundation.

126

Python Language Reference, version 2.7. Available at www.python.org) for the Monte Carlo searches and

127

subsequent analysis.

Results

134

From the individual level patient data we identified 356 patients admitted and tested positive for COVID-19

135

in the Central Denmark and North Denmark Region with a mean admission time of 10.87 days (95% CI:

136

9.23-12.51). Of these patients, 80 subjects were admitted to an ICU with a mean length of hospital stay at

137

the ICU of 11.27 days (95% CI: 9.48-13.06), while the mean time from hospital admission to ICU admission

138

was 2.93 days (95% CI: 2.28-3.57). During the observation period, we observed 43 deaths in the Central

139

Denmark and North Denmark Regions, from which we estimated the mean time from hospital admission to

140

death to be 9.02 days (95% CI: 6.76-11.29).

141

Relevant model parameters are presented in Table 1. All four models found almost the same BRN prior to

142

intervention with the fourth model, which included 28days of observation, estimating the BRN at 3.32 (95%

143

PI: 3.31-3.33). Likewise, models 2 to 4 estimated almost the same BRN after intervention as well as time of

144

intervention, with the fourth model estimating these parameters as 0.92 (95% PI: 0.92-0.93) and March 18th

145

(95% PI: March 17th-March 18th), respectively. The first model did not converge and was unable to estimate

146

these two parameters, as the time of intervention could be any time after March 17th.

Discussion

177

To our knowledge this is the first study to infer characteristics of the COVID-19 epidemic based on number

178

of in-patient beds needed, ICU beds needed and cumulative number of deaths, rather than the number of

179

infected persons. In Denmark, health care service is free and available for all residents, and all hospitals are

180

committed to report these numbers to the national health authority. Hence, we consider our outcome

181

measures to be highly reliable, in contrast to number of infected, which is highly dependent on test

182

strategy and consequently also sensitive to changes in test strategy during the epidemic.

183

Visual inspection of Fig 2 and 3 shows a good fit of the data, though, the number of ICU beds needed seems

184

to be somewhat shifted in time. However, the model assumes that the average time from start of infectious

185

period to hospitalisation is independent of disease severity. An explanation of this bias may simply be that

186

subjects in need of intensive care are hospitalised earlier compared to hospitalised patients in general. This

187

discrepancy may also explain the decrease in proportion of symptomatic cases and ratio of ICU cases

188

compared to external population as more data becomes available.

189

Our findings suggest that the severity of the epidemic may be higher compared to other studies, as we

190

estimate the BRN to be above 3.3 even after inducing case isolation. A similar study by Kucharski et al[15]

191

estimated the dynamics of the BRN in Wuhan using sequential Monte Carlo simulation[21] and found a BRN

192

of 2.6 at its highest and just below 1.0 at its lowest. However, this model was fitted on number of

193

confirmed cases, which was reflected in the high inaccuracy of the model.

194

From the individual level patient data we were able to estimate clinical characteristics based on data from

195

two regions of Denmark. Together with the Monte Carlo estimated parameters we found that the mean

196

time from start of infectious period to hospitalisation was 4.9 days, and with a mean time from

197

hospitalisation to death of 9.0 days, we arrive at infectious onset to death of 13.9 days. Similar to our study,

10

198

a study by Verity et al[1] estimated the time to death conditioned on whether death occurred, but on a

199

population of Hubei, mainland China. They found the mean time from symptom onset to death to be 18.8

200

days. Although these figures are not fully comparable, the difference is important. The Verity study,

201

however, was based on only 24 deaths. Another study found that the mean time from illness onset to

202

death was 15.0 days and from hospital admission to death was 8.8 days[6].

203

A study by To et al found the infectious time to be 7.5 days (95% CI: 5.3 to 19)[7] with a CI well containing

204

the infectious time estimate of our study, which was 6.24 (95% PI: 6.15-6.33). The same study found the

205

mean duration of symptom onset to hospitalisation to be 9.1 and 12.5 days in two time stratified

206

populations. In contrast, our study suggest this number to be less than 4.87 days. The difference may be

207

explained by cultural differences between Denmark and China, however, another study in China estimated

208

the median time from symptom onset to hospitalization to be 1.2 days (range: 0.2 to 29.9 days)[9], while a

209

study from Singapore found this number to be 4 days[8]. Finally, Guan et al found the mean duration of

210

hospitalisation to be 12.8 days[10], which is similar to the 10.9 days in our study. There is still a high

211

disagreement between the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in different studies. Nevertheless, we

212

believe our findings to be generalizable to external populations, because our study is conducted using

213

reliable data in a country where health care service is free and available for all residents.

214

The model suggest that the change from initial BRN to the reduced BRN is centred around March 18th 2020,

215

and from Fig 1 it seems the change occurred over a period of four days or less. The timing of the change

216

occurred as final government orders were at effect only six days after the societal lockdown strategy was

217

initially presented. Social distancing was encourage early on, however, fines were not imposed until March

218

18th. Nevertheless, from the current study is not possible to distinguish which of the political actions were

219

most effective, as all actions were implemented within a short time.

220

Model limitations

221

A few of the model parameters is obtained from the literature, which may have some impact on estimated

222

model parameters, considering these may not be fully generalizable to a Danish population. In addition, the

223

model assumes that the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation is the same for severe cases as for in-

224

patients in general. This lack of differential initial symptom load may explain the decreasing fraction of

225

symptomatic cases and ratio of ICU cases compared to the external population, as the model may be

226

unable to accurately predict the number of ICU beds needed. Nevertheless, the model also assumes

227

constant proportion of symptomatic cases over time, however, as the epidemic progresses, high risk

228

subjects may be more likely to be isolated by their own choice or as part of a political strategy. Therefore,

229

the proportion of symptomatic cases may be better fitted using the same dynamical model as for the BRN.

230

Moreover, our current model is subject to bias from changes in treatment availability, such as increased

231

use of remdesivir, though current treatment opportunities have limited effect[12,22].

232

Perspective

233

The current global challenge of reopening society with fewest fatal consequences and at the same time

234

reducing economical costs warrants valid and precise prediction models. We believe that the current study

235

provides a valuable tool for early measurement of the effect of a political intervention. As time progresses

236

and the political strategy is adjusted, one can simply add additional sigmoid function, without having to

237

refit the parameters of the prior BRN functions. However, the results of the current study suggests that

238

each adjustment of any political strategy aimed at constraining the COVID-19 epidemic should be invoked

239

with at least fourteen days intervals.

240

Conclusion

241

In this study we estimated characteristics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Denmark based on the number of in-

242

patient beds needed, the number of ICU beds needed and the cumulative number of deaths. We found the

model parameters to be stable as more data were accrued over time. Moreover, we found that the time of

244

change from initial BRN to the reduced BRN to be in good accordance with actual timing of the political

245

actions. We believe the model constitutes a useful tool for early assessment of the effect following political

246

interference. The model can easily be implemented in other settings.
