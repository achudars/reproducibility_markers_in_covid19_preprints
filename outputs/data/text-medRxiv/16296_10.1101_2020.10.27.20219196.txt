Abstract
Background
Sensitive and high throughput molecular detection assays are essential during the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The vast majority of the SARS-CoV-2 molecular
assays use nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) or oropharyngeal swab (OPS) specimens
collected from suspected individuals. However, using NPS or OPS as specimens has
apparent drawbacks, e.g. the collection procedures for NPS or OPS specimens can be
uncomfortable to some people and may cause sneezing and coughing which in turn
generate droplets and/or aerosol particles that are of risk to healthcare workers, requiring
heavy use of personal protective equipment. There have been recent studies indicating
that self-collected saliva specimens can be used for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2
and provides more comfort and ease of use for the patient. Here we report the
performance of QuantiVirus™ SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test using saliva as the testing
specimens with or without pooling.

Methods
Development and validation studies were conducted following FDA-EUA and molecular
assay validation guidelines. Using SeraCare Accuplex SARS-CoV-2 reference panel, the
limit of detection (LOD) and clinical evaluation studies were performed with the
QuantiVirus™ SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test. For clinical evaluation, 85 known positive and
90 known negative clinical NPS samples were tested. Additionally, twenty paired NPS
and saliva samples collected from recovering COVID-19 patients were tested and the
results were further compared to that of the Abbott m2000 SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay.
Results of community collected 389 saliva samples for COVID-19 screening by
QuantiVirus™ SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test were also obtained and analyzed. Moreover,
saliva pooling with 6 and 12 samples together were also evaluated.

Results
The LOD for the QuantiVirus™ SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test was confirmed to be 100-200
copies/mL. The clinical evaluation using contrived saliva samples indicated that the
positive percentage agreement (PPA) of the QuantiVirus™ SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test is

100% at 1xLOD, 1.5xLOD and 2.5xLOD. No cross-reactivity was observed for the
QuantiVirus™ SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test with common respiratory pathogens. Testing
of clinical samples showed a positive percentage agreement (PPA) of 100% (95% CI:
94.6% to 100%) and a negative percentage agreement (NPA) of 98.9% (95% CI: 93.1%
to 99.9%). QuantiVirus TM SARS CoV-2 multiplex test had 80% concordance rate and no
significant difference (p=0.13) in paired saliva and NPS specimens by Wilcoxon matched
pairs signed rank test. Positive test rate was 1.79% for 389 saliva specimens collected
from the communities for COVID-19 screening. Preliminary data showed that saliva
sample pooling up to 6 samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection is feasible (sensitivity 94.8%
and specificity 100%).

Conclusion
The studies demonstrated that the QuantiVirus™ SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test has a LOD
of 200 copies/mL in contrived saliva samples. The clinical performance of saliva-based
testing is comparable to that of NPS-based testing. Pooling of saliva specimens for
SARS-CoV-2 detection is feasible. Saliva based and high-throughput QuantiVirusTM
SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test offers a highly desirable test during the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic.

Introduction
A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2,
previously provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV), has been
identified as the cause of respiratory infection including severe pneumonia outbreak that
started in Wuhan, China in late 20191-2, and has since become a global pandemic. The
disease was named the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health
Organization in February 2020. It has been determined that SARS-CoV-2 can be
transmitted from person-to-person (symptomatic or asymptomatic) and is more
transmissible than SARS-CoV 3-5.
Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and oropharyngeal swab (OPS) samples are widely
accepted as specimens for the detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 since the start of the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the collection procedures for NPS and OPS specimens may cause
discomfort and, in some people, sneezing and coughing. The latter in turn can generate
droplets or aerosol particles that place healthcare workers collecting these specimens at
risk,6 requiring heavy use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Poor tolerability of
NPS and OPS sampling can result in false-negative tests due to inadequate or poor
quality of specimen collection7-10. Recent investigations by Wyllie et al11 and Hanson et
al12 suggested that saliva is a viable and even more sensitive alternative to NPS
specimens, and could also enable at-home self-administered sample collection for largescale SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing. Other researchers also reported that SARS-CoV-2
was detected in 91.7% (n=11) of the initial saliva specimens from confirmed COVID-19
patients. All saliva specimens (n=33) collected from patients whose NPS specimens
tested negative for COVID-19 also tested negative13. It is apparent that detection of SARS
CoV-2 in saliva can be used as an alternative, more appealing and cost-effective

procedure for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Indeed, a molecular test using saliva samples
was first approved for FDA under EUA on May 8, 2020.14
The use of saliva specimens might decrease the risk of nosocomial transmission of
COVID-19 and is ideal for situations in which NPS or OPS specimen collection may be
impractical.15-18 Collecting saliva is easy and more tolerable to patients, can reduce risk
of cross-infection, and can be used in settings where PPE is not readily available. It will
also be useful for testing infants and young children in daycare facilities and schools.
The QuantiVirus™ SARS-CoV-2 Multiplex Test is a real-time reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test that includes the assay controls for the
qualitative detection of viral RNA from SARS-CoV-2 in NPS, OPS, saliva or sputum
specimens collected from patients who are suspected of COVID-19 infection. Extracted
RNA is reverse-transcribed and amplified in a single reaction. In this multiplex qPCR
method, the Orf1ab, N, and E genes of the SARS-CoV-2 genome are targeted in the RTPCR assay (Figure 1A). Primers and TaqMan probes designed for conserved regions of
the SARS-CoV-2 virus genome allow specific amplification and detection of the viral RNA
from all strains of SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory specimens. The Human RNase P gene
is used as an Internal Control (IC) to monitor viral RNA extraction efficiency and assess
amplifiable RNA in the samples to be tested. The test is a multiplex RT-PCR assay
consisting of one reaction with primers and probes for the viral gene targets (Orf1ab, N
and E genes) and IC in one tube, designed to increase assay throughput.
We demonstrate here that saliva sampling is an adequate alternative to NPS and OPS
sampling and can be used for COVID-19 testing using the QuantiVirus SARS-CoV-2
multiplex test.

Methods
Study design and ethics
Besides contrived saliva samples, deidentified leftover patient NPS and saliva samples
were used in the study. All patient specimens were collected in June-September 2020
and previously tested at UCSF affiliated San Francisco VAMC clinical laboratories and
DiaCarta clinical laboratory for clinical diagnostic or screening purpose. Other than
qualitative RT-PCR results (positive or negative), only PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values
were included in study analysis and no patient clinical chart reviews were performed.
This study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) at UCSF (UCSF IRB
#11-05207) as a no-subject contact study with waiver of consent and as exempt under
category 4.

Clinical specimens
Clinical samples were collected from patients who had previously been tested positive
for SARS-CoV-2. Paired NPS and saliva samples were collected at the same time. The
QuantiVirusTM Saliva Collection Kit (DiaCarta, Inc. cat# DC-11-0021) was used for
saliva collection, following the kit insert instructions and under the supervision of
healthcare providers. Each saliva sample contains 2 mL liquid saliva and 2 mL viral
transport media. The NPS and saliva samples are refrigerated and processed for testing
within 24 hours after collection.

Sample pooling

Patient saliva and healthy saliva samples were pooled together according to the
experiment design for 1:5 (i.e., 1 positive mixed with 5 negatives) and 1:11 (i.e., 1
positive mixed with 11 negatives) pooling. After mixing the samples, the viral RNA was
extracted according to the following protocol.

Viral RNA extraction
MGI’s automatic RNA/DNA extraction instrument MGISP-960 or Thermo PureLink™
Viral RNA/DNA Mini Kit (Cat. 12280050) was used for the SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA
extraction according to the manufacturer’s instructions, for which 200 µL of each NPS or
saliva sample was used. For each batch of clinical samples to be tested, an extraction
control (EC) was included (spike 20 µL of EC from the QuantiVirus™ SARS-CoV-2
multiplex kit into 180 µL sterile RNase-free water). The clinical samples and spiked EC
were processed and extracted on the MGI platform. The extraction output is RNA in 3050 µL RNase-free water, 5.5 µL of which is used for the PCR reaction per test. The
turnaround time from sample extraction to PCR final report is around 4 hrs (Figure 1B).
Precautions were taken while handling extracted RNA samples to avoid RNA
degradation. Extracted RNA samples were stored at -80°C if not immediately used for
RT-PCR.

Multiplex primer and probe design
Target gene sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the N gene, E gene and ORF1ab
gene were identified and selected for test development. The gene sequences were
retrieved from GenBank and GISAID databases for primer and probe designs to ensure

coverage of all SARS-CoV-2 strains. Multiple alignments of the collected sequences
were performed using CLC Main Workbench 20.0.4., and conserved regions in each
target gene were identified using BioEditor 7.2.5. prior to primer and probe designs.
Primers and probes were designed to target the most conserved regions of each of the
target genes of the viral genome, using Primer3plus software and following general
rules of real-time PCR design. All primers were designed with a melting temperature
(Tm) of approximately 60°C and the probes were designed with a Tm of about 65°C.
The amplicon sizes were kept as short as possible within the range of 70 bp to 150 bp
for each primer pair to achieve better amplification efficiency and detection sensitivity.
All primers and probes were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT,
Coralville, IA, USA) and LGC Biosearch Technologies (Novato, CA, USA), respectively.

Real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rRT-PCR)
The total volume of one RT-PCR reaction for all targets is 10 µL, including 5.5 μL of RNA,
2.0 μL of 5x primer and probe mixture (final concentration of 0.2 µM and 0.1 µM,
respectively), and 2.5 μL of 4x TaqPath™ 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix (Catalog number
A28526, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) or 4x Inhibitor-Tolerant RT-qPCR mix (MDX01650, Meridian Bioscience, Tennessee). Thermal cycling was performed at 25°C for 2 min
for UNG incubation and 53°C for 10 min for reverse transcription, followed by 95°C for 2
min and then 45 cycles of 95°C for 3 sec, and 60°C for 30 sec. QuantStudio™ 5 RealTime PCR System (Thermo Fisher, USA), Applied Biosystems™ 7500 Fast Dx Real-Time
PCR Instrument (Thermo Fisher, USA), BioRad CFX384 (Bio-Rad, USA) and Roche
LightCycler 480 II (Roche, USA) were used for rRT-PCR amplification and detection.

Microorganism Panel for cross-reactivity
MERS- coronavirus, SARS-CoV coronavirus samples were ordered from IDT. NATtrol
Respiratory Validation Panel was ordered from ZeptoMetrix (cat# NATRVP-3,
Buffalo, NY). RNA/DNA were extracted from high titer stocks of the potentially crossreacting microorganisms.

Statistical data analysis
Average cycle threshold (Ct), standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV)
were calculated using Microsoft Office Excel 365 software (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).
Clinical sensitivity, clinical specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative
Predictive value (NPV) at two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) were analyzed using
MedCalc software Version 19.3.1. ROC curve was plotted by R package pROC. NP and
saliva pair analysis was conducted by Wilcoxon signed rank test.

Results
Validation of QuantiVirus TM SARS-CoV-2 Multiplex Test kit
Analytical sensitivity
We validated the QuantiVirusTM SARS-CoV-2 Multiplex kit on four qPCR
instruments from different vendors, using contrived saliva samples. The overall
analytical sensitivity (lower limit of detection or LOD) is around 100-200
copies/mL.
The validation data established that the LOD of the assay is 200 copies/mL on
ABI 7500 Fast Dx (Table 1a), 100 copies/mL on Bio-Rad CFX384 (Table 1b), 200

copies/mL on Roche LightCycler 480 II (Table 1c), and 200 copies/mL on the
Thermo Fisher QuantStudio 5 (Table 1d).

Cross-reactivity (assay specificity)
We tested the cross-reactivity as part of the assay development. MERS-coronavirus
and SARS-CoV coronavirus samples were ordered from IDT and NATtrol Respiratory
Verification Panel from ZeptoMetrix (cat#NATRVP-3). RNA/DNA were extracted from
high titer stocks of the potentially cross-reacting microorganisms (estimated 1.0E+05
units/mL), RNA/DNA were extracted from 100 µL microorganisms’ stocks using the
Thermo Fisher viral RNA extraction kit (PureLink™ Viral RNA/DNA Mini Kit) or Qiagen
QIAamp DNA Mini Kit. Extracted RNA/DNA were eluted to 100 μL with sterile RNasefree water. 5.5 μL of the purified RNA/DNA samples was used for each reaction and
tested using the QuantiVirus TM SARS-CoV-2 multiplex Test Kit. The cross-reactivity
testing results are summarized in Table 2.
The cross-reactivity tests were run in triplicate, and all test controls passed (Positive
controls Ct<25, No target control Ct >45, Extraction control has RP Ct ~28). The tested
organisms were all negative for the targeted N, E and ORF1ab genes of SARS-CoV-2,
indicating there is no cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 primers & probes and any
of the comparison organisms tested. The cross reactivity with common Human
coronaviruses and MERS-coronavirus was also tested, and there was no cross
reactivity at 105 PFU/mL.

We spiked non-infectious viral particles (SeraCare AccuPlex SARS-CoV-2 Reference
Material Kit, Cat # 0505-0126) into healthy donor saliva which were confirmed by SARSCoV-2 qPCR test to be negative, and tested each using three different qPCR instruments,
ABI QuantStudio 5, ABI 7500 Fast Dx and BioRad CFX 384.
Clinical evaluation of the QuantiVirus™ SARS-CoV-2 Multiplex Test was conducted
with saliva specimens including 40 contrived positive and 30 negative samples. Saliva
samples collected from healthy donors were mixed with the lysis buffer at 1:1 ratio before
spiking in non-infectious viral particles (SeraCare AccuPlex SARS-CoV-2 Reference
Material Kit) (Table 3).
20 contrived positive saliva samples were created with the addition of non-infectious
viral particles templates at 1x estimated LOD (1x200 copies/mL), 10 saliva samples were
spiked at 1.5xLoD (300 copies/mL), and another 10 saliva samples were spiked at
2.5xLoD (500 copies/mL). Viral RNA was extracted from spiked samples and tested with
the QuantiVirus™ SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test kit. The results showed that all 40 spiked
saliva samples tested positive and all 30 control saliva samples tested negative on all
three PCR instruments (Tables 3a, b and c) with PPA being 100% (95% CI: 0.76-0.99)
and NPA of 100% (95% CI: 0.91-1.00).

Clinical evaluation on NPS samples
Using the QuantiVirus™ SARS-CoV-2 Multiplex Test, we tested clinical NPS samples
including 85 positive samples and 90 negative samples which previously had been
tested on Abbott m2000 molecular system using Abbott Real-Time SARS-CoV-2 testing
kits (Table 4). The data shows that the clinical sensitivity of QuantiVirus™ SARS-CoV-2

multiplex test is 98.8% (95% CI: 92.7% -99.9%) and specificity is 100% (95% CI:
94.9%-100%). Its PPV is 100% (95% CI: 94.6%-100%) and NPV is 98.9% (95% CI:
93.1%-99.9%). ROC curve shows its AUC = ~0.988 for this sensitivity and specificity
(Figure 2).

Clinical evaluation of paired NPS and saliva samples
We tested and evaluated the concordance between paired NPS and saliva samples
collected from patients by QuantiVirus™ SARS-CoV-2 multiplex tests. Among the 20
pairs of nasopharyngeal swabs (NP) and saliva samples, the test results were the same
for 16 pairs (16/20, 80% concordance rate), including 5 positive pairs and 11 negative
pairs. There were four samples for which the results were discordant (Table 5). Of these
four pairs, one pair was NPS positive and saliva negative, whereas the other three pairs
were NPS negative and saliva positive. Nevertheless, we compared NPS and saliva
specimens by Wilcoxon matched pair signed rank test. The two samples types show 80%
concordance with no significant differences (p=0.13, Figure 3a), and its RP were similar
between two types of specimens (p=0.06, Figure 3b).

detectable with the Abbott kit (patients #8, 11 and 12), consistent with the reported
higher sensitivity of QuantiVirus™ PCR assay.22

Population screening using saliva samples
We tested 389 total saliva specimens from the general population of asymptomatic
people in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. The screened population was
represented by African Americans, White, Asian, and Latinx, with ages ranging from 18
to 80 (average 41) years old. From May 8 to Aug 26, 2020, 301 saliva samples were
tested, and 5 samples were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by the QuantiVirus TM
SARS-CoV-2 multiplex PCR test. The 5 positives corresponded to 4 males of ages 19,
51, 52 and 54, and 1 female of age 34. Overall detection rate was 1.66% (Table 7). In
another recent testing run of 88 saliva samples, 2 samples were positive and 86 were
negative, with an overall positive detection rate of 2.27%. Overall, we had screened 389
people from the general population and found that 7 people were positive for SARSCoV-2 with a detection rate of 1.8%, consistent with the reported average positive test
rate from the same periods in the two metropolitan regions.

Evaluation of pooling saliva samples for SARS-CoV-2 screening
To test the feasibility of pooling saliva specimens for screening asymptomatic patients,
we pooled healthy donor saliva (negative) and patient saliva (positive) and tested a total
of 77 pooled samples (1 patient sample mixed with 5 healthy saliva samples) and 54
pooled health samples (mixed 6 health samples) (Table 8). Of the 77 pooled saliva
samples, 73 were tested positive (average Ct of three genes: O gene Ct~29.8; E gene
30.9 and N gene Ct ~31,0) and 4 was negative. The average IC RP Ct was 21.9 for all

131 pooled samples. Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is 100% (95% CI: 93.8%-100%).
Negative Predictive Value (NPV) is 93.1% (95% CI: 82.5-97.8%). Additionally, we tested
a total of 49 pooled saliva samples, created by mixing 1 patient sample with 11 healthy
samples. Of the 49 pooled samples, 44 were detected positive (O gene, E gene and N
gene average Ct 31.8, 32.1 and 31.9) and 5 was negative. Its IC RP average Ct was
22.3 for all 49 pooled saliva samples and additional 20 pooled healthy saliva samples.
PPV is 100% (95% CI: 89.9%-100%) and NPV is 80.0% (95% CI: 58.7%-92.4%),
respectively.

Discussion
We have developed and validated a multiplex rRT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection
with clinical sensitivity being 98.8% (95% CI: 92.7%-99.9%) and specificity of 100% (95%
CI: 94.9%-100%). Its PPV is 100% (95% CI: 94.6%-100%) and NPV is 98.9% (95% CI:
93.1%-99.9%). The ROC curve shows an AUC of ~0.988. The detection of three viral
target genes in one PCR tube enables a high throughput test using RT- qPCR. For these
validated PCR platforms, 381 patient samples can be tested in each run (plus 3 controls).
We have developed and integrated MGISP-960 High-throughput Automated Sample
Preparation System which can extract 192 samples (2x96) in about 80 min. For CLIA labs
with two MGI-960 machines, 380 samples can be tested with results available within 4
hrs. (Figure 1b)
We spiked SARS-CoV-2 viral particles into healthy donor saliva and confirmed that the
analytical sensitivity (LOD) of the QuantiVirus™ multiplex RT-qPCR test is ~100
copies/mL for Bio-Rad CFX 384 and ~200 copies/mL for ABI QS5, ABI 7500Dx and

Roche LC 480. The multiplex RT-qPCR test can simultaneously detect three viral gene
targets, which can minimize false negative results as chances of simultaneous mutations
in all three target genes in the viral genome are highly unlikely. On the other hand, this
also confirms that human saliva samples do not inhibit the RT-qPCR reaction possibly
due to the fact that inhibitor-tolerant RT-PCR master mix was used in the QuantiVirus™
SARS-CoV-2 test kit.
Leung et al 6 analyzed 95 patient‐matched paired samples from 62 patients including 29
confirmed patients with COVID‐19 and 33 COVID‐19 negative patients. The concordance
rate was 78.9% (75/95 samples) between NP and saliva. Vogels et al

19

reported a

positive agreement of 83.8% (31/37 positive samples) for nasopharyngeal swabs and
saliva when using TaqPath COVID-19 combo kit. Our data showed 80% concordance
and no significant differences between NP and saliva, which is consistent with Leung’s &
Vogels’s reports. Interestingly, for patient #4, the viral RNA was detected in the NPS
sample by both Abbott test and DiaCarta test, but viral RNA was not detected in the saliva
by either test. For patient #6, viral RNA was not detected in the NPS sample by either
test, whereas viral RNA was detected in the saliva by both tests. This observation
suggests that sample collection variables such as the time of collection and NPS sample
quality do matter in SARS-CoV-2 testing.
The 20 paired NPS-saliva samples were collected from recovering patients being
evaluated prior to their release from self-quarantine. Consequently, their viral loads were
much lower (100-1000 copies/mL), compared to the viral loads expected for the initial
diagnostic testing. For patients with active SARS-CoV-2 infection (viral loads typically are

above 10,000 copies/mL), there should be no problem detecting the virus in adequately
collected saliva samples.
Landry et al 20 described that most of saliva samples from sick patients were thick, stringy,
and difficult to pipet. Since we used the QuantiVirus™ SARS-CoV-2 saliva sample
collection kit which has VTM solution in the collection tube, the saliva was diluted 50%
and therefore much easier to process. Matic et al

21

used PBS at a 1:2 dilution that also

helped resolve highly viscous saliva samples; however, manual dilution after collection
may be associated with pipetting errors and cross contamination.
The QuantiVirus™ SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test results were 87.5% in concordance with
FDA EUA approved Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 results for saliva samples, with a
higher detection rate overall. In fact, this observation is consistent with recently reported
test sensitivity among various SARS-CoV-2 molecular tests. FDA published its SARSCoV-2 Reference Panel Comparative Data on its website on Sept 15th, 2020 22. It reported
that QuantiVirus™ SARS-CoV-2 multiplex Kit has LOD of 600 NDU/mL whereas Abbott
Realtime SARS-CoV-2 assay has LOD of 5400 NDU/mL. Accordingly, the reason for the
observation that SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was detected in three patient samples by the
QuantiVirus™ SARS-CoV-2 multiplex test but not by Abbott Realtime SARS-CoV-2 assay
was likely due to the higher sensitivity of the QuantiVirus™ SARS-CoV-2 multiplex assay.
It also demonstrated that saliva specimens represent a viable specimen type that can be
easily applied for COVID-19 testing when using more sensitive tests.
A total of 389 saliva specimens from the general population were tested and
demonstrated the feasibility of using saliva for large scale population screening. Saliva is
a non-invasive and easily collectable specimen for COVID-19 screening. Given the

drawbacks of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab sample collection, saliva
sampling could be applied as an acceptable alternative 23.
With saliva pooling strategy, we have demonstrated that 6-samples pooling (1 patient
mixed with 5 healthy saliva samples) has 94.8% sensitivity (95% CI: 86.5-98.3%) and
100% specificity (95% CI:91.7-100%), As noted, of the 77 pooled saliva samples, 4
pooling samples were tested negative. In fact, for these 4 pooled samples, the individual
patient samples used for the pooling had Ct of 34.4, 34.8, 35.7 and 37.5 for ORF1ab
gene, respectively, consistent with low viral loads (less than 100-200 copies/mL) (see
Table 1a-d). Therefore, in order to detect weakly positive patient in pooled samples, a
RT-PCR test with LOD at 100-200 copies/mL or better is required. If pooling testing is
considered, each clinical laboratory should establish laboratory-specific pooling protocol
based on the LOD of SARS-CoV-2 molecular test.
In summary, we have demonstrated that saliva specimens can be reliably used for SARSCoV-2 detection, and saliva-based large-scale population screening for COVID-19 with
or without pooling is feasible.
