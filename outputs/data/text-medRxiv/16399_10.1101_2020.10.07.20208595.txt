Abstract

Objectives

To assess social inequalities in the trends in COVID-19 infections following lockdown
Design

A cross-sectional survey conducted among the general population in France in April 2020,
during COVID-19 lockdown.
Participants

10 401 participants aged 18-64, from a national cohort who lived in the three metropolitan
French regions most affected by the first wave of COVID-19.
Main outcome

The main outcome was occurrence of possible COVID-19 symptoms, defined as the
occurrence of sudden onset of cough, fever, dyspnea, ageusia and/or anosmia, that lasted
more than three days in the 15 days before the survey. We used multinomial regression
models to identify social and health factors related to possible COVID-19 before and during
the lockdown.
Results

In all, 1,304 (13.0%; 95% CI: 12.0%-14.0%) reported cases of possible COVID-19. The effect of
lockdown on the occurrence of possible COVID-19 was different across social hierarchies.
The most privileged class individuals saw a significant decline in possible COVID-19 infections
between the period prior to lockdown and during the lockdown (from 8.8% to 4.3%,
P=0.0001) while the decline was less pronounced among working class individuals (6.9%
before lockdown and 5.5% during lockdown, P=0.03). This differential effect of lockdown

remained significant after adjusting for other factors including history of chronic disease. The
odds of being contaminated during lockdown as opposed to the prior period increased by
57% among working class individuals (OR=1.57; 95% CI: 1.0-2.48). The same was true for
those engaged in in-person professional activities during lockdown (OR=1.53; 95% CI: 1.032.29).
Interpretation

Lockdown was associated with social inequalities in the decline in COVID-19 infections,
calling for the adoption of preventive policies to account for living and working conditions.
Such adoptions are critical to reduce social inequalities related to COVID-19, as working-class
individuals also have the highest COVID-19 related mortality, due to higher prevalence of
comorbidities.

Section 1: What is already known on this topic

Significant differences in COVID-19 incidence by gender, class and race/ethnicity are
recorded in many countries in the world. Lockdown measures implemented throughout the
globe have been effective in reducing transmission risks.
Section 2: What this study adds

Our study shows that lockdown’s impact was socially differentiated and has benefited the
working classes the least. Such results underline the need to design COVID-19 preventive
policies that take into account living and working conditions, as working-class individuals
also have the highest COVID-19 related mortality, due to higher prevalence of comorbidities.

Introduction
Given the pre-existing social inequalities in health within societies1 and the significant
differences in COVID-19 mortality by gender, class and origin recorded in countries such as
France2-3, the United Kingdom4, the USA5 and other countries around the world6, several
studies address issues of social inequalities related to COVID-197-11. However, to our
knowledge, no study has investigated potential social inequalities in the effects lockdown
policies, widely implemented around the globe.
Our hypothesis is that lockdown measures, shown to be effective in reducing the number of
new cases

12

, have not been effective in the same way for all, failing to protect the most

vulnerable populations. While more privileged social classes may have had greater exposure
to the virus prior to lockdown, due to more frequent social interactions in public spaces (e.g.
bars, restaurants) and travelling, they may have better adapted to lockdown measures,
through telework, while working classes may have benefited less from lockdown conditions,
due to their professional obligations as essential workers and their living conditions in
overcrowded housing.
Our objective was to study the differential effect of lockdown measures on possible COVID19 infections according to social class in France, one of the most affected countries in
Europe by the first wave of COVID-19.

The SAPRIS (SAnté, Pratiques, Relations et Inégalités Sociales en population générale
pendant la crise COVID-19) survey was set-up mid-March 2020, with the general aim of

understanding the main epidemiological, social and behavioural challenges of the SARSCoV2 epidemic in France. It relies on a consortium of four prospective cohort studies
involving three general population-based adult cohorts and a population-based children
cohort. The analysis presented here is based on data from one of the three adult cohorts,
the Constances cohort, which is the only cohort to have accurate data on professional status
and preventive measures in the workplace. Constances is a generalist cohort made up of a
national sample of 215 000 adults aged 18 to 69 at inclusion and recruited from 2012
onwards14.
All cohort members of Constances who had regular access to the internet (n=66,848) were
invited to complete the SAPRIS questionnaire online. 69.0% participated in the survey
(46,107). To best highlight the impact of the lockdown on possible COVID-19 symptoms, we
chose to center this analysis on individuals (18-64 years) who have already been employed,
living in one of the three metropolitan French regions most affected by the first wave of
COVID-19 i.e. Grand Est, Ile-de-France (Paris Region) and Hauts-de-France. 10,101
participants met this criteria and were included in the analysis.

Ethics and public involvement

The survey was approved by the National Institute for Health and Medical Research (Inserm)
ethics evaluation committee (approval #20-672 dated March 30th, 2020).

Data collected online from April 6th to May 5th, 2020

solicited information on socio-

demographic characteristics, household size and composition, employment characteristics,
daily life conditions, childcare arrangements, alcohol and tobacco use, sexual life,
comorbidities, health care utilization and treatments. The questionnaire also addressed
COVID-19 related topics including preventive behaviors (gel, mask, social distancing) for
individuals and in the workplace, risk perceptions and COVID-19 related beliefs as well as a
detailed description of COVID-19 symptoms over the last two weeks.
Symptoms were reported if they were unusual and occurred at least once in the past 15
days. The duration of symptoms were graded on a scale of one to five (less than 1 day, 1 to 3
days, 4 to 7 days, 8 to 14 days, >14 days). Finally, the total time (in days) between the onset
of the first symptom and the date of the survey was reported.

Measures

Our main outcome was a three-category measure, distinguishing 1) No suspicion of Covid-19
contamination, 2) probable contamination before the lockdown and 3) probable
contamination during the lockdown. We used the following criteria defined by the European
Centre for Disease Prevention to identify “possible COVID-19 contamination: at least cough
or fever or dyspnea or sudden onset of ageusia, dysgeusia or anosmia occurring during the
at-risk period”15. We added an additional criterion of duration, including symptoms lasting
more than 3 days to add additional specificity to our definition.
The likely period of contamination (LPC) was identified as a function of i) the duration
between the onset of the first symptoms and the date of the survey (DFS), ii the duration of
incubation (DI: the 75th percentile duration between exposure and the onset of the first
COVID-19 symptom) of 7 days16 and iii) the date of survey (DS). LPS was defined as follows:

LPC = DS - (DFS+DI)

Based on this information probable contamination before the lockdown included LPC before
March 17th while contamination during the lockdown included LPC on or after March 17th.

Participants’ social position was defined according to 3 criteria: current professional status
(Inactive, retired or unemployed before the beginning of the pandemic/ employed but
stopped working since the beginning of the pandemic, Full-time teleworking, Full-time or
part-time in-person professional activities), socio-professional class and financial situation
as perceived by respondents (comfortable/no problems/difficult). Socio-professional class
was based on current or previous occupation, and distinguished health professions with
specific exposure to the virus. The following 5 categories were constructed: Health
professionals (doctors, nurses, caregivers), Upper class (senior managers), High middle class
(intermediate professions), Low middle class (employees and skilled workers with a diploma
of higher or equal to two years university degree), working class (unskilled employees and
workers with a diploma lower than a two years university degree).

Statistical methods

We used inverse probability weighting to correct for selection and non-participation biases.
Weights were estimated using logistic regression models, with selection or participation as
the response variables, and socio-demographics characteristics as covariates: sex, age group,
occupational status (active, inactive), social affiliation and department of residence.
Since the information on the number of rooms in the housing unit was only asked in a
second survey in June 2020, this information was missing for the 22% of the sample who

didn’t complete the second questionnaire. We imputed this data using predictions obtained
by logistic regression.
We first conducted bivariate analysis to explore the association between sociodemographic
characteristics area (size of the agglomeration and region), number of individuals living in
the household per room, educational level, nationality (French or not French), professional
status, smoking, body mass index, health status (chronic diseases), and COVID-19 related
behaviors (individual and workplace preventive measures (gel, mask, social distancing) and
possible COVID-19 contamination in three categories.
We then conducted a multinomial logistic regression to compare the risk of contamination
before (reference category) and during the lockdown according to social class, with
successive and additional adjustments for other socio-demographic and health factors. The
final model presents the variables that allow us to test our hypotheses on the effect of living
conditions: housing, social class and professional status. We performed a sensitivity analysis
including those with symptoms lasting less than 3 days and found results similar in
magnitude but some became statistically non-significant (not shown).

All analyses were performed using R software. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically
significant. All percentages are weighted to account for the complex sampling design and
post stratification.
Multivariable analyses were performed on unweighted data.

Results
Table 1 describes the sociodemographic and health characteristics distribution of study
participants and the frequency of possible COVID-19, according to the probable date of
contamination.
The sample was equally divided between men (47.6%) and women (52.4%) and the mean
age was 43.50 years (95%CI: 43.17-43.83). More than a third (38.8%) of the sample lived in
cities with more than 1,000,000 inhabitants while a minority (6.9%) lived in rural areas.
About a third of the sample (32.7%) were considered upper class while 21.8% were working
class. 15.3% of the sample had in person professional activities during the lockdown period.
Altogether, 13.0% (95% CI: 12.0%-14.0%) of participants reported symptoms compatible
with possible cases of COVID-19 (n=1335) in the two weeks preceding the survey.
Residents from the Paris region (Ile-de-France) (P=0.02), participants facing financial
difficulties (P=0.046) and those who reported chronic conditions (asthma or respiratory
pathologies specifically) (P<0.0001) were more likely to report possible COVID-19 while older
participants (P=0.003), and those who did not work before lockdown (P=0.033) were less
likely to report those symptoms. Reporting possible COVID-19 was unrelated to social class.

While the percentage of participants reporting possible COVID-19 infection during lockdown
was lower than participants reporting possible COVID-19 infection before lockdown (5.0%
versus 8.0%), this decrease was uneven across social groups. As shown in Figure 1, the

decline was most pronounced among privileged classes (from 8.8% before lockdown to 4.3%
during lockdown, P=0.001) while the decline was least pronounced among the working class
(from 6.9% before lockdown to 5.5% during lockdown, P=0.03).
In addition, those living in housings with less than one room per person were slightly more
likely to report a possible case of COVID-19 than others (16.3% versus 12.8%, P=0.08), with
no difference between before and during lockdown.

The multivariable analyses presented in Table 2 indicated that the odds of no contamination
relative to probable infection prior lockdown was unrelated to social class but depended on
the region of residence, with increased odds among residents from the Hauts-de-France
region relative to those residing in the Paris region (Ile de France) (OR= 1.39; 95% CI: 1.131.71).
Regarding the risk of infection during lockdown relative to the risk of infection before
lockdown, it was higher among participants who had in-person professional activities
compared to those who worked remotely (OR=1.53; 95% CI: 1.03-2.29). This risk was also
increased among working class compared to upper class participants (OR=1.57; 95% CI: 12.48). It is worth noting that the odds-ratio for working class was 1.53 (95% CI: 0.96-2.42)
when adjusting for smoking and it was 1.49 (95%CI: 0.93-2.4) when adjusting for history of
chronic disease and obesity. Finally, this odds-ratio was reduced to 1.39 (95% CI: 0.87-2.21)
when adjusting for perceived financial situation.

To study the stability of our results, we performed a sensitivity analysis check by repeating
the multivariate analyses without excluding individuals who reported symptoms lasting less
than 3 days. The odds ratio remained of the same magnitude but the degrees of significance
were lower (not shown).

Discussion
To our knowledge, SAPRIS is the largest general population-based COVID-19 study in Europe
that simultaneously collects detailed data on symptoms and social characteristics to
investigate the impact of lockdown on possible COVID-19 infections.
Analyses by time period, corresponding to whether individuals may have been infected
before or during lockdown, show differential trends by social class that were masked in an
overall analysis. The issue of temporality is essential because confinement measures
affected individuals differently according to their housing and working conditions5,17.
Individuals at the top of the social hierarchy saw a greater decline in COVID-19 symptoms
after the lockdown than those from the working class. In fact, working-class individuals were
more likely than those in the upper class to have been contaminated during lockdown rather
than before.
Our results show that this overexposure during lockdown was partly a result of their health
status (smoking and history of chronic disease and obesity). It was also partly an effect of
their economic precariousness since the OR of the working class decreased when it was
adjusted on this variable, a result consistent with economic work that has recently been

established at a macroeconomic level in France18. We also found that living in housing with
less than one room per person tended to be linked to the risk of having been contaminated.
Finally, our results do not reflect a lower propensity of the working class to adopt individual
prevention measures.
One can think that the overexposure to the virus of the working class during lockdown may
reflect, at least in part, the fact that more individuals belonging to this class live in
neighborhoods with high population density. Such an effect is not completely captured by
the size of the agglomeration. For example, the density in some neighborhoods in the Paris
suburbs, where excess mortality by COVID-19 is particularly high, is higher than that
observed in larger cities19. Residents of these dense cities could have faced a higher risk of
being exposed to the virus by encountering contagious individuals in shops, in the streets, or
in public transports.
In any case, the data suggest that working class individuals were less protected by the
lockdown measures than the more privileged categories.

This analysis has several limitations. First, the sample is socially diverse but is not fully
representative of the French population as it only represents three regions in France and
respondents from the Constances cohort who have internet connectivity are not
representative of all residents in France. In particular, the study fails to capture particularly
vulnerable groups such as undocumented migrants and homeless people, who are
particularly affected by the pandemic8.
While the study provides information on social status based on education and employment,
it doesn’t capture other forms of social disadvantage including race and ethnicity that are

shown to increase the risk of COVID-19 infection in many settings and the risk COVID-19
related mortality in France3 and other countries20-22.
Additionally, it should be noted that our analyses are based on reported symptoms rather
than on biologically tested cases, thus excluding asymptomatic individuals. However, the
shortage of tests did not permit the use of testing in this study conducted in the early stages
of the pandemic, especially before lockdown, as the use of RT-PCR testing was limited to
patients with severe symptoms. Our symptom-based analysis is nevertheless consistent with
epidemiological surveillance data by region19 and data on over-exposition of individuals with
chronic respiratory diseases23.
Another limitation relates to the fact that some people may have had COVID-19 symptoms
prior to the 15 days of the survey and are not counted in our possible COVID-19 cases. Since
the socio-demographic structure of the respondents is stable during the study period (not
shown), it is reasonable to think that the de facto exclusion of these situations does not
affect results on association of possible Covid19 with social class.
In addition, although symptom reporting may risk being socially differentiated, it is
reasonable to assume that any social reporting bias does not vary during the month of the
survey.
In any case, from a prevention perspective, it is important to characterise the most exposed
social groups and to try to uncover the social logics that favour this exposure, particularly
those referring to living conditions24,25.

In conclusion, we showed that the effect of a lockdown policy designed and applied without
taking into account social characteristics can contribute to increasing social inequalities in
exposure to the risk of contracting the virus, as was rightly pointed out recently by Anderson

et al.26 In this sense, the biomedical approach to prevention, which promotes preventive
measures based on clinical knowledge without taking into account the socially differentiated
effects of living conditions shows its limits, as was the case in the fight against previous
epidemics9,27. Our results call for the implementation of future preventive policies that
tackle these social inequalities. Such implementation is critical to reduce social inequalities
related to COVID-19, as working-class individuals also have the highest COVID-19 related
mortality, due to higher prevalence of comorbidities.
