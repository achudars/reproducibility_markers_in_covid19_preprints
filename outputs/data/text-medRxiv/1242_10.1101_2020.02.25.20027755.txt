Summary
Background: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global threat to public health. Aiming to
construct an efficient screening pattern, we comprehensively evaluated the performances of RT-PCR
and chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19.
Methods: The records including demographics, RT-PCR, and CT from 87 confirmed COVID-19
cases and 481 exclusion cases were collected. The diagnostic accuracy of the pharyngeal swab RT-PCR,
CT, combination with the second pharyngeal swab RT-PCR or with CT were evaluated individually.
Besides, all the stool RT-PCR results were plotted by time to explore the value of stool RT-PCR.
Findings: Combination of RT-PCR and CT has the higher sensitivity (91.9%,79/86) than RT-PCR
alone (78.2%

， 68/87)

or CT alone (66.7%, 54 of 81) or combination of two RT-PCR tests

(86.2%,75/87). There was good agreement between RT-PCR and CT (kappa-value, 0.430). In 34
COVID-19 cases with inconsistent results, 94.1% (n=32) are mild infection, 62.5% of which (20/32)
showed positive RT-PCR. 46.7% (35/75) COVID-19 patients had at least one positive stool during the
course. Two cases had positive stool earlier than the pharyngeal swabs. Importantly, one patient had
consecutive positive stool but negative pharyngeal swabs.
Interpretation: Combination of RT-PCR and CT with the highest sensitivity is an optimal pattern
to screen COVID-19. RT-PCR is superior to CT in diagnosing mild infections. Stool RT-PCR should
be considered as an item for improving discovery rate and hospital discharge. This study shed light for
optimizing scheme of screening and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction
In early December 2019, the first pneumonia cases of unknown origins were identified in Wuhan
city, Hubei province, China1. On Jan 7, a novel coronavirus was discovered using high-throughput
sequencing in the throat swab sample of a patient , and is currently named SARS-CoV-2

（previously

）

known as 2019-nCoV on February 11, 2020 by ICTV2,3. The initial defined cases of COVID-19, were
epidemiologically linked to the human seafood market in Wuhan, Although later more and more
COVID-19 were found without exposure the market but with a history to Wuhan or contact with the
patient of COVID-19 pneumonia confirmed2,4,5. Current epidemiologic data indicate the
person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital and family settings2,6,7. As of February 17,
2020, more than 71,000 laboratory-confirmed and 1,770 death cases have been documented in China
and in other countries worldwide (including the USA, German, japan and South Korea)8,9. The
mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 was around 2%. The WHO has recently declared the SARS-CoV-2 a
public health emergency of international concern10. Thus, diagnostic tests specific for this infection are
urgently needed for confirming suspected cases, screening patients and conducting virus surveillance.
Identification of pathogens mainly includes virus isolation and viral nucleic acid detection.
According to the traditional Koch’s postulates, virus isolation is the gold standard for virus diagnosis in
the laboratory. Thus, based on SARS-CoV-2 possesses a strong capability to infect humans, CDC
recommends that clinical virology laboratories should not attempt viral isolation from specimens
collected from COVID-19 patients under investigation. Because SARS-CoV-2 is a newly discovered
virus, the spectrum of the available diagnostic tools is tight. In the early stage, SARS-CoV-2 has been
detected in human clinical specimens by next-generation sequencing, cell culture, and electron
microscopy11. Further development of accurate and rapid methods to identify this emergency

respiratory pathogen is still needed.
Then the full genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (29870-bp, excluding the poly (A) tail) in
GenBank (accession number MN908947) was released quickly on January 10, 2020, which is more
than 82% identical to those of SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like coronavirus (SL-CoV)12. On the basis of
analysis of this complete genomes obtained in this study, several laboratories developed molecular
detection tools based on targeting ORF1ab, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene N, and E
regions of viral spike genes13-15. And then the rapid identification of this novel coronavirus is attributed
to recent advances in the detection of SARS-CoV-2, including RT-PCR, real-time reverse transcription
PCR (rRT-PCR), reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), and
microarray-based assays. At present, RT-PCR is a widely used detection technique for SARS-CoV-2
and several marketed nucleic acid detection kits for using in clinic14. Currently, the standard of
reference for the COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis is a positive result in nucleic acid detection assay for
the upper and lower respiratory tract specimens and blood, respiratory tract specimens were including
nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. And the patients
confirmed with the COVID-19 pneumonia had 2 or 3 continuous negative RT-PCR results for
nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens can discharge from hospital. However, the scholar around
china indicated that cases of COVID-19 that had 2 or 3 continuous negative RT-PCR results for
nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens before finally laboratory-confirmed[13]. And currently,
several reports has reported the positive RT-PCR results for stool of COVID-19 patients16,17. Based on
the infected patients can potentially shed the SARS-CoV2 through respiratory and fecal-oral routes,
The value of RT-PCR results for stool in early diagnosis and monitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be

Fever, cough and dyspnea were the most common symptoms in patients with COVID-19
pneumonia. A manifestation similar of those of two other disease caused by coronaviruses, severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)18-20. CT is an important
method in the diagnosis of lung lesions, and the radiological changes in the lungs of COVID-19
patients has been characterized21. Zhong et al. reported that of 840 COVID-19 patients who underwent
CT on admission, around 76.4% manifested abnormal CT imaging features and usually exhibited
typical radiological finding of the ground-glass opacity (50%) or bilateral patchy shadowing (46%)22.
Based on the “Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline for New Coronavirus Pneumonia (the fifth edition),
China”, CT scan were used as the clinical diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 pneumonia, but strictly

，

limited in Hubei Province23. However, the specificity of chest CT is relatively low alone could not
distinguish the SARS-CoV-2 infection from other pathogens well.
SARS-CoV-2 causes extensively outbreak in cold winter. In this season, many other pathogens
causing pneumonia also become prevalent, even including many viral agent. The infectious diseases
share some common characteristics in signs, symptoms and laboratory findings. Therefor it is difficult
to differentiate COVID-19 suffers from other pneumonia patients purely depending to the
manifestation or routine examination. Therefore , an precision screening scheme is urgent to be
employed. High sensitive test is pivotal to avoiding secondary transmission by missed diagnosed cases.
Meanwhile, the positive predictive value also should be counted, for a number of false positive would
bring out not only occupation and cost of healthcare resource, but also increasing infection risk of
suspected cases isolated in hospital. In this study, we performed a retrospective study in the 568 cases
and compare the efficacy of RT-PCR and CT diagnostic approaches in COVID-19 diagnosis, and to
provide evidence for future strategic diagnosis in regions outside Hubei Province.

Methods
Data sources
For this retrospective, single center study, we recruited 584 patients from Jan 17 to Feb 11, 2020,
at The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University in Zhuhai, China, which is a designated
infectious hospital. During this period, RT-PCR and chest CT was performed for consecutive patients
including the local residents of Wuhan, outside of Wuhan did have a recent travel to Wuhan or contact
with people with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan, or had fever or acute respiratory
symptoms of unknown cause. Of the 16 patients recruited as of Feb 11, had a suspected diagnosis and
were therefore excluded in this study. 87 patients, who were diagnosed as having COVID-19 and 481
patients exclusion COVID-19 according to WHO interim guidance, were enrolled in this study. The
performances of the first RT-PCR detection in pharyngeal swabs and chest CT were evaluated by
sensitivity, specificity, youden’s index et al. Then the performances of combination of the second
RT-PCR, or chest CT were also calculated. Agreement between the two method was analyzed using
McNemar Chi-squared test. Finally the all RT-PCR results from pharyngeal and stool were plotted by
time to explore the value of stool nucleic detection (Fig 1). The severity of COVID-19 pneumonia was
defined based on the international guidelines for community-acquired pneumonia24. Laboratory and CT
characteristics data were obtained with standard data collection forms from electronic medical records.
The study was approved by The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University Ethics
Committee and written informed consent was obtained from patients involved before enrolment when
data were collected retrospectively.

The SARS-Cov-2 laboratory test assays were based on the previous WHO recommendation. The
upper respiratory tract specimens (pharyngeal and nasal swabs) and stool were obtained from all the
cases. Ensure each specimen collected has the name, gender and age of the patient as well as a serial
number; any abnormality in the specimen should be noted.
RNA was extracted and tested by real-time RT-PCR with SARS-Cov-2 specific primers and
probes according to instruction of Kit. The real-time RT-PCR was carried out in biosafety level 2
facilities at the clinic laboratory. If two targets (RdRp+, E or N +) tested positive by specific RT-PCR,
the patients would be considered to be laboratory-confirmed.
Negative: no Ct value or Ct

40.

Positive: a Ct value < 37.
A Ct value between 37-40 is indeterminate. It is required confirmation by repeating. If, when
repeated, the Ct value is < 37 the sample is positive, otherwise, it is negative.
Chest CT
On admission, the chest CT images were detected among 365 patients. Of the 365 patients, typical
and atypical chest CT findings were recorded. According to the Diagnosis and Treatment Program of
2019 New Coronavirus Pneumonia (trial sixth version), The typical findings of chest CT images were
bilateral multiple lobular and subsegmental areas of consolidation, bilateral ground glass opacity and
subsegmental areas of consolidation. Later chest CT images showed bilateral ground-glass opacity.
The findings with image features mentioned in Diagnosis and Treatment Program and interpreted
by two radiologists are positive. No imaging abnormalities or exclusion of virus infection are defined
as negative. That the abnormal imaging doesn't accordance with the features in trial sixth version, but
cannot rule out virological infection were defined as uncertain.

Statistical analysis.
Retrieved data were recorded into Microsoft ® Excel and analyzed. Continuous variables were
expressed as median and range deviation. The independent sample t-test and one-sample t-test were
utilized to compare significant differences among continuous data. Statistical analysis of agreement
was performed using McNemar Chi-squared test. It was regarded as statistical significance when the
value was less than 0.05. We used R (version 3.5.0) for all analyses.
3. Results
3.1 The common characteristics of the patients and specimen in this study
The patients involved in this study summed 568, including 87 COVID-19 and 481 non-COVID19.
All of them were the local residents of Wuhan, had a recent travel to Wuhan or contacted with people
from Wuhan. And they were all eligible for the epidemiology criteria of suspected cases, and received
further medical isolation, examination and diagnosis. Among the patients, 58.2% were males.
Throughout the whole spectrum of age, 15-59 years group generates 60.6% of all populations in this
study, and 5.7% of patients were aged below 15 years (Table 1). In the disease severity, 83.9% (73 of
87 patients) were mild and 16.1% (14 of 87 patients)were severe.
In the early stage of COVID outbreak, RT-PCR and CT scan were the main measure for screening
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hence we collected the results of the two methods in the 568patints in further.
In the period of Jan 17th to Feb 11th , total 1674 specimen from the 568 patients were detected by
RT-PCR, which included 1415 pharyngeal and 259 stool (Table1). All patients after being admission
received at least one RT-PCR detection for pharyngeal swabs, and 341 patients were subjected to the
second RTPCR test for pharyngeal swabs. The stool detected by RT-PCR accounted to 259, 81 of
which were from COVID-19 patients. Among the 568 patients, 364 patients were subjected to CT scan,

81 of which were COVID-19 patients. We looked through the case data retrospectively and found that 5
patients without CT scan were admitted to hospital complaining of epidemiology contact. Although
they were eventually diagnosed, they had only mild symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection on
admission and in the course of infection, and no CT scan had been performed.
3.2 The performance evaluation of the RT-PCR, CT scan and combination patterns in
diagnosis of COVID-19
In the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, RT-PCR for pharyngeal and CT scan is the main
screening strategy. Aiming to evaluate the property of the two methods in diagnosing SARS-CoV-2
infection, the performance indexes of RTPCR detection and CT scan were computed respectively. The
results were shown in Table2. The sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR for pharyngeal were 78.2%
and 98.8%. positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 91.9% and 96.2. and Youden’s
index was 0.770, which indicated overall performance. In the methodology evaluation of CT scan,
criteria was defined firstly as an image diagnostic method. According the standard above, the data
about the CT scan performance were evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity were 66.7% and 68.2%,
lower than RT-PCR of pharyngeal. positive predictive and negative predictive value were 56.8% and
92.3% and Youden’s index was 0.343 (Table2).
Besides that, we also analyze the agreement of the two methods (The cases with uncertain CT
results were not involved in statistical analysis due to statistical limitations). As is shown in Table3,
there was statistically significance between the two methods (p<0.001). Moreover, there was
statistically differences in the diagnosis of non-COVID-19 patients(p<0.001), but not in COVID-19
patients (p=0.734). The agreement was good to fair agreement (kappa value, 0.430) , and the adjusted
agreement was 72.8% in all patients.

Given that the time on receiving detection can cause influences on sensitivity, the time differences
between RT-PCR for pharyngeal and CT scan were compared. The average time of nucleic acid
screening was earlier than that of CT scan statistically (-0.7390days, -3625~1.674) (Table 4). The
COVID-19 group received an of CT scan later than the non-COVID-19 group in average
(-1.7160,-5.185~1.753 v.s . -0.4594, -2.391~1.472, p=0.002) (Table 4).
In purpose to explore the characteristics of the RT-PCR and CT scan in diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2
infections, 127 cases with inconsistent diagnosis by two methods were selected for further analysis,
which is consisted of 34 COVID-19 patients and 93 non-COVID-19 cases (Fig.2). Notably mild cases
count to 94.1% in COVID-19 suffers (32/34) (Fig2.A). 20 of the 32 cases showed RT-PCR positive
& CT negative or RT-PCR positive & CT uncertain, suggested the priority of RT-PCR in identifying
mild infections. There are still 12 cases with RT-PCR negative & CT positive or RT-PCR negative &
CT uncertain, we are inclined to consider unqualified sampling or low viral load in early stage were
responsible for the false discovery of RT-PCR. Only two inconsistent cases were severe infections
(Fig2.A)., indicating both of the methods reached the good accordance. Besides that, we also focused
the results pattern in 93 non-COVID 19, that mainly presented RT-PCR negative & CT positive (n=40)
and RT-PCR negative & CT uncertain (n=49) (Fig2.B). That is 95.3% (89/93) patients possessed
negative RT-PCR but abnormal CT results. We concluded that CT scan is an morphology detection,
not pathogen identification, hence, it was difficult to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 from other viruses or
pathogens accurately.
It is notable that both of the methods acquired the sensitivity less than 80% in screening
SARS-CoV-22 infections, which is not ideal enough for the diagnosis of infectious diseases with severe
consequences. To develop more appropriate detection scheme, the performances of combination

RT-PCR and CT were evaluated in future. The 568 cases being subjected to first RT-PCR and second
RT-PCR for pharyngeal and 341 being subjected to CT scan were analyzed. The performance indexes
were shown in Table1. The results showed that the sensitivity of RT-PCR in parallel with CT scan was
the highest( 91.9%), which was higher than that of parallel with second nucleic acid (86.2%) (Table1).
But the specificity of two nucleic acid detections was significantly higher than that of combination of
nucleic acid and CT, suggesting that nucleic acid in parallel with CT was more appropriate to screen
SARS-CoV-22 infections, and two nucleic acid tests for exclusion diagnosis maybe more suitable.
3.3 The value of nucleotide detection in stool was evaluated in COVID-19 patients.
It is reported that alive virus can survive in stool of COVID-19 patients. According our data, 8.6%
patients (Table1) cannot be identified by combination of RT-PCR for pharyngeal swab and CT scan.
Since that, can the RT-PCR test for stool be an efficiency assisting examination? In this study, there
were 75 COVID-19 cases subjecting to stool nucleotide detection. Therefore, all of the RT-PCR results
from 75 case with stool nucleotide detection were plotted along time axis (Figure3). It was
demonstrated that 35 cases had at least one positive results and the discovery rate is 46.7%. The stool
presented earlier positive than the throat swab in two cases (patient No. 21, 38) (Figure3) . Moreover,
pharyngeal swab of No.21 patient had been always negative until the end of the study. There were 16
patients with remaining positive results of stool after two consecutive negative results of pharyngeal
swabs ( patient No.2,8,13,15,18,21,24,26,27,29,30,35,39,40,42,48) during their hospitalization
(Figure3). Importantly, of the 14 discharged patients, two cases had stools being negative later than
pharyngeal swabs (Patient No.2,10) (Figure3). The data above suggested that the detection of fecal
nucleic acid could be employed to improve the discovery rate and might be developed as an indicator
of monitoring and de-isolation.

Discussion
SARS-CoV-2, a novel betacoronavirus are a major cause of symptomatic respiratory tract
infection in all age groups worldwide11,16,25. Timely and accurate diagnosis of the virus enables
appropriate treatment of infections. RT-PCR is widely deployed in diagnostic virology. In the case of a
public health emergency, proficient diagnostic laboratories can rely on this robust technology to
establish new diagnostic tests within their routine services before pre-formulated assays become
available.
In our study, the sensitivity of RT-PCR was greater than that other reports (78% vs 30%-50%) in
the first assay. The reasons for the high sensitivity of our series may include26,27: The first was samples,
in some hospital, the patients’ nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs were collected for testing the
SARS-CoV-2 separately. In our study, the detection specimen was the patient's pharyngeal and nasal
swabs combine, compared to the pharyngeal or nasal swab only , indicating higher sensitivity at initial
screening. We show that the strategy for the detection of viral RNA in pharyngeal and nasal swabs
used for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis is not perfect. We also found that the virus are present in several stool
swabs of patients when pharyngeal and nasal swabs detection negative. Based on the infected patients
can potentially shed this pathogen through respiratory and fecal-oral routes, we applied test for oral and
stool swabs which could greatly improved detection positive rate.
Among the 87 laboratory-confirmed cases, there were still 19 cases with RT-PCR results testing
negative in the first assay. In the false negatives can be caused by poor sample quality, such as
respiratory tract samples collected from the oropharynx; collection that is too early or late in the
progression of the disease, in the early stages, the number of viruses in the body is not enough to be

detected. samples that have not been properly stored, transported, or processed, SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus is RNA virus, which is prone to death and degradation. In the process of collecting
samples and transporting them to the laboratory for testing, it takes a long time and the nucleic acid is
easy to degrade, so it is not easy to detect positive. At last, technical factors, including virus mutation
and PCR inhibition.
In our study, the sensitivity of RT-PCR was higher than that of the chest CT (78.5% vs 66.7%,
respectively). The reasons for the relatively lower efficiency of chest CT is may include, 1) The major
of COVID-19 patients was mild, in the early detection, there is no features or typical features of chest
CT in our study. 2) We divided three groups in the 365 patients, one group is COVID-19 positive, the
other group is COVID-19 negative. Our results support RT-PCR combine chest CT for first screening
for COVID-19 for patients with clinical and epidemiologic features.
To date, two team from China have reported to succeed isolating alive SARS-CoV-2 in
COVID-19 patients feces (data unpublished). According to these study, some of the provisions have
been supplemented about strictly handling the patient's secretions. Many coronaviruses can be
transmitted through oral-fecal route by infecting intestines. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to lineage B,
betacoronavirus (β-CoV) genus. The other member in this lineage is SARS-CoV, responsible for
SARS outbreak in 2003 in China, can be detected in the stool of patients28. MERS, lineage C β-CoVs,
has been proved existing in the feces29,30. For it is not too surprise to detect SARS-CoV-2 in stool. It is
reported that SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in the stool of a patient in the USA16,17. However,
our study give an important hint that in a big portion of COVID-19 patients’ stool are there the RNA of
SARS-CoV-2 and up to 16 patients presented positive stool after two negative pharyngeal swabs,
which indicates stool nucleotide has potential role in monitoring infection as an supplement item.

Moreover, what deserve attention more is patients No.22, who had none positive pharyngeal swabs in
all the stage of infection, but positive stool. Until the end of the observation, the patient were still under
treatment. Although it can’t be absolutely excluded that pharyngeal presented false negative or shifting
positive later, at least stool detection need be involved in examination for the strongly suspected
persons with negative pharyngeal swab. Besides that, that stool remain positives in a later stage of
infection suggests that fecal nucleic acid negative conversion should be included in the discharge
criteria. In our center, there was no recurrence infection in 17 discharged patients, for the stool
nucleotide had been detected before being out of hospitalization. Of course, we just provide the
evidence the RNA in the stool. whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by oral to fecal need to be
studied in future.
Combination of pharyngeal RT-PCR and chest CT with higher sensitivity is an reasonable option
to screen SARS-CoV-2 infection patients. Two pharyngeal RT-PCR detections with higher specificity
can be used in exclude diagnosis. RT-PCR has the more advantage in screening mild infection
comparing to chest CT. RT-PCR of stool should be adopted to improve discovery rate and counted as
an item for discharging from hospital. Our study shed light for the optional scheme of the clinical
diagnosis and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
