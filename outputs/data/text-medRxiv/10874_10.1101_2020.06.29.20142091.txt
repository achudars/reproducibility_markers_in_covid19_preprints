In severe asthma, gene expression of ACE, TMPRSS2 and furin are elevated compared to mildmoderate asthma and healthy volunteers, particularly in neutrophilic asthma. This might explain the
increased risk of death in severe asthma afflicted with COVID19.

Summary
Background. Patients with severe asthma may have a greater risk of dying from COVID-19 disease
caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and enzyme
proteases, transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and furin are needed for the attachment
and invasion of the virus into host cells. We determined whether their expression in the airways of
severe asthma patients is increased.
Method. We examined the microarray mRNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin in the
sputum, bronchial brush and bronchial biopsies of participants in the European U-BIOPRED cohort.
Results. ACE2 and furin sputum gene expression was significantly increased in severe non-smoking
asthma compared to mild-moderate asthma and healthy volunteers. By contrast, TMPRSS2
expression in bronchial biopsy and bronchial brushings was increased in severe smoking and exsmoking asthmatics, and so was furin expression in bronchial brushings. Several clinical parameters
including male gender, oral steroid use and nasal polyps were positively associated with ACE2,
TMPRSS2 and furin expression levels. There was a higher expression of ACE2 and furin in the sputum
neutrophilic molecular phenotype with inflammasome activation compared to the eosinophilic
Type2-high or paucigranulocytic phenotypes. The enrichment score of the IL-13-Type2 gene
signature was positively correlated with ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin levels.
Conclusion. These key determinants of virus entry into the lungs may contribute to the poorer
outcomes from COVID-19 disease in patients with severe asthma.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is posing un unprecedented impact on global health.
COVID-19 infection caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus has been reported to be more common or
severe in patients with older age or pre-existing conditions (1-5). However, it is unclear whether
asthma is associated with poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19. Although a few studies did not find a
significant association between asthma and critical outcomes in COVID-19 patients (1-5), they did
not characterize asthma in detail, including clinical and inflammatory phenotypes. A recent large
population-based study in UK reported a higher risk of death in patients with severe asthma who
developed COVID-19 disease (6), with another study indicating that those with chronic lung disease
also had a poorer outcome (3). Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that asthma heterogeneity,
particularly severity, is an important factor in understanding the risk of fatal outcomes in COVID-19
among asthmatic patients.
The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
receptor allowing the virus to attach to the cell membrane of the host (7). The next step for entry
into the cell depends on the spike protein being degraded by host cell enzyme proteases, such as
transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and furin also known as PACE (Paired basic Amino
acid Cleaving Enzyme) (8, 9). Because this is the way by which SARS-CoV-2 infects and actively
replicates in respiratory tract epithelial cells that expresses ACE2 receptors, we tested the
hypothesis that the expression of these entry points for the virus may be different by asthma
severity, and/or by clinical or molecular phenotypes.
We examined the transcriptomic data obtained from 3 airway compartment of airway cells,
namely, bronchial brushings, bronchial biopsies and sputum-derived cells in patients with severe
asthma from the U-BIOPRED (Unbiased BIOmarkers Predictive of REspiratory Disease outcomes)
cohort (10) and analysed the expression of genes that encode for ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin. We
also examined the relationship of the gene expression with co-morbidities that are known to be
associated with high risk for COVID-19 and asthma molecular phenotypes or transcriptomic
associated clusters (TACs), previously identified in U-BIOPRED.

Methods
Subjects
The European-wide U-BIOPRED cohort consisted of 4 groups of participants: Group A: severe nonsmoking asthma (SAns), Group B: ever smokers with severe asthma (SAs), Group C: mild/moderate
non-smoking asthmatics (MMA) and Group D: non-smoking healthy volunteers (HV) (10). Sputum
cells, brushings of the lower airways, and bronchial biopsies (Supplementary Table S1) were
obtained. Expression profiling was performed using U133 Plus 2.0 microarray (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA) on total RNA extracted and data assessed by multiarray average normalization.
Demographics of the patients and healthy volunteers is shown in Supplementary Table S1. All UBIOPRED participants gave signed informed consent to participate in the study which was approved
by the local Ethics Committee of each country.

Data analysis and statistics
Data were downloaded from the tranSMART platform (11). We analysed the gene expression of
ACE2, TMPRSS2, and furin in the lower airway samples obtained from asthmatics and healthy
subjects. A regression-based method (R package limma; version 3.45.0) was used to analyse these
three genes with respect to the groups of interest, such as by the presence of asthma, across asthma
severity subgroups, and also across 3 TACs (12). The presence of comorbidities (e.g. allergic rhinitis,
nasal polyps, and eczema) was determined by physician diagnosis history. Age, sex, BMI (body mass
index), and the use of oral corticosteroids (OCS) were adjusted for as covariates in the linear models.
The Benjaminiâ€“Hochberg procedure controlled false discovery rate. Spearman's rank correlation
was used for correlation analysis.

Signatures summarised by gene set variation analysis
Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) was used to calculate sample-wise enrichment scores (ESs) (13)
for eight asthma-associated gene signatures. These gene sets each relate to a specific aspect of
airway inflammation and asthma pathogenesis (Supplementary Table S2). The correlation between
ESs and expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and furin was calculated using Spearman's correlation. For
group comparison P values were determined by differential expression analysis using moderated ttest, with adjustment for age, gender, body mass index and oral corticosteroid (R package limma;
version 3.45.0).

Results
Intra-compartmental correlations of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin
ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin mRNA expression was assessed in sputum (Fig 1A-C), bronchial brushing
(Fig 1D-F), and bronchial biopsy (Fig 1G-I) compartments from HVs and asthmatics of different
severity. There was no significant correlation between the expression of these three genes, in any
compartment, except for a positive correlation between ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in sputum
cells (n=89; r=0.252; p=0.010; Supplementary Table S3).

Expression of ACE2
Overall, the gene expression levels were not significantly different between HVs and asthmatics
when asthmatics analysed as a single group (data not shown). However, differences were revealed
when sub-grouped by asthma severity. There was a significant increase in the expression of ACE2 in
SAns versus MMA and HV in sputum, when adjusted for age, gender and OCS use (Fig 1A). Within
asthmatics, the levels of ACE2 in sputum were higher in males and those on OCS (Table 1), and the
expression of ACE2 in sputum positively correlated with the blood neutrophil count (r=0.21, p<0.05)
and sputum neutrophil (%) count (r=0.28, p<0.01; Table 2). Expression levels of ACE2 mRNA were
relatively lower in bronchial brushings and biopsies than in sputum (Supplementary Table S4). In
bronchial brushings, ACE levels correlated with blood neutrophil count, but not with other baseline
parameters (r=0.21, p<0.05; Table 2). In bronchial biopsies, the expression levels of ACE2 were
higher in patients with nasal polyps but was not associated with other baseline parameters (Table
2).

Expression of TMPRSS2
TMPRSS2 mRNA expression levels were higher in bronchial brushings than in sputum or bronchial
biopsies (Supplementary Table S4). In bronchial brushings, there was a significantly increased
expression of TMPRSS2 in SAs (versus MMA and HV) (Figure 1E), and the expression levels of
TMPRSS2 positively correlated with blood neutrophils (r=0.21, p<0.05) (Table 2). In bronchial
biopsies, TMPRSS2 levels were significantly higher in SAs (versus MMA and HV) (Figure 1H) and were
increased in subjects with nasal polyps but also in those without allergic rhinitis (Table 1). However,
TMPRSS2 expression was similar across all groups in sputum (Fig 1B).

Expression of furin

Expression levels of furin were higher in sputum than in bronchial brushings and biopsies
(Supplementary Table S4). In sputum, expression of furin was significantly greater in SAns compared
to MMA and HVs (Fig 1C). Within the whole asthmatic group, sputum furin levels negatively
correlated with FEV1 (% of predicted) (r=-0.21, p<0.05) and FeNO levels (r=-0.26, p<0.05), but
positively with blood neutrophil count (r=0.24, p<0.05) and stronger with sputum neutrophil (%)
(r=0.6, p<0.001) (Table 2). Meanwhile, in bronchial brushings, furin level was significantly higher in
SAs than HVs (Figure 1F); however, it did not correlate with clinical parameters (Tables 1 and 2).
Furin levels in bronchial biopsy were not significantly different across groups or by clinical
parameters (Figure 1I and Tables 1 and 2).

Expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin in molecular phenotypes of asthma
We determined the expression of these three genes in sputum amongst the three previously
identified TACs (12, 14). As previously described, analysis of sputum transcriptomics in U-BIOPRED
produced three molecular endotypes (12). The expression of ACE2 was highest in TAC2, an endotype
characterized by sputum neutrophilic inflammation and inflammasome activation signature,
compared to TAC1 (eosinophilic inflammation, T2-high) and TAC3 (paucigranulocytic inflammation),
with levels higher than in HVs (Fig 2A). Furin expression showed a similar trend as that of ACE2 with
the highest expression in TAC2, significantly higher than in TAC1 (Fig 2C). There was no significant
difference in TMPRSS2 expression among the three TACs (Fig 2B).

Gene signatures and expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin
To further determine the relationship between gene signatures of interest and the expression levels
of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin, we measured by GSVA the ESs of IL-13-Th2, eosinophil activation, IL17, neutrophil activation,

IL-6-trans-signalling

(IL-6-TS),

and

inflammasome

signatures

(Supplementary Table S2). The ES of IL-13-Th2 signature showed positive correlations with ACE2,
TMPRSS2 and furin levels in the majority of compartments analysed (Table 3). The ES of eosinophil
activation weakly correlated weakly with ACE2 in sputum (r=0.18, p<0.05), and with furin in
bronchial biopsies (r=0.26, p<0.05). However, furin levels in all 3 compartments correlated with the
neutrophil activation and IL-6-TS signatures with the highest correlation in sputum (r=0.51, p<0.001;
and r=0.54, p<0.001, respectively). Inflammasome activation also significantly correlated with furin
levels in sputum (r=0.49, p<0.001) and in bronchial brushings (r=0.30, p<0.001).

Discussion
COVID-19 is a disease that spreads easily, hence the pandemic, causes severe illness in
around 20% of affected individuals, with up to 33% deaths in those admitted to hospital. The factors
that determine the clinical picture are slowly becoming apparent, but elucidation of the molecular
mechanisms that must be the defining factors for all clinical disease has not been achieved,
especially in the context of individual chronic diseases, like asthma, and the various phenotypes of
this condition that varies from mild to very severe. Analysing three cell compartments (biopsies,
brushings, and sputum cells) this study provides compelling evidence for over expression of the
factors that may determine the entry of the SARS-CoV2 into cells, ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin in severe
asthma. In contrast, their expression in mild to moderate asthmatics compared to mild-moderate
asthma was similar to healthy controls. Together, these observations suggest that patients with
severe asthma, and not those with mild disease, have the pathobiological substrate that determines
the strength of infection by SARS-CoV-2. Our findings also suggest that the associations between
SARS-CoV2 infection and asthma are likely to be complex, and support the epidemiological
observation (6) that severe asthma may increase the risk of severe morbidity or mortality if infected
with SARS-CoV-2 virus with increased probability in males, OCS users or those with comorbid nasal
polyps.
In sputum, ACE2 and furin were most highly expressed in severe non-smoking asthma (SAns),
while in bronchial biopsies and bronchial brushings, TMPRSS2 was more highly expressed in severe
smoking/ex-smoking asthma (SAs). Further analysis suggested that several factors including male
gender, OCS use or comorbid nasal polyps have a higher expression of these genes in sputum,
bronchial biopsies or bronchial brushings. We also found that a specific molecular cluster (TAC2) in
asthma, characterized by predominant sputum neutrophilic inflammation and inflammasome
activation (12), had a higher expression of ACE2 and furin, than the other TACs. It was followed by
TAC1, a predominantly sputum eosinophilic phenotype with the highest enrichment of gene
signatures for IL-13/Type-2 (T2) inflammation, and lowest in TAC3, with a paucigranulocytic sputum
associated with mild eosinophilia and increased metabolic and mitochondrial function genes.
However, the expression of TMPRSS2 was not different amongst the 3 TACs or compared to healthy
individuals. These findings are supported by the significant correlations between ACE2 and furin
expression with gene signatures of relevance to asthma, such as neutrophil activation, IL-6-TS,
inflammasome, or IL13-Th2 pathways. Thus, there is the possibility that these pathways may

increase the expression of ACE2 or furin. Collectively, these suggest that molecular heterogeneity
may be associated with the varying risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in asthmatics.
Olfactory and taste disturbance is a common symptom of COVID-19, and the nasal
epithelium is suggested to be a major route of viral infection (15, 16). In this study, we did not report
nasal brushing data in detail, as three gene expression levels in nasal brushings did not differ by
asthma severity or molecular phenotype (data not presented) and also were not significantly
different in those with nasal polyps (Supplementary Fig S1). However, the absolute gene expression
levels were higher in nasal brushings than in other airway compartments (Supplementary Table S4),
supporting a recent expression analysis report (16). Based on the expression patterns in the upper
and lower airways, we suggest that severe asthmatics might have a higher risk of poorer outcomes
from COVID-19, although the risk of infection via the nasal route is unlikely to be different.
A strength of our analysis is that it evaluates expression in a range of airway cell populations
(epithelial brushings, bronchial biopsies and sputum cells) in well-characterised subjects allowing,
particularly in severe asthma, assessment in different sub-divided, phenotypic populations. Like a
recent publication that found no difference in gene expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin
between healthy, mild-to-moderate asthma and severe asthma in bronchial brush samples, we did
not find differences when the severe asthmatics were those classified as non-smokers but did find
differences in those with severe asthma who were either current smokers or ex-smokers with a 5pack-year history or more. By contrast it was only the severe non-smoking asthmatics that had
increased gene expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in sputum, a difference that was not evident when
mild/moderate and severe asthma were all included as a mixed asthma population in a previous
study (17).
Consistent with the importance of focusing on phenotypic populations, in asthmatic children
with respiratory allergy and allergen exposure have reduced levels of ACE2 expression in
nasal/bronchial epithelial brushings compared to those without allergies (18). Similarly, in bronchial
brushings in adults with mild-moderate asthma, ACE2 expression has been reported to be
significantly reduced in those defined as T2-high asthma (high expression of three-gene signature;
CLCA1, POSTN, SERPINB2) compared to those with T2-low asthma (19). Our failure to confirm these
findings in severe asthma may be due to confounding by therapy, the nature of the underlying type
2 inflammatory process (Th2 allergen driven vs ILC2 non-allergen driven) as well as the analytic
approach. Using GSVA, we showed that the expression of the T2 signature to correlate positively
with the expression of the 3 genes in most of the 3 compartments, while the neutrophil activation

signature was only correlated with furin expression. These differences may reflect the complexity
of asthma driving mechanisms whereby the presence of differing percentages of Th2, Th17 and Th1
pathways in each asthmatic individual (20, 21) may effect upon the overall expression of the SARSCoV-2 entry and activation genes.
Another strength of our study is the large sample size and the fact that the U-BIOPRED cohort
came from one single large study that recruited healthy controls, mild-moderate asthmatics and
severe asthmatics using the same pre-defined protocol. In addition, we compared the expression of
these three pivotal genes for SARS-CoV-2 virus entry in three different compartments of relevance:
bronchial epithelial cells from brushings, bronchial biopsy with epithelial and submucosal cells and
sputum cells with granulocyte inflammation. It is this uniform approach that gives confidence in the
observation that the levels of ACE2, TRPMSS2 and furin are higher in severe asthma compared to
mild moderate asthma, particularly in males, with nasal polyps or on oral corticosteroid therapy,
and those with an eosinophilic and neutrophilic inflammation. However, a limitation of our study is
that these data cannot apportion cause and effect as this is a comparative study with correlation
analyses. In addition, we do not know whether the increased gene expression is associated with
greater protein expression. Further studies are therefore warranted.
