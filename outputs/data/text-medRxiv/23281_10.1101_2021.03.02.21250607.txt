The safety of students worldwide remains a key issue during COVID-19. The reopening of
universities in high risk countries during Fall 2020 resulted in numerous outbreaks. While
regular screening and testing on campus can prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, they are
extremely challenging to implement due to various reasons such as cost and logistics. However,
for low risk countries with minimal to no community spread, our study suggests that universities
can fully reopen without testing, if students self-quarantine for 14 days on arrival and adopt
proper nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). This alternative strategy might save institutions
millions of dollars. We adopt agent-based simulation to model virus transmission on campus and
test the effectiveness of several NPIs when school reopens. Assuming one initially infected
student, results indicate that transmission between roommates causes the most infections with
visitors, ground floors, and elevators, being the next main contributors. Limiting density and/or
population are not impactful at flattening the curve. However, adopting masks, minimizing
movement, and increasing the frequency of cleaning can effectively minimize infection and
prevent outbreak, allowing for classes and activities to resume as normal.

As of February 2021, 28 countries still have yet to reopen schools, while others have partially
opened or fully opened1. Prolonged school closure due to COVID-19 severely impacts students’
mental health, academic performance, social network, and family life2. However, reopening
schools puts students, staff, and faculty at high risk3. Since universities and colleges in many
countries reopened during Fall 2020, a number of them have experienced outbreaks on campus
and become COVID-19 hot spots4-9. In the U.S. for instance, over a third of colleges and
universities reopened fully in August3. By December, more than 397,000 cases and at least 90
deaths were documented across 1,900 schools10. These institutions of higher education are at
extremely high risk of COVID-19 outbreak due to high density, high percentage of non-local
students, and on-campus dormitories3,11.

In theory, regular screening and testing on university campus can facilitate reopening by
detecting and preventing the transmission of SARS-CoV-212. A number of studies have focused
on their implementation in very high risk countries (as defined by the U.S. CDC13-14), such as in
the U.S. and the U.K., where they are crucial for safe reopening, and provided related policy
recommendations. Gillam et al. surveyed the feasibility and students’ acceptance of
asymptomatic testing on a university campus15. Denny et al. discussed the implementation of a
pooled surveillance testing program for asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in Duke
university12. Ghaffarzadegan used equation-based model to investigate how testing, masking,
enhanced communication, and remote work can help contain the spread of virus on campus16.
Gressman and Peck developed stochastic agent-based model to determine the viability of inperson instruction when randomized testing, contact-tracing, and quarantining are systematically
implemented17.

However, there are several limitations associated with regular testing, namely sensitivity,
cost, and availability. Paltiel et al. estimated the testing cost for one semester of 80 days and
5,000 students using tests with 70%, 80%, and 90% sensitivity, respectively18. In the best-case
scenario, weekly testing with 70% sensitivity would cost the school almost $700,000, whereas
daily testing with 90% sensitivity would cost more than $20 million. Most institutions simply
cannot financially afford and maintain regular testing of this magnitude. In addition, some health
professionals pointed out that testing capacity can be severely limited at times, and results might
take more than two weeks to arrive in countries facing large number of cases19. All of these
issues deter the implementation of regular testing on campus.

Despite the theoretical promises tests bring in computer models, many universities that
reopened in Fall 2020 lacked organized testing programs and policies; even for those that did,
many only adopted symptom-based screening, which was not a robust prevention strategy3. For
U.S. colleges with in-person classes and more than 5,000 students, only 25% conduct mass
screening or random “surveillance” of students and only 6% regularly test all their students12.
Past events have made evident that reopening universities in very high risk countries can lead to
outbreaks on campus20, even if some form of testing policy is implemented. Therefore, we turn
our attention to facilitating the safe reopening of universities in low risk countries, such as in
Australia, China, and Greenland (as of May 2021 defined by the U.S. CDC14) where community
spread is minimal or nonexistent.

The objective of this study is to model and assess an alternative strategy that do not
utilize testing for university reopening in low risk countries. Instead, students will self-quarantine
in their residences for 14 days before classes start. This approach is adopted by our school as
well as others12,21,22 around the world and is shown to reduce test positivity rates among
students2. In addition, students and campus administrators will adopt several nonpharmaceutical
interventions (NPIs) to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. If universities in low risk countries
can safely reopen without testing due to low introduction risk23 of COVID-19, they can
potentially save millions in testing costs. This prospect has not been explored in previous
literatures as most of them focus on very high risk countries where testing and screening are
required. To achieve our objective, we design an agent-based SEIR model of our campus and
simulate the daily routines and health states of 2,952 residential students during this selfquarantine period. We empirically validate our model by recreating two previous outbreaks in
university dormitories and comparing our simulation results against historic data. Assuming one
initially infected student, we track the modes of virus transmission on campus and test six NPIs
commonly used in schools24. The effectiveness and practicality of each NPI are discussed.

This study provides several contributions in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19
in universities. First, we propose an agent-based model to simulate virus transmission dynamics
in a university dormitory setting to identify the main avenues of infection. Second, we implement
six different NPIs at the individual level to assess their effectiveness. Third, we mathematically
simulate and validate the viability of the 14 days quarantine strategy adopted by schools around
the world. Finally, we suggest an optimal strategy for the reopening of universities in low risk
countries that maximizes students’ safety, convenience of living, and access to education.

To simulate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between residential students on our campus, we
propose an agent-based SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Removed) model. At the micro
level, each student is an agent capable of interaction and possess a health state of either “S”, “E”,
“I”, or “R”, which will change when they get infected. At the macro level, the total numbers of
students with “S”, “E”, “I”, and “R” are tallied, generating a stochastic compartmental model for
the entire school.

97

On campus, there are four dormitory buildings, two 17-story buildings each with two elevators
and two 26-story buildings each with three elevators. The ground floor (1st floor) is uninhabited
by students. Each floor above hosts 12 rooms, with a maximum occupancy of three students. In
total, 2,952 student agents are organized into these buildings. Moreover, there are two canteen
buildings with a total of 15 windows where students line up to purchase food.

Methods

Our model is constructed in NetLogo25 where all students arrive on day 1 from different
cities across the country and undergo 14 days of quarantine in their residences on campus.
During this time, students are restricted to their residences and canteens. We assume other people
on campus, such as faculty and staff do not have enough interactions with students to play a role
in the virus transmission during this period. In addition, there is no migration of any student in or
out of campus, except when taken to hospital for treatment. Each simulation starts with one

Every day during breakfast (7:00-9:00), lunch (11:00-13:00), and dinner (17:00-19:00), students
go to the window of their choices to purchase food for takeout as dine-in is not permitted. Since
university students are quite social, on each day, a percentage of all students will feel like
visiting their friends. Each student planning to visit travels to the room of a randomly chosen
student. We assume infections can only occur inside enclosed spaces in the canteens and
dormitories and cannot occur when students walk outside between different buildings. With the
current infrastructure setup, we identify six possible ways of infection, where τ represents
transmissibility (table 1).

Dormitory rooms are small, poorly circulated, and almost never cleaned, a perfect
environment for the virus to spread. Prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected individual in
this environment would most likely result in healthy students being infected. Therefore, we use
100% chance to represent guaranteed viral transmission between students in the same room.
Each time in a public area, an “I” student has a chance (τ) to infect their surrounding
environment; an “S” student has the same chance of getting infected from this environment, if
contaminated. We assume students would practice sufficient social distancing when walking in
their buildings or waiting in lines at the canteens. As a result, no direct transmission can occur in
public areas, except for in elevators, where it is impossible to maintain a safe distance. There are
other possible modes for SARS-CoV-2 to transmit, such as through fecal aerosol or airborne
transmission between flats in high-rise buildings26-28, however, they are not included in our
simulation.

At the micro level, the health state of each student is represented by either “S”, “E”, “I”,
or “R” (figure 1). We assume no immunity, asymptomatic patient, or death. When an “S” student
gets infected, they get assigned an incubation period, i, and duration of infection, d, randomly
generated according to table 2. All epidemiological parameters in our model are compiled from
previous literatures, except for τ and c, which are parameters specific for agent-based models,
that is, their values depend on model setup.

We estimate τ by plotting our stochastic model against the classic deterministic SEIR
model using parameters listed in table 2 and subject to model initial conditions. The three key
parameters for the SEIR model are β, α, and γ. A similar approached is adopted in33 for an SIR
model. τ is calibrated to be 0.82% (figure 2) and the model is validated by comparing simulated
outbreaks to previous outbreaks observed in universities (figure 3).

Figure 3. Empirical validation: simulating outbreaks in University of Washington fraternity houses (a, 10
runs) and University of Connecticut residence halls (b, 10 runs). According to reports from the University
of Washington, “as of June 30th, at least 38 students living in 10 fraternity houses have tested positive”34.
In total, there were about 1,000 residents in 25 fraternity houses and residents were asked to quarantine or
self-isolate. We assumed that full quarantine started on that day, that is, no more uninfected residents
could be infected, and used our model to simulate 1,000 students. Our results are plotted against observed
data from June 30th to Aug. 5th. A similar outbreak35-36 took place in University of Connecticut’s Storrs
campus where five residence halls containing 544 students went into full quarantine starting Nov. 11th. On
UConn’s COVID dashboard37, we compiled the daily number of new cases from 10 days before and 30
days after full quarantine and compared them to our simulated replication. Results suggest that our model
provide close estimations to real outbreaks in university residences.

The simulation starts with one initially infected student (N1 = 1), capable of infecting the entire
campus if not controlled. Fortunately, we identify six possible NPI strategies38 that could slow

Based on simulation data, our end results could be categorized into runs with outbreak and runs

quantify the risk of uncontained outbreak on campus.

This bipolar phenomenon and its associated threshold are explored further and

excluded from figures. Runs that do result in outbreak are averaged into one single timeseries
and their frequencies are indicated.

196

Figure 5 shows how many students are infected in each location for the baseline scenario.
Unsurprisingly, the largest contributor is roommate, accounting for over half the cases. This is
troubling because if the school wants to fully resume functionality, it is impossible for students
to not have roommates.

Figure 5. Mode of virus transmission in dormitory setting (baseline, 100 runs). Out of the six modes we
modeled, canteens and the hallways of each floor appear to be the safest. Canteens are large enough for
students to practice ample social distancing. And hallways see much less traffic than ground floors.

In figure 6a, when we increase the percentage of students wearing masks, we observed that the
speed of new infections begins to slow down, effectively flattening the curve. In addition, the
probability of outbreak also decreases accordingly. When mask usage reaches 75%, the curve
starts to linearize; at 100%, it has almost become a horizontal line, greatly slowing down the
transmission of COVID-19.

Figure 6b shows that regularly cleaning all public areas can prevent the spread of COVID-19
with great effectiveness. As a result, sanitizations should be thoroughly conducted as often as
possible, as manpower and euipment allow, although the effectiveness of each additional
cleaning seems be less and less. In real life, the effectiveness would be lower, since disinfectants
do not have a 100% potency like they do in our programming.

Results in figure 6c show that the more students visit each other, the fastert the infection spreads.
Risks are doubled for students who visit others in different building as they need to walk on
twice the number of hallways and take twice the elevator rides. When visiting is banned at 0%,
we see a drastic flattening of the curve. Students to keep visits to a minimum to protect
themselves, their friends, and their roommates. Our results are in accordance with those obtained
by Bouchnita and Jebrane41 when population movement was restricted by different levels.

Figure 6. Effects of different NPI strategies (100 runs for each parameter value). Mask adoption (a) and
not visiting friends (c) appear to be the most effective at preventing virus transmission on campus; they
directly reduce the risk of face-to-face transmission. Increasing cleaning frequency (b) is also effective,
however, its potency seems to decrease with each additional cleaning. Density in elevator (d) and density
in rooms (e) do not have a large impact flattening the curve. A possible explanation is that these NPIs
attempt to reduce the amount of people in the same area during certain time periods, however, the total
amount of susceptible students interacting in the system remains the same. A similar trend can be
observed for total population (f), where the shape of the curve (with percentage on the y-axis) is relatively
insensitive to population changes. This property also holds for deterministic ODE SEIR models.

233
234

Relaxing or tightening elevator allowance at the cost of possible safety or inconvenience,
respectively, has very little effect on the shape of the curves (figure 6d). On possible explanation
is that the elevator environment can be contaminated; regardless of how many people use
elevators at the same time, the total number of people who use elevators are constant, therefore,
the number of students at risk of being infected in an elevator remains the same despite
restrictions for simultaneous travel.

3.6 Density

239

Even though roommate is the #1 cause of infections in a dormitory, reducing the number of
roommates or allocating students into all single rooms did not slow down virus transmission by
much as evident in figure 6e. Even without roommates, students can still be infected in other
ways.

The curves in figure 6f remain very similar when we half or double the population. In other
words, the speed of new infections is directly proportional to the number of students on campus.
Further testing of other independent variables at different population levels results in very similar
curves and outbreak probabilities as those portrayed in earlier figures. Thus, we conclude that the
percentage of population infected overtime is relatively insensitive to changes in population,
with or without different interventions. The establishment of this linear relationship means our
model can be applied to other populations to predict the spread of COVID-19 with relatively
high accuracy.

3.8 Optimal Strategy

251
252

254

By combining different NPIs, the risk of COVID-19 transmission in residential students can be
drastically reduced. Table 4 summarizes each strategy’s effect on flattening the curve, effect on
outbreak probability, and ease to enforce. We also propose an optimal value for each NPI aimed
for the safest reopening of campus with 100% student capacity. The performance of this optimal
strategy (1000 runs) is compared with that of baseline in figure 7.

Figure 7. Comparison between baseline no NPI (mask adaptation = 0%, sanitization = 1 time a day, student
visiting friends = 5%, max. elevator allowance = 6) and optimal strategy (mask adaptation = 100%,
sanitization = 4 times a day, student visiting friends = 0%, max. elevator allowance = 4). In 1000 simulation
runs, only one run resulted in outbreak (> 30 infected students); even then, the outbreak size (32 infected)
was only slightly above the threshold and eventually contained. School can most likely start with no cases
if students properly adopt NPIs and self-quarantine for 14 days before instruction resumes.

270

With current assumptions, simulation results suggest that universities in low-risk countries can
fully reopen even without testing, based on three important premises: 1) all students arrive from
low-risk areas where community transmission is minimal, thus minimizing the introduction risk;
2) all students self-quarantine for 14 days on arrival; and 3) all students utilize proper NPIs. Any
one singular intervention on its own cannot fully prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, therefore,
multiple interventions need to be performed to an almost perfect extent, in order to contain this
disease. The importance of using a combination of interventions is reiterated by Ghaffarzadegan
et al42.

271
272
273
274
275
276
277
278

Even though NPIs are effective, when cases are detected on campus, it is imperative that
the administration take swift actions, such as isolating infected/potentially exposed students,
performing contact tracing, and mass testing students in order to halt the initial infection. This
aspect is not portrayed in our simulation where we simply let the virus run its course in order to
investigate its mode of transmission. The transmissibility τ is currently modeled as a constant
value of 0.82%. Future work could improve τ as a function of time and location to reflect viral
discharge and its potency decaying with time30 and represent possibly different levels of
transmissibility in different environments.

284

Another key input is the number of initially infected student, denoted as N1. It is
dependent on the country and region modeled and cannot be controlled; we can only estimate
how many students will arrive infected. Statistically, in a low risk country (our model) where the
incidence rate is less than 5 per 100,000 population13-14, N1 would most likely be zero. That is, all
students will mostly likely arrive healthy, undergo 14 days of self-quarantine, and start in-person
instruction with zero infections on campus. However, we included one initially infected student

(approx. 0.034% positivity rate) to model the worst case scenario. If other countries are modeled,
we would need to update and most like increase N1. For instance, in a university in Indiana, U.S.,
33 out of 11,836 (0.28%) students were COVID-19 positive on arrival. Results with N1 = 1
indicate that universities can safely open. Additional research in the future could increase N1 and
observe at which value does reopening without testing cease to be a practical and safe option.

To conclude, our model examines a type of university reopening strategy in low risk
countries and the transmission of SARA-CoV-2 between residential students on campus. These
two areas have not been explored much in previous literatures; however, successful
implementation of this strategy can not only safely reopen campus but also potentially save
millions of dollars in testing costs. We also selected six different NPIs commonly adopted in
school settings and tested how they can assist in the safe reopening of universities. Our results,
although based on model assumptions and simplifications, provide useful information for policy
makers and campus administrators in countries and areas still struggling with reopening
universities during COVID-19.

As with any model, there are certain limitations in our work. Students are programmed to
be 100% compliant to protocol; however, this is highly unlikely in real life. They might refuse or
forget to wear masks and attend unsanctioned gatherings with friends8. These actions will all
make them more vulnerable to infection and lead to possible outbreak. In addition, we only
modeled residential students and assumed no infection from campus staff, faculty, or outside
sources. When 14 days of self-quarantine ends, students are free to go outside. Even though
community infection in the city is almost non-existent, it would be interesting to model how the
virus propagates through classrooms, athletic events, and other activities when one student is
infected from outside or if a certain staff or faculty is infected. Lastly, we did not account for
asymptomatic carriers, whose prevalence and infectiousness remain unclear. Based on findings
from a number of literatures, the U.S. CDC estimates that 10%-70% of patients could be
asymptomatic, and their infectiousness can be anywhere between 25%-100% relative to
symptomatic patients43. When more epidemiological data are available, future studies could test
different prevalence and infectiousness values of asymptomatic patients and examine how they
impact the viral transmission in residential students and/or other community settings.
