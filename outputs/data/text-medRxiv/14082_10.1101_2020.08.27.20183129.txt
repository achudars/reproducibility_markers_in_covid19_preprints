ABSTRACT

15

COVID-19 took a heavy toll on older adults. In Belgium, by the end of August, 93% of deaths due to

16

COVID-19 were aged 65 or older. Similar trends were observed in other countries. As a consequence,

17

older adults were identified as a group at risk, and strict governmental restrictions were imposed on

18

them. This has caused concerns about their mental health. Using an online survey, this study

19

established the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adults aged 65 years or older, and which

20

factors moderate this impact. Participants reported a significant decrease in activity level, sleep

21

quality and wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Depression was strongly related to reported

22

declines in activity level, sleep quality, wellbeing and cognitive functioning. Our study shows that the

23

COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on the mental health of older adults. This implies that this

24

group at risk requires attention of governments and healthcare.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on an aging population

27

The COVID-19 pandemic took a heavy toll on older adults. For example in Belgium,

28

approximately 41% of the cases were aged 60 or older, but 93% of deaths due to COVID-19 were aged

29

65 or older (Sciensano, 2020). Similar trends were observed in other countries (e.g., Guterres, 2020).

30

This implied that older adults became a specific focus of several governmental COVID-19 regulations.

31

For example, in Belgium they were no longer allowed to look after their grandchildren, visitors and

32

external services (e.g., meal delivery, cleaning) were not allowed in assisted living facilities and nursing

33

homes for a long time, and people were regularly warned when measures were introduced or relaxed

34

to pay specific attention to older and vulnerable people.

35

Hence, during the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults were considered as a group at risk. As a

36

response, concerns have risen about the mental health of older adults. The World Health

37

Organization (WHO) has warned that the impact on mental and psychosocial wellbeing of vulnerable

38

groups, such as older adults, will be large and enduring (WHO, 2020). The United Nations (UN)

39

stressed that, although COVID-19 is in the first place a physical health crisis, it has the seeds of a

40

major mental health crisis as well, especially for specific populations such as older adults, if action is

41

not taken (UN, 2020). It has been suggested that the measures taken by governance regarding social

42

distancing and isolation, especially targeting groups at risk, can result in social isolation and

43

loneliness (Banerjee, 2020; Vahia, 2020). The latter variables are known to decrease wellbeing and

44

increase the risk for depression and cognitive dysfunction (Brooke & Jackson, 2020). Brooke &

45

Jackson (2020) pointed out that a decline in activity and mobility in older adults during lockdown can

46

also lead to more frailty and a lower wellbeing in older adults. Moreover, in response to stress, sleep

47

quality can decline and increase the risk for depression (Stanton et al., 2020). Finally, as older adults

48

already face cognitive decline as part of normal aging (Bherer, Erickson, & Liu-Ambrose, 2013;

49

Murman, 2015), which is moderated by several lifestyle variables such as physical activity,

50

engagement in stimulating activities and social network (e.g., Clare et al., 2017), the COVID-19

51

pandemic causing social isolation and loss of activity, might also impact cognitive functioning.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on an aging population

These concerns warrant a thorough assessment of how older adults are currently doing.

52
53

However, little is hitherto known about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the general

54

population of older adults. A few first studies are being published now, and seem to indicate that

55

older adults’ wellbeing was not severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as the

56

authors indicated, these studies were either conducted in the very early stages of the pandemic

57

when social distancing was recommended by the government but no lockdown was yet installed (Kivi

58

et al., in press; Lopez et al., in press) or in countries such as the Netherlands where at the time of the

59

study the lockdown was not restrictive (van Tilburg et al., in press). Findings of disaster studies might

60

be relevant in this respect. For example, studies on the effect of natural disasters on older adults

61

showed a disaster-related decline in cognitive function (Hikichi et al., 2016). Results on the effect on

62

wellbeing are mixed, and indicated that being older did not necessarily increase psychological

63

vulnerability (Rafiey et al., 2016; see also the “wellbeing paradox”; Hansen & Slagsvold, 2012).

64

However, socialising and social participation were found to be crucial to reduce the risk of cognitive

65

decline and decrease in wellbeing after such disasters (Hikichi et al., 2017), which is precisely what

66

has been severely limited during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for risk groups such as older

67

adults.

68

Given these concerns and the lack of studies focused on older adults during the peak of the

69

COVID-19 pandemic, the goal of this study was to establish how adults aged 65 years or older are

70

responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using self-report measures in an online survey, the impact of

71

the COVID-19 period on wellbeing, activity level, sleep quality and cognitive functioning was studied.

72

Based on the raised concerns and previous studies on the impact of disasters on older adults, we

73

hypothesised that the COVID-19 pandemic had a detrimental effect on the wellbeing, activity level,

74

sleep quality and cognitive functioning of older adults. Furthermore, we examined possible

75

vulnerability and protective factors that might have influenced the impact of the COVID-19 period on

76

the wellbeing and cognitive functioning of older adults.

Participant characteristics and Pearson correlations
Supplementary Table 1 provides a more detailed overview of the participant characteristics.

81

Participants were on average 73 years old (SD=6.99, range 65-97). Figure 1 displays the frequency

82

distribution of age. Two hundred sixty-two were male, 377 were female, and one identified

83

themselves with another gender. Geographically, participants were spread across Flanders (i.e., the

84

northern, Dutch-speaking part of Belgium), as can be seen on Figure 2. The majority of the

85

participants (81%) lived in their own home and 19% lived in an assisted living facility or nursing home

86

(jointly referred to as care facility). 28% lived alone, 54% with one cohabitant and 18% with two or

87

more cohabitants. Most participants (respectively 29%, 41%, 32% and 25%) reported that during the

88

past week they had 3 to 4 contacts (not taking into account cohabitants) in real life outside, no

89

contact in real life inside, 3 to 4 contacts by telephone and more than 9 contacts via the internet

90

(e.g., skype, whatsapp). Most participants (52%) had a university or high school degree and received

91

a monthly individual net income between 1001 and 1500 euro (25%), 1501 and 2000 euro (30%) or

92

2001 and 2500 euro (17%). The majority of participants (88%) did not suffer from Parkinson’s

93

disease, dementia, stroke, diabetes and/or epilepsy. Only 4% reported that they had been

94

contaminated with COVID-19. 15% reported that at least one of their close relatives or friends had

95

been contaminated with COVID-19.

96

The means (SD) of the total scores of the questionnaires and the Pearson correlations

97

between age and the total scores of the questionnaires in the survey can be found in Table 1 (see

98

also Supplementary Figure 1 for a matrix scatterplot containing all two-by-two scatter plots).

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on an aging population

104

With regards to wellbeing, the most prominent decreases were reported for general life

105

satisfaction, safety, community connectedness and future security (see Table 2). The subjective

106

wellbeing score indicated that the majority of the participants (76%) reported a decrease in

107

wellbeing in one or more domains. Half of the participants reported that their activity level had

108

decreased and 19% reported a decreased sleep quality during the COVID-19 period. A minority of the

109

participants (8%) reported that their cognitive functioning in general had decreased during the

110

COVID-19 period, with 8%, 12%, 6%, 10% and 10% indicating increases in problems with

111

remembering things, concentrating on something, doing two things at the same time, recalling things

112

or forgetfulness, respectively.

113

Paired-samples t-tests with Bonferroni correction (α=.0045) indicated that participants

114

reported that they had been significantly less active during the past week (i.e., during the COVID-19

115

period) compared to before the COVID-19 period (Mcurrent=6.65; Mbefore=7.58), t(639)=-14.69, p<.001,

116

d=.58. They also reported that their quality of sleep had been poorer during the past week compared

117

to before COVID-19 (Mcurrent=6.88 ; Mbefore=7.16), t(639)=-5.87, p<.001, d=.23. Furthermore, life

118

satisfaction in all seven domains, general life satisfaction and subjective wellbeing were significantly

119

lower currently compared to before COVID-19: t(639)=8.84, p<.001, d=.35 for standard of living

120

(Mcurrent=76; Mbefore=80), t(639)=7.75, p<.001, d=.31 for health (Mcurrent=73; Mbefore=76), t(639)=8.84,

121

p<.001, d=.35 for achieving in life (Mcurrent=75; Mbefore=78), t(638)=11.88, p<.001, d=.47 for

122

relationships (Mcurrent=71; Mbefore=79), t(639)=16.33, p<.001, d=.64 for safety (Mcurrent=70; Mbefore=81),

123

t(639)=15.57, p<.001, d=.61 for community connectedness (Mcurrent=66; Mbefore=77), t(639)=17.90,

124

p<.001, d=.71 for future security (Mcurrent=66; Mbefore=76), t(639)=15.88, p<.001, d=.63 for general life

125

satisfaction (Mcurrent=69; Mbefore=78) and t(639)=18.66, p<.001, d=.74 for the subjective wellbeing

126

index (Mcurrent=71; Mbefore=78). Note that when participants filled in the survey (i.e., week 1 to 5; see

127

also Supplementary Table 1) did not lead to significant systematic fluctuations with regards to the

128

reported changes in wellbeing, activity level, sleep quality and cognitive functioning.

Linear and ordinal logistic regression analyses
Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 report the Pearson correlations between the difference scores

132

and subjective cognitive change questions and potential continuous vulnerability and protective

133

variables, as well as the means (SD) for the difference scores and subjective cognitive change

134

questions for each level of the potential categorical vulnerability and protective variables. Linear and

135

ordinal logistic regression analyses were conducted to study possible vulnerability and protective

136

factors. Table 3 provides the model fit of all models and the statistics for the predictors who made a

137

significant contribution to the models. No problems of multicolinearity arose (all VIF<1.78).

138

Changes in wellbeing (α=.0055). With regards to general life satisfaction, the model indicated

139

that at least one predictor significantly contributed to explaining changes in this wellbeing item.

140

Changes in general life satisfaction showed a significant negative linear relation with depression. This

141

implies that an increase in depression was associated with a (stronger) decrease in satisfaction with

142

standard of living during the COVID-19 period. Changes in general life satisfaction also showed a

143

significant negative linear relation with resilience. However, as this association is contrary to the

144

positive correlation coefficient observed between these two variables (r=.11, see Supplementary

145

Table 2), this could rather indicate a suppressor situation (see Darlington, 1968; Paulhus, Robins,

146

Trzesniewski, & Tracy, 2004), leading us to be cautious about this effect. With regards to satisfaction

147

with standard of living, the model indicated that at least one predictor significantly contributed to

148

explaining changes in this wellbeing item. Changes in satisfaction with standard of living showed a

149

significant negative linear relation with both depression and whether the participant lived in a care

150

facility or not. This implies that an increase in depression and living in a care facility as compared to

151

not living in a care facility (as “not living in a care facility” was set as the reference category of our

152

dummy variable) were associated with a (stronger) decrease in satisfaction with standard of living

153

during the COVID-19 period. For all other PWI-A items and total score, models always indicated that

154

at least one predictor significantly contributed to explaining changes in these items or total score. For

155

all these models, there was only a significant negative linear relation between depression and

156

changes in these wellbeing items and total score. This implies that an increase in depression was

157

associated with a decrease in satisfaction with all domains and in subjective wellbeing during COVID-

158

19. None of the other predictors contributed significantly to the models (all p>.007).

159

Changes in activity and sleep (α=.025). The model indicated that at least one predictor

160

significantly contributed to explaining changes in activity level. There was a significant negative linear

161

relation between depression and changes in activity. This implies that an increase in depression was

162

associated with a decrease in activity level during the COVID-19 period. None of the other predictors

163

contributed significantly to the model (all p≥.12). With regards to sleep quality, the model indicated

164

that at least one predictor significantly contributed to explaining changes in sleep quality. There was

165

a significant negative linear relation between depression and changes in sleep quality and a positive

166

relation between gender and changes in sleep quality. This implies that an increase in depression and

167

being male as compared to female (as “male” was set as the reference category of our dummy

168

variable) were associated with a (stronger) decrease in sleep quality during COVID-19. None of the

169

other predictors contributed significantly to the model (all p>.12).

170

Changes in cognitive functioning. For all six subjective cognitive change questions, the ordinal

171

logistic models had a significantly better fit compared to the null model. In all models, two predictors

172

always contributed significantly to explaining the changes in cognitive functioning. When depression

173

increased with 1 unit, the ordered log-odds of being in a higher category of the response scale of the

174

subjective cognitive change questions (with a higher category indicating fewer problems, see

175

Methods section) decreased by 0.28 for general cognitive functioning and by 0.24, 0.24, 0.20, 0.14

176

and 0.22 for remembering, concentration, doing two things at the same time, recalling and

177

forgetfulness, respectively, while the other variables in the model are held constant. When the

178

susceptibility to cognitive failures (i.e., CFQ total score) increased with 1 unit, the ordered log-odds of

179

being in a higher category of the response scale of the subjective cognitive change questions

180

decreased by 0.061 for general cognitive functioning and by 0.076, 0.049, 0.048, 0.061 and 0.065 for

181

remembering, concentration, doing two things at the same time, recalling and forgetfulness, while

184

We note that including the four variables describing the number of contacts participants had

185

had during the past week (see Supplementary Table 1) as additional predictors in the models, did not

186

lead to significant effects (all p≥.045) and did not change the pattern of results, except that the

187

association between resilience and changes in general life satisfaction was no longer significant with

188

the set α (p=.008). For reasons of parsimony we therefore opted not to include these additional

DISCUSSION
The COVID-19 pandemic had an enormous impact on older adults aged 65 years or older. The

193

risk of social isolation and loneliness due to governmental regulations raises concerns about the

194

mental health and cognitive functioning of this population. Based on recent editorials about the

195

impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults and literature on the impact of disasters, we

196

hypothesised that wellbeing, level of activity, quality of sleep and cognitive functioning would be

197

severely impacted. To address this, we assessed how older adults are currently doing. Using an

198

online survey with self-report measures, we studied the impact of the COVID-19 period on wellbeing,

199

level of activity, quality of sleep and cognitive functioning of a general population of older adults

200

aged 65 years or older. In addition, vulnerability and protective factors were examined that might

201

have influenced the impact of the COVID-19 period.

202

In line with our hypothesis, it became clear that the COVID-19 period had a significant impact

203

on older adults. We observed a significant decrease in wellbeing, activity level and sleep quality

204

during the COVID-19 period as compared to before COVID-19. This is not in line with the first studies

205

being published on how older adults responded to the pandemic, which did not observe a severe

206

impact on older adults’ wellbeing (Kivi et al., in press; Lopez et al., in press; van Tilburg et al., in

207

press). But as these studies were completed during the early onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, this

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on an aging population

208

might highlight that the severity of the impact increased when the pandemic (and the imposed

209

restrictions) further progressed. Most older adults indicated that their cognitive functioning had not

210

changed during the COVID-19 period, although a subgroup of 8% indicated a decrease.

211

When examining possible vulnerability and protective factors, reported changes in wellbeing,

212

activity level, sleep quality and cognitive functioning were especially related to depression. These

213

findings suggest that depression might be a vulnerability factor that influenced the impact of the

214

COVID-19 period on older adults. However, given the cross-sectional nature of our data, it is not clear

215

if depression was a precursor, already present before the COVID-19 period, or if depression was

216

triggered and/or intensified during the COVID-19 period. Previous studies showed that depression in

217

itself is negatively correlated with wellbeing, activity and sleep (Maglione et al., 2012; Malone &

218

Wachholtz, 2017; Roshanaei-Moghaddam, Katon, & Russo, 2009). However, the socioemotional

219

selectivity theory (Carstensen, 1995) could also explain why depression increased as a consequence

220

of the COVID-19 period. This theory proposes that older adults use their social network as a buffer

221

against negative experiences (Swift et al., 2014). As the COVID-19 pandemic led to a decrease of

222

older adults’ social network and contacts, this emotional buffer might have disappeared, which in

223

turn could have paved the way for depression. In order to shed more light on the exact role of

224

depression in the observed COVID-19 changes, we aim to longitudinally follow a substantial

225

subsample of these older adults to study how their reported changes in wellbeing, activity level,

226

sleep quality and cognitive functioning, and the role of depression therein, evolve with the

227

fluctuating COVID-19 situation over time.

228

Next to depression, other variables such as living in a care facility or not and gender were

229

related to changes in one specific domain of wellbeing and sleep quality, respectively. Susceptibility

230

to cognitive failures was related to changes in cognitive functioning during the COVID-19 period.

231

Some limitations of this study need to be addressed. First of all, the sample of older adults in

232

this study is rather homogenous in some respects. Participants were all Dutch-speaking older adults

233

living in Flanders. Moreover, most were in good health and their socioeconomic status was high, as

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on an aging population

234

indexed by educational level and income. Therefore, the results of this study might be difficult to

235

generalise to the whole population of older adults and additional studies in different countries, and

236

more heterogeneous samples of older adults are needed. Moreover, since this study was

237

administered online, a part of this older adult population could probably not be reached. Third, the

238

design of this study was cross-sectional and administered during the COVID-19 period. Questions

239

regarding the period before COVID-19 were therefore necessarily retrospective, which might lead to

240

biased self-reports (Sato & Kawahara, 2011). In addition, this study relied on subjective self-report

241

which can differ from objective states (e.g. Burmester, Leathem, & Merrick, 2016). For example, it

242

has already been shown that cognitive ability tends to be overestimated with increasing age (van der

243

Ham, van der Kuil, & Claessen, 2019). During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, experimental studies

244

administered to a sample of older adults repeatedly over time (e.g., when the pandemic activity

245

decreases or flares up again in new waves) could shed more light on the actual effect of the COVID-

246

19 period on cognitive functioning.

247

To summarize, the COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on the wellbeing, activity level

248

and sleep quality of older adults. Only a small group of participants reported a decline in cognitive

249

functioning. All changes reported during the COVID-19 period were strongly related to depression.

250

Findings of this study are important because they give a first, thorough assessment of the mental

251

health of older adults during this COVID-19 pandemic. This study showed that the concerns raised

252

about the wellbeing of older adults are justified, and that this group at risk requires the attention of

253

governments and healthcare. Furthermore, this study exposed that when we are faced with extreme

254

stressors, such as COVID-19, in the future, prevention and intervention strategies are needed to aid

255

older adults to prepare for and cope with them, especially for those at risk of depression (see also

256

suggestions by Armitage & Nellums, 2020; Tian et al., 2020). As COVID-19 has complicated the

257

accessibility of this population through social distancing, nursing home restrictions, and an

258

overwhelmed health system, we are urged to explore novel ways to reach older adults (Chong,

259

Curran, Ames, Lautenschlager, & Castle, 2020).

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on an aging population

METHODS

260
261
262

Participants
Participants were recruited through social media, radio news, targeted newsletters and

263

discussion fora and electronic mailings to all directors of assisted living facilities and nursing homes in

264

Flanders. Only adults aged 65 years or older with a thorough knowledge of Dutch and living in

265

Belgium could participate in the study. Only data of participants who filled in at least 50% of the

266

survey were retained for analysis to ensure sufficient data quality. If a participant completed the

267

survey more than once (N= 5), only the most complete, or, in case all entries were equally complete,

268

the first entry was retained for analyses. In total, 640 participants meeting these criteria took part in

269

the survey study.

270

We have complied with all relevant ethical regulations. All participants provided written

271

informed consent. This study was approved by the Social and Societal Ethics Committee (SMEC) from

272

KU Leuven (G-2020-1987). For their participation, participants could win one of 16 gift certificates via

273

a random draft.

274
275
276

Material
The online survey was created and data were generated using Qualtrics software (Qualtrics,

277

Provo, UT). The language of the survey was Dutch. The survey existed of several general and

278

demographic questions and questionnaires.

279

General and demographic questions. We asked participants several general questions

280

assessing their year of birth, gender, country of residence, nationality, postal code, living situation,

281

educational level, current and previous work situation, monthly individual net income, age-related

282

diseases and whether the participant and/or any of their close relatives or friends had been infected

283

with the corona virus.

284
285

Subjective cognitive functioning. To assess subjective cognitive functioning, the Dutch version
of the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ; Broadbent, Cooper, Fitzgerald, & Parkes, 1982;

11

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on an aging population

286

Merckelbach, Muris, Nijman, & de Jong, 1996) was used. The CFQ exists of 25 items assessing self-

287

reported frequency of failures in several cognitive domains (e.g., perception, attention, memory and

288

action). In our study, participants indicated how often these failures occurred during the past month

289

(i.e., during the COVID-19 period) on a 5-point scale ranging from “very often” (=4) to “never” (=0).

290

We added a response option “not applicable”, since some situations described in the questionnaire

291

might not have occurred during the COVID-19 period for some participants (e.g., “Do you fail to see

292

what you want in a supermarket (although it’s there)?”). A total score across all items, varying

293

between 0 and 100, provides a measure of the general susceptibility to cognitive failures with a

294

higher score indicating a higher susceptibility. The “not applicable” scores were not included to

295

calculate the total score. For participants who indicated “not applicable” on more than 50% of the

296

items (N=15), no CFQ total score was computed. The Dutch version of the CFQ has been validated

297

across the adult life span, including older adults (Rast, Zimprich, Van Boxtel, & Jolles, 2009). The

298

internal consistency of the CFQ in the current study was high with Cronbach’s α=.92.

299

Subjective cognitive change. Additionally, we assessed whether participants felt that their

300

general cognitive functioning had changed during the COVID-19 period using a 3-point scale: Yes, it

301

has decreased (=1); No, it has not changed (=2); Yes, it has improved (=3). We also asked them

302

whether they had experienced the following cognitive problems during the COVID-19 period:

303

problems to remember things, to concentrate on something, to do two things at the same time, to

304

recall things and forgetfulness. They indicated the frequency of these problems in comparison to the

305

period before the COVID-19 period on a 5-point scale with labels “a lot more than before” (=1),

306

“more than before” (=2), “not more or less than before” (=3), “less than before” (=4), “a lot less than

307

before” (=5). The internal consistency of these six subjective cognitive change questions was high

308

with Cronbach’s α=.86.

309

Depression. To assess self-reported depression, the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15;

310

Sheikh & Yesavage, 1986; Bleeker, Frohn de Winter, & Cornelissen, 1985) was used. This scale exists

311

of 15 Yes/No items and is designed to assess depressive symptoms in older populations. Using a

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on an aging population

312

score key, each item receives a score of 0 or 1 and these scores are then summed leading to a total

313

score between 0 and 15, with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms. The psychometric

314

qualities of the GDS-15 have been supported by numerous studies, also in Dutch older populations

315

(e.g., de Craen, Heeren, & Gussekloo, 2003). The internal consistency of the GDS-15 in the current

316

study was high with Cronbach’s α=.81.

317

Activity and sleep. Participants were asked to evaluate their activity level and quality of sleep

318

both before the COVID-19 period (retrospectively), and during the past week (i.e., during the COVID-

319

19 period). These four questions were answered on an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (i.e., “not active

320

at all” and “very poor quality of sleep” respectively) to 10 (i.e., “extremely active” and “very good

321

quality of sleep” respectively).

322

Wellbeing. Wellbeing was assessed using the Dutch version of the Personal Wellbeing Index –

323

Adults (PWI-A; International Wellbeing Group, 2013; Van Beuningen & de Jonge, 2011). The PWI-A is

324

a multidimensional scale measuring life satisfaction in seven different domains (standard of living,

325

health, achieving in life, relationships, safety, community connectedness and future security). An

326

additional item assessing general life satisfaction can also be administered. All eight items are scored

327

on an 11-point scale ranging from “no satisfaction at all” (=0) to “completely satisfied” (=10). The raw

328

scores are converted to a 0-100 scale, with higher scores indicating more satisfaction. The scores for

329

each domain can be studied individually, and the seven domain items (excluding the general life

330

satisfaction item) can be summed to provide an index of “subjective wellbeing”. The psychometric

331

properties of the PWI-A have been reported as satisfactory for older adults (Forjaz et al., 2011) and

332

for a Dutch sample (Van Beuningen & de Jonge, 2011). In the current study, participants filled in the

333

PWI-A twice: they indicated their satisfaction for each domain once (retrospectively) for the period

334

before COVID-19 and once for the past month (i.e., during the COVID-19 period). The internal

335

consistency in the current study was high for the PWI-A total score (i.e., 7 items) relating to the pre-

336

COVID-19 period (Cronbach’s α=.91) and to the past month (Cronbach’s α=.91).

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on an aging population

337

Social network. The Lubben Social Network Scale-6 (LSNS-6; Lubben et al., 2006), specifically

338

constructed for older adults, was used to assess social network, support and isolation. It consists of

339

six items: three items evaluating family ties and three comparable items evaluating non-family ties.

340

These items are scored on a 6-point scale where participants indicate the number of ties (i.e., 0, 1, 2,

341

3 or 4, 5 to 8, 9 or more). A sum score can be calculated, ranging between 0 and 30, with a higher

342

score indicating more social engagement. The psychometric properties of the LSNS-6 are good

343

(Lubben et al., 2006), although we were unable to obtain data for the Dutch version specifically. The

344

internal consistency of the LSNS-6 in the current study was high with Cronbach’s α=.82. Next to the

345

LSNS-6, we also asked participants how many contacts they had (not taking into account cohabitants)

346

during the past week in real life outside, in real life inside, by telephone and via the internet (e.g.,

347

skype, whatsapp), using the same response scale of the LSNS-6.

348

Resilience. Resilience, or the ability to bounce back or recover from stress, was assessed

349

using the Dutch version of the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS; Smith et al.; 2008; Soer, Bieleman, &

350

Schreurs, 2019). The BRS exists of six items measuring the degree of individual resilience. The items

351

are scored on a 5-point scale ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”. After reversing

352

items 2, 4 and 6, a mean score is calculated which ranges between 1 and 5, with a higher score

353

indicating more resilience. The validity of the BRS has been confirmed in older adults (da Silva-Sauer

354

et al., 2020) and for the Dutch version (Soer et al., 2019). The internal consistency of the BRS in the

355

current study was high with Cronbach’s α=.81.

356
357
358

Procedure
The survey existed of a first page providing participants with information about the study

359

and an informed consent form. After participants had read the instructions and informed consent,

360

they were asked to explicitly check a box if they agreed to participate and to confirm that they were

361

65 years or older.

362

Afterwards, participants first completed the general and demographics questions. Next, the

363

questionnaires were administered in the following order: CFQ, subjective cognitive change questions,

364

GDS-15, questions regarding activity level and sleep quality, PWI-A, additional social network

365

question, LSNS-6 and BRS. Finally, participants could provide their contact details to contact them for

366

follow-up surveys or in case they had won a gift certificate. After completing the survey, we provided

367

participants with web links and a telephone number where they could obtain more information

368

about COVID-19 and psychological care if needed. The median number of minutes it took

369

participants to complete the survey was 20. The survey was launched on May 19 2020 and closed on

370

June 22 2020.

371
372
373

Statistical analyses
First, we summarized the participant characteristics and the Pearson correlations between

374

the main constructs. We considered correlations as small, medium or strong when the correlation

375

coefficient was below .30, between .30 and .50 and above .50, respectively (based on Cohen, 1988).

376

Second, we compared participants’ report of their current wellbeing, activity level, sleep

377

quality and cognitive functioning (i.e., during the COVID-19 period) with their retrospective report of

378

these variables before COVID-19. We calculated difference scores between the reports during and

379

before the COVID-19 period for activity level, sleep quality and the PWI-A items and total score (i.e.,

380

reportduring – reportbefore, where negative scores indicate a decrease in the report during the COVID-19

381

period compared to before). From now on, we will refer to these as the difference scores. We

382

reported the descriptive statistics for the difference scores and the subjective cognitive change

383

questions. Furthermore, we conducted two-sided paired-samples t-tests with Bonferroni correction

384

to compare the reports during and before the COVID-19 period. As 11 comparisons were conducted

385

(i.e., for the eight PWI-A items and total score, activity level and sleep quality). Cohen’s d (calculated

386

as the difference between the means divided by the standard deviation) were reported. We

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on an aging population

387

considered effect sizes as small, medium or strong when the Cohen’s d was around .20, .50 and .80,

388

respectively (based on Cohen, 1988).

389

Finally, we conducted linear or ordinal logistic regression analyses to determine the

390

contribution of potential vulnerability and protective factors, in explaining changes in wellbeing,

391

activity level and sleep quality (i.e., the 11 difference scores) and cognitive functioning (i.e., the six

392

subjective cognitive change questions). This led to a total of 17 dependent variables and hence 17

393

separate regression analyses. These analyses were grouped in three parts focused on changes in

394

wellbeing (i.e., nine analyses), changes in activity and sleep (two analyses) and changes in cognitive

395

functioning (i.e., six analyses). Bonferroni correction was applied for each group of analyses, leading

396

to α being set at .0055 for wellbeing, .025 for activity and sleep and.0083 for cognitive functioning.

397

For changes in wellbeing, activity level and sleep quality, linear regression analyses were performed.

398

Given the ordinal nature of the subjective cognitive change questions, we conducted ordinal linear

399

regression analyses for changes in cognitive functioning. The following variables were included in

400

each regression analysis as predictors: gender, age, whether the participant lived alone or not

401

(derived based on the reported number of cohabitants, see Supplementary Table 1), whether the

402

participant lived in a care facility or not (derived based on the reported living situation, see

403

Supplementary Table 1), the reported monthly individual net income (to index socio-economic

404

status), depression (i.e., GDS-15 total score), social network (i.e., LSNS-6 total score), general

405

susceptibility to cognitive failures (i.e., CFQ total score) and resilience (i.e. BRS total score).

406

Categorical predictors were dummy recoded. The presence of multicolinearity was examined using a

407

cut-off of <5 for the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF; Sheather, 2009).

Statistical results of the 17 linear and ordinal logistic regression analyses conducted for changes in wellbeing, activity level and sleep quality (all based on the
calculated difference scores) and cognitive functioning (based on the subjective cognitive change questions) with gender, age, whether the participant lived
alone or not, whether the participant lived in a care facility or not, monthly individual net income, depression (i.e., GDS-15 total score), social network (i.e.,
LSNS-6 total score), general susceptibility to cognitive failures (i.e., CFQ total score) and resilience (i.e. BRS total score) as predictors. Both the fit of the full
model (Model fit) and the test statistics for the significant predictors are reported.
