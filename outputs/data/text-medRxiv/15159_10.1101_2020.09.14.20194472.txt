Abstract

32

Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) may be useful for informing public health response to

33

viral diseases like COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. We quantified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in

34

wastewater influent and primary settled solids in two wastewater treatment plants to inform the

35

pre-analytical and analytical approaches, and to assess whether influent or solids harbored

36

more viral targets. The primary settled solids samples resulted in higher SARS-CoV-2 detection

37

frequencies than the corresponding influent samples. Likewise, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was more

38

readily detected in solids using one-step digital droplet (dd)RT-PCR than with two-step RT-

39

QPCR and two-step ddRT-PCR, likely owing to reduced inhibition with the one-step ddRT-PCR

40

assay. We subsequently analyzed a longitudinal time series of 89 settled solids samples from a

41

single plant for SARS-CoV-2 RNA as well as coronavirus recovery (bovine coronavirus) and

42

fecal strength (pepper mild mottle virus, PMMoV) controls. SARS-CoV-2 RNA targets N1 and

43

N2 concentrations correlate positively and significantly with COVID-19 clinical confirmed case

44

counts in the sewershed. Together, the results demonstrate that measuring SARS-CoV-2 RNA

45

concentrations in settled solids may be a more sensitive approach than measuring SARs-CoV-2

46

in influent.

Introduction

49
50

Municipal wastewater is a composite biological sample of an entire community with each

51

member of the community inputting biological specimens to the wastewater every day. It is

52

therefore no surprise that wastewater has been tapped as an epidemiological tool to gauge

53

aspects of public health, such as narcotics usage 1,2, the reemergence of poliovirus 3,4, and

54

infection rates of viral 5,6 and bacterial7,8 diseases. COVID-19 has accelerated the interest in

55

wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) due to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 genes are detected in

56

the feces of many infected individuals9–11. More established epidemiological tools used to track

57

cases in a community have been hindered during the COVID-19 pandemic by diagnostic kit

58

shortages12, asymptomatic or mild cases that do not encounter the medical system or delay

59

seeking medical attention13, and the lag times between testing and reporting14. As a result,

60

public health officials and administrators have had to make critical decisions about opening or

61

closing communities with limited surveillance data. Scientists, engineers, public officials, as well

62

as the general public, are optimistic that WBE could provide additional data on COVID-19

63

infections in a community. In fact, the United States Center for Disease Control has established

64

the National Wastewater Surveillance System as a framework for using WBE to inform the

65

response to the COVID-19 pandemic 15.

66
67

Recent published studies have reported SARS-CoV-2 detection and quantification in sewage16–

68

18

69

are moving to implement WBE. It remains to be seen how the data generated from wastewater

70

surveillance should be interpreted or will ultimately be used to make public health decisions.

71

Potential uses include informing on the presence or absence of COVID-19 in a community,

72

similar to polio surveillance 4; tracking trends over time to project infection trajectory in the

73

coming days17; or even using the SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater to estimate

. Based on these reports, numerous entities/organizations across the globe and across scales

74

prevalence in a community19. The latter application requires a clear understanding of fecal

75

shedding dynamics over the course of the illness, which is not yet established.

76
77

Many early studies on SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater have focused on wastewater influent. When

78

detected in influent, viral particles are first concentrated with either a filtration method18 or an

79

organic flocculation method20 and then the SARS-CoV-2 genome is targeted with a PCR-based

80

method. In an earlier study, enveloped viruses mouse coronavirus murine hepatitis virus MHV

81

and bacteriophage Phi6 partition to a greater extent to wastewater solids in wastewater influent

82

than nonenveloped bacteriophages MS2 and T321. The partition coefficients from that study

83

were 1500, 1200, and 270 ml/g for MHV, Phi6, and MS2. These results suggest that wastewater

84

solids may contain coronaviruses at concentrations 1000 times those found in influent, on a per

85

mass basis, and that monitoring solids could lead to more sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-222.

86

Indeed, human coronaviruses HKU1 and 229E were previously detected in residual biosolids

87

with metagenomic sequencing23.

88
89

In this study, we compared SARS-CoV-2 concentrations recovered from paired wastewater

90

influent and primary settled solids collected at two different wastewater treatment plants

91

collected on 5-7 days during a rising limb of the outbreak using different analytical methods.

92

Subsequently, we applied refined methods to near daily samples of primary settled solids at a

93

wastewater treatment plant over 89 days to investigate how SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in

94

solids tracked COVID-19 cases in the sewershed. In addition to quantifying two SARS-CoV-2

95

RNA targets (N1 and N2), we quantified coronavirus recovery and wastewater fecal strength in

96

every sample using bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and pepper mild mottled virus (PMMoV),

97

respectively. Although the work focuses on a single pandemic virus, the results will be relevant

98

for a wide suite of viral targets that have an affinity for solids.

Methods and Materials

101
102

Sample collection and storage. Influent and primary settled solids were collected from two

103

publicly owned treatment works (POTWs), hereafter referred to as POTW A (Palo Alto Regional

104

Water Quality Control Plant) and POTW B (San José-Santa Clara Regional Wastewater

105

Facility), both located in Santa Clara County, California, USA. POTW A and B serve populations

106

of 0.2 million and 1.5 million, respectively with permitted flows of 39 and 167 million gallons per

107

day. POTW B adds FeCl3 to its waste stream (10 mg/l) prior to the headworks for odor control.

108

The residence time of sludge in the primary clarifier is estimated to be between 2-14 hours for

109

POTW A and 1-2 hours for POTW B.

110
111

From both plants, 50 ml of influent was collected at the headworks as 24-hour flow-weighted

112

composite samples and 50 ml of solids samples were collected from the primary settling tank.

113

Grab solids samples were collected from POTW A and 24-hour composite samples from POTW

114

B. Samples were collected in 10% HCl acid-washed plastic containers. Storage conditions are

115

described in the Supporting Information (SI).

116
117

Paired influent and solids samples were collected at both POTWs on the following dates: 22

118

March, 25 March, 29 March, 1 April, and 15 April 2020. Additional dates were included for

119

POTW B (23 March and 30 March) (Table 1). Dates were chosen to span a high prevalence

120

period in the initial phase of the pandemic. These samples are hereafter referred to as “method

121

evaluation samples”.

122
123

A longitudinal collection of primary settled solids was obtained from POTW B. Eighty-nine

124

samples were collected daily from March 16 to May 31, and three times a week from June 2 to

July 12, using the same collection techniques as the method evaluation samples. Hereafter,

126

these are referred to as “longitudinal samples”.

127
128

Influent pre-analytical processing. Immediately prior to analysis, influent samples were

129

transferred to 4°C until thawed (range: 12-48 hours). Between 43 and 45 mL of influent was

130

centrifuged at 24,000xg for 15 minutes at 4°C to pellet solids. 40 to 42 mL of the resultant

131

clarified supernatant was decanted and viruses were concentrated from the supernatant using a

132

PEG precipitation method21. This method was selected after preliminary head-to-head testing of

133

PEG precipitation and centrifugal ultrafiltration to concentrate viruses from influent yielded

134

comparable recovery results for N1 and N2 (Figure S1), and because we anticipated there

135

would be fewer pandemic-related supply chain issues with the PEG method. MHV strain A59

136

and PMMoV were used as an exogenous and endogenous recovery controls, respectively.

137

PMMoV also served as a fecal-strength control. An attenuated vaccine strain of bovine

138

coronavirus (BCoV) was used as a nucleic-acid extraction positive control; it was spiked into the

139

viral concentrate before it was subjected to nucleic-acid extraction using the Qiagen AllPrep

140

PowerViral DNA/RNA kit and further purification using Zymo OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal

141

Columns (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). Further details are in the SI.

142
143

Solids pre-analytical processing. Immediately prior to analysis, solid samples were transferred

144

to 4°C until thawed (range: 12-48 hours). Thawed solids samples (35-53 ml) were centrifuged at

145

24,000xg at 4°C for 30 minutes, and the supernatant was decanted. Percent solids was

146

measured for concentrated solid samples by placing sample aliquots in pre-weighed aluminum

147

weigh dishes and weighing the sample before and after drying at 105°C for 24 hours.

148
149

The method evaluation solids samples were divided to test two different extraction processes:

150

for the first, 0.2-0.4 g of sample was aliquoted for extraction with the Qiagen AllPrep

151

PowerFecal DNA/RNA kit (“powerfecal” kit), and for the second, 1.8-2.8 g of sample was

152

aliquoted for extraction with the RNeasy PowerSoil Total RNA Kit (“RNeasy” kit). Aliquots were

153

spiked with BCoV as an extraction recovery control. Two biological replicates were completed

154

per sample (2 powerfecal and 2 RNeasy extractions per POTW per time point). Nucleic-acids

155

were further purified using the Zymo OneStep PCR Inhibitor Removal Columns (Zymo

156

Research, Irvine, CA). Further details are in the SI.

157
158

For the longitudinal solids samples, RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit and purified with

159

the Zymo inhibitor removal kit using the same protocol described above with two modifications

160

24

161

positive pressure was used per manufacturer’s instructions to aid flow through columns. 7 of the

162

89 samples were extracted in duplicate and extraction blanks were run with each sample batch.

Samples were randomized and blinded to laboratory technicians prior to analysis.

; (1) after step 9 in the kit’s instructions, samples were stored overnight at -20°C, and (2)

164
165

RT-QPCR. For method evaluation samples, PMMoV, MHV, BCoV, SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2

166

were quantified using two-step RT-QPCR. Preliminary experiments suggested that the RT step

167

was inhibited, so dilutions of the extract were used as template for the RT step (see SI for

168

details). For influent, undiluted and 1:10 diluted RNA was used as template; for solids,

169

undiluted, 1:10, and 1:50 diluted RNA were used as template. Each template was run in

170

triplicate, and triplicate reactions were pooled prior to QPCR.

171
172

Resultant cDNA was used as template in QPCR assays targeting PMMoV, MHV, BCoV, SARS-

173

CoV-2 N1 and N2 (primers and probes in Table S1) using an ABI Step-One Plus Instrument

174

(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). All templates were run in duplicate. Standard curves

175

were run in duplicate on each plate using cDNA at concentrations from 3 to 3 x 105 copies /

176

reaction; duplicate NTCs were included on each plate. Detailed methods for generation of cDNA

177

standards are in the SI. Concentrations per reaction were converted to copies per volume of

178

influent or per g dry solids weight using dimensional analysis. Samples were considered “below

179

the limit of quantification” (BLOQ) if the Cq value of the sample was higher than the Cq value of

180

the lowest cDNA standard, but less than 40, or if the targets in both technical replicates did not

181

amplify within 40 cycles. Concentrations of unknown samples were calculated using plate-

182

specific standard curves. Additional details are in the SI25.

183
184

ddPCR. RNA from the method evaluation samples was used as template in one-step digital

185

droplet (dd)RT-PCR for N1 and N2 SARS-CoV-2 targets using BioRad SARS-CoV-2 Droplet

186

Digital PCR kits (cat.no.: 12013743; Hercules, CA) and a BioRad QX200 AutoDG Droplet Digital

187

PCR system. Technical duplicates were run (2 wells); wells were merged for data analysis. In

188

order to test for inhibition, each template was run at two dilutions: undiluted and 1:10 dilution. A

189

positive control consisting of SARS-CoV-2 RNA isolated from a nasopharynx swab of a high-

190

titer patient from Stanford Hospital and NTCs were run on each plate in duplicate. QuantaSoft

191

and QuantaSoft Analysis Pro (BioRad) were used to manually threshold and export the data.

192

The required number of droplets for a sample with merged duplicate wells was at least 10,000.

193

In order for a sample to be scored as positive, 3 or more positive droplets were required in the

194

merged wells. Concentrations per reaction were converted to copies per volume of influent or

195

per g dry weight using dimensional analysis.

196
197

A two-step ddRT-PCR assay for N1 was also trialed using a subset of the method evaluation

198

samples. RNA was stored at -80°c for up to 5 days between running the one-step and two-step

199

assays, to minimize the potential for RNA degradation during storage (see SI).

200
201

For the longitudinal samples, one-step ddRT-PCR duplex assay for N1 and N2 and a duplex

202

assay for PMMoV and BCoV26 were used. N1 and N2 were quantified in undiluted and 1:10

diluted template; BCoV and PMMoV were quantified in 1:10 and 1:1000 diluted template. The

204

N1/N2 duplex assay was conducted in triplicate wells and the BCoV/PMMoV duplex assay was

205

conducted in duplicate wells. The replicate wells were merged for data analysis. Positive N1/N2

206

and negative controls, and threshold setting for the longitudinal samples were conducted as

207

described for the method evaluation samples. Positive controls for BCoV and PMMoV were a

208

direct extraction of reconstituted BCoV vaccine diluted to 106 cp/mL and for PMMoV a synthetic

209

DNA ultramer. In addition, a pooled matrix control was run on every N1/N2 duplex assay plate.

210

This was created by adding equal-volume aliquots of each sample on the plate to one tube and

211

spiking this pooled matrix with clinical SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Additional details of dd-RTPCR27 can

212

be found in the SI and Table S7.

214

COVID-19 epidemiology data. The number of new clinically confirmed COVID-19 cases within

215

the sewershed of POTW B were obtained using geo-referenced case data and POTW-provided

216

shape file of their service area in ARC-GIS. The date stamp is that of specimen collection. As

217

data were handled and provided by the county, no IRB approval was needed.

218
219

Statistics. Statistics were computed using Microsoft Excel and Rstudio (version 1.1.463). Paired

220

and unpaired t-tests were used to compare groups after confirming data were normally

221

distributed. For calculating recoveries, and making numerical comparisons across samples

222

using the high copy number targets measured by RT-QPCR (PMMoV, MHV, and BCoV), the

223

results from reactions that yielded the highest measured concentration were used to balance

224

loss of signal against effects of inhibitory substances. For ddRT-PCR data, “total error” from

225

merged wells is reported in the form of standard deviations. Pearson correlation coefficients

226

assessed association between different measurements among samples.

228

We used a resampling-based strategy to evaluate whether the observed measurements N1 and

229

N2 with and without PMMoV normalization were predictive of clinically confirmed cases. We

230

applied first differencing to account for autocorrelation, resulting in the following regression

231

specification (using N1 as the example): Casest – Casest-k ~ N1t – N1t-k where the subscript t

232

indicates the day of measurement and k is the number of days used for differencing, in this case

233

7; k = 14 was also used as a sensitivity test. If a wastewater data point was missing at day t-k,

234

then the value for the closest date was imputed. In order to account for the technical variability

235

of the measurements, the observed top and bottom confidence bounds were used to resample

236

wastewater concentrations uniformly. For samples below the detection limit, we used uniform

237

sampling between 0 and the lower detection limit (estimated at 40 copies/g dry weight). In

238

addition to raw case counts, 7-d smoothed case data were also used to account for the day-to-

239

day variation in case data. A downsampling analyses was conducted to investigate the

240

frequency of sample collection needed to observe associations between case counts and

241

wastewater data. We downsampling to fortnightly, weekly, and twice-per-week frequencies

242

using a random observation within each appropriate period and examined as described above

243

except k for biweekly was are 2 or 4 half-weeks, and for weekly and fortnightly the k was 1 or 2

244

(weeks/fortnights). Empirical p-values were determined with 1,000 resamplings were reported.

254

template was diluted 1:10 and cDNA was diluted 1:10, except for a single influent from POTW B

255

(Table S3) that resulted in detection below the limit of quantification. When one-step ddRT-PCR

256

was applied to the same undiluted and 1:10 diluted RNA templates, one sample tested positive

257

for N1 in POTW A, three tested positive for N1 at POTW B, and one tested positive for N2 in

258

POTW B (Table S4). In all but one of the samples that resulted in positive measurements, the

259

undiluted template yielded a non-detect, suggesting inhibition of the reactions in the undiluted

260

template.

261
262

For solids samples extracted with powerfecal kits and analyzed with RT-QPCR, SARS-CoV-2

263

targets were detected in at least one biological replicate from 1 of 5 samples from POTW A and

264

4 of 7 samples from POTW B (Table S3). Detection was inconsistent across biological and

265

technical replicates, and there was no case where both biological or technical replicates were

266

positive. When analyzed with ddRT-PCR, the SARS-CoV-2 targets were detected and

267

quantified in 0 out of 5 POTW-A solids samples and 7 out of 7 POTW B samples (Table S4).

268

ddRT-PCR results were more consistent across biological replicates than RT-QPCR (Figure 1;

269

Table S4).

270
271

The improved performance of ddRT-PCR compared to RT-QPCR for both influent and solids

272

samples was unlikely due to differences in template amounts. The virtual influent volumes in

273

RT-QPCR and ddRT-PCR assays were 2 mL and 8.4 mL, respectively (when template not

diluted); and for solids, the virtual wet mass of solids assays in the RT-QPCR and ddRT-PCR

275

reactions were 20 mg and 50 mg, respectively (when template not diluted); thus theoretical

276

lower detection limits are similar across analytical approaches (Table S5). There are several

277

possible explanations for the low and inconsistent detection of SARS-CoV-2 targets in influent

278

and solids with RT-QPCR, including assay inhibition, and the absence or low occurrence of viral

279

RNA in the samples. We studied RT-QPCR inhibition in more depth using endogenous PMMoV

and spiked MHV and BCoV (Figure S3). The results demonstrate inhibition for the RT-QPCR

281

assays of endogenous and exogenous recovery targets, despite efforts to alleviate it using the

282

Zymo OneStep Inhibitor Removal columns and dilution of template. For influent, PMMoV and

283

MHV concentrations were generally highest when RNA template was diluted 1:10 prior to RT,

284

compared to results from undiluted and 1:10 diluted cDNA generated from undiluted RNA

285

template (Figure S3). This suggests the RT step, and not the PCR step, was most inhibited for

286

the PMMoV and MHV RT-QPCR assays. For solids, extract dilutions of 1:50 appeared to

287

alleviate inhibition for RNA obtained from POTW A (Figure S3; Table S6). For solids from

288

POTW B, however, inhibition may not have not alleviated even after a 1:50 dilution.

289
290

Based on these results comparing the performance of RT-qPCR and ddRT-PCR, and the

291

improved sensitivity of the ddRT-PCR, we selected the ddRT-PCR methods for further SARS-

292

CoV-2 analysis.

293
294

Method Evaluation: Comparison of RNeasy and powerfecal extraction kits and 1-step vs.

295

2-step ddPCR for settled solids. We used the SARS-CoV-2 ddRT-PCR assays and the

296

POTW B solids to compare powerfecal and Rneasy solids extraction kits. The virtual wet mass

297

of solids assayed in the duplicate merged wells was approximately 50 mg (powerfecal) and 250

298

mg (RNeasy) when the templates were not diluted (theoretical detection limits in Table S5).

299

Samples treated with the powerfecal kit were more commonly positive for SARS-CoV-2 targets

300

in undiluted template than in 1:10 diluted template (Figure 1). By contrast, samples treated with

301

the RNeasy kit were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at both dilutions, but detection was more

302

consistent with the 1:10 diluted templates (Figure 1). The SARS-CoV-2 target concentrations

303

were similar across the biological replicates and the null hypothesis that paired replicates have

304

the same concentration was not rejected (p>0.05 for all 4 comparisons (2 targets X 2 RNA

305

extraction kits), paired t-test). The concentrations of N1 and N2 measured in the same sample /

306

biological replicate were not different between the two kits (paired t-test, p>0.05). Although the

307

powerfecal kit samples less material than the RNeasy kit, these results suggest that some of the

308

RNeasy kit extracts require a 1:10 dilution, thus negating the advantages of the extra sample

309

mass.

310
311

Whereas the N1 target was detected in every solids sample from POTW B when the 1-step

312

ddRT-PCR assay was employed, it was not detected in any of the RNeasy extracts when a 2-

313

step ddRT-PCR assay was conducted.

314
315

Method Evaluation: Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations measured in

316

influent and primary sludge. We compared SARS-CoV-2 measurements made in influent and

317

solids samples collected on the same days at POTW B (Figure 1). Solids results obtained using

318

the powerfecal kits are used for the comparisons. At POTW B, the N1 target was detected in 3

319

out of 7 influent samples and 6 out of 7 solids samples and the N2 target was detected in 1 out

320

of 7 influent samples and 7 out of 7 solids samples. The N1 target was quantified in both influent

321

and primary solids on 3 dates (3/29, 4/1, 4/15) and the N2 target was quantified in both influent

322

and primary solids on 1 date (3/30). The ratio of N1 solids concentrations (cp/g; mean of

323

biological replicates) to influent concentrations (cp/mL) on the 3 dates was 720, 620, and 350

324

ml/g respectively. For the N2 target, the ratio was 3100 ml/g. These results suggest that on a

325

per mass basis, these targets are present at between ~100 and ~1000 higher concentrations in

326

solids.

327

Method Evaluation: Recovery of viral targets through preanalytical processing. Recovery

329

measurements help characterize preanalytical method consistency across samples. For the

the PEG concentration method (Figure S4). Median PMMoV recovery was 21% (range: 8% to

332

30%) and median MHV recovery was 7% (range: 2% to 16%). MHV recovery was lower than

333

that for PMMoV by, on average, 13% (paired t-test, p<0.05). We used BoCoV to assess

334

recovery specifically through nucleic-acid extraction and purification, and through inhibitor

335

removal steps. Recovery of BCoV through these steps ranged from 3% to 48% (median= 26%).

336

The PEG concentration step and nucleic acid extraction/purifications step are conducted in

337

series. Assuming that the BCoV extraction recoveries apply to all viral targets, our results

338

suggest that viral recoveries are between 0.1-7% (median 1%, based on MHV) or 1-8% (median

339

7%, based on PMMoV) of actual influent concentrations.

340
341

There were no significant differences in recoveries of PMMoV, MHV, and BCoV in influent

342

between the two POTWs (t-test, p>0.05), or in samples that were positive or negative for N1 or

343

N2 (t-test, p>0.05). In fact, the influent sample with one of the lowest MHV and BCoV recoveries

344

(POTW B on 3/29/20) was one of the few influent samples positive for N1.

345
346

PMMoV may serve not only as a process control, but also a means of assessing the “fecal

347

strength” of sewage. PMMoV measured in the viral concentrate varied between 7.7 x 102 to 7.0

348

x 103 copies/ml of influent across plants (Figure S4). There was no significant difference in

349

PMMoV influent concentrations between plants (p>0.05).

351

Method Evaluation: Endogenous and spiked virus recoveries in solids from method

evaluation study. There was no viral concentration steps in the solid methods and BCoV

353

served as an extraction recovery control. BCoV recovery varied from 0% to 33% (median =

354

16%) using the powerfecal kit and 0% to 48% (median = 22%) using the RNeasy kit (Figures S5

355

and S6). The 0% recovery values were obtained in POTW B solids collected on 15 April and

356

treated with the RNeasy kit and POTW B solids collected on 25 March and treated with the

357

powerfecal kit. Interestingly, PMMoV and SARS-CoV-2 targets were measured in the same

358

extracts with 0% BCoV recovery at concentrations not largely different from other dates. The

359

measured BCoV recoveries were not different across plants or across extraction kits (t-test,

360

p>0.05). It is possible, however, that the BCoV recoveries in the POTW B solids are

361

underestimates because we are not certain that the RT-QPCR assay conducted at the highest

362

extract dilution was free of inhibition.

363
364

PMMoV in solids from POTW A and POTW B varied between 5x104 and 7x107 copies/g dry

365

weight (median 2 x 106 copies/g) when extracted with powerfecal kit (Figure S6). Only samples

366

from POTW B were measured with the RNeasy extraction kit and the resulting concentrations

367

ranged from 5x105 to 3x106 copies/g dry weight (median 1 x 106 copies/g; Figure S5). These

368

concentrations are twice as high, on average, than those measured using the powerfecal

369

templates (paired t-test, p<0.05). The PMMoV concentrations may be underestimates due to

370

unresolved assay inhibition. Concentrations of PMMoV were not different across biological

371

replicates regardless of which extraction kit was used (paired t-test, p>0.05). PMMoV

372

concentrations measured in solids at POTW A were not different from those measured at

373

POTW B (t-test, p>0.05, data from powerfecal extracts).

374
375

N1 and N2 concentrations in solids are not correlated to BCoV recovery or PMMoV

376

concentrations regardless of kit used (p>0.05) (Figures S5 and S6).

377
378

Longitudinal data from POTW B. The method performance experiments demonstrated that

379

the primary solids method resulted in more positive and consistent SARS-CoV-2 signals than

380

the influent method. Furthermore, we found that the 1-step ddRTPCR assay performed on the

381

solids extracts resulted in more positive results than the 2-step RT-qPCR and 2-step ddRTPCR

382

assays. We therefore focused our longitudinal analysis on primary settled solids samples from

383

POTW B using the RNeasy kit and ddRT-PCR for measuring all targets (Figure 2).

384

Concentrations of N1 and N2 in each sample were derived from the reactions that used

385

undiluted RNA template unless those that used 1:10 diluted template produced a concentration

386

higher than the upper standard deviation for the undiluted template (10/96 and 6/96 samples

387

required 1:10 dilution for N1 and N2, respectively).

388
389

N1 and N2 were detected in 79 and 68 of the 96 samples. When detected, average N1 and N2

390

values were 870 cp/g and 730 cp/g with maximums of 3330 cp/g and 4250 cp/g, respectively.

391

Replicate extractions generally yielded concentrations that were similar.

392
393

Median PMMoV was 2x107 cp/g (interquartile range 1 x107 cp/g to 4 x107 cp/g) (Figure S7)

394

suggesting fairly constant fecal strength of the solids. We normalized measured concentrations

395

of N1 and N2 to obtain fecal strength normalized target concentrations to include in the

396

statistical analyses. The recovery of BcoV was lower in the longitudinal samples than it was in

397

the method evaluation samples, with a median recovery was 3% (interquartile range 1 to 5%)

398

(Figure SA). We omitted the N1 and N2 data from our dataset for the one sample where 0%

399

BCoV recovery was measured (16 March). Recovery was higher than 10% on 8 days; N1 and

400

N2 concentrations were not significantly different on those days compared to the others

401

(p>0.05).

403

The concentrations of N1 and N2 tracked the reporting of new cases in the sewershed (based

404

on specimen date) when accounting for autocorrelation and technical errors associated with the

405

wastewater measurements (using raw case counts, 0.024 cases / copies /g for both N1 and N2,

406

p = 0 and 0.005, respectively). Results were not sensitive to choice of k, smoothing of case

407

data, or normalization of N1 and N2 by PMMoV to account for changing sample-to-sample

differences in fecal strength or recovery (Table S8). Downsampling wastewater data collection

Discussion

415
416

Our results suggest that testing wastewater solids for SARS-CoV-2 may be more sensitive than

417

testing influent. We detected co-occurring SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 targets in nearly every solid

418

sample tested at POTW B, yet both targets were never co-detected in influent samples. The

419

lack of detection of SARS-CoV-2 targets at POTW A in both influent and solids may be a result

420

of low prevalence of COVID-19 in the relatively small sewershed. The measured ratios of N1

421

and N2 concentrations in solids and influent were between 350 and 3100 ml/g; these values are

422

likely low estimates as the influent N1 and N2 concentrations were below our detection limit in

423

most of the samples from many days when N1 and N2 were detected in solids. Depending on

424

the pre-analytical method used in our study (i.e., extraction kit, template dilution factor, etc.),

425

there was between 20 and 1100 times more influent than dry solids on a per mass basis in the

426

PCR reactions. Given that solids have, at minimum, between 350 and 3100 higher

427

concentrations, the number of target copies could be much higher in the PCR reactions for

428

solids compared to influent. The increased sensitivity in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in solids will be

429

particularly important for screening communities at the sewershed scale for outbreaks occurring

430

within communities with low levels of COVID-19 prevalence. Other viruses have a high affinity

431

for wastewater solids including adenovirus, rotavirus, and various enteroviruses28–31, so solids

432

are likely to be useful for WBE applied to other viral diseases. We also note that solids analysis

433

avoids the preconcentration step necessary with influent analysis.

435

Using longitudinal samples from POTW B, we identified a positive association between N1 and

436

N2 in solids and the number of new COVID-19 infections. A similar result was reported by

437

Peccia et al.22 for a POTW on the east coast of the US. When N1 and N2 are normalized by

438

fecal strength, as determined by PMMoV, associations were similar. Whether the N1 and N2

439

signals lead the new case data requires further analysis complicated by the autocorrelation of

440

the data. Evaluating multiple POTWs will improve robustness of such estimates. The positive

441

associations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RNA in solids can be used to confirm trends in infection

442

prevalence; and therefore, augment case data to inform a response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

443
444

Ideally, wastewater surveillance could take place with high resolutions sample collection (e.g.,

445

daily); however, this may not be possible for many utilities/communities due to limited staffing,

446

supplies, and resources. Our down-sampling analysis suggests sampling solids twice per week

447

would be frequent enough to identify the global trends in the clinical case data. It is important to

448

note that case data itself are imperfect as testing availability, population testing bias, and time to

449

testing result can vary substantially. For example, during the initial phase of the pandemic

450

(between mid-March to mid-April), clinical testing was not widely available to people residing in

451

the sewershed; however, sentinel surveillance efforts suggest that during this time that there

452

was transmission in the community32. While prevalence in the sewershed during this period is

453

unknown, given limited testing, interestingly, solids concentration of N1 and N2 are just as high

454

during the initial infection peak as during the second infection peak and may represent an

455

additional, less biased source of monitoring data.

456
457

Whereas Peccia et al.22 recently reported correlations between N1 and N1 in sludge and new

458

COVID-19 cases during a period when infections were rising, we report correlations across both

459

rising and falling periods of the epidemiological curve. Given that individuals likely shed SARS-

460

CoV-2 for weeks33,34, it is somewhat surprising that SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations correlate

461

with the number of new COVID-19 infections. This result may yield insight into the time course

462

and magnitude of fecal shedding and is consistent with substantially higher shedding rates

463

during the initial phase of the infection35. More fecal shedding data are needed, especially for

464

pre-symptomatic individuals to fully understand if SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in solids

465

can be linked quantitatively to prevalence of infection in the sewershed.

466
467

The RNA extraction, concentration, and purification procedures used in this study did not

468

eliminate RT and PCR inhibition, despite the use of clean-up kits. Dilution of templates was

469

needed, at times, for both influent and solids to obtain signals, even using ddRT-PCR which is

470

known to decrease the effects of inhibition in some cases36,37. Wastewater is a diverse, complex

471

matrix that differs chemically and biologically between POTWs. Presence of metals, organics,

472

and other material can impede the reverse transcription and PCR 38. The solids from POTW B

473

appeared to be more highly inhibited than those from POTW A, likely because they contain Fe-

474

containing compounds as a result of their FeCl3 addition, a known PCR inhibitor39. These results

475

highlight the importance of testing for inhibition in wastewater matrices and also the need for

476

more research on how to alleviate inhibition without diluting the extracts.

477
478

We used recovery controls in our analyses including an endogenous, non-enveloped virus

479

(PMMoV), and two beta coronaviruses (MHV and BCoV). The recoveries we report are similar

480

to those reported by others40–43. We did not correct concentrations reported in this study using

481

measured recoveries as there is great uncertainty regarding whether a recovery surrogate

482

mimics the behavior of the virus of interest - in this case SARS-CoV-2, even if it shares certain

483

biological characteristics. It is impossible to know confidently that the spiked recovery target will

484

interact with the components of the matrix in the same manner that an endogenous target

485

interacts. In addition, it is not known whether the spiked recovery control mimics the state of the

486

endogenous SARS-CoV-2 targets as it is unknown whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus exists as an

487

intact virion in the sewage matrices, or if its lipid envelope is absent, or if its RNA is located

488

outside of a lysed capsid. In light of all these complexities, we believe that recovery of a

489

surrogate should be used to ensure that sample processing is not “out of the ordinary”, and can

490

be used to identify problems during sample processing. Indeed, during the longitudinal sample

491

processing we identified 1 sample where the BCoV recovery control failed, and removed that

492

sample’s data from subsequent statistical analysis.

493
494

Surprisingly, we found that recovery for the longitudinal samples was reduced compared to that

495

for the method evaluation study suggesting that the modifications we made to reduce

496

processing time adversely affected recovery. An unanticipated benefit of the reduced recovery

497

was reduced inhibition. During the methods evaluation study, the RNeasy-processed solid

498

samples contained inhibitors such that N1 and N2 had to be measured in 1:10 dilutions of the

499

template. During the longitudinal study, N1 and N2 could be measured in the undiluted template

500

suggesting less inhibitors were co-extracted. This illustrates a tradeoff between inhibition and

501

recovery. The reduced recovery observed for the longitudinal samples also explains why

502

concentrations of N1 and N2 were higher by about a factor of ~4 at POTW B during method

503

evaluation compared to samples from similar dates during the longitudinal study.

504
505

The amount of feces or urine in wastewater may vary with time based on sewershed

506

populations, precipitation, changing waste streams, or human behaviors44. Such variation may

507

affect targets relative to WBE and in this case, SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Normalization refers to the

508

normalization of a WBE target by another wastewater target that is a measure of the amount of

509

fecal material in the wastewater. Normalization is not a practice that has been extensively tested

510

in environmental virology. However, it has been explored in the use of wastewater-based

511

epidemiology for drug use 44–46. We tested PMMoV as a normalization factor as it is found

512

extensively in wastewater globally and it originates in human feces47. PMMoV concentrations

513

measured in the influent and solids of the plants we sampled did not vary substantially across

514

samples or plants47 suggesting limited changes to the fecal content of the wastestream during

515

the study. This may explain why normalizing N1 and N2 by PMMoV did not substantially change

516

correlations with new COVID-19 cases in the sewershed.

517
518

Implications and future work. Solids naturally concentrate SARS-CoV-2, making it a reliable

519

target for WBE. However, there are situations where solids analysis may be impractical. For

520

example, POTWs with no primary settling step or for sewage sampling from manholes within a

521

sewershed, solids may be difficult to.

522
523

There are several avenues of research needed to further understand the limitations and utility of

524

WBE for COVID-19. First, more information is needed about the decay of viral targets both in

525

influent48 as well as within solids. This information is needed to better understand how infection

526

in the sewershed affects concentrations in wastewater matrices. Second, the degree to which

527

settled solids represent a natural composite sample owing to mixing processes in the settling

528

tank need would be useful. While composite samples of influent are preferred over grab

529

samples owing the changes in the influent stream with time 49, the same may not be true for

530

settled solids eliminating the need for composite samplers. Importantly, additional information

531

on duration and magnitude of shedding of viral RNA via feces is needed; as well as the extent to

532

which viral RNA is encapsulated versus extravirual in feces and sewage is needed to predict its

533

fate and transport in the wastestream.
